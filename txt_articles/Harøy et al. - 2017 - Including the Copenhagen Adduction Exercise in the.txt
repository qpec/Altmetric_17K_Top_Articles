ABSTRACT 
Background: The FIFA 11+ was developed as a complete warm-up program to prevent injuries in 
soccer players. Although reduced hip adduction strength is associated with groin injuries, none of the 
exercises included in the FIFA 11+ seem to specifically target hip adduction strength. 
Purpose: To investigate the effect on eccentric hip adduction strength of the FIFA 11+ warm-up 
program with or without the Copenhagen Adduction exercise. 
Study Design: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial  
Methods: We recruited 45 eligible players from two U19 elite male soccer teams. Players were 
randomized into two groups; one group carried out the standard FIFA 11+ program, while the other 
carried out the FIFA 11+, but replaced the Nordic Hamstring exercise with the Copenhagen Adduction 
exercise. Both groups performed the intervention three times weekly for 8 weeks. Players completed 
eccentric strength and sprint testing before and after the intervention. Per-protocol analyses were 
performed, with 12 players excluded due to low compliance (<67% of sessions completed). 
Main Outcome: Eccentric hip adduction strength (Nm/kg). 
Results: Between-group analyses showed that there was a significant greater increase in eccentric 
hip adduction strength of 0.29 Nm/kg (8.9%, p=0.01) in favor of the group performing the 
Copenhagen Adduction exercise, while there was no within-group change in the group that used the 
standard FIFA 11+ program (-0.02 Nm/kg (-0.7%), p=0.69). 
Conclusion: Including the Copenhagen Adduction exercise in the FIFA 11+ program increases 
eccentric hip adduction strength, while the standard FIFA 11+ program does not.

BACKGROUND 
The FIFA 11+ was developed as a complete warm-up program to prevent injuries in youth and 
amateur soccer players.2,29 Large randomized controlled trials (RCT), both on female and male 
players, have confirmed that the program prevents non-contact injuries in soccer.22,28,29 Of these, two 
reported data on groin injuries and with conflicting results, showing no reduction in young female 
footballers,29 but a significant reduction among male collegiate players.28 
 
Although adductor-related groin pain is the most common groin injury among soccer players9,11,14,27 
and low hip adductor strength has been shown to represent a risk factor for groin injury in soccer,10 
none of the exercises included in the FIFA 11+ seem to target hip adduction strength specifically. The 
apparent absence of adductor strengthening exercises might therefore represent a limitation of the 
11+ 
 
A recent study examining the EMG activation patterns of 8 strength exercises showed that the 
Copenhagen Adduction (CA) exercise targets the hip adductors, suggesting that it may be suitable for 
groin injury prevention and rehabilitation.26 CA is a simple eccentric partner exercise requiring no 
equipment. Therefore, like the Nordic Hamstring (NH) exercise, it can easily be used as a high-
intensity exercise on the field, before or after, soccer activity. The NH exercise has been documented 
to prevent hamstring injuries effectively, both as an isolated exercise1,24,31 and as a part of a warm-up 
program.28 
 
In soccer, kicking is the most frequent injury mechanism for acute groin injuries.27 Improving the 
length-tension relationship using an exercise that includes heavy eccentric loading therefore seems 
relevant to prevent adductor injuries. In under-19 sub-elite soccer players performing an intensive 
protocol of the CA exercise for 8 weeks, a 36% increase in eccentric hip adduction strength was 
 5 
 
achieved.16 However, we do not know the strength effect of the CA exercise, using an exercise 
prescription matching that of the NH exercise in the FIFA 11+ program. 
 
Thus, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect on eccentric hip 
adduction strength of the FIFA 11+ warm-up program with or without the Copenhagen Adduction 
exercise. We hypothesized that eccentric hip adduction strength would increase in players 
randomized to replace the NH exercise in the FIFA 11+ program with a similar CA exercise protocol. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study design and participants 
We invited 45 players from two elite male U19 soccer teams in the Oslo region to take part in an 8-
week randomized controlled trial during pre-season (January-March 2016). Included players had to 
be healthy and able to perform strength and performance testing prior to the intervention period. 
 
Randomization and blinding 
We randomized players individually into two different training groups, the Nordic Hamstring group 
(NH group) or Copenhagen Adduction group (CA group). A neutral, blinded person who had no 
further involvement in the study, made a computer-generated list which was used to randomize 
players stratified according to team belonging. After baseline testing, players received a sealed 
envelope, from the principal investigator with their group assignment. All testers were blinded to 
group allocation during pre- and post-testing. The physiotherapists instructing the team warm-up 
sessions were not blinded to group assignment.

Intervention procedures 
Players in the NH group were asked to carry out the FIFA 11+ warm-up program as described 
previously,29 including the NH exercise, while players in the CA group were asked to carry out the 
FIFA 11+, but to replace the NH exercise with the CA exercise. The exercise prescription for the CA 
exercise was the same as described for NH in the FIFA 11+ program, however, performed separately 
on each side (table 1).29 We assigned a physiotherapist to each team (AB and LER), to ensure 
adequate instructions on how to perform the exercise programs, and to supervise every training 
session. Players on the same team completed the FIFA 11+ together during warm-up, except for the 
NH and CA exercise, where they split up according to group assignment. 
Table 1 Exercise prescription for the NH and CA exercise.29 
 
The Copenhagen Adduction exercise 
The CA exercise is a partner exercise where the player lies on the side with one forearm as support 
on the floor and the other arm placed along the body.26 The upper leg is held at approximately hip 
height of the partner, who holds the leg with one arm supporting the ankle and the other supporting 
the knee (position A in figure 1). The player then raises the body from the field and the lower leg is 
adducted so that the feet touch each other and the body is in a straight line (position B in figure 1). 
The body is then lowered halfway to the ground while the foot of the lower leg is lowered so that it 
just touches the floor without using it for support.26 The exercise is performed on both sides. Video 
of the CA exercise is available as an online supplementary appendix.

Strength and performance testing 
All tests were performed four days prior to the first training session in the intervention period 
(January 2016) and within four days after completion of the last training session (March 2016). The 
players performed eccentric strength tests and a 20 m sprint test. The players were not permitted to 
play matches during the last two days prior to testing, but were allowed to participate in regular 
soccer training sessions.  
 
The players completed a form with personal and demographic information and were weighed prior 
to testing. All players performed a warm-up of 15 min light running (11 km/h) on a treadmill (PRO, 
Woodway, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA). Strength and performance tests were performed in the same 
order pre- and post-intervention, starting with the eccentric hip adduction strength test, 20 m sprint 
test and finishing with the eccentric knee flexor strength test. 
 
Eccentric hip adduction strength test 
The test set-up included a portable hand-held dynamometer (Hoggan microFET2, Hoggan Scientific, 
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) and an examination table. A physiotherapist (MVH), with 80 h of testing 
experience, performed both pre- and post-testing. The dominant and non-dominant leg were tested 
on all players, the left leg first. Eccentric hip adduction strength was measured in a break test with 
 8 
 
the player in a side-lying position with the leg being tested in a straight position, as described by 
Thorborg et al.30 (figure 2). The physiotherapist placed the hand-held dynamometer 5 cm proximal of 
the most prominent part of the medial malleolus and the player exerted a 3-5 s isometric maximum 
voluntary contraction against the dynamometer before the physiotherapist performed a break of the 
contraction to measure the eccentric hip adduction strenght.30 This testing method has been used in 
several studies examining hip adductor strength in soccer players.4,16,17,20,23,30 The intra-tester 
reliability it has been reported with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 and standard 
error of measurement (SEM) of 6.3%.30 The player was asked to complete one practice trial before 
performing three maximal tests and the best result was retained. The players had a 30-s rest period 
between each trial. The rest period was introduced to avoid a decline in strength across trials due to 
fatigue. The standardized command by the examiner was "go ahead-push-push-push-push-push". 
 
Leg length was measured in the supine position from the most prominent point of the anterior 
superior iliac spine to 5 cm proximal to the most prominent point of the medial malleolus. Leg length 
was used to calculate torque, and adjusted to body-mass (Nm/kg).

position of the test.

Eccentric knee flexor strength test 
The same two physiotherapists (AB and LER) performed the pre- and post-testing. Eccentric knee 
flexor strength was measured using a NordBord (VALD Performance, Brisbane, Australia), as 
described by Opar et al.21 For test-retest reliability an ICC of 0.83 to 0.90, typical error of 5.6% to 
7.4% and MDC of 15.6% to 20.5% has been reported.21 The player was asked to perform one practice 
trial before performing one set of three maximal repetitions. All force values were body-mass 
adjusted (N/kg). The best of three maximal trials was retained. The standardized command by the 
examiner was "go ahead-hold-hold-hold ". The investigator monitored the performance of all 
repetitions visually, and a repetition was rejected if the NH was not performed as instructed.  
 
20-m sprint test 
The 20-m sprint tests were performed on an indoor 8-mm Mondotrack FTS surface (Mondo, 
Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA) using a Newtest Powertimer portable system (Ele-Products Oy, 
Tyrnävä, Finland) using infrared photocells (Model 300s) mounted on the sprint running track and 
connected to a computer that measures time to the nearest 0.001 s. The same experienced tester 
(MM) performed both the pre- and post-testing. Players performed two sub-maximal 20 m sprints 
before maximal sprint testing. Maximum running speed (s) was tested by sprinting 3 x 20 m with 4-6 
min of recovery between trials. The time was measured for every 5 m and the best results (0-5 m, 0-
10 m, 0-15 m and 0-20 m) were retained for analyses. 
 
Outcome measures 
The primary outcome was eccentric hip adduction strength (Nm/kg). Secondary outcomes were 
eccentric knee flexor strength (N/kg) and 0-5 m, 0-10 m, 0-15 m and 0-20 m sprint times (s). 
 
 10 
 
The physiotherapist assigned to each team registered weekly compliance with the warm-up program 
for each player, soccer training and match exposure, weekly maximal delayed-onset muscle soreness 
(DOMS) in the adductor and hamstring muscle groups using a 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 
(0-10).12 
 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on a previous study examining eccentric hip adduction 
strength effects of the CA.16 For a 10% increase in eccentric hip adductor strength, the expected 
between group difference was set at 0.28 Nm/kg and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.32 Nm/kg. With 
a power of 80% and a significance level (α) of 0.05, we needed 20 players in each group. 
 
Statistical analyses 
All outcome variables were analyzed according to the per-protocol principle, conducted with a 
minimum compliance limit set at 16 training sessions (67%). Intention-to-treat analyses were not 
performed, since we were interested in the potential efficacy of the exercise, and therefore only in 
participants who complied with the specific intervention as planned.13 Players in both groups were 
excluded from the analyses if they performed any individual hamstring or hip adductor-specific 
training in addition to the intervention during the study period. Moreover, players were excluded 
from the analyses if they were unable to perform either strength or performance testing at baseline 
or after the intervention period due to injury or illness. The per-protocol exclusion criteria were 
determined a priori.  
 
Between group difference in baseline characteristics and exposure were assed using an independent 
t-test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Between-group differences in strength and performance 
tests were assessed using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), using pre-test as a 
covariate.32 Within-group differences from pre- to post-test were assessed using paired t-tests. We 
 11 
 
included both legs in these analyses to obtain robust variance estimations, but incorporated player as 
a cluster variable in the models. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d and interpreted as small 
(d=0.2), moderate (d=0.5) and large (d=0.8).7 We performed all analyses using SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA) and STATA (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical 
Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). An α level of ≤0.05 was considered 
significant. Data are presented as mean values with their SD or 95% confidence interval (CI), as 
appropriate. 
 
Ethics 
In accordance with The Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Regional Committees for Medical 
Research Ethics (2015/1921/REK) South East and the Norwegian Social Science and Data Service 
(45393/3/LT/LR), all participants received written and oral information about the purposes and 
procedures of the project before providing their written consent to participate in the study. The trial 
was registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry 
(ISRCTN13731446). This report is prepared according to the Consort Statement recommendations for 
reporting randomized trials.19 
 
RESULTS 
Study flow 
The flow of participants throughout the study is shown in figure 3. Of the 45 eligible players invited 
and tested at baseline, one player in the CA group suffered a knee injury and one player in the NH 
group suffered a groin injury during the intervention period and were unable to complete post-
testing. A total of 8 players were excluded from the per-protocol analyses due to a compliance ≤67%. 
Of these, two players attended training with the clubs senior squad for >4 weeks, two goalkeepers 
had individual warm-up, and four players had long periods with illness or injury (3-7 weeks). Another 
 12 
 
two players, one in each group, were excluded from the analyses due to intensive hip adductor 
rehabilitation of groin injury suffered during the study period.

Of the 24 training sessions planned, the average compliance was 21.5±1.9 sessions (90% of planned

Primary outcome: eccentric hip adduction strength 
Eccentric hip adduction strength increased in the group performing the CA exercise and between-
group analyses revealed that there was a significant group effect (table 3). The between group effect 
size calculation suggested a moderate to large (d=0.60) strength effect. Within-group analyses 
showed that there was an increase in eccentric hip adduction strength in the CA group.

While within-group analyses showed that there was an increase in eccentric knee flexion strength in 
5 
the NH group, we did not detect any significant between-group difference (table 3). We did not

Delayed-onset muscle soreness 
9 
DOMS was reported throughout the intervention period, for both muscle groups, with a median of 
10 
zero. The individual range in DOMS for the hip adductors was 0 to 8 in the CA group and 0 to 6 in the 
11 
NH group. The highest DOMS of 8 was reported by two players in the CA group at week 1. The range 
12 
in DOMS for the hamstring muscle group was 0 to 9 in the CA group and 0 to 7 in the NH group. The 
13 
highest DOMS of 9 was reported by one player in the CA group in week 5. We had no reports of any 
14 
adverse effects related to performing the study interventions.

16 
DISCUSSION 
17 
This is the first study investigating the eccentric hip adduction strength effect of the FIFA 11+ warm-
18 
up program. Our main finding was that replacing the NH exercise with the CA exercise in the FIFA 11+ 
19 
warm-up program increases eccentric hip adduction strength in U19 elite male soccer players, while 
20 
the standard FIFA 11+ program had no effect on eccentric hip adduction strength. The standard FIFA 
21 
11+ increases eccentric knee flexion strength in the NH group; however, we found no between-group 
22 
differences. 
23 
 
24 
We found an 8.9% increase in eccentric hip adduction strength effect in favor of the players 
25 
performing the CA exercise. The strength increase in the present study is considerably lower 
26 
compared to a recent Danish study that showed a 35.7% increase in eccentric hip adduction strength 
27 
using the same exercise and testing procedure.16 However, one crucial factor may explain the 
28 
discrepancy. In the present study, we prescribed three weekly training sessions consisting of one set 
29 
 16 
 
on each side and a variation from 3-5 to 12-15 repetitions, resulting in a total of 72 (level 1) to 360 
30 
(level 3) repetitions on each side during the 8-weeks. The protocol used by Ishøi et al.16 consisted of 
31 
two weekly training sessions, with two or three sets on each side and a progression from 6 to 15 
32 
repetitions, resulting in a total of maximum 480 repetitions on each side. This suggests that there 
33 
could be a dose-response relationship between training load and outcome, explaining the 
34 
substantially greater strength effect in the Danish study.16 
35 
 
36 
Secondary outcomes 
37 
Players performing the standard FIFA 11+ program, including the NH exercise, showed a 7.7% within-
38 
group increase in eccentric knee flexor strength, while we did not detect a significant increase in the 
39 
CA group or between groups. Previous studies examining the eccentric knee flexor strength effect of 
40 
the FIFA 11+ have shown conflicting results, ranging from -10.1% to 12.7% within-group change after 
41 
8-12 weeks using the FIFA 11+ during warm-up.8,15,25 The conflicting results may reflect differences in 
42 
playing levels, intervention period and compliance of the program. Also, the NordBord used to 
43 
measure eccentric knee flexor strength in the present study differ from the isokinetic dynamometer 
44 
used in other studies.8,15,25 Testing using the NordBord may overestimate the measurement 
45 
compared to isokinetic strength testing due to specificity, as the test set-up using a NordBord 
46 
replicates the execution of the NH exercise.  
47 
 
48 
The same dose-response relationship as for hip adduction strength seems to exist for eccentric knee 
49 
flexor strength, as well. The 7.7% strength increase in the NH group is somewhat less than what has 
50 
been previously reported when the full NH protocol is performed (11%).18 This protocol has been 
51 
demonstrated to substantially decrease the risk of hamstring injuries and re-injuries in soccer.1,24,31 
52 
Although the strength increase from performing the FIFA 11+ is somewhat lower compared to the 
53 
full Nordic Hamstring protocol, it has also been shown to be sufficient to prevent hamstring 
54 
injuries.28  
55 
 17 
 
 
56 
We found no within- or between-group effect on sprint speed when using FIFA 11+ warm-up 
57 
program, with or without the CA exercise. This indicates that the program lacks appropriate load to 
58 
increase sprint performance in elite U19 players performing it for 8 weeks. The results are in 
59 
accordance with data on Italian amateur players.15 In contrast, Reis et al.25  showed a significant 
60 
improvement in 5 m and 30 m sprint (8.9% and 3.3%, respectively) after a 12-week period using the 
61 
FIFA 11+ among adolescent male futsal players. The increased sprint performance among the 
62 
Portuguese futsal players might be explained by the duration of the intervention period (4 additional 
63 
weeks) or the lower competitive level and baseline strength compared to the elite players in the 
64 
present study. 
65 
 
66 
The median of DOMS was the same for both intervention groups and it seems that only a few players 
67 
report higher DOMS associated with the respective exercise. Therefore, highest values of DOMS 
68 
reported were associated to football training. For implementation of the exercise as an in-season 
69 
exercise, it is important to minimize DOMS. The low dose of the CA exercise in the present study 
70 
seems to increase hip adductor strength without causing DOMS. 
71 
 
72 
Methodological considerations 
73 
Players were not blinded to intervention type; however, we are confident that contamination 
74 
between groups has been reduced to a minimum. The physiotherapist supervising every training 
75 
session recorded if a player performed any other hamstring or hip adductor strength exercises during 
76 
their individual training sessions. The two players that performed extensive hip adductor due to 
77 
rehabilitation of groin injury suffered during the intervention period were not included in the per-
78 
protocol analyses. 
79 
 
80 
 18 
 
Although knee flexor strength testing using the NordBord has become increasingly popular recent 
81 
years, there is limited documentation on the reliability and validity of the measurements. While the 
82 
test-retest reliability is reported to be good, 21 there is no data on the inter- or intra-tester reliability 
83 
and an increase in 15% to 20% must be achieved to reflect a true change in strength at an individual 
84 
level. Similar challenges in detecting change has been reported for hip adduction strength testing as 
85 
well. Using a similar test set-up as in the present study the MDC ranged from 14.5% to 26.0%,23 
86 
indicating that a large individual change is needed to be detected. However, in the present study the 
87 
comparison is on the group level, and the MDC at group level is lower, and relates to the N. 
88 
 
89 
Clinical implications and future directions 
90 
As shown in the present study, the FIFA 11+ program does not include exercises targeting eccentric 
91 
hip adduction strength. There was no change in the group using the standard FIFA 11+ program for 8 
92 
weeks. The increase in eccentric hip adduction strength for players performing the CA exercise 
93 
reported in the present study is slightly lower than the reported increase in hamstring strength when 
94 
performing the NH protocol described by Mjølsnes et al.18 This protocol has been demonstrated to 
95 
substantially decrease the risk of hamstring injuries and re-injuries in soccer.1,24,31 Thus, we believe 
96 
that the hip adduction strength increase in the present study is clinically meaningful and the 
97 
preventive effect on groin injuries by adding the CA exercise to the FIFA 11+ should be investigated. 
98 
 
99 
Silvers-Granelli et al. have shown that the FIFA 11+ warm-up program reduced the risk for groin 
100 
injuries in soccer players.28 Although this results questions the need for an update of the FIFA 11+, it 
101 
seems reasonable to include an exercise specifically targeting hip adduction strength. As shown in 
102 
hamstring injury research, the NH exercise is performed eccentrically to match the deceleration 
103 
phase of the leg during sprinting, in the position where hamstring injuries occur.5,6 In a similar way 
104 
the strength increase induced by the CA exercise might match the groin injury mechanism. A recent 
105 
study examining acute groin injuries in sports showed that kicking and change of direction was the 
106 
 19 
 
most frequent injury mechanism for soccer players27 and it may be hypothesized that the adductor 
107 
longus is at greatest risk of injury when muscle activity and rate of stretching are maximal in the 
108 
swing phase of the kick.3 We also know that adductor-related groin pain is most frequent groin injury 
109 
in soccer.9,11,14,27 Optimizing the length-tension relationship using an exercise that includes heavy 
110 
eccentric training therefore seems relevant to prevent adductor injuries. 
111 
 
112 
CONCLUSION 
113 
Including the CA exercise in the FIFA 11+ program increased eccentric hip adduction strength, while 
114 
the standard FIFA 11+ program did not. Since decreased hip adduction strength is a risk factor for 
115 
developing groin injuries, the CA exercise could be included in the 11+ to potentially increasing the 
116 
preventive effect on groin injuries.
