Abstract
Although Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is often asymptomatic, in some cases, it can lead to birth defects in newborns or serious
neurologic complications in adults. However, little is known about the interplay between immune and neural cells that could
contribute to the ZIKV pathology. To understand the mechanisms at play during infection and the antiviral immune
response, we focused on neural precursor cells (NPCs)-microglia interactions. Our data indicate that human microglia
infected with the current circulating Brazilian ZIKV induces a similar pro-inflammatory response found in ZIKV-infected
human tissues. Importantly, using our model, we show that microglia interact with ZIKV-infected NPCs and further spread
the virus. Finally, we show that Sofosbuvir, an FDA-approved drug for Hepatitis C, blocked viral infection in NPCs and there-
fore the transmission of the virus from microglia to NPCs. Thus, our model provides a new tool for studying neuro-immune
interactions and a platform to test new therapeutic drugs.
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus
first described in 1947 in Uganda during blood analyses of senti-
nel Rhesus monkeys (1). Until the 21st century, African and Asian
lineages of ZIKV did not cause substantial human infections.
However, in 2007, vectored by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the first
noteworthy epidemic of ZIKV occurred on the island of Yap in
Micronesia (2). The recent dramatic increase in newborns with
microcephaly and other congenital malformations in Brazil has

 been associated with an outbreak of ZIKV (3,4). The outbreak has
further been linked to the autoimmune neurological disorder
Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (GBS) in older children and adults (5).
The circulating Asian-lineage strain of ZIKV in Brazil (ZIKVBR) has
been detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid of women with
microcephalic fetuses (6–8) and in the blood of microcephalic
newborns. Curiously, although the African MR-766 strain of ZIKV
(ZIKVMR766, strain MR-766) was first identified in the 1950s, no
birth defects in newborns or neurological complications in adults
have been associated with this strain. Thus, recent publications
focused on the mechanisms of transmission and spreading of
ZIKV in the Americas (9–12).
Earlier this year, Liu and colleagues reported that ZIKV
evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 (A188V
mutation) domain leading to increased antigenaemia (12). This
enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia promoted ZIKV infectivity
and prevalence in mosquitoes that could ease the transmission
and possibly explain the recent ZIKV outbreaks. Following this
publication, another group suggested that the A188V mutation
on NS1 domain arose in Southeast Asia at the early 2000s and
circulated in that region several years before spreading to South
Pacific Islands and the Americas (13). Moreover, there is now
converging evidence that the African strains lead to higher
infection rate and viral production as well as stronger cell
death in cellular and immunocompetent adult mouse models
leading to the increased mortality while the Asian strains did
not (14–16). This feature of the Asian strain might be responsible
for causing chronic infections observed in congenital microce-
phaly cases and explain why no other diseases were observed
until recently. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop model
systems to examine the complex relationship between ZIKVBR
infection and brain malformations.
In order to model ZIKVBR infectivity, we previously showed
that ZIKVBR crosses the placenta to infect the fetus in vivo, causing
microcephaly and birth defects (17). In addition, we showed that
ZIKVBR targeted human neural precursor cells (NPCs), growing as
neurospheres or organoids, induced cell death and led to a reduc-
tion of proliferative zones and a disruption of cortical layers as
previously observed in vivo (17). Despite advances regarding the
causal relationship between the ZIKVBR and birth defects, little is
known about the pathogenic interactions of this virus with differ-
ent cell types and its vertical transmission to fetal brain.
Since the onset of the current Brazilian outbreak in 2015,
most ZIKV studies have focused on neurons and glial cells
(17,18). However, further examination of ZIKV interaction with
fetal circulating monocytes and the interplay between microglia
and neural cells are important steps for understanding ZIKV
pathophysiology. A recent publication, using the contemporary
ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (PR2015), showed that the virus can
infect and replicate in Hofbauer cells (HCs), a type of primary
human placental macrophage (19). Hence, one possibility for
intrauterine transmission allowing ZIKV to gain access to the
fetal compartment is by direct infection of cells comprising the
placental barrier (19). Yolk sac macrophages invade the brain
parenchyma through the blood vessels during embryogenesis
to become resident macrophages of the central nervous system
(CNS), microglia (20). Considering the timing during embryogen-
esis of the entry of myeloid precursors, we hypothesized that
microglia could also actively participate during ZIKV infection,
perhaps acting as a Trojan horse by transporting the ZIKV dur-
ing CNS invasion (21). Thus, in this study, using a ZIKV strain
isolated from a clinical case in northeast of Brazil (17), ZIKVBR,
we aimed to mimic those early interactions between NPCs and
macrophage/microglia.
Here,
we
used
human-induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(hiPSCs) to model immune interactions in the developing central
nervous system of the fetal brain during ZIKV infection by gener-
ating human macrophages/microglia and NPCs from the same
healthy donor. Then, we established a co-culture system to
model the cellular interplay that naturally occurs in the develop-
ing human brain. Our data reveal that a similar immune
response was elicited in developing human microglia upon
infection with the ZIKVBR as was found in the humoral immune
response present in ZIKV-infected human tissues (22–25). Upon
co-culture, microglia interacted with ZIKVBR-infected NPCs. Our
data further show that ZIKV-infected macrophages/microglia
transmit the virus to naı
¨ve NPCs, increasing the apoptosis of
NPCs. These results imply that during embryogenesis, myeloid
precursors could be responsible for ZIKV transmission to the
CNS during their normal process of brain invasion. Finally, we
tested Sofosbuvir (SOF), an FDA-approved drug against Hepatitis
C infection, previously tested against ZIKV (26–28), and showed
that SOF was able to decrease the cell death of ZIKV-infected
NPCs. Our findings reveal that human microglia are profoundly
influenced by their microenvironment and can sense ZIKV-
infected
cells
in
their
immediate
surroundings,
providing
insights on the mechanism of infection. Thus, our co-culture
system could be used for studying neuro-immune interactions
in vitro and testing new therapeutic candidates against ZIKV.
Results
Characterization of hiPSC-derived macrophage/
microglia (MU)
To understand the immune component of neurologic abnor-
malities observed in ZIKV-infected newborns, we first generated
MU
from
hiPSCs
using
an
edited
version
by
Douvaras
and
colleagues
of
the
previously
published
protocol
by
Yanagimachi et al. (29,30). This serum-free, feeder-free method
gave rise to CD14þ monocytes, precursors of MU, in suspension
starting at 15 days in vitro. CD14þ cells were then sorted using
magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system, treated with M-
CSF and IL-34 for a week as previously published (29), and used
in the subsequent experiments (Supplementary Material, Fig.
S1A). These monocytes expressed classical MU markers such as
Iba1 and CD68 (Fig. 1A). The analysis of the cells in suspension,
prior to CD14 sorting, revealed that they expressed monocyte,
macrophage and myeloid cell markers such as CD45/CD14,
CD14/HLA-DRDPDQ,
CD14/CD11b
and
CD14/CD68,
(Fig.
1C,
Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B). One week after sorting,
CD14þ cells established a homogeneous macrophage popula-
tion (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1C) and had similar cellular
morphology and expression of cell markers such as CD68 and
Iba1 to blood monocyte-derived macrophages (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S1C and D). We next assessed whether the MU
were functional by measuring their capacity for phagocytosis
(Fig. 1B). In a classical assay (31–33), hiPSC-derived MU engulfed
the yeast particle zymosan (Fig. 1B). The MU were also able to
phagocytose living cells of the leading neonatal bacterial patho-
gen group B Streptococcus (GBS) whereas hiPSC-derived NPCs or
4-week-old neurons did not internalize the bacterium (Fig. 1B);
primary human neutrophils were used as positive control of
phagocytosis. In addition, we measured cytokine (IL-6, IL-1b,
IL12/IL23p40), chemokine (MIP1a, MIP1b, RANTES, Fractalkine,
IL8 and IP10) and the growth factor G-CSF release by hiPSC-
derived MU after activating them with the classical pro-

 Immune response of macrophages/microglia (MU) upon
infection with the ZIKV
Next, we studied the immune response of MU upon infection
with ZIKVBR as well as with ZIKVMR766, a lab-adapted, highly
in vitro passaged African MR766 strain, presumably different
from the circulating African strain at 12 and 24 h post-infection
(p.i) (Supplementary Material, Fig S2A and B). We selected a
panel of potential virus entry receptor candidates based on
recent publications including AXL, TIM, TYRO3, MER and several
TLR receptors previously linked to ZIKV and arboviruses such as
DENV (32,33,39); TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, to measure the expression
levels by qRT-PCR (17,18,35,36). At 12h p.i., we did not observe
any significant changes between the strains when compared
with mock-infected samples (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A).
At 24 h p.i., both strains of the virus triggered a TLR7 up-
regulation and only ZIKVMR766 -infected MU expressed higher
levels of the MER receptor when compared with mock-infected
conditions (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B). Next, we used a
lower MOI aiming to mimic the ZIKV infection in vivo and to
unveil the most sensitive changes without inducing a dramatic
inflammatory response that could mask small and strain-
specific changes (37–41). Thus, these ranges of MOIs and 24h p.i.
time point were used in the subsequent experiments (Fig. 1E
and F).
TYRO3 and AXL were upregulated upon the ZIKVBR infection,
with AXL gene
expression increased by three-fold compared
with the mock-infected MU (Fig. 1E). In contrast, expression of
MER and TIM did not differ between ZIKVBR-infected and mock-
infected MU (Fig. 1E). As for the TLR receptors expression, we
focused on three relevant for our study: TLR3, a sensor of RNA
viruses, which was recently linked to ZIKV infection (35); TLR4,
which plays a central role in recognition of LPS from Gram-
negative bacteria, which was previously shown to be upregu-
lated in ZIKV-infected human neurospheres (36); and TLR7, a
sensor of ssRNA involved in the detection of other arboviruses
such as DENV (42). Surprisingly, all were downregulated when
compared with mock-infected controls (Fig. 1E). Interestingly,
the corresponding changes seen in AXL, TYRO3, and TLR7 gene
expression upon infection with the ZIKVBR were absent in paral-
lel infections with the ZIKVMR766, which did not differ from
mock-infected MU in expression of all three receptor genes
(Fig. 1E).
The geographic and symptomatology overlap between ZIKV
and other Flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) initially compli-
cated diagnosis (42). The vector by which it is propagated (Aedes
aegypti) is shared by both viruses and clinically presented sero-
logical cross-reactivity. In addition, DENV is known to target pri-
mary blood cells such as monocytes and macrophages and
induces an inflammatory response (42). Thus, we next meas-
ured the expression of genes encoding three receptors described
for DENV infection: CLEC5A, CD209/DC-SIGN, and CD206/MRC1
(Fig. 1F). All three viral receptors, CLEC5A, CD209/DC-SIGN, and
CD206/MRC1, were downregulated in ZIKVBR or ZIKVMR766-
infected MU compared with mock-infected MU, suggesting that
ZIKV does not implicate these DENV-related receptors in iPSCs-
derived MU (Fig. 1F).
Next, we studied the expression of the MU markers such as
AIF1/Iba1, CD68, and ITGAM/CD11b by qRT-PCR upon infection
with the ZIKV strains. AIF1/Iba1 expression was increased in
the MU infected with ZIKVBR compared with the mock-infected
or ZIKVMR766-infected cells, whereas similar changes in CD68
expression
did not
achieve
statistic
significance
(Fig.
1F).
Notably, pro-inflammatory genes encoding IL6, IL1B, and CCR5
were markedly induced upon infection by the ZIKVBR, but not
ZIKVMR766. In contrast, the MU marker ITGAM/CD11b and the
anti-inflammatory factor IGF1 were decreased by infections
with either ZIKV strain, whereas expression of CYBB/NOX2
remained unchanged upon infection with the viruses (Fig. 1F).
These results indicate that the inflammatory response of MU
infected with two different ZIKV strains at the same viral MOI
elicited different inflammatory responses.
We next compared cytokine/chemokine release by the
hiPSC-derived MU 24 h p.i. with the ZIKVBR or ZIKVMR766, (Fig.
1G, Supplementary Material, Fig. S4) using the same multiplex
cytometric bead array that was used previously (Fig. 1D,
Supplementary Material, Fig. S1E). Using several inocula of virus
(MOI ¼ 0.05, MOI ¼ 0.01 and MOI ¼ 0.001), we detected changes in
release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (Fig.
1G, Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B and C). MU release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL12/IL23p40, IL1b, IL10 and the growth
factor G-CSF was significantly higher in response to ZIKVBR
compared with ZIKVMR766 infection; whereas MIP1b, RANTES,
IP-10, IL6, and MIP1a release from ZIKV-infected MU were com-
parable between the two strains (Fig. 1G, Supplementary
Material, Fig. S4B and C), arguing for a ZIKVBR-specific response
by the hiPSC-derived MU.
Differential expression of TAM/TIM and TLR receptors in
human NPCs
Human NPCs were shown to be targeted by ZIKVBR (17). Similar
to MU, we first infected NPCs at an MOI of 0.1 with either strains
and studied the expression of different viral entry receptors at
12 and 24 h p.i. by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2C
and D), however, we did not detect any differences between the
two different strains at 12h p.i. (Supplementary Material, Fig.
S2C). At 24h p.i., TYRO3 and TLR4 were both upregulated in NPCs
upon
infection
with
both
ZIKVBR
and
ZIKVMR766
strains
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S2D). Given that we did not see
major differences in gene expression in both of the strains
tested, we focused on the same MOI (0.001) determined from
the MU expression analysis and the time points (24 and 96 h
p.i.) (Fig. 1A and B, Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A and B) for
the NPCs (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A and B). Of four
receptors analysed, only the MER was increased in the ZIKVBR
24 h p.i. compared with mock but returned to mock levels by 96
h p.i. (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A). Expression of TYRO3
was downregulated in both mock- and ZIKVBR-infected NPCs at
96 h p.i. compared with 24 h p.i. (Supplementary Material, Fig.
S3A). TLR4 was also decreased as in MU, while TLR7 expression
was increased compared with the mock-infected controls at
24 h p.i. (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3B). The expression of
TAM/TIM receptors and TLRs observed in NPCs at 96 h p.i. were
accompanied by a decreased expression of cell markers such as
NES/Nestin and PAX6 in both mock- and ZIKVBR-infected NPCs
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C).
To summarize, we did not observe great changes in ZIKVBR-
infected NPCs except for MER and TLR7, which were significantly
upregulated compared with the mock-infected NPCs at 24-h
post-infection.

or ZIKVMR766, media replaced, and MU overlaid 2 h after the
media change. MU and NPCs were maintained in co-culture for

(TUNEL)
(Fig.

and
B,
Supplementary Material, Fig. S5). We initially seeded the same
amount of MU and NPCs, however, the proliferation rate of the
NPCs was higher and thus the percentage of MU in the co-
culture with NPCs was around 2% at 96 h p.i. (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S5C). In the absence of infection, addition of MU in
co-culture atop NPCs did not influence the number of TUNELþ
cells (�10%, see Fig. 2C). However, as previously shown (17),
ZIKVBR infection at MOI ¼ 0.1 doubled the percentage of TUNELþ
NPCs (Fig. 2B and C). No increase in TUNELþ was detected
in
NPCs
infected
with
ZIKVBR
at
MOI ¼ 0.01
for
96
h (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A). Infection with ZIKVMR766
had similar effect by increasing the amount of TUNELþ NPCs
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B). In addition, the amount of
MU undergoing apoptosis (TUNELþ) remained under �5% in
presence or absence of ZIKVBR indicating that the ZIKVBR was
not cytotoxic to MU under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2B
and C, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5D). Interestingly, adding
MU to ZIKV-infected NPCs reduced the percentage of TUNELþ
cell
levels
similar
to
mock-infection
(Fig.
2B
and
C,
Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B). Thus, while adding naı
¨ve MU
to uninfected NPCs did not increase cell death, infection of
NPCs with the ZIKVBR increased cell death, and the presence of
MU reduced cell death in ZIKVBR-infected NPCs (Fig. 2B and C).
To elucidate the mechanism by which MU presence could
decrease TUNELþ ZIKVBR-infected NPCs, whether it is through
phagocytosis or through protection by release of neurotrophic
factors by MU, we used conditioned media (CM) from mock or
ZIKVBR- infected MU and added on top of NPCs (Fig. 2D). Mock
MU CM did not have any effect on the basal level of apoptosis in
mock-infected NPCs whereas ZIKVBR MU CM addition tended to
increase the level of TUNELþ NPCs (Fig. 2D). Although the addi-
tion of mock or ZIKVBR MU CM on top of ZIKVBR-infected NPCs
had a small tendency to decrease the amount of TUNELþ cells,
there was no statistically significant change compared with
ZIKVBR-infected NPCs in the absence of any CM (Fig. 2D). Thus,
MU most likely need to be in contact with NPCs to decrease the
amount of TUNELþ NPCs, most likely by phagocytosing the
apoptotic cells.
Finally, to assess whether ZIKV-infected MU could transmit
the virus to the NPCs, we first infected MU with ZIKV (ZIKVBR or
ZIKVMR766, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5), washed and added
on top of NPCs the next day (Fig. 2E). We co-cultured ZIKV-
infected MU with NPCs for 96 h and analysed the amount of
TUNELþ cells (Fig. 2E and F, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5E).
Importantly, upon addition of ZIKV-infected MU on top of NPCs,
the amount of TUNELþ cells increased significantly (Fig. 2F and
G, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5E). Keeping in mind that MU
represent around 2% of the cells in total (Supplementary
Material, Fig. S5C) and that ZIKV infection did not increase the
MU
in
apoptosis
(Supplementary
Material,
Fig.
S5D),
the
increase in TUNEL can be attributed to the increase of cell death
of NPCs (Fig. 2G, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5E). More impor-
tantly, we tested an FDA-approved drug, SOF, which was
previously shown efficient against ZIKV infection in our model
(26–28).
Next, in a following experiment, we added 20 lM SOF at the
same time as the addition of ZIKV-infected MU on top of unin-
fected NPCs (Fig. 2E, G and H, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5E
and F). Importantly, addition of SOF decreased significantly the
amount of TUNELþ cells in the case of ZIKVBR-infected MU addi-
tion (Fig. 2F and G) and showed a tendency to decrease upon
infection with ZIKVMR766-infected MU (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S5E). In addition, this decrease was accompanied by a
decrease the amount of the flavivirus NS1þ domain specific
staining, suggesting that SOF was able to limit the ZIKVBR repli-
cation (Fig. 2F–H). As for the MR766, SOF had only a tendency to
decrease the amount of NS1þ cells (Supplementary Material,
Fig. S5F). Thus, SOF was able to block the increased cell death of
NPCs due to the infection by ZIKV-infected MU.
Altogether, our model was able to mimic neuro-immune
interactions, which is likely to occur during human neurodevel-
opment and was proven to be useful for testing new therapeutic
drugs to block ZIKV-associated phenotypes.
Discussion
In this study, we modeled immune interactions between NPCs
and macrophages/microglia (MU) that would occur in the devel-
oping brains of the ZIKVBR-infected fetuses/newborns, using an
induced pluripotent stem cell experimental platform. A funda-
mental strength of induced pluripotent stem cells is the possi-
bility of deriving different cell types from individuals in vitro.
Generation of MU using this technology will circumvent the
need for MHC-matched bone marrow-derived MU from a
healthy donor. In addition, by generating NPCs and MU from the
same donor, we established an autologous approach to the
study of immune interactions between different cell types
derived from the same genetic background. The novelty of our
study relies on the establishment of an in vitro platform, able to
mimic human neuro-immune interactions. In particular, these
interactions in human cells were studied by co-culturing hiPSC-
derived NPCs together with hiPSC-derived MU. To our knowl-
edge this is the first study enabling the analysis of human
neuro-immune interactions, unlike the studies using 3D orga-
noids, where the mesoderm-derived immune cells such as MU
of the central nervous system are lacking, which is a major limi-
tation of this technology (17,35,43–45). Thus, we strongly believe
that our platform could be further used in other studies impli-
cating MU to model the interplay among the different cell types
and their impact on neurodevelopmental diseases.
In this study, using low MOI infections to mimic the ZIKV
infection in vivo, we analysed the cytokine and immune recep-
tor responses to infections with the ZIKVBR or ZIKVMR766 strains.
We then investigated cellular receptors implicated in ZIKV cell
entry in developing human MU, beginning with C-type lectin
receptors known to bind DENV on the surface of macrophages
and dendritic cells and modulate inflammatory responses
(42,46). Unlike in DENV infections, CLEC5A, CD209/DC-SIGN and
CD206/MRC1
all
had
reduced
expression
in
ZIKVBR
and
ZIKVMR766-infected MU compared with controls (42,46). TAM/
TIM receptors and TLRs have been recently implicated in ZIKV
infection (18,35). We found that MU and NPCs had differential
expressions of the genes encoding these receptors upon infec-
tion with ZIKVBR: TYRO3 and AXL were upregulated in MU
infected with ZIKVBR unlike NPC, which had only an upregula-
tion of MER, suggesting that AXL does not have a central role in
ZIKV infections in NPCs. Indeed, several publications focused
on AXL receptors over the last year since it was suggested as a
potential viral entry receptor (18), however, two independent
studies showed that blocking AXL does not prevent ZIKV infec-
tion of NPCs (46,47). But a recent publication claims that selec-
tive
expression
of
Musashi
in
NPCs
could
explain

 increased vulnerability to ZIKV (48). In the future, experiments
such as RNAseq on ZIKV-infected MU and NPCs could be more
informative to comprehend mechanisms underlying ZIKV-
infections. Thus, more research is needed to unveil the different
mechanisms underlying ZIKV infection of immune and neural
cells.
Regarding TLR receptors, we show that all three TLRs, TLR3,
TLR4 and TLR7 were downregulated in ZIKVBR-infected MU. On
closer examination of the inflammatory response, we showed
that ZIKVBR-infected MU expressed higher levels of AIF1, IL6,
IL1b and CCR5 and released higher levels of IL12/IL23p40, IL1b,
IL10 and G-CSF upon infection with ZIKVBR but not with
ZIKVMR766 suggesting that the Brazilian strain might induce a
distinct inflammatory response at lower MOIs. In line with this,
a recent publication showed that the Asian-lineage ZIKV infec-
tion of pregnant women‘s blood led CD14þ monocytes to a M2
phenotype, with a notable increase in IL-10 production (49), sug-
gesting that our ZIKVBR-infected MU can, at least partially, reca-
pitulate
the
strain-specific
features
of
ZIKV
infection.
Noteworthy, as stated previously, the African strain MR766 of
the ZIKV has been passaged multiple times in vitro, hence the
differences seen in inflammatory response could be attributed
to the artificial nature of MR-766 strain (50). Thus, this platform
could be used to distinguish subtle differences between the sev-
eral viruses. Interestingly, Manangeeswaran and colleagues
found increased levels of IL1b in the CNS of IFNAR KO mice
upon infection with an Asian strain of the ZIKV (24). Another
study investigating the cytokine kinetics upon ZIKV infection of
travelers from Thailand, Tahiti, Malaysia and Brazil, found also
elevated levels of IL1b and IL10 in the blood (23). A Brazilian
patient who developed with encephalomyelitis upon ZIKV
infection, showed elevated levels of G-CSF in the cerebrospinal
fluid (25). Finally, a recent study that evaluated the humoral
response during ZIKV infection in the amniotic fluid of ZIKV-
positive pregnant women with neonatal microcephaly reported
elevated IP-10, IL6, IL8, MCP-1 and G-CSF (22). Altogether, we
show that the Brazilian ZIKV-induced similar inflammatory
response by hiPSC-derived MU, thus resembling the immune
activation observed in patients, including pregnant women
infected with ZIKV. Therefore, hiPSC-derived MU could be used
as potential targets for drug development.
Finally, in order to mimic the immune interactions occurring
between macrophages of the central nervous system, microglia,
and NPCs in the fetal brain during ZIKV infection, we derived
hiPSC-derived MU and NPCs from the same donor. We then
established a co-culture system to study the multi-cellular
interactions that will occur during infection, such as between
naı
¨ve MU and ZIKVBR-infected NPCs. In our co-culture system,
we sought to mimic the microglia percentage in vivo which in
mouse cortex is around 5% (51–54). In our experiments, we
obtained 2% MU after 96 h of co-culture both in ZIKVBR or mock-
infection conditions, similar to the percentage of microglia
found in vivo (51–54). When we added naı
¨ve MU to infected
NPCs, the percentage of dying NPCs decreased significantly.
Moreover, by using conditioned media from mock or ZIKVBR-
infected MU, we explained our results mechanistically by identi-
fying MU phagocytosis of apoptotic NPCs, demonstrating that
hiPSC-derived MU are functional in their ability to recognize
virus-infected cells. Furthermore, we showed that conditioned
media from ZIKVBR-infected MU alone is not sufficient to cause
apoptosis of NPCs in our experimental conditions and that
physical contact is necessary. The MU inflammatory response
to ZIKV infection together with the phagocytosis of ZIKV-
infected NPCs by MU, could contribute to microcephaly in
newborns.
Next, we hypothesized that ZIKV-infected MU could trans-
mit the virus to the NPCs since the timing of microglial CNS
invasion during neurodevelopment corresponds to the timing
of ZIKV antigen detection in placental tissues (20,55). Indeed,
our data show that ZIKV-infected MU transmit ZIKV to NPCs,
increasing apoptosis. Importantly, an FDA-approved drug, SOF,
was able to block the cell death of NPCs in this context.
Finally, one of the classic pathological findings in GBS, which
has been linked to the ZIKV outbreak (5), is inflammatory infil-
trates, mainly T cells and macrophages (56). Thus, our in vitro
model using hiPSC-derived MU could be used to further investi-
gate the inflammatory machinery involved in GBS. Our study
sheds light on the immune implications of ZIKV infection and
might give insights on the risk of developing ZIKV-associated
GBS. Thus, we propose that MU could be a therapeutic target to
limit the virus spreading amongst the most vulnerable and rele-
vant cell types involved in microcephaly, such as NPCs, and
that our co-culture model could be used for drug discovery
against ZIKV infection.
Experimental procedures
Cell culture
hiPSC-derived macrophages/microglia (MU) differentiation pro-
tocol was adapted from (29) and (30). Briefly, iPSCs cell lines
were generated as previously described, by reprogramming
fibroblast from two healthy donors (57). The iPSC colonies were
plated on Matrigel-coated (BD Biosciences) plates and main-
tained in mTESR media (Stem Cell Technologies). The protocol
of myeloid cell lineage consisted of 4 sequential steps. In the
first step, primitive streak cells were induced by BMP4 addition,
which in step 2, were differentiated into hemangioblast-like
hematopoietic precursors [VEGF (80 ng/ml, Peprotech), SCF (100
(bottom right). White arrows point to MU (orange). Scale bar: 20 lm. (C) TUNEL images of NPCs infected with the ZIKVBR (MOI ¼0.1) were acquired, and the percentages
of dying cells were calculated, averaged, and graphed accordingly. One-way ANOVA tests with Tukey multiple comparison were performed to compare different
groups. The presented values are means of TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage 6 SD, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Note that infected NPCs have increased TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage
compared with the mock and the addition of MU decreases TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage. (D) TUNEL images of NPCs infected with the ZIKVBR and treated with mock or
ZIKVBR-infected MU conditioned media (MU CM) (MOI¼0.1) were acquired, and the percentages of apoptotic cells were calculated, averaged, and graphed accordingly.
One-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons tests were performed to compare different groups. The presented values are means of TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage
6 SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (E) Schematic of the experimental design: ZIKV-infected MU are co-cultured with NPCs (I), treated with either vehicle (VEH) or Sofosbuvir (SOF)
(II) for 96 h before quantification of TUNEL and NS1 positive cells. (F) Images of ZIKVBR-infected cells stained with Nestin (green), TUNEL (pink), Iba1 (orange) and DAPI
(blue) (upper), and images of ZIKVBR-infected cells stained with Nestin (green), NS1 (white) and Iba1 (orange) (lower). MU were treated with either VEH (left), or 20lM
SOF (right) after ZIKV-infection and co-cultured with NPCs. White arrows point to MU (orange). Scale bar: 20 lm. (G) TUNEL images of cells infected with the ZIKVBR
(MOI ¼1) were acquired, and the percentages of dying cells were calculated, averaged, and graphed accordingly. One-way ANOVA tests with Tukey multiple compari-
son were performed to compare different groups. The presented values are means of TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage 6 SD, **P < 0.01. Note that MU treated with SOF and co-
cultured infected NPCs have decreased TUNELþ/DAPIþ percentage compared with the vehicle (VEH). (H) NS1 images were acquired, and the percentages of NS1 positive
cells were calculated, averaged, and graphed accordingly. One-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons tests were performed to compare different groups. The
presented values are means of NS1þ/DAPIþ percentage 6 SD, *P < 0.05.

 ng/ml, Gemini) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), (25 ng/
ml, Life Technologies)]. Then, in the third step, the hemato-
poietic precursors were pushed towards myeloid differentiation
[FLT-3 ligand (50 ng/ml, HumanZyme), IL-3 (50 ng/ml, Gemini),
SCF (50 ng/ml, Gemini), Thrombopoietin, TPO (5 ng/ml), M-CSF
(50 ng/ml)] and finally into the monocytic lineage in step 4
[FLT3-ligand (50 ng/ml), M-CSF (50ng/ml), GM-CSF (25 ng/ml)].
Cells produced in suspension in step 4 were recovered, sorted
by using anti-CD14 magnetic microbeads (MACS, Miltenyi),
treated with 50ng/ml M-CSF and 50ng/ml IL-34 for a week before
being used in different experiments.
Monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from the
peripheral blood of a healthy donor as previously described (34).
PBMCs were isolated from the blood by density gradient centri-
fugation. CD14þ monocytes were then purified by MACS using
CD14 microbeads.
For the generation of NPCs, cell were differentiated and
maintained as previously described (57–59). Two iPSCs lines
obtained from healthy patients maintained in mTSER media
were switched to N2 [DMEM/F12 media supplemented with
1xN2 NeuroPlex Serum-Free Supplement (Gemini) with the dual
SMAD inhibitors 1 lM of dorsomorphin (Tocris) and 10uM of
SB431542 (Stemgent) daily, for 48 h. After two days, colonies
were scraped off and cultured under agitation (95rpm) as
embryoid bodies for seven days using N2 media with dorsomor-
phin and SB431542. Media was changed every other day.
Embryoid bodies were then plated on Matrigel-coated dishes,
and maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.5x of N2
supplement, 0.5x Gem21 NeuroPlex Serum-Free Supplement
(Gemini),
20 ng/ml
basic
fibroblast

factor
(bFGF,
LifeTechnologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). After 7
days in culture, rosettes that arose from the plated EBs were
manually selected, gently dissociated with StemPro Accutase
(LifeTechnologies) and plated onto 10 lg/ml poly-L-ornithine
(Sigma)/5
lg/ml
Laminin-coated
(LifeTechnologies)
plates.
Neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) were maintained in DMEM/F12
with N2, Gem21, bFGF and P/S. The medium was changed every
other day. NPCs were split as soon as confluent, using StemPro
Accutase for 5min at 37 �C, centrifuged and replated with NGF
with a 1: 3 ratio in poly-L-ornithine/Laminin-coated plates.
Virus culture and amplification
Both ZIKVBR and ZIKVMR766 were obtained and amplified as in
(17): lyophilized ZIKVBR, which was isolated from a clinical case
in Brazil, was provided by the Evandro Chagas Institute in
Bele
´m, Para
´ and was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of sterile DEPC
water. The African-lineage MR-766 (ZIKVMR766), a reference
strain isolated in Uganda in 1947, used here as a control, was
provided by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. C6/36 Aedes
albopictus mosquito cells were used to culture both viruses.
The culture medium used for C6/36 cells was Leibovitz‘s L-15
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Gemini), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% sodium pyr-
uvate (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycine (Gibco) and 0.05%
amphotericin B (Gibco). The cells were kept at 27 �C. When cells
reached around 70% of confluency, 50ll of viral sample was
added. The cells were subcultured three times before the super-
natant was harvested, titrated and used for experimental
inoculation.
Virus titration
The virus titration was performed as previously described (17).
Briefly, porcine kidney epithelial (PS) cells were used for virus
titration in L15 medium with 5% FBS. Serial dilution ranging
from 10�1 to 10�11 for each virus stock were added onto 24-well
plates, followed by PS cells seeding into each well of a 24-well
plate for 3 h at 37 �C. Next, each well was overlaid with complete
carboxymethyl cellulose medium (0.6% in L15 supplemented
with 3% FBS). Following 5 days of incubation in 37 �C, the plaque
assay was performed using 0.05% crystal violet solution. The
viral dilution was estimated to determine the amount of
infected cells (plaque forming units or PFU.ml�1).
In vitro infection
NPCs were infected with commercially available ZIKVMR766 (MR-
766, obtained from ATCC) and ZIKVBR, which was isolated from
a febrile case in the state of Paraiba (Brazil-ZKV2015) as previ-
ously described (17). Briefly, NPCs were seeded in 24-well,
infected at different MOIs for an hour at 37 �C, then were
washed and their media was changed. For NPC and MU, both of
the viruses were used at MOIs of 0.001 for RNA, 0.001, 0.01 and
0.05 for CBA experiments, 0.1 for the first co-culture experiment
and MOI of 1 for the second co-culture experiment.
Cytometric bead array (CBA)
The bead-based immunoassay was performed following manu-
facturer‘s instructions (BD Biosciences). Briefly, iPSCs-derived
MU or monocyte-derived macrophages were seeded at a density
of 5x104 cells/well. Media was conditioned with or without 1lg/
ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS, Sigma Aldrich) for 24–30h. 50ll of
conditioned media per sample were analysed by CBA. A cus-
tomized array of cytokines and chemokines were measured in
the conditioned media, including IL1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL12/
23p40, G-CSF, IP10, sCD14, RANTES, Fractalkine, MIP1a, MIP1b
and MCP1, using a BD fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
Canto II instrument followed by an analysis on FCAP Array soft-
ware (BD Biosciences).
Phagocytosis assay
For
internalization
experiments,
hiPSCs-derived
MU
were
seeded to 2 x104 cells per well. Human neutrophils (PMNs), used
as positive controls, were isolated from healthy donors using
PolyMorphPrep (Axis-Shield) in accordance with the University
of California, San Diego, (UCSD) Human Research Protections
Program, and seeded to 2 x104 cells per well.
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strain COH1 was grown over-
night at 37 �C in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco), diluted in PBS to
MOI ¼ 10, and spun onto cell 167 g for 3 min. After 90 min, the
media was supplemented with 100mg/ml gentamicin to kill
extracellular bacteria. After 30 min, the cells were washed 1x in
PBS and lysed with 0.05% Triton-X100 (Sigma) for dilution plat-
ing and CFU enumeration on Todd-Hewitt agar plates (Difco).
Co-culture assay
For the first co-culture experiment, 2 � 104 NPCs per well of a
96-well plate were plated 24 h prior to the ZIKV infection. After
ZIKV infection for an hour at 37 �C, cells were washed and fresh
media was added. Two hours later, 2 � 104 naı
¨ve hiPSCs-derived
MU per well were plated on top of the NPCs. Cells were fixed 96
h post-infection for further analysis with 4% paraformaldehyde,
for 20 min at room temperature. For the second co-culture
experiment, 2 � 104 NPCs were plated. MU were infected at an
MOI of 1 for an hour at 37 �C and the media was changed. The
next day, MU were lifted off by adding accutase for 5 min,
washed with PBS and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The cells

 were counted and 2 � 104 cells/well of MU were added onto
NPCs with 20 lM of SOF (Acme Bioscience AB3793) or vehicle
(DMSO). The dose of 20lM of SOF used on NPCs was optimized
in our laboratory (Mesci et al. manuscript in revision). The cells
were fixed after 96 h of incubation. For mock controls, the same
volume of supernatant was added to each experiment.
Imaging analyses
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room
temperature. Next, samples were permeabilized in 1x-PBS con-
taining 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were next incu-
bated with blocking solution [1% fetal bovine serum, (Life
Technologies) in 1xPBS]. After 1 h, the primary antibody was
added (diluted in blocking solution) and samples were incu-
bated overnight at 4 �C. Slides were then washed two times with
1x-PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min
at 4 �C. Secondary antibodies (all conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488,
555 and 647) were purchased from Life Technologies and used
at a 1: 1000 dilution. After the 30 min incubation, samples were
washed twice (1x-PBS), incubated for 5 min with and fluorescent
nuclear DAPI stain, and mounted with Prolong gold anti-fade
reagent (Life Technologies). Samples were imaged using an Axio
Observer Z1 Microscope with ApoTome (Zeiss). Captured images
were analysed with Zen software from Zeiss. Antibodies and
dilutions used: Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human CD68, (1: 500,
Dako); Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Iba-1, (1: 500, Wako). For TUNEL
analysis, NPCs were plated, infected after 24 h, and fixed 96 h p.i
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Samples were permeabi-
lized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and stained for frag-
mented DNA using TUNEL (Click-iT TUNEL 647 assay kit from
Life Technologies). The cells were then blocked 1% bovine
serum albumin for 60 min. Cells were incubated in primary anti-
bodies: Monoclonal Mouse Nestin, Polyclonal anti-Chicken or
Polyclonal Rabbit Nestin (1: 500, Abcam); Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-
Iba-1, (1: 500, Wako) and monoclonal mouse NS1 (1: 250,
Millipore) overnight at 4 �C and stained with secondary antibod-
ies conjugated to Alexa Fluor and DAPI the following day prior
to mounting. Images were blindly collected using an Axio
Observer Z1 Microscope with ApoTome (Zeiss) and blindly ana-
lysed with ImageJ software.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses
Using previously mentioned protocol to generate monocytes/
macrophages (29), we have collected the cells in the superna-
tant at the step 4 and labeled them with the appropriate
antibodies (CD45 BV786, CD14 PE, CD11b APC, CD68 PE-Cy7,
HLA-DRDPDQ FITC all from BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were
harvested and counted, then washed twice with the stain buf-
fer, containing PBS and 1% heat inactivated FBS, at 300g for 5
min. The antibodies were added in the cell mixture and incu-
bated in RT in the dark for 20–30 min. The cells were then
washed twice with the stain buffer. The cells were resuspended
in 500 ll stain buffer and the viability dye, 7-AAD was added.
The data were acquired in BD LSRFORTESSA instrument and the
plots were generated using the software FlowJo.
RNA extraction and expression analyses by qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Micro and
Mini kit for iPSC-derived MU and NPCs respectively (Qiagen), fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Next, 900 ng of total RNA
was treated RNase-free DNaseI (Qiagen), and was reverse tran-
scribed using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
Approximately, 15 ng of cDNAs was used per reaction and PCRs
were carried out in a final volume of 10 ll. Triplicate samples
were analysed in a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-rad) using iQTM SYBR
V
R Green Supermix (Bio-rad).
GADPH was used as internal normalization control. For the
complete list of primers, please refer to Table 1. The run method
was as follows: 3min at 95 �C, 40 cycles of 10s at 95 �C followed
by 30s at 58 �C, and a melting curve was performed to confirm
the identity of the amplified product.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA (if two or more variables)
tests followed by a Tukey or Sidak multiple comparison tests
were used to compare groups and Student’s t-test to compare
means of two groups.
