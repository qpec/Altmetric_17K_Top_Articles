The primary cause of heart failure is the loss of cardiomyocytes in the diseased adult heart.
Previously, we reported that the miR-17-92 cluster plays a key role in cardiomyocyte pro-
liferation. Here, we report that expression of miR-19a/19b, members of the miR-17-92 cluster,
is induced in heart failure patients. We show that intra-cardiac injection of miR-19a/19b
mimics enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation and stimulates cardiac regeneration in
response to myocardial infarction (MI) injury. miR-19a/19b protected the adult heart in two
distinctive phases: an early phase immediately after MI and long-term protection. Genome-
wide transcriptome analysis demonstrates that genes related to the immune response are
repressed by miR-19a/19b. Using an adeno-associated virus approach, we validate that miR-
19a/19b reduces MI-induced cardiac damage and protects cardiac function. Finally, we
confirm the therapeutic potential of miR-19a/19b in protecting cardiac function by systemi-
cally delivering miR-19a/19b into mice post-MI. Our study establishes miR-19a/19b as
potential therapeutic targets to treat heart failure.

uring heart development, the specification of cardiac
progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes, their proliferation
and differentiation, and ultimately the maturation of
terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes is a complicated process
dictated by the genetic blueprint and orchestrated by regulatory
networks involving transcriptional and epigenetic control of gene
expression. It is generally believed that terminally differentiated
cardiomyocytes in adult mammalian hearts have exited the cell
cycle and have lost the ability to proliferate1. As a result, adult
hearts fail to regenerate themselves upon myocardial infarction
(MI) (also referred to as heart attack) in which massive numbers
of cardiomyocytes are lost2. Despite numerous efforts in the past
decades to promote cardiovascular health, heart failure following
MI remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in
humans. Interestingly, recent work has begun to reveal that
postnatal mammalian hearts possess the potential for regenera-
tion under a variety of pathophysiological conditions3–6, raising
hope for a therapeutic approach to repair damaged hearts.
microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of ~21–23 nucleotide non-coding
RNAs, have emerged as key regulators of cardiomyocyte pro-
liferation, differentiation, and cardiac function. Previously, func-
tional screening identified many miRNAs that have the potential to
stimulate neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation7. Among them,
has-miR-199a-3p and hsa-miR-590-3p, upon intra-cardiac injec-
tion, were shown to stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and
improve cardiac function in response to MI7. Intriguingly, Aguirre
et al. reported that miR-99/100 and let-7 modulate cardiac
regeneration in zebrafish and mouse; inhibition of these miRNAs
stimulated cardiac regeneration, apparently by enhancing cardio-
myocyte dedifferentiation8,9. In another study, the function of
miRNAs in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart
regeneration was linked to the Hippo/Yap pathway, in which
members of the miR302-367 cluster directly target key components
of the Hippo/Yap pathway10. miR-34a, which was initially
demonstrated to regulate the ageing process, is an important reg-
ulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration
such that inhibition of this miRNA leads to enhanced cardio-
myocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration in response to
MI11. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that a single-dose
intracardiac injection of miR-199a-3p and miR-590-3p mimics was
able to protect cardiac function in response to MI, underscoring
the therapeutic potential of miRNAs in cardiomyopathy12.
The miR-17-92 cluster of miRNAs has been shown to regulate
animal development and cell proliferation13–16. It has also been
shown that individual members of the miR-17-92 cluster play
distinct yet cooperative roles16,17. Using mouse models of genetic
mutation and overexpression, we have previously reported that the
miR-17-92 cluster plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte prolifera-
tion in embryonic, postnatal, and adult hearts. Cardiomyocyte-
specific overexpression of miR-17-92 enhanced cardiomyocyte
proliferation in transgenic mice and protected the heart from MI.
In particular, we showed that miR-19a and miR-19b are necessary
and sufficient for cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro in isolated
neonatal rat cardiomyocytes18. Here, we explore the therapeutic
potential of miR-19a/19b in cardiac regeneration and protection.
We report that intra-cardiac injection or systemic delivery of miR-
19a/19b mimics or using an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)
delivery method to overexpress miR-19a/19b in mouse heart
reduces MI-induced cardiac injury and preserved cardiac function.
Our results suggest that miR-19a/19b could become therapeutic
targets to prevent and treat cardiac disease.
Results
miR-19a/19b is dysregulated in diseased hearts. We examined
the expression of miR-19a/19b and found that these miRNAs are
highly expressed in the hearts of neonatal mice (Fig. 1a). Their
expression levels are decreased in postnatal day 12 mouse hearts
(Fig. 1a), consistent with the view that these miRNAs are involved
in cell proliferation. We further investigated the distribution of
these miRNAs in cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes and
found that miR-19a is enriched in cardiomyocytes of adult mouse
hearts (Fig. 1b).
Next, we studied the expression of miR-19a and miR-19b in
mouse models of cardiomyopathy. The expression of both miR-
19a and miR-19b was increased in the heart 3 days after MI
(Fig. 1c). Two weeks after MI, the expression levels of these
miRNAs had returned to normal; however, their expression level
increased again 4 weeks after MI (Fig. 1d). We then investigated
whether the expression of miR-19a/19b is altered in another
mouse model of cardiac remodeling, transverse aortic constric-
tion (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, we found
that the expression of miR-19a and miR-19b was not changed in
hypertrophic hearts 3 days or 2 weeks after TAC. As a control, we
showed that the expression of miR-21 increased in hypertrophic
hearts (Fig. 1e), consistent with previous reports19,20. These
results indicate that the expression (and function) of these
miRNAs
is
specifically
associated
with
MI,
not
cardiac
hypertrophy.
To investigate clinical relevance, we asked whether the
expression of these miRNAs is altered in the hearts of human
patients with cardiovascular diseases. For this purpose, we
performed qRT-PCR assays and found that the expression levels
of primary transcripts of the miR-17-92 cluster, which includes
miR-19a, were increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (Fig. 1f). As a control,
we confirmed that the expression of cardiomyopathy marker gene
atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was increased in DCM but not
CAD heart samples (Fig. 1f). Together, these results indicate that
the expression of miR-19a and miR-19b is dynamically regulated
in cardiomyopathy.
miR-19a/19b protects the heart from MI. To test the function of
miR-19a/19b in the heart, we directly injected miRNA mimics
into the heart of a mouse model of MI. The left anterior des-
cending (LAD) coronary artery was permanently ligated (LAD-
ligation) in adult mice to create a MI and heart failure model.
miR-19a and miR-19b-1, which share an identical seed sequence,
are two members of the miR-19 family encoded by the miR-17-92
cluster (Fig. 2a). We first tested whether miR-19a and miR-19b
possess similar functions in the heart. miR-19a or miR-19b
mimics were directly injected into the heart (intra-cardiac) at
regions adjacent to the ligation site. Indeed, injection of either
miR-19a or miR-19b mimics preserved cardiac function at 5 days
and at 2, 7, and 9 weeks post-MI (Fig. 2b; Supplementary
Table 1). Injected hearts exhibited reduction of scar size at
2 months after MI (Fig. 2c, d; Supplementary Table 1). Given that
miR-19a and miR-19b have almost identical RNA sequences and
both produce similar cardiac protection in infarcted hearts, we
decided to combine miR-19a and miR-19b in the following
experiments to systematically determine the role of miR-19 in
cardiac function and regeneration.
We next carefully examined the pharmacokinetics of miRNA
mimics after intracardiac injection and MI. We found that most
miRNA mimics appear to be located outside of cell membrane
of cardiomyocytes 2 h after injection; 6 h after injection, they
are located in the cytoplasm, and at 12–24 h they are located in
the whole cell. 48 h after injection, we still detect homogenous
distribution of miRNA mimics in cardiomyocytes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). Increased miR-19a/19b expression was still detected
by qRT-PCR in the heart 4 days after injection. However, no

 increased miR-19a/19b expression was detected 2 months and 1
year later in miR-19a/19b mimic-injected hearts (Fig. 2e). We
systematically analyzed cardiac phenotypes in these miR-19a/
19b mimic-injected mice (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Table 2).
Cardiac function was measured using echocardiography, and we
found that mice injected with miR-19a/19b mimics exhibit
improved cardiac function, as evidenced by preserved fractional
shorting (FS%), when compared with control mimic-injected
mice
(Fig.
2g;

Interestingly,
overexpression of miR-19a/19b also prevented MI-induced
cardiac dilation in these mice (Fig. 2h; Supplementary Table 2).

miR-19a/19b mimics significantly reduced scar formation in

 cardiomyopathy, was reduced 2 months after miR-19a/19b
injection (Fig. 2k). These results indicate that miR-19a/19b
protects the heart from MI.
Early and late cardiac protection by miR-19a/19b. Interestingly,
we observed that miR-19a/19b-mediated cardiac protection
exhibited two apparently distinct phases: an early phase imme-
diately after MI (early) and a later phase (late, or long-term)
(Fig. 3a). More than 50% of mice injected with control miRNA
mimics died within a week after MI, due to heart failure; in
contrast, only about 20% died when miR-19a/19b mimics were
injected (Fig. 3a). A similarly high mortality rate upon MI was
reported previously in a similar study12,21. When we applied less
severe infarction by lowering the ligation position on the LAD
during MI surgery, we observed reduced overall lethality, and
injection of miR-19a/19b mimics still exhibited beneficial effects
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). We examined cardiac function in mice
injected with miR-19a/19b or control mimics at different time
points and found that injection of miR-19a/19b mimics protects
cardiac function at 2–4 weeks and 4 months, when compared
with controls (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 2). Intriguingly, we
observed that one-time injection of miR-19a/19b mimics during
the procedure of LAD ligation was able to preserve cardiac
function up to 12 months after MI (Fig. 3c; Supplementary
Table 2), consistent with a similar recent report showing that
miR-199a-3p and miR-590–3p mimics were able to protect the
heart from MI injury12. Histological analysis revealed that miR-
19a/19b mimic injected hearts displayed reduced infarcted size
(Fig. 3d, e), supporting the view that these miRNAs improved
cardiac function. Given that overexpression of miR-19a/19b
substantially reduced the scar size after MI (Figs. 2i, 3d), we asked
whether the expression of genes related to fibrosis was repressed
by miR-19a/19b. As expected, the expression levels of collagen
genes Col1a1, Col3a1, elastin (ELN), and fibrillin 1 (FBN1) and
transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) were all
reduced in miR-19a/19b mimic-injected hearts (Fig. 3f). Twelve
months after miR-19a/19b injection, we observed decreased
expression of Col3a1, as well as BNP (encoded by Nppb) and β-
MHC (encoded by Myh7) (Fig. 3g).
miR-19a/19b stimulates adult cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Previously, we showed that transgenic overexpression of the miR-
17-92 cluster enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas
genetic deletion of this cluster resulted in a decrease in cardio-
myocyte proliferation in response to MI18. We further showed
that introduction of miR-19a/19b mimics into isolated neonatal
rat ventricle cardiomyocytes (NRVM) was sufficient to induce
their proliferation in vitro18. In order to determine whether miR-
19a/19b mimics in adult mouse hearts are able to activate car-
diomyocyte proliferation, we examined EdU incorporation in
cardiomyocytes in mouse hearts after miR-19a/19b or control
mimic injection and MI. We detected increased EdU+ signal in
cardiomyocytes after miR-19a/19b mimic injection when com-
pared to control (Fig. 4a). Quantification revealed a slight increase
in cardiomyocyte proliferation 4 days after miR-19a/19b injection
(Fig. 4b); this increase became substantial 2 months later (Fig. 4c).
To verify this observation, we examined the expression of
phospho-Histone H3 (pH3) and found a similarly increased
pH3 signal in mouse heart after miR-19a/19b mimic injection
and MI (Fig. 4d). Quantification confirmed the role of miR-19a/
19b in stimulating cardiomyocyte proliferation (Fig. 4e). We
examined the cytokinesis marker Aurora B in control and miR-
19a/19b mimic injected hearts and found that miR-19 induced
the expression of Aurora B in cardiomyocytes (Figure 4f, g),
suggesting the induction of adult cardiomyocyte proliferation by
miR-19. In addition, the expression levels of the cell cycle-related
genes cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin D1 (CCND1), and cyclin-
dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) were all elevated in miR-19a/19b
mimic injected hearts after MI (Fig. 4h).
Next, we dissociated adult cardiomyocytes from hearts 3 weeks
after miR-19a/19b or control mimic injection and MI (Fig. 4I).
Quantification analysis confirmed an increase in total number of
cardiomyocytes in miR-19a/19b mimic injected hearts (Fig. 4j).
We stained isolated adult cardiomyocytes with CONNEXIN 43,
α-ACTININ, and DAPI to determine the integrity and nucleation
status of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4k) and we found that injection of
miR-19a/19b mimics results in an increase of mononuclear
cardiomyocytes and a decrease of binucleated cardiomyocytes
(Fig. 4l). Together, these results demonstrate that miR-19a/19b
stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult hearts in response
to MI.
miR-19a/19b regulates cell death and inflammation pathways.
The early cardiac protection granted by miR-19a/19b immedi-
ately after MI prompted us to test whether miR-19a/19b might
inhibit MI-induced apoptosis and the inflammatory response that
is detrimental to cardiac regeneration. Using TUNEL assay, we
assessed apoptosis in infarcted hearts injected with either miR-
19a/19b or control mimics, and we found a substantial decrease
in TUNEL signals in miR-19a/19b injected hearts (Fig. 5a).
Quantification verified that apoptosis was decreased in both
cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5b) and non-cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5c). This
observation is further supported by the decreased expression of
Bim and Pten, two genes indicated in the apoptosis pathway
(Fig. 5d). Western blot analysis verified that BIM and PTEN
protein levels are decreased in miR-19a/19b injected hearts
(Fig. 5e, f). Interestingly, both Bim1 and Pten genes have pre-
viously been identified as direct targets of miR-19a/19b22,23,
suggesting that miR-19a/19b inhibits apoptosis by directly
repressing apoptosis-related genes. This conclusion is further

 supported by the observation that cleaved caspase 3 levels are
substantially reduced in miR-19a/19b mimic injected hearts
(Fig. 5e, f). However, we did not detect significant differences
between miR-19 and control mimic injected hearts when tri-
phenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was applied to quan-
tify nonviable myocardium, nor did we notice any difference in
cardiac function in these mice 24 h after MI and miRNA mimic
injection (Supplementary Fig. 2).
To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
miR-19a/19b-mediated cardiac protection, we performed next
generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in miR-19a/19b mimic
and control mimic injected heart samples to obtain an unbiased,

 genome-wide view. We examined alterations in gene expression
4 days after MI and miR-19a/19b mimic injection. Compared to
control samples, a total of 544 genes were dysregulated in miR-
19a/19b mimic injected hearts with statistical significance.
Among them, 393 were down-regulated and 151 up-regulated
(Fig. 5g). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes
related to immune response, defense response, and T cell
activation are enriched among the 393 down-regulated genes
(Fig. 5h). Additionally, genes related to extracellular matrix,
collagen network, and integrin signaling pathway are enriched

 among miR-19a/19b down-regulated genes (Fig. 5h). In contrast,
there is no GO term enrichment for the 151 up-regulated genes.
We performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and
verified down-regulated genes, including genes related to immune
response and fibrosis (Fig. 5i). Interestingly, we found that several
genes related to cell death, such as BCL6, PIK3AP1, and XAF1
were also down-regulated in miR-19a/19b mimic-injected hearts
(Fig. 5i). We were also able to verify several up-regulated genes
with statistical significance (Fig. 5i).
The down-regulation of immune response genes in miR-19a/
miR-19b injected hearts prompted us to examine how miR-19
may regulate the immune response upon MI injury. Using the
widely used M1 inflammatory cell markers CD80 and iNOs, we
performed immunostaining of myocardium 48 and 72 h after
MI and found that miR-19a/19b mimic-injected hearts display
a substantial reduction in CD80 and iNOs signals (Fig. 5j, k),
suggesting a reduction in M1-type inflammatory macrophages24–26.
Conversely, the expression level of ARG-1, which marks M2-type
inflammatory macrophages, is higher in miR-19/19b mimic-
injected hearts (Fig. 5l). We confirmed that the expression of
genes related to M1 and M2 phages are regulated by miR-19a/
19b (Fig. 5m). Prior studies indicate that suppressor of cytokine
signaling 1 (SOCS1), a predicted miR-19a/19b target, is critical
for M1-type and M2-type macrophage activation and home-
ostasis26. Indeed, we found that expression levels of both SOCS1
mRNA and protein are reduced in miR-19a/19b mimic-injected
hearts
(Fig. 5n, o). Accordingly, the expression level of
phosphorated STAT3, a SOCS1/3 downstream mediator, was
increased in miR-19a/19b injected hearts (Fig. 5n, o). Given that
the Hippo/Yap pathway has been indicated in the regulation of
cardiomyocyte proliferation, we examined the expression of
members of the Hippo/Yap pathway genes in miR-19a/19b
injected hearts. However, the expression of most of the Hippo/
Yap pathway genes was not altered (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Together, these results clearly demonstrate that reduction of
immune response and cell death plays a key role in miR-19a/
19b-mediated cardiac protection in response to MI.
AAV-delivered miR-19a/19b protects the heart from MI. The
above results from direct injection of miR-19a/19b mimics into
infarcted hearts demonstrate that these miRNAs protect the heart
from MI injury. We sought to apply an independent approach to
further define the function of these miRNAs in the heart. We
used an AAV9 in which the cardiac-specific cTNT promoter has
been incorporated to achieve cardiac-specific overexpression of
miR-19a and miR-19b (AAV9-miR-19a/19b)27,28. An AAV9-
luciferase construct was used as a control (Fig. 6a). We detected
increased miR-19a/19b expression ~72 h after AAV injection, and
the increase became substantial 7 days post injection. Increased
miR-19/19b expression was still detected 3 months after injection
(Fig. 6b). Accordingly, we noticed no difference in cardiac
function between AAV9-19a/19b and control injected hearts at
24 h. However, cardiac function is improved 7 days after AAV9-
miR-19a/19b injection (Fig. 6c, d, Supplementary Table 3). We
observed reductions in the expression of Caspase 3 and Bim after
AAV9-miR-19a/19b injection when compared with the control
group (Supplementary Fig. 4). Overexpression of miR-19a/19b
using AAV9-miR-19a/19b exhibits long-term protection of the
heart from MI-induced injury, as evidenced by preserved cardiac
function at 2 and 3 months post MI (Fig. 6c, d; Supplementary
Table 3) and reduced infarct size (Fig. 6e, f). These results support
what we observed in the miR-19a/19b mimic experiments.
Molecular marker analysis confirmed that AAV9-miR-19a/19b
reduced the expression of cardiomyopathy markers ANF (Nppa),
BNP (Nppb), and β-MHC (Mhy7) (Fig. 6g). We found that
AAV9-miR-19a/19b also reduced the expression of fibrosis
marker genes Col1a1, Col3a1, and TGFBR2 (Fig. 6h). Consistent
with previous report18, we found that the expression levels of
PTEN mRNA and protein, which is a direct miR-19a/19b target,
were reduced in AAV9-miR-19a/19b-injected hearts (Fig. 6i, j, k).
Together, these results confirm the role of miR-19a/19b in cardiac
protection against MI.
Therapeutic potential of miR-19a/19b in infarcted hearts.
Having demonstrated their critical role in cardiac protection in
response to cardiac injury, we next asked whether miR-19a and
miR-19b could serve as potential therapeutic targets to treat
myocardial infarcted hearts. Six hours after MI, we delivered
miR-19a/19b or control mimic formulated with MaxSuppressor
in vivo RNALancerII, a lipid-based delivery reagent via tail vein
injection (Fig. 7a). We carefully examined the expression of miR-
19a/19b in the heart at different time points after injection, and
we found that miR-19a/19b expression was readily detected in the
heart 6 h after injection (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, we did not detect
increased miR-19a/19b expression in control hearts without MI
24 h after injection (Fig. 7c), indicating that MI injury enhanced
the uptake of miR-19a/19b in the heart. We examined cardiac
function after tail vein miR-19a/19b mimic injection and found
that cardiac function in miR-19a/19b mimic injected hearts was
significantly improved compared to controls at 2, 6, 11, and
14 weeks (Fig. 7d, e; Supplementary Table 4). Histological ana-
lysis revealed that miR-19a/19b mimics significantly reduced scar
formation in infarcted hearts (Fig. 7f). Quantification of infarct
size confirmed this observation (Fig. 7g). We examined the

 expression of SOCS1 and phosphorated STAT3 and found
decreased expression of SOCS1 and increased levels of phos-
phorated STAT3 24 h after tail vein injection of miR-19a/19b
(Fig. 7h). To further validate the therapeutic role of miR-19a/19b
in cardiac protection, we utilized Lipofectamine RNAiMAX,
which was recently shown to mediate miRNA delivery effi-
ciently12, to deliver miR-19a/19b mimics via tail vein injection.
Consistent with the findings from RNALancerII-mediated deliv-
ery, RNAiMAX-mediated systemic miR-19a/19b delivery protects
the heart from MI injury, as evidenced by improved cardiac
function and reduction of infarcted scar size (Supplementary
Fig. 5; Supplementary Table 5). Taking together, these data
indicate that miR-19a/19b are effective therapeutic targets for MI-
induced heart failure.

 Discussion
In this study, we established the functional role of miR-19a and
miR-19b in protecting the heart in response to MI. Intra-cardiac
injection of miR-19a/19b mimics in adult mice was sufficient to
preserve cardiac function upon ischemic injury. Most impor-
tantly, systemic delivery of miR-19a/miR-19b mimics in post MI
mice also produces clear cardiac protection. Given their role in
cardiac protection in mouse hearts and the fact that these miR-
NAs are highly conserved between mice and humans, miR-19a
and miR-19b may be uniquely suited to become therapeutic
targets for cardiac regeneration and heart failure.
One of the most exciting findings of this study is that miR-19a/
19b appeared to protect the heart from MI injury in two phases
by targeting distinct biological processes. Consistent with prior
findings, we showed that miR-19a/19b enhanced cardiomyocyte
proliferation in response to cardiac injury. Interestingly, direct
injection of miR-19a/19b mimics or AAV9-miR-19a/19b into
infarcted hearts reduced MI-induced cell death, preserving car-
diac function and increasing survival. Mechanistically, our results
indicate that miR-19a/miR-19b protects the heart in the early
stage of heart attack by repressing the immune response in the
heart. Given that recent evidence supports the critical involve-
ment of inflammation and immune responses in cardiac protec-
tion in response to injury and remodeling, it is tempting to
speculate that modulating the immune pathway brings great
therapeutic promise for treating MI and heart failure. Therefore,
miR-19a/19b-mediated early cardiac protection could open a
window to the development of effective therapy for heart attack
and bring great benefits to heart failure patients.
Numerous efforts have been applied to prevent and/or reduce
cardiac injury associated with the loss of cardiomyocytes. In
addition to cell therapy using stem cells or progenitor cells,
understanding the molecular pathways that control cardiomyo-
cyte proliferation yields promise for the success of gene therapy.
Several miRNAs have been reported to potently enhance cell
proliferation, and they have also been demonstrated to be able to
promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in embryonic, postnatal,
and even adult hearts. However, previous work, using transgenic
overexpression approaches in mouse models, also found that
long-term, continuous overexpression of microRNAs (miR-17-92
cluster and miR-302-367 cluster) in adult hearts resulted in a
significant increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation and dediffer-
entiation, leading to deleterious cardiac function10,18. Work
reported here further defines miR-19a/miR-19b as effective
miRNAs that mediated the function of the miR-17-92 cluster,
suggesting that these miRNAs could become therapeutic targets
for heart failure. Whereas our data establishes that miR-19a/19b
are likely the key members of the miR-17-92 cluster that mediate
its function in cardiac protection, we cannot formally rule out the
potential involvement of other members of this cluster.
What are the targets of miR-19a/19b in the heart? It has been
generally believed that a miRNA achieves its function by targeting
many downstream mRNA targets. Interestingly, one of our recent
works demonstrated that the function of one miRNA could be
primarily mediated by a single target; we showed, using both gain
and loss of function experiments and functional rescue assays,
that miR-208a controls cardiac remodeling by repressing the
expression and function of Sox6 in the heart27. Here, we verified
that Pten, one miR-19 target18 that is involved in cell proliferation
and apoptosis, is repressed by miR-19a/19b in the heart. It is
likely that PTEN directly participates in miR-19a/19b-mediated
regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to MI. We
observed dysregulation of genes related to the immune response
pathway in the early stage of cardiac response to injury. It will be
important to determine whether these genes are direct targets of
miR-19a/miR-19b. Most miRNAs regulate their target genes by
repressing their expression levels. While we observed that many
genes related to immune response were repressed by miR-19a/
19b,
intriguingly,
we
also
observed
up-regulated
immune
response genes upon miR-19a/19b overexpression, such as Arg-1
and CD 163. At present it is unclear how they are up-regulated by
miR-19a/19b. Better defining miR-19a/19b targets in this setting
will increase our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of
miRNA action. The Hippo/Yap pathway has also been reported
to play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and cardiac
regeneration29–33, raising the question of whether miR-19a/19b
controls cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration by
regulating the expression and activity of the Hippo/Yap pathway.
While our study did not yield evidence to support such link, it
will be interesting to investigate the potential molecular, genetic
and functional interaction between miR-19 and the Hippo/Yap
pathway in the heart. In particular, whether miR-19 could reg-
ulate the expression and function of the Hippo/Yap pathway
post-transcriptionally.
Whereas our current study provides convincing evidence to
support the positive roles of miRNAs in cardiac function, it
should be recognized that certain limitations and barriers must be
overcome before miRNAs can become effective therapeutic tools
to treat heart disease. Among these concerns is the specificity of
miRNA action. Another challenge of utilizing miRNAs is how to
effectively and specifically deliver them into target sites. Never-
theless, miRNAs hold tremendous promise to become powerful
tools to battle cardiovascular disease.

(Jackson Laboratory) by ligation of the LAD coronary artery. For surgery, mice are
anesthetized with isoflurane (3% isoflurane for induction, 2% isoflurane for
maintenance). The chest is shaved and cleaned with alcohol. A suture is placed
around the front upper incisors and pulled taut so that the neck is slightly
extended. The tongue is retracted and held with forceps, and a 20-G catheter is
inserted into the trachea. The catheter is then attached to the mouse ventilator via a
Y-shaped connector. Ventilation is performed with a tidal volume of 225 μl for a
25 g mouse and a respiratory rate of 130 breaths per minute. 100% oxygen is
provided to the inflow of the ventilator. The chest is opened through a left para-
sternal incision, and the heart exposed at the left 3rd–4th intercostal space. Chest

 retractor is applied to facilitate the view. The pericardium is opened, and ligations
made on the LAD coronary artery using 8–0 silk sutures (Ethicon). The lungs are
slightly overinflated to assist in removal of air in the pleural cavity. Dissected
intercostal space and chest skin were closed using a 6–0 silk suture (Ethicon).
Intra-cardiac injection of miRNA mimics. Eight-week-old male c57BL/6 mice
were randomly subjected to intra-cardiac injection of microRNA mimic miR-19a/
miR-19b or control mimics (10 μg per mouse heart), respectively, after MI. All
microRNA mimics were purchased from Dharmacon and formulated with Max-
Suppressor in vivo RNALancerII, a lipid-based delivery reagent (BIOO Scientific,
Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a previous report10.
For evaluation of individual members of the miR-19 family, miR-19a (10 μg per
heart), miR-19b (10 μg per heart), or control mimics (10 μg/per heart) were
injected post MI. For the experiments using a combination of miR-19a and miR-
19b, miR-19a (5 μg)/19b (5 μg) (10 μg per heart), or control mimics (10 μg per
heart) in a total volume of 50 μl were injected using an insulin syringe with needle
(31 G), immediately after the ligation of LAD coronary artery. The miRNA mimics
were evenly injected into three sites around the infarcted area (anterior wall, lateral
wall, and apex area). Average volume of mimic solutions for each injection site is
about 15 μl. When injecting, the needle is within the ventricle muscular wall but
not ventricular cavity. Immediately after injection of mimics, anesthesia
(isoflurane) was stopped to increase survival.
AAV9-miR-19a/19b cloning and virus packaging. We generated AAV9-cTNT::
miR-19a/miR-19b-1(AAV9-miR-19a/19b), in which the cardiac-specific TNNT2
promoter is used to drive the expression of miR-19a/19b in the heart. An AAV9-
cTNT::Luciferase (AAV9-Control) was used as a control. The cDNA fragments
encoding Luciferase and mouse miR-19a/19b precursor sequences (miR-19a/19b-1
vector was gifted from Dr. Andrea Ventura36) were separately cloned into AAV
Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR)-containing AAV9 plasmid (Penn Vector Core)
harboring the chicken cardiac TNT promoter, to generate pEn.cTnT::Luciferase
and pEn.cTnT::miR-19a/19b, respectively. The AAV9 were packaged in
HEK293T cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and tested to
be mycoplasma free) with AAV9:Rep-Cap and pAd deltaF6 (Penn Vector Core) as
described previously37. Three days later, cells were collected and lysed. AAV was
purified and concentrated by gradient centrifugation. Titration of AAV viral par-
ticles was determined by real-time PCR quantification of the number of viral
genomes, as described previously27,34. The viral preparations had titers between
1 × 1013 and 4 × 1013 viral genome particles per ml.
Intra-cardiac injection of AAV9-miRNA. Eight week-old male c57BL/6 mice were
randomly subjected to intra-cardiac injection of AAV9-miR-19a/19b, or AAV9-
Control (2 × 1011 viral genome particles per mouse heart), respectively, after MI.
Immediately after the ligation of LAD coronary artery, AAV9-miR-19a/19b or
AAV9-Control in a total volume of 50 μl were injected into ventricle muscular wall
but not ventricular cavity using insulin syringe with needle (31 G). The AAV9-
miRNAs were evenly injected into three sites around the infarcted area (anterior
wall, lateral wall, and apex area). Immediately after injection of AAV, anesthesia
(isoflurane) was stopped to increase survival. Then the chest was closed and the
animal was changed to a prone position until recovery of spontaneous breathing.
Systemic delivery of miRNA mimics through tail-vein injection. Eight-week-old
male c57BL/6 mice were randomly subjected to tail-vein injection of miR-19a/19b
or control mimics after MI. All miRNA mimics were purchased from Dharmacon
and formulated with neutral lipid emulsion (NLE,MaxSuppressor in vivo RNA-
LancerII, BIOO Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice
were injected a single dose per day of 10 μg NLE-formulated miRNA mimics
through intravenous tail-vein. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-19a/19b
in treating infarcted hearts, miR-19a/19b or control mimic (10 μg in 100 μl mixture
per mouse systemically) was administered daily for 3 days, beginning 6 h after MI.
To further determine the therapeutic effect of miR-19a/19b on heart after MI,
another lipid-mediated (RNAiMax) miRNA delivery through tail-vein injection
was performed. A dose of 100 μl mixture of miRNA and RNAiMax (ratio 1:1 in
volume) was prepared. RNAiMax-mediated mixture was injected through intra-
venous tail-vein daily for 3 days, beginning 6 h after MI.
Measurement of cardiac function by echocardiography. Echocardiographic
measurements were performed on mice using a Visual Sonics Vevo® 2100 Imaging
System (Visual Sonics, Toronto, Canada) with a 40 MHz MicroScan transducer
(model MS-550D)18,27,34. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% isoflurane
for induction and 0.5% for maintenance). Heart rate and left ventricular (LV)
dimensions, including diastolic and systolic wall thicknesses, LV end-diastolic and
end-systolic chamber dimensions, were measured from 2-D short-axis under M-
mode tracings at the level of the papillary muscle. LV mass and functional para-
meters such as percentage of fractional shortening (FS%) and left ventricular
volume were calculated using the above primary measurements and accompanying
software.
EdU incorporation and immunofluorescence staining. 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyur-
idine (EdU)-labeling assay was used to analyze cardiomyocyte proliferation as
described previously18. MI mice with injected miRNA mimics were intraper-
itoneally injected with EdU (Life Technologies) at 5 μg/g of body weight, every
2 days for five times total. At the end point of the experiment, mouse hearts were
harvested, rinsed with PBS and arrested in diastole buffer (4.7 nM KCl and 0.1%
2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) in PBS). Hearts were then fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde (pH 8.0) overnight and embedded in paraffin. Then paraffin samples
were cut into 5 μm tissue sections, de-waxed in xylene for 5 min (twice) and
rehydrated with alcohols in decreasing concentration (100%, 90%, 70%, 50%) at
room temperature. Sections were boiled for 10 min in antigen retrieval buffer
Retrievagen A (pH 6.0) (BD Pharmingen). Sections were rinsed three times in
water, permeabilized for 15 min in 0.5% Triton X100 PBS, and blocked for 30 min
in 3% BSA in PBS. Then EdU Immunofluorescence staining was performed on the
sections by using the Click-iT® EdU Imaging Kits (Alexa Fluor® 488) to assess EdU
incorporation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For further co-staining,
the sections were removed from the reaction cocktail and washed with 1 ml of 3%
BSA in PBS and blocked in 5% goat serum. Mouse anti-cardiac troponin T (cTNT,
1:500, a generous gift from Dr. Jim Lin of University of Iowa) antibody was used to
mark the cardiomyocytes. Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6′-diamidino-pheny-
lindole (DAPI, 1:5000, Invitrogen). Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa-
Fluor 594, 1:400, Invitrogen) was used for visualization under microscopy.
Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was labelled with wheat germ agglutinin (Alexa
Fluor® 647 conjugate WGA; 1:100, Invitrogen), which was added together with the
secondary antibody. Quantitative data were obtained by measuring co-localization
of DAPI with EdU in the cardiomyocyte area. Imaging was performed on a Nikon
TE2000 epifluorescent microscope with deconvolution (Volocity; Perkin-Elmer).
To identify mitosis and cytokinesis, we used rabbit anti-pH3 (1:400, Millipore, cat
#06-570) and rabbit anti-Aurora B (1:100, Abcam cat #ab2254) antibodies,
respectively. Mouse anti-α-actinin (1:250, Abcam, cat #ab9465) was used to mark
cardiomyocytes. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (1:5000). Goat anti-rabbit and
goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 or 594 as secondary antibody (1:400, Invitrogen)
were used for microscopic visualization. Quantitative data were obtained by
measuring co-localization of DAPI (nuclear staining) with pH3 in the cardio-
myocyte area.
Histology and TUNEL assays. Mouse hearts were dissected out, rinsed, and
arrested in diastole buffer (4.7 nM KCl and 0.1% BDM in PBS). Hearts were then
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) overnight. After dehydration through a
series of ethanol baths, samples were embedded in paraffin wax according to
standard laboratory procedures. Sections of 5 μm in thickness were stained with

 haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The stained sections were used for routine his-
tological examination by light microscopy.
To determine infarct size, hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 8.0),
dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Then the embedded paraffin blocks were cut
through from apex to base. The first 10 sections (10 μm thickness each) of every
100 sections were used. Sections were further fixed with prewarmed Bouins’
solution at 55 °C for 1 h and stained with Fast Green and Sirius Red18,27,34. Infarct
size was calculated according to the formula: [length of coronal infarct perimeter
(epicardial + endocardial)/total LV coronal perimeter (epicardial +
endocardial)] × 100 18,38.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assays were performed on paraffin sections to detect apoptotic cardiomyocytes, as
described previously18. ApopTag® Plus In Situ Apoptosis Fluorescein Detection Kit
was used (Cat #S7111 Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s procedure.

 Positive control slides containing unstained rat mammary glands were TUNEL
assayed as well. The cardiomyocytes were counter-stained with cTNT and DAPI.
To identify M1 and M2 phages, immunohistochemistry analyses were
performed in the heart sections. After incubating paraffin heart sections in three
washes of xylene, two washes of 100% ethanol, two washes of 95% ethanol, and two
washes of ddH2O for deparaffinization and rehydration, they were processed for
antigen unmasking according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primary and
secondary antibodies were as following: CD80 (1:50, M1007-10, Hangzhou Huaan
Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), iNOS (1:200, RT1332, Hangzhou Huaan Biotechnology
Co., Ltd.), Arginase 1 (1:200, RT1051, Hangzhou Huaan Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).
UltraVision HP IHC detection kit was obtained from Shanghai Universal Biotech
Co., Ltd. Pictures were taken with a Leica DM4000 microscope.
Western blot analysis. Protein lysate samples were prepared from heart tissues in
tissue extraction reagent (Invitrogen, FNN0071) supplemented with proteinase
inhibitors. Lysate samples (30 μg total protein for each) were separated by 10%
SDS–PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. SOCS1
protein was probed with goat antibody to SOCS1 (Abcam, ab9870; 1:1000 dilu-
tion). SOCS3 protein was probed with rabbit antibody to SOCS3 (Abcam, ab16030;
1:1000 dilution). STAT3 protein was probed with mouse antibody to STAT3 (CST,
#9139; 1:1000 dilution). Phospho-STAT3 protein was probed with rabbit antibody
to phosho-STAT3 (CST, #9145; 1:1000 dilution). PTEN protein was probed with
rabbit antibody to PTEN (CST, #9188; 1:1000 dilution). Bim protein was probed
with rabbit antibody to Bim (CST, #2933; 1:1000 dilution). Cleaved-caspase3
protein was probed with rabbit antibody to cleaved-caspase3 (CST, #9661; 1:1000
dilution). Bcl2 protein was probed with rabbit antibody to Bcl2 (CST, #3498;
1:1000 dilution). Bax protein was probed with rabbit antibody to Bax (CST, #2772;
1:1000 dilution). Protein bands were visualized with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc
imaging system. All the antibody information is listed in Supplementary Table 6.
RNA-seq and genome-wide transcriptome analysis. RNA from the hearts of
mice 4 days after MI and miRNA mimic injection was prepared for RNA-seq (three
biological replicates for each group). RNA-seq experiments were performed by
Novogene (Beijing, China). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from fresh ventricular
tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen). mRNA was then purified from total RNA using
poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Sequencing libraries were generated using
NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following
manufacturer’s recommendations, and index codes were added to attribute
sequences to each sample. The clustering of the index-coded samples was per-
formed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-
HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation,
the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform and 150 bp
paired-end reads were generated. For the data analysis, raw data (raw reads) in
fastq format were first processed through in-house Perl scripts. Clean data (clean
reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing
ploy-N and low-quality reads from raw data. Reference genome and gene model
annotation files were downloaded from genome website directly. Index of the
reference genome was built using STAR and paired-end clean reads were aligned to
the reference genome using STAR (v2.5.1b). STAR uses the method of Maximal
Mappable Prefix (MMP). HTSeq v0.6.0 was used to count the read numbers
mapped to each gene. Analysis of differential expression was performed using the
edgeR R package (3.12.1). The P values were adjusted using the Benjamini and
Hochberg method. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were implemented using the
clusterProfiler R package. The hierarchical clustering heat map was generated with
the ggplot library.
Isolation of cardiomyocytes from adult mouse hearts. Isolation of cardiomyo-
cytes was performed as described previously39–41. Briefly, fresh hearts were har-
vested and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature.
Samples were then washed in PBS for 5 min and digested with collagenase B (1.8
mg/ml, Roche) and collagenase D (2.4 mg/ml, Roche) on a rotator at 37 °C over-
night. Cell suspensions were then collected at 300 g for 2 min and the pelleted cells
were resuspended in PBS. The isolated cardiomyocytes were stained with Connexin
43 antibody (1:1000, Abcam, cat #ab11370), α-actinin (1:250, Abcam, cat #ab9465),
and DAPI (1:5000) for cardiomyocyte counts and nucleation counts. For cardio-
myocyte count, 10 μl aliquots samples from total volume of digested cardiomyo-
cytes were counted using hemocytometer. The total number of cardiomyocytes
counted was ~150–200 cardiomyocytes per aliquot. We averaged three different
counts per sample and eight hearts per group. For nucleation, ~1 × 103 cardio-
myocytes were counted per sample, using six independent samples per group.
Nucleation was plotted as percentage of counted cardiomyocytes.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen)
from cell or tissue samples. For qRT-PCR detecting the expression of protein-
coding genes, 2.0 μg RNA samples were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using ran-
dom hexamers and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20 μl reaction
system. In each analysis, 0.1 μl cDNA pool was used for quantitative PCR. For
qRT-PCR detecting the expression of miRNAs, 10 ng RNA samples were reverse-
transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI).
In each analysis, 1.5 μl cDNA pool and TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays were used for
quantitative PCR. All qPCR experiments were performed on the Applied Biosys-
tems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. Primers used in this study is listed in Sup-
plementary Table 7.
