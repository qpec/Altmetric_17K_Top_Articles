ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether higher cumulative use of 
benzodiazepines is associated with a higher risk of 
dementia or more rapid cognitive decline.
Design
Prospective population based cohort.
setting
Integrated healthcare delivery system, Seattle, 
Washington.
PartiCiPants
3434 participants aged ≥65 without dementia at study 
entry. There were two rounds of recruitment (1994-96 
and 2000-03) followed by continuous enrollment 
beginning in 2004.
Main OutCOMes Measures
The cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI) was 
administered every two years to screen for dementia 
and was used to examine cognitive trajectory. Incident 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were determined 
with standard diagnostic criteria. Benzodiazepine 
exposure was defined from computerized pharmacy 
data and consisted of the total standardized daily 
doses (TSDDs) dispensed over a 10 year period (a 
rolling window that moved forward in time during 
follow-up). The most recent year was excluded because 
of possible use for prodromal symptoms. Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine 
time varying use of benzodiazepine and dementia risk. 
Analyses of cognitive trajectory used linear regression 
models with generalized estimating equations.
results
Over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, 797 participants 
(23.2%) developed dementia, of whom 637 developed 
Alzheimer’s disease. For dementia, the adjusted 
hazard ratios associated with cumulative 
benzodiazepine use compared with non-use were 1.25 
(95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.51) for 1-30 TSDDs; 
1.31 (1.00 to 1.71) for 31-120 TSDDs; and 1.07 (0.82 to 1.39) 
for ≥121 TSDDs. Results were similar for Alzheimer’s 
disease. Higher benzodiazepine use was not associated 
with more rapid cognitive decline.
COnClusiOn
The risk of dementia is slightly higher in people with 
minimal exposure to benzodiazepines but not with the 
highest level of exposure. These results do not support 
a causal association between benzodiazepine use and 
dementia.
Introduction
Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed to treat insomnia 
and anxiety, with about 9-12% of older adults in the 
United States reporting use.1 
2 These drugs are associated 
with many deleterious effects, including falls, fractures, 
traffic incidents, and delirium.1 
3 Because of these risks 
benzodiazepines are not recommended for treatment of 
insomnia, agitation, or delirium in older adults, and it is 
recommended that use, if any, be short term.4 Nonethe-
less, benzodiazepine use increases with age, and older 
adults are more likely to use these drugs long term.1
Single dose studies have shown that benzodiaze-
pines impair aspects of cognition (such as memory and 
attention).5  It remains uncertain whether long term use 
is associated with global cognitive decline. Some well 
conducted studies suggest that long term use does not 
increase the risk of cognitive decline, but results are 
conflicting.6 7  Considerable attention has focused on 
the potential relation between benzodiazepines and 
increased risk of dementia.8-14 Examination of this rela-
tion is challenging because dementia can be preceded 
by symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, and depres-
sion,15-17 which are often treated with benzodiazepines. 
Observational studies must use appropriate design 
strategies to account for benzodiazepines used to treat 
early symptoms of dementia to avoid bias from reverse 
causation. We are aware of three studies that intention-
ally considered the prodromal phase and potential for 
reverse causation. Two of these reported an increased 
risk of dementia with benzodiazepine use,8 
9  while the 
other did not.14  These studies had limitations including 
lack of information about duration and dose of benzo-
diazepine treatment8 and the reliance on administra-
tive data to identify people with Alzheimer’s disease.9 
14 
No studies have been conducted in the US, where pat-
terns of benzodiazepine use differ from other countries. 
Given the enormous public health implications, we 
need a better understanding of the potential cognitive 
risks of cumulative benzodiazepine use.
We used data from a prospective cohort study with 
research quality diagnoses of dementia and comput-
erized pharmacy data to evaluate the association

between cumulative benzodiazepine use and the risk 
for dementia and cognitive decline. We hypothesized 
that higher cumulative use would be associated with 
increased risk.
Methods
Design, study setting, and participants
The Adult Changes in Thought study is a population 
based prospective cohort study conducted within Group 
Health, an integrated healthcare delivery system in the 
north west US. Study procedures have been reported 
elsewhere.18  Briefly, participants aged ≥65 without 
dementia were randomly sampled from Group Health 
members in the Seattle area. The original cohort of 2581 
people was enrolled in 1994-96 and 811 additional partic-
ipants in 2000-03. In 2004 the study began continuous 
enrollment to replace those who developed dementia, 
died, or dropped out. Participants were assessed at study 
entry and biennially thereafter to evaluate cognitive 
function and collect demographic characteristics, medi-
cal history, health behaviors, and health status. Our anal-
yses were limited to participants who had at least 10 
years of prior membership of Group Health at enrollment 
to ensure adequate data on long term exposure to medi-
cation (fig 1). For the analyses of dementia, we required 
participants to have at least one follow-up visit. For the 
analyses of cognitive trajectory, we included all partici-
pants who had a valid cognitive score at baseline. 
Because we were interested in whether benzodiazepine 
use was associated with a more rapid cognitive decline 
only in participants who had not yet had a diagnosis of 
dementia, we excluded from these analyses any visits 
made after the date of onset of dementia.
Cognitive outcomes
Identification of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
We used the cognitive abilities screening instrument 
(CASI) to screen for dementia at study entry and at each 
biennial study visit.19  Scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better performance. Partici-
pants with scores of ≤85 underwent a standardized 
diagnostic evaluation for dementia, including a physi-
cal and neurological examination and neuropsycholog-
ical testing. The results, along with clinical data from 
participants’ medical records, were then reviewed in a 
multidisciplinary consensus conference including the 
examining physician, a neuropsychologist, another 
study physician, and the study nurse. The diagnoses of 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were made with 
standard research criteria.20 21 The date of onset of 
dementia was assigned as the midpoint between the 
study visit that triggered the evaluation of dementia 
and the preceding visit. Participants with new onset 
dementia underwent at least one follow-up examina-
tion to confirm the diagnosis.
Cognitive trajectory
We used the CASI score for our primary analyses of cog-
nitive trajectory. A feature of this score is that the distri-
bution of item difficulty is not uniform across levels of 
cognitive ability. For example, there are few hard ques-
tions that would be appropriate for those with no cogni-
tive impairment. Because of this, there is a non-linear 
relation between the score and underlying cognitive 
ability, resulting in imprecision at the higher end of the 
scale.22  We therefore performed secondary analyses 
after applying item response theory (IRT) methods to 
generate CASI-IRT scores, which have linear scaling 
properties (Parscale, Scientific Software International, 
Chicago, IL).23 This deals with the relative insensitivity 
of the CASI to detect cognitive decline in people with 
high cognitive functioning.
use of benzodiazepines
The exposure included benzodiazepines and non-ben-
zodiazepine hypnotics that bind to the gamma-amino-
butyric acid (GABA) receptor, such as zolpidem, 
zaleplon, and eszopiclone. Few participants, however, 
used non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Drug use was 
ascertained from Group Health’s computerized phar-
macy data and included drug name, strength, route of 
administration, date dispensed, and amount dispensed.
Previous studies have not delineated what pattern of 
benzodiazepine exposure might be important for 
increasing risk of dementia (for example, long term sus-
tained use versus several episodes of periodic use). We 
hypothesized that cumulative drug exposure, particu-
larly heavier exposure that might accumulate over a 
long time period (via either intermittent or sustained 
use), was the most plausible causal mechanism by 
which use might increase the risk of dementia. We there-
fore selected a 10 year window based on this hypothesis 
and on methodologic and practical considerations.
To create our exposure measures, we first calculated 
the total benzodiazepine dose for each prescription by 
multiplying the drug strength and the number of tablets 
dispensed. We then calculated a standardized daily dose 
(SDD) by dividing the product by the minimum effective 
dose per day recommended for use in older adults 
(table 1 ).24  For each participant, we summed the SDDs for 
all filled prescriptions for benzodiazepines during the 10 
year exposure window to create a cumulative total stan-
dardized daily dose (TSDD).25-27 We constructed a time 
varying measure defined as the TSDD dispensed over a

10 year window after excluding dispensings in the most 
recent year, which could have been for prodromal symp-
toms of dementia.28 Figure 2 shows how exposure win-
dows were defined. At each time point during follow-up, 
the cumulative exposure for all participants at risk is 
recalculated by summing all of their benzodiazepine use 
in the previous 10 years (after exclusion of the most recent 
year ). We categorized cumulative use as no use, 1-30 
TSDDs, 31-120 TSDDs, or ≥121 TSDDs based on the distri-
bution of the exposure and clinically meaningful cut-
points. As examples, a person would reach the highest 
level of exposure in a 10 year period if he/she took any of 
the following for a total of 121 days or longer: temazepam 
15 mg/day, triazolam 0.125 mg/day, or lorazepam 2 mg/
day. This level of use could be achieved by daily use for 121 
days or could represent episodic use over several years.
Our exposure for the analyses of cognitive trajectory 
differed in a few ways from the one we defined for anal-
yses of dementia. First, cumulative benzodiazepine use 
was calculated in the 10 years immediately before each 
study visit (that is, no one year lag) as we were evaluat-
ing cognitive decline only in participants who had not 
yet had a diagnosis of dementia. Second, we created a 
measure of recent use defined as filling two or more pre-
scriptions for a benzodiazepine in the six months before 
each visit, requiring each prescription to have at least 
seven TSDDs (fig 2).
Covariates
Information about covariates came from standardized 
questionnaires administered at each study visit and 
from Group Health’s electronic databases. Demographic 
factors included age, sex, and years of education. Body 
mass index (BMI) was determined from measured 
height and weight.29  Participants were asked about 
smoking, exercise, and self rated health.30  We ascer-
tained presence of several comorbidities including 
hypertension or diabetes mellitus treated with drugs 
(computerized pharmacy data), history of stroke (self 
report or electronic databases), and coronary heart dis-
ease (self report). Symptoms of depression were 
obtained from the short version of the Center for Epide-
miologic Studies Depression scale.31
statistical analyses
Analyses of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
We used separate multivariable Cox proportional haz-
ards models with participant’s age as the time scale to 
estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
the association between benzodiazepine use and inci-
dent dementia or possible or probable Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Age at study entry was taken as start of follow-up. 
Participants were followed until the earliest of onset of 
dementia, disenrollment from Group Health, or last 
study visit before 30 September 2012. We adjusted for age 
at study entry, sex, educational level, hypertension, dia-
betes mellitus, current smoking, stroke, coronary heart 
disease, BMI, regular exercise, self rated health, and 
symptoms of depression (variables defined in table 2). 
We included time varying measures for coronary heart

disease and stroke and the values from the baseline 
visit for all other covariates. We excluded observations 
with missing covariate information (n=130). We 
assessed the assumption of proportional hazards by 
testing the interaction between the exposure and age at 
follow-up. In secondary analyses, we modeled the 
exposure as a continuous variable using natural cubic 
splines to examine whether results were influenced by 
the cutpoints chosen for exposure categories.
Analyses of cognitive trajectory
We evaluated the average differences in CASI scores 
and the average differences in rates of decline of these 
scores between benzodiazepine user groups using lin-
ear regression models estimated via generalized esti-
mating equations. We used a working independence 
correlation matrix and calculated standard errors 
using the Huber-White sandwich estimator to account 
for the correlation between multiple CASI scores from 
the same individual.32 We estimated the average differ-
ence in rate of cognitive decline, defined as decline in 
CASI per year, between user groups by including an 
interaction term between age at follow-up and level of 
cumulative exposure. Models adjusted for the same 
covariates as in the dementia analyses. Analyses of the 
association between CASI trajectory and recent benzo-
diazepine use (six months before visit) also adjusted 
for cumulative use (six months to 10 years before visit).
Sensitivity analyses
For the dementia analyses, we performed several sensi-
tivity analyses to explore the robustness of our results. 
Given the uncertainty regarding when prodromal symp-
toms might first emerge before a diagnosis of dementia, 
we extended the lag time to two years. In additional 
models, we included depressive symptoms as a time 
varying covariate and adjusted for the  
Charlson comor-
bidity index (Deyo adaption).33  Lastly, we performed a 
post hoc analysis extending the lag time to five years to 
replicate the methods used by another study.9
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
recruitment or the design and implementation of the 
study. There are no plans to involve patients in the dis-
semination of results.
Results
Table 2  shows participants’ characteristics overall and 
by cumulative benzodiazepine exposure in the 10 years 
before study entry. The median age of participants at 
study entry was 74, 91% (n=3134) were white, 60% were 
women, and most (66%) had some college education. 
Overall, 30% had filled at least one prescription for a 
benzodiazepine in the 10 years before study entry, 
though lonely 3% (n=98) had recently used a benzodi-
azepine (within six months). Participants with heavier 
benzodiazepine use were more likely to be women and 
report fair or poor self rated health, have more depres-
sive symptoms, and have comorbidities (such as hyper-
tension, stroke, and coronary heart disease) than 
non-users. The most common benzodiazepines were 
temazepam, diazepam, clonazepam, triazolam, and 
lorazepam (table 3), which together accounted for 83% 
of the benzodiazepine exposure. Within the highest 
benzodiazepine category (≥121 TSDDs), the median 
level of use was 375 TSDDs (equivalent to slightly over a 
year of daily use).
Dementia and alzheimer’s disease
The 3434 participants included in these analyses 
accrued 25 019 person years of follow-up, with a mean 
of 7.3 (SD 4.8) years. During this time, 797 (23.2%)

participants developed incident dementia, of whom 
637 (79.9%) developed Alzheimer’s disease. Table 4 
 
shows the follow-up time and number of events accord-
ing to exposure categories. Figure 3 shows age adjusted 
and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for dementia 
and Alzheimer’s disease associated with cumulative 
 
benzodiazepine use. No association was found with 
the  
highest level of benzodiazepine use (≥121 TSDDs) 
for dementia (hazard ratio 1.07
, 95% confidence inter-
val 0.83 to 1.37) or Alzheimer’s disease (0.95, 0.71 to 
1.27) compared with non-use. Relative to non-use, 
there was a slightly increased risk for dementia for par-
ticipants with low (1-30 TSDDs; 1.25, 1.03 to 1.51) or 
moderate use (31-120 TSDDs; 1.31, 1.00 to 1.71); whereas 
for Alzheimer’s disease, increased risk was noted only 
among participants with low use (1.27, 1.03 to 1.57). 
When we split the highest category of benzodiazepine 
use into two groups, the hazard ratio for dementia was 
1.11 (0.78 to 1.58) for 121-364 TSDDs and 1.03 (0.73 to 
1.44) for ≥365 TSDDs. Findings for Alzheimer’s disease 
were similar.
Figure 4 shows results from additional analyses that 
modeled benzodiazepine exposure as a continuous 
variable with natural cubic splines. These curves show 
the estimated hazard ratios (and 95% confidence inter-
vals) for each level of exposure relative to a reference 
group with no cumulative exposure (0 TSDDs). For 
dementia, there was a modestly increased hazard ratio 
between 1.1 and 1.4 for ≤90 TSDDs but risk declined 
toward 1.0 with higher exposure. Benzodiazepine use 
was not significantly associated with Alzheimer’s 
 
disease at any exposure level.
When we extended the lag time to two years, the 
associations for the lowest level of benzodiazepine use 
were no longer significant for either dementia (hazard 
ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.44) or Alz-
heimer’s disease (1.18, 0.95 to1.47) (fig 3). Adjustment 
for depressive symptoms as a time varying covariate or 
for overall comorbidity did not alter estimates apprecia-
bly. In the post hoc analysis with a five year lag, we con-
tinued to find no association between cumulative 
benzodiazepine use and dementia (table 5).
Cognitive trajectory
The average CASI score at baseline was 93.4 (SD 4.7), 
with similar scores across levels of cumulative benzodi-
azepine use (range 93.0-93.6). We found no significant 
differences for any benzodiazepine use group in mean 
CASI or rates of decline compared with non-users 
(tables 6 and 7). Those in the highest benzodiazepine 
use group had a decline per year 0.002 points slower 
than people not using benzodiazepines (95% confi-
dence interval −0.05 to 0.06). There were also no differ-
ences in rates of cognitive decline between recent and 
non-recent users of benzodiazepines (adjusted coeffi-
cient −0.0061, 95% confidence interval −0.08 to 0.07). 
Results were similar when we used the CASI-IRT scores.
discussion
In this population based longitudinal study of older 
adults with detailed pharmacy data and rigorous out-
come assessment we did not find any association 
between the highest level of benzodiazepine use and 
dementia or cognitive decline. Contrary to expecta-
tions, we found a small increased risk for dementia in 
people with low (that is, up to one month) or moderate 
(one to four months) use. This pattern does not support 
a causal association between cumulative benzodiaze-
pine use and risk of dementia, and the small increased 
risk observed with low use could represent treatment of 
prodromal symptoms, as supported by our sensitivity 
analyses. It is also possible that people with prodromal 
dementia, even years before diagnosis, could be more 
sensitive to benzodiazepine induced acute cognitive 
adverse events (for example, delirium), resulting in dis-
continuation of the drug and avoidance, in turn leading

Of the studies that used strategies to deal with reverse 
causation, our findings are in line with one recent 
study14  but are in contrast with two previous studies 
that reported an increased risk of dementia with benzo-
diazepine use.8 9  In a case-control study conducted 
using administrative data from the UK based Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink, high use of benzodiaze-
pines, as determined by number of prescriptions, was 
not associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s 
disease after use initated in the prodromal phase was

accounted for. In fact, people who filled more than 100 
benzodiazepine prescriptions had a lower risk for Alz-
heimer’s disease than non-users, a finding the authors 
cautioned against overinterpreting.14  In contrast, in a 
prospective population based study conducted in 
France of 1063 older adults, new use of benzodiaze-
pines was associated with an increased risk of dementia 
(hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.43).8 
 
In regard to this latter study, our results are not directly 
comparable because of differences in study design 
(their study included new users) and method of ascer-
taining benzodiazepine use (they relied on periodic 
interviews and lacked information about dose, dura-
tion, or chronicity of use). The study lacked information 
on some potential confounders and excluded 72% of 
the sample because of the new user design. In a 
case-control study among older adults living in Quebec, 
benzodiazepine use as assessed by computerized phar-
macy data five to 10 years before the index date was 
associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.9 
These authors reported a dose-response relation with 
no association found for a cumulative dose of less than 
91 prescribed daily doses but an increased risk for 
91-180 prescribed daily doses (1.32, 1.01 to 1.74) and >180 
prescribed daily doses (1.84, 1.62 to 2.08). After adjust-
ment for diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and insom-
nia, estimated effects were slightly attenuated, and only 
the highest use category remained significantly associ-
ated with risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
It is unclear why our findings differ from those of the 
Canadian study, but we offer a few possible explana-
tions. Our participants could have had considerably 
lower use of benzodiazepines, although this is difficult 
to determine as that study did not report additional 
details about extent of exposure in their highest use cat-
egory. If there is a true association, perhaps cumulative

use in our study fell below the threshold needed to 
increase risk of dementia. Although the method to cal-
culate and categorize the cumulative daily dose differed 
in these studies, it is unlikely that these differences 
explain our discrepant results. Our analysis using con-
tinuous benzodiazepine exposure supported our pri-
mary findings of no association with higher doses. We 
explored extending the lag period used to exclude pre-
scriptions because of prodromal symptoms to more 
closely match the Canadian study and continued to find 
no association. The primary difference between this 
study and ours relates to ascertainment of the outcome. 
The Canadian study relied on administrative data to 
identify cases of Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, detec-
tion of Alzheimer’s disease could be delayed compared 
with routine surveillance as used in our study, and 
there could be considerable misclassification of out-
come status, which could be differential. People with 
heavy benzodiazepine use might have more frequent 
contact with the healthcare system, which could result 
in a higher likelihood of dementia being recognized and 
coded. While we cannot entirely rule out a moderate 
association in our highest benzodiazepine use group, 
the confidence limits exclude an association of the mag-
nitude reported in the Canadian study.
Some of the challenges inherent to using an observa-
tional study design to examine benzodiazepine use and 
risk of dementia have been discussed, such as account-
ing for use of these drugs to treat prodromal symptoms 
and limitations to using administrative data for outcome 
ascertainment. Another methodological challenge is 
 
balancing the possible advantages of a new user design 
with the reality of how people use benzodiazepines (that 
is, potentially episodic use over several decades) and 
considerations of sample size. A new user design is one 
strategy to deal with the bias caused by depletion of 
susceptible users; however, it is not clear that this 
design is well suited to examine the principal hypothe-
sis that heavier exposure (such as as might be accumu-
lated over many years) is important for increasing risk 
of dementia. Such a design would be challenging to 
implement in association with prospective follow-up of 
a cohort with a rigorous process for ascertainment of 
dementia outcomes such as that used in our study, thus 
forcing the “new user” study to rely on a less optimal 
outcome definition such as diagnosis codes from 
administrative or automated data. Additionally, benzo-
diazepines might be used sporadically over long peri-
ods of time on an “as needed” basis, which could make 
it challenging to identify true “new users,” particularly 
in elderly people. A prior study that attempted to 
 
identify new users in fact had limited data about 
 
benzodiazepine use before study enrollment, and so 
their apparent “new users” could in fact have had a his-
tory of benzodiazepine use, suggesting that even this 
study could have experienced bias because of depletion 
of susceptibles.8
strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths, including a large com-
munity based sample, an average follow-up of more 
than seven years, rigorous prospective ascertainment of 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and the ability to 
examine subclinical cognitive decline and dementia in 
the same cohort. We used computerized pharmacy data 
to characterize benzodiazepine use 10 years before

study entry and throughout follow-up, which, to our 
knowledge, is the longest duration used by any study to 
date for capturing benzodiazepine use. In addition, we 
were able to examine whether risk varies according to 
the extent of cumulative use. We specifically designed 
our study to take reverse causation into consideration 
and conducted multiple sensitivity and post hoc analy-
ses to explore the impact of different choices related to 
defining exposure. Lastly, a further strength of this 
study is the covariate information collected directly 
from participants about characteristics that are not well 
measured in administrative data (such as physical 
activity; universal and standardized assessment of 
depression). A corresponding limitation, however, is 
that no data on these characteristics are available 
before study enrollment, and in some cases covariates 
were therefore assessed after the start of exposure. If 
these confounders lie in the causal pathway, this could 
result in overadjustment. For many of our covariates, 
we are not aware of evidence to suggest they might be 
consequences of (rather than predictors of) benzodiaz-
epine use (such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary 
artery disease). In addition, our point estimates for the 
adjusted models were not considerably different than 
the age adjusted models, suggesting that the impact, if 
any, of such overadjustment was small.
A few limitations are worth mentioning. Few partici-
pants had heavy benzodiazepine use, and overall, our 
participants might have had lower levels of exposure 
than in some other studies. Like other studies that have 
examined benzodiazepine use and risk of dementia, we 
are unable to rule out depletion of susceptible bias. The 
non-user group might include individuals with past 
benzodiazepine use who had experienced acute cogni-
tive adverse events because of underlying preclinical 
dementia pathology and therefore did not have the 
opportunity to accumulate higher benzodiazepine use. 
Other studies experience this limitation as well and 
therefore this potential bias does not explain the differ-
ences in study results.8 
9  We were unable to exclude the 
possibility that within the source population, the most 
susceptible users of benzodiazepines might have devel-
oped dementia at a younger age and therefore been 
ineligible for study enrollment, which could have 
biased our findings toward not finding an association. 
We defined our exposure groups using a 10 year expo-
sure window, and our highest group is likely to include 
heterogeneous exposure patterns (mix of chronic and 
intermittent users). Likewise, prior studies have not 
described or examined patterns of benzodiazpine 
use.8 9 Other designs would be necessary to try to 
address whether the specific pattern of benzodiazepine 
use is important for dementia risk.
The nature of the association between neuropsychi-
atric symptoms (such as depression, insomnia, and 
anxiety) and risk of dementia is unclear and might 
depend on the timing of the symptoms in relation to 
the diagnosis. These symptoms occurring in the years 
just before the diagnosis of dementia possibly repre-
sent prodromal symptoms, though these same symp-
toms occurring decades or more before the diagnosis 
might represent risk factors.34-36 Though we dealt with 
the possibility of benzodiazepine use for prodromal 
symptoms in our analysis, we were not able to adjust 
for anxiety and insomnia as risk factors. We did adjust 
for depressive symptoms, which are strongly correlated 
with anxiety. Results from a prior study suggest that 
adjustment for anxiety and insomnia are unlikely to 
considerably alter our findings,9 and, if anything, it 
would be expected to move our hazard ratio closer 
toward the null. We were unable to ascertain whether 
prescribers had discontinued benzodiazepines 
because they identified that a participant had cognitive 
changes (such as delirium) while taking these drugs, 
which might have limited our ability to examine benzo-
diazepine use and cognitive trajectories. Furthermore, 
the CASI is a screening tool, making it relatively insen-
sitive to detect cognitive decline in people with high 
cognitive functioning. However, we still did not find an 
association between benzodiazepine use and cognitive 
decline when we used methods to overcome this limita-
tion by using the transformed CASI scores. Lastly, as 
most participants were white and relatively well edu-
cated, our results might not be generalizable to other 
groups.
Clinical implications and conclusions
In conclusion, we found a slightly higher risk of demen-
tia in people with the lowest benzodiazepine use but no 
increased risk in those with the highest level of expo-
sure (median exposure equivalent to about one year of 
daily use). Overall, our pattern of findings does not sup-
port the theory that cumulative benzodiazepine use at 
the levels observed in our population is causally related 
to an increased risk for dementia or cognitive decline. It 
should be noted that our study did not examine the 
acute cognitive adverse events that can occur when 
treatment with a benzodiazepine is started in older 
adults and careful monitoring is recommended in this 
situation. Nonetheless, given the mixed evidence 
regarding benzodiazepines and risk of dementia and 
that these drugs are associated with many adverse 
events, healthcare providers are still advised to avoid 
benzodiazepines in older adults to prevent important 
adverse health outcomes, withdrawal, and depen-
dence.
