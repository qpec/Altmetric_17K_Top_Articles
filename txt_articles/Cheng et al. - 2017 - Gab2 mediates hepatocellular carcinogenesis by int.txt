ABSTRACT: OurpreviousstudieshavefoundthatGrowthfactorreceptor-boundprotein2–associatedbindingprotein
2 (Gab2)—a docking protein—governs the development of fatty liver disease. Here, we further demonstrate that
Gab2 mediates hepatocarcinogenesis. Compared with a faint expression in para-carcinoma tissue, Gab2 was highly
expressed in ∼60–70% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Deletion of Gab2 dramatically sup-
pressed diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC in mice. The oncogenic effects of Gab2 in HepG2 cells were promoted by
Gab2 overexpression but were rescued by Gab2 knockdown. Furthermore, Gab2 knockout in HepG2 cells re-
strained cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth in nude mice. Signaling pathway analysis with protein
kinase inhibitors demonstrated that oncogenic regulation by Gab2 in hepatic cells involved multiple signaling
molecules, including ERK, Akt, and Janus kinases(Jaks), especially those that mediate inflammatory signaling. IL-6
signaling was increased by Gab2 overexpression and impaired by Gab2 deletion via regulation of Jak2 and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and the expression of downstream genes, such as Bcl-2
(B-cell lymphoma 2), c-Myc, MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7), and cyclin D1 in vitro and in vivo. These data
indicate that Gab2 mediates the pathologic progression of HCC by integrating multiple signaling pathways and
suggest that Gab2 might be a powerful therapeutic target for HCC.—Cheng, J., Zhong, Y., Chen, S., Sun, Y., Huang,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common types of cancer worldwide and the third
leading cause of cancer mortality (1). According to the
latest epidemiologic survey, ;782,500 new cases of
liver cancer and 745,500 liver cancer–related deaths
occurred worldwide in 2012, with half of these patients
and deaths in China alone (2). Unfortunately, effective
prevention and treatment strategies for HCC are lim-
ited, and almost all trials of molecular targeted therapy
have experienced failure as a result of the complex
molecular mechanism that underlies HCC develop-
ment and progression.
Only a small fraction of HCC cases are attributed to
gene mutation—the majority of cases develop in re-
sponse to chronic injuries and liver diseases, such as
chronic liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
hepatitis C virus, alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis, and food contamination (3, 4). A re-
cent study of the average percentage contribution
of HCC-related etiologies to cases in Europe and
America reported that glucose and lipid metabolism
disorders account for 36.6%, alcoholic disorder for
23.5%, hepatitis C virus for 22.4%, HBV for 6.3%, and
other genetic mutations for 3.2% (5). Hepatocellular
carcinogenesis involves a variety of pathologic factors,
including viruses, growth factors, metabolic molecules,

 and inflammatory cytokines. These pathologic factors can
trigger a series of signaling pathways that can lead to
HCC formation, invasion, and metastasis (6–8).
The oncogene HBx, which encodes the HBV X pro-
tein, can integrate the Ras/Raf/MAPK, MEKK1/JNK,
and PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin sig-
naling pathways, all of which are involved in cell
proliferation and survival (9). Abnormal activation
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling also commonly occurs in
HCC, and this pathway can regulate the expression of
key proliferation-related genes, such as cyclin D (10).
Excessive alcohol consumption disturbs glycolipid
metabolism and results in excessive fat accumulation,
which can stimulate an inflammatory response, create
oxidative stress, and further damage hepatocytes.
These pathologic processes recruit TNF-a, IL-6, perox-
isome proliferator-activated receptor-a/retinoid X receptor,
592AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase, NAD-dependent
deacetylase sirtuin-1/sterol regulatory element-binding
transcription factor 1, PI3K/Akt–sterol regulatory
element-binding transcription factor 1, JAK–signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), and other
signaling molecules to promote the development of
HCC (11). Furthermore, Notch (12), IGF/IGF receptor
(13), hepatocyte growth factor/hepatocyte growth
factor receptor (14), and EGFR (15) are also involved in
hepatocellular carcinogenesis. These signaling mole-
cules form an intricate network that governs carcino-
genesis, and hepatocarcinogenesis is the result of
various integrated signals. As a result of the complexity
of hepatocellular carcinogenesis, it is improbable that
an effective therapeutic target will arise from a single
signaling pathway; therefore, it is necessary to identify
a hub protein that can integrate multiple signaling
pathways—similar to EGFR and 14-3-3 proteins—to de-
velopanew,effectivedrugforthetreatment oflivercancer.
Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2–associated
binding protein 2 (Gab2), a scaffolding protein, can in-
tegrate and amplify several upstream receptor signals and
recruit various intracellular downstream signaling pro-
teins, including Ras (16), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
kinase Src (17), protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (18),
PI3K (19), adapter molecule Crk (20), and PLC (21). Our
previous study demonstrated that Gab2 recruited PI3K/
Akt, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3)/Stat3, and
other signaling molecules in fatty liver induced by patho-
logic factors. These pathways also play critical roles in
regulating cell proliferation and survival (22). Furthermore,
Gab2 governs tumorigenic signaling and is a novel poten-
tial therapeutic target in leukemia, breast cancer, ovarian
cancer,andmelanoma(23);therefore,wehypothesizedthat
Gab2 may be involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
To verify our hypothesis, we investigated Gab2 protein
levels in human HCC and determined the function of
Gab2 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis by using transgenic
mice. Our results demonstrate that Gab2 is overexpressed
in HCC and promotes the formation of liver cancer by
integrating several signaling pathways, including the
ERK, Akt, and Janus kinase (Jak) pathways. These results
suggest an oncogenic role for Gab2 in hepatocellular
carcinogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fresh HCC samples and tissue microarray
Fresh human HCC and paracarcinoma tissues were collected
from the Department of Pathology, Fujian Provincial Tumor
Hospital, between March 2013 and November 2014. The study
protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
Fujian Provincial Tumor Hospital (201515), and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants. Para-
carcinoma tissues were collected at a distance of at least 2 cm
from tumor lesions. Tumor and paracarcinoma tissues were
fragmented into 0.1-cm3 pieces and stored at 280°C. Protein
extracts from tissues were stored at 280°C for Western blot
analysis.
A tissue microarray that contained 23 cases of normal liver
tissue and 94 cases of HCC tissue was purchased from Alenabio
Company (Xi’an, China). Gab2 expression was assayed by im-
munohistochemistry (IHC) with a Gab2 Ab (06-967; Millipore,
Billerica,MA,USA)andcomprehensivelyevaluatedaccordingto
staining intensity and the number of positive cells.
Diethylnitrosamine-induced primary liver cancer
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal
Center of Xiamen University. Gab2 transgenic mice were a gift
fromtheBurnhamInstituteforMedicalResearch(SanDiego,CA,
USA) (24). Mice were housed under standard conditions with
free access to food and water. All experimental procedures were
approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Research Orga-
nization (X201011), Xiamen University. Mice were housed
3–5 per cage in a room under controlled light (12 h/d) and
temperature (22 6 2°C) conditions. For chemical-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis, mice at postnatal day 15 received an
intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 25 mg/kg;
N0258-1G; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or isometric
saline. Then, mice were weaned and maintained on regular
chow. Mice wereeuthanized at 6 and 12 mo after initial injection,
andliverswereharvested,stored,andphotographedforthenext
analysis. Tumor and paracarcinoma tissue samples—tissues at
a distance of 0.5 cm from tumor lesions were defined as
paracarcinoma—were separated from the whole liver. Tissues
were then divided into 0.5-cm squares for paraffin embedding
and extraction of total protein and RNA.
Xenograft model
For xenograft experiments, 4 different groups of cells (2 3 106
cells per mouse) were s.c. injected into 5- to 6-wk-old nude mice
(n = 8/group). After 6 d, tumor size was measured with Vernier
calipers every 2 d. At the 20th day after subcutaneous injection,
tumors were photographed using the Caliper IVIS Lumina II
system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) and then
removedforthenextexperiments.Tumorvolumewascalculated
as 0.5 3 length 3 width2.
Histochemistry, IHC, and ELISA
Histochemical staining (hematoxylin and eosin) and IHC were
performed according to a previously published standard pro-
tocol (22). IHC analysis of tumor lesions using Ki-67 (4203-1;
Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), PH3 (9701; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), Gab2 (3239; Cell Signaling
Technology), NF-kB (sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), and CD68 (ab955; Abcam, Cambridge, United
Kingdom) Abs was performed to detect the number of pro-
liferating cells and/or inflammatory cells.

 ForELISA,mousebloodwascollectedandincubatedfor2hat
room temperature. Serum was acquired after centrifugation for
3 min at 9000 rpm, and TNF-a and IL-6 serum levels were
measured by using ELISA kits according to manufacturer in-
structions (Blue Gene, Shanghai, China).
Cell line construction and cell treatment
HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell line was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). To
construct stable cell lines, a Gab2 cDNA fragment was inserted
into pIRES2-EGFP (bicistronic Gab2-IRES-GFP expression cas-
sette) or p3xFlag that contained a neomycin-resistance cassette
(Neor). All plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells, and cells
that stably express Gab2 were selected with G418. In brief,
RNA interference–mediated knockdown was performed
by transfecting Gab2–small interfering RNA (GGAGTGCC-
AGCTTCTCTCA) into HepG2 cells by using Lipofectamine
2000. To create the Gab2-knockout (KO) cell line, we built the
Px459-gRNA plasmid to knock out endogenous Gab2 by using
CRISPR technology and selected KO cells with puromycin.
gRNA sequences are as follows: forward, CACCGCAGGTA-
AAAGGTGCGTTCAC; reverse, AAACGTGAACGCACCTTT-
TACCTGC. All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a humidified
incubator in 5% CO2 with DMEM that contained 10% fetal bo-
vine serum (HyClone, Waltham, MA, USA). For cell treatments,
indicated cells were treated with 50 ng/ml IL-6 (200-06-5 mg;
PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) 24 h after seeding, then har-
vested at 0, 1, 3, or 6 h.
MTT assay
Cells from different groups were seeded at an initial density
of 2000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to grow for
4 d, and cell number was assessed each day with an MTT assay
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide;
Sigma-Aldrich]. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using
a Multiscan plate reader (MK3; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA).
Migration assay
Cell migration was evaluated with wound healing and transwell
assays. For wound healing experiments, a linear wound was
created by using a pipette tip when cells reached 90% confluence.
Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-
free DMEM. Cell migration area was examined by using an
inverted microscope and images were obtained at different time
points. For transwell assays (PIEP12R48; Millipore), 1 3 105 cells
were seeded on a fibronectin-coated polycarbonate membrane
and the membrane was placed into a transwell apparatus
(Millipore). After incubation for 12–18 h, cells on the upper
surface of the membrane were removed, and cells on the lower
surface of the membrane were stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
The stain was dissolved in 33% glacial acetic acid and quan-
titated with an ELISA plate reader at 492 nm, or the number of
stained cells was counted under a microscope. All experi-
ments were performed in triplicate.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and allowed to grow to 80%
confluence after pretreating with 5-fluorouracil (100 mg/ml) for
36 h. Cells were then digested and washed twice with ice-cold
PBS. After transient centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, cells were
incubated in darkness for 15 min in 100 ml ice-cold Annexin V
binding buffer that contained 5 ml Annexin V-FITC and 5 ml
propidium iodide. Eventually, the proportion of apoptotic cells
was analyzed with flow cytometry (Millipore).
Western blot analysis
Westernblotassayswereperformedaspreviouslydescribed(22).
Primary Abs against Gab2, P-Stat3Tyr705, Stat3, and Jak2 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. P-Jak2Tyr1007/Tyr1008
was obtained from Abcam. Western blot data are representa-
tive of 3 independent experiments. Analysis of grayscale in-
tensity of Gab2 was proceeded by using Quantity 1 analysis
software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). First, optimized im-
ages were chosen to create lanes, and band analysis was
performed according to software manuals. Eventually, the
grayscale of Gab2 was normalized to the grayscale of b-actin,
and relative grayscale of Gab2 was analyzed by using
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Roche, Indian-
apolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
were reversed transcribed with an All-in-One First-Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Transgene, Beijing, China). Primer sequences used
in the study are shown in Supplemental Table 1. Target gene
mRNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR by using
SYBR Green (Roche) and were normalized to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. Relative gene ex-
pression was calculated by using the 22ΔCt method.
Statistical analyses
All experiments were performed at least 3 times. Numerical data
are presented as means 6 SEM, and these data were statistically
analyzed by a 1-tailed Student’s t test and 1-way ANOVA by
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Statistically significant dif-
ferences were accepted at P # 0.05.
RESULTS
Gab2 is overexpressed in human HCC
To ascertain the role of Gab2 in liver carcinogenesis,
Gab2 protein expression in human HCC was investigated.
First, fresh tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor (para-
carcinoma) tissues were collected from 30 cases of human
liver carcinoma. Gab2 protein levels in these clinical
specimens were detected by Western blotting. Gab2 ex-
pression waslow in most of the paracarcinomatissues,but
was much higher in 70% of HCC samples (21 of 30; Fig. 1A
and Supplemental Fig. 1). Quantitative analysis on the
basis of the grayscale images of the bands indicated that
Gab2 expression was significantly higher in HCC than in
paracarcinoma tissue (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, Gab2 protein
levelsintissuearraysthatcontained94HCCsampleswere
assayed via IHC staining. Gab2 expression was high in
most HCC samples (55/94; 58.5%), but in only a few
normal liver tissue samples (6/23; 23%; Fig. 1C and
Table 1). The significant difference in Gab2 expression

 between HCC and nontumor tissue indicates that Gab2 is
involved in hepatic carcinogenesis.
Gab2 deletion suppresses DEN-induced liver
tumorigenesis in mice
To elucidate the role of Gab2 in hepatic carcinogenesis, we
examined whether Gab2 affects liver tumor formation and
progression. Gab2-KO and wild-type (WT) mice were i.p.
injected with DEN. After 12 mo of DEN treatment, Gab2
levels were up-regulated significantly in WT mice com-
pared with control mice with saline treatment, which
suggests that Gab2expression was possibly related to liver
tumorigenesis (Fig. 2F, upper). We then evaluated the
tumorigenicity in DEN-evoked WT and Gab2-KO mice
and found that there were many tumor nodules on the
surface of livers from DEN-treated WT mice (Fig. 2A, up-
per right); however, there were significantly fewer and
smaller tumors in livers from DEN-treated Gab2-KO mice
(Fig. 2A, bottom right). Of note, all WT male mice de-
veloped visible hepatic tumor foci after 12 mo of DEN
treatment (6 of 6), but only 7 of 14 KO mice presented with
a few small tumor nodules (Table 2). Statistical analysis
indicated that Gab2 deletion dramatically decreased the
number, maximum diameter, and volume of liver tumors
induced by DEN (Fig. 2B–D). Furthermore, the liver
weight-to-body weight ratio was employed to evaluate
tumor burden in mice. This ratio increased by almost
3-fold in WT mice after DEN treatment but was only
mildly increased in Gab2-KO mice (Fig. 2E).
Ki-67 and phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) are 2 reliable bio-
markers of cell proliferation. Here, we analyzed their ex-
pression in whole liver tissue by IHC. Few hepatocytes
from WT or Gab2-KO mice without DEN treatment were
positive for Ki-67 and pH3 (Fig. 2G, H, left). Strikingly, the
number of Ki-67– and pH3-positive cells increased con-
siderably in liver tumor tissue after DEN treatment (Fig.
2G, H, upper right); however, there were fewer Ki-67– and
pH3-positive cells in liver tumor tissue from Gab2-KO
mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2G, H, lower right).
Statistical analysis indicated that Gab2 deletion signifi-
cantly decreased the number of positive cells for Ki-67 and
pH3 (Fig. 2I, J), which indicated that Gab2 mediates the
growth of hepatic carcinoma.
These observations indicate that knocking out Gab2
significantly inhibits the formation and growth of DEN-
induced primary hepatic carcinoma in mice as well as
suggest that Gab2 supports hepatic carcinogenesis.
Overexpression of Gab2 promotes the
carcinogenic behavior of hepatocytes
To further explore the mechanism by which Gab2 regu-
lates the carcinogenic behavior of hepatocytes, we con-
structed HepG2 cell lines that stably express GFP-tagged
Gab2 (Fig. 3B). We then investigated the effects of Gab2 on
the growth and migration of HCC cells. All cells were
cultured for 3 d, and the number of cells was measured
daily by using an MTT assay. HepG2 cells have a nice
growth curve (Fig. 3A, black and blue lines); however, the
number of EGFP-Gab2 cells was markedly higher than
that of EGFP cells on d 2 and 3 (Fig. 3A, red and brown
lines), which suggested that Gab2 overexpression en-
hanced HCC cell growth rate. When intracellular Gab2
wasknockeddownin these cellsbyusingsmall interfering
RNA, however, the growth rate decreased to the basal
level of HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A, green line).
Furthermore, we detected the impact of Gab2 on liver
cancer cell migration in a migration chamber assay. After
incubation for 24 h, some HepG2 cells migrated from the
upper surface to the bottom of the chamber (Fig. 3C, top
left, purple cells); however, EGFP-Gab2 cells were more
migratory than EGFP control cells (Fig. 3C, bottom left),
which indicates that Gab2 overexpression promotes HCC
cell migration. As expected, the positive effect of Gab2

 on cell migration was abolished by RNA interference–
mediated Gab2 knockdown (Fig. 3C, bottom right com-
pared with top right). Quantification of migratory cells
confirmed the above observation and demonstrated that
Gab2 overexpression significantly increased HepG2 cell
migration (Fig. 3D).
To further evaluate carcinogenic behavior, these cells
were injected into nude mice, and tumor formation was
monitored. Twenty days after cell inoculation, tumor
nodules in the mice were measured. Tumors in mice with
Gab2-overexpressing cells were much larger compared
withthoseincontrolmice,but tumorsizewassignificantly
diminished when Gab2 was knocked down in Gab2-
overexpressing cells (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that
Gab2 promotes the development of HCC by enhancing
cell proliferation and migration.
Ablation of Gab2 impairs
hepatocellular carcinogenesis
In addition to overexpressing Gab2, we also analyzed the
effects of Gab2 deficiency on hepatic carcinogenesis. Gab2
was completely deleted in HepG2 cells by using CRISPR
technology. HepG2 cell lines that stably express Flag-
tagged Gab2 served as control. MTT assays demonstrated
that Gab2 overexpression still promoted liver cancer cell
growth, as previously described (Fig. 4A, red line com-
pared with blue line), but Gab2 deletion dramatically re-
strained HepG2 cell growth (Fig. 4B, blue line compared
with red line). Transwell migration assay indicated that
hepatoma cell migration was enhanced by Gab2 over-
expression but inhibited by Gab2 deletion (Fig. 4C, purple
cells). Moreover, we verified that Gab2 regulates cell mi-
gration by using another assay (a wound healing assay;
Fig. 4D–G). A linear wound was created in confluent cells
by using a pipette tip, and the healing rate within the

 wounded region was evaluated over time. The healing
rate of HepG2 cells was accelerated by Gab2 over-
expression (Fig. 4D–E), but attenuated by Gab2 KO (Fig.
4F). In addition, an apoptosis induction experiment also
confirmed the critical role of Gab2 on cell viability. Up-
regulation of Gab2 promoted, and knockdown of Gab2
repressed, the proportion of apoptotic cells under the
treatment of 5-fluorouracil (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Furthermore,thesecellswereinjectedintonudemice,and
tumor formation was evaluated. From d 6 after injection,
tumor size was measured every 4 d for a total of 20 d. At the
end of the experiment, tumors were removed from nude
mice. Tumors were largest in mice that had been injected
withcellsthatexpressedFlag-Gab2andsmallestinmicewith
Gab2-deleted cells (Px459-gRNA; Fig. 4G, H). We also eval-
uated tumor weights of the 4 groups. As observed, the
heaviest weight was measured in the Gab2 overexpression
groupandthelightestintheGab2-KOgroup(Fig.4I).Onthe
basis of the tumor growth curve, overexpression of Gab2 in
HepG2 cells markedly increased tumor growth, whereas the
deletion of Gab2 in HepG2 cells clearly suppressed tumor
development in nude mice (Fig. 4J).
These results indicate that Gab2 may promote the ini-
tiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
ERK, Akt, and Jak2 mediate Gab2-induced
HepG2 cell proliferation and migration
OurpreviousstudieshavedemonstratedthattheERK,PI3K-
Akt, and Socs3-Stat3 pathways are involved in the Gab2
regulatorynetworkinfattyliverpathogenesis.Toexplorethe
underlyingmechanismofGab2-mediatedtumorcellgrowth
and invasion, we determined the influence of the ERK, Akt,
and Jak2 pathway inhibitors on the tumor-promoting ac-
tivity of Gab2. First, HepG2 cell growth was measured with
MTT assay. The number of cells that stably express Flag-
Gab2 was notably higher than that of controls (Flag-only cell
line) afterincubation for3 or 4d (Fig.5A–C); however, when
cells were pretreated with PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), wort-
mannin (PI3K inhibitor), or AG490 (Jak2 inhibitor), the
number of Flag-Gab2 cells was not obviously increased
comparedwiththatofcontrolcellsond3and4ofincubation
(Fig. 5A–C), which suggested that Gab2 promoted HepG2
cellgrowthbutthatpretreatmentwithanMEK,PI3K,orJak2
inhibitor inhibited the protumorigenic effects of Gab2. Sec-
ond, cancer cell migration was examined with a transwell
assay. Pretreatment with PD98059, wortmannin, or AG490
notably suppressed Flag-Gab2–mediated cell migration on
the basis of the number of transfer cells (Fig. 5D). These re-
sults indicate that the ERK, Akt, and Jak pathways are po-
tentially involved in the mechanism by which Gab2
regulates hepatic carcinogenesis.

 hyperplasia in the liver. Here, we observed a marked in-
flammatory response in liver tissue from DEN-treated
mice (Fig. 6A). In the liver tissue from DEN-treated WT
mice without a tumor, the trabecular architecture was al-
most completely lost and was filled with inflammatory
infiltrates and eosin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig.
6A, middle and bottom left); however, in DEN-treated
Gab2-KO mice, paracarcinoma tissue retained the typical
trabecular structure, and only little inflammatory infil-
trates and fewer/smaller eosinophilic vacuoles of de-
generation were present (Fig. 6A, middle and bottom
right). Furthermore, we ascertained the levels of the in-
flammatory chemokines, IL-6 and TNF-a, in serum and
paracarcinoma tissues. ELISA analysis demonstrated that
Gab2 deletion significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF-a con-
centrations in serum compared with control (DEN-treated
WTanimals; Fig. 6B, C).Quantitative PCR results revealed
that knocking out Gab2 inhibited IL-6 and TNF-a tran-
scription in paracarcinoma tissues (Fig. 6D, E). In addition,
we also performed IHC staining with inflammatory cell
markers to support our findings. As indicated in Fig. 6F,
NF-kB protein expression demonstrated low expression
and was localized in the cytoplasm in saline-treated WT
and Gab2-KO mice; however, under the stimulation of

 of CD68, a cell surface marker of macrophages, we also
observed that CD68+ cells were robustly increased with
treatment with DEN compared with the saline-treated
group;however,therewereobviouslyasmallernumberof
CD68+ cells in the Gab2-KO group than in the WT group
that was treated with DEN (Fig. 6G, right). These results
indicate that knocking out Gab2 suppresses inflammatory
lesions, cytokine production, and inflammatory cell for-
mation in hepatic carcinogenesis.
To define the role of Gab2 in hepatic inflammatory
signal transduction, we investigated the effect of Gab2 on
the IL-6 signaling pathway. HepG2 cells were cultured
without serumfor12h,thentreatedwith50ng/mlIL-6for
1, 3, and 6 h. In control cells, Jak2 and Stat3 phosphoryla-
tion was observed at 1 h, but disappeared by 3 h after IL-6
stimulation (Fig. 7A, left 4 columns); however, in Gab2-
overexpressing cells, IL-6–induced phosphorylation of
Jak2 and Stat3 was significantly increased at 1 h, and Jak2
phosphorylation remained high at 3 h after IL-6 in-
duction (Fig. 7A, 6th column in the 1st and 3rd top
panels). Conversely, IL-6–induced phosphorylation of
Jak2 and Stat3 was remarkably decreased when Gab2
was knocked out in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7B, 6th column
compared with 2nd column in the 1st and 3rd top pan-
els). Of interest, we observed moderate up-regulation of
Gab2 in empty vector transfected cells after IL-6 treat-
ment (Fig. 7A, B, left 4 columns). It is possible that this
reflects an up-regulation of endogenous Gab2 in re-
sponse to IL-6, which indicates that Gab2 might directly
mediate IL-6 signaling by regulating Jak2 and Stat3
phosphorylation in hepatocarcinoma cells. Of impor-
tance, we found that Jak2 was a key interactant of Gab2
in hepatoma cells. Without stimulation, forced ex-
pression of Gab2 robustly enhanced the binding of
Jak2 to Gab2. IL-6 treatment could further strengthen
the interaction between Jak2 and Gab2 in Gab2-
overexpressing cells (Fig. 7C). These findings in-
dicate that Gab2 modulates IL-6–mediated the Jak2/
Stat3 signaling pathway, potentially via interaction
with Jak2.
To further understand the effect of Gab2 on IL-6
signaling, we analyzed mRNA levels of downstream
target genes. Gab2 overexpression enhanced the IL-6–
stimulated expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2),
c-Myc, and MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7), which
are involved in cell growth, apoptosis, survival, and
migration induced by IL-6 (Fig. 7D). As expected, Gab2
ablation significantly inhibited the IL-6–stimulated ex-
pression of these genes (Fig. 7E). Consistently, we also
observed an increased expression of the Bcl-2, c-Myc,
cyclinD1, and MMP7 target genes in primary liver
cancer tissue from DEN-treated mice (Fig. 7F, red col-
umns); however, the DEN-stimulated expression of
these genes was significantly restrained by the absence
of Gab2 (Fig. 7F, green columns). These results suggest
that Gab2 protein levels affect the expression of certain
downstream target genes that are regulated by Stat3
and also confirm that Gab2 is involved in the IL-6–
induced Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway. On the basis of
theseobservations,Gab2mightparticipateinIL-6–induced
signaling during hepatic inflammatory responses.
DISCUSSION
Hepatocellular carcinogenesis is an extremely elusive
and complex process that involves numerous intricate
mechanisms, which greatly hampers the development of
effective therapies for HCC (25). The present study defines
the oncogenic regulation by Gab2 by using animal models
and stable cell lines and provides powerful evidence that
supports the use of Gab2 as a potential therapeutic target
for the treatment of HCC.
In this study, we evaluated Gab2 expression in fresh
HCC tissue and tissue microarrays and found that Gab2
was overexpressed in ;60 to 70% of HCC samples, but
had low expression in paracarcinoma or normal liver tis-
sue. These findings indicate that Gab2 might be a tumor-
associated protein. Two recent studies investigated Gab2
expression in HCC samples and confirm our results (26,
27). Gab2 is also associated with tumor behavior in other
types of malignancies, such as breast cancer (28), mela-
noma (29), ovarian cancer (30), lung cancer (31), glioma
(32), and gastric cancer (33). For instance, 57% of estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer specimens have high Gab2
expression compared with normal breast tissue (34). In-
creased Gab2 DNA copy number and gene amplification
are present in a subset of melanoma samples (35). In
addition, Gab2 mRNA and protein expression is notably
up-regulated in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma—a
subtype of ovarian adenocarcinoma with poor survival—
compared with normal ovarian tissue (36, 37).
Furthermore, we defined the oncogenic role of Gab2 by
using transgenic mouse models and HCC cell lines. De-
letion of Gab2 blocked DEN-induced primary liver cancer
in mice. Overexpression of Gab2 in HCC cells promoted
proliferation, migration, and xenograft tumor growth in
nude mice, whereas Gab2 deficiency impaired these on-
cogenic effects in HepG2 cells. Of interest, oncogenic reg-
ulation by Gab2 also occurs in other types of tumors.
Up-regulation of Gab2 in MCF-10A cells contributes to
increased proliferation and metastasis in a manner that is
dependent on EGF and other growth factors (28, 34, 38).
Forced expression of Gab2 can promote the proliferation
and invasion of melanoma and breast cancer cells (35, 39).
Overexpression of Gab2 promotes tumor angiogenesis
by increasing the expression of multiple chemokines in
ovarian cancer (40), and Gab2 also promotes the growth of
cancer cells in lung cancer (41) and glioma (42).
Gab2 is a signal docking protein that recruits several
intracellular signaling pathways. In carcinogenesis, Gab2
engages various signaling pathways in different types of
cancer. Gab2 can recruit Shp2 to activate Ras/ERK sig-
naling in breast cancer and melanoma (43, 44), and the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been reported to be
modulated by Gab2 in breast cancer (45), ovarian cancer
(30, 37), and melanoma (46). Gab2 is also required for Bcr-
Abl–mediated myeloid and lymphoid transformation by
affecting the Shp2/Stat5 and Jak/Stat signaling networks
(47–50). Moreover, Gab2 contributes to the angiogenic
switch by increasing hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and
VEGF levels in melanoma (29). In glioblastoma, both
miRNA-197 and miR125a-5p inhibit glioma cell pro-
liferation and invasion by negatively regulating Gab2

 (51, 52). In the present study, inhibitors of PI3K, MEK, or
Jak2 significantly suppressed Gab2-mediated HepG2 cell
proliferation and migration. In addition, our previous
study demonstrated that Gab2 could interact with PI3K,
Socs3, and Shp2 in HepG2 cells upon treatment with eth-
anol or oleic acid, which were also the carcinogenic factors
of liver cancer (22). These results thus suggest that Gab2
integrates multiple signaling molecules to regulate the
development of HCC.
Inflammation is a main inducer of cancer, especially
liver cancer. A high percentage of HCC cases derive from
hepatitis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that Gab2
mediates steatohepatitis. Here, the ablation of Gab2 at-
tenuated the inflammatory response in DEN-induced
primary liver cancer in mice and decreased the production
of inflammatory cytokines and the quantity of macro-
phages. Thus, Gab2 mediates the inflammatory response
in liver tissue and is involved in the development of
hepatitis-induced liver cancer. Furthermore, we evaluated
theeffectsof Gab2on signaltransduction byinflammatory
cytokines and found that Gab2 mediated IL-6–activated
Jak2/Stat3 signaling and regulated the expression of
downstream IL-6 target genes. In addition, the Jak2 in-
hibitor, AG490, markedly restrained the ability of Gab2 to
promote hepatoma cell proliferation and metastasis. IL-6
is a typical inflammatory cytokine that stimulates inflam-
mation and autoimmune responses in many diseases, in-
cluding diabetes (53), Alzheimer’s disease (54), and some
tumors (55, 56). The Jak/Stat pathway is a key signaling
pathway that transduces signals from inflammatory fac-
tors, including such inflammatory cytokines as IL-6, to
modulate the inflammatory response. Most studies have
confirmed that aberrant IL-6–Jak/Stat signaling facili-
tates HCC progression (57, 58). Our results demonstrate
thatGab2mediatestheinflammatoryresponseinducedby
IL-6 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and shed light on
the mechanism by which Gab2 regulates inflammatory
signaling.
In summary, this study demonstrated that Gab2 is a
cancer-associated protein that plays an oncogenic role in
hepatocellular carcinogenesis by integrating multiple sig-
naling pathways, especially those that are modulated by
inflammatory factors; therefore, the signaling adaptor
protein, Gab2, may be a powerful, novel target for the
prevention and treatment of liver cancer.
