Protecting the fetus from the hematogenous spread of viruses
requires multifaceted layers of protection and relies heavily on
trophoblasts, the fetal-derived cells that comprise the placental
barrier. We showed previously that trophoblasts isolated from
full-term placentas resist infection by diverse viruses, including
Zika virus (ZIKV), and transfer this resistance to nonplacental cells
through the activity of paracrine effectors, including the constitu-
tive release of type III interferons (IFNs). Here, we developed 3D
cell-line–based models of human syncytiotrophoblasts, cells that
lie in direct contact with maternal blood, and show that these cells
recapitulate the antiviral properties of primary trophoblasts
through the constitutive release of type III IFNs (IFNλ1 and IFNλ2)
and become resistant to ZIKV infection. In addition, using organo-
typic human midgestation chorionic villous explants, we show
that syncytiotrophoblasts isolated from the second trimester of
pregnancy also constitutively release type III IFNs and use these
IFNs in autocrine and paracrine manners to restrict ZIKV infection.
Collectively, these data provide important insights into the de-
fense mechanisms used by syncytiotrophoblasts at various stages
of human gestation to resist ZIKV infection and new human mod-
els to study the role of type III IFNs in the vertical transmission of
ZIKV and other viruses associated with congenital disease.

T
he human placenta functions as a barrier and conduit be-
tween the maternal and fetal environments and protects the
fetus from the hematogenous spread of microorganisms (reviewed
in ref. 1). Covering the surfaces of the human placental villous trees
is the syncytiotrophoblast (SYN), a multinucleated and terminally
differentiated cell layer that is formed by the fusion of mononuclear
cytotrophoblasts (CYTs) located beneath the outer SYN layer.
Modeling the complex nature of the human placenta in vitro has
remained a challenge, particularly with respect to viral infections.
For example, whereas trophoblast cell lines are permissive to viral
infections, primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells isolated from
full-term placentas resist infection by diverse viruses (2–4). In ad-
dition, PHT cells transfer viral resistance to nonplacental cells
through the release of paracrine effectors, including through the
constitutive release of type III IFNs, IFNλ1–3, and miRNAs
packaged in microvesicles (2–5). Cultured trophoblast cell lines lack
these paracrine effector pathways and, in contrast to PHT cells, do
not confer paracrine-mediated antiviral effects (3, 4).
Over recent years, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections of pregnant
women have been directly associated with microcephaly and
other fetal disorders (reviewed in ref. 6). It remains unclear how
ZIKV gains access to the fetal compartment or evades SYN-
associated antiviral pathways. Recent small-animal models
have provided in vivo systems to model fetal ZIKV infection
(reviewed in ref. 6). However, mouse models require the absence
of important maternal immune pathways or infection with high
viral loads, and given differences in cellular composition and
anatomy between the mouse and human placentas (reviewed in
ref. 7), directly correlating these findings with human trans-
placental transmission may be difficult. Thus, there remains a
critical need to develop new models of the human placenta to
study the mechanisms of ZIKV vertical transmission and the
cell-intrinsic defense pathways by which SYNs restrict infection
to limit fetal infection.
In the present study, we developed 3D cell- and tissue-based
models to assess the role of type III IFNs in the susceptibility
of SYNs to ZIKV infections at various gestational stages. We
show that 3D-cultured trophoblast JEG-3 cells become re-
sistant to ZIKV infection and constitutively release the type III
IFNs, IFNλ1 and IFNλ2, to restrict ZIKV infections in both
autocrine and paracrine manners. To correlate these observa-
tions with earlier stages of gestation, when fetal infections often
result in more severe disease, we also developed a human
midgestation organotypic chorionic villous explant model and
show that type III IFNs are constitutively released from SYNs
during the second trimester of human pregnancy and play im-
portant roles in SYN-mediated autocrine and paracrine anti-
viral pathways. Collectively, these data provide important
insights into and new models by which to study the role of type
III IFN signaling in the restriction of ZIKV infections in the
human placenta.
Significance
Little is known about the specific mechanisms by which viruses
associated with congenital disease, such as Zika virus (ZIKV),
breach the placental barrier to access the fetal compartment.
This is at least in part because of the lack of appropriate sys-
tems to model the unique properties of human placental syn-
cytiotrophoblasts, which form a key cellular interface between
the maternal and fetal compartments. Here, we describe the
development of new organotypic models of human syncytio-
trophoblasts that can be used to study the innate defense
mechanisms used by these cells to restrict ZIKV infection at
various stages of human gestation. These models can be used
to study the mechanisms of ZIKV vertical transmission, the
development of ZIKV diagnostics, and the testing of anti-
ZIKV therapeutics.

 Results
Establishment of 3D Primary Placental Fibroblast Coculture System.
To establish 3D models of JEG-3 cells, we used a rotating wall
vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Previously, we generated a 3D JEG-3–
based trophoblast model using JEG-3 cells cocultured with im-
mortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (8) that are
grown for ∼21 d on a RWV bioreactor that attaches to slow-
turning lateral vessels (STLV), which are filled with cell culture
medium (CM) and contain cells attached to porous, collagen-
coated dextran beads. This system exposes bead-associated cells
to shear stress while preventing bead sedimentation because of
constant vessel rotation. Although we showed previously that the
endothelial cells used in this model were largely displaced by
JEG-3 cells during the culture period (8), it remained unclear
what impact, if any, nontrophoblast cells present at the end of
the culture period had on the expression and secretory pheno-
types of these cultures. Thus, to further validate and improve
upon this model, we developed an additional coculture system
using primary placental fibroblasts isolated from full-term pla-
centas to generate a parallel coculture model using a more
physiologically relevant cell type. Parallel systems therefore al-
low us to directly compare findings from two independent
models and to verify that findings from these models are not
because of the presence of nontrophoblast cells.
To establish these models, Cytodex-3 beads were cultured with
endothelial cells (3DE) or primary placental fibroblasts (3DF) for
3 d in a STLV, at which time JEG-3 cells were added and cul-
tured for an additional 17 d (Fig. S1A). Consistent with our
previous findings with endothelial cells (8), we found that JEG-3
cells displaced placental fibroblasts from beads, which corre-
sponded with an enrichment of cytokeratin-19+ (a marker of
epithelial-derived cells) trophoblasts at the end of the culture
period (Fig. S1B). Importantly, we also found that unlike JEG-3
cells cultured on beads under static conditions (8), 3DF and 3DE
cultures formed syncytia, (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B) and produced
human CG β (βhCG), an isoform of hCG specifically produced by
SYNs, with levels similar to those observed in PHT cells isolated
from full-term placentas (Fig. S1C).
Next, we profiled the transcriptional changes induced in 3DF
and 3DE cultures and compared these changes to 2D-cultured
cells or to PHT cells using RNASeq followed by differential
expression analysis using DeSeq2 (9). Using this approach, we
identified the differential expression of transcripts between 2D-
cultured JEG-3 cells and either 3DE, 3DF, or PHT cells (Fig.
1B), some of which were validated by qRT-PCR at both early
(24 h) and later (96 h) times following removal from the STLV
(Fig. S2). Of these differentially expressed genes, 798 were
shared between 3DF, 3DE, and PHT cells (Fig. S3A). Impor-
tantly, culturing in 3D induced the expression of several SYN-
enriched transcripts (such as pregnancy-specific glycoproteins
and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2), which were not expressed
or were expressed at low levels in 2D-cultured JEG-3 cells (Fig.
S3C). Importantly, these transcripts were induced in both 3DE and
3DF cultures and therefore likely do not result from any remaining
nontrophoblast cells at the end of the culture period. Collectively,
these data show that parallel 3D coculture models of JEG-3
cells form syncytia and induce the expression of select SYN-
associated transcripts independent from the cell type used to
establish the cultures.
JEG-3 Cells Cultured in 3D and Removed from Beads Retain SYN-Like
Phenotypes. An inherent limitation of RWV bioreactor-based
models is the requirement to culture cells on beads, which limits
some downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, we
optimized the enzyme-mediated removal of 3DF and 3DE cul-
tured JEG-3 cells from Cytodex beads following their culturing
on the RWV bioreactor and determined whether this removal
influenced their phenotypes (schematic in Fig. S4A). We found
that cells removed from beads retained syncytia, or the ability to
fuse to form SYNs in culture, from both 3DF (termed 3DTryp-F)

 and 3DE (termed 3DTryp-E) cultures (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4B). Using
RNASeq, we also found that 3DTryp cells retained transcriptional
profiles similar to cells cultured in the STLV for up to 5 d post-
removal, including retaining the expression of 403 transcripts that
were differentially expressed from 2D-cultured JEG-3 cells (a
subset of shared transcripts are shown in Fig. 1D and Fig. S4C),
and the enrichment of common pathways as assessed by gene-set
enrichment analysis (Fig. S4 D and E).
JEG-3 Cells Cultured in 3D Become Resistant to ZIKV Infection. We
showed previously that PHT cells exhibit low susceptibility to ZIKV
infection (3). Given that 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells fuse to form
syncytia and develop a transcriptional profile more similar to
PHT cells, we next determined whether these cultures also resist
ZIKV infection. We found that 3DF- and 3DE-cultured JEG-3 cells
exhibited reduced susceptibility to infection by either a Cambodian
strain of ZIKV, FSS13025 (ZIKVC), or a strain that circulated in
Brazil in 2015, Paraiba 2015 (ZIKVB), which correlated with sig-
nificant reductions (up to 1,000-fold) in viral titers (Fig. 2 A and B).
Both 3DTryp-F and 3DTryp-E cells also exhibited reduced suscepti-
bility to ZIKV infection, although they were more susceptible than
cells that had not been removed from beads (Fig. 2 A and B).
Similar to PHT cells, we also found that conditioned medium iso-
lated from 3D-cultured cells, either immediately following removal
from the STLV (vessel), after culturing on beads under static con-
ditions for 3 d (static), or removed from beads (3DTryp) inhibited
ZIKV infection in nonplacental cells (human brain microvascular
endothelial cells, HBMEC) (Fig. 2C), suggesting that these cells
also produce paracrine effectors that restrict viral infections.
JEG-3 Cells Cultured in 3D Constitutively Release Type III IFNs, Which
Are Involved in Their Protection from ZIKV Infection. To determine
the pathways and factors responsible for the reduction in ZIKV
infection in 3D-cultured cells, we profiled the transcriptional
changes induced by ZIKV infection in JEG-3 cells cultured in 2D
or 3D by RNASeq (Fig. S5A, Upper). Consistent with our previous
work (3), we found that JEG-3 cells cultured in 2D and infected
with ZIKV (ZIKVC or ZIKVB) robustly induced type III IFNs
(IFNλ1–3), with a less robust induction of type I IFNs (IFNβ) (Fig.
S5A, Lower). In contrast, ZIKV infection of 3D-cultured JEG-3
cells had no effect on the expression of IFNs (either type I or III)
(Fig. S5A, Lower). However, we found that 3DF and 3DE cells
basally expressed high levels of many IFN stimulated genes (ISGs)
also highly expressed in PHT cells, including several IFN-inducible
proteins (IFI16, IFI27, IFIH1), IFN induced transmembrane
protein 1 and 2 (IFITM1 and IFITM2), and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
synthetases (OAS), which were also highly expressed in 3DTryp
cells (Fig. S5B).
The high basal expression of ISGs in 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells,
coupled with their resistance to ZIKV infection and antiviral
activity of their CM, suggested that these cells also release ISG-
inducing effectors. To determine whether 3D-cultured JEG-3
cells release IFNs or other antiviral cytokines, we performed
multiplex immunoassays using Luminex magnetic beads for 37
analytes. Using this approach, we identified cytokines that were
secreted from PHT cells, and which were also released by 3D-
cultured cells and 3DTryp cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, these studies
revealed that both IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 were released from 3DF, 3DE,
and 3DTryp cells, to levels near equivalent to those released from
PHT cells (Fig. 3 A and B).
Next, we explored the impact of type III IFNs in the paracrine
and autocrine-mediated antiviral effects of 3D-cultured JEG-3
cells. To do this, we first profiled the responsiveness of cells to type
I and III IFNs and then determined whether these cells responded
to the antiviral effects of this treatment or to the antiviral effects of
3D-derived CM. For these studies, we used human osteosarcoma
U2OS cells, which are responsive to type III IFNs, and human
monocyte THP-1 cells and primary placental fibroblasts, which do
not respond to type III IFNs (Fig. S5 C and D). Consistent with a
role for type III IFN signaling in the paracrine-mediated effects of
3D JEG-3 CM, we found that ZIKV infection was suppressed in
U2OS cells following exposure, but that infection in placental fi-
broblasts was unaffected (Fig. 3C). In addition, CM did not sup-
press ZIKV infection in THP-1 cells and instead led to a significant
enhancement of infection (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained
with CM isolated from PHT cells (Fig. 3C). Next, to inhibit IFNλ-
mediated paracrine signaling in recipient cells exposed to CM, we
used neutralizing antibodies against type III IFNs and found that
neutralizing antibodies against IFNλ1 and IFNλ2/3 led to an en-
hancement of ZIKV infection in cells exposed to CM from
PHT cells and 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells (Fig. 3D). Finally, to assess
the impact of autocrine-mediated type III IFN signaling on the
protection of 3D-cultured cells with ZIKV infection, we treated
cells with the Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib for 24 h
in the STLV before bead removal and subsequent infection. We
found that ruxolitinib treatment inhibited ISG induction following
treatment of 3D-cultured cells with recombinant type I (IFNβ) or
type III (IFNλ1) IFNs (Fig. S5E). We also found that this treat-
ment reduced the high basal expression of the ISG OASL (Fig.
S5F). Lastly, we found that ruxolitinib treatment significantly en-
hanced the levels of ZIKVB vRNA production in 3D-cultured cells
and led to an almost 100-fold enhancement in ZIKV infectious
titers (Fig. 3E). Given that ZIKV infection of 3D-cultured cells has
no impact on the expression of IFNs or in the induction of ISGs
(Fig. S5A), these results suggest that the autocrine-mediated effects
of constitutively released type III IFNs protect 3D-cultured cells
from ZIKV infection.

 cells, which are isolated from full-term placentas. However,
whether this model also recapitulates earlier stages of gestation,
or whether type III IFNs also play a role at these stages of preg-
nancy, is unknown. Therefore, we established an explant model of
human chorionic villous trees isolated from second-trimester pla-
centas (between ∼17- and 23-wk gestation). Isolated villi retained
the morphology of human placental villi in vivo (Fig. 4A), in-
cluding a continuous layer of SYNs covering the villous tree
surfaces that express the endogenous retrovirus fusion protein
syncytin (HERV-W) and microvilli on their apical surfaces, as
assessed by immunofluorescence staining for villin (Fig. S6A).
In addition, isolated villi produced high levels of βhCG (Fig. S6B).
To determine whether SYNs from second-trimester chorionic
villi are susceptible to ZIKV infection, we assessed the production
of infectious viral RNA (vRNA) and infectious progeny. Consis-
tent with the work of others in ex vivo explants (10) and human
tissue (11, 12), we found that second-trimester SYNs were largely
resistant to ZIKV infection, with no vRNA detectable by immu-
nofluorescence microscopy for double-strand RNA (dsRNA) (Fig.
S6C) and low to undetectable levels of infectious viral particles
(Fig. 4B). Indeed, of villi isolated from 10 different midgestation
placental preparations, three produced detectable levels of in-
fectious ZIKV (Fig. 4B), but we were unable to locate vRNA in
SYNs in any of these villi (Fig. S6C). In addition, we found that CM
isolated from second-trimester villous explants suppressed ZIKV
infection in nonplacental cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that paracrine
effectors that restrict viral infections are also produced early in
gestation. Consistent with this, we found that villi isolated from
12 different second-trimester placentas all produced IFNλ1 to levels
like those observed in PHT cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent with a role
for autocrine- and paracrine-mediated IFNλ signaling in the pro-
tection of midgestation placentas from ZIKV infection, we also
found that isolated villi basally express high levels of ISGs to levels
like those observed in both 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells and PHT cells
as assessed by RNASeq analysis from three different placental
preparations (Fig. 4D).
To determine whether IFNλs constitutively released from midg-
estation chorionic villi protect the human placenta from ZIKV
infection in an autocrine manner, we treated isolated villi with
ruxolitinib and determined whether this treatment reduced basal
ISG expression and sensitized tissue to ZIKV infection. We found
that ruxolitinib reduced the basal expression of OASL (by ∼50%)
and concomitantly enhanced the levels of ZIKV vRNA (∼25-
fold) in villi isolated from four independent placentas (Fig. 4F).
Collectively, these data support a role for type III IFN signaling
in the protection of the human placenta from ZIKV infection
during the second trimester of pregnancy.

 Discussion
Very little is known about the mechanisms by which viruses as-
sociated with congenital disease cross the placental barrier to
access the fetal compartment. Here, we generated tractable cell-
line–based models and a second-trimester chorionic villi explant
model that can be used to elucidate the trophoblast-mediated
innate pathways that limit viral vertical transmission. These
models revealed that type III IFNs are constitutively produced by
SYNs at various stages of gestation and play important roles in
protecting the human placenta from ZIKV infection in both
autocrine and paracrine manners. The models we describe thus
not only inform our understanding of the processes by which the
human placenta restricts viral infections during various stages of
pregnancy, but also provide human cell-based platforms that
can be used to test the effectiveness of therapeutics aimed at
restricting viral vertical transmission.
The release of IFNλs specifically from 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells
suggests that syncytia formation is a prerequisite for the initiation
of this process. However, syncytia formation in forskolin-treated
BeWo cells is not sufficient to induce IFNλ release (3), suggesting
that more than fusion alone is required. It is unknown whether
the JEG-3–based 3D system we describe induces syncytia forma-
tion by a pathway that more closely resembles that which occurs in
vivo, but the induction of IFNλ release suggests that this might
be the case and points to specific factors or pathways that must
be stimulated to induce a cascade of events culminating in IFNλ
production. Whether the shear stress initiated by culturing cells
in 3D is responsible for this fusion and subsequent IFNλ release
seems likely, given that parallel models respond to STLV-based
culturing by releasing type III IFNs. In support of the possible
importance of shear stress in SYN formation and function, once
maternal spiral arteries are formed (toward the end of the first
trimester), the intervillous space (IVS) becomes filled with

MICROBIOLOGY
 maternal blood, which exposes the surfaces of placental villi to
shear forces. It is unknown whether trophoblasts cultured in the
RWV bioreactor are exposed to the shear forces that mimic those
of the placenta in vivo, given difficulties in assessing the shear
forces within the IVS during human pregnancy, but our findings
implicate CYT-to-SYN fusion as a critical determinant for IFNλ
release, which is supported by our previous work in PHT cells (3).
Type III IFNs have been shown to stimulate ISG expression in
response to viral infection in a number of cell types, including ep-
ithelial cells of the respiratory (13, 14) and gastrointestinal (15, 16)
tracts, hepatocytes (17), and endothelial cells of the blood–brain
barrier (18). However, unlike these cell types, human SYNs con-
stitutively release IFNλs in the absence of viral infections, which
correlates with the high constitutive expression of ISGs that pre-
sumably confers a persistent antiviral state in these cells. Our results
suggest that type III IFNs constitutively secreted by the human
placenta at both mid and late stages of gestation play an important
role in the autocrine- and paracrine-mediated protection of cells at
the maternal–fetal interface from viral infections. However, given
that stem-cell–derived models of the undifferentiated trophoblasts
that form very early postconception (primitive trophoblasts) are
permissive to ZIKV infection (19), it is unlikely that these cells
constitutively release type III IFNs. However, once these primitive
trophoblasts begin to differentiate, they become resistant to ZIKV
infection and express several ISGs (19). These data suggest that
once SYNs form (as early as 12-d gestation), type III IFNs may
become constitutively released to protect the developing embryo
from infection. Although our findings do not exclude the possi-
bility that SYNs mount other antiviral pathways, which is sup-
ported by our previous work (2, 4, 5), our findings implicate type
III IFNs as key regulators of the resistance of the human placenta
at both mid and late stages of human pregnancy from viral in-
fections, including ZIKV.
The human placenta is a highly complex and unique organ. Our
data point to a direct role for type III IFNs in the protection of
human SYNs from viral infection at both mid and late stages of
human gestation and provide important in vitro models to study the
pathways and factors that mediate these effects. Defining the con-
tribution of antiviral pathways present in human SYNs is critical to
identify the possible mechanisms by which ZIKV and other viruses
associated with congenital infection bypass the placental barrier to
access the fetus.
Materials and Methods
Additional methods can be found in SI Materials and Methods.
RWV Bioreactor 3D Cultures. HBMEC or primary placental fibroblasts were
harvested in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and incubated with ∼300-mg collagen-
coated Cytodex-3 beads (Sigma) at 4 × 106 cells/300 mg beads in GTSF-2
medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), insulin-transferrin-
sodium selenite (0.5×) (Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin, sodium bicarbonate,
and amphotericin B (Gibco). After a brief static incubation (∼15–30 min) at
37 °C, the bead/cell slurry was added to autoclavable 55-mL STLVs and at-
tached to a rotating base (Synthecon) at 19–21 rpm to maintain the cells in
suspension for the duration of the culture period (21 d). Three days into the
culture period, JEG-3 cells were harvested and 8 × 106 cells were added. Vessels
were incubated under static conditions for 15–30 min before resuming rota-
tion. Cell culture medium was replenished every 48 h for the entirety of the
culture period. For removal of 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells (3-DTryp), cell-coated
beads were washed thoroughly in PBS and then incubated with 0.05% tryp-
sin/EDTA (3DF) or 1× TryPLE Express (Gibco) (3DE) for ∼30 min at room tem-
perature, with frequent, gentle inversion. Following incubation, the cell/bead
slurry was passed through a 100-μM cell strainer to remove beads. Isolated
cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm on a Sorvall Legend RT
Plus Centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and enumerated using a Bio-Rad
TC20 Automated Cell Counter. Isolated cells (3DTryp) or an equal number of
bead-associated cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides for imaging or in
24-well plates for infection studies.
Human Placental Explants and Primary Cells. PHT cells and primary placental
fibroblasts were isolated from healthy singleton-term placentas were cul-
tured as described previously (3, 4, 20) under an exempt protocol approved
by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh. Human
fetal placental tissue from less than 24-wk gestation that resulted from
elective terminations were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh
Health Sciences Tissue Bank through an honest broker system after approval
from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and in accor-
dance with the University of Pittsburgh’s tissue procurement guidelines.
Chorionic villi were dissected and cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented
with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B for between
24 and 96 h. For infections, isolated villi were infected immediately follow-
ing isolation with 5 × 105 fluorescent focus unit (FFU)/mL ZIKVB for 72 h. For
imaging, villi were fixed and imaging performed as detailed in SI Materials
and Methods.
Statistics. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Ex-
periments were performed at least three times from at least two independent
STLVs or explants isolated from three independent placentas, as indicated in
the figure legends. Data are presented as mean ± SD. A Student’s t test was
used to determine statistical significance when two sets were compared and
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction used for post hoc multiple
comparisons was used to determine statistical significance. Specific P values
are detailed in the figure legends.
