Abstract
Objective—To investigate the heterogeneity of temporal patterns of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) 
over the menopausal transition and to identify factors associated with these patterns in a diverse 
sample of women.
Methods—The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a multi-site longitudinal study of 
women from five racial/ethnic groups transitioning through the menopause. The analytic sample 
included 1455 women with non-surgical menopause and a median follow-up of 15.4 years. 
Temporal patterns of VMS and associations with serum estradiol and follicle stimulation hormone, 
race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and demographic and psychosocial factors were examined 
using group-based trajectory modeling.
Results—Four distinct trajectories of VMS were found: onset early (11 years prior to the final 
menstrual period (FMP)) with decline after menopause (Early onset, 18.4%); onset near the FMP 
with later decline (Late onset, 29.0%), onset early with persistently high frequency (High, 25.6%); 
and persistently low frequency (Low, 27.0%). Relative to women with persistently Low frequency 
of VMS, women with persistently High and Early onset VMS had a more adverse psychosocial 
and health profile. Black women were overrepresented in the Late onset and High VMS subgroups 
relative to white women. Obese women were underrepresented in the Late onset subgroup. In 
multivariable models, the pattern of estradiol over the menopause was significantly associated with 
the VMS trajectory.
Conclusions—These data demonstrate distinctly heterogeneous patterns of menopausal 
symptoms which are associated with race/ethnicity, reproductive hormones, pre-menopause BMI 
and psychosocial characteristics. Early targeted intervention may have a meaningful impact on 
long-term VMS.

Introduction
Vasomotor symptoms (VMS: hot flushes and night sweats), are the “classic” menopausal 
symptom. VMS are experienced by up to 80% of women 1, 2 and have a negative impact on 
women's quality of life during the menopause transition (MT).3 More than half of the 
women with VMS seek medical treatment for their symptoms.4
While prevalence of VMS is high during and after the MT, individual women have 
significant heterogeneity in the timing of onset and course of VMS,5 but variations across 
women in the patterns and time course of VMS over the MT have not been well

 characterized. Most studies investigating the time course of VMS have focused on the 
population average and have not considered the magnitude of the variation or attempted to 
identify risk factors that distinguish those women who experience various patterns of VMS. 
A study of 695 white women classified VMS severity into four profiles and identified self-
reported risk factors that related to the different profiles.6 Whether the variation exists 
among other racial/ethnic groups and with longer observation time is unknown.
Several hormonal, psychosocial, lifestyle, health and biological factors have been associated 
with occurrence of VMS. The occurrence of VMS coincides in most women with the decline 
of endogenous estrogen, most notably estradiol (E2), and a rise in follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) during midlife.7.8 Race/ethnicity, obesity, negative affect, socioeconomic 
status, and health status,5,6,9 are associated with the likelihood of reporting VMS. Whether 
these factor predict a particular trajectory pattern of VMS is not well investigated. The 
current study aimed to characterize the trajectories of VMS occurrence in a racially/
ethnically diverse cohort and identify individual factors related to variations in these 
trajectories. Such information will provide insight into the heterogeneous patterns of these 
highly prevalent and often bothersome menopausal symptoms and may help clinicians 
counsel women about their expected course and enhance women's ability to make informed 
decisions about their treatment.
Materials and Methods
Sample and Procedures
The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is a multi-site longitudinal 
community-based study of women transitioning through the menopause from February 1996 
through April 2013. SWAN enrolled 3,302 women belonging to one of five predetermined 
racial/ethnic groups: White (n=1550), Black (n=935), Japanese (n=281), Chinese (n=250), 
and Hispanic (n=286). At the time of enrollment, women were aged 42-52 years, had their 
uterus and at least one ovary, were not using medications known to affect ovarian function, 
were not pregnant or lactating, and had at least one menstrual period in the 3 months prior to 
study entry. The SWAN cohort was recruited from seven clinical sites.10 Each site recruited 
non-Hispanic white women and one other racial/ethnic group. Black women were enrolled 
in Pittsburgh, Boston, Detroit, and Chicago, Japanese women in Los Angeles, Chinese 
women in Oakland, CA, and Hispanic women in Newark, NJ. Institutional review board 
approval for the study protocol was obtained at each clinical site; signed, written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants.
At the baseline visit and at thirteen follow-up visits, SWAN participants completed a 
standard protocol that included questionnaires, physical measures, and provision of blood 
samples. To characterize the trajectory of VMS relative to menopause stage, the current 
study was restricted to women who had an observable final menstrual period (FMP) 
(n=1790). The FMP was identified at the first visit when a woman had no menses for at least 
12 months, and the date of FMP was the date of the last reported menstrual period. Natural 
menopause was defined for women who did not have a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy 
and did not report any use of exogenous hormones 12 months before the FMP. The analysis 
included women who experienced natural menopause (n=1589) and women who stopped

 hormone use and had menstrual bleeding after a 6-month washout period and then at least 12 
consecutive months of amenorrhea (n=201).
Observations when participants were using hormone therapy over the MT were excluded 
from the analysis to avoid ambiguity in VMS reporting. Time was evaluated relative to the 
date of the FMP; observations ranged from 13 years before the FMP to 17 years after FMP. 
We excluded the extreme years with <100 observations to avoid small cell problems. Thus, 
the analysis period encompassed 12 years before to 15 years after the FMP. Finally, we 
excluded women who had missing baseline values for covariates: body mass index (BMI, 
n=22), educational attainment (n=14), alcohol use (n=88), smoking (n=36), general health 
status (n=120), menopause status (n=37), depressive symptoms (n=2), difficulty paying for 
basics (n=10) and symptom sensitivity (n=127). Our final analytic sample included 1455 
women with 17,814 observations, an average 12.2 observations per woman.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)—Women self-reported their VMS in two questions 
querying the presence and the frequency of hot flashes and night sweats over the prior two 
weeks. Women reporting any hot flashes or night sweats in the prior two weeks were 
considered as having VMS.
Covariates
E2 and FSH: Women provided fasting blood samples during the early follicular phase (days 
2-5 of the menstrual cycle) at each visit. For women who were unable to provide an early 
follicular phase sample or had ceased menstruating, a random fasting sample was obtained 
within 90 days of the recruitment anniversary date. Blood was prepared and serum shipped 
to the Clinical Ligand Assay Satellite Services (CLASS) Central Laboratory at the 
University of Michigan. E2 assays were conducted in duplicate and FSH assays in singlicate 
using an ACS-180 automated analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corporation, Norwood, MA). E2 
concentrations were measured with a modified, off-line ACS-180 (E2-6) immunoassay.11 
FSH concentrations were measured with a two-site chemiluminometric immunoassay.
Based on prior work,12 the dynamic change of E2 levels declining over the MT was 
characterized using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). Four E2 trajectory patterns 
were identified: 1) low level and slow declining (Low, slow decline, 15.1%); 2) low level 
with relatively flat decline (Low, flat, 40.5%); 3) high level and steep decline about 3 years 
before the FMP (High, early decline, 14.3%); and 4) high level and high peak then sharp 
decline before the FMP (High, high peak, 30.1%) (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 
1). The likelihood of experiencing a specific E2 trajectory was estimated for each woman; 
and the trajectory with the highest likelihood was identified as the most probable pattern for 
the woman. The trajectories of FSH over the MT in the current analyses showed FSH 
starting low and rising to different levels:12 1) low (9.4%), 2) medium (47.2%), and high 
(43.5%) (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2).
Baseline measures: At baseline, all participants were either pre- or early peri- menopausal. 
Pre-menopause was defined as bleeding in the 3 months before interview with no change in

 variability in the past year, and early perimenopause as bleeding in the past 3 months with 
increased variability in the past year. Height and weight were measured using a stadiometer 
and calibrated scales, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2). Body 
size at baseline was categorized as normal/underweight, overweight, or obese based on 
racial/ethnic-specific BMI cutpoints:13 BMI <25, 25-29.9, and ≥30 for white, black, and 
Hispanic women, BMI <23, 23-24.9, ≥25 for Japanese women,14,15 and BMI <24, 24-27.9, 
≥28 for Chinese women.16
Smoking history was adapted from the American Thoracic Society standard questions17 and 
analyzed as current vs. past/never smoking. Alcohol use was defined based on self-reported 
average alcohol consumption during the past year and categorized as none, light (<1 serving 
per week), moderate (1-7 servings per week), or heavy (>7 servings per week). Physical 
activity was measured as a continuous score adapted from the Kaiser Permanente Health 
Plan Activity Survey.18 Difficulty paying for basics (food, housing, and heat) was recorded 
as not hard, somewhat hard, or very hard and used to assess functional economic status.
Anxiety symptoms were assessed using four items19 to rate the frequency (0 (none) to 4 
(daily)) of anxiety-related symptoms (irritability, feeling tense or nervous, heart pounding or 
racing, or feeling fearful) in the past two weeks. The summed score ranged from 0 – 16, and 
scores in the highest quintile (score of ≥ 4) were defined as having anxiety.20 The four items 
in the anxiety score have been shown to be internally consistent (Cronbach α=0.77), and 
there was a strong association (Spearman r=0.71) between the anxiety score and the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Depressive symptoms were measured based on a 
20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) which has well-
established reliability and validity.21 Symptom sensitivity was a continuous measure of 
somatosensory amplification22 with higher scores indicating greater tendency to report 
somatic symptoms. The coefficient of reproducibility for this scale was reported to be 
0.85.22
Statistical Analysis
Following the group-based trajectory modeling approach,23,24,25 the trajectory of the 
longitudinal binary VMS outcomes was modeled as a function of time relative to FMP based 
on a logit distribution. The number of groups and corresponding shapes were determined by 
fit statistics (Bayesian Information Criterion) and reasonable scientific plausibility. Model fit 
was also checked graphically, comparing observed and estimated trajectory of outcome 
measures. The probability of belonging to each VMS trajectory group was estimated for 
each woman; the subgroup with the highest estimated probability was assigned to the 
woman.
Using multinomial logistic regression, the relationship of baseline covariates, age at FMP, 
and hormone trajectory indicators, to VMS trajectory group membership was investigated 
for E2 and FSH separately. All covariates as time-stable factors were included in the model. 
Adjusted odds ratios were reported to describe the association between belonging to a 
particular VMS trajectory group and participant characteristics. Analyses were conducted 
using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). SAS Proc Tra j24,25 was used for the modeling.

 Results
The median follow-up time of the study sample of 1455 women was 15.4 years and the 
median age of menopause was 52.2 years. Almost half the women (47.3%) were non-
Hispanic white, 25.8% black, 11.5% Japanese, 9.8% Chinese, and 5.6% Hispanic. At 
baseline, 43.6% of the women were early peri-menopausal, 40.5% were obese, and 14.4% 
were current smokers. While half of the women did not drink alcohol, 12.6% were heavy 
drinkers (Table 1).
Four distinct trajectory patterns for the occurrence of VMS were identified (Figure 1): 
27.0% of women had consistently low probability of VMS occurrence with a slight increase 
around the FMP (Low), and 25.6% had a persistently high probability of VMS throughout 
the MT (High). The other two VMS trajectories were distinguished as Early onset (18.4%), 
with the probability of VMS occurring well before FMP but decreasing immediately after 
the FMP, and Late onset (29.0%) for whom the probability of VMS sharply increased just 
after the FMP and decreased later.
Participant characteristics differed across VMS trajectory subgroups (Table 2). A number of 
sociodemographic, reproductive hormone, and psychosocial factors were significantly and 
independently associated with the VMS trajectories in multivariable models (Table 3). 
Relative to women in the low VMS group, women experiencing VMS early (Early onset 
VMS) were at a more advanced menopause stage at baseline, were older age at the time of 
FMP, had poorer health, and had higher baseline anxiety and depressive symptom scores; 
women experiencing VMS late (Late onset VMS) were more likely to be black, were less 
likely to have a flat E2 trajectory, were more likely to be current smokers, and were less 
likely to be obese. Women in the persistently High VMS group were characterized by less 
education, greater alcohol use, poorer health, higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, 
higher symptom sensitivity, more likely to be black and less likely to be Chinese, and a trend 
of having low levels of E2 before the FMP with gradual and slow decline over the MT. No 
adjusted associations were evident between VMS trajectory group and hormone use before 
the FMP, physical activity and financial strain.
When we included FSH trajectories in the group-based VMS trajectory model instead of E2 
trajectories, similar associations between participant characteristics and VMS trajectory 
subgroups were found (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3). FSH levels did not 
distinguish VMS subgroups with the exception of the High VMS subgroup being more 
likely to have high FSH levels (relative to the Low VMS group).
Discussion
In this large longitudinal observational study of a multi-racial/ethnic cohort of women 
transitioning through menopause, we identified four distinct patterns of VMS: women with a 
consistently low probability of having VMS throughout the MT, women with a consistently 
high probability of having VMS, women with early onset of VMS in the decade prior to the 
FMP with cessation thereafter, and women with late onset of VMS after the FMP with VMS 
gradually declining over most of the decade following the FMP. Relatively equal proportions

 of women exhibited the four distinct patterns of VMS. This work challenges the long held 
assumption that most women experience VMS for the few years around the FMP and then 
cease thereafter. Conversely, it shows that VMS patterns are heterogeneous and consistent 
with prior work,5 VMS typically last for a decade or longer.
Women's characteristics distinguished their likelihood of exhibiting specific VMS 
trajectories. Women with Late onset VMS were less likely to have a medium level and 
relatively flat E2 trajectory across the MT, suggesting that dynamic fluctuations in E2 may 
be relevant to the occurrence of VMS occurring directly around and following the FMP. 
There was a trend that consistently High VMS groups were more likely to have low levels of 
E2 across the MT, supporting the hypothesis that low levels of E2 are important for VMS 
occurrence, particularly VMS that occur early and persistently. Further, similar to prior 
reports, a greater rise in FSH levels was associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing 
VMS.7 The dynamics of E2 and VMS were correlated but not perfectly, consistent with 
clinical observations that women respond to different exogenous doses of E2 for VMS 
management and indicating E2 alone is not the complete mechanistic explanation for VMS 
symptoms.26,27 Changes in other reproductive hormone levels and/or intracellular and 
central nervous system processes that may be variably triggered by the hormone dynamics 
warrant further investigation to elucidate the biological basis of VMS.
In addition to hormonal factors, other factors distinguished the VMS trajectories. Women 
with Early onset VMS were more likely to have elevated baseline depressive symptoms and 
anxiety, poorer health and older age at menopause. This may reflect in part the heightened 
vulnerability to, perception of, and reporting of symptoms related to negative 
affect.28,29,30,31,32 In contrast, lower BMI, black race/ethnicity, and current smoking 
distinguished women in the Late onset VMS subgroup. Prior work has indicated that women 
with a higher BMI were more likely to report VMS,1,8 particularly in the pre- and early peri-
menopause, and that body fat may in fact be protective with respect to VMS later in the 
transition.13 Consistent with this notion, obese women were prevalent among the women 
experiencing VMS early (51.8%) or persistently highly throughout the MT (45.3%). 
Notably, women with the onset of their VMS late in the transition (Late onset subgroup) 
were significantly less likely to be obese (relative to the Low VMS subgroup). Smoking was 
important in Late onset VMS subgroup. Smoking has been reported to increase hot flashes 
probably by direct effect of nicotine binding to nicotinic receptors in the hypothalamus.33 
Notably, the women in the Late onset VMS group were both more often smokers and 
experienced a dramatic E2 decline immediately around the FMP.
Women in the consistently High VMS group were characterized by lower education and 
more moderate and heavy alcohol use, refining the understanding of previously noted 
educational gradients in VMS.1,28,34 Increased moderate and heavy alcohol use in this 
subgroup is consistent with observations that past alcohol consumption is associated with 
ever having VMS,35 which may result from thermoregulatory mechanisms that trigger hot 
flashes and sweating.36
Black women were over-represented in the persistently High VMS subgroup and the Late 
onset subgroups and Chinese women in the low VMS subgroup. The reason for these racial/

 ethnic differences is not fully understood. Black women have reported more persistent5 and 
more bothersome VMS.37 Many potential explanatory factors were controlled, including 
BMI, hormones, psychosocial factors, and socioeconomic factors. While BMI was 
controlled, body fat distribution was not considered, which vary by racial/ethnic group and 
are linked to VMS.38
These identified trajectories of VMS have been shown to be associated with subclinical 
cardiovascular disease.39 In other studies, the pattern of VMS has been shown to be 
associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in post-menopausal women.40 VMS 
patterns may be related to a variety of relevant clinical outcomes. Further investigation to 
clarify the potential impact of menopausal symptom presentation on subsequent morbidity 
and mortality is needed. Genetic factors may be involved and should be considered in future 
work, which may in turn inform development of novel pharmacogenetic regimens.
SWAN is one of the largest and longest racially/ethnically diverse prospective longitudinal 
studies of the MT, and our study sample had more than 12 annual observations per woman. 
The community-based study sample allows generalizability, and the use of standard 
instruments increases the validity of the study results. Group-based trajectory modeling took 
into account the heterogeneity of the study population and allowed us to identify statistically 
sound and scientifically plausible groupings. The availability of pre- and post-menopausal 
observations and within-woman duration allowed us to evaluate trajectories of VMS across 
the MT. Our consideration of racial/ethnic-specific definitions of overweight and obesity 
allowed us greater accuracy in the evaluation of BMI and its associations with VMS.
The study had limitations, including the annual serum blood draw that may have increased 
potential measurement error, especially when serum was obtained outside the early follicular 
phase. VMS were reported annually, which is a strength, but were recalled over the prior two 
weeks. While often used in epidemiologic studies, questionnaire measures of VMS are less 
desirable than diary or physiologic measures.41 Together, imprecision and underreporting of 
symptoms may have occurred.28 Women with surgical menopause were excluded from the 
analysis which precludes our findings’ application in these women. Finally, the relatively 
small numbers of women in certain racial/ethnic groups may limit the generalizability of 
findings in these groups and may have resulted in inadequate statistical power to detect some 
associations as statistically significant.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate that the occurrence in VMS has distinct temporal patterns that are 
not predicted by hormone use, physical activity, or financial hardship. However, hormones, 
race/ethnicity, BMI, education, smoking, drinking alcohol, general health status, anxiety and 
depression appear to have a strong relation to both the timing and the persistence of VMS in 
a diverse population of mid-aged women. Interventions to reduce VMS can both be tailored 
to address those specific factors contributing to her VMS and be targeted to women who are 
most affected by persistent and burdensome VMS across the MT. Information about a 
woman's race/ethnicity, hormonal status, overall health status, and psychosocial profile can 
help a woman predict what course her VMS may follow. Additional investigation into

vasomotor trajectories may allow for the development of new and effective behavioral and 
pharmacologic treatments tailored to these trajectories.
