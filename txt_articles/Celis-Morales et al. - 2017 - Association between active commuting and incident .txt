ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To investigate the association between active 
commuting and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
cancer, and all cause mortality.
Design
Prospective population based study. 
setting
UK Biobank.
PartiCiPants
263 540 participants (106 674 (52%) women; mean age 
52.6), recruited from 22 sites across the UK. The 
exposure variable was the mode of transport used 
(walking, cycling, mixed mode v non-active (car or 
public transport)) to commute to and from work on a 
typical day.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Incident (fatal and non-fatal) CVD and cancer, and 
deaths from CVD, cancer, or any causes.
results
2430 participants died (496 were related to CVD and 
1126 to cancer) over a median of 5.0 years 
(interquartile range 4.3-5.5) follow-up. There were 3748 
cancer and 1110 CVD events. In maximally adjusted 
models, commuting by cycle and by mixed mode 
including cycling were associated with lower risk of all 
cause mortality (cycling hazard ratio 0.59, 95% 
confidence interval 0.42 to 0.83, P=0.002; mixed 
mode cycling 0.76, 0.58 to 1.00, P<0.05), cancer 
incidence (cycling 0.55, 0.44 to 0.69, P<0.001; mixed 
mode cycling 0.64, 0.45 to 0.91, P=0.01), and cancer 
mortality (cycling 0.60, 0.40 to 0.90, P=0.01; mixed 
mode cycling 0.68, 0.57 to 0.81, P<0.001). Commuting 
by cycling and walking were associated with a lower 
risk of CVD incidence (cycling 0.54, 0.33 to 0.88, 
P=0.01; walking 0.73, 0.54 to 0.99, P=0.04) and CVD 
mortality (cycling 0.48, 0.25 to 0.92, P=0.03; walking 
0.64, 0.45 to 0.91, P=0.01). No statistically significant 
associations were observed for walking commuting 
and all cause mortality or cancer outcomes. Mixed 
mode commuting including walking was not noticeably 
associated with any of the measured outcomes.
COnClusiOns
Cycle commuting was associated with a lower risk of 
CVD, cancer, and all cause mortality. Walking 
commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD 
independent of major measured confounding factors. 
Initiatives to encourage and support active commuting 
could reduce risk of death and the burden of important 
chronic conditions.
Introduction
Physical activity is declining worldwide, partly owing 
to reductions in active commuting (walking or 
cycling).1 2  Active commuting has been recommended 
as a practical way of incorporating more physical activ-
ity into daily life.3-6  A meta-analysis of 173 146 partici-
pants reported that active commuting was associated 
with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, 
especially for women.7  However, the work was limited 
by a heterogeneous range of cardiometabolic endpoints 
(including hypertension, diabetes, stroke, coronary 
heart disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)), 
inconsistent adjustment for confounders, and no differ-
entiation between walking and cycling. The authors of 
the study recommended further research on the associ-
ation between active commuting and CVD. Evidence on 
the association of active commuting on mortality8-11 
 
and cancer11-13  are equivocal, with available studies 
limited by relatively small numbers of participants.7 11 
Evidence is limited on the associations of mixed mode 
commuting (a combination of active and non-active) on 
health outcomes. We used UK Biobank, a large, pro-
spective, population based cohort study, to investigate 
the association between different types of active com-
muting and incident CVD, cancer, and all cause 
 
mortality.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Active commuting, such as walking or cycling, has been recommended as a feasible 
way of incorporating greater levels of physical activity into daily life
A meta-analysis of 173 146 participants reported that active commuting was 
associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes
The work was limited by use of a heterogeneous range of cardiometabolic 
endpoints (including incident hypertension, diabetes, stroke, coronary heart 
disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)), and inconsistent adjustment for 
confounders between studies as well as no differentiation between commuting by 
walking and cycling
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Commuting by cycling was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality and 
adverse CVD and cancer outcomes, and walking commuting was associated with 
lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality, in a dose dependent manner and 
independent of a range of confounding factors
Mixed mode commuting including a cycle component was associated with a lower 
risk of all cause mortality and cancer outcomes
Policies designed to affect a population level modal shift to more active modes of 
commuting, particularly by cycle (eg, cycle lanes, city bike hire, subsidised cycle 
purchase schemes, and increasing provision for cycles on public transport) may 
present major opportunities for the improvement of public health

Methods
study design
Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank 
recruited 502 549 adults (5.5% response rate) aged 40-69 
from the general population.14  Participants attended 
one of 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland, 
and Wales.15 
16 We included the 263 450 (52.4%) partici-
pants who were in paid employment or self employed 
and did not always work at home. The main outcomes 
were deaths from any cause, CVD, and cancer, and inci-
dent fatal or non-fatal CVD and cancer. The exposure 
variable was the mode of transport used (non-active, 
cycling, walking, or mixed) to commute to work. Socio-
demographic factors (sex, age, deprivation index, and 
ethnicity) smoking status, body mass index, leisure 
time, occupational and DIY physical activity, sedentary 
behaviour, and dietary intake were treated as potential 
confounders, as were a range of prevalent chronic dis-
eases at baseline, in models that included participants 
with these conditions.
Procedures
Date and cause of death were obtained from death certif-
icates held by the National Health Service (NHS) Infor-
mation Centre for participants from England and Wales 
and NHS Central Register Scotland for participants from 
Scotland. Date and cause of hospital admissions were 
identified using record linkage to health episode statis-
tics records for participants from England and Wales 
and Scottish morbidity records (SMR01) for participants 
from Scotland. At the time of analysis, mortality data 
were available up to 17 February 2014 for England and 
Wales and up to 31 December 2012 for Scotland. There-
fore, for the analyses of mortality we censored follow-up 
at these dates, or at the date of death if this occurred 
earlier. Hospital admission data were available for the 
Scottish and English participants until 30 June 2012 and 
for the Welsh participants until 1 March 2011. Therefore, 
for incident CVD events, we classified end of follow-up 
as these dates unless preceded by death or admission.15 
16 
 
Incident CVD was defined as a hospital admission or 
death using ICD-10 (international classification of dis-
eases, 10th revision) code I21, I60, I61, I63, or I64, and 
cancer as C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the 
cancer registry, hospital, or death records.15 
16
At baseline, the mode of transportation was recorded 
using an electronic questionnaire completed by partic-
ipants. They were asked “In a typical day, what types of 
transport do you use to get to and from work?” and 
could select one or more of the following options: car/
motor vehicle, walk, public transport, and cycle. We 
derived five commuting categories: non-active (car/
motor vehicle and/or public transport only); walking 
only; cycling (cycling, or cycling and walking); mixed 
mode walking (non-active plus walking); mixed mode 
cycling (non-active plus cycling, or non-active plus 
cycling and walking). For walking only and cycling, we 
derived the weekly commuting distance from the single 
commuting distance (multiplied by 2 to obtain round 
trip distance) and the weekly number of round trips 
reported by the participant. We used the median values 
to categorise participants into long and short weekly 
commuting distances for their commuting mode.
To further characterise participants’ baseline charac-
teristics according to commuting mode, we assessed self 
reported total physical activity according to the interna-
tional physical activity questionnaire short form.17  We 
did not adjust for this, as total physical activity includes 
physical activity from commuting and so has substantial 
colinearity with our primary exposure. In a subset of 
54 378 participants, we obtained an objective accelerom-
eter based measure of physical activity using a tri-axial 
accelerometer (AX3, Logging Accelerometer; Open Lab, 
Newcastle University) worn on the participants’ wrist, 
and we assessed cardiorespiratory fitness in a subset of 
39 022 participants.18  These methods are described in 
more detail in the supplementary materials and else-
where.18 The relatively small number of participants with 
these data and corresponding low number of events in 
this subset meant there was insufficient power to include 
these data as covariates in our outcome models.
statistical analyses
The association between active commuting and health 
outcomes (all cause, CVD, and cancer mortality; inci-
dent CVD and cancer) was explored using Cox propor-
tional hazard models, excluding participants with 
prevalent CVD and cancer at baseline from the CVD and 
cancer models, respectively. Models for all cause mor-
tality excluded participants with a history of CVD or 
cancer. The reference category for all analyses was 
non-active commuting.
Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, 
Townsend deprivation index, comorbidities (long-
standing illness, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, cancer, 
and depression), body mass index (coded as categorical 
variable based on the World Health Organization classi-
fication19 ), smoking, dietary intake (alcohol, fruit and 
vegetable, red meat, oily fish, poultry, and processed 
meat), time spent walking for pleasure, time spent 
undertaking strenuous sport, time spent in light and 
heavy DIY, level of occupational physical activity, and 
sedentary behaviour. Details of measurement of these 
covariates are described in the supplementary materi-
als and elsewhere.18 
20 The proportional hazard assump-
tion was checked by tests based on Schoenfeld 
residuals. All analyses were performed using STATA 14 
statistical software (StataCorp).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to 
 
disseminate the results of the research to study partici-
pants or the relevant patient community.
Results
The median follow-up period was 5.0 years (interquar-
tile range 4.3-5.5 years) for all cause, CVD, and cancer 
mortality and 2.1 (1.4-2.8) years for incident CVD and

cancer. Over the follow-up period, a total of 2430 partic-
ipants died (496 related to CVD and 1126 related to can-
cer); 1110 had incident CVD and 3748 cancer.
Table 1 summarises the main characteristics of the 
participants by commuting category. Tables 1 to 3 in the 
web appendix show that physical activity that was 
reported by participants and objectively measured as 
well as cardiorespiratory fitness were all highest in 
cycle commuters followed by mixed mode cycling com-
muters. Compared with non-active commuters, walking 
commuters had higher physical activity but not cardio-
respiratory fitness.

cycling component (0.76, 0.58 to 1.00, P=0.05) were both 
associated with a statistically significant lower risk of 
all cause mortality compared with non-active commut-
ing. There were no significant associations for walking 
or mixed mode commuting including walking for all 
cause mortality. For CVD mortality, both walking (0.64, 
0.45 to 0.91, P=0.01) and cycling (0.48, 0.25 to 0.92, 
P=0.03) were associated with a lower risk than non-ac-
tive commuting. The incidence of CVD was similar for 
walking (0.73, 0.54 to 0.99, P=0.04) and cycling (0.54, 
0.33 to 0.88, P=0.01). No significant associations with 
CVD outcomes were observed for mixed mode commut-
ing. Cycle commuting (0.60, 0.40 to 0.90, P=0.01) and 
mixed mode commuting including cycling (0.64, 0.45 to 
0.91, P=0.01) were both associated with a lower risk of 
cancer mortality. Cancer incidence was similar for 
cycling (0.55, 0.44 to 0.69, P<0.001) and mixed mode 
commuting including cycling (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81, 
P<0.001). No distinctive associations were found for 
walking or mixed mode commuting including walking 
for cancer outcomes.
Figure 2  shows that among walking commuters, 
there were distinct dose-response trends for CVD inci-
dence and mortality but not for other outcomes by 
weekly commuting distance. Figure 3 shows that among 
cycling commuters there were distinct dose-response 
trends in all outcomes by weekly commuting distance. 
discussion
Commuting by walking was associated with a lower risk 
of CVD incidence and mortality. However, commuting 
by cycling was associated with the lowest risk of these 
as well as lower risks of all cause mortality and cancer, 
with dose dependent relations for all outcomes. Mixed 
mode commuting was associated with some benefits

but only if the active component comprised cycling. 
These associations were independent of sex, age, depri-
vation, ethnicity, smoking status, recreational and 
occupational physical activity, sedentary behaviour, 
dietary patterns, and other confounding factors, includ-
ing body mass index and comorbidities. These results 
are relevant, because active commuting on a daily basis 
is an important contributor to total physical activity.3-6 
Encouraging active commuting, particularly by cycling, 
may be a viable approach to deliver health benefits 
related to physical activity at the population level.
The risk reductions associated with active commut-
ing are likely to be related to their contribution to over-
all daily physical activity, and potentially to 
cardiorespiratory fitness, for which the associations 
with lower mortality, CVD incidence, and cancer inci-
dence are well established.18 21-24  Cycling commuters, 
and mixed mode cycling commuters, had greater over-
all physical activity and fitness than walking commut-
ers. This finding may reflect the greater exercise 
intensity of cycling compared with walking.25 While 
approximately 90% of cycle commuters and approxi-
mately 80% of mixed mode cycling commuters achieved 
current physical activity guidelines, only 54% of walk-
ing commuters and approximately 50% of mixed mode 
walking commuters did; a similar proportion to non-ac-
tive commuters (51%). The findings support the benefits 
of active commuting, particularly commuting with a 
cycling component. To produce meaningful benefits for 
walking commuters, longer distances may be needed. 
In the present cohort, a lower risk for CVD incidence 
was only evident among the walking commuters who 
covered more than six miles a week (equivalent to two 
hours of weekly commuting by walking at a typical pace 
of three miles an hour).
The strong evidence base for both overall and leisure 
related physical activity,26 
27  contrasts with relatively few 
and conflicting studies of non-leisure physical activity, 
such as active commuting, and prospective health out-
comes.7-13  The large population size of the present study 
provided sufficient power to compare different forms of 
active commuting, including mixed modes of commut-
ing with active and non-active components, in relation 
to a range of outcomes. In particular, previous studies 
showing benefits of active commuting have often been 
in countries where levels of active commuting are high 
and the supporting infrastructure is good (eg, Nordic 
countries and China).7-13 The data from this study 
extended the evidence base to the UK, where active com-
muting is less common. This has important policy impli-
cations, suggesting that policies designed to affect a 
population level modal shift to more active modes of 
commuting, particularly cycle commuting (eg, cycle 
lanes, city bike hire, subsidised cycle purchase schemes, 
and increasing provision for cycles on public transport), 
present major opportunities for the improvement of 
public health.

within the age range recruited but is not representative 
in other regards, such as prevalence of obesity and 
comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy volunteer 
selection bias.28  While this limits the ability to gener-
alise prevalence rates, it should be possible to 
 
generalise the estimates of the magnitude of associa-
tions.14 28 29  We were able to adjust for a wide range of 
health, demographic, and behavioural confounders. 
Mode and distance of commuting was self reported, 
rather than objectively measured; however, any errors 
introduced by misclassification of commuting 
behaviour would have acted to attenuate the associa-
tion between active commuting and health out-
comes.30 As is the case for any observational study, 
residual confounding is always possible and associa-
tions may not imply causation. A further limitation 
was that we were not able to derive weekly commuting 
distance for mixed mode commuters owing to a lack of 
information on how much of the journey was 
 
undertaken using active transport. Additionally, fit-
ness and objectively measured physical activity was 
only available for a subset of the cohort with active 
commuting data, which limited the possibility of add-
ing these variables as covariates in our models. We 
adjusted for occupational physical activity and some 
aspects of leisure time physical activity (walking for 
pleasure, strenuous sport, and DIY), but do not have a 
measure of overall non-commuting activity, so may 
not have fully adjusted for potential contributions of 
non-commuting physical activity on the measured 
health outcomes.
Conclusion
Commuting undertaken totally or partially by bicycle 
was associated with a lower risk of a range of adverse 
health outcomes. Commuting by walking was associ-
ated with a lower risk of adverse CVD outcomes. The 
findings, if causal, suggest population health may be 
improved by policies that increase active commuting, 
particularly cycling, such as the creation of cycle lanes, 
cycle hire or purchase schemes, and better provision for 
cycles on public transport.
