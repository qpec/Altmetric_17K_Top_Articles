 Importance—The relationship between income and mortality is well established but remains 
poorly understood.
Objectives—To measure the level, temporal trend, and geographic variability in the association 
between income and life expectancy, and identify factors related to small area variation in this 
association.
Design and Setting—Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion de-
identified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Social Security 
Administration death records. These data were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life 
expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to 
evaluate factors associated with differences in life expectancy.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Relationship between income and life expectancy; trends in 
life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life expectancy levels and trends by 
income group; and factors associated with differences in life expectancy across areas.
Results—The sample consisted of 1 408 287 218 person-year observations (mean age at which 
individuals were analyzed, 53.0 years; median household earnings among working individuals, 
$61 175 per year [mean, $97 725 per year]). Among those aged 40 to 76 years, there were 4 114 
380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000) and 2 694 808 deaths among women 
(mortality rate, 375.1 per 100 000). The analysis yielded four results. First, higher income was 
associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gap in life expectancy 
between the richest 1% and poorest 1% of individuals was 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) 
for men and 10.1 years (95% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life 
expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years 
for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5% of the income distribution, but increased by only 
0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5% (P < .001 for the difference for 
both sexes). Third, life expectancy varied substantially across local areas. For individuals in the 
bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years between areas with 
the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 ranged from 
gains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic 
differences in life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly 
correlated with health behaviors such as smoking (r = −0.69, P < .001), but were not significantly 
correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental factors, income inequality, or labor 
market conditions. Life expectancy for low income individuals was positively correlated with the 
local area fraction of immigrants (r = 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P < .
001), and local government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance—In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income 
was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups 
increased. However, the association between life expectancy and income varied substantially 
across areas; differences in longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased 
in others. The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area 
characteristics.

 Introduction
Higher incomes are associated with longer life expectancy,1–9 but several aspects of the 
relationship between income and longevity remain unclear. First, little is known about the 
exact shape of the income-longevity gradient. Is there a threshold above which additional 
income is no longer associated with increased life expectancy or a safety net below which 
further reductions in income do not harm health?
Second, there is debate about how socioeconomic gaps in longevity are changing over time. 
Prior work has shown that longevity gaps increased in recent decades. Some studies suggest 
a reduction in life expectancy for women of low socioeconomic status in recent years, but 
the robustness of this conclusion has been questioned.6,10–14
Third, most studies have examined the relationship between income and longevity at a 
national level. To what extent do gaps in longevity vary at the local area level?
Fourth, the sources of the longevity gap remain unclear. The socioeconomic gradient in 
longevity has been variously attributed to factors such as inequality, economic and social 
stress, and differences in access to medical care.15 These theories remain debated.
This study addressed these 4 issues by analyzing newly available data on income and 
mortality for the US population from 1999 through 2014. The following sets of analyses 
were conducted: (1) characterizing the association between life expectancy at 40 years of 
age and income in the United States as a whole; (2) estimating the change in life expectancy 
by income group from 2001 through 2014; (3) mapping geographic variation in life 
expectancy by income group during this period; and (4) evaluating factors associated with 
differences in longevity using the variation across areas.
Methods
This study was approved by the Office of Tax Analysis of the US Treasury under Internal 
Revenue Code §6103(h)(1). Institutional review board approval was obtained through the 
Harvard University Committee on the Use of Human Subjects; participant consent was 
waived because the analysis used preexisting data. The analysis used a de-identified 
database of federal income tax and Social Security records that includes all individuals with 
a valid Social Security Number between 1999 and 2014.
Income data were obtained from tax records for every individual for every year from 1999 
through 2014. The primary measure of income was pretax household earnings. For those 
who filed tax returns, household earnings were defined as adjusted gross income plus tax-
exempt interest income minus taxable Social Security and disability benefits. For those who 
did not file a tax return, household earnings were defined as the sum of all wage earnings 
(reported on form W-2) and unemployment benefits (reported on form 1099-G). When 
individuals had no tax return and no information returns, household earnings were $0. For 
nonfilers, earnings did not include the spouse’s income. However, the vast majority of 
nonfilers who are not receiving Social Security benefits are single.16 Income was adjusted to 
2012 dollars using the consumer price index.

 Mortality was measured using Social Security Administration (SSA) death records. Total 
deaths in the SSA data closely match data from the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS), with correlations exceeding 0.96 across ages and years (part I of the eAppendix, 
eFigure 1, and eTable 1 in the Supplement). Observations with income of $0 were excluded 
because the SSA does not fully track deaths of nonresidents and thus mortality rates for 
individuals with income of $0 are mismeasured. After excluding observations with income 
of $0, individuals were assigned percentile ranks from 1 to 100 based on their household 
earnings relative to all other individuals of the same sex and age in the United States during 
each year.
National Levels of Life Expectancy by Income
The study estimated period life expectancy, which was defined as the expected length of life 
for a hypothetical individual who experiences mortality rates at each subsequent age that 
match those in the cross-section during a given year. Period life expectancy conditional on 
income percentile at 40 years of age (or equivalently, expected age at death, calculated as 
life expectancy + 40) was constructed by (1) estimating mortality rates for the ages of 40 to 
76 years; (2) extrapolating mortality rates beyond the age of 76 years and calculating life 
expectancy; and (3) adjusting for differences in the proportion of racial and ethnic groups 
across percentiles. A complete description of these 3 steps appears in part II of the 
eAppendix in the Supplement. The entire analysis was conducted separately for men and 
women.
For individuals aged 63 years or younger, mortality rates were calculated based on income 
percentile 2 years earlier. The 2-year lag helps mitigate reverse causality arising from 
income changes near death.9 Because of this 2-year lag, mortality rates were available from 
2001 through 2014. Mortality rates conditional on income percentile 2 years prior are 
approximately equivalent to mortality rates conditional on income percentile at the age of 40 
years because individuals’ earnings are highly correlated over time between the ages of 40 
years and 61 years (eFigure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Earnings after the age of 62 years are less highly correlated with earnings at earlier ages 
because the rate of retirement increases sharply at 62 years of age, the earliest age of 
eligibility for Social Security benefits.17 Therefore, income for individuals aged 63 years or 
older was measured at 61 years of age. Because 1999 is the earliest year in which income 
was observed and the mortality data end in 2014, mortality rates were calculated up to 76 
years of age.
Beyond the age of 76 years, mortality rates were estimated using Gompertz models, in 
which mortality rates increase exponentially with age.18,19 In a Gompertz model, the 
logarithm of the mortality rate is linear in age: log(m(age)) = α + βage. This Gompertz log-
linear approximation fits NCHS data for mortality rates above 40 years of age with R2 
values of greater than 0.99 for both sexes (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The log-linear 
approximation also fits mortality rates at specific income percentiles well (for example, R2 > 
0.99 at the 5th and 95th percentiles; Figure 1A and eFigure 4 in the Supplement).

 The Gompertz parameters α (representing the intercept of the Gompertz model) and β 
(representing the slope) were estimated for each sex, income percentile, and year using 
maximum likelihood and modeling deaths at each age using a binomial distribution. When 
pooling all years, mortality rates up to the age of 76 years were used to estimate α and β. 
When computing year-specific estimates, α and β were estimated using data up to the age of 
63 years, so that all years were treated symmetrically. Because the Gompertz model fits less 
well after the age of 90 years, all survivors at the age of 90 years were assigned sex-specific 
but income-independent mortality rates based on NCHS and SSA data.20–22 The mortality 
rate estimates were used to construct survival curves for each income percentile (Figure 1B) 
and life expectancy was calculated as the area under the survival curve.
The life expectancy estimates were adjusted to control for differences in the racial and ethnic 
composition of income groups in 2 steps. Data from the National Longitudinal Mortality 
Study (NLMS) were used first to estimate mortality rates by age for black, Hispanic, and 
Asian individuals, relative to all other groups using Gompertz models (eFigure 5 in the 
Supplement). Log differences in mortality rates across races at a given age were assumed to 
be constant across income groups and areas, an approximation consistent with the NLMS 
data (eFigures 6 and 7 in the Supplement). US Census data were then used to estimate the 
share of black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals in each income percentile by sex and year. 
These data were combined to calculate the mean life expectancy that would prevail if each 
group had proportions of black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals corresponding to US means 
at the age of 40 years. In both the NLMS and the US Census, race and ethnicity are reported 
by individuals based on fixed categories.
National Trends in Life Expectancy by Income
Year-specific estimates of life expectancy were constructed by income quartile and ventile (5 
percentile bins) to reduce estimation error. Trends in life expectancy were estimated using 
linear regressions of race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy in each quartile or ventile 
by year.
Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy by Income
Individuals’ locations were defined based on the zip code from which they filed tax returns 
or where their W-2 forms were mailed during the year their income was measured for 
nonfilers. Those individuals who moved after the age of 63 years (ie, after retirement age) 
were therefore classified as belonging to the location where they lived at the age of 61 years 
(where they worked).
The level of race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy was estimated by income quartile 
and ventile for counties, commuting zones, and states, pooling data from 2001 through 2014. 
Commuting zones are geographic aggregations of counties based on commuting patterns in 
the 1990 Census that are widely used as measures of local labor markets. There are 741 
commuting zones in the United States compared with more than 3 000 counties and more 
than 40 000 zip codes. The results reported are primarily for commuting zones because these 
zones constitute broad geographic units analogous to metropolitan statistical areas. However,

 unlike metropolitan statistical areas, commuting zones provide a complete partition of the 
country, including rural areas.
The amount of variation in life expectancy across areas was measured as the standard 
deviation of life expectancy across areas (weighted by population in the 2000 Census) after 
subtracting the variance across areas due to sampling error. Trends were estimated by 
regressions of year-specific race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy estimates on 
calendar year separately in each area. Trend estimates were constructed by income quartile 
for the 100 most populated commuting zones (with populations >590 000) and for states.
Correlates of Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy
Theories for differences in life expectancy were evaluated by correlating commuting zone–
level estimates for individuals in the bottom and top income quartiles with local area 
characteristics. Detailed definitions of these characteristics and sources appear in part III of 
the eAppendix and in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Health behaviors (rates of current smoking, obesity [defined as body mass index {calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared} ≥30], and exercise during the 
past month) were measured by income quartile from the 1996 through 2008 Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance Surveys.
Measures of access to medical care included the fraction uninsured, risk-adjusted Medicare 
spending per enrollee, an index for the quality of inpatient care based on 30-day hospital 
mortality rates, and an index for the quality of primary and preventive care based on the 
fraction of people who visited primary care physicians and received routine care, such as 
mammograms, constructed using Medicare claims data.23
Residential income segregation was measured using the Reardon rank order index; higher 
numbers indicate greater segregation.24 Income inequality was estimated with the Gini index 
using tax records; higher numbers indicate a more unequal income distribution. Social 
cohesion was estimated using a social capital index based on the methods of Putnam25 and 
the share of the population that is religious. The percentage of black individuals was 
measured in the 2000 Census.
The following measures of local labor market conditions were used as proxies for the 
strength of local economies: the unemployment rate in 2000, population change between 
1980 and 2000, and labor force change between 1980 and 2000.
Several other correlates were constructed using Census data and other sources, for example, 
population density, the fraction of college graduates, and median house values (a complete 
list appears in eTable 3 in the Supplement).26
Data Analysis and Availability
The raw data were collapsed into means by sex, age, income, year, and geographic area 
using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc). The means by sex, age, income, year, and 
geographic area were analyzed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp). Tests of statistical

 significance were based on 2-sided tests with a significance threshold of .05. 95% 
confidence intervals for the race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy estimates were 
calculated using a bootstrap resampling procedure (part II.E of the eAppendix in the 
Supplement). Correlation coefficients were calculated using Pearson correlation measures, 
weighted by population. Data sets containing life expectancy estimates by age, sex, year, and 
income group at the national, state, commuting zone, and county level are available at 
www.healthinequality.org.
Results
The sample consisted of 1 408 287 218 person-year observations from 1999 through 2014. 
The mean age at which people were analyzed was 53.0 years. Among individuals of working 
age (38–61 years), the median for household earnings was $61 175 per year and the mean 
for household earnings was $97 725 per year. Among those aged 40 to 76 years, there were 
4 114 380 deaths from the SSA death files among men (mortality rate of 596.3 per 100 000) 
and 2 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate of 375.1 per 100 000).
National Levels of Life Expectancy by Income
Figure 2 shows race and ethnicity-adjusted expected age at death by household income 
percentile, using pooled data from 2001–2014. Higher income was associated with longer 
life at all income levels. Men in the bottom 1% of the income distribution at the age of 40 
years had an expected age of death of 72.7 years. Men in the top 1% of the income 
distribution had an expected age of death of 87.3 years, 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4–14.8 
years) higher than those in the bottom 1%. Women in the bottom 1% of the income 
distribution at the age of 40 years had an expected age of death of 78.8 years. Women in the 
top 1% had an expected age of death of 88.9 years, which is 10.1 years (95% CI, 9.9–10.3 
years) higher than life expectancy for women in the bottom 1%.
The gap in life expectancy between men and women narrowed with increased income levels. 
In the bottom 1% of the income distribution, women lived 6.0 years (95% CI, 5.9–6.2 years) 
longer than men; in the top 1% of the income distribution, women lived only 1.5 years (95% 
CI, 1.3–1.8 years) longer than men.
The relationship between life expectancy and income percentile was approximately linear 
above the 2 lowest income percentiles. However, the relationship between life expectancy 
and dollar income amount was concave (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). That is, an increase 
in income of a given dollar amount was associated with smaller gains in life expectancy at 
higher income levels. For example, increases in income from $14k to $20k (the 15th vs. 20th 
income percentiles), $161k to $224k (the 90th vs. 95th percentiles), and $224k to $1.95 
million (the 95th vs. 100th percentiles) were all associated with approximately the same 
difference in life expectancy (i.e. an increase of 0.7 to 0.9 years, averaging men and women).
Estimates of life expectancy grouping individuals based on individual earnings instead of 
household earnings were similar, as were estimates that used Gompertz extrapolations up to 
the age of 100 years instead of the age of 90 years (discussions of these and other sensitivity 
analyses appear in part IV of the eAppendix and in eFigure 9 in the Supplement).

 National Trends in Life Expectancy by Income
The upper panels of Figure 3 show race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy for men and 
women by income quartile for each year from 2001 through 2014. There was a larger 
increase in life expectancy for higher income groups during the 2000s. For men, the mean 
annual increase in life expectancy from 2001 through 2014 was 0.20 years in the highest 
income quartile compared with only 0.08 years in the lowest income quartile (P < .001). For 
women, the comparable changes were 0.23 years in the highest quartile and 0.10 years in the 
lowest quartile (P < .001). These differences persisted after controlling for the higher growth 
rate of income for individuals in the top quartile relative to the bottom quartile (eTable 4 in 
the Supplement).
The lower panels of Figure 3 show the annual increase in race-adjusted life expectancy by 
income ventiles. The annual increase in longevity was 0.18 years for men (which translates 
to an increase of 2.34 years from 2001–2014) and 0.22 years for women (2.91 years from 
2001–2014) in the top 5% of the income distribution. In the bottom 5% of the income 
distribution, the annual increase in longevity was 0.02 years (0.32 years from 2001–2014) 
for men and 0.003 years for women (0.04 years from 2001–2014) (P < .001 for difference 
between top and bottom 5% of income distributions for both sexes).
Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy by Income
Levels of Life Expectancy by Commuting Zone—Life expectancy varied 
significantly across areas within the United States, especially for low-income individuals. 
Figure 4 shows life expectancy by income ventile for New York, San Francisco, Dallas, and 
Detroit. There was substantial variation across these areas for low-income individuals, but 
little variation for high-income individuals. Life expectancy ranged from 72.3 years to 78.6 
years for men in the lowest income ventile across these 4 cities; the corresponding range for 
men in the top ventile was 86.5 years to 87.5 years.
The results in Figure 4 are representative of the variation across CZs more generally. The 
standard deviation of life expectancy across all commuting zones (weighted by population) 
was 1.39 years for men in the bottom income quartile vs 0.70 years in the top income 
quartile (P < .001). Life expectancy varied less across areas for women than men in the 
bottom income quartile, and the amount of variation across commuting zones also declined 
with income for women (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Figure 5 shows maps of expected age at death by commuting zone for men and women for 
the bottom and top quartiles of the US income distribution (maps for the middle-income 
quartiles appear in eFigure 10 in the Supplement). For individuals in the bottom income 
quartile, life expectancy differed by about 5 years for men and 4 years for women between 
the lowest and highest longevity commuting zones (P < .001 for both sexes). A summary of 
standard errors by commuting zone appears in part V.C of the eAppendix and in eFigure 11 
in the Supplement.
Nevada, Indiana, and Oklahoma had the lowest life expectancies (<77.9 years) when men 
and women in the bottom income quartile were averaged. Of the 10 states with the lowest 
levels of life expectancy for individuals in the bottom income quartile, 8 formed a

 geographic belt from Michigan to Kansas (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas). The states with the highest life expectancies for individuals 
in the bottom income quartile (>80.6 years) were California, New York, and Vermont. Life 
expectancy in the South was not significantly different from the US mean (−0.22 years, P = .
47) for women but was lower (−0.96 years, P = .03) for men in the bottom income quartile. 
Individuals in the top income quartile had the lowest life expectancies (<85.7 years) in 
Nevada, Hawaii, and Oklahoma and the highest life expectancies (>87.6 years) in Utah, 
Washington, DC, and Vermont.
Table 1 lists the top 10 and bottom 10 commuting zones in mean life expectancy (averaging 
men and women) among the 100 most populated commuting zones for individuals in the 
bottom and top income quartiles. The expected age at death for the bottom quartile ranged 
from 74.2 years for men and 80.7 years for women in Gary, Indiana, to 79.5 years for men 
and 84.0 years for women in New York, New York. The commuting zones with highest life 
expectancies were clustered in California (6 of the top 10), whereas the commuting zones 
with the lowest life expectancies were clustered in the industrial Midwest (5 of the bottom 
10). The commuting zones with the highest life expectancies for those in the bottom income 
quartile also had the smallest gaps in life expectancy between the top and bottom quartiles (r 
= −0.82, P < .001). The expected age at death for the top income quartile ranged from 82.8 
years for men and 85.3 years for women in Las Vegas, Nevada, to 86.6 years for men and 
89.0 years for women in Salt Lake City, Utah. The areas with the highest and lowest life 
expectancies for those in the top income quartile were less clustered geographically; for 
example, California had commuting zones in both the top 10 and bottom 10 of the list.
The differences in life expectancy across commuting zones were similar in analyses with 
income measures adjusted for cost of living, controls for differences across areas in the 
income distribution within each quartile, or measures of loss in life years up to the age of 76 
years that did not make use of Gompertz extrapolations (part IV.C of the eAppendix and 
eTable 6 in the Supplement). There was also considerable variation in life expectancy across 
counties within CZs (part V of the eAppendix, eFigure 12, and eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Trends in Life Expectancy
Similar to levels of life expectancy, temporal trends varied significantly across geographic 
areas. Figure 6 maps the annual change in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 by state 
for men and women in the bottom income quartile in. Hawaii, Maine, and Massachusetts 
had the largest gains in life expectancy (gaining >0.19 years annually) when men and 
women in the bottom income quartile were averaged. The states in which low-income 
individuals experienced the largest losses in life expectancy (losing >0.09 years annually) 
were Alaska, Iowa, and Wyoming.
Table 2 lists the top 10 and bottom 10 commuting zones in terms of trends in life expectancy 
(when averaging men and women) among the 100 most populated CZs for individuals in the 
bottom and top income quartiles. The estimated trends for individuals in the bottom income 
quartile ranged from an annual gain of 0.38 years in Toms River, New Jersey, to an annual 
loss of 0.17 years in Tampa, Florida. Gaps in life expectancy between the bottom and top 
income quartiles generally declined or remained stable in areas in which the bottom income

 quartile experienced the largest gains in life expectancy, such as Toms River, New Jersey. In 
contrast, gaps in life expectancy between the top and bottom income quartiles increased by 
approximately 0.3 years annually in places such as Tampa, Florida.
Figure 7 shows race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancies by year for men and women in 
the bottom income quartile in 2 commuting zones in the top 10 (Birmingham, Alabama, and 
Cincinnati, Ohio) and 2 commuting zones in the bottom 10 (Knoxville, Tennessee, and 
Tampa, Florida). This Figure shows that trends in life expectancy across these areas diverged 
continuously throughout the 2000s. For example, life expectancy increased by 
approximately 3.2 years from 2001 through 2014 for men and women in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
but declined by approximately 2.2 years in Tampa, Florida.
Correlates of Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy
Figure 8 shows correlations of commuting zone-level estimates of race- and ethnicity-
adjusted life expectancy for the bottom income quartile with local area characteristics. The 
correlations are divided into 6 groups: health behaviors, access to health care, environmental 
factors, income inequality and social cohesion, local labor market conditions, and other 
factors. Data for men and women are combined; correlations were similar by sex (eTable 8 
in the Supplement). County-level correlations were also similar (eTable 9).
Health Behaviors
Life expectancy was negatively correlated with rates of smoking (r = −0.69, P < .001) and 
obesity (r = −0.47, P < .001) and positively correlated with exercise rates (r = 0.32, P = .004) 
among individuals in the bottom income quartile. The maps for rates of smoking, obesity, 
and exercise for low-income individuals were similar to those for life expectancy (eFigure 
13 in the Supplement). Consistent with these findings, the NCHS data show that the majority 
of the variation in mortality rates across areas among individuals in the bottom income 
quartile was related to medical causes, such as heart disease and cancer, rather than external 
causes, such as vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide (part V.E of the eAppendix and 
eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Access to Health Care
Measures of health insurance coverage and spending (the fraction of uninsured and risk-
adjusted Medicare spending per enrollee) were not significantly associated with life 
expectancy for individuals in the bottom income quartile. Life expectancy was negatively 
correlated with hospital mortality rates (r = −0.31, P < .001), but was not significantly 
associated with the quality of primary care.
Environmental Factors and Residential Segregation
Theories that posit differences in mortality are driven by the physical environment (eg, 
exposure to air pollution or a lack of access to healthy food) suggest that the gap in life 
expectancy between the rich and poor should be larger in more residentially segregated 
cities. Empirically, in areas where rich and poor are more residentially segregated, 
differences in life expectancy between individuals in the top and bottom income quartile

 were smaller (r = −0.23, P = .09). Individuals in the bottom income quartile who live in 
more segregated commuting zones had higher levels of life expectancy (r = 0.26, P = .04).
Income Inequality and Social Cohesion
Life expectancy was not significantly associated with the Gini index of income inequality 
for individuals in the bottom quartile of the income distribution (r = 0.20, P = .11). Income 
inequality was more negatively correlated with life expectancy in the upper income quartiles 
(for the top quartile, r = −0.37, P < .001; Figure 9 and eFigure 14 in the Supplement). Life 
expectancy for individuals in the bottom quartile was negatively correlated with the social 
capital index (r = −0.26, P = .05) and not significantly associated with religiosity (r = 0.12, P 
= .39). There was no significant association between race- and ethnicity-adjusted life 
expectancy in the bottom income quartile and the fraction of black residents in the 
commuting zone (r = −0.06, P = .62).27
Local Labor Market Conditions
Unemployment rates, changes in population, and changes in the size of the labor force (all 
measures of local labor market conditions) were not significantly associated with life 
expectancy among individuals in the bottom income quartile.
Other Correlates
Associations between life expectancy for the bottom income quartile and 20 other factors 
were assessed (eTable 8 in the Supplement). The strongest correlates were the local area 
fraction of immigrants (r = 0.72, P < .001), median house values (r = 0.66, P < .001), local 
government expenditures per capita (r = 0.57, P < .001), population density (r = 0.48, P < .
001), and the fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P < .001) (Figure 8). Population density 
and the fraction of college graduates were also significantly positively associated with trends 
in life expectancy across CZs for individuals in the bottom income quartile (eFigure 15 in 
the Supplement).
Similar to individuals in the bottom income quartile, small area variation in life expectancy 
for individuals in the top income quartile was strongly correlated with health behaviors (eg, 
for exercise rates, r = 0.49, P < .001) (Figure 9). Correlations with measures of health care 
access were more mixed; for example, life expectancy was negatively correlated with 
Medicare expenditures per capita (r = −0.50, P < .001) but positively associated with the 
index of preventive care (r = 0.48, P < .001). There was no significant correlation with 
residential segregation. Income inequality was negatively correlated with life expectancy for 
individuals in the top income quartile (r = −0.37, P < .001), as was the local unemployment 
rate (r = −0.38, P < .001). Among the factors most strongly correlated with life expectancy 
in the bottom income quartile, the fraction of immigrants was negatively correlated with life 
expectancy in the top income quartile (r = −0.21, P = .02), whereas the fraction of college 
graduates was positively correlated (r = 0.41, P < .001) with life expectancy.

 Discussion
Addressing socioeconomic disparities in health is a major policy goal.28–30 Yet the 
magnitude of socioeconomic gaps in life expectancy, how these gaps are changing over time, 
and their determinants remain debated. In this study, newly available data covering the US 
population were used to obtain more comprehensive and precise estimates of the relationship 
between income and life expectancy at the national level than was feasible in prior work. 
New local area estimates of life expectancy by income were calculated and factors that were 
correlated with higher life expectancy for individuals with low incomes were identified. The 
analysis yielded 4 major conclusions.
National Levels of Life Expectancy by Income
First, life expectancy increased continuously with income. There was no dividing line above 
or below which higher income was not associated with higher life expectancy. Between the 
top 1% and bottom 1% of the income distribution, life expectancy differed by 15 years for 
men and 10 years for women (Box).
These differences are placed in perspective by comparing life expectancies at selected 
percentiles of the income distribution (among those with positive income) in the United 
States with mean life expectancies in other countries (eFigure 16 in the Supplement). For 
example, men in the bottom 1% of the income distribution at the age of 40 years in the 
United States have life expectancies similar to the mean life expectancy for 40-year-old men 
in Sudan and Pakistan, assuming that life expectancies in those countries are accurate. Men 
in the United States in the top 1% of the income distribution have higher life expectancies 
than the mean life expectancy for men in all countries.31 The 10-year gap in life expectancy 
between women in the top 1% and bottom 1% of the US income distribution is equivalent to 
the decrement in longevity from lifetime smoking.32
National Trends in Life Expectancy by Income
Second, inequality in life expectancy increased in recent years. Between 2001 and 2014, 
individuals in the top 1% of income distribution gained around 3 years of life expectancy, 
whereas individuals in the bottom 1% experienced no gains. As a benchmark for this 
magnitude, the NCHS estimates that eliminating all cancer deaths would increase life 
expectancy at birth by 3.2 years.33
This finding of increasing gaps in longevity supports the conclusions of recent studies using 
smaller samples.6,7,10,11,14 However, the finding that life expectancy for low-income women 
has not changed in recent years contrasts with the findings by Olshansky et al11 that life 
expectancy has declined for women without a high school degree. The results in this study 
may differ because the group of people without a high school degree is an increasingly 
selected sample.13
Case and Deaton34 and Gelman and Auerbach35 also showed that age-adjusted mortality 
rates for white men aged 45 to 54 years were constant or increasing during the 2000s. Our 
finding of increasing life expectancy across most income groups differs from this result 
because our estimates incorporate declines in mortality rates at older ages, pool all races, 
Chetty et al.

 and exclude individuals with 0 earnings at the age of 40 years. However, our finding of 
increasing inequality in life expectancy across income groups is consistent with the findings 
by Case and Deaton34 that among whites, mortality rates increased most rapidly for 
individuals with low levels of education.
Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy by Income
Third, life expectancy varied substantially across local areas. Among individuals in the 
bottom quartile of the income distribution, life expectancy differed by about 4 years for 
women and 5 years for men between commuting zones with the lowest and highest 
longevity. Trends in life expectancy during the 2000s varied substantially across areas as 
well, ranging from gains of more than 4 years between 2001 and 2014 in some commuting 
zones to losses of more than 2 years in others. These small area differences suggest that the 
increasing inequality in health outcomes in the United States as a whole is not immutable.
Prior work documenting geographic variation in longevity has been unable to disaggregate 
the variability across areas by income.36–38 Disaggregating by income is important. When 
pooling all income groups, life expectancy in the South was well below average (eFigure 17 
in the Supplement).36–41 However, among individuals in the bottom income quartile, life 
expectancy in the South was more similar to the US mean. The low level of life expectancy 
in the South documented in prior work is explained primarily by lower income levels rather 
than poorer health conditional on income. Among the population with low-income levels, 
the lowest life expectancy was found in Oklahoma and in cities in the rust belt, such as Gary, 
Indiana, and Toledo, Ohio. There was also a substantial difference in life expectancy 
between low-income individuals in Nevada and Utah, as first documented by Fuchs.42
Correlates of Local Area Variation in Life Expectancy
Fourth, the variation in life expectancy across small areas was used as a lens to evaluate 
theories for socioeconomic differences in longevity. Understanding the characteristics of 
areas where low-income individuals live longer may yield insights into the determinants of 
longevity for low-income populations more broadly. The differences in life expectancy 
across areas were highly correlated with health behaviors (eg, smoking, obesity, and 
exercise), suggesting that any theory for differences in life expectancy across areas must 
explain differences in health behaviors.
One such theory is that health and longevity are related to differences in medical care.43–51 
The present analysis provides limited support for this theory. Life expectancy for low 
income individuals was not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and 
quality of medical care provided, such as the fraction insured and measures of preventive 
care. The lack of a change in the mortality rates of individuals in the lowest income quartile 
(Figure 1) when they become eligible for Medicare coverage at the age of 65 years further 
supports the conclusion that a lack of access to care is not the primary reason that low-
income individuals have shorter life expectancies.50,51
A second theory is that physical aspects of the local environment affect health, for example 
through exposure to air pollution.52–59 Such theories predict that income gaps in longevity 
should be greater in areas with greater residential segregation by income. This explanation 
Chetty et al.

 also does not find strong empirical support. Life expectancy among individuals in the lowest 
income quartile was higher in more segregated areas—both in absolute terms and relative to 
individuals in the highest income quartile.
A third theory is that poor health is related to inequality or a lack of social cohesion, which 
may increase stress for low-income individuals.60,61 Consistent with prior work, in the 
current study the Gini index of income inequality was negatively correlated with average life 
expectancy across commuting zones when pooling all income groups (r = −0.36; P = .
002).38 However, this correlation is partly driven by areas with more inequality having a 
larger share of individuals in low-income quartiles, which is associated with lower mean life 
expectancy because the relationship between income and longevity is concave (eFigure 7 in 
the Supplement).62–64 Among individuals in the bottom income quartile, there was no 
association between inequality and life expectancy across areas, consistent with the findings 
of Lochner et al65 based on multilevel data.
Inequality was more negatively correlated with life expectancy for individuals in the highest 
income quartile, contrary to the prediction that inequality has adverse effects on the health of 
low-income individuals. At the state level, the correlations between inequality and life 
expectancy were negative when pooling all income groups, consistent with evidence 
reviewed by Wilkinson and Pickett,66 but the correlation with life expectancy in the bottom 
income quartile was positive. There was also no positive correlation between other measures 
of social cohesion (ie, social capital and participation in religious organizations) and life 
expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile.25,67–71
A fourth theory is that life expectancy is related to local labor market conditions.72,73 
Empirically, neither unemployment nor long-term population and labor force change were 
significantly associated with life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile.
None of the 4 theories for low levels of life expectancy among low-income individuals were 
consistently supported by the data. Rather, the strongest pattern in the data was that low-
income individuals tend to live longest (and have more healthful behaviors) in affluent cities 
with highly educated populations and high levels of government expenditures, such as New 
York, New York, and San Francisco, California. In these cities, life expectancy for 
individuals in the bottom 5% of the income distribution was approximately 80 years. In 
contrast, in less affluent cities, such as Gary, Indiana, and Detroit, Michigan, expected age at 
death for individuals in the bottom 5% of the income distribution was approximately 75 
years. Low-income individuals living in cities with highly educated populations also 
experienced the largest gains in life expectancy during the 2000s.
There are many potential explanations for why low-income individuals who live in affluent, 
highly educated cities live longer. Such areas may have public policies that restrict smoking 
or greater funding for public services, consistent with the higher levels of local government 
expenditures in these areas. Low income individuals who live in high-income areas may also 
be influenced by living in the vicinity of other individuals who behave in healthier ways. 
Alternatively, the low-income population in such cities might have different characteristics, 
Chetty et al.

 consistent with the larger share of immigrants in these areas. Testing between these theories 
is a key area for future research.
Implications for Practice and Policy
The small area variation in the association between life expectancy and income suggests that 
gaps in longevity may require local policy responses. For example, health professionals 
could make targeted efforts to improve health among low-income populations in cities, such 
as Las Vegas, Nevada, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The strong 
association between geographic variation in life expectancy and health behaviors suggests 
that policy interventions should focus on changing health behaviors among low-income 
individuals. Tax policies and other local public policies may play a role in inducing such 
changes. The publicly available data at www.healthinequality.org (listed in eTable 11 in the 
Supplement) provide a way to monitor local progress.
The findings also have implications for social insurance programs. The differences in life 
expectancy by income imply that the Social Security program is less redistributive than 
implied by its progressive benefit structure. Men and women in the top 1% of the income 
distribution can expect to claim Social Security and Medicare for 11.8 and 8.3 more years 
than men and women in the bottom 1% of the income distribution. Some have proposed 
indexing the age of eligibility for Medicare and full Social Security benefits to increases in 
life expectancy.74 The differences in the increases in life expectancy across income groups 
and areas suggests that such a policy would have to be conditioned on income and location 
to maintain current levels of progressivity.12
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the life expectancy estimates relied on 
extrapolations of mortality rates after the age of 76 years (and the age of 63 years for the 
year-specific estimates). Although the geographic variation remains similar without 
extrapolating beyond the age of 76 years and the national NCHS data support these 
extrapolations, further work is needed to ensure their accuracy across income subgroups and 
geographic areas. The life expectancy estimates by year do not incorporate factors that may 
have affected mortality rates only after the age of 63 years, such as Medicare Part D in 2006.
Second, the relationships between income and life expectancy should not be interpreted as 
the causal effects of having more money because income is correlated with other attributes 
that directly affect health.75 Because of such unmeasured confounding factors, the causal 
effects of income on life expectancy are likely to be smaller than the associations 
documented in this study. In addition, the local area variation need not reflect the causal 
effects of living in a particular area and may be driven by differences in the characteristics of 
the residents of each area. Although the correlational analysis in this study cannot establish 
causal mechanisms, it is a step toward determining which theories for disparities in 
longevity deserve further consideration.
Third, some of the measures used (eg, the percentage of religiosity to represent social 
cohesion) are constructed based on limited empirical data. However, we are unaware of 
better measures that could have been used as proxies for the various constructs of interest.

 Conclusions
In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater 
longevity throughout the income distribution, and differences in life expectancy across 
income groups increased during this period. However, the association between life 
expectancy and income varied substantially across geographic areas; differences in longevity 
across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. The differences in 
life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local area characteristics.

 Key Messages
•
Life expectancy increases continuously with income. At the age of 40 years, the 
gap in life expectancy between individuals in the top and bottom 1% of the 
income distribution in the United States is 15 years for men and 10 years for 
women.
•
For individuals in the bottom income quartile, life expectancy at the age of 40 
years differs by about 4.5 years between the commuting zones with the highest 
and lowest life expectancies. Adjusting for race and ethnicity, life expectancy for 
individuals with low incomes is lowest in Nevada, Indiana, and Oklahoma and 
highest in California, New York, and Vermont.
•
Gaps in life expectancy by income increased between 2001 and 2014. Life 
expectancy did not change for individuals in the lowest quartile of the income 
distribution, whereas it increased by about 3 years for men and women in the top 
quartile of the income distribution. These changes varied significantly across 
geographic areas. The gap in life expectancy between the lowest and highest 
income quartiles decreased in some areas, such as areas within New Jersey and 
Alabama, but increased by more than 3 years in other areas, such as areas within 
Florida.
•
Correlational analysis of the differences in life expectancy across geographic 
areas did not provide strong support for 4 leading explanations for 
socioeconomic differences in longevity: differences in access to medical care (as 
measured by health insurance coverage and proxies for the quality and quantity 
of primary care), environmental differences (as measured by residential 
segregation), adverse effects of inequality (as measured by Gini indices), and 
labor market conditions (as measured by unemployment rates). Rather, most of 
the variation in life expectancy across geographic areas was related to 
differences in health behaviors, including smoking, obesity, and exercise. 
Individuals in the lowest income quartile have more healthful behaviors and live 
longer in areas with more immigrants, higher home prices, and more college 
graduates.

 Figure 1. Gompertz Approximations and Empirical Survival Curves for Men at 5th and 95th 
Income Percentiles, 2001–2014
For panels A and B, the data for the scatter points were derived from cross-sectional 
mortality rates by age using income 2 years prior for men aged 40 to 62 years and cohort 
mortality rates by year using income observed at age 61 years for men aged 63 to 76 years. 
Empirical mortality rates were observed until the age of 76 years; therefore, empirical 
survival rates are observed until the age of 77 years. Solid lines show Gompertz 
extrapolations through the age of 90 years. In panel B, uniform mortality rates from the

 Figure 2. Race- and Ethnicity-Adjusted Life Expectancy for 40-Year-Olds by Household Income 
Percentile, 2001–2014
Life expectancies were calculated using survival curves analogous to those in Figure 1. The 
vertical height of each bar depicts the 95% confidence interval. The difference between 
expected age at death in the top and bottom income percentiles is 10.1 years (95% CI, 9.9–
10.3 years) for women and 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4–14.8 years) for men. To control for 
differences in life expectancies across racial and ethnic groups, race and ethnicity 
adjustments were calculated using data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Survey and 
estimates were reweighted so that each income percentile bin has the same fraction of black, 
Hispanic, and Asian adults.

Table shows levels of expected age at death for individuals in bottom income quartile (upper panel) and top income quartile (bottom panel) of the national income distribution. Estimates are shown for CZs 
with the highest and lowest life expected age at death among the 100 most populous CZs. Column 1 reports means across genders; columns 2 and 3 report estimates by gender; column 4 reports longevity 
gaps (top income quartile minus bottom income quartile), pooling genders. 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses.
