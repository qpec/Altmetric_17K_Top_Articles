SUMMARY
Although men with testosterone deficiency are at
increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), previous
studies have ignored the role of testosterone and
the androgen receptor (AR) in pancreatic b cells.
We show that male mice lacking AR in b cells
(bARKO) exhibit decreased glucose-stimulated insu-
lin secretion (GSIS), leading to glucose intolerance.
The AR agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) enhances
GSIS in cultured male islets, an effect that is abol-
ished in bARKO�/y islets and human islets treated
with an AR antagonist. In b cells, DHT-activated
AR is predominantly extranuclear and enhances
GSIS by increasing islet cAMP and activating the
protein kinase A. In mouse and human islets, the in-
sulinotropic effect of DHT depends on activation of
the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, and
accordingly, DHT amplifies the incretin effect of
GLP-1. This study identifies AR as a novel receptor
that enhances b cell function, a finding with implica-
tions for the prevention of T2D in aging men.
INTRODUCTION
Because of the recent dramatic increase in human life expec-
tancy, men will spend a significant proportion of their lives in
a state of testosterone deficiency. Against this backdrop, the
impact of testosterone deficiency on the development of visceral
obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in men is well established (Ba-
saria et al., 2006; Khaw and Barrett-Connor, 1992; Mauvais-Jar-
vis, 2011; Pitteloud et al., 2005; Zitzmann, 2009; Zitzmann et al.,
2006). However, the role of testosterone deficiency in b cell
dysfunction remains unknown. This remarkable lack of knowl-
edge is particularly intriguing because previous research has
implicated low testosterone levels in the pathogenesis of type
2 diabetes (T2D) (Haffner et al., 1996; Oh et al., 2002; Stellato
et al., 2000). Recently, an observational study from the Veterans
Healthcare Administration showed that among prostate cancer
patients, androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonists
was associated with an increased risk for T2D (Keating et al.,
2012). Another study showed marked hyperglycemia and
decreased pancreatic b cell function among prostate cancer pa-
tients after androgen deprivation therapy (Inaba et al., 2005).
Notably, testosterone deficiency has also been associated with
impaired fasting glucose and glucose intolerance independently
of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in men (Ho et al., 2013).
Because the development of hyperglycemia requires some de-
gree of b cell dysfunction, these observations, when considered
together, raise the possibility that testosterone deficiency pre-
disposes to b cell failure in men.
Testosterone action is mediated by the androgen receptor
(AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. The extent to which
the AR plays a role in b cell failure in testosterone deficient males
is unknown. Remarkably, we currently have no insight on the role
of the AR in b cell function in males. These issues are highly rele-
vant to the health of aging men because novel antidiabetic
androgen therapies that do not increase risk of prostate growth
could have a substantial public health impact.
We investigated the role of the AR in b cell function in the male
using b cell-specific AR knockout (bARKO�/y) mice and cultured
mouse and human islets. We show that the b cell AR is important
for testosterone potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secre-
tion (GSIS) in male mice as well as in human islets. This AR-
dependent pathway involves a rise in islet cyclic AMP (cAMP)

837
 and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which amplifies the
effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on GSIS. We identify
the AR as a physiological enhancer of b cell function via the
cAMP pathway, a finding that has clinical and pharmacological
implications for the prevention of T2D in aging men.
RESULTS
Generation of bARKO–/y Mice
To explore the role of AR in b cell function, we generated a
bARKO�/y mouse using the Cre-loxP strategy and crossing
ARlox/y mice with RIP-Cre transgenic mice. A previous report
showed that mice expressing the RIP-Cre transgene developed
glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion (Lee et al.,
2006). It is therefore recommended that studies involving
crosses between floxed mice and RIP-Cre mice use the RIP-
Cre as the control group rather than the littermate floxed or
wild-type (WT) mice. We also observed that RIP-Cre mice were
hyperglycemic compared with littermate ARlox/y mice and to a
lesser extent compared with WT mice (Figures S1A and S1B).
Thus, we used RIP-Cre mice as the control group. We confirmed
recombination of the Ar allele in islets from male bARKO�/y mice
by the presence of the excised 404 bp fragment (Figure 1A).
Immunostaining for AR showed cytosolic AR expression in islet
b cells from control mice and confirmed elimination of the AR
protein in islets from male bARKO�/y (Figure 1B). Because
gene manipulations using RIP-Cre transgenic mice are reported
to promote recombination in nutrient neurons (Lee et al., 2006),
we investigated whether recombination of AR had occurred in
hypothalamic neurons of bARKO�/y mice. We observed recom-

bination of the Ar allele in hypothalamus
of male bARKO�/y mice with the pres-
ence of the excised 404 bp fragment
(Figure 1C). Accordingly, male bARKO�/y
mice displayed a significant decrease in
AR protein expression in the arcuate
nucleus (ARC) and ventromedial hypo-
thalamus (VMH) (Figures 1D–1F). We
confirmed the presence of the non-re-
combined 952 bp Ar allele in all other tis-
sues of the bARKO�/y mice (Figure S1C)
in which AR protein expression was not
altered (Figure S1D). Although AR expres-
sion was decreased in hypothalamus, bARKO�/y mice showed
no alteration in food intake or body weight between 12 and
20 weeks of age (Figures S1E–S1G).
Male bARKO–/y Mice Exhibit b Cell Dysfunction and
Glucose Intolerance
We assessed glucose homeostasis in male control and bARKO�/y
mice at 12 weeks of age. This point is before the development of
late-onset obesity and IR observed in mice globally lacking AR
(Fan et al., 2005) or selectively in neurons (Yu et al., 2013). On
normal chow, bARKO�/y mice showed no alteration in fed or
fasting blood glucose or in fed insulin levels (Figures 2A–2C).
However, they showed decreased fasting insulin concentrations
(Figure 2D). Following an intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose challenge,
bARKO�/y mice exhibited decreased basal and GSIS (Figure 2E)
that resulted in glucose intolerance compared with controls (Fig-
ure 2F). Despite their deficient insulin secretion, bARKO�/y mice
had similar islet architecture, b cell mass, and pancreatic insulin
concentration as controls (Figures 2G and 2H). Control and
bARKO�/y mice also exhibited similar insulin sensitivity during
an insulin tolerance test (ITT) (Figure S2A) and had similar serum
glucagon concentrations (183 ± 36 and 169 ± 27 pg/ml, controls
and bARKO�/y, respectively, mean ± SE). To investigate whether
AR deficiency in b cells synergizes with a second b cell stress
in vivo to alter b cell function, we induced metabolic stress in
male control and bARKO�/y mice by feeding them a Western
diet for 9 weeks. After this challenge, bARKO�/y mice displayed
reduced fasted and fed serum insulin concentrations compared
with control mice (Figures 2J and 2M) and developed hypergly-
cemia in both the fed and fasted states (Figures 2I and 2L). As
838

 a result, the insulin deficiency index (insulin/glucose) was more
pronounced in bARKO�/y mice (Figures 2K and 2N). It followed
that Western diet-fed bARKO�/y mice showed decreased GSIS
and developed glucose intolerance (Figures 2O and 2P) relative
to controls. However, following Western diet feeding, bARKO�/y
mice still showed no alteration in b cell mass or pancreatic insulin
concentrations (Figures 2Q and 2R). In addition, bARKO�/y and
control mice on Western diets had similar insulin sensitivity
following an ITT (Figure S2B). Note that female islets exhibited
lower AR expression than males (Figures S2C and S2D), and fe-
male bARKO�/� mice showed no alteration in GSIS and glucose
tolerance test (GTT) on either normal chow or Western diet (Fig-
ures S2E–S2P). We then examined whether AR deficiency in
male b cells synergizes with additional b cell stress induced by
streptozotocin (STZ) to alter b cell survival. We observed no
increased predisposition to STZ in male bARKO�/y mice (Figures
S2Q–S2T). Thus, bARKO�/y mice developed altered GSIS, which
was exacerbated following Western diet feeding but without
alteration in b cell mass or increased predisposition to STZ-
induced insulin-deficient diabetes.
AR Deficiency in Neurons Does Not Alter b Cell Function
in Male Mice
Innervation of islet b cells regulates insulin secretion by afferent
signals arising from the hypothalamus (Ahre
´ n, 2000). To deter-
mine whether AR hypothalamic deletion contributes to the meta-
bolic phenotype of male bARKO�/y mice, we generated a
neuronal AR knockout (NARKO�/y) mouse by crossing ARlox/y
mice with synapsin-Cre transgenic mice that selectively express
Cre in neuronal cells (Schoch et al., 1996). We confirmed
decreased AR expression in brains of male NARKO�/y mice
with normal AR expression in other non-neuronal tissues (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B). Male NARKO�/y mice showed no alteration
in fasting and fed blood glucose or in insulin levels, observations
that were similar when the mice were on normal chow (Fig-
ures 3A–3D) or on a Western diet (Figures 3G–3J). Importantly,
unlike male bARKO�/y mice, male NARKO�/y mice showed
no alteration in GSIS and retained similar glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity compared to controls on both normal
chow and Western diet (Figures 3E, 3F, 3K, 3L, S3C, and S3D).
To further eliminate the possibility that the defect in GSIS
observed in male bARKO�/y mice derives from the partial AR
hypothalamic deletion, we generated a second b cell-specific
ARKO model (bARKOMIP) by crossing our ARlox mice with the
MIP-CreERT1Lphi (MIP-CreERT) transgenic mouse that lacks
Cre activity in the hypothalamus (Wicksteed et al., 2010). The
MIP-CreERT
transgenic
mouse,
however,
has
limitations
because of transgene-driven expression of human growth hor-
mone leading to decreased glucagon secretion and improved in-
sulin sensitivity (Oropeza et al., 2015). Therefore, we used ARlox
MIP-CreERT mice (without tamoxifen [Tam] injection) as controls
of bARKOMIP. ARlox (with Tam) and ARlox MIP-CreERT (without
Tam) displayed similar glucose tolerance (Figure S3E). Tam-
induced recombination was induced in adult ARlox MIP-
CreERT mice to obtain bARKOMIP mice. Characterization of the
bARKOMIP confirmed the selective AR deletion in b cells (Fig-
ure S3F), but bARKOMIP b cells exhibited incomplete recombina-
tion, leading to a 60% decrease in AR expression (Figure S3G).
Despite these limitations, upon exposure to a Western diet,
bARKOMIP mice exhibited decreased fasting insulin and blunted
GSIS following an i.p. glucose challenge that resulted in glucose
intolerance, compared with controls (Figures 3M and 3N). The
insulin sensitivity remained similar between the two groups
(Figure S3H). Taken together, these observations confirm that
elimination of AR in b cells in mice produces a defect in GSIS
leading to glucose intolerance.
AR Deficiency in b Cells Alters GSIS from Male Islets
To determine whether the altered insulin secretion of bARKO�/y
mice was an islet cell autonomous effect, we studied GSIS in
static incubation in cultured islets from male control and
bARKO�/y mice that were fed normal chow. Consistent with
the importance of AR in GSIS observed in vivo, at 16.7 mM
glucose, control islets exposed to the natural AR agonist dihy-
drotestosterone (DHT) showed increased GSIS compared with
those exposed to vehicle. The stimulatory effect of DHT on
GSIS was abolished in bARKO�/y islets (Figure 4A). Notably, in
all groups of mice, only a minor increase in GSIS was observed
when glucose was increased from 2.8 to 16.7 mM, probably as a
consequence of the deleterious effect of the RIP-Cre transgene
on islet function (Lee et al., 2006). Islets from control and
bARKO�/y mice fed a Western diet showed a modest and non-
significant increase in GSIS over basal, which probably resulted
from the combined deleterious effect of the RIP-cre transgene
and Western diet on islet function (Figure 4B). However, at
16.7 mM glucose, control islets exposed to DHT showed
increased GSIS compared with vehicle-exposed islets (Fig-
ure 4B). Importantly, compared with control islets, bARKO�/y
islets exhibited decreased insulin secretion at both 2.8 and
16.7 mM glucose (Figure 4B).
We translated these findings to male human islets. Exposure of
human islets to a physiological concentration of DHT enhanced
insulin secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, an effect
that was abolished by antagonizing AR with flutamide (Fig-
ure 4C). DHT, AR genetic elimination, and pharmacological inhi-
bition did not affect islet insulin content in mouse or human islets
(Figures 4D–4F). To study dynamic insulin secretion in vitro, male
control and bARKO�/y islets were placed in a perifusion system.
In this setting, insulin secretion in response to glucose is charac-
terized by a biphasic pattern (Lacy et al., 1972). The first phase is
a rapid and marked, but transient elevation in the secretory rate.
The second phase is characterized by a gradual increase in
secretion that lasts as long as the glucose stimulus is present.
Following DHT stimulation, control islets exhibited enhanced
first- and second-phase insulin secretion compared with vehicle
treatment (Figures 4G and 4I–4K). In contrast, the increased first
phase was not observed in bARKO�/y islets (Figures 4H–4K).
Further, bARKO�/y islets exhibited aberrant early second-phase
insulin secretion (Figure 4H) and lower global insulin secretion
than control islets (Figures 4I–4K).
Extranuclear AR Actions Enhance GSIS
The AR is a classical ligand-activated nuclear receptor that
regulates the expression of target genes through binding to
an androgen response element (ARE) on the promoter of
target genes (Chang et al., 1988; Lubahn et al., 1988; Tilley
et al., 1989). Nongenomic actions of AR are thought to ac-
count for rapid, transcription-independent effects of androgens

 (Matsumoto et al., 2013). However, these nongenomic androgen
effects have been observed only in vitro and await functional vali-
dation in animal models. In mouse prostate, a classical androgen
target tissue, AR immunohistochemical staining showed nuclear
localization (Figure S4A). In male mouse pancreatic islets and
in male human islets, however, AR colocalized with insulin in a
predominant extranuclear localization (Figures 5A, 5C, and
S4B) and was not observed in a cells (Figure 5B). We studied
AR subcellular localization by confocal microscopy following
binding of DHT in human prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells,
a classical model of AR nuclear actions, and in INS-1 rat insulin-
secreting cells. In the absence of DHT, AR signal was predomi-
nantly extranuclear in LNCaP and INS-1 cells. As expected,
upon DHT stimulation, AR underwent nuclear translocation in
LNCaP cells (Figure 5D). In contrast, following DHT stimulation,
AR remained predominantly in the extranuclear compartment
of INS-1 cells (Figure 5E). Similar findings were observed in the
MIN-6 mouse insulin-secreting cells (Figure S4C). We next
studied AR subcellular localization by subcellular fractionation.
Confirming results obtained by microscopy, in LNCaP cells,
DHT produced a robust nuclear translocation of AR starting at
20 min and sustained for at least 8 hr (Figure 5F). In contrast, in
INS-1 cells, DHT produced a weak nuclear translocation of AR,
and the activated AR remained mainly in the cytosolic fraction
(Figure 5G).
Mechanism of AR Potentiation of GSIS in Pancreatic b
Cells
Having established that ligand-activated AR exhibits a prefer-
ential extranuclear location in b cells, we sought to determine
whether this extranuclear location is instrumental in stimulating
GSIS. To this end, we synthesized a novel androgen dendrimer
conjugate (ADC) that selectively activates extranuclear AR
signaling pathways but remains outside the nucleus (Table S1;
Figures S5A–S5D). We successfully used a similar estrogen
dendrimer conjugate to validate the function of extranuclear es-
trogen receptors (ERs) in b cell function and survival (Tiano and
Mauvais-Jarvis, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c; Tiano et al., 2011; Wong
et al., 2010). We confirmed that unlike DHT, ADC (1) cannot in-
crease AR-dependent gene transcription in cells transfected
with a reporter construct containing an ARE (Figure 6A) and (2)
cannot increase the expression of the prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), an AR target gene containing an ARE (Zhu et al., 2003)
(Figure 6B). In contrast, in cultured mouse and human islets, se-
lective extranuclear activation of AR using ADC was as efficient
as DHT in enhancing GSIS (Figures 6C and 6D).
The observation that ligand-activated extranuclear AR stimu-
lates GSIS in b cells led us to hypothesize that in these cells,
DHT-activated AR interacts with membrane or cytosolic mole-
cules to enhance GSIS. GSIS is triggered by glucose metabolism
that leads to increased ATP/ADP ratio, the closure of ATP sensi-
tive K+ channels that is followed by membrane depolarization,
opening of Ca2+ channels, and influx of intracellular calcium
[Ca2+]i (Jones et al., 1985). Using male WT islets exposed to
KCl at low glucose to depolarize the cell membrane, we investi-
gated whether AR acts through KATP channels and membrane
depolarization independently of glucose metabolism. As ex-
pected, KCl-treated islets showed increased insulin secretion
(Figure 6E). However, we observed no further effect of DHT on
insulin secretion, an observation demonstrating that AR does
not potentiate insulin secretion triggered by depolarization alone
(Figure 6E). We next investigated whether AR activation could
stimulate glucose metabolism (and therefore ATP generation)
and subsequent [Ca2+]i influx. Increasing glucose concentration
from 2.8 to 11 and 16.7 mM increased ATP concentration in
male WT mouse islets (Figure 6F). However, exposure to DHT
did not result in a further increase in ATP concentration in these
islets (Figure 6F). Similar results were obtained when we quanti-
fied the ATP/ADP ratio (Figure S5E). Consistent with these find-
ings, at 11mM glucose, DHT did not significantly increase ATP
concentration in control or bARKO�/y islets (Figure 6G). How-
ever, it is important to stress that bARKO�/y islets displayed
decreased ATP concentration compared with control islets
(Figure 6G).
We then explored whether DHT could increase [Ca2+]i influx.
Consistent with results for ATP concentration, raising glucose
concentration increased [Ca2+]i influx in both control and
bARKO�/y islets (Figure 6H). However, consistent with results
for ATP content, DHT did not further increase [Ca2+]i in control
or bARKO�/y islets (Figure 6H). Notably, at high glucose, as
in the case of ATP concentration, bARKO�/y islets exhibited
decreased [Ca2+]i compared with control islets (Figure 6H).
Thus, DHT increased insulin secretion without increasing
glucose metabolism or [Ca2+]i influx. We interpreted the
decreased ATP and [Ca2+]i in bARKO�/y islets as consequences
of glucose desensitization leading to decreased glucose meta-
bolism and ATP production. Indeed, genes involved in dediffer-

 were downregulated in glucose intolerant male bARKO�/y
islets compared with controls. In contrast, these genes were
not decreased in islets from normoglycemic female bARKO�/�
mice (Table S2).
The finding that DHT acting on AR enhanced GSIS without
increasing cellular ATP generation or [Ca2+]i influx suggested to
us that AR activation amplifies GSIS by acting downstream
and augmenting the Ca2+ signal. Incretins such as GLP-1
potentiate GSIS by increasing b cell concentrations of cAMP
(Lin and Haist, 1973). We explored the effect of DHT on cAMP
production in islets from male mice. In control male islets, DHT
increased cAMP production by approximately 2-fold (Figure 7A).
In contrast, the effect of DHT in increasing cAMP levels was not
observed in bARKO�/y islets (Figure 7A) or in WT islets treated
with the AR antagonist flutamide (Figure 7B), an observation
demonstrating its dependence on AR. Note that in these exper-
iments, DHT-induced cAMP production was independent from
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition since DHT increased cAMP
concentration over vehicle in islets preincubated with PDE inhib-
itors. An increase in intracellular cAMP concentration activates
the cAMP-dependent PKA (Nesher et al., 2002). To determine
whether DHT-mediated potentiation of GSIS was dependent
on PKA activation, we used H-89, the PKA inhibitor. Although
DHT potentiated GSIS in cultured WT male islets, the DHT effect
was ablated in the presence of H-89 (Figure 7C). Further, activa-
tion of PKA leads to phosphorylation of the cAMP response
element-binding protein (CREB). In male mouse islets, DHT
exposure produced a rapid phosphorylation of CREB (Figure 7D).
Thus, AR activation by DHT potentiates GSIS in a cAMP- and
PKA-dependent manner.
Interestingly, the insulinotropic effect of DHT observed in
mouse and human islets was not observed in INS-1 cells (Fig-
ure S6A) despite the fact that INS-1 cells express AR (Figure 5),
suggesting that the insulinotropic effect of DHT requires a
secreted factor, produced by islet non-b cells, that acts on b cells
in a paracrine manner. Therefore, we explored the hypothesis
that AR action in b cells amplifies GLP-1R signaling to increase
cAMP production, thus potentiating the insulinotropic action of
GLP-1. We reasoned that because GLP-1 is produced by
cultured islet a cells (Liu et al., 2011; Marchetti et al., 2012),
DHT enhances GSIS in cultured islets (which produce GLP-1)
but not in cultured INS-1 cells (which do not produce GLP-1).
Consistent with this hypothesis, in mouse and human islets
(Figure 7E) and in INS-1 cells (Figure S6B), DHT amplified the in-
sulinotropic effect of GLP-1 on GSIS. To explore the possibility
that DHT amplification of GSIS requires a functional GLP1-R,
we studied the effect of DHT in the presence of the selective
GLP1-R antagonist exendin (9-39) and in absence of exogenous
GLP-1 (Go
¨ ke et al., 1993). The effect of DHT in amplifying GSIS
was abolished in the presence of exendin (9-39) (Figure 7F).
Together, these studies demonstrate that DHT amplifies the in-
sulinotropic effect of exogenous and islet-derived GLP-1, and
this effect requires a functional GLP-1R.
DISCUSSION
To study the role of testosterone in b cells in vivo, we generated a
mouse with conditional elimination of AR in these cells. Although
male bARKO�/y mice also exhibit decreased AR expression in
hypothalamus, the insulin-secretory defect observed in these
mice results from the loss of AR in b cells. This is supported by
the following evidence. First, abnormalities observed in male
bARKO�/y mice are reproduced in isolated male bARKO�/y islets
and in human islets exposed to an AR antagonist, demonstrating
that this defect is secondary to the loss of AR in the islets. Sec-
ond, the insulin-secretory defect observed in male bARKO�/y
mice is not observed in male mice that selectively lack AR in
neurons. Finally, and most important, a second bARKOMIP
mouse exhibiting selective and inducible b cell AR elimination
in adulthood recapitulates the impaired GSIS, leading to glucose
intolerance.
A critical finding of this study is that AR deficiency in b cells of
male mice impairs GSIS, which produces glucose intolerance
because activation of b cell AR is required to enhance both first-
and second-phase GSIS. Importantly, the insulinotropic function
of the AR is present in human islets at physiological concentra-
tions of testosterone. Together, these observations suggest
that (1) testosterone is necessary for normal GSIS in men, and
(2) men with androgen deficiency display a deficit in GSIS that
predisposes them to T2D.
Early studies showing binding of androgen to a nuclear pro-
tein in prostate (Bruchovsky and Wilson, 1968) followed by the
cloning of the AR and analysis of its structure (Chang et al.,
1988; Lubahn et al., 1988; Tilley et al., 1989) led to the establish-
ment of a paradigm in which AR acts as a nuclear ligand-acti-
vated transcription factor. Indeed, in prostate, AR is maintained

 in the cytosol in an inactive complex by heat-shock proteins.
Upon ligand binding, AR homodimerizes and translocates to
the nucleus (Prescott and Coetzee, 2006). In b cells, however,
AR is mostly localized in an extranuclear compartment, where
it remains sequestrated following androgen stimulation. When
male cells are permanently exposed to DHT in vivo, AR is
localized in the nucleus of prostate cells. In contrast, under
the same conditions, AR is observed in the extranuclear
compartment of islet b cells. The nongenomic actions of AR
are thought to account for the rapid, transcription-independent
effects of androgens (Matsumoto et al., 2013). However, to date,
these nongenomic effects of androgens have been observed
only in vitro and therefore await validation in vivo in animal
models.
We previously described novel extranuclear actions for ERs in
b cells (Tiano and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c; Tiano
et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2010). Unlike the nuclear ER that
acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor in breast and
uterine cells, extranuclear ERs protect pancreatic islet b cell
function and survival via cytosolic interactions with kinases
and transcription factors. The present study provides the first
evidence of rapid androgen action via an extranuclear AR
involved in the pathophysiology of insulin secretion. This novel
androgen action is observed at physiological concentration of
the hormone, is validated in vivo, and most important, it is found
in human tissue.
In b cells, GSIS is driven by glucose metabolism that generates
ATP (Ashcroft, 1980) and triggers [Ca2+]i influx. Testosterone
activation of the AR increases GSIS independently of increases
in glucose metabolism and [Ca2+]i influx. Rather, AR activa-
tion increases GSIS from b cells by producing cAMP and acti-
vating the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway. Consistent with AR
signaling via a PKA pathway, transgenic mice with enhanced
PKA catalytic activity in pancreatic islets (Kaihara et al., 2013;
Song et al., 2011) exhibit increased GSIS but, like male
bARKO�/y mice, show no change in b cell mass or insulin synthe-
sis. A previous study suggested that testosterone stimulates islet
insulin mRNA and content (Morimoto et al., 2001). However, we
found no evidence of AR stimulation of insulin synthesis.
Because the investigators used testosterone (which is converted
into estrogen), the effect they described was likely due to testos-
terone aromatization to estrogen acting on ERs (Wong et al.,
2010).
Incretins, such as GLP-1 and exendin 4, restore first-phase
and enhance second-phase insulin release in humans with T2D
(Egan et al., 2002; Fehse et al., 2005). Most of these incretin ef-
fects in b cells require activation of the cAMP-dependent PKA
pathway via the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of GLP-1
(Drucker and Nauck, 2006), which activates the adenylate
cyclase (AC) to trigger cAMP production. We observe that in
cultured mouse and human islets, the insulinotropic effect of
testosterone is abolished by pharmacological inhibition of the
GLP-1R in absence of exogenous GLP-1, demonstrating that
the AR requires an active GLP-1R to enhance GSIS and en-
hances the effect of islet-produced GLP-1. Accordingly, AR acti-
vation by testosterone also amplifies the insulinotropic effect of
exogenous GLP-1 in these islets. Therefore, the testosterone-
AR pathway could act as an incretin sensitizer in b cells. In the
future, the effect of testosterone in amplifying the insulinotropic
action of other ligands of Gs-linked GPCR, such as glucagon
or glucagon inhibitory polypeptide, deserves investigation. Inter-
estingly, cultured islets from bARKO�/y mice previously exposed
to a Western diet secrete less insulin than controls. This suggests
that AR is also necessary for islet adaption to metabolic stress.
Further studies are also needed to address this issue. The mech-
anism through which we propose AR stimulates GSIS in male b
cells is summarized in Figure 7G.
The biological basis for androgen stimulation of insulin secre-
tion and the integration of androgenic and metabolic signals in
males is likely to be anabolic because both testosterone and in-
sulin are anabolic hormones. In contrast to males, AR deficiency
in b cells of female mice does not alter GSIS. Females have lower
AR expression in b cells compared with males, an observation
that likely promotes weaker androgen signaling (Visakorpi
et al., 1995). In addition, females exhibit lower serum and tissue
androgen concentrations than are necessary to activate the AR
(Mauvais-Jarvis, 2011). We therefore interpret the absence of
phenotype of bARKO�/� female mice as a consequence of the
evolution of females’ lower dependence on AR activation and
signaling.
This study has clinical ramifications. Selective AR modulators
(SARMs) are a novel class of AR ligands. The goal of SARMs is to
provide androgen therapy for age-related functional decline with
customized anabolic activity on muscle and bone but without
androgenic action in the prostate (Mohler et al., 2009). Our
work suggests that androgen deficiency-induced T2D is due at
least partially to a loss of androgen stimulation of GSIS in b cells.
Designing SARMs with AR agonistic activity in b cells could
represent a novel strategy to prevent androgen deficiency-
related glucose dysregulation in men.
In conclusion, AR action is required in males’ b cells for GSIS.
This study identifies the AR as a novel b cell receptor and
enhancer of b cell function via the cAMP-dependent pathway
and has important clinical and pharmacological implications for
prevention of T2D in aging men.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation of Mutant Mice
The bARKO�/y mouse was generated by crossing mice carrying the AR
gene with floxed exon 2 on their X chromosome (ARlox) with transgenic mice
overexpressing the Cre recombinase under control of the RIP promoter
(RIP-Cre; Jackson Laboratory). Generation and characterization of ARlox�/�
have been described (De Gendt et al., 2004). NARKO�/� mice were generated
by crossing ARlox+/� with the Syn-Cre+/� mice (Jackson Laboratory) as
previously described (Yu et al., 2013). To generate bARKOMIP mice, we
crossed ARflox mice with the Ins1-Cre/ERT (MIP-Cre+/�) transgenic mouse
(Jackson Laboratory). We induced Tam inactivation of AR after puberty and
following a 5 day treatment with Tam (75 mg/kg). All studies were performed

measured in serum by ELISA. For i.p. GTT (2 g/kg)
and GSIS (3 g/kg), mice were fasted overnight
before glucose injection. For i.p. ITT, mice were
fasted for 6 hr prior to insulin injection (0.75 U/kg).
Pancreas insulin concentration was measured
from acid ethanol extract as previously described
(Tiano et al., 2011).
Immunohistochemistry and b Cell Mass

Insulin and glucagon staining as well as b cell mass
measurement from pancreas sections were per-
formed as previously described (Tiano et al.,
2011). For AR staining of human islets, and islets
from bARKO�/y, bARKOMIP, and their respective
controls, sections were incubated with primary
antibody rabbit anti-AR (PG-21, 1:100; Millipore).
Secondary antibody goat biotinylated anti-rabbit
(1:200; Linco) and Alexa 568 tyramide signal ampli-
fication kit (TSA; Molecular Probes) was used for
signal amplification. For AR staining in the hypothalamus, tissues were fixed
in 10% formalin at 4�C and stored in 30% sucrose until sectioning in 20 mm
sections. Sections were incubated with primary antibody anti-AR (N20,
1:250; Santa Cruz). Secondary goat biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody was
visualized using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories).

 (Nikon Eclipse E400). LNCaP and INS-1 cells were treated with vehicle or
DHT (10�8 M) for 40 min, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde.
LNCaP cells were incubated in the anti-AR antibody (N20, 1:200; Santa
Cruz) and then in the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400). INS-1 cells
were incubated in the anti-AR antibody (N20, 1:200; Santa Cruz). The signal
was amplified using TSA. The images were taken using a Nikon A1 confocal
microscope.
Subcellular Fractionation
The LNCaP and INS-1 cells were treated with DHT for 20 min, 40 min, 1 hr, 3 hr,
and 8 hr. Subcellular fractionation was performed by first extracting the cyto-
solic proteins with dilution buffer, followed by extracting the nuclear protein
fractions with lysis buffer. Cytosolic and nuclear protein fractions were normal-
ized to GAPDH and Histone H3, respectively.
Islet Isolation and Insulin Secretion in Static Incubation
Islet isolation was performed following pancreatic duct injection with collage-
nase as described (Tiano et al., 2011). For measurement of insulin secretion,
islets were hand-picked under a dissection microscope and treated with
DHT (10�8 M; Steraloids), or vehicle (95% ethanol) for 48 hr. Insulin release
from islets was measured as previously described (Tiano et al., 2011). For
experiment with inhibitors, islets were treated with flutamide (10�8 M;
Sigma-Aldrich) or H-89 (10 mM; Cell Signaling).
Islet Perifusion
A perifusion system (Biorep Technologies) was used to determine the insulin
biphasic response. Briefly, batches of 60 mouse islets were perifused at
37�C, at a flow of 100 mL/min. Islets were first equilibrated for 60 min with
KRB solution containing 2.8 mM glucose, then stimulated for 30 min with
KRB solution contained either DHT (10�8 M) or vehicle (95% ethanol) and
16.7 mM glucose. Samples were collected in a 96-well plate, and insulin con-
centration was determined by ELISA (Millipore).
Luciferase Assay
LNCaP cells were transfected with ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter, containing
three repeats of AREs in tandem, upstream of the minimal tk enhancer fused
to the luciferase reporter (Snoek et al., 1996), or control plasmids containing
renilla luciferase reporter gene using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo
Scientific) and 48 hr prior to the treatment. On the experiment day, cells were
lysed, and dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to mea-
sure firefly and renilla luciferase activity sequentially. The ratio of firefly and
renilla luciferase reading was calculated to indicate the ability of DHT and
ADC to activate ARE-mediated luciferase expression.
ATP and cAMP Measurements
Intracellular ATP concentrations were measured in ten islets per condition
treated with either vehicle or DHT (10�8 M) for 30 min using EnzyLight ATP
assay and ADP assay (BioAssay Systems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Islets were lysed to release ATP and ADP, and luminescence
was measured on a luminometer (BioTek) and quantified to ATP and ADP
standards. cAMP levels were determined in mouse islets pre-treated with
vehicle, DHT (10�8 M), flutamide (10�8M), or DHT plus flutamide for 30 min
in the presence of 200 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Islets were
lysed, and the supernatant was collected to measure the intracellular cAMP
level with the cyclic AMP XP Assay Kit (Cell Signaling) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of Cytoplasmic Calcium and Perifusion
Islet [Ca2+]i was measured with the Ca2+ sensitive dye fura-2 acetoxymethyl
ester (Molecular Probes) as previously described (Jacobson et al., 2007).
Mouse islets were plated on coverslips and dye-loaded with fura-2. Fluores-
cence imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope
equipped with an epifluorescent illuminator (Sutter Instruments), a CoolSNAP
HQ2 camera (Photometrics), and Nikon Elements software (Nikon). The [Ca2+]i
ratios of emitted fluorescence intensities at excitation wavelengths of 340
and 380 nm (F340/F380) were determined every 5 s with background sub-
traction. A perifusion system (Biorep Technologies) containing DHT (10�8 M)
or vehicle (95% ethanol) 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose was used to determine
biphasic response.
Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as mean ± SEM, as specified in figures. All statistical an-
alyses were performed using the unpaired Student’s t test. A p value less than
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
