Neandertal and modern human adults differ in skeletal features of
the cranium and postcranium, and it is clear that many of the
cranial differences—although not all of them—are already present
at the time of birth. We know less, however, about the develop-
mental origins of the postcranial differences. Here, we address this
deficiency with morphometric analyses of the postcrania of the
two most complete Neandertal neonates—Mezmaiskaya 1 (from
Russia) and Le Moustier 2 (from France)—and a recent human
sample. We find that neonatal Neandertals already appear to pos-
sess the wide body, long pubis, and robust long bones of adult
Neandertals. Taken together, current evidence indicates that skel-
etal differences between Neandertals and modern humans are
largely established by the time of birth.

I
t is well established that Neandertal and modern human adults
differ in skeletal features of the cranium and postcranium
(1–7). Furthermore, it is clear from multiple morphometric
studies of the cranium (8–13) that many of the differences in
cranial form—although not all of them—are already present
around the time of birth. However, there have been only a few
morphometric analyses of postcranial form in Neandertals < 1 y
of age (11, 14, 15), although we know more about Neandertal
children ∼2 y of age or older (16–20).
We would like to know if postcranial diversification followed a
similar developmental path to cranial diversification. Addition-
ally, knowing which Neandertal characteristics are present early
in development has implications for determining whether post-
cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans
have evolutionary (e.g., genetic drift, natural selection) or life-
time behavioral (e.g., activity levels, gait patterns) causes (21).
Newborn individuals are particularly important in this regard
because their skeletons have been subject to only in utero me-
chanical loading, so it is not possible for their skeletons to have
been influenced by locomotion or other habitual activities of
adults or older subadults.
Here, we study the postcranial skeletons of the two most
complete Neandertal neonates—Mezmaiskaya 1 (from Russia)
and Le Moustier 2 (from France)—to quantify the extent to
which Neandertal postcranial features are present around the
time of birth. We base our analyses on 11 linear measurements
(Table S1) of the Neandertals (Table S2) and a recent human
sample of African Americans and European Americans (Tables
S3 and S4).
Results
Adult European Americans and African Americans differ, on
average, in body proportions, with European Americans having a
wider trunk relative to limb length and relatively shorter distal
limb segments (22, 23). These contrasts are much the same,
although less extreme, as those between high- and low-latitude
human groups (24, 25), and result from the geographic ancestries
of European Americans and African Americans [Bergmann’s (26)
and Allen’s (27) “rules”]. Similar proportional differences are al-
ready detectable in our fetal/infant sample (Fig. 1), which is con-
sistent with other studies of subadult body proportions (28, 29).
European Americans tend to have a wider and a longer ilium
relative to femur length (Fig. 1 A and B), a shorter radius relative
to humerus length (Fig. 1C), and a shorter tibia relative to femur
length (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the “cold-adapted” body pro-
portions of adult Neandertals (24, 30, 31), both Mezmaiskaya 1 and
Le Moustier 2 have a very large ilium relative to femur length (Fig.
1 A and B), and Mezmaiskaya 1 has short distal-to-proximal limb
lengths (Fig. 1 C and D; the results for tibia–femur proportions are
less conclusive than for radius–humerus proportions because, al-
though Mezmaiskaya 1 plots just below the European-American
curve, the curves are minimally separated in this part of the graph).
However, unexpectedly, Le Moustier 2 has a long radius relative to
humerus length (Fig. 1C).
In our fetal/infant sample, African Americans and European
Americans do not show a consistent difference across size (i.e.,
age) in how long the pubis is relative to the size of the ilium
(Fig. 2), which is in line with the similarity between African-
and European-American adults in ilium–pubis index (ratio of
Significance
One of the oldest questions in human evolutionary studies is:
why do Neandertals look different from present-day and ancient
modern humans? This question can be addressed at different
levels, but a critical component of a complete answer is un-
derstanding the developmental basis of adult differences. We
now know that many skull differences are present by the time
of birth. We know less, however, about the developmental
basis of differences in the rest of the body. By studying the two
most complete Neandertal neonates, we were able to establish
that, as for the skull, many differences in body form are pre-
sent by the time of birth. Neandertals largely look like Nean-
dertals, regardless of age.

 distance between the anterior- and posterior-superior iliac
spines to pubis length) (32). Adult Neandertals have a long pubis
(33–35), and this characteristic is already present in Mezmais-
kaya 1 (Fig. 2).
Adult European Americans and African Americans differ, on
average, in the shapes of their long bones, with European
Americans having thicker shafts and larger articulations relative to
shaft length (23, 36). In dry-bone samples of young individuals, it is
not possible to compare articulation size to shaft length, because
the articulations are mostly or completely cartilaginous. However,
it is possible to compare the diaphysis end (i.e., metaphysis) size,
which should be related to articulation size, to diaphysis length.
Our fetal/infant sample does not show a uniform contrast be-
tween European Americans and African Americans in end size
to length (Fig. 3). For the humerus (Fig. 3A) and femur (Fig. 3C),
African Americans tend to have larger ends relative to length;
for the tibia (Fig. 3D), European Americans tend to have larger
ends relative to length; and for the radius (Fig. 3B), there is no
consistent difference across size (i.e., age) in end size relative to
length. Adult Neandertals have thick shafts and large articu-
lations relative to shaft length (36–38), and Mezmaiskaya 1 and
Le Moustier 2 may anticipate this feature of adult Neandertals
by having long bone diaphyses with very large ends relative to
length (Fig. 3).
Principal components (PCs) of residuals from the all-recent-
human regressions provide a multivariate synthesis of the
bivariate analyses (Fig. 4). PC1 encompasses 37% of the vari-
ance, and it mainly reflects differences in ilium size relative to
femur length and long bone diaphysis end to length dimensions;
PC2 encompasses 23% of the variance, and it mainly reflects
differences in distal to proximal limb lengths; and PC3 encom-
passes 19% of the variance, and it mainly reflects differences in
pubis length relative to ilium size, ilium length relative to femur
length, and radius length relative to humerus length (Table S5).
Mezmaiskaya 1 has a highly positive score on PC1 (Fig. 4A),
which reflects its large ilium relative to femur length and long
bone diaphyses with large ends relative to lengths. Differences
between African Americans and European Americans along PC2
and PC3 appear to reflect differences in body proportions, and
Mezmaiskaya 1 plots within but near the edge of the European-
American convex hull (Fig. 4B).
Discussion
We found that many Neandertal postcranial characteristics are
present around the time of birth. Neonatal Neandertals already
appear to possess the wide body, long pubis, and robust long
bones of adult Neandertals. In fact, the only exception we could
find was a relatively short radius, which Mezmaiskaya 1 had,
whereas Le Moustier 2 had a relatively long radius. This am-
biguous result may not be so surprising, given that adult Nean-
dertals show less shortening of the radius relative to the humerus
than they do of the tibia relative to the femur (39), and that the

ANTHROPOLOGY
 Dederiyeh 1 subadult Neandertal has a relatively long radius
(18). Unfortunately, the clavicles of Mezmaiskaya 1 and Le
Moustier 2 are too fragmentary to reliably estimate the length,
but the somewhat older Amud 7 Neandertal seems to already
have a clavicle that is long relative to humerus length (14).
Consistent with our results, Golovanova et al. (40) concluded
that Mezmaiskaya 1 had relatively short distal limb segments and
relatively large ends of the radius and femur in comparison with
a recent human infant of similar dental age; and Ponce de León
et al. (11) found that Mezmaiskaya 1 had absolutely large distal
ends of the humerus and femur, absolutely long ilium and pubis,
and a relatively short tibia in comparison with the means of mea-
surements collected by Fazekas and Kósa (41) on a recent Hun-
garian fetal skeletal sample.
We focused our analyses on a set of linear measurements, but,
based on other studies, Neandertals < 1 y of age already seem to
show other distinctive postcranial features, including bowed long
bones (Kiik Koba 2, Mezmaiskaya 1, Le Moustier 2) (11, 42, 43);
robust, rounded rib shafts (Kiik Koba 2) (42); an incipient dorsal
axillary sulcus of the scapula (Kiik Koba 2) (44); a medially di-
rected radial tuberosity (Mezmaiskaya 1) (40); subequal proximal
and distal thumb diaphyses (Le Moustier 2) (43); an opponens
pollicis flange on the first metacarpal (Kiik Koba 2) (37); and very
thick long bones (Le Moustier 2) (15). However, other studies
appear to indicate that at least some Neandertals developed ele-
vated long-bone cross-sectional properties (14, 45) and a thin su-
perior pubic ramus (16, 46) later in life.
Taken together, current evidence indicates that, with some
exceptions [e.g., neurocranial globularity (12, 13), thin superior
pubic ramus (16, 18, 46), and perhaps radius/humerus propor-
tions (this study)], skeletal differences between Neandertals and
modern humans are largely established by the time of birth. Fea-
tures that are present on the skeletons of neonatal Neandertals
could not have developed in response to mechanical loading as-
sociated with adult/older-subadult behaviors (e.g., hunting), so they
must either have an evolutionary explanation or result from envi-
ronmental influences on the fetus (e.g., maternal diet).
If we consider that evolutionary changes are a more likely
explanation than fetal environment for skeletal differences be-
tween Neandertals and modern humans, climatic adaptation is
the best-supported explanation for many aspects of Neandertal
postcranial form because Neandertals have body proportions
close to present-day humans with ancestry in cold climates
(24, 30, 31), it appears that multiple generations are necessary
for appreciable changes in body proportions (i.e., an evolu-
tionary timescale is needed) (24, 25), a wide variety of taxa
exhibit similar ecological relationships (47–49), and laboratory
experiments on human subjects demonstrate that body pro-
portions influence heat loss (50) [see also Churchill (51)].
Recent research, however, has cast some doubt on this explana-
tion. Because the modern human expansion from Africa that gave
rise to recent human groups had a substantial south-to-north
component, differences among recent human groups in body
proportions could have more to do with population history than
climatic adaptation (52–54). Additionally, a wide body may have
been the ancestral condition for Homo (7, 55–57), even though the
earliest members of our genus presumably lived in warm climates.
Consequently, although it remains likely that many postcranial
differences between Neandertals and modern humans stem from
contrasts in body proportions (21, 36, 38, 58), further research will
be necessary to establish whether climate played an important role
in shaping these differences in body proportions.
Finally, it is important to note that, even if climatic adaptation
explains Neandertal body proportions, climatic adaptation alone
cannot explain a long pubis relative to dimensions of the pelvic
inlet (59, 60). The alternative explanations for a long pubis in-
clude a posteriorly positioned acetabulum related to differences
in gait between Neandertals and modern humans (60), or a wide
pelvis coupled with a transversely oval outlet of the birth canal
(as opposed to the anteroposteriorly oval outlets typical of modern
humans), because Neandertals had a different birth process than
modern humans (59).
Materials and Methods
Mezmaiskaya 1 and Le Moustier 2 Neandertals. Mezmaiskaya Cave is located in
the northwestern Caucasus ∼50 km south of the city of Maikop (Russia).
Mezmaiskaya 1 consists of 141 identifiable postcranial bones, a cranium and
mandible, and 14 dental crowns of deciduous teeth. The skeleton was re-
covered in anatomical association from the lowermost 3–5 cm of level 3, the
oldest Middle Paleolithic layer (Figs. S1 and S2). Detailed stratigraphic as-
sessments clearly indicate that the Mezmaiskaya 1 skeleton and level 3 were
deposited at the same time, both dating to very close to or greater than the
effective measurement limit of radiocarbon (∼50 ka) and likely to 70–60 ka
based on electron spin resonance mean early and late uptake model de-
terminations for level 3 (11, 40, 61, 62).
The rock shelters of Le Moustier are located in the Dordogne ∼45 km
southeast of Périgueux (France). The Le Moustier 2 skeleton comes from
layer J through the top of layer H of the lower rock shelter, which contained

2 (Table S2). The SI Text includes more details about the context and pres-
ervation of the Mezmaiskaya 1 and Le Moustier 2 Neandertals.
Recent Human Sample. The recent human sample is from the fetal skeletal
collection housed at the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian).
Various medical practitioners collected the fetuses, mostly from the Baltimore,
MD, and Washington, DC, areas, at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries
and donated them to the museum between 1903 and 1917 (67, 68). Based on
the documentation associated with the collection, we divided the sample into
two groups: African Americans and European Americans, with approximately
equal numbers of female and male specimens in each group (Table S3). Age at
death is not precisely documented for much of the sample, but, based on femur
length (measurement defined in Table S1; minimum, 57 mm; maximum,
102 mm; mean, 79 mm), the individuals ranged from ∼8 mo in utero to ∼4 mo
after birth, with the mean approximately birth (41, 69).
Data Collection. We collected 11 linear measurements of the humerus, radius,
ilium, pubis, femur, and tibia (Table S1) on the left and right sides, preser-
vation permitting, on each of the individuals. We analyzed the mean mea-
surement when both sides could be measured. For Mezmaiskaya 1 and Le
Moustier 2 (Table S2), we rounded each measurement to the nearest millimeter
and indicated ±0.5 mm on all of the graphs so as not to convey an undue sense
of precision when visually comparing these specimens to recent humans.
T.D.W. collected the measurements of the recent humans directly with
calipers. Mezmaiskaya 1 was scanned with a Skyscan 1172 micro-CT system
(resolution ∼35μm for all dimensions), and Le Moustier 2 was scanned with a
BIR ACTIS 225/300 industrial CT scanner (resolution of 20–30 μm for all di-
mensions). H.C., J.-J.H, B.M., and T.D.W. collected the measurements of
Mezmaiskaya 1 and Le Moustier 2 directly with calipers and from CT scans
with the Avizo (FEI) and Tivmi software packages.
Statistical Analyses. We fit nonlinear regressions of the form y = axb (power
laws) to the data in the bivariate graphs, where a and b are constants, and y
and x are the response and predictor variables, respectively. For each graph,
we fit three separate curves: for the African Americans, European Ameri-
cans, and all of the recent humans (i.e., all individuals except Mezmaiskaya
1 and Le Moustier 2). As with ratios, these curves allow relative dimensions
to be compared, but they have the advantage of allowing the ratio to vary
with size (i.e., age). (An exponent [b] equal to one indicates that the ratio
between the two variables remains constant.) Because relative dimensions
are being compared, our analyses are independent of age estimates, which
is advantageous given evidence that Neandertals may have matured faster
than modern humans (70). Individuals with missing data for one (or both) of
the variables were excluded from the particular bivariate analysis. Table S6
provides fit statistics for the bivariate analyses.
To provide a multivariate synthesis of the bivariate analyses, we performed
PC analysis (PCA) of the residuals of the individuals from the all-recent-human
regressions (i.e., the residuals from a particular bivariate analysis correspond
to a variable in the PCA). We performed the PCA on the covariance matrix,
and individuals with any missing data were excluded from this analysis. We
performed all statistical analyses in Matlab (Mathworks).
