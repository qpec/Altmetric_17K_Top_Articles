IMPORTANCE Previous clinical trials showing the benefit of continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) in the management of type 1 diabetes predominantly have included adults using
insulin pumps, even though the majority of adults with type 1 diabetes administer insulin
by injection.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 1 diabetes treated with
insulin injections.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted between October
2014 and May 2016 at 24 endocrinology practices in the United States that included 158
adults with type 1 diabetes who were using multiple daily insulin injections and had
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 7.5% to 9.9%.
INTERVENTIONS Random assignment 2:1 to CGM (n = 105) or usual care (control group; n = 53).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome measure was the difference in change
in central-laboratory–measured HbA1c level from baseline to 24 weeks. There were
18 secondary or exploratory end points, of which 15 are reported in this article, including
duration of hypoglycemia at less than 70 mg/dL, measured with CGM for 7 days at 12
and 24 weeks.
RESULTS Among the 158 randomized participants (mean age, 48 years [SD, 13]; 44% women;
mean baseline HbA1c level, 8.6% [SD, 0.6%]; and median diabetes duration, 19 years
[interquartile range, 10-31 years]), 155 (98%) completed the study. In the CGM group, 93%
used CGM 6 d/wk or more in month 6. Mean HbA1c reduction from baseline was 1.1% at 12
weeks and 1.0% at 24 weeks in the CGM group and 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, in the
control group (repeated-measures model P < .001). At 24 weeks, the adjusted
treatment-group difference in mean change in HbA1c level from baseline was –0.6% (95% CI,
–0.8% to –0.3%; P < .001). Median duration of hypoglycemia at less than <70 mg/dL was
43 min/d (IQR, 27-69) in the CGM group vs 80 min/d (IQR, 36-111) in the control group
(P = .002). Severe hypoglycemia events occurred in 2 participants in each group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with type 1 diabetes who used multiple daily
insulin injections, the use of CGM compared with usual care resulted in a greater decrease in
HbA1c level during 24 weeks. Further research is needed to assess longer-term effectiveness,
as well as clinical outcomes and adverse effects.

O
nly approximately 30% of individuals with type 1 dia-
betes meet the American Diabetes Association goal of
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 7.5% (58 mmol/mol)
for children (<18 years) and 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) for adults
(≥18 years),1 indicating the need for better approaches to dia-
betes management. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
with glucose measurements as often as every 5 minutes, plus
low and high glucose level alerts and glucose trend informa-
tion, has the capability of better informing diabetes manage-
ment decisions than blood glucose meter testing performed
several times a day. Randomized clinical trials have demon-
strated the benefit of CGM in adults with type 1 diabetes, but
not consistently in children, to improve glycemic control as
measuredbyHbA1clevelandtoreducehypoglycemia.2-6These
previous trials have either completely or predominantly in-
cluded insulin pump users,2,4,5 although the majority of adults
with type 1 diabetes deliver insulin via injections.7,8
Only a small proportion of individuals with type 1 diabe-
tes who inject insulin use CGM, although the limited avail-
able observational data suggest that the glycemic benefit may
be comparable to that for pump users. In T1D Exchange reg-
istry 2015 data, mean HbA1c level in the 410 adult insulin in-
jecters using CGM was similar to that in 2316 pump users using
CGM (7.6% vs 7.7%, respectively) and lower than mean HbA1c
level in the 6222 injection users not using CGM (7.6% vs 8.8%;
P < .001).9

Methods
The trial was conducted at 24 endocrinology practices in the
United States (19 community-based and 5 academic centers).
The protocol and Health Insurance Portability and Account-
ability Act–compliant informed consent forms were ap-
proved by institutional review boards (central commercial
board for 17 sites and local boards for the other 7 sites). Written

Study Participants
Major eligibility criteria included age 25 years or older, diagno-
sisoftype1diabetestreatedforatleast1yearwithmultipledaily
insulin injections, central laboratory–measured HbA1c level of
7.5% to 10.0%, no home use of a personal CGM device in the 3
monthsbeforethetrial,andanegativepregnancytestforwom-
enofchildbearingpotential(eTable1inSupplement2hasacom-
plete listing of the inclusion and exclusion criteria).
Synopsis of Study Design
Each participant was required to complete a 2-week preran-
domization phase using a CGM system that was configured to
record glucose concentrations not visible to the participant
(referred to as a “blinded” CGM). Eligibility required that the
blinded CGM be worn on at least 85% of possible days, the
CGM be calibrated at least 2 times per day, and blood glucose
meter testing (with a study-provided meter and test strips) be
performed at least 3 times daily. Fourteen participants did
not meet these criteria and did not continue into the random-
ized trial (Figure 1). One participant had a sudden death dur-
ing the prerandomization phase.
On the study website, after verification of eligibility
from data entered, each participant was assigned randomly
fromacomputer-generatedsequencetoeithertheCGMorcon-
trol group in a 2:1 ratio, with a permuted block design (block
sizes of 3 and 6) stratified by HbA1c level (<8.5% and ≥8.5%).
A 2:1 randomization was used rather than 1:1 to provide a larger
sample size for a separate follow-on randomized trial assess-
ing glycemic benefits of initiating pump therapy in CGM
users using insulin injections.
Participants in the CGM group were provided with a CGM
system (Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM System with an enhanced
algorithm, software 505, Dexcom Inc) that measured glucose
concentrations from interstitial fluid in the range of 40 to
400 mg/dL every 5 minutes for up to 7 days. Participants in
both groups were provided with a Bayer Contour Next USB
meter and test strips. The CGM group was instructed to use
the CGM daily, calibrate the CGM twice daily, and verify the
CGM glucose concentration with the blood glucose meter
before injecting insulin (as per the regulatory labeling of the
device at the time the trial was conducted). General guide-
lines were provided to participants about using CGM, and
individualized recommendations were made by their clini-
cian about incorporating CGM trend information into their
diabetes management. The control group was asked to per-
form home blood glucose monitoring at least 4 times daily.
Participants in both groups were provided general diabetes
management education, and clinicians were encouraged to
review downloaded glucose data at each visit to inform treat-
ment recommendations, which were at clinician discretion
and not prescriptive in the protocol. eTable 2 in Supplement 2
describes the participant education as well as guidelines for
clinicians. CGM guidelines for participants are included in
Supplement 1.
Key Points
Question For adults with type 1 diabetes who are using multiple
daily insulin injections, does continuous glucose monitoring
improve hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels compared with
self-monitored blood glucose management?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 158 adults with type 1
diabetes, there was a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c level
during 24 weeks with continuous glucose monitoring vs usual care
(–1.0% vs –0.4%).
Meaning Continuous glucose monitoring resulted in better
glycemic control compared with usual care, but further research
is needed to assess clinical outcomes, as well as effectiveness,
in a typical clinical population.

Follow-up visits for both treatment groups occurred
after 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The CGM group had an additional
visit 1 week after randomization. The control group had 2
additional visits 1 week before the 12- and 24-week visits, at
which a CGM sensor in blinded mode was inserted to collect
glucose data for 1 week. Telephone contacts for both groups
occurred 2 and 3 weeks after randomization.
Hemoglobin A1c level was measured at baseline, 12
weeks, and 24 weeks at the Northwest Lipid Research Labo-
ratories, University of Washington, Seattle, with the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial standardized analyzer
(TOSOH, Biosciences Inc).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in the central laboratory–
measured HbA1c level. Prespecified secondary outcomes
included percentage of participants with HbA1c level less than
7.0%; CGM-measured time in range (70-180 mg/dL), duration
of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL, <60 mg/dL, and <50 mg/dL),
duration of hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL, >250 mg/dL, and
>300 mg/dL), and glucose variability (coefficient of varia-
tion); change in hypoglycemia unawareness10; and change in
frequency of blood glucose meter testing (longitudinal
changes in blood glucose meter testing were not assessed).
Prespecified exploratory outcomes included CGM-measured
mean glucose concentration and the following binary HbA1c
outcomes to assist in translation of the primary HbA1c analy-
sis to a participant level: HbA1c level less than 7.5% and rela-
tive HbA1c reduction greater than or equal to 10%. Post hoc
outcomes included HbA1c reduction of 1% or more, HbA1c
level less than 7.0% or reduction of 1% or more, CGM-
measured area above the curve 70 mg/dL and area under
the curve 180 mg/dL, change in insulin dose, and change in
body weight.
Satisfaction with CGM was assessed by completion at 24
weeks of the CGM Satisfaction Survey (44 items on a 1-5
Likert scale, with the computed score representing the
mean of the 44 items and subscales of benefits and lack of
hassles).11 Quality-of-life and health economic outcomes
will be reported in separate articles.
Safety outcomes included severe hypoglycemia (defined
as an event that required assistance from another person
to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative
actions), diabetic ketoacidosis, and serious adverse events re-
gardless of causality.
Statistical Methods
A sample size of 147 for the 2:1 randomization was calculated
to have 90% power to detect a difference in mean HbA1c
level between treatment groups, assuming a population dif-
ference of 0.4%, standard deviation of the 24-week values of
0.7 adjusted for the correlation between baseline and
24-week values (based on data from the Juvenile Diabetes
Research Foundation CGM randomized trial5), and a 2-sided
α level of .05. Sample size initially was increased to 169 to
account for potential loss to follow-up. When it was recog-
nized by the coordinating center that the trial completion
rate was higher than anticipated, the recruitment goal was
changed to a minimum of 150, with the approval of the steer-
ing committee and the sponsor.
Analyses followed the intent-to-treat principle. The fol-
lowing change was made from the protocol and statistical
analysis plan before the data lock: the primary analysis was
a treatment group comparison of the change in HbA1c level
from baseline to 24 weeks, adjusted for baseline HbA1c
level and clinical site as a random effect, in a repeated-
measures linear model in the protocol and with analysis of
covariance in the statistical analysis plan; both are reported
in this article. Confounding was assessed by repeating the
analysis, including potential confounding variables as covari-
ates. The Rubin method was used to impute for missing
data.12 Exploratory analyses were conducted to assess for
interaction between the treatment effect on the change in
HbA1c level from baseline to 24 weeks and baseline factors by
including interaction terms in analysis of covariance models.
The following changes were made from the protocol and sta-
tistical analysis plan during the peer-review process: in post
hoc analyses, binary HbA1c outcomes were evaluated with
propensity scores13 instead of logistic regression, adjusted for
baseline HbA1c level and clinical site; and for secondary,
exploratory, and post hoc analyses, 99% CIs instead of 95%
CIs are reported.
For CGM outcomes, treatment group comparisons using
the CGM data collected in each group for 7 days at 12 and 24
weeks were made with analysis of covariance models based
on ranks using van der Waerden scores if the metric was

Results
Between October 2014 and December 2015, 158 participants
were assigned to the CGM group (n = 105) or control group
(n = 53). Mean age was 48 years (SD, 13) (range, 26-73 years,
with 34 participants [22%] ≥60 years); 44% were women. Me-
dian diabetes duration was 19 years (IQR, 10-31 years), and
mean baseline HbA1c level was 8.6% (SD, 0.6%; range, 7.5%-
9.9%). Participant characteristics according to randomized
group are shown in Table 1.
The 24-week primary study outcome visit was com-
pleted by 102 participants (97%) in the CGM group and all 53
(100%) in the control group (Figure 1). Overall visit comple-
tion was 99% and 98%, respectively. Three participants in the
CGM group (4 total visits) and 3 in the control group (3 total
visits) had additional visits, not required in the protocol, for
diabetes management.
Among the 102 participants in the CGM group who com-
pleted the trial, median CGM use was 7.0 d/wk (IQR, 7.0-7.0)
at 4, 12, and 24 weeks; only 2 (2%) discontinued CGM before
the 24-week visit. During month 6 (weeks 21-24), CGM use was
6 or more d/wk for 93% of the 102 participants (eTable 3 in
Supplement 2). No participant in the control group initiated
unblinded CGM use before the primary outcome.
According to meter downloads, mean blood glucose self-
monitoring was 5.1 tests per day (SD, 1.8) in the CGM group and
5.1 tests per day (SD, 1.4) in the control group during the base-
line period of blinded CGM wear and 3.6 tests per day (SD, 1.6)
and 4.6 tests per day (SD, 1.6), respectively, at 24 weeks
(adjusted mean difference for the change, –1.0; 99% CI, –1.7 to
–0.4; P < .001).
Glycemic Control and Other Outcomes
Primary Outcome
Mean reduction in HbA1c level from baseline was 1.1% at
12 weeks and 1.0% at 24 weeks in the CGM group and 0.5% and
0.4%, respectively, in the control group (primary analysis re-
peated-measures P < .001). At 24 weeks, the adjusted treat-
mentgroupdifferenceinmeanchangeinHbA1clevelwas–0.6%
(95% CI, –0.8% to –0.3%; P < .001) (Table 2). For each treat-
ment group, baseline and 24-week HbA1c values for each

a Mean baseline HbA1c level was 8.6% in each group. For all analyses,
missing HbA1c values in which the central laboratory value was missing
but the local laboratory value was known were imputed with a regression line
based on the site’
s local HbA1c measurements (CGM/control: 1/0 at 12 weeks;
1/0 at 24 weeks).
bFor the 24-week primary outcome only, the Rubin method was used to impute
missing HbA1c values when both the central and local laboratory values were
missing (3 in the CGM group and 0 in the control group). For the secondary,
exploratory, and post hoc analyses, n = 102.
c For the primary analysis, treatment group comparisons were made with
analysis of covariance models, adjusted for baseline HbA1c level and clinical
site as a random effect. Model residuals were verified to have an approximate
normal distribution.
dFor the secondary, exploratory, and post hoc outcomes, treatment group
comparisons were made with propensity scores, adjusted for baseline HbA1c
level and clinical site. P < .01 was considered significant to account for multiple
comparisons (with 99% CIs accordingly provided).

variability favored the CGM group compared with the control
group (Table 3, eTable 5 in Supplement 2). In exploratory
analyses, hypoglycemia treatment group differences favored
the CGM group during both daytime and nighttime, but
hyperglycemia treatment group differences favoring the CGM
group were present only during the daytime (eTables 6 and 7
in Supplement 2).
Other Analyses
At 24 weeks, in post hoc analyses there were no significant dif-
ferences between the CGM group and control group in me-
dian change in total daily insulin dose per kilogram of body
weight (–0.02 vs 0.03 U/kg; P = .23), median ratio of long-
acting to rapid-acting daily insulin dose (0.9 vs 1.0; P = .54),
proportion of participants with an increase in number of in-
jections of rapid-acting insulin per day (26% vs 26%; P = .90),
or mean change in body weight (1.7 vs 0.7 kg; mean differ-
ence, 1.0 kg; 99% CI, –0.7 to 2.8; P = .12) (eTable 8 in
Supplement 2). Clarke Hypoglycemia Unawareness scores did
not differ between groups (mean difference, –0.1; 99% CI, –0.7
to 0.5; P = .64).
Severe Hypoglycemia and Other Adverse Events
Severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 2 participants in
each group (P = .67). There were no occurrences of diabetic
ketoacidosis. Other serious adverse events, unrelated to the
studyintervention,occurredin2participantsintheCGMgroup
and none in the control group (eTable 9 in Supplement 2).
CGM Satisfaction
In the CGM group, satisfaction with use of CGM was high, as
indicated by the mean (SD) score of 4.2 (0.4) on the CGM Sat-
isfaction Survey, with mean (SD) scores of 4.2 (0.5) on the ben-
efits subscale and 4.3 (0.5) on the subscale for lack of hassles
(eTable 10 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
Among adults with type 1 diabetes using multiple daily insu-
lin injections, the use of CGM compared with usual care
resulted in a greater decrease in HbA1c level during 24 weeks.
The HbA1c benefit in the CGM group was consistently present
across the age range of 26 to 73 years, the baseline HbA1c
level range of 7.5% to 9.9%, and all education levels. In
addition, CGM use was associated with a high degree of
participant satisfaction with CGM, increased time with glu-
cose concentrations between 70 and 180 mg/dL, decreased
time with glucose concentrations less than 70 mg/dL, and
decreased glycemic variability, measured with the coefficient

(a prespecified condition).
bTreatment group comparisons made with analysis of covariance models,
adjusted for the corresponding baseline value, baseline hemoglobin A1c level,
and clinical site as a random effect, using pooled data from 12 and 24 weeks.
Because of skewed distributions for the hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
metrics (including area above the curve 70 mg/dL and area below the curve
180 mg/dL), these models were based on ranks using van der Waerden scores.
P < .01 was considered significant to account for multiple comparisons
(with 99% CI accordingly provided for the metrics that are approximately
normally distributed).
c Area above (the glucose) curve 70 mg/dL reflects both percentage and
severity of glucose values in the hypoglycemic range. Area under (the glucose)
curve 180 mg/dL is the analogous measure for hyperglycemia.

of variation. The trial was not designed to demonstrate a ben-
efit in reducing clinical severe hypoglycemia events, and the
low event rate in the control group precluded a meaningful
analysis. However, less biochemical hypoglycemia, as was
observed in the trial, has been associated with a lower risk for
subsequent severe hypoglycemic events14,15 and improved
quality of life.16-18
The amount of CGM use by the participants was high
(median CGM use 7 d/wk in month 6) despite a protocol ap-
proximating usual practice, with only 1 visit after week 4 and
no visits or other protocol-specified contacts between 12 and
24 weeks. The amount of use was similar to or greater than the
frequency of use in pump-using adults with type 1 diabetes in
previous trials and observational studies,2-5,19 which could be
related to CGM accuracy being significantly improved from the
generation of sensors in previous trials.20-22 The observed ben-
efits of CGM occurred despite the CGM group’
s having signifi-
cantly less blood glucose meter testing per day than the con-
trol group.
The magnitude of benefit of CGM on HbA1c levels rela-
tive to control in this trial of insulin injection users is com-
parable to the magnitude of benefit of CGM observed in
pump users in previous randomized trials.2,4,5 This finding
was not a foregone conclusion. Insulin injection users have
less flexibility in adjusting their insulin delivery in response
to CGM glucose concentrations and trends than do pump
users. Basal insulin delivery for pump users is continuous,
can be programmed to vary at different times of the day,
and can be temporarily changed in response to decreasing
or increasing glucose concentrations or planned activities
such as exercise. In contrast, injection users have fixed basal
insulin based on the absorption of their long-acting insulin
and can make adjustments only to rapid-acting insulin
boluses.
The strengths of the trial included a high retention rate,
high adherence to treatment group assignment, central labo-
ratory measurement of HbA1c level, a protocol approximating
usual clinical practice, and participation in the trial by both
community-based and academic sites. Assignment to the CGM
and control groups could not be blinded because of the na-
ture of the intervention; however, the groups had a similar
number of visits. The 0.4% mean improvement in HbA1c level
in the control group likely reflects both a study effect related
to clinical trial participation and more structured training in
using blood glucose monitoring in adjusting insulin regimens
than was occurring for these individuals before the study.
This study also had several limitations. In light of the
eligibility criteria, the results may not apply to individuals
with type 1 diabetes who are younger than 26 years or have
HbA1c levels outside the range of 7.5% to 9.9% and should
not be applied to individuals with type 2 diabetes who
receive multiple daily injections of insulin. The informed
consent process and the run-in phase had the potential to
exclude individuals who might be less adherent with CGM
than the cohort that was studied.
Conclusions
Among adults with type 1 diabetes who use multiple daily in-
sulin injections, the use of CGM compared with usual care re-
sultedinagreaterdecreaseinHbA1clevelduring24weeks.Fur-
ther research is needed to assess longer-term effectiveness, as
well as clinical outcomes and adverse effects.
