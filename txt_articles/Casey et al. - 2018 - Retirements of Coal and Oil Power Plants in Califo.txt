Coal and oil power plant retirements reduce air pollution nearby, but few studies have leveraged these natural ex-
periments for public health research. We used California Department of Public Health birth records and US Energy
Information Administration data from 2001–2011 to evaluate the relationship between the retirements of 8 coal and
oil power plants and nearby preterm (gestational age of <37 weeks) birth. We conducted a difference-in-differences
analysis using adjusted linear mixed models that included 57,005 births—6.3% of which were preterm—to compare
the probability of preterm birth before and after power plant retirement among mothers residing within 0–5 km and
5–10 km of the 8 power plants. We found that power plant retirements were associated with a decrease in the propor-
tion of preterm birth within 5 km (−0.019, 95% CI: −0.031, −0.008) and 5–10 km (−0.015, 95% CI: −0.024, −0.007),
controlling for secular trends with mothers living 10–20 km away. For the 0–5-km area, this corresponds to a reduc-
tion in preterm birth from 7.0% to 5.1%. Subgroup analyses indicated a potentially larger association among non-
Hispanic black and Asian mothers than among non-Hispanic white and Hispanic mothers and no differences in edu-
cational attainment. Future coal and oil power plant retirements may reduce preterm birth among nearby populations.

Oil and coal power plants emit air pollutants including partic-
ulate matter (with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal
to 10 μm (PM10) or 2.5 μm (PM2.5)), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, benzene, lead, mercury, and other known health haz-
ards (1). Cheap and abundant natural gas, health concerns, and
legislation related to climate change have resulted in coal and
oil power plant retirements across the United States in the past
decade. Coal electricity accounted for 51% of US electricity
generation in 2001 and 42% in 2011, with more plant retire-
ments likely in the future (2). Residential proximity to active oil
and coal power plants may harm health (1, 3, 4), particularly of
pregnant women and developing fetuses (5–8). Therefore,
power plant retirements may improve birth outcomes, includ-
ing the proportion of preterm birth.
Preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) contributes signifi-
cantly to infant mortality and morbidity and later-life health pro-
blems (9). While the etiology of preterm parturition is largely
unknown, environmental exposures likely play a role. Numer-
ous studies link prenatal exposure to air pollution to earlier par-
turition, as summarized by Sapkota et al. (10). From 2001 to
2008, Laurent et al. (11) found associations between increased
PM2.5, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide and preterm birth in Califor-
nia. In 2016, preterm birth rates rose in California, for the second
year in a row, to 8.6% (12). Socioeconomic factors, including
lower individual (13) and neighborhood (14–16) socioeco-
nomic status and racial residential segregation (17), have also
been associated with preterm birth. In California, there are
racial disparities in preterm birth; non-Hispanic black women

 have nearly double the prevalence of preterm birth of non-
Hispanic white women (18). Despite calls in the environ-
mental health literature (19), limited research has explored the
modifying role of individual-level race/ethnicity and socioeco-
nomic status in the relationship between air pollution and pre-
term birth (20–22), and none has done so in relation to point
sources of pollution like power plants.
The socioeconomically patterned distribution of air pollution
complicates the study of the relationship between race/ethnicity,
socioeconomic factors, and preterm birth. Compared with non-
Hispanic white persons, persons of all other races/ethnicities tend
to experience higher levels of air pollution and other environmen-
tal hazards prenatally (23–25) and might also differ systematically
by other attributes (e.g., health behaviors, psychosocial stress) cor-
related with preterm birth (26). This confounding could lead to
spurious associations between air pollution and preterm
birth. To avoid confounding by socioeconomic characteristics,
we leveraged a natural experiment provided by power plant re-
tirements. Power plant retirements should affect all nearby
residents equally. That is, their retirement provides exoge-
nous variation in exposure that we can exploit to assess as-
sociations with health (27, 28). Researchers have used other
natural experiments to evaluate the association of extreme
weather (29), earthquakes (30), and air pollution (7, 31–35)
with birth outcomes. Few studies have used these designs,
however, to explore the potential benefits of reduced air pollu-
tion for preterm birth (31, 33–35). We analyzed data in Cali-
fornia during 2001–2011, when 8 coal and oil power plants
retired, to assess the association between power plant retire-
ments and preterm birth while considering the modifying roles
of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
METHODS
Study population
The California Department of Public Health provided data from
its Birth Statistical Master Files on all births (n = 5,909,002)
between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011. We geocoded
mothers’ home addresses to a latitude/longitude and census block
group using ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, California). We restricted
the study cohort to geocoded singleton births within 20 km of
power plants (Web Figure 1, available at https://academic.oup.
com/aje). We made further exclusions based on maternal age,
gestational age, congenital abnormalities, and timing of con-
ception, arriving at a final sample size of 57,005 births. The
study was approved by the University of California, Berkeley
(#2013-10-5693), and the California Health and Human Services
Agency committees for the protection of human subjects.
Exposure assessment
We defined exposure to coal and oil power plants along 2
dimensions, space and time (Web Figure 2), using data from the
US Energy Information Agency (EIA) (36), the US Environmen-
tal ProtectionAgencyAirMarketsProgram(37),andtheCalifornia
Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board (38).
Based on home address, we assigned mothers to one of 3 area
bins within the larger 20-km circular area: 0–5 km; 5–10 km;
and 10–20 km. While coal and oil power plants produce
secondary air pollutants that can travel over 100 km, we restricted
this study to an area within 20 km of power plants to maximize
change in exposure related to retirement (39). We considered
the 0–5-km bin the most exposed, followed by the 5–10-km
bin, with the 10–20-km bin as a temporal control group, because
its exposure was likely minimal. Based on date of mothers’ last
menstrual period (LMP), we further classified exposure to a
coal or oil power plant according to time. Exposed mothers
had an LMP in the year-long period 2 years prior to power
plant retirement and unexposed mothers had an LMP in the
year after power plant retirement. We selected these relatively
short time windows before and after plant retirement to im-
prove comparability of study populations and to eliminate the
potential for fixed-cohort bias (40).
Outcome assessment
Gestational age was estimated based on LMP prior to 2007
and on best clinical estimate (combination of LMP and ultra-
sound) from 2007 to 2011. LMP-based methods may overes-
timate preterm birth (41, 42). In our population, however,
gestational age estimated by LMP only and by best obstetri-
cal estimate had a Spearman correlation of 0.98 from 2007
to 2011. Furthermore, our study design only compared differ-
ences in the proportion of preterm birth between women in dif-
ferent bins measured during the same time periods and therefore
(except for births around 2 power plants that retired during
2006 and 2008) used the same measure of gestational age. We
defined preterm birth as delivery before 37 gestational weeks.
Early preterm birth was defined as <32 gestational weeks
and late preterm birth as ≥32 and <37 gestational weeks.
Covariates
We constructed covariates based on data in the Birth Files, the
2000 US Census, and the 2005–2009 American Community
Survey, which we downloaded from the National Historical
Geographic Information System website (43). A priori, we iden-
tified individual-level variables that could potentially affect the
association between power plant retirements and preterm birth:
maternal age in years, maternal race/ethnicity (Hispanics of any
race and non-Hispanic Asian, black, white, and other), maternal
educational attainment (did not complete high school, high-
school diploma or equivalent, some college/Associate’s Degree,
college degree, and graduate school), number of prenatal visits,
infant sex, and month of birth. We also identified census-block–
level proportion of residents living below the federal pov-
erty threshold and proportion with less than a high-school
diploma, based on residential address and year of birth.
Statistical analysis
We summarized the raw proportion of preterm births (overall,
early, and late) according to before/after power plant retirement
and distance (in 1-km bins). We compared characteristics of the
10–20-km bin before and after power plant retirements using
Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for cate-
gorical variables to assess whether shifting population charac-
teristics could explain temporal differences.

 We used a difference-in-differences (DID) approach (44) to
estimate the association between power plant retirements and
the probability of preterm birth nearby. We separately exam-
ined preterm birth overall, early preterm birth, and late preterm
birth. In each case, term birth was the reference outcome. The
DID estimator subtracted the change in preterm birth from
before to after retirement among those mothers living 10–20
km from power plants (changes that result, presumably, only
from secular trends) from the change in preterm birth among
those mothers living 0–5 km and 5–10 km from power plants
(changes that result from power plant retirement and secular
trends in preterm birth). Under the assumption that secular
trends are parallel in both groups and that the model (1) is cor-
rectly specified, the resulting DID estimator corresponds to
the difference in preterm birth rates attributable to power plant
retirements. We used a linear mixed model with random inter-
cepts for power plants to account for the nonindependence of
births that took place around the same power plant:

is a binary indicator of power plant j status; β4 and β5 represent
our DID coefficients of interest, and bj is a power plant-level
random intercept (bj ~ N[0, σ2]). We subsequently added co-
variates to model (1): maternal age (linear and quadratic terms),
race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and number of prenatal
visits; infant sex and birth month; and neighborhood-level
poverty and educational attainment. We hypothesized that
certain subpopulations might benefit more from plant retirement,
and we therefore ran analyses stratified by maternal race/ethnicity
(Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian, black, and white; other was
excluded due to small numbers) and educational attainment.
Exposure variables were generated with QGIS (QGIS Devel-
opment Team (2018), Open Source Geospatial Foundation Proj-
ect, qgis.osgeo.org), and analyses were conducted with R, version
3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses (Web Appendix 1).
We repeated our main analysis separately for mothers who lived
downwind of their power plant for 0, 1–90, and ≥90 days during
pregnancy. We anticipated that mothers living downwind would
experience higher levels of air pollution in the period before
retirement and therefore a greater reduction in exposure afterward
(3, 8). To control for changes in socioeconomic context during
the California housing crisis (45), we linked CoreLogic (http://
www.corelogic.com/) data on the number of foreclosures—
defined as the final transfer of a foreclosed property deed to a
new owner—at the block-group level in the year of birth between
2005–2011. To assess changes in air quality near retiring power
plants, we linked daily PM2.5 estimates from the US Environ-
mental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air Quality
Modeling System. Finally, we implemented a negative exposure
control (46) by randomly selecting 8 new oil and coal power
plants in California that had not retired during our study period,
assigning them the retirement dates of the original 8 retired
power plants, and repeating our main analyses (Web Appendix 2).
A null relationship between residential proximity to these new
power plants (which did not actually retire) with the original
retirement dates would provide evidence that our main results
were not due to time trends in premature birth rates.
RESULTS
Our study population included 57,005 births that took place
within 20 km of one of 8 retiring coal (n = 2) or oil (n = 6)
power plants in California during 2001–2011 (Figure 1). Before
retirement, the 8 power plants emitted, on average, 177 tons of
nitrogen oxides annually; this fell to just 4 tons per year after
retirement (37, 38). Overall, 6.3% of births were preterm.
The distribution of maternal and neonatal characteristics and
neighborhood-level factors according to before/after-retirement
status and distance bin appears in Table 1. Within 5 km, non-
Hispanic black mothers lived an average of 2.1 (standard devia-
tion, 1.4) km from power plants, compared with 3.4 (standard
deviation, 1.0) km for non-Hispanic white mothers and 2.8
(standard deviation, 1.3 km) km for Hispanic mothers (Web
Table 1).

 We assessed the appropriateness of the comparison group
(10–20 km) by comparing maternal and neonatal characteris-
tics across exposure bins in the period before retirement. The
0–5-km bin included a higher proportion of Hispanic mothers
(49%) and a lower proportion of non-Hispanic black and white
mothers (8% and 23%, respectively) compared with the 5–10-km
(30% Hispanic, 6% black, 35% white) and 10–20-km (38%
Hispanic, 13% black, 31% white) bins (Table 1).
We evaluated the presence of secular trends according to dis-
tance bin before and after power plant retirements (Table 1).
Across bins, we observed increased maternal education, propor-
tion of non-Hispanic Asian births, and reduced neighborhood
poverty. In the 10–20-km bin we noted a reduction after retire-
ment in the proportion of non-Hispanic white births; in the
0–5-km bin we saw a decreased proportion of Hispanic births
and an increased proportion of non-Hispanic Asian births.

 Estimated association of power plant retirement and
preterm birth
On average, the prevalence of preterm birth decreased near
power plants after retirement (Figure 2), with larger reductions
closer to power plants (Web Figure 3). As anticipated in a DID
design, unadjusted and adjusted analyses yielded similar esti-
mates (Figure 3, Web Figure 4, Web Table 2). In adjusted analy-
ses, we found that power plant retirements resulted in a decrease
in the proportion of preterm births at a distance of 0–5 km (−0.019,
95% CI: −0.031, −0.008) and between 5–10 km (−0.015, 95%
CI: −0.024, −0.007) (Figure 3A). For the 0–5-km area, this cor-
responds to a reduction in preterm birth from 7.0% to 5.1%. In
analyses stratified by timing of birth, we found significant asso-
ciations only for moderate to late preterm birth (Figure 3B: for
0–5 km, β = −0.020, 95% CI: −0.031, −0.009; for 5–10 km β =
−0.016, 95% CI: −0.025, −0.008).
Race/ethnicity and educational-attainment subgroups
Subgroup analyses indicated a stronger association between
power plant retirement and preterm birth among non-Hispanic
black and Asian mothers compared with non-Hispanic white
and Hispanic mothers (Figure 3C). We did not observe differ-
ential associations with maternal educational attainment (Web
Figure 5).
Sensitivity analyses
We observed variability in wind direction by power plant
over the study period (Web Figure 6). Among mothers living
0–5 km from power plants and downwind 1–90 days and ≥90
days during pregnancy, we found that retirements were fol-
lowed by a decreased proportion of preterm birth: −0.039,
95% CI: −0.082, 0.007, and −0.026, 95% CI: −0.059, 0.011,
respectively. We did not observe, however, a reduction pre-
term birth among downwind mothers living 5–10 km from
power plants (Web Table 3). We also specified a model including
the number of block-group–level foreclosures in the year of birth
and found no change to the results (Web Table 4). Data from the
Environmental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air
Quality model suggested a reduction in annual average PM2.5
concentrations across distance bins, with a larger median change
in the 0–5-km (−1.3 μg/m3) and 5–10-km (−1.2 μg/m3) bins
compared with the 10–20-km bin (−0.6 μg/m3) (Web Figure 7).
As a negative control analysis, we repeated analyses with plants
that did not retire during the study period. As expected, we
observed no association between the negative control plants
and change in the proportion of preterm birth (Web Table 5).
DISCUSSION
We used a natural experiment in California when 8 oil and
coal power plant retired to quantify the relationship with preterm
birth. After retirements, we found reductions in the probability of
preterm birth within 5 km and 5–10 km, using pregnant women
living 10–20 km away to control for secular trends. These im-
provements were limited to moderate and late preterm birth,
larger in magnitude among non-Hispanic Asian and black
women, and they did not differ by maternal educational
attainment. A negative control analysis, in which we re-
fitted our models to consider plants that did not retire dur-
ing the study period, was null, suggesting that our results
are not likely due to secular trends. In light of present dis-
parities in environmental exposures and birth outcomes
(18, 21, 25), our findings may have relevance to future
policy decisions regarding power plant retirement priori-
ties and transitions to renewable and cleaner energy.
We hypothesized that reduced air pollution after power plant
retirement accounted for the majority of the reduced probability
of preterm birth nearby. Air pollution may increase risk of pre-
term birth by altering normally progressing gestation through
activation of proinflammatory cytokines (47), preeclampsia
(48), growth restriction (49), or increased maternal susceptibility
to infection (22). While we were unable to track individual-level
changes in air pollution exposure, data from the US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air

 Quality model indicated reductions in PM2.5 near retiring power
plants and reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides from the
power plants of 98% in the year after retirement (50).
Many prior preterm birth studies have focused on traffic-
related air pollution or nonspecific particulate matter expo-
sures (21, 22, 51–56), although some have evaluated source-
specific emissions (11, 22, 54). Four studies estimated the
relationship between living near power plants and adverse
birth outcomes (5–8). Among 400,000 births in Florida, Ha
et al. (6) reported a 2.2% increase in odds of preterm deliv-
ery for each 5 km closer to any power plant. When stratify-
ing by fuel type, they did not find a significant association
between coal plants and preterm birth but did observe an
association with oil plants. Due to sample size considera-
tions, we did not stratify by oil and coal fuel type.
Studies that have evaluated differential associations between
air pollution and preterm birth according to race/ethnicity or
socioeconomic status have generally found stronger relation-
ships among racial/ethnic minorities and those of lower socio-
economic status (21, 52, 54, 56). Pereira et al. (22) used a
within-woman design, to account for genetic and social deter-
minants of preterm birth, and reported a significant association
between PM2.5 and preterm birth only among black and His-
panic mothers. Other work has reported stronger associations
between air pollution and preterm birth among mothers of high-
er socioeconomic status (57). Such paradoxical associations
may arise, for example, when socioeconomically advantaged
black mothers experience race-related stressors (18, 58) that
may amplify associations between air pollutants and adverse
birth outcomes. We identified larger associations among
non-Hispanic Asian and black mothers. The larger associa-
tions for non-Hispanic black mothers might have arisen
because these women lived closer on average to the power
plants within a given bin and therefore likely had higher ex-
posure levels, and higher preterm birth rates at baseline,
implying the potential for greater absolute difference.
Studies drawing on natural experiments to evaluate the role
of air pollution in preterm birth have yielded heterogeneous re-
sults. In Utah, married, non-Hispanic white mothers in their first
or second trimester of pregnancy when a steel mill closed in
1986–1987 were less likely to give birth prematurely than those
who became pregnant before plant closure (31). No association
was found between reduced PM10 or nitrogen dioxide levels
during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and preterm birth (35). Dur-
ing 2006–2010, Beijing had mean PM10 levels of 135 μg/m3,
far exceeding California’s annual average PM10 standard of 20
μg/m3. In Uruguay, when volcanic eruption led to an increase in
average PM10 levels from 21.2 μg/m3 to 46 μg/m3, Balsa et al.
(33) observed a 10% increase in odds of preterm birth for a
10-μg/m3 increase in third-trimester PM10 levels. Currie
and Walker (34) found reduced prematurity (defined as <38
weeks of gestation) among mothers living within 2 km of
major roads, compared with mothers living 2–10 km away,
when the introduction of the E-ZPass in Pennsylvania and
New Jersey reduced air pollution. We used a similar DID
design with mothers living 10–20 km from power plants to
control for secular trends.
Air pollution may be differentially associated with sponta-
neous and medically indicated preterm birth (51, 59). Our
birth records did not include that information, thereby prevent-
ing analyses stratified by type of labor onset, which might be
preferable because hospital-specific practices (i.e., medically
induced labor driven by hospital, physician, and patient prac-
tices/beliefs) can lead to spatial confounding (51). However,
our DID study design likely limited confounding related to
hospital practices and other potential community-level con-
founding variables.
Natural experiments have other strengths. Ethically, one can-
not randomize exposure to participants, but with natural ex-
periments, one can approximate experimental designs while
effectively enrolling whole populations (27, 28). Despite these
strengths, there are limitations related to DID model assumptions.

 We assumed that power plant retirements were the only reason for
the larger reduction in prevalence of preterm birth in the 0–5-km
and 5–10-km bins compared with the 10–20-km bin during the
study period. The assumption of parallel trends, that the rate of
change of preterm birth in the treatment and comparison groups
would have been the same in the absence of power plant retire-
ments, is untestable in our study because we have just one before
and after period. A time-varying imbalance between the treatment
and comparison groups that we did not adjust for in our analysis
could have biased our results (44). Last, power plants do not emit
pollution uniformly but rather ramp up production during times of
high demand. The DID design did not permit us to estimate an
exposure-response, but rather to test for an association of preterm
birth with active versus inactive power plants.
We were unable to geocode the residential addresses of 9.2%
of the original 5.4 million singleton births. These nongeocoded
births did not differ markedly from geocoded births on variables
such as age and educational attainment (data not shown), but
this omission may have introduced selection bias (60). Of the
57,005 births examined, data were also missing for race/ethnic-
ity (n = 637), educational attainment (n = 1,178), and number
of prenatal visits (n = 292). We used missing indicators and
saw little difference in unadjusted and adjusted results; in DID
analyses, covariates primarily improve precision of estimates
rather than providing control for confounding. A further limita-
tion includes potential exposure misclassification because we
based estimates on residential distance from power plants at the
time of birth. We were unable to consider residential mobility
or time spent away from home.
In conclusion, our study showed that coal and oil power
plant retirements in California were associated with reductions
in preterm birth, providing evidence of the potential health
benefits of policies that favor the replacement of oil and coal
with other fuel types for electricity generation. Moreover,
given that effect estimates were stronger among non-Hispanic
black women, such cleaner energy policies could potentially
not only improve birth outcomes overall but also reduce racial
disparities in preterm birth.
