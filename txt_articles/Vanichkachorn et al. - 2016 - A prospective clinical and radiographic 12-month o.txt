Abstract
Purpose
This multicenter clinical study was performed to
assess the safety and effectiveness of Trinity Evolution�
(TE), a viable cellular bone allograft, in combination with a
PEEK interbody spacer and supplemental anterior fixation
in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and
fusion (ACDF).
Methods
In a prospective, multi-center study, 31 patients
that presented with symptomatic cervical degeneration at
one vertebral level underwent ACDF with a PEEK inter-
body spacer (Orthofix, Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) and
supplemental anterior fixation. In addition all patients had
the bone graft substitute, Trinity Evolution (Muscu-
loskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, NJ, USA),
placed within the interbody spacer. At 6 and 12 months,
radiographic fusion was evaluated as determined by inde-
pendent radiographic review of angular motion (B4�) from
flexion/extension
X-rays
combined
with
presence
of
bridging bone across the adjacent endplates on thin cut CT
scans. In addition other metrics were measured including
function as assessed by the Neck Disability Index (NDI),
and neck and arm pain as assessed by individual Visual
Analog Scales (VAS).
Results
The fusion rate for patients using a PEEK inter-
body spacer in combination with TE was 78.6 % at
6 months and 93.5 % at 12 months. When considering
high risk factors, 6-month fusion rates for patients that
were current or former smokers, diabetic, overweight or
obese/extremely obese were 70 % (7/10), 100 % (1/1),
70 % (7/10), and 82 % (9/11), respectively. At 12 months,
the fusion rates were 100 % (12/12), 100 % (2/2), 100 %
(11/11) and 85 % (11/13), respectively. Neck function, and
neck/arm pain were found to significantly improve at both
time points. No serious allograft related adverse events
occurred and none of the 31 patients had subsequent
additional cervical surgeries.
Conclusions
Patients undergoing single-level ACDF with
TE in combination with a PEEK interbody spacer and
supplemental anterior fixation had a high rate of fusion
success without serious allograft-related adverse events.

Introduction
Since the development of the anterior approach for anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) [1] many different
combinations of graft materials and interbody spacer
devices have been explored. This includes autografts [2],
allografts [3], and interbody spacers made from polyether–
ether–ketone (PEEK) [4], and porous tantalum [5]. Auto-
grafts have traditionally been considered the gold standard

 due to high fusion rates, although there are disadvantages
associated with autograft use such as donor site morbidity,
additional time in the operating room, and uncertain quality
of the patient’s own bone [6, 7]. Despite these drawbacks,
autograft has remained the preferred choice since its usage
has been reported to be associated with a higher fusion rate
than allograft. For example, a recent meta-analysis for one-
and two-level stand-alone ACDF comparing autograft and
allograft showed a higher fusion rate for autograft for both
single level and multi-level ACDF cases at 12 months
(pooled results 92 vs. 78 %) [3]. Although no clinical
superiority was established, allograft ACDFs were found to
have delayed time to fusion [3]. Conversely, other studies
have found no difference in fusion rates between autografts
and allografts for multi-level ACDFs using rigid plate
fixation [8].
PEEK ACDF devices are gaining acceptance as the
new standard for treatment of cervical disc disease [9], as
they show similar fusion rates as autografts [10, 11].
PEEK cages for ACDF surgeries have the added advan-
tages of increased cervical lordosis, immediate biome-
chanical support, increased intervertebral height and easy
fusion assessment through X-ray and/or CT. In order to
aid in fusion for high risk patients PEEK interbody
devices are often combined with autografts, allografts or
bone graft substitutes such as hydroxyapatite for single
and multi-level ACDFs [12–16]. While there currently are
a number of products on the market to minimize or
replace the use of autografts for ACDFs, few of these
products contain all three essential bone-forming elements
of
autografts
(osteogenicity,
osteoconductivity,
and
osteoinductivity [17]) in a single, standalone product.
Trinity Evolution� (TE) is a cryopreserved allograft that
consists of viable cellular cancellous bone matrix and
demineralized cortical bone. It possesses all three of the
key properties for successful bone grafting (osteogenic
cells including mesenchymal stem cells and osteopro-
genitors, osteoinductive proteins, and an osteoconductive
matrix [18]) and can be considered to be a practical
alternative to autograft. TE has the advantages of having
more predictable quality than autograft bone in cases
where the source of the autograft would be from high risk
donors. TE is only produced from healthy donors that are
strictly screened and carefully processed to maintain the
viability of endogenous osteogenic cells and the osteoin-
ductivity of the demineralized cortical component. The
purpose of this multicenter clinical study was to assess
the safety and effectiveness of the TE viable cellular bone
allograft in combination with a PEEK interbody spacer in
cervical arthrodesis.
Materials and methods
Study population
From October 2009 to June 2012, a prospective, multi-
center, study was conducted at 4 investigational sites to
evaluate Trinity Evolution� in combination with a PEEK
interbody spacer for ACDF surgery. All patients with
symptomatic cervical degeneration at one vertebral level
between C3 and T1 were eligible for the study and those
enrolled underwent ACDF with an Orthofix PEEK inter-
body spacer (Orthofix, Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) and
supplemental anterior fixation. Patients who had previously
undergone a cervical fusion were included (except if the
prior interbody surgery was at the same level). IRB
approval was obtained for each site prior to the initiation of
enrollment. Exclusion criteria encompassed the use of any
other bone graft or bone graft substitute in addition to or in
place of Trinity Evolution in and around the interbody
spacer.
Patients
were
examined
pre-operatively,
at
6 months (±1 month), and at 12 months (±2 months). A
total of 31 patients were found eligible for the study
(Table 1). The 31 patients received single level fusions at
the vertebral locations between C3/C4 and C6/C7 with
Trinity Evolution being placed within and around each
cage (Table 2). All 31 patients were evaluated for primary
and secondary endpoints at both 6 and 12 months.
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint was radiographic fusion status based
on independent review of CT scans and radiographic
review of angular motion (Medical Metrics Inc., Houston,
TX, USA). Specifically the criteria for fusion was the
presence of bridging bone across the adjacent endplates on
thin cut CT scans with sagittal and coronal reconstructions
in addition to B4� angular motion from flexion/extension
X-rays (Fig. 1).
Secondary endpoints
Secondary endpoints included function as assessed by the
Neck Disability Index (NDI), and neck and arm pain as
assessed by individual Visual Analog Scales (VAS). Based
on the literature, the following changes to the examined
parameters were considered clinically significant improve-
ments [19]:
1.
A change in NDI of more than 17.3 % points
2.
A change in VAS arm pain of more than 41 mm
3.
A change in VAS neck pain of more than 26 mm

 Adverse events
All adverse events were collected per protocol during the
evaluation period. Following the study all adverse events
were adjudicated by an independent medical consultant,
which included tissue processor cross referencing of the
allograft lot numbers associated with the adverse event to
determine if the lot had previously been associated with
any other adverse event.
Statistical analysis
Fusion is presented as the percentage of patients fused.
Secondary parameters are presented as the mean and
standard error (SE). A multiple paired t test with a subse-
quent Bonferroni correction was done to determine if
changes from baseline in the secondary outcomes measures
were significant. The statistical analyses were performed
using SAS (version 9.3, Cary, NC, USA). Significance was
set at p \ 0.05.
Results
Of the 31 patients, 28 completed their 6-month study visit,
while all 31 completed their 12-month study visit.
Fusion
For this study, the fusion rate for patients using Orthofix
PEEK interbody spacers in combination with the allograft
trinity evolution, was 78.6 % at 6 months and 93.5 % at
12 months. Specifically, when considering high risk factors
6-month fusion rates for patients that were current or for-
mer smokers, diabetic, overweight or obese/extremely
obese were 70 % (7/10), 100 % (1/1), 70 % (7/10), and
82 % (9/11), respectively. At 12 months, the fusion rates
were 100 % (12/12), 100 % (2/2), 100 % (11/11) and 85 %
(11/13), respectively.
Secondary endpoints
Mirroring the primary endpoint, neck function was found to
significantly improve frombaseline to 6 months (p\0.0001).
In addition, neck function was significantly improved from 6
to 12 months (p\0.0040) (Fig. 2). Similarly, both neck and
arm (right and left) pain decreased significantly at 6 and
12 months relative to pre-op assessments (Fig. 3).
Adverse events
During the time course of the study the 31 patients
encountered a total of 26 distinct adverse events (AEs),
which were specific to 16 distinct patients. These adverse
events included carpal tunnel syndrome, minor pain,
numbness, permanent and/or unresolved pain, and swel-
ling. Subsequent medical adjudication of the 26 adverse
events found that no AEs were definitely or probably
related to Trinity Evolution. However, five AEs were found
to be possibly related to Trinity Evolution with three of
them of mild severity and two of moderate severity.
Specifically two were related to permanent and/or unre-
solved pain, two were related to numbness and one was

 related to posterior neck pain. Two of these AE’s resolved
within 30 days of recording, while the remaining persisted
intermittently following the study. None of the 31 patients
had subsequent additional cervical surgeries.
Discussion
When conservative care fails to alleviate the pain and
neurological deficits caused by degenerative disc disease in
the cervical spine, the most common recourse is surgical
decompression of the affected nerves and/or spinal cord.
Decompression is often accomplished via an anterior
approach whereby essentially the entire disc as well as any
bony osteophytes and ligaments that are compressing the
spinal cord and/or nerves are removed. While usually
successful at decompressing affected neural structures, the
decompression often results in collapse of the disc space,
instability and recurrent symptomatology. As mentioned
previously, most anterior cervical decompressions are

 therefore followed by insertion of a structural interbody
spacer such as an autograft, allograft, or a synthetic spacer
filled with a bone graft. As the results indicate, TE in
combination with a PEEK interbody spacer is a viable
option which led to a 94 % fusion rate in this study at the
final time point based on radiographic evidence of motion
and bony bridging. This fusion rate, although not statisti-
cally evaluated, is comparable to that reported for single
level ACDFs using standalone autografts (97 %) and other
allografts (87 %) at 12 months per radiographic evidence
[3]. In addition the results compare favorably to fusion
rates for other single level ACDF studies using PEEK
cages filled with hydroxyapatite (61 and 100 % at 6 and
12 months, respectively) [12], various allografts (100 % at
10–12 months, but not including higher risk patients) [13,
14], and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) packed
with
bone
marrow-saturated
collagen/hydroxyapatite
wafers (100 % at 12 months) [20]. In addition, some of
these studies [3, 14] only used bridging bone as the fusion
criteria thus potentially achieving more favorable fusion
rates compared to a more stringent criteria.
As evident by the many studies mentioned there remains
an intense search for an autograft replacement which will
encompass the three important autograft components,
namely viable osteogenic cells, an osteoconductive matrix
and osteoinductive growth factors. In addition to the ref-
erenced potential clinical solutions to this problem some
pre-clinical studies [21] have also examined the use of
degradable radiolucent cage filler (PLCL) in PEEK cages
with or without adipose stem cells or autograft. This study
showed no enhancement of the rate and number of inter-
body fusions, but with a trend towards superior results with
autograft, indicating that all three autograft components
may indeed be needed to achieve an autograft alternative.
When stratifying the 31 patients into high-risk groups it
was found that the fusion rates ranging from 70 to 100 % at
6 months to 85–100 % at 12 months were still comparable
to the literature where no high-risk patients were included,
in particular at 12 months (92–100 %) [10, 11, 13, 14, 22].
Having a comparable fusion rates to other PEEK/allograft
ACDF studies that have less stringent fusion criteria and do
not include a majority of high risk patients indicates that
Trinity Evolution may help negate any physiological bar-
rier to fusion during ACDF that is associated with high risk
factors. In addition, the current study also compared
favorable to other high-risk patient studies where smokers
underwent ACDF with allograft and anterior plating (100
vs. 91 % at 12 months) [22].
The NDI results indicated a significant mean reduction
over time with a 53 and 62 % drop from pre-op to 6 and
12 months, respectively. However, based on the set criteria
in the literature the changes seen on an individual basis
were only clinically significant for 68 and 74 % of the
patients at 6 and 12 months, respectively [19]. Despite this,
these results do parallel those found by Faldini et al. at
6 months (61 % mean reduction in NDI) [14]. Similarly
the mean VAS neck scores showed significant changes
over time, but individual scores indicated that only 64 and
74 % of the patients saw clinically significant changes at 6
and 12 months, respectively. Although a clear correlation
between fusion status and NDI/VAS scores is not found,
the results are similar to those found in the literature
despite these studies being done without including a
majority of high risk patients [14]. This favorable com-
parison and the fact that 75 % of the patients in this study
had at least one high risk factor indicates that TE may help
promote fusion during ACDF even for high risk patients.
Finally, while 26 adverse events were encountered
during the course of this study, only five of these were
deemed possibly related to Trinity Evolution, and were
only categorized as of mild (three) or moderate (two)
severity, with two of these resolving within 30 days. This
in combination with the fact that no subsequent cervical
surgeries were performed on any of the 31 subjects indi-
cates that Trinity Evolution is safe to use as an interbody
filler during single-level cervical fusion. The study has the
limitation of a low number of patients both overall and for
some of the stratified high risk groups. However, a few of
the high risk groups consisted of at least ten patients
enabling the reader to still evaluate the potential for the
novel allograft. Despite this, Trinity Evolution can also be
evaluated irrespectively of any of the stratified groups,
which, as it has been shown, still reveals positive results.
In conclusion, patients who received Trinity Evolution in
combination with a PEEK interbody device during single
level cervical fusion surgery had a high rate of fusion suc-
cess both overall and when stratified into high risk groups,
while having no serious allograft related adverse events.
