Introduction
With the global epidemic of obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) disease and its associated 
comorbidities including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease have emerged as a significant public 
health problem (1). Approximately 44% of patients with NAFLD progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) (2), the more severe phenotype of the disease characterized by hepatic inflammation and fibrosis 
in addition to steatosis. Patients with NASH fibrosis are at high risk for rapid progression to end-stage liver 
disease (3). Currently, NASH is the second leading cause of liver transplantation among adults on the wait-
ing list (4). Although NASH treatment is limited to weight reduction, given the large number of patients 
that are unable to achieve and maintain weight loss, there is a critical, unmet need for effective pharmaco-
logical therapy with antiinflammatory and antifibrotic properties.
Excess circulating saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) in patients with NASH (5) culminates in hepatocyte 
lipoapoptosis (6, 7), a pathologic hallmark of NASH that correlates with disease severity (8, 9). Mixed-
lineage kinase type 3 (MLK3) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein 
kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that functions in a phosphorylation relay module to control the activity 
of downstream MAPKs (10, 11), and mediates SFA-induced hepatocyte lipoapoptosis (12, 13). Likewise, 
the role of MLK3 as a proapoptotic kinase has been established in different models of cell injury (14–16).
In addition to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis, hepatic lipotoxicity is associated with inflammatory infiltrates, 
which further promote liver injury and fibrosis (17, 18). Trafficking of inflammatory monocytes from the 
blood and activation of the resident macrophages within the liver are essential pathogenic mechanisms in 
the progression of NAFLD (17). At the early stage of NASH, blood monocytes, recruited into the liver in 
With the increase in obesity worldwide, its associated comorbidities, including nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), have become a public health problem that still lacks effective therapy. We 
have previously reported that mixed-lineage kinase 3–deficient (MLK3-deficient) mice are protected 
against diet-induced NASH. Given the critical need to identify new therapeutic agents, we sought 
to examine whether the small-molecule MLK3 inhibitor URMC099 would be effective in reversing 
diet-induced murine NASH. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a diet high in saturated fat, fructose, 
and cholesterol (FFC), or a chow diet for 24 weeks. Mice were treated with either URMC099 (10 
mg/kg) twice daily by intraperitoneal injection or its vehicle during the last 2 weeks of the feeding 
study. FFC-fed mice receiving URMC099 had similar body weight, caloric intake, homeostatic 
model assessment of insulin resistance, metabolic phenotype, and hepatic steatosis compared 
with vehicle-treated mice. Furthermore, FFC-fed mice treated with URMC099 had less hepatic 
macrophage infiltration, activation, and proinflammatory polarization, as well as less liver injury 
and fibrosis when compared with vehicle-treated mice. In conclusion, URMC099 is well tolerated 
in mice without obvious toxicities and appears to be efficacious in reversing diet-induced NASH. 
Hence, URMC099 may serve as a therapeutic agent in human NASH.

response to the liver microenvironment, undergo proinflammatory polarization (19), resulting in cytotoxic 
and inflammatory activation (20). Proinflammatory monocytes promote hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activa-
tion and transforming growth factor β release, leading to the progression of liver fibrosis (21).
We have reported previously that MLK3–/– mice are protected against liver injury, fibrosis, and inflam-
mation in a murine model of NASH-inducing diet (22, 23). We also demonstrated that hepatocytes under 
lipotoxic stress release chemotactic extracellular vesicles (EVs) by an MLK3-dependent mechanism 
(23); these vesicles are enriched with the potent macrophage chemotactic ligand (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 
(CXCL10), expression of which is regulated by MLK3 in hepatocytes (11). Furthermore, mice fed the 
NASH-inducing diet have increased CXCL10 in plasma EVs in an MLK3-dependent fashion (23), and 
CXCL10–/– mice are protected against diet-induced NASH (24). Likewise, MLK3 proinflammatory proper-
ties have been recently recognized in different disease models (25–27).
Bolstered by our data supporting MLK3 as a crucial proinflammatory and proapoptotic mediator in 
our preclinical in vitro and in vivo model of NASH (22, 23), we elected to test the protective effect of the 
MLK3 pharmacological inhibitor URMC099 in our murine model of diet-induced NASH and obesity. 
URMC099 is a selective small-molecule MLK3 pharmacological inhibitor that was developed for human 
use. URMC099 has nanomolar potency for MLK3 inhibition and a favorable metabolic and toxicity profile 
(25). Herein, we demonstrate a reduction in liver inflammation, liver injury, and fibrosis in URMC099-
treated mice, independent of effects on weight gain and parameters of the metabolic syndrome. We also 
demonstrate a direct antiinflammatory role of URMC099 through the attenuation of macrophage activa-
tion under lipotoxic conditions in vitro.
Results
The metabolic phenotype of  URMC099-treated FFC-fed mice. A diet high in saturated fat, fructose, and cho-
lesterol (FFC) induced a significant increase in body weight compared with the standard chow over the 
24-week study period in both URMC099-treated and vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1A). Total body weights 
were similar between URMC099-treated and vehicle-treated mice on standard chow or the FFC diet (Fig-
ure 1A). The FFC diet–induced increase in body weight is primarily due to an increase in fat mass, as we 
previously reported (24). Caloric intake was similar between the FFC-fed mice during the treatment period 
with either URMC099 or vehicle (Figure 1B). No differences in body composition (percentage of lean 
mass versus fat mass) were observed between the FFC-fed mice treated with either URMC099 or vehicle 
(Figure 1C). Furthermore, energy expenditure (Figure 1D), physical activity (Figure 1E), and respiratory 
quotient (Figure 1F) were similar between FFC-fed URMC099-treated versus vehicle-treated mice. Like-
wise, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Figure 1G) was similar between 
the 2 treatment groups on FFC diet, suggesting that URMC099 does not affect insulin response. Of note, 
the HOMA-IR in the current study was lower than what we previously reported (24), which we attributed 
to the weight loss that mice experienced over the last 2 weeks of the study period, secondary to the twice-
per-day intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections and the stress caused by the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitor-
ing System (CLAMS) study (Figure 1H); the weight loss was similar between the groups on the same diet 
regardless of the treatment condition. Thus, overall FFC-fed mice tolerated URMC099 well; mice were 
active during the study period without noted adverse effects or significant weight loss when compared with 
vehicle-treated mice on the same diet. URMC099 treatment did not alter the metabolic phenotype induced 
by the FFC diet in our murine NASH model.
URMC099 treatment in mice reduces FFC-induced activation of  MLK3 downstream targets in the liver. To show 
that URMC099 treatment exerts a direct inhibition of MLK3 downstream targets, we demonstrate signifi-
cant reduction of the FFC diet–induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 
(MAP2Ks) MKK3/MKK6, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 (Figure 2A), as well 
as significant reduction of the mRNA expression of CXCL10 (Figure 2B) in liver homogenates of the 
FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice on the same diet. These findings are 
consistent with our previous in vitro report that hepatocyte lipotoxicity triggers the activation of a MAPK 
signaling cascade consisting of the MAP3K MLK3, which activates the MAP2Ks MMK3/MKK6, and 
its downstream MAPK p38, resulting in the subsequent induction of the chemokine CXCL10. Likewise, 
URMC099 treatment in vitro inhibits this signaling cascade in hepatocytes under lipotoxic stress (11, 23).
URMC099 treatment does not reduce FFC diet–induced hepatic steatosis in mice. Histological examination of the 
liver by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain displayed a similar extent of steatosis in the FFC-fed mice treated

with URMC099 versus vehicle (Figure 3A). Likewise, steatosis assessment by coherent anti-Stokes Raman 
scattering (CARS) microscopy showed similar neutral triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the hepatocytes of 
the FFC-fed, URMC099- and vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3B). This observation was further confirmed bio-
chemically by assessing the TG content in liver tissue, which was similar in FFC-fed, URMC099- and vehi-
cle-treated mice (Figure 3C). These findings were consistent with the similar liver/body weight ratio in the

FFC-fed, URMC099- and vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3D). Although there were prominent inflammatory 
infiltrates in the FFC-fed, vehicle-treated mice, these infiltrates were reduced in the URMC099-treated mice 
on the same diet (Figure 3A). Thus, FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice had hepatic steatosis similar to that of 
vehicle-treated mice on the same obesity-inducing diet, but display reduced hepatic inflammatory infiltrates.
URMC099 treatment protects mice against FFC diet–induced macrophage-associated hepatic inflammation. Based 
on our previous observation that MLK3 activation in hepatocytes under lipotoxic conditions induces the 
upregulation of the potent macrophage chemotactic ligand CXCL10 (11, 23), we first assessed the expres-
sion of CXCL10 in whole liver by quantitative real-time PCR to assess whether systemic administration 
of URMC099 suppressed CXCL10 induction in the liver. Interestingly, URMC099 treatment significant-
ly reduced CXCL10 hepatic mRNA expression in FFC-fed mice (Figure 2A). Likewise, CXCL10 serum 
level was reduced in FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice when compared with vehicle-treated mice on the 
same diet (Figure 4A). We then assessed whether the hepatic downregulation of CXCL10 is associated 
with reduced macrophage hepatic infiltration, a key element in the sterile inflammatory response in murine 
NASH (24). We examined hepatic macrophage infiltration by immunohistochemistry for macrophage galac-
tose-specific lectin (Mac-2), a marker of macrophages engaged in phagocytosis (28). The FFC diet caused an 
increase in the Mac-2–immunopositive surface area, which was significantly reduced with URMC099 treat-
ment but not with vehicle treatment (Figure 4B); this effect is consistent with the influence of URMC099 
on macrophages with a pathologic phenotype in a different disease model (5). Likewise, vehicle-treated, 
FFC-fed mice had a significant increase in the hepatic mRNA expression of the general macrophage and 
monocyte markers cluster of differentiation (CD) 14, CD68, and F4/80 (Figure 4C and ref. 29), which were 
reduced in the FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice. In addition, mRNA expression of IL-12p40, a known 
proinflammatory (M1) marker (30), was increased in the vehicle-treated, FFC-fed mice, and significantly 
reduced with URMC099 treatment in the mice on the same diet (Figure 4D). Moreover, the expression of 
blood monocyte–derived macrophage markers, including the inflammatory monocyte surface lymphocyte 
antigen 6 complex (Ly6C), and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) (31), were significantly augmented 
with the FFC diet, and reduced with URMC099 treatment (Figure 4E). Furthermore, mRNA expression of

the macrophage cytokine and chemokine activation markers tumor necrosis factor tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were increased in the FFC-fed, vehicle-treated mice, 
but significantly reduced with URMC099 treatment in the mice on the same diet (Figure 4F). These data 
are consistent with the reduced markers of macrophage hepatic accumulation and activation observed in 
MLK3–/– mice on an obesity-inducing diet (refs. 22, 23, and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.94488DS1). Taken together, these data 
demonstrate an aggregate reduction of proinflammatory macrophage hepatic infiltration, macrophage acti-
vation, and proinflammatory polarization in the FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice.
FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice are protected against FFC diet–induced liver injury and fibrosis. URMC099-

reduced liver injury and cholestasis (Figure 5A). Likewise, FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice were rela-
tively protected against FFC diet–induced lipoapoptosis, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in the 
number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling–
positive (TUNEL-positive) cells in the URMC099-treated mice versus vehicle-treated mice (Figure 5B).

in vitro. We employed Huh7 cells treated with the toxic lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and dem-
onstrated a very potent URMC099-dose-dependent reduction of hepatocyte lipoapoptosis (Figure 5C). 
We next assessed the protective effect of URMC099 on the FFC diet–induced liver fibrosis by examining 
Sirius red staining to identify the extent of collagen deposition in liver sections. Sirius red–positive surface 
area was significantly reduced in FFC-fed, URMC099-treated mice versus vehicle-treated mice (Figure 
5D). These findings were confirmed by second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for collagen fibrils 
(Figure 5E). Furthermore, we examined the expression of fibrosis-related genes, including osteopontin, 
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), and collagen 1a1. The mRNA levels of these genes were 
increased in the FFC-fed mice, with a significant reduction in the URMC099-treated mice versus vehicle-
treated mice on the same diet (Figure 5F). Thus, URMC099 appears to be protective against the FFC 
diet–induced hepatic injury and fibrosis.
URMC099 reduces macrophage activation and migration under lipotoxic conditions. We have demonstrated previ-
ously that the pharmacological MLK3 inhibitor URMC099 reduces CXCL10 induction (11), and release by 
lipotoxic hepatocytes via EVs (23). Furthermore, we have reported that CXCL10-enriched EVs released from 
lipotoxic hepatocytes induce macrophage chemotaxis (23). In the current study, we sought to advance these 
observations and explore whether URMC099 has a direct protective effect against macrophage activation and 
chemotaxis under lipotoxic conditions in vitro. We employed LPC as a proximal mediator of lipotoxicity. 
LPC is the intracellular metabolite of the SFA palmitate; LPC mimics all the cellular toxicity of palmitate 
(32–34). We employed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate the role of gut-derived bacterial products in exac-
erbating the hepatic inflammation in NASH (35, 36). Since proinflammatory signaling often converges on 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to induce transcriptional regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β (37), 
we examined macrophage activation under lipotoxic conditions by assessing the mRNA expression of IL-1β 
and TNF-α in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPC and LPS with or without 
URMC099. Addition of LPS to LPC treatment resulted in an exponential increase in mRNA expression of 
macrophage activation markers, which were significantly reduced in the presence of URMC099 (Figure 6A). 
Likewise, URMC099 also reduced LPC-induced activation of Kupffer cells, as assessed by reduced mRNA 
expression of TNF-α and MCP1 (Figure 6B). To confirm these findings in a monocyte, we employed the 
human monocyte cell line THP1; URMC099 also reduced LPC-induced activation of THP1, as demonstrat-
ed by reduced mRNA expression of TNF-α and MCP1 (Figure 6C). Furthermore, treatment of BMDMs with 
LPC resulted in NF-κB pathway activation as evidenced by increased nuclear translocation of p65, an NF-κB 
component responsible for its transcriptional activity, which was reduced in the presence of the MLK3 inhibi-
tor URMC099 (Figure 6D). We next examined, using a coculture system, whether LPC induces macrophage 
chemotaxis directly or through its lipotoxic effect on hepatocytes. We employed primary mouse hepatocytes 
(PMHs) or Huh7 cells that were seeded in a 24-well plate and treated overnight with either vehicle or LPC, 
with or without 1 μM URMC099. The next morning, the treatment media were replaced with serum-free 
media; hepatocytes were incubated with the serum-free media for an additional 3 hours to allow ample time 
for potential chemokine secretion by hepatocytes. Fluorescently labeled BMDM or THP-1 cells were seeded 
on the FluoroBlok inserts creating a coculture system. BMDM or THP-1 cells were allowed to migrate for 4 
hours; migrated cells were quantified by the Celigo Imaging Cytometer. We observed a significant increase in 
macrophage migration toward the hepatocytes that were treated with LPC, which was significantly reduced 
in the presence of URMC099 (Figure 6E). Interestingly, we did not observe significant migration of macro-
phages toward the wells that had only LPC-treatment media without hepatocytes (data not shown). Taken 
together, these observations suggest that URMC099 reduces macrophage activation induced by lipotoxic 
treatment, bacterial products, or both. Lipotoxic treatment, per se, did not exert a direct chemotactic effect on 
macrophages, while conditioned media from hepatocytes subjected to lipotoxic treatment induced significant 
macrophage chemotaxis, which was reduced when hepatocytes were incubated with URMC099 during LPC 
treatment. These findings are consistent with our previous observation of reduced LPC-induced hepatocyte 
were stained by Sirius red. Sirius red chromogen was quantified by morphometry using ImageJ software in 15 random ×20 microscopic fields, and 
averaged for each animal (n = 3.) Scale bars: 50 μm. (E) Frozen liver tissue sections were examined by second harmonic generation (SHG) microsco-
py using a ×25 objective. Scale bars: 50 μm. Total RNA was extracted from the liver tissues. The mRNA expression of (F) the profibrogenic markers

expression, and expressed relative to that observed in chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice. Data represent mean ± SEM. Differences between the groups 
were compared using 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ns, non-significant.

that URMC099 attenuates macrophage migration indirectly, partly through suppressing CXCL10-enriched 
EV release by lipotoxic hepatocytes.
Discussion
The principal findings of the present study provide both in vivo validation and mechanistic insights regard-
ing the protective effect of the pharmacological MLK3 inhibitor URMC099 in a murine nutritional model 
of NASH. Our results indicate that (a) URMC099 is well tolerated in FFC-fed mice without any noted 
adverse effects; (b) URMC099 treatment confers several salutary effects in the reversal of established NASH 
that are principally mediated by diminished hepatic macrophage trafficking, infiltration, and activation 
with subsequent decrease in hepatic injury and fibrosis. These observations are independent of obesity and 
the metabolic changes caused by the FFC diet; (c) URMC099 is protective against macrophage activation, 
and hepatocyte lipotoxicity-induced macrophage chemotaxis in vitro (Figure 7). To our knowledge, our 
observations are the first to describe a therapeutic effect of MLK3 pharmacological inhibition in murine 
NASH. These observations are more thoroughly discussed below.
In this study, we used a well-established dietary model of murine NASH induced by the FFC diet (38, 
39). The FFC diet is high in saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol, and was developed to replicate the 
Western fast-food diet composition and recapitulate the histological features of human NASH, including 
neutral lipid accumulation by hepatocytes, ballooned hepatocytes, hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration, 
and liver fibrosis. The model has a high fidelity to the metabolic profile observed in human NASH, includ-
ing obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance (24, 38). In the current study, we demonstrate that the 
FFC diet induces similar changes in both URMC099 and vehicle-treated mice in the HOMA-IR, body fat 
composition, metabolic profiles, hepatic steatosis, and TG content analyses.
URMC099-treated mice on the FFC diet have a relative attenuation of all the injurious features of 
NASH in this model, without an impact on overall obesity when compared with vehicle-treated mice, 
including significantly reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, macrophage hepatic infiltration and activation, and 
hepatic fibrosis compared with vehicle-treated mice on the same diet. Taken together, these observations 
highlight the key role that the MLK3 signaling pathway plays in the pathogenesis of NASH, and support 
MLK3 pharmacological inhibition as a therapeutic target with potential disease-modifying outcomes.
We have previously demonstrated that the pharmacological MLK3 inhibitor URMC099 attenuates 
hepatocyte lipoapoptosis, and sublethal lipotoxic insult manifested by an increase in the EVs released by 
hepatocytes (23). We have shown that URMC099 suppresses CXCL10 induction in hepatocytes under 
lipotoxic conditions (11) and its release in CXCL10-enriched EVs in vitro (23). We further demonstrated 
that these CXCL10-enriched EVs are biologically active and are a very potent inducer of macrophage che-
motaxis (23). In the current study, we extend these observations to show that the lipotoxic mediator LPC 
can activate macrophages, as well as potentiate LPS-induced macrophage activation, an observation con-
sistent with the role of gut-derived bacterial products in exacerbating the hepatic inflammation in NASH 
(35). Interestingly, we found that URMC099 attenuates macrophage activation induced by both bacterial 
products and lipotoxic treatment. We further demonstrate, using a coculture system of hepatocytes and 
macrophages, that URMC099 suppresses macrophage chemotaxis. Exploring the role of URMC099 in 
suppressing hepatocyte-derived EV release in FFC-fed mice is a subject of our future research. Collectively, 
these data suggest that the macrophage is also a target for pharmacological MLK3 inhibition in NASH.
In summary, we report a salutary effect of MLK3 pharmacological inhibition with URMC099 in a pre-
clinical model of NASH pathogenesis independent of body weight and the metabolic syndrome. URMC099 
appears to be well tolerated in mice without noted adverse effects, consistent with our previous data with lon-
ger duration of URMC099 treatment in a different disease model (25, 40). Here, we demonstrate that macro-
phage-associated inflammation is a key player in the MLK3-mediated sterile inflammatory response observed 
30-minute 10 μM LPC treatment, nuclear localization of p65 in BMDMs was assessed by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Scale bars: 
50 μm. The p65-positive nuclei were quantified in 10 random microscopic fields. (E) Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) or Huh7 cells were treated 
overnight with either Veh, LPC, with or without 1 μM URMC099, and the treatment media were replaced with serum-free media in the morning. 
Fluorescently labeled BMDMs or THP-1 cells were seeded on the cell culture inserts; migrated cells were quantified by the Celigo Imaging Cytometer (n

sons test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. ns, non-significant.

in murine NASH. MLK3 inhibition appears to target both the hepa-
tocyte and the macrophage in our murine NASH model. This is not 
without precedent, since previous reports of URMC099-mediated 
neuroprotection in models of HIV-1–associated neurocognitive dis-
orders and Alzheimer’s disease demonstrate its ability to preserve or 
restore neurons while reversing the proinflammatory phenotype of 
the central nervous system–resident professional macrophages (41, 
42). URMC099 reduces both lipotoxic lethal and sublethal hepato-
cyte injury, as well as suppresses both macrophage activation and 
lipotoxic hepatocyte-induced macrophage chemotaxis in vitro. We 
have previously developed a congener of URMC099 (URMC-214; 
US Patents 8,846,909, 8,877,772, and 9,181,247) with a similar pro-
file of antiinflammatory activity that does not penetrate the blood-
brain barrier. We are in the process of devising a large-scale synthetic 
route for this compound and will begin to characterize its activity 
in our NASH models in future studies. Therefore, MLK3 inhibi-
tion with URMC099 represents a promising therapeutic approach 
to treat human NASH. We intend to further develop URMC099 
for use in early-phase human clinical trials to treat NASH, which 
remains an important, unmet medical need.
Methods
Materials. LPC (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved as previously described in detail (33) and used at 10 μM. 
LPS was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used at 50 ng/ml. Primary antisera employed for these studies 
include p65 (catalog 8242), phospho-MKK3/MKK6 (catalog 12280), phospho-p38 (catalog 9211) from 
Cell Signaling Technology, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (MAB 374) from 
Millipore. The MLK3 inhibitor URMC099 (25) utilized in the in vitro and in vivo experiments was pro-
vided by Harris A. Gelbard (University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, USA).
Animals. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) on a 12-hour light/dark cycle 
were used for the experiments. The animals were fed either an FFC diet (40% calories from fat, 0.2% cho-
lesterol, AIN-76A Western Diet, TestDiet) (38) plus fructose 23.1 g/l and glucose 18.9 g/l added to the 
drinking water, or chow (Teklad-Harlan) diet for 24 weeks. Animals were provided free access to diet for 24 
weeks. After 22 weeks on the diet, FFC-fed mice were randomized to either the pharmacological MLK3 
inhibitor URMC099 (25) (10 mg/kg) twice daily or its vehicle solution (5% DMSO, 40% PEG-400, 55% 
normal saline) by i.p. injection for 14 days (n = 5 per group). URMC099 was originally designed as a first-
in-class MLK3 inhibitor for central nervous system applications and has excellent pharmacokinetic char-
acteristics; specifically, it has a nonlinear shape, few hydrogen bond donors, a favorable Log D (2.45), and 
a low polar surface area (51 Å2) (43). The brain concentration of URMC099 remained well above the in 
vitro MLK3 IC50 for 6 hours after injection, and the volume of distribution is well within acceptable limits 
for in vivo use, and suggests URMC099 will not accumulate in tissues. URMC099 is orally bioavailable (F 
= 41%), but was given by i.p. injection on a twice daily dosing regimen to insure adequate coverage of the 
target for this experimental paradigm. Unpublished data and data from other studies in different models of 
systemic and central nervous system HIV-1 infection suggests that once daily dosing (i.p.) may be sufficient 
to achieve therapeutic effects (26, 40). While brain and liver have different cellular and organ architecture, 
these data suggest that URMC099 is likely to achieve therapeutic levels in organs outside the brain without 
interference from key human CYP450 enzymes (43).
Figure 7. Schematic representation of the protective role of URMC099 
against FFC diet–induced murine NASH. URMC099 is protective against 
a high-saturated-fat, -fructose, and -cholesterol (FFC) diet–induced 
hepatocyte apoptosis, CXCL10 induction, and release, resulting in 
reduced macrophage trafficking to the liver. URMC099 also reduces mac-
rophage proinflammatory (M1) polarization and activation as assessed 
by the cytokine (TNF-α) and chemokine (MCP1) expression. NASH,

During the second week of i.p. injections, metabolic parameters including food intake, oxygen con-
sumption, carbon dioxide production, and locomotor activity were measured using a Comprehensive 
Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments) as previously described (44). Blood glu-
cose was measured using a blood glucose monitor (Assure 4) and plasma insulin was measured by Ultra-
Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem. Inc.). HOMA-IR was calculated by using the following 
formula: HOMA-IR = 26 × fasting insulin level (ng/ml) × fasting glucose level (mg/dl)/405 (45). Mice 
were sacrificed under general anesthesia by ketamine/xylazine cocktail (83 mg/kg ketamine/16 mg/kg 
xylazine, i.p.) at the end of week 24. Blood and liver samples were collected.
Immunoblot analysis. Whole-liver lysate was obtained using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% 
Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM PMSF; 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 
leupeptin, pepstatin) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Protein concentrations of 
whole-liver lysates were measured by the Bradford assay method (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of protein 
were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight with the 
primary antibody of interest. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nologies) was used at a dilution of a 1:3,000. GAPDH protein levels were used as loading controls. Proteins 
of interest were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham) and Kodak X-OMAT film.
Liver TG, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and bile acid measurement. Liver TG levels were measured in mouse liver 
homogenates as previously described by Tomita et al. (24). Briefly, 50 mg of wet liver tissue was homog-
enized in a 5% NP-40 solution. An EnzyChrom Triglyceride Kit (BioAssay System) was used for the assay 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Photometric absorbance was read at 570 nm using a Synergy 
H1 microplate reader (BioTek). Serum ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and bile acid were measured 
by a commercially available veterinary chemistry analyzer (VetScan2, Abaxis Veterinary Diagnostics).
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and digital image analysis. Liver histology was performed using tissue fixed 
in 10% formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with H&E and Sirius red

stain. TUNEL-positive cells were quantified using the ApopTag Peroxidase in Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit 
(Millipore), diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories), and 0.5% 
methyl green was used for the counterstain. For immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
liver tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and stained with antibody against Mac-2 (1:250, eBiosci-
ence, catalog 14-5301-82). Bound antibodies were detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) 
and DAB stain; the tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Sirius red–stained areas and Mac-
2–immunopositive areas were quantified by digital image analysis of 10 random fields per slide using the 
ImageJ software (NIH). Frozen liver sections were imaged on a 2-photon confocal microscope, FluoView 
FV1000 MPE (Olympus America), using the CARS microscopy application to identify lipid droplets within 
hepatocytes, and SHG application to identify collagen deposition. Its Mai Tai Deep Sea laser (Spectra-
Physics) was tuned to 800 nm and an XLPlanN 25×/1.05w MP objective lens was used.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was reverse 
transcribed with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT random primers (both from 
Invitrogen). Quantification of gene expression was performed by real-time PCR using SYBR green fluorescence 
on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied). Primers are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Target gene expression 
was calculated using the ΔΔCt method and expression was normalized to GAPDH expression levels.
Apoptosis quantification. Huh7 cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes 
and visualized using a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic nuclei were quantified as previously described (46).
ELISA. ELISA was performed on sera of vehicle-treated and URMC099-treated mice on chow and 
FFC diet using the mouse CXCL10 PicoKine ELISA kit (Boster) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell lines, primary cell isolation, and culture. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 was 
cultured in DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/l), primocin (100 μg/ml) (InvivoGen), and 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS, Gibco) under standard conditions. THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were cultured 
in RPMI-1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). For the activation 
experiment, THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(5 ng/ml). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Mayo 
Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. PMHs were isolated as previously described (47). 
In brief, PMHs were isolated from adult mice by collagenase perfusion and purified by Percoll (Sigma-
Aldrich) gradient centrifugation. Up to 5 × 105 isolated hepatocytes were plated onto each well of a colla-
gen-coated 24-well plate. BMDMs were isolated from WT mice as previously described (48, 49). Briefly, 
bone marrow from dissected mouse tibia and femur was flushed with RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented 
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% L929 cell–condi-
tioned media. Cells were resuspended and plated. After 7 days of differentiation, BMDMs were used for 
subsequent experiments. Kupffer cells were isolated by in situ digestion with pronase and collagenase fol-
lowing cell separation on a discontinuous Percoll gradient and selective adherence (28).
Macrophage chemotaxis. THP-1 and BMDM chemotaxis was assessed by a migration assay using Corn-
ing FluoroBlok 24 Well Plate cell culture inserts (product 351152). Huh7 or PMHs were plated in the baso-
lateral chambers the day before, and subjected to the different treatment conditions in 1 ml of serum-free 
DMEM. After 2 hours of serum starvation, 5 × 105 BMDMs or THP-1 cells were suspended in 1 ml of 
RPMI, and then labeled with 5 μM Cell Tracker Red CMTPX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 minutes. 
Inserts were rehydrated with 500 μl of PBS for 2 hours at 37°C, in an ambient atmosphere incubator. Buffer 
was removed and 200 μl of BMDM or THP-1 suspension was dispensed into the appropriate inserts. The 
coculture system of either BMDMs and PMHs or THP-1 and Huh7 cells was incubated at 37°C. BMDMs 
or THP-1 cells were left to migrate for 4 hours. The migrated cells were imaged and quantified by plate-
based cytometer Celigo (Nexcelom Bioscience LLC), an automated, kinetic imaging system that assesses 
and quantifies macrophage migration, using the autofocus feature that allows focusing through the basolat-
eral compartment up to the migrated cell layer on the bottom of the membrane.
Immunofluorescence of  p65 NF-κB. Immunofluorescence of p65 NF-κB was performed as previously 
described by us (49). In brief, BMDMs were serum starved for 2 hours and then incubated with LPC for 30 
minutes. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, 
blocked with 5% BSA in PBS, and the primary antibody p65 (1:400) was applied overnight at 4°C. Second-
ary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) was applied for 1 hour. Cells 
were mounted with ProLong Antifade with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and images were acquired on an 
LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cells with nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB were quantified.
