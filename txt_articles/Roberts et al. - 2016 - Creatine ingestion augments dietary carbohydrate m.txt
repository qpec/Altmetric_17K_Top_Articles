supplementation (P < 0.05), which was sustained thereaf-
ter. This study confirmed dietary Cr augments post-exercise 
muscle glycogen super-compensation, and demonstrates 
this occurred during the initial 24 h of post-exercise recov-
ery (when muscle total-Cr had increased by <10 %). This 
marked response ensued without apparent treatment dif-
ferences in muscle insulin sensitivity (oral-GTT, muscle 
GLUT4 mRNA), osmotic stress (muscle c-fos and HSP72 
mRNA) or muscle cell volume (muscle water content) 
responses, such that another mechanism must be causative.

Introduction
Muscle glycogen availability has long been cited as a prin-
cipal determinant of endurance exercise performance, and 
its depletion corresponds with the development of muscle 
fatigue (Bergström and Hultman 1967; Bergström et al. 
1967). Optimising liver and muscle glycogen storage 
is a goal of many athletes wishing to maximise perfor-
mance, particularly those involved in disciplines requir-
ing prolonged sub-maximal exertion (65–75 % VO2peak) 
or repeated bursts of high intensity exercise. The accepted 
method of maximising muscle glycogen content is by ‘car-
bohydrate (CHO) loading’, which classically involves the 
depletion of muscle glycogen reserves through prolonged 
sub-maximal exercise (>90 min), followed by the con-
sumption of a high CHO diet (>70 % calories CHO) for 
several days (Bergström and Hultman 1966, 1967; Sher-
man and Costill 1984). The use of such methods has been 
shown to replenish muscle glycogen content to a habitual 
resting level within 24 h, and to super-compensate reserves 
Abstract Muscle glycogen availability can limit endur-
ance exercise performance. We previously demonstrated 
5 days of creatine (Cr) and carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion 
augmented post-exercise muscle glycogen storage com-
pared to CHO feeding alone in healthy volunteers. Here, 
we aimed to characterise the time-course of this Cr-induced 
response under more stringent and controlled experimental 
conditions and identify potential mechanisms underpin-
ning this phenomenon. Fourteen healthy, male volunteers 
cycled to exhaustion at 70 % VO2peak. Muscle biopsies were 
obtained at rest immediately post-exercise and after 1, 3 
and 6 days of recovery, during which Cr or placebo supple-
ments (20 g day−1) were ingested along with a prescribed 
high CHO diet (37.5 kcal kg body mass−1 day−1, >80 % 
calories CHO). Oral-glucose tolerance tests (oral-GTT) 
were performed pre-exercise and after 1, 3 and 6 days of 
Cr and placebo supplementation. Exercise depleted mus-
cle glycogen content to the same extent in both treatment 
groups. Creatine supplementation increased muscle total-
Cr, free-Cr and phosphocreatine (PCr) content above pla-
cebo following 1, 3 and 6 days of supplementation (all 
P < 0.05). Creatine supplementation also increased muscle 
glycogen content noticeably above placebo after 1 day of

by over 100 % within 48–72 h. As a result of this, improve-
ments in subsequent endurance exercise performance (time 
to fatigue) of about 50 % can be expected (Bergström and 
Hultman 1967). This super-compensatory response is con-
fined solely to the previously exercised (glycogen-depleted) 
muscle, and has been attributed to heightened muscle insu-
lin sensitivity and a localised increase in glycogen synthase 
activity (Bergström and Hultman 1967, 1966; Jentjens and 
Jeukendrup 2003).
We have previously demonstrated that dietary Cr sup-
plementation can augment post-exercise muscle glycogen 
storage during a conventional ‘CHO-loading’ regimen in 
healthy, young, male volunteers, and that this response is 
restricted to the previously exercised limb (Robinson et al. 
1999; Sewell et al. 2008). Furthermore, in keeping with 
the data of Harris et al. (1992), we confirmed that exercise 
can augment muscle Cr storage (Robinson et al. 1999). Of 
practical importance, this Cr-mediated augmentation of 
post-exercise muscle glycogen storage was of a magnitude 
sufficient to produce a significant improvement in endur-
ance exercise performance (~150 mmol kg−1 dry muscle; 
Robinson et al. 1999). Although Cr ingestion is well estab-
lished as a method to improve performance during, and 
recovery from (in the form of PCr re-synthesis), short-term 
maximal exercise (Greenhaff et al. 1993, 1994), the work 
of Robinson et al. (1999) highlighted for the first time the 
potential beneficial effect of Cr supplementation on the 
performance of, and maximising recovery from, prolonged 
sub-maximal exercise. The findings of Robinson et al. 
(1999) have since been supported by rodent (Op’t Eijnde 
et al. 2001a) and human (Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b; Derave 
et al. 2003; Van Loon et al. 2004) based investigation. The 
time-course of this Cr-mediated effect on glycogen storage 
remains unknown, but based on the findings of Robinson 
et al. (1999) must occur somewhere between 6 and 120 h of 
post-exercise Cr ingestion. Similarly, insight is lacking into 
the mechanisms that underpin this phenomenon.
There are a number of potential mechanisms that might 
underpin the ability of dietary Cr supplementation to aug-
ment post-exercise muscle glycogen storage. First, a Cr-
induced increase in post-exercise insulin release and/or 
increase in muscle insulin sensitivity. This hypothesis could 
be tested by performing an oral-glucose tolerance test (oral-
GTT) before exercise and at several pre-determined time 
points during recovery from exercise, during which volun-
teers ingest Cr and CHO or CHO alone, and blood glucose 
and serum insulin are determined. Furthermore, depending 
upon the time-course of the glycogen super-compensatory 
response, a Cr-induced augmentation in muscle sarcolem-
mal glucose transporter (GLUT4) might occur in tandem 
with these responses (Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b). Second, 
an increase in post-exercise glycogen storage could be 
directly linked to a Cr-induced increase in muscle water 
content. Indeed, osmotically induced swelling of rat mus-
cle fibres in vitro has demonstrated that muscle glycogen 
synthesis can be increased by changes in cell volume (Low 
et al. 1996). Taken in tandem with the decreases in urinary 
volume and increases in fat-free body mass often reported 
following Cr ingestion (Hultman et al. 1996; Dentowski 
et al. 1997), if muscle Cr accumulation (which is sodium 
dependent) does result in cell swelling in vivo in humans 
(Francaux and Poortmans 1999), then this may indeed 
underpin an increase in post-exercise glycogen storage. 
This could be tested by determining Cr-mediated altera-
tions in muscle water content in tandem with changes in the 
expression of transcription factors known to be sensitive to 
osmotic stress responses in humans, for example, c-fos and 
the inducible 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP72; Locke 
1997; Sadoshima and Izumo 1997; Beck et al. 2000). 
Finally, given exercise-induced muscle glycogen depletion 
is known to accompany increased muscle 5′AMP activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which in turn has been 
linked to the mechanistic regulation of post-exercise mus-
cle glucose disposal and storage (Wojtaszewski et al. 2003; 
Steinberg et al. 2006), it is plausible that a Cr-mediated 
alteration in exercise-induced AMPK activation could mod-
ulate post-exercise muscle glycogen storage. Whilst AMPK 
is principally activated through changes in the AMP/ATP 
ratio (Hardie 2004; Hardie and Hawley 2001), a change in 
the PCr/Cr ratio, which is known to accompany Cr feeding 
in human muscle (Harris et al. 1992; Robinson et al. 1999), 
is also known to modulate AMPK activity (Ponticos et al. 
1998). Furthermore, AMPK has been reported to be acti-
vated indirectly by changes in cell osmotic stress (Hayashi 
et al. 2000; Fryer et al. 2002).
The primary aim of the present study, therefore, was to 
extend the findings of Robinson et al. (1999) and to delin-
eate the time-course of Cr-mediated post-exercise muscle 
glycogen super-compensation in humans, but under more 
stringent and controlled experimental conditions. We also 
hoped to provide some insight into potential mechanisms 
that could underpin this Cr-mediated phenomenon.
Methods
Subjects
Fourteen recreationally active (non-highly trained) and 
non-vegetarian healthy men (age 26 ± 2 years; height 
180 ± 1 cm; body mass 78.6 ± 3.9 kg; body mass index 
24.5 ± 1.0 kg m−2; VO2peak 44.4 ± 1.5 ml kg−1 body

of Helsinki. Subjects were advised of the rationale, asso-
ciated risks and procedures of the study and were aware 
that they were free to withdraw from the study at any time. 
Before commencing the investigation, all subjects gave 
informed written consent, and routine blood and physiolog-
ical measurements were performed to assess health status 
prior to acceptance into the study.
Maximal oxygen uptake determination
Upon satisfying the screening criteria, each subject vis-
ited the laboratory on two occasions during which they 
were familiarised with the experimental procedures to be 
used throughout the study and their peak oxygen uptake 
(VO2peak) was measured and confirmed. The determination 
of VO2peak involved the use of an online gas analysis sys-
tem (SensorMedics, Anaheim, CA, USA) and a continu-
ous incremental exercise protocol on an electrically braked 
bicycle ergometer at a pedalling cadence of ~70 rpm 
(Excaliber Sport, Lode N.V. Instrumenten, Groningen, The 
Netherlands).
Experimental protocol (Fig. 1)
Subjects reported to the laboratory on the morning of 
the study after an overnight fast, having abstained from 
alcohol and strenuous exercise for a minimum of 48 h. 
Upon arrival, subjects were weighed and then rested in a 
supine position with their non-dominant hand placed in a 
hand-warming unit (in which air temperature was main-
tained at 55 °C) to arterialise the venous drainage of the 
hand (Gallen and Macdonald 1990). After 20 min, a can-
nula was inserted into an antecubital vein on the dorsal 
surface of the subject’s hand, and the hand was returned 
to the hand-warming unit. The cannula was kept patent 
using an isotonic saline drip. Subjects then underwent a 
2-h oral-glucose tolerance test (GTT), where 90 g of sim-
ple CHO was ingested in a 500 ml solution (<2 min), with 
arterialised-venous blood samples being taken immediately 
prior to CHO ingestion and 15, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 and 
120 min post-ingestion for the subsequent analysis of the 
whole blood glucose and lactate (YSI 2300 Statplus ana-
lyser, YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA), non-esterified free 
fatty acid (NEFA C kit, Wako Chemicals, Wako, Germany) 
and serum insulin (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, 
CA, USA) concentrations. Throughout the oral-GTT sub-
jects continued to rest in a supine position and their hand 
remained in the hand-warming unit to ensure venous arteri-
alisation was maintained.
Upon completion of the oral-GTT, the cannula was 
removed and subjects immediately began exercising on 
an electrically braked bicycle ergometer (Excaliber Sport, 
Lode N.V. Instrumenten, Groningen, The Netherlands) 
at 70 % VO2peak and a pedal cadence of 70 rpm. Expired 
gas composition and volume was measured throughout the 
first 15 min of exercise to confirm subjects were exercising 
at the correct workload. Perceived exertion was assessed 
every 15 min during exercise using the Borg scale (Borg 
1982). To prevent excessive dehydration during exercise, 
subjects received 2 ml of water kg−1 body mass every 
20 min throughout the exercise period. Subjects exercised 
continuously until they could no longer maintain a cycling 
cadence of 70 rpm and wished to stop. At this point, they 
were allowed to rest supine on a bed for 5 min, and then 
continued to exercise, interleaved with short rest periods, 
until the required cycling cadence could no longer be

maintained for 2 min or the subject chose not to continue 
(point of exhaustion). This glycogen-depleting protocol has 
been used previously by this research laboratory to achieve 
almost complete muscle glycogen depletion (Casey et al. 
1996).
Muscle biopsy sampling and treatment groups (Fig. 1)
At the point of exhaustion, subjects stepped away from 
the exercise apparatus and rested supine on a bed, whilst 
a muscle biopsy was immediately obtained from the vas-
tus lateralis of the non-dominant leg using the Bergström 
needle biopsy technique (Bergström 1975). Upon removal 
from the limb, the muscle biopsy sample was snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen and stored under liquid nitrogen for anal-
ysis at a later date. Subjects were then randomly assigned 
to either a Cr monohydrate (20 g day−1) or placebo (gly-
cine 20 g day−1) treatment group for the remainder of the 
day and subsequent 5 days. A further muscle biopsy, fol-
lowed immediately by an oral-GTT, was performed after 1, 
3 and 6 days of Cr and placebo ingestion. To avoid poten-
tial confounding metabolic effects arising from multiple 
biopsy sampling over the course of the study, biopsy sites 
were separated by at least 2.5 cm (Murton et al. 2014).
The Cr treatment group (n = 7) ingested 5 g of Cr (Cr 
monohydrate; AlzChem, Trostberg, Germany) on four 
equally spaced occasions each day over a 6 day period, 
whilst the placebo group (n = 7) received 5 g of glycine 
(Ajinomoto Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at the same time points. 
Each 5 g supplement (dissolved in 250 ml of a warm, 
sugar-free, diluted orange drink) was consumed, and 
immediately followed by the ingestion of 500 ml of a 
commercially available CHO-rich drink (Lucozade Origi-
nal ≈18.5 % w/v glucose and simple sugars, Smith-Kline 
Beecham, Coleford, UK). This supplementation protocol 
ensures each Cr supplement is fully dissolved, and the peak 
in plasma Cr concentration coincides with peak elevations 
in blood glucose and serum insulin concentration (Green 
et al. 1996a, b). The CHO dose was chosen because it is 
known to stimulate muscle Cr and glycogen accumulation 
in young, healthy volunteers (Green et al. 1996a, b; Robin-
son et al. 2000). Supplement ingestion commenced imme-
diately after the post-exercise muscle sample (1st biopsy). 
Before leaving the laboratory, subjects consumed a second 
treatment (supplement), as detailed previously, and a fur-
ther two supplements were ingested at intervals over the 
remainder of that day. Typically, the supplements were 
ingested at ~12, 2, 6 and 10 pm daily. Subjects repeated 
the ingestion of the supplements four times each day for 
a further 5 days. In addition to the supplements, subjects 
consumed a commercially prepared CHO-rich diet (‘Be 
Good To Yourself™’ food range, Sainsburys, UK), which 
when added to the 2 l of Lucozade consumed each day, 
equated to greater than 80 % of the calorific intake being 
in the form of CHO throughout the 6 day treatment period 
(~8 g CHO kg−1 day−1). As subjects received 1350 kcal per 
day from the Lucozade drinks alone, to ensure that protein 
intake was not reduced from recommended levels, subjects 
received 20 % more calories per day than required based 
on their body mass (37.5 kcal kg−1 body mass day−1). This 
regimen of Cr ingestion has been widely used and has been 
proven to have no adverse side effects (Robinson et al. 
2000), to increase plasma Cr concentration to a peak of 
~700 µmol l−1 when co-ingested with CHO (Green et al. 
1996a) and to markedly increase muscle total-Cr content.
Twenty-four h urine collections were made over the first 
day of supplementation (5 l containers, containing 5 ml of 
0.6 mol l−1 thymol solution). Urine volume was recorded 
and following mixing; an aliquot was removed and stored 
at −80 °C for future HPLC analysis of urinary Cr and cre-
atinine content (Dunnett et al. 1991).
Muscle sample treatment and analysis
All biopsy samples were divided into two equal por-
tions under liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, one portion 
was freeze-dried, dissected free from visible blood and 
connective tissue and powdered. Total muscle water con-
tent of samples was determined by weighing the samples 
before and after freeze-drying. Freeze-dried samples were 
then extracted in 0.5 M perchloric acid containing 1 mmol 
EDTA, with the resulting supernatant neutralised with 
2.2 M KHCO3 and used for the spectrophotometric deter-
mination of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), ATP, PCr and Cr 
(Harris et al. 1974). Freeze-dried muscle powder was also 
used for the determination of muscle glycogen (Harris et al. 
1974).
Total-RNA was extracted from the remaining portion of 
frozen (wet) muscle using the method of Chomczynski and 
Sacchi (1987) and quantified using a kit (Molecular Probes 
RNA quantification reagent and kit, Cambridge BioSci-
ence, Cambridge, UK). Following this, 3 µl of total-RNA 
was diluted in 0.05 µg µl−1 RNA solution for the subse-
quent analysis of gene expression.
Following this, 0.5 µg of RNA was added to an Eppen-
dorf tube containing random-hexamers (Promega, South-
ampton, UK) and RNase-free water, mixed and incubated 
within a thermal cycler (Mastercycler® Gradient, Eppen-
dorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 5 min at 70 °C and then 
placed on ice. Reverse transcriptase buffer, dATP, dCTP, 
dGTP, dTTP and dUTP mix, ribonuclease inhibitor, MMLV 
reverse transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK) and 
RNase-free water were then added to each sample. Samples 
were then mixed and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Following 
incubation, α-actin, GLUT4, c-fos and HSP72 mRNA was 
quantified by real-time PCR using an ABI PRISM 7700

Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). 
Probes and primers were designed using Primer Express™ 
software Version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, 
UK; Table 1), and all samples were run in triplicate. Results 
were expressed as ratios towards α-actin, which was con-
sidered an endogenous mRNA control allowing variation 
due to RNA extraction as well as RT (cycle times) efficien-
cies to be taken into account. Final normalising involved 
attributing a value of 100 % to the average of the triplicate 
of determinations for the pre-supplementation (post-exer-
cise) time point.
Calculations and statistics
All data are reported as means ± SEM. Comparisons 
between treatments, for both absolute concentrations and 
changes from basal, were carried out using the two-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. 
When a significant F value was obtained (P < 0.05), an 
LSD post hoc test was used to locate any differences (SPSS 
Base 8.0). Significance was accepted at the 5 % level, 
unless otherwise stated in the text.
With the exception of lactate, the content of all muscle 
metabolites was adjusted to the mean ATP concentration 
within each individual (based upon four biopsy samples). 
By this means, it was possible to compensate for any admix-
ture of connective tissue and other non-muscular elements 
within each muscle biopsy sample (Harris et al. 1992).
Glucose, lactate, insulin and non-esterified fatty acid 
data (NEFA), shown as area under the curve, were calcu-
lated from the individual glucose, lactate, serum insulin 
and NEFA blood concentrations of each subject at ~15 min 
intervals (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min) during the 
120 min of the oral-GTT on the treatment days indicated 
(Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, USA).
Results
Subjects reported compliance with all exercise, sup-
plementation and dietary aspects of the study and did 
not report any ill effects. Maximal oxygen uptake, daily 
energy intake and dietary composition were identical 
between treatment groups (Table 2). Urinary Cr excre-
tion was negligible during the first 24 h of placebo supple-
mentation. However, Cr excretion increased dramatically 
during day 1 of Cr supplementation and was signifi-
cantly greater than that observed in the placebo group (Cr 
0–24 h = 7.6 ± 1.5 g vs. placebo 0–24 h = 0.0 ± 0.4 g; 
P < 0.01), pointing to ~60 % of the 20 g Cr ingested being 
retained by the body during the first 24 h of supplementa-
tion. No differences in urinary creatinine excretion existed 
between groups during the first day of Cr or placebo 
supplementation (Cr 0–24 h = 1.2 ± 0.3 g vs. placebo 
0–24 h = 0.9 ± 0.3).
No difference in muscle water content from pre-sup-
plementation (post-exhaustive exercise) existed within or 
between treatment groups throughout 6 days of placebo or 
Cr supplementation (Table 3).
Muscle metabolites
No change in muscle ATP or G-6-P content was observed 
from the pre-supplementation (post-exercise) time point 
during 6 days of Cr and placebo supplementation (Table 3). 
Similarly, no differences in muscle ATP and G-6-P content 
existed between treatment groups over the time-course of 
the study (Table 3).

No significant change in muscle PCr, free-Cr or total-Cr 
content over time from the pre-supplementation time point 
was observed with placebo supplementation (Table 3). 
There was a 17 % significant increase in muscle PCr con-
tent from the pre-supplementation value following 3 days 
of Cr supplementation (P < 0.05), which increased further 
following 6 days of Cr ingestion (P < 0.01, Table 3). Cre-
atine ingestion increased muscle PCr content above placebo 
following 6 days of supplementation (P < 0.01, Table 3). 
Similarly, Cr ingestion increased muscle free-Cr content 
following 3 days of supplementation (P < 0.01, Table 3), 
which was 39 % (P < 0.01) greater than the pre-supplemen-
tation value after 6 days of Cr ingestion (Table 3). Creatine 
ingestion increased muscle free-Cr content above placebo 
after 3 days of supplementation (P < 0.01), which con-
tinued to increase to 35 % greater than placebo following 
6 days of Cr ingestion (P < 0.01, Table 3).
In accordance with these changes, muscle total-Cr con-
tent was greater than the pre-supplementation value follow-
ing 1 (9 %, P < 0.05), 3 (14 %, P < 0.01) and 6 (24 %, 
P < 0.01) days of ingestion (Fig. 2). Creatine ingestion 
increased muscle total-Cr content above placebo after 1 
(8 %, P < 0.05), 3 (11 %, P < 0.01) and 6 (22 %, P < 0.01) 
days of Cr ingestion (Fig. 2).
No alteration in the PCr:Cr ratio occurred throughout the 
study in the placebo group. However, the PCr:Cr ratio was 
lower than the pre-supplementation value (2.00 ± 0.13) 
after 3 days Cr supplementation (1.81 ± 0.06, P < 0.05). 
This value was also lower than that recorded in the placebo 
group after 3 days supplementation (2.05 ± 0.03, P < 0.05).
The exercise intervention markedly reduced skeletal 
muscle glycogen content from the habitual resting value of 
~400–450 mmol kg−1 dry muscle, and there was no differ-
ence in the post-exercise value between treatment groups 
immediately prior to Cr and placebo ingestion (Fig. 3). 
Muscle glycogen content increased dramatically in both 
treatment groups during 6 days of supplementation, and 
as expected muscle glycogen content was greater than the 
post-exercise value in both treatment group following 1, 3 
and 6 days (Fig. 3). However, Cr supplementation increased 
muscle glycogen content significantly above placebo after 
1 (P < 0.01) and 6 (P < 0.01) days (Fig. 3), with the aug-
mentation of glycogen storage being almost exclusively 
confined to the initial 24 h of Cr supplementation, and the 
difference between treatments being maintained thereaf-
ter (P < 0.01, Fig. 3). Indeed, the magnitude of glycogen

re-synthesis during the first 24 h of supplementation was 
~82 % greater in the Cr group compared to placebo (Cr 
410 ± 50 vs. placebo 225 ± 50 mmol kg−1 dry muscle, 
P < 0.01), with no difference in the rate of glycogen syn-
thesis existing between groups between 1 and 6 days of 
supplementation (Fig. 3).
Blood metabolites and oral‑glucose tolerance tests
The area under the blood glucose-time curve during the 
oral-GTT (defined in Methods) was unchanged from the 
pre-supplementation value throughout 6 days of placebo 
ingestion (Fig. 4a). Creatine supplementation transiently 
elevated the area under the glucose curve from basal after 
1 day of ingestion (P < 0.05, Fig. 4a), but no differences in 
the area under the curve existed between treatment groups 
at any time point throughout the study (Fig. 4a).
Neither placebo nor Cr ingestion had an effect on the 
area under the serum insulin-time curve during the oral-
GTT throughout the study (Fig. 4b). Similarly, no differ-
ence between treatment groups was observed at any time 
point during 6 days of ingestion (Fig. 4b). There was a 
weak trend for Cr supplementation to increase the serum 
insulin concentration above placebo after 1 day of sup-
plementation (Placebo day 1 = 4310 ± 642 vs. Cr day 
1 = 5995 ± 733 mU/l/min, P = 0.11, Fig. 4b).

The area under the blood lactate-time curve during 
the oral-GTT was unchanged from pre-supplementation 
throughout 6 days of placebo ingestion (Fig. 4c). Creatine 
supplementation increased the area under the blood lactate-
time curve from pre-supplementation after 1 (P < 0.05), 3 
(P < 0.05) and 6 (P < 0.05) days of ingestion (Fig. 4c). The 
area under the blood lactate-time curve was also elevated 
above placebo after 3 (P < 0.05) and 6 (P < 0.05) days of 
Cr ingestion (Fig. 4c).
Placebo and Cr supplementation both caused a signifi-
cant reduction in area under blood non-esterified free fatty 
acid-time curve during the oral-GTT (data not shown). 
However, no difference existed between treatment groups 
at any point over the course of the study.
mRNA expression
No differences in GLUT4 mRNA expression existed 
between placebo and Cr treatment groups throughout 
6 days of supplementation (Table 4). However, GLUT4 
mRNA expression increased ~twofold from the post-exer-
cise time point following 1 and 6 days of placebo supple-
mentation (P < 0.05; Table 4). No alteration in GLUT4 
expression was observed from the post-exercise time point 
throughout 6 days of Cr supplementation (Table 4).
c-fos mRNA expression was markedly reduced from the 
post-exercise (pre-supplementation) time point through-
out 6 days of supplementation in both treatment groups 
(P < 0.01; Table 4) However, no differences in expression 
were evident between treatment groups throughout the 
study (Table 4).
No differences in HSP72 mRNA expression existed 
between treatment groups throughout 6 days of supplemen-
tation (Table 4). However, HSP72 expression was reduced 
from the post-exercise time point following 3 days of sup-
plementation in both treatment groups (P < 0.05; Table 4). 
The reduced expression of HSP72 was transient in the pla-
cebo group, but was sustained after 6 days of Cr supple-
mentation (P < 0.05; Table 4).
Discussion
The primary aim of the present study was to delineate the 
time-course of dietary Cr-mediated post-exercise muscle 
glycogen super-compensation in humans under conditions, 
where energy intake and food consumption were strin-
gently controlled. The principal finding was that dietary Cr 
supplementation markedly augmented post-exercise mus-
cle glycogen storage above placebo during a conventional 
‘carbohydrate-loading’ regime, and that this augmentation 
of glycogen storage occurred almost exclusively within the 
first 24 h of supplementation (the magnitude of glycogen 
re-synthesis during the first 24 h of supplementation was 
~82 % greater in the Cr group compared to placebo). The 
results also point to this Cr-induced glycogen super-com-
pensation being independent of the time-course of muscle 
Cr accumulation and changes in serum insulin availability, 
insulin sensitivity and/or cellular osmotic stress responses, 
such that another mechanism(s) must be causative.
Muscle creatine and glycogen storage
Several studies have evaluated muscle glycogen storage in 
humans in response to acute (20 g day−1 for 5 days; Rob-
inson et al. 1999; Newman et al. 2003; van Loon et al. 
2004) and more prolonged Cr ingestion (2.5–20 g day−1 for 
8–12 weeks; Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b; Derave et al. 2003). 
The findings of these studies largely support a role for die-
tary Cr in enhancing muscle glycogen storage (+12–23 %) 
when ingested following exhaustive exercise (Robinson 
et al. 1999), or during 6–8 weeks of resistance training 
(+30–35 %; Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b; Derave et al. 2003). 
The evidence that dietary Cr ingestion can augment muscle 
glycogen storage in the non-exercised state is less compel-
ling, with a positive effect (+18 %) being reported by van 
Loon et al. (2004) following 5 days of Cr supplementation, 
but no effect at all being reported by others (Newman et al. 
2003; Sewell et al. 2008), even within the same volunteer 
when one limb has been exercised and the contra-lateral 
limb has remained inactive (Robinson et al. 1999). As far 
as we are aware, the present study is the first to establish 
the post-exercise glycogen super-compensatory properties 
of dietary Cr supplementation under rigorously controlled 
dietary conditions in humans (Table 2) and to document the 
time-course of this effect. It is clear from the data (Fig. 3) 
that the Cr-induced augmentation of muscle glycogen stor-
age occurs not as a gradual bifurcation from the typical 
glycogen-loading response observed in the placebo group,

but rather as a transient marked increase (approximately 
twofold) in glycogen re-synthesis during the initial 24 h of 
Cr ingestion during recovery from exercise (Fig. 3).
It has been suggested that the expansion of the muscle 
total-Cr pool is a prerequisite for Cr-induced augmentation 
of muscle glycogen storage (Van Loon et al. 2004; Volek 
and Rawson 2004). Indeed, work by Van Loon et al. (2004) 
showed a significant correlation between the magnitude of 
increase in muscle total-Cr (+31 %) and glycogen stor-
age (+18 %) following 5 days of Cr supplementation. This 
observation was strengthened by the findings from another 
study of this research group, where the absence of a treat-
ment effect upon glycogen storage was attributed to inad-
equate muscle Cr accumulation (+12 %; Newman et al. 
2003). However, in neither of these studies were muscle 
biopsies obtained over the time-course of Cr supplementa-
tion. Indeed, as the Cr-mediated augmentation of glycogen 
storage in the present study occurred almost exclusively 
within the first 24 h of Cr ingestion, when muscle total-
Cr stores had increased by only 8 % (Fig. 2), the findings 
clearly do not support the contention that the extent of 
muscle total-Cr accumulation is an important determinant 
of the muscle glycogen storage response. Furthermore, fol-
lowing 24 h, no greater muscle glycogen storage above that 
recorded in the placebo group was observed from days 1 to 
6 of Cr ingestion, despite muscle total-Cr increasing by a 
further 15 % in the Cr supplementation group (Figs. 2, 3).
It could be speculated that a transient change in the 
PCr/Cr ratio in response to 24 h of Cr feeding may have 
blunted the exercise-induced activation of AMPK (Winder 
and Hardie 1999; Rasmussen and Winder 1997; Fujii et al. 
2000), which in turn, and independent of any alteration in 
muscle insulin sensitivity, could have augmented muscle 
glycogen synthesis during the initial 24 h of post-exercise 
recovery by dampening the inhibitory effect of AMPK 
on glycogen synthase activity (Aschenbach et al. 2002; 
Wojtaszewski et al. 2002; Jorgensen et al. 2004). Indeed, 
an alteration in the composition of the muscle Cr pool, as 
occurs, for example, during exercise and Cr feeding, has 
been reported to directly impact upon the activation status 
of AMPK (Ponticos et al. 1998). The in vitro findings of 
Ponticos et al. (1998) showed that physiological increases 
in muscle PCr content directly inhibited AMPK activation 
in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this inhibition 
was attenuated (indirectly) by an increase in muscle free-Cr 
content; pointing to the PCr/Cr ratio, along with the ATP/
ADP ratio, being a regulator of skeletal muscle AMPK 
activation status (for review, see Hardie and Hawley 2001). 
A reduction in the muscle PCr/Cr ratio has been reported 
following acute-Cr ingestion (Harris et al. 1992; Robinson 
et al. 1999), which has prompted researchers to examine 
the effect of Cr availability on AMPK activation in vitro 
(Ceddoa and Sweeny 2004) and in vivo (Ju et al. 2005; 
Op’t Eijnde et al. 2005). The findings from these studies 
are equivocal, with AMPK being activated by unphysi-
ological concentrations of PCr and Cr (Ceddoa and Sweeny 
2004), and independent of any alteration in the muscle PCr/
Cr ratio (Ju et al. 2005), in some, but not all, studies (Op’t 
Eijnde et al. 2005). In the present in vivo study, Cr inges-
tion reduced the muscle PCr/Cr ratio from basal follow-
ing 3 days of supplementation, but this response occurred 
after the Cr-mediated increase in muscle glycogen storage 
(0–24 h, Fig. 3), making it unlikely that this underpinned 
the augmentation of glycogen storage observed between 0 
and 24 h. Furthermore, contrary to the report of Ponticos 
et al. (1998), more recent in vitro research has surmised 
that although the concept of a PCr/Cr ratio mediated regu-
lation of AMP kinase may be intuitive and attractive, evi-
dence to substantiate this concept is not prevalent (Taylor 
et al. 2006; Suter et al. 2006).
Muscle creatine and insulin sensitivity
It is logical to assume that the rapid augmentation of post-
exercise glycogen storage that accompanied Cr ingestion 
(Fig. 3) would have been preceded by an increase in mus-
cle glucose uptake, which we hoped to demonstrate by per-
forming oral-GTTs and determining muscle GLUT4 mRNA 
expression (Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b) over the course of 
6 days of exercise recovery. However, given that the Cr-
induced augmentation of muscle glycogen storage occurred 
almost exclusively within the first 24 h of treatment and, 
therefore, preceded the first post-exercise oral-GTT (1 day), 
any effect of Cr ingestion on glucose clearance must have 
occurred within the initial 24 h of recovery. Indeed, based 
upon our previous observation (Robinson et al. 1999), 
which found no effect of Cr ingestion on muscle glycogen 
storage during the initial 6 h of recovery from exercise, and 
the present study that showed a dramatic effect after 24 h 
of recovery (Fig. 3), this Cr augmentation of glycogen stor-
age must have occurred between 6 to 24 h of post-exercise 
recovery. The increase in area under the blood glucose curve 
during the oral-GTT after 1 day of Cr ingestion (Fig. 4a), 
and along with the trend for the serum insulin response to 
do the same (Fig. 4b), most probably reflects a blunting in 
muscle glucose uptake caused by the marked increase in 
muscle glycogen storage over the preceding 24 h. This view 
is supported by the increase in blood lactate concentration 
that accompanied Cr ingestion (Fig. 4c).
It has been suggested that Cr supplementation can 
up-regulate muscle GLUT4 protein expression, thereby 
increasing muscle glucose uptake and underpinning the 
glycogen super-compensatory properties of Cr supplemen-
tation (Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b). However, this view is not 
supported by the findings others (Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001a; 
van Loon et al. 2004), where, for example, no increase in 
 1840
P. A. Roberts et al.
1 3
muscle GLUT4 mRNA or protein expression was observed 
in response to acute or prolonged Cr ingestion in healthy 
human volunteers (van Loon et al. 2004). The finding of 
the present study that Cr ingestion had no influence on 
muscle GLUT4 mRNA expression (Table 4) is in concord-
ance with this stance. However, it is acknowledged that the 
quantification of muscle GLUT4 protein and/or compo-
nents of the signalling cascade regulating GLUT4 translo-
cation (e.g., AS160 activation) would have provided more 
robust insight.
Muscle cell volume and osmotic stress responses
Another mechanism that has been suggested to underpin the 
stimulatory effect of Cr ingestion on acute glycogen super-
compensation is an increase in intra-myocellular water con-
tent, secondary to an increase in muscle Cr accumulation 
(Robinson et al. 1999; Op’t Eijnde et al. 2001b; van Loon 
et al. 2004). Indeed, muscle Cr transport is dependent upon 
extracellular Na+, and is, therefore, osmotically active (Daly 
and Seifter 1980), with an increase in fat-free body mass 
and a decrease in urinary volume being reported in response 
to acute-Cr feeding; indicative of an increase whole-body 
water retention (Hultman et al. 1996). It has been demon-
strated in vitro that changes in cell volume in rodent mus-
cle can modulate changes in muscle glycogen content, 
independent of any alteration in cell glucose uptake (Low 
et al. 1996). However, although muscle total-Cr (Fig. 2) and 
glycogen (Fig. 3) both increased during the initial 24 h of 
dietary Cr ingestion in the present study, the time-course of 
change for each metabolite over the 6 days of supplemen-
tation was very different, with the glycogen super-com-
pensatory response being almost exclusively restricted to 
the initial 24 h of supplementation, whilst muscle total-Cr 
content increased in a more gradual manner over the study. 
It is unlikely, therefore, that a Cr-mediated increase in cel-
lular hydration status stimulated this marked initial increase 
in muscle glycogen storage, such that another mechanism 
seems likely. This conclusion is supported by the lack of 
any treatment effect on muscle water content during 6 days 
of supplementation (Table 3) and by the absence of any dif-
ferences in mRNA expression of the osmotically induced 
transcription factors c-fos and HSP72 between Cr and pla-
cebo groups (Table 4). Changes in the expression of HSP72 
(Febraio et al. 2002) and c-fos (Puntschart et al. 1998) 
mRNA have been shown to correlate well with changes in 
their respective protein products, indicating they are at least 
partly under transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, it has 
been suggested that muscle HSP72 expression is sensitive 
to alterations in myofibril glycogen content in man, with 
HSP72 mRNA increasing in response to glycogen-depleting 
exercise before gradually being reduced as glycogen stores 
are replenished (Febbraio and Koukoulas 2000; Febraio 
et al. 2002). Although the present study lacked a pre-exer-
cise muscle biopsy, in support of the findings of Febraio 
et al. (2002), post-exercise HSP72 expression was halved 
following 3 days of recovery in the Cr and placebo groups, 
as muscle glycogen was super-compensated (Table 4). How-
ever, it is clear that HSP72 mRNA expression was insensi-
tive to the marked differences in muscle glycogen content 
that existed between treatment groups following 1 day of 
supplementation (Fig. 3; Table 4).
In conclusion, we have confirmed the ability of die-
tary Cr supplementation to augment post-exercise muscle 
glycogen storage during a conventional and rigorously 
controlled ‘carbohydrate-loading’ regimen in humans. 
Furthermore, this Cr-induced augmentation of muscle 
glycogen storage occurred almost exclusively within 
the first 24 h of exercise recovery and Cr ingestion, and 
appeared to be unrelated to changes in the magnitude 
of increase in muscle total-Cr, PCr or Cr content, mus-
cle insulin sensitivity, or osmotic stress and muscle cell 
volume responses, such that another mechanism must be 
causative.
