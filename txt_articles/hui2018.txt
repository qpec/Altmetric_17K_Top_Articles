Summary
Background The long-term consequences of discontinuing antipsychotic medication after successful treatment of 
first-episode psychosis are not well studied. We assess the relation between early maintenance therapy decisions 
in first-episode psychosis and the subsequent clinical outcome at 10 years.
Methods This is a 10 year follow-up study, spanning Sept 5, 2003, to Dec 30, 2014, of a randomised, double-blind trial 
in seven centres in Hong Kong in which 178 patients with first-episode psychosis with full positive symptom 
resolution after at least 1 year of antipsychotic treatment were given maintenance treatment (n=89; oral quetiapine 
400 mg daily) or early treatment discontinuation (n=89; placebo) for 12 months. After the trial, patients received 
naturalistic treatment. Overall this cohort of patients will have received about 3 years of treatment before entering the 
follow-up phase of the study: about 2 years of maintenance treatment before study entry and 1 year of treatment in the 
trial. The primary outcome of this follow-up was the proportion of patients in each group (including those for whom 
direct follow-up was not available) with good or poor long-term clinical outcomes at 10 years, with poor outcome 
defined as a composite of persistent psychotic symptoms, a requirement for clozapine treatment, or death by suicide. 
The randomised trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00334035, and the follow-up study was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01926340.
Findings Poor 10 year clinical outcome occurred in 35 (39%) of 89 patients in the discontinuation group and 19 (21%) of 
89 patients in the maintenance treatment group (risk ratio 1·84, 95% CI 1·15–2·96; p=0·012). Suicide was the only 
serious adverse event that occurred in the follow-up phase (four [4%] patients in the early discontinuation group vs 
two [2%] in the maintenance group).
Interpretation In patients with first-episode psychosis with a full initial response to treatment, medication continuation 
for at least the first 3 years after starting treatment decreases the risk of relapse and poor long-term clinical outcome.

Introduction
National clinical practice guidelines broadly agree that 
antipsychotic medication is indicated for the acute 
treatment and initial maintenance of first-episode 
psychosis. However, subsequent decisions to continue 
medication, reduce dose, or discontinue medication are 
not well informed by available randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs). On the one hand, naturalistic studies raise 
concerns about the long-term side-effects of maintenance 
medication.1,2 On the other hand, a small number of 
RCTs suggest that dose reduction or medication 
discontinuation results in an increase in relapse.3 
However, the relation between relapse and long-term 
outcome is not well studied. Some evidence suggests the 
immediate consequences of relapse are limited,4 whereas 
others raise the concern that each relapse might be 
associated with a poorer treatment response.5–7 Poor 
clinical response is a cardinal feature of treatment-
resistant psychosis8 and is the key indication for 
clozapine, the only medication with convincing efficacy 
in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,9 but which is 
associated with substantial side-effects.
One report combines findings from an RCT of dose 
reduction in the early phase of illness with a follow-up 
study of long-term clinical outcome.10,11 In the follow-up, 
patients were reassessed 7 years after the start of the 
original trial. A greater proportion of patients randomly 
assigned to the early dose-reduction group had good 
functional outcome (24 [46%] of 52 patients) than patients 
randomly assigned to the treatment as usual group 
(ten [20%] of 51 patients). However, sustained medication 
discontinuation was achieved in only 14 (22%) of 
65 patients in the dose-reduction group, whereas 
21 (32%) of 65 patients relapsed and the remainder were 
unable to discontinue medications, complicating the 
interpretation of the long-term outcomes.10,11 The 
implications of early relapse were not investigated. The 
absence of adverse consequences, or perhaps even

advantages of early dose-reduction, have important 
implications for patient care.
Many patients with first-episode psychosis have an 
encouraging initial treatment response.12 A full 
resolution of positive symptoms of psychosis presents a 
compelling case for medication discontinuation after an 
initial maintenance period of at least 1 year, as 
recommended by many clinical practice guidelines. We 
previously reported the short-term relapse outcomes of 
a 1 year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial13 
of 
early 
discontinuation 
compared 
with 
maintenance treatment with quetiapine 400 mg daily in 
such a group of patients. Patients were required to be 
free of positive symptoms of psychosis and have already 
had at least 1 year of antipsychotic treatment before 
randomisation. The Kaplan–Meier estimate of the 
proportion relapsed was 79% (95% CI 68–90) in the early 
discontinuation group, and 41% (29–53) in the main-
tenance treatment group (p<0·0001).13 After the study, 
patients received naturalistic treatment. We now report a 
10 year follow-up study of these patients to determine 
the effect of early medication discontinuation on long-
term clinical outcomes. Maintenance treatment during 
the RCT was hypothesised to be less likely to be 
associated with poor long-term outcome. We also 
investigate the contribution of early relapse to the long-
term outcome.
Methods
Study design and participants
This 10 year follow-up study, spanning Sept 5, 2003, to 
Dec 30, 2014, of an RCT13 investigating the effects of early 
discontinuation of antipsychotic medication on risk for 
relapse of positive symptoms of psychosis, was designed to 
examine the long-term consequences of early medication 
discontinuation for clinical outcome. The original RCT 
was a multisite study involving seven psychiatric hospitals 
in Hong Kong and was conducted under the Early 
Assessment Service for Young People with Psychosis. In 
the original RCT,13 a higher proportion of patients in the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Comprehensive programmes for identifying and treating 
first-episode psychosis have been implemented in many 
countries to improve the health of young people and prevent 
long-term disability associated with chronic illness. 
Antipsychotic medication is an integral part of the treatment of 
first-episode psychosis, and full remission of symptoms can be 
obtained. However, the decision of whether or not to 
discontinue antipsychotic medication after a sustained period 
of remission is a common clinical problem. In 2012, 
a systematic review of clinical guidelines available at that time 
concluded that medication should continue for at least 
12–24 months after remission from first-episode schizophrenia. 
For clinical guidelines published between Jan 1, 2012, and 
Dec 31, 2017, we searched the PubMed database using the 
search terms “schizophrenia” and “guideline”, and conducted a 
manual search of the reference list of relevant guidelines found. 
Inclusion criteria were that the guidelines had to be developed 
using a systematic and defined process, contain 
recommendations about pharmacological treatment for 
first-episode schizophrenia, and be written in English. 
Nine relevant guidelines were found, of which five contained a 
recommendation on the duration of medication maintenance. 
In accordance with guidelines published before 2012, these 
five guidelines also gave a recommendation of 12–24 months. 
However, because of the scarcity of data concerning the 
long-term consequences of early medication maintenance or 
discontinuation, all such guidelines are ambivalent in their 
recommendations for longer periods beyond 24 months.
The only 2 year, open-label, randomised trial of discontinuation 
versus maintenance treatment in first-episode psychosis 
reported outcomes at 7 years. The dose reduction group had 
better psychosocial function than the maintenance treatment 
group; no difference was found in terms of severity of psychotic 
symptoms. However, in the 2 year initial phase of that trial, 
sustained medication discontinuation was achieved in only 
20% of participants, whereas approximately 30% relapsed and 
the remainder were unable to discontinue medications, 
complicating the interpretation of the long-term outcomes.
Added value of this study
This study is the first double-blind, randomised trial to address 
the long-term consequences of the clinical decision to 
discontinue antipsychotic medication treatment over a nearly 
10-year follow-up period. Early discontinuation of medication 
(year 2) for patients with full remission of key positive 
symptoms of psychosis was associated with a higher risk of 
long-term, poor clinical outcome of schizophrenia and related 
psychotic illness than maintenance treatment. Mediation 
analysis suggested that the consequences of early 
discontinuation for long-term poor clinical outcome were 
mediated in part through early relapse during the 12 month 
period of the randomised trial.
Implications of all available evidence
Discontinuation of medication within the 3 years after starting 
treatment in patients with first-episode psychosis (ie, from when 
patients started maintenance treatment before study entry 
[22 months on average] to their completion of the 12 month trial 
period) should be carefully considered with awareness of the 
potential costs in terms of outcome. Patients who opt for 
discontinuation should be monitored with adequate support. 
In patients with first-episode psychosis with a full initial response 
to treatment, medication continuation for at least the first 3 years 
after starting treatment is effective in preventing relapse and 
decreasing the risk for a poor long-term clinical outcome.

placebo group had relapse at 12 months than in the 
maintenance group.13 The study protocol is available in the 
appendix.
The inclusion criteria for the RCT were a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia or non-affective psychosis (schizophreniform 
disorder, schizoaffective disorder, brief psychotic disorder, 
or psychosis not otherwise specified) by use of criteria from 
DSM-IV.14 Diagnostic assessments used the Chinese 
version of the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV. 
Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years, had received 
antipsychotic medication continuously for at least 
12 months, were free of positive symptoms of psychosis, 
and had no history of relapse (no increase of positive 
symptoms of psychosis requiring admission to hospital or 
adjustment of medication).
Exclusion criteria were treatment with clozapine, depot 
antipsychotic medication, or mood stabilising therapy 
(lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine); poor adherence 
to treatment (missing >50% of drug, >50% missed clinic 
visits, or a history of medication discontinuation); or a 
risk of suicide or violence. All patients from the original 
study were traced and invited to participate in the present 
study. Participants provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
In the original RCT, patients were randomly assigned 
to early discontinuation (placebo) or maintenance 
treatment. Details of the randomisation and masking can 
be found in the original study.13
The longitudinal review used case-note and centralised 
records of longitudinal, monthly data extracted by 
research assistants masked to the randomised trial 
assignment. The first research assistant checked for 
relevant information in the case-notes and redacted 
these, before passing to the second research assistant for 
rating.
Procedures
In the original RCT, patients with no residual psychotic 
symptoms who already had received at least 12 months of 
antipsychotic treatments were randomly assigned to early 
discontinuation (placebo) or maintenance treatment (oral 
quetiapine 400 mg daily; mean daily dose 411·9 mg 
[SD 63·5]) for 12 months. Before starting the RCT, patients 
had been administered antipsychotic medication for a 
mean of 21·9 months (SD 8·2; table 1). Participation in 
the RCT ended after 1 year or if the patient relapsed or 
withdrew for other reasons, whichever came first. Overall 
this cohort of patients with first-episode psychosis will 
have received about 3 years of treatment in total before 
entering the follow-up phase of the study: about 2 years of 
maintenance treatment before study entry and 1 year of 
treatment in the trial. After the trial, patients received 
naturalistic treatment. Specialised teams in Hong Kong 
provided the first 3 years of care for patients after their 
first episode of psychosis; subsequent care was provided 
by general services. We attempted to trace the 178 patients 
randomly assigned to a group in the original RCT, giving 
them a 10 year follow-up through face-to-face interview 
and obtaining chart reviews. Direct personal assessments 
were done at the follow-up interview by a Master’s level 
research assistant to obtain the primary outcome 
component of persistent positive symptoms of psychosis. 
We also did longitudinal chart reviews for all patients to 
identify death by suicide or clozapine treatment as primary 
outcome components. For any remaining patients for 
whom death by suicide or clozapine treatment were not 
identified as primary outcome components and for whom 
face-to-face interviews were not possible for obtaining 
data on persistent positive symptoms, we used positive 
symptom assessment information from the RCT to 
predict outcomes.
Medication adherence was assessed with clinical 
interviews and pill counting during the RCT. Adherence 
was assessed with a standardised scale during the 
follow-up.15
We adapted the existing dose recommendation tables 
to convert the antipsychotic medications to chlorpro- 
mazine equivalents.16–18
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this follow-up study was the 
proportion of patients in each group with good or poor 
long-term clinical outcomes at the 10 year follow-up. A poor 
long-term clinical outcome was defined by persistent 
positive symptoms of psychosis, requirement for clozapine 
treatment (treatment-resistant schizophrenia), or death by 
suicide. Positive symptoms of psychosis in the previous 
1 month of follow-up were assessed by face-to-face interview 
using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.19 The 
same thresholds were used as in the RCT to define presence 
of 
positive 
symptoms 
(delusions 
≥3, 
conceptual 
disorganisation ≥4, hallucinations ≥3, suspiciousness ≥5, 
or unusual thought content ≥4; appendix).13 The last 
positive symptom assessment (using the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale) from the randomised phase was 
used in our analyses for patients who could not be followed 
up. The other two indicators of poor long-term outcome, 
initiation of clozapine for treatment resistance at any time, 
and death by suicide at any time, were assessed through the 
medical record review. Absence of all three of these was 
deemed to indicate a good long-term clinical outcome.
After the initial submission of the data analysis protocol, 
but before data collection, the primary outcome measure 
was modified on Dec 12, 2013, from “recovery”, an 
aggregate measure composed of clinical outcome 
(symptoms), functioning, and hospital admission defined 
using the Strauss & Carpenter Scale to a composite clinical 
outcome (persistent positive symptoms, use of clozapine 
for treatment resistance, or death by suicide), which was 
defined as the primary outcome to align the present study 
with the primary outcome of symptom remission in the 
original RCT,13 as well as with previously available and 
subsequently published data supporting the concept that

Data are n (%), mean (SD), or median (IQR), unless stated otherwise. PANSS=Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Differences between the maintenance and discontinuation 
groups were not significant. *Data were available in patients who had an end of open-treatment assessment. †PANSS measures the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia with a 
range of 30 to 210, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. ‡The mean daily dose of each antipsychotic was converted to an equivalent dose of chlorpromazine. 
§Duration of untreated psychosis was defined as the interval between onset of psychotic symptoms and first receipt of antipsychotic treatment. Duration of untreated psychosis 
was assessed using the Interview for the Retrospective Assessment of the Onset of Schizophrenia, which is a standardised, semi-structured interview conducted on patients and 
their close relatives within 4 months following the first episode. A review of the case notes was also done as collateral information to minimise recall bias. ¶Data are missing for

**The modified Medication Adherence Rating Scale was used to capture behaviours and attitude towards medication in the previous month. The first five items capture patients’ 
compliance behaviours in a 4-point scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The remaining nine items refer to patients’ attitude towards taking medication, ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate better adherence behaviour and a more positive attitude. Data were available in patients who had completed the 
end of open-treatment assessment: 60 in the maintenance treatment group and 54 in the early discontinuation group.

incapacity. Each event was assessed for a relation to 
treatment during the randomised trial. Side-effects were 
assessed directly at the follow-up study visit, including 
movement disorders assessed with three scales.25–27 
Because antipsychotic drugs can cause metabolic 
dysregulation, weight, height, fasting glucose, total 
cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were measured. 
General side-effects were assessed using a standardised 
scale.28
Statistical analysis
For the primary outcome analysis, we used risk ratios [RR] 
and 95% CIs to compare the frequency of long-term poor 
outcomes between all patients in the intervention groups 
of the RCT, irrespective of whether direct follow-up was 
available. We did sensitivity analyses to assess the use of 
positive symptom assessment information from the RCT 
to predict outcomes in patients for whom chart reviews 
could not be obtained, reclassifying these remaining 
patients as either having all good outcomes or all poor 
outcomes. We also assessed the validity of our definitions 
for good and poor clinical outcomes with a series of 
comparisons of symptomatic and functional measures 
between the outcome groups, irrespective of assignment 
during the randomised trial. We compared secondary 
outcome measures using RR or independent t tests.
To determine if relapse accounted for in whole or in 
part the effects of early treatment discontinuation on 
long-term outcome, we did a mediation analysis using 
logistic regression models and a Sobel test. We also 
calculated the percentage of the total effect being 
mediated by the indirect effect of relapse.29 For serious 
adverse events, we calculated standardised mortality 
ratios based on age–gender population mortality rate and 
age–gender death by suicide rate. All statistical analyses 
were done using IBM SPSS, version 24.0.
The randomised trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.

registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01926340.

Results
We interviewed and obtained chart reviews for 142 (80%) of 
178 patients who participated in the original RCT13 
(figure 1). For the 36 remaining patients, we also did 
longitudinal chart reviews, identifying death by suicide or 
clozapine treatment as primary outcome components in 
eight patients (two from the maintenance group and six 
from the early discontinuation group). For the remaining 
28 patients (13 from the maintenance group and 15 from 
the early discontinuation group), we used positive 
symptom assessment information from the RCT to predict 
outcomes. The inter-rater reliability for positive symptom 
ratings (intraclass correlation), between three raters on ten 
independent cases, was 0·99 for delusions, 1·00 for 
conceptual disorganisation, 0·88 for hallucinations, 
0·99 for suspiciousness, and 0·95 for unusual thought 
content. At 10 year follow-up, there were no significant 
differences across all variables at baseline between the 
intervention groups (table 1).
After completion of the RCT, patients received 
naturalistic treatment, with antipsychotic drug treatment

Data are n (%) or mean (SD), unless stated otherwise. Risk ratio was used for categorical variables; hazard ratio (Cox regression) was used for time to event variables 
(requiring clozapine and suicide); independent t test was used for continuous variables. SOFAS=Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. RFS=Role 
Functioning Scale. PANSS=Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. SUMD=Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder. SF-36=36-item short-form health survey. 
MCS=mental component summary. PCS=physical component summary. *Risk ratio (95% CI) was used for the primary clinical outcome. For other measures, we used 
Cramer’s V for categorical variables, Cohen’s d (normally distributed) and Rosenthal’s r (non-normally distributed) for continuous variables. Effect sizes were categorised as 
small (0·2–0·4), medium (0·5–0·7), or large (≥0·8). †The primary long-term outcome measure was defined categorically, with poor outcome including any of the following: 
persistent positive symptoms of psychosis, requirement for clozapine, or death by suicide; absence of all three of these was deemed to indicate a good long-term clinical 
outcome. ‡Secondary outcomes from end of open treatment assessments were available for 74 patients in the early maintenance treatment group and 68 patients in the 
early discontinuation group. §SOFAS assesses social and occupational functioning in patients with psychiatric illness using a range of scores from 1 to 100, with lower 
scores representing impaired functioning. ¶RFS measures the functioning level in patients with psychiatric disorders, focusing on four domains: work, independent living 
and self-care, immediate social network relationships, and extended social network relationships. Each domain is rated on a 7-point scale, with lower scores representing 
lower functioning. ||PANSS measures the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia with a range of 30 to 210, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. PANSS has 
a total of 30 items, with seven items on positive symptoms, seven on negative symptoms, and 16 on general psychopathology. Data were obtained from 74 patients in the 
early maintenance treatment group and 68 patients in the early discontinuation group. **Global clinical impression assesses the global symptoms in patients with 
psychotic disorders and is consisted of two individual scores—namely, the severity of illness (ranging from 1 [not mentally ill] to 7 [extremely ill]) and improvement 
(ranging from 1 [very much improved] to 7 [very much worsened]). Data were obtained from 75 patients in the early maintenance treatment group and 68 patients in the 
early discontinuation group. ††The Calgary Depression Scale for schizophrenia assesses the depressive level in schizophrenia, exclusive of other dimensions of 
psychopathology. The scale consists of nine items rated on a 4-point scale from absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), to severe (4). Data were obtained from 74 patients in the 
early maintenance treatment group and 67 patients in the early discontinuation group. ‡‡The abridged SUMD measures insight in schizophrenia. It consists of three items: 
global awareness of mental disorders, awareness of the consequences of mental disorder, and awareness of the effects of medication; with a rating of 1 indicating 
awareness, 2 indicating somewhat aware or unaware, and 3 indicating severely unaware. A global mean score was computed by summing up the three items, with higher 
scores indicating poor awareness. Data were obtained from 75 patients in the early maintenance treatment group and 66 patients in the early discontinuation group. 
§§SF-36 consists of 36 items on functional health and wellbeing. The scores can be classified into the MCS (scores ranging from 14 to 70; data obtained from 70 patients in 
the early maintenance treatment group and 58 patients in the early discontinuation group) and the PCS (scores ranging from 21 to 74; data were obtained from 71 patients 
in the early maintenance treatment group and 58 patients in the early discontinuation group). Higher scores indicate better functional health and wellbeing.

received for a mean duration of 106·4 months (SD 18·1; 
table 1). 110 (80%) of 138 patients with complete 
medication data at follow-up continued to take 
antipsychotic medication at the follow-up assessment, 
with a mean total dose of 355·0 mg (SD 285·4) of 
chlorpromazine equivalents per day. Self-reported 
adherence was high. Aside from the difference in 
exposure during the RCT, no differences in duration or 
doses of antipsychotic drug treatment between the early 
discontinuation and maintenance groups over the 
10 years of naturalistic treatment were reported. Similarly, 
clinical care received did not differ between the two 
intervention groups (appendix).
Poor long-term clinical outcome occurred in 35 (39%) of 
89 patients randomly assigned to the discontinuation 
group versus in 19 (21%) of 89 patients assigned to the 
maintenance group (RR 1·84, 95% CI 1·15–2·96; 
p=0·012; table 2). Sensitivity analyses indicated similar 
results if analyses were limited to patients available for 
direct follow-up assessment (150 of 178 patients; RR 2·05, 
1·15–3·68; p=0·016) or if the remaining 28 patients were 
classified as either poor outcome (RR 1·58, 1·06–2·34; 
p=0·023) or good outcome (RR 2·00, 1·10–3·63; 
p=0·023).
The initially positive, symptom-free patients recruited 
in the present study represent a relevant group to answer 
the clinical question of maintenance discontinuation. To 
provide an indication of the long-term outcome of a 
broader range of patients with first-episode psychosis, 
we did a post-hoc analysis to compare patients with first-
episode psychosis whose initial treatment response was 
less favourable than would have been included in this 
study (ie, patients with at least 1 month of mild positive 
symptoms or who had already relapsed) with the 
maintenance and discontinuation groups (appendix).16 
The early discontinuation group in our study had a 
similar high prevalence of poor long-term clinical 
outcomes (35 [39%] of 89 patients) as this initially less 
favourable cohort (33 [49%] of 68 patients) after 10 years 
(RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·56–1·14; p=0·21), whereas the 
maintenance group had fewer long-term poor clinical 
outcomes (19 [21%] of 89; RR 0·43, 0·27–0·69; 
p<0·0001).
We also did a post-hoc analysis to investigate the 
relation between poor long-term clinical outcome and 
measures of symptomatic and functional outcome 
(appendix). Our direct assessment of psychosis at the 
outcome 
timepoint 
was 
a 
one-time 
face-to-face 
assessment. The presence of psychosis (persistent 
positive symptoms above threshold) was the largest 
contributor to poor clinical outcome. Patients with poor 
long-term clinical outcomes also had more severe overall 
symptom scores than patients with good long-term 
clinical outcomes (p<0·0001), more months with 
psychosis present during the entire follow-up period 
(p=0·0030) indicated by chart review, a lower score on 
independent living (p=0·034), and lower mental health 
component scores on the 36-item short-form health 
survey measure of health-related quality of life 
(p=0·0030).
We did a binary logistic regression analysis to assess 
whether diagnosis (schizophrenia vs non-schizophrenia) 
would affect the significant relation between treatment 
and outcome. Treatment group was a significant factor 
related to outcome (odds ratio [OR] 0·41, 95% CI 
0·21–0·80; p=0·0090): schizophrenia diagnosis was not 
(OR 1·85, 0·95–3·60; p=0·070). There were no significant 
differences between long-term clinical outcome and the 
baseline measures of age (t=0·953; p=0·342), gender 
(χ²=1·966; p=0·161), years of education (t=–0·202; 
p=0·840), employment (χ²=0·070; p=0·792), medication 
dose taken (t=–0·814; p=0·417), or schizophrenia 
diagnosis (χ²=0·018; p=0·893).
There were no significant differences in the secondary 
outcomes between the early discontinuation and 
maintenance treatment groups (table 2).
As previously reported, the early discontinuation group 
had more relapses during the RCT.13 However, the clinical 
characteristics of relapses, including severity, duration, 
and resolution of positive symptoms, did not differ 
between the intervention groups (appendix), and these 
relapse characteristics did not differentiate between the 
good and poor long-term outcome groups (appendix).
We did a post-hoc mediation analysis of the effects of 
relapse and of treatment group during the RCT on risk for 
long-term poor clinical outcome (figure 2; appendix). The 
total effect between treatment group and long-term 
clinical outcome was significant (β 0·87 [SE 0·34]; 
p=0·010). Treatment group was a significant predictor of 
relapse during the RCT (β 1·36 [SE 0·32]; p<0·0001), and 
that relapse was a significant predictor of long-term 
outcome (β 1·56, [SE 0·38]; p<0·0001). The direct effect 
between treatment and outcome was no longer significant 
after controlling for the mediator of relapse (β 0·43 
[SE 0·37]; p=0·24). The estimated indirect effect of relapse

on treatment group and outcome was significant, 
suggesting that the increased risk for poor long-term 
outcome associated with early discontinuation was 
mediated through the increased risk of relapse during the 
RCT (Sobel test, t=2·97 [SE 0·71]; p=0·0030). The 
proportion of the total effect of the treatment group on 
outcome that was mediated by the indirect effect of relapse 
was 58% (0·1362 [indirect effect]/0·2337 [total effect]).
Death by suicide was the only serious adverse event and 
did not differ between treatment intervention groups 
(table 2). During the 1661 person-years of observation, 
six (3%) of 178 participants died, all by suicide 
(four patients in the discontinuation group and two in the 
maintenance group; all during the follow-up period). The 
crude mortality rate was 3·6 deaths per 1000 person-
years. Compared with age-matched and gender-matched 
Hong Kong population data, the standardised mortality 
ratio was 5·64 (95% CI 2·29–11·73; p<0·0001). The 
suicide-specific 
standardised 
mortality 
ratio 
was 
31·82 (12·90–179·13; p<0·0001) in the whole population, 
40·4 (12·84–97·46; p<0·0001) in the early discontinuation 
group, and 21·0 (3·60–70·89; p<0·0001) in the early 
maintenance group.
For participants assessed directly at the 10 year 
follow-up, no significant differences in movement 
disorders, metabolic measures, or other side-effects were 
reported (table 3).
Discussion
Early discontinuation of antipsychotics after 1 year of 
maintenance was associated with a higher risk of poor 
long-term clinical outcome at 10 years. A post-hoc 
analysis suggested that the adverse consequences of early 
discontinuation were mediated in part through early 
relapse during the 1 year period following medication 
discontinuation.
This study addresses a pressing question (medication 
discontinuation) in an important population (patients 
with first-episode psychosis who responded well to 
treatment with no residual psychotic symptoms), in a 
context that goes beyond available guidelines and data 
(broadly suggesting at least 1 year of treatment).

Notably, the clinical outcome started to diverge in the 
cohorts included in this study from the very first episode 
of psychosis. Some patients did not achieve resolution of 
psychotic symptoms30 and some had relapsed within 
months.5 
In 
the 
real-world 
setting, 
medication 
discontinuation is generally not recommended for these 
groups.22,31 For patients who attained symptom resolution, 
present guidelines suggest maintenance treatment for at 
least 1 year,22,31 but do not offer more specific guidance for 
after this point because of the paucity of long-term 
outcome studies.
In an open-label study,10,11 Wunderink and colleagues 
randomly assigned a broad range of patients with early 
psychosis (including those with persistent psychotic 
symptoms corresponding to a score of moderate 
[rating of 4] using the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale), and found a dose reduction or discontinuation 
strategy might be beneficial to the long-term functional 
outcome. 
However, 
the 
issue 
of 
medication 
discontinuation was not addressed directly because 
discontinuation was implemented in only half of the 
patients. In that study, only 45% of patients had a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia, and 35% had comorbid 
substance dependence or abuse. The patients differed 
from the present study in having only 6 months of 
maintenance treatment at entry.
In our double-blind RCT,13 we focused on patients 
with good initial outcome (no residual psychotic 
symptoms) and investigated the effect of discontinuation 
because this is generally consistent with patients’ 
preferences. Our patients had no comorbid substance 
abuse, most fulfilled the diagnosis of schizophrenia 
(75%), and all had completed at least 1 year of 
maintenance treatment. The present study addresses 
the 10 year outcome of this cohort. Our primary 
outcome was clinical (persistent positive symptoms, 
need for clozapine, and death by suicide), aligned with 
previous recommendations,7 suggesting that persistent 
positive symptoms were the largest contributor to poor 
long-term outcome.32,33 Notably, our study excluded 
patients who were non-responsive to treatment from 
the outset,34,35 and some of the included patients 
developed a poor response later, after initially good 
responses. This late poor response necessitated 
clozapine treatment in some patients, with its 
associated side-effects and risks.
Mediation analysis supported early relapse as a mediator 
of the long-term effect of treatment discontinuation. This 
finding indicates that relapse might itself alter the course 
of a psychotic illness. In this regard, it is important to 
recognise that 80% of patients in both intervention groups 
eventually had a relapse during the 10 year period. 
However, relapse early in the second to third year during 
the course of illness, following treatment discontinuation, 
seemed to carry more adverse implications for long-term 
outcome, raising the suggestion that there might be a 
time window or critical period during which a relapse 
might be course-modifying. In the group of patients 
studied in this Article, we found no evidence that any 
specific clinical features of the relapse such as severity, 
need for hospital admission, or time to resolution 
contributed to long-term outcome.
The main limitation of our study is the extent to which 
conclusions can be generalised. A low proportion of 
the patients with first-episode psychosis studied in 
Hong Kong had comorbid substance abuse and 
consequently the cohort would be likely to have more 
homogeneity than an equivalent cohort studied 
elsewhere.
We focused on patients with complete symptom 
resolution after the first episode because in practice this 
is the group in whom an understandable expectation 
about medication discontinuation arose. To put the 
present findings in a wider first-episode psychosis 
context, we compared data from the present RCT cohort 
with a cohort of patients with less satisfactory initial 
outcome (thus excluded from the RCT). Patients with 
early symptom resolution randomly assigned to 
maintenance in our study fared best. Patients with 
early symptom resolution randomly assigned to 
discontinuation had less favourable long-term outcome, 
similar to patients without early symptom resolution.
A high proportion of our patients were employed 
(71% during the RCT and 70% at follow-up), which is 
different from cohorts in other countries. The high 
employment might be related to the fact that we 
specifically targeted a highly responsive cohort of patients 
with first-episode psychosis, in addition to the cultural 
expectation among Chinese patients to participate in the 
workforce like other people in the community.
Non-adherence ratings based on pill counting during 
the RCT and patients’ self-reports at follow-up might 
overestimate true adherence. Owing to the more 
collectivistic culture, with more family involvement in 
facilitating medication adherence, non-adherence in 
Hong Kong was lower than in other countries. 
Additionally, the original RCT excluded patients who 
required depot medication to ensure adherence because 
the design involved randomisation to an oral medication 
or placebo. Future studies designed to use depot 
medication, and depot placebo, would help address 
these important considerations concerning adherence. 
A possible consequence of using a standardised 
maintenance treatment (quetiapine) in the RCT could be 
some early relapses in the maintenance group related to 
switching medication.
Finally, although our study is the largest yet reported 
of an RCT testing the effects of early medication 
discontinuation, we cannot be certain of the possible 
effects of schizophrenia versus other diagnoses of 
psychotic illness on the effects of early relapse on long 
term outcome, investigation of which will require larger 
studies with careful documentation of diagnoses over 
time.

A 2017 review and commentary highlight the increasing 
interest in the long-term consequences of antipsychotic 
drug treatment.2,36 One consequence of long-term 
antipsychotic medications in animals, and possibly in 
some patients, is the development over time of dopamine 
receptor hypersensitivity, or a so-called supersensitivity 
psychosis. Characteristics of this syndrome are a severe 
rebound of symptom severity after switching or 
discontinuing medication, and the development of 
tardive dyskinesia. The prevalence of supersensitivity 
psychosis is uncertain, and although individual patients 
might exhibit this pattern of symptomatology, substantial 
evidence suggests that the more usual pattern of 
response or changes in response to maintenance 
antipsychotic medications over time is not consistent 
with the supersensitivity phenomena.2,36 Our study was 
not 
designed 
to 
investigate 
the 
possibility 
of 
supersensitivity psychosis in detail.
In summary, our data are relevant to patients who have 
symptomatic resolution following 1 year’s treatment of 
first-episode psychosis (predominantly schizophrenia) 
and wish to consider medication discontinuation after a 
period of maintenance. The data suggest that an 
awareness of the increased risk for poor long-term 
outcome, in addition to the risk for relapse in the short-
term, must be taken into consideration in this decision. 
In patients with first-episode psychosis with a full initial 
response to treatment, medication continuation for at 
least the first 3 years after starting treatment (about 
2 years of maintenance treatment before study entry and 
1 year of treatment in the trial) is effective in preventing 
relapse and decreasing the risk for a poor long-term
