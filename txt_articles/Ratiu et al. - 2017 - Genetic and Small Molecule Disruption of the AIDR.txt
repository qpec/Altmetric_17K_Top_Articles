B lymphocytes play a key role in type 1 diabetes (T1D) development by serving as a subset of APCs preferentially supporting the
expansion of autoreactive pathogenic T cells. As a result of their pathogenic importance, B lymphocyte–targeted therapies have
received considerable interest as potential T1D interventions. Unfortunately, the B lymphocyte–directed T1D interventions tested
to date failed to halt b cell demise. IgG autoantibodies marking humans at future risk for T1D indicate that B lymphocytes
producing them have undergone the affinity-maturation processes of class switch recombination and, possibly, somatic hyper-
mutation. This study found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene required for
class switch recombination/somatic hypermutation induction inhibits T1D development in the NOD mouse model. The activation-
induced cytidine deaminase protein induces genome-wide DNA breaks that, if not repaired through RAD51-mediated homologous
recombination, result in B lymphocyte death. Treatment with the RAD51 inhibitor 4,49-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 29-disulfonic
acid also strongly inhibited T1D development in NOD mice. The genetic and small molecule–targeting approaches expanded
CD73+ B lymphocytes that exert regulatory activity suppressing diabetogenic T cell responses. Hence, an initial CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated genetic modification approach has identified the AID/RAD51 axis as a target for a potentially clinically translatable
pharmacological approach that can block T1D development by converting B lymphocytes to a disease-inhibitory CD73+ regula-
tory state.

A
lthough the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing
pancreatic b cells underlying the development of type 1
diabetes (T1D) is ultimately mediated by the combined
activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, it is clear in the NOD mouse
model, and likely in humans, that B lymphocytes play an additional
key pathogenic role (1–9). Studies in NOD mice indicate that
B lymphocytes contribute to T1D by being the subset of APCs
that most efficiently supports the expansion of pathogenic T cell
responses (10–12). This is due to the presence of B lymphocytes
expressing plasma membrane–bound Ig molecules capable of
efficiently capturing and internalizing b cell autoantigens for
subsequent processing and presentation to diabetogenic T cells
(10, 12). Similar populations of pathogenic B lymphocytes also
likely contribute to T1D development in humans, given the
presence of circulating b cell Ag-specific autoantibodies that are
critical biomarkers for identifying individuals at high risk for
future disease (13).
Most autoantibodies in humans with, or at risk for, T1D are of an
IgG isotype, indicating that the B lymphocytes producing them
have undergone affinity maturation (13). Affinity maturation is
the process occurring within germinal centers (GCs) by which
B lymphocytes undergo Ig diversification and clonal selection. Ig

 diversification occurs through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and
class switch recombination (CSR), whereas clonal selection re-
sults from competitive interaction with follicular helper T (Tfh)
cells (14). Selective pressures within GCs result in the preferential
expansion of B lymphocytes with greater affinity for their cognate
Ag. In autoimmune diseases, such as T1D, aberrant selection
processes lead to expansion of self-reactive B lymphocytes, which
may become autoantibody-secreting cells or retain their surface Ig
to serve as potentially more effective APCs (15). Although previous
findings suggest that affinity maturation is important to T1D path-
ogenesis (16), the significance of CSR/SHM processes to disease
progression has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, it remains un-
clear whether B lymphocytes must undergo CSR/SHM to become
effective autoreactive APCs supporting T1D pathogenesis.
Because of their role in supporting pathogenic T cell responses,
there has been considerable interest in determining whether
B lymphocyte–targeted approaches could provide an effective T1D
intervention. A clinical trial found that transient treatment with the
B lymphocyte–depleting CD20-specific rituximab Ab allowed for
early (1 y), but not long-term (2 y), preservation of C-peptide pro-
duction in recent-onset T1D patients (17). The lack of long-term
protection may be attributable, at least in part, to the rebound of
B lymphocytes following transient rituximab treatment. However,
in NOD mice, pancreatic islet–infiltrating B lymphocytes lose cell
surface expression of CD20 and, thus, are rendered resistant to de-
pletion by a rituximab-like murine anti-CD20 Ab (18). These results
indicate a need to identify alternative strategies that may provide a
more effective B lymphocyte–directed T1D-intervention approach.
In the current study, we evaluated the contribution of CSR/
SHM to T1D development and whether specifically targeting B
lymphocytes undergoing these processes could provide an effec-
tive therapeutic intervention. As a first step, we used CRISPR-Cas9
technology to directly ablate, in NOD mice, the activation-induced
cytidine deaminase gene (Aicda) necessary for initiating CSR/
SHM processes (19–21). Aicda ablation significantly inhibited
T1D development.
The Aicda-encoded activation-induced cytidine deaminase
protein (AID) initiates SHM and CSR by inducing point mutations
and dsDNA breaks (DSBs) in Ig gene sequences. Additionally,
AID generates DSBs elsewhere throughout the genome (22, 23)
that are normally repaired by RAD51 complex–mediated homo-
logous recombination (HR). In the absence of HR, B lymphocytes
in which SHM/CSR has been initiated undergo cell death (23).
The small molecule 4,49-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 29-disulfonic
acid (DIDS) inhibits RAD51-mediated HR (23). DIDS has been
used as a model agent in previous studies, indicating that RAD51
blockade could be considered an intervention for eliminating
AID+ B cell lymphomas (23). In this study, we used DIDS treat-
ment to determine whether targeting the AID/RAD51 axis could
provide a B lymphocyte–directed intervention for T1D. Interest-
ingly, genetic and DIDS-mediated disruption of the AID/RAD51
axis increased the numbers of CD73+ B lymphocytes that exerted
regulatory processes actively suppressing T1D. Together, these
studies indicate that therapies capable of expanding regulatory B
lymphocytes, potentially including those targeting affinity-maturation
processes, may ultimately represent clinically translatable T1D-
intervention strategies.
Materials and Methods
Mice
NOD and C57BL/6J (B6) mice are maintained at The Jackson Labora-
tory
under
specific
pathogen–free
conditions.
Lymphocyte-deficient
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidEmv30b/Dvs (NOD-scid) mice were described previ-
ously (24). B6.Cg-Aicda,tm1Hon./HonRbrc mice were kindly provided to
K.D.M. by Dr. T. Honjo (Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University).
CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to directly generate NOD.Aicda2/2
mice by cytoplasmic microinjection of NOD/ShiLtDvs zygotes with
100 ng/ml Cas9 mRNA and 50 ng/ml the following single-guide RNAs
(sgRNAs), with the upper case letters being the complement to the targeted
genomic sequence: 59-gaaattaatacgactcactataggAGTCACGCTGGAGAC-
CGATAgttttagagctagaaatagc-39 or 59-gaaattaatacgactcactataggACTTCTT-
TTGCTTCATCAGAgttttagagctagaaatagc-39 targeting exon 1 or 2, respec-
tively, of Aicda (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Exon 1 and 2 sgRNAs were
microinjected into 47 and 39 zygotes, respectively. These microinjected
zygotes were then transplanted into three and two recipient females, re-
spectively. Tail DNA from surviving progeny was sequenced and identified
100 and 14.3% targeting efficiency for exon 1 (14/14) and exon 2 (2/14).
Mosaic founder mice identified as carrying a mutation in the targeted region
of Aicda were backcrossed to NOD/ShiLtDvs mice. The resulting N1
progeny were screened for germline transmitted mutations by PCR ampli-
fication of exon 1 with the primers 59-TCACACAACAGCACTGAAGC-39
and 59-ACCCAAAAGACCTGAGCAGA-39 or exon 2 with the primers: 59-
CGCTCAGCTACCTTGCCTAT-39 and 59-CGAAGTCCAGTGAGCAGGA-
39. PCR products were purified and analyzed by sequencing on an ABI 3730
DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the forward or reverse primer.
Mutant sequences were separated from wild-type (WT) using the Poly Peak
Parser package (25) for R. A 2-bp deletion along with a 309-bp insertion was
selected for a line targeting exon 1 (referred to as Line 1 in the text; formal
name: NOD/ShiLtDvs-Aicda,em1Cml./Dvs), and a 13-bp deletion was se-
lected for a line targeting exon 2 (referred to as Line 26 in the text; formal
name: NOD/ShiLtDvs-Aicda,em2Cml./Dvs). N1 mutants were intercrossed
to fix the mutations to homozygosity, after which lines were maintained by
brother–sister matings. Mutant mice were genotyped by amplification-length
polymorphisms using the same primers used for sequencing (Supplemental
Fig. 1B). Mice were matched by age and sex for experimentation, but no
specific randomization method was performed to form experimental groups.
The Jackson Laboratory’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
approved all protocols involving mice.
RT-PCR and gene-expression analysis
B lymphocytes were purified from 8-wk-old female NOD or B6 mice. Total
RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). Primers for
Aicda RT-PCR (26) are 59-CAGGGACGGCATGAGACCT-39 and 59-TC-
AGCCTTGCGGTCTTCACA-39, and primers for Gapdh are 59-GAGAA-
ACCTGCCAAGTATGATGAC-39 and 59-TGATGGTATTCAAGAGAGTAGG-
GAG-39 (27). RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with a MessageSensor
RT Kit (Thermo Fisher) and Random Decamers (Invitrogen). Power
SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) was used to determine the expres-
sion of Aicda and Gapdh. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was run using an
Applied Biosystems ViiA7, and data were analyzed using A&B RUO
software.
Monitoring of T1D development
Development of T1D was assessed by weekly monitoring of glycosuria with
Ames Diastix (Bayer), with disease onset defined by two consecutive
readings $ 0.25% (corresponds to blood glucose $ 300 mg/dl).
Histological assessment of insulitis
Quantitative mean insulitis scores were determined using the previously
described calculation method (28). Briefly, Bouin’s fixed pancreata were
sectioned at three nonoverlapping levels. Slides were stained with al-
dehyde fuchsin and H&E. Islets were scored by a blinded observer as
follows: 0, no visible lesions; 1, peri-insular noninvasive leukocytic ag-
gregates; 2, ,25% islet destruction; 3, 25–75% islet destruction; and 4,
75–100% islet destruction. The final score was determined by dividing the
cumulative score for each pancreas by the number of total islets ($20
per mouse) examined. If no b cell–containing islets were found across
three sections, the analyzed mouse received an insulitis score of 4. The
final insulitis score incorporates the proportion of islets in analyzed mice
that had undergone each level of destruction.
Islet-associated leukocyte isolation
Infiltrating islet-associated leukocytes were isolated for flow cytometry, as
previously described (18).
In vitro CSR assay
Splenic B lymphocytes were purified using anti-CD43 MicroBeads (Miltenyi
Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified B lymphocytes
were cultured at a concentration of 1 3 106 cells per milliliter in RPMI
1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Life

 Technologies), 71.5 mM 2-ME (BP176-100; Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml
penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) under stimu-
lation with recombinant murine IL-4 (25 ng/ml; PeproTech) and anti-
CD40 (1 mg/ml; BD Biosciences) or LPS (25 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich)
at 37˚C (5% CO2) for 48 h. At 48 h, cultures were restimulated as de-
scribed above. At 72 h, cultures were diluted with media back to 1 3 106
cells per milliliter. Class switching to IgG1 isotype was quantified by
flow cytometric analysis after 96 total hours in culture.
Flow cytometry
Leukocytes among the indicated samples were phenotyped by flow
cytometry using LSRII SORP (BD Biosciences) or Attune Cytometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) instrumentation, and data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (TreeStar). For Aicda2/2 experiments, single-cell sus-
pensions of splenocytes were lysed with Gey’s buffer to remove RBCs, as
previously described (29). For all experiments, propidium iodide or DAPI
was used for live/dead discrimination. All analyses were done on gated
singlets (live) cells; gating strategies are shown in Supplemental Fig. 2A,
2B. For DIDS-based experiments, prior to singlet/live gating, TER-119+
cells were excluded (Supplemental Fig. 2C) via gating strategies in lieu of
lysis procedures. The following fluorochrome-conjugated Abs (clones)
were used for these studies: CD95 (J02), GL-7 (GL7), CD43 (S7), CD69
(H1.2F3), CD21 (7G6), CD45.1 (A20), CD62L (MEL-14), CD8a (53–6.7),
CD19 (1D3), B220 (RA3-6B2), CD4 (GK1.5), CD23 (B3B4), TER-119
(TER119), and streptavidin (all from BD Biosciences); CXCR5 (L138-
D7), CD21 (7G6), IgD (11-26c.2a), CD80 (16-10A1), GL-7 (GL7),
CD73 (TY/11.8), CD39 (Duha59), CD45.1 (A20), PD-1 (RMP1-30), PD-
L2 (TY25), CD4 (GK1.5), CD23 (B3B4), B220 (RA3-6B2), and TCRb
(H57-597) (all from BioLegend); CD19 (1D3), IgM (II/41), CD45.1 (A20),
and CD44 (IM7) (all from eBioscience); CD8a (53-6.7), CD19 (1D3), and
CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) (all from Tonbo Biosciences); and IgG1 (1070-09)
(SouthernBiotech). Splenic B lymphocyte subsets were characterized by
flow cytometry, as previously described (30).
Serum Ig isotype ELISA
Quantification of serum Ig isotypes was performed as described (31). Coating
Abs were as follows: IgG1, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgM (SouthernBiotech). De-
tection Ab was goat anti-mouse k coupled to alkaline phosphatase (South-
ernBiotech). Ab standards included IgG1 and IgG2b (SouthernBiotech) and
IgG3 and IgM (Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were analyzed using an Infinite M200
Pro running Magellan 7.0 software (Tecan).
Adoptive transfers
Splenic B lymphocytes and T cells were purified by negative depletion of
CD11b+, CD11c+, TER-119+, and CD3ε+ populations and, in some ex-
periments, CD73+ (for B lymphocyte purification) or CD11b+, CD11c+,
TER-119+, and B220+ cells (for T cell purification), using biotin-conjugated
Abs and streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). NOD-scid recipients
were injected i.v. with the indicated B lymphocytes and/or T cells and were
monitored for T1D development. The following specific biotinylated Abs
were used: CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (HL3), CD3ε (145-2C11), TER-119
(TER119), and B220 (RA3-6B2) (all from BD Biosciences). CD73 (TY/11.8)
was obtained from BioLegend.
CD73+ B lymphocyte–mediated T cell suppression assay
B lymphocytes from 6–8-wk-old NOD.Aicda2/2 or NOD mice were pu-
rified from pooled spleens and pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) by negative
depletion of CD11b+, CD11c+, CD3ε+, and TER-119+ cells using Biotin
Binder Dynabeads (Invitrogen). CD73+ and CD732 B lymphocytes from
the purified pools were then sorted directly into Heat-Inactivated HyClone
FBS (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using a FACSAria II SORP sorter (BD
Biosciences) equipped with an 85-mm nozzle. CD4+ CD732 T cells were
purified from spleens of 6–8-wk-old NOD mice by negative depletion of
CD11b+, CD11c+, TER-119+, B220+, CD8+, and CD73+ cells using
streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and the above-described Abs.
Purified CD4+ CD732 T cells were labeled with 5 mM Cell Proliferation
Dye eFluor 670 (eBioscience). Sorted B lymphocytes and labeled T cells
were washed with serum-free X-VIVO 20 medium (Lonza) three times to
remove residual serum and were cocultured under stimulation with soluble
anti-CD40 (1 mg/ml), plate-bound anti-CD3ε (5 mg/ml), and soluble anti-
CD28 (2 mg/ml; all from BD Biosciences) in the presence of 10 mM AMP
and 0 or 100 mM a,b-methyleneadenosine 59-diphosphate (APCP; all from
Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free X-VIVO 20 medium supplemented with
10 mM HEPES (Lonza), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies),
71.5 mM 2-ME (Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml strep-
tomycin (both from Sigma-Aldrich), and nonessential amino acids (Lonza)
at 37˚C for 4 d. T cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry, and
data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Percentage suppression was
calculated relative to the mean proliferation index of T cells in the pres-
ence of CD732 B lymphocytes with 0 mM AMP and 0 mM APCP.
ELISA measurement of IL-10 production
CD73+ or CD732 B lymphocytes were sorted as described above and
cultured at 5.0 3 105 cells per milliliter in X-VIVO 20 medium with 0 or
10 mg/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 d. IL-10 concentration in culture
supernatants was determined using a Mouse IL-10 ELISA MAX Kit
(BioLegend).
DIDS treatments
Beginning at 6, 8, or 10 wk of age, female NOD mice were injected i.p.
weekly with 0, 10, or 50 mg/kg DIDS (CAS 67483-13-0; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for the indicated periods of time. Vehicle was 0.1 M po-
tassium bicarbonate.
Insulin autoantibody status
Serum insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) were detected as described as part of
the International Workshop on Lessons From Animal Models for Human
Type 1 Diabetes (32).
Ig repertoire library preparation
Library preparation and data analysis for Ig repertoire sequencing were
performed as previously described (33), with minor alterations. Briefly,
female NOD/ShiLtDvs mice received weekly DIDS (50 mg/kg) or vehicle
treatment from 8 to 16 wk of age, after which PLN B lymphocytes
(CD45.1+ CD19+ B220+) were sort purified using a FACSAria II. Simi-
larly, purified PLN-resident B lymphocytes from 8-wk-old unmanipulated
NOD and NOD.Aicda2/2 mice served as controls. Purified cells were
washed with PBS, resuspended in Buffer RLT, and snap-frozen. Total
RNA was purified using an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). RNA integ-
rity number determined, using the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit
(Agilent), for all samples was 10. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using
SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Takara) with IgH isotype-specific
primers (1 mM each) IgHG1/2: 59-CAGGGATCCAKAGTTC-39, IgHG3:
59-CAGGGCTCCATAGTTC-39, IgHM: 59-GATGACTTCAGTGTTGT-39,
and IgHD: 59-AGTGGCTGACTTCCAA-39; and 1 mM template-switch
adapter (59-AAGCAGUGGTAUCAACGCAGAGUNNNNUNNNNUNN-
NNUCTTrGrGrGrG-39, U, deoxyuridine) to introduce a unique molecular
identifier (UMI) sequence to the 39-end of each cDNA molecule. Reverse-
transcription reactions were set-up as follows: 5 ml of RNA and 2 ml of
IgH isotype-specific primers (10 mM each) were heated to 72˚C for 3 min
and then incubated at 42˚C for 3 min to anneal primers. Then the following
components were added to each reaction for a final concentration of 13
first-strand buffer, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM 59-template switch adapter, and
1 mM each dNTP (Invitrogen), 40 U RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and 200 U
SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase. cDNA was then treated with 5 U
uracil-DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) to degrade residual tem-
plate switch adapter and then purified using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR
Purification Kit (Takara). First PCR was performed using cDNA equivalent
to 2.5 ng of RNA and Platinum SuperFi DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen)
with the following primers: M1SS: 59-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCA-39,

 Ig repertoire sequencing and data analysis
Sequencing libraries were spiked with a 30% PhiX Control v3 and loaded at
10 pM concentration for asymmetric 400 + 225–bp paired-end sequencing
performed using a MiSeq sequencer running a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (all
from Illumina). Sequencing data were processed using MIGEC (34), as
follows. First, raw reads were demultiplexed based on each sample’s two
6-nt barcodes and then split into molecular identifier groups (MIGs)
consisting of reads sharing the same UMI. MIGs consisting of fewer than
five reads were discarded. Then, using only the first reads, consensus se-
quences were determined independently for 59- and 39-end reads within
each MIG. 59- and 39-end read consensus sequences were then merged
using the MiTools Merge Utility (https://github.com/milaboratory/mitools),
with the minimum sequence similarity set to 70% for reads with overlapping
parts, to generate full-length IgH sequences for each MIG. Using MiXCR
(35), full-length Ig sequences were then mapped to the mouse reference
germline sequences, and the resulting alignments were used to assemble
clonotypes. When assembling clonotypes, a specific mutation proba-
bility of 1024 was used for frequency-based correction of PCR or se-
quencing errors. Assembled clonotypes were then exported for diversity
analyses using VDJtools (36). Clonotypic diversity estimates were
calculated based on CDR3 nucleotide sequence and V- and J-segment
usage.
Statistical analysis
All graphs and statistics were generated using Prism 6 (GraphPad) or Excel
(Microsoft). Specific statistical analyses are listed within the respective
figure legends. The Mann–Whitney, Wilcoxon, and t test analyses were all
two-tailed.
Results
NOD B lymphocytes display increased Aicda expression, and
its ablation significantly retards T1D development
B lymphocytes in NOD mice can undergo CSR/SHM, enhancing
their capacity to process and present autoantigenic epitopes to
diabetogenic T cells (16). However, it is unknown whether CSR
and SHM are naturally important contributors to the diabetogenic
activity of B lymphocytes in NOD mice, and by extension, in
disease-susceptible humans. An initial finding supporting this
possibility was that basal expression levels of Aicda necessary to
induce CSR/SHM was higher in NOD B lymphocytes than in
those from nonautoimmune-prone B6 mice (Fig. 1A). These data
support the presence of a significantly higher baseline level of
autoantigen-activated Aicda-expressing B lymphocytes in NOD
mice than in B6 controls and are consistent with previous obser-
vations that GCs are expanded in autoimmune-prone strains (37).
We next tested whether Aicda expression by NOD B lymphocytes
was critical to their diabetogenic activity. CRISPR-Cas9 technology
was used to directly target exon 1 or 2 (containing a potential
alternative start site) of Aicda in NOD zygotes (Supplemental
Fig. 1A–D). This allowed for the subsequent generation of pure
NOD background stocks carrying the exon 1 (Line 1)–targeted or
exon 2 (Line 26)–targeted Aicda allele in a homozygous state
(Supplemental Fig. 1A–D). We then assessed the ability of puri-
fied B lymphocytes from the Line 1 or 26 stocks to undergo CSR
to the IgG1 isotype following anti-CD40 and IL-4 stimulation
in vitro. Similar to the case reported for a B6 background stock (22),
B lymphocytes from Lines 1 and 26 NOD.Aicda2/2 mice displayed
significantly decreased CSR (Fig. 1B, 1C). Analyses were also
carried out to confirm that the reduced ability of NOD.Aicda2/2
B lymphocytes to undergo CSR was not the result of off-target
mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9. To do this, each NOD.
Aicda2/2 line was crossed to the established B6.Cg-Aicda,tm1Hon.
/HonRbrc stock, and purified B lymphocytes from the resulting F1
hybrids were tested for CSR capacity. The observation of similarly
reduced CSR in F1 offspring for each line demonstrates that this
phenotype is the result of our novel direct-in-NOD disruption of
Aicda (Supplemental Fig. 1E, 1F).
We then compared the female rate of T1D development for each
NOD.Aicda2/2 line with that of WT NOD controls. Both NOD.
Aicda2/2 lines exhibited similar significantly reduced rates of T1D
(Fig. 1D). Heterozygous NOD.Aicda+/2 mice developed T1D at an
intermediate rate (data not shown). Interestingly, Lines 1 and 26
NOD.Aicda2/2 mice remaining free of overt T1D at the end of the
incidence study were still characterized by significant levels of
insulitis (Fig. 1E). Next, we compared the kinetics of insulitis
progression in female NOD and NOD.Aicda2/2 mice at 7, 11, and
18 wk of age. Insulitis progression was not delayed in Line 1 NOD.
Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 1F, 1G), indicating that this could not explain
their resistance to overt T1D. Together, these data indicate that,
despite the continued presence of islet-infiltrating leukocytes in
NOD.Aicda2/2 mice, the diabetogenic nature of these cells has
been altered by genetic ablation of AID.
NOD.Aicda2/2 total B lymphocytes are numerically increased,
and GC and memory-like subsets are proportionally expanded
To initially investigate the basis for the T1D resistance of NOD.
Aicda2/2 mice, we compared them with WT controls for the pres-
ence of various immature and mature B lymphocyte populations
within spleens and PLNs. Gating strategies for subsequently de-
scribed flow cytometric studies are depicted in Supplemental Fig. 2.
Line 1 mice were used for all subsequent studies because of better
breeding proclivity and ease of genotyping compared with the equally
T1D-resistant Line 26 mice.
Selection processes to prune autoreactive B lymphocytes operate
at the immature transitional-1 (T1) stage in the spleen (38). The
frequency of splenic T1 B lymphocytes is increased in NOD.Aicda2/2
mice, whereas subsequent developmental stage transitional-2
(T2) cells are decreased (Fig. 2A). A shift in the ratio of T1/T2
cells might reflect increased tolerogenic culling of autoreactive
B lymphocytes in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice (39). Alternatively, this shift
may be the result of the decreased susceptibility of Aicda2/2
B lymphocytes to apoptosis at the T1 stage (40). Despite the dif-
fering distribution of T1 and T2 subsets, total splenic and PLN
B lymphocyte yields were higher in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice than in
WT controls (Fig. 2B). Consistent with reports of AID ablation in
other strains (41), Fas+ GL7+ GC B lymphocytes were expanded
in the spleens and PLNs of NOD.Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 2C, 2D). This
correlates with the large GC sizes observed in spleens of Aicda2/2
mice (data not shown). Also, the proportions of splenic CD80+ and
PD-L2+ memory-like B lymphocytes (42) were increased in NOD.
Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the IgM-dominated serum
isotype profile of NOD.Aicda2/2 mice parallels that of other
Aicda2/2 strains (Fig. 2F), as well as those seen in AID-deficient
patients (43). Finally, the percentages of B lymphocytes among
islet-infiltrating leukocytes (CD45.1+) were similar in NOD and
NOD.Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 2G). The proportions of islet-infiltrating
B lymphocytes in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice expressing the CD69
activation and CD80 or PD-L2 memory-like markers (42) were
similar and greater, respectively, than those in NOD controls
(Fig. 2H). Together, these data indicate that genetically ablat-
ing AID in NOD mice increases the numbers of peripheral
B lymphocytes displaying a more predominant GC and memory-
like phenotype.
AID ablation in NOD mice expands T cell populations but does
not directly affect their diabetogenic activity
T cells are the ultimate mediators of b cell destruction in T1D.
Therefore, we tested whether T cells in T1D-resistant NOD.
Aicda2/2 mice were quantitatively and/or qualitatively distinct
from those in NOD controls. Surprisingly, yields of splenic CD4+
and CD8+ T cells were increased in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 3A).

 Corresponding with increased GC B lymphocytes, fully activated
CXCR5+ PD-1+ Tfh cells were also expanded in spleens and PLNs
of NOD.Aicda2/2 mice (Fig. 3B, 3C). Although numerically ex-
panded, we sought to determine whether the intrinsic diabetogenic
activity of T cells in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice was decreased. Purified
NOD or NOD.Aicda2/2 T cells did not differ in their ability to
transfer
T1D
to
lymphocyte-deficient
NOD-scid
recipients
(Fig. 3D). Together, these data indicate that genetic ablation of AID
in NOD mice leads to an expansion of total peripheral and Tfh
subset T cells, and the observed disease protection is not due to a
decrease in their diabetogenic potential.
NOD T cells adoptively transfer T1D less efficiently in the
presence of Aicda-deficient B lymphocytes characterized by an
expanded CD73+ subset
As
described
above,
when
transferred
in
the
absence
of
B lymphocytes, purified T cells from NOD.Aicda2/2 donors ef-
ficiently induced T1D development in NOD-scid recipients. This
indicated that T1D resistance in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice does not
result from a T cell–intrinsic effect. Therefore, we assessed how
AID-deficient B lymphocytes might influence such pathogenic
effectors. To initially test this, equal numbers of purified NOD
splenic T cells and purified NOD or NOD.Aicda2/2 splenic
B lymphocytes were transferred into NOD-scid recipients. NOD
T cells induced T1D far less efficiently in NOD-scid recipients
when cotransferred with Aicda2/2 B lymphocytes than when
cotransferred with WT B lymphocytes (Fig. 4A). These results
indicated that Aicda2/2 B lymphocytes may actively suppress
diabetogenic T cell responses.
CD39 and CD73 are ectoenzymes that catalyze the conversion of
extracellular ATP to AMP and then to adenosine, respectively.
There is evidence that alterations to the CD39/CD73 purinergic
metabolic pathway play a major role in several autoimmune dis-
eases (44). Adenosine signaling through the adenosine A2a receptor

 (A2aR) can inhibit TCR signaling and prevent cellular activation
(45). In a murine colitis model, CD73 expression reportedly marks a
subset of B lymphocytes with the capacity to suppress T cell re-
sponses through adenosine production (46). Thus, we compared
the extent to which B lymphocytes from Aicda-intact and -deficient
NOD mice express CD39 and/or CD73. Levels of CD73+ B lympho-
cytes were greater within spleens, PLNs, and islets of NOD.Aicda2/2
mice compared with NOD controls (Fig. 4B, 4C). We observed
higher proportions of CD73+ B lymphocytes that either did or did
not coexpress CD39 within spleens, PLNs, and islets of NOD.
Aicda2/2 mice compared with NOD controls but found no dif-
ferences in the CD39+ CD732 fraction (Fig. 4D–F). Together,
these data indicate that the ability of NOD T cells to induce
T1D development is reduced in the presence of NOD.Aicda2/2
B lymphocytes, which contain an expanded CD73+ subset that was
previously reported to exert regulatory activity (46).
CD73+ B lymphocytes in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice exert regulatory
activity suppressing diabetogenic T cell responses
As noted above, CD73 expression can mark a population of
suppressive B lymphocytes. Aicda2/2 B lymphocytes engrafted
into NOD-scid recipients retain increased CD73 expression (Fig. 5A).
Thus, we assessed whether the expanded CD73+ B lymphocytes in
NOD.Aicda2/2 mice exert T1D suppressive effects in adoptive-
transfer experiments. Purified NOD T cells transferred T1D to
NOD-scid recipients with significantly greater efficiency when
admixed with Aicda2/2 B lymphocytes that had been depleted of
the CD73+ subset (Fig. 5B). We then carried out in vitro studies to
determine whether Aicda-deficient NOD B lymphocytes exert
suppressive effects on such pathogenic effectors through regula-
tory activity mediated by the expanded CD73+ subset. Sorted
CD73+ and CD732 B lymphocytes from NOD or NOD.Aicda2/2
mice were cultured with anti-CD40, anti-CD3/CD28–stimulated
CD732 CD4+ WT T cells, and AMP, with or without the CD73
inhibitor APCP. On a per-cell basis, CD73+ B lymphocytes from
AID-intact and -deficient NOD mice suppressed T cell prolifera-
tion equally and to a significantly greater extent than did the
CD732 subset in the presence of AMP; addition of APCP di-
minished this effect (Fig. 5C, Supplemental Fig. 3A).
It has been reported previously that B lymphocytes with an
ability to suppress T1D development in NOD mice primarily do
so through IL-10 secretion (47). Similarly, the expanded CD73+
B lymphocyte population in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice, which exhibit the
capacity to suppress diabetogenic T cell responses, secrete signifi-
cantly greater levels of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation than do their
CD732 counterparts (Fig. 5D). Together, these results indicate that

 diminished T1D development in NOD.Aicda2/2 mice is due, at least
in part, to an expansion of CD73+ B lymphocytes with the capacity
to suppress pathogenic T cell responses. CD73+ B lymphocytes
suppress T cell responses through the generation of adenosine by
this ectoenzyme and potentially by their ability to secrete IL-10
upon stimulation. These collective results also indicate that genetic
ablation of AID inhibits T1D development in NOD mice by quan-
titatively increasing, rather than qualitatively changing, immuno-
regulatory CD73+ B lymphocytes.
DIDS treatment decreases the Ig repertoire diversity of NOD
B lymphocytes
The results of our genetic studies show that AID-dependent processes
play an important role in B lymphocyte contributions to T1D devel-
opment in NOD mice. By inhibiting RAD51-mediated HR repair of
AID-initiated off-target DSBs, treatment with the small molecule
DIDS induces the death of B lymphocytes in which SHM and CSR
processes have been initiated (23). Therefore, we hypothesized that
targeting the AID/RAD51 pathway by DIDS treatment might pro-
vide an effective B lymphocyte–directed T1D intervention. To ini-
tially test this possibility, we stimulated purified NOD B lymphocytes
with anti-CD40 and IL-4 in the presence of vehicle or 150 mM
DIDS in vitro. Similar to the case for those from B6 control
mice, after 4 d of stimulation, fewer NOD B lymphocytes were
recovered from DIDS-containing cultures (Fig. 6A). In addition,
fewer anti-CD40/IL-4–stimulated B lymphocytes were recovered from
cultures containing (E)-5-acetamido-2-(4-(3-isopropylthioureido)-
2-sulfonatostyryl)benzenesulfonate, another small molecule RAD51
inhibitor that is 1500-fold more potent than DIDS (Fig. 6A,
Supplemental Fig. 4).
We next determined whether DIDS treatment affected the Ig rep-
ertoire of NOD mice in a similar manner to genetic ablation of AID.
We reasoned that the inability of NOD.Aicda2/2 B lymphocytes to
initiate CSR/SHM processes would result in a decreased Ig gene
coding repertoire diversity relative to WT controls. By extension, we
also hypothesized that DIDS-mediated disruption of the AID/RAD51
axis would recapitulate such decreases in Ig repertoire diversity.
Therefore, using established protocols (33), we used high-throughput
sequencing to characterize full-length IgH mRNAs from purified
PLN-resident B lymphocytes of individual 8-wk-old NOD and NOD.

 Aicda2/2 mice, as well as from NOD mice treated with vehicle or
50 mg/kg DIDS from 8 to 16 wk of age. To minimize overestimations
of diversity, the protocol uses template switch reverse transcription to
incorporate a 12-bp UMI at the 39-end of each cDNA molecule. This
allows for correction of sequencing and PCR errors by grouping
multiple reads originating from single cDNA molecules to form
consensus reads. Rarefaction and extrapolated Chao diversity estimate
(48) analyses revealed decreased IgH diversity among B lymphocytes
from NOD.Aicda2/2 and DIDS-treated NOD mice compared
with untreated and vehicle-treated NOD controls, respectively
(Fig. 6B, 6C). To ensure that sampling bias resulting from var-
iances in sequencing depth was not responsible for the observed
differences in diversity, each sample was down-sampled to 500
consensus reads. After 500 iterations of resampling, Aicda2/2
and DIDS-treated B lymphocytes had decreased diversity, as mea-
sured by the observed diversity and lower bound total diversity (Efron–
Thisted) estimate (49), compared with their respective controls
(Fig. 6D, 6E). Together, the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that
NOD B lymphocytes are as susceptible to DIDS as previously
reported for those from the B6 strain (23), and treatment with this
small molecule decreases IgH repertoire diversity in a manner
similar to Aicda ablation.
Molecular inhibition of the AID/RAD51 axis inhibits T1D
development
We next tested whether in vivo treatment with DIDS exerted T1D
protective effects in NOD mice. Starting at 6, 8, or 10 wk of age,
female NOD mice received weekly i.p. injections of vehicle or
DIDS at 10 mg/kg (low-dose) or 50 mg/kg (high-dose; 6 and 8 wk
start only). Regardless of start time or dose, DIDS treatment exerted
strong T1D protective effects to 24 wk of age, at which time the
disease incidence in controls reached 90% (Fig. 7A–C).
The presence of IAAs is an important criterion that is used to
identify humans at high future risk for T1D for inclusion in possible
disease-intervention trials (13). Thus, just prior to treatment initiation,
serum was collected from mice depicted in Fig. 7A and retrospectively
typed for IAAs. Importantly, DIDS treatment prevented progression to
overt T1D when initiated in already IAA+ NOD mice (IAA+: vehicle
2/3, DIDS 0/9; IAA2: vehicle 6/7, DIDS 0/11) (Fig. 7D). Additionally,
NOD mice treated with DIDS from 8 wk of age had decreased levels
of insulitis compared with controls (Fig. 7E). These collective data
indicate that DIDS treatment inhibits progression to overt T1D, even
when initiated in NOD mice that had already developed high ongoing
levels of b cell autoimmunity marked by the presence of IAAs.
DIDS treatment alters B lymphocyte profiles in a manner
similar to that elicited by Aicda ablation
To initially investigate how the reagent may elicit T1D protection,
NOD mice treated with DIDS from 8 to 16 wk of age were evaluated
for phenotypic changes in B lymphocyte populations. As observed
following genetic ablation of AID, NOD mice treated with 50 mg/kg
DIDS from 8 to 16 wk of age were characterized by increased
numbers of total splenic and PLN B lymphocytes (Fig. 8A). Ad-
ditionally, similar to the case elicited by genetic ablation of AID,
DIDS treatment led to the expansion of splenic and PLN GC
B lymphocyte compartments (Fig. 8B). B lymphocytes were also
proportionally increased among islet-infiltrating lymphocytes
(Fig. 8C). Further phenocopying NOD.Aicda2/2 mice, the propor-
tions of splenic, PLN, and islet-resident CD73+ B lymphocytes with
potential immunosuppressive capacity were increased by DIDS
treatment (Fig. 8D). Furthermore, the DIDS-elicited increase in
islet CD73+ B lymphocytes occurred in the CD73+ CD39+ and
CD73+ CD392 subpopulations (Fig. 8E). Finally, islet-infiltrating
B lymphocytes had similar levels of CD69 but increased CD80
and PD-L2 expression (Fig. 8F). This was also similar to the ex-
pansion of B lymphocytes with a memory-like phenotype within the
islets of NOD.Aicda2/2 mice. Despite this observed expansion of
islet-infiltrating memory-like B lymphocytes in DIDS-treated mice,
flow cytometric analyses of bone marrow–resident B lymphocytes
revealed that, relative to vehicle-treated controls, DIDS treatment
led to a proportional decrease in recirculating mature (Hardy frac-
tion F) B lymphocytes (Fig. 8G, Supplemental Fig. 2F).
DIDS treatment effects on B lymphocytes indirectly suppress
diabetogenic T cell responses
DIDS treatment and genetic ablation of Aicda elicit similar phe-
notypic alterations in NOD B lymphocytes. Although not elicited
by Aicda ablation, we considered it important to determine
whether DIDS treatment directly affects the diabetogenic capacity
of NOD T cells. Total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were numerically
increased in the PLNs, but not spleens, of DIDS-treated mice
(Fig. 9A). As observed upon genetic ablation of AID, the proportions

 of Tfh cells were increased in the spleens and PLNs of DIDS-treated
NOD mice (Fig. 9B). The proportion of total T cells was decreased
among islet-infiltrating leukocytes (Fig. 9C) after DIDS treatment.
Additionally, there was a decrease in the proportion of the CD8+
subset among islet-infiltrating T cells (Fig. 9D). Islet CD4+ T cells
displayed
increased
CD69
expression
after
DIDS
treatment
(Fig. 9E). DIDS treatment did not significantly alter CD69 expres-
sion of islet CD8+ T cells, but it marginally increased IL-7Ra levels
(Fig. 9E). Finally, compared with vehicle-treated controls, in DIDS-
treated mice, islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells had a decreased naive
and increased central memory phenotype, whereas CD8+ T cells
had a decreased effector and an increased central memory pheno-
type (Fig. 9F). Together, these data indicate that DIDS treatment
reduces effector CD8+ T cells and drives the accumulation of
central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the islets of NOD
mice.
We next tested whether DIDS treatment had lasting effects on T cell
diabetogenic activity. Female NOD mice, treated once weekly with
vehicle or 50 mg/kg DIDS from 8 to 16 wk of age, then became donors
of purified splenic T cells that were transferred into NOD-scid recipients
that were subsequently monitored for T1D development. T cells from
DIDS-treated mice transferred T1D to NOD-scid recipients with sig-
nificantly less efficiency compared with those from control donors
(Fig. 9G). We envisioned two possible (nonexclusive) explanations for
this result: B lymphocytes in the DIDS-treated donors expand autore-
active T cell populations less efficiently than in vehicle-treated mice
and DIDS can act directly to suppress diabetogenic T cell activity.
To distinguish between the above possibilities, we tested the
direct effect of DIDS on the diabetogenic function of NOD T cells
in the absence of B lymphocytes. Purified splenic T cells from 5–6-
wk-old female NOD mice were transferred into NOD-scid recip-
ients. Starting 3 d posttransfer, the NOD-scid recipients began
weekly 50 mg/kg DIDS or vehicle treatment and were monitored
for T1D development. After engraftment with NOD T cells, NOD-
scid recipients treated with DIDS or vehicle developed T1D at an
equivalent rate (Fig. 9H). These results indicate that DIDS treat-
ment does not directly affect the diabetogenic activity of NOD
T cells. Thus, the diminished ability of T cells from DIDS-treated
NOD mice to adoptively transfer T1D cannot be attributed to a
direct reduction in their pathogenicity; rather, it is likely due to
DIDS limiting the ability of B lymphocytes to support the ex-
pansion of pathogenic effectors.
CD73+ B lymphocytes expanded by DIDS treatment suppress
diabetogenic T cell responses
We tested whether coinfusion of B lymphocytes from control or
DIDS-treated NOD mice differentially affected the ability of di-
abetogenic T cells to transfer disease to NOD-scid recipients. NOD
female mice were injected once weekly, from 8 to 16 wk of age,
with vehicle or 50 mg/kg DIDS. Purified splenic T cells from the
vehicle-treated mice were then cotransferred into NOD-scid re-
cipients with equal numbers of purified total B lymphocytes from
vehicle or DIDS-treated donors. As previously noted, similar to
the case of NOD.Aicda2/2 mice, DIDS treatment expands CD73+
B lymphocyte populations. Therefore, we also transferred T cells
from vehicle-treated controls with CD73-depleted B lymphocytes
from DIDS-treated mice. T1D development was significantly de-
creased in NOD-scid recipients of pathogenic T cells coinfused

 with total B lymphocytes from DIDS-treated donors compared
with vehicle-treated donors (Fig. 10A). However, depletion of the
CD73+ subset significantly enhanced the ability of B lymphocytes
from DIDS-treated donors to support T1D development in NOD-scid
recipients coinfused with pathogenic T cells (Fig. 10A). Hence,
similar to the case with genetic ablation of AID, DIDS treatment of
NOD mice induces a quantitative increase in CD73+ B lymphocytes
with a capacity to actively suppress T1D development (Fig. 10A).
Next, we tested whether the CD73+ population expanded by
DIDS treatment can directly suppress T cell responses. On a per-
cell basis, CD73+ B lymphocytes from vehicle- and DIDS-treated
mice equally suppressed T cell proliferation in response to anti-
CD3ε and anti-CD28 stimulation to a significantly greater extent
than did the CD732 subset in the presence of AMP (Fig. 10B).
This suppressive effect was diminished upon addition of APCP
(Fig. 10B, Supplemental Fig. 3B). Finally, we examined IL-10 pro-
duction by sorted CD73+ and CD732 B lymphocytes from vehicle-
and DIDS-treated mice. Surprisingly, CD73+ B lymphocytes from
DIDS-treated mice produced less IL-10 upon LPS stimulation than
did those from vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 10C). These results
indicate that pharmacological targeting of RAD51 activity inhibits
T1D development in NOD mice in a manner similar to that elicited
by Aicda ablation, including a quantitative increase in CD73+
regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs).
Discussion
We have demonstrated that disruption of the AID/RAD51 axis,
through genetic or pharmacological means, strongly inhibits T1D
development in NOD mice, and this protection is due, at least in
part, to the expansion of specific CD73+ B lymphocyte populations
with capacities to regulate pathogenic T cell responses. Addi-
tionally, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that,
although CSR and SHM processes are important B lymphocyte–
intrinsic processes in T1D pathogenesis, their absence does not
diminish autoreactive T cell development. Although purified T cells
from NOD.Aicda2/2 mice are effective at adoptively transferring
T1D to NOD-scid recipients, inhibiting CSR and SHM processes
leads to an expansion of Bregs controlling these effectors. These
findings reveal an unexpected link between blocking AID/RAD51-
dependent affinity-maturation processes and Breg development.
Thus, disruption of the AID/RAD51 axis may represent a previ-
ously unrealized means of in vivo Breg expansion.

 Ablation of AID and DIDS targeting of RAD51 results in ac-
cumulation of CD73+ B lymphocytes capable of suppressing T cells,
at least in part through the production of adenosine (Figs. 5C, 10B).
Previous studies demonstrated that adenosine signaling via A2aR
inhibits CD8+ T cell downregulation of IL-7Ra, preventing the
differentiation of memory T cells to effectors (50). Therefore, the
shift in islet-infiltrating CD8+ T cell populations in DIDS-treated
NOD mice from an effector to a central memory phenotype
(Fig. 9F), paired with increased IL-7Ra expression (Fig. 9E),
further supports the conclusion that, in this system, diabetogenic
T cells are suppressed through an adenosine-mediated mecha-
nism. Therefore, although not precluding the possibility of other
nonoverlapping adenosine-independent suppression pathways,
the population of CD73+ B lymphocytes expanded in AID-
deficient or DIDS-treated NOD mice appears to largely inhibit
diabetogenic T cell responses through a mechanism that is de-
pendent on activity of this ectoenzyme.
It should also be noted that, although CD73-depleted B lymphocytes
from DIDS-treated mice could support the ability of coinfused
pathogenic T cells to transfer T1D to NOD-scid recipients, they
did so less efficiently than total B lymphocytes from vehicle-
treated control donors. This could indicate that, in addition to
expanding CD73+ Bregs, DIDS treatment diminishes the ability of
other B lymphocyte populations in NOD mice to support dia-
betogenic T cell activity. This could include DIDS treatment
supporting the expansion of CD732 Bregs capable of suppressing
T cells through adenosine-independent mechanisms. Should
this be the case, the mechanism by which such CD732 Bregs
mediate suppression is likely to be IL-10 independent, because
this population produces little of the cytokine in response to
stimulation.
It is unknown why CD73+ B lymphocytes from DIDS-treated
mice produce less LPS-induced IL-10 than do those from controls.
IL-10 secretion has been recognized as a major means of Breg-
mediated immune suppression (51). However, there have also
been reports of Bregs capable of suppressing systemic lupus
erythematosus and experimental autoimmune encephalomyeli-
tis development through IL-10–independent mechanisms (52).
IL-10 production by B lymphocytes requires strong stimulation,
whereas adenosine generation by CD73+ B lymphocytes is con-
stitutive, providing that its substrate is present (46). The ability of
B lymphocytes from DIDS-treated NOD mice to inhibit diabeto-
genic T cell responses (Fig. 10A, 10B), despite decreased IL-10
production (Fig. 10C), supports the conclusion that such disease-
protective effects are largely the result of CD73-mediated aden-
osine production. This observation is consistent with a report
suggesting that Breg-mediated adenosine production may play a
more important role in immunosuppression than IL-10 secretion
(46). Additionally, it should be noted that IL-102/2 B lymphocytes
have reduced CD73 expression, suggesting that this cytokine likely
directly regulates CD73 expression by B lymphocytes (46). There-
fore, DIDS treatment of mice made genetically deficient in IL-10
expression or treated with an Ab blocking this cytokine would not
discriminate between the regulatory contributions of CD73-mediated
adenosine production and direct action by IL-10. The future creation
of B lymphocyte–specific CD732/2 NOD mice will help to uncouple
the individual regulatory contributions provided by adenosine
generation and IL-10 secretion.
This study has focused on the role of the AID/RAD51 axis in GC
affinity-maturation processes contributing to T1D. However, the
AID pathway has been shown to play an important role in
B lymphocytes outside of the splenic or lymph node GC envi-
ronment. For example, AID has been implicated in the central
tolerance of B lymphocytes in C57BL/6 and BALB/c background
strains (53). Another study demonstrated a role for AID in central
and peripheral tolerance of human B lymphocytes (54). However,
discerning the contribution of AID to these processes in NOD
mice is complicated by strain-specific defects in B lymphocyte
central tolerance (55). Therefore, the effect of targeting AID/
RAD51 on B lymphocyte central tolerance in NOD is unclear
and warrants further investigation. Additionally, manipulation of

 AID affects gut-associated B lymphocytes and alters intestinal
microflora (56). Gut microflora alterations can drastically impact
T1D development (57). Thus, examining the impact of disrupting
the AID/RAD51 axis on GALT homeostasis is warranted. Addi-
tionally, disruption of the AID/RAD51 axis could conceivably
result in a decreased ability to clear infection. Due to institutional
policy, we cannot infect mice with microbes at The Jackson Labo-
ratory. Therefore, the possible effects of targeting the AID/RAD51
axis on the ability to clear pathogens will need to be the subject of
other investigators’ research. Additionally, agents that might spe-
cifically increase CD73+ Bregs without impacting the AID/RAD51
axis should be investigated.
A previous rituximab-mediated pan–B lymphocyte–targeting
clinical trial did not permanently halt b cell demise (17). Studies
in NOD mice indicate that this may be due, at least in part, to
downregulation of cell surface CD20 expression by islet-infiltrating
B lymphocytes (18). This provides a likely explanation for why
anti-CD20 immunotherapy only protects NOD mice from T1D if
initiated prior to IAA development. Other studies have provided
evidence that Breg expansion has a potential to confer strong T1D
inhibitory effects, and pan-B lymphocyte–depletion regimens could
deplete these protective populations (58). Our results provide the
first indication, to our knowledge, that future clinically applicable
pharmaceutical agents targeting the AID/RAD51 axis could convert
some B lymphocytes to a T1D-protective CD73+ regulatory phe-
notype. Furthermore, because this immunomodulatory therapy
retains efficacy, even when initiated at a late prodromal autoantibody-
positive stage of T1D development, it also represents a significant
improvement upon previous B lymphocyte–targeted disease-
intervention strategies.
In summary, these studies show that the genetic or pharmacologic
blockade of B lymphocyte affinity-maturation processes in NOD
mice drives diversion to a CD73+ regulatory phenotype capable of
inhibiting autoimmune T1D development. Therefore, pharmaco-
logical targeting of RAD51 to block diabetogenic B lymphocyte
activity, either directly or by converting them to an immunoregu-
latory state, might ultimately represent a clinically translatable
disease-intervention approach. Because RAD51 is a multiprotein
complex, this area of the AID pathway has other potential targets
that might be exploited. The identification and use of pharmaco-
logical agents that potentially directly block AID activity as a novel
T1D-intervention approach should also be explored. These studies
also indicate that further research into the role of the purinergic
immunoregulatory pathway in T1D pathogenesis is warranted.
Furthermore, this pathway could also represent a potentially clini-
cally relevant immunomodulatory target for the treatment of various
other autoimmune diseases, either through increasing adenosine pro-
duction or through administration of A2aR agonists. Together, these
initial studies reveal that therapeutic targeting of the AID/RAD51 axis
in B lymphocytes is a previously unrealized area of research for T1D
therapy development.
