Introduction
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world (1). It is a group of heterogeneous 
diseases characterized by neuroretinal degeneration associated with death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), 
which in turn leads to optic neuropathy. In glaucoma, progressive optic neuropathy, if left untreated, leads 
to visual field (VF) defects that may ultimately result in irreversible blindness.
Numerous factors — including genetics and race, as well as ocular characteristics such as intraocular 
pressure (IOP) and central corneal thickness — have been identified as risk factors in the development and 
progression of glaucoma (2). Currently, all medical and surgical therapies for glaucoma focus on lowering 
IOP as a strategy to protect RGCs from cell death. Although neuroprotection for glaucoma would be high-
ly desirable, therapeutic strategies that have focused on neuroprotection have thus far failed to demonstrate 
efficacy in clinical trials, with no agents currently approved by regulatory authorities (3).
Another impediment for effective glaucoma treatment is the paucity of molecular markers that predict 
progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration that results in optic neuropathy (4). Treating physicians 
have generally relied on VF testing, IOP measurement, and optic nerve monitoring as metrics for assessing 
whether disease is adequately controlled (5). However, the nature of VF testing, lack of precise correlation 
of IOP with disease risk, and lack of validated normative databases for optic nerve imaging techniques, 
such as optical coherent tomography (OCT), contribute to the persistent challenges of glaucoma manage-
ment. Of significant concern, these evaluations presently form the basis for treatment decisions regarding 
additional medical and surgical interventions to prevent disease progression and vision loss (6). Therefore, 
there is an acute need to identify specific molecular markers that quantify glaucomatous neurodegeneration 
by accurately and objectively measuring RGC-specific cell death.
In this study, we have, to our knowledge, characterized in mice and rats a novel molecular marker of 
glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We have further validated our findings in human glaucoma patients 
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Physicians often use surrogate 
endpoints to monitor the progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. These approaches are 
limited in their ability to quantify disease severity and progression due to inherent subjectivity, 
unreliability, and limitations of normative databases. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify 
specific molecular markers that predict or measure glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Here, we 
demonstrate that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is associated with retinal ganglion cell 
death. Gdf15 expression in the retina is specifically increased after acute injury to retinal ganglion 
cell axons and in a murine chronic glaucoma model. We also demonstrate that the ganglion cell 
layer may be one of the sources of secreted GDF15 and that GDF15 diffuses to and can be detected 
in aqueous humor (AH). In validating these findings in human patients with glaucoma, we find not 
only that GDF15 is increased in AH of patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), but also 
that elevated GDF15 levels are significantly associated with worse functional outcomes in glaucoma 
patients, as measured by visual field testing. Thus, GDF15 maybe a reliable metric of glaucomatous 
neurodegeneration, although further prospective validation studies will be necessary to determine 
if GDF15 can be used in clinical practice.

with varying degrees of disease severity. These results highlight a protein with potential use as a marker of 
glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
Results
Gdf15 expression is selectively increased in the retina following RGC axonal injury. Our goal was to identify specific 
markers of RGC death that could potentially be used to accurately and reliably predict or measure glauco-
matous neurodegeneration. Given the strong association between neuroinflammation and glaucomatous 
optic neuropathy (7), we performed a retinal cytokine/growth factor–focused PCR array consisting of 88 
genes (ILs, TNF and TGF superfamilies, growth factors, interferons, chemokines, and others) to identify 
factors whose expression correlates specifically with RGC death. In order to identify factors unique to 
RGC death, we used 3 different murine models of disease: optic nerve crush (ONC) as a model of axonal 
injury and RGC-specific death as seen in glaucoma, light-induced retinal degeneration (RD) as a model of 
photoreceptor-specific cell death, and endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) as a model of ocular inflammation 
(8–10). By comparing the retinal gene expression profiles associated with these 3 murine models of disease 
and focusing specifically on factors that are uniquely identified in the ONC model but not the RD and EIU 
models, we could identify the factors that were uniquely associated with RGC death.
The results from the retinal cytokine/growth factor–focused array revealed that growth differentiation 
factor-15 (Gdf15), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, was the only gene 
that was significantly altered in retinas 24 hours after ONC but not after RD and EIU (Figure 1, A–C, 
Table 1, and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.
org/10.1172/jci.insight.91455DS1). We also examined Gdf15 gene expression in the retina at time points 
later than 24 hours in all 3 disease models. The results showed that there was no significant increase of 
Gdf15 in the retina of both EIU and RD models (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C), while Gdf15 expression 
in ONC model retina was significantly increased even at 72 hours (Supplemental Figure 1A).
We also examined Tgfb2 gene expression in the retina because of its previously described association 
with human primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) (11–13) and because GDF15 is a member of the TGF-β 
superfamily (14). In terms of rodent models of glaucoma, no rodent glaucoma model has convincingly 
demonstrated elevated Tgfb2 gene expression in the retina. However, given the reported associations with 
human POAG, it was important to examine the specificity of Gdf15 by using Tgfb2 as a control. The result 
showed that the expression of Tgfb2 in the retina was unchanged in all 3 disease models 24 hours after each 
treatment (Figure 1D). Of interest, expression of other growth differentiation factor family members were 
unchanged in the retina 24 hours after ONC (Figure 1E).
To determine whether these changes in Gdf15 gene expression after ONC led to differences in protein 
secretion, we analyzed GDF15 protein level in aqueous humor (AH) of eyes after ONC. ELISA measure-
ments showed that GDF15 levels in AH were significantly increased 24 hours after ONC (Figure 1F). 
These results suggest that GDF15 may be a specific molecular marker of RGC death following axonal 
injury to the optic nerve.
GDF15 protein level in AH is not affected by aging. The incidence of glaucoma increases exponentially 
with aging (15). Therefore, an effective molecular marker of glaucomatous neurodegeneration must 
be able to discriminate between physiologic aging and the transition to age-associated eye diseases 
such as glaucoma. To determine whether Gdf15 expression changes with age, we examined the retina 
and AH of young (6-week-old) and old (18-month-old) mice for Gdf15 gene expression and GDF15 
protein levels, respectively. We found no difference between young and old mice in the expression of 
Gdf15 (Figure 2A) and Tgfb2 (Figure 2B) in the retina. In addition, GDF15 protein levels in AH were 
also unaffected by aging (Figure 2C). These results suggest that GDF15 may be able to discriminate 
between aging and glaucomatous neurodegeneration and may, therefore, be useful as a molecular 
marker of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
Gdf15 expression was increased only in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) following axonal injury to the optic nerve. 
To localize Gdf15 expression in the eye, we performed in situ hybridization. The results showed that Gdf15 
was minimally expressed at baseline in the retina (Figure 3A), cornea (Supplemental Figure 2A), lens (Sup-
plemental Figure 2B), and ciliary processes (Supplemental Figure 2C). In the retina, Gdf15 expression was 
present in the GCL, the inner nuclear layer (INL), and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (Figure 3A).
Given these numerous potential sources of secreted GDF15, we sought to determine the cellular source 
of increased GDF15 in AH following axonal injury to the optic nerve. In order to do so, we analyzed

different tissue compartments within the ONC eyes. We analyzed the anterior segment (AS) of the eye 
(including cornea, trabecular meshwork, iris, ciliary body, and ciliary processes), lens, and retina. Increased 
Gdf15 expression was observed only in the retina 24 hours after ONC (Figure 3, B and C), with no change 
in Gdf15 expression in the AS and lens (Figure 3, B and C, and Supplemental Figure 3, A–C).
To determine which cells within the retina were the sources of increased Gdf15 expression, we per-
formed in situ hybridization of Gdf15 in the retina 24 hours after ONC. The results showed that expression 
of Gdf15 was increased in GCL, but not in INL and ONL (Figure 3, D–G). To obtain more accurate 
quantification of Gdf15 expression in specific retinal layers, we performed laser microdissection (LMD), 
separating the retina into GCL, INL, and ONL. As predicted, only the GCL — but not the INL and ONL 
— showed increased Gdf15 expression 24 hours after ONC (Figure 3H). These results indicate that GCL 
may be one of the sources of the increased GDF15 secretion after axonal injury to the optic nerve.

Although we found that GCL may be the source of the increased GDF15 in AH after axonal injury to 
the optic nerve, it has previously been reported that Gdf15 is also upregulated in macrophages in response to 
a variety of stimuli, including IL1B, TNFA, IL2, and TGFB (16). As some of these cytokines/growth fac-
tors were also found to be upregulated in eyes after ONC (Table 1), it remained possible that macrophages 
infiltrating into the retina and localizing to the GCL were the source of the secreted GDF15. To quantify 
the extent of macrophage infiltration into the retinas after ONC, we analyzed retinal F4/80 expression as a 
measure of macrophage infiltration. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, as well as IHC, demonstrated that 
there was no significant change in F4/80 expression or macrophage infiltration into the retina after ONC 
compared with controls (Figure 3, I and J, and Supplemental Figure 4). These results validated that mac-
rophages were not the major sources of secreted GDF15 in AH following axonal injury to the optic nerve.
To confirm the generalizability of these results, we also measured GDF15 level in rat AH after ONC. 
Similar to the results obtained in mice, we found a significant increase in the expression of Gdf15 after

ONC (Figure 4A) in the retina, while 
Tgfb2 expression in the retina remained 
unchanged (Figure 4B). In addition, ELI-
SA confirmed a significant increase in 
GDF15 protein levels in AH after ONC 
(Figure 4C).
GDF15 level in AH is elevated in a murine 
chronic glaucoma model. ONC causes acute 
axonal injury of RGCs, while axonal inju-
ry of RGCs in a majority of human glauco-
ma is chronic. As such, we were interested 
in validating our findings in an established 
model of chronic glaucoma.
We chose DBA/2J mouse strain as 
a model of chronic glaucoma. DBA/2J 
mouse strain is considered to be a model of 
chronic, pigmentary glaucoma that is char-
acterized by pigment liberation throughout 
the AS (17–19). Iris pigment dispersion and subsequent iris stromal atrophy in DBA/2J mice are caused 
by mutations in the Gpnmb and Tyrp1 genes, respectively (18, 20). Pigment dispersion becomes evident at 
5–6 months, and IOP elevation can be detected in most DBA/2J mice by the age of 9 months (17). These 
changes were followed by the death of RGCs, optic nerve atrophy, and optic nerve cupping (17). Thus, 
DBA/2J mouse strain is widely used to evaluate mechanisms of pressure-related chronic ganglion cell 
death and optic nerve atrophy. We used 1-year-old DBA/2J mice as a model for chronic glaucoma and 
compared them to 3-month-old DBA/2J mice with normal IOP as controls.
As predicted, IOP was significantly elevated in the glaucoma group (1-year-old DBA/2J mice) com-
pared with control group (3-month-old DBA/2J mice) (Figure 5A). We also confirmed a significant 
decrease of RGC counts in the glaucoma group (Supplemental Figure 5, A and B). As seen in the ONC 
model, we found a significant increase in the expression of Gdf15 (Figure 5B) in the retina of mice with 
glaucoma compared with control mice, while there was no difference in retinal Tgfb2 expression (Figure 
5C). In addition, ELISA confirmed a significant increase in GDF15 protein levels in AH of mice with 
glaucoma when compared with control mice (Figure 5D).
These findings suggest that the increase in GDF15 protein level in AH after axonal injury to the optic 
nerve is potentially generalizable to mouse glaucoma and further strengthens the possibility that it may 
represent a valuable molecular marker of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
GDF15 levels in AH of  POAG patients are significantly associated with mean deviation measured by VF test-
ing. To determine how well GDF15 can quantify the glaucomatous neurodegeneration, we analyzed 
the GDF15 protein levels in AH of patients with POAG and controls without glaucoma. As described 
in the Methods, POAG patients were classified into 3 groups with increasing severity of disease using 
Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson (HPA) criteria (21). Demographic data for POAG patients and controls without 
glaucoma are shown in Table 2. There were no significant differences in age (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 
6), sex, diabetic status, and race (Table 2) between the different groups (control and POAG stage 1, stage 2, 
and stage 3). AH was collected prior to surgical intervention as described in the Methods. Consistent with 
the results of animal experiments, POAG patients had significantly higher levels of GDF15 (median, 63.4 
pg/ml; mean, 131.3 pg/ml) in their AH compared with controls (median, 2.0 pg/ml; mean, 2.7 pg/ml) 
(Figure 6A). In addition, GDF15 levels were not only higher in AH of POAG patients, but also demon-
strated trends of increased levels with increasing severity of disease (Figure 6, B–E). Importantly, among 
all POAG patients, GDF15 levels did not differ by sex (Figure 6F), diabetic status (Figure 6G), and race 
(Figure 6H) and were not correlated with age (Figure 6I) and average IOP (Figure 6J). Furthermore, there 
were no significant differences in topical glaucoma medications prescribed for POAG patients in various 
categories (Supplemental Figure 7A) or the type of surgery performed for POAG patients at the time of 
sample collection (Supplemental Figure 7B).
Since TGFB2 has been reported to be increased in AH of POAG patients, we also measured 
TGFB2 protein level in AH of the same POAG patients and controls. As predicted, TGFB2 levels

were increased in AH of POAG patients compared with controls (Figure 7A). However, in contrast to 
GDF15, there were no significant differences in TGFB2 among different disease severity groups (Figure 
7B). Among all POAG patients, although TGFB2 levels showed a significant difference by sex (Supple-
mental Figure 8A), they did not differ by diabetic status (Supplemental Figure 8B) and race (Supple-
mental Figure 8C), and they were not correlated with age (Supplemental Figure 8D) and average IOP

Furthermore, to investigate if GDF15 
and TGFB2 levels in AH were progressively 
increased with increasing severity of disease or 
not, we generated a multivariable linear regres-
sion model (Figure 8). This model was adjusted 
for diabetic status (dichotomized as yes or no), 
IOP (averaged over last 3 visits), age (continuous 
variable), and race (dichotomized as European 
descent or African American). After controlling 
for these covariates, log-transformed GDF15 
level was a significant predictor of worse mean 
deviation (β-coefficient = –2.0, 95% CI: –3.7 to 
–0.2; t = –2.3, P = 0.027), suggesting that a one 
log-unit increase in GDF15 levels is associated 
with a ~2.0 decrease in mean deviation. Nota-
bly, log-transformed TGFB2 levels were not a 
significant predictor of mean deviation (β-coef-
ficient = –0.3, 95% CI: –8.0 to –7.5, t = –0.1, P = 0.945). The final model had an R2 = 0.384, indicating 
good explanatory power. Overall, these results suggest that elevated GDF15 levels are significantly 
associated with worse functional outcomes in glaucoma patients, as measured by VF testing.
Discussion
In this study, we were interested in identifying a specific molecular marker that accurately predicted pro-
gression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that a protein secreted by the retina may 
specifically correlate with RGC death and may, thus, be a useful molecular marker that predicts progression 
of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Based on this hypothesis, we performed retinal cytokine/growth fac-
tor–focused PCR array to identify factors that were associated specifically with RGC death. Our array results 
showed that GDF15 may be a novel and unique molecular marker of RGC death in glaucoma, as it was not 
elevated in models of ocular inflammation (EIU) or outer retinal photoreceptor degeneration (RD).
GDF15 is a member of TGF-β superfamily (16). GDF15 is expressed in both the CNS and the periph-
eral nervous system (PNS) (22). Although the precise biological function of GDF15 in the nervous system, 
including the retina, remain poorly understood, previous literature demonstrated its neurotrophic or neuro-
protective effect in CNS (22) and PNS (23, 24). In addition, GDF15 has previously been demonstrated to

be upregulated in the retina after axonal injury to the optic nerve (25). However, the magnitude and time 
course of RGC death after axonal injury was not different in mice that are genetically deficient in GDF15 
compared with littermate controls, which suggests that it did not influence the temporal progression of 
RGC death (25). Of interest, it has also been reported that GDF15 provides independent prognostic infor-
mation on cardiovascular events beyond previously identified cardiovascular risk factors and other markers 
of chronic and acute coronary disease (26, 27).
In addition to the increase of Gdf15 expression in the retina after axonal injury to the optic nerve, we 
detected increased Gdf15 expression only in GCL of the retina, although other parts of the eye do indeed 
express low levels of Gdf15 at baseline. In both mouse and rat models, GDF15 levels in AH increased after 
acute axonal injury to the optic nerve. The source of this secreted GDF15 may be the GCL, since GCL 
was the only cell population in the eye to exhibit increased gene expression after ONC. We also showed 
increased Gdf15 expression in the retina and increased GDF15 levels in AH of DBA/2J mice, a well-char-
acterized murine chronic glaucoma model (17–19). Based on these results, we concluded that GDF15 
secreted in to the AH by GCL may be a quantifiable measure of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
We did not find an increase in retinal Tgfb2 gene expression in the ONC model or the murine chronic 
glaucoma model. As described in the results section, many studies have reported an association between 
TGFB2 in AH and POAG in humans. However, the main source of TGFB2 in AH is either the epithelial 
layer of the ciliary body (28) or the lens (29). Previous studies have shown that TGFB2 affected the trabecu-
lar meshwork, which is an important tissue for draining AH and maintaining normal IOP (30). As complex 
changes in the trabecular meshwork gradually affect its ability to drain AH from the anterior chamber, it 
can lead to elevated IOP. As such, increased TGFB2 in AH of POAG patients is not caused by the stress or 
damage of retinal cells induced by high IOP, and although animal models replicate some features of human 
POAG, they do not reproduce each facet of human glaucoma. This may be a reason TGFB2 protein levels 
are high in AH of POAG patients but not in the retinas after ONC or in the murine chronic glaucoma model.
We validated these findings in a well-characterized cohort of human patients either without glaucoma 
or with POAG. We classified POAG patients to 3 different severity groups (stage 1, 2, and 3) according to 
HPA criteria. As described above, we sought to identify specific markers that accurately predict progres-
sion of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. However, due to the limitation of the study design (retrospective 
cross-sectional study), we could not have appropriate dependent variables for glaucoma progression. There-
fore, we had to use glaucoma severity as a surrogate-dependent variable for glaucoma progression in this 
study. Our multivariable linear regression model proved that GDF15 levels in AH of POAG patients, but 
not TGFB2, are significantly associated with glaucoma severity. These findings render GDF15 an attractive 
molecular marker of glaucomatous neurodegeneration, although further prospective study is needed in the 
future because glaucoma severity is no more than a surrogate-dependent variable for glaucoma progression; 
thus, we could not prove a direct relationship between GDF15 and glaucoma progression in this study.
We acknowledge that there are several limitations in this study. First, animal models we used in 
this study do not exactly reflect usual biological process of human glaucoma. The ONC model is an 
acute axonal injury model, whereas the majority of human glaucoma have chronic features. Although 
DBA/2J mouse strain is a model of chronic glaucoma, it is considered as pigmentary glaucoma model,

in which DCs are known to phagocytose pigment granules in the AS of DBA/2J mice (19). Thus, when 
we analyze the AH of DBA/2J mice, we have to consider confounding features, including the effect of 
phagocytic DCs in the AS and inflammation in this model of glaucoma. Second, our human study might 
have selection bias. This study included stage 1 to stage 3 POAG patients classified by HPA criteria as 
described in the Methods section, but not stage 4 and stage 5 POAG patients that have severe or end-stage 
VF defect, since there was no surgical case in these categories during the study period. With this limita-
tion of study design, it could be possible that GDF15 levels are low in stable but severe glaucoma patients 
that are not signed up for surgeries; this leads to different conclusion about the correlation between 
GDF15 and glaucoma severity. Third, although our multivariable linear regression model statistically 
proved that GDF15 levels in AH of POAG patients are significantly associated with glaucoma severity, 
GDF15 failed to detect glaucoma in some cases at all stages of the disease. As discussed above, due to 
the limitation of the study design, we had to use glaucoma severity as a surrogate-dependent variable 
for glaucoma progression in this study. However, based on our results of animal experiments, GDF15 in 
AH has strong potential to be associated with RGC death in the retina or glaucoma progression. Thus, 
future prospective validation studies will be necessary to determine if GDF15 in AH is associated with 
glaucoma progression and whether the measurement of GDF15 in AH can be used in clinical practice.
In conclusion, our data suggest that measurement of 
GDF15 in AH might give us quantitative information about 
glaucomatous neurodegeneration. In addition to conven-
tional IOP measurements, VF test, and disc appearance, 
this information may enhance current treatment algorithms 
for glaucoma. Further prospective validation studies will be 
necessary to determine if GDF15 in AH is correlated with 
glaucoma progression and can be used in clinical practice.
Methods
Animals. All mice (The Jackson Laboratory) and rats 
(Charles Rivers Laboratories) were housed in a tempera-
ture-controlled room under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with 
free access to food and water. Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice 
were used for ONC and EIU experiments. Six-week-old 
129S1/SvImJ mice were used for RD experiment. Six-week-
old and 18-month-old C57BL/6J mice were used for young

Figure 8. GDF15 level in aqueous humor (AH) of primary open angle glaucoma 
(POAG) patients, but not TGFB2, is a significant predictor of worse mean devi-
ation measured by visual field (VF) testing. The results of multivariable linear 
regression model showed log-transformed GDF15 levels (β = –2.0, 95% CI: –3.7 to 
–0.2, t = –2.3, P = 0.027) but not log-transformed TGFB2 levels (β = –0.3, 95% CI: 
–8.0 to 7.5, t = –0.1, P = 0.945) predict worse mean deviations on VF testing after 
controlling for age, race, intraocular pressure (IOP), and diabetic status.

and old mice comparison. Three-month-old and 1-year-old DBA/2J mice were used as a chronic glaucoma 
model and its control. Eight-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were used for rat ONC experiment.
ONC model for mice. We performed ONC in mice as previously described to examine the effect of axonal 
injury on RGC survival (8). Briefly, we anesthetized 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice with an i.p. injection of 
anesthetic cocktail (86.9 mg/kg ketamine and 13.4 mg/kg xylazine diluted in PBS). After ensuring ade-
quate anesthesia, we incised the nasal/ventral conjunctiva and pulled away connective tissue using forceps. 
Then, we pinched and held the optic nerve for 10 seconds using the Dumont #N7 self-closing curved 
forceps (Fine Science Tools) 1–2 mm behind the bulbus. The left eye of each mouse served as the sham sur-
gery control: conjunctiva of the left eye was incised without an ONC. After euthanasia by CO2 inhalation 
at various time points following ONC, we collected eye tissues (retinas, ASs, and lens) for further analyses. 
Eyes that demonstrated significant hemorrhage during the procedure were excluded from further analysis.
ONC model for rats. We performed ONC in rats to induce axonal injury to RGC as previous-
ly described (31). Briefly, 8-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (Henry 
Schein) in oxygen (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance respectively, 2 l/min). The conjunctiva 
was dissected away from the orbit using spring scissors. The left optic nerve was then exposed and 
crushed for 10 seconds using Dumont #5 forceps (Fine Science Tools). The conjunctiva of the right 
eye served as the sham surgery control and was incised; the optic nerve was exposed, but no injury was 
performed. Rats were sacrificed at various time points after the crush by CO2 inhalation, and the retinas 
were harvested for downstream analyses. The eyes with intravitreal inflammation or severe hemorrhage 
were excluded from the study.
Light-induced RD model. Light exposure to induce RD was performed as previously described (9). Briefly, 
6-week-old 129S1/SvImJ mice were dark adapted overnight. Pupils were dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine 
hydrochloride (Akorn), and the mice were exposed to 13,000 lux of white light for 1 hour. The mice were 
then returned to normal light/dark cycle and sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at various time points after light 
exposure in order to harvest the retinas for analyses. We used 129S1/SvImJ mice for the RD model because 
C57BL/6J mouse strain is resistant against light-induced RD due to the gene mutation of RPE65 gene (32).
EIU model. The EIU model was performed as described previously (10). Briefly, 6-week-old 
C57BL/6J mice received a single i.p. injection of 6.0 mg/kg body weight lipopolysaccharide from E. 
coli (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS. Control mice were injected with PBS alone. Mice were sacrificed by 
CO2 inhalation at various time points after EIU induction, and the retinas were harvested for analyses.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from eye tissues with TRIzol reagent 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. For the samples collected by LMD, 
total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. To synthesize cDNA, total RNA was added to the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription 
Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reverse-transcribed according to manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR 
was performed with duplicate using the StepOnePlus Real Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
using TaqMan Real-Time PCR Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the mRNA was quantified using 
the ΔΔCT method with Actb or Gapdh as the internal control. The primers used in this study are shown 
in Supplemental Table 2.
PCR array. Cytokine/growth factor–focused PCR array was performed with duplicate using 96-well 
Taqman Gene Expression Array plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions 
with Actb as the internal control. The primers used in this cytokine/growth factor–focused PCR array are 
shown in Supplemental Table 3.
LMD. Laser-capture microdissection was performed as described previously (33). Briefly, eyeballs were 
embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and immediately flash frozen on dry ice. Cryo blocks were 
cut into 10-μm sections and placed on membrane slides (Leica). The slides were kept on dry ice and then 
fixed with 100% ethanol following Hematoxylin staining. LMD was performed using Leica LMD6000 
LMD system (Leica). The GCL, INL, and ONL were separately collected.
In situ hybridization. To detect Gdf15 mRNA expression in the eye, we performed in situ hybridization 
using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, eyes from 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin 
for 24 hours and then embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded samples were then cut into 4-μm slices 
on glass slides. In addition to the Gdf15 probe (catalog 318521), the Dapb probe (catalog 301143) was used 
as a negative control. Hematoxylin was used as a counter stain.

IHC. Eyeballs were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and immediately flash frozen on 
dry ice. Cryo blocks were cut into 10-μm sections and placed on superfrost plus microscope slides (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). Slides were postfixed for 15 minutes in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (catalog 305-510; 
Protocol), washed in 4 changes of PBS and blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. 
Anti–mouse F4/80 primary antibody (catalog 14-4801-82; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied overnight 
using a dilution of 1:200 in blocking solution.  Following 3 washes of PBS for 3 minutes each, Alexa 546–
conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied to the slides at 1:500 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS 3 times for 3 minutes each and mounted 
using SlowFade Gold with Dapi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All incubations were performed in a humidi-
fied chamber. Images were obtained on a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51).
ELISA. GDF15 in mouse and rat AH was measured using Quantikine Mouse/Rat GDF15 ELISA 
Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GDF15 in human AH was measured by 
using human GDF15 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Human GDF15 levels below the limit of detection of 4 pg/ml were replaced by a nonzero value (i.e., 1, 2, 
or 3 pg/ml), using a random integer generator (www.random.org). To measure TGFB2 in human AH, we 
used Quantikine ELISA Human TGFB2 (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 
1/5 volume of 1 N HCl was added to the samples and incubated 10 minutes at room temperature. After the 
incubation, 1/5 volume of 1.2 N NaOH/HEPES was added, and total TGFB2 was measured immediately.
Collection of  the AH from mice and rats. AH was collected from enucleated eyes using syringe with a 
34-gauge needle (Hamilton). A total of 2–3 μl of AH was collected from each mouse, and 2–3 samples were 
pooled for ELISA. A total of 10–15 μl of AH was collected from each rat, and individual samples were 
measured by ELISA.
IOP measurement of  mice. To measure IOP of the mice, we used TONOLAB (Colonial Medical Supply) 
following manufacturer’s instructions after anesthetizing the mice with an i.p. injection of anesthetic cock-
tail (86.9 mg/kg ketamine and 13.4 mg/kg xylazine diluted in PBS).
Immunostaining of  RGCs. We used RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) as a selec-
tive marker of mice RGCs (34). The eyes were enucleated, and the posterior segments were immediately 
dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour. After being washed with PBS, the sam-
ples were blocked with 1% Triton and 5% BSA in PBS for 2 hours and then incubated with rabbit poly-
clonal antibody against RBPMS (1:200, catalog ab194213, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Binding of primary 
antibody was localized with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500, Thermo Fish-
er Scientific). Finally, retinas were removed and mounted with mounting medium (ProLong Diamond 
Antifade Mountant, Invitrogen), and they were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). 
RGC density was determined as previously described with slight modification (35). Briefly, 4 standard 
areas (0.58 × 0.43 mm) of each whole-mounted retina at the point of 0.2 mm from the optic disc were 
randomly chosen, the labeled cells were counted, and the average number of RGCs/mm2 was calculated 
and used for the further analysis.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for human AH analysis. AH was collected from the patients undergoing 
cataract and/or glaucoma surgery from December 2007 to November 2015. We selected POAG patients 
without history of past pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and ischemic diabetic retinopathy (DR). Patients with-
out glaucoma, past PPV
, and ischemic DR undergoing cataract surgery were selected as controls. Patients 
with Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy (2 cases), congenital cataract (1 case), retinal detachment (1 case), and high 
myopia > 31 mm axial length (1 case) were excluded.
Collection of  the AH from human patients. Prior to the planned surgical procedure, a peripheral corneal 
paracentesis was performed with a 15-degree blade near the limbus for entry into the anterior chamber. Via 
a 30-gauge blunt cannula introduced on a 1-ml tuberculin syringe, 50–100 μl of AH was withdrawn and 
immediately placed into a receptacle of dry ice and then transferred to a liquid nitrogen tank for storage at 
–70oC until further analysis.
Classification of  glaucoma patients. HPA criteria were used to classify glaucoma patients (20). In this 
study, all POAG patients were classified into stage 1 to stage 3 based on HPA criteria.
Statistics. All statistical tests except for Fisher’s exact test were performed using GraphPad prism 6. 
Fisher’s exact test was performed by R-3.3.1. For the data that are normally distributed, values represent 
mean ± SD. For the data that are not normally distributed, values represent median with interquartile 
range. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check if the data is normally distributed. For the data that are 
normally distributed, 2-tailed unpaired t test was used to compare 2 groups, and one-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Tukey’s HSD test for post-hoc analysis was used to compare 3 groups or more. For the data that 
are not normally distributed, Mann Whitney U test was used to compare 2 samples, and Kruskal-Wallis 
test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test for post-hoc analysis were used to compare 3 and more 
samples. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between 2 groups. The χ2 test 
was used to compare the proportion of sex, diabetic status, and race in each group. Fisher’s exact test 
was used to compare the proportion of type of surgery for POAG patients. To determine the relationship 
between GDF15 and TGFB2 levels in AH and the extent of neurodegeneration in glaucoma patients as 
measured by mean deviation on VF testing (average of up to 2 last visits), we generated a multivariable 
linear regression model. Our model included the following predictor variables: log10-transformed GDF15 
levels, log10-transformed TGFB2 levels, diabetic status (dichotomized as yes or no based on treating 
physician’s diagnosis), age (continuous variable), race (dichotomized as European descent or African 
American), and IOP (averaged over last 3 visits). We performed model diagnostics on the final model as 
appropriate. Finally, the final reported model omitted a single case with a standardized residual of –2.99 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis.
Study approval. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with Washington University in St. 
Louis School of Medicine Animal Care and Use guidelines after approval by the Animal Studies Committee.
The research protocol for human study was approved by the Washington University School of Medi-
cine Human Research Protection Office and the IRB in compliance with HIPAA guidelines and the tenets 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written Informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to inclusion 
in the study.
