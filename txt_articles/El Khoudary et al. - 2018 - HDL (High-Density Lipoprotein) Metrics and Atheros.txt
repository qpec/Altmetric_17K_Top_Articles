T
he well-known cardioprotective features of HDL (high-
density lipoprotein) can be lost under certain condi-
tions such as chronic inflammation.1 Women who transition 
through menopause are subjected to many adverse physi-
ological changes including alterations in sex hormones, body 
fat deposition, and lipid profile.2 The accrual of these changes 
could trigger a status of chronic inflammation over time3 
that could potentially impact the cardioprotective capac-
ity of HDL. Several studies have shown that higher level of 
the conventional measure of HDL, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-
C), in middle-aged and older women is not always protec-
tive and are associated with greater risk of nonfatal stroke, 
cerebral infarction, and carotid atherosclerosis.4–7 Recent 
findings from the SWAN (Study of Women’s Health Across 
the Nation) suggest a potential role of the menopause transi-
tion. A larger increase in HDL-C over time was significantly 
associated with a greater progression of carotid intima-media 
thickness (cIMT) independent of potential risk factors in 
women at midlife.8 It is unknown whether the cardioprotec-
tive capacity of HDL is compromised in postmenopausal 
women. The crude measure of total cholesterol carried by 
HDL particles may not fully characterize the HDL effect on 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
A novel promising method that physically quantifies HDL 
subclasses is the ion-mobility analysis, a well-established 
method in the field of aerosol science. It is the latest method 
that provides accurate, reproducible, direct determination of 
size and concentration for a wide range of lipoproteins by 
separating lipoproteins by size based on movement of charged 
particles in a gas-phase under the impact of an electric field.9,10 
No previous study has evaluated the effect modification of 
menopause-related factors including age at menopause and 
time since menopause on the associations between concen-
trations of ion-mobility HDL particles (HDL-P) and carotid 
atherosclerosis (level of cIMT and risk of carotid plaque 
[cPlaque] presence) in midlife and older women.

Objective—HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) may not always be cardioprotective in postmenopausal women. 
HDL particles (HDL-P) via ion-mobility may better reflect the antiatherogenicity of HDL. Objectives were (1) to 
evaluate associations of HDL-C and ion-mobility HDL-P with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid plaque 
separately and jointly in women; and (2) to assess interactions by age at and time since menopause.
Approach and Results—Analysis included 1380 females from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; age: 61.8±10.3; 
61% natural-, 21% surgical-, and 18% peri-menopause). Women with unknown or early menopause (age at nonsurgical 
menopause ≤45 years) were excluded. Adjusting for each other, higher HDL-P but not HDL-C was associated with lower 
cIMT (P=0.001), whereas higher HDL-C but not HDL-P was associated with greater risk of carotid plaque presence (P=0.04). 
Time since menopause significantly modified the association of large but not small HDL-P with cIMT; higher large HDL-P 
was associated with higher cIMT close to menopause but with lower cIMT later in life. The proatherogenic association reported 
for HDL-C with carotid plaque was most evident in women with later age at menopause who were >10 years postmenopausal.
Conclusions—Elevated HDL-C may not always be cardioprotective in postmenopausal women. The cardioprotective 
capacity of large HDL-P may adversely compromise close to menopause supporting the importance of assessing how the 
menopause transition might impact HDL quality and related cardiovascular disease risk later in life.

 El Khoudary et al  HDL Atherogenicity in Midlife/Older Women  2237
The MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) is a 
large, well-characterized, ethnically diverse cohort providing 
a unique opportunity to assess whether the cardioprotective 
associations of conventional and ion-mobility measures of 
HDL vary by menopause-related parameters in midlife and 
older women. The proposed analyses will help in identifying 
other metrics that could better capture the cardioprotective 
capacity of HDL in women.
Materials and Methods
The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the 
article and in the online-only Data Supplement.
Study Population
MESA is a longitudinal multicenter cohort study of the prevalence 
and correlates of subclinical CVD and the factors that impact its 
development.11 At baseline (2000–2002), 6814 community-dwelling 
multiracial/multiethnic men (n=3213) and women (n=3601) 45 to 84 
years old were recruited from 6 US sites. Exclusion criteria at base-
line included self-reported CVD, weight >136 kg, pregnancy, cancer, 
or cognitive impairment.
For the current analysis, 2028 women had carotid artery scan and 
HDL ion-mobility data available at MESA baseline visit (examina-
tion 1). Women with triglycerides level >400 mg/dL (n=24) and those 
with unknown menopausal status (n=367) or early menopause (age 
at nonsurgical menopause ≤45 years; n=257) were excluded, leaving 
1380 women for the current analyses on HDL metrics, carotid mea-
sures, and menopausal status. Analyses that assessed effect modifica-
tions by age at and time since menopause additionally excluded 242 
women for whom age at and time since menopause were missing, 
leaving 1138 women for these analyses.
Study protocols were approved by the institutional review board 
at each site and participants provided written informed consent.
Carotid Ultrasonography
At baseline, B-mode ultrasound images of the left and right com-
mon, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery segments were recorded 
using the M12L transducer (General Electric Medical Systems; com-
mon carotid artery frequency, 13 MHz) on Super-VHS videotape 
with a Logiq 700 ultrasound system. Video images were digitized at 
high resolution and frame rates using a Medical Digital Recording 
device (PACSGEAR, Pleasanton, CA) and converted into DICOM-
compatible digital records. Ultrasound images were read at the 
University of Wisconsin Carotid Ultrasound Reading Center. Images 
were imported into syngo Ultrasound Workplace reading stations 
loaded with Arterial Health Package software (Siemens Medical, 
Malvern, PA) for cIMT and cPlaque presence. As described previ-
ously,12 cIMT was defined as the mean of the mean left and right 
mean far wall distal common carotid artery wall thicknesses (the 
distal 10 mm of the common carotid artery, proximal to the carotid 
bifurcation point, where the diameter remains uniform). cPlaque was 
defined as a discrete, focal wall thickening ≥1.5 cm or focal thicken-
ing at least 50% greater than the surrounding IMT.12 The intraclass 
correlation coefficient for intrareader and inter-reader reproducibility 
for mean cIMT were 0.99 and 0.95, respectively. For cPlaque pres-
ence, intrareader and inter-reader reproducibility were κ=0.83 (95% 
CI, 0.70–0.96) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.72–1.00), respectively.12
Ion Mobility and Conventional Lipids
Ion-mobility lipoproteins were measured at the Quest Diagnostics 
Nichols Institute (San Juan Capistrano, CA). Compared with nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methodology which relies 
on the composition of particles as it measures the proton resonance 
associated with the methyl group on esterified cholesterol, ion mobil-
ity separates particles based on size and counts the number of par-
ticles that are separated at each size. The measurement is independent 
of the composition of the particles. Ion mobility can measure lipopro-
tein concentration of the entire size spectrum of lipoprotein particles 
ranging from 5 nm–53 nm at a high-size resolution (<0.1 nm diameter 
on average). Thus, it allows unbiased analysis of the entire lipoprotein 
spectrum without making any assumption about what specific size 
range should be analyzed.10 All specimens were collected as part of 
MESA examination 1 (2000–2002) and analyzed using ion mobility 
in 2015. The complete lipoprotein profiles from these samples were 
very much like the profiles obtained from fresh samples. The LDL 
(low-density lipoprotein) and HDL regions were similar in size, num-
ber, and shape. Before ion-mobility fractionation, lipoproteins were 
isolated by dextran sulfate precipitation (plasma was treated with 
17% ethanol which removed >97% of fibrinogen, and lipoproteins 
were then precipitated with dextran sulfate [2 mg/mL] and calcium 
[0.15 mol/L]). Precipitated lipoproteins were harvested on paramag-
netic particles, washed to remove free salt and proteins, and then 
resuspended in 25 mmol/L ammonium acetate for analysis by ion 
mobility. This method recovered all measureable apoB (apolipopro-
tein B; 105%), apoA-I (96%), and total cholesterol (103%). Removal 
of plasma proteins was assessed by the following proteins (final con-
centration remaining after extraction compared with original serum 
concentration): IgG (3%), albumin (<4%), and transferrin (0%). This 
new isolation procedure has excellent recovery of the lipoprotein par-
ticles based on the apolipoprotein and total cholesterol recoveries.13 
After isolation, the lipoproteins were fractionated and quantitated in 
a single scan using gas-phase electrophoresis.13 Based on the elec-
trical potential applied, the dimensions of the differential mobility 
analyzer, and the airflow rate, the particle diameter and the number of 
particles in each size range can be determined. HDL-P were separated 
to large HDL-P (size range: 14.5–10.5 nm), equivalent to HDL2b, or 
small particles (size range: 10.5–7.65 nm), equivalent to HDL3+2a.14 
Total HDL-P is the summation of the concentrations of the large and 
small HDL-Ps. Concentration of total LDL-P was available for the 
current analysis. The intra-assay and interassay variations were <10% 
and <13% for HDL-P and LDL-P concentrations, respectively. Since 
the original publication of the method,10 refinement to the technique 
have been made that address concerns about the method.13,15,16
Total and HDL-C and triglycerides were measured at a central 
laboratory (Fairview-University Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN) 
after a 12-hour fast. LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using 
the Friedewald equation.17
Menopausal Status
Menopausal status was determined by asking women at baseline if 
they have gone through menopause or change of life. Women were 
required to state the age at which they experienced menopause if they 
answered yes to this question. Women who answered no or don’t 
know were asked to provide the date of their last menstrual period

and the number of periods they had experienced in the last 12 months. 
Women were additionally asked if they have had surgery to remove 
uterus or ovaries. Those who answered yes to these questions were 
required to state the age at which they had their uterus or ovaries 
removed and how many ovaries removed if any. Responses to the 
above questions were cross-evaluated comprehensively to classify 
women into one of the following 4 categories: (1) perimenopause, 
(2) natural menopause, (3) surgical menopause, and (4) unknown 
menopausal status. Women were classified as perimenopause if 
they answered no or don’t know to the question on menopause or 
change of life and reported at least 1 menstrual period in the last 12 
months. Premenopausal women, who reported 12+ periods in the last 
12 months, were combined with perimenopausal women because of 
small sample size (only 47 women were classified as premenopausal). 
Women were classified as natural menopause if they answered yes to 
the question on menopause or change of life or reported no period in 
the last 12 months that was not because of a hysterectomy procedure. 
Women were classified as surgical menopause if they reported that 
they had bilateral oophorectomy. Women who had hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy (with/out hysterectomy) at an age older than 
the reported age at menopause were classified as natural menopause. 
Women with inconsistent data about assessing menopausal status (eg, 
reported having bleeding in the past 12 months and said that they are 
gone through menopause) and those who could not be classified into 
any of the above categories (eg, women who did hysterectomy with/
out unilateral oophorectomy, missing menopausal information, or 
answering unknown to menopause and surgical procedure questions) 
were considered as unknown menopausal status. Women who classi-
fied as menopause (not because of bilateral oophorectomy) at an age 
≤45 years were considered early menopausal. Women with early or 
unknown menopausal status were excluded from the current analysis.
Ages at natural or surgical menopause were self-reported by 
study participants. Time since menopause in years was calculated as 
the age at baseline minus the age at natural menopause or surgical 
menopause. Women reported hormone therapy use as either current 
or ever.
Study Covariates
Race/ethnicity was self-reported. Smoking status was coded as never, 
former, or current smoker. Body mass index was calculated as weight 
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) was measured 3× using an automated sphygmoma-
nometer (Critikon, Tampa, FL) while seated, and the mean of the last 
2 measurements was used. Physical activity was estimated as the total 
amount of intentional exercise performed in a usual week and mea-
sured in metabolic equivalent task–minutes per week. Hypertension 
was defined as having SBP ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg, or 
taking medications for high BP. Diabetes mellitus was defined as the 
use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications or a fasting glucose 
level of ≥126 mg/dL. CRP (C-reactive protein) was measured using 
the BNII nephelometer (N High Sensitivity CRP; Dade Behring Inc, 
Deerfield, IL) and IL (interleukin)-6 was measured by ultrasensitive 
ELISA (Quantikine HS Human IL-6 Immunoassay; R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN).
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of cIMT was slightly skewed thus it was evaluated 
with and without a log transformation. As results were comparable, 
models using the original scale were presented for simplicity of 
interpretation. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize study 
participants in the total study sample and by menopausal status. 
ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis or χ2 tests were used as appropriate to assess 
differences by menopausal status categories. Pairwise comparisons 
across menopausal categories were performed on serum lipids and 
ion-mobility HDL metrics adjusting for multiple testing. To assess 
correlates of HDL-C and HDL ion-mobility metrics, Spearman cor-
relation coefficients were estimated.
To evaluate associations between each HDL metric and each 
of cIMT and cPlaque, linear and logistic regression were used, 
respectively. The model building strategy was based on a priori 
selection of common risk factors in the association between carotid 
measure and HDL metrics which was confirmed by univariate anal-
ysis (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). The first model 
included age, race/ethnicity, study site, and menopausal status. In 
the second model, we further adjusted for body mass index, SBP, 
smoking, physical activity, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering medi-
cations, ever use hormone replacement therapy, IL-6, and CRP. The 
third model was built to determine the independent effect of HDL 
metrics, because each of HDL-C and HDL-P subclasses measure 
different aspects of HDL (total cholesterol contents carried by all 
particles versus concentration of HDL particles of different size), 
adjusting for each other and for LDL metrics (LDL-C and LDL-P) 
on carotid measures such that for (1) HDL-C models we additionally 
adjusted for total HDL-P and LDL-P; (2) total HDL-P, large HDL-P, 
or small HDL-P models were additionally adjusted for HDL-C and 
LDL-P. We built a fourth model for large and small HDL-P, but not 
other HDL metrics, to determine their independent associations with 
carotid measures by additionally adjusting for large HDL-P in small 
HDL-P and vice versa. In model 5, we additionally adjusted for tri-
glycerides and LDL-C for all HDL metrics.
Effect modifications of the associations between carotid measures 
and HDL metrics by time since and age at menopause were tested 
unadjusted and fully adjusted. We found significant effect modifica-
tion of time since menopause on association between large HDL-P 
and cIMT. To visually present this effect modification, we estimated 
adjusted means of cIMT by percentiles of large HDL-P and time 
since menopause. Additionally, the effect of HDL-C on cPlaque pres-
ence was marginally modified by age at menopause. We performed 
additional analysis testing the interaction between HDL-C and age 
at menopause stratified by time since menopause given the poten-
tial possibility of recall bias of age at menopause among MESA 
participants.
Potential multicollinearity was evaluated in all models using vari-
ance inflation factors, and all values were within acceptable limit (≤5) 
indicative of no multicollinearity in any of the fitted models.
As a sensitivity analysis, we conducted all multivariable analyses 
while excluding women on lipid-lowering medications and again by 
not adjusting for study site. All statistical analyses were conducted 
using SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC and significance 
was set at P<0.05.
Results
Participants’ characteristics in total and by menopausal sta-
tus are presented in Table 1. Correlates of HDL metrics are 
presented in Table 2. HDL-C was correlated weakly with 
total HDL-P, and this correlation was stronger with large than 
small HDL-P. HDL-C was inversely correlated with LDL-C 
and LDL-P. In contrast, total, small, and large HDL-Ps were 
positively correlated with LDL-P.
cIMT and HDL Metrics
Each HDL metric was negatively associated with cIMT 
when modeled separately and after adjusting for age, race, 
study site, menopausal status, body mass index, SBP, smok-
ing, physical activity, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering 
medications, ever use of hormone therapy, IL-6, and CRP 
(Figure 1A and 1B, left; Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement; model 2). Adjusting for each other (HDL-C and 
total HDL-P in the same model), study covariates and LDL-
P, total HDL-P but not HDL-C remained negatively associ-
ated with cIMT (Figure 1A, right; Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement; model 3). In models adjusted for study 
covariates, HDL-C, and LDL-P, small but not large HDL-P 
significantly associated with lower cIMT (Figure 1B, right;

Table II in the online-only Data Supplement; model 4). Same 
results were observed for each HDL metric with cIMT after 
further adjustment for LDL-C and triglycerides (Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement; model 5).

was significantly associated with lower cIMT as time since 
menopause increased (Figure 2). This effect modification of 
time since menopause remained significant even after fur-
ther adjustment for triglycerides and LDL-C (P=0.03), data 
not shown. Association between small HDL-P and cIMT did 
not vary by time since menopause. Age at menopause did not 
modify associations between cIMT and HDL metrics.
cPlaque and HDL Metrics
In midlife and older women, only higher HDL-C was mar-
ginally associated with greater risk of cPlaque presence 
(P=0.06) independent of age, race, study site, menopausal 
status, body mass index, SBP, smoking, physical activ-
ity, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering medications, ever use 
of hormone therapy, IL-6, and CRP (Figure 3; Table III in 
the online-only Data Supplement; model 2). Adjusting for 
each other (HDL-C and total HDL-P), study covariates and 
LDL-P, higher HDL-C but not HDL-P became strongly asso-
ciated with greater risk of cPlaque (Figure 3; Table III in 
the online-only Data Supplement; model 3). No significant 
association was observed between small or large HDL-P and 
cPlaque when either modeled separately or adjusted for each 
other and study covariates (Figure 3; Table III in the online-
only Data Supplement). Same results were observed for 
each HDL metric with cPlaque after further adjustment for 
LDL-C and triglycerides (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement; model 5).
Effect Modifications of Menopausal Factors on 
Associations Between HDL Metrics and cPlaque
The positive association of HDL-C with higher risk of cPlaque 
was more evident at older age at menopause, P value for 
adjusted interaction from model 5=0.05). This marginal find-
ing should be interpreted with caution, because this interaction 
was no longer significant after excluding age as a covariate. 
Additionally, further assessment of this interaction stratified 
by time since menopause (≤5 years since menopause, 6–10 
years since menopause, and >10 years since menopause) 
revealed that the positive interaction between age at meno-
pause and HDL-C was only evident in women with >10 years 
since menopause (n=717), data not shown. Interestingly, the 
mean age of this group of women was 69.6 and the mean 
reported age at menopause was 48.3 years. Age at or time 
since menopause did not modify associations between ion-
mobility HDL metrics and cPlaque.
Additional Analyses
Additional analyses were conducted (1) excluding site vari-
able from multivariable analysis, and (2) rerunning models 
excluding women on lipid-lowering medication. In general, 
results from these analyses were similar to findings from the 
main analysis, data not shown.
Discussion
We reported distinct associations of HDL-C and total HDL-P 
with carotid atherosclerotic measures among a large sample of 
midlife and older multiracial/multiethnic women. Adjusting 
for each other (total HDL-P and HDL-C) and CVD risk factors, 
we found that higher total HDL-P was associated with lower 
cIMT, whereas higher HDL-C was associated with higher risk 
of cPlaque presence. The proatherogenic association found for 
HDL-C was most evident in women who reported later age 
at menopause and were >10 years postmenopausal at MESA 
examination 1, suggesting that higher HDL-C in older women 
could be a marker of underlying HDL dysfunction. The cur-
rent results further suggest that time elapsed since menopause 
may impact specific subclasses of HDL that could not be cap-
tured by HDL-C. Interestingly, small but not large HDL-P was 
negatively associated with cIMT and this association was not 
modified by time elapsed since menopause or age at meno-
pause. However, greater concentration of large HDL-P was 
significantly associated with lower cIMT mainly after longer 
time since menopause, suggesting a potential adverse change 
in the quality of these particles close to menopause, which 
seems to be restored later in life. However, longitudinal stud-
ies will need to confirm these cross-sectional findings and test 
our proposed hypotheses by evaluating additional composi-
tional and functional metrics of HDL in women transition 
through menopause.
Although specific HDL subclasses have different biologi-
cal functions and roles in promoting the macrophage reverse 
cholesterol transport,18 the best recognized antiatherogenic 
function of HDL particles,19 it is still unclear whether spe-
cific HDL subclasses are more cardioprotective or could be 
useful measures of benefits of HDL-therapeutic medications. 
Findings vary by methods used to quantify HDL subclasses,

characteristics of the evaluated study population and whether 
independent associations of HDL subclasses were evalu-
ated.18,20 A few studies utilizing NMR to quantify HDL sub-
classes have been conducted in postmenopausal women, but 
they did not evaluate effect modifications by menopause-
related factors or assess independent effect of HDL subclasses 
in the same models.21–23 In postmenopausal women, smaller 
NMR HDL size21 and lower total and medium (8.3–9.3 nm) 
NMR HDL-Ps22 were associated with incident CVD, whereas 
lower large NMR HDL-P (9.4–14.0 nm) was associated with 
extent of coronary calcification.23 Our findings of a protec-
tive association with small HDL-Ps are consistent with the 
above results in obese postmenopausal women showing 
medium NMR HDL-P to be protective independent of total 
HDL-P and LDL-P22; because medium NMR HDL-P (8.3–9.3 
nm) overlaps with small ion-mobility HDL-P (7.7–10.5 nm). 
Irrespective of this agreement, it is important to emphasize that 
direct comparison between different methods of quantifying 
lipoprotein particles may not adequately address variabilities 
because of (1) different methods of separation, (2) different 
definitions of large, medium, and small size, and (3) different 
HDL component measured in each approach.24
Interestingly, we found that associations between large, 
but not small, HDL-P and cIMT was modified by time elapsed 
since menopause; such that higher concentrations of large 
HDL-P were associated with higher cIMT close to menopause 
but with lower cIMT later in life. This finding suggests large 
HDL-P be more prone to dysfunctionality over the menopause 
transition than small HDL-P. Interestingly, large HDL-P is 
more vulnerable to oxidative modification compared with small 
dense HDL-P.18 Recently, we assessed changes in concentra-
tions of HDL subclasses, as measured by calibrated ion mobil-
ity,25 and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity among 46 women 
(mean baseline age=47.1 years) before and after menopause as 
indexed by the final menstrual period from the SWAN study. 
Interestingly, small HDL-P did not correlate with macrophage

cholesterol efflux capacity either before or after menopause, 
whereas higher large HDL-P concentration significantly cor-
related with greater HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and this 
correlation was stronger before than after menopause, suggest-
ing that the menopause transition may impair large HDL-P’s 
ability to promote cholesterol efflux capacity. Our findings 
from MESA women’s cohort showing higher HDL-P to be 
positively associated with cIMT close to menopause are in line 
with our earlier findings from SWAN.25 The current analysis 
suggests large HDL-P to play a protective role later after meno-
pause. Interestingly, individuals with exceptional longevity and 
their offspring have larger HDL-P sizes and a lower prevalence 
of CVD.26 Additionally, although no observed significant varia-
tion in large HDL particles was seen between young and elderly 
in a small study investigating the effect of aging on capacity 
of HDL particles to promote cholesterol efflux capacity, large 
HDL2 in elderly showed a trend of higher capacity to promote 
cholesterol efflux than in young participants.27
Several studies have showed that higher level of HDL-C 
in middle-aged and older women is not always cardioprotec-
tive.28 Our findings of a positive association between higher 
level of HDL-C and risk of cPlaque are in line with these pre-
vious studies4–8 and suggest HDL-C as a marker of underly-
ing dysfunctionality rather than a true indicator of CVD risk. 
Interestingly, a recent study of P376L variant of the hepatic 
HDL scavenger receptor BI, encoded by the gene SCARB1, 
demonstrated that the gene increased both HDL-C and CVD 
risk.29 In vivo studies in Scarb1 knockout mice showed that 
scavenger receptor BI is an important positive regulator of 
macrophage reverse cholesterol transport, despite lowering

HDL-C serum concentration.30 Thus, a decline in hepatic 
scavenger receptor BI function in humans may cause impaired 
reverse cholesterol transport, which leads to increased risk of 
CVD despite elevation in HDL-C levels. HDL-C is a crude 
measure of the total cholesterol contents carried by all HDL 
particles and thus may not correctly capture any changes 
impacting HDL particles composition or functions.
Our results of a consistent negative association of total 
HDL-P but not HDL-C with cIMT after including both met-
rics in the same model was in line with a previous work from 
MESA, which was not specifically focusing on menopause31 
and evaluated the independent associations of HDL-C and 
total HDL-P (measured via NMR spectroscopy) with cIMT 
among the full MESA cohort. The agreement between our 
findings and previous work from MESA31 irrespective of using 
different methods to quantify total HDL-P, suggest that total 
HDL-P is a better indicator of HDL antiatherogenic features 
than HDL-C in midlife and older women among whom the 
cardioprotective capacity of HDL-C has been challenged.28 
Total HDL-P concentrations can provide consistent informa-
tion on CVD risk that is independent of HDL-C.32–34
The current study should be viewed in the context of sev-
eral limitations. It was limited by the cross-sectional design 
and thus reversal causality is possible. Additionally, we could 
not assess the impact of the menopause transition on HDL 
quality changes since this would require repeated measures of 
HDL metrics over the menopause transition. In MESA, meno-
pausal status as well as age at menopause were self-reported 
and could be subjected to recall bias given the age of the MESA 
women participants. By design, MESA did not include suffi-
cient number of regularly menstruating women which limited 
our ability to compare associations between HDL subclasses 
and carotid atherosclerosis in regularly menstruating women 
and postmenopausal women. The lack of medical history data 
impacting menopausal status in early menopause women, 
not because of bilateral oophorectomies resulted in exclud-
ing those women from the current analysis. Thus, our find-
ings may not be generalizable to nonsurgical early menopause 
women. The reported findings should be interpreted with cau-
tions given the multiple testing performed, which increases 
the chance of a type I error. However, the tested lipoproteins 
are correlated, and we interpreted the results, emphasizing 
the consistency with prior studies. MESA did not include 
any measure of HDL functionality, such as HDL cholesterol 
efflux capacity. It would be interesting to assess capacity of 
HDL subclasses to promote cholesterol efflux by time elapsed 
since menopause. Finally, the lack of studies about long-term 
stability of HDL in frozen samples is always a concern with 
any retrospective analysis of clinical study samples where 
samples have been stored (all-be-it under ideal storage condi-
tions) for long periods of time. However, lipoprotein profiles 
from MESA stored samples have been shown to be consistent 
with those obtained from fresh frozen specimens per Quest 
Diagnostics laboratory. Irrespective of these limitations, this 
is the first large cross-sectional analysis in midlife and older 
women comparing cardioprotective characteristics of HDL-C 
with HDL subclasses physically quantified based on size and 
charges of HDL-P using ion-mobility method.9,10 Given the 
large sample size we were able to control for many potential 
confounds and assess the joint effect of HDL subclasses, an 
important analytic methodology that should be evaluated in 
all studies given the dynamic remodeling between large and 
small HDL-Ps and the significant correlates.18
In this large cross-sectional analysis among midlife and 
older women from the MESA cohort, adjusting for each other 
and traditional risk factors, higher HDL-P was associated 
with lower cIMT, whereas higher HDL-C was associated with 
higher risk of cPlaque presence. The protective association 
between small HDL-P and cIMT was not modified by meno-
pausal characteristics, suggesting small particles to not affect 
by the menopause transition. However, large HDL-P may 
be compromised at menopause. We hypothesize that higher 
HDL-C in older women could be a marker of underlying HDL 
dysfunction. Findings from this study support the importance 
of assessing how the menopause transition might impact HDL 
quality and how that might impact women risk of CVD later 
in life. A longitudinal study over the menopause transition 
that includes comprehensive metrics of HDL composition and 
function will significantly enhance our understanding of the 
complex association of the menopause and HDL.

Highlights
• Higher HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) was associated with greater atherosclerosis risk, whereas higher HDL-P (HDL particle) was 
protective in midlife and older women.
• Time since menopause modified the association of large but not small HDL-P with atherosclerosis risk.
• Higher large HDL-P was associated with higher atherosclerosis risk close to menopause but with lower risk thereafter.
