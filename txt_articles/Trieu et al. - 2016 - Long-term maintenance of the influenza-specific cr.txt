Background. Annual vaccination for healthcare workers and other high-risk groups is the mainstay of the public health strat-
egy to combat influenza. Inactivated influenza vaccines confer protection by inducing neutralizing antibodies efficiently against 
homologous and closely matched virus strains. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, cross-reactive T cells have been shown to 
limit disease severity. However, animal studies and a study in immunocompromised children suggested that repeated vaccination 
hampers CD8+ T cells. Yet the impact of repeated annual influenza vaccination on both cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has 
not been explored, particularly in healthy adults.
Methods. We assembled a unique cohort of healthcare workers who received a single AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine 
in 2009 and subsequently either repeated annual vaccination or no further vaccination during 2010–2013. Blood samples were col-
lected before the influenza season or vaccination to assess antibody and T-cell responses.
Results. Antibody titers to H1N1pdm09 persisted above the protective level in both the repeated- and single-vaccination groups. 
The interferon γ+ (IFN-γ+) and multifunctional CD4+ T-cell responses were maintained in the repeated group but declined signifi-
cantly in the single-vaccination group. The IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells remained stable in both groups.
Conclusions. This study provides the immunological evidence base for continuing annual influenza vaccination in adults.

Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective strategy 
available to combat seasonal influenza and is routinely recom-
mended in many countries for children, older adults, health-
care workers (HCWs), and other high-risk groups [1, 2]. 
However, emerging data suggest that repeated vaccination hin-
ders the influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity, a potential 
double-edged sword effect. Annual vaccination may prevent 
natural infection that boosts these cross-reactive T cells, thus 
potentially increasing susceptibility to influenza illness in the 
event of a vaccine mismatch or a pandemic [3]. In light of recent 
evidence in humans for a protective role of CD8+ T cells in the 
absence of neutralizing antibodies, this leads to the question 
of the impact of vaccination history on immunity to influenza 
and the immunological evidence base for the policy of repeated 
annual vaccination.
Current inactivated influenza vaccines mediate protection by 
inducing strain-specific neutralizing antibodies predominantly 
against hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface glycoprotein. 
Occasionally, the emergence of new influenza virus with antigenic 
differences in the HA protein results in a mismatch between the 
vaccine and circulating strains, leading to decreased vaccine effi-
cacy. This necessitates annual updating of influenza vaccine com-
position and the need for annual vaccination of high-risk groups. 
In the absence of strain-specific anti-HA neutralizing antibodies, 
recent work has demonstrated a protective effect of preexisting 
influenza-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)–secreting CD4+ [4] and 
CD8+ [5, 6] memory T cells recognizing conserved internal 
viral epitopes [7]. These memory T cells are long lived and may 
provide long-lasting protection from heterosubtypic influenza 
viruses [8]. Although multiple studies have reported an induc-
tion of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells after a single vaccination 
[9–12], less is known about the impact of repeated vaccination on 
memory CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, 1 study reported a hamper-
ing of the cross-reactive CD8+ T cells in immunocompromised 
children who had received multiple annual vaccinations [13]. Yet 
the critical question of whether repeated annual influenza vac-
cination impacts upon both cross-protective CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells remains unanswered, particularly in healthy adults.
To address this key question, we conducted a 5-year longi-
tudinal cohort study in HCWs vaccinated with an adjuvanted

 Repeated Vaccination Maintains CD4 Cells • JID 2017:215 (1 March) • 741
monovalent H1N1 pandemic 2009 (H1N1pdm09) vaccine. We 
compared immune responses between those who subsequently 
received seasonal vaccine every year (repeated vaccination) and 
those who did not (single vaccination) to test the hypothesis that 
repeated vaccination adversely impacts on long-term cross-pro-
tective T-cell responses. This study is the first to explore both 
strain-specific and cross-reactive T-cell responses, as well as 
antibodies, after repeated versus single vaccination, and is the 
longest follow-up study in the post-H1N1pdm09 era. Our find-
ings have important implications for public vaccination policy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Healthcare workers at the Haukeland University Hospital were 
recruited into an open-label 5-year extension of the single-arm 
clinical trial in 2009, which had ethical and regulatory approval 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01003288). All participants pro-
vided written informed consent before inclusion and were vacci-
nated with a single dose of the AS03-adjuvanted monovalent split 
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine. The inclusion/exclusion criteria 
have been published [14]. Healthcare workers were followed up 
through 2010–2013 and categorized into either the single (no fur-
ther vaccination) or the repeated group (annual vaccination in all 
subsequent seasons with the nonadjuvanted trivalent split virus 
vaccine). The trivalent vaccine contained H1N1pdm09 as the A/
H1N1 component and A/H3N2 and B viruses. Twenty-five HCWs 
who provided peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 
serum samples in 2012 and 2013 before the influenza season and 
vaccination were included in this study (Figure 1).
The PBMCs were isolated using cell preparation tubes 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cryopreserved 
at −150°C in 90% fetal calf serum/10% dimethyl sulphoxide 
until used. Sera were separated from clotted blood, aliquoted, 
and stored at −80°C until used.
Peptides and Virus
The influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 conserved peptide 
pools, which contained an optimal combination of HLA class 
I– and class II–restricted T-cell epitopes from viral inter-
nal proteins conserved among influenza A subtypes [15], 
were chemically synthesized (Supplementary Tables 1 and 
2). The split H1N1pdm09 antigen or egg-grown wild-type

A/California/07/09(H1N1) virus were used to assess CD4+ or 
CD8+ T-cell responses, respectively.
Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay
Serum samples were used in duplicate with 0.7% turkey 
red blood cells and 8 hemagglutinating units of inactivated 
H1N1pdm09 antigen, as described previously [14]. The hem-
agglutination inhibition (HI) titer was determined as the recip-
rocal of the highest serum dilution causing 50% inhibition of 
hemagglutination. Negative titers (<10) were assigned a value 
of 5 for calculation purpose.
Fluorospot Assay
The influenza-specific IFN-γ/interleukin 2 (IL-2)–secreting T 
cells were measured by fluorospot assay following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Briefly, 400 000 PBMCs in Roswell Park 
Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum were stimulated with CD4 or CD8 conserved pep-
tide pools (2 μg/mL), split H1N1pdm09 antigen (2.5 μg/mL), 
anti-CD3 T-cell activator (positive control), or medium alone 
(negative control) in duplicate overnight at 37°C with 5% carbon 
dioxide. Spot forming units (SFUs) were counted using a fluo-
rescence reader fitted with color filters for FITC and Cy3. The 
average SFUs of duplicates were calculated. Background from 
negative controls was subtracted from stimulation responses.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining Assay
The PBMCs were stimulated in vitro with split H1N1pdm09 
antigen (2.5 μg/mL), wild-type A/California/07/09(H1N1) virus 
(multiplicity of infection 5), phorbol-myristate acetate (25 ng/
mL)/ionomycin (250 ng/mL) (positive control), or lymphocyte 
medium (negative control) overnight at 37°C with 5% carbon 
dioxide and stained for T-helper 1 cytokines (IFN-γ/IL-2/tumor 
necrosis factor α [TNF–α]) as described [11]. Data were acquired 
on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed in FlowJo, 
version 10. See Supplementary Table 3 and Figure 1 for the fluo-
rochrome-conjugated antibodies and gating strategy used.
Statistical Analysis
The demographic and clinical characteristics, geometric mean 
HI titers, and T-cell SFUs between groups or within groups 
were examined by chi-square independence and nonparamet-
ric Mann–Whitney U or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests in SPSS-
Statistics version 24. The fold-changes of responses were log 
transformed, and the ranges were compared between groups. 
A general linear model was used to identify any correlation in 
the dataset. Comparisons of responses were controlled for sub-
ject variables and other characteristics using linear mixed-ef-
fect models in RStudio version 0.99.878. Graphs were plotted in 
Prism version 6. Analysis and presentation of cytokine profiles 
were performed in SPICE version 5.1 [16]. A P value < .05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study Population
Twenty-five HCWs who had received an AS03-adjuvanted 
H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 were enrolled in this study and 
categorized into either the single (n = 12) or the repeated group 
(n = 13) that received no further vaccination or received annual 
influenza vaccination during 2010–2013, respectively (Figure 
1). Blood samples were collected in 2012 and 2013 to allow 
multiple annual vaccinations in the repeated group. In 2013, 3 
subjects from the single and 1 from the repeated group were 
excluded due to a change in their vaccination status from 2012. 
The mean age of participants was 42.3 (range = 30–64) years, 
with a female majority (n = 21/25) reflecting the demographics 
of the Norwegian healthcare sector. There were no significant 
differences in age, sex ratio, or other clinical characteristics 
between the 2 groups (Table 1).
Persistence of H1N1pdm09-Specific Antibodies and T Cells
The H1N1pdm09-specific antibody responses were assessed by 
the HI assay, the current standard serological test for detecting 
influenza antibody. No significant difference in antibody titers

was found between the single and the repeated groups measured 
at the start of the 2 consecutive influenza seasons (Figure 2A). 
Regardless of their vaccination history, the majority of HCWs 
had persistent HI titers above the protective threshold (HI titer 
≥ 40): 78% (n = 7/9) in the single group and 83% (n = 10/12) in 
the repeated group (Figure 2B).
Influenza-specific IFN-γ/IL-2–secreting T cells were mea-
sured in the fluorospot assay. In agreement with the persistent 
antibody titers, high frequencies of the H1N1pdm09-specific 
memory T cells were found in both groups over the 2 years 
(Figure 3A–C). However, the IFN-γ, IL-2, or IFN-γ IL-2–secret-
ing H1N1pdm09-specific memory T cells were maintained in 
the repeated group for 1 year after the last vaccination. While a 
decline in frequencies of these T-cells secreting IFN-γ (P = .20), 
IL-2 (P = .04) and IFN-γ IL-2 (P = .03) was observed 3–4 years 
after a single vaccination.
Interestingly, using general linear models to identify any 
association between the HCW characteristics following the 
H1N1pdm09 vaccination and immune responses 3–4 years 
later in the 2 groups, we found a modest correlation between 
the adverse events reported after the 2009 pandemic vacci-
nation and the strain-specific memory T-cell responses 3-4 
years later in the single group (r2 = 0.32; P = .001). A cor-
relation between age and the magnitude of these responses 
was found following repeated vaccination (r2 = 0.45; P = .01) 
(Supplementary Figure 2). Older HCWs and those working 
on clinical wards in the repeated group tended to receive 
annual vaccination more frequently, even before 2009. The 
observed age effect may relate to the improved influen-
za-specific memory responses over time following repeated 
vaccination.
Maintenance of Cross-Reactive IFN-γ+CD4+ T-Cells after Repeated 
Vaccination
Recent work has demonstrated a protective role for CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells recognizing internal viral proteins in limiting ill-
ness severity in humans [4–7]. Here we explored the impact of 
repeated vaccination (3–4 years of annual seasonal vaccination) 
on the influenza-specific cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
compared with natural exposure to influenza viruses (3–4 years 
after a single vaccination) in the fluorospot assay. Separate pep-
tide pools of CD4 or CD8 epitopes (predominantly from nucle-
oprotein [NP] and matrix1 [M1] protein) highly conserved and 
prevalent across influenza A subtypes were used.
We found a significant decline in the frequencies of the 
cross-reactive IL-2 and IFN-γ IL-2–secreting CD4+ T cells after 
1 year in both groups (P < .05) (Figure 3E and 3F). The frequen-
cies of the cross-reactive IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells decreased signifi-
cantly in the single group (P = .04) but were maintained in the 
repeated group for a year (Figure 3D). It is likely that repeated 
exposures to the same immunodominant viral NP and M1 anti-
gens [17], found in split virus seasonal vaccines [18, 19], help 
maintain these responses.
Moreover, we observed stable cross-reactive IFN-γ+CD8+ T 
cells after 3–4 years of repeated vaccination (Figure 3G). A sig-
nificant decrease in the IL-2+CD8+ T cells was found (P = .004); 
however, the low frequencies of these cells (< 10 SFUs/million 
PBMCs, detection limit of 1) in both groups made it less robust 
(Figure 3H). Nevertheless, CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ, but not 
IL-2, have been found to correlate with protection [5, 6]. In con-
trast to the lack of maintenance of the CD4+ T-cells 3–4 years 
after a single vaccination, no decline in the frequencies of the 
cross-reactive CD8+ T cells was observed (Figure 3G–I).

previous seasonal influenza vaccination, underlying risk factors, and adverse events after the 2009 pandemic vaccination) using linear mixed-effect models. The fold-changes 
of responses were log-transformed and the ranges were compared between groups.

Maintenance of Central Memory and Effector Memory CD4+ T-Cells 
Following Repeated Vaccination
We further investigated whether particular influenza-specific 
T-cell memory subsets were associated with the observed main-
tenance or decline of the cross-reactive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. 
Subjects with the highest fold-decrease of CD4+ responses in 
the single group over the year and highest fold-decrease of 
IL-2+CD8+ response for the repeated group while maintaining 
IFN-γ+CD4+ responses were selected (n = 5 per group). Using 
the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay, we assessed 
cytokine responses of 4 memory subsets within CD4+ or CD8+ 
T-cell populations (CD45RA−CCR7+ central memory [CM], 
CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory [EM], CD45RA+CCR7− late 
effector memory [EMRA], and CD45RA+CCR7+ naive [NA]) 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
We found that IFN-γ and IL-2 were predominantly produced 
by the H1N1pdm09-specific CM and EM CD4+ subsets, regard-
less of the vaccination group (Figure 4A and 4B). In the single 
group, a trend of declining frequencies of IL-2−secreting CM 
(P = .07) and EM (P = .06) CD4+ T cells was observed (Figure 
5B and 5D), which may explain the decline in the cross-reac-
tive CD4+ T-cell responses observed in the fluorospot assay.

memory T-cell responses secreting interferon γ (IFN-γ) (A, D, G), interleukin 2 (IL-2) (B, E, H), or double cytokine IFN-γ IL-2 (C, F, I) against H1N1pdm09 split vaccine antigen and CD4 
or CD8 conserved peptide pools. Each symbol represents an individual response in the single (square) and the repeated groups (round) in 2012 (light) and 2013 (dark). The horizontal

groups and within groups between years were tested for statistical significance and controlled for subject variables and demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, working on 
clinical ward, seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009, previous seasonal influenza vaccination, underlying risk factors, and adverse events after the 2009 pandemic vaccination) 
using linear mixed-effect models. The fold-changes of responses were log transformed, and the ranges were compared between groups. *P < .05. **P < .01.

We found higher frequencies of the CM (P = .07) and EM (P 
= .04) IL-2+CD4+ T cells in the repeated group compared with 
the single group in 2013. Consistent with our finding of the 
IFN-γ+CD4+ T-cell maintenance in the fluorospot assay, IFN-γ 
responses in the CM and EM CD4+ subsets were maintained 
in the repeated group for 1 year (Figure 5A and 5C). The EM 
cells migrate to peripheral tissues and can immediately react 
with effector function upon antigen encounter. The high pro-
portion of EM CD4+ subset following repeated vaccination is 
likely to provide influenza immunity. Furthermore the CM cells 
are long lived and can rapidly proliferate and differentiate into 
effector cells following antigen exposure [20]. It is tempting to 
speculate that the long-term persistence of T-cell responses fol-
lowing repeated antigen stimulation is by repetitive boosting of 
virus-specific CM T cells.
Unlike CD4+ T cells, the virus-specific IFN-γ+ and IL-2+CD8+ 
T cells were predominantly of the EM and EMRA subsets in 
both groups (Figure 4C and 4D). Because of large subject diver-
sities, we did not observe any significant differences in the cyto-
kine responses among memory CD8+ subsets in the 2 groups.
Enhanced Multifunctionality of CD4+ T-Cells after Repeated Vaccination
We explored the multifunctional cytokine-secreting (IFN-γ/
IL-2/TNF-α) quality of the influenza-specific T cells in a subset 
of participants (n = 5 per group). Seven distinct combinations 
of cytokine-secreting subsets were assessed; triple producer 
(IFN-γ+IL-2+TNF-α+), double producers (IFN-γ+IL-2+; IFN-
γ+TNF-α+; IL-2+TNF-α+) and single producers (IFN-γ+; IL-2+; 
TNF-α+).
We found a trend of declining proportions of multifunc-
tional CD4+ T cells (secreting ≥ 2 cytokines) 3–4 years after a 
single vaccination (P = .06); these proportions were maintained 
following 3–4 repeated vaccinations, resulting in higher pro-
portions of double producers in the repeated group (P = .01). 
Higher single producers were observed in the single group 
(P = .02) in 2013 (Figure 6A, 6B, 6E, and 6F). Further analy-
sis revealed a decline in the proportion of IL-2+TNF-α+ in the 
single group (P = .03) and an increase in IFN-γ+TNF-α+ pro-
ducers in the repeated group (P = .05) from 2012 to 2013 that 
contributed to the higher proportions of IL-2+TNF-α+ (P = .03) 
and IFN-γ+TNF-α+ (P = .08) producers in the repeated group

group at each time point (2012, 2013) is shown in the stacked columns. CD45RA−CCR7+ central memory (CM), CD45RA-CCR7− effector memory (EM), CD45RA+CCR7− late 
effector memory (EMRA), and CD45RA+ CCR7+ naive (NA) T cells were differentiated within the whole population of cytokine+ T cells. Gating for CD45RA and CCR7 markers 
were optimized using the fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls containing all the flurochromes in the T-cell panel except for the 1 that was measured in flow cytometry (see 
gating strategy, Supplementary Figure 1).

compared with the single group in 2013 (Figure 6C, 6D, 6G, 
and 6H).
We observed no significant difference when comparing either 
the multifunctionality or each cytokine combination of CD8+ T 
cells. However, similar to CD4+ T cells, a trend of higher pro-
portions of double producers was observed in the repeated 
group (Figure 6I–P).
DISCUSSION
It has been hypothesized that repeated annual influenza vacci-
nation might adversely impact influenza-specific cross-reactive 
cellular immunity and consequently increase the risk of severe 
illness upon infection [3]. Remarkably, despite the use of influ-
enza vaccination for >50 years, there are no data on the quality 
of memory T-cell responses following repeated vaccination in 
adults. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to investigate the 
magnitude, durability, and quality of CD4+ and CD8+ memory 
T-cell responses following repeated versus single vaccination 
and the longest follow-up of adults after the 2009 pandemic. 
Surprisingly and in contrast to our original hypothesis, we found 
that the strain-specific and cross-reactive IFN-γ+CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells were maintained with more multifunctional cytokine-se-
creting T cells after multiple annual vaccinations. Furthermore, 
strain-specific antibodies persisted above the protective levels 
in repeatedly vaccinated adults. Our findings suggest there are 
potential immunological benefits from repeated annual vaccina-
tion and do not support the hypothesis that repeated vaccina-
tions hamper cross-reactive T-cell immunity in adults.
A single influenza vaccination induces memory T cells 
cross-reactive against previously circulating and potentially 
pandemic strains [11, 21, 22]. Here, we show for the first time 
that repeated vaccination also maintains cross-reactive mem-
ory IFN-γ+CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that 
healthy adults receiving multiple annual vaccinations would be 
protected against severe influenza illness in the event of vaccine

mismatch or emergence of a novel virus. This hypothesis might 
be tested by routinely collecting vaccination history alongside 
influenza surveillance data, which is used to estimate annual 
vaccine effectiveness. It also remains to be seen whether our 
findings extend to other high-risk groups. The indirect benefit 
on patients of vaccinating HCWs [23] and our findings show-
ing limited adverse impact of repeated vaccinations on cross-re-
active cellular immunity would advocate for continuing the 
annual vaccination policy in HCWs.
Influenza vaccination has been shown to elicit CD4+ 
responses [9, 10, 24], correlating with neutralizing antibodies 
[12]. We extended these observations to characterize the func-
tional quality of CD4+ T cells induced by repeated vaccination. 
Our multiparametric characterizations of the CD4+ population 
revealed that repeated vaccination maintained predominantly 
multi-cytokine-secreting CD4+ cells, whereas a skewing toward 
a single-cytokine-secreting T-cell population was observed in 
adults after a single vaccination. Multi-cytokine-secreting T 
cells have been shown to be functionally superior to single-cy-
tokine producers in maintaining memory capacity [25, 26] and 
may be 1 explanation for the maintenance of cross-reactive 
IFN-γ+CD4+ T-cells after repeated vaccination. This qualita-
tive difference in T-cell responses between our 2 groups reflects 
either the difference in vaccination history or the change in 
quality over time after antigen exposure. T-cell responses were 
analyzed 1 year after the last annual vaccination over 4 years in 
the repeated group compared with responses 3–4 years after a 
single vaccination in the single group.
Concerns were raised that preventing infection by annual 
vaccination would prevent induction of cross-reactive T cells 
[3]. One study demonstrated a hampering on the IFN-γ+CD8+ 
T cells in immunocompromised children who had received 
multiple annual vaccinations [13]. In our study of healthy 
adults who had received multiple annual vaccinations, stable

IFN-γ+CD8+ T-cell frequencies were observed. Perhaps this is 
because of the age-related difference in the immune system. 
Memory T cells have been shown to rapidly increase in the 
first 2–3 decades of life before reaching homeostasis in adults 
[27]. Once established, the influenza-specific CD8+ T cells are 
long lived and measurable up to 10 years after infection [8]. It 
is likely that in children, annual vaccination may prevent neces-
sary boosting of the CD8+ T-cell responses by natural infection, 
whereas in influenza-experienced adults, our findings suggest 
that a steady state of memory CD8+ T cells has already been 
reached, which may not require regular boosting by natural 
infection. We cannot exclude vaccination failures in our partic-
ipants, which may have allowed infection-induced boosting of 
the T-cell response. However, the high titers of strain-specific 
antibodies and the absence of self-reported influenza illness or 
hospitalizations in our participants suggest this is unlikely.
Repeated vaccination with the same antigen has been reported 
to not significantly influence the antibody induction [28–30]. Our 
finding that a single administration of the adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 
vaccine induced durable persistence of protective antibody 
responses without the boost from repeated vaccination is surpris-
ing. This is probably due to the AS03 adjuvant that was shown to 
increase vaccine immunogenicity [31]. This vaccine maintained 
not only persistently high antibody titers for up to 1 year [14, 29, 32, 
33], but also the quality of antibody responses [34] even in those 
who required revaccination to maintain their antibody titers [35]. 
Our finding extends this period of sustained antibody maintenance 
up to 4 years after vaccination and is the longest follow-up to date 
of adjuvanted vaccine-induced responses. Although we cannot 
exclude the possibility that this persistence may be due to regular 
exposure to circulating H1N1pdm09 strains through subclinical 
infection during the study, it is unlikely that all single-vaccinated 
HCWs were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the preceding year. Our 
data also have implications for the use of AS03 adjuvant with other 
antibody-inducing vaccines such as those for malaria, respiratory 
syncytial virus, and Ebola.
The frequencies of the strain-specific and cross-reactive 
CD4+ T cells declined between 3–4 years after a single vacci-
nation, which is consistent with our understanding of T-cell 
memory development in humans [36]. The high frequencies of 
H1N1pdm09-specific T cells after 3–4 years may be explained 
by the correlation between these T cells and the adverse events 
reported after H1N1pdm09 vaccination, which may reflect 
the strength of vaccine-induced immunity. Because we do not 
have T-cell data on earlier time points, we cannot distinguish 
between a continuous decline after vaccination or maintenance 
for 3 years after vaccination and a subsequent decline. Although 
this decrease was observed from peripheral blood, it is unlikely 
to be due to trafficking to the site of infection because blood was 
collected 2–3 months before the influenza epidemic and there 
was no self-reported influenza-like symptoms or illness.
We faced some caveats inherent in longitudinal cohort stud-
ies. Our strict inclusion criteria (not vaccinated in any subse-
quent season or vaccinated every year) designed to reduce the 
bias inherent in missing intervening vaccination history limited 
the sample size of this study to 25 subjects from 250 HCWs. We 
specifically chose HCWs because they are an important and sta-
ble population with good records of influenza vaccination and 
self-reported influenza-like illness. Although many of the com-
parisons between the 2 groups lost statistical significances after 
correcting for multiple-testing issue by Bonferroni method, 
we observed clear trends in the T-cell responses and therefore 
presented the results considering P value < .05 as significance. 
We believe our findings are valuable taking into account the 
difficulties to establish a cohort with reliable vaccination back-
grounds. Also, the circulating T cells assessed in this study may 
not reflect local tissue-specific immune responses [37]. Our 
study was conducted after AS03 adjuvanted pandemic vaccina-
tion, and our findings of maintenance of T-cell immunity need 
to be confirmed after nonadjuvanted 2009 pandemic or annual 
seasonal vaccination. Further studies are required to evaluate 
both antibody and T-cell responses following repeated vacci-
nation with nonadjuvanted vaccines, against other frequently 
changing seasonal vaccine strains, and in other high-risk groups 
recommended for annual vaccination.
Our study provides new insights into the impact of annual 
influenza vaccination on T-cell immunity with implications 
for vaccination policy and development. We found that the 
AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine generated long-term dura-
ble antibodies and T cells after a single vaccination, which has 
significant implications for future vaccine design. Our findings 
reveal that repeated annual vaccination maintained strain-spe-
cific antibodies and T cells, importantly cross-reactive IFN-
γ+CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, our study provides 
immunological evidence for continuing annual influenza vacci-
nation policy in adults.
