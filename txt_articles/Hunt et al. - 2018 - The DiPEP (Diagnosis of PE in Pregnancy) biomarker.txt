Summary
This study aimed to estimate the diagnostic utility of biomarkers for sus-
pected venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the puerperium.
Research nurses/midwives collected blood samples from 310 pregnant/post-
partum women with suspected pulmonary emboli (PE) and 18 with diag-
nosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VTE was diagnosed using imaging,
treatment and adverse outcome data. Primary analysis was limited to
women with conclusive imaging (36 with VTE, 247 without). The area
under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker was: activated partial thrombo-
plastin time 0�669 (95% confidence interval 0�570–0�768), B-type natri-
uretic peptide 0�549 (0�453–0�645), C-reactive protein 0�542 (0�445–0�639),
Clauss
fibrinogen
0�589
(0�476–0�701),
D-Dimer
(by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay) 0�668 (0�561–0�776), near-patient D-Dimer 0�651
(0�545–0�758), mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 0�524 (0�418–
0�630), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 0�562 (0�462–0�661), plasmin-antiplas-
min complexes 0�639 (0�536–0�742), prothombin time 0�613 (0�508–0�718),
thrombin generation lag time 0�702 (0�598–0�806), thrombin generation
endogenous potential 0�559 (0�437–0�681), thrombin generation peak 0�596
(0�478–0�715), thrombin generation time to peak 0�655 (0�541–0�769), sol-
uble tissue factor 0�531 (0�424–0�638) and serum troponin 0�597 (0�499–
0�695). No diagnostically useful threshold for diagnosing or ruling out VTE
was identified. In pregnancy and the puerperium, conventional and candi-
date biomarkers have no utility either for their negative or positive predic-
tive value in the diagnosis of VTE.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the leading direct cause of
death in pregnancy and postpartum (Knight et al, 2016) but
symptoms suggesting PE are common in pregnancy and
puerperium, and recent studies (Goodacre et al, 2015) have
reported a low positive yield from imaging, with only 5% of
scans confirming a PE. This suggests that many women are
undergoing imaging involving potentially harmful radiation
to exclude PE.
A number of conventional and candidate biomarkers
could be used in women during pregnancy and the puer-
perium with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE) to
either exclude VTE or to positively identify it. For example,
D-dimer is currently used in the non-pregnant population
with suspected PE for its negative predictive value to safely
withhold imaging from those with a low clinical risk and
negative D-dimer (Wells et al, 2001; Stein et al, 2003; Craw-
ford et al, 2016; van der Hulle et al, 2017), while troponin
and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are used for their posi-
tive predictive value to grade extent of PE. Guidelines from
the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (2015)
and American Thoracic Society (Leung et al, 2011) currently
recommend that all pregnant and postpartum women with

 suspected PE should receive diagnostic imaging, whereas
guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (Kon-
stantinides et al, 2014) suggest a possible role for D-dimer in
selecting patients.
A recent review (Goodacre et al, 2015) found insufficient
data to support using normal values of D-dimer in pregnant
and postpartum women to exclude VTE. The main limita-
tion in previous studies was methodological; the low preva-
lence of PE in cohorts with suspected PE and consequent
lack of precision in estimates of diagnostic sensitivity. Low
prevalence means that the ideal study design to estimate
diagnostic accuracy, a cohort study, provides an imprecise
estimate of sensitivity unless it is extremely large. A case-con-
trol study could provide a more precise estimate, albeit with
a higher risk of bias (Lijmer et al, 1999).
A compromise between these designs is a cohort study
augmented with additional cases of confirmed disease to
increase the precision of estimates of sensitivity. We used this
design in the Diagnosis of PE in Pregnancy (DiPEP) study to
evaluate clinical features, decision rules, D-dimer and chest
x-ray (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN21245595). A cohort of
pregnant or postpartum women presenting with suspected
PE to eleven prospectively recruiting hospitals was aug-
mented with cases of diagnosed PE, identified across all hos-
pitals
participating
in
the
United
Kingdom
Obstetric
Surveillance System (UKOSS) research platform. This design
was unable to increase the number of cases for biomarker
analysis, however, because it was impractical to seek consent
to additional blood sampling from the cases identified
through UKOSS. We therefore used an alternative strategy to
increase the number of cases and identified women diag-
nosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during the study at
any of the prospectively recruiting sites. Because PE are a
consequence of a DVT, there are good pathophysiological
reasons for expecting that biomarkers will have the same sen-
sitivity in PE and DVT and empirical studies of D-dimer
have shown similar sensitivity in DVT and PE (Stein et al,
2003).
We therefore undertook a cohort study augmented with
additional cases to estimate the diagnostic utility of classical
and alternative biomarkers in pregnant and puerperium
women with suspected VTE.
Methods
Study population
We prospectively recruited pregnant and postpartum women
with suspected PE or diagnosed DVT through emergency
departments and maternity units at eleven hospitals. Sus-
pected PE was defined on the basis of a clinician deciding
that imaging for PE would be required, although not all
women ultimately received imaging for PE. In a proportion
of cases the woman declined imaging or the decision that
imaging
was
required
was
reversed
by
a
more
senior
clinician. We excluded women who required life support on
arrival at hospital, who had been diagnosed with PE in the
current pregnancy before the start of the study, were unable
or unwilling to provide informed consent, aged less than
16 years or previously recruited to the study. Clinicians in
the participating hospitals prospectively identified pregnant
or postpartum woman with suspected PE considered to
require diagnostic imaging or with diagnosed DVT. They
contacted the research nurse or recruiting clinician, who pro-
vided women with study information and checked eligibility
criteria. Informed consent to participate was then sought.
Data collection
Data relating to demographics, presenting features, physiol-
ogy, previous medical and obstetric problems, any prob-
lems in the current pregnancy, results of investigations,
treatments given and adverse events were collected on a
Case Report Form. Women with suspected PE were fol-
lowed up at 30 days after recruitment by hospital record
review and questionnaire survey to record any additional
adverse events or health care. Where insufficient informa-
tion was obtained to verify status at 30 days the woman’s
primary care physician was contacted and asked to provide
details of additional investigations or events using primary
care records.
Classification of the reference standard
Women with suspected PE were classified as having VTE by
two independent assessors, blind to biomarker measure-
ments, who used a structured process to classify diagnostic
imaging results, adverse events and treatments, and thus clas-
sify all women as having VTE or not. This process was also
used to determine whether they were included in the primary
analysis or secondary analysis. Primary analysis was limited
to women who had VTE diagnosed or ruled out through
imaging, surgery or post mortem. Secondary analyses were
planned involving: (i) Inclusion of women with clinically
diagnosed
PE;
(ii)
Inclusion
of
women
with
clinically
excluded PE; (iii) Exclusion of women with sub-segmental
PE.
Sample size calculation
We aimed to recruit 250 women with suspected PE, resulting
in about five women with PE and 245 without, assuming a
prevalence of 2%. The incidence of DVT in pregnancy and
postpartum is around four times that of PE (Kane et al,
2013) so we anticipated recruiting around 20 women with
DVT during the study. Thus, the sample for the biomarker
study was expected to include 245 women with suspected PE
but negative diagnostic imaging, five women with diagnosed
PE and 20 women with diagnosed DVT (i.e. 25 with con-
firmed VTE). This would allow estimation of sensitivity or

 specificity of 90% with a standard error of about 8% and 2%
respectively.
Blood sample collection, handling and storage and
analysis
Serum and citrate blood samples were collected by a member
of
the
clinical
team
or
research
nurse/midwife
using
venepuncture, ideally whilst obtaining routine blood samples
for standard clinical assessment in diagnostic workup. Sam-
ples were collected as soon as possible but this was often
after anticoagulation had been given, as a consequence of
guidelines recommending immediate interim parenteral anti-
coagulant therapy if a diagnostic imaging cannot be carried
out immediately (National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence, 2012). Sample preparation was conducted by the
research nurse/midwife or a member of the hospital labora-
tory staff. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for
15 mins at room temperature within four hours of being
obtained. Citrate samples were further processed to obtain
platelet-free plasma.
Plasma and serum samples were stored in aliquots in
�70°C freezers at each participating hospital (with the excep-
tion of one location where a �40°C freezer was used) for the
duration on the study until all samples were transported for
analysis to Guy’s St Thomas Trust (GSTT), London, UK.
Biomarker analysis
The
biomarkers
selected
for
analysis
are
outlined
in
Table I. GSTT established normal ranges for the assays
using 20 normal plasma/serum samples (depending on the
assay), with the 99th percentile used as the top of the
normal range. The resulting normal ranges are also shown
in Table I.
Analytic techniques
Citrated plasma was utilised for all the haemostatic assays.
Serum was utilised for Troponin-1, natriuretic peptide B
(NPPB),
mid-regional
pro-atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(MRproANP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) assays.
Thrombin generation (TG) was measured by the Throm-
binoscope (ThermoElectron Corporation, Cambridge, UK).
The samples were tested in batches to minimize variability.
The frozen plasma aliquots were placed in a water bath at
37°C to thaw for 5 min. PPP-reagent low, which consists of
1 pmol/l tissue factor with 4 lmol/l phospholipids, was used
because of expected hypercoagulability. Aliquots (20 ll) of
PPP-reagent was added to each thrombin generation well
together with 80 ll of platelet-free plasma and 20 ll of fluo-
rogenic substrate and calcium (FluCa). The fluorogenic sub-
strate consisted of amino-methyl-coumarin (AMC). The
calibrator wells consisted of 80 ll platelet-free plasma, 20 ll
calibrator and 20 ll FluCa. All the reagents were from
Diagnostica Stago, Theale, UK. The analysis was conducted
in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate
(Diagnostica Stago Theale, UK) that enables the thrombin
formation to be followed in a Fluoroscan. The coefficient of
variation was 2�2% to 3�2% intra-assay and 5�1% to 16�7%
interassay for lag time, endogenous thrombin potential
(ETP), Peak and time to Peak.
The prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thrombo-
plastin time (APTT), and Clauss fibrinogen were measured
on the ACL300R (Werfen Ltd., Warrington, UK) using PT
High Sensitivity (HS) Plus reagent for the PT, HemosIL
APTT SP liquid for the APTT, and Fibrinogen C for the
Clauss fibrinogen. All reagents were purchased from Werfen
Ltd. The tests were measured according to the manufacturer’
instructions for the ACL300R analyser. The coefficient of
variation was 3�2–3�5% intra-assay and 3�6–4�2% interassay
for PT, APTT and Clauss fibrinogen.
The latex-based D-Dimer was measured on the CA660
analyser from Sysmex UK (Milton Keynes, UK) and Inno-
vance D-Dimer reagent (Sysmex UK, Milton Keynes, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient
of variation was 6�0% intra-assay and 12% interassay for the
Innovance D-Dimer.
The Zymutest D-Dimer ELISA assay (Quadratech Diag-
nostics Ltd., Epsom, UK) was used to measure the D-Dimer
levels according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The coef-
ficient of variation was 4�6% intra-assay and 10�8% interas-
say for the Zymutest D-Dimer.
The PAP ELISA (Immunodiagnostics Systems Ltd., Tyne
& Wear, UK), was used to measure the PAP according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of variation was
4�2% intra-assay and 7�3% interassay for the PAP.
The PF 1 + 2 Micro (Sysmex, Milton Keynes, UK) was
used to measure prothrombin fragment (PF) 1 + 2 according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of varia-
tion was 6�0% intra-assay and 9�0% interassay.
The Immubind soluble TF (Invitech Ltd, Cambridgeshire,
UK), was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The coefficient of variation was 6�0% intra-assay and 5�0%
interassay.
The Troponin 1 Type 3 ELISA (Bio Techne, Abingdon,
UK) was used to measure the Troponin 1 levels, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of variation
was 4�0% intra-assay and 4�6% interassay for Troponin 1.
The BNP ELISA (Bio Techne, Abingdon, UK) was used
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of
variation was 10% intra-assay and 15% interassay for the
NPPB assay.
The Human MRproANP ELISA (2B Scientific, Oxford-
shire, UK), was used to measure the MRproANP levels,
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of
variation was 8% intra-assay and 10% interassay for the
MRproANP.
The human CRP Quantikine assay (Bio Techne, Abing-
don, UK) was used to measure the CRP levels, according to
B. J. Hunt et al

 manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficient of variation was
5�5% intra-assay and 6�5% inteassay for the CRP assay.
Statistical analysis
We included all women with suspected PE or diagnosed
DVT who provided consent and an analysable blood sample.
Blood samples were analysed at GSTT, where the staff were
blinded to the clinical outcome of the patient, and the results
sent to the Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU).
The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each bio-
marker, together with the sensitivity and specificity at the
upper limit of the normal range. We then examined the
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to determine
whether there was an optimal threshold for clinical practice,
where sensitivity exceeds 95% but specificity still allows a
meaningful proportion of women without PE to have the
diagnosis excluded. Primary and secondary analyses were
undertaken on the basis of the classification of the reference
standard, as outlined above.
Results
We recruited 324 women with suspected PE between 15
February 2015 and 31 August 2016. Screening identified 35
women who were unable or unwilling to give consent and 95
who were eligible but not approached to participate. The
recruited women had a mean age of 29�3 years, mean body
mass index (BMI) 28�0 kg/m2, 204 (63%) were white British,
21 (6�5%) were in the first trimester, 110 (34�0%) in the
second, 138 (42�6%) in the third and 55 (17�0%) were
postpartum.

 Blood samples were taken from 312/324. The reasons for
failure to take a blood sample were: inability to draw blood
(7), patient refused (2), unavailability of blood handling ser-
vices (1), patient discharged before venepuncture (1) and
unknown (1). Two samples were not labelled correctly (one
from a woman in whom PE was clinically ruled out without
imaging and one with PE ruled out by negative imaging) and
were therefore not analysed, leaving 310 samples for analysis.
We recruited 18 women with diagnosed DVT, nine of
whom were recruited at Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital
Obstetric Unit (a specialist centre). A further six were eligible
for recruitment but declined to participate. The women with

 the biomarkers at the pre-defined threshold for positivity
and the threshold that optimised sensitivity (>95%) at the
expense of specificity. No biomarker had sufficient sensitivity
to rule out VTE while achieving meaningful specificity, with
the possible exception of thrombin generation (lag time)
with an AUC of 0�702 and sensitivity of 97% and specificity
of 25% at the threshold that optimised sensitivity at the
expense of specificity.
Secondary analysis
Table S1 shows the results of secondary analysis. The AUC
(with 95% confidence interval [CI]) is compared between the
primary and secondary analyses. There were no meaningful
differences.
Analysis excluding women who had received
anticoagulant
Anticoagulation with heparin is known to interfere with
many of the biomarker assays studied here. Unfractionated
heparin will prolong the APTT and thrombin time and low
molecular weight heparin may cause a slight prolongation of
the APTT. But both, by suppressing activation of activated
Factor X (FXa) and thrombin, will affect all parameters of
the thrombin generation assay and PF1 + 2 will be decreased.
Furthermore, by decreasing the generation of thrombin,
which is a major stimulator of fibrinolysis, the D-dimer and
plasmin-antiplasmin values maybe reduced.
We found that 240/328 women had received anticoagula-
tion prior to blood sampling. We therefore undertook an
unplanned analysis in which these samples were excluded.
The primary analysis involved only 66 women, of whom only
4 had VTE, so the findings are limited by small numbers.
Table IV compares the mean biomarker values between
women with and without PE. The differences observed in the
main analysis between women with and without PE disap-
peared or even reversed when those receiving anticoagulation
were removed, but this probably reflects the small numbers.
Table V shows the AUROC for each biomarker and the sen-
sitivity and specificity at pre-defined and optimal thresholds.
BNP (AUC 0�774; 95% CI 0�670–0�878), PF1 + 2 (0�795;
0�644–0�947), thrombin generation lag time (0�735; 0�531–
0�940) and troponin (0�742; 0�453–1�000) may have some
potential to rule out VTE with acceptable sensitivity but con-
fidence intervals were wide and estimates would need to be
validated in a larger cohort with VTE.
Discussion
The present study did not identify any biomarker that
would be clinically useful to either exclude or confirm sus-
pected PE in pregnancy and the puerperium. This was
despite the fact that women with VTE had significantly
higher levels of Clauss fibrinogen, both D-Dimer assays,
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes and thrombin generation
measures (lag time and time to peak) when all samples
(including those taken after anticoagulation) were included
in analysis. There was considerable overlap in biomarker
values between those with VTE and those without, which
meant that only thrombin generation (lag time) had an
AUC greater than 0�7 in the main analysis. The ROC
curves showed that there was no threshold for positivity
that would provide acceptable sensitivity while maintaining
useful specificity, with the possible exception of thrombin
generation
(lag
time),
with
sensitivity
of
97%

 specificity of 25% at a threshold that optimised sensitivity
at the expense of specificity.
Over two-thirds of the women (240/330) had received
anticoagulation prior to blood sampling. Most of the haemo-
static biomarkers were therefore potentially affected because
all forms of heparin used to treat these women (unfraction-
ated and low molecular weight) suppress coagulation activa-
tion and as a result the fibrinolytic response. Thus, thrombin
generation and PF1 + 2 are suppressed and APTT and TT
prolonged. Furthermore, thrombin is a major stimulator of
fibrinolysis, so when thrombin is reduced there will be less
increment in plasmin-antiplasmin complexes and D-dimer
levels.
We
repeated
the
analysis
excluding
those
who
had
received anticoagulation but this reduced the sample size
markedly and included only four women with VTE. No
biomarker
showed
any
association
with
VTE,
probably
reflecting lack of statistical power. BNP, PF1 + 2, thrombin
generation
(lag
time)
and
troponin
may
have
some
potential to rule out VTE with acceptable sensitivity but
confidence intervals were wide, being based on only four
cases with VTE.
This is the largest study to date of biomarkers for PE in
pregnancy and puerperium. Previous studies have shown that
the negative predictive value of D-dimer is useful when used
in combination with a low Wells score to exclude PE in the
non-pregnant population (Wells et al, 2001; Stein et al, 2003;
Crawford et al, 2016; van der Hulle et al, 2017). There is
substantial evidence that D-dimer levels increase continu-
ously during a normal pregnancy across all gestations and

 that the “normal range” outside of pregnancy cannot be
applied to pregnant women (Browne et al, 2014; Hedengran
et al, 2016). Hedengran et al (2016) also showed that the D-
dimer values in individual healthy pregnant women fluctu-
ated by more than 50% and concluded that they may not be
of value in the diagnosis of VTE during pregnancy. Thus,
although
there
is
some
evidence
that,
as
biologically
expected, D-dimer levels are increased in women with PE in
pregnancy (Kovac et al, 2010), discrimination between ‘nor-
mal’ D-dimer levels in pregnancy and increased D-dimers
due to VTE is difficult. Furthermore, we found that several
women with PE had normal D-dimer values, so using D-
dimer for its negative predictive value would result in
‘missed’ VTE.
Previous studies of D-dimer in cohorts of women with
suspected PE in pregnancy or postpartum have been limited
by small numbers. Damodaram et al (2009) (N = 37, 24 with
intermediate or high probability VQ scan) reported sensitiv-
ity and specificity of 73% and 15% respectively. O’Connor
et al (2011) [N = 125, 5 with PE on computed tomography
(CT) pulmonary angiography] reported values of 0% and
74%. Hassanin et al (2011) (N = 60, 4 with PE on CT pul-
monary angiography) reported that all women had a positive
D-dimer, and Cutts et al (2014) (N = 183, 4 with high prob-
ability VQ scan) reported that 48 out of 51 with D-dimer
measurements were positive.
This analysis has a number of limitations that need to be
considered. The DiPEP study included women from all hos-
pitals in the UK who were identified retrospectively with
diagnosed PE and women from eleven prospectively recruit-
ing hospitals who presented with suspected PE. We could
only collect blood samples from women who were prospec-
tively recruited with suspected PE so we had to supplement
the anticipated low prevalence of PE among these women by
including women with diagnosed DVT. Women with DVT
are likely to have a lower thrombotic load than women with
PE and are less likely to have cardiac strain, so biomarkers
may be less sensitive in DVT than PE. Furthermore, most of
the blood samples were taken after anticoagulation was given,
which we considered (especially from the effect on thrombin
generation) to have interfered with the biomarker assays and
reduced their diagnostic value. This is a potential conse-
quence of current guidelines (National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2012), which state that patients with
suspected PE should be given anticoagulation before diagnos-
tic testing if any delay is anticipated. We repeated the analy-
sis having excluded women who had received anticoagulation
but this resulted in a small sample size with little statistical
power to draw reliable conclusions. It is therefore possible
that biomarkers could have a potential role in diagnosing PE
in pregnancy and postpartum, but the practical difficulties
involved in taking samples before anticoagulation (both in
routine practice and in any future research studies) is likely
to limit their practical potential.
Conclusion
Biomarkers cannot currently be recommended as a way of
selecting women with suspected PE in pregnancy or postpar-
tum for imaging. In particular, D-dimer should not be rec-
ommended for use in the diagnostic work-up of PE in
pregnancy. Future research would ideally test biomarkers on
a large cohort, including a substantial number with VTE,
and involve blood sampling before anticoagulation is given,
but current guidance makes this very difficult to achieve.
Our study is reflective of this: we were only able to recruit
four women with VTE who had not received anticoagulation
before blood sampling despite recruiting from eleven sites
over 18 months.
