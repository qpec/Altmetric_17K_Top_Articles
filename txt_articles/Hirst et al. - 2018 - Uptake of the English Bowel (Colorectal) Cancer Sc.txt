Abstract
Background: The initial roll-out of the English Bowel (Colorectal) Cancer
Screening programme, during 2006 and 2009, found uptake to be low (54%) and socially
graded. The current analysis used data from 2010 to 2015 to test whether uptake is increasing
and becoming less socially graded over time.
Methods: Postcode-derived area-level uptake of 4.4 million first-time invitees, stratified by
gender and the year of the first invitation (2010e2015), was generated using the National
Bowel Cancer Screening System. Data were limited to people aged 60e64 years. Binomial
regression tested for variations in uptake by the year of invitation, gender, region, area-
based socio-economic deprivation and area-based ethnic diversity.
Results: Overall, the first-time colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake across 6 years was
52% (n Z 2,285,996/4,423,734) with a decline between 2010 and 2015 (53%, 54%, 52%,
50%, 49%, 49% respectively). Uptake continued to be socially graded between the most and
the least deprived area-level socio-economic deprivation quintiles (43% vs 57%), the most
and the least area-based ethnic diversity quintiles (41% vs 56%) and men and women (47%
vs 56%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated the effects of year, deprivation, ethnicity and
gender on uptake. The effect of deprivation was more pronounced in the most deprived area
quintile between men and women (40% vs 47%) than the least deprived area quintile (52% vs
62% respectively).

 Conclusion: We did not find evidence of change in uptake patterns in CRC screening since its
initial launch 10 years ago. The programme is unlikely to realise its full public health benefits
and is en route to widening inequalities in CRC outcomes.

1. Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC, also known as bowel cancer) is
the fourth most common cancer and the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in England [1]. The English
National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer Screening
Programme (BCSP) provides organised, population-
based screening for all adults aged 60e74 years since
2006. The screening test offered, the guaiac-based faecal
occult blood test (gFOBT), has the potential to reduce
CRC mortality by 25% [2,3]. However, the success of the
programme largely depends on uptake of the test among
the invited population.
A review of the initial roll-out between 2006 and 2009
indicated overall screening uptake of 54% with an in-
dependent effect of deprivation: 35% in the most
deprived to 61% in the least deprived area-based quintile
[4]. Since 2009, CRC and the screening programme have
received significant emphasis on the media and have
been the focus of initiatives across Clinical Commis-
sioning Groups [5] and public health campaigns [6]. In
addition, major research projects aiming to facilitate
uptake and reduce inequalities in CRC screening have
been conducted, e.g. ASCEND trials [7].
When interventions and new technologies are imple-
mented in real-life settings, their impact may differ,
dissipate or enhance over time. Diffusion of innovation
theory suggests that the adoption of new technologies
will happen over time through social interactions and
effective
dissemination
of
health
promotion
and
behaviour change interventions [8]. Thus, over time, an
increase in FOBt uptake and reduction in inequalities
would also be expected in cancer screening. The Scottish
CRC screening programme is a case in point whereby
the uptake has steadily increased since its conception [9].
Besides self-reported uptake from survey studies and
snapshots of objective uptake from several large rando-
mised controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce socio-economic
inequalities, first-time uptake of CRC screening in En-
gland has not been updated since the 2006e2009 evalu-
ation of the programme. Uptake of the first-time
invitations has emerged as a critical performance factor in
light of evidence that people who completed their test kit
at least once continued to do so in subsequent screening
rounds [10]. Indeed, many recent interventions to pro-
mote uptake were only seen to be effective among this
‘first-time’ group as opposed to those receiving repeat
invitations [11,12].
The aim of this article was to review the uptake
trends and changes in inequalities among the first-time
invitees in the English CRC screening programme be-
tween 2010 and 2015.
2. Methods
2.1. The English BCSP
Since 2006, men and women within the screening age
range (60e74) who are registered with a general
practitioner (GP) and resident in England are eligible
for screening. Invitations are sent out biennially to all
eligible people (who have not explicitly opted out of
screening) by their local programme hub. The gFOBT
kit and instructions follow a week later. The individual
is asked to collect samples from three separate bowel
motions and return the completed kit to the hub in a
prepaid envelope for processing. Repeat gFOBT kits
are
sent
out
following
a
‘spoilt
kit’,
‘technical
failure’ or an ‘unclear result’. A reminder letter is sent
after 4 weeks of non-response. If there is no response
after a further 13 weeks, the ‘screening episode’ is
closed. After a definitive abnormal result, a referral is
made to the local screening centre for diagnostic
investigations.
2.1.1. Sample
An aggregate postcode district-level data of 10,392,878
first-time BCSP invitees between 2006 and 2015 were
extracted from the Bowel Cancer Screening System.
Data included the number of unique invitations, the
number of adequately screened and the number of
positive test results at each postcode district. The data
were received in three age bands (60e64, 65e69,
70e74) for each year to ensure anonymity of the in-
dividuals at postcode districts that could have identi-
fiable number of households (n < 10). Data between
2006 and 2009 were excluded to limit the analysis to the
full roll-out from 2010 (n Z 4,646,079). Furthermore,
late entrants to the screening programme because of
the age extension from 69 to 74 from 2010, relocation
from other countries or medical reasons and all first-
time invitees aged 65 to 74 years were excluded from
the final analysis (n Z 1,323,065). In total, the final
sample to be analysed comprised 4,423,734 adults who
were invited to complete a gFOBT for the first time
between 2010 and 2015.

 2.1.2. Measures
A composite indicator of area-based socio-economic
deprivation for each postcode district was derived
using the 2011 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
[13]. The IMD uses census-derived seven deprivation
domains of income, education, employment, environ-
ment, health, crime and housing at a small-area level to
generate a scale from 4.07 (least deprived) to 68.34
(most deprived) and is defined at the level of Lower
Super Output Area (LSOA). We thus mapped the IMD
at the geographic resolution of postcode districts and
then applied the predicted value to the units in our
sample. We used the area-level proportion of ethnicity
to derive an area-level index of ethnic diversity based
on the proportion of ‘non-white’ residents in each
postcode districts (defined as all ethnic groups self-
described as other than ‘white British’, ‘white Irish’
and ‘white other’).
Postcode districts were also mapped to five English
Regions, i.e. South West and South East, London,
East of England and East Midlands, Yorkshire and
North East and West Midlands and North West. The
original data were grouped by gender and the year of
invitation from 2010, allowing an investigation of
trends up to the end of 2015. CRC screening uptake at
each postcode district was calculated by dividing the
number adequately complete screening test kits by the
number of invitees. Positivity rate was calculated by
dividing the number of abnormal test results at each
postcode district by the number of adequately com-
plete test kits.
2.2. Statistical analysis
First, unadjusted screening uptake and positivity rates
were presented by each sociodemographic, temporal and
spatial determinant. The statistical analyses consists of
several multivariate logistic regressions that looked at
the
effect
of
gender,
deprivation
score,
ethnicity,
geographical region and time on gFOBT uptake and
percentage of abnormal test results in England between
2010 and 2015. We also conducted exploratory sub-
group analysis of the same models by each geographical
region to test for the effect of gender, deprivation score,
ethnicity, geographical region and time on CRC uptake
(see Supplementary Online Materials).
The
adjusted
logistic
regression
analyses
were
weighted by the number of invitations sent out in each
postcode district. Similar to the 2006e2009 data ana-
lyses [4], we have tested different model specifications,
including linear and non-linear trends. The latter did
show difference in the results; thus, we present the linear
models for simpler interpretation (see Supplementary
Online Materials). The final models included interac-
tion terms for gender by IMD, gender by area-level
ethnic diversity, gender by year, the year by IMD and
the year by area-level ethnic diversity.
3. Results
Of the 4, 423, 734 gFOBT kits sent out to men and
women aged 60e64 years for the first-time, between
2010 and 2015, 51.68% were returned (Table 1). Uptake
among women (56.08%) was higher than that among
men (47.30%). Uptake ranged from 43.03% in the most
deprived quintile to 56.96% in the least deprived quin-
tile. Similarly, uptake varied by area-level ethnic di-
versity from 40.53% in the most ethnically diverse
quintile of areas to 56.31 in the least diverse quintile of
areas.
Fig. 1 illustrates that with every unit increase in the
deprivation
score,
the
probability
of
a
test
kit
return reduced by 0.36%. Similarly, the probability
decreased by 0.21% for every unit increase in area-based
ethnic diversity.
Among all other regions, London had the lowest
uptake rate (42.33%) (See Fig. 2). However, each region
showed a significant socio-economic gradient in uptake
(see supplementary appendix for subgroup analysis).
Our analysis of differences over time showed a
reduction in CRC screening uptake between 2010 and

 2015 (53%, 54%, 52%, 50%, 49% and 49% respectively).
Multivariate analysis with linear terms indicated an as-
sociation between uptake and year of invitation which is
moderated by gender, IMD and area-level ethnic di-
versity (Table 2). Fig. 3 shows that for each successive
year (measured as a continuous variable), the proba-
bility to return the test kit reduces by 0.78%.
Since 2010, the reduction in men’s uptake from
48.79% to 44.28% has been more pronounced than the
reduction in women’s uptake from 57.31% to 53.93%
(Table 3). Similarly, there has been a larger reduction in
uptake in the least deprived IMD quintile from 57.61%
to 53.95%, whereas the difference is minimal in the most
deprived IMD quintile from 43.85% to 41.09%. Finally,
the reduction in uptake from 2010 to 2015 is more
apparent in the least ethnically diverse quintile (from
57.60% to 53.54%) than in the most diverse quintile
(from 40.69% to 38.79%).
There was a negative correlation between CRC up-
take and the proportion of abnormal test results
(r Z �0.324) (Fig. 4). Of the 2,285,995 people who were
adequately screened, 1.93% (n Z 44,208) had an
abnormal test result. The proportion of individuals with
abnormal results was higher among men (2.43%) than
women (1.51%) and among people living in most
deprived IMD quintile (2.48%) compared with those in
the least deprived IMD quintile (1.63%). Additionally,
there were regional differences in abnormality with
London having the highest proportion of abnormal re-
sults compared with all other regions (Table 1). Having
an abnormal test result was independently associated
with gender, IMD, area-based ethnic diversity, region
and year (Table 2).
4. Discussion
First-time gFOBT uptake remains low and socially
graded. Unlike the Scottish programme [9] that found
an overall increase (albeit not significant in the first
prevalent round) (9), we have observed a small but sig-
nificant decline particularly from 2011 to 2014.
The results, therefore, do not suggest that barriers to
CRC screening have been reduced over time by the
diffusion of innovation. However, after the recent evi-
dence from pilot studies testing a new and improved
type of home-based test, there is a suggestion that a
structural change such as the implementation of the
faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is more promising to
eliminate at least some of the root causes of the low
uptake [14e16]. The largest improvement in CRC
screening by far was obtained by using FIT as the
screening tool as opposed to gFOBT with an 11.4%
increase in uptake among previous non-responders and
with approximately 7% overall increase in uptake across
all IMD quintiles [17].
Regional differences in uptake, in particular the
persistent and strong social gradient in London, are very
striking considering the vast majority of initiatives and
interventions taken place there; for example, a text
message trial [12], many community engagement initia-
tives with different ethnic groups [18] and national
ASCEND trials [7]. Further research using spatial
classification based on population density and location

 characteristics (urban vs. rural) may provide further
insights into the better understanding of inequalities in
London which are not usually a target of epidemiolog-
ical research.
Furthermore, the social gradient in positivity has
been observed previously in the initial analysis of the
gFOBT pilot outcomes which adds further emphasis on
the
importance
of
reducing
inequalities
in
CRC
screening uptake [19,20]. What was particularly inter-
esting in the present study was the inverse association
between uptake and positivity. Future studies should
explore potential mechanisms for this relationship, e.g.
probe whether in low uptake areas people use CRC
screening to follow-up their existing symptoms.
There were some limitations to our analyses. The
data were at postcode district level which meant that the
average IMD scores for postcode districts may not be
directly representative of the population living in those
areas, e.g. a postcode district in London may include the
least and the most deprived postcodes. Thus, it can be
assumed that the area-level analysis is underestimating
the actual impact of socio-economic deprivation.
While IMD scores are useful to understand in-
equalities, future research could benefit from using geo-
segmentation tools such as those used in marketing and
consumer science. Furthermore, we were limited to
using annual rather than quarterly or monthly data
extractions which limits our ability to observe seasonal
fluctuations or the short-term versus long-term impact
of interventions on CRC screening uptake.
In conclusion, this study provides an update on pre-
viously reported CRC screening uptake and confirms
that the inequalities in CRC screening are persistent and

 could be widening. In light of the positive impact on
uptake and inequalities associated with FIT which were
observed in the recent pilot study [17], there is an urgent
need to implement this change to avoid further exacer-
bation of social inequalities in screening uptake and its
long-term consequences on CRC outcomes.
