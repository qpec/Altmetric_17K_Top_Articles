Aims
It is recommended to perform atrial fibrillation ablation with continuous anticoagulation. Continuous apixaban has
not been tested.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We compared continuous apixaban (5mg b.i.d.) to vitamin K antagonists (VKA, international normalized ratio 2–3) in
atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke a prospective, open, multi-centre study with blinded outcome assessment.
Primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2–5).
A high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study quantified acute brain lesions. Cognitive function
was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at end of follow-up. Overall, 674 patients
(median age 64years, 33% female, 42% non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 49 sites) were randomized; 633 received
study drug and underwent ablation; 335 undertook MRI (25 sites, 323 analysable scans). The primary outcome was
observed in 22/318 patients randomized to apixaban, and in 23/315 randomized to VKA {difference -0.38% [90% con-
fidence interval (CI) -4.0%, 3.3%], non-inferiority P = 0.0002 at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075}, including 2
(0.3%) deaths, 2 (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions were found in a similar
number of patients in each arm [apixaban 44/162 (27.2%); VKA 40/161 (24.8%); P = 0.64]. Cognitive function
increased at the end of follow-up (median 1 MoCA unit; P = 0.005) without differences between study groups.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Continuous apixaban is safe and effective in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation at risk of stroke with respect
to bleeding, stroke, and cognitive function. Further research is needed to reduce ablation-related acute brain lesions.

Introduction
Catheter ablation is an effective1–3 and increasingly used component
of rhythm control therapy to improve symptoms in patients with
atrial fibrillation.4–6 Atrial fibrillation ablation is associated with a risk
of stroke and major bleeding.4–6 Continuous oral anticoagulation
using vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin can reduce the
risk of embolic events to <1% when combined with peri-procedural
heparin.7 Therefore, continuous oral anticoagulation is recom-
mended in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.4,6,7 One
randomized trial comparing rivaroxaban to warfarin in 218 patients
found similar bleeding rates with rivaroxaban compared to warfarin:
21/114 (18.4%) patients with bleeding on rivaroxaban, 18/104
(17.3%) patients with bleeding on VKA, one patient with stroke.8
Another trial randomizing 635 atrial fibrillation ablation patients to
dabigatran or VKA found 59/318 (18.6%) patients with bleeding on
dabigatran, 54/317 (17%) patients with bleeding on VKA, and one pa-
tient with transient ischaemic attack.9 Continuous apixaban has not
been compared to VKA in atrial fibrillation ablation patients.
Atrial fibrillation ablation, unlike other ablation procedures, has
been associated with declining cognitive function 90 days after the
procedure, raising concerns about peri-procedural protection of the
brain.10,11 Furthermore, acute brain lesions without corresponding
neurological symptoms are detected in ca. 25% of patients undergo-
ing atrial fibrillation ablation by high-resolution diffusion-weighted
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a sequence that detects
acute cytotoxic brain oedema.12–15 Cognitive function and acute
brain lesions have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials of
patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.
Objectives
Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial comparing continuous
apixaban to continuous VKA therapy in patients at risk of stroke
undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation, including assessment of cognitive
function in all patients and MRI-detected brain lesions in a sub-study.
Trial design
Anticoagulation using the direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban during
Atrial Fibrillation catheter Ablation: comparison to VKA therapy
(AXAFA – AFNET 5) was an investigator-initiated, prospective,
parallel-group, randomized, open, blinded outcome assessment study

comparing continuous apixaban therapy to VKA therapy. Details
of the study design have been published.16 AXAFA – AFNET 5 was
conducted in Europe and North America. The trial sponsor was
AFNET, Mu
¨nster, Germany (www.kompetenznetz-vorhofflimmern.de).
AXAFA – AFNET 5 was designed by the steering committee in cooper-
ation with AFNET and conducted in accordance with the declaration of
Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good
Clinical Practice Guidelines (ICH-GCP). The protocol was approved by
ethics review boards at all institutions. The Clinical Research Institute
(CRI, Munich, Germany) executed the study in cooperation with
the steering committee and the sponsor. Data collection and entry
were performed using the MARVINV
R eCRF system.16–18 An independ-
ent steering committee and an independent data and safety monitoring
board guided the trial. All serious adverse events were adjudicated by
an independent endpoint review committee blind to study group and
international normalized ratio (INR) values. The Duke Clinical Research
Institute served as the statistical core and performed the statistical ana-
lyses for the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness
of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. This manu-
script was written by the authors.
Study population
AXAFA – AFNET 5 enrolled patients scheduled for a first atrial fibril-
lation ablation. Patients had at least one established stroke risk factor
(age>
_ 75 years, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, or prior stroke).
The full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published (see
Table 1).16
Treatment
At baseline, clinical parameters, stroke risk, heart rhythm, symptoms,
quality-of-life (EQ5D, SF-12,1 and Karnofsky performance status18),
and cognitive function [Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test
(MoCA)]19 were assessed. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1
to apixaban or VKA therapy. Randomization was stratified by study
site and AF type (paroxysmal vs. persistent or long-standing persist-
ent). The randomization scheme was generated via a computer pro-
gramme using permuted block of a random size.
Apixaban
Patients randomized to apixaban received 5 mg b.i.d. throughout the
study period. The apixaban dose was reduced to 2.5 mg b.i.d. if two
or more of the following characteristics were present: age >
_80years,
body
weight
<
_60kg,
or
serum
creatinine
level
>
_1.5 mg/dL
(133lmol/L).16,20 Apixaban was continued during the ablation pro-
cedure without interruption, including on the morning of ablation.
Continuous anticoagulation in this group was defined as having taken
all but one apixaban dose per week based on pill count.

Vitamin K antagonist
Patients randomized to VKA were treated using the locally used
VKA, e.g. warfarin, phenprocoumon, or acenocoumarol,21 prescribed
and dispensed following local routine. Vitamin K antagonist therapy
was monitored by INR measurements; a minimum of three INR
measurements was mandatory prior to ablation. The last INR prior
to ablation needed to be 1.8 or higher. The time in the therapeutic
range was calculated by the Rosendaal method.22 Continuous antico-
agulation in this group was defined by therapeutic INR (INR >
_ 2) in all
INR measurements 30days prior to catheter ablation.
All patients underwent follow-up visits at the time of the ablation
procedure and 3 months after ablation. At the ablation visit, continu-
ous anticoagulation for at least 30 days prior to ablation was assessed
and an ECG performed. Transoesophageal echocardiography could
be used following local practice. Interrupted anticoagulation required
rescheduling of the ablation for 30days unless (i) atrial thrombi were
excluded by transoesophageal echocardiogram and (ii) effective anti-
coagulation was demonstrated prior to starting the ablation proced-
ure by either taking at least two doses of apixaban (patients
randomized to apixaban), or by an INR value >

randomized to VKA). A heparin bolus (100IU/kg body weight) was
required prior to or directly after transseptal puncture. The ablation
procedure followed local practice and current guidelines.4–6 The
protocol encouraged pulmonary vein isolation, the use of irrigated
tip catheters, and flushing of all left atrial sheaths. Activated clotting
time (ACT) was kept >300s throughout the procedure. Activated
clotting time measurements, details of the ablation technology used,
delivered energy, procedure time, rhythm at beginning and end of
procedure, and the need for cardioversion during the procedure
were collected. An echocardiogram (transthoracic or intracardiac)
was mandated directly after ablation to detect pericardial effusion.
At the 3 month visit, cognitive function and quality-of-life were re-
assessed, a 24 h Holter ECG was performed, and study medication
was returned. A final phone call to assess serious adverse events was
performed 30days after discontinuation of study drug.
Magnetic resonance imaging sub-study
Centres participating in the MRI sub-study (n= 25) offered brain MRI
to all eligible study patients. A brain MRI was performed within 48h
after the ablation procedure. The MRI sequences were designed to de-
tect all acute brain lesions, and to differentiate acute from chronic le-
sions. An imaging charta defined the MRI and adjudication workflow
and brain MRI requirements (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
The following MRI sequences were used: T2*-weighted imaging to
screen for intracranial haemorrhage, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (post-processed) to

assess acute brain infarction, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
(FLAIR) to investigate the age of brain lesions.14,15 Diffusion-weighted
imaging was conducted using a slice thickness of 2.5–3mm (high-reso-
lution DWI) to enhance the sensitivity of MRI for small lesions.14,15
Images failing the immediate quality check were repeated whenever
feasible. All images were independently analysed by two experienced
neuro-radiologists blinded to treatment allocation.
Study outcomes
The primary outcome measured from randomization was the compos-
ite of all-cause death, stroke, or major bleeding among modified
intention-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized pa-
tients who received study drug and underwent catheter ablation.
Safety was assessed in all randomized patients receiving study drug
(safety population). Sensitivity analyses were performed in all
randomized patients (ITT). Another sensitivity analysis compared
events during the peri-ablation period defined from ablation to 7 days
after the procedure.9 Major bleeding was defined according to the
Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC >
_ 2).23 All bleeding
events were centrally adjudicated according to the BARC, ISTH, and
TIMI classifications.23,24
Secondary outcomes included time from randomization to ablation
(ITT population), nights spent in hospital after ablation, ACT during
ablation (summarized as median, 25th, 75th percentiles, and number
of ACT measurements within the target range), all bleeding events,
tamponade, need for transfusion, and changes in quality-of-life and
cognitive function compared to baseline. In the MRI sub-study, the
prevalence and number of MRI-detected acute brain lesions were
compared between groups.
Adverse events
All serious adverse events were collected, defined as adverse events
that caused or prolonged hospitalization, caused disability or incap-
acity, were life-threatening, resulted in death or were important med-
ical events. In addition, pregnancy, overdose, and cancer diagnosed
after randomization were defined as serious adverse events. As
AXAFA – AFNET 5 compared approved anticoagulants within their
indications, non-serious adverse events were generally not reported,
but those of special interest were defined and assessed. These com-
prised ablation-related complications including non-serious bleeding.
The protocol encouraged brain imaging in patients who developed
neurological abnormalities after the ablation procedure. All events
from randomization to 3 months after index ablation procedure or
to premature study termination were analysed.
Statistical analysis
We estimated that a total of 650 patients (325 per group) were
needed to detect a pre-specified margin of 7.5% (absolute difference)
with 80% power using upper one-sided 95% confidence interval (i.e.
two-sided 90% CI) with 3% attrition rate. The Farrington and
Manning score test was used to compute sample size and power.
The primary non-inferiority hypothesis was tested in the ablation
population (mITT) using the method of Farrington and Manning
score test with the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075. In addition,
a time-to-event analysis using Cox proportional hazards model with
a relative margin of 1.44 was conducted. A multivariable Cox propor-
tional hazards model controlling for the baseline risk factors of age,
sex, weight, type of atrial fibrillation, and the CHADS2 factors was con-
ducted. Changes in quality-of-life and cognitive function were assessed

at 3months compared to baseline using the EQ-5D and SF-12 ques-
tionnaires, MoCA, and Karnofsky scale. Changes in quality-of-life were
compared by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models including the
treatment arms as an indicator variable and the baseline quality-of-life
variables as covariates. To accrue sufficient events for a formal non-
inferiority analysis, AXAFA – AFNET 5 was exclusively conducted in
patients at risk of stroke (Table 1) and counted bleeding events follow-
ing the relatively broad BARC classification.23 An independent data
and safety monitoring board monitored the study for safety. The
Haybittle–Peto boundary was used as stopping rule guidance.
Descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables were
summarized as means (SDs) and medians (25th, 75th percentiles),
and numbers (percentages), respectively. Comparisons between
continuous variables were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test or two-sample t-test depending on normality; comparisons be-
tween nominal variables were performed using the Pearson’s v2 test
or Fisher’s exact test, depending on expected cell sizes. All analyses
were two-sided and tested at the nominal 0.05 significance level. No
adjustment was made for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were
performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Trial participants
AXAFA – AFNET 5 randomized 674 patients across 49 sites in 9
countries from February 2015 to April 2017. Overall, 633 patients
took study drug and underwent atrial fibrillation ablation (mITT, abla-
tion set, Figure 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics were well
balanced between groups (Table 1). Transoesophageal echocardiog-
raphy was used in 549/633 (86.7%) patients. All or all but one apixa-
ban doses per week were taken by 307/318 (97%) patients
randomized to apixaban in the ablation set. The median time in thera-
peutic range in the 315 patients randomized to VKA in the ablation
set was 84% (71, 97%). Time from randomization to ablation was not
different between study groups (Table 1).
Primary outcome
Primary outcome events (BARC 2–5 bleeding, stroke, or death)
were observed in 22/318 (6.9%) patients randomized to apixaban,
and in 23/315 (7.3%) patients randomized to VKA therapy in the abla-
tion set. Four events were classified as TIMI major bleeding, and 24
events are ISTH major bleeding (Table 3). Two patients died: one pa-
tient randomized to VKA, female, age 70, hypertensive, last blood
pressure 156/76, last INR 2.6, underwent pacemaker implantation
8days after ablation and experienced a massive intracerebral haem-
orrhage. Another patient randomized to apixaban, male, age 69, with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and
chronic obstructive lung disease, was found dead in his bed 19days
after ablation without identifiable cause of death upon autopsy. Two
patients randomized to apixaban had a stroke. Both had persistent
AF and underwent transoesophageal echocardiogram. One patient,
male, age 63, hypertensive, ACT 236–398 s, developed slurred
speech with matching MRI lesion on the day of radiofrequency pul-
monary vein isolation that fully resolved. Another patient, male, age
52, ACT 301–400 s, hypertensive, developed weakness of the right
arm with paraesthesia of the right leg after cryoballoon pulmonary

vein isolation that persisted beyond hospital discharge. Tamponade
occurred in 2 (apixaban) and 5 (VKA) patients and was managed by
pericardial drainage and administration of protamine and vitamin K.
One patient with tamponade in each study group received blood
transfusions. Anticoagulants were continued in five patients with tam-
ponade, and paused for 4 days in one patient randomized to apixa-
ban, and for 8 days in one patient randomized to VKA. All patients
were discharged from hospital and attended the 3 months follow-up
(n = 6) or an end of study visit (n = 1).
Apixaban was non-inferior to VKA based on the non-inferiority
margin of 7.5% (a difference of -0.38%, 90% CI -4.0%, -3.3%, non-
inferiority P = 0.0002). Apixaban was also non-inferior to VKA among
all randomized patients as assessed by Cox proportional hazards
model comparison between treatment groups using a relative non-
inferiority margin of 1.44 (equivalent to 7.5% absolute; hazard
ratio = 0.88, 90% CI 0.55, 1.41; P = 0.042, Figure 2). There was no stat-
istical interaction between clinical stroke and bleeding risk factors
and treatment groups (Figure 3).
Secondary outcome parameters
There was no difference in time to ablation or nights spent in hospital
after the ablation between groups (Table 4). As expected, the last
INR prior to ablation and ACTs achieved during ablation were lower

in the patients randomized to apixaban (Table 4). Quality-of-life as as-
sessed by the physical component of SF-12 [þ2.5 (-2.1, 8.1) units]
and Karnofsky scale [þ10 (0, 10)] improved during the study without
differences between study groups (Table 4). At least mild cognitive
dysfunction was found in 188/619 (30.4%) of the patients at baseline
(pre-defined as MoCA < 26, Table 2). At the end of follow-up, MoCA
increased by a median of þ1.0 (-1.0, 2.0) unit without differences be-
tween study groups, and only 141/607 patients (7.2% fewer than at
baseline) had mild cognitive impairment (Table 4).
Magnetic resonance imaging sub-study
Acute brain MRI was performed in 335 patients across 25 centres.
Clinical characteristics of the sub-study population were not different
from the main study population, with the exception of a lower me-
dian weight in patients undergoing MRI [85.0 kg (74.5, 96.0)] com-
pared
to
non-MRI
patients
[90.0kg
(80.0,
103.0)].
Clinical
characteristics were well balanced between MRI sub-study treatment
groups. There were 323 analysable MRIs. Acute brain MRI lesions
(Figure 4) were found in 44/162 (27.2%) patients randomized to apix-
aban, and in 40/161 (24.8%) patients randomized to VKA (P = 0.635),
with very similar distribution of lesions between random groups
(Table 5). Cognitive function at the end of follow-up was not different
in patients with or without acute brain lesions (MoCA 27.1± 2.7 in
239 patients without MRI lesions, 27.1± 2.8 in 84 patients with MRI
lesions, P = 0.91).
Discussion
AXAFA – AFNET 5 demonstrated that continuous anticoagulation
with apixaban is a safe and effective alternative to VKA in patients at
risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. AXAFA – AFNET
5 observed four TIMI major bleeding events in 633 patients (0.6%,
Table 3) compared to one event in 248 patients in VENTURE-AF
(0.4%).8 AXAFA – AFNET 5 observed 24 patients with ISTH major
bleeding events (3.8%, Table 3) compared to 27 events in 635 patients
in RE-CIRCUIT (4.3%).9 The numerical differences in ISTH major
bleeding rates between AXAFA – AFNET 5 [apixaban 10 patients
(3.1%); VKA 14 patients (4.4%); Table 3] and RE-CIRCUIT [dabigatran
5 patients (1.6%); VKA 22 patients (6.9%)]9 could be due to chance
variations in outcomes, differences in risk profile between the
AXAFA – AFNET 5 and RE-CIRCUIT study populations, and due to
the high time in therapeutic range in the VKA group in AXAFA –
AFNET 5 (median TTR 84%). AXAFA – AFNET 5 included only pa-
tients with stroke risk factors, resulting in a mean CHA2DS2VASc
score of 2.4 and a population that was 4–5 years older than in the
published controlled trials in atrial fibrillation ablation.1–3,8,9 Despite
the higher stroke risk, we observed few strokes: AXAFA – AFNET 5
found 2 strokes in 633 patients (0.3%), compared to 1 stroke in 248
patients in VENTURE-AF (0.4%),8 and 1 TIA in 635 patients in RE-
CIRCUIT (0.2%).9 Equally, mortality was low (0.3%) and similar to
VENTURE-AF (0.4%),8 RE-CIRCUIT (0%),9 and the EORP AF abla-
tion registry (0.2%).25

Figure 4 Examples of acute brain lesions detected in the brain magnetic resonance imaging sub-study. Acute brain lesions (arrows in A, C, E, G) are
found by high-resolution diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging without corresponding lesions in the fluid-attenuated inversion recov-
ery images (arrows in B, D, F, H). Shown are representative lesions in two patients randomized to apixaban (A/B; C/D) and in two patients randomized
to vitamin K antagonist (E/F; G/H). The fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images also detected chronic white matter lesions [asterisks (*) in F].

AXAFA – AFNET 5 included 86 patients on acenocoumarol and
102 patients on phenprocoumon, 186 patients (29%) undergoing
cryoablation,3 and 84 patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation
without transoesophageal echocardiography without safety signals,
providing some reassurance that these common patterns of clinical
practice can be used on continuous apixaban or VKA therapy.4–6,26
The secondary outcomes observed in AXAFA – AFNET5 under-
pin the safety of continuous apixaban in atrial fibrillation ablation:
time to ablation was not different between groups and quality-of-life
and cognitive function improved equally in both study groups after
ablation. High-resolution diffusion-weighted brain MRI detected
acute brain lesions at the expected rate (�25%)12,14,15 without
differences between study groups. Continuous anticoagulation does
not fully prevent acute brain lesions, which can be caused by debris
dislodging from ablation wounds, air emboli, or small thrombi.27,28
Procedural improvements are desirable to reduce acute brain lesions
during atrial fibrillation ablation.29 Further analyses of the AXAFA –
AFNET 5 data set may shed more light on risk factors for acute brain
lesions in patients undergoing AF ablation on continuous anticoagula-
tion. One prior study found reduced cognitive function 90 days after
atrial fibrillation ablation on interrupted warfarin therapy compared
to baseline.10 Reassuringly, cognitive function improved at the end of
AXAFA – AFNET 5 without differences between study groups.
Limitations
AXAFA – AFNET 5 was an open study, but with blinded outcome as-
sessment. The non-inferoirity margin was wide. The findings are con-
sistent
with
prior
studies
with
continuous
dabigatran
and
rivaroxaban. While AXAFA – AFNET 5 was the first study comparing
cognitive function after atrial fibrillation ablation in a controlled trial,
the
assessment
was
limited
to
global
cognitive
function.
Differentiation between acute and chronic lesions was done by using
an accepted combination of MRI sequences.14,15
Conclusions
Continuous apixaban therapy is a safe and effective alternative to
VKA in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation
with respect to stroke, major bleeding, cognitive function, and MRI-
detected acute brain lesions.
