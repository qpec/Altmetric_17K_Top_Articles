Objective. To compare the efficacy and safety of
ABT-494, a novel selective JAK-1 inhibitor, with placebo
in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and an inadequate response or intolerance to at
least 1 anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent.
Methods. In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-ranging study, 276 RA patients receiv-
ing a stable dose of methotrexate (MTX) who had
previously received treatment with at least 1 anti-TNF
agent were randomized equally to receive immediate-
release ABT-494 at 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily or
matching placebo twice daily. The primary end point
was the proportion of patients meeting the American
College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria
(achieving an ACR20 response) at week 12.
Results. At week 12, significantly more patients
receiving ABT-494 (53–71%) than those receiving placebo
(34%) achieved an ACR20 response (by nonresponder
imputation analysis) (P < 0.05), with a dose-response
relationship among all ABT-494 doses (P < 0.001).
ACR50 and ACR70 response rates were significantly
higher in those receiving ABT-494 (36–42% and 22–
26%, respectively) than in those receiving placebo (16%
and 4%, respectively). Changes from baseline in the
Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive
protein level (DAS28-CRP) were significantly greater
for all doses of ABT-494 than for placebo (P £ 0.01).
Onset of action of ABT-494 was rapid, with significant
differences from placebo at week 2 both in ACR20 re-
sponse rate (for 12 and 18 mg) and in change in the
DAS28-CRP (P < 0.001 for 6–18 mg). The most frequent
adverse events (AEs) were headache, nausea, upper
respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection.
Infection rates were higher at higher doses of ABT-494,
but no infections were serious. No deaths were reported
among those receiving ABT-494.

 Conclusion. In
patients
with
an
inadequate
response or intolerance to anti-TNF agents, ABT-494
added to MTX showed rapid, dose-dependent improve-
ments in RA signs and symptoms, with safety and toler-
ability similar to those of other drugs of this class. No
new AEs were identified.
Biologic agents are highly effective therapies that
have greatly improved the standard of care for patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there remains
a need for new treatments, as not all patients experience
sufficient disease control, and some lose responses over
time (1,2). The inflammatory response may be modu-
lated by inhibition of the JAKs, which are involved in
the signaling pathways for several proinflammatory
cytokines (3). The JAK family is composed of 4
members: JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and Tyk-2. These cyto-
plasmic tyrosine kinases are associated with membrane
cytokine receptors, such as common g-chain receptors
and the gp130 transmembrane proteins (4).
A small-molecule, nonselective JAK inhibitor,
tofacitinib, has recently emerged in the RA treatment
paradigm, showing efficacy in different spectra of RA
patients: methotrexate (MTX)–naive patients, inade-
quate responders to MTX, and inadequate responders
to anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents (5–9).
Baricitinib, a JAK-1/JAK-2 inhibitor, also showed prom-
ising results in an RA phase III program (10–12). How-
ever, there are some safety concerns with this class of
JAK inhibitors, particularly involving infections (includ-
ing
herpes
zoster),
malignancies,
and
hematologic
adverse events (AEs) (5,11–13).
ABT-494 is a selective JAK-1 inhibitor being
developed for the treatment of adult patients with mod-
erately to severely active RA. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
the interferons (IFNs) are known to signal primarily
through JAK-1, and based on the proven action of
tocilizumab in RA, which functions via IL-6 inhibition,
JAK-1 is thought to play an important role in RA dis-
ease pathophysiology. In biochemical assays, ABT-494
is ;74-fold more selective for JAK-1 than for JAK-2
(which is involved in erythropoiesis) and ;58-fold more
selective for JAK-1 than for JAK-3 (which is involved in
immunosurveillance) (14). The enhanced selectivity of
ABT-494 for JAK-1 over JAK-2 and JAK-3 (13) may
offer an improved benefit–risk profile in patients with
RA. In phase I trials, ABT-494 was found to be safe and
well-tolerated up to multiple doses of 24 mg twice daily
using the immediate release formulation in healthy vol-
unteers and in subjects with RA. ABT-494 exposure was
dose proportional in the evaluated multiple dose range
(3–24 mg twice daily) (15).
The safety and efficacy of ABT-494 were evalu-
ated in 2 phase IIb, dose-ranging, randomized, placebo-
controlled
studies
in
patients
with
moderately
to
severely active RA. This report presents the results
from 1 of these 2 studies, BALANCE I, which evaluated
the safety and efficacy of 4 doses of ABT-494 compared
with placebo in patients who had had intolerance to at
least 1 anti-TNF therapy or for whom at least 1 anti-
TNF therapy had failed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients. Adult men and women age $18 years diag-
nosed as having RA and fulfilling either the American College
of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised classification criteria
(16) or the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010
classification criteria (17) were enrolled in the study. Active
RA was defined as having $6 swollen joints (based on a 66-
joint count), $6 tender joints (based on a 68-joint count), and
either a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level
above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 mg/liter) or sero-
positivity for both rheumatoid factor and anti–cyclic citrul-
linated peptide. Eligible patients must have continued to have
active RA despite being treated with at least 1 anti-TNF bio-
logic agent for $3 months, or they must have discontinued
anti-TNF biologic therapy because of intolerance or toxicity.
In addition, patients with prior exposure to non–anti-TNF bio-
logic therapy were allowed to enroll as long as at least 1 anti-
TNF biologic agent had failed to be effective for treating their
disease. All biologic agents had to be washed out prior to ran-
domization ($4 weeks for etanercept; $8 weeks for adalimu-
mab, infliximab, certolizumab, and golimumab; .8 weeks for
abatacept; .12 weeks for tocilizumab; and .1 year for rituxi-
mab). Patients must have been receiving a stable dose (7.5–
25 mg/week) of MTX (oral or parenteral) for $4 weeks prior
to study initiation. Key exclusion criteria were prior exposure
to a JAK inhibitor or need for any immunosuppressive agent
other than MTX. Subjects with serum aspartate transaminase
(AST) levels or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels .1.53
ULN, absolute neutrophil counts ,1,200/ml, or absolute lym-
phocyte counts ,750/ml at screening were excluded.
Study design and treatment. BALANCE I was a
phase IIb, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
placebo-controlled study conducted at 123 sites, enrolling
patients in the US (176 patients, 64%), Puerto Rico (11
patients, 4%), Australia and New Zealand (6 patients, 2%),
Western Europe including Belgium, Spain, and Great Britain
(29 patients, 11%), and Eastern Europe including Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland (54 patients, 20%). The study
was initiated in October 2013 and was completed by the last
patient in July 2015.
Patients were randomized equally to receive oral
immediate-release doses of ABT-494 twice daily at 3 mg, 6
mg, 12 mg, or 18 mg, or matching placebo twice daily, for 12
weeks. Randomization was performed centrally, according to
a blocked randomization schedule previously generated by the
AbbVie
statistics
department,
by
investigators
enrolling
patients via an interactive voice response system. Patients,
caregivers, investigators, joint assessors, and the AbbVie study
team were blinded to the treatment administered. Placebo and
2868
KREMER ET AL
 ABT-494 capsules were identical in appearance. Patients
should have been taking an oral supplement of folic acid
(or equivalent) from 4 weeks prior to baseline and throughout
the study. Patients were required to continue stable doses of
MTX and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetamino-
phen, or oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone at
#10 mg/day).
The study was conducted in accordance with the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, applicable
regulations, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics
committee or institutional review board. All patients provided
written informed consent before participating in any study-
related procedures.
Assessments. The primary efficacy end point was the
proportion of patients meeting the ACR 20% improvement
criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) (18) at week 12. Sec-
ondary end points included the proportions of patients achiev-
ing an ACR50/ACR70 response and the proportion of
patients achieving a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (19)
using the CRP (DAS28-CRP) of #3.2 or ,2.6 at week 12.
Among the other end points were the proportion of patients
achieving low disease activity or clinical remission based on
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (20) criteria (CDAI
score #10 indicates low disease activity; CDAI score #2.8
indicates clinical remission), change in the DAS28-CRP,
change in individual components of the ACR core set of
disease activity measures (21), and the proportion of patients
achieving a minimum clinically important difference (MCID)
of 20.22 on the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability
index (HAQ DI) (22–24). Changes in the Simplified Disease
Activity Index (SDAI) (25) were calculated post hoc. A post
hoc analysis was performed to determine the proportion of
patients who had a sustained ACR20 response, defined as
meeting the ACR 20% improvement criteria at every visit (at
weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12).
Laboratory analyses were conducted by a central labo-
ratory. After study completion and database lock, the central
laboratory informed AbbVie that one lot of the reagent used
to detect hsCRP had expired early (Roche lot 604450) and
resulted in underreporting by 3–13% (,0.1–0.4 mg/liter) of a
subset of samples with levels below the ULN (16% of week 12
samples). Sensitivity analyses using a larger-than-expected cor-
rection factor (20% inflation) on the affected samples were
performed (for ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates, response
rates for low disease activity and clinical remission according to the
DAS28-CRP, and hsCRP level over time as a continuous variable).
Safety was evaluated at each scheduled visit during
treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug on
the basis of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, and results
of laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinaly-
sis). Adverse events were coded according to the Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities (version 17.1). Descriptions
of AE severity and postbaseline changes in laboratory test
results were based on the Rheumatology Common Toxicity
Criteria version 2.0, developed by the Outcome Measures in
Rheumatology Drug Safety Working Group (26). An indepen-
dent committee of experts adjudicated potential cardiovascu-
lar events in a blinded manner in accordance with the
cardiovascular adjudication committee charter.

2869
 Statistical analysis. All efficacy analyses were con-
ducted in the modified intent-to-treat population, which con-
sisted of all randomized patients who received $1 dose of
study drug. For ACR response rates, the last observation car-
ried forward (LOCF) method was the primary missing data
imputation method. Nonresponder imputation (NRI) was
used to assess the robustness of the results and is also
reported. For continuous end points including the DAS28-
CRP, LOCF imputation of missing data was implemented;
NRI is reported for binary end points. Binary end points
including ACR response rates were analyzed using a chi-
square test with normal approximation when comparing each
ABT-494 treatment group to the placebo group. Continuous
end points were analyzed using an analysis of covariance
model with treatment group as a factor and baseline measure-
ment as the covariate. The multiple comparison procedure
and modeling method was implemented to detect any nonflat
dose-response relationship by evaluating several nonlinear
dose-response models at the same time. P values were not cor-
rected for multiple comparisons. Assuming ACR20 response
rates of 25% in the placebo group and 55% in any ABT-494
treatment group, a sample size of 50 patients per group (250
patients total) was estimated to provide at least 80% power to
detect a 30% difference in response rates between the placebo
group and an ABT-494 treatment group when using a 1-sided
test with an alpha level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Patient
disposition
and
baseline
character-
istics. A total of 276 patients were randomized; all
received their intended treatment. The overall study
completion rate was 88% (see Supplementary Figure 1,
available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39801/
abstract). Baseline patient characteristics and disease
activity were generally similar among treatment groups
(Table 1). The mean 6 SD disease duration since RA
diagnosis was 11.9 6 9.4 years. Seventy-two percent of
patients had prior exposure to only 1 anti-TNF agent
and 28% to at least 2 anti-TNF agents, and 20% of
patients were exposed to non–anti-TNF biologic agents
in addition to at least 1 anti-TNF agent. At baseline,
patients had a mean 6 SD of 17.6 6 10.4 swollen joints
(of 66 joints) and 27.6 6 15.3 tender joints (of 68 joints);
60% of patients had an elevated hsCRP level, and the
mean 6 SD DAS28-CRP was 5.8 6 0.9.
Efficacy. The primary analysis based on the
LOCF method revealed that compared with 35% of

 ACR20 response rates at week 12 were similar for
patients who had previously received 1 anti-TNF agent
and those who had previously received at least 2 anti-
TNF agents (by NRI analysis) (Figure 1B). In all
patients, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates with ABT-
494 doses of $6 mg were significantly higher than those
with placebo (by NRI analysis) (Figure 1A).
Significant differences versus placebo in ACR20
response rates were observed at the first postbaseline
assessment (week 2) in patients treated with ABT-494
at 12 and 18 mg (by NRI analysis) (P # 0.007) (Figure
2A); the maximum response rate (71%) was observed
with the 12 mg dose by week 8 and plateaued thereafter.
Starting at week 4, ACR50 response rates were signifi-
cantly greater with ABT-494 at $6 mg than with pla-
cebo; the maximum response rate (42%) was observed
with 18 mg by week 8 and plateaued thereafter (by NRI
analysis) (Figure 2B). Higher ACR70 response rates
versus placebo in the ABT-494 treatment groups were
observed beginning at week 6, with a peak response of
up to 26% at week 12 (by NRI analysis) (Figure 2C). A
sustained ACR20 response (by NRI analysis; at every
visit from week 2 to week 12) was achieved by 13%,
22%, 40%, and 27% of patients receiving ABT-494 at 3,
6, 12, and 18 mg, respectively, versus 4% of patients
receiving placebo. Significant improvements versus pla-
cebo in the DAS28-CRP occurred at the week 2 assess-
ment with ABT-494 at $6 mg (by LOCF method)
(P , 0.001) (Figure 2D). Starting at week 4 and thereaf-
ter, significant improvements versus placebo in the
DAS28-CRP were observed at all doses of ABT-494.
Significant differences versus placebo in CDAI and
SDAI scores were also observed from week 2 onward
with ABT-494 at $6 mg (by LOCF method) (see
Supplementary Figures 2A and F, http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39801/abstract). Changes in
hsCRP levels over time are presented in Supplemen-
tary Figure 2C.
A higher percentage of patients receiving ABT-
494 (any dose) than those receiving placebo achieved a
DAS28-CRP of #3.2 or ,2.6 at week 12 (by NRI analy-
sis) (Figure 2E), with the difference being statistically
significant at 12 mg (for a DAS28-CRP of #3.2, 49%
versus 25% [P , 0.01]; for a DAS28-CRP of ,2.6, 33%
versus 13% [P , 0.05]). Similarly, a higher percentage of
patients receiving ABT-494 (any dose) than those
receiving placebo met the CDAI criteria for low disease
activity or clinical remission at week 12 (by NRI analy-
sis) (Figure 2F). At week 12, mean changes from base-
line in each disease activity measure of the ACR core
set were significantly greater with ABT-494 at 12 mg
than with placebo (Table 2). In addition, a greater pro-
portion of patients achieved the MCID for the HAQ DI
score with ABT-494 at $6 mg (58–64%) than with pla-
cebo (44%). Sensitivity analyses for correction of
affected hsCRP samples demonstrated the following:
the population hsCRP value over time was predicted
not to change; there was a potential shift of 1 subject
from responder to nonresponder in the placebo arm for
ACR20 response (from 34% to 32%) and for a DAS28-

 CRP of #3.2 in the 12 mg ABT-494 arm (from 49% to
47%).
Safety. The percentage of patients with any
treatment-emergent AE was numerically higher for
ABT-494 than for placebo and increased in a dose-
dependent manner with ABT-494 at 6, 12, and 18 mg
(Table 3). However, the majority of reported AEs were
considered mild to moderate in severity. The most com-
monly observed AEs were headache, nausea, upper
respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection.
The incidences of SAEs and severe AEs were low, with-
out an apparent dose-response relationship (Table 3).
Five patients treated with ABT-494 reported 7 SAEs (at
3 mg, 1 with pancreatitis and 1 with pulmonary embo-
lism; at 6 mg, 1 with pulmonary embolism and deep vein
thrombosis and 1 with transient ischemic attack [TIA]
and benign prostate hyperplasia; at 18 mg, 1 with acute
respiratory failure). One patient receiving placebo expe-
rienced an SAE of bronchiectasis.
The overall infection rates were similar for those
treated with 3 mg ABT-494, 6 mg ABT-494, and placebo
(20%, 22%, and 23%, respectively), but were higher for
those treated with 12 mg and 18 mg ABT-494 (40% and
38%, respectively). No serious infections were reported
in any of the ABT-494 treatment groups. Herpes zoster
occurred in 2 patients in the placebo group (4%) and in
3 patients who received ABT-494 (1 patient [2%] each
in the 3, 12, and 18 mg groups; each case was isolated to
a single dermatome). Two reported events of hepatic
disorders in the 18 mg group and 1 reported event in
the placebo group were attributed to increased levels of
transaminases or bilirubin; patients were asymptomatic,
none of the events was serious, and none led to discon-
tinuation from the study. The external cardiovascular
adjudication committee adjudicated 1 case of TIA in 1
patient receiving 6 mg ABT-494 (reported as moderate
by the investigator). One patient in the 6 mg group had
1 event each of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma. There was 1 case of opportunistic infection
(oral candidiasis) in 1 patient receiving 12 mg ABT-494.
No deaths were reported during the study period.
Elevations of serum transaminases (AST or
ALT) were transient with no apparent dose relationship
and did not result in early discontinuation from the
study. Of the patients with normal ALT or AST levels at
baseline, 12 of 208 (5.8%) receiving ABT-494 had ele-
vated ALT levels (.13 ULN) at least twice, and 28 of
206 (13.6%) had elevated AST levels (.13 ULN) at
least twice, compared with 2% and 6%, respectively, of
patients receiving placebo. There were no cases of grade
4 AST or ALT abnormalities (see Supplementary Table
1,
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39801/
abstract). Fifteen of 201 patients (7.5%) receiving ABT-
494 who had normal creatinine levels at baseline experi-
enced elevated creatinine levels (.13 ULN) at least
twice, compared with none receiving placebo. A single
case of grade 3 creatinine abnormality was observed in
those
receiving
18
mg
ABT-494.
Dose-dependent
increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were
observed (see Supplementary Figures 3C and D, http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39801/abstract);
however, the ratios of LDL cholesterol to HDL choles-
terol remained unchanged from baseline (see Supple-
mentary Table 2, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.
1002/art.39801/abstract).
Decreases in mean hemoglobin levels from base-
line were observed in a dose-dependent manner with
ABT-494, although mean hemoglobin levels remained
within the normal range across all dose groups during
the study (Figure 3). Of the patients with normal hemo-
globin levels at baseline, 23 of 219 (10.5%) who were
treated with ABT-494 experienced decreased hemoglo-
bin levels (grade 2 or above) at least twice, with the
majority of those patients receiving 12 mg or 18 mg
ABT-494. Eight of 219 patients (3.7%) had a maximum
grade 4 decrease (reduction of $3.0 gm/dl) in hemoglo-
bin level. One patient discontinued the study early due
to a reported AE of low hemoglobin (reduction of 2.6
gm/dl). However, at the time of discontinuation, the
hemoglobin level (13.2 gm/dl) was within the normal
range (baseline level of 15.8 gm/dl).

matoid arthritis receiving ABT-494 at 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily

 Decreases in mean numbers of circulating lym-
phocytes and neutrophils were also observed (see Sup-
plementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 3, http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39801/abstract),
and 1 patient discontinued study drug due to leukope-
nia. Two patients receiving 18 mg ABT-494 had a grade
4 lymphocyte reduction (Supplementary Table 1); one
was reported to have a vaginal yeast infection, and the
other was reported to have herpes zoster around the
time of lymphocyte reduction. One patient each in
the 3 mg and 6 mg ABT-494 groups had a grade 4
lymphocyte reduction; however, the lymphocyte reduc-
tions did not coincide with infections. One patient
receiving 12 mg ABT-494 had a grade 4 neutrophil
reduction; no infections were reported at the time of
neutropenia.

decrease was seen in patients treated with ABT-494
(215.8 6 25.3%, 218.3 6 47.4%, 228.0 6 37.3%, and
242.6 6 31.7% at 3, 6, 12, and 18 mg, respectively;
P , 0.001 for all comparisons).
DISCUSSION
Although the use of biologic agents for the treat-
ment of RA is widespread and established, there is an
unmet medical need for those patients who do not
respond adequately or have intolerance to currently
available
biologic
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs. To date, several JAK inhibitors (6–8,10–12) have
demonstrated significant clinical improvement in RA,
firmly establishing that cytokines such as IL-6 and the
IFNs, which signal through the JAK pathway, are
important contributors to the pathology of RA. ABT-
494 is a novel JAK-1 inhibitor designed to inhibit JAK-1
with greater selectivity compared with JAK-2 and JAK-
3. In this study, we tested a broad dose range (up to
18 mg twice daily) of immediate-release ABT-494 to
determine the dose(s) providing an optimal balance of
safety and efficacy in patients with an inadequate
response or intolerance to anti-TNF biologic therapies.
This is the first phase II study with any JAK inhib-
itor in patients for whom anti-TNF therapy has failed. At
all doses, ABT-494 demonstrated rapid and robust effi-
cacy, as shown by significantly greater improvements in
clinical and functional outcomes compared with placebo.
The onset of improvement was noted as early as 2 weeks
after ABT-494 treatment (first postbaseline assessment),
with up to 58% of patients achieving an ACR20
response. In addition, the peak ACR20, ACR50, and
ACR70 response rates were observed before week 12.
This is in contrast to the 3–6 months needed for many
biologic therapies to achieve maximum efficacy (27–29),
and comparable with observations for other JAK inhibi-
tors, such as baricitinib and tofacitinib, in patients with
an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents (6,11).
Although the sample size was small, the ACR20 response
rate was comparable between patients who had previ-
ously received $2 anti-TNF agents and those who had
previously
received
only
1
anti-TNF
agent.
The
underreporting of a minority of hsCRP values was pre-
dicted to have no significant impact on efficacy parame-
ters and the overall conclusions for the study.
Although they produce significant clinical im-
provement in different spectra of RA patients, there are
safety concerns with JAK inhibitors; these predominantly
involve impairment of the body’s ability to fight infections,
viral reactivation, and alteration of hematopoietic homeo-
stasis, the last of which could be associated with anemia.
Increases in total cholesterol, elevation of transaminase
and serum creatinine levels, and decreases in neutrophil
counts have also been observed (6,30,31).
The rationale for developing selective JAK-1
inhibitors such as ABT-494 is to minimize the dose-
limiting side effects of pan-JAK inhibition, such as
infections and anemia, which presumably occur due to
inhibition
of
multiple
isoforms
of
JAKs,
while
maintaining or increasing efficacy through selectively
inhibiting JAK-1. In the current study, a broad range of
doses of ABT-494 was tested to assess the safety and
efficacy of ABT-494 in vivo. Overall, ABT-494 demon-
strated a safety and tolerability profile consistent with
observations of other JAK inhibitors tested in patients
with RA. There were no serious infections, although the
proportion of overall infections was higher at the 2
highest doses of ABT-494 (12 mg and 18 mg).
There was a dose-dependent reduction in hemo-
globin levels. At the 12 mg and 18 mg doses, there was a
modest decrease in mean hemoglobin levels by week 12,
although the mean hemoglobin levels remained within
the normal range. However, with higher exposures, the
selectivity for JAK-1 over JAK-2 in vivo may have been
reduced, as there were more cases of hemoglobin reduc-
tion at higher doses than at lower doses.
Circulating NK cells, which function as a critical
mediator of host immunity against malignancy and
infections, were measured as a pharmacodynamic read-
out of IL-15 inhibition; IL-15 is required for NK cell
homeostasis. With increasing doses of ABT-494, there
ABT-494 IN PATIENTS WITH RA AND INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANTI-TNF THERAPY
2875
 was a greater mean percent decrease in NK cell counts.
At the maximally efficacious dose in this population,
12 mg, NK cells decreased by 28% from baseline, with
proportionally smaller decreases in NK cells observed at
lower doses. Given the fact that IL-15 signaling involves
a heterodimer of JAK-1 and JAK-3, this was to be
expected at higher doses of ABT-494. It is unclear how
much each of the heterodimeric components (JAK-1
and JAK-3) contributes to overall IL-15 signaling. How-
ever, it is possible that at higher exposure to ABT-494,
the threshold for in vivo selectivity for JAK-1 compared
with JAK-3 is lower in the context of the JAK-1/JAK-3
heterodimer. The significance of NK cell reduction,
especially what is considered a clinically meaningful
reduction in NK cells for predicting clinical events (i.e.,
onset of viral reactivation), is currently unknown. A sig-
nificant association between decreasing nadir NK cell
counts and treated infection rates with tofacitinib treat-
ment was observed (32). No association of reduced NK
cells with onset of herpes zoster was observed in the
BALANCE I study, although the sample size and event
numbers were very small.
As reported with other JAK inhibitors (6,30), a
dose-dependent elevation of LDL cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol levels was observed with ABT-494; however,
the ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol
remained unchanged. More detailed analyses of lipid
particle concentrations and compositions are underway.
The mean changes in other laboratory parameters of
interest (serum transaminase levels and total white
blood cells, neutrophils, or lymphocytes) were not
influenced by increasing doses of ABT-494, with only 1
patient discontinuing the study prematurely due to leu-
kopenia. Overall, the impact of ABT-494 on laboratory
parameters would be better evaluated in longer studies
and larger study populations.
Limitations of the study included a relatively
small sample size. The duration of the study was 12
weeks, which was sufficient to meet the objectives of this
phase IIb study and observe the timing of onset of
improvement, although it precluded the assessment of
longer term outcomes. The study population was
restricted to patients with intolerance or an inadequate
response to anti-TNF biologic therapies, and its geo-
graphic diversity was limited, as 64% of enrolled
patients were from the US.
In summary, the results of the BALANCE I
phase IIb study demonstrated safety and efficacy of a
selective JAK-1 inhibitor, ABT-494, in a refractory pop-
ulation of RA patients who had an inadequate response
or intolerance to anti-TNF biologic therapies. Along
with data from the companion BALANCE II study (in
patients with an inadequate response to MTX) (33),
these results informed the selection of doses with opti-
mal balance of efficacy and safety for further evaluation
in phase III trials. Larger phase III trials are underway
to confirm the selectivity of ABT-494 against JAK-1 and
to determine whether this translates to an improved
benefit–risk profile across a wide spectrum of RA
patients.
