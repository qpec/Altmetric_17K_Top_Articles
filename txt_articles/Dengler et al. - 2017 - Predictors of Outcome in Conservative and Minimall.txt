Study Design. A pooled patient-level analysis of two multi-
center randomized controlled trials and one multicenter single-
arm prospective trial.
Objective. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of
outcome of conservative and minimally invasive surgical man-
agement of pain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ).
Summary of Background Data. Three recently published
prospective trials have shown that minimally invasive SIJ
fusion (SIJF) using triangular titanium implants produces better
outcomes than conservative management for patients with pain
originating from the SIJ. Due to limitations in individual trial
sample size, analyses of predictors of treatment outcome were not
conducted.
Methods. We pooled individual patient data from the three trials
and used random effects models with multivariate regression
analysis to identify predictors for treatment outcome separately for
conservative and minimally invasive surgical treatment. Outcome
was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry
Disability Index (ODI), and EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D).
Results. We included 423 patients assigned to either nonsurgi-
cal management (NSM, n ¼ 97) or SIJF (n ¼ 326) between 2013
and 2015. The reduction in SIJ pain was 37.9 points larger [95%
confidence interval (95% CI) 32.5–43.4, P < 0.0001] in the SIJF
group than in the NSM group. Similarly, the improvement in
ODI was 18.3 points larger (95% CI 14.3–22.4), P < 0.0001). In
NSM, we found no predictors of outcome. In SIJF, a reduced
improvement in outcome was predicted by smoking (P ¼ 0.030),
opioid use (P ¼ 0.017), lower patient age (P ¼ 0.008), and lower
duration of SIJ pain (P ¼ 0.028).
Conclusion. Our results support the view that SIJF leads to
better treatment outcome than conservative management of SIJ
pain and that a higher margin of improvement can be predicted
in nonsmokers, nonopioid users, and patients of increased age
and with longer pain duration.

SURGERY
 Surgical treatments for SIJ dysfunction include open
and minimally invasive SIJ fusion (SIJF). Most published
evidence on minimally invasive SIJF reports use of triangular
titanium implants (TTIs), including retrospective case
series,16–27 a combined multicenter case series,28 com-
parative case series against open SIJF,29–31 systematic
reviews,32–34 and three prospective multicenter clinical
trials.35–37 Even though previously published results from
the three prospective trials have shown concordant improve-
ments in pain, disability and quality of life after SIJF
compared with nonsurgical management (NSM), the num-
ber of patients included in each of those trials was too low to
identify potential predictors of clinical outcomes both for
conservative management and SIJF. We therefore conducted
a patient-level pooled analysis using the data from all three
prospective multicenter TTI clinical trials to determine
whether patient characteristics predicted clinical outcomes
after either surgical or nonsurgical treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
The three pooled trials are prospective clinical trials of SIJF
with TTI. Trial characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Literature searches using Medline, Embase, and Clinical-
Trials.gov [primary search terms: sacroiliac joint AND
(arthrodesis OR fusion)] revealed no other ongoing pro-
spective TTI trials.
INSITE, a prospective 2-year multicenter randomized
controlled trial (RCT) conducted at 19 centers in the US,28
included 148 patients with diagnosed SIJ dysfunction unre-
sponsive to at least 6 months of conservative care. Patients
were included between January 2013 and May 2014. Diag-
nosis was based on history, physical examination tests,38 and
a �50% decrease in SIJ pain after image-guided joint block
with local anesthetic.39–42 Subjects were randomized in a 2:1
fashion toeither SIJFaspreviouslydescribed35orNSM. NSM
included anti-inflammatory and opioid pain medications,
physical therapy, intra-articular SIJ steroid injections, and
radiofrequency neurotomy, delivered serially as needed to
manage pain and disability. Assessments included SIJ pain
using a visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI),43 EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D),44 and Short Form-36 (SF-
36).45 In the NSM group, crossover to surgical care was
allowed only after the 6-month visit was complete.
iMIA, a prospective multicenter randomized controlled
clinical trial (n ¼ 103), was conducted at nine European
centers.36 Patients were included between June 2013 and
May 2015. Key differences between iMIA and INSITE
include 1) iMIA used 1:1 randomization, 2) nonsurgical
treatment in iMIA included only physical therapy per Euro-
pean guidelines,46 3) iMIA included Zung Depression
Scale47 but not SF-36, and 4) iMIA included a functional
test48 and self-reported walking distance.
SIFI is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial
(n ¼ 172) conducted at 26 centers in the US.37 Patients were
included between August 2012 and December 2013. All
subjects underwent SIJF. SIFI subjects underwent computed
tomography
(CT)
scan
at
1
year;
otherwise,
study
parameters were identical to INSITE.
Surgical Revisions and Wound Infections
Adverse events, defined broadly using an international
clinical trial standard, were collected continuously during
the
trials.
Events
of
interest
included
wound-related
problems and early and late surgical revisions of the
target SIJ.
Statistical Analysis
We applied random effects models, performed using the
nlme49 and lme450 R51 packages, that used appropriate
covariance structures to take into account individual patient
characteristics (fixed effects) as well as repeated measures
and site-level factors (random effects). Both univariate and
multivariate regression techniques were used, including
interaction terms. Outcomes assessed in a single trial only
were not evaluated. As both RCTs allowed crossover from
NSM to SIJF after month 6, the treatment effect in the
NSM cohorts was estimated using only 1, 3, and 6-month
data. Models regarding patient age and pain duration used
values grouped by quartiles. Opioid use was defined as
continuous daily opioid use, including oral medication
and/or transdermal application.
RESULTS
Four hundred twenty-three patients in three trials were
analyzed, including 326 who underwent SIJF and 97 who
underwent NSM. Two-year follow-up data were available
from the two completed US studies; 1-year data are cur-
rently available from the European RCT.
Baseline Characteristics
In the three pooled trials, mean (SD) age was 50.4 (11.2)
years, most (70.4%) subjects were women, and pain
duration averaged 5.4 years (SD 6.7, Table 2). Mean base-
line SIJ pain (80 points, SD 12.5) and ODI scores (56 points,
SD 12.7) were high. Quality of life was diminished (mean
EQ-5D Time Trade-off Index (TTO) of 0.43, SD 0.20 and
mean SF-36 Physical Component Summary of 31, SD 5.9).
Body mass index, baseline pain scores, the proportion using
opioids, and the proportion with prior SIJ steroid injections
were higher in the two US studies; smoking was less com-
mon in US patients. In the two RCTs, baseline character-
istics (age, body mass index, pain duration, baseline pain,
and ODI and QOL scores) were distributed equally across
groups. Current smoking and a history of prior RF ablation
were more common in the SIJF group (P ¼ 0.0100 and
0.0197, respectively). Operative characteristics were similar
across studies: Operating time averaged 48 minutes and
three implants were used in most cases, with no significant
variation in the mean number of implants used across
studies (P ¼ 0.970). Mean hospital length of stay was longer
in the European RCT (3.6 days) versus US studies (0.8 days,
P < 0.0001).

 Treatment Effect
Taking into account all assessments before month 6, the
adjusted reduction in SIJ pain was 37.9 points larger [95%
confidence interval (95% CI) 32.5–43.4, P < 0.0001] in the
SIJF groups versus the NSM groups. Similarly, the improve-
ment in ODI was 18.3 points larger (95% CI 14.3–22.4),
P < 0.0001) and the improvement in EQ-5D TTO index was
0.24 points larger (95% CI 0.17–0.30, P < 0.0001). Exten-
sive modeling was used to evaluate for effect modifiers (i.e.,
interaction terms), but none were found.
Predictors of Treatment Outcome
Table 3 and Figure 1 show associations of clinical charac-
teristics with treatment outcomes for NSM and SIJF. In the
NSM cohort (n ¼ 97), none of the examined variables
showed a significant association with pain, disability
(ODI), or quality of life (EQ-5D) at 6 months of follow-
up. For the SIJF group (n ¼ 326), predictors of treatment
outcome were assessed over the 24-month follow-up period.
For SIJ pain, we found that older age [effect size (ES) 9.1
points; P ¼ 0.0080] and longer pain duration (ES 7.7 points;
P ¼ 0.0282) were associated with larger improvements after
SIJF, while current smokers (ES 5.9 points; P ¼ 0.0299) and
patients using opioids at baseline (ES 6.4 points; P ¼ 0.0166)
had smaller responses. For disability (ODI), improvements
after SIJ were smaller among current smokers (ES 4.4 points;
P ¼ 0.0292) and those using opioids at baseline (ES 6.1
points; P ¼ 0.0029). For EQ-5D, only longest pain duration
was predictive of statistically significantly greater improve-
ments after SIJF (ES 0.105 points; P ¼ 0.0035).

 Surgical Revisions and Wound Infections
Of the 326 patients undergoing SIJF, 1.2% (n ¼ 4) under-
went early surgical revision (<1 month). In each of those
patients, one of the implants had been inadvertently placed
into a sacral neuroforamen, causing postoperative neuro-
pathic symptoms and requiring surgical repositioning of the
implant. Late revision surgery (>1 month), performed in
2.8% (n ¼ 9), was typically done to address pain, sometimes
associated with poor implant position, with placement of
additional implants in most cases. Signs of wound infection
occurred in eight subjects overall, including deep wound
infection requiring surgical washout (n ¼ 1), drainage from
wound treated with antibiotics (n ¼ 3), redness treated with
antibiotics (n ¼ 3), and slow healing treated with antibiotics
(n ¼ 1). No subject had bony infection or implant removal
for infection.
DISCUSSION
Combining data from three separate prospective studies
allowed us to assess in more detail which patient groups
may have a better chance of benefitting from conservative or
minimallyinvasivesurgicaltreatmentofchronicSIJpain.Our
principal findings are that, within the patient cohort under-
going SIJF, two factors (current smoking and opioid use at
baseline) predicted lower and two factors (higher patient age
and longer duration of SIJ pain) predicted higher degrees of
improvement in SIJ pain and pain-related disability. Older
age also predicted higher improvements in quality of life (EQ-
5D TTO). Even though one may argue that each of these
differences may be of relatively modest clinical significance, it
is important to note that they all reached statistical signifi-
cance.Moreover,subgroupswith smallerimprovementsafter
SIJF, such as smokers or opioid users, still displayed larger
and clinically important improvements compared with
patients in the NSM cohort. Another important difference
between SIJF and NSM was that within NSM, we found no
predictors of treatment outcome at all.
In the SIJF cohort, smokers showed reduced pain
response (by 5.9 VAS points) and higher disability levels
(by 4.4 ODI points) than nonsmokers. These results are
consistent with previously published data describing a sig-
nificant negative association between smoking and spine
surgery outcomes.52
Patients using opioids at baseline also benefitted less from
SIJF (by 6.4 VAS points and by 6.1 ODI points) when
compared with opioid-naive patients. These findings add
to the somewhat controversial discussion regarding opioids
as part of LBP treatment overall, as current evidence
suggests an absence of long-term superiority of opioids over
placebo in the treatment of LBP, which has led some authors
to call for avoiding any opioid use in LBP treatment.53,54
Opioid use may even increase the risk of recurrence of
already existing depression as well as the risk of developing
new onset depression.55
In the SIJF cohort, patients younger than 45 years dis-
played a reduced pain response (by 9.1 VAS points) com-
pared with patients in the oldest age quartile. Whether
young age reflects a true biologic effect or is a marker for
more severe disability is not known, but our results suggest
that SIJF should be discussed with greater caution in
younger patients. However, our findings are in line with
previously published reports on patients undergoing lumbar
fusion surgery, which found that older patients were not at a
higher risk of poor treatment outcomes.56

 Within the SIJF cohort, we observed that patients in the
third quartile of pain duration (3–6 years) had a larger
improvement in pain. Also, patients in the fourth pain
duration quartile (>6 years) had larger improvements in
quality of life (EQ-5D). The significance of this finding is
uncertain and is therefore the most difficult to integrate into
decision-making during patient selection. However, as
increased pain duration has been described to be a risk
factor for poor treatment outcome in LBF,57 our contrasting
results provide reassurance that in patients with long-stand-
ing pain originating from the SIJ, SIJF is a reasonable option.
Procedure-related safety was reasonable in our analysis,
with a low rate of wound problems and a low surgical
revision rate consistent with a previous report in the com-
mercial setting.58
Combined with retrospective case series,16–31 our find-
ings provide high-level evidence for the safety and effective-
ness of SIJF with TTI and support its use as a relevant
treatment choice in patients with SIJ dysfunction unrespon-
sive to NSM.
Minimally invasive SIJF is gaining increasing attention
in spine surgery. Two different surgical approaches to SIJF
have been reported. In the dorsal approach, which was not
used in the trials evaluated in our analysis, a midline dorsal
incision is made with dissection to the dorsal ligamentous
recess followed by device placement. Stabilization is
achieved through ligamentotaxis. Published outcomes
from this approach are scant.59 In the lateral-to-medial
approach, which was used in the trials analyzed by us,
the implants transfix the SIJ. Published TTI studies
include the three trials we summarized as well as retro-
spective case series,16–28 including some with 3-,26 4-,22
and 5-year24 follow-up, and comparative case series versus
open SIJF.29–31 Three additional case series report good
outcomes with hollow modular anchor screws60–62 and a
recent small case series suggests good outcomes with an
additional transfixing device.63 Minimally invasive SIJF
using TTI was shown to not only improve the LBP com-
ponent of SIJ pain but also the referred leg pain com-
ponent.64 Because of differences in approaches, device
design, acute impact on the joint, and long-term fusion
strategies, it is unclear whether results from our analysis
apply to other laterally transfixing devices or to devices
placed via a dorsal approach.
The main strength of our analysis is that all three pooled
studies were of high quality, used standardized enrollment
and diagnostic criteria, and were rigorously monitored.
The two RCTs were designed to directly estimate the
clinical value of surgery compared with a nonsurgical
treatment control group. However, certain limitations
should be mentioned. First, because the study protocols
of iMIA and INSITE allowed crossover from nonsurgical
to surgical treatment after 6 months and the majority of
patients made use of this option, long-term information
for NSM (beyond 6 months) was not evaluated in our
analysis. Nevertheless, while crossover prevented calcu-
lation of treatment ES after month 6, it allowed us to
completely avoid early crossover, which has complicated
interpretation
of
other
surgery
versus
nonsurgery
trials.65,66 Another limitation of our analysis is that all
trials included were not blinded and therefore patient-
specific expectations cannot be ruled out as potential
confounders to overall outcome results. Nevertheless,
the large observed ES suggest a true underlying effect.
Finally, the fact that all three trials included in our analysis
were industry-sponsored may be viewed by some as a
limitation. However, industry-sponsorship is the norm
in spine surgery device trials.67
CONCLUSION
Our pooled analysis suggests that the success of conservative
management of SIJ pain is limited and difficult to predict. In
contrast, improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life
with minimally invasive SIJF were large; moreover, the
extent of improvement was modestly associated with smok-
ing, opioid use, patient age, and duration of pain. Pro-
cedure-related safety of SIJF was reasonable.
Key Points
Recent evidence suggests that minimally invasive
surgical treatment of pain originating from the
sacroiliac joint (SIJ) may be a relevant alternative to
frequently unsuccessful conservative management.
We pooled data from the only existing prospective
trials using triangular titanium implants to treat SIJ
pain to identify predictors of treatment outcome.
Minimally
invasive
surgical
management
produced significantly better outcome than
conservative management.
We found no predictors of outcome for
conservative management of SIJ pain.
For minimally invasive surgical management, we
found that smoking and opioid use predicted
poorer outcome, while higher patient age and
longer duration of pain were associated with
better outcome.
