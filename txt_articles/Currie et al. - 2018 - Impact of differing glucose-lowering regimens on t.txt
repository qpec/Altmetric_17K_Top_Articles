Aims: To characterize survival in relation to achieved glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level
within alternative glucose-lowering regimens with differing risks of hypoglycaemia.
Methods: Data were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the corre-
sponding Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed glucose-lowering
therapy in monotherapy or dual therapy with metformin between 2004 and 2013 were identi-
fied. Risk of all-cause mortality within treatment cohorts was evaluated using the Cox propor-
tional hazards model, introducing mean HbA1c as a quarterly updated, time-dependent
covariable.
Results: There were 6646 deaths in a total follow-up period of 374 591 years. Survival for
lower (<7%) vs moderate HbA1c levels (≥7%, <8.5%) differed by cohort: metformin, adjusted
hazard ratio (aHR) 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.12); sulphonylurea, aHR 1.11 (95%
CI 0.99-1.25); insulin, aHR 1.47 (95% CI 1.25-1.72); combined regimens with low hypoglycae-
mia risk, aHR 1.02 (95% CI 0.94-1.10); and combined regimens with higher hypoglycaemia risk
excluding insulin, aHR 1.24 (95% CI 1.13-1.35) and including insulin, aHR 1.28 (95% CI 1.18-
1.37). Higher HbA1c levels were associated with increased mortality in regimens with low
hypoglycaemia risk. Post hoc analysis by HbA1c deciles revealed an elevated risk of all-cause
mortality for the lowest deciles across all cohorts, but particularly in those regimens associated
with hypoglycaemia. High HbA1c was associated with no difference, or a small increase in mor-
tality risk in regimens with increased risk of hypoglycaemia.
Conclusions: The pattern of mortality risk across the range of HbA1c differed by glucose-
lowering regimen. Lower HbA1c was associated with increased mortality risk compared with
moderate control, especially in those regimens associated with hypoglycaemia. High levels of
HbA1c were associated with the expected elevated mortality risk in regimens with low
hypoglycaemia risk.

INTRODUCTION
Treatment guidelines for diabetes generally recommend therapeutic
strategies that aim for normalization or near-normalization of glucose
control.1 These guidelines are based, in large part, on convincing evi-
dence from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in type
1 diabetes and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study in type 2 diabetes,
which demonstrated that improved glucose control reduced the risk
of microvascular complications.2,3
Whilst reductions in macrovascular complications and mortality
have been observed in long-term follow-up of intensively treated
subjects in these studies,2,4 data from subsequent randomized clinical

 trials suggested no benefit, or an increase in mortality with intensive
glucose
control.5,6
Furthermore,
observational
studies
generally
report increased mortality in those with low glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c).7 Thus, the optimum target for glucose control in patients
with diabetes remains uncertain. This uncertainty is further compli-
cated
because
both
randomized
trials8,9
and
observational
studies7,10–20,25,26 have been unable to demonstrate a consistent pat-
tern of association between levels of glucose control and adverse
outcome, nor to explain why this may be the case.
One potentially influential explanation for an absence of improved
survival in these studies, and the inconsistent pattern of association
across the glucose control range relates to the impact of hypoglycaemia
on cardiovascular event risk. Both randomized trials and observational
studies included therapies that cause hypoglycaemia: primarily insulin
and sulphonylureas; therefore, determination of optimal glucose con-
trol may be complicated by potentially competing influences of
improved hyperglycaemia vs inducement of hypoglycaemia. Severe
hypoglycaemia is associated with increased cardiovascular death and
all-cause mortality,23 but, in turn, hypoglycaemia is associated with
other factors, for instance, exposure to exogenous insulin and, less
often, sulphonylureas. The recent introduction of glucose-lowering
drugs that are not associated with hypoglycaemia provided an opportu-
nity to dissect out these competing mechanisms. The aim of the pre-
sent study was to characterize the risk of all-cause mortality across the
range of achieved HbA1c targets, and to determine whether this pat-
tern varied in alternative regimens with differing risk of hypoglycaemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
| Data source
This was a retrospective cohort study using primary care data from
the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked, where
available, to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The CPRD is a pro-
prietary data source containing clinically rich, pseudonymized data
collected in a non-interventional manner. These data include demo-
graphics, consultations, medical history, test results and prescriptions.
The CPRD is broadly representative of the UK population and con-
tains records from approximately 14 million people. No patient con-
sent was required for this study.
2.2
| Patient selection
Patients with type 2 diabetes were identified between January 2004
and December 2013, with follow-up to January 2015. Only practices
with research-quality data were included. Patients were selected if
they had been treated with glucose-lowering therapy, prescribed as
monotherapy or dual therapy in combination with metformin. A mini-
mum wash-in period of 1 year from the date of registration or the up-
to-standard date for the practice was required in order to identify
treatment initiation. The up-to-standard date is the date at which the
practice is considered to have been supplying continuous high-quality
data suitable for research. The study index date was defined as the
first exposure to a relevant regimen; a patient could potentially
contribute more than one regimen to the study. Exclusion criteria
included diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, <91 days’ follow-up time, and
absence of HbA1c observations during the follow-up period.
2.3
| Treatment exposure
Six cohorts were selected, a priori, to provide insight into the overall
impact of lower HbA1c and to differentiate between treatments that
have a higher or a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Two treatment cohorts
were composed of glucose-lowering therapies with a low risk of hypo-
glycaemia: the metformin monotherapy group; and a composite group
treated
with
metformin
monotherapy
and
acarbose,
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists,
sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors or thiazolidinediones, as
monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Four treatment
cohorts comprised patients receiving glucose-lowering therapies asso-
ciated with a higher hypoglycaemia risk: sulphonylurea monotherapy;
insulin monotherapy; a composite group of regimens comprising sul-
phonylureas and meglitinides prescribed as monotherapy or in combi-
nation with metformin but excluding insulin; and a composite group of
regimens comprising sulphonylureas, meglitinides and insulin pre-
scribed as monotherapy or with metformin. Treatment was considered
to have been discontinued if there was a gap of >100 days between
prescriptions for the same class of glucose-lowering therapy. Patients
were followed until the earliest of their date of death, date of regimen
change, end of recorded data or the last prescription for the glucose-
lowering therapy of interest plus 90 days.
2.4
| Outcome
The outcome was all-cause mortality.
2.5
| Achieved HbA1c categorization
Based on the pattern of association elucidated in a previous study7 and
treatment guidelines,1 the following glucose-control categories were
selected a priori: lower HbA1c, <7%; moderate HbA1c, ≥7% < 8.5%;
high HbA1c, ≥8.5% < 9.5%; and very high HbA1c, ≥9.5%.
2.6
| Validation of the hypoglycaemia risk
assumption
To validate that the prespecified treatment cohorts varied in hypogly-
caemia risk as predicted, the hospital admission rate relating to hypo-
glycaemia was determined for each treatment cohort in those
patients who were eligible for linkage to HES.
2.7
| Statistical methods
Crude event rates were calculated for each treatment cohort and
reported as events per 1000 person-years of exposure. The relative rate
was determined as the ratio of the respective crude event rates. Mid-P
confidence intervals (CIs)24 were calculated for the crude rates and the
relative rate ratios. Time to and risk of death were evaluated using the
Kaplan–Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.25 A
significance level of .05 was chosen for this study. Unadjusted survival
822

 curves were compared using the log-rank test. Day 0 was defined as
index date plus 91 days. Based on their clinical rationale and past
research,7 the following co-variables were selected a priori and included
in the multivariable models: age, gender, history of large vessel disease,
Charlson morbidity index26, general practitioner contacts in the year
prior to index date, smoking status, diabetes duration, systolic blood
pressure, total cholesterol, and calendar year. The proportion of missing
data was low (5% for total cholesterol [8464 patients], 2% for systolic
blood pressure [3884 patients] and 0.2% for smoking status [350
patients]). Systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol were catego-
rized into quartiles, plus a separate category for those with missing data,
and patients with no smoking status were assumed to be non-smokers.
Comparisons were made within each treatment cohort and not
between cohorts. This is important because it eliminates glucose
treatment indication bias in those on monotherapy. In the main analy-
sis, achieved HbA1c was analysed as a mean, quarterly updated,
time-dependent co-variable. Last observations carried forward and
backwards were used to impute missing, post-baseline values. HbA1c
was also introduced into the models in the following ways in sensitiv-
ity analyses: non-time-dependently using mean HbA1c over follow-
up (theoretically violating the assumptions of survival models) and
time-dependently using a quarterly updated cumulative, mean value.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested by examining the
Pearson correlation between Schoenfeld residuals and the rank of
survival time for cases that had progressed to death. Two-sided
P values are presented, and 95% CIs calculated for hazard ratios
(HRs). We also report findings from an exploratory post hoc analysis,
carried out to examine in more detail the structure of the association
using deciles of HbA1c instead of the prespecified categories. Ana-
lyses were carried out using R-v3.2.3 and SPSS-v20.
To determine if the pattern of association between achieved
HbA1c and mortality risk is the same in people with or without
comorbidity, a subgroup analysis was conducted in those with a
Charlson index of 1 (diabetes with no complications) and a Charlson
index of ≥2 (diabetes with diabetic complications, diabetes plus non-
diabetic comorbidities or diabetes with diabetic complications plus
non-diabetic comorbidities).

RESULTS
3.1
| Study population
An attrition table detailing patient selection is provided in Table S1.
There were 290 739 subjects with at least 1 diabetes glucose-
lowering therapy. Following exclusions, 131 315 patients were
selected, with some participating in more than 1 treatment cohort
and contributing more than 1 regimen to the composite treatment
cohorts (number of periods of continuous therapy = 167 786). The
treatment cohort with the fewest subjects was insulin monotherapy
(n = 6827), and the largest was the composite cohort of regimens
with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (n = 101 740; Table 1). Overall,
there were 6646 deaths, with a corresponding total follow-up of
374 591 years. The percentage of patients with a mean follow-up
HbA1c in the moderate category ranged from 42% for those pre-
scribed metformin monotherapy (32 188 patients) to 46% for those
prescribed regimens with a higher hypoglycaemia risk including insu-
lin (30 363 patients). The percentage of patients with a mean follow-
up HbA1c in the lowest category ranged from 20% for those pre-
scribed insulin monotherapy (1388 patients) to 47% for those pre-
scribed metformin monotherapy (36 257 patients; Tables S2-S7).
3.2
| Baseline characteristics
The baseline characteristics varied by cohort (Table 1). For example, the
youngest mean age at treatment initiation was in the composite cohort
of regimens with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, with a mean age of
62.1 years. The oldest mean age was in those in the sulphonylurea
monotherapy cohort, at 69.7 years. A summary of the baseline charac-
teristics by treatment cohort is provided in Table 1; more detailed
descriptions by HbA1c category are provided in Tables S2 to S7. There
were differences between those with lower and moderate mean HbA1c
values within the 6 cohorts. Age at treatment initiation was generally
younger in those with moderate mean HbA1c, except for insulin mono-
therapy where those with moderate control vs lower control were older
(67.3 vs 65.8 years; P = .001). Modifiable risk factors such as smoking
status, blood pressure and total cholesterol concentration did not vary
markedly between moderate and lower HbA1c categories. Patients in
the lower HbA1c category had a shorter duration of diabetes.
3.3
| Crude admission rates for hypoglycaemia
The hospital admission rate for hypoglycaemia varied by treatment
cohort. For example, the value for the insulin monotherapy cohort
was 42.2 (95% CI 37.9-46.5) admissions per 1000 person-years of
exposure. For the composite cohort of regimens with lower hypogly-
caemia risk, this was 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-0.9) admissions per 1000
person-years of exposure (Figure S1). When compared with moderate
control, the rate of admissions for hypoglycaemia was higher for
those in the lower mean follow-up HbA1c category treated with regi-
mens defined a priori to have a high risk of hypoglycaemia. The rate
of hypoglycaemia was also higher in those with very high mean
follow-up HbA1c treated with insulin monotherapy and regimens
with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia including insulin.
3.4
| Crude mortality rates
The overall crude mortality rate was 17.7 deaths per 1000 person-
years of exposure. This differed between glucose-lowering cohorts;
the highest rate was in those treated with insulin monotherapy, with
a crude rate of 53.5 deaths per 1000 person-years, and the lowest
rate was in the composite group of regimens with low risk of hypo-
glycaemia, with a crude rate of 13.5 deaths per 1000 person-years
CURRIE ET AL.
823
 (Table 2). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves by mean HbA1c catego-
ries, and by treatment cohort are shown in Figure 1. These showed
that the rate of progression to death was more rapid for those with
lower mean HbA1c vs moderate.
The crude death rate was consistently higher in patients in the
lower mean HbA1c category than in those in the moderate mean
HbA1c category across all 6 cohorts (Table 2). Patients in the com-
posite cohort of regimens with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia exclud-
ing insulin had the highest relative increase in crude death rate
between the lower and moderate mean HbA1c categories: relative
rate ratio 1.71 (95% CI 1.57-1.86). The lowest relative death rate
between the lower and moderate mean HbA1c categories was in the
metformin monotherapy cohort: 1.27 (95% CI 1.17-1.38). The crude
mortality rates are shown in Figures S2 and S3.
3.5
| Adjusted risk of death by HbA1c category
In the main analysis, the overall adjusted HRs (aHRs), compared with
moderate HbA1c, for the lower, high and very high HbA1c categories
were 1.16 (95% CI 1.06-1.18), 1.18 (95% CI 1.07-1.32) and 1.16
(95% CI 1.03-1.32), respectively.
For metformin monotherapy and the composite cohort of regimens
with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, there was no statistically significant
difference in the risk of mortality between the lower and moderate
HbA1c categories when HbA1c was modelled as a mean, quarterly
updated, time-dependent co-variable (aHR 1.03 [95% CI 0.95-1.12] and
1.02 [95% CI 0.94-1.10], respectively); however, an increase in the risk
of all-cause mortality in the lower vs moderate HbA1c categories was
observed in patients in the insulin monotherapy cohort (aHR 1.47 [95%
CI 1.25-1.72]) and in both composite cohorts of regimens with a higher
hypoglycaemia risk, excluding and including insulin (aHR 1.24 [95% CI
1.13-1.35] and 1.28 [95% CI 1.18-1.37], respectively; Figure 2). The high
and very high HbA1c categories were associated with a significantly
increased risk of all-cause mortality when compared with the moderate
categories for patients in the metformin monotherapy cohort and in the
composite group of regimens with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (results
for the high and very high categories were aHR 1.37 [95% CI 1.09-1.72]
and 1.70 [95% CI 1.28-2.26] for metformin, and aHR 1.27 [95% CI
1.04-1.56] and 1.45 [95% CI 1.12-1.89] for regimens with a lower-risk
of hypoglycaemia). The risk of all-cause mortality was not significantly
elevated in the high and very high categories for sulphonylurea mono-
therapy, insulin monotherapy and regimens with a higher risk of hypo-
glycaemia with the exception of the high HbA1c category for regimens
with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia including insulin where the risk of
all-cause mortality was significantly elevated (aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-
1.28, p=0.047). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the pri-
mary analysis (Figure S2).
3.6
| Adjusted risk of death stratified by HbA1c
decile
When analysed according to HbA1c deciles there was further struc-
ture in these data (Figures 3 and S3). There was a consistent pattern
of a more specific, optimal HbA1c (7.03%-7.27%). In all 6 cohorts
there was an increased association with all-cause mortality in the
lowest decile compared with the nadir. At the highest decile of

CURRIE ET AL.
 HbA1c, all treatment cohorts had elevated risk, and this achieved sig-
nificance in those prescribed metformin monotherapy (aHR 2.01
[95% CI 1.53-2.65]), regimens with a lower hypoglycaemia risk (aHR
1.77 [95% CI 1.38-2.27]) and regimens with a higher hypoglycaemia
risk, excluding (aHR 1.27 [95% CI 1.02-1.57]) and including (aHR 1.22
[95% CI 1.03-1.44]) insulin. This was not the case, however, for all
high deciles of HbA1c. Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent
with the primary analysis (Figure S3). A similar pattern of association
between HbA1c and all-cause mortality was observed in those
patients with a baseline Charlson score of 1 and ≥2 prescribed regi-
mens with a low hypoglycaemia risk or regimens with a higher hypo-
glycaemia risk including insulin (Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
Previous studies in patients with type 2 diabetes have reported that
the relationship between HbA1c, all-cause mortality and other out-
comes was not a direct association but better characterized by a J-
shaped, V-shaped or U-shaped association.7,10–19,21,22 In this study,
we not only found that the pattern of association between differing
levels of HbA1c and all-cause mortality differed within specific
glucose-lowering regimens, but also that this pattern of association
differed
between
differing
glucose-lowering
regimens.
When
categorized by prespecified HbA1c ranges, lower HbA1c was associ-
ated with significantly increased mortality when compared with mod-
erate levels of control, but only in those regimens that were
associated with hypoglycaemia. In regimens associated with hypogly-
caemia, there was either no elevation of mortality risk at higher levels
of HbA1c at the conventional level of statistical significance, or a small
increase in mortality risk was observed. In contrast, in those regimens
not associated with hypoglycaemia there was no increase in mortality
at the lower HbA1c range, but, as might be expected, there was an
increase in mortality at higher levels. In itself this does not prove that

 hypoglycaemia is solely or even partially responsible for these obser-
vations; however, these findings do show persuasively that there were
marked differences that need somehow to be explained.
Within the prespecified categories of HbA1c, patient numbers
varied, with more people in the moderate control category. Thus, we
performed a post hoc analysis by HbA1c deciles that revealed further
structure in these data. The findings by HbA1c category masked
more detailed differences in risk patterns between regimens. All regi-
mens were associated with elevated mortality risk at the lowest dec-
ile of HbA1c. Sulphonylurea monotherapy and insulin monotherapy
resulted in considerably elevated mortality risk at low HbA1c levels,
but an increase was also seen with therapies that are not typically
associated with hypoglycaemia. Insofar as low glucose levels may
possibly be a consequence of disease-related morbidity, these obser-
vations may suggest that the overall increase in mortality in patients
with type 2 diabetes that has been previously described may be a
function of the interplay between 2 recognized factors: hypoglycae-
mia induced by certain glucose-lowering drugs, against a background
of a generalized association of morbidity with reduced plasma glu-
cose concentrations.
In contrast, at higher levels of HbA1c there was no clear eleva-
tion in mortality in people treated with regimens associated with

 increased hypoglycaemia. While the reasons for this observation
remain
unknown,
one
possibility
is
that
the
influence
of
hypoglycaemia-related
mortality
extends
throughout
the
entire
HbA1c range, and confounds the ability to tease out the contribution
of hyperglycaemia to mortality. This hypothesis is supported by the
observations in patients treated with regimens with a low hypogly-
caemia risk, where the expected increase in mortality was observed
in higher HbA1c categories.
In terms of the association with all-cause mortality, the optimal
level of HbA1c in these analyses was consistently slightly above 7%
in all regimens, although high levels of HbA1c were not always asso-
ciated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Variability in these
patterns between alternative regimens—whilst consistent with previ-
ous observational studies—helps explain why no single, consistent
pattern has yet emerged. It is likely that the pattern of HbA1c associ-
ation with adverse outcome varies by regimen, and if confirmed, this
would be an important consideration.
These data may also help explain the lack of demonstrable mortal-
ity benefits in previous studies of intensive control such as the
ACCORD5 and the VADT studies.5,6 To the extent that an increase in
mortality is associated with therapies that increase insulin availability
in a non-glucose-dependent manner (eg, sulphonylureas and insulin),
studies of intensive glucose-lowering may be confounded by the com-
peting influences of reversal of hyperglycaemia and risk of hypogly-
caemia. The ORIGIN trial27 examined the outcome of low-dose, basal
insulin compared with standard care, and the insulin arm did not
reduce either all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality; however,
patients in the insulin group received concomitant metformin—shown
to markedly attenuate mortality risk in people treated with insulin, in
particular at low doses28—and insulin was quite frequently used in the
standard care arm. In a recent observational study characterizing the
outcome of care of those exposed to metformin, where the outcome
was major adverse cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality, there
was no evidence of increased adverse outcomes at low HbA1c
levels.29 A further observational study in 2010 reported that there
was no difference in all-cause mortality across the HbA1c range, but
this study was subject to immortal time bias and other limitations30.
The risk-to-benefit calculation in choosing between alternative
glucose-lowering
drugs
involves
a
complex
balancing
exercise
between competing risks due to pleiotropic effects such as hypogly-
caemia, hyperglycaemia, weight gain, renal disease, cancer-related
properties, haemodynamic changes, hyperlipidaemia and direct car-
diovascular injury. Although there are no competing risks when ana-
lysing all-cause mortality, the potential harms or benefits from these
drugs may differentially influence microvascular and macrovascular
outcomes and may impact differing patient phenotypes in differing
ways. Intensive glucose control undoubtedly results in improved
microvascular disease outcome, but, in the present study, we confirm
that there is a serious downside risk that must be taken into account
when HbA1c is lowered, particularly with therapies that are associ-
ated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.
These data and the study design had a number of strengths and
limitations. The study included routine observations from a very large
number of people, from a national, real-world setting. There was no
standardization of the timing of observations such as HbA1c. We
believe that this will have introduced noise but not bias because
there is inherent variability in the measurement and timing of glucose
control in routine care. One general criticism of retrospective, obser-
vational studies is indication bias, that is, that patients are often trea-
ted differentially with differing drugs at differing doses in a non-
random way. Unusually, this was less of a concern here because the
comparisons of the pattern of association between differing levels of
HbA1c were only made in a statistical way within the same regimens
and compared only differing levels of glucose control. However, it is
also possible to examine the general patterns of association and
determine that they differed markedly between the 6 regimens that
were characterized. Nevertheless, multivariable models were used to
account for recorded differences between HbA1c categories. HbA1c
varies over time for many reasons. The time-dependent statistical
models helped account for this, but they remain statistical models. To
increase confidence in our findings, we set out, a priori, to use vari-
ous analytical approaches and to determine if our findings remained
consistent. In the main, there was consistency between alternative
approaches. There were differences in phenotype between groups,
so the possibility of residual confounding is a consideration that
needs to be borne in mind. There could be several reasons why treat-
ment intensification was delayed in those with poor glucose control
including clinical inertia, non-compliance, age, comorbidities, or
restricted access to care and there may therefore be underlying dif-
ferences between patients across the HbA1c range that could not be
fully adjusted for in our statistical model.
In summary, lower HbA1c was associated with increased mortal-
ity risk compared with moderate levels, especially with regimens that
are associated with hypoglycaemia. High levels of HbA1c were con-
sistently associated with the expected elevated mortality risk in those
regimens that have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. These data suggest
that, in the individualization of glycaemic targets for patients, consid-
eration needs to be given to the classes of glucose-lowering therapy
that are being used, with less aggressive targets in those patients
who are being treated with therapies associated with hypoglycaemia.
Lower HbA1c was associated with increased mortality risk compared
with moderate control, especially in those regimens associated with
hypoglycaemia.
