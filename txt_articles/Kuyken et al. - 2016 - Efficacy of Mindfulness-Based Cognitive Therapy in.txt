IMPORTANCE Relapse prevention in recurrent depression is a significant public health
problem, and antidepressants are the current first-line treatment approach. Identifying an
equally efficacious nonpharmacological intervention would be an important development.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a meta-analysis on individual patient data to examine the efficacy of
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with usual care and other active
treatments, including antidepressants, in treating those with recurrent depression.
DATA SOURCES English-language studies published or accepted for publication in
peer-reviewed journals identified from EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, Web of
Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from the first available year to
November 22, 2014. Searches were conducted from November 2010 to November 2014.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of manualized MBCT for relapse prevention in recurrent
depression in full or partial remission that compared MBCT with at least 1 non-MBCT
treatment, including usual care.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This was an update to a previous meta-analysis. We
screened 2555 new records after removing duplicates. Abstracts were screened for full-text
extraction (S.S.) and checked by another researcher (T.D.). There were no disagreements. Of
the original 2555 studies, 766 were evaluated against full study inclusion criteria, and we
acquired full text for 8. Of these, 4 studies were excluded, and the remaining 4 were
combined with the 6 studies identified from the previous meta-analysis, yielding 10 studies
for qualitative synthesis. Full patient data were not available for 1 of these studies, resulting in
9 studies with individual patient data, which were included in the quantitative synthesis.
RESULTS Of the 1258 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 47.1 (11.9) years, and 944
(75.0%) were female. A 2-stage random effects approach showed that patients receiving
MBCT had a reduced risk of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up period compared
with those who did not receive MBCT (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82). Furthermore,
comparisons with active treatments suggest a reduced risk of depressive relapse within a
60-week follow-up period (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97). Using a 1-stage approach,
sociodemographic (ie, age, sex, education, and relationship status) and psychiatric (ie, age at
onset and number of previous episodes of depression) variables showed no statistically
significant interaction with MBCT treatment. However, there was some evidence to suggest
that a greater severity of depressive symptoms prior to treatment was associated with a
larger effect of MBCT compared with other treatments.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears efficacious as a
treatment for relapse prevention for those with recurrent depression, particularly those with
more pronounced residual symptoms. Recommendations are made concerning how future
trials can address remaining uncertainties and improve the rigor of the field.

lthough progress has been made in the treatment of
manypsychiatricconditions,recurrentdepressioncon-
tinues to cause significant disability and remains a high
cost to society.1,2 Interventions that prevent depressive re-
lapse among people at high risk of recurrent episodes have
significant potential to reduce the disease’
s burden.3 Mind-
fulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), one such interven-
tion, teaches psychological skills that target cognitive mecha-
nisms implicated in depressive relapse to people with a history
of depression4 by combining systematic mindfulness train-
ing with elements from cognitive therapy. A systematic re-
viewandmeta-analysis5of6randomizedclinicaltrials(N = 593
patients) suggested that MBCT was associated with a signifi-
cantreductionintheratesofdepressiverelapsecomparedwith
usual care or placebo, corresponding to a 34% relative risk re-
duction (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.82).
While we have a growing body of evidence pointing to the
efficacy of MBCT in preventing depressive relapses, we do not
know whether MBCT is differentially efficacious for sub-
groups of people known to be at greater or lesser risk for de-
pressive relapse/recurrence.6,7

tified through a systematic literature search. Unlike meta-
analyses of aggregate data at the trial level, IPD analyses per-
mit the investigation of patient-level characteristics that may
be potential moderators of treatment effects.8 We examined
the efficacy of MBCT compared with usual care or active treat-
mentgroupsforpatientsfromarangeofsociodemographicand
psychiatric backgrounds participating in studies conducted in
a number of countries in Europe and North America, taking
into account different periods of follow-up across studies.
Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses
statement9andthegoodpracticeguidelinesoftheCochraneCol-
laboration IPD Methods Group10 (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Study Identification and Data Extraction
We searched for relevant publications from November 2010
(the searching end date of the previous meta-analysis,5 which
performed searches from the first available date for each da-
tabase) to November 2014 (Figure 1) using the same a priori cri-
teria for study inclusion as the previous review, as follows: (1)
Study design: randomized trials of MBCT for the prevention
of relapse in patients with recurrent major depressive disor-
der currently in remission, reported in the English language,
and published or accepted for publication in peer-reviewed
journals; (2) Participants: participants aged 18 years or older,
diagnosedashavingrecurrentmajordepressivedisorderinfull
or partial remission according to a formal diagnostic classifi-
cation system (major depressive disorder was defined as a di-
agnosis based on the DSM-III, -III-R, -IV, or -IV-TR or the In-
ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]); (3) Intervention
group: MBCT delivered according to the treatment manual11;
(4) Control group: at least 1 non-MBCT treatment, including
usual care; and (5) Outcome measures: number of partici-
pants meeting the diagnostic criteria for a new major depres-
sive episode over the follow-up study period, according to
accepted clinical diagnostic criteria such as the ICD-10 or the
DSM-IV-TR.

Key Points
Question What is the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy compared with usual care and other treatments?
Findings This individual patient data meta-analysis included 9
trials, comprising 1329 participants. Patients receiving
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy had a significantly reduced
risk of depressive relapse within a 60-week follow-up period
compared with those who received usual care and had comparable
outcomes to those who received other active treatments.
Meaning Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears
efficacious as a treatment for relapse prevention for those who
have recurrent depression and provides an alternative choice to
other active treatments.

based cognitive therapy) OR (MBCT) AND (depress*). No lan-
guage or other limitations were imposed at this stage. We also
checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for ad-
ditional references to potentially relevant studies. This pro-
cedure is summarized in Figure 1, and narrative text and an
example of a full search string are provided in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
Individual patient data were obtained from the authors of
9 of the 10 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and collated into
1dataset(N = 1329).Overall,IPDintegritywasfoundtobehigh.
The trials are summarized in Table 1, and data extraction and
cleaning are elaborated on in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Of
the 9 relevant trials, 2 had 3 arms and 7 had 2 arms. One trial
included a placebo pill arm18; this small arm (n = 30) was ex-
cluded from all analyses. The other 3-arm trial23 had 2 non-
MBCT arms: one treatment as usual and the other treatment
as usual with cognitive psychological education. For the analy-
ses of MBCT vs non-MBCT, the 2 non-MBCT arms were com-
bined; for the analyses of MBCT vs an active comparator, the
treatment as usual arm was excluded. We used the Cochrane
risk of bias assessment tool.24 While the risk of bias was gen-
erally low across all trials for most criteria (eTable 4 in the
Supplement), 2 of 9 trials did not blind assessors17,19 and 1 of
these also had incomplete outcome data.17
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was relapse to depression within 60
weeks of follow-up, collected through a Structured Clinical
Diagnostic Interview.25 For studies with a follow-up beyond
60 weeks, follow-up was censored at 60 weeks. From the 9
trials available, participants with data for relapse status and
time to relapse measured in weeks were included in all analy-
ses; if relapse did not occur, time to end of follow-up was used.
We also reported adverse events.
Sociodemographic and Psychiatric Status Variables
We predefined several sociodemographic characteristics as
potential moderators of the effect of MBCT, ie, sex, age, edu-
cation, relationship status, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic sta-
tus, and employment status. These variables were standard-
ized across the 9 trials using available data to map each
participant to the standardized category (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Psychiatric status variables included in the moderator
analyses were severity of depression symptoms at baseline
(measured with the Beck Depression Inventory–II or Inven-
tory of Depressive Symptomatology), baseline mindfulness
measured on 1 of several scales, age at onset of depression, and
number of previous major depressive episodes.
Statistical Methods
All statistical analyses were conducted according to partici-
pants’randomizedallocationintheprimarystudies.Onlycom-
plete case data were included for all trials in the main analy-
ses. In the event of substantive missing data (>10%) for an
individual trial, a sensitivity analysis was performed using im-
puted data based on 2 scenarios—one maximally favoring the
intervention group and the other maximally favoring the con-
trolgroup—forthe2-stagemeta-analysiscomparingMBCTwith
non-MBCT only. All analyses were performed using Stata ver-
sion 14 (StataCorp LP).
Does MBCT Reduce Depressive Relapse/Recurrence
Compared With Control Conditions?
Meta-analyses of time-to-event data were used to evaluate the
effect of MBCT compared with non-MBCT on the primary out-
come. Both 2-stage and 1-stage meta-analysis methods were
used.26 Two-stage methods involved calculating hazard ra-
tios (HRs) for depressive relapse (MBCT vs non-MBCT) for each
studyindividually27,28andusingCoxproportionalhazardmod-
els, and then combining these HRs in a meta-analysis. Hetero-
geneity was assessed within 2-stage models using the I2
statistic.29 A 95% CI for the I2 statistic was calculated using the
test-based method.30 Both fixed and random effect(s) mod-
els were applied.31 Meta-analyses were performed on 3 pair-
wise comparisons: MBCT vs all non-MBCT treatments, MBCT
vs active treatments (antidepressant medication [ADM] or cog-
nitive psychological education), and MBCT vs ADM only.
For 1-stage meta-analyses, both fixed and random ef-
fect(s) models were applied to the same 3 pairwise compari-
sons. Fixed effect models used the Cox proportional hazards
model to produce an HR; these models included each indi-
vidualstudyasastratumwithitsownbaselinehazard.32Where
the proportional hazards assumption was unsupported, MBCT
status interacting with log(time) was added to the model (and
to all subsequent models) to allow the effect of MBCT status
on risk of relapse to vary during the follow-up period. Ran-
dom effects 1-stage models used the Stata command stmixed,33
included a study-level random effect on MBCT status, and ap-
plied a flexible parametric survival model.34
Are the Effects of MBCT on Outcomes Moderated
by Demographic or Depression-Related Variables?
For our primary outcome of depressive relapse, the use of
1-stage meta-analysis models facilitated inclusion of our so-
ciodemographic and depression-related covariates to in-
vestigate moderation.35 The choice of whether to use a fixed
effect or random effects approach would be informed by the
degree of heterogeneity between studies evident from the
2-stage and 1-stage models comparing MBCT with non-
MBCT; in the event of very low heterogeneity, a fixed effect
model would be used. A series of multivariable models were
created, initially including only the MBCT status of the par-
ticipant and 1 additional covariate (the interaction between
MBCT and log[time] was included if appropriate). As a fur-
ther check, all covariates were included in 1 overall model to
establish which were significantly associated with depres-
sive relapse in the presence of all other covariates. Individual
covariates that were found to be statistically significant at the
P < .10 threshold in a model including MBCT status only or in
a model with all covariates combined were then included in a
further model. Covariates that did not achieve significance at
the P < .05 level were removed individually from this new
model until the most parsimonious model had been ascer-
tained. Each covariate within this model was individually in-
vestigated for interaction with MBCT status (ie, each model

Results
Description of Primary Studies
The 9 included studies are described fully in the original trial
reports and are summarized here in Table 1. We defined loss
to follow-up as a lack of data on relapse status after 60 weeks
(or closest available time) of follow-up. Of the 1329 random-
ized participants from the 9 trials with available IPD, data on
relapse status and time to relapse (or end of follow-up with no
relapse) were available for 1258 participants (94.7%). Across
the sample of 1258 participants, the mean (SD) age was 47.1
(11.9) years (median, 47 years; interquartile range, 39-56), and
944 (75.0%) were female. Of 1230 participants with data avail-
able, 509 (41.4%) had at least degree-level qualifications, 636
(51.7%) had qualifications below degree level, and 85 (6.9%)
had no qualifications. Of 1239 participants, 726 (58.6%) were
married or had a partner, 234 (18.9%) were single, and 279
(22.5%) were divorced, separated, or widowed. Among 1234
participants,themean(SD)ageatonsetofdepressionswas26.0
(12.2) years (median, 23 years; interquartile range, 17-34), and
of 1200 participants, 694 (57.8%) had 5 or more past depres-
sive episodes. Within individual studies, the proportion of par-
ticipants lost to follow-up ranged from 0% to 18% (Table 1). Of
596 participants who received MBCT, 229 (38%) had a depres-
sive relapse within 60 weeks’follow-up, whereas 327 of 662
participants (49%) who did not receive MBCT had a depres-
sive relapse within 60 weeks.
Does MBCT Reduce Depressive Relapse Compared
With Control Conditions?
Owing to clinical heterogeneity across the 9 studies, the re-
sultsoftherandomeffectsmodelsarereported;becauseofvery
low heterogeneity of treatment effects between studies, the
results of equivalent fixed effect analyses were very similar.
A forest plot of the 2-stage meta-analysis of time to relapse of
depression compared MBCT with all non-MBCT treatments
(HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82; I2, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0-20)
(Figure 2A). The funnel plot associated with this analysis in-
dicated some asymmetry, with an absence of smaller studies
that showed an increased risk of relapse with MBCT treat-
ment (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The associated Egger test
produced a P value of .18, although we recognize the limited
power of this test with only 9 studies. A sensitivity analysis
whereby missing outcome data from Godfrin and van
Heeringen17 were imputed favoring the MBCT group pro-
duced an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.49-0.82); using imputed data
thatfavoredthenon-MBCTgroupproducedanHRof0.74(95%
CI, 0.63-0.88). An equivalent analysis comparing MBCT with
all active treatments was conducted using data from 5
studies13,18,19,21,23 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97; I2, 0%)
(Figure 2B). An analysis comparing MBCT with ADM treat-
ment was conducted using data from 4 studies13,18,19,21 (HR,
0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98; I2, 0%) (Figure 2C). For the latter 2
meta-analyses, the I2 value was 0% in both cases, the lower
boundary of the 95% CI was 0%, and the upper boundaries
were 43% and 65%, respectively.
An unadjusted 1-stage fixed effect meta-analysis com-
pared MBCT with non-MBCT treatment (1248 patients, 554 de-
pressive relapses within 60 weeks; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-
0.82) (Table 2, model A). However, evidence indicated that the
proportional hazards assumption was not valid (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement shows the log-log plots comparing the MBCT
and non-MBCT groups for each of the 9 included studies).
Owing to the lack of proportional hazards, the interaction be-
tween MBCT status and log(time) was added, allowing the
effects of MBCT to vary with log(time). This model (Table 2,
model B) yielded an HR for MBCT of 0.34 (95% CI, 0.19-0.60),
and for the interaction of MBCT with log(time) of 1.28 (95%
CI, 1.06-1.55), this model indicated a reduction in the preven-
tive effect of MBCT on depressive relapse as time progressed

The equivalent analysis comparing MBCT with ADM treatment
used 4 studies13,18,19,21 (637 participants and 266 relapses; HR,

non-MBCT treatments using a flexible parametric model with

depressive relapse/recurrence over 60 weeks compared with
usual care. Extending previous work, we found that MBCT re-
duces the risk of depressive relapse/recurrence compared with
the current mainstay approach, maintenance antidepres-
sants. We further showed that there is no support for MBCT
having differential effects for patients based on their sex, age,
education, or relationship status, suggesting the interven-
tion’
s generalizability across these characteristics. Different re-
search groups conducted the 9 randomized clinical trials and
used different clinicians across a range of European and North
American countries. The lack of heterogeneity between stud-
ies in effects on time to depressive relapse suggests that the
effects of MBCT are similar in these different contexts.
Mindfulness-basedcognitivetherapywasdevelopedforpa-
tients in remission but at high risk for depressive relapse/
recurrence. Our analyses suggest that the treatment effect of
MBCT on the risk of depressive relapse/recurrence is larger in
participantswithhigherlevelsofdepressionsymptomsatbase-
line compared with non-MBCT treatments, suggesting that
MBCT may be particularly helpful to those who still have sig-
nificant depressive symptoms. This is consistent with several
recenttrialsthatsuggestMBCTmaybemoreeffectiveforpeople
whosedepressivesymptomsfluctuate18and/orwhoreportahis-
tory of early adversity.21,23 Adverse events were formally re-
corded in 6 of 9 studies, but none were attributed to MBCT.
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
To address the question of whether treatment effects are
influenced by individual patient characteristics, a study needs
to be adequately powered and use appropriate statistical ap-
proaches.Withintheconstraintsoftheconstituentstudies,our
IPD approach provided an opportunity to answer these ques-
tions.Riskofbiaswaslow,suggestingconfidenceinthesefind-
ings. Combining a series of modest-sized trials with effects in
the predicted direction but missing significance individually
yields a significant combined estimate of effect.
We did observe asymmetry in the funnel plot with an ab-
sence of smaller studies that showed an increased risk of

relapse with MBCT treatment. It is possible that there are un-
published studies that we are not aware of, and we welcome
investigators of any such studies to bring them to our atten-
tion so that their data can be included in future updates. The
unavailability of the Meadows et al36 study data represents
an impediment to IPD, transparency, and external scrutiny.
Funding bodies, ethics committees, and sponsors should
work to a consensus position. Finally, allegiance effects can
influence effect sizes in psychological therapy trials,37 and
the constituent trials were largely conducted by proponents
of MBCT. Therefore, we analyzed risk of bias (eTable 4 in the
Supplement).
There were a number of limitations resulting from avail-
ability of data within the constituent studies. For example, we
were not able to obtain information about important poten-
tial moderators such as race/ethnicity and employment. Trials
also vary in the way data are collected. For example, age at first
onset of depression was collected in some trials by simple self-
report and in others through standardized Structured Clini-
cal Interview. Number of prior episodes was also gathered in-
consistently. Adverse events were not systematically recorded
or reported. As with all meta-analyses, there may be trials pub-
lishedinotherlanguagesorunpublishedtrialswewerenotable
to access. Moderator analyses were not formally powered, ex-
ploratory, or relatively large in number, increasing the risk of
type I errors. Future studies should plan and power for mod-
erator analyses.
Conclusions
While previous research has shown the superiority of MBCT
compared with usual care,5 this study provides important new
evidence that MBCT is also effective compared with other ac-
tive treatments and that its effects are not restricted to par-
ticular groups defined by age, educational level, marital sta-
tus, or sex. A recent meta-analysis38 of the effectiveness of all
psychological interventions to prevent recurrence compared
with usual care and antidepressants suggests that the protec-
tive effects of MBCT are comparable with those for cognitive
therapy (vs usual care: RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.87; vs ADM:
RR,0.08;95%CI,0.61-1.02)andinterpersonaltherapy(vsusual
care: RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.63; vs ADM: RR, 0.08; 95% CI,
0.50-1.38).However,MBCTaddressesaparticularclinicalprob-
lem,namelyteachingskillstostaywelltopeoplecurrentlywell
but at high risk of depressive relapse. There is a reduction in
protective effects over time. The finding that MBCT may be
mosthelpfulforpatientswithhigherlevelsofdepressivesymp-
toms adds to an emerging consensus that the greater the risk
for depressive relapse/recurrence, the more benefit MBCT of-
fers. Patients with lower baseline scores appeared to receive
less benefit but were not disadvantaged by MBCT.
We recommend that future trials consider an active
control group, use comparable primary and secondary out-
comes (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM for depressive
relapse), use longer follow-ups, report treatment fidelity,
collect key background variables (eg, race/ethnicity and
employment), take care to ensure generalizability, conduct
cost-effectiveness analyses, put in place ethical and data
man-agement procedures that enable data sharing, consider
mechanisms of action, and systematically record and report
adverse events.
