Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Exposure to violence continues to be a growing epidemic, particularly among 
children. An enhanced understanding of the biological effect of exposure to violence is critical.
OBJECTIVE—To examine the association between neighborhood violence and cellular and 
biological stress in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A matched, cross-sectional study of 85 black 
children aged 5 to 16 years from 52 neighborhoods took place in the greater New Orleans, 
Louisiana, area between January 1, 2012, and July 31, 2013.
EXPOSURES—Density of businesses where individuals can purchase alcohol as measured by 
rates per capita of liquor or convenience stores, and violence as measured by reports of violent 
crime and reports of domestic violence, operationalized as reports per capita of crime and 
domestic violence. Rates of exposure within a 500-, 1000-, and 2000-m radius from the child’s 
home were calculated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary biological outcomes were telomere length 
and cortisol functioning.
RESULTS—Among the 85 children in the study, (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.1] years; 50 girls and 35 
boys) significant variation in telomere length and cortisol functioning was observed at the

 neighborhood level, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 6% for telomere length, 3.4% for 
waking cortisol levels, and 5.5% for peak cortisol levels following a stressor. Density of liquor or 
convenience stores within a 500-m radius of a child’s home was associated with a decrease in 
mean telomere length by 0.004 for each additional liquor store or convenience store (β [SE], 
−0.004 [0.002]; P = .02). The rate of domestic violence was significantly and inversely associated 
with a decrease in mean telomere length by 0.007 for each additional report of domestic violence 
in a 500-m radius of a child’s home (β [SE], −0.007 [0.001]; P < .001). The rate of violent crime 
was significantly associated with a decrease in mean telomere length by 0.006 for each additional 
report of violent crime in a 500-m radius of a child’s home (β [SE], −0.006 [0.002]; P < .001). 
Children exposed to more liquor and convenience stores within 500 m of their home were 
significantly less likely to reduce cortisol levels after a reactivity test (β, 0.029; P = .047), as were 
children exposed to high rates of domestic violence (β, 0.088; P = .12) and violent crime (β. 
0.029; P = .006). Children exposed to more liquor and convenience stores within 500 m of their 
home had a steeper diurnal decline in cortisol levels during the day (β [SE], −0.002 [0.001]; P = .
04), as did children exposed to more violent crime within 500 m of their home (β [SE] −0.032 
[0.014]; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Neighborhoods are important targets for interventions 
to reduce the effect of exposure to violence in the lives of children. These findings provide the first 
evidence that objective exposures to neighborhood-level violence influence both physiological and 
cellular markers of stress, even in children.
Before the age of 18 years, approximately two-thirds of children are exposed to multiple 
types of violence.1 A greater understanding of the effect on children’s health owing to 
exposure to violence across socioecological contexts is critical, as differential exposure to 
social environmental conditions likely contributes mechanistically to health disparities.2,3 
Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have higher exposure to violence, 
suggesting that the effects of such exposure also may be accentuated.1,4 Exposure to 
violence may create persistent biological effects across multiple stress response systems 
(SRS), resulting in lasting physiological and psychological vulnerability.5,6 There has been 
limited information on racial and socioeconomic differences in biological stress and 
antecedent factors among children,7 and few studies have examined within-race or 
socioeconomic differences in biological stress.
Violence may play a key role in mechanisms that lead to shorter-term biological changes and 
long-term health outcomes; this finding helped motivate the inclusion of exposure to 
violence in the self-reported Adverse Childhood Experiences scale.8 Children’s exposure to 
violence has been linked to altered biological responses across many SRS, suggesting 
mechanistic roles in negative health effects.9 In adults and youths, exposure to violence has 
been associated with lower telomere length (TL) and greater attrition of TL.10–12 As one of 
the most frequently investigated biomarkers and a primary allostatic mediator,13,14 the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is shaped by the individual’s social context, with 
both low and high cortisol levels as biological alterations resulting from early adversity.15 
These alterations may be adaptations to the individual’s circumstances, but may not be 
desirable or may come at a high cost to long-term health.16

 To separate perceived exposure to violence from objective exposure, the assessment of 
cross-contextual violence requires the use of objective measures.17 We examined the links 
between cortisol levels and TL in children and the rate of violent crime, an established 
objective marker of neighborhood violence, as well as 2 closely linked unique 
neighborhood-level exposures: density of locations where individuals can purchase alcohol 
and the rate of reports of domestic violence (DV) at the neighborhood level. Density of 
businesses where individuals can purchase alcohol, particularly those where alcohol is 
purchased and consumed off-site (ie, liquor or convenience stores), is associated with 
neighborhood crime and assaults,18,19 and has been associated with many health and social 
outcomes as well as neighborhood DV.20,21 Therefore, we tested the direct association 
between cortisol response and TL in children and neighborhood density of businesses where 
individuals can purchase alcohol, neighborhood rates of DV reports, and neighborhood rates 
of violent crime, as well as indirect pathways of witnessing violence in the neighborhood 
and DV and fighting in the home.
Methods
Participants
Children aged 5 to 16 years and their families from New Orleans, Louisiana, were recruited 
using street outreach techniques between January 1, 2012, and July 31, 2013. Participants 
were geographically linked to their census tract and located in 51 of 177 census tracts.
Mothers provided data about multiple levels of their children’s social ecology using an 
interviewer-assisted computer survey (Nova Research) administered face-to-face at the 
research site. Written informed consent was obtained from caregivers and assent obtained 
from children older than 8 years. This study was approved by the Tulane University Health 
Sciences Center Institutional Review Board.
Given the outcomes examined, potential structural confounding, and the importance of age, 
children were matched 3:1 (with replacement) on age within 1 year, exposure to Hurricane 
Katrina in 2005, and the propensity (with a caliber of 0.05) of living in a neighborhood with 
a high level of violence. The final matched sample included 85 black children.
Measures
Both primary and secondary data were included and a multilevel data system was created of 
children nested within their household and neighborhoods. Neighborhood was defined as 
geographic buffers around the child’s home as well as a US census tract.
The primary outcomes of interest were TL and salivary acute and diurnal cortisol levels. The 
mean relative TL, as represented by the telomere to single copy gene ratio, was determined 
by monochromic multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction from extracted DNA. 
Measures were performed in triplicate and duplicated on a second plate. The mean of the 6 
replicates was used to calculate TL. Two samples with high coefficients of variation (10% 
intra-assay and 6% interassay) were removed.

 Each participant provided 11 saliva samples. Cortisol reactivity was assessed using the Trier 
Social Stressor Test for Children (TSST-C), a validated test of psychosocial stressors for 
youth.22 The TSST-C was administered in the early afternoon (mean 2:03 PM) to minimize 
diurnal influences.23 Saliva was collected a mean of 39 minutes after arrival,24 and then 
twice after the TSST-C was performed (mean, 23 and 85 minutes after the TSST-C) to 
capture the peak level of cortisol after the TSST-C, as well as cortisol reactivity and 
recovery. Participants also provided diurnal saliva samples on 2 separate days: on 
awakening, 30 minutes later to capture the cortisol awakening response, in the early 
afternoon, and at bedtime. Cortisol was measured in saliva via passive drool and stored in 
freezers. Samples were assayed using a commercially available validated enzyme 
immunoassay (Salimetrics). Samples were assayed in duplicate; those varying more than 7% 
were reassayed. Cortisol levels were log-transformed.
The primary exposures of interest were density of liquor and convenience stores, 
neighborhood rate of reports of DV, and neighborhood rate of violent crime. Density of 
liquor and convenience stores was measured within a 500-, 1000-, and 2000-m radius of 
each child’s residence. The density per census tract and distance to the nearest liquor store 
or convenience store from the child’s home were also calculated and compared for 
consistency. Counts of alcohol licenses were obtained from the Louisiana Department 
Alcohol and Tobacco Control.
The rate of reports of DV per meter radius and per capita within a census tract was 
calculated by analyzing 911 call data from the city of New Orleans, via the method used by 
Capowich and Kondkar,25 whereby calls are analyzed for DV events. Each call was linked to 
an address so that calls could be geographically linked and measured as calls within the 
same 500-, 1000-, and 2000-m radius around the child’s home.
The rate of neighborhood violent crime was calculated with data from the police department 
with address information for each type of substantiated crime, calculated as the number of 
homicide and assault (including rape) crimes within the same meter radius of each child’s 
residence.
Potential mediators included witnessing DV, fighting, and neighborhood violence. 
Witnessing violence in the neighborhood and home was measured by items adapted from the 
minor and major life events from the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment,26 including 
witnessing physical or verbal fighting at home, DV, and violence in the community. Key 
covariates or potential confounders included the following sociodemographics: child sex, 
maternal age, maternal educational level, prenatal maternal smoking, exposure to smoking in 
the home, exposure to alcohol in the home, and immediate neighborhood.
Statistical Analysis
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 
(SAS Institute Inc), including PROC MIXED, to take into account neighborhood clustering, 
multiple children per household, and conditioning on matched stratum. Thirteen enrolled 
families (15%) had more than 1 child participate (range, 1–5). Mixed models were used for 
partitioning variance estimates at all levels, expressed as the intraclass correlation

 coefficient. Modeling was performed in the following steps: (1) examination of empty 
models to determine the extent of clustering of TL and cortisol values by neighborhood, (2) 
testing the unadjusted associations between the neighborhood violence environments and 
stress markers, (3) testing the adjusted association after accounting for potential 
confounders, and (4) testing potential mediation. Mixed models for repeated measures of 
cortisol over time accounted for within-individual correlation within the levels of child, 
matched stratum, and neighborhood. All models compared use of alcohol and rates of 
violence at different radii around the child’s home, as well as with distance and tract-level 
exposures. Potential mediation by reported witnessing of violence at home and in the 
neighborhood was calculated separately, using the SAS MEDIATE macro.27
Results
Characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1. Thirty children (35%) had witnessed 
DV in the home and 31 (37%) had witnessed violence in the neighborhood. Children living 
in neighborhoods were more likely to witness DV and neighborhood violence.
Telomere Length
In empty models, not considering any covariates, we observed substantial clustering of TL, 
with 10% of the variance in TL explained at the household level (intraclass correlation 
coefficient, 10%) and 6% of the variance in TL explained at the census tract or 
neighborhood level. Table 2 shows results of multivariable analysis depicting the direct 
effect of neighborhood liquor and convenience stores, rates of DV, and rates of violent crime 
on TL, separately. Even after adjusting for potential confounders, the number of liquor and 
convenience stores within a 500-m radius of a child’s home remained associated with TL, 
with a decrease in mean TL by 0.004 for each additional liquor store or convenience store (β 
[SE], −0.004 [0.002]; P = .02) (Table 2). Considering only bivariate association, the number 
of liquor and convenience stores explained 3.5% of the variance (R2 = 3.5%) in TL and a 
further 4.7% was explained by additional covariates (R2 = 8.2%). Results were nearly 
identical for alcohol exposure within a 500-m radius.
The rate of reports of DV remained significantly and inversely associated with TL after 
adjusting for several potential confounders, with a decrease in mean TL by 0.007 for each 
additional report in a 500-m radius (β [SE], −0.007 [0.001]; P < .001) (Table 2). 
Considering only the bivariate association, the rate of reports of DV explained 2.8% of the 
variance (R2 = 2.8%) in TL and a further 3.9% was explained by including additional 
covariates (R2 = 6.7%). Results were nearly identical for reports of DV within a 1000- and 
2000-m radius.
The rate of violent crime remained significantly associated with TL after adjusting for 
several potential confounders, with a decrease in mean TL by 0.006 for each additional 
report in a 500-m radius (β [SE], −0.006 [0.002]; P < .001) (Table 2). Considering only the 
bivariate association, violent crime rate explained 2.8% of the variance (R2 = 1.6%) in TL 
and an additional 4.3% was explained by additional covariates (R2 = 5.9%). Findings were 
similar for violent crime exposure within a 1000- and 2000-m radius.

 Subjective report of the child witnessing violence in the neighborhood was controlled for. 
Models run with witnessing DV in the home returned similar results. Mediation between the 
neighborhood exposures and caregiver report of the child’s witnessing DV and community 
violence were examined, but a significant indirect effect emerged only for the association 
between number of liquor and convenience stores and TL with mediation by witnessing DV 
(natural indirect effect, −0.099; 95% CI, −0.037 to −0.217) (Table 2).
Acute Cortisol Reactivity
Approximately 5.5% of the variance in mean acute cortisol level was explained at the 
neighborhood level, illustrating a substantial amount of clustering at this level. Empty 
models captured 3 cortisol measures simultaneously within the same model. Peak individual 
cortisol level was the intercept (β, 2.808; P = .001). Cortisol reactivity was captured as the 
time (in minutes) leading to the peak cortisol level (β, 0.030; P = .05), with higher values 
indicating a steeper rise from before the TSST-C to the peak level. Cortisol recovery was the 
time (in minutes) from after the peak cortisol level until the end of the study visit (β, −0.037; 
P = .35), with more negative values indicating a steeper decline in the cortisol level after the 
stressor. Table 3 depicts the direct effect of neighborhood liquor and convenience stores, 
rates of DV, and rates of violent crime on acute cortisol levels.39
We observed a significant effect of density of liquor and convenience stores on cortisol 
recovery, with children exposed to more liquor and convenience stores within 500 m of their 
home being significantly less likely to reduce cortisol levels after the TSST-C (β, 0.029; P 
= .047) (Figure). Neighborhood rate of reports of DV and rate of violent crime also affected 
children’s response to the TSST-C, with overall blunted cortisol levels and shallow recovery, 
as noted by interaction between time and exposure, among children living in areas with high 
rates of DV (β, 0.088; P = .12) and violent crime (β, 0.029; P = .006) (Figure). Results were 
similar for neighborhood exposures within a 1000-m radius and marginally significant 
within a 2000-m radius. We did not observe an indirect effect for cortisol recovery by the 
child’s witnessing DV and community violence.
Diurnal Rhythm of Cortisol
We also observed moderate clustering of cortisol at the neighborhood level, with 
approximately 3.4% of the variance in mean diurnal cortisol levels explained at the 
neighborhood level. Empty models captured waking basal cortisol levels as the intercept (β, 
3.1174; P = .001), a cortisol awakening response rise in cortisol within 30 minutes of 
awakening (β, 0.6752; P = .001), and a diurnal decline in cortisol across the day until 
bedtime (β, −0.08419; P < .001), which was marginally steeper in the morning than 
afternoon hours (β, 0.003; P = .14). Multivariable results depicting the direct effect of 
neighborhood liquor and convenience stores, rates of DV, and rates of violent crime on 
diurnal cortisol levels, separately, are presented in Table 4.39 We observed a significant 
effect of density of liquor and convenience stores on mean daily cortisol levels, with children 
exposed to more liquor and convenience stores within 500 m of their home having a steeper 
diurnal decline in cortisol levels during the day (β [SE], −0.002 [0.001]; P = .04) (Table 4). 
Children exposed to more violent crime within 500 m of their home also had a steeper 
decline in cortisol levels (β [SE] −0.032 [0.014]; P = .02). Results were similar for

 exposures to neighborhood violence within a 1000-m radius and similar but only marginally 
significant within a 2000-m radius. We did not observe a significant indirect effect for 
average cortisol recovery by the child’s witnessing DV and community violence.
Discussion
Results indicate that the effect of adverse neighborhood- level factors is measurable at the 
biological level, even in children. Previous studies have linked violence with other indices of 
the SRS in children, yet our results are the first, to our knowledge, to examine the role of 
objective neighborhood environments, including neighborhood liquor and convenience 
stores, DV, and violent crime across biological stress markers. We observed substantial 
clustering at the neighborhood level for SRS markers, with significant association between 
these neighborhood environments and shorter TL, blunted recovery of cortisol levels, and 
steeper diurnal rhythms. This finding suggests a powerful effect of neighborhood adversity, 
of which children may not be aware, but which nonetheless has a physiological 
consequence.
Results are consistent with previous findings that link family violence and shorter TL,10 as 
well as the findings by Shalev and colleagues.12 Our study extends previous studies by 
showing that the effects of neighborhood violence operate beyond family-level adversity. 
The findings on cortisol levels and reactivity help clarify the limited literature on exposure to 
violence, which found that greater exposure to violence is associated with both heightened 
reactivity4 and blunted cortisol levels and reactivity.28 In a community sample of children 
with relatively protracted exposure to violence,4 heightened cortisol functioning is thought 
to reflect vigilance to potential threats.16 As in other urban populations,28 however, children 
in our study experienced a wide range of adversity that together culminates in a blunted HPA 
axis profile. Extant theory does not suggest that this blunted arousal is maladaptive but 
rather may reflect a biological shielding from chronic danger signals.29
It may seem counterintuitive that we found steeper diurnal rhythms with greater exposure to 
violence, as early adversity is often linked with flattened diurnal rhythms.30,31 Nonetheless, 
steeper rhythms have been shown previously within populations exposed to violence,32 
particularly within the most at-risk youth. We speculate on 2 possible mechanisms built from 
the observation that the rhythm was altered in the evening hours when psychosocial effects 
predominate over genetically mediated influences on the HPA axis.33 First, steep rhythms 
may exist because youth with more neighborhood violence stay awake later at night in 
relatively chaotic environments. The evening sample might be provided later when a cortisol 
level would naturally be closer to its nadir. Second, it may be adaptive for these youth to 
have blunted cortisol levels across the evening hours, as stressors and unstructured events 
typically occur at these times. Although speculative, these findings illustrate a blunted HPA 
axis precisely when youth might need to be physiologically shielded from the stressors 
occurring in their ecological context.
Exposure to violence has been found to influence the underlying neurobiological pathways 
associated with threat perception, potentially altering an individual’s response to threat not 
only when exposed to violence but also on a day-to-day basis.34 In the case of exposure to

 neighborhood violence, the perpetrator is not necessarily known to the witness nor is the 
perpetrator the same person in all violent events, triggering an adaptive constant vigilance 
response leading to a greater biological toll. Furthermore, violence often manifests both 
inside and outside the home, making it difficult to have a safe haven where one feels 
buffered from stress. The effect of the neighborhood risk may also minimize any protective 
effect of neighborhood support.
Contrary to our hypothesis, witnessing violence did not universally mediate the objective 
association between neighborhood violence and biological stress. This finding is critical for 
community-based intervention and prevention efforts, as it suggests that the neighborhood 
may not necessarily operate through the home but rather exerts its own biological effect. The 
one exception to a direct effect of neighborhood violence was that we did observe an indirect 
effect wherein liquor and convenience stores operated through witnessing DV in the home in 
association with TL. Other untested family-level dynamics, such as family structure and 
parenting behavior, may be present in the lives of these children to affect biological 
stress.35,36
Limitations
Limitations to our study include the cross-sectional nature and lack of applicability to other 
demographic groups. We had no information on relevant transgenerational, preconception, 
prenatal, or early life exposures that may shape the SRS.37 Our neighborhood definitions are 
based on administrative boundaries and may not truly represent a child’s neighborhood; 
however, we used a variety of neighborhood exposure metrics for comparison. Furthermore, 
while some may argue that TL is not a SRS marker, we argue that TL reflects the cellular 
SRS given its sensitivity to oxidative stress, cellular metabolism, and environmental 
exposures in addition to correlates of poor health outcomes (2 critical features of an SRS 
biomarker). It is not a critical feature that the SRS links with cortisol level.38
Conclusions
With persistent exposure to violence in the United States and elsewhere, it is pertinent that 
we gain a deeper understanding of the role that violence plays in both early development and 
later health outcomes. As observed in our study, neighborhood violence may play a 
significant role in the SRS, even above and beyond secondary experiences or witnessing 
violence within the home and neighborhood. This complex association points to the larger 
structural forces that shape child development, including neighborhoods as critical arenas 
influencing child health trajectories, with specific neighborhood conditions that can be 
successfully targeted for even greater effect on public health.

 Key Points
Question
Could neighborhood violence and associated conditions lead to biological stress in 
children?
Findings
A matched, cross-sectional study of 85 children examined whether the rate of violent 
crime in a neighborhood, rate of reports of domestic violence, and density of liquor or 
convenience stores were associated with telomere length and cortisol functioning. Each 
neighborhood stressor was significantly associated with biological stress, with greater 
exposure associated with shorter telomere length, lower acute cortisol levels and blunted 
recovery, and steeper diurnal cortisol declines.
Meaning
Neighborhoods may be important targets for interventions to reduce the effect of 
exposure to violence in the lives of children.
