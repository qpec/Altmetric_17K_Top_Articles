Background: The health benefits of greenspaces have demanded the attention of policymakers since the 1800s.
Although much evidence suggests greenspace exposure is beneficial for health, there exists no systematic review
and meta-analysis to synthesise and quantify the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes.
Objective: To quantify evidence of the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes.
Methods: We searched five online databases and reference lists up to January 2017. Studies satisfying a priori
eligibility criteria were evaluated independently by two authors.
Results: We included 103 observational and 40 interventional studies investigating ~100 health outcomes.
Meta-analysis results showed increased greenspace exposure was associated with decreased salivary cortisol
−0.05 (95% CI −0.07, −0.04), heart rate −2.57 (95% CI −4.30, −0.83), diastolic blood pressure −1.97 (95%
CI −3.45, −0.19), HDL cholesterol −0.03 (95% CI −0.05, < -0.01), low frequency heart rate variability (HRV)
−0.06 (95% CI −0.08, −0.03) and increased high frequency HRV 91.87 (95% CI 50.92, 132.82), as well as
decreased risk of preterm birth 0.87 (95% CI 0.80, 0.94), type II diabetes 0.72 (95% CI 0.61, 0.85), all-cause
mortality 0.69 (95% CI 0.55, 0.87), small size for gestational age 0.81 (95% CI 0.76, 0.86), cardiovascular
mortality 0.84 (95% CI 0.76, 0.93), and an increased incidence of good self-reported health 1.12 (95% CI 1.05,
1.19). Incidence of stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, asthma, and coronary heart disease were reduced. For
several non-pooled health outcomes, between 66.7% and 100% of studies showed health-denoting associations
with increased greenspace exposure including neurological and cancer-related outcomes, and respiratory mor-
tality.
Conclusions: Greenspace exposure is associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational
studies. These results are indicative of a beneficial influence of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes.
However several meta-analyses results are limited by poor study quality and high levels of heterogeneity. Green
prescriptions involving greenspace use may have substantial benefits. Our findings should encourage practi-
tioners and policymakers to give due regard to how they can create, maintain, and improve existing accessible
greenspaces in deprived areas. Furthermore the development of strategies and interventions for the utilisation of
such greenspaces by those who stand to benefit the most.
1. Introduction
The idea that greenspaces are beneficial for the health of the po-
pulation became a generally accepted principle as early as the 1800s,
when various London-based organisations including the Commons
Preservation Society and the National Health Society called for the
preservation, creation, and accessibility of open spaces and parks
within crowded residential areas, referring to them as the “lungs” of the
town or city (Hickman, 2013). More recent Healthy City guidelines
from the WHO support this view, defining a healthy city as “one that
continually creates and improves its physical and social environments
and expands the community resources that enable people to mutually
support each other in performing all the functions of life and devel-
oping to their maximum potential” (World Health Organisation,
2016a). However, increasing urbanicity and modern lifestyles can mean
that opportunities for human contact with nature become less frequent.
The term greenspace is typically defined as open, undeveloped land
with natural vegetation (Centres for Disease Control, 2013), although it
also exists in many other forms such as urban parks and public open
spaces as well as street trees and greenery. Recognition of the health
benefits of greenspace exposure was one of the motivations of Oxford
General Practitioner William Bird MBE in establishing the UK’s first

 health walk scheme at his practice in 1995, leading to the foundation of
the English Walking for Health programme (WfH) (Walking for Health,
2016). Collaborations between health care providers and local nature
partnerships
are
becoming
increasingly
common
across
the
UK
(Bloomfield, 2014; Kent Nature Partnership, 2014; Naturally Healthy
Cambridgeshire, 2016; West of England Nature Partnership, 2016) and
further afield (New Zealand Ministry of Health, 2016), and aim to
better capitalise on ways the health of the natural environment is in-
trinsically linked to human health, striving for “healthy communities in
healthy environments” (Naturally Healthy Cambridgeshire, 2016). Yet
a challenge is to ensure those who might benefit the most have suffi-
cient opportunities for exposure to greenspace.
Socioeconomic health inequalities have consistently commanded
the attention of researchers and policymakers, with evidence that in-
equalities are currently increasing (Townsend et al., 1982). Environ-
mental factors form one of the many potential explanations as to their
cause (World Health Organisation, 2016b). Research has shown that
low income neighbourhoods have reduced greenspace availability
(Thomas Astell-Burt et al., 2014a, 2014b), and residents of more de-
prived neighbourhoods are less likely to use those greenspaces that
exist (Jones et al., 2009). Park quality and frequency of park use have
both been found to be higher amongst high-socioeconomic status (SES)
residents (Leslie et al., 2010). It should also be noted that living in a
greener neighbourhood has been linked with stronger greenspace-
health associations (Fuertes et al., 2014; McEachan et al., 2015;
Mitchell and Popham, 2007) and that income-related health inequal-
ities have been shown to be lower in greener neighbourhoods (Mitchell
and Popham, 2008). Greenspace may currently be overlooked as a re-
source for health and as part of a multi-component approach to de-
crease health inequalities.
Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the relationship
between nature and health and well-being. The first, is that natural and
green areas promote health due to the opportunities for physical ac-
tivity that they present. The health benefits of physical activity are well
understood, with literature suggesting that exercising in a green en-
vironment may be more salutogenic than exercising in an indoor gym
environment (Thompson Coon JB et al., 2011). Secondly, public
greenspaces have been associated with social interaction, which can
contribute towards improved well-being (Maas et al., 2009). Thirdly,
exposure to sunlight, which is thought to counteract seasonal affective
disorder (Rosenthal et al., 1984) and a source of vitamin D (van der
Wielen RdG et al., 1995) has been suggested as a causative pathway for
this relationship. A fourth is the “Old friends” hypothesis, which pro-
poses that use of greenspace increases exposure to a range of micro-
organisms, including bacteria, protozoa and helminths, which are
abundant in nature and may be important for the development of the
immune system and for regulation of inflammatory responses (Rook,
2013). Further potential mechanisms include the cooling influence of
bodies of greenspace on surface radiating temperature (SRT), which has
been documented as beneficial for health (Shin and Lee, 2005), as well
as the mitigation of greenspace against environmental hazards such as
air (Dadvand et al., 2012a; Yang et al., 2005) and noise pollution (De
Ridder et al., 2004; Wolch et al., 2014).
Whilst there is a growing body of literature attempting to quantify
the links between nature and improved health and well-being, sys-
tematic reviews in this area have largely focused on the association
between greenspace and a specific health outcome or behaviour such as
mortality (Gascon et al., 2016; van den Berg et al., 2015), obesity
(Lachowycz and Jones, 2011), birth weight (Dzhambov et al., 2014),
physical wellbeing (Thompson Coon JB et al., 2011) as well as the acute
health benefits of short term exposure to greenspace (Bowler et al.,
2010). Associations have been reported with improved perceived gen-
eral health, perceived mental health, as well as linking quality of
neighbourhood greenness with improved general health (van den Berg
et al., 2015). Physical activity in a natural outdoor environment has
been associated with reduced negative emotions and fatigue, increased
energy (Bowler et al., 2010; Thompson Coon JB et al., 2011), improved
attention, as well as greater satisfaction, enjoyment and a greater intent
to repeat the activity (Bowler et al., 2010). Additionally, meta-analyses
have shown increased residential greenspace to be significantly asso-
ciated with reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Gascon
et al., 2016), and increased birth weight (Dzhambov et al., 2014). Yet
no systematic review has attempted to determine the impact of green-
space on a wide range of health outcomes.
With this systematic review, we aim to address a major gap in the
evidence by identifying a set of health outcomes that have been in-
vestigated as being potentially associated with exposure to greenspace.
Health outcome terms were taken from the 10th revision of the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD-10), a medical classification list produced by the World
Health Organisation (World Health Organisation, 2015), with green-
space terms taken from a previous systematic review (Lachowycz and
Jones, 2011). The clarification of the magnitude of associations facil-
itates the investigation of potential underlying mechanisms in the re-
lationship between nature and health. Furthermore, clinicians may use
these findings to make recommendations to patients, which may convey
health benefits or assist in tackling socio-economic health inequalities.
2. Methods
This
systematic
review
followed
Cochrane
systematic
review
guidelines (Deeks et al., 2011), requirements of the NHS National In-
stitute of Health Research Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
(PROSPERO, 2015) and the PRISMA statement for reporting studies
that evaluate healthcare interventions (Liberati et al., 2009; Moher
et al., 2009). Methods of the analysis and inclusion criteria were spe-
cified in advance and documented in a protocol registered as
CRD42015025193 (PROSPERO, 2015) available on the PROSPERO
database http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.
2.1. Data sources
We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE (US National
Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.), EMBASE (Reed Elsevier
PLC, Amsterdam, Netherlands), AMED (Wolters Kluwer, Leicestershire,
UK), CINAHL (EBSCO Publishing, Massachusetts, U.S.) and PsycINFO
(American Psychological Association, Washington D.C., U.S.) from in-
ception to the end of September 2015, using specific search terms. The
search was then updated to include studies published until mid-January
2017. Databases were selected to best represent source material in
health, allied health and human science. Additionally, reference lists
from included studies and previous systematic reviews on greenspace
and health were hand searched.
2.2. Search strategy
Search terms associated with greenspace were developed with re-
ference to a previous systematic review on greenspace and obesity
(Lachowycz and Jones, 2011). For this review, we defined ‘greenspace’
as open, undeveloped land with natural vegetation as well as urban
greenspaces, which included urban parks and street greenery. Health
outcomes were taken from ICD-10 and then expanded to include the
relevant metrics, for example “diabetes” was expanded to include
“blood glucose” and glycated haemoglobin, commonly referred to as
“HbA1c.” To limit the scope of work, mental health and communicable
diseases were excluded from this review due to the volume of literature
after including them in initial scoping searches. Outcomes associated
with weight status and birth weight were also excluded, as systematic
reviews investigating them have recently been published (Dzhambov
et al., 2014; Lachowycz and Jones, 2011; Thompson Coon JB et al.,
2011).
The search strategy identified studies that contained at least one

629
 keyword or Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) from each list of search
terms. The search was piloted to ensure known studies were identified
and search syntax terms were adapted to suit each database. The
electronic database search terms are detailed in the online supple-
mentary table S2 (Appendix A). The search strategy also incorporated
limits to studies conducted on humans and studies written in English.
2.3. Study selection
All empirical studies where the outcome could be directly attribu-
table to greenspace were included, including both intervention and
observational studies. Titles and abstracts were examined by the pri-
mary reviewer (CB) to assess eligibility for the review using PICO cri-
teria:
• Participants: Male and female, no age restrictions
• Intervention: Exposure to greenspace
• Comparators:There is no comparator restriction
• Outcomes: Any health outcome
Further details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found
in Table 1, below.
Reviewer (CB) initially screened titles and abstracts to remove ob-
viously irrelevant articles, and then two reviewers screened all full text
articles independently (CB & AJ) to identify studies for inclusion in the
systematic
review.
Discrepancies
were
resolved
by
discussion.
Frequently abstracts used terms such as “neighbourhood environment”,
“built environment” or “neighbourhood facilities” and did not specify
the definition of these terms or if greenspace was investigated. These
studies were retrieved as full texts and screened for greenspace as an
outcome to ensure that none were excluded erroneously.
2.4. Data extraction
A data extraction sheet was developed by both authors to record the
study type, population, type of greenspace under investigation, green-
space measurement tool used, health outcome under investigation and
the outcomes. This was piloted on four manuscripts and refined ac-
cordingly. Data was extracted into a coding frame using Microsoft
Excel, synthesised and tabulated. All studies underwent methodological
critical appraisal using one of two checklists. For intervention studies,
we used a risk of bias tool employed by Hanson and Jones (Hanson and
Jones, 2015) and Ogilvie et al. (Ogilvie et al., 2007), (Table 3) which
was adapted for purpose. For observational studies the Lachowycz and
Jones (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) quality checklist (Table 2) was
adapted and used. Publication bias across studies within the meta-
analysis was tested with funnel plots using SE as the measure of study
size on the vertical axis and mean difference on the horizontal.
2.5. Narrative synthesis and meta-synthesis
Following critical review of each study, a narrative synthesis was
compiled. In order to be considered for meta-analysis, authors needed
to present either 1) mean difference, standard deviation (SD) and
sample size for both the highest and lowest greenspace categories, or 2)
number of cases of the reported condition/disease as well as sample size
for both highest and lowest greenspace categories. If the required data
was not reported in the paper, authors were contacted for this in-
formation. In total, 92 authors were contacted of which 32 responded
with the data required for meta-analysis. In order for a specific health
outcome to be considered for meta-analysis data from a minimum of
two studies was required. Where data was given for different sub-
groups, each was input separately and combined in meta-analyses using
the RevMan software package. All results are presented as forest plots
with 95% confidence intervals. The I2 statistic was calculated to
quantify the degree of heterogeneity between studies (Higgins et al.,
2003). A rough guide to interpreting heterogeneity is provided in the
Cochrane handbook and gives I2 values of 30–60% to represent mod-
erate heterogeneity and values of 50–90% to represent substantial
heterogeneity (Deeks et al., 2011). In cases of high heterogeneity, the
known heterogeneity was assessed (i.e. populations, study design, ex-
posure etc) to ensure that a meta-analysis was appropriate. A random
effects model was employed for all meta-analyses as it is considered to
represent a more conservative approach, suitable for cases of high
heterogeneity (Higgins and Green, 2011).
Sensitivity analysis was then undertaken, which included studies
which only scored 9 or above (out of a total of 11) in either the risk of
bias tool or quality appraisal checklist, meaning that all but 2 risk of
bias/quality checklist criteria had been met.
3. Results
The initial database search yielded 10,430 studies, of which 8986
were removed as duplicates or as clearly irrelevant after reviewing ti-
tles. A further 6 studies were retrieved from reference lists of review
articles. The abstracts of 1444 studies were screened and any that did
not provide enough information were retrieved for full text examina-
tion. A total of 247 papers were read as full texts to be assessed for
eligibility. After independent assessment by the second reviewer (AJ),
143 studies met the inclusion criteria and were eligible to be included
in the synthesis. The review flow chart is detailed in Fig. 1. The char-
acteristics and synthesised results for all 143 papers are detailed in
supplementary table S1 (Appendix A).
3.1. Study characteristics
Although there was no date restriction on the search, 96% of the
articles were studies from the past 10 years, illustrating recent growth
in interest in greenspace and health, with no papers prior to 1984
meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were in 20 different countries.
Although 50% of studies were in Europe, the country with the highest
frequency of included studies was Japan with 24. The populations
under investigation varied greatly in size, with the smallest an inter-
vention study of 9 participants (Ochiai et al., 2015), the largest study
using primary data collection presented results for 2593 primary
schoolchildren (Dadvand et al., 2015), and the largest study using
routinely collected data used 2011 UK census data with a population
of > 63 million (Wheeler et al., 2015). In some papers, the number of
participants was not reported.
Eleven different types of greenspace exposure were measured, the

 most common of which was neighbourhood greenspace (including re-
sidential greenspace, street greenery and tree canopy) measured by 56
studies, followed by greenspace-based interventions and proximity to a
large greenspace. Several randomised studies compared a known green
environment (i.e. a park or forest) with an urban or indoor environ-
ment. One study examined whether viewing trees through a hospital
window had any association with post-operative recovery time when
compared with a window view of a wall with no trees (Ulrich, 1984).
One included study investigated both green and blue (water) space
(Burkart et al., 2016). Studies investigating blue space alone with no
investigation of greenspace exposure were excluded at the full text
screening stage. A variety of greenspace measurement tools were used,
including Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology (CeH) land cover map, and tree canopy and
street tree data, as well as subjective measures of greenness such as self-
reported quality of neighbourhood greenspace and self-reported fre-
quency of walking in a green area.
Within the 143 studies, 40 were interventional and the remainder
observational. Out of the 40 interventional studies, 27 were in-
vestigating the association between shinrin-yoku and various health
outcomes. Shinrin yoku, or “forest bathing” is a popular practice in
Japan and neighbouring countries, and is defined as “taking in the at-
mosphere of the forest” (Park et al., 2010). It is said to have health-
promoting properties and to reduce stress (Park et al., 2010). Partici-
pants of shinrin-yoku spend time in the forest either sitting or lying
down, or walking through the forest. In studies investigating forest
bathing, a control group carried out the same activity in an urban en-
vironment. These studies typically had small numbers of participants
(between 9 and 280 participants).
Of the 103 observational studies, 35 were cohort studies and 69
cross-sectional, including 18 large scale ecological studies investigating
environmental influences on health amongst the population using
census data. Almost 100 health outcomes were investigated, with most
manuscripts investigating more than one outcome. The most frequently
investigated health outcomes were cardiovascular, including cardio-
vascular mortality, blood pressure, heart rate and incidence of angina
and myocardial infarction. Other commonly reported health outcomes
included pregnancy outcomes, self-reported health, mortality (all-
cause, respiratory and intentional self-harm), and diabetes, as well as
various blood biomarkers. The individual health outcomes investigated
by each study are detailed in the table of study characteristics, sup-
plementary table S1 (Appendix A).
3.2. Study quality
All 143 articles were assessed for quality using adapted versions of
the Lachowycz and Jones checklist (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) for
observational studies (Table 2) and the Hanson and Jones and Ogilvie
et al. risk of bias tool (Hanson and Jones, 2015; Ogilvie et al., 2007) for
interventional studies (Table 3). No study was excluded due to a low
quality score. Assessments of quality were initially made by the first
reviewer (CB) and then all studies were cross-checked by one other (AJ,
SH or EC) for discrepancies.
An inter-rater reliability analysis using the κ statistic was performed
and found κ 0.937, p < 0.001 representing substantial agreement. Full
consensus was reached after discussion. In the case that a checklist item
consistently brought up discrepancies, clarification of the definition of
the item was discussed. Individual quality analysis scores can be found
in the supplementary tables S5 (observational studies) and S6 (inter-
vention studies) (Appendix B).

 For the 103 observational studies assessed using the Lachowycz and
Jones checklist (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) detailed in Table 2, scores
ranged from 4 (one study) to 11 (one study), out of a total of 11 criteria.
Only 12.6% of studies scored ≤ 7, with 39.8% of studies scoring 9 out
of 11. The two checklist criteria which were the most recurrently
missing from were “5. Did the green space measure include information on
type of greenspace?” and “6. Use of greenspace was measured and included
in the analysis”.
For the 40 interventional studies assessed using the Hanson and
Jones and Ogilvie et al. risk of bias tool (Hanson and Jones, 2015;
Ogilvie et al., 2007) detailed in Table 3, scores ranged from 5 (one
study) to 11 (one study) out of a total of 11 criteria. Only 7.7% of
studies scored ≤ 7, with 66.7% of studies scoring 9 out of 11. The two
checklist criteria which were the most recurrently missing from studies
were “5. Did the authors show that there was no evidence of a concurrent
intervention which could have influenced the results?” and “6. Were the
study samples shown to be representative of the study population?”
3.3. Meta-analysis
When extracting information from papers for meta-analysis, ‘high’
and ‘low’ greenspace exposure was defined based on the highest and
lowest exposure categories provided in each paper. These were typi-
cally the highest or lowest quartile or quintile of exposure.” Commonly
reported outcome measures enabled meta-analysis of 24 health out-
comes, summarised in Table 4 and presented in full in supplementary
Figs. S2-S25 (Appendix B). Statistically significant health denoting as-
sociations between high versus low greenspace exposure groups were
identified for self-reported health, type II diabetes (Fig. 2), all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality, diastolic blood pressure (Fig. 3), salivary
cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and HDL cholesterol as
well as preterm birth and small size for gestational age births. Reduc-
tions were also found for incidence of stroke, hypertension, dyslipi-
daemia, asthma, and coronary heart disease, as well as improvements in
systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and gestational age.
However these results were not statistically significant.
Zero heterogeneity was reported for 8 of the analyses, 6 reported
moderate heterogeneity (30–60%) with 9 having substantial hetero-
geneity (> 60%). This suggests substantial heterogeneity between
studies for heart rate, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, self-reported
health, preterm birth, diabetes, all-cause mortality, small size for ge-
stational age, hypertension and asthma. The I2 score for the good self-
reported health meta-analysis was 100%, indicating very high levels of
inconsistency between studies. Using funnel plots, all studies were
identified as visually symmetrical with a narrow spread at the top of the
funnel indicating precision with results close to the pooled estimate and
without bias towards smaller studies. Supplementary Fig. S1 (Appendix
B) shows an example funnel plot.
To test whether significant meta-analysis results were due to
inclusion of poor quality studies, sensitivity analysis was conducted
where possible. Meta-analysis was repeated with only studies that
scored ≥9 in either the quality appraisal checklist or risk of bias tool.
This was only possible for heart rate, which showed a stronger effect
size −3.46 (95% CI −4.05, −2.88) (2 studies removed), systolic blood
pressure, which decreased in effect size and remained statistically non-
significant −0.49 (95% CI −1.20, 0.22) (2 studies removed), and self-
reported good health, which decreased in effect size and lost sig-
nificance 1.06 (95% CI 0.96, 1.18) (6 studies removed). Table 6 shows
the results from this sensitivity analysis. Fasting blood glucose, cho-
lesterol, HbA1c, asthma, and triglycerides meta-analyses were not
possible to include as there was only one remaining high quality study.
The remaining meta-analyses consisted only of studies scoring ≥9, and
so sensitivity analysis was not possible.
3.4. Non-pooled health outcomes
Meta-analysis was not possible for a number of health outcomes
including cancer, respiratory mortality, neurological outcomes, and
various biomarkers, as no two studies presented results on comparable
outcomes. Three studies reported on cancer outcomes and found that
living in the highest quartile of greenspace was associated with a sig-
nificantly reduced risk of prostate cancer (Demoury et al., 2017), OR
0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92), as well as reduced incidence of overall cancer
mortality HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78, 0.97) (James et al., 2016), whilst an
Australian study found a significant increased risk of skin cancer for
participants living in the highest greenspace quartile OR 1.07 (95% CI
1.01, 1.14) Astell-Burt et al., 2014a, 2014b). One study found living in
the highest quartile of greenspace to be associated with reduced in-
cidence of respiratory mortality (James et al., 2016) HR 0.66 (95% CI
0.52, 0.84). In terms of neurological outcomes, one study found that
living in a neighbourhood with a low % of greenspace was associated
with deficits in motor development in children (Kabisch et al., 2016),
whilst another found no association between greenspace and cognitive
development (Ward et al., 2016). A number of studies investigated a
variety of biomarkers including natural killer cells (Kim et al., 2015), C-
reactive protein (Mao et al., 2012b), and perforin (Jia et al., 2016).
Individual study results can be found in the table of study character-
istics, supplementary table S1 (Appendix A).
4. Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of 143 studies provides
evidence that exposure to greenspace is associated with wide-ranging
health benefits. Meta-analyses results have shown statistically sig-
nificant health-denoting associations for salivary cortisol −0.06 (95%
CI −0.07, −0.04), heart rate −3.47 (95% CI −4.04, −2.90), diastolic
blood pressure −1.97 (95% CI −3.45, −0.49), HDL cholesterol −0.03
(95% CI −0.05, < -0.01), and significant improvements in the HF

comes preterm birth 0.87 (95% CI 0.80, 0.94), and small size for ge-
stational age 0.81 (95% CI 0.76, 0.86). A significant increase in
incidence of reporting good health was also found 1.12 (95% CI 1.05,
1.19). Some of the meta-analyses results had high levels of hetero-
geneity (Tables 4, 5), and should therefore be interpreted with caution.
Included studies investigating non-pooled health outcomes also re-
ported salutogenic associations for health outcomes such as cancer
outcomes, respiratory mortality, sleep duration, various biomarkers,
and neurological outcomes.
This review has comprehensively sought out empirically-reported
studies investigating the association between greenspace and a wide
range of health outcomes across five databases, covering a large
number of relevant international journals. It has extensively analysed
143 different studies with the combined population size of > 290
million. It has also extracted information for 24 novel meta-analyses to
provide evidence of health benefits. A further major strength of this
review is its inclusivity; studies were not excluded based on study de-
sign or type of greenspace, and as a result a broad range of greenspace
exposures and health outcomes were identified by the 143 included
studies. However, the inclusivity of this study can also be viewed as a
limitation due to high heterogeneity across studies, and difficulties in
comparing results from small-scale intervention studies and much
larger ecological cross-sectional studies or in comparing studies that
used objective measurements of greenspace with those that did not.
A number of studies reported stronger associations between green-
space exposure and self-reported health, birth outcomes and morbidity
for those from low socioeconomic status (SES) groups and the most
deprived areas (Agay-Shay et al., 2014; Dadvand et al., 2012b; Mitchell
and Popham, 2008; Roe et al., 2016). Similar stronger associations were
reported for birth outcomes and self-reported health for those with <
10 years in education. Increased neighbourhood greenness was also
reported to decrease the effect of income deprivation on both all cause
and cardiovascular mortality by one study (Mitchell and Popham,
2008). However results by SES group were only presented by a small
number of studies so it was not possible to conduct a formal subgroup
analysis, or to determine if this was the case for other health outcomes.
Greenspaces may form part of the arsenal for combatting health in-
equalities, and our findings should encourage practitioners and pol-
icymakers to give due regard to how they can create, maintain and
improve existing accessible greenspaces in deprived areas. Further-
more, the development of strategies and interventions for the utilisation
of such greenspaces by those of low SES status who stand to benefit the
most is needed.
Whilst previous systematic reviews have examined the relationship
between greenspace and specific health outcomes or behaviours, this
review investigated the potential impact of greenspace on a broad range
of health outcomes. Our findings are consistent with previous sys-
tematic review results that suggest that greenspace is beneficial for
health. Lachowycz and Jones (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) found that
68% of papers included in their systematic review found a positive or
weak association between greenspace and obesity-related health in-
dicators, although findings were inconsistent and mixed. Thompson
Coon et al. investigated the association between exercising in outdoor
natural areas and health, and found physical activity in natural en-
vironments to be associated with increased energy, improved mental
wellbeing and higher levels of intent in repeating the activity at a later
date (Thompson Coon JB et al., 2011). However, consistent with our
systematic review, poor methodological quality of the available evi-
dence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures hamper the inter-
pretation and extrapolation of these findings (Thompson Coon JB et al.,
2011). Bowler et al. looked at studies comparing measurements of
health in outdoor natural and synthetic environments such as indoor or
outdoor built environments (Bowler et al., 2010). Findings suggest that
a walk or run in a natural environment may convey greater health
benefits than the same activity in a synthetic environment. This is
consistent with the findings of Hanson and Jones, who conducted a
systematic review and meta-analysis on outdoor walking groups
(Hanson and Jones, 2015). Outdoor walking groups were found to
significantly improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
body fat percentage, BMI, cholesterol, V02 max, depression and phy-
sical functioning, with no adverse side effects reported (Hanson and

 Jones, 2015). As with Bowler’s systematic review and our findings, the
evidence suggests that walking in a greenspace or natural area may
offer health benefits above walking in an urban environment or on a
treadmill (Bowler et al., 2010). Putting aside the health benefits of
physical activity, which have been widely documented (Bize et al.,
2007; Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010; Lawlor and Hopker, 2001; Penedo
and Dahn, 2005; Warburton et al., 2006), the associations between
greenspace and health found in this study suggests that “green exercise”
may have additional health benefits. In combination with the findings
of our systematic review, it can be seen that there is a convincing body
of evidence to suggest that greenspace is beneficial for health, and also
that greenspace may be currently undervalued as a resource for health.
Studies consistently reported that there are several substantial gaps in
knowledge remaining in this field, most commonly the mechanisms
underlying the relationship between greenspace and health.
A high proportion of studies included in meta-analyses investigated
Shinrin-yoku or forest-based interventions. Although 27 studies in-
vestigated the association between forest-based environments and
health, only 5 looked at levels of street trees and tree canopy, with
mixed results. It remains to be seen if the health benefits associated
with forest bathing can be replicated in an urban environment by in-
creasing street greenery and urban greenspace. Research in this field
may inform national guidelines on the recommended number of trees
necessary in urban and deprived areas to convey health benefits to the
local populations.
A strength of this review is that all papers underwent rigorous cri-
tical appraisal using one of two carefully chosen tools; the Lachowycz
and Jones checklist (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) for observational
studies and the Hanson and Jones and Ogilvie et al. risk of bias tool
(Hanson and Jones, 2015; Ogilvie et al., 2007) for intervention studies.
Both tools were tailored for the purposes of this review and every study
underwent quality appraisal by two reviewers, with a high level of
inter-rater agreement. However, 58.3% of the observational studies and
77% of the interventional studies scored ≥9 out of 11 in their re-
spective quality appraisal tools. This limited heterogeneity in study
quality may suggest that the tools may not have been sensitive enough
to capture certain aspects of quality of the studies reviewed and dif-
ferentiate between studies. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using
only high quality studies (studies scoring ≥9). This cut-off point was
chosen priori to balance the need to retain some studies with a need to
understand how sensitive the results were to the inclusion of weaker
studies. A limitation of this cut off point is that it implied that all quality
appraisal criteria were of equal value, which may not be the case. Re-
sults remained consistent for heart rate and systolic blood pressure,
however self-reported good health had a reduced effect size and lost
statistical significance, with the drop in statistical significance being
possibly explained by the lower power of this sub-analysis. Further-
more, the self-reported good health meta-analysis had an I2 of 100%,
indicating a high risk of statistical heterogeneity. This result should
therefore be interpreted cautiously.
A limitation of this review is that the search was restricted to
manuscripts published in the English language. Furthermore, several
health outcomes were only investigated in one or two studies, limiting
comparability of results, for example, for respiratory mortality and
various cancers. There were many differences between study popula-
tions; for example the largest and smallest study populations were > 63
million (Wheeler et al., 2015) and 9 participants (Ochiai et al., 2015)
respectively. The exclusion of mental health and communicable disease
outcomes, whilst done pragmatically, is also a limitation of this review.
One key area for further research is how health professionals and
policymakers might encourage patients to increase their exposure or
even time spent in green spaces, and in particular to target those from
lower SES areas. A number of included studies in this review reported a
stronger relationship between greenspace and health outcomes for
participants who were from low SES neighbourhoods, had lowest
education levels, or those who were from areas with the lowest sur-
rounding neighbourhood greenness. However, results were often not
presented according to SES, meaning that formal subgroup analysis by
SES level was not possible. Therefore it is not known if this may be the
case for other health outcomes. Evidence has shown increased odds of
higher psychosocial distress in residents of low SES areas (Kessler,
1982). Our meta-analysis results suggest that greenspace exposure may
reduce salivary cortisol, a physiological marker of stress. Further stu-
dies investigating greenspace and heath but with a focus on SES groups
and subsequent health inequalities are required to fill this gap in the
literature.
From the quality appraisal, it was evident that there were two cri-
teria recurrently missing from both observational and intervention
studies. For the 103 studies assessed using the observational study
quality checklist (Lachowycz and Jones, 2011) (Table 2), these were “5.
Did the green space measure include information on type of greenspace?”
and “6. Use of greenspace was measured and included in the analysis”. For
the 40 intervention studies assessed using the risk of bias tool (Hanson
and Jones, 2015; Ogilvie et al., 2007) ( Table 3), these were “5. Did the
authors show that there was no evidence of a concurrent intervention which
could have influenced the results?” and “6. Were the study samples shown to
be representative of the study population?” Future research should take
this into consideration, with observational studies aiming to include

 data on type of greenspace under investigation and the participants’ use
of greenspace. Intervention studies should also aim to report on whe-
ther a concurrent intervention is in place, as well as commenting on the
representativeness of the population.
Although this systematic review has uncovered a large body of re-
search on the relationship between greenspace and health, there is a
paucity of literature on the mechanisms underlying this relationship.
Currently there are several suggested hypotheses. Greenspaces offer
opportunities for physical activity, social cohesion, and stress reduction
(Hartig et al., 2014), which each carry their own numerous health
benefits. Exposure to the diverse variety of bacteria present in natural
areas may convey immunoregulatory benefits and reduce inflammation
(Rook, 2013). Much of the literature on forest bathing suggests that
phytoncides (volatile organic compounds with antibacterial properties)
released by trees may explain the salutogenic properties of shinrin yoku
(Li et al., 2009; Tsunetsugu et al., 2010). Further research should build
on the findings of this systematic review by hypothesising and testing
the potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between green-
space and health. The associations between greenspace and mental
health outcomes and communicable diseases, both outcomes that were
not considered here, should also be explored further.
5. Conclusions
This review suggests that greenspace exposure is associated with
wide ranging health benefits, with meta-analyses results showing sta-
tistically significant associations with reduced diastolic blood pressure,
heart rate, salivary cortisol, incidence of type II diabetes and stroke, all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as health-denoting asso-
ciations with pregnancy outcomes, HRV, and HDL cholesterol, and self-
reported health. However some meta-analyses results are limited by
poor study quality and high levels of heterogeneity and should there-
fore be interpreted with caution. Increased greenspace exposure was
also associated with non-pooled outcomes including neurological out-
comes, respiratory mortality, and increased sleep duration. The findings
of this systematic review suggest that the creation, regeneration and
maintenance of accessible greenspaces and street greenery may form
part of a multi-faceted approach to improve a wide range of health
outcomes.
