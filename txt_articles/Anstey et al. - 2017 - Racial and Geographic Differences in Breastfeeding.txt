Racial and Geographic Differences in Breastfeeding — 
United States, 2011–2015
Erica H. Anstey, PhD1; Jian Chen, MS1; Laurie D. Elam-Evans, PhD2; Cria G. Perrine, PhD1
Breastfeeding provides numerous health benefits for infants 
and mothers alike. The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately the 
first 6 months of life and continued breastfeeding with 
complementary foods through at least the first year (1). 
National estimates indicate substantial differences between 
non-Hispanic black (black) and non-Hispanic white (white) 
infants across breastfeeding indicators in the United States (2). 
CDC analyzed 2011–2015 National Immunization Survey 
(NIS) data for children born during 2010–2013 to describe 
breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity through 6 months and 
duration at 12 months among black and white infants. Among 
the 34 states (including the District of Columbia [DC]) with 
sufficient sample size (≥50 per group), initiation rates were 
significantly (p<0.05) lower among black infants than white 
infants in 23 states; in 14 of these states (primarily in the 
South and Midwest), the difference was at least 15 percentage 
points. A significant difference of at least 10 percentage points 
was identified in exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months 
in 12 states and in breastfeeding at 12 months in 22 states. 
Despite overall increases in breastfeeding rates for black and 
white infants over the last decade, racial disparities persist. 
Interventions specifically addressing barriers to breastfeeding 
for black women are needed.
NIS is a national ongoing, random-digit–dialed cellular 
and landline telephone survey conducted among households 
with children aged 19–35 months (3). The survey primar-
ily is intended to estimate vaccination coverage rates for 
U.S. children. Questions on breastfeeding were added to 
the survey in 2001 and have since been used for national 
breastfeeding surveillance.
Because children are aged 19–35 months at the time of the 
NIS interview, each cross-sectional survey includes children 
born in 3 different calendar years. To increase sample size and 
allow for representative state-level analyses stratified by race, 
a cohort of children born during 2010–2013 was created by 
combining data from the 2011–2015 surveys. The Council of 
American Survey and Research Organizations response rates 
for the landline sample of NIS years 2011–2015 ranged from 
59.2% to 76.1%. Response rates for the cellular telephone 
sample of NIS years 2011–2015 ranged from 25.2% to 33.5%. 
The child’s breastfeeding history and race/ethnicity, and the 
mother’s age, education, household percent of poverty level, 
and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), were reported by 
the parent or guardian. Breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity 
through 6 months (only breast milk; no solids, water, or other 
liquids), and duration at 12 months were calculated among all 
infants and at the state level among black and white infants. 
Data were suppressed when the group’s sample size was <50 for 
that state. Breastfeeding estimates were weighted to adjust for 
multiple phone lines, mixed telephone use (landline and cel-
lular), household nonresponse, and the exclusion of phoneless 
households, and accounted for the complex sampling design of 
NIS (3). Statistical analyses were conducted using chi-square 
tests to determine whether estimates for black infants were sig-
nificantly different (p<0.05) from estimates for white infants.
Among all children born during 2010–2013, national esti-
mates for breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity through 6 months, 
and duration at 12 months were 79.2%, 20.0%, and 27.8%, 
respectively (Table 1). Breastfeeding estimates varied by race/
ethnicity, mother’s age and education, participation in WIC, 
and ratio of family income to the federal poverty threshold. 
Because black infants have consistently had the lowest rates 
of breastfeeding initiation and duration compared to other 
groups, the state-level estimates presented are limited to black 
and white infants (2).
Among the 34 states* with sufficient sample size for analytic 
comparison, breastfeeding initiation ranged from 37.0% in 
Kentucky to 90.8% in Minnesota among black infants, and 
from 65.1% in Kentucky to 96.3% in DC among white infants. 
The state-specific percentage point differences (calculated as 
prevalence among white infants minus prevalence among black 
infants) in breastfeeding initiation between white and black 
infants ranged from −4.8 to 36.0, with substantial dispari-
ties in the South and Midwest. In 14 states, the difference in 
breastfeeding initiation between white and black infants was 
greater than 15 percentage points and the disparity exceeded 
25 percentage points in seven of these states. The percentage 
point differences between white and black infants in exclusive 
breastfeeding through 6 months ranged from −4.2 in Rhode 
Island to 17.8 in Wisconsin, and at 12 months duration, the 
difference ranged from −4.4 in Minnesota to 31.6 in DC. A 
percentage point difference of ≥10 between white and black

 * Breastfeeding initiation was determined based on response to the question, “Was [child] ever breastfed or fed breast milk?” Breastfeeding duration was assessed 
by asking, “How old was [child’s name] when [child’s name] completely stopped breastfeeding or being fed breast milk?” Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as 
only breast milk (no solids, no water, and no other liquids). To assess the duration of exclusive breastfeeding participants were asked two questions about age: 
1) “How old was [child’s name] when they were first fed formula?” and 2) “How old was [child’s name] when they were first fed anything other than breast milk or 
formula?” (including juice, cow’s milk, sugar water, baby food, or anything else that [child] might have been given, even water). Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity 
rates are estimated among all infants included in the survey and not only infants whose mothers started breastfeeding.

infants for 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding was observed 
in 12 states and for 12 months of breastfeeding in 22 states 
(Figure). These differences were significant (p<0.05) in each 
of these states (Table 2).
Discussion
National estimates of breastfeeding initiation and duration 
have consistently improved among black and white infants 
over the past decade (2); however, the difference in breastfeed-
ing rates between black and white infants remains substantial. 
Among infants born during 2010–2013, the gap in breast-
feeding initiation between black and white infants was 17.2 
percentage points, only slightly less than the 19.9 percentage 
point difference between black and white infants born during 
2003–2006 (a timeframe when the methodology only included 
the landline sample) (4). The percentage point difference in the 
rate of exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months between black 
and white infants was 7.8 for children born during 2003–2006 
(CDC, Nutrition Branch, unpublished data, 2016), and 8.5 for 
infants born during 2010–2013. The percentage point difference 
in the rate of breastfeeding at 12 months between black and 
white infants was 9.7 among infants born during 2003–2006 
and 13.7 among infants born during 2010–2013 (4).
Multiple factors influence a woman’s decision to start and 
continue breastfeeding. Lack of knowledge about breastfeed-
ing, unsupportive cultural and social norms, concerns about 
milk supply, poor family and social support, and unsupportive 
work and childcare environments make it difficult for many 
mothers to meet their breastfeeding goals (5). Certain barri-
ers are disproportionately experienced by black women (e.g., 
earlier return to work, inadequate receipt of breastfeeding 
information from providers, and lack of access to professional

breastfeeding support), (6). For example, although evidence-
based maternity care practices that support breastfeeding have 
been reported to increase breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity, 
and duration (5), black mothers might not have consistent 
access to these supportive practices. A study of hospital support 
for breastfeeding indicated that facilities located in zip codes 
with higher percentages of black residents than the national 
average were less likely to meet five indicators for supportive 
breastfeeding practices (early initiation of breastfeeding, limited 
use of breastfeeding supplements, rooming-in, limited use of 
pacifiers, and post-discharge support), than those located in 
areas with lower percentages of black residents (7).
In 2011, The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support 
Breastfeeding outlined 20 action steps to support breastfeed-
ing across various sectors of society, including a call to better 
understand and address breastfeeding disparities (5). A U.S.-
based review of randomized trials evaluating breastfeeding 
interventions targeting minorities showed that group prenatal 
education, peer counseling interventions, breastfeeding-specific 
clinic appointments, and enhanced hospital practices/WIC-
based services positively affected breastfeeding outcomes 
among minority women (8). CDC is currently funding a 
hospital-based quality improvement initiative designed to 
support hospitals to implement evidence-based maternity care 
practices. Currently 93 U.S. hospitals participate in EMPower 
Breastfeeding: Enhancing Maternity Practices† in 24 states, 
primarily in the South and Midwest, where the disparities in 
breastfeeding rates between black and white infants is greatest.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, estimates do not account for other factors poten-
tially associated with lower breastfeeding rates among black 
infants, e.g. in-hospital formula feeding and socioeconomic 
characteristics such as percentage of poverty level and participa-
tion in WIC. However, previous analyses have indicated that 
racial differences exist that are independent of socioeconomic 
and demographic factors (9). Nevertheless, because the racial 
disparity in breastfeeding might depend on factors such as 
income and education, future studies examining the interac-
tions among these factors are warranted to understand the 
independent contribution of each factor. Second, breastfeeding 
behaviors were self-reported by the respondent retrospectively 
when the child was aged 19–35 months, which could be sub-
ject to recall bias and social desirability. However, maternal 
recall for estimating breastfeeding initiation and duration is 
a reasonably valid and reliable method (10). Finally, despite 
combining survey years, in 17 states, the sample size for black 
infants was less than 50, limiting the ability to assess racial 
differences in all states.

 * Breastfeeding initiation was determined based on response to the question, “Was [child] ever breastfed or fed breast milk?” Breastfeeding duration was assessed by asking, “How old was 
[child’s name] when [child’s name] completely stopped breastfeeding or being fed breast milk?” Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as only breast milk (no solids, no water, and no other 
liquids). To assess the duration of exclusive breastfeeding participants were asked two questions about age: 1) “How old was [child’s name] when they were first fed formula?” and 2) “How 
old was [child’s name] when they were first fed anything other than breast milk or formula?” (including juice, cow’s milk, sugar water, baby food, or anything else that [child] might have 
been given, even water). Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates are estimated among all infants included in the survey and not only infants whose mothers started breastfeeding.
 † Among children born during 2010–2013.
 § The number of respondents varies depending on the indicator.
 ¶ Referent group is non-Hispanic whites. Estimate is statistically significant (p<0.05).
 ** Not available. Data were suppressed when sample size was <50.

Summary 
What is already known about this topic?
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive 
breastfeeding for the first 6 months of a baby’s life and 
continued breastfeeding with complementary foods until age 
≥12 months. Over the past decade, national estimates of 
breastfeeding initiation and duration have consistently 
improved among both non-Hispanic black (black) and 
non-Hispanic white (white) infants; however, differences in 
breastfeeding rates by race have persisted.
What is added by this report?
Differences in breastfeeding rates between black and white 
infants vary by state, and rates are lower among blacks in most 
states. Breastfeeding initiation rates were significantly lower 
among black infants in 23 states; in 14 of these states, the 
difference was at least 15 percentage points. A significant 
difference of at least 10 percentage points in exclusive 
breastfeeding through 6 months was found between black 
and white infants in 12 states, and at 12 months of breastfeed-
ing in 22 states.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To increase the rate of breastfeeding among black infants, 
interventions are needed to address barriers experienced 
disproportionately by black mothers, including earlier return to 
work, inadequate receipt of breastfeeding information from 
providers, and lack of access to professional breastfeeding 
support. Enhanced understanding of these barriers could 
improve the effectiveness of interventions.
The difference in breastfeeding indicators among black and 
white infants by state continues to be substantial. Though 
certain interventions targeting black families have positively 
affected breastfeeding outcomes, additional research is needed 
to better understand the underlying factors contributing to the 
widespread persistence of the gap in breastfeeding rates by race 
(6,8). To reduce the disparities in rates of breastfeeding between 
black and white infants, interventions need to specifically 
address breastfeeding barriers experienced disproportionally 
by black mothers (6).
