Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, represent a potential mechanism for environmental impacts on human disease.
Maternal smoking in pregnancy remains an important public health problem that impacts child health in a myriad of ways and has
potential lifelong consequences. The mechanisms are largely unknown, but epigenetics most likely plays a role. We formed the Preg-
nancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium and meta-analyzed, across 13 cohorts (n ¼ 6,685), the association between
maternal smoking in pregnancy and newborn blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites (CpGs) by using the Illumina 450K
BeadChip. Over 6,000 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to maternal smoking at genome-wide statistical significance (false
discovery rate, 5%), including 2,965 CpGs corresponding to 2,017 genes not previously related to smoking and methylation in either
newborns or adults. Several genes are relevant to diseases that can be caused by maternal smoking (e.g., orofacial clefts and asthma)
or adult smoking (e.g., certain cancers). A number of differentially methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We observed
enrichment in pathways and processes critical to development. In older children (5 cohorts, n ¼ 3,187), 100% of CpGs gave at least nom-
inal levels of significance, far more than expected by chance (p value < 2.2 3 10�16). Results were robust to different normalization
methods used across studies and cell type adjustment. In this large scale meta-analysis of methylation data, we identified numerous
loci involved in response to maternal smoking in pregnancy with persistence into later childhood and provide insights into mechanisms
underlying effects of this important exposure.
Introduction
Despite years of advisories regarding health risks to the
developing fetus from maternal smoking, many pregnant
women still smoke, including 12.3% in the US.1 Maternal
smoking during pregnancy is regarded as a cause of low
birth weight, reduced pulmonary function (PLF [MIM:
608852]), orofacial clefts (OFC1 [MIM: 119530]), and sud-
den infant death syndrome (SIDS [MIM: 272120]) in
exposed newborns.2 Other adverse birth outcomes3 have

including asthma (ASRT [MIM: 600807]), otitis media
(OMS [MIM: 166760]), and neurobehavioral disorders.2
The mechanisms for the adverse health effects of
maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring remain
poorly understood.2 Recently, studies have examined the
potential role of epigenetic modifications such as DNA
methylation at specific CpG sites (CpGs). These include
studies examining genome-wide DNA methylation in
newborns in relation to maternal smoking in pregnancy
with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (27K)
BeadChip4–6 or the newer platform with wider coverage,
the HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip.7–10 A num-
ber of differentially methylated loci have been identified
in offspring in relation to maternal smoking in pregnancy
in individual studies (references in the Supplemental
Note). One study examined the top CpGs with respect to
timing of exposure and found that the signals reflect sus-
tained, rather than short-term, exposure to maternal smok-
ing during pregnancy,11 but this has not been evaluated
genome-wide. A few studies suggest that some of these
methylation signals persist into later childhood and
adolescence, but data are limited.9,12 The combination of
genome-wide data across studies via meta-analysis to
generate large sample sizes for the discovery of loci that
would not have been identified from individual studies
has been very successful in genetics, but this approach
has rarely been used with methylation data.
To address the impact of maternal smoking during preg-
nancy on newborns with much greater power, we recruited
13 birth cohort studies with data on maternal smoking
during pregnancy and DNA methylation in offspring

 Childhood Epigenetics consortium (PACE). We meta-
analyzed
harmonized
cohort-specific
associations
be-
tween maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNA
methylation in the offspring. We examined both sus-
tained maternal smoking and any smoking during preg-
nancy. We also examined persistence of DNA methylation
patterns related to maternal smoking in newborns among
older
children,
including
adjustment
for
postnatal
secondhand tobacco smoke exposure. For functional
follow-up of findings, we evaluated the associations be-
tween methylation status in the newly identified CpGs
and expression levels of nearby genes and performed
pathway and functional network analyses. This study rep-
resents a large and comprehensive evaluation of the
impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy on DNA
methylation in offspring.
Material and Methods
Participating Cohorts
A total of 13 PACE cohorts participated in the meta-analysis of
maternal smoking during pregnancy and 450K DNA methylation
in newborns. These studies, listed in alphabetical order, are the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), the
Center for Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas
(CHAMACOS), the Children’s Health Study (CHS), the GECKO
Drenthe cohort, the Generation R Study, Isle of Wight (IOW),
Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy (MeDALL), three inde-
pendent datasets from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort
Study (MoBa1, MoBa2, and MoBa3), the Norway Facial Clefts
Study (NFCS), the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST), and Project
Viva. MeDALL represents a pooled analysis of four cohorts with
coordinated methylation measurements: Infancia y Medio Ambi-
ente (INMA), Etudes des De
´terminants pre
´ et postnatals pre
´coces
du de
´veloppement et de la sante
´ de l’Enfant (EDEN), Children’s
Allergy Environment Stockholm Epidemiology study (BAMSE),
and Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy
(PIAMA). Two of the MeDALL cohorts contributed to the newborn
meta-analysis (INMA and EDEN). There were five studies with data
on older children: ALSPAC, Genes-environments and Admixture
in Latino Americans (GALA II), the Study to Explore Early Devel-
opment (SEED), MeDALL (INMA, EDEN, BAMSE, and PIAMA),
and an independent methylation dataset from BAMSE subjects.
Ethical approval for study protocols was obtained for all partici-
pating cohorts. Further information on this as well as the study
methods for each cohort are described in detail in the Supple-
mental Note.
For this paper, participating cohorts shared only results files
from in-house analyses. No individual data were shared for this
paper. Therefore, access to the individual cohort-level data for
the purpose of reproducing results would require individual data
transfer agreements to be negotiated with and approved by each
of the contributing cohorts.
Harmonization of Maternal Smoking Variables
Cohorts assessed maternal smoking during pregnancy via ques-
tionnaires completed by the mothers. The MoBa study (MoBa1
and MoBa2) also used cotinine measurements from maternal
blood samples taken during pregnancy as part of the definition
of maternal smoking during pregnancy. More details on the
cohort-specific smoking variables are in the Supplemental Note.
In a previous publication from the MoBa1 study, significant asso-
ciations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNA
methylation in newborns were driven not by transient smoking
that ended early in pregnancy but rather by sustained smoking
during pregnancy.11 Thus, each cohort ran separate models to
evaluate both sustained smoking and any smoking during preg-
nancy. The variable (yes/no) for sustained smoking during preg-
nancy was designed to capture women who smoked at least one
cigarette per day through most of pregnancy. To cleanly contrast
the effect of sustained smoking through pregnancy with that of
never smoking during pregnancy, we excluded women who re-
ported quitting smoking during pregnancy from the sustained
smoking models. The variable (yes/no) for any maternal smoking
during pregnancy was designed to capture any amount of smoking
during pregnancy, at any time, even if a woman reported quitting.
Because we did not exclude women who quit smoking during
pregnancy from the models representing any smoking during
pregnancy, the total sample sizes are slightly larger than those of
the models representing sustained smoking during pregnancy.
Genome-wide analyses use large sample statistics. We limited
meta-analyses to cohorts with at least 15 subjects in both the
exposed and unexposed groups. This excluded four cohorts
(CHAMACOS, CHS, IOW, and Project Viva) from the sustained
smoking models. However these cohorts did participate in the
meta-analysis of any smoking during pregnancy.
Methylation Measurements and Quality Control
Each cohort independently conducted laboratory measurements
and quality control. The samples for each cohort underwent bisul-
fite conversion via the EZ-96 DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research). Samples were processed with the Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip (Illumina) at Illumina
or in cohort-specific laboratories.
Quality control of samples was performed by each cohort and
failed samples were excluded on the basis of Illumina’s detection
p value, low sample DNA concentration, sample call rate, CpG-
specific percentage of missing values, bisulfite conversion effi-
ciency, gender verification with multidimensional scaling plots,
and other quality control metrics specific to cohorts. Cohorts
could also use validated, published statistical methods for normal-
izing their methylation data on the untransformed methylation
beta values (ranging from 0 to 1). Some cohorts also made inde-
pendent probe exclusions. More details are provided in the
Supplemental Note. For the meta-analysis, additional probe exclu-
sions were made across all cohorts. Specifically, we excluded con-
trol probes (n ¼ 65), probes that mapped to the X (n ¼ 11,232) or Y
(n ¼ 416) chromosomes, probes with an underlying SNP mapping
to the last five nucleotides of the probe sequence (N ¼ 9,168) as
previously described,7 and CpGs with an implausible (zero) value
for the SE (n ¼ 67). This left a total of 464,628 CpGs included in
the meta-analysis.
Cohort-Specific Statistical Analyses
Each cohort ran independent statistical analyses according to a
common pre-specified analysis plan. Robust linear regression
was used in R13 to evaluate the association between maternal
smoking during pregnancy and cord blood DNA methylation
for each probe while accounting for potential heteroskedas-
ticity and/or influential outliers. Each cohort ran the following
682
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 680–696, April 7, 2016
 covariate-adjusted statistical models: (1) the primary model, which
used sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy as the expo-
sure and the normalized betas as the outcome, (2) sustained
maternal smoking during pregnancy as the exposure and raw betas
(not normalized) as the outcome, (3) any maternal smoking during
pregnancy as the exposure and normalized betas as the outcome,
(4) any maternal smoking during pregnancy as the exposure and
raw betas as the outcome, and (5) sustained maternal smoking dur-
ing pregnancy as the exposure and normalized betas as the
outcome, with additional adjustment for cell type proportion. All
models were adjusted for maternal age, maternal education (or a
surrogate socioeconomic metric), parity, and technical covariates
such as batch or plate. Some cohorts used ComBat14 to account
for batch effects and therefore did not include batch or plate as co-
variates in the models with normalized betas (see Supplemental
Note). Additional correction for study design or sampling factors
was done as needed in some cohorts. Because maternal smoking
during pregnancy is not related to the child’s sex, it cannot be a
confounder and thus was not included in models. We did not
adjust for principal components (PCs) because not all cohorts
had genome-wide genotype data and cohorts with genotype data
had it only for a subset of subjects with methylation data. Further-
more, in one large cohort with PC data, models adjusted for PCs
showed little variation in the results (correlation of betas ¼ 0.991;
correlation of log(p values) ¼ 0.996) when compared to models
without this adjustment, despite a reduction in sample size. The
statistical models for cohorts with DNA methylation measured in
older children were the same, with the additional adjustment for
second-hand tobacco smoke exposure.
All cohorts independently estimated cell type proportion by us-
ing the reference-based Houseman method15 in the minfi pack-
age16 with the Reinius et al. dataset for reference.17 Cell type
correction was applied by inclusion of the six estimated cell type
proportions (CD8T, CD4T, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, granulo-
cytes) as covariates in cohort-specific statistical models.
Meta-analysis
We performed inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-anal-
ysis with METAL.18 We accounted for multiple testing by control-
ling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5%, implementing the
method by Benjamini and Hochberg.19 This method was applied
to all instances of FDR correction described in this paper unless
otherwise specified. CpGs with an FDR-corrected p value less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. CpGs that
were statistically significant based on the more stringent Bonfer-
roni correction (uncorrected p value < 1.08 3 10�7 to account
for 464,628 tests) were also noted.
To determine the robustness of our models and findings, we per-
formed an additional analysis in which we removed the cohorts of
non-European ancestry (Table S1). We compared the effect esti-
mates, SEs, and the distribution of the p values for the model to
the estimates for our primary model to evaluate the consistency
of our findings.
Examination in Older Children of CpGs Associated
with Smoking in Cord Blood
The FDR-significant CpGs identified in the primary model from
the newborn meta-analyses were followed up with a lookup repli-
cation approach in the results from five older children cohorts,
and FDR correction was applied to account for the number of
CpGs tested.
Literature Review to Identify Genes Previously
Associated with Smoking and Methylation
We performed a systematic literature review to determine which
CpGs represented findings not previously related to smoking
exposure and methylation in the literature. A query of NCBI’s
PubMed database was performed with the search terms ((‘‘DNA
Methylation’’[Mesh] OR methylation) AND (‘‘Smoking’’[Mesh]
OR smoking)) in order to be broad enough to capture all past
studies reporting such results. CpGs with previously reported as-
sociations with smoking, both from prenatal exposure or in
adults, were considered. This search yielded 789 results when per-
formed on March 1, 2015. All results were then reviewed by title
and abstract to determine whether they met inclusion criteria.
First, results were limited to those performed in healthy human
populations. That is, participants could not exclusively have
been drawn from disease cases and studies could not have been
performed only in cell lines or animals. Case-control analyses
that included healthy controls were accepted as meeting this
criterion, and no limitation was applied concerning the tissue
used for DNA extraction. Second, studies were required to have
performed DNA methylation analysis agnostically on a large scale
as opposed to targeted interrogation of candidate CpGs. This was
operationalized by including only analyses that examined >1,000
sites simultaneously. The Illumina 450K, 27K, and GoldenGate
arrays all met this criterion. Third, the exposure was restricted to
tobacco cigarette smoking. Related exposures, such as to other
forms of tobacco use or smoke exposure, were not included.
Lastly, studies had to have reported their significant results pub-
licly. Studies that failed to report p values or gene annotations
were excluded.
Review of the existing literature on the effect of smoking
on DNA methylation identified 25 publications meeting inclu-
sion criteria. Of these, 16 studies reported results for adult
smoking exposure,20–35 and nine provided results of association
between maternal smoking during pregnancy on child DNA
methylation.4,7–9,12,36–39 CpG level results (p values and gene
annotations) for sites showing significant association between
smoking exposure and DNA methylation were extracted and
compiled for comparison with the results from the meta-
analysis. Results were considered significant if they met the mul-
tiple testing criteria implemented within the publication. For
studies failing to implement any multiple testing correction,
a naive Bonferroni threshold for the number of tests per-
formed in the individual study was used. Genes previously
associated with either adult smoking or maternal smoking in
pregnancy (Table S6) were excluded from our list of meta-anal-
ysis results.
CpG Annotation
The official gene name was noted for each CpG via Illumina’s
genome coordinate.40 We enhanced the annotation provided by
Illumina by using the UCSC Genome Browser (including data
the RefSeq and Ensembl databases), as well as annotation data in
Bioconductor. All of the annotations use the human February
2009 (GRCh37/hg19) assembly. We also used the program Snipper
to annotate the nearest genes within 10 Mb of each CpG. We
include this expanded Snipper gene annotation in our tables
and the Discussion.
For selected genes, we used coMet41 to graphically display addi-
tional information about CpGs, including physical location, corre-
lation, statistical significance, and functional annotation.

 Enrichment Analysis
We evaluated whether the CpGs significantly associated with
smoking (based on the FDR p value < 0.05) were enriched, relative
to all CpGs analyzed, for several biologic annotations provided in
the Illumina annotation file. We assessed enrichment by using the
two-sided doubling mid p value of the hypergeometric test.24 We
also evaluated enrichment in a subset of CpGs mapping to im-
printed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) described by
Court et al.42
Pathway Analyses
We linked the CpGs significantly associated with smoking (based
on an FDR p value < 0.05) to genes on the basis of only the 450K
BeadChip annotation file.43 Probes lacking an annotated Entrez
Gene ID were filtered (n ¼ 1,971), as were duplicate gene entries
(n ¼ 1,473). A total of 2,629 unique gene identifiers were used
in gene ontology enrichment analysis with three different proce-
dures as described below.
This resulted in 2,235 genes that mapped to gene ontologies of
biological processes, and using topGO in R,44 we tested for gene
enrichment over the background array (16,119 unique annotated
Entrez Gene IDs) by using Fisher’s exact tests with a minimum of
five genes per node. In addition, we used the DAVID bioinformat-
ics resource45 to test for enrichment in gene ontology biological
processes with a threshold of five, and we used the Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure to control for false discoveries. Finally, we
used QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify rele-
vant signaling and functional pathways.
Functional Network Analysis
To construct a functional association network, it was desirable to
reduce the list of tested CpGs, so we prioritized the FDR-significant
CpGs from the primary model in a stepwise manner. First, we only
included those CpGs that were FDR significant in both the pri-
mary and cell-type-adjusted models (FDR p values < 0.05). Next,
we sorted these CpGs according to their effect size (beta coeffi-
cient), and selected the top quartile (n ¼ 980). The genes mapping
to these prioritized CpGs were then used as input for the construc-
tion of a functional interaction network. We used the GeneMANIA
algorithm, as well as its functional association data, including ge-
netic interaction, physical interactions, co-expression, shared pro-
tein domains, and co-localization networks.46 We selected the ‘‘all
available networks’’ option with a 500-gene output (accessed
March 11, 2015). Functional enrichment analysis was then per-
formed on all genes from the constructed interaction network
against Gene Ontology (GO) terms to detect significantly enriched
GO terms.47 FDR correction was applied to this analysis based on
the q value; a threshold of q < 0.01 was used.
Methylation Transcription Analysis
To further explore the associations between methylation and gene
expression, we performed methylation-expression analyses, evalu-
ating the association between the methylation status of CpGs and
differences in quantitative levels of gene expression. All identified
CpGs that reached FDR-corrected significance and that we identi-
fied as not previously reported in the literature were tested for as-
sociation with expression levels of genes within a region of 250 kb
upstream or downstream of the CpG48 (total region 500 kb) to
evaluate whether the CpG-methylation status influenced tran-
script levels of genes. We had two datasets available for this anal-
ysis. One dataset included mRNA gene expression (Illumina
HumanHT-12 v.4) and 450K methylation data, both from whole-
blood samples from 730 adults over 45 years of age in the
Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands.49 This gene expression dataset is
available at the GEO public repository under the accession num-
ber GEO: GSE33828. The second dataset included mRNA gene
expression (Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0) and
450K methylation data on whole-blood samples from 107 chil-
dren at 4 years of age from the INMA study in Spain. Study popu-
lation details for the Rotterdam Study and INMA are in the
Supplemental Note. In the Rotterdam dataset, 2,636 of the 2,965
CpGs examined mapped to a transcript within the 500 kb window.
We created residuals for mRNA expression after regressing out the
Houseman-estimated white-blood-cell proportions, the erythro-
cyte and platelet cell counts, fasting state, RNA quality score, plate
number, age, and sex on the mRNA expression levels by using a
linear mixed model. We then created residuals for DNA methyl-
ation, regressing out the Houseman-estimated white-blood-cell
proportions, age, sex, batch effects on the dasen-normalized50
beta-values of the CpGs by using a linear mixed model. We used
a linear regression model to evaluate the association between the
residuals of the mRNA expression levels and the residuals of the
dasen-normalized beta-values of the CpGs.
The INMA gene expression data were normalized with Expres-
sion Console Software from Affymetrix, and probes were clustered
to the transcript level. Only transcripts within the 500 kb window
of selected CpGs were considered in the analysis (n ¼ 45,076 tran-
scripts). To control for technical variation in the DNA methylation
dataset, a PC analysis of 600 negative control probes was per-
formed with 10,000 permutations, and the residuals of a linear
regression model including the first five PCs were estimated. The
effect of sex and Houseman cell-type-proportion estimates were
adjusted for in a second-stage linear regression model. Two models
were applied to control for technical and unwanted biological
variation when estimating gene expression residuals. In the first
one, sex and Houseman estimates were regressed out. In the sec-
ond one, 14 surrogate variables estimated with the sva R pack-
age14 were adjusted for in a second model including sex and
Houseman estimates. A linear regression model of residuals of
gene expression versus residuals of methylation was performed.
Multiple testing for both Rotterdam and INMA gene expression
analyses was controlled with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.
Examination of Polymorphic and Cross-Reactive
Probes
The list of FDR-significant CpGs was matched to the list of poly-
morphic and cross-reactive CpGs provided by Chen et al.51 to
identify potential problematic probes. We additionally performed
the dip test52 for unimodality for each CpG to test for non-unim-
odal distributions in the MoBa1 cohort (n ¼ 1,068). Also using the
MoBa1 cohort, we visually inspected density plots for each of the
probes that matched to the list of polymorphic probes from Chen
et al. to assess departures from unimodality, including from small
numbers of outlier values.

 methylation in newborns. Among these 6,685 newborns,
897 (13%) were exposed to sustained maternal smoking
during pregnancy and 1,646 (25%) were exposed to any
maternal smoking during pregnancy. We also included
five cohorts of older children (n ¼ 3,187, average age ¼
6.8 years); 266 children (8%) were exposed to sustained
smoking during pregnancy and 404 (13%) were exposed
to any maternal smoking during pregnancy. The cohort-
specific summary statistics for maternal smoking are pre-
sented in Table 1 and covariates in Table S1. The majority
of participants were of European ancestry (Table S1).
Meta-analysis
Our primary model evaluated the association between sus-
tained maternal smoking during pregnancy and differen-
tial DNA methylation in newborns by using normalized
methylation betas as the outcome, adjusting for covariates
(Figure 1). The cohort-specific lambdas and number of
CpGs included in each model are listed in Table S2. Among
the 6,073 CpGs with FDR significance (Table S3), 568 also
met the strict Bonferroni threshold for statistical signifi-
cance (p value < 1.08 3 10�7, correcting for 464,628 inde-
pendent tests). Results were quite robust to cell type
adjustment
(Table
S3):
all
568
Bonferroni-significant
CpGs from the primary model remained FDR significant
in the cell-type-adjusted model, and 78% were Bonferroni
significant in both models. The log10(p values) for the pri-
mary model and cell-type-adjusted models were highly
correlated (correlation coefficient ¼ 0.92 across all CpGs,
0.98 for the FDR-significant CpGs in the primary model,
Figure S1). Given the general similarity of the results before
and after cell type adjustment and the fact that the available
reference panel is from a small number (n ¼ 6) of adult
men,17 we regard the covariate-adjusted model as the
Table 1.

 primary model. The results for other models (the cell-type-
adjusted model, the model representing any smoking dur-
ing pregnancy, and the methylation model representing
sustained smoking during pregnancy associated with older
children) and the mean methylation values in newborns
and older children are shown for all 6,073 CpGs in Table S3.
Among the 6,073 FDR-significant CpGs, smoking during
pregnancy was associated approximately equally with
increased methylation (52%) and decreased methylation
(48%) (Figure 2). Out of the 3,932 CpGs that were also
FDR-significant after cell type adjustment, there were 967
CpGs in or within 10 Mb of the 1,185 genes we identified
in our systematic literature review (see Supplemental Note
and Table S4) as previously reported to be differentially
methylated in relation to smoking. This left 2,965 CpGs
(corresponding to 2,017 annotated mapped or nearest
genes) that had not previously been reported (Table S5;
genes highlighted in discussion shown in Table 2). For
comprehensive comparison with the previous literature,
we also present our results for all CpGs that were either
not FDR significant after cell type adjustment and/or that
annotated to genes already described in the literature as
related to smoking and methylation (n ¼ 3,108 CpGs,
Table S6). Our top finding among the 6,073 FDR-significant
CpGs was for AHRR (MIM: 606517) cg05575921 (p value ¼
1.64 3 10�193), which is the top most statistically signifi-
cant CpG in many other studies evaluating either personal
smoking or maternal smoking during pregnancy.
We found our results to be robust to different analytic
approaches. We present results from models using normal-
ized betas as the outcome. When using raw betas as the
outcome, we observed little difference in the results
(Spearman’s correlation coefficient ¼ 0.96 for regression
coefficients; 0.98 for log10[p values] for our significant find-
ings). Furthermore, exclusion of the one cohort with
newborns of non-European ancestry (NEST) from the
model representing sustained maternal smoking provided
similar results (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ¼ 0.99
for regression coefficients; 0.89 for log10[p values]).

Examination of Potentially
Polymorphic and Cross-Reactive
Probes
A total of 742 of the 6,073 FDR-signif-
icant CpGs overlapped with the list
of 70,889 potentially polymorphic
probes provided by a table of Chen
et al.51 Only 137 of the 6,073 FDR-sig-
nificant CpGs overlapped with the list of 29,233 cross-reac-
tive probes annotated by Chen et al. Many of the probes
flagged by Chen et al. are associated with very low-fre-
quency SNPs and thus are likely to have minimal impact
on results in most datasets. In visual inspection of the den-
sity plots of all 742 such probes, we flagged 19 CpGs as
having a possible deviation from unimodality (listed
in Table S7). However, results from the dip test52 applied
to all 6,073 FDR significant CpGs identified only four
CpGs as statistically significantly deviated from unimodal-
ity (FDR adjusted p < 0.05; cg11459648, cg17847044,
cg15028160, and cg25849281).
Persistence in Older Children of DNA Methylation
Related to Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy
Because of the smaller sample size and smaller proportion of
children exposed to maternal smoking in the older children
models, we had less statistical power than we did for the
newborn models. When we compared the coefficients for
newborns and older children for all 6,073 CpGs that were
significantly associated with maternal smoking in new-
borns, 4,403 (73%) had a consistent direction of effect and
all 6,073 (100%) gave nominal p values <0.05 for the older
children models, which is higher than the 5% expected by
chance alone (Kolmogorov p value < 2.2 3 10�16). Among
these, 3,722 CpGs (61%) had a weaker effect size (attenua-
tion) in the older children than in the newborns, but the
attenuation overall was very small in magnitude and not
significant (mean attenuation ¼ �0.00039, SD ¼ 0.0059).
Compared to CpGs in newborns, of the 148 CpGs that
met FDR significance at lookup replication level in the
older children (Table S8), 100% were consistent in the
direction of effect, and there was attenuation for 32%,
again small in magnitude and not significant (mean attenu-
ation ¼ �0.00008, SD ¼ 0.018).
Enrichment Analysis
For our 6,073 FDR-significant CpGs, we observed enrich-
ment for localization to CpG island shores (35% versus
686
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 680–696, April 7, 2016
 23% overall as compared to all CpGs on the array,
p value ¼ 2.8 3 10�100), enhancers (29% versus 22% over-
all, p value ¼ 5.7 3 10�45), and DNase hypersensitivity
sites (14% versus 12% overall, p value ¼ 2.8 3 10�7).
Conversely, we found relative depletion in CpG islands
(18% versus 31% overall, p value ¼ 9.1 3 10�116),
FANTOM promoters (2.5% versus 6.7% overall, p value ¼
2.1 3 10�49), and promoter-associated regions (13% versus
19% overall, p value ¼ 2.3 3 10�33). There was no
statistically significant enrichment or depletion of sites
mapping to imprinted DMRs (0.082% versus 0.16% over-
all, p value ¼ 0.107).
Pathway Analysis
Our pathway analyses indicated that the FDR-significant
CpG sites corresponded to genes enriched for several cate-
gories of biological processes, including anatomical devel-
opment, phosphate-containing compound metabolism,
nervous system development, and cell communication
processes (Figure S2). Based on DAVID, eight biological pro-
cesses were enriched, including GTPase signal transduc-
tion, neuronal differentiation, and protein kinase activity
(Figure S3). The top statistically significantly enriched dis-
eases and biofunctions identified through Ingenuity soft-
ware included tumor adhesion, neuron development, and
connective tissue differentiation (Figure S4).
Functional Network Analysis
Functional network analysis revealed 447 significantly
enriched GO terms after FDR correction was applied
(q value < 0.01 for this analysis, Table S9). The majority
of the enriched terms, and particularly the most statisti-
cally significant ones, pointed toward biological processes
related to cell, tissue, or organ development, proliferation,
morphogenesis, differentiation, growth, and other biolog-
ically relevant processes. There were also several en-
riched processes related to embryonic morphogenesis or
development.

 Methylation Transcription Analysis
To assess transcriptional effects related to methylation dif-
ferences, we investigated whether methylation status
correlated with gene expression levels for our 2,965 CpGs
associated with sustained maternal smoking in newborns
that we identified through literature review as not having
been previously reported. In the Rotterdam Study dataset
of adults, out of the 2,636 (of the 2,965) CpGs that we
were able to match to a gene transcript (þ/� 250 kb),
254 unique CpGs (343 total CpG-gene transcript associa-
tions) were significantly associated with expression of a
nearby gene in whole blood from adults (FDR p value <
0.05, Table S10). We observed strong associations for
several CpGs annotated to the same gene and correspond-
ing gene expression levels, most strikingly for IL32 (MIM:
606001), which had four CpGs associated with its expres-
sion, and HOXB2 (MIM: 142967), which had several
CpGs related to its expression (lowest p value 2.38 3
10�72, Table S10). In the much smaller study of children
at age four from INMA (n ¼ 107), 35 CpGs were associated
with gene expression (FDR p value < 0.05). The following
six genes had CpGs with methylation that was statistically
significantly related to gene expression in both the Rotter-
dam Study adults and INMA children: ENOSF1 (MIM:
607427), HOXB2 (MIM: 142967, IL32 (MIM: 606001),
NLRP2
(MIM:
609364),
PASK
(MIM:
607505),
and
TDRD9. In both the adult and child datasets, for the major-
ity of CpGs statistically significantly associated with
expression, the direction was inverse (higher methylation,
lower expression). This inverse relationship represented
68% (Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval ¼ 62%–
73%) of the adult associations and 79% (Clopper-Pearson
95% confidence interval ¼ 62%–91%) of the associations
for children.
Newborn DNA Methylation Related to Any Maternal
Smoking during Pregnancy
In addition to the sustained smoking model, we meta-
analyzed the effect of any maternal smoking during preg-
nancy on newborn methylation. As expected, based on
previous literature,12 we found that despite the much
larger number of women with any smoking during preg-
nancy, there were fewer statistically significant findings
for this less specific exposure (4,653 FDR-significant
CpGs, Table S3).
Discussion
We combined data across studies in a large-scale epige-
nome-wide meta-analysis to evaluate the association be-
tween maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNA
methylation in offspring. We established the PACE con-
sortium to study this association and used 13 birth cohort
studies from the US and Europe that, with the same repro-
ducible platform, measured CpG-specific DNA methyl-
ation across the epigenome in newborns. Combining these
studies resulted in the discovery of 6,073 statistically sig-
nificant CpGs; 3,932 remained statistically significant after
adjustment for cell type proportion. Our results are remark-
ably robust to different modeling techniques. Our findings
were very similar when using either the raw methylation
betas or the normalized betas as the outcome. This is
despite the variety of data processing methods used
across the cohorts for normalization and corrections for
technical variables such as batch (described in the Supple-
mental Note). This consistency is reassuring given the
range of published methods available for researchers to
apply to 450K DNA methylation data for quality control,
normalization, and adjustment for technical variation.
Furthermore, our main findings persisted after cell type
adjustment (Table S3, Figure S1).
As predicted based on earlier evaluation of top findings
for maternal smoking in the MoBa cohort,12 we had fewer
statistically significant findings for any smoking during
pregnancy than for sustained smoking during pregnancy
(Figure S5). Nonetheless, with the large sample size of
this meta-analysis, we still observed many statistically sig-
nificant CpGs after FDR correction in the any smoking
models, and the directions of effect and p values were
similar to those from the sustained smoking models
(Table S3, Figure S6). However, the stronger signal for sus-
tained smoking suggests that this might be the more
powerful variable for studying epigenetic effects and
possible health outcomes from this exposure in offspring.
Our observation of a large number of genome-wide sig-
nificant CpGs related to maternal smoking is not surpris-
ing given reports of multiple genome-wide significant
loci identified in single studies, all with smaller sample
sizes.7,8,10,22,37,38 Reassuringly, among our myriad find-
ings, the top hit in all newborn models was AHRR
cg05575921 (p value < 1.64 3 10�193), which has been
observed as differentially methylated in relation to smok-
ing in many studies of adults and children.7,8,10,28,35,53
Our enrichment testing of the genome-wide results is in
line with previous findings showing that island shores, en-
hancers, and DNase I hypersensitive sites are more dy-
namic (susceptible to methylation changes) than promoter
regions54 and imprinted loci.55 These regions might be
more resistant to changes in DNA methylation in response
to in utero exposure.55 Thus, it is not surprising that asso-
ciations between maternal smoking and newborn methyl-
ation might be more likely to be found in island shore and
enhancer regions as opposed to promoters or CpG islands.
To assess the underlying biology involved in the associ-
ated genomic regions, we applied pathway and functional
analyses, as well as tests of enrichment. These results
implicated numerous neurological pathways, pathways
involved in embryogenesis, and various developmental
pathways. These observations could provide insight into
the etiology of childhood health outcomes related to
maternal smoking during pregnancy.
We focus discussion on some specific genes among the
associations that, according to our literature review, had
690

 not been previously reported (2,965 CpGs annotating to
2,017 mapped or nearest genes). For 27 of these genes, mu-
tations or SNPs have been implicated in susceptibility to
orofacial clefts (as identified with the Snipper program
described in the Supplemental Note). This includes the
following genes (each representing one FDR-significant
CpG unless otherwise specified): BHMT2 ([MIM: 605932]
six
CpGs),
GRHL3
(MIM:
608317),
THADA
(MIM:
611800), GAD67 (MIM: 605363), TP63 ([MIM: 603273]
two CpGs), MSX1 (MIM: 142983), WDR1 (MIM: 604734),
SPP1 (MIM: 166490), BMP6 (MIM: 112266), TFAP2A
(MIM: 107580), COL11A2 ([MIM: 120290] three CpGs),
PDGFRA (MIM: 173490), MN1 (MIM: 156100), MSX2
([MIM: 123101] four CpGs), PVT1 (MIM: 165140), ZIC2
(MIM: 603073), HOXA2 ([MIM: 604685] ten CpGs),
WNT3 (MIM: 165330), RUNX2 ([MIM: 600211] two
CpGs), TERT (MIM: 187270), SPATA13 ([MIM: 613324]
two CpGs), VAX1 (MIM: 604294), TIMP2 (MIM: 188825),
NOG
(MIM:
602991),
BEST3
(MIM:
607337),
MYH9
(MIM: 160775), and BMP4 ([MIM: 112262] six CpGs) (re-
sults in Table S5). Although this does not imply that the
smoking-related CpGs are on the causal pathway, we
note that the Surgeon General’s Report summarizes the
evidence as sufficient to infer a causal relationship between
maternal smoking during pregnancy and these birth
defects.2 Many of these genes also have varied biological
effects relevant to other aspects of development.
Among this group of genes previously related to orofa-
cial clefts, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is espe-
cially interesting. Maternal smoking might interact with
SNPs in this gene in relation to oral clefts.56 We identified
six CpGs in BMP4 at genome-wide significance in new-
borns; two remained statistically significant in the older
children. In addition to orofacial clefts, SNPs in BMP4 are
related to tooth development and eruption, as well as to
colorectal cancer in genome-wide association studies
(GWASs).57 BMPs, including BMP4,58 also play an impor-
tant role in lung development: reduced lung function
among infants is an established consequence of maternal
smoking during pregnancy.2 A plot showing greater detail
on the CpGs in or near BMP4 is provided in Figure S7.
We observed six CpGs significantly related to maternal
smoking
in
betaine-homocysteine
methyltransferase
(BHMT2; Figure S8). Genetic variants in this gene have
been associated with orofacial clefts in candidate-gene
studies59 and with selenium levels in GWASs.60,61 Of
note, in experimental studies, selenium has been shown
to protect against orofacial clefts induced by exposure to
teratogens.62 In the Cancer Genome Atlas, methylation
of BHMT2 in lung adenocarcinoma (lung cancer [MIM:
211980]) was strongly correlated (3rd rank genome wide)
with smoking history.63
The gene PRDM8 (PR domain containing 8 [MIM:
616639]) has the largest number of CpGs (18 of 61, based
on Illumina annotation) significantly associated with
maternal smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smoking
during pregnancy was associated with decreased methyl-
ation throughout the gene. PRDM8 is one of several PRDMs
belonging to the SET domain family of histone methyl-
transferases.64 PRDM genes either act as direct histone
methyltransferases or recruit a suite of histone-modifying
enzymes to target promoters.65 PRDM8 specifically meth-
ylates H3K9 of histones to repress transcriptional activ-
ity.66
PRDM8
expression
is
tightly
regulated
in
a
spatiotemporal manner during neural development;67 it
regulates morphological transition in neocortical develop-
ment68 and forms part of a repressor complex that directs,
through regulation of cadherin-11, neural circuit assem-
bly.69 Thus PRDM8 appears to play an important role in
neurologic development.
DLGAP2 (discs large homolog-associated
protein 2
[MIM: 605438]) is another gene with a large number of sig-
nificant CpGs (14 of 192 tested) associated with maternal
smoking in our study. DLGAP2, also known as SAPAP2, be-
longs to a gene family that encodes SAP90/PSD95-associ-
ated proteins (SAPAPs), and is known to be involved in
the molecular organization of synapses and in neuronal
cell signaling.70 DLGAP2 was first identified in studies
of progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR
[MIM: 610003])71 and has been associated with other
CNS
disorders
such
as
schizophrenia
(SCZD
[MIM:
181500])72 and autism spectrum disorders (ASD [MIM:
209850]).73,74 Differential methylation at this locus in a
rat model appears to play a role in the development of
post-traumatic stress disorder.75
The neuropilin-2 (NRP2 [MIM: 602070]) gene had three
CpGs located in close proximity (among 48 tested) that
were statistically significantly associated with maternal
smoking during pregnancy. NRP2 is one of two transmem-
brane receptors for axonal guidance cues of the class 3 sem-
aphorin (SEMA) family and is expressed in sympathetic
neural crest cells and their progeny.76 It might also be
required in vivo for sorting migrating cortical and striatal
interneurons to their correct destination.77 NRP2 also
functions as a receptor for some forms of vascular endothe-
lial growth factor, thereby playing a crucial role in angio-
genesis
and
lymphangiogenesis.78
Polymorphisms
in
NRP2 have been associated with several diseases, including
autism77 and multiple cancers.79–83
Hypermethylation of ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1 [MIM:
133430], a key nuclear transcription factor) on chromo-
some 6q25.1 is well-studied in relation to presence and
prognosis of various malignancies such as breast cancer
and hepatocellular carcinoma,84,85 as well as asthma.86,87
We found an inverse association between maternal smok-
ing and methylation levels for seven out of the eight
FDR-significant ESR1 CpGs. ESR1 hypomethylation has
been reported in relation to induced microRNA expression
(synthetic miR-29b oligonucleotides) in acute myeloid leu-
kemia cells.88
To evaluate possible functional gene expression effects
of methylation at the CpGs that we found to be signifi-
cantly related to maternal smoking, we analyzed data
from two studies—one of adults and another of children
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 680–696, April 7, 2016
691
 at age four years. Although on first pass, one might expect
a higher proportion of the CpGs related to maternal smok-
ing to also be related to gene expression, there are several
factors that decrease the likelihood of seeing significant as-
sociations. Most importantly, the sample size for discovery
of the methylation association with smoking was much
larger than that of the datasets available to correlate gene
expression and methylation (about 10-fold smaller for
the adult gene expression dataset and about 60-fold
smaller for the childhood dataset). In addition, gene
expression in blood might be more transient than methyl-
ation, decreasing the ability to find significant associations
with a single gene-expression measurement. Furthermore,
constitutive gene expression is measured in this setting,
whereas many genes are inducible and methylation might
contribute to this process. Lastly, some in-utero-induced
changes to methylation could have affected transcription
during fetal development but not in postnatal life, and
might have transcription-independent functional mecha-
nisms. Nonetheless, we observed significant associations
between methylation and gene expression at six genes in
both the adults and the children. The majority of CpGs
significantly associated with expression were in the
commonly expected direction of methylation related to
gene silencing. Notably, CpGs in IL32 (Figure S9), a proin-
flammatory cytokine involved in several diseases such as
asthma89 and cancer,90 HOXB2, a transcription factor
involved in development91 and several cancer forms,92
and PASK (PAS domain containing serine/threonine ki-
nase), involved in glucose homeostasis,93 were signifi-
cantly associated with expression in both datasets.
We analyzed the associations of CpGs with expression
levels of genes within a region of 250 kb up- or down-
stream of the CpG. Consensus on the optimal physical dis-
tance for these analyses is lacking. However, in a recent
study, associations between CpGs and SNPs were the stron-
gest when within close proximity (500 kb) of the CpG.48
Despite the limitations with the expression datasets
included in our study, we believe that the transcriptomics
data provide functional support for our maternal smoking
findings.
In older children, all of the CpGs significantly associated
with maternal smoking in newborns gave at least nominal
levels of significance (p value < 0.05). This skew of the dis-
tribution of p values toward small values was much more
than expected by chance (Kolmogorov p value < 2.2 3
10�16), demonstrating a very high level of replication
and persistence of findings at birth into later childhood.
This is consistent with and substantially extends a few pre-
vious reports.9,12 We had only very limited data with
repeat measures in the same individuals so we could not
meta-analyze change in methylation over time.
This inaugural paper from the PACE consortium repre-
sents a major effort to combine data from many studies
in a large-scale meta-analysis of epigenome-wide associa-
tion studies of maternal smoking in relation to methyl-
ation in newborns. We report at least an order of
magnitude
more
genes
differentially
methylated
in
response to maternal smoking than have been identified
in any previous study. This suggests that meta-analysis in
epigenome-wide association studies produces similar suc-
cess to that of genome-wide association SNP studies in
the identification of biologically meaningful loci. The sim-
ilarity in the results obtained when using the raw betas
compared to those obtained when using normalized betas
generated with various methods indicates that cohort-spe-
cific processing methods do not interfere with the ability
to perform meta-analysis.
We identified nearly 3,000 CpGs corresponding to genes
differentially
methylated
in
offspring
in
relation
to
whether their mothers smoked during pregnancy. Some
of these genes have been implicated in genetic studies of
orofacial clefts or asthma, both conditions related to
maternal smoking in pregnancy, and others in the patho-
genesis of cancers that are associated with adult smoking,
including lung, colorectal (CRC [MIM: 114500]), and liver
(HCC [MIM: 114550]).2 We also find substantial persis-
tence of effects of maternal smoking identified in new-
borns into later childhood. Our findings might implicate
epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of these exposure-
disease relationships. This large-scale study also provides
confirmation of previously reported loci, many of which
have not been previously replicated. Pathway analysis
highlights the involvement of identified genes in various
developmental pathways, and functional effects at the
transcriptomics level were observed for many of the iden-
tified CpGs. These findings could provide new insights
into the mechanisms involved in the detrimental health
outcomes that arise from this important in utero exposure.
