Influence of a New Diabetes Diagnosis on the Health 
Behaviors of the Patient’s Partner
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE When a person is given a diagnosis of diabetes, the changes in his or 
her health behaviors may influence the behaviors of his or her partner. The dia-
betes diagnosis may affect household members’ perceptions of their own health 
risks, which could trigger behavioral change. The purpose of this study was to 
assess whether partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes changed their 
health behaviors compared with partners of persons without diabetes.
METHODS The study population consisted of Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali-
fornia health plan members from 2007 to 2011. This cohort study assessed differ-
ences in change of 8 health behaviors. The study compared coresiding partners of 
persons with newly diagnosed diabetes before and after a diabetes diagnosis with 
a 5 to 1 matched sample of coresiding partners of persons without diabetes.
RESULTS A total of 180,910 couples were included in the analysis. After adjusting 
for baseline characteristics, partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes 
had significantly higher rates of participation in weight management–related 
health education classes (risk ratio [RR] 
= 
1.50; 95% CI, 1.39-1.63); smoking 
cessation medication use (RR 
= 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50); glucose screening 
(RR 
= 
1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08); clinically meaningful weight loss (RR 
= 
1.06; 95% 
CI, 1.02-1.11); lipid screening (RR 
= 
1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07); influenza vaccination 
(RR 
= 
1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04); and blood pressure screening (RR 
= 
1.02; 95% CI, 
1.02-1.03) compared with partners of persons without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS There were small but significant differences in health-related 
behavioral changes among partners of persons with newly diagnosed diabetes 
compared with partners of persons without diabetes, even when no intervention 
occurred. This finding suggests a diabetes diagnosis within a family may be a 
teachable moment to improve health behaviors at the household level.

INTRODUCTION
D
iabetes mellitus is a chronic health condition affecting more than 
29 million people in the United States.1 Diabetes can have a 
profoundly negative impact on quality of life and patient clinical 
outcomes, such as the heightened risk of microvascular and macrovascular 
complications, and is costly to individual persons, their families, and soci-
ety at large.2-7 Optimal management of diabetes requires a complex and 
demanding behavioral management regimen involving the monitoring of 
symptoms and blood glucose levels, adherence to medications, efforts at 
smoking cessation when necessary, and often major changes in diet and 
physical activity level.8,9 Because much of this care management takes 
place outside the health care setting, families are often directly involved 
in the care of persons with diabetes.10 Providing this care and serving as a 
key component of a patient’s social support network11 can put a consider-
able strain on family members.12
Spouses and partners of persons with diabetes may have an elevated 
risk of developing the disease themselves.13 This risk may be due to shared 
health behaviors, such as dietary habits,14 and exercise patterns.15 In the

United States, when a new case of diabetes is diagnosed, 
it is recommended that clinicians and diabetes educators 
work with patients to lower their risk of future com-
plications from the disease by helping them establish 
strong nutritional, exercise, and prevention habits.8 
Previous studies have shown that lifestyle inter-
ventions may reduce diabetes risk16,17; however, it is 
unclear whether exposure to guidance and education 
regarding healthy behaviors geared toward patients 
with diabetes may also result in behavior changes in 
persons living with that patient. Although a survey 
of patients in a community-based diabetes interven-
tion suggests that family members of a person with 
diabetes do have a higher level of diabetes-related 
knowledge,18 it is not known whether such knowledge 
results in behavioral change. Whether the health 
behaviors and health-screening behaviors of cohab-
iting spouses and partners of those with diabetes 
change when a diagnosis of diabetes is made within 
the household is unknown. The purpose of this study 
was to examine whether healthy behaviors and out-
comes changed among coresiding partners of per-
sons with diabetes in the year after the new diabetes 
diagnosis, compared with partners of persons without 
diabetes. The research hypothesis was that partners of 
those with newly diagnosed diabetes would increase 
their own health-seeking and monitoring behaviors.
METHODS
The study setting, data sources, and population have 
been described in detail elsewhere.19 Briefly, demo-
graphic and clinical data were obtained from the 
administrative and electronic health records (EHRs) 
of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). 
KPNC is an integrated health care delivery system 
with a diverse population of more than 4 million 
insured individuals who are broadly similar to Califor-
nia’s overall population. Census data from 2010 were 
merged with members’ census block of residence to 
estimate neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics.
The study population consisted of coresiding cou-
ples in which both partners were KPNC members who 
shared a health plan; couples were selected using core-
siding status and shared health plan status determined 
from plan enrollment records. Couples in which 1 
partner developed diabetes from 2007 to 2011 and the 
other partner did not have diabetes at that time were 
included in the analysis. Diabetes status was defined 
using the KPNC diabetes registry, a well-validated 
database of diabetes cases in KPNC. Persons were 
entered in the registry if they met 1 or more of the 
following criteria based on EHR data: 1 inpatient diag-
nosis of diabetes, 2 outpatient diagnoses of diabetes, 2 
glucose test results in the diabetes range, or 1 prescrip-
tion of a medication for diabetes. The earliest date of 
meeting the criteria was the diabetes diagnosis date.
The diabetes diagnosis date for the first partner was 
used as the index date for the couple. To comprise a 
similar comparison group, propensity score matching 
was performed to select 5 matched couples without 
a diabetes diagnosis for each couple with a diabetes 
diagnosis. Propensity scores were calculated using a 
logistic regression model and used to match newly 
diagnosed individuals with 5 individuals without dia-
betes for age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index 
(BMI), geocoded neighborhood education and annual 
income, KPNC service area, and number of primary 
care visits in the previous year. The index date for the 
comparison group was January 1 of the year of their 
match’s diabetes diagnosis. Couples were excluded if 
either member was outside the ages of 18 to 89 years 
range or did not have KPNC coverage throughout the 
year before and the year after the index date (allowing 
for a 1-month gap per year).
Outcomes
The research hypothesis was that after their spouse’s 
newly diagnosed diabetes, the partners would increase 
health-seeking behaviors, including both healthy life-
style changes and health-monitoring and -testing behav-
iors. Health-seeking behaviors and health outcomes in 
the partner in the year before and after the index date 
were therefore examined as part of our prespecified 
analysis plan. Behaviors examined were fasting plasma 
glucose or glycated hemoglobin (A1c) testing, lipid level 
testing, blood pressure testing, an influenza vaccination, 
use of a smoking cessation medication, tobacco-use 
status, whether they had participated in a weight-related 
health education class within the KPNC system, and 
whether the partners had meaningful weight loss after 
the index date defined as at least 5% of baseline weight 
in pounds.20 All outcome variables were extracted from 
EHR data on laboratory use, outpatient visits, vaccina-
tion records, health plan–sponsored wellness class par-
ticipation, and pharmacy dispensing. Outcomes were 
dichotomized as binary variables for analysis.
Statistical Analysis
To compare the partners’ health behaviors, the occur-
rence of the health-seeking behaviors and their out-
comes in the follow-up period were modeled using 8 
separate, adjusted, modified Poisson regression models 
to generate risk ratios, 1 for each outcome described 
above. The models were adjusted by sex, race or eth-
nicity, geocoded education and income level, baseline 
BMI category,21 number of primary care visits in the 
baseline year, and an indicator for presence of the

health behavior or outcome in the baseline year; miss-
ing data were included as a separate category in the 
analyses. Subgroup sensitivity analyses stratifying the 
above models by sex, race or ethnicity, and overweight 
and obesity at baseline (BMI of 25 or greater, and 
30 kg/m2, respectively) were also performed.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 
v9.3 software (SAS Institute). Analysis was conducted 
from 2014 to 2016. The institutional review boards 
of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Emory 
University approved this study.
RESULTS
Included in the study were 30,155 couples in which 1 
partner had newly diagnosed diabetes from 2007 to 
2011 and 150,755 couples with no diabetes (Table 1). In 
2011, there were 236,538 patients in the diabetes reg-

istry overall (data not shown). The partners of persons 
with diabetes selected for this study had a mean age of 
54.3 years (SD = 12.0 years), and a mean BMI of 29.4 
kg/m2; 62.8% were female, and less than 50% were 
white. The control group of partners of persons with-
out diabetes had a mean age of 53.2 years (SD = 13.4 
years) and a mean BMI of 27.8; 65.4% were female, and 
53.2% were white.
Figure 1 displays the adjusted risk ratios and 
95% confidence intervals for exhibiting each health 
behavior and achieving weight loss in the follow-up 
period for partners of persons with newly diagnosed 
diabetes compared with their matched comparisons, 
adjusting for any differences between the 2 groups in 
baseline levels (also included as an indicator for the 
health behavior or outcome in the baseline year), BMI, 
number of primary care visits, sex, race or ethnicity, 
and geocoded education level. Partners of persons 
with newly diagnosed diabetes were significantly more 
likely to participate in weight management–related 
health education classes (risk ratio [RR] = 1.50; 95% CI, 
1.39-1.63) and to use smoking cessation medications 
(RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50). They were also more 
likely to receive glucose testing (RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 
1.05-1.50), achieve meaningful weight loss of at least 
5% (RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11), and receive lipid 
screening (RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07), an influenza 
vaccination (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), and blood 
pressure screening (RR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03) com-
pared with partners of persons without diabetes. Sensi-
tivity analyses stratifying by sex, race or ethnicity, and 
baseline weight showed similar results across categories 
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
When a patient has diabetes newly diagnosed, the edu-
cation and counseling they receive regarding healthy 
lifestyles, behavioral change, and prevention may affect 
the knowledge and behavior of other members of the 
household who are exposed to this information about 
diabetes risk.18 This study found that among a diverse 
cohort of coresiding partners of persons with newly 
diagnosed diabetes, these partners were more likely to 
exhibit health and health-monitoring behavior changes 
compared with partners of persons without the disease 
after adjusting for differences in demographic and 
clinical characteristics. Although transient lifestyle 
changes and screening behaviors may not reduce dia-
betes risk, an increase in both types of behaviors may

attest to a greater attention to health status among 
partners of persons with diabetes.
Clinical and education interventions for diabetes 
and related conditions, such as obesity and cardiovas-
cular disease, are traditionally focused primarily on 
the patient with a newly diagnosed case of diabetes.22 
There is increasing recognition, however, that persons 
with diabetes benefit when family members are also 
involved in the lifestyle and disease management edu-
cation. For example, spousal support has been shown 
to be linked to greater physical activity among type 
2 diabetic patients,23 and family support is associated 
with greater achievement of weight loss goals.24,25
Despite evidence that health behaviors and lifestyle 
choices tend to cluster within households,13-15 very few 
behavioral and clinical interventions focus on chang-
ing behaviors among members of the diabetes patient’s 
family, even though family members have been shown 
to also be at elevated risk of developing diabetes them-
selves.26-29 This study found that even in the absence 
of any lifestyle intervention geared toward family 
members, partners of persons with newly diagnosed 
diabetes exhibited small but significantly higher levels 
of behavioral changes compared with a similar set of 
matched control partners of persons without diabetes 
in the household. This finding suggests that a diabetes 
diagnosis may introduce a teachable moment for family 
members. Together, the diagnosis offers an opportu-
nity to both reduce the risk of complications for the 
patient and potentially delay or prevent the develop-
ment of diabetes in their partners. Future research 
should focus on developing and disseminating effective 
interventions designed to reduce health risk within 
families and social networks, as opposed to strictly 
within individuals.
This study has limitations that should be noted. 
Propensity score matching is unable to control for 
unmeasured confounders. Despite the similarities in 
the partners of persons with and without newly diag-
nosed diabetes, and that these analyses adjusted for 
any measured differences between the partners of the 
2 groups, and it is possible that there are differences 
in motivation or activation that could not be measured 
or controlled for in the analyses. It was not possible to 
measure health behaviors important to reducing diabe-
tes risk, such as physical activity levels or nutritional 
or caloric intake. Even so, the study takes advantage of 
clinical, measured EHR data for a wide range of behav-
iors and outcomes that do not rely on self-report. Our 
study included partners only when both were members 
of KPNC; diabetic patients whose partners received 
health care from another source might exhibit differ-
ent outcomes. Significant results in large observational 
studies such as this may not always be considered 
clinically important, which interventions targeting 
these behaviors should consider in their design. Finally, 
the results came from a single health delivery system 
serving persons in Northern California, which may 
limit their generalizability to persons in other types of 
insurance, clinical, and geographic environments.
This study showed that the partners of persons 
with diabetes make positive changes in health care–
seeking and health behaviors compared with partners 
of persons without diabetes. Future research should 
fharness this teachable moment and identify interven-
tions that can effectively reduce overall health risks in 
both partners.
