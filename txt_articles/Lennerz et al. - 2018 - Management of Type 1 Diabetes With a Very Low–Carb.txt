OBJECTIVES: To evaluate glycemic control among children and adults with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) who consume a very low–carbohydrate diet (VLCD).
METHODS: We conducted an online survey of an international social media group for people 
with T1DM who follow a VLCD. Respondents included adults and parents of children with 
T1DM. We assessed current hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (primary measure), change in HbA1c 
after the self-reported beginning of the VLCD, total daily insulin dose, and adverse events. 
We obtained confirmatory data from diabetes care providers and medical records.
RESULTS: Of 316 respondents, 131 (42%) were parents of children with T1DM, and 57% were 
of female sex. Suggestive evidence of T1DM (based on a 3-tier scoring system in which 
researchers took into consideration age and weight at diagnosis, pancreatic autoimmunity, 
insulin requirement, and clinical presentation) was obtained for 273 (86%) respondents. 
The mean age at diagnosis was 16 ± 14 years, the duration of diabetes was 11 ± 13 
years, and the time following a VLCD was 2.2 ± 3.9 years. Participants had a mean daily 
carbohydrate intake of 36 ± 15 g. Reported mean HbA1c was 5.67% ± 0.66%. Only 7 (2%) 
respondents reported diabetes-related hospitalizations in the past year, including 4 (1%) 
for ketoacidosis and 2 (1%) for hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Exceptional glycemic control of T1DM with low rates of adverse events was 
reported by a community of children and adults who consume a VLCD. The generalizability 
of these findings requires further studies, including high-quality randomized controlled 
trials.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Despite 
pharmacological and technological advances, 
optimal glycemic control of type 1 diabetes remains 
elusive, putting millions of people worldwide 
at increased risk of micro- and macrovascular 
complications. One conceptually promising but 
poorly studied approach is dietary carbohydrate 
restriction.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Exceptional glycemic 
control of type 1 diabetes without high rates of 
acute complications may be achievable among 
children and adults with a very low–carbohydrate 
diet. However, the generalizability of these findings 
and long-term safety of carbohydrate restriction 
remain unknown.

 Before the discovery of insulin, the 
lives of children with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) were extended, 
sometimes for years, by severe 
carbohydrate restriction.1 After 
the advent of insulin treatment, the 
recommended carbohydrate intake 
was increased without clinical trial 
proof of superiority. By the 1980s, 
a low-fat diet containing up to 
60% of energy from carbohydrates 
became the standard of care.2 More 
recently, the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) has emphasized 
the individualization of diet rather 
than focusing on macronutrients.3
Despite major medical and 
technological advances, the 
management of T1DM remains 
suboptimal. With an average overall 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.2%, 
only 20% of children and 30% of 
adults achieve the glycemic targets 
of HbA1c <7% for adults and <7.5% 
for children as set forth by the ADA 
to reduce long-term complications.4 
The greatest challenge in this regard 
involves difficulty controlling 
postprandial glycemia, which is a 
major determinant of HbA1c.5 Even 
with modern insulin analogs and 
technical advances, a mismatch 
between carbohydrate absorption 
and insulin action typically exists 
after meals. Beyond a point, measures 
to lower postprandial hyperglycemia 
inevitably increase risk for 
hypoglycemia, with potentially life-
threatening consequences.6 
– 
9
The source and amount of 
carbohydrates consumed affect 
postprandial hyperglycemia and 
glycemic variability more than any 
other dietary factor, 
3, 
 
10 
– 
12 providing 
a conceptual basis for interest in 
carbohydrate-modified diets for 
T1DM. Regarding carbohydrate 
source, a diet with a low versus high 
glycemic index can be used to reduce 
HbA1c moderately (by ∼0.5%).13 
Case series and pilot studies reveal 
more substantial improvements 
in HbA1c and other benefits 
(less hypoglycemia and reduced 
glycemic variability) with a very 
low–carbohydrate diet (VLCD).14 
– 
21 
Although varying to some degree 
among studies, a VLCD is typically 
defined as ≤20 to 50 g per day of 
carbohydrates or ≤5% to 10% 
carbohydrates as a proportion of 
calories.22– 
24 In T1DM, small sample 
sizes and methodological issues limit 
the significance of VLCD benefits, 
and little is known about prevalence, 
practice, and sustainability. In 
the absence of larger studies in 
pragmatic settings, a VLCD is 
generally discouraged out of concern 
for potential diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA), hypoglycemia, dyslipidemia, 
nutrient deficiency, growth failure in 
children, and sustainability.25, 
 
26 Our 
aim in this study was to characterize 
glycemic control and acute adverse 
events among children and adults 
who have adopted this approach for 
the long-term self-management of 
T1DM.
METHODS
Design
Using an online survey, we collected 
primary data from respondents and 
confirmatory medical information 
from a secondary survey of health 
care providers or a review of 
medical records. Our goals were to 
(1) establish that adult respondents 
and children for whom an adult 
respondent completed the survey 
(both henceforth referred to as 
participants) were formally and 
accurately diagnosed with T1DM, 
(2) characterize glycemic control 
(ie, HbA1c, total daily insulin dose, 
average blood glucose concentrations 
and SD as measured by a continuous 
glucose monitor [CGM] or glucose 
meter), (3) determine adverse 
event rates (eg, DKA, hypoglycemia, 
diabetes-related hospitalizations and 
emergency department visits), (4) 
assess anthropometrics (eg, weight, 
height, and BMI) and metabolic 
health parameters (eg, serum lipids), 
(5) compare longitudinal changes in 
glycemic control (pre- to post-VLCD), 
and (6) characterize participants’ 
satisfaction with their diabetes 
management and relationship 
with the health care system. The 
study was approved by the Boston 
Children’s Hospital Institutional 
Review Board and is registered at 
www. 
clinicaltrials. 
gov (identifier 
NCT02839174). Electronic consent 
was obtained from the respondents.
Participants and Enrollment
A volunteer sample was recruited 
from TypeOneGrit, an online 
Facebook community for people  
with T1DM who follow a VLCD  
and diabetes management method  
as recommended in the book  
Dr Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution.20, 
 
27  
This method comprises a VLCD 
with weight-based carbohydrate 
prescription of up to 30 g per day 
derived from fibrous vegetables and 
nuts with a low glycemic index. High-
protein foods with associated fat are 
substituted for carbohydrates and 
adjusted on the basis of outcomes, 
including glycemic control and 
weight. Participants adhere to a 
structured meal plan and adjust 
bolus insulin empirically according to 
postprandial glycemia. Basal insulin 
is adjusted according to fasting 
glycemia. The group was established 
in April 2014, with ∼1900 members 
at the time of the survey.
We used an eligibility survey of 
community members between 
September 2016 and November 
2016. Members aged ≥18 years were 
eligible if they or a child in their 
care satisfied these 3 self-reported 
criteria: having T1DM, receiving 
insulin therapy, and consuming a 
carbohydrate-restricted diet for at 
least 3 months. Women who were 
pregnant or breastfeeding were 
excluded. Of 493 eligibility survey 
responses, 414 (84%) individuals 
were eligible to participate and 
316 (76%) provided sufficient 
information to be included in the 
study (Fig 1). With respondent

 permission, we contacted 182 
providers; 97 (53%) completed the 
full or short provider survey. Of 238 
participants who agreed to provide 
medical records, 101 records were 
received. Primary data acquisition 
continued until January 2017. 
Confirmatory medical information 
was collected until March 2017.
Data Collection and Categorization
When possible, survey questions 
were modified from the T1D

and covered several domains: (1) 
diabetes diagnosis and treatment, (2) 
diet, (3) insulin regimen, (4) other 
diabetes-related care, (5) glycemic 
control, (6) diabetes complications, 
(7) general health and health care, 
(8) interactions between the patient 
and the diabetes care provider, and 
(9) sociodemographic data. Survey 
instruments are avalable at https://

d6wrj/ 
. Respondents were 
asked to provide consent so that 
their or their children’s primary 
diabetes care providers could be 
contacted or to provide confirmatory 
medical records themselves. Data 
were collected and managed by using 
research electronic data capture 
(version 7.3.5; Vanderbilt University, 
Nashville, TN) tools hosted at Boston 
Children’s Hospital.29
Ascertainment of T1DM Diagnosis
We created a 3-tiered scoring 
system to ascertain T1DM diagnosis 
with varying levels of confidence 
using participant-reported and 
confirmatory medical information. 
Participants were classified as having 
diagnostic evidence of T1DM if they 
had a diabetes diagnosis at age 
<20 years, a nonobese body weight 
(BMI <30 in adults or BMI standard 
deviation score [SDS] <1.645 [∼95th 
percentile] in children), and positive 
diabetes antibody test results. A 
classification of strong evidence 
was assigned to participants with 
a diabetes diagnosis at age <10 
years; a diagnosis between ages ≥10 
and <20 years, immediate insulin 
requirement, and a nonobese body 
weight; or a diagnosis between 
ages ≥20 and <40 years, immediate 
insulin requirement, positive 
diabetes antibody test results, 
and a nonobese body weight. A 
classification of suggestive evidence 
was assigned to participants with a 
diagnosis at ages ≥20 and <40 years, 
immediate insulin requirement, 
a nonobese body weight, and 
1 additional factor (including 
low C-peptide level at diagnosis, 
physician-specified diagnosis of 
T1DM, or other evidence [abrupt 
onset with consistent symptoms, 
history of DKA, or negative genetic 
test results for maturity onset 
diabetes of the young (MODY)]); 
or diagnosis at age >40 years, 
immediate insulin requirement, a 
nonobese body weight, and positive 
diabetes antibody test results or 1 
of the aforementioned additional 
factors.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed by using 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC). Statistical significance 
was defined as P < .01, which is 
a conservative threshold chosen 
to take into account multiple 
secondary outcomes. Exact P values 
are reported. To assess agreement 
among data sources, we performed 
Lin’s concordance correlation 
between patient-provider pairs 
of each clinical measurement. The 
following statistical comparisons 
were made according to an a

 priori analysis plan. Comparisons 
between participants were made by 
independent sample t test or χ2 test 
for participants with versus without 
confirmatory medical information 
and adults versus children. A within-
subject, paired, 2-tailed t test was 
used for pre- and postdiet data and 
height SDS comparison. Multiple 
comparisons for diagnostic evidence 
groups were made by analysis of 
variance. We performed a linear 
regression of current, self-reported 
HbA1c on age, years with diabetes, 
years on VLCD, carbohydrate intake 
goal, educational status, and income 
class.
Post hoc analyses were performed 
with Pearson’s correlation 
between pediatric height SDS and 
carbohydrate intake and by Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test and McNemar’s 
test to compare participant- and 
provider-satisfaction data.
RESULTS
Participants
Descriptive characteristics are listed in 
 
Table 1. Most participants were from 
the United States, Canada, Europe, 
or Australia; 57% were of female 
sex, 42% were children, 88% were 
white and non-Hispanic, and 84% of 
all respondents (adults or parents 
of children with T1DM) completed 
college or the equivalent. The mean 
age at diabetes diagnosis was 16 ± 14 
years, the duration of diabetes was  
11 ± 13 years, and the time following  
a VLCD was 2.2 ± 3.9 years.
Validation of Participant-Reported 
Data
Confirmatory medical information 
(from providers and/or medical 
records) was available for 148 (47%) 
participants (Fig 1, Supplemental 
Table 4). Participant- and 
provider-reported data revealed 
good agreement for relevant 
clinical variables. Participants 
with and without confirmatory 
medical information did not differ 
(Supplemental Table 5). Therefore, 
only participant-reported 
information is reported below.
Ascertainment of T1DM
At least suggestive evidence for 
T1DM was reported by participants 
or providers in 273 (86%) patients, 
at least strong evidence was reported 
in 238 (75%) patients, and diagnostic 
evidence was reported in 85 (27%) 
patients. Evidence was unavailable 
for 36 (10%) patients, and 7 (2%) 
did not meet criteria only because 
of obesity (Table 1). Apart from 
expected differences related to 
the scoring system (eg, age, age at 
diagnosis, and obesity), participants 
with and without supportive 
evidence of T1DM did not differ

data for all participants regardless 
of evidence category are presented 
together.
Clinical Outcomes
Participants reported a mean daily 
carbohydrate intake of 36 ± 15 g  
(n = 223). The mean participant-
reported current HbA1c was 5.67% ±  
0.66% among the 300 participants 
who provided this information in 
the acceptable time frame (Table 
2, Fig 2), and 97% of participants 
achieved the ADA glycemic targets. 
The participant-reported change in 
HbA1c from pre- to post-VLCD was 
−1.45% ± 1.04% (n = 127; P < .001). 
Of the 137 respondents who reported 
CGM mean blood glucose values and 
the 115 who reported CGM blood 
glucose SD, average blood glucose was 
104 ± 16 mg/dL and SD was 28 ± 12 
mg/dL. In the regression analysis, a 
priori covariates explained little of 
the variation in HbA1c (r2 = 0.06). 
Carbohydrate intake goal was the 
only significant predictor (F = 10.4; 
P = .001), with an increase in HbA1c 
of 0.1% per 10 g of carbohydrate 
consumed (Supplemental Table 9). 
The mean daily insulin dose was  
0.40 ± 0.19 U/kg per day.
Participant-reported rates of 
adverse events were low, and many 
declined after the initiation of a 
VLCD (Supplemental Table 7). Of 
300 participants, 7 (2%) reported 
hospitalizations in the past 12 
months (14 separate occurrences; 
0.05 hospitalizations per person per 
year), 4 (1%) had 4 (0.01 per person 
per year) hospitalizations for DKA, 
and 6 (2%) had 9 hospitalizations 
(0.03 per person per year) for other 
reasons. Symptomatic hypoglycemia 
within the past month was reported 
by 205 (69%) participants, with 
the majority (112; 55%) having few 
(1–5) episodes per month. Likewise, 
rates of severe hypoglycemia 
were low, with 7 (2%) reporting 
hypoglycemia with seizure or coma 
and 11 (4%) requiring glucagon in 
the past year. Conventional chronic 
disease risk factors revealed a mixed 
profile, with low triglycerides (TG) 
and elevated high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDLc) but high total and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDLc) (Table 2).
Pediatric Age Group and Growth
Children, compared with adults, 
had similar participant-reported 
HbA1c and other clinical 
parameters (Supplemental Table 8).

 Participant- and provider-reported 
height SDSs were 0.26 ± 1.21 (n = 
107; 82% of children) and 0.25 ± 
1.00 (n = 49; 37%), respectively. 
There was no correlation of height 
SDS with carbohydrate intake goal  
(r = 0.15; P = .20) or diet duration  
(r = 0.14; P = .16). Provider-reported, 
current height SDS compared with 
height SDS at diagnosis was 0.20 ± 
1.02 vs 0.41 ± 1.27 (P = .05) among 
the small subset of children for whom 
data were available (n = 34; 26%). 
Of the interval of 2.3 ± 2.0 years 
since diagnosis, these children had 
followed a VLCD for 1.2 ± 0.8 years.
Health and Health Care Satisfaction
Participants reported high levels of 
overall health and satisfaction with 
diabetes management but not with 
their professional diabetes care 
(Table 3), and 27% did not discuss 
their adherence to a VLCD with their 
diabetes care providers. Of those 
who did discuss their diet, only 
49% agreed or strongly agreed that 
their diabetes care providers were 
supportive. Narrative explanations 
by participants for not discussing 
their diet included disagreement 
on treatment goals and approach, 
perceived provider disinterest or 
unfamiliarity with a VLCD, a desire 
to avoid conflicts with the provider, 
and (for parents) fear of being 
accused of child abuse. Participating 
providers corroborated the overall 
health ratings and reported even 
greater satisfaction with diabetes 
control compared with participants 
(Z −4.09; P < .001). The therapeutic 
relationship was perceived as very 
good or excellent by 82% of providers. 
Interestingly, providers perceived 
themselves as more supportive of 
the VLCD compared with participant 
perception (Z −2.69; P .007).
DISCUSSION
In this survey of children and adults 
who follow a VLCD for the long-term 
treatment of T1DM, we observed 
measures of glycemic control in 
the near-normal range, low rates 
of hypoglycemia and other adverse 
events, and generally high levels of 
satisfaction with health and diabetes 
control. These findings are without 
precedent among people with T1DM, 
revealing a novel approach to the 
prevention of long-term diabetes 
complications.
Researchers in the Diabetes Control 
and Complications Trial achieved 
an average HbA1c of 7.2% in the 
intensively treated group but with 
increased rates of hypoglycemia.6, 
 
7, 
 
30 
In a recent survey of 3 international 
pediatric registries, an HbA1c 
<7% was not associated with 
higher rates of hypoglycemia.31

 Nevertheless, targeting a near-
normal HbA1c is generally not 
recommended because of concern 
for hypoglycemia. The participants 
in our survey had an average  
HbA1c in the normal range and low 
rates of hypoglycemia compared 
with those in other surveys.32, 
 
33  
Likewise, hospitalizations for 
DKA or all diabetes-related causes 
compared favorably with prevailing 
rates.32 
– 
34
The effect of a VLCD on 
cardiovascular disease risk has 
been subject to debate. Consistent 
with the known effects of low 
carbohydrate and (presumed) 
associated higher saturated fat 
intakes, participants had low TG 
and high HDLc and LDLc levels. 
The remarkably low ratio of TG to 
HDLc of 1:1, together with the low 
total daily insulin requirement, 
indicate high insulin sensitivity and 
good cardiometabolic health.35 In 
contrast, total LDLc is considered 
a conventional cardiovascular 
risk factor. However, total LDLc 
elevation on a VLCD (associated 
with low TG) may reflect large, 
buoyant lipoprotein particles, 
which is a relatively low-risk 
subtype.36 Furthermore, in the 
Diabetes Control and Complications 
Trial cohort of 1441 adolescents 
and young adults, HbA1c had the 
largest effects on cardiovascular 
risk, followed by TG and LDLc.37 
Postprandial hyperglycemia has 
been proposed as an independent 
cardiovascular disease risk factor38 
for which a VLCD would plausibly 
provide benefit. Another major 
cardiovascular risk factor, BMI, 
was significantly below population 
averages for study participants, 
possibly reflecting another benefit 
of a VLCD.39
Children generally did as well 
as adults, which is a promising 
finding in view of the adverse 
effects of diabetes-related hyper- 
and hypoglycemia on brain 
development40, 
 
41 and growth.42 
– 
46 
The commonly reported growth 
deceleration in T1DM is generally 
ascribed to poor glycemic 
control.42 
– 
46 Concerns have also 
been raised that a VLCD or chronic 
ketosis may adversely affect growth 
and pubertal development.25 
Although pubertal development 
was not assessed in this survey, 
we obtained children’s height 
data from parents and medical 
providers. Participant-reported, 
current mean height was modestly 
above average for age and sex (SDS 
0.26). Provider-reported data were 
used to corroborate this finding and 
also revealed a marginal decrease in 
height SDS since diabetes diagnosis. 
This possible growth deceleration 
may have preceded or occurred 
during the diet and is comparable 
in magnitude to the previously 
described decreases in height SDS 
in T1DM. Taken together, these data 
do not reveal an adverse effect of 
a VLCD on growth, but additional 
research into this possibility is 
warranted.
Although participants reported high 
levels of satisfaction with health and 
diabetes control, relationships with 
diabetes care providers were often 
fraught. A minority of participants 
did not disclose their adherence 
to a VLCD to their providers, citing 
concerns for being criticized, 
pressured to change behavior, 
or accused of child abuse. This 
distrust may increase the risk for a 
catastrophic adverse event if patients 
feel unable to seek medical support 
at times of need (eg, impending 
DKA) and instead make diabetes 
management decisions beyond 
their competencies. Notably, most 
providers described the therapeutic 
relationship as very good or excellent 
and perceived themselves as more 
supportive of a VLCD than how they 
were described by the participants. 
This discrepancy warrants follow-up 
in qualitative research.
Strengths of this study include 
verification of self-reported 
information by independent 
sources (diabetes care providers 
and medical records), a rigorous 
approach to establish T1DM 
diagnosis, and the pragmatic 
setting. Our study has 3 main 
limitations. First, we cannot 
prove that all participants had 
T1DM. However, we found no 
important discrepancies between 
those who did and did not have 
diagnostic evidence (eg, childhood 
onset, diabetes antibodies, and 
nonobese body weight). Second, 
the generalizability of the findings 
is unknown. We cannot determine 
how many of the members of the 
online group are active, have T1DM 
(versus being health care providers, 
family members, or others with 
general interest), and would be 
eligible to participate in the study. 
In addition, children and adults 
adhering to a VLCD and remaining 
in this online community may 
represent a special subpopulation 
with high levels of motivation and 
other health-related behaviors 
(eg, physical activity), presenting 
another source of selection bias. 
Therefore, the study sample may 
not be representative of all people 
with T1DM in the social media 
group and may differ from the 
general T1DM population in ways 
that could influence the safety, 
effectiveness, and practicality 
of a VLCD. Third, we did not 
obtain detailed information on 
participants’ diet and other 
components of this diabetes 
management approach, nor did 
we assess factors contributing to 
glycemic control before the self-
reported start of the VLCD.
CONCLUSIONS
We suggest that a VLCD may 
allow for exceptional control of 
T1DM without increased risk of 
adverse events. This possibility is

 mechanistically plausible because 
of the dominant effects of dietary 
carbohydrates on postprandial 
glycemia and the lower insulin doses 
required with a VLCD. The results, if 
confirmed in clinical trials, indicate 
that the chronic complications of 
T1DM might be prevented by diet. 
In light of study limitations, these 
findings by themselves should 
not be interpreted as sufficient 
to justify a change in diabetes 
management. Additional research 
is needed to determine the degree 
of carbohydrate restriction (and 
other dietary aspects) necessary 
to achieve these benefits, optimal 
insulin regimen to accompany a 
VLCD (specifically, with regard to 
avoiding severe hypoglycemia), 
safety and efficacy (in randomized 
controlled trials). If this work 
is a success, trials to evaluate 
effectiveness in preventing long-
term diabetes complications should 
be conducted.
