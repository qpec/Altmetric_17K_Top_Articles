ABSTRACT
Aims
To assess the effectiveness for Scotland’s National Naloxone Programme (NNP) by comparison between 2006–10
(before) and 2011–13 (after NNP started in January 2011) and to assess cost-effectiveness. Design
This was a pre–post
evaluation of a national policy. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by prescription costs against life-years gained per opioid-
related death (ORD) averted. Setting
Scotland, in community settings and all prisons. Intervention
Brief training
and standardized naloxone supply became available to individuals at risk of opioid overdose. Measurements
ORDs as
identified by National Records of Scotland. Look-back determined the proportion of ORDs who, in the 4 weeks before
ORD, had been (i) released from prison (primary outcome) and (ii) released from prison or discharged from hospital
(secondary). We report 95% confidence intervals for effectiveness in reducing the primary (and secondary) outcome in
2011–13 versus 2006–10. Prescription costs were assessed against 1 or 10 life-years gained per averted ORD.
Findings
In 2006–10, 9.8% of ORDs (193 of 1970) were in people released from prison within 4 weeks of death,
whereas only 6.3% of ORDs in 2011–13 followed prison release (76 of 1212, P < 0.001; this represented a difference of
3.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6–5.4%)]. This reduction in the proportion of prison release ORDs translates into
42 fewer prison release ORDs (95% CI = 19–65) during 2011–13, when 12 000 naloxone kits were issued at current prescrip-
tion cost of £225 000. Scotland’s secondary outcome reduced from 19.0 to 14.9%, a difference of 4.1% (95% CI = 1.4–6.7%).
Conclusions
Scotland’s National Naloxone Programme, which started in 2011, was associated with a 36% reduction in
the proportion of opioid-related deaths that occurred in the 4 weeks following release from prison.

INTRODUCTION
Opioid overdose is a major cause of premature mortality
[1]. In Scotland, drugs-related deaths (DRDs) averaged
500 per annum during 2006–10, nearly 80% of them
opioid-related [2,3]. Scotland has one of the European
Union’s highest DRD rates at 94 per million of population,
and almost as high as the United States at 116 DRDs per
million of population [4].
One-third of receptions into Scottish prison custody test
positive for opiates [5], and surveillance shows that in
2010 [6], as in the 1990s, one-third of inmates has a his-
tory of injection drug use. Scotland has some 60 000
problem drug users (PDUs) [7,8], of whom two-fifths are
aged 35+ years. More than 20 000 clients receive opioid-
substitution therapy [5,9], which is continued in Scottish
prison custody [10].
The risk of DRD is particularly high for problem drug
users after periods of relative abstinence, most notably soon
after prison release [11–13], but also after hospital dis-
charge [14,15]. The most probable reason is loss of toler-
ance of opioids, but prison release and hospital discharge
may also mark transitions to vulnerability for other rea-
sons. The first quantification of the high risk of DRD in
the 2 weeks after prison release was made in Scotland for
HIV-infected injectors released from Edinburgh Prison in

 1983–94 [12]. Bird & Hutchinson [13] showed that a
seven times higher DRD risk in the first fortnight persisted
for male releases from Scottish prison custody in 1996–99.
International meta-analysis [11] has demonstrated that
prisoners’ DRD risk is still elevated in the second 2 weeks
post-release. During 1996–10, White et al. [15] estimated
2.4 DRDs in the subsequent 4 weeks per 1000 hospital dis-
charges of Scotland’s drug treatment clients with a history
of injection drug use, approximately half the DRD risk for
ever-injectors in the 4 weeks after prison release [16].
Bird & Hutchinson [13] had proposed a prison-based
randomized controlled trial of naloxone-on-release but it
was not until 2005 that the opioid antagonist naloxone
was added to the United Kingdom’s exempt list of
prescription-only medicines that could be administered in-
tramuscularly by anyone in an emergency to save life [17].
Some long-established naloxone services in America
[18–23] gave a lead, and several editorials were pub-
lished [24–26]. Naloxone is now provided for at-risk pa-
tients and other first responders [1] by selected services
in several European countries, Australian states and
Canadian provinces.
In 2008, the UK Medical Research Council funded the
pilot phase of the individually randomized N-ALIVE Trial
to test the effectiveness of naloxone-on-release for reducing
eligible prisoners’ DRDs within 4 weeks of their prison
release (by 30%) and during the next 8 weeks (by 20%)
[16]. The N-ALIVE Trial had been due to begin in
Scotland’s adult prisons but, in January 2011, was pre-
empted when Scotland became the first country interna-
tionally to introduce a centrally funded, coordinated and
evaluated National Naloxone Policy (NNP) [27,28]; see
Supporting information.
Across Scotland, there is a standardized naloxone-
supply scheme, and a national Patient Group Directive for
supplying take-home naloxone [29]. For lay administration
to adults, Scotland followed the British National Formulary
recommendation of ‘intramuscular injection of 400 micro-
grams repeated at intervals of 2–3 minutes (in subsequent
resuscitation cycles if patient not breathing normally) until
consciousness regained, breathing normally, medical assis-
tance available, or contents of syringe used up’. After
completing a brief intervention (10–15 minutes), individ-
uals at risk of opioid overdose can be prescribed naloxone.
Training is delivered by a range of staff: nurses, pharma-
cists, voluntary-sector workers and peer trainers, and takes
place typically in community substance misuse services
and
pharmacies.
All
15
prisons
in
Scotland
offer
naloxone-on-release.
Evidence of naloxone’s effectiveness in reducing fatalities
from opioid overdose was rated as weak by the World Health
Organization [30], and has been insufficient for policy
change in America [4]. Scotland’s NNP makes it uniquely
placed to address these important limitations on empirical
knowledge about naloxone’s effectiveness at a population
level. In this paper, we: (1) summarize the power of
Scotland’s before/after evaluation of its National Naloxone
Policy based on well-defined primary and secondary out-
comes; (2) appraise the evidence for NNP’s effectiveness by
comparing outcomes in the 5 years before NNP (2006–10)
and in NNP’s first 3 years (2011–13); (3) apply Hill’s criteria
for the assessment of causality; and (4) estimate the prescrip-
tion cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by
ORD prevention, alternatively for 1 or 10 years.
METHODS
The N-ALIVE team highlighted that ORDs in Scotland had
been on a rising trajectory for the past decade and were
therefore not optimal for evaluation purposes [28] (see also
Supporting information). Instead, Scotland’s evaluation
should focus on those at highest risk of ORD, who might
be expected to benefit most from NNP
, and on modest effect
sizes. The percentage of ORDs with a 4-week antecedent of
prison release (hereafter prison release ORDs) was there-
fore agreed as the primary outcome, with before/after eval-
uation periods of at least 3 years [28,31,32]. In 2012, a
secondary outcome (the proportion of ORDs with a 4-week
antecedent of prison release or hospital discharge) was in-
cluded to maintain statistical power at 3 years for the lower
target reduction of 20%.
Pre-NNP
, 10% of ORDs were prison release ORDs. The
5-year baseline period (2006–10) gave a pre-NNP denomi-
nator of around 2000 ORDs. For 80% statistical power, the
NNP evaluation periods were defined as follows: (a) 2011–13
(expected denominator: 1200 ORDs) to discern upper target
of 30% reduction in prison release ORDs from 10 to 7%; (b)
2011–15 (expected denominator: 2000 ORDs) to discern
lower target of 20% reduction in prison release ORDs from
10 to 8%; and (c) 2011–13 to discern 20% reduction in
the secondary outcome [14,15,28] from 20 to 16%.
Ascertainment of Scotland’s primary outcome: prison
release ORDs
In August of eachyear, National Records of Scotland releases
official statistics on the number of DRDs (using the UK’s
harmonized definition) that were registered in Scotland in
the preceding calendar year. With rare exceptions, the
calendar year in which a DRD is registered in Scotland is
the calendar year in which the death occurred [2,33].
On request of the National Naloxone Advisory Group,
National Records of Scotland classified DRDs in which
heroin/morphine, methadone or buprenorphine was impli-
cated in the cause of death as ORDs [3,31,32]. To ascertain
the most recent prison release date and most recent hospital
discharge date for each ORD (pre-NNP and in 2011–13), a
series of permissions was obtained by Information Services

 Division, Scotland for its named staff to conduct the neces-
sary look-backs using electronically held Scottish prisoner
and morbidity records, namely: from Scotland’s Privacy Ac-
cess Committee (twice), Scottish Prison Service and Disclo-
sure Scotland clearances. Consequently, only in February
2012 did the National Naloxone Advisory Group learn that
the pre-NNP proportion of ORDs with a 4-week antecedent
of prison release was nearer 10% [28,31] than the expected
17% (based on extrapolation from male releases aged
15–35 years in 1996–99 [13]). Subsequent record-linkage
showed the pre-NNP proportion of prison release or hospital
discharge ORDs was approximatelyone-fifth, with little over-
lap between ORDs with the two types of antecedent [3].
The 4-week prison release antecedent counted the date
of prison release as day 1, as in Bird & Hutchinson [13], but
to avoid deaths in hospital the second 4-week count started
on the day after hospital discharge, as in Merrall et al. [14].
Statistical methods
As designed, we use χ2 tests on one degree of freedom to
compare the proportion of prison release ORDs between
2006 and 2010, as baseline, and 2011–13, the first 3 years
of Scotland’s NNP; and similarly for prison release or hospi-
tal discharge ORDs [28]. We also compute 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for the reduction in primary and secondary
outcomes.
We define primaryeffectiveness as: 1 minus [proportion
of ORDs in 2011–13 with 4-week antecedent of prison
release/proportion of ORDs in 2006–10 with 4-week ante-
cedent of prison release]. By randomly sampling (1000
times) from the independent normal distributions for the
two proportions, we can compute a 95% confidence inter-
val for NNP-associated effectiveness in reducing prison re-
lease ORDs. Similar effectiveness calculations are made
for Scotland’s secondary outcome.
Scotland’s
before/after
evaluation
was
non-ran-
domized, as Ministers had already decided that Scotland’s
NNP would come into effect from 2011 when advice was
given on the choice of primary outcome. We therefore ap-
ply Hill’s criteria [34] to appraise whether the observed re-
duction in prison release ORDs can be attributed to NNP
.
By estimating how many fewer prison release ORDs
there were during 2011–13 when Scotland issued nearly
12 000 naloxone kits, applying quality-of-life as only 0.7
for those at risk of ORD [35,36] and discounting future
life-years by 3% per annum, we provide alternative 95%
CIs for prescription-cost per QALY gained if the life-years
gained by ORD prevention are 1 or 10 years.
RESULTS
To the nearest hundred, Scotland issued 2500 naloxone
kits in 2011, 3900 in 2012 and 5500 in 2013; see Table 1.
Table 1 shows that 193 (9.8%) of 1970 ORDs during
2006–10 were released from prison in the 4 weeks prior
to death, but only 76 (6.3%) of 1212 ORDs in 2011–13
were χ2
(1) of 12.06, P < 0.001. The observed reduction
in Scotland’s percentage of prison release ORDs is 3.5%
(95% CI = 1.6–5.4%), so that the first 3 years of Scotland’s
NNPare associated with a 36% reduction in the proportion
of prison release ORDs (95% CI for NNP effectiveness in
reducing prison release ORDs: 20–51%). These results
are consistent by gender and age groups; see Table 2.
During 2006–10, 19.0% of Scotland’s ORDs had been
released from prison or discharged from hospital in the
4 weeks prior to death versus only 14.9% in 2011–13
(χ2
(1) of 8.55, P = 0.003). This translates to a 22% de-
crease in the proportion of Scotland’s ORDs with a 4-week
antecedent of prison release or hospital discharge (95% CI
for NNP-effectiveness in reducing prison release or hospital
discharge ORDs: 7–33%).
Having issued nearly 12 000 naloxone kits during
2011–13, Scotland’s NNP may have prevented 42 prison
release ORDs (95% CI = 19–65) at a prescription cost
(currently) of less than £225 000. By assuming that quality
of life is only 0.7 for those at risk of ORD [35,36] and that
the life-years gained by ORD prevention are 1 or 10 years,
alternative 95% CIs for the prescription cost per QALY
gained are £4900–16 900 and £560–1940 (with 3% per
annum discounting if 10 life-years were gained, QALYs
would be 6.1).
Hill’s criteria for attribution of causality
Based on our application to Scotland’s NNP of Hill’s criteria
on causality (see Supporting information), we suggest that
the following are met: strength, consistency, specificity,
analogy, temporality (partially), biological gradient, plausi-
bility, coherence and experiment (partially). Here, we men-
tion only specificity and temporality, as their justification is
more intricate.
For
specificity,
we
consider
what
percentage
of
Scotland’s ORDs with a 12-week antecedent of prison re-
lease occurred during the first 4 weeks [3], and compare
this 4-week spike-percentage before and after the start
of Scotland’s NNP
. Pre-NNP
, the spike-percentage in
2006–10 was 193 of 265 (73%), but during 2011–13 it
reduced significantly to 76 of 136 (56%), P < 0.001.
Bycontrast, the 4-week spike-percentage before and after
prison-based opioid-substitution therapy became Scotland’s
health-care standard [10] was 75% (88 of 117 ORDs) in
2000–02 (before) and unchanged thereafter at 77% (102
of 132) in 2003–07. We suggest that the change now ob-
served in the 4-week spike-percentage with Scotland’s
NNP is specific, because a corresponding analysis for
prison-based opioid substitution therapy evinced no such
reduction, either in Scotland or New South Wales [37].

 For
temporality, information was unavailable on
England’s proportion of ORDs in 2011 and 2012 with a
4-week antecedent of prison release [38]. Moreover, Table 3
shows a different pattern of ORDs by age group between
England and Scotland even pre-NNP
. We note a marked de-
crease across 2011–13 in Scotland’s younger ORDs, which
is not explained by Scotland’s decrease in problem drug
users younger than 35 years for whom central estimates
were 34 200 [7] pre-NNP and 31 000 [8] currently.
A possible source of temporal confounding is the
Scottish Government’s 2010 Criminal Justice and Licens-
ing Bill, which introduced a presumption against custodial
sentences of up to 3 months, and came into effect from
February 2011. In the Supporting information, we consider
the bill’s impact on opiate-positive receptions into, and
number of liberations from, Scottish prison custody pre-
NNP and during 2011–13 when there was a significant
8% decrease in the percentage of November receptions
who tested positive for opiates (down from 36 to 33%), but
the mean number of liberations did not increase. Temporal
confounding cannot be ruled out absolutely
.
DISCUSSION
Primary and secondary outcomes
Scotland’s issue of naloxone kits exceeded 3600 (nine times as
many as Scotland’s ORDs) [28] in both 2012 and 2013, but
did not achieve the threshold of 8000 per annum (20 times
as many as Scotland’s ORDs). Availability of naloxone kits

 may have been close to 8000 in 2013, as kits issued in a
previous year will carry over if not lost, used or out of date.
Scotland’s NNP had prison release ORDs as its primary
outcome: they decreased by 36% from 9.8 to 6.3% and the
secondary outcome (which includes the primary) from 19
to 14.9% (22% reduction). Both are in line with the prior
plausible effectiveness-range for naloxone of 20–30%. As
Scotland’s NNP accelerated (2500 kits in 2011, 3900 in
2012, 5500 in 2013), reduction in the primary outcome
was enhanced approximately pro rata; see Table 1.
In contrast, Scotland’s NNP has had little apparent ef-
fect on the hospital discharge component of its secondary
outcome [3]. The reason may be both lack of power to dis-
cern an effect size more modest than 30% on hospital
discharged ORDs per se and that high DRD risk soon after
hospital discharge is less well known by opioid users—even
in Scotland—than the internationally endorsed DRD risk
soon after prison release [12]. Future research should
aim to explore this further.
If we assume that Hill’s criteria for causality [34] are
mostly met (see Supporting information), naloxone’s effec-
tiveness for reducing prison release ORDs is supported
with a lower 95% confidence limit of 20% effectiveness.
However, generalization from effectiveness for prison re-
lease ORDs cannot be taken for granted, neither within
Scotland, as the 95% CI for effectiveness on prison release
or hospital discharge ORDs warns (7–33%), nor outside
the United Kingdom, where prisons or communities might
be less efficient in issuing naloxone kits, clients may be
more or less adept in their retention and use and intrinsic
ORD risk may also be different. Uncertainty about second-
ary effectiveness being still wide, the fifth year of Scotland’s
NNP provides an opportunity to encourage hospital
doctors and general practitioners to prescribe naloxone kits
to at-risk clients on discharge from any hospital stay.
Cost-effectiveness
Detailed cost-effectiveness depends upon how many
QALYs the averting of one prison release ORD represents
(illustrated for the range 0.7–6.1), the non-prescription
costs associated with naloxone (including outreach and
brief training) and any averted or additional costs (fewer
presentations to accident and emergency; extra criminal
justice costs). There may be additional averted ORDs which
neither Scotland’s primary outcome nor our outline cost-
effectiveness counts; for example, some of the observed de-
crease in ORDs in the younger age group. It is unlikely that
any of these considerations—apart from criminal justice
costs—would deny naloxone’s cost-effectiveness; see also
Coffin et al. [40]. Excessive prescription or outreach costs
which exceeded half the current prescription cost (£19)
should, however, be avoided.
Study implications
Our findings have important implications for public health
authorities across the United Kingdom and internationally.
Wales, like Scotland, has a NNP
. Unlike Scotland, Wales
([41,42] and personal communication from Dr Josie Smith,
Harm Reduction Database Wales: Take Home Naloxone
2013–2014, Public Health Wales, 15 December 2014)
does not have sufficient ORDs (approximately 85 per
annum pre-NNP) for a 5-year before/after evaluation of
its NNP to be statistically powerful.
England has yet to formalize a monitored NNP [43,44]
but would need to issue a minimum of 9000 naloxone kits
annually, ideally 20 000 [28]. With 1000 ORDs per
annum in England, the impact of an efficiently imple-
mented NNP could be evident as a marked reduction in
England’s prison release ORDs within 18 months [39]
when compared with the previous 30 months.
In 2014, the N-ALIVE pilot trial randomized 80 eligible
prisoners per month in English prisons who, at liberation,
received an N-ALIVE pack which either contained
naloxone for intramuscular injection or did not. In the light
of Scotland’s 3-year results and N-ALIVE’s own data on
ex-prisoners’ altruistic administration, N-ALIVE’s Trial
Steering and Data Monitoring Committee agreed that an
individually randomized main trial was unfeasible and that

 randomization should cease with not-yet-released partici-
pants being offered naloxone-on-release. This decision
was implemented on 8 December 20141 and peer-review
publications will follow.
Strengths and limitations of this study
This study is the first attempt to evaluate a national nalox-
one programme at a population level with before/after
analyses by design at 3 years and 5 years.
Its strengths include ministerial acceptance of method-
ological advice that the primary outcome in Scotland’s
NNP evaluation should be reduction in prison release
ORDs, not in ORDs which were liable to strong systematic
and idiosyncratic variation; see Table 3 and Supporting in-
formation. Secondly, Scotland’s evaluation was powered
adequately to discern modest 20–30% effectiveness.
Thirdly, the Information Services Division, tasked with de-
riving and publishing Scotland’s primary and secondary
outcomes as official statistics, is bound by the code of prac-
tice for the UK’s official statisticians, which ensures
freedom from political or other influence. Fourthly, ministe-
rial acceptance of a standardized naloxone-supply across
Scotland meant that quarterly issue and reimbursement
of naloxone kits could be monitored closely—not least be-
cause most clients gave consent for demographical details
to be centralized. Every 2 years, there is information from
Scotland’s Needle Exchange Surveillance Initiative [45]
about the proportion of its injector-interviewees who were
prescribed naloxone (and by whom) in the past year [28].
Fifthly, the non-randomized before/after design for NNP’s
evaluation recognizes that community-prescribed nalox-
one is more likely to be administered to someone other
than the person for whom it was prescribed [22,28], which
compromises individually randomized studies of naloxone’s
beneficiaries.
Acknowledged limitations are, first, that the NNP start
was determined by Ministers and was not subject to ran-
domization; for example, as a randomized regional step-
wedge design. Confounding of Scotland’s before/after
NNPevaluation cannot be ruled out; hence our need to ap-
praise causality by Hill’s criteria and the recommendation
that other nations’ NNPs be also evaluated formally.
Secondly, Scotland’s evaluation periods were extended
from 3 to 5 years, and a secondary outcome defined when
it was identified that prison release ORDs were only 10% of
Scotland’s ORDs pre-NNP [28]. Thirdly, drug treatment
clients’ high DRD risk in the 4 weeks after any hospital
discharge, which is a key component of our secondary out-
come, has been validated within Scotland (for 2006–10
[15]), but no study outside Scotland has yet endorsed or
challenged it. Fourthly, the beneficiary of community-
issued naloxone is typically not the person for whom it
was prescribed [28]: NNP’s beneficiaries are therefore not
individually identifiable. The N-ALIVE pilot trial ceased in-
dividual randomizations because its own feedback, to-
gether with Scotland’s data [3,31,32], confirmed that
only one-third of naloxone-on-release kits are used on the
ex-prisoner for whom the kit was prescribed. Without as-
sortative mixing, this one-third rate is lower than would
be expected if recently released prisoners’ high ORD rate
was due to high overdose rate rather than high fatality rate
per opioid overdose. If the latter holds, then a further limi-
tation is that NNP’s effectiveness in respect of prison release
ORDs could be an overestimation of its generalized effec-
tiveness. Finally, generalization from a single well-powered
national before/after evaluation could be recommended
more confidently if Scotland’s results were validated
elsewhere.

CONCLUSION
With 2 years of Scotland’s National Naloxone Programme
to follow, the current data suggest at least 20% and best es-
timate of 36% reduction in prison release ORDs, which
may be due directly to the programme. Scotland’s 3-year
results may encourage other nations to adopt naloxone
policies. Implementation of national naloxone programmes
should be monitored closely and results put into the public
domain to facilitate evidence synthesis.
Declaration of interests
S.M.B. is a co-principal investigator for the MRC-funded
N-ALIVE pilot Trial which, by unanimous decision of its
Trial Steeringand Data Monitoring Committee, ceased ran-
domization on 8 December 2014 and offered naloxone-
on-release to already-randomized, not-yet-released prisoners
who had been assigned to the control group. All four
authors serve on Scotland’s National Naloxone Advisory
Group, which C.H. chairs, but write in a personal capacity.
S.M.B. was, on two occasions, a funded invited speaker at
the Academic and Health Policy Conference on Correc-
tional Health. S.M.B. holds GSK shares.
Ethical approval
Approval in the public interest was obtained by the NHS
National Services Scotland Information Services Division
from Scotland’s Privacy Access Committee to conduct
the look-back from Scotland’s drugs-related deaths in
2006–15 to obtain dates of (i) most recent prison release
and (ii) most recent hospital discharge. Those to whom
naloxone was prescribed gave freely (or withheld) informed

Acknowledgements
The multi-disciplinary National Naloxone Advisory Group
(NNAG), a subgroup of Scotland’s independent National
Forum on Drug Related Deaths which had advocated for
naloxone funding, has kept under review the issue of nal-
oxone kits in regional communities and by Scottish prisons.
To NNAG is owed the credit for timely setting of perfor-
mance targets and myriad close attention to detail. In
August of each year, National Records of Scotland notifies
Scotland’s Information Services Division about all opioid-
related deaths in Scotland in the preceding calendar year.
Look-back to the 4-week antecedents (prison release or
hospital discharge) of the notified opioid-related deaths is
conducted by staff of the Information Services Division
and the outcomes are reported as official statistics.
The authors gratefully acknowledge the independent
work of Scotland’s official statisticians in conducting and
reporting the look-backs for which they obtained the ap-
proval of Scotland’s Privacy Access Committee and from
the Scottish Prison Service. In particular, we acknowledge
the work of Lee Barnsdale. The authors wish also to ac-
knowledge constructive comments from two anonymous
referees which greatly improved, and simplified, the paper.
S.M.B. is funded by Medical Research Council programme
number MC_U105260794. The funder had no role in
the writing of, or decision to publish, this paper. All data
presented are within the public domain, having been
published as official statistics by Scotland’s Information
Services Division.
