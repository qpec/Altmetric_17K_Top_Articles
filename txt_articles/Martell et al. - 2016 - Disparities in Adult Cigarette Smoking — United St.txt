Although cigarette smoking has substantially declined since 
the release of the 1964 Surgeon General’s report on smoking 
and health,* disparities in tobacco use exist among racial/
ethnic populations (1). Moreover, because estimates of U.S. 
adult cigarette smoking and tobacco use are usually limited 
to aggregate racial or ethnic population categories (i.e., non-
Hispanic whites [whites]; non-Hispanic blacks or African 
Americans [blacks]; American Indians and Alaska Natives 
[American Indians/Alaska Natives]; Asians; Native Hawaiians 
or Pacific Islanders [Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders]; and 
Hispanics/Latinos [Hispanics]), these estimates can mask dif-
ferences in cigarette smoking prevalence among subgroups of 
these populations. To assess the prevalence of and changes in 
cigarette smoking among persons aged ≥18 years in six racial/
ethnic populations and 10 select subgroups in the United 
States,† CDC analyzed self-reported data collected during 
2002–2005 and 2010–2013 from the National Survey on 
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (2) and compared differ-
ences between the two periods. During 2010–2013, the over-
all prevalence of cigarette smoking among the racial/ethnic 
populations and subgroups ranged from 38.9% for American 
Indians/Alaska Natives to 7.6% for both Chinese and Asian 
Indians. During 2010–2013, although cigarette smoking 
prevalence was relatively low among Asians overall (10.9%) 
compared with whites (24.9%), wide within-group differences 
in smoking prevalence existed among Asian subgroups, from 
7.6% among both Chinese and Asian Indians to 20.0% among 
Koreans. Similarly, among Hispanics, the overall prevalence 
of current cigarette smoking was 19.9%; however, within 
Hispanic subgroups, prevalences ranged from 15.6% among 
Central/South Americans to 28.5% among Puerto Ricans. 
The overall prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among 
men than among women during both 2002–2005 (30.0% 
men versus 23.9% women) and 2010–2013 (26.4% versus 
21.1%) (p<0.05). These findings highlight the importance 
of disaggregating tobacco use estimates within broad racial/
ethnic population categories to better understand and address 
disparities in tobacco use among U.S. adults.

drug use, drug use disorders, and tobacco use, from a nationally

representative sample of the U.S. noninstitutionalized, civilian 
population aged ≥12 years. To obtain a sample size large enough 
to examine current cigarette smoking§ within disaggregated 
racial/ethnic subgroups, multiple years of data were combined; 
estimates for adults aged ≥18 years were based on combined 
data from 2002–2005 (N = 180,833) and 2010–2013 
(N = 183,623). The average, weighted, overall response rate 
for respondents aged ≥18 years was 69.0% for the 2002–2005 
NSDUH surveys and 62.4% for the 2010–2013 surveys.
Race/ethnicity was determined based on respondents’ self-
reported classification. For race, respondents were asked, 
“Which of these groups best describes you?” Response selec-
tions were “white”; “black or African American”; “American 
Indian or Alaska Native”; “Native Hawaiian”; “other Pacific 
Islander”; “Asian”; and “other.” Persons who indicated that 
they were Asian were also asked to select the specific sub-
group (Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Asian Indian, Korean, or 
Vietnamese) that best described them. Because of small sample 
size, the “Native Hawaiian” and “other Pacific Islanders” popu-
lations were combined.¶ To identify Hispanic ethnicity, respon-
dents were asked, “Are you of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish 
origin or descent?” Those who answered affirmatively were also 
asked to select the specific Hispanic origin subgroup (Mexican, 
Puerto Rican, Central or South American, or Cuban) that 
best described them. In this report, whites and blacks refer to 
non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, respectively.
Data were weighted to yield national estimates**; 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated for all point estimates. 
Sex differences in current cigarette smoking within each racial/
ethnic population during each time period and across years 
were assessed using a t-test, with p-values <0.05 defined as 
statistically significant.††
Seven racial/ethnic populations/subgroups (whites, blacks, 
American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians/Pacific 
Islanders, Koreans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans) reported 
an overall cigarette smoking prevalence of ≥25% during 
2002–2005; however, only two of these populations/subgroups 
(American Indians/Alaska Natives [38.9%] and Puerto Ricans 
[28.5%]) had cigarette smoking prevalences ≥25% during 
2010–2013 (Table). Among six racial/ethnic populations/
subgroups (whites, blacks, Native Hawaiians/ Pacific Islanders, 
Asian Indians, Mexicans, and Central/South Americans), a 
significant decline in prevalence of cigarette smoking from 
2002–2005 to 2010–2013 was reported. No significant dif-
ferences were observed among the other groups (American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, 
Vietnamese, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans).
§ Current cigarette smokers were persons who reported smoking part or all of a 
cigarette on at least one day within the past 30 days.
¶ For this analysis, all Hispanics are included in the Hispanic group, regardless 
of race; all other race/ethnicity categories excluded Hispanics.
 
** Overall estimates included persons identifying as being of more than one of 
the listed races; however, these persons were excluded in the specific racial/
ethnic subgroup analyses.
 
†† Estimates with relative standard error >17.5% were excluded.

Smoking prevalence among Asians overall during 2010–
2013 was 10.9%. Within-group differences in smoking 
prevalence existed among Asian subgroups, ranging from 
7.6% among Chinese and Asian Indians to 20.0% among 
Koreans (Figure 1). Significant differences in smoking preva-
lence between men and women in the following four Asian 
subgroups were noted: Chinese (13.1% men versus 2.9% 
women), Filipino (20.6% versus 7.5%), Asian Indian (11.6% 
versus 3.3%), and Vietnamese (24.4% versus 7.9%). Smoking 
prevalence was similar among Korean men (19.3%) and 
women (20.4%).§§ Similarly, among Hispanics, the overall 
prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 19.9%; however, 
within Hispanic subgroups, prevalence ranged from 15.6% 
among Central/South Americans to 28.5% among Puerto 
Ricans (Figure 2). Differences between men and women were 
significant for all Hispanic subgroups: Mexicans (25.1% men 
versus 12.9% women), Puerto Ricans (32.1% versus 25.1%), 
Central or South Americans (19.8% versus 11.4%), and 
Cubans (24.1% versus 15.1%) (p<0.05).
Among men, six populations/subgroups (whites, blacks, 
Asian Indians, Koreans, Mexicans, and Central/South 
Americans) reported a significantly lower prevalence of 
cigarette smoking during 2010–2013 than during 2002–2005; 
no significant changes were observed for men in other groups. 
Among women, a significant decline in cigarette smoking from 
the period 2002–2005 to the period 2010–2013 occurred in 
three populations/subgroups (whites, blacks, and Mexicans), 
with no significant changes among women in other ethnic 
groups. The overall prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher 
among men than among women during both 2002–2005 
(30.0% men versus 23.9% women) and 2010–2013 (26.4% 
versus 21.1%) (p<0.05). During 2010–2013, among 10 racial/
ethnic populations/subgroups (white, black, Chinese, Filipino, 
Japanese, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Mexican, Puerto Rican, 
and Central/South American) men reported statistically higher 
cigarette smoking prevalence than did women. No significant 
sex differences in cigarette smoking prevalence was reported 
among American Indians/Alaska Natives (40.8% men and 
37.3% women), Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (27.0% 
men and 18.5% women), and Koreans (19.3% men and 
20.4% women).
Discussion
Although substantial progress has been made in reducing 
overall cigarette smoking prevalence among U.S. adults (3,4), 
disparities exist among racial/ethnic populations, including

disproportionately higher smoking prevalence in some racial/
ethnic populations, and wide within-group variations. The 
highest prevalence of cigarette smoking was observed among 
American Indians/Alaska Natives, for whom no decline was 
observed during the assessed period; in addition, no significant 
changes were observed among Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, 
Korean, Vietnamese, Puerto Rican, and Cuban adults.
National estimates of cigarette smoking prevalence among 
U.S. racial/ethnic populations are often reported as aggregate 
estimates, which can obscure within-group disparities. For exam-
ple, the findings in this report indicate substantial disparities in 
adult cigarette smoking among and within Asian and Hispanic 
populations, with Koreans and Puerto Ricans reporting the high-
est cigarette smoking prevalences within their respective racial/
ethnic populations. These differences might be caused, in part, 
by variations in socioeconomic status, acculturation, targeted 
advertising, price of tobacco products, and practices related to 
the acceptability of tobacco use across population groups (1). 
In addition, these findings indicate disproportionately higher 
smoking prevalences among men compared with women within 
racial/ethnic groups. These differences underscore the impor-
tance of implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce 
tobacco use among all population groups, particularly those 
with the highest prevalence (1).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, respondents were able to complete the interview 
only in English or Spanish, which might have resulted in 
misreporting or nonresponse among persons who do not speak 
either language. Second, cigarette use was self-reported and 
might have been subject to misreporting; however, studies have 
found that self-reported cigarette smoking correlates highly 
with biochemical tests such as serum cotinine, irrespective of 
race/ethnicity (5). Third, because NSDUH does not include 
institutionalized populations and persons in the military, results

might not be generalizable to these groups. Fourth, the results 
from this study did not report variations in cigarette smoking 
prevalence among all racial/ethnic populations because the 
U.S. Census does not identify subgroups for whites, blacks 
and American Indians/Alaska Natives. However, regional 
differences in cigarette smoking prevalence among American 
Indians/Alaska Natives exist. For example, cigarette smoking 
is higher among American Indians living in the Northern 
Plains region, as well as among Alaska Natives living in Alaska 
compared with American Indians living in the Southwest (6). 
Finally, these estimates might differ from results from other 
surveillance systems. For example, cigarette smoking prevalence 
estimates from the National Health Interview Survey tend to 
be consistently lower each year than those estimated by the 
NSDUH (7). Differences in prevalence between the National 
Health Interview Survey and NSDUH can be partially 
explained by differing survey methodologies, types of surveys 
administered, and definitions of current smoking; however, 
trends in prevalence are comparable across surveys.
Reducing the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking among 
U.S. adults to the Healthy People 2020 target of ≤12%¶¶ can 
be achieved through the implementation and enforcement 
of evidence-based tobacco control initiatives. Proven inter-
ventions, including increasing the price of tobacco products 
coupled with evidence-based cessation services, comprehensive 
smoke-free policies, media campaigns, and promotion of ces-
sation treatment in clinical settings, are effective in reducing 
tobacco use and tobacco-related disease and death in all racial/
ethnic populations (8,9). If broadly implemented and enforced, 
these interventions could also reduce tobacco-related health 
disparities (8–10). In addition, opportunities exist to involve 
members of racial/ethnic communities in expanded tobacco 
control activities for specific populations, such as conducting 
linguistically and culturally competent educational campaigns.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Although cigarette smoking has substantially declined since 
1964, disparities in tobacco use varies among racial/ethnic 
populations. Estimates of U.S. adult cigarette smoking preva-
lence and tobacco use are usually limited to aggregate racial/
ethnic population categories.
What is added by this report?
From the period 2002–2005 to the period 2010–2013, declines 
in cigarette smoking occurred among some racial/ethnic 
populations. Moreover, the relative change in smoking even 
among groups that did experience a decline varied across 
racial/ethnic populations. Substantial disparities in adult 
cigarette smoking prevalence exist among and within Asian and 
Hispanic subgroups, with Koreans and Puerto Ricans reporting 
the highest cigarette smoking prevalences within their 
respective racial/ethnic population. These findings indicate 
disproportionately higher smoking prevalence among men 
compared with women within most racial/ethnic groups.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Disparities in smoking prevalence exist among racial/ethnic 
populations, and several racial/ethnic populations have 
disproportionately higher prevalences of smoking and wide 
within-group variations. Proven interventions, including 
increasing the price of tobacco products coupled with 
evidence-based cessation services, comprehensive smoke-free 
policies, media campaigns, and promotion of cessation 
treatment in clinical settings, are effective strategies in reducing 
the overall prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related 
disease and death.
