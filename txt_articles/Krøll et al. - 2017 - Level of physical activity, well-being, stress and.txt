Abstract
Background: The prevalence of migraine with co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain is high in the
general population. However, there is very little literature on the characteristics of these combined conditions. The
aim of this study was to investigate a) the prevalence of migraine with co-existing tension-type headache and neck
pain in a clinic-based sample, b) the level of physical activity, psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-
rated health in persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain compared to healthy
controls, c) the perceived ability of persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain to
perform physical activity, and d) which among the three conditions (migraine, tension-type headache or neck pain)
is rated as the most burdensome condition.
Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral specialised headache centre where questionnaires on
physical activity, psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated health were completed by 148 persons
with migraine and 100 healthy controls matched by sex and average age. Semi-structured interviews were
conducted to assess characteristics of migraine, tension-type headache and neck pain.
Results: Out of 148 persons with migraine, 100 (67%) suffered from co-existing tension-type headache and neck
pain. Only 11% suffered from migraine only. Persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and
neck pain had lower level of physical activity and psychological well-being, higher level of perceived stress and
poorer self-rated health compared to healthy controls. They reported reduced ability to perform physical activity
owing to migraine (high degree), tension-type headache (moderate degree) and neck pain (low degree). The most
burdensome condition was migraine, followed by tension-type headache and neck pain.
Conclusions: Migraine with co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain was highly prevalent in a clinic-based
sample. Persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain may require more individually
tailored interventions to increase the level of physical activity, and to improve psychological well-being, perceived
stress and self-rated health.

 Background
The prevalence of migraine in Europe is 15% [1], and
persons with migraine often suffer from co-morbidities
such as tension-type headache (TTH) and neck pain (NP).
In a population study, 94% of persons with migraine re-
ported co-existing TTH [2], and NP was found among
89.3% of persons with migraine with co-existing TTH [3].
The prognosis of migraine may worsen with co-existing
TTH [4], and NP has been found to be a predictor of in-
creased disability in persons with migraine [5].
This study focuses on persons with migraine and co-
existing TTH and NP. There is very little literature on
the characteristics of persons with migraine and co-
existing TTH and NP. There are, to our knowledge, no
studies that describe their symptomatology, physical
activity, psychological well-being, perceived stress or
self-rated health. These characterizations are important
when considering potential treatment strategies.
It is not known whether specific nonpharmacologi-
cal
treatments
could
be
particularly
helpful
for
persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP.
Lifestyle modifications like exercise, relaxation and
biofeedback
are
recommended
nonpharmacological
strategies
for persons
with
migraine
[6–9].
These
modalities may also be effective in treating the co-
existing TTH and NP [10–13].
The aim of this study was to investigate a) the preva-
lence of migraine and co-existing TTH and NP in a
clinic-based sample, b) the level of physical activity, psy-
chological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated
health in persons with migraine and co-existing TTH
and NP compared to healthy controls, c) the perceived
ability of persons with migraine and co-existing TTH
and NP to perform physical activity, and d) which
among the three conditions (migraine, TTH or NP) is
rated as the most burdensome condition.
Methods
Participants
Two
hundred
persons
with
migraine
aged
18-65,
screened for exclusion criteria and who initially accepted
participation were consecutively recruited from a tertiary
referral headache centre between February 2014 and
March 2015 148 (74%) returned the questionnaires and
were included in the study (Fig. 1).
Exclusion criteria were: whiplash injury, significant
neck trauma (defined as a history of trauma to the neck,
fracture, distortion and violent attack which have caused

 the current NP), post traumatic headache, medication-
overuse headache, cluster headache, trigeminal neural-
gia, pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, severe physical
and/or mental diseases, abuse of alcohol or drugs and
inability to speak or understand Danish.
Between June 2014 and October 2015, 100 headache-
free and healthy controls were recruited among hospital
staff by modified snowball sampling and advertisement.
Exclusion criteria were abuse of alcohol or drugs, inabil-
ity to speak and understand Danish, regular intake of
analgesics, NP and TTH frequency ≥1 day per month.
The healthy controls were matched to the included
persons with migraine by the average value of age and
the percentage distribution of sex.
Procedure
The participants with migraine (n = 148) and healthy con-
trols (n = 100) completed three questionnaires which were
validated for the target population in a previous study
[14]; (a) The International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ short form) [15], (b) the 5-item World Health
Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) [16] and (c)
Impact of Migraine, Tension-Type Headache and Neck
Pain (Impact of Migraine , TTH and NP) [14]. A max-
imum of three reminders were sent out.
Interview
Migraine, TTH and NP
The participants filled out a 4-week diagnostic headache
diary before the first visit in the headache centre. Based
on data from the diary and a neurological examination
the neurologist ascertained the diagnosis of migraine.
They were then interviewed using a modified semi-
structured headache interview [17, 18] which was
supplemented with questions regarding NP. NP was
defined as pain located to the anatomic region of the
neck with or without radiation to the head, trunk,
and upper limbs grade I-II, based on the classification
system developed by the Neck Pain Task Force [19],
which have set a conceptual model for the onset,
course, and care of NP.
To distinguish NP from NP associated with the mi-
graine attack itself and NP outside the migraine attack
the participants were asked: “Do you have NP associated
with the migraine attack?” “Do you have NP associated
with TTH?” “Do you have NP without headache?”
The screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria and
all interviews were done by specially trained medical
students (TN, LBS) and the primary investigator (LSK).
The semi-structured headache interview [17] was origin-
ally based on International Classification of Headache
Disorders (ICHD) criteria from 1988 [20], but the inter-
view guide provided enough information to classify mi-
graine and TTH according to the ICHD-3 beta criteria
[21]. Based on the interview, the one-year prevalence
and average days of migraine, TTH and NP per month
were determined.
Questionnaires
IPAQ short form
The level of physical activity was measured using the
IPAQ short form [14, 15]. IPAQ measures time and energy
expenditure in the past 7 days. Participants were classified
as having low, moderate or high levels of physical activity
based on the standard algorithm [22]. The IPAQ protocol
considers performed physical activity and their corre-
sponding metabolic equivalent task (MET). One MET is
equivalent to energy expenditure while resting. Partici-
pants were excluded from the analyses if they answered
“don’t know/insecure” in any of the categories of walking,
moderate or vigorous physical activity, and if time spent
on any of the categories were unreasonably high.
WHO-5
Psychological well-being was measured by WHO-5 [16],
which is based on five items with a two-week recall
period. Responses were rated on six-point Likert cat-
egories (0 to 5). The scores were summed (maximum
score 25) and then multiplied by 4 (range 0 to 100 with
lower scores indicate lower well-being). The cut-off level
of ≤ 50 was used to indicate poor psychological well-
being, which may indicate stress or depression [23].
Impact of Migraine, TTH and NP questionnaire
The Impact of Migraine, TTH and NP questionnaire
consists of 79 items covering pain, triggers, psychosocial,
socioeconomic and work related aspects, based on a
four-week recall period. The questionnaire has previ-
ously been tested for face and content validity [14]. The
following items were analysed in this study: perceived
stress, self-rated health, the perceived ability to perform
physical activity and rating of the most burdensome
condition. Perceived stress and perceived ability to
perform physical activity were rated on an 11-point nu-
meric rating scale (NRS-11) with the end points 0 = no
impact and 10 = most imaginable impact as applied in
previous studies [24, 25].
Perceived stress was assessed by a reliable and valid
item from the QPS Nordic Questionnaire [26]: “Stress
means the situation when a person feels tense, restless,
nervous, or anxious, or is unable to sleep at night because
his or her mind is troubled all the time. In the past four
weeks, did you feel that kind of stress these days?”
Responses ranged from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very high
degree). To be able to analyse the different levels of
perceived stress, we coded scores 0-3 as low, scores 4–6
as moderate and 7–10 as high.
Krøll et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2017) 18:46 
Page 3 of 9
 Self-rated health was assessed by one item, originally
derived from SF 36 [27]: “In general, how would you
rate your current health?” The response categories
were: 1) very poor, 2) poor, 3) fair, 4) good or 5) very
good. The variable was changed to a binary categorical
variable “poor self-rated health” as applied in previous
studies [3, 28]. Scores 1–3 were coded as poor self-
rated health.
Perceived ability to perform physical activity was
assessed by three items: “In the past four weeks, when
having migraine/TTH/NP, how much has your ability to
perform physical activity (physical activity or strength
training) been reduced?” Responses ranged from 0 (not
reduced) to 10 (reduced to a very high degree).
Rating of the most burdensome condition was assessed
by one item: “In the past four weeks, to what extent does
your migraine, TTH and NP generally affect you? If you
consider all three conditions as adding up to 100%, to
what extent does each of these conditions affect you?”
Statistical analysis
Data on demography, lifestyle and clinical characteristics of
the participants were presented with descriptive statistics.
In comparing migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
with the control group, Independent-samples t-test was
used to test for differences in age as age was tested as
normally distributed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Chi-square
test was used to test for difference in sex, educational
attainment, physical activity, psychological well-being,
stress and self-rated health.
A significant difference in educational attainment be-
tween migraine and co-existing TTH and NP and healthy
controls was observed. Low educational level is associated
with reduced health and low level of physical activity [29],
therefore, separate binary logistic regressions were per-
formed with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP as the
outcome variable and the following as covariates: Physical
activity (low, moderate and high), psychological well-being
(score ≤ 50, yes or no), perceived stress (low, moderate
and high), and poor self-rated health (yes or no). These
analyses were controlled for educational attainment. Re-
sults from the logistic regression were presented as odds
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS version 22. Statistical significance was assumed
when p < 0.05.
Results
The 148 persons with migraine included in the study
were comprised of 106 (72%) who had migraine without
aura, 8 (5%) who had migraine with aura, and 34 (23%)
who had both migraines with and without aura. Among
them, 100 (67%) suffered from co-existing TTH and NP.
Only 11% suffered from migraine only (n = 16), 11%
suffered from migraine and co-existing TTH (n = 16),
and 11% had migraine and co-existing NP (n = 16).
Data on the participants’ demographic characteristics,
educational attainment, physical activity, psychological
well-being, perceived stress, self-rated health, headache
and NP are summarized in Table 1. There were no dif-
ferences in sex and age, but educational attainment was
significantly different, between migraine and co-existing
TTH and NP and healthy controls.
NP associated with the migraine attack was reported
by 54%, NP associated with TTH was reported by 94%
and NP without headache was reported by 66%.
Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
were significantly less physically active, reported signifi-
cantly lower psychological well-being, had higher levels
of perceived stress and poorer self-rated health com-
pared to healthy controls (Table 1).
Logistic regression analyses controlled for educational
attainment showed that migraine and co-existing TTH
and NP were strongly associated with physical activity,
psychological well-being, perceived stress and poor self-
rated health (Table 2).
For persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP,
the ability to perform physical activity was highly reduced
because of migraine (median score of 9 on a rating scale
from 0–10), moderately reduced because of TTH (median
5) and less reduced because of NP (median 3).
Almost half of the persons with migraine and co-
existing TTH and NP (48%) rated migraine as the most
burdensome of the three conditions. TTH was rated as
the most burdensome condition by 30%, and NP was
rated as the most burdensome condition by 10%. Mi-
graine and TTH were rated as equally burdensome by
6%, all three conditions as equally burdensome by 3%
and TTH and NP by 3%.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the prevalence of migraine and co-existing
TTH and NP in a clinical migraine population and to
evaluate
physical
activity,
psychological
well-being,
perceived stress and self-rated health in this subset of
persons with migraine.
The prevalence of migraine with co-existing TTH
and NP differed from the population-based study by
Ashina et al. [3] that found a one-year prevalence of
NP of 89.3% in persons suffering from migraine and
co-existing TTH. The difference may be due to the
sub-grouping of participants applied by Ashina et al.
that investigated NP in persons with migraine and co-
existing TTH. Molarius and Tegelberg [28] reported
findings similar to ours although their case ascertain-
ment was not based on ICHD-criteria.

 In accordance with our study Varkey et al. [30] found
that persons with migraine were less physically active
compared to headache-free individuals and low physical
activity was associated with a higher prevalence of mi-
graine. Interestingly, in a population study, Ashina et al.
[31] found that low physical activity was associated with
migraine and co-existing TTH to a higher degree
compared to other types of headache and the association
was stronger with TTH than migraine only. Physical
activity may be a potential migraine treatment strategy
to reduce migraine frequency, pain intensity and dur-
ation [6]. Both physical activity and stress reduction
strategies have been suggested to increase the quality of
life [32–34]. Moreover, systematic stress management,

 such as progressive muscle relaxation, reduced migraine
frequency [7] and a relaxation program has been shown
to be effective in persons with headache and neck/shoul-
der pain [12].
The characteristics of the participants with migraine
and co-existing TTH and NP reflect the findings of
other studies on the impact of migraine on psychological
well-being, an association with increased stress and poor
self-rated health [28, 35–37]. Schramm et al. [37] did
not find any differences in the level of perceived stress
between those with migraine only and those with mi-
graine and co-existing TTH. Molarius and Tegelberg
[28] found that persons with migraine and recurrent
headache reported poorer self-rated health than those
with migraine only. Reduced psychological well-being
may indicated stress or depression [23]. Persons with
migraine are in general very susceptible to stress [38, 39]
and have higher levels of stress compared to headache-
free individuals [37] which is in line with our findings.
This study showed that persons with migraine and co-
existing TTH and NP had very low level of physical
activity, and their perceived ability to perform physical
activity was reduced not only owing to migraine (to a
high degree) but also TTH and NP (to a lesser degree),
although almost 50% suffered from chronic NP. In
contrast to our study, the population study by Ashina
et al. [31] found a higher association between low
physical activity and TTH only, than between low
physical activity and migraine only. Compared to the
population study, we recruited persons with migraine
which can explain these different results.
Our results suggest that persons with migraine and
co-existing TTH and NP may have more barriers to
perform physical activity compared to those with mi-
graine only, even though TTH and NP were not rated
as
quite
as
burdensome.
Decreased
psychological
well-being, high perceived stress and low self-rated
health among those with migraine and co-existing
TTH and NP suggest conditions that may make it
more difficult to motivate this group to increase their
levels of physical activity.
Migraine, TTH and NP are complex and multi-factorial
disorders. It is important to consider implementing
multidisciplinary treatment strategies when these three
conditions are co-existing [40, 41]. Whether a physiother-
apeutic treatment modality such as physical activity has a
mutual or complementary effect on migraine and co-
existing TTH and NP has yet to be investigated.

 Strengths of this study were that the participants’
diagnoses were based on a 4-week diagnostic headache
diary before their first visit in the headache centre to-
gether with a detailed headache history and a neurological
examination. Also, an additional interview was conducted
to ascertain characteristics of migraine, TTH and NP. This
procedure reduced the risk of misclassification and
excluded other neurological diseases. The ICHD 3-beta
criteria for migraine and TTH were used, and NP was de-
scribed using the classification system by the Neck Pain
Task Force [19]. Also, all participants were presented with
a drawing of the anatomic region of the neck in order to
standardise descriptions of NP distribution area.
The response rate of persons with migraine with
returned questionnaire was relatively high [3, 28] making
our estimate of the one-year prevalence of migraine with
co-existing TTH and NP relatively strong.
We used three different variables (psychological well-
being, perceived stress and self-rated health) as measures
of health-related quality of life. These represent different
domains and together give a good indication of the head-
ache burden and what is important to consider when
deciding a relevant treatment strategy and/or outcome
measures for migraine and co-existing TTH and NP.
Limitations of the study were that participants were
recruited from one tertiary referral headache centre and
may, therefore, not represent the total migraine popula-
tion. The participants had a relatively high prevalence of
both chronic migraine (28%) and chronic TTH (17%),
which may explain our large proportion of persons with
migraine and co-existing TTH and NP. Further, such a
clinical sample may be more aware of their symptoms
and more capable of distinguishing between migraine
and TTH than the general migraine population.
Most of the healthy controls were recruited among
healthcare professionals, and were generally more highly
educated than the persons with migraine and co-existing
TTH and NP and they were more physically active than
the persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
and the general population [42]. However, they were
very close to the general population regarding sum
scores of psychological well-being [43]. Education was
therefore considered as a confounding factor in the
regression analyses.
Self-report on physical activity, psychological well-
being, stress and self-rated health may increase the risk
of recall-bias. Personal interview is stronger than self-
report in reducing recall bias, and might have prevented
the exclusion of participants who had inadequate an-
swers in the IPAQ questionnaire. The drawback is that
interview may cause interviewer bias. Prospective diary
recording of migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
together with personal interview may have been more
ideal as diagnostic tools [44].
Detailed history and diary recording are particularly
important for ascertaining multiple diagnoses. In the
future, a larger sample of participants would allow for
separate analyses of those with migraine only and mi-
graine with either co-existing TTH or NP. This would
also allow controlling for migraine disability.
There is a risk of losing power when collapsing re-
sponses into few categories, however, these categories
are more informative and easier to explain to patients.
Conclusions
Migraine and co-existing TTH and NP was highly preva-
lent in a clinical sample of persons with migraine.
Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP re-
ported significantly lower level of physical activity and
psychological well-being; higher level of perceived stress,
and poorer self-rated health than healthy controls.
Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
reported a reduced ability to perform physical activity
owing to all three conditions with migraine as the most
burdensome
condition
followed
by
TTH
and
NP.
Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP
may require more focused interventions to increase
physical activity. Whether physical activity is a beneficial
treatment modality for this group is not known, and
should be investigated in a clinical trial.
