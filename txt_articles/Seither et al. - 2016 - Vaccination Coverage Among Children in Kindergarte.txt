State-mandated vaccination requirements for school entry 
protect children and communities against vaccine-preventable 
diseases (1). Each school year, federally funded immunization 
programs (e.g., states, territories, jurisdictions) collect and 
report kindergarten vaccination data to CDC. This report 
describes vaccination coverage estimates in all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia (DC), and the estimated number of 
kindergartners with at least one vaccine exemption in 47 states 
and DC, during the 2015–16 school year. Median vaccination 
coverage* was 94.6% for 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella 
vaccine (MMR); 94.2% for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular 
pertussis vaccine (DTaP); and 94.3% for 2 doses of varicella 
vaccine. MMR coverage increased in 32 states during the last 
year, and 22 states reported coverage ≥95% (2). A total of 
45 states and DC had either a grace period allowing students to 
attend school before providing documentation of vaccination 
or provisional enrollment that allows undervaccinated students 
to attend school while completing a catch-up schedule. Among 
the 23 states that were able to voluntarily report state-level data 
on grace period or provisional enrollment to CDC, a median 
of 2.0% of kindergartners were not documented as completely 
vaccinated and were attending school within a grace period 
or were provisionally enrolled. The median percentage of 
kindergartners with an exemption from one or more vaccina-
tions† was 1.9%. State and local immunization programs, in 
cooperation with schools, can improve vaccination coverage 
by ensuring that all kindergartners are vaccinated during the 
grace period or provisional enrollment.
Federally funded immunization programs in 50 states and 
DC partner with departments of education, school nurses, 
and other school personnel to assess vaccination coverage and 
exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kin-
dergartens.§ Eight states reported data for some homeschooled 
kindergartners.¶ During the 2015–16 school year, for the first 
time, 23 states reported data on children who were neither 
fully vaccinated nor exempt, but attending kindergarten under 
a grace period or provisional enrollment. A grace period is a 
set number of days during which a student can be enrolled 
and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or 
exemption. A provisional enrollment allows a student without 
complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while 
completing a catch-up vaccination schedule.
States use a range of data sources to assess vaccination 
coverage, and during the 2015–16 school year, vaccination 
assessments varied by immunization program because of differ-
ences in state mandates, data reported, and available resources. 
Among the 51 programs reporting data, 32 used a census to 
collect kindergarten vaccination data; 10 used a sample; three 
used a voluntary school response; and six used a mix of sam-
pling methods.** Programs used the same methods to collect 
both vaccination coverage and exemption data, except for 
programs in Alaska, Kansas, New Mexico, and Virginia, which 
used a sample to collect vaccination coverage data and a census

* Median vaccination coverage was determined using estimates from the 50 states 
and DC.
† Median exemption rate was determined using estimates from 47 states and DC;
states excluded were Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri. Data from Wyoming
were included in the median for any exemption, but not for medical or
nonmedical exemptions.
§ Assessment date varied by state/area.
 ¶ California included data for independent study students in public school data 
and data for homeschools with six or more students in private school data. 
Minnesota requires vaccination and exemption reporting for homeschooled 
students beginning at age 7 years and reports these data separately from public 
and private school data, although the actual number of homeschooled students 
included in the data was not known. North Carolina included students enrolled 
in virtual academies in public school data. North Dakota reported that some 
public school jurisdictions included homeschooled students in their data. 
Oregon reported some homeschool data separately and children enrolled in 
public online homeschools were included in the public school data. 
Pennsylvania included all homeschooled students in their public school data. 
Utah included students enrolled in public and private online schools. Vermont 
included homeschooled students in their public and private school data if 
they were enrolled in one or more classes in those schools; homeschooled 
children who were exclusively homeschooled were not subject to vaccination 
requirements and were not included in these estimates.
 
** States using a census attempted to collect data from all kindergartners at all 
schools and succeeded with collecting data for ≥90% of students. The type 
of sample employed by the 10 states using a sample for determining coverage 
rates varied, and included a stratified two-stage cluster sample (eight states), 
a stratified one-stage cluster sample (one), and a simple random sample (one). 
A voluntary response of schools was defined as census survey with a response 
rate <90% of the known population of kindergartners. A mix of methods 
included two or more described methods, usually a census for one school type 
and voluntary response for the other.

for exemption data. Six states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Nevada, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) used a sample for 
both vaccination coverage and exemption data. Kindergartners 
were considered up-to-date for a vaccine if they received all 
doses required for school entry,†† except in seven states§§ that 
considered kindergartners up-to-date only if they had received 
all doses of all vaccines required for school entry.
Kindergartners with a history of varicella disease were 
reported as either vaccinated against varicella or medically 
exempt, varying by program. Medical exemptions were those 
that were issued by a health care provider; all other exemptions 
(i.e., religious and philosophic) were nonmedical. Vaccination 
coverage and exemption estimates were adjusted based on 
survey type and response rates.¶¶
During the 2015–16 school year, vaccination coverage 
data were reported for 4,087,187 kindergartners, exemp-
tion data for 3,791,755 kindergartners, and grace period/
provisional enrollment data for 2,173,042 kindergartners.*** 
Among the 50 states and DC, median MMR coverage was 
94.6% (range = 87.1% [Colorado] to 99.4% [Maryland and 
Mississippi]); 22 states reported coverage ≥95%, and three 
states and DC reported coverage <90% (Table 1). Among 
49 states and DC that require DTaP vaccination, median 
coverage was 94.2% (range = 86.6% [Colorado] to 99.6% 
[Maryland]); 20 states reported coverage ≥95%, and four states 
and DC reported coverage <90%. Among 42 states and DC 
that required 2-dose varicella vaccination, median coverage was 
94.3% (range = 85.7% [Colorado] to 99.4% [Mississippi]); 
18 states reported coverage ≥95%, and five states and DC 
reported coverage <90%. The number of states requiring 
2 doses of varicella vaccine for school entry increased from 39 
in 2014–15 to 42 in 2015–16. Median 2-dose varicella cover-
age increased from 93.6% to 94.3%, in part because of high 
coverage in three states that added a requirement for 2 doses of 
varicella vaccine (Montana [93.6%]; North Carolina [97.0%]; 
and Utah [94.8%]) (3).
Since the 2014–15 school year, MMR coverage increased 
in 32 states (2). Compared with 2014–15, among states that 
reported coverage for both 2014–15 and 2015–16, four 
fewer states reported <90% MMR coverage, and five more 
states reported ≥95% MMR coverage in 2015–16 (Figure). 
The median increase was 0.7 percentage points (range = 0.1 
[Wyoming] to 4.1 [Oklahoma]) (2).
Twenty-three††† states voluntarily reported data on grace 
period or provisional enrollment for the 2015–16 school year. 
The median reported percentage of kindergartners attending 
school during a grace period or provisional enrollment was 
2.0% (range = 0.0% [Wyoming] to 5.4% [New Hampshire]) 
(Table 2). In 12 of these 23 states, the percentage of children 
who were provisionally enrolled or within a grace period at 
the time of the assessment exceeded the percentage of children 
with exemptions from one or more vaccines.
Among the 47 states and DC reporting kindergartners with 
at least one exemption, the median was 1.9% (range = <0.1% 
[Mississippi] to 6.3% [Oregon]), an increase of 0.2 percentage 
points from the previous year (Table 2). The percentage of kin-
dergartners with any exemption was <1% in six states, and ≥4% 
in nine states. From the 2014–15 to the 2015–16 school year, 
the exemption rate decreased by >1.0 percentage points in three 
states (Colorado, Michigan, and Wisconsin), and increased 
by >0.5 percentage points in two states (Nevada and North 
Dakota). The number of states with exemption rates ≥4.0% 
decreased from 11 in 2014–15 to nine in 2015–16. Michigan 
reported a 1.7 percentage point decrease in exemptions. Among 
states that reported exemptions by type, the median percent-
age of medical exemptions was 0.2% (range = <0.1% in four 
states [Colorado, Delaware, Mississippi, South Carolina] to 
1.2% [Alaska]), and the median percentage of nonmedical 
exemptions was 1.6% (range = 0.4% [DC] to 6.2% [Oregon]). 
During 2015–16, a total of 25 states§§§ share or plan to share 
 †† All the 50 states and DC required 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine, 
with MMR as the only measles-containing vaccine available in the United 
States. For local DTaP vaccine requirements, Nebraska required 3 doses, 
four states (Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin) required 4 doses, 
Pennsylvania did not require pertussis, and all other states required 5 doses 
unless the fourth dose was administered on or after the fourth birthday. 
Kentucky required 5 doses of DTaP by age 5, but reported 4-dose coverage 
for kindergartners. For varicella vaccine, eight states required 1 dose and 42 
states and DC required 2 doses.
 §§ Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New 
Jersey considered kindergartners up-to-date only if they had received all doses 
of all vaccines required for school entry.
 ¶¶ Most of the programs using a census or voluntary response provided CDC 
with data aggregated at the state level. Coverage and exemption data based 
on a census were adjusted for nonresponse using the inverse of the response 
rate, stratified by school type. Programs using complex sample surveys 
provided CDC with de-identified data aggregated at the school or county 
level for weighted analysis. Weights were calculated to account for sample 
design and adjusted for nonresponse for data collected by complex sample 
design wherever possible.
 *** Immunization programs in U.S. territories reported vaccination coverage 
and exemptions to CDC. Their data were not included in median coverage 
and exemption calculations. Select U.S. cities also reported data to CDC, 
which were included in state-reported data to calculate medians.
 ††† California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, 
Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West 
Virginia, and Wyoming reported data on kindergartners attending school 
under a grace period or provisional enrollment.

Nebraska required 3 doses. Pennsylvania required 4 doses of diphtheria and tetanus vaccine, but pertussis vaccine was not required. Kentucky required ≥5 but 
reported ≥4 doses of DTaP.

local-level data online for vaccination coverage, exemptions, or 
both, which is an increase from 21 states during 2014–15 (3).
Discussion
During the 2015–16 school year, median kindergarten vac-
cination coverage was nearly 95% for MMR (94.6%), DTaP 
(94.2%), and varicella vaccine (94.3%), which was similar to 
the previous school year. MMR coverage increased for 32 states 
from the previous school year. The national median exemption 
rate of 1.9% was a slight increase from the previous school year 
(1.7%), but only two states had an increase >0.5 percentage 
points in their state exemption rate and exemptions varied 
by state. The percentage of kindergartners who did not have 
complete documentation of vaccination, and who attended 
school within a grace period or were provisionally enrolled, 
was as high as 5.4% among the 23 states with data available.
Grace period and provisional enrollment, not collected in 
previous years, might in part explain results from previous 
years indicating that some children were enrolled in school but 
reported neither as vaccinated nor as exempt (3). Immunization 
programs can support and work with schools with high provisional 
enrollment and help students obtain missing vaccine doses. For 
example, the California Health Department worked to improve 
vaccination coverage at schools identified from local-level data as 
having high levels of provisional enrollment. School staff members 
were trained on the proper use of provisional enrollment (4). As 
a result, from 2014–15 to 2015–16, the number of provisionally 
enrolled kindergartners decreased from 36,731 (6.3%) to 24,424 
(4.4%), MMR coverage increased from 92.6% to 94.5%, and 
DTaP coverage increased from 92.4% to 94.2% (4). The decrease 
in the number of provisionally enrolled children in California and 
the increase in MMR and DTaP coverage demonstrates that state 
immunization programs and schools can use provisional enroll-
ment data to boost school vaccination coverage.
The increase in MMR coverage observed among 32 states 
during the 2015–16 school year might be attributable in part 
to the 2015 measles outbreaks, which included a reported total 
of 159 persons from 18 states and DC, of whom approximately 
80% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status 
(5). Maintaining high vaccination coverage levels is important 
for measles control and elimination (6).
A slight increase (0.2 percentage points) in the median 
exemption rate from 2014–15 to 2015–16 is accounted for 
in part by the addition of reports from Texas (1.6%) and 
Wyoming (2.7%), neither of which reported the number of 
children with an exemption from one or more vaccines for the 
2014–15 school year.  The 1.7 percentage point decrease in 
exemptions reported by Michigan might be because of a new 
state rule requiring parents who request exemptions to receive 
health education at a county health department about the risks 
for vaccine-preventable diseases and the benefits of vaccination 
(7). The greatest fluctuations in exemptions occurred among 
states that used samples to collect exemption data. Of the five 
states with an increase of ≥0.5 percentage points or decrease of 
≥1 percentage points in exemptions since the previous school 
year, three (Colorado, Nevada, and Wisconsin) reported data 
from a sample of students. CDC recommends using a census of 
schools to collect exemption data because exemptions are rare 
events that cluster geographically (8). Since the 2011–12 school 
year, five states switched to a census from a sample to collect 
exemption data, increasing representativeness and reliability.
Healthy People 2020 sets a vaccination coverage target of 
95% among kindergartners for the vaccines reported here, as 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Immunization programs conduct annual kindergarten vaccina-
tion assessments to monitor vaccination coverage among 
school children. Although state-level vaccination coverage is 
high and exemptions are low, some children in kindergarten 
remain undervaccinated.
What is added by this report?
Among the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), median 
vaccination coverage was 94.6% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, 
and rubella vaccine (MMR) and 94.2% for local requirements for 
diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine among 
49 states and DC. Among the 42 states and DC with a 2-dose 
varicella vaccine requirement, varicella vaccine coverage was 
94.3%. Thirty-two states reported an increase in 2-dose MMR 
coverage. The median exemption level remained low (1.9%) but 
exemption rates varied by state. In 12 of 23 states that reported 
data on grace period or provisional enrollment for children who 
were not fully vaccinated, the proportion of kindergartners under a 
grace period or provisional enrollment was higher than the 
proportion that were exempt from one or more vaccines.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Routine monitoring of vaccination coverage and exemptions 
among kindergartners at the state level is important to ensure all 
children are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Local-level data on school vaccination coverage, exemptions, and 
grace period/provisional enrollment are essential to help immuni-
zation programs identify schools with higher numbers of students 
who are not completely vaccinated and not exempt. Immunization 
programs and schools can use local level data to work together to 
improve vaccination coverage and protect all kindergartners from 
vaccine-preventable diseases.TABLE 1. Estimated vaccination

and represent kindergartners who are identified by the schools 
as having incomplete vaccination records. The definition of 
kindergartners under a grace period/provisional enrollment 
varied by state, so those estimates might not be comparable.
Kindergarten vaccination requirements provide an oppor-
tunity for children who are behind on early childhood vac-
cinations to be vaccinated by school entry. Thorough school 
vaccination assessments at the state and local levels allow 
immunization programs to identify schools and communities 
where focused action could improve vaccination coverage to 
ensure that more children can benefit from the protection 
offered by vaccines. Local-level data allow programs to identify 
schools with undervaccinated students, and public dissemi-
nation raises awareness of community vaccination coverage. 
Immunization programs can use the data to monitor grace 
period/provisional enrollment levels, in addition to coverage 
and exemptions, and to work with schools with higher grace 
period or provisional enrollment rates to ensure all kinder-
gartners receive recommended vaccinations and are protected 
from vaccine-preventable diseases.

well as for other vaccines.¶¶¶ This report found medians for 
MMR, DTaP
, and varicella vaccine all approach the Healthy 
People 2020 target. A total of 22 states met the Healthy People 
2020 target for vaccination with MMR, 20 states met the 
DTaP vaccination target, and 18 states met the varicella vac-
cination target.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations, which have been previously reported (3). First, 
comparability is limited because of variations in states’ 
requirements. Second, representativeness might be negatively 
affected because of data collection methodologies that miss 
some schools or students or assess vaccination status at dif-
ferent times. Finally, actual vaccination coverage, exemption 
estimates, or both might be under- or overestimated because of 
improper or absent documentation. State-level aggregate grace 
period/provisional enrollment data were reported to CDC by 
states that could easily access the data from reporting schools, 
 ¶¶¶ Healthy People 2020 objective IID-10.1 is 4 doses of DTaP vaccine. This 
report describes compliance with state requirements of 3, 4, or 5 doses of 
DTaP vaccine. Among the 50 states and DC, only Nebraska required and 
reported 3 doses of DTaP vaccine. The IID-10.2 target is ≥95% of 
kindergartners receiving ≥ 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Four states required 
2 doses of measles-containing vaccine but only 1 dose each of mumps and 
rubella vaccine. Four states required 2 doses measles and mumps but only 
1 dose of rubella vaccine. One state required 2 doses of measles and rubella 
and zero doses of mumps. The IID-10.5 target is ≥95% of kindergartners 
receiving ≥2 doses of varicella vaccine. State-level data with Healthy People 
2020 targets are available on SchoolVaxView (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/

† Medical exemptions, nonmedical exemptions, and grace period/provisional enrollment status might not be mutually exclusive. Some children might have both 
medical and nonmedical exemptions, and some enrolled under a grace period/provisional enrollment might be exempt from one or more vaccinations.
 
§ Grace period/provisional enrollment data were collected for the first time in 2015–16. Data were reported voluntarily. A grace period is a set number of days 
during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption. Provisional enrollment allows a student without 
complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In states with one or both of these policies, the estimates 
represent the number of kindergartners within a grace period, provisionally enrolled, or some combination of these categories.
 
¶ Medians calculated from data from 47 states and District of Columbia; states excluded were Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri. Wyoming was included in only the 
Any Exemption median. Houston, New York City, Guam, N. Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands were also excluded.
 ** Exemptions because of philosophic reasons were not allowed.
 †† Exemptions because of religious reasons were not allowed.
 §§ State did not report the number of children with exemptions, but instead reported the number of exemptions for each vaccine, which would count some children 
more than once. Lower bounds of the percentage of children with any exemptions, estimated using the individual vaccines with the highest number of exemptions 
are the following: for Illinois, 0.2% with medical exemptions, 1.1% with religious exemptions, and 1.4% for any exemptions; for Minnesota, 0.2% with medical 
exemptions, 3.1% with nonmedical exemptions, and 3.4% for any exemptions; for Missouri 0.2% with medical exemptions, 1.7% with religious exemptions, and 
1.8% for any exemptions; and for Wyoming, 0.2% with medical exemptions and 2.2% with religious exemptions.
 ¶¶ Religious and philosophic exemptions were not reported separately.
