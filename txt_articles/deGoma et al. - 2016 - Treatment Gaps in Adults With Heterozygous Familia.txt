eterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (from here on 
designated FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by ele-
vated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a mark-
edly elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), and a 50% chance of inheritance among offspring.1 
Recent epidemiological2,3 and genetic studies4,5 support a 
prevalence of FH of ≈1 in 200 in the general community; if 
these prevalence figures hold true for the US population, as 
Background—Cardiovascular disease burden and treatment patterns among patients with familial hypercholesterolemia 
(FH) in the United States remain poorly described. In 2013, the FH Foundation launched the Cascade Screening for 
Awareness and Detection (CASCADE) of FH Registry to address this knowledge gap.
Methods and Results—We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1295 adults with heterozygous FH enrolled in the 
CASCADE-FH Registry from 11 US lipid clinics. Median age at initiation of lipid-lowering therapy was 39 years, and 
median age at FH diagnosis was 47 years. Prevalent coronary heart disease was reported in 36% of patients, and 61% 
exhibited 1 or more modifiable risk factors. Median untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 239 
mg/dL. At enrollment, median LDL-C was 141 mg/dL; 42% of patients were taking high-intensity statin therapy and 
45% received >1 LDL-lowering medication. Among FH patients receiving LDL-lowering medication(s), 25% achieved 
an LDL-C <100 mg/dL and 41% achieved a ≥50% LDL-C reduction. Factors associated with prevalent coronary heart 
disease included diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.08–2.82) and hypertension (2.48; 
1.92–3.21). Factors associated with a ≥50% LDL-C reduction from untreated levels included high-intensity statin use 
(7.33; 1.86–28.86) and use of >1 LDL-lowering medication (1.80; 1.34–2.41).
Conclusions—FH patients in the CASCADE-FH Registry are diagnosed late in life and often do not achieve adequate 
LDL-C lowering, despite a high prevalence of coronary heart disease and risk factors. These findings highlight the need 
for earlier diagnosis of FH and initiation of lipid-lowering therapy, more consistent use of guideline-recommended LDL-
lowering therapy, and comprehensive management of traditional coronary heart disease risk factors.  (Circ Cardiovasc

many as 1.5 million Americans may have FH, a substantially 
higher figure than suggested by earlier estimates.6 Despite 
data confirming that prompt detection and treatment of FH 
reduces the risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) 
and death,7 the majority of FH patients worldwide remain 
unidentified,3 and, of those diagnosed, most fail to receive 
appropriate treatment.2
Several mandates have been issued to address the vast 
detection and treatment gaps in FH.3,8 The 2013 American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/
AHA) cholesterol guidelines highlighted individuals with an 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL as the first of 3 key patient groups for 
whom statin initiation is recommended for primary prevention 
and the only primary prevention population for whom high-
intensity statin therapy is universally recommended.9Countries, 
including the Netherlands10 and the United Kingdom,11 have 
instituted nationwide programs to identify, treat, or track indi-
viduals with FH. In the United States, the landmark Make 
Early Diagnoses—Prevent Early Deaths (MEDPED) registry, 
active from 1989 to 2004, established LDL-C thresholds for 
the diagnosis of FH and elucidated risk factors for CHD in FH 
patients.12,13 However, the registry no longer remains active, 
and contemporary diagnostic and treatment patterns, comor-
bidities, and cardiovascular disease status of FH patients in 
the United States remain poorly described, which has been 
highlighted as a major research gap in a scientific statement 
from the American Heart Association.14 To characterize the 
contemporary features and treatment of FH patients in the 
United States, the FH Foundation15—a nonprofit research 
and advocacy organization—launched the Cascade Screening 
for Awareness and Detection (CASCADE) FH Registry, a 
national initiative to increase FH awareness, characterize 
trends in treatment, and monitor clinical and patient-reported 
outcomes.16 Here, we aim to describe the characteristics 
and treatment patterns of adult FH patients enrolled in the 
CASCADE-FH Registry.
Methods
Study Design
The current analysis focused on adult FH patients enrolled at partici-
pating clinical sites in the CASCADE-FH Registry.16 To be includ-
ed in CASCADE-FH, all patients must have had at least one office 
visit at a participating lipid clinic within the past 5 years with FH 
diagnosed based on existing clinical or genetic diagnostic methods.16 
Briefly, diagnostic criteria included—but were not limited to—Simon 
Broome, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, and MEDPED. No single di-
agnostic method was required, largely because no consensus diag-
nostic criteria exist in the United States. Exclusion criteria included 
any secondary cause of hypercholesterolemia (eg, hypothyroidism, 
nephrotic syndrome, and cholestasis).14
After excluding patients below 18 years (n=202), with homozy-
gous FH (n=43, defined as a clinical or genetic diagnosis of homo-
zygous FH, untreated LDL-C >500 mg/dL, or use of mipomersen 
or lomitapide), and with missing statin dosage information (n=25), 
we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1295 adult FH patients 
who were enrolled in the CASCADE-FH Registry prospectively 
through 11 participating lipid clinics between September 2013 and 
April 2015 (n=436) or for whom retrospective data were abstracted 
by reviewing historical medical charts (n=859; Figure in the Data 
Supplement).16 Institutional review boards at each site reviewed 
and approved the protocol. Signed informed consent was required 
for all prospectively enrolled patients, and a waiver was approved 
for retrospective data abstraction. CHD was defined as any prior 
diagnosis of CHD, including myocardial infarction (MI) or coro-
nary revascularization. ASCVD was defined as any prior diagnosis 
of CHD, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery dis-
ease. Clinical and laboratory data including diagnoses of CHD or 
ASCVD were abstracted from patient medical records and entered 
by trained research staff.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of the study population are presented as frequencies 
and percentages for categorical variables and median (interquartile 
range) for continuous variables. We defined untreated total choles-
terol and LDL-C levels as the highest documented values before ini-
tiation of drug therapy or occasionally when a patient was on a drug 
holiday. Treated lipid levels were defined as the most recent values 
available at the time of inclusion into the CASCADE-FH Registry 
among patients on LDL-lowering medication(s). Entry lipid levels 
were defined as the most recent values available at the time of inclu-
sion into the CASCADE-FH Registry, regardless of treatment sta-
tus. We evaluated the association between patient characteristics and 
prevalent CHD abstracted at baseline in a multivariable logistic re-
gression model with generalized estimating equations to account for 
site variation, adjusting for age, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, 
hypertension, untreated total cholesterol, and low high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women). 
We compared the use of high-intensity and low- or moderate-intensity 
statin therapy, as well as each individual statin therapy used at base-
line, the number of lipid-lowering therapies used, and treatment with 
lipoprotein apheresis, stratified by statin use groups using Chi-square 
tests. We evaluated the association between patient characteristics 
and LDL-C goal attainment in 2 separate logistic regression models 
with generalized estimating equations to account for site variation, 
where goal attainment is defined as treated LDL-C <100 mg/dL or 
a ≥50% reduction compared with untreated LDL-C.3,8,17 Patients not 
taking LDL-lowering drug therapy were excluded from both analy-
ses of LDL-C goal attainment; in addition, patients without data on 
untreated LDL-C were also excluded from models of goal attainment 
based on a ≥50% reduction in LDL-C. Multivariable models were 
adjusted for all covariates with P<0.05 in unadjusted models. Odds 
ratios for age at enrollment and untreated LDL-C were modeled per 
10-year and 10-mg/dL increase, respectively; all other factors were 
modeled as binary variables.
Results
Demographics, clinical, and lipid/lipoprotein characteristics 
of the cohort are shown in Table 1 and Table I in the Data 
Supplement. The median age at enrollment was 57 years; 59% 
were female; and 80% were white. With regard to FH diag-
nosis, formal diagnostic criteria (ie, Dutch Lipid Clinic Net-
work, Simon Broome, or MEDPED criteria) were reported in 
43% of cases; 3% of all cases had genetic confirmation; and 
the remainder of patients were diagnosed without the use of 
formal diagnostic criteria or genetic confirmation (clinically 
diagnosed). Tendon xanthoma was reported among 19% of 
cases. Median ages at the times of initiation of lipid-lower-
ing therapy and the specific diagnosis of FH were 39 and 47 
years, respectively. Initiation of lipid-lowering therapy and 
FH diagnosis occurred before age 30 years in 17% and 22% 
of patients, respectively. Median untreated and treated LDL-C 
levels were 239 and 134 mg/dL, respectively.
Sixty-one percent of study participants had at least 1 
additional modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, defined as 
diabetes mellitus, current smoking, hypertension, or low high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (below 40 mg/dL for men and 
below 50 mg/dL for women; Table 1). Twenty-three percent

 242  Circ Cardiovasc Genet  June 2016
of patients had ≥2 additional modifiable risk factors. A family 
history of premature MI was observed in 45%.
Prevalent ASCVD was reported in 38% of patients at 
entry (Table 1). The predominant ASCVD diagnosis was 
CHD, which was reported in 36% of patients (Table II in the 
Data Supplement). CHD was reported among 47% of men, 
with a median age of onset of 47 years, and among 29% of 
women, with a median age of onset of 55 years. In multivari-
ate analysis, older age, male sex, family history of premature 
MI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and untreated total cho-
lesterol were associated with increased odds of CHD at entry 
(Table 2).
Treatment patterns of the overall cohort are detailed 
in Table 3. High-intensity and low- or moderate- intensity 
statin use (as defined by the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol 
guidelines9) were reported among 42% and 33% of patients, 
respectively. Among the 25% of patients not receiving statin 
treatment, reasons for the lack of statin use included intoler-
ance or allergy (60%), patient preference (11%), physician 
preference (11%), pregnancy (3%), cost (1%), and clinical 
trial participation (1%). Lipoprotein apheresis was used in 6% 
of adults with FH and was more commonly used in patients 
not treated with statin therapy. Use of >1 lipid-lowering medi-
cation was reported in 45% of patients.
Distributions of treated LDL-C levels among 1084 patients 
on lipid-lowering medications and the associated LDL-C 
reductions from untreated values are shown in Table 4 and 
Figures 1 and 2. Twenty-five percent of patients had treated 
LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and 41% of patients achieved a ≥50% 
LDL-C reduction from untreated values. Older age, high-
intensity statin therapy, and use of >1 LDL-lowering medi-
cation were associated with achieving a treated LDL-C <100 
mg/dL (Table 5). Among 652 patients who were taking LDL-
lowering medications and for whom untreated and treated 
LDL-C levels were available, older age, family history of 
premature MI, higher untreated LDL-C, high-intensity statin 
therapy, and use of >1 lipid-lowering medication were associ-
ated with achieving a ≥50% reduction in LDL-C (Table 6).
Discussion
Among adult FH patients enrolled in the US CASCADE-FH 
Registry, the prevalence of CHD was 47% in men and 30% 
in women, which is 5 to 7 times higher than the age-matched 
general US population.18 LDL-C goal attainment, defined as a 
treated LDL-C <100 mg/dL or a ≥50% LDL-C reduction, was 
poor, and achievement of the more aggressive goal of LDL-C 
<70 mg/dL was minimal. Our cross-sectional analysis also 
demonstrated late initiation of lipid-lowering therapy, delayed 
diagnosis of FH, limited use of high-intensity statin therapy 
and combination LDL-lowering therapy, and a substantial 
burden of traditional modifiable risk factors. Underdiagnosis 
and undertreatment of FH, which lead to missed opportunities 
to reduce early-onset cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
have been highlighted by recent reviews15 and guidelines,1,3,8,17 
including the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines9 and the 
AHA Scientific Statement on FH.14 Unfortunately, limited 
data have been available to determine whether FH patients 
in the United States are currently being identified and treated 
appropriately. Our analysis of data from the CASCADE-FH

 deGoma et al  Adult Heterozygous FH Patients in the US  243
Registry provides the initial characterization of a large and 
contemporary cohort of adult patients with a clinical diagno-
sis of FH enrolled at 11 sites across the United States. These 
data quantify gaps in care and identify potential next steps to 
improve the management of FH patients.
Our findings are consistent with prevalence rates of CHD 
in FH observed in other countries2,19 and historical US FH 
cohorts12,20 (Tables III and IV in the Data Supplement). In 
1974, Stone et al reported CHD in 30% of 289 FH patients 
followed at the National Institutes of Health.20 In an analy-
sis of the MEDPED registry published in 2001, early-onset 
CHD was observed in 26% of 262 FH patients.12 The median 
ages of onset of CHD among men and women enrolled in the 
CASCADE-FH registry were 47 and 55 years, respectively, 
compared with a mean age of 42 and 62 years in the aforemen-
tioned 1974 National Institutes of Health study,20 and early-
onset CHD, defined as onset before age 55 in men and before 
65 in women, still occurred in 36% of men and 12% of women 
in the CASCADE-FH Registry.
Our study reaffirms the importance of traditional modifi-
able cardiovascular risk factors in adults with FH. At least one 
additional modifiable cardiovascular risk factor was identi-
fied in 61% of study participants (Table 1). Diabetes mellitus 
and hypertension were each significantly associated with the 
presence of CHD in multivariate analyses (Table 2). These 
findings are largely consistent with previous studies (Table 
V in the Data Supplement)12,21,22 and reinforce the importance 
of comprehensive preventive care to minimize cardiovascular 
risk in FH.
Given the inherited nature of FH and the fact that athero-
sclerotic risk parallels cumulative exposure to LDL-C levels, 
it is striking that both the diagnosis of FH and the initiation 
of lipid-lowering therapy in adult FH patients enrolled in 
the CASCADE-FH Registry occurred late in life, at median 
ages of 47 and 39 years, respectively. The discrepancy in 
these ages indicates that recognition of hypercholesterol-
emia—prompting initiation of drug therapy—frequently 
preceded the specific diagnosis of FH. Perhaps contribut-
ing to these issues, we identified a lack of uniformity in 
the use of diagnostic strategies among US physicians. A 
need exists for consensus formal diagnostic criteria for FH 
patients in the United States. In contrast to some European 
countries, such as the Netherlands, where national programs 
that include genetic screening and counseling have led to a 
high frequency of therapy early in life, only 3% of patients 
had genetic diagnostic testing in this cohort of academic 
lipid clinics. The lack of genetic testing means we cannot 
exclude the possibility that the CASCADE-FH population

contains some individuals with polygenic hypercholester-
olemia. More importantly, this reflects the fact that genetic 
testing remains underused in the United States, with no 
consensus on standard of care and variable reimbursement 
policies from payers. Recent guidelines from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics,22a National Lipid Association,1,8 
European Atherosclerosis Society,3,23 and the International 
FH Foundation17 recommend assessment for FH beginning 
at 5 to 10 years and in the US universal screening of cho-
lesterol levels by ages 9 to 11 years and age 2 years for 
children of parents with FH or a strong family history of 
premature CHD. This guidance is based on the good dis-
criminatory ability of lipid testing to correctly classify FH 
in children, which is attenuated with age.24
Recommendations for lipid testing in family members of 
patients with premature CHD have existed since 1992,25 for 
universal screening of lipids beginning at age 20 years since 
1988,26 and universal screening at age 9 to 11 years since 
2011.27 The 2013 ACC/AHA adult cholesterol guidelines 
provided a class IB recommendation for statin initiation for 
patients aged ≥21 years with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.9 All statins 
are FDA-approved for treatment of children with FH begin-
ning at the age of 8 years for pravastatin and 10 years for other 
statins. Pediatric statin trials demonstrate excellent safety and 
efficacy with follow-up of 2 years.28
Even with appropriate diagnosis of FH and initiation 
of LDL-lowering therapy, a minority of treated adult FH 
patients in the CASCADE-FH Registry achieved guideline-
based goals of an LDL-C <100 mg/dL (25%) or a ≥50% 
reduction in LDL-C (41%). The magnitude of this treatment 
gap is similar to those observed in recent studies reported 
from France,29 the Netherlands,30 Spain,31 and the United 
Kingdom32 (Table IV in the Data Supplement). Two of the 
most potent predictors of LDL-C goal attainment were use 
of high-intensity statin therapy and use of >1 LDL-lowering 
medication, the latter previously identified in a study by 
Mata et al (Table VI in the Data Supplement).12,21,31 At the 
time of CASCADE-FH registry enrollment, fewer than 
half of the patients in our study were taking either a high-
intensity statin or combination therapy, suggesting that these

2 interventions may represent readily available means to 
improve success achieving LDL-C targets, although patient 
tolerance is a limiting factor in some cases.
Elements of family history are incorporated into most 
diagnostic criteria for FH, and guidelines recommend com-
pleting a 4-generation pedigree for all FH patients.1,3,8 In our 
study, a family history of premature MI was reported in only 
45% of adult FH patients. Several reasons may account for 
the low reported family history of early-onset CHD. First, 
the CASCADE-FH Registry restricted the definition of pre-
mature CHD to early-onset MI, similar to the Simon Broome 
criteria, excluding other forms of clinical CHD, such as cor-
onary revascularization and angina. Second, data pertaining 
to family history of premature MI was unknown for 28% of 
study participants. Whether this gap is present because of 
patients’ lack of knowledge or a failure on behalf of health-
care providers to elicit and accurately record this informa-
tion remains uncertain. Third, the availability of statins 
over the past 3 decades likely improved the cardiovascular 
health of more than a generation of FH patients, attenuating 
the value of a family history of premature CHD in diagnos-
ing FH. These limitations notwithstanding, in our study, a 
family history of premature MI was significantly associated 
with prevalent CHD and achievement of a ≥50% LDL-C 
reduction.
In the CASCADE-FH Registry, the prevalence of diabe-
tes mellitus was 13%, similar to the prevalence estimate of 
12% reported for an age-matched general US population.33 
In contrast, a recent cross-sectional analysis performed in 
the Netherlands reported a significantly lower prevalence of 
diabetes mellitus among patients with genetically confirmed 
FH compared with unaffected relatives, with an adjusted odds 
ratio of 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.41–0.58).34 Several 
factors may explain this discrepancy. One explanation for this 
may be because of a referral bias to specialty lipid clinic of 
complex patients with FH and diabetes mellitus. Alternatively, 
findings from the Dutch cohort suggesting that FH patients 
may be less prone to the development of diabetes mellitus 
may not be generalizable to the US population. The greater 
body mass index (27.3 versus 23.5 kg/m2), higher prevalence 
of non-white populations (20% versus a small minority), and 
older age (57 versus 38 years) represent important risk fac-
tors for the development of diabetes mellitus that differentiate 
the US CASCADE-FH Registry study participants from the 
Dutch cohort. Third, the putative diabetogenic effect of statin 
therapy may have an influence.
To date, the role of genetic testing in FH—above and 
beyond phenotypic characterization through clinical history, 
physical examination, and LDL-C levels—remains debated. 
In the United States, genetic testing is rarely performed in rou-
tine clinical care, and insurance coverage is highly variable. 
Preliminary evidence largely derived from screening pro-
grams in the Netherlands35 and the United Kingdom36 suggests 
that a comprehensive approach to FH inclusive of genetic test-
ing facilitates diagnosis, improves treatment, and enhances 
cascade screening. Based on these data, national guidelines 
from the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands sup-
port genetic testing for FH. On the contrary, recommendations 
for genetic testing are absent from recent guidelines provided

by the European Society of Cardiology and the US National 
Lipid Association. Importantly, there is a notable lack of data 
regarding the downstream outcome of genetic testing for FH 
in US populations, where different healthcare delivery sys-
tems, patient and provider attitudes, and mutation heterogene-
ity may affect the success of genetic testing. To better answer 
the question regarding the clinical utility of genetic testing in 
FH in the United States, a randomized trial is currently under-
way comparing genetic testing and cholesterol testing alone.37 
End points include effects on cascade screening, LDL control, 
lipid-lowering therapy, and downstream costs.
Limitations
Our analysis of the diagnosis, management, and outcomes 
of adult FH patients from 11 lipid specialty centers may not 
be generalizable to the broader US FH population. To our 
knowledge, the only published study to examine FH patients 
in a community setting is a 2012 Danish analysis of 502 FH 
patients identified from the large Copenhagen General Popu-
lation Study.2 Despite similar median untreated lipid levels, 
mean ages, and prevalence rates of CHD (Table II in the Data 
Supplement), the Danish cohort exhibited higher on-treatment 
LDL-C levels compared with the CASCADE-FH Registry 
(182 versus 134 mg/dL). This suggests that our findings, 
restricted to experienced lipid clinics, may well underestimate 
the existing treatment gap in the United States. Increasing the 
number of institutions participating in the CASCADE-FH 
Registry (as of August 2015, 17 sites are actively enrolling) 
along with efforts to leverage large electronic health data-
bases to identify patients with FH will yield more general-
izable results. The latter approach, which includes the FH 
Foundation’s Flag, Identify, Network, Deliver (FIND) FH 
initiative and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics 
(eMERGE) Network, may help identify a larger number and 
more diverse cohort of FH patients.
Although our study identified suboptimal use of high-
intensity statin or combination therapy, the reasons for not 
pursuing these treatments, particularly in younger individu-
als, remain uncertain. Despite universal recommendations for 
statin therapy in adult FH patients,1,3,8,17 1 out of 4 patients in 
our study were not taking statins at the time of registry enroll-
ment, largely because of statin intolerance. The high propor-
tion of statin nonusers in the CASCADE-FH Registry may 
reflect referral bias to participating specialty lipid centers, 
where patients who are intolerant to statins and other lipid-
lowering therapies are more likely to be referred.
Data regarding medication adherence, clinic follow-up, 
and reasons for limited use of high-intensity statin therapy 
or combination lipid-lowering therapy are not available at 
this time. The CASCADE-FH Registry will add information 
regarding intolerance to lipid-lowering therapy and incorpo-
rate several measures of patient-reported medication adher-
ence during follow-up data collection. In addition, the registry

will monitor changes in medication use over time, including 
switching and discontinuation of lipid-lowering therapy.
Because of the cross-sectional nature of our data, associa-
tions between various characteristics and prevalent CHD or 
LDL-C goal attainment are hypothesis-generating and do not 
establish causality. Despite the high prevalence of CHD at base-
line, our data may in fact underestimate the burden of CHD 
among adults with FH because of survival bias. The lack of an 
association between CHD and cholesterol years may reflect our 
reliance on patient self-report to document life-long LDL-C 
levels, and so this result must be interpreted with caution.
Finally, we cannot rule out the inclusion of phenocopies, 
such as familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial polygenic 
hypercholesterolemia. Additional analysis of patients diag-
nosed using existing clinical criteria and via genetic testing will 
be instructive in this regard. Of note, triglyceride levels were 
not particularly elevated, arguing against the inclusion of a large 
number of patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia. 
Nongenetic factors that may be causing elevations in LDL-C 
include age, postmenopausal status, diet, and obesity. For exam-
ple, diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol may 
cluster in families and incorrectly suggest inheritance. Of note, 
such patients are also at increased risk of premature CHD and 
are, therefore, indicated for aggressive lipid-lowering therapy.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional analysis of the FH Foundation’s multi-
center CASCADE-FH Registry provides the initial character-
ization of contemporary diagnostic and treatment patterns and 
current cardiovascular disease and risk factor burden among a 
large cohort of adult FH patients in the United States. The prev-
alence of CHD was high, and LDL-C goal attainment, defined 
as a treated LDL-C <100 mg/dL or a ≥50% LDL-C reduction, 
was low. Early diagnosis of FH and initiation of lipid-lowering 
therapy, use of high-intensity statin therapy and combination of 
LDL-lowering therapy, comprehensive management of tradi-
tional modifiable risk factors, and careful elicitation of a family 
history of premature CHD are suggested as opportunities to 
improve the care of FH patients and may represent an area that 
would benefit from the investigation of whether performance 
indices would improve care. Follow-up of CASCADE-FH 
Registry study participants is ongoing to prospectively exam-
ine treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
This cross-sectional analysis provides the initial characterization of contemporary diagnostic and treatment patterns and 
current cardiovascular disease and risk factor burden among 1295 adult heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(FH) patients in the United States from the FH Foundation’s multicenter Cascade Screening for Awareness and Detection 
(CASCADE)-FH Registry. The prevalence of coronary heart disease was high (36%) in FH patients, which is 5 to 7 times 
higher than the age-matched general population. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment, defined as a treated 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100 mg/dL or a ≥50% low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction, was low (25% and 
41%, respectively). The presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension in FH patients were associated with significantly 
increased risk of coronary heart disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.74 and 2.48, respectively). Early diagnosis of FH and initiation 
of lipid-lowering therapy, use of high-intensity statin therapy and combination low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy, 
comprehensive management of traditional modifiable risk factors, and careful elicitation of a family history of premature 
coronary heart disease are suggested as opportunities to improve the care of FH patients and may represent an area that 
would benefit by the investigation of whether performance indices would improve care.
