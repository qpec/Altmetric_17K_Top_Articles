Background: Sedentary behavior is associated with health risks in adults. The potential benefits 
of reducing sedentary time may be dependent not only on decrease per se, but also on the type 
of activity it replaces. Few longitudinal studies have investigated the effects on mortality when 
replacing objectively assessed sedentary time with another physical activity (PA) behavior. 
Objective: To investigate the effects of replacing objectively assessed sedentary time with time 
in light-intensity PA or moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) mortality or cancer mortality in a cohort with 15 years follow-up time.
Methods: In total, 851 women and men from the population-based Sweden Attitude Behaviour 
and Change study were included. Time spent sedentary, in light-intensity PA and in MVPA were 
assessed using an Actigraph 7164 accelerometer. Mortality data were obtained from Swedish 
registers. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HR) of mortality with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) and isotemporal substitution models were used to estimate the effect 
of replacing sedentary behavior with PA for the same amount of time.
Results: Over a follow-up of 14.2 years (SD 1.9) with 12,117 person-years at risk, 79 deaths 
occurred, 24 deaths from CVD, 27 from cancer, and 28 from other causes. Replacing 30 min-
utes/day of sedentary time with light-intensity PA was associated with significant reduction 
in all-cause mortality risk (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.98) and CVD mortality risk (HR: 0.76, 
95% CI: 0.63-0.92). Replacing 10 minutes of sedentary time with MVPA was associated with 
reduction in CVD mortality risk (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42-0.91). No statistically significant 
reductions were found for cancer mortality.
Conclusion: This statistical modelling study suggests that replacing sedentary time with 
light-intensity PA could have beneficial effect on both all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. 
Replacing sedentary time with MVPA could reduce CVD mortality.

Introduction
There is a growing body of evidence that sedentary behavior is associated with a mul-
titude of serious health risks in adults.1,2 Studies have found that excessive amounts of 
time spent sedentarily is a risk factor for mortality, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer.1–5 Sedentary behavior is defined as any 
waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 metabolic equivalent 
of task while in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture.6 It has been shown that mortality 
risk increases above 7.5 hours/day of sedentary time, with high risk above 10 hours.3,7 
In a previous study, we found that individuals who spent 10 hours/day sedentarily

had >2.5 times higher risk of death compared to those who 
spent 6.5 hours/day sedentarily.8 Evidence is inconclusive 
whether the increased mortality risk is independent of time 
in moderate–vigorous PA (MVPA),2,4,9,10 and there is a need 
for research that can contribute to differentiating the effects 
of low PA levels from being sedentary per se. The average 
amount of daily time spent in light-intensity PA (1.6–2.9 
metabolic equivalent of task), such as activities of everyday 
living, is about the same as time spent in sedentary behav-
iors.11 This suggests huge potential for replacing time spent 
in sedentary activities with light-intensity PA.
Most longitudinal studies that have found sedentary 
behavior to be a risk factor for early death have used self-
reported data,2,12 subject to low accuracy due to recall bias 
or social desirability.13,14 These limitations can be overcome 
by the use of new technology, such as wearable activity 
monitors, providing objective assessment of sedentary time 
and PA with considerable precision. However, the literature 
is still limited regarding objectively assessed sedentary time 
and mortality in general, and very few longitudinal studies to 
date have studied the effects on mortality when replacing one 
PA behavior with another.15,16 Because total time in a day is 
finite, sedentary time, light-intensity PA, and MVPA are inter-
dependent, and a decrease in time spent in one PA intensity 
means increased time spent in another. The potential benefits 
of reducing sedentary time may thus be dependent not only 
on decrease per se but also on the type of activity it replaces. 
These effects can be explored by isotemporal substitution 
modeling, originally developed from nutritional epidemiol-
ogy and recently introduced in PA research.17 This statistical 
approach offers more specific insights into the association 
of different time-dependent activity classes with mortality 
compared to traditional nonsubstitutional approaches. In 
this study, we used data from a Swedish longitudinal cohort 
study with 15 years of follow-up to investigate the theoreti-
cal consequences of replacing sedentary time with the same 
duration of light-intensity PA or with MVPA on all-cause 
mortality, CVD mortality, and cancer mortality.
Materials and methods
Data collection
This study used data from the Sweden Attitude Behaviour 
and Change (ABC) study of 2001–2002, a nationally rep-
resentative sample of Swedish adults aged 18–75 years. In 
total, 3,300 (52% women) people were contacted, 2,262 (54% 
women) were eligible, and 1,221 (55% women) provided 
objective PA data.18,19 For the present study, we included 
those 851 persons (56% women) who were ≥50 years at 
follow-up in 2015. The ABC data collected in 2001–2002 
were  
combined with register data of mortality of 2002–2015 
collected from the National Board of Health and Welfare’s 
Cause of Death Register and the Swedish Cancer Registry in 
2016. The Cause of Death Register contains both cause-of-
death data and underlying causes of death coded according to 
the international version of the disease classification ICD10.
Sedentary time and PA
Sedentary time and PA were assessed with the uniaxial 
ActiGraph (Pensacola, FL, USA) 7164 accelerometer. The 
ActiGraph is a small, lightweight electronic device captur-
ing time-varying acceleration in the vertical axis specified 
in an arbitrary unit named counts that can be translated to 
intensity and duration of PA. The sampling was set at counts 
per minute. The accelerometers were mailed together with a 
questionnaire and instructions to wear the accelerometer on 
the lower back, using an accompanying elastic belt, for seven 
consecutive days except during sleep and water-based activi-
ties, and then to return the accelerometer by prepaid mail.
Nonwearing time was defined as an interval of at least 60 
consecutive minutes of zero counts, with allowance for up to 
2 minutes of 1–100 counts.20 Participants providing at least 
one valid day of accelerometer data defined as >10 hours of 
wearing time were included.13,18 Cutoff points to estimate 
the time spent sedentarily and in different PA intensities 
were defined in accordance with previous population-based 
studies: sedentary time was defined as <100 counts/minute, 
light-intensity PA as 100–2,019 counts/minute, and MVPA 
as ≥2,020 counts/minute.4,13,21 The amount of time spent in 
vigorous activities was too small to analyze separately.18
Covariates
Demographic and anthropometric data were self-reported 
and obtained from a baseline questionnaire delivered by 
mail.18 Covariates included in this study were age (years, 
continuous), sex, body mass index (BMI) calculated from 
reported height and weight, smoking status (never/former 
or current), history of chronic disease – hypertension, 
heart disease, diabetes, or cancer (yes/no) – and education 
(less than high school, high school/equivalent diploma, or 
university degree). The study was approved by the regional 
ethical review board at the Karolinska Institutet (Dnr 378/02, 
2012/707 31/1, 2015 1578/32).
Statistical analyses
Cox proportional-hazard models were applied to estimate 
HRs of mortality with 95% CIs. Follow-up extended from the 
first day of accelerometer assessment until the date of death 
or censoring on December 31, 2015, whichever occurred

Mortality after 15 years: isotemporal models of PA and sedentary time
first. All covariates were examined for potential confound-
ing or interaction by performing separate statistical tests 
for each covariate. Schönfeld residuals were examined to 
assess proportional-hazard assumption.22 Final models were 
stratified for sex and age tertiles, since these variables did not 
meet the proportional-hazard assumption, and included the 
covariates; education, smoking status, and chronic disease.
Isotemporal substitution models were used to investigate 
the theoretical consequences of replacing one PA behavior 
with another PA behavior for the same amount of time. This 
method allows the interdependence of daily activities of 
different intensity to be taken into account. We recalculated 
the PA variables from continuous 1-minute variables to 10- 
and 30-minute variables. This way, we were able to estimate 
the consequences of replacing both a 10-minute bout and a 
30 minute bout of sedentary time with light-intensity PA or 
MVPA, respectively. Light-intensity PA and MVPA were 
entered into the models simultaneously, along with a total 
accelerometer-wearing time variable and covariates, but 
excluding sedentary time. By including the total accelerome-
ter-wearing time variable in the model, time was isotemporal, 
and the HR for light-intensity PA and MVPA reflected the 
effect of substituting a bout of sedentary time with an equal 
time bout of the specific PA variable. The isotemporal mod-
eling of PA was first described by Mekary et al.17 P-values 
≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical 
analyses were computed in Stata version 11.0 (StataCorp 
LP
, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Descriptive statistics of the total study population and strati-
fied by tertiles of sedentary time are shown in Table 1. The 
average age at follow-up was 66.7 (SD 10.2) years, range 
50–89 years. The major part of daily activities was sedentary 
time, ranging 3–13 hours per day with an average of 8 hours 
12 minutes per day for the total sample. The average time 
spent in light-intensity PA was 5 hours 44 minutes per day, 
and 31 minutes per day in MVPA. Over a follow-up of 14.2 
(SD 1.9) years with 12,117 person-years at risk, 79 deaths 
(32 women, 47 men) occurred: 24 deaths from CVD, 27 
from cancer, and 28 from other causes (Table 2). The crude, 
unweighted death rate was 0.65 per 100 person-years. No 
deaths occurred within the first year from inclusion, and no 
deaths were coded as accidental.
Figure 1 shows the theoretical consequences of replac-
ing sedentary time in 10- and 30-minute bouts with an 
equal amount of light-intensity PA or MVPA. Isotemporal 
substitution analyses with fully adjusted models indicated 
11% and 24% lower risk of all-cause mortality and CVD 
mortality, respectively, when 30 minutes/day of sedentary

time was replaced with an equal amount of light-intensity 
PA. For cancer mortality, the risk reduction of replacing 30 
minutes of sedentary time with light-intensity PA was 14% 
(P=0.059). Replacing sedentary time with MVPA resulted 
in survival advantages for CVD mortality. Risk reductions 
were 38% for replacing 10 minutes/day and 77% for replac-
ing 30 minutes/day. No statistically significant reductions 
in all-cause or cancer mortality were found when sedentary 
time was replaced with MVPA.
Discussion
We used isotemporal substitution models to estimate mor-
tality risk after 15 years in the ABC study sample, the first 
national population-based study collecting objectively 
assessed sedentary time and PA. Our findings suggest that 
if sedentary time is replaced with light-intensity PA, the 
risk of mortality from any cause, as well as from CVD, is 
reduced. Replacing sedentary time with MVPA decreased 
the risk of mortality from CVD. No survival benefits were 
found for mortality from cancer, although the results from 
replacing sedentary time with light-intensity PA were close 
to statistical significance.
The advantage of the isotemporal model is that it allows 
the comparison of substitution of a fixed time of one PA 
behavior for the same time engaged in another PA behavior. 
This analysis method can help to answer the public health 
question of how to spend our discretionary time for health. 
To the best of our knowledge, to date only three previous 
studies15,16,23 have investigated mortality risks of objectively 
assessed sedentary time using isotemporal substitution. All 
of them analyzed data from the US National Health and 
Nutrition  
Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2003–2004 and 
2005–2006, with a mean follow-up of 6.35–6.6 years.15,16,23 
The results from these past studies showed 14%–20% risk 
reductions in all-cause mortality if 30 minutes/day of sed-
entary behavior was replaced with light-intensity PA15,23 or 
18% lower risk if 60 minutes/day was replaced.16 The risk 
reduction in our sample was slightly lower, but overall these 
results provide consistent evidence that light-intensity PA 
may be more beneficial for health than previously known. 
Therefore, the effect of substituting sedentary time with 
light-intensity PA can be substantial and clinically relevant 
if the amount of time exchanged is sufficient.
In contrast to the results from the NHANES cohort15,16,23 
and contrary to our expectations, we did not find statisti-
cally significant risk reductions for all-cause mortality from 
substituting sedentary time with MVPA, although for CVD-
mortality risk the survival benefits were large if sedentary 
time was replaced by MVPA. A daily increase of 10 minutes 
of MVPA, equivalent to approximately half the recommended

Mortality after 15 years: isotemporal models of PA and sedentary time
dose of PA for health,24,25 reduced the risk of CVD mortality 
by almost 40%. A possible explanation for the inconsistency 
in risk reductions of all-cause mortality from light-intensity 
PA and MVPA might be that they depend on different physi-
ological mechanisms. There is an ongoing debate on whether 
sedentary behavior is associated with increased mortality 
through distinct mechanisms biologically independent from 
the consequences of insufficient MVPA.10,11 It is also possible 
that a larger sample is needed to show significant results for 
replacement of sedentary behavior with MVPA, due to the 
skewed distribution of MVPA in our data set or possible 
interindividual responses to MVPA. In addition, the lack 
of association between cancer and MVPA influenced the 
outcome for all-cause mortality. Current evidence has found 
the associations between various sedentary behavior mea-
sures and all-cause or CVD mortality to be fairly consistent, 
whereas findings for cancer mortality are inconsistent.11,26 
Although PA plays an important role at all points of interest 
for cancer survival, the mechanisms by which PA affects 
cancer mortality are complex and may differ by cancer 
site.26 Similarly to our results, Schmid et al15 found small or 
nonsignificant survival effects when sedentary behavior was

Notes: Associated with replacement of 10 and 30 minutes of sedentary time with an equal amount of time spent in light-intensity physical activity (LIPA) or moderate–
vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Model 1 comprises LIPA, MVPA, and total accelerometer-wearing time, stratified by sex and age tertiles. Model 2 is additionally adjusted 
for education, smoking, and presence of hypertension, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes at baseline. Sedentary time was defined as <100 counts/minute, LIPA as 100–2,019 
counts/minute, and MVPA as ≥2,020 counts/minute.

replaced with PA. Larger studies may be needed, allowing 
analysis by both different PA intensities and different types 
of cancers, to investigate these associations further.
It is essential to acknowledge that isotemporal substitu-
tion models reflect only the theoretical effects of replacing 
one activity for another, rather than actual changes in behav-
ior. Studies examining actual behavioral changes are needed 
to confirm our findings. Furthermore, the choice of the length 
of the replaced bout does not affect the statistical significance 
of the results, only the strength of the associations. We 
chose to analyze the replacement of both 10- and 30-minute 
bouts to be able to present results that would be useful from 
a behavioral counseling perspective. If sedentary time is 
replaced with light-intensity PA, a bout of at least 30 minutes 
may be both relevant and achievable, but if sedentary time 
is substituted with MVPA, a 10-minute replacement may be 
more realistic for many individuals.27
Our study has a number of strengths. We analyzed data 
from the first population-based cohort using accelerometry, 
enabling 15 years’ follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the longest follow-up of objectively measured seden-
tary behavior and PA in a nationally representative sample. 
In comparison with earlier published research,15,16 we had 
>7 years longer follow-up. The high accelerometer-wearing 
time compliance and the reliable register data on mortality 
and cause of death are also important strengths. Addition-
ally, our choice to estimate the mortality benefits for both a 
10-minute and a 30-minute reduction in sedentary time makes 
our findings easy to translate into clinical advice, as well as 
public health messages.
Our study also has some limitations. Compared to other 
population-based studies, our sample size was relatively 
small, and all background characteristics were self-reported. 
The activity data of our study were not assessed repeatedly 
during follow-up; therefore, we do not have information 
about changes in sedentary behavior or PA habits over time 
that may have influenced the observed associations. However, 
analyses of an ABC study subsample28 found that total PA 
remained unchanged from 2001 to 2008, suggesting that 
potential changes are small and will not influence the results 
on a group level.
Despite the advantages of objective assessment of PA 
using accelerometry, there are some limitations with this 
method. First, accelerometers do not capture all PA, such 
as upper body movements, biking, and swimming. Second, 
the ActiGraph records body movement and not postures. 
Consequently, periods of standing still may be misclassified 
as sedentary time. A third limitation is the challenges asso-
ciated with translation of activity counts into categories of 
different PA intensity,29,30 and the estimates of time spent in 
different intensity categories are highly sensitive to selected 
cutoff points. The cutoff point we chose for sedentary 
time (<100 counts/minute) is the most frequently used in 
studies on older adults31 and has also been used in similar 
studies.15,16,23 Several cutoff points have been proposed for 
MVPA,31,32 and there is lack of consensus on cutoff points 
appropriate for large epidemiological studies. The use of 
cutoff points to determine MVPA may be most problematic 
for older adults, and specific, lower cutoff points have been 
suggested.31 We chose the ≥2,020 counts/minute cutoff 
point, since it is equivalent to walking at 4 km/h,33 which is 
achievable moderate intensity for most people.34,35 It is also 
an advantage that this cutoff point has previously been used 
in the NHANES data set,15,16,23 which facilitates comparisons. 
Matthews et al16,30 suggested the ≥760 counts/minute cutoff 
point to be the most appropriate for MVPA; however, we 
have previously shown that it is very likely to overestimate 
time in MVPA in our sample.8
Even though we adjusted for potentially important 
confounders, as any observational study, our results may be 
subject to unmeasured confounding. For example, we did 
not have information on alcohol use or mobility limitations. 
Other potential confounders are modifiable lifestyle factors 
like dietary patterns and stress. Finally, the accelerometers 
were worn only during waking hours, and we did not have 
any reliable information on sleeping time. Recent research36 
has shown that isotemporal models with a 24-hour approach, 
including sleeping time, may add important information to 
the associations explored in this study.
Conclusion
This study strengthens recent findings that light-intensity 
PA might be even more beneficial for health than previously 
found. If 30 minutes of daily sedentary time was replaced 
with light-intensity PA, the risk of all-cause mortality and 
CVD mortality was reduced by 11% and 24%, respectively. 
Replacement of sedentary time with MVPA reduced CVD 
mortality, but not all-cause or cancer mortality. Our results 
support the view that the most relevant public health message 
may be to promote the benefits of light-intensity activities 
and reduced sedentary time, without downplaying the health 
effects of MVPA.
