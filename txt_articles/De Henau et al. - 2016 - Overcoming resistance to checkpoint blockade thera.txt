Abstract
Recent clinical trials using immunotherapy demonstrate its potential to control cancer by 
disinhibiting the immune system. Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) antibodies such as anti-
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-Programmed cell death protein 
1/anti-Programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1)1 have demonstrated durable clinical 
responses in various cancers. Although these new immunotherapies have significant impact on 
cancer treatment, multiple mechanisms of immune resistance exist in tumors. Among the key 
mechanisms, myeloid cells play a major role in limiting effective tumor immunity. 2–4 Growing 
evidence suggests that high infiltration of immune-suppressive myeloid cells correlates with poor 
prognosis and ICB resistance. 5,6 These observations suggest a need for a precision medicine 
approach where the design of the immunotherapeutic combinations are tailored based on tumor 
immune landscape to overcome such resistance mechanisms. Herein we employ a preclinical 
model system and show that resistance to ICB is directly mediated by the suppressive activity of 
infiltrating myeloid cells in various tumors. Furthermore, selective pharmacologic targeting of the 
gamma isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K-γ), highly expressed in myeloid cells, restores 
sensitivity to ICB. We demonstrate that targeting PI3K–γ, with a selective inhibitor, currently 
being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02637531), can reshape the tumor immune 
microenvironment and promote cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor regression without targeting

 cancer cells directly. Our results introduce opportunities for new combination strategies using a 
selective small molecule PI3K-γ inhibitor, such as IPI-549, to overcome resistance to ICB in 
patients with high levels of suppressive myeloid cell infiltration in tumors.
Tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs) constitute a major component of the tumor 
microenvironment. Although some controversies persist in the precise description of the 
distinct subsets of this heterogeneous population, it is accepted that these cells promote 
tumor immune-suppression.7 Recent studies support their contribution to the suppression of 
T cell function, which is not abolished by the use of ICB.8–11 To understand the association 
between resistance to ICB and myeloid cell infiltration, we compared multiple mouse tumor 
models treated with ICB. We show that mice bearing 4T1 breast carcinoma are resistant to 
anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Fig. 1a and Extended data Fig. 1). We observe that 
myeloid cells (CD11b+), constitute the majority of CD45+ tumor-infiltrating leukocytes 
(TILs) in this model (Fig. 1b). This correlates with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration and 
cytolytic function (Fig. 1b,c). In contrast, B16-F10 melanoma tumors, which are more 
responsive to ICB (Fig. 1a and Extended data Fig. 1), are less infiltrated with myeloid cells 
but contain more activated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1b). Additionally, CD8+ T cells express more 
granzyme B in the B16-F10 model. They also express higher levels of PD-1 and CTLA-4 
(Fig. 1a–c, data not shown), which might explain their sensitivity to ICB. Furthermore, 
myeloid cells from 4T1 tumors or spleens suppress proliferation of T cells to a greater extent 
compared to myeloid cells from B16-F10 (Fig. 1d and Extended data Fig 1b). These data 
suggest that TAMCs have varying phenotypes and are more suppressive in ICB resistant 
tumors. Tumor-derived soluble factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) help shape the tumor microenvironment by promoting myelopoiesis and 
recruitment of suppressive myeloid cells.12,13 To directly assess the ability of suppressive 
myeloid cells to induce resistance to ICB in the B16 melanoma, we used B16-F10 cells 
transduced with a GM-CSF expression construct (B16-GM-CSF) 14. Tumors in this B16 
model (B16-GM-CSF) become infiltrated by suppressive TAMCs and lose sensitivity to ICB 
compared to B16-F10 controls (Fig. 1a–d and Extended data Fig. 1), indicating the critical 
role suppressive myeloid cells play in ICB resistance.
Kaneda et al17 and previous studies15,16, have shown that PI3K-γ is highly expressed in 
myeloid cells and promotes migration and production of inflammatory mediators. Mice 
deficient in p110γ sub-unit of PI3K-γ show reduced tumor growth and immunosuppressive 
TAMC.18 We reasoned that pharmacological PI3K-γ inhibition might lead to effective anti-
tumor immune response and subvert ICB resistance caused by suppressive myeloid cells. To 
test this hypothesis, we used IPI-549, a selective PI3K-γ inhibitor in multiple tumor 
models19 (Extended data Fig. 2a). IPI-549 treatment alone led to tumor growth inhibition in 
4T1, B16-GMCSF, MC38, CT26, and LLC tumor models (Fig. 2a and Extended data Fig. 
2b). Lack of activity in tumors with low suppressive TAMCs (B16-F10, Fig. 2a) suggests 
PI3K-γ inhibition affects myeloid cells and has no direct effect on tumor cells or other TILs. 
We also observe a significant reduction in lung metastasis after IPI-549-treatment (Fig. 2b). 
TIL quantification shows no consistent differences in the total myeloid (CD11b+) or 
macrophage (CD11b+/F480+) cell populations in either IPI-549- or vehicle-treated 4T1 or 
B16-GMCSF tumors (Fig. 2c). The effects of IPI-549 on TAMC subsets were comparable to

 those seen in p110γ −/− mice17,18. PI3K-γ inhibition switches the activation of 
macrophages from an immunosuppressive M2-like (CD11b+F4/80+CD206+) phenotype to a 
more inflammatory M1-like (CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+) state (Fig. 2c, Extended data Fig. 2c). 
We further tested RNA expression of M1 and M2 markers in 4T1 and B16-GMCSF tumors 
after IPI-549. The expression of prototypic M2-markers (TGF-β, Arg-1, IDO) are reduced, 
while M1-markers (IL-12, INOS) are higher in IPI-549-treated tumors (Fig. 2d). Given that 
CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages constitute only a portion of suppressive TAMCs, we further 
subdivided myeloid cells into granulocytes (CD11b+Ly6G+), monocytes (Ly6Chigh/
MHCIIlow = Mono-Lo), immature macrophages (LyC6high/MHCIIhigh = Mono-Hi), M1 
macrophages (Ly6Clow/MHCIIhigh = TAM-M1) or M2 macrophages (Ly6Clow/MHCIIlow = 
TAM-M2)20,21. When we analyzed the myeloid cells with the above gating strategy in 4T1 
TILs, we also observed that IPI-549 shifts myeloid cells toward the TAM-M1 population 
(Extended data Fig. 3a). Moreover, relative mRNA expression of M1 and M2 markers 
correlate with a less suppressive function of these cells (Extended data Fig. 3b). We 
subsequently tested the suppressive function of myeloid cells derived from IPI-549 treated 
B16-GMCSF tumor bearing mice on naïve CD8 T cells proliferation (Fig. 2e). We show that 
suppression of CD8+ T cells is abolished in IPI-549-treated mice or when IPI-549 is added 
to the media. A similar functional observation was made in human myeloid suppressor cells 
in PBMCs (Extended data Fig. 4b) confirming its potential clinical use. In addition, 
pharmacodynamic evaluation of whole blood confirms inhibition of PI3K-γ in monocytes 
after activation with a PI3K-γ stimulus in human volunteers (Extended data Fig. 4a.). To 
confirm that inhibition of PI3K-γ in myeloid cells is required to delay tumor progression, 
we depleted myeloid cells (anti-CD11b) prior to implanting LLC-Brei tumors in mice. 
Treatment with IPI-549 did not delay tumor growth in the absence of TAMCs (Extended 
data Fig. 2e). Taken together these findings suggest that PI3K-γ inhibition using IPI-549 is 
mainly effective in a tumor landscape rich in suppressive myeloid cells and allows for more 
precise delineation of patients in which it will potentially yield the greatest activity.
The IPI-549-driven polarization of myeloid cells to a less immunosuppressive phenotype 
correlates with increased CD8+ T cell infiltrates and a higher CD8/Treg ratio at day 14 in 
both 4T1 and B16-GMCSF tumors (Fig. 3a). CD8+ T cells expressed more granzyme B and 
proliferated more (Ki67+) in IPI-549 treated groups (Fig. 3a Extended data Fig. 5a). Along 
with these effector mechanisms, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 were enhanced in T 
cells (Fig. 3a and Extended data Fig. 5a). Furthermore, in mice lacking T cells (RAG KO, 
Nu/Nu or after anti-CD8 T cell depletion) the impact of IPI-549 was abrogated (Fig. 3b, 
Extended data Fig. 5b,c). These findings confirm that targeting PI3K-γ enhances the T cell-
mediated anti-tumor activity by modifying myeloid cells suppressive fucntion. We were 
concerned that targeting a key pathway in myeloid cells may affect their antigen 
presentation. Reassuringly, we found that IPI-549 did not reduce, but rather enhanced, the 
activation of tumor antigen-specific T cells. This was demonstrated by the transfer of tumor 
antigen specific cells (Pmel-1) in B16-GMCSF bearing mice (Fig. 3c) and by ELISpot using 
CD8+ T cells isolated from CT26 tumor-bearing mice (Extended data Fig. 5d). Additionally, 
the proportion of effector memory cells (CD44+CD62L−) in CD8+ and CD4+ populations 
was not affected (Extended data Fig. 6), suggesting that IPI-549 does not affect the ability of 
antigen-presenting cells to activate antigen-specific T cells. Taken together, these results

 demonstrate that selective PI3K-γ inhibition reduces the immune-suppressive function of 
myeloid cells, ultimately promoting T-effector activation and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity.
We found that treatment of myeloid-enriched tumors with IPI-549 leads to upregulation of 
PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression on CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3a. and Extended data Figs 2d and 5a). 
This strongly suggests that combining PI3K-γ inhibition with ICB therapy could yield 
additional anti-tumor activity. In fact, in the ICB resistant 4T1 or B16-GMCSF models, the 
combination of either anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 with IPI-549 significantly delayed tumor 
growth when compared to ICB alone (Fig 4a,b). We further confirmed this observation in the 
ICB-resistant LLC tumor model (Extended data Fig. 7). Analysis of TILs in the combination 
regimen of IPI-549 with PD-1 blockade shows that the addition of IPI-549 reduces immune 
suppression by increasing the M1/M2 ratio, resulting in improved T cell effector function in 
4T1 and B16-GMCSF tumors (Extended data Fig. 8). These results are similar to those 
reported by Kaneda et al where PD-1 blockade was combined with a dual PI3K inhibitor 
(γ/δ)17; however, given the important effect of PI3K-δ in T cell function and more 
specifically regulatory T cells (Tregs), it is unclear whether the observed antitumor drug 
effect is myeloid and/or T cell dependent. As CTLA-4 and PD-1 have distinct immunologic 
mechanisms of action, greater therapeutic efficacy is achieved when both therapies are 
combined22. We tested the anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 combination with IPI-549 in the 4T1 
and B16-GMCSF models (Fig. 4a). Double checkpoint blockade therapy alone did not result 
in any complete tumor regressions in 4T1-bearing mice and only 20% of the mice bearing 
B16-GMCSF benefited from the therapy, further confirming multiple checkpoint resistance 
in these models. Notably, the addition of IPI-549 to the combination of anti-CTLA-4 + anti-
PD-1 was associated with complete remissions in 30% of 4T1 and 80% of B16-GMCSF 
tumor-bearing mice. Importantly, tumor-free survivors were resistant to tumor re-
implantation (Extended data Figure 9), indicating long lasting adaptive immunity.
Taken together, our data indicate that high infiltration by suppressive TAMCs promotes 
resistance to ICB, further confirming the complex, multi-factorial mechanisms of immune 
suppression in the tumor microenvironment. We show that modulating the suppressive 
phenotype of these cells toward a more inflammatory one can be achieved by selective 
pharmacologic targeting of the myeloid PI3K-γ isoform. By doing so, sensitivity to ICB can 
be effectively restored in TAMC rich tumors. These findings provide a strong rationale to 
consider exploring PI3K-γ inhibition to overcome resistance to ICB in clinical trials based 
on a precision medicine-type assessment of the tumor immune landscape. This hypothesis is 
currently being tested in the IPI-549 phase 1/1b trial, as both a monotherapy and in 
combination with PD-1 blockade in solid tumors (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02637531).

 (referred as to B16-GMCSF) has been reported and was used to increase the number of 
myeloid cells recruited to the tumor.2 The cell lines have been mycoplasma tested.
Quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was prepared using 1μg RNA with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta 
Biosciences). Sybr green-based qPCR was performed using murine primers to Arg1, Ifng, 
Il10, Il12p40, Il1b, Il6, Ccl2, Gapdh, Nos2, Tgfb1, Tnfa, IL4ra, Indo, Ctla4, Pd-l1, CD86, 
CxCr2, Fizz1, Ymd1 (Qiagen QuantiTect Primer Assay). mRNA levels were normalized to 
Gapdh (dCt = Ct gene of interest – Ct Gapdh) and reported as relative mRNA expression 
(ddCt = 2^-(dCt sample – dCt control)) or fold change.
Cytokine Analysis
Tumors were excised, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized using a tissue grinder. 
Tumor protein lysates were prepared in MSD Tris Lysis Buffer (Meso Scale Discovery, 
Rockville Maryland) containing 2X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 
(Fisher Scientific). Total protein concentration was normalized to 4 mg/ml and cytokines 
were quantified using the MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead 
32 Plex Panel and MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse CD8+ T Cell Magnetic Bead Panel kits 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
RNAseq
Mice bearing CT26 tumors were treated with vehicle or IPI-549 (15 mg/kg/day, PO) for 6 or 
9 days. Tumors were isolated, and frozen until needed; tumors then thawed and RNA was 
extracted from all cells. RNAseq was done at Expression Analysis (Q2 Solutions). Sequence 
reads were aligned to the mouse B38 reference genome using OmicSoft ArrayStudio and the 
UCSC gene model. Log2(FPKM) was calculated for each gene, and data were mean 
centered for display in heat maps. The analysis focused on a compilation of about 4,200 
mouse genes related to cancer immunology and PI3K pathway signaling compiled from 
numerous sources including BioCarta pathways, GO gene ontologies, KEGG pathways, 
WikiPathways, and literature.5
Mice
C57BL/6J and Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. 
Pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice have been previously reported1 and were provided by N. 
Restifo (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). All mice were maintained in micro 
isolator cages and treated in accordance with the NIH and American Association of 
Laboratory Animal Care regulations. All mouse procedures and experiments for this study 
were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee. Ten to fifteen mice per treatment strategy were used to allow 90% 
power, and a 5% significance level, and detect differences in tumor-free survival from 10% 
to 80%. Typically, tumors grow in 100% of control animals. An additional 5 mice per group 
were for tissue harvest at day 7 and day 14 on treatment. Mice cage, treatment allowance 
were at random at day 7 after tumor implants.

 Tumor Challenge and Treatment Experiments
On day 0 of the experiments, tumor cells were injected intradermally (i.d.) in the right flank. 
For the B16 model, 2.5×105 B16-WT or B16-GMCSF cells were injected into C57BL/6J 
mice. For 4T1 model and for the CT26 model, 5×105 cells were used subcutaneously in 
Balb/c mice. For studies in immune compromised mice, the CT26 study was done in the 
Balb/c nu/nu strain and the B16-GMCSF in C57Bl.6 rag1−/− mice. Mice were obtained from 
Jackson Labs and Charles River Labs. Treatments were given as single agents or in 
combinations with the following regimen for each drug. The PI3K-γ inhibitor drug IPI-549 
was dissolved at 5% 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in Polyethylene Glycol 400 and administered 
by oral gavage once a day at 15 mg/kg. Treatment was initiated on day 7 ending on day 21 
post tumor implant. Control groups received vehicle (5% NMP, 95% PEG) without the 
active product. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody (100 μg/mouse, clone 9H10, Bio X cell) and anti-
PD-1 antibody (250 μg/mouse, clone RPM1- 14, Bio X cell) were injected intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) on days 7, 10, 13 and 16 for the B16, B16-GMCSF and 4T1 models and on days 10, 13 
and 16 for the CT26 model. Tumors were measured every second or third day with a caliper, 
and the volume (length × width × height) was calculated. Mice that had no visible and 
palpable tumors that could be measured on consecutive measurement days were considered 
complete regressions. Animals were euthanized for signs of distress or when the total tumor 
volume reached 2500 mm3. For the re-challenge study: mice with complete responses in the 
anti-PD-1 treatment group and the anti-PD-1 and IPI-549 combination group were re-
challenged with 2.5 × 105 CT26.WT tumor cells (on day 106 of the study since original 
tumor implant). Additional mice with complete responses from an additional IPI-549 and 
anti-PD-1 group were implanted with 1×105 4T1 tumor cells.
Cell depletion studies
Female BALB/c mice were depleted of CD8+ T cells by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a 
CD8 depleting antibody beginning 3 days before tumor implantation and continuing every 3 
days (Q3D) for the duration of the study. Control animals were injected IP with an isotype 
control antibody according to the same dosing schedule. CD8+ T cell depletion was verified 
by flow cytometry of splenic cells from a separate cohort of mice at the time of tumor 
implant. Anti-CD8 antibody (BioXCell, In Vivo MAb Rat IgG2b anti-mouse CD8, clone 
169.4) and isotype control antibody (BioXCell, In Vivo MAb Rat IgG2b, κ isotype control, 
clone LTF-2) were used. CD8+ T-cell-depleted and isotype control treated mice were 
implanted with 2.5×105 CT26.WT cells subcutaneously to the dorsal right flank. Eight days 
after implant, tumor-bearing animals with average tumor volumes of 50 to 60 mm3 began 
treatment. Animals were dosed daily with vehicle or IPI-549 (15/mg/kg, PO) and dosed 
every three days with 100 μg antibody, either isotope control or anti-CD8. Tumor 
measurements were taken every second or third day during the 13 days of dose 
administration. For CD11b+ cell depletion, murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma tumor brei (here 
referred to as LLC) was propagated into ten C57BL/6 Albino male mice. When tumors 
reached an average of 1500 mm3, tissue was collected and made into a single cell 
suspension. Tissue was dissociated in a glass dunce, filtered through a 100 micron filter and 
washed with cold buffer of PBS pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA. An aliquot of cells was 
separated, and placed on ice until the time of re-transplant. Cells were counted and adjusted 
to 2×107 total cells. To deplete the CD11b cells from the tumor homogenate, CD11b micro

 beads (MACS #130-049-601) were added to the sample and incubated on ice for 15 min. 
Cells were washed and re-suspended with buffer. A negative depletion was preformed 
following the Miltenyi autoMACS protocol. The positive selected cells and starting tumor 
inoculum were counted and cell numbers adjusted to the tumor inoculum used for historical 
studies. For each cell condition 30 C57BL/Albino male mice were inoculated. Treatment of 
IPI-549 or vehicle started when tumors for each cell condition reached an average of 200 
mm3 regardless of what day post implant this occurred.
Isolation of Tumor-infiltrating Cells and Lymphoid Tissue Cells
Mouse tumor samples were minced with scissors prior to incubation with 1.67 U/ml 
Liberase (Roche) and 0.2mg/ml DNase (Roche) in RPMI for 30 min at 37 °C. Tumor 
samples were homogenized by repeated pipetting and filtered through a 100-μm nylon filter 
(BD Biosciences) in RPMI supplemented with 7.5% FCS to generate single-cell 
suspensions. Cell suspensions were washed once with complete RPMI and purified on a 
Ficoll gradient to eliminate dead cells. Cells from mouse spleens were isolated by grinding 
spleens through 40-μm filters. After red blood cell (RBC) lysis (ACK Lysing Buffer, Lonza) 
when required, all samples were washed and re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS/
0.5%albumine) or RPMI depending on further use..
Flow Cytometry and Morphology Analysis
Cells isolated from mouse tumors and spleens were pre-incubated (15 min, 4 °C) with anti-
CD16/32 monoclonal antibody (Fc block, clone 2.4G, BD Biosciences) to block nonspecific 
binding and then stained (30 min, 4 °C) with appropriate dilutions of various combinations 
of the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: anti-CD45-AF 700 (clone 30-F11), 
anti-CD11b-APC-Cy7 (clone M1/70), anti-CD11b-PE-TR(M1/70.15), anti-Ly6G-APC 
(clone 1A8), anti- F4/80-PercP-Cy5.5 (clone BM8), anti-Ly6C-PE-Cy7 (clone AL-21), anti-
MHC Class II-eFluor 450 (clone M5/114.15.2), Anti-CD206-PE (clone 19.2), anti-CD8- 
Percp-Cy5.5 (clone 53-6.7), anti-CD8- PE Texas Red (clone 5H10), anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 
(clone RM4-5), anti-CD4-Pacific Blue (clone RM4-5), anti-Foxp3-APC (clone FJK-16s), 
anti-Foxp3-PE-Cy7 (clone FJK-16s), anti-CD25- APC-Cy7 (clone PC61), anti-CD44-PE-
Cy7 (clone IM7), anti-CD62L-PE (clone MEL-14), anti-Ki67 (clone B56), anti-CTLA-4-
APC (clone), anti-Granzyme B-PE-TR (clone GB11), antibodies, all purchased from BD 
Biosciences, eBioscience or invitrogen. For intracellular stain, cells were further 
permeabilized using a FoxP3 Fixation and Permeabilization Kit (eBioscience) and stained 
for Foxp3 (clone FJK-16s, Alexa-Fluor-700-conjugated, eBioscience), Ki67 (clone SolA15, 
eFluor-450-conjugated, eBioscience) or CTLA-4. The stained cells were acquired on a 
LSRII Flow Cytometer using BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and the data were 
processed using FlowJo software (Treestar). Dead cells and doublets were excluded on the 
basis of forward and side scatter and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506.
Purification of Myeloid or CD8 T cells from tumors or spleen
Mouse tumor and spleen single-cell suspensions were generated as described in the previous 
section. Tumor cells were subsequently separated from debris over a Ficoll gradient (Sigma-
Aldrich). B cells were depleted from splenocytes using CD19 microbeads and LD columns 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec) to enrich the myeloid

anti CD8-PE antibodies for flow sorting on a FACSAria™ II Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). 
Dead cells were excluded using DAPI (Invitrogen). Purity of flow-sorted populations was 
above 90%.
Isolation of Pmel Lymphocytes and Adoptive Transfer
Spleens and lymph nodes from pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice were isolated and ground 
through 100-μm filters. After RBC lysis, CD8+ T cells were purified by positive selection 
using Miltenyi magnetic beads. The isolated cells were loaded with CellTrace™ Far Red 
DDAO-SE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and injected into recipient animals via tail vein at 
indicated numbers. Activated CD8+ T cells were generated by culturing splenocytes with 
soluble anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml, clone 145-2C11, eBioscience) and anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml, clone 
37.51, eBioscience) for 72 h. Recombinant mouse IL-2 (30 U/ml, Chiron) was added for the 
final 24 h of culture. CD8+ T cells were subsequently positively selected with Miltenyi 
magnetic beads prior to injection via tail vein, as described above. The frequency and 
proliferation of pmel cells were measured 2 weeks after tumor challenge and 7 days after 
adoptive transfer of 1×106 in vitro activated CD8+pmel T cells using Thy1.1 antibody and 
by assessing CellTrace™ Far Red DDAO-SE dilution by flow cytometry, respectively.
T cell Suppression Assay
Spleens from naïve mice were isolated and ground through 40-μm filters to generate a single 
cell suspension. After RBC lysis, CD8+ cells were purified using anti-CD8 (Ly-2) 
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) according to manufacturer’s protocol and labeled with 1 mM 
CFSE (Invitrogen) in pre-warmed PBS for 10 min at 37°C. The CFSE-labeled CD8+ T cells 
were then plated in complete RPMI media supplemented with 0.05 M β-mercaptoethanol 
onto round bottom 96-well plates (25 × 10E3 cells per well) coated with 1 μg/ml anti- CD3 
(clone 1454-2C11) and 5 μg/ml anti-CD28 (clone 37N) antibodies. Purified myeloid cells 
were added in indicated ratios and plates were incubated at 37 °C. After 48 h, cells were 
harvested and CFSE signal in the gated CD8+ T cells was measured by flow cytometry 
(LSRII Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences). For the human MDSC suppression assay PBMCs 
were isolated using Lymphoprep™ from donor blood. T cells were isolated by CD3+ 
selection (Easysep, Stem Cell Technologies) and frozen in Sigma freezing media for later 
use. The remaining PBMCs minus T cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml GMCSF and 20 
ng/ml IL6 for 6 days to differentiate the myeloid cells and were incubated with or without 
added IPI-549. After 6 days, the MDSC cells were isolated by CD33+ selection (Easysep, 
Stem Cell Technologies). These MDSC cells were then mixed with the autologous T cells 
(at a 1:4 ratio) that had been pre-stained with cell trace violet and activated with anti-CD3 
and anti-CD28 beads (Dynal). The T cell proliferation is determined by Cell Trace Violet 
dye dilution measured by flow cytometry after 72 hours.
IFN-γ ELISPOT assay
Blood was collected from Vehicle and IPI-549 (15mg/kg) treated CT26 tumor-bearing mice 
after 10 days of treatment. PBMC were isolated using Lymphoprep density gradient media 
(Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). IFN-γ producing cells were quantified using the 
CTL Mouse Immunospot IFN-γ Single Color ELISPOT kit (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH)

 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For in vitro re-stimulation, 1×105 PBMC were 
co-cultured with 1×105 irradiated (2000 rad) CT26 colon carcinoma target cells in CTL test 
media (CTL) for 16 hours. Irradiated (2000 rad) 4T1 mammary carcinoma target cells were 
used as negative control targets to assess specificity. IFN-γ spots were quantified using a 
CTL Immunospot S6 Micro Analyzer and Immunospot Professional Software (CTL).
Macrophage polarization assay
Bone marrow derived macrophages were prepared from C57Bl/6 mice femur and tibias. Red 
blood cells were lysed and then the remaining cells were plated in bone macrophage media 
(BMM) consisting of DMEM, 20% FBS plus pen/Strep and 50 ng/ml M-CSF and incubated 
for 6 days. Cells were polarized towards an M2 phenotype with the addition of 20 ng/ml IL4 
and 50 ng/ml M-MCSF (both from R&D Systems) with or without added IPI-549. Cells 
were incubated for 48 hours and then RNA was harvested from the cells (Qiagen RNeasy). 
qRT-PCR was performed using primers for mouse ARG1 (Mm00475988_m1, Life 
Technologies NY) and mouse B-actin (Mm00607939_s1 Life Technologies, NY).
Biochemical and cell based assays
Biochemical and Cell based assays for the Class I and Class II PI3K isoforms were run as 
previously described.3,4
PI3K-gamma-specific whole blood PD assay
Whole blood from 6 healthy donors was pretreated with a dose titration of IPI-549 and then 
stimulated for 2 minutes with 2.3 ug/ml CXCL12. Cells were lysed, fixed and stained. 
Human blood samples have been collected after ICF approval. Response to stimulation was 
determined by measuring phosphorylation of AKT S473 in monocytes (CD14+) by flow 
cytometry and comparing the value to that of untreated controls. IC50 values for IPI-549 
were calculated for each donor, measuring compound potency against PI3K-γ and in whole 
blood.
Statistics
Where indicated, data were analyzed for statistical significance and reported as P values. 
Data were analyzed by Mann-Withney test when comparing means of two independent 
groups and two-way ANOVA when comparing more than two groups. P<0.05 was 
considered statistically significant (*P<0.05, **P< 0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P< 0.0001). 
Evaluation of survival patterns in tumor-bearing mice was performed by the Kaplan–Meier 
method, and results were ranked according to the Mantel–Cox log-rank test. P<0.05was 
considered statistically significant (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001). 
Survival was defined as mice with tumors <2500 cm3.
