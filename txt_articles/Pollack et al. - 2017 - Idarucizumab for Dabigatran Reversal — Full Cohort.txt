BACKGROUND
Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anti-
coagulant effect of dabigatran.
METHODS
We performed a multicenter, prospective, open-label study to determine whether 
5 g of intravenous idarucizumab would be able to reverse the anticoagulant effect 
of dabigatran in patients who had uncontrolled bleeding (group A) or were about 
to undergo an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum 
percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after 
the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the diluted thrombin time or 
ecarin clotting time. Secondary end points included the restoration of hemostasis 
and safety measures.
RESULTS
A total of 503 patients were enrolled: 301 in group A, and 202 in group B. The me-
dian maximum percentage reversal of dabigatran was 100% (95% confidence inter-
val, 100 to 100), on the basis of either the diluted thrombin time or the ecarin clotting 
time. In group A, 137 patients (45.5%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and 
98 (32.6%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage; among the patients who could 
be assessed, the median time to the cessation of bleeding was 2.5 hours. In group B, 
the median time to the initiation of the intended procedure was 1.6 hours; periproce-
dural hemostasis was assessed as normal in 93.4% of the patients, mildly abnor-
mal in 5.1%, and moderately abnormal in 1.5%. At 90 days, thrombotic events had 
occurred in 6.3% of the patients in group A and in 7.4% in group B, and the mortal-
ity rate was 18.8% and 18.9%, respectively. There were no serious adverse safety 
signals.
CONCLUSIONS
In emergency situations, idarucizumab rapidly, durably, and safely reversed the anti-
coagulant effect of dabigatran. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; RE-VERSE AD

P
atients who are receiving oral an-
ticoagulant therapy for the prevention or 
treatment of thrombosis may benefit from 
anticoagulant reversal if they present with life-
threatening bleeding or if they will be undergo-
ing urgent surgery or intervention. Therefore, 
the availability of specific reversal agents has the 
potential to improve the benefit–risk profile of 
long-term anticoagulant therapy and to increase 
patient and physician acceptance of such treat-
ment. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal 
antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with 
high affinity and specificity and rapidly reverses 
its anticoagulant activity.1 Idarucizumab has been 
licensed in many countries, in part on the basis 
of the results of an interim analysis of data on 
the first 90 patients enrolled in the Reversal 
Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran 
(RE-VERSE AD) study.2 This report provides data 
on the entire cohort of 503 patients included in 
that study and validates the results of the inter-
im analysis.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, single-
cohort study.3 The rationale for not including a 
control group has been described previously.2,3 A 
steering committee composed of representatives 
from academia and the sponsor (Boehringer 
Ingelheim) assumes final responsibility for the 
design and conduct of the study. The study pro-
tocol, which is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org, was approved by all the rele-
vant institutional review boards. All the authors 
contributed to the drafting of the manuscript, 
made the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication, and vouch for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data, the accuracy of the analyses, 
and the fidelity of the study to the protocol. No 
one who is not an author contributed to the writ-
ing of the manuscript.
Patients
The study included two groups of adults, 18 years 
of age or older, who were receiving dabigatran. 
The patients in group A were those with uncon-
trollable or life-threatening bleeding that was 
judged by the treating clinician to require rapid 
anticoagulant reversal. The patients in group B 
were those who were about to undergo surgery 
or other invasive procedures that could not be 
delayed for at least 8 hours and for which nor-
mal hemostasis was required. All the patients or 
their authorized representative provided written 
informed consent.
Study Treatment
All patients were to receive 5 g of intravenous 
idarucizumab, which was administered as two 
50-ml bolus infusions, each containing 2.5 g of 
idarucizumab, no more than 15 minutes apart. 
The 5-g dose was calculated to reverse the total 
body load of dabigatran that was associated with 
the 99th percentile of the dabigatran levels mea-
sured in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term 
Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial.4
Assessments and Study End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the maximum 
percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of 
dabigatran, determined at any point from the end 
of the first idarucizumab infusion until 4 hours 
after the end of the second infusion, with the 
percentage reversal assessed on the basis of the 
diluted thrombin time or the ecarin clotting time. 
These measurements were chosen because they 
correlate linearly with dabigatran concentrations 
measured with the use of mass spectroscopy.5,6 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic assessments were obtained at baseline, 
after the first infusion of idarucizumab, and be-
tween 10 and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 
24 hours after the second infusion. Diluted throm-
bin time, ecarin clotting time, activated partial-
thromboplastin time, and concentrations of un-
bound dabigatran were measured at a central 
laboratory, as described previously.3 Reasons that 
an assessment could not be performed at any 
given time point included death, a missing sam-
ple, a small-volume sample, and technical diffi-
culties. Treating clinicians were unaware of the 
results at the central laboratory. In parallel, the 
activated partial-thromboplastin time was as-
sessed locally at baseline, after the first infusion 
of idarucizumab, and between 10 and 30 min-
utes and at 12 hours after the second infusion of 
idarucizumab. Complete reversal was defined as 
a decrease in the diluted thrombin time or ecarin 
clotting time to a normal level. A second 5-g dose 
of idarucizumab was permitted if there was re-
current or continued bleeding and objective evi-
dence of a residual anticoagulant effect of dabi-

gatran or if a second surgical procedure was 
necessary and residual anticoagulant activity was 
suspected or confirmed.
Clinical outcomes, as assessed by the treating 
clinician, were secondary end points. In group A, 
the extent of bleeding and hemodynamic stabil-
ity were assessed between 10 and 30 minutes 
and at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours after the second 
idarucizumab infusion or when deemed clini-
cally appropriate. The severity of bleeding was 
classified with the use of the International Soci-
ety on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria (for 
more details, see the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org).7 In group B, periproce-
dural hemostasis was classified by the clinician 
as normal or as mildly, moderately, or severely 
abnormal. Adverse events were coded according 
to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, ver-
sion 18.0.8 Adverse events occurring within 5 days 
after the administration of idarucizumab were 
considered to have occurred during treatment. 
The severity of bleeding at presentation (in group 
A) and any suspected thrombotic events or deaths 
occurring from the time of idarucizumab infu-
sion to 90 days after the infusion were to be ad-
judicated by an independent committee. Deaths 
were classified as vascular (including bleeding) or 
nonvascular in origin.
Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy end point of maximum per-
centage reversal of dabigatran was calculated for 
patients in whom pretreatment diluted thrombin 
times or ecarin clotting times were above the 
upper limit of the normal range as assessed at a 
central laboratory; descriptive statistics with con-
fidence intervals or percentiles were used as ap-
propriate. Clotting-time measurements that ex-
ceeded the maximum measurable range were 
imputed with the use of the maximum measur-
able clotting time of 500 seconds only if the 
imputation was consistent with the concomitant 
results of other coagulation tests and unbound-
dabigatran concentrations.3
The sample size was based on regulatory 
feedback and practical considerations, including 
recruitment rates and the frequency of serious 
bleeding complications and emergency surgery 
among patients receiving dabigatran. On the basis 
of data from the RE-LY trial, the annual rates of 
life-threatening bleeding among patients receiv-
ing dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg and 110 mg 
are 1.5% and 1.25%, respectively, and the annual 
rate of emergency surgery among patients receiv-
ing dabigatran is 1.5%.9
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
From June 2014 through July 2016, a total of 503 
patients (301 in group A and 202 in group B) were 
enrolled at 173 sites (of 369 initiated sites) in 39 
countries. More than 95% of the patients were 
receiving dabigatran for stroke prevention in the 
context of atrial fibrillation, and the median age 
was 78 years. The median patient-reported time 
from the last dose of dabigatran to the first infu-
sion of idarucizumab was 14.6 hours in group A 
and 18.0 hours in group B. Of the enrolled pa-
tients, 43.3% had a creatinine clearance, calcu-
lated with the use of the Cockcroft–Gault equa-
tion, that was less than 50 ml per minute. Many 
patients had coexisting conditions at the time of 
enrollment (Table 1).
Of the 301 patients in group A, 137 (45.5%) 
had gastrointestinal bleeding, 98 (32.6%) had in-
tracranial hemorrhage, and 78 (25.9%) had trauma 
as the cause of bleeding (Table 2). Bleeding was 
adjudicated as major or life-threatening in 265 
patients (88.0%) and resulted in surgical inter-
vention in 61 (20.3%); 114 patients (37.9%) had 
hemodynamic instability at presentation.
Of the 202 patients in group B, 197 (97.5%) 
underwent the intended surgery or intervention. 
The median time from the first infusion of ida-
rucizumab to the initiation of the procedure was 
1.6 hours. The indications for urgent surgery or 
intervention are listed in Table 2.
Reversal of Anticoagulation
At study entry, 461 of the 503 patients (91.7%; 
276 in group A and 185 in group B) had a pro-
longed diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting 
time and were included in the primary efficacy 
analysis (Table 1). The median maximum per-
centage reversal within 4 hours after the admin-
istration of idarucizumab was 100% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 100 to 100), as assessed on 
the basis of either the diluted thrombin time 
(Fig. 1A and 1B) or the ecarin clotting time (Fig. 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Reversal 
was rapid and occurred independently of age, sex, 
renal function, and dabigatran concentration at 
baseline. Reversal based on the activated partial-

Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal
thromboplastin time (Fig. 1D) and reversal based 
on the thrombin time (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), as measured at the central labo-
ratory, were similar to that based on the diluted 
thrombin time; the activated partial-thrombo-
plastin time was prolonged at baseline in 373 of 
the 503 patients (232 in group A and 141 in 
group B).
Dabigatran and Idarucizumab 
Concentrations
Only one patient, who was subsequently found 
to be receiving apixaban, had no measurable plas-
ma concentration of dabigatran at study entry. 
Unbound-dabigatran concentrations for all other 
patients correlated with the results of the clotting 
assays. The median baseline concentration of un-
bound dabigatran was 110 ng per milliliter in 
group A and 73.6 ng per milliliter in group B; after 
the administration of idarucizumab, the concen-
tration was 20 ng per milliliter or less in all but 
three patients who could be assessed (Fig. 1C). 
With these low concentrations of unbound dabi-
gatran, impairment of hemostasis is unlikely, be-
cause corresponding clotting times are at or below 
the upper limit of the normal range.
Unbound-dabigatran concentrations remained 
below 20 ng per milliliter for 24 hours in the ma-
jority of patients; however, reappearance of levels 
above 20 ng per milliliter was observed in 114 of 
497 patients (23.0%), mainly after 12 hours, 
with 67 patients having elevated levels only at 
the 24-hour measurement. These recurrent ele-
vations were associated with recurrent or contin-
ued bleeding in 10 patients in group A and in no 
patients in group B; of the 10 patients, 3 received 
an additional dose of idarucizumab. At 24 hours, 
the median idarucizumab concentration had 
decreased to less than 1% of the peak median, 
a finding consistent with the short half-life of 
idarucizumab (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).10
Only 9 of the 503 patients (1.8%) received more 
than 5 g of idarucizumab, including the 3 in group 
A who had recurrent bleeding; 7 received a second 
dose of idarucizumab and 1 received two addi-
tional doses because they had recurrent bleeding 
or were undergoing a second urgent surgical pro-
cedure (Table 3). One patient received a second 
dose in error.
Clinical Outcomes
The time to the cessation of bleeding could not 
be assessed in the 98 patients with intracranial 
bleeding, because there is dissociation between 
the clinical course and the extent of bleeding. Al-
though hematoma expansion on early follow-up 
imaging studies of the head can be used as a 
surrogate for the determination of the time to 
bleeding cessation, such imaging studies were 
not mandated. Of the remaining 203 patients in 
group A, 134 (67.7%) had confirmed bleeding 
cessation within 24 hours; among those 134 pa-
tients, the median time to hemostasis after the 
administration of idarucizumab was 2.5 hours 
(95% CI, 2.2 to 3.9). In the remaining 69 patients, 
bleeding stopped before treatment in 2 patients 
and could not be determined in 67 patients. Be-
cause bleeding could not be visualized (either di-
rectly or with imaging), it was not possible to

know at a given time point whether bleeding had 
stopped or was still ongoing.
Among the 197 patients in group B who un-
derwent surgery or an intervention, periproce-
dural hemostasis was assessed as normal in 184 
patients (93.4%), mildly abnormal in 10 (5.1%), 
and moderately abnormal in 3 (1.5%); no pa-
tients had severely abnormal hemostasis. Many 
patients received transfusions and other blood 
products. The use of blood products and volume 
expanders is described in Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The 30-day mortality rate was 13.5% in group 
A and 12.6% in group B, and the corresponding 
90-day mortality rate, as estimated by the Ka-
plan–Meier method, was 18.8% and 18.9%, re-
spectively. The number of deaths that occurred 
within 5 days after treatment was 19 (6.3%) in 
group A and 16 (7.9%) in group B (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The 30-day mor-
tality rate was 16.4% among patients with intra-
cranial hemorrhage, 11.1% among patients with 
gastrointestinal bleeding, and 12.7% among 
patients with bleeding at other sites.

Thrombotic events occurred in 24 of the 503 
patients (4.8%; 14 in group A and 10 in group B) 
within 30 days after treatment and in 34 patients 
(6.8%; 19 in group A and 15 in group B) within 
90 days. Details of the 30-day events are pro-
vided in Figure 2. During the 90-day follow-up, 
antithrombotic therapy (including treatment with 
prophylactic or therapeutic doses of an anticoagu-
lant or with an antiplatelet drug) was restarted 
in 72.8% of the patients in group A and in 90.1% 
in group B, at a mean of 13.2 days and 3.5 days, 
respectively, after the administration of idaruci-
zumab. By 72 hours after the administration of 
idarucizumab, antithrombotic therapy was restart-
ed in 69 of the 301 patients in group A (22.9%), 
with 10.1% of those patients receiving dabigatran, 
and in 135 of the 202 patients in group B (66.8%), 
with 25.9% receiving dabigatran.
Immunogenicity and Hypersensitivity
Anti-idarucizumab antibodies were detected in 
28 of the 501 patients who could be assessed 
(5.6%). Of those 28 patients, 19 tested positive 
for preexisting antibodies that were cross-reactive 
with idarucizumab before its administration, and 
9 had antibodies that developed during treatment. 
The antibody titers were generally low (median, 4; 
interquartile range, 2 to 8), and the preexisting 
antibodies had no detectable effect on idaruci-
zumab activity.

Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal
Figure 1. Key Measurements before and after the Administration of Idarucizumab.
The diluted thrombin time in 293 patients who had uncontrolled bleeding and in 195 patients who were about to undergo urgent surgery 
or intervention are shown in Panels A and B, respectively. Panel C shows the plasma concentration of unbound dabigatran in the 485 
patients in groups A and B who could be assessed. Panel D shows the activated partial-thromboplastin time in the 486 patients in 
groups A and B who could be assessed. The arrows show the timing of the two infusions of idarucizumab. Blood samples were obtained 
at baseline, after the first infusion, and between 10 and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours after the second infusion. Data are 
presented as box-and-whisker plots, in which the top and bottom of the rectangles indicate the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively; 
the horizontal lines within the rectangles indicate the 50th percentile; the lines above and below the rectangles indicate the 90th and 
10th percentiles, respectively; and the dots above and below the lines indicate the 95th and 5th percentiles, respectively. The shaded ar-
eas show the normal ranges for each of the measures, which are based on data from 208 volunteers. The upper limits of the normal 
range for diluted thrombin time and activated partial-thromboplastin time are 35.5 seconds and 39.8 seconds, respectively.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Three potential hypersensitivity events, each 
of which occurred within 5 days after the admin-
istration of idarucizumab, were reported by the 
investigator as being drug-related. These included 
a rash that lasted 1 day in a patient in whom 
therapy with ondansetron and tramadol had been 
initiated 2 days previously, vomiting and loss of 
consciousness in a patient who had a large intra-
cranial hemorrhage at study entry, and hypoten-
sion during the infusion of idarucizumab that 
was reported as an anaphylactic reaction. An ad-
ditional case of anaphylaxis, which was character-
ized by rash, vomiting, respiratory distress, and 
loss of consciousness, was reported in a patient 
who was receiving amoxicillin.
Other Safety Outcomes
Serious adverse events that occurred within 5 days 
after the administration of idarucizumab were 
reported in 117 patients (23.3%): 66 in group A 
(21.9%) and 51 in group B (25.2%). Events that 
occurred at a frequency of at least 1% in either 
group are listed in Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Most of the events appeared to be a 
worsening of the index event or a coexisting condi-
tion. No other consistent pattern emerged. In 
group A, the most frequent event was delirium 
(which occurred in 2.3% of the patients); in group 
B, the most frequent events were cardiac arrest and 
septic shock (which occurred in 3.5% and 3.0% 
of the patients, respectively).
Discussion
The results of the RE-VERSE AD study show that, 
among 503 patients who were receiving dabigat-
ran, had uncontrolled bleeding or were about to 
undergo an urgent procedure, and had a prolonged 
diluted thrombin time at baseline, idarucizumab 
reversed anticoagulation rapidly and completely (to 
a median maximum percentage of 100%) in more 
than 98% of the patients. A single 5-g dose of 
idarucizumab was sufficient in 98% of the pa-
tients, and reversal was maintained for 24 hours 
in most patients. The robust, rapid, and durable 
reversal observed in this study is consistent with 
the results of an interim analysis in this study 
and with the results of studies of the use of idar-
ucizumab in healthy volunteers.2,10,11
The study protocol, which was designed to 
mimic routine emergency care and to avoid delay 
in treatment, did not mandate that the results of

Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal
baseline coagulation tests had to be available be-
fore idarucizumab was administered. Therefore, 
some patients had normal clotting times at en-
try. The safety of idarucizumab observed in this 
study supports its urgent use even if patients 
later prove to have had little or no circulating 
dabigatran.
Among patients with overt bleeding who could 
be evaluated in the first 24 hours, the median 
time to the cessation of bleeding was 2.5 hours. 
The administration of idarucizumab enabled sur-
gery or an intervention in 197 of the 202 patients 
in group B; the median time to the initiation of 
the procedure was 1.6 hours, and 95% had nor-
mal or mildly abnormal hemostasis during the 
procedure. Therefore, the use of idarucizumab 
permitted rapid and safe intervention in the ma-
jority of patients.
The most likely explanation for a recurrent 
elevation in clotting time, which was seen mainly 
between 12 and 24 hours after treatment in 114 
patients, is redistribution of unbound dabigatran 
from the extravascular to the intravascular com-
partment. However, recurrent elevation was as-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
sociated with bleeding in only 10 patients. There-
fore, among patients with a recurrent elevation in 
clotting time, only those with new-onset or re-
current bleeding should be considered for a 
second dose of idarucizumab.
The 30-day mortality rate was similar in group 
A and group B (13.5% and 12.6%, respectively), as 
was the 90-day mortality rate (18.8% and 18.9%, 
respectively). Patients enrolled in this study were 
elderly, had numerous coexisting conditions, and 
presented with serious index events, such as in-
tracranial hemorrhage, multiple trauma, sepsis, 
acute abdomen, or open fracture. Most of the 
deaths that occurred within 5 days after enroll-
ment appeared to be related to the severity of the 
index event or to coexisting conditions (e.g., re-
spiratory failure or multiple organ failure), where-
as deaths that occurred after 30 days were more 
likely to be independent events or related to coex-
isting conditions. The 30-day mortality rate ob-
served in this study is lower than the 30-day 
mortality rate of 50% observed among patients 
who were receiving warfarin and presented with 
intracranial hemorrhage and than the 30-day 
mortality rate of 30% observed among patients 
who were receiving warfarin and were about to 
undergo emergency intervention.12-17 However, it 
is similar to the 30-day mortality rate of 15% 
observed among the first 67 patients enrolled in 
a study of andexanet for the reversal of factor Xa 
inhibitors in patients with serious bleeding.18
The rate of thrombotic events was 4.8% at 30 
days and 6.8% at 90 days, and the 30-day rate 
was similar in group A and group B (5.0% and 
4.6%, respectively). These rates are consistent with 
those reported after major surgical procedures or 
hospitalization for uncontrolled bleeding.16,17 The 
low rate of reinitiation of anticoagulation, particu-
larly in group A, may have contributed to the 
thrombotic events. Idarucizumab has a half-life 
of approximately 45 minutes,10 and all the throm-
botic events that occurred within 72 hours after 
its administration occurred in patients in whom 
anticoagulation had not been restarted. Subse-
quent thrombotic events are more likely to reflect 
the underlying prothrombotic state than to be a 
direct effect of reversal, because idarucizumab 
had no procoagulant activity when it was given to 
animals and healthy human volunteers.10,11
Rates of thrombosis after the administration of 
idarucizumab are lower than those reported in 
studies evaluating prothrombin complex concen-
trate for the reversal of vitamin K antagonists.12,16,17 
For example, in one such study, the 30-day rate of 
thrombotic events was 7.8%.17 The 30-day rate of 
thrombotic events in this study was lower than the 
rates of 18% and 12% that were observed among 
the first 67 and 102 patients, respectively, who re-
ceived andexanet in the ANNEXA-4 (Andexanet 
Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Ef-
fects of FXA Inhibitors) study.18,19
The strengths of this study include the broad 
inclusion criteria and the pragmatic study design, 
which reflects usual clinical practice. With this 
pragmatic design, patients with uncontrolled 
bleeding due to trauma could be enrolled in 
group A or group B at the discretion of the treat-
ing physician, depending on the urgency of any 
planned surgery. The major limitation of this 
study is the lack of a control group. Although 
guidelines recommend prothrombin complex con-
centrate for dabigatran reversal if idarucizumab is 
unavailable,20 high-quality evidence of its effective-
ness is limited.
In summary, idarucizumab is effective for 
dabigatran reversal among patients who have 
uncontrolled bleeding or will be undergoing ur-
gent surgery. Although case reports suggest that 
thrombolysis and thrombectomy can be per-
formed safely after dabigatran reversal with idar-
ucizumab,21 postmarketing surveillance would be 
helpful to monitor the effectiveness of idaruci-
zumab for this and other indications and to fur-
ther assess its safety.
