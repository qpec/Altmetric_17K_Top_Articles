Background: Phone triaging patients with suspected malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)
within the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) system offers a model for rapid,
expert guided evaluation for patients with rare and treatable diseases within a national
integrated healthcare system. To assess feasibility of national open access telephone triage
using evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with MPM, measure
timelines of the triage and referral process and record the impact on “intent to treat” for
patients using our service.
Methods: A retrospective study. The main outcome measures were: (1) ability to perform
long distance phone triage, (2) to assess the speed of access to a mesothelioma surgical
specialist for patients throughout the entire VHA, and (3) to determine if access to a
specialist would alter the plan of care.
Results: Sixty veterans were screened by our phone triage program, 38 traveled an
average of 997 miles to VA Boston Healthcare system. On average, 14 d elapsed from
initial phone contact until the patient was physically evaluated in our general thoracic
clinic in Boston. The treatment plan was altered for 71% of patients evaluated at VA
Boston Healthcare system based on 2012 International Mesothelioma Interest Group
guidelines.
Conclusions: Our initial experience demonstrates that in-network centralized care
for Veterans with MPM is feasible within the VHA. National open access phone
triage improves access to expert surgical advice and can be delivered in a timely manner
for Veterans using our service. Guideline-based treatment recommendations (“intent
to treat”) changed the therapeutic course for the majority of patients who used our
service.

 Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and often
rapidly fatal disease. In the United States, there are an esti-
mated 2500 new cases diagnosed annually.1,2 A study that
included veterans found 88% of male patients that developed
MPM were exposed to asbestos.3 Asbestos was widely used for
insulation in the United States until the 1970s. Many veterans
of the US Armed Forces served in high-risk occupations
handling asbestos and then pursued similar trades after
discharge.3-7 A 20-y to 40-y lag period is common from expo-
sure to disease; however, the majority of those exposed do not
develop MPM. The annual incidence of MPM diagnosed in
veterans nationally is not readily available; however, multiple
advocacy groups estimate that 30% of new MPM patients in
the United States are veterans.8-11 The Veterans Healthcare
Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated healthcare
system in the United States with >1700 facilities spanning the
50 states, Pacific and Atlantic island territories.12,20
Multiple therapeutic options exist for treating patients
with MPM. A large variability exists nationally in treatment
recommendations offered to MPM patients. These include:
palliative care, adjuvant chemotherapy, maximal cytoreduc-
tive surgery, and multimodality therapy. Surgery is associated
with improved median and long-term survival in select non-
randomized patients.13 In select patients, multimodality
treatment based on the combination of cytoreductive surgery
and other therapies has been shown to provide more durable
outcomes.14,15 The addition of heated cisplatin at 42�C applied
to the thoracic cavity intraoperatively may further improve
overall survival in select patients.15 Maximal cytoreductive
surgery is a high-risk procedure16-18 and is not routinely
available at most referral centers. In 2012, the International
Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMiG) put out a consensus
statement regarding the role of surgery in the treatment of
MPM summarized in Table.16 Initial multidisciplinary evalu-
ation should include a surgeon with expertise in MPM; how-
ever, only a handful of centers nationally have surgeons with
similar expertise.
In 2011, we established an open access phone triage system
at the Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System
(VABHS) for all Veterans within the VHA that sought our
advice. Our objective was to pilot in-network open access to
high-quality, evidenced-based advice assessing the need, ef-
fect on diagnosis and therapy.
Methods
This is a retrospective study based on data review of all pa-
tients who used our phone triage, between January 2011 and
January 2015 at VABHS. A general thoracic surgeon with spe-
cialty training and a clinical focus on MPM conducted open
access phone triage for affected veterans. Figure 1 graphically
represents the sequence of events after the initiation of con-
tact between the veteran and VABHS thoracic surgery.
Patients contacted a general thoracic surgeon at VABHS
directly. During the initial phone interview which lasted
approximately an hour, it was determined if the patient was
indeed a US Veteran with VA health benefits and had a
possible diagnosis of MPM. Once confirmed, a medical release
form was sent to the section of thoracic surgery at VABHS,
thus allowing access to the veteran’s electronic medical re-
cord. Patients from outside of the New England network
(known as Veterans Integrated Service Network 1 within the
VHA) gave written consent for their record to be accessed.
Source data that included imaging, pathology, and out-of-
network records were sent through overnight FedEx. After
the data were compiled with the help of our nurse practi-
tioner, and administrative assistant, it was reviewed with
radiologists and pathologists who have expertise in MPM.
Once a treatment plan was formulated, we contacted the pa-
tient with initial recommendations for travel to an evaluation
by the senior author at VABHS. Travel and housing were
facilitated by the Veteran’s regional VA healthcare system at
the point of origin in addition to our administrative assistant.
Each travel case is reviewed on a case-by-case basis for
medical necessity, annual income, the level of disability, and
compensation for each veteran. Once at VABHS, on-campus
housing is provided free-of-charge to the Veteran at the
Huntington House and/or Fisher House. In most instances,
additional testing is scheduled in Boston 2-3 d before the
actual
examination
with
the
general
thoracic
surgeon
including: chest magnetic resonance imaging, positron emis-
sion tomographyecomputed tomography, chest computed
tomography, and physiologic performance tests (cardiac
stress test, echocardiogram with estimated pulmonary arte-
rial pressure, pulmonary function, and ventilation or perfu-
sion scan). The Veteran’s motivations and wishes were
incorporated with the relevant data, physiologic testing, and
risk assessment to create a final recommendation. All patients
were then presented at the VABHS thoracic tumor board. Pa-
tients and families were encouraged to attend an educational
seminar extensively reviewing MPM by the International Me-
sothelioma Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Table e 2012 IMiG guidelines summarized.16
Topic
Recommendation
Patient
selection
Patients should be evaluated by multidisciplinary
team including: medical oncology, radiation
oncology, and surgery
Surgery
Complete gross resection and control of
micrometastatic disease are a vital role
“Operations should be performed by surgeons who
have achieved morbidity and mortality within the
scope of the current literature”
Cytoreduction (i.e., intraoperative heated chemo) is
indicated when macroscopic complete resection is
deemed achievable
Type of surgery (EPP versus P/D) is dependent on
clinical judgment and surgeon experience
Diagnosis
PET CT, MRI, and lymph node sampling should be
performed before resection
A tissue biopsy identifying MPM should be acquired
before surgery
MPM ¼ malignant pleural mesothelioma; EPP ¼ extra pleural
pneumonectomy; P/D ¼ pleurectomy decortication.

VABHS academic affiliate. The main outcome measures were:
(1) to assess the feasibility of open access nationwide phone
triage, (2) to assess the timeliness from initial contact to
consultation at VABHS, and (3) to assess the impact of
specialist consultation on the ultimate plan of care.
Results
Seventy-four patients contacted our phone triage for treat-
ment advice with MPM, and we excluded 19% (14/74) who
were not US Veterans. Our cohort consists of 60 veterans,
whose average age was 68 y and all were males. After initial
phone contact and screening, it took an average of 14 � 10.3 d
until face-to-face surgical consultation. During this time, we
gathered and reviewed source data, confirmed MPM diag-
nosis, and excluded nonsurgical candidates. About 63.3%
(n ¼ 38) of the veterans traveled to VABHS. And 34% were
from New England (our catchment area and six states), the
remainder, from 20 additional states as far as Alaska (see
map given in Fig. 2). The average distance traveled was 997
miles.
Of the 38 veterans who traveled to VABHS for consul-
tation, 27 (71%) had their initial care plan altered based on
2012 IMiG guidelines (Table), 30 veterans who appeared to
be surgical candidates were further staged with a cervical

 mediastinoscopy at
VABHS. On completion of clinical
staging, definitive treatment recommendations were made.
Figure 3A demonstrates intent-to-treat before phone triage,
while Figure 3B demonstrates our recommendations. The
majority of the patients traveling to VABHS for MPM
consultation were initially prescribed chemotherapy only,
followed by palliative therapy. Only 10.5% of the veterans
were offered surgery locally, and all these patients lived in
New England. This is in contrast to our intent-to-treat
recommendation
of
surgery
(76.3%).
The
diagnosis
of
MPM was changed for four patients who traveled to VABHS;
three patients had benign pleural disease and one patient
had
poorly
differentiated
nonesmall-cell
lung
cancer
(on
additional
biopsies).
We
recommended
definitive
chemotherapy or palliative care for 13% of the veterans
whom we examined and arranged for care at their point of
origin.
Patient flow to our MPM phone triage had a distinct and
nontraditional referral pattern. Our analysis demonstrated
that the 53% of veterans and/or their families discovered the
VABHS mesothelioma service using internet resources8-11 and
were in essence “self-referred.” Overall, 24% of the veterans
were referred by a medical provider, 5% on our website, and
18% did not have known referral data. Most patients state that
they called our service after reading about it on the internet.
Currently, our government website19 is fourth in a Google
search (using terms mesothelioma and Boston) while patient
advocates linked to sponsored mesothelioma websites make
up 29/30 sites.
Discussion
In 2011, we established an open access phone triage system at
VABHS for all veterans who sought our advice. Striving to
improve access to care within the VHA, we reviewed our 5-y
pilot project assessing our initial ability to provide in-
network, open access evidenced-based advice. This promp-
ted us to then assess our ability to triage patients, review
source data and when indicated, bring the veteran for
consultation in a timely manner. Rather than instructing all
potential patients to simply make arrangements to visit
VABHS, the mesothelioma phone triage program was devel-
oped to screen which patients may benefit from a visit to
VABHS and which patients may not. We looked at the con-
sultation’s effect on diagnosis and the intent-to-treat recom-
mendations when compared with those made by local tumor
boards, many of which lacked surgical input from surgeons
with expertise in MPM.
Mesothelioma affects veterans disproportionately when
compared with the general US population; they constitute less
than 7% of the population but account for approximately 30%
of new patients.8-11 As the largest integrated healthcare sys-
tem in the United States, the VHA treats 8.76 million eligible
veterans annually.
The median survival of MPM is associated with treatment
therapy and stage: palliative care is 5-7 mo,21 chemotherapy
11.4-12.1 mo,22 and cytoreductive surgery 18-30 mo.13 In select
patients, multimodality treatment based on the combination

 of maximal cytoreductive surgery and other therapies has
been shown to provide more durable outcomes.14,15 Maximal
cytoreductive surgery is a high-risk procedure14-17 and is not
routinely available at the majority of referral centers. Surgical
mortality is variable but can be unacceptably high17; however,
centers with surgical expertise report very different results.13-
16,18 After achieving maximal cytoreductive surgery, the
addition of intraoperative heated cisplatin (42�C) applied to
the thoracic cavity, may further improve overall survival in
select patients.15 In 2012, an expert consensus regarding the
role of surgery in the treatment of MPM was reached based on
the opinions of 500 clinicians and researchers with expertise
in mesothelioma.16 The linchpin of the recommendations is a
general thoracic (noncardiac) surgeon with familiarity with
MPM surgery and acceptable surgical morbidity and mortality.
For the appropriate patient, surgery if done by a general
thoracic surgeon with MPM experience is thought to offer the
best overall chance of long-term survival. Within the United
States, and the VHA specifically, MPM patients are often seen
by multidisciplinary care teams that must weigh multiple
therapeutic options. Hence, a large national variability exists
regarding treatment recommendations. The minority of VHA
facilities have chest surgeons who focus on general thoracic
surgery with even fewer offering in-house maximal cytore-
ductive surgery. This is despite the relatively high incidence of
MPM in veterans; VABHS is one of only two centers that
regularly offer in-network surgical resection for veterans with
MPM. Bracketing the United States with VABHS is the West
Los Angeles VA medical center. Both centers have surgeons
who participated in the IMiG meeting and consensus.
The phone triage, collection of records, and re-evaluation
of
source data were laborious, often
occurring beyond
accepted work hours. Overall, 19% (14/74) of patients who
contacted our service were not US Veterans; many were pa-
tients seeking “expert surgical advice” on available treatment
options after being told that they had a median survival of 6-
12 mo by their local oncologist. After initial phone contact and
screening, the process illustrated in the flow chart was initi-
ated, and source data were sent and re-evaluated. We expe-
ditiously gathered and reviewed source data, confirmed
pathologic diagnosis of MPM, and excluded nonsurgical can-
didates. Only after thorough re-evaluation, we did make a
recommendation to hesitant 68-y-old veterans to travel an
average 997 miles from 26 states, even Alaska (see map given
in Fig. 2). In our study, most veterans (66%) were from outside
our (six states) New England catchment area, traveling well
beyond the traditional logistic chain of a regional Veteran
Hospital system.
We examined 63.3% (n ¼ 38) of telephone-screened pa-
tients to VABHS for a face-to-face surgical consultation within
an average of 14 calendar days (�10.3). Taking into account
the workings of source data re-evaluation, availability of staff,
time to arrange testing, the distance traveled, and the veter-
ans availability, we feel that this is a very reasonable time
from initial phone contact to consult. We arranged VA hous-
ing for all veterans and close family members for the duration
of the evaluation. Typically, the majority arrived in Boston 2-
3 d before consultation to complete testing. The added work-
load provided by the thoracic team and multiple additional
providers at VABHS required an estimated at 5-10 h per pa-
tient. It was done with approval and support of administration
at VABHS. Hard data on time spent to facilitate screening are
unavailable for retrospective calculation.
All MPM patients whom we evaluated through phone
triage had undergone initial evaluation in a multidisciplinary
setting locally. Based on intent-to-treat recommendations,
89.5% of veterans that contacted our service and later came for
surgical evaluation were considered “nonsurgical candidates”
by local multidisciplinary teams. The majority were told they
were too old, too sick, or had disease that was too advanced. It
was interesting to note that the only veterans “initially”
offered surgery by their local tumor board lived in New En-
gland. This may be partially linked to the increased local and
regional awareness to MPM and the impact of the Interna-
tional Mesothelioma Program as well as our VABHS program
on practice and referral patterns. This is in stark contrast, to
patients in the remaining 20 states that we evaluated. On
completion of staging, all patients were presented at our
multidisciplinary tumor board. We recommended surgical
resection for 76.5% of those that completed consultation at
VABHS. Our phone triage enabled centralized expert evalua-
tion and care for veterans with MPM, which is a rare disease.

 In addition, the diagnosis of MPM was changed in four pa-
tients who traveled to VABHS: three patients ultimately had
benign pleural disease (no treatment indicated), while one
patients had poorly differentiated nonsmall cell (stage IV)
with a different therapy indicated.
Analysis of patient flow to our phone triage was nontradi-
tional. The majority of veterans and/or their families discov-
ered our services by using Google. They learned of our service
through “internet resources,9-11 and they are in essence “self-
referred.” On the other hand, only a quarter of the veterans
were referred by a medical care provider. After realizing this,
we built a government website: (http://www.boston.va.gov/
services/surgical/Asbestos_and_Mesothelioma.asp).19
This
approach took time to obtain approval at VABHS, but since
coming online last year, it has contributed to 5% of our cohort.
With some optimization, the site ranks as high as fourth in
Google searches (using search terms mesothelioma and Bos-
ton). This is in contrast to sites run by patient advocates who
are linked to mesothelioma websites which make up 29 of 30 of
the initial websites encountered when searching available
treatment options. Based on our interactions with VA physi-
cians outside VABHS, the majority appeared to learn of our
program and of the various MPM treatment options from the
veterans and their families. Few had knowledge of the two
mesothelioma programs within the VHA. We know that our
efforts have stricken a chord with our veterans, as there has
been numerous letters of gratitude to the Secretary of the VA,
Senators and regional VHA directors.
The process of triaging within the framework of the VHA
may not only provide insight into MPM in the veteran popu-
lation but also highlights how a large federal entity may make
itself more flexible and agile to keep pace with current
healthcare trends that focus on instant access to definitive
care. The variation of MPM treatment created a need within
the VHA for specialized, patient-centric care that is stream-
lined and up-to-date. This approach at times contradicts the
regional and geographic boundaries of the current VHA ar-
chitecture. For this reason, the pilot phone triage program for
MPM at VABHS is labor intensive at every step requiring
numerous dedicated staff and leadership support.
Our cohort has many limitations, but most important, the
true number and incidence in veterans with MPM is unknown.
Our cohort is also small. Most veterans with MPM “seeking”
our advice are likely a select group within the VHA refusing to
accept a 6-12 median survival offered locally. They all proac-
tively sought surgical care, traveling far for a possible better
outcome. Patients with severe comorbidities, lack of motiva-
tion to undergo major surgery, and metastatic disease were
excluded. Major barriers were identified in provider education
and internet presence.
Conclusions
Open access phone triage for veterans with MPM is possible,
enabling timely specialized evidence-based care nationally.
Logistical hurdles were overcome, expert evaluation changed
the treatment recommendations (“intent-to-treat”) for most
veterans who were encouraged to travel for consultation. We
demonstrated that in a federal system, a multidisciplinary
team of experts can be assembled and motivated to deliver
quaternary centralized care that is typically possible only in a
handful of elite teaching hospitals.
