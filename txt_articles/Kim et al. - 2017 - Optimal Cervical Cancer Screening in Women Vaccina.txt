Abstract
Background: Current US cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate recommendations based on a woman’s
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status. Changes to cervical cancer screening policies in HPV-vaccinated women
should be evaluated.
Methods: We utilized an individual-based mathematical model of HPV and cervical cancer in US women to project the
health benefits, costs, and harms associated with screening strategies in women vaccinated with the bivalent, quadri-
valent, or nonavalent vaccine. Strategies varied by the primary screening test, including cytology, HPV, and combined
cytology and HPV “cotesting”; age of screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between routine
screens. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that
would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year
(QALY) gained.
Results: Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, optimal screening strategies involved
either cytology or HPV testing alone every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from
$34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with ex-
ceedingly high cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only primary HPV testing was ef-
ficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years
($127 010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was
optimal. Importantly, current US guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.
Conclusions: This model-based analysis suggests screening can be modified to start at later ages, occur at decreased fre-
quency, and involve primary HPV testing in HPV-vaccinated women, providing more health benefit at lower harms and costs
than current screening guidelines.
In 2012, cervical cancer screening guidelines were harmonized
across major guideline-making organizations (1,2), emphasizing
two provisions that marked a trend toward less intensive
screening: 1) routine cervical screening should not begin before
age 21 years, irrespective of age of sexual initiation, and 2) rou-
tine cytology testing should not occur more frequently than ev-
ery three years, with an option to switch to cytology and HPV
testing (“cotesting”) every five years at age 30 years. These
changes have been motivated by a better understanding of the
role of human papillomavirus (HPV), a highly prevalent sexually
transmitted infection, in the development of cervical cancer.
With the availability of HPV vaccines and recommendations
for routine vaccination of young girls since 2007, the burden of
cervical cancer is expected to decrease, providing even more op-
portunity to further revise screening guidelines. The bivalent
and quadrivalent vaccines target the two most carcinogenic
HPV types, 16 and 18, which contribute to roughly 70% of cervi-
cal cancer cases worldwide; the quadrivalent vaccine also

 targets noncarcinogenic HPV types 6 and 11, which cause most
genital warts. In clinical trials, both vaccines have demon-
strated nearly 100% protection against vaccine-type infections
and high-grade precancers in recipients who had received all
three doses prior to HPV exposure (3–5). A nonavalent vaccine
targeting seven carcinogenic types that contribute to 90% of cer-
vical cancer cases (HPV-16/18/31/33/45/52/58) plus HPV-6/11 has
recently been licensed and recommended based on evidence of
similarly high vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity (6,7).
Despite the expectation that HPV vaccination will reduce
cervical cancer risk among recipients, current guidelines do not
differentiate cervical screening recommendations based on a
woman’s vaccination status. Reasons against changing screen-
ing policy in HPV-vaccinated women have include: 1) the low
uptake of HPV vaccination in the United States, below 50% for
completion of all three doses (8); 2) uncertain quality of docu-
mentation for an individual’s vaccination history (ie, type of
vaccine received, vaccination age, dosage timing); and 3) limited
observations of real-world vaccine effectiveness in reducing
prevalence of infection and precancer (9). However, as the initial
cohorts of vaccinated women enter screening age and as we ob-
serve increasing empirical evidence of vaccine impact in the
United States (10–12), the question of how to modify cervical
cancer
screening
in
HPV-vaccinated
populations
becomes
critical.
Given the long, chronic course of cervical disease progres-
sion, spanning decades between initial HPV infection and inva-
sive
cancer,
decisions
regarding
optimal
cervical
cancer
prevention strategies must be made before their impact on
long-term
outcomes
is
observed.
Policy-makers
have
increasingly relied on mathematical models to simulate the
burden of disease in a population and to project both health
and economic outcomes under realistic and “what if” scenarios.
Using a disease simulation model of HPV and cervical cancer in
US women, we evaluated how cervical cancer screening policies
may be optimized in women vaccinated against HPV. In addi-
tion to assessing the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies,
we report both benefits and harms to showcase the clinical and
public health trade-offs that may be useful to various decision-
makers.
Methods
Mathematical Model
Using an individual-based microsimulation model of HPV and
cervical cancer, we projected health and economic outcomes
associated with screening in women vaccinated by the bivalent
or quadrivalent vaccine (HPV-2 or HPV-4, respectively), or the
nonavalent vaccine (HPV-9). Individual girls enter the model at
an early age (ie, 9 years) prior to HPV acquisition and transition
between
mutually
exclusive
health
states
that
represent
clinically relevant stages of cervical disease (Supplementary
Figure 1, available online) (13,14). Transitions to and from the
HPV health states are governed by persistence of type-specific
infection (ie, time since HPV acquisition) and can vary by factors
such as age, history of prior HPV infection, and patterns of vac-
cination and screening. Given the individual-level simulation,
the model can closely mirror complex screening algorithms and

†HPV testing strategy involves detection of high-risk HPV types with HPV-16/18 genotype information; cotesting strategy involves combined cytology and HPV testing
for primary screening; routine screening for all strategies ends at age 65 years. Management of women with abnormal screening results was assumed to follow clinical
guidelines and includes: for cytology testing, reflex HPV testing for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and referral to colpos-
copy for women with more severe abnormal results; for HPV testing, referral to colposcopy for women positive for HPV-16/18 and cytology triage for women positive
for other high-risk HPV (those with ASCUS or worse are referred to colposcopy, while those with normal cytology return for follow-up testing in 12 months); and for
cotesting, HPV-16/18 genotype testing for women with cytology-negative, HPV-positive results (1,21,22).

 keeps track of each individual woman’s health status and
resource use over time, which are then aggregated at the
population level.
Baseline model parameter values were estimated from large
epidemiologic studies (13,15–17), and uncertain model parame-
ters were calibrated to fit observed data from the United States,
including HPV prevalence and type distribution among women
with precancer and cancer (18–20). In order to reflect the uncer-
tainty in the natural history inputs, we utilized the 50 top-
fitting parameter sets for all analyses and calculated the
expected value, as well as a range of values, for all outcomes.
Descriptions of the model development process, including pa-
rameter estimation, model calibration, and model validation,
have been previously published (13,14); details of model inputs
and calibration results for this particular analysis are provided
in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 2, available online).
Strategies
Screening strategies were evaluated separately for women who
were fully vaccinated with either HPV-2,-4 or HPV-9 (Table 1).
In addition to the two current guidelines-based screening strat-
egies involving cytology testing and cotesting, we also included
options for primary HPV testing with HPV-16/18 genotype
information, which was recently approved by the US Food and
Drug
Administration
in
women
age
25
years
and
older.
Strategies varied by the age of screening initiation, age of
switching to a new test, and interval between routine screens.
Triage
and
management
approaches
for
screen-positive
women were assumed to be consistent with current guidelines
(1,21,22). In all scenarios, routine screening discontinued after
age 65 years.
We assumed that the recommended full three-dose series of
any of the three vaccines occurred at age 12 years, prior to HPV
exposure, resulting in high (100%) efficacy against vaccine-
targeted HPV-16 and -18 types, consistent with per-protocol
clinical trial results (3–5). For women vaccinated with the nona-
valent vaccine, we additionally assumed that efficacy against
HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 was 96.0%, consistent with re-
cent reports from a phase III study (6). A lower-bound estimate
of 90% efficacy against all vaccine-targeted HPV types was ex-
plored in sensitivity analysis. Vaccine-induced protection was
assumed to be life-long for all vaccines, with the presumption
that extended efficacy could be achieved with or without boos-
ter doses.
To identify the optimal screening strategy in these groups of
vaccinated women, we assumed women perfectly complied
with the screening interval assigned, as well as follow-up proce-
dures. Input values for screening test characteristics were based
on current data and were assumed to be unchanged in vacci-
nated cohorts (Supplementary Table 2, available online). In sen-
sitivity analysis, we evaluated the impact of diagnostic error
and precancer treatment effectiveness. Cost inputs included di-
rect medical costs associated with screening, diagnostic colpos-
copy with biopsy, treatment of precancer and invasive cancer
(eg, personnel, tests, procedures), and vaccination (eg, three
doses, wastage, supplies, and administration), as well as pa-
tient time and transportation costs. The cost per dose for
HPV-2,-4 and HPV-9 was $120 and $135, respectively, based
on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (public
sector) cost (23).
Analysis
Main model outcomes included 1) health benefits, in terms of
reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer and gains in
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), reflecting both mortality
and diminished quality of life due to cervical cancer; 2) lifetime
costs, including intervention costs incurred, as well as cost off-
sets due to disease prevented; and 3) screening harms, in terms
of the rate of colposcopy referral per 1000 women screened over
the lifetime (1). Outcomes were calculated from the age of 21
years, the earliest age of screening initiation. In the base case,
we conducted separate analyses for women vaccinated with
HPV-2,-4 and with HPV-9, assuming vaccination status at the in-
dividual level is readily available. However, because individual-
level vaccination status is not always known, we also examined
scenarios in which a single population-based screening policy is
chosen based on a heterogeneous mix of unvaccinated and vac-
cinated women to explore important thresholds of vaccination
uptake at which screening policy changes may be warranted.
We used cost-effectiveness analysis as a guide to identify
screening strategies that are good value for money for each vac-
cinated subgroup. After eliminating strategies that were more
costly and less effective (ie, strongly dominated) or less costly
and less cost-effective (ie, weakly dominated) than an alterna-
tive strategy, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were
calculated as the additional cost divided by the additional
health benefit associated with one strategy compared with the
next less costly strategy. Across the 50 top-fitting parameter
sets, the ICER was calculated as the ratio of the mean cost di-
vided by the mean health effect (ie, ratio of the means) (24). We
used a range of suggested cost-effectiveness thresholds (ie, $50
000, $100 000, and $200 000 per QALY gained) as a benchmark to
indicate
strategies
that
are
good
value
for
money
(25).
Consistent with US guidelines, we adopted a societal perspec-
tive and discounted costs and QALYs by 3% annually (26).
Results
Optimal Screening in Women Vaccinated With HPV-2
Or HPV-4
The trade-off of health benefits and costs for all 25 strategies
evaluated among women who had been fully vaccinated with
HPV-2 or HPV-4 in pre-adolescence is displayed in Figure 1 (nu-
meric results are provided in Supplementary Table 3, available
online). For the strategy of vaccination alone without screening,
the mean reduction in lifetime cervical cancer risk was proj-
ected to be 64.6%, compared with no intervention; the addition
of screening strategies considerably improved cancer benefit,
ranging from 88% to 98% lifetime risk reduction. Both QALYs
and lifetime costs increased with higher screening frequency
and younger age of screening initiation.
Cytology-only screening every five years starting at age 35
years had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio of $20 950 per
QALY, compared with vaccination alone. At thresholds of $50
000 or $100 000 per QALY, optimal strategies involved five-year
screening starting at age 30 years with either cytology or HPV
testing, respectively. At a higher threshold of $200 000 per
QALY, HPV testing every five years starting at age 25 years was
the optimal strategy for women vaccinated with HPV-2 or HPV-

 (irrespective of frequency) was either not cost-effective or had
cost-effectiveness ratios that exceeded $200 000 per QALY
gained. Importantly, the currently recommended strategies of
cytology testing every three years starting at age 21 years with
or without a switch to cotesting at age 30 years were inefficient,
and under no conditions was cotesting attractive.
Optimal Screening in Women Vaccinated With HPV-9
The mean reduction in lifetime risk of cervical cancer was 85.3%
in women vaccinated with HPV-9, compared with no interven-
tion; with screening, cancer reductions ranged from 91% to 99%
(Figure 2; Supplementary Table 4, available online). Given the
lower baseline disease risk in women vaccinated with HPV-9,
the optimal screening strategies involved later start ages and
lower frequencies than for women vaccinated with HPV-2 or
HPV-4. Furthermore, only strategies that involved primary HPV
testing were efficient. For example, at a threshold of $50 000 per
QALY, HPV testing every 10 years starting at age 35 years was
the most cost-effective strategy with a ratio of $40 210 per
QALY, compared with one-time HPV testing at age 40 years,
which had a lower ratio of $18 010 per QALY. At a higher
threshold of $200 000 per QALY, HPV testing every 10 years was
still optimal but at an earlier start age of 30 years. Strategies
that started earlier (age 21 or 25 years) and/or were more
frequent than every 10 years had exceedingly high cost-
effectiveness ratios (ie, above $200 000 per QALY) or were domi-
nated, including HPV testing every three years starting at age 25
years, a strategy recommended by some societies (22).
Cancer Reduction vs Colposcopy Rate
We further compared the relative harms and benefits in terms
of colposcopy referrals and reductions in lifetime cervical can-
cer risk for the screening strategies found to be cost-effective, as
well as the current guidelines-based strategies (Figure 3). Not
surprisingly, more intensive strategies were associated with
higher colposcopy referrals rates and also higher cancer benefit.
In women vaccinated with HPV-2 or HPV-4, colposcopy rates for
strategies that were found to be efficient (ie, not dominated)
ranged from 249 to 880 per 1000 women screened (Figure 3, top
panel). Screening that involved HPV testing, either alone or as
part of cotesting, was associated with higher colposcopy rates
than cytology-only strategies.

 In women vaccinated with HPV-9, colposcopy rates were far
lower, ranging from 11 to 228 per 1000 women screened, among
the efficient screening strategies (Figure 3, bottom panel).
Although at low absolute rates, shifting from HPV testing one
time at age 40 years to every 10 years starting at age 35 years in-
creased the colposcopy rate seven-fold (from 11 to 87 per 1000
women) but also increased cancer benefit (from 90% to 98% re-
duction in lifetime cancer risk). For the remaining efficient
strategies involving higher screening frequency and/or earlier
screening initiation ages, the higher colposcopy rates were ac-
companied by minimal improvements in cancer benefit. In both
vaccinated populations, the two current guidelines-based strat-
egies had lower benefit and higher colposcopy rates than alter-
native strategies.
Sensitivity Analysis
All analyses were conducted with 50 calibrated parameter sets
to reflect the underlying uncertainty in the natural history data,
enabling a range of results to be reported (Supplementary
Tables 3 and 4, available online). We found that the rank order-
ing of the screening strategies was stable over the 50 sets in
both HPV-2,-4- and HPV-9-vaccinated populations and that the
optimal strategies identified under each cost-effectiveness
threshold were unchanged in the majority of simulations.
Results were also robust when we varied vaccine efficacy, diag-
nostic test performance, and precancer treatment effectiveness,
with only slight changes in the cost-effectiveness ratios. The
only exception was when efficacy against all vaccine-targeted
HPV types in HPV-9 was reduced, in which the optimal initiation
ages of 35 and 30 years in the base case scenario shifted to ear-
lier ages of 30 years (ie, $35 310 per QALY) and 25 years (ie, $128
780 per QALY) (Supplementary Figure 3, available online).
When we explored scenarios of mixed vaccination status
within the population, we found that screening every five years
remained the optimal interval at cost-effectiveness thresholds
ranging from $50 000 to $200 000 per QALY when HPV-2 or HPV-
4 uptake was at 50% or greater (Table 2). With increasing propor-
tions of women vaccinated with HPV-2 or HPV-4, optimal

 screening initiation shifted from age 25 to 30 years and primar-
ily involved HPV testing. At the highest cost-effectiveness
threshold of $200 000 per QALY, the optimal strategy consis-
tently was HPV testing starting at age 25 years. When also con-
sidering uptake of HPV-9, HPV testing at a 10-year interval was
uniformly optimal across all uptake assumptions and cost-
effectiveness thresholds (Table 2). At higher proportions of
women vaccinated with HPV-9, the screening start age shifted
to later ages.
Discussion
This analysis supports a reassessment of cervical cancer
screening policies in women who have been vaccinated against
HPV. We found that, given the expected lower risk of cervical
cancer in HPV-vaccinated women, screening can be modified to
start at later ages, occur at decreased frequency, and involve
primary HPV testing. In particular, for women who received the
full three doses of HPV-2 or HPV-4 in pre-adolescence, screening
every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years with cytology or
HPV testing was optimal at recommended cost-effectiveness
thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per QALY gained. In women
fully vaccinated with HPV-9, optimal screening extended to ev-
ery 10 years starting at age 30 or 35 years with HPV testing.
Importantly, these less-intensive strategies provided similar or
higher benefit at lower cost (and lower harms as measured by
colposcopy rates) than keeping with current screening guide-
lines in HPV-vaccinated women, indicating that revisions in
screening policies for vaccinated women are warranted. In both
vaccinated populations, primary HPV testing was competitive
or preferred over cytology testing and cotesting strategies. In
some scenarios, even when administered at lower intensity,
HPV testing outperformed (ie, yielded greater health benefit
than) cytology alone; this is because of the higher clinical sensi-
tivity of HPV testing vs cytology, which offset the lower benefit
associated with a later start age and/or less frequent screening.
It is noteworthy that the screening strategies in HPV-
vaccinated women led to nearly equivalent health benefits in
terms of QALYs and reductions in lifetime cancer risk as the
screening intensity increased, especially in women vaccinated
with the nonavalent vaccine. In order to assess the robustness
of strategies with such marginal health benefits, we conducted
all analyses using 50 calibrated parameter sets as a form of
probabilistic sensitivity analysis and found that our main find-
ings were very stable. Optimal screening strategies also re-
mained unchanged when we altered vaccine efficacy and
screening effectiveness. Only when vaccine efficacy was de-
creased for all high-risk HPV types in HPV-9 did the base case
screening initiation shift to an earlier age; however, the 10-year
screening interval in women vaccinated with HPV-9 remained
most efficient throughout.
Our findings for women vaccinated with HPV-2 or HPV-4 are
consistent with previous model-based studies that found op-
portunities to screen less intensively with later start ages, lon-
ger intervals between screens, and HPV testing instead of
cytology (27,28). Our study contributes to this literature in reas-
sessing the value of HPV testing in vaccinated women after its
recent approval for use as a primary screening test in the
United States, and as the first US-based analysis to evaluate
screening in women vaccinated with HPV-9.
Our analysis has important limitations. To guide policy, we
focused on scenarios in which women had been fully vacci-
nated (ie, received all three doses) in pre-adolescence; therefore,
generalizability to women who are vaccinated at later ages or
who receive less than three doses is unclear, although short-
term efficacy data indicate that two-dose, and even one-dose,
vaccination is promising (29,30). Furthermore, we assumed that
women are fully compliant to screening. In reality, behaviors
and practice with respect to screening uptake, diagnostic work-
up, and treatment may vary differentially based on vaccination
status, which may impact the relative cost-effectiveness of the
screening strategies. Analyses will need to be revisited as data
on screening practice in HPV-vaccinated women emerge.
This analysis also focused on women with a known history
of HPV vaccination in pre-adolescence, whereas in many set-
tings, including the United States, HPV vaccination status at the
individual level may not be readily available (ie, type of vaccine
received, age at vaccination, and number of doses). In such
settings, there may be opportunity to optimize screening based
on vaccination uptake at the population level. Our sensitivity

*Table indicates the optimal screening strategy (ie, primary screening test, screening interval, age of screening initiation) under different patterns of human papilloma-
virus (HPV) vaccination uptake in the population. We used a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds (ie, $50 000 to $200 000 per QALY) as benchmarks for good value for
money and to determine the optimal strategies under each scenario (ie, the most effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than the indicated
threshold) (25). Blue shading indicates strategies in which screening initiation occurs at age 25 years; yellow shading, age 30 years; green shading, age 35 years. HPV-2,
HPV-4, and HPV-9 refer to the bivalent, quadrivalent, and nonavalent HPV vaccines, respectively. HPV ¼ human papillomavirus.
†Percent cost-effective refers to the proportions of simulations across the 50 top-fitting parameter sets in which the specified strategy was optimal for the given cost-
effectiveness threshold.

 vaccinated populations was crude given the exclusion of herd
immunity effects among unvaccinated women, resulting in a
likely underestimation of population-level benefit from HPV
vaccination. Nonetheless, our findings support shifting to less
intensive screening than currently recommended even at mod-
erate vaccination uptake rates in the United States. Future anal-
yses
leveraging
HPV
transmission
models
that
reflect
vaccination uptake for both sexes at different ages and across
different birth cohorts will need to incorporate the effects of
herd immunity to identify optimal screening strategies with
greater specificity. It is noteworthy that selecting a universal
cervical cancer screening policy that aims to target the average
risk profile in the population without being able to tailor policies
based on known vaccination status may lead to inefficiencies
and forgone health benefits (ie, among those who are not vacci-
nated and do not benefit from herd immunity); understanding
the value of knowing an individual woman’s vaccination history
will be important in future work as we confront the heterogene-
ity in risk that is being introduced in a population with mixed
vaccination status.
Our analysis did not consider potential changes in screening
test performance in vaccinated women. It is hypothesized that
the test performance of cytology may diminish as HPV preva-
lence decreases as a result of vaccination and as fewer cytologic
samples are positive; these changes would only strengthen our
findings, which already favor primary HPV testing in the major-
ity of scenarios.
We did not capture other health benefits from HPV vaccina-
tion, such as prevention of anogenital warts or other noncervi-
cal HPV-related cancers.
Although
the
inclusion
of these
benefits would improve the overall cost-effectiveness of HPV
vaccination, they are not expected to have any impact on the
comparative or cost-effectiveness of the competing cervical
cancer screening strategies. We only reported on a single mea-
sure of screening harms, colposcopy referrals, which has been
used in guidelines deliberations (1,2). Yet other adverse out-
comes, such as preterm births associated with precancer treat-
ment and decreased quality of life associated with positive
screening results, have also been reported (31–33). This analysis
suggests that modifying screening in HPV-vaccinated women
will result in a substantial decrease in screening procedures,
and therefore inclusion of these adverse outcomes would only
strengthen the argument to de-intensify screening in HPV-
vaccinated women.
Our analysis clearly indicates opportunities to revise cervical
cancer
screening
policies
in
HPV-vaccinated
women.
For
women vaccinated with any of the approved HPV vaccines early
in adolescence—and even in the current US population with
only partial vaccination uptake—our model-based projections
suggest that less-intensive screening algorithms can provide
greater health benefit at lower harms and costs than current
screening guidelines, which do not differentiate recommenda-
tions based on HPV vaccination status.
