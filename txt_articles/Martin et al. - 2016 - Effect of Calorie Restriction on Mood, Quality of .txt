Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Calorie restriction (CR) increases longevity in many species and reduces risk 
factors for chronic diseases. In humans, CR may improve health span, yet concerns remain about 
potential negative effects of CR.
OBJECTIVE—To test the effect of CR on mood, quality of life (QOL), sleep, and sexual function 
in healthy nonobese adults.

 [CALERIE 2]) was conducted at 3 academic research institutions. Adult men and women (N = 
220) with body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 
squared) of 22.0 to 28.0 were randomized to 2 years of 25% CR or an ad libitum (AL) control 
group in a 2:1 ratio favoring CR. Data were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months and 
examined using intent-to-treat analysis. The study was conducted from January 22,2007, to March 
6, 2012. Data analysis was performed from July 18, 2012, to October 27, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS—Two years of 25% CR or AL.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Self-report questionnaires were administered to 
measure mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II], score range 0–63, higher scores indicating 
worse mood, and Profile of Mood States [POMS], with a total mood disturbance score range of 
−32 to 200 and higher scores indicating higher levels of the constructs measured), QOL (Rand 36-
Item Short Form, score range 0–100, higher scores reflecting better QOL, and Perceived Stress 
Scale, score range 0–40, higher scores indicating higher levels of stress), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index [PSQI], total score range 0–21, higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality), and 
sexual function (Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function–Self–report, total score range 24–188, 
higher scores indicating better sexual functioning).
RESULTS—In all, 218 participants (152 women [69.7%]; mean [SD] age, 37.9 (7.2) years; mean 
[SD] BMI, 25.1 [1.6]) were included in the analyses. The CR and AL groups lost a mean (SE) of 
7.6 (0.3) kg and 0.4 (0.5) kg, respectively, at month 24 (P < .001). Compared with the AL group, 
the CR group had significantly improved mood (BDI-II: between-group difference [BGD], −0.76; 
95% CI, −1.41 to −0.11; effect size [ES], −0.35), reduced tension (POMS: BGD, −0.79; 95% CI, 
−1.38 to −0.19; ES, −0.39), and improved general health (BGD, 6.45; 95% CI, 3.93 to 8.98; ES, 
0.75) and sexual drive and relationship (BGD, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.01; ES, 0.35) at month 24 
as well as improved sleep duration at month 12 (BGD, −0.26; 95% CI, −0.49 to −0.02; ES, −0.32) 
(all P < .05). Greater percent weight loss in the CR group at month 24 was associated with 
increased vigor (Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ = −0.30) and less mood disturbance (ρ = 0.27) 
measured with the POMS, improved general health (ρ = −0.27) measured with the SF-36, and 
better sleep quality per the PSQI total score (ρ = 0.28) (all P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In nonobese adults, CR had some positive effects and 
no negative effects on health-related QOL.
Calorie restriction (CR) increases longevity in numerous species1 and, in nonhuman 
primates, it increases health span (length of time the organism is free of disease).2–4 To our 
knowledge, the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of 
Energy Phase 2 (CALERIE 2) trial is the first study to examine the effects of long-term CR 
on disease risk factors and predictors of longevity in nonobese humans. The design5 of 
CALERIE 2, recruitment methods,6 baseline data,7,8 and intervention used to promote long-
term (2-year) CR9 have been described elsewhere. Briefly, CR resulted in metabolic 
adaptation and improvements in chronic disease risk factors, indicating that CR may 
improve the health span of nonobese humans.7 These results raise the possibility that more 
people, including normal-weight people, might attempt to practice CR in an effort to in-
crease lifespan and health span, yet concerns remain about potential negative effects of CR 
on psychological and endocrine outcomes.

 The purpose of the present analysis was to test the hypothesis that, compared with an ad 
libitum (AL) control group, 25% CR for 2 years would improve mood, quality of life 
(QOL), sleep, and sexual function (assessed by self-report and, in men, by reproductive 
hormones). These end points provide a direct test of the effects of CR on aspects of QOL 
that have been hypothesized to be negatively affected by CR, including decreased libido, 
lower stamina, depressed mood, and irritability10; in addition, the study extends the 
literature to a sample that includes nonobese individuals. The inclusion of both self-reported 
and biological (hormone) variables is novel since weight loss or CR among overweight and 
obese samples has been found to improve QOL,11,12 sleep,13 and sexual function,14 
although not all studies found improved sexual function,15 and CR might transiently 
suppress the reproductive axis. In addition, sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) is 
inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus16 and weight loss increases SHBG 
levels,15,17 suggesting that SHBG may have biological functions beyond regulation of free 
sex hormone levels.
Methods
Ethics and Trial Registration
CALERIE Phase 2 was a multisite single-protocol study that followed individual pilot 
studies that were conducted at 3 study sites during CALERIE Phase 1.CALERIE 2 was 
approved by the institutional review boards of Pennington Biomedical Research Center, 
Washington University, Tufts University, and Duke University. The coordinating center was 
at Duke University and data were collected at the other 3 sites. All participants provided 
written informed consent and received financial compensation. A data and safety monitoring 
board provided oversight of the study. The protocol of the study is available in Supplement 
2.
Study Design
The study was a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial comparing 2 years of 25% CR with 
2 years of habitual energy intake on an AL basis. The randomization ratio was 2:1 in favor 
of CR, and randomization was stratified by site, sex, and body mass index (BMI) (calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) dichotomized as normal weight 
(22.0–24.9) or overweight (25.0–27.9). The intervention is described elsewhere9; it relied on 
a mathematical model built from our phase 1 studies to predict weight loss after 1 year as-
suming adherence to 25% CR18 (during year 2, weight loss maintenance was promoted). To 
account for variability in weight loss, a zone of acceptable weight loss for individuals was 
created, and participants were considered adherent if their body weights were within this 
zone.9,18 A weight graph illustrating participants’ weight in relation to their zone was used 
to promote adherence and to trigger additional intervention strategies when needed.9 In 
addition, CR participants received a manual-based curriculum and were provided food for 
the first 27 days of the intervention.

 Participants
Participants were healthy men aged 20 to 50 years and women aged 20 to 47 years, with a 
BMI between 22.0 and 28.0. Screening occurred from January 22, 2007, to November 17, 
2009, and the screening procedures are detailed elsewhere.6 The study was completed on 
March 6, 2012.
Study Assessments
Details on the study procedures and assessments are provided elsewhere.5 Self-report 
questionnaire data and reproductive hormones (men only) were measured at baseline, 12 
months, and 24 months. Percent CR during the study was calculated using the intake balance 
method,7 which relies on simultaneous measures of total daily energy expenditure by doubly 
labeled water and body composition changes.19
Assessment of Mood, Quality of Life, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Sexual Function
Mood was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Profile of Mood 
States (POMS).20 The BDI-II is a reliable and valid measure of mood disturbance, with a 
score range of 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse mood.21 The POMS has 6 
subscales: tension (score range, 0–36), depression (score range, 0–60), anger (score range, 
0–48), fatigue (score range, 0–28), vigor (score range, 0–32), confusion (score range, 0–28), 
and a total mood disturbance score (score range, −32 to 200). The POMS is reliable and 
valid, and higher scores reflect higher levels of the construct being measured by the 
subscale.22
Quality of life was measured with the Rand 36-Item Short Form (SF-36)23 and the Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS).24 The SF-36 has 8 subscales: 4 that measure mental aspects of QOL 
(role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, social functioning, mental health) and 4 
that measure physical aspects of QOL (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical 
problems, bodily pain, general health).23 Scores on the SF-36 range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores reflecting better QOL. The PSS assesses perceived stress and has a score range 
of 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress.24
Perceived sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 
reliable and valid measure of sleep over a 1-month interval.25 The questionnaire yields 7 
subscales (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, 
sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction) and a total score. 
The score range for the PSQI subscales is 0 to 3, and the PSQI total score range is 0 to 21; 
higher scores reflect worse sleep quality.
The Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function–Self-report (DISF-SR) is a reliable and valid 
measure of sexual function.26 It has parallel forms for men and women, 5 subscales (sexual 
cognition and fantasy, sexual arousal, sexual behavior and experience, orgasm, and sexual 
drive and relationship), and a total score. Higher scores indicating better functioning and the 
ranges of scores are: 5 to 45 for the sexual cognition and fantasy subscale, the sexual arousal 
subscale, and the sexual behavior and experience subscale; 5 to 25 for the orgasm score; 4 to 
28 for the sexual drive and relationship score; and 24 to 188 for the total score.

 Assessment of Reproductive Hormones
To test the hypothesis that CR, in men, would result in increased SHBG levels and decreased 
luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, total testosterone, and free testosterone 
levels, these hormones were measured in the early morning after an overnight fast. 
Collection of reproductive hormones in women was not done because of difficulty in 
scheduling testing in the midluteal phase of their menstrual cycles and because many women 
were receiving hormonal contraception. Commercially available kits were used for the 
assays (ADVIA Centaur; Bayer Health Care, and Immulite 1000; Diagnostics Products 
Corp).
Data Analysis
All statistical tests were 2-tailed and, unless otherwise noted, P < .05 was considered the 
level of statistical significance. The statistical methodologies have been described.7 An 
intent-to-treat (ITT) criterion was used. A repeated-measures analysis as implemented under 
mixed models was utilized, with the dependent variable being change to the follow-up time 
points. The independent variables were treatment and time (visit), and the treatment × time 
interaction. Participants were sampled by site, sex, and BMI stratum, and these variables, 
together with the baseline values of the outcome variable being evaluated, were included as 
covariates. Hypotheses of specific interest (eg, between-group differences [BGDs] on 
outcome variable changes at the individual time points) were tested by defining contrasts 
among the regression variables; the predicted mean (SE) changes are the adjusted values 
from this model. Type I error was controlled using a gatekeeping strategy.27 A hierarchical 
structure was identified among the hypotheses of interest (ie, the treatment × time 
interaction) followed by the main effects, followed by specific within- and between-group 
comparisons. Comparisons were performed only at α = .05 if significance was obtained at α 
= .05 at the higher level in the hierarchy. Otherwise, the Bonferroni procedure was used. 
Main effects for sex were also examined, in addition to sex × treatment interactions, and sex 
× treatment × time interactions. A similar approach was adopted for the BMI strata. To 
evaluate the size of changes in health-related QOL between (and within) the groups, Cohen 
d effect size (ES)28 was calculated, which reflects changes in SD units as estimated by the 
model.
Because of insufficient variability or floor or ceiling effects, 7 variables were converted to a 
binary outcome (ie, whether there was a negative change from baseline or not). For these, a 
generalized estimating equation model29,30 was applied using the logit link and the 
Bernoulli variance, assuming the unstructured covariance structure, to determine whether 
there was a negative change from baseline that was related to treatment, time, and the 
interaction of these 2 predictors. In addition, 2 variables had limited variability due to a 
ceiling effect; thus, descriptive data are provided and statistical analysis was not conducted.
Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated in the CR group to determine whether the 
baseline values of the outcome variable were predictive of percent CR and weight change 
(kilograms and percent) from baseline to month 24 (α = .01). Similar analyses determined 
whether percent CR and weight change from baseline to month 24 were associated with 
changes in the outcome variables from baseline to month 24. Data analysis was performed

 using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Data analysis was conducted from July 18, 2012, 
to October 27, 2015.
Results
Participant Characteristics
The screening process6 and baseline data are detailed else-where7, 8 and illustrated in Figure 
1.6,7 A total of 220 participants were randomized, although data on 2 CR participants (0.9%) 
were not included in the analyses because they dropped out before starting the intervention. 
Thus, the ITT analyses included 218 participants (CR, 143 [65.6%]; AL, 75 [34.4%]). Most 
of the participants were women (152 [69.7%]) and white (168 [77.1%]). The mean (SD) age 
and BMI were 37.9 (7.2) years and 25.1 (1.6), respectively. There were no significant 
differences in the baseline demographic and anthropometric variables between the CR and 
AL groups overall or between the CR and AL groups for men and women separately (all P 
> .15) (Table 1). Baseline values of the outcomes are presented in Table 2, Table 3, and 
eTable 1 in Supplement 1. There were no significant baseline CR and AL group differences 
(all P > .22). eTable 2 in Supplement 1 reports mean data at baseline and months 12 and 24, 
including the number of participants providing data at each time point. A total of 117 
(81.8%) and 71 (94.7%) participants in the CR and AL groups, respectively, completed the 
study. The sample included normal-weight individuals, since the effect of CR on health-
related QOL of these people is not well understood and the beneficial effects of CR on 
health span raise the possibility that more people will practice CR.
Weight Change and Percent CR Achieved
Mean (SEM) percent CR achieved was 15.2% (0.7%) at month 12 and 11.9% (0.7%) at 
month 24.7 The CR group lost 8.3 (0.3) kg (11.5% of initial weight) by month 12 and 7.6 
(0.3) kg by month 24 (10.4%), with almost no weight change in the AL group (0.4 [0.5] kg 
at month 24) (P < .001 for CR vs AL at 24 months). In the CR group, BMI was reduced by 
2.6 (0.1) at month 24; thus, the mean BMI for the CR group at the end of the trial was 22.6.
Mood
Compared with the AL group, the CR group experienced a significant improvement in mood 
(BDI-II: between-group difference [BGD], −0.76; 95% CI, −1.41 to −0.11; ES, −0.35) and 
tension (POMS: BGD, −0.79; 95% CI, −1.38 to −0.19; ES, −0.39) from baseline to month 
24 (Table 2). A significant BMI × treatment × time interaction was found on the POMS 
depression subscale (P = .03). The AL group had worsening depression scores compared 
with the CR group (estimated change [SE], 0.92 [0.34] vs −0.30 [0.26]) only at month 24 in 
the overweight strata (Figure 2B). In addition, a significant sex × treatment interaction was 
present for the POMS depression sub-scale (P = .01), with men in the AL group having 
worse (higher) depression scores compared with men in the CR group (estimated change 
[SE], 0.53 [0.44] vs −0.63 [0.35]) (Figure 2C).
Quality of Life
Descriptive data are provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 1 for 2 SF-36 subscales (role 
limitations due to emotional problems and role limitations due to physical problems) that

 had ceiling effects and very little variability. Two other SF-36 variables (social functioning 
and physical functioning) were analyzed as binary outcomes, and regression analyses 
indicated that there were no negative changes from baseline related to treatment (eTable 1 in 
Supplement 1). Intent-to-treat results for the remainder of the SF-36 subscales are provided 
in Table 2. Compared with the AL group, the CR group experienced significant 
improvement in general health at months 12 (BGD, 6.33; 95% CI, 3.68–8.98; ES, 0.69) and 
24 (BGD, 6.45; 95% CI, 3.93–8.98; ES, 0.75; both P < .001). Change on the PSS did not 
differ by group.
Perceived Sleep Quality
Five subscales of the PSQI were analyzed as binary outcomes, and regression analysis 
indicated that there were no negative changes from baseline that were related to group 
assignment (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The ITT analyses revealed that sleep duration 
worsened in the AL group compared with the CR group at month 12 (BGD, −0.26; 95% CI, 
−0.49 to −0.02; ES, −0.32; P = .03) (Table 2).
Sexual Function
The CR group experienced improvements on the sexual drive and relationship subscale 
compared with the AL group at month 24 (BGD, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.11–2.01; ES, 0.35; P = .
03) (Table 3). A significant sex × treatment interaction was found for the sexual arousal 
subscale (P = .02), with men in the AL group having higher arousal scores compared with 
men in the CR group (Figure 2E).
Reproductive Hormones
From the ITT analysis, SHBG levels increased in men in the CR group compared with the 
AL group at months 12 (BGD, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40–1.12 µg/mL; ES, 1.16) and 24 (BGD, 
0.92; 95% CI, 0.58–1.26 µg/mL; ES, 1.49; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 
8.896; all P < .001) (Table 3). Free testosterone levels decreased in the CR group compared 
with the AL group at month 12 (BGD, −2.98; 95% CI, −4.75 to −1.21 ng/dL; ES, −0.92]), 
but not month 24 (BGD, −0.96; 95% CI, −2.46 to 0.54 ng/dL; ES, −0.35]; P = .21 (to 
convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347). Changes in luteinizing hormone, total 
testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels did not differ significantly between the 
groups.
Correlation Analyses
All Spearman correlations in the CR group noted below were significant at α = .01. 
Spearman correlations were assessed between baseline values of the outcome variables and 
percent CR and weight change (kilograms and percent) from baseline to month 24. Sexual 
behavior and experience was significantly and favorably correlated with percent CR and 
weight loss (kilograms) at month 24 (ρ = 0.26 and ρ = −0.30, respectively).
Spearman correlations were assessed between change in the outcome variables from 
baseline to month 24 and percent CR and weight change from baseline to month 24. Change 
in SHBG levels from baseline to month 24 was significantly correlated with change in 
weight at month 24 (ρ = −0.44 for weight change [kilograms] and ρ = −0.45 for percent

 weight loss). In addition, weight change (kilograms) at month 24 correlated significantly 
with change on the POMS vigor (ρ = −0.32), fatigue (ρ = 0.24), and mood disturbance (ρ = 
0.31) subscales, as well as the total PSQI score (ρ = 0.31). Percent weight change correlated 
with change in the POMS vigor (ρ = −0.30) and mood disturbance subscales (ρ = 0.27), as 
well as the SF-36 general health (ρ = −0.27) subscale, the total score (ρ = 0.28) on the PSQI, 
and total testosterone (ρ = −0.43). Percent CR at month 24 was correlated with change in 
sleep duration (ρ = −0.30). The eFigure in Supplement 1 illustrates the association between 
the percent weight change and the change in the outcome variables at month 24.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine whether long-term CR affects 
psychological well-being and reproductive hormones (men only) in a sample that includes 
normal-weight individuals. Calorie restriction had some favorable effects on the outcomes, 
and weight loss was associated with improvements in many of the end points. These findings 
are noteworthy because floor and ceiling effects limited the ability for some scores to 
improve, although these effects provided ample opportunity for scores to worsen.
Consistent with the hypothesis and sparse literature22,23 from samples that include normal-
weight individuals, CR improved mood (BDI-II) and reduced tension (POMS), although the 
ESs were modest. Levels of QOL were high at baseline, yet CR improved general health and 
the ESs approached the large range (0.80)28 and represented approximately a 5.2 and 5.7 
score improvement. This finding is consistent with studies11,12 of overweight or obese 
individuals, as is the failure to find differences on change in stress from the PSS.13
Sleep duration worsened in the AL group; this finding is consistent with the only other 
study13 that evaluated sleep quality during CR in a sample that included normal-weight and 
overweight individuals. Although the ES was modest, it suggests that CR might attenuate 
changes in sleep that occur with age. Calorie restriction improved one measure of sexual 
function, and an interaction indicated that AL men reported higher arousal compared with 
CR men. This finding was the only occurrence of the AL group having a more positive 
outcome than the CR group. The association between obesity and sexual dysfunction is well 
established, and weight loss improves sexual function14 in obese women31 and obese men 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus,32 and the present study provides data on a sample that 
included normal-weight healthy individuals.
Consistent with the hypothesis, SHBG levels increased and free testosterone levels 
decreased in men of the CR group. The luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, 
and total testosterone hypotheses were not supported. The SHBG results are consistent with 
those previously reported, although those studies enrolled obese diabetic men,17 obese 
nondiabetic men,15 or obese men with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.32 The decrease 
in free testosterone levels in the CR group adds to the literature. The failure to find a change 
in total testosterone levels is consistent with Khoo et al,17 but inconsistent with Kaukua et 
al15 and another study of Khoo et al,32 which found total testosterone levels to increase in 
obese non-diabetic men. Increased SHBG levels17 and increased total testosterone levels32

 have been found to correlate with weight change, which is consistent with the present 
study’s findings.
Strengths of this randomized clinical trial include the amount of weight loss achieved, 
maintenance of weight loss through 24 months, inclusion of normal-weight people, and the 
sample size. Limitations include selection of a healthy sample, which limited variability and 
contributed to ceiling and floor effects. In addition, the sample was predominantly female 
and white, which limits generalizability. Finally, differential attention between the groups 
could have influenced change in health-related QOL since the CR group met more 
frequently with study staff, although participating in the intervention also added burden to 
CR participants.
Conclusions
Calorie restriction had some positive effects and no negative effects on health-related QOL, 
and correlation analyses supported the association between weight loss and improved health-
related QOL.10 The results from this study are helpful to health care professionals because 
they provide data on the effect of CR on health-related QOL overall and sex hormones in 
men in a sample that included normal-weight individuals. Calorie restriction among 
primarily overweight and obese persons has been found to improve QOL,11,12 sleep,13 and 
sexual function,14 and the results of the present study indicate that 2 years of CR is unlikely 
to negatively affect these factors in healthy adults; rather, CR is likely to provide some 
improvement.

 Key Points
Question
What are the effects of 2 years of calorie restriction on the health-related quality of life of 
nonobese adults?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial that enrolled 220 healthy nonobese adults, long-term (2-
year) calorie restriction had no negative effects and some positive effects on health-
related quality of life.
Meaning
In nonobese adults, calorie restriction, marked by approximately 10% weight loss, can be 
undertaken with little concern about negative effects on quality of life, mood, sexual 
function, and sleep.

Abbreviations: AL, ad libitum; BDI-II, Beck Depression Inventory II; CR, caloric restriction; Δ, change; ES, effect size; ITT, intent-to-treat; POMS, Profile of Mood States; PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index; PSS, perceived stress scale; SF-36, Rand 36-Item Short Form.
aBaseline values are the observed mean (SE). Estimated change in the outcome variables were obtained from analyses that used an ITT approach to determine whether change in the outcome variables 
differed between the CR and AL groups.
bAll P values reflect Bonferroni correction, truncated at >.99, as appropriate.
cHigher scores on the BDI-II, PSS, and PSQI scales reflect worse mood, greater stress, and worse sleep quality, respectively. Higher scores on the POMS scale indicate higher levels of the construct being 
measured. Higher scores on the SF-36 reflect better quality of life. The range of scores for the instruments is provided in the Methods section under the subsection entitled Assessment of Mood, Quality of 
Life, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Sexual Function.

Abbreviations: AL, ad libitum; BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); CR, caloric restriction; DISF-SR, Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function–
Self-report; ES, effect size; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; ITT, intent-to-treat; LH, luteinizing hormone; SHBG, sex hormone–binding globulin.
SI conversion factors: To convert LH to international units per liter, multiply by 1; SHBG to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 8.896; and total testosterone to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347.
aBaseline values are the observed mean (SE). Estimated change in the outcome variables were obtained from analyses that used an ITT approach to determine whether change in the outcome variables 
differed between the CR and AL groups. The ITT analyses included 218 participants (CR, 143; AL, 75). Baseline values of the variable being evaluated and the stratification variables of site, sex, and body 
mass index (BMI) stratum (22.0 ≤ BMI < 25.0 vs 25.0 ≤ BMI < 28.0) were included as covariates.
