Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States; nearly all tobacco use begins dur-
ing youth and young adulthood (1,2). Among youths, use of 
tobacco products in any form is unsafe (1,3). CDC and the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from 
the 2011–2016 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) 
to determine recent patterns of current (past 30-day) use of 
seven tobacco product types among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) 
and high (grades 9–12) school students. In 2016, 20.2% of 
surveyed high school students and 7.2% of middle school 
students reported current tobacco product use. In 2016, 
among current tobacco product users, 47.2% of high 
school students and 42.4% of middle school students used 
≥2 tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
were the most commonly used tobacco product among high 
(11.3%) and middle (4.3%) school students. Current use 
of any tobacco product did not change significantly during 
2011–2016 among high or middle school students, although 
combustible tobacco product use declined. However, during 
2015–2016, among high school students, decreases were 
observed in current use of any tobacco product, any combus-
tible product, ≥2 tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and hookahs. 
Among middle school students, current use of e-cigarettes 
decreased. Comprehensive and sustained strategies can help 
prevent and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco products 
among U.S. youths (1–3).
NYTS is a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, 
self-administered, pencil-and-paper questionnaire admin-
istered to U.S. middle and high school students. A three-
stage cluster sampling procedure was used to generate a 
nationally representative sample of U.S. students attending 
public and private schools in grades 6–12. This report uses 
data from six NYTS waves (2011–2016). Sample sizes 
and response rates for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 
and 2016 were 18,866 (72.7%), 24,658 (73.6%), 18,406 
(67.8%), 22,007 (73.3%), 17,711 (63.4%), and 20,675 
(71.6%), respectively.

Participants were asked about current use of cigarettes, cigars, 
smokeless tobacco,* e-cigarettes,† hookahs (water pipes used 
to smoke tobacco),§ pipe tobacco,¶ and bidis (small imported 
cigarettes wrapped in a leaf). Current use for each product was 
defined as use on ≥1 day during the past 30 days. “Any tobacco 
product use” was defined as current use of one or more tobacco 
products, and “≥2 tobacco product use” was defined as current 
use of two or more tobacco products.** “Any combustible 
tobacco product use” was defined as current use of cigarettes, 
cigars, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis.
Data were weighted to account for the complex survey design 
and adjusted for nonresponse; national prevalence estimates, 
95% confidence intervals, and population estimates were 
computed and rounded down to the nearest 10,000. Current 
use estimates for 2016 are presented for any tobacco product, 
any combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco products, and 
each tobacco product individually, by selected demographics 
for each school type (high school and middle school). Results 
were assessed for the presence of linear and quadratic trends 
during 2011–2016, adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, and school 
* Beginning in 2015, the definition of smokeless tobacco included chewing 
tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco because of limited sample sizes 
for individual products (snus, dissolvable). In figures 1 and 2, this definition 
was applied across all years (2011–2016) for comparability purposes. The 
definition of smokeless tobacco in previously published reports (NYTS 2014 
and earlier) included only chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, whereas snus and 
dissolvable tobacco were reported as separate products.
† In 2015 and 2016, current use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During 
the past 30 days, on how many days did you use electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?” 
E-cigarette questions were preceded by an introductory paragraph. In 2016, this 
paragraph read: “The next thirteen questions are about electronic cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that usually contain a nicotine-
based liquid that is vaporized and inhaled. You may also know them as vape-pens, 
hookah-pens, e-hookahs, e-cigars, e-pipes, personal vaporizers or mods. Some brand 
examples are NJOY, Blu, Vuse, MarkTen, Logic, Vapin Plus, eGo, Halo.” A similar 
introductory paragraph preceded e-cigarette questions in 2015. In 2014, current 
use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During the past 30 days, on how 
many days did you use e-cigarettes such as Blu, 21st Century Smoke, or NJOY?”; 
and in 2011 to 2013, e-cigarette use was assessed by the question “In the past 
30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one day?,” and 
the response option for e-cigarettes was “Electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes such 
as Ruyan or NJOY.”
§ In 2016, current use of hookahs was assessed by the question “In the past 
30 days, on how many days did you smoke tobacco in a hookah or waterpipe? 
Hookah questions were preceded by an introductory statement: “The next eight 
questions are about smoking tobacco in a hookah, which is a type of waterpipe. 
Shisha (or hookah tobacco) is smoked in a hookah.” From 2011–2015, current 
hookah use was assessed by the question “In the past 30 days, which of the 
following products have you used on at least one day?” Hookah was the fourth 
response option in 2015, the first response option in 2014, and was the fourth 
or fifth response option from 2011 to 2013.
 ¶ From 2014 to 2016, current use of tobacco pipes was assessed by the 
question “In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you 
used on at least one day?” and the response option for pipe tobacco was 
“Pipe filled with tobacco (not waterpipe).” Pipe tobacco was the second 
response option available in 2016, the fifth option in 2015, and the second 
option available in 2014. From 2011 to 2013, tobacco pipe use was assessed 
by the question “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you 
smoke tobacco in a pipe?”
 
** In 2015 and 2016, the definition of ≥2 tobacco product–use includes the 
updated definition of smokeless tobacco, thereby analyzing chewing tobacco/
snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco as a single tobacco product type 
compared with previously published NYTS reports, which analyzed chewing 
tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco as separate products.

grade.†† T-tests were performed to examine differences between 
findings in 2015 and 2016. For all analyses, p-values <0.05 
were considered statistically significant.
In 2016, 20.2% of high school students (estimated 3.05 mil-
lion) reported current use of any tobacco product, including 
9.6% (1.44 million; 47.2% of current tobacco product users) 
who reported current use of ≥2 tobacco products. Among high 
school students, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used 
tobacco product (11.3% of current users), followed by ciga-
rettes (8.0%), cigars (7.7%), smokeless tobacco (5.8%), hoo-
kahs (4.8%), pipe tobacco (1.4%), and bidis (0.5%) (Table). 
Males reported higher use of any tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco 
products, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco than did 
females. E-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco 
product among non-Hispanic white (13.7%) and Hispanic

 * Past 30-day use of electronic cigarettes was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?” Past 
30-day use of cigarettes was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?” Past 30-day use of cigars was determined 
by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars?” Past 30-day use of hookahs was determined by asking, “During 
the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke tobacco in a hookah or waterpipe?” Smokeless tobacco was defined as use of chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, 
and/or dissolvable tobacco products. Past 30-day use of smokeless tobacco was determined by asking the following question regarding chewing tobacco, snuff, and 
dip: “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip?,” and the following question for use of snus and dissolvable tobacco 
products: “In the past 30 days, which of the following products did you use on at least one day: snus, dissolvable tobacco products?.” Responses from these questions 
were combined to derive overall smokeless tobacco use. Past 30-day use of pipe tobacco and bidis were determined by asking, “In the past 30 days, which of the 
following products have you used on at least one day: pipe filled with tobacco (not waterpipe), bidis (small brown cigarettes wrapped in a leaf)?”
 † Estimated total number of users is rounded down to the nearest 10,000 persons.
 § Data are statistically unreliable because samples size was <50 or relative standard error was >0.3.
 ¶ Any tobacco product use is defined as use of any tobacco product (electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis) 
on at least one day in the past 30 days.
 ** ≥2 tobacco product use is defined as use of two or more tobacco products (electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and/or 
bidis) on at least one day in the past 30 days.
 †† Any combustible tobacco use defined as use of cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis on at least one day in the past 30 days.    
 
†† A test for linear trend is significant if an overall statistically significant decrease or 
increase occurs during the study period. Data were also assessed for the presence of 
quadratic trends; a significant quadratic trend indicates that the rate of change 
accelerated or decelerated across the study period. T
rends were only assessed when 
statistically stable data were available for all 6 years. A significant positive linear trend 
and nonsignificant quadratic trend signifies the presence of a linear increase; a 
significant negative linear trend and nonsignificant quadratic trends signifies the 
presence of a linear decrease; a significant positive linear trend and significant positive 
or negative quadratic trend signifies the presence of a nonlinear increase; a significant 
negative linear trend and significant positive or negative quadratic trend signifies the 
presence of a nonlinear decrease; a nonsignificant linear trend and significant positive 
or negative quadratic trend signifies the presence of a nonlinear change.

(10.3%) high school students, whereas cigars were the most 
commonly used tobacco product among non-Hispanic black 
high school students (9.5%).
Among middle school students, 7.2% (0.85 million) reported 
current use of any tobacco product, and 3.1% (0.36 million; 
42.4% of current tobacco users) reported current use of 
≥2 tobacco products (Table). Among middle school students, 
e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product 
(4.3%), followed by cigarettes (2.2%), cigars (2.2%), smokeless 
tobacco (2.2%), hookahs (2.0%), pipe tobacco (0.7%), and 
bidis (0.3%). Among males, current use of any tobacco product 
was 8.3%, and among females, was 5.9%. Hispanics reported 
higher use of any tobacco product, use of ≥2 tobacco products, 
and use of hookahs than did non-Hispanic whites (Table). 
Among all high school students, current use of any tobacco 
product did not change significantly from 2011 (24.2%) to 
2016 (20.2%); however, a nonlinear decrease occurred in cur-
rent use of any combustible tobacco product (21.8% to 13.8%), 
and ≥2 tobacco products (12.0% to 9.6%) during this time 
(Figure 1). By product type, nonlinear increases occurred for 
current use of e-cigarettes (1.5% to 11.3%) and hookahs (4.1% 
to 4.8%) (p for trend <0.05); however, a linear decrease occurred 
in current use of cigarettes (15.8% to 8.0%), cigars (11.6% to 
7.7%), and smokeless tobacco (7.9% to 5.8%), and a nonlin-
ear decrease occurred in current use of pipe tobacco (4.0% to 
1.4%) and bidis (2.0% to 0.5%) (p<0.05 for trend) (Figure 1). 
During 2011–2016, among middle school students, a linear 
decrease occurred in current use of any combustible tobacco 
products (6.4% to 4.3%), cigarettes (4.3% to 2.2%), cigars 
(3.5% to 2.2%), and pipe tobacco (2.2% to 0.7%) (p for trend 
<0.05), whereas no significant linear or quadratic trends were 
observed for current use of any tobacco product or ≥2 tobacco 
products (Figure 2). A nonlinear increase occurred in current use 
of e-cigarettes (0.6% to 4.3%), and a linear increase occurred 
for current use of hookahs (1.0% to 2.0%) (p for trend <0.05).
During 2015–2016, among high school students, decreases 
occurred in the use of any tobacco product (25.3% to 
20.2%), any combustible tobacco product (17.2% to 13.8%), 
≥2 tobacco products (13.0% to 9.6%), e-cigarettes (16.0% 
to 11.3%), and hookahs (7.2% to 4.8%) (p<0.05). Among 
middle school students, e-cigarette use decreased from 5.3% 
in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016 (p<0.05). Among middle and high 
school students, use of other tobacco products, including 
cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe, and bidis, did not 
change significantly during 2015–2016.
Discussion
During 2015–2016, the use of any tobacco product, 
any combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco products, 
e-cigarettes, and hookahs declined among high school students, 
and e-cigarette use declined among middle school students. 
This is in contrast to prior recent years, when declines in 
the reported use of cigarettes and cigars occurred alongside 
increases in the use of other tobacco products, including 
e-cigarettes and hookahs, resulting in no change in the use of 
any tobacco product during 2011–2016. In 2016, an estimated 
3.9 million U.S. middle and high school students currently 
used any tobacco product, with 1.8 million reporting current 
use of ≥2 tobacco products. Among youths, symptoms of 
nicotine dependence are increased in multiple tobacco prod-
uct–users compared with single product–users (4).
Tobacco prevention and control strategies at the national, 
state, and local levels likely have contributed to the reduction in 
use of certain tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, among 
youths in recent years (2). Efforts to address youths’ use of 
tobacco products include youth access restrictions, smoke-free 
policies that include e-cigarettes, and media campaigns warning 
about the risks of youth tobacco product use. For example, 
since February 2014, FDA’s first national tobacco public 
education campaign, The Real Cost, has broadcasted tobacco 
education advertising designed for youths aged 12–17 years; 
the campaign was associated with an estimated 348,398 
U.S. youths who did not initiate cigarette smoking during 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States, and nearly all tobacco use begins 
during youth and young adulthood. Among youths, use of 
tobacco products in any form is unsafe.
What is added by this report?
In 2016, one in five high school students and one in 14 middle 
school students reported current use of a tobacco product on 
≥1 of the past 30 days (3.9 million tobacco users). Moreover, 
47.2% of high school students and 42.4% of middle school 
students who used a tobacco product in the past 30 days used 
≥2 tobacco products. During 2015–2016, current use of 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) decreased among middle 
school students, and decreases in current use of any tobacco 
product, any combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco 
products, e-cigarettes, and hookahs occurred among high 
school students. However, decreases in cigarette and cigar use 
during 2011–2016 were offset by increases in hookah and 
e-cigarette use, resulting in no significant change in any 
tobacco use. In 2016, e-cigarettes remained the most com-
monly used tobacco product among high (11.3%) and middle 
(4.3%) school students.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sustained efforts to implement proven tobacco control 
strategies focusing on all types of tobacco products are critical 
to reduce tobacco product use among U.S. youths.

February 2014–March 2016 (5). Continued implementation 
of these strategies can help prevent and further reduce the use 
of all forms of tobacco product among U.S. youths (1–3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, NYTS only recruited students from public 
and private schools; therefore, the findings might not be 
generalizable to youths who are being home-schooled, have 
dropped out of school, or are in detention centers. Second, data 
were self-reported; thus, the findings are subject to recall and 
response bias. Finally, changes in the wording and placement 
of survey questions about certain products (e.g., e-cigarettes, 
hookahs, and pipe tobacco) during 2011–2016 might have had 
an impact on reported use. Despite these limitations, overall 
trends are generally similar to those found in other nationally 
representative surveys (6,7).
Sustained efforts to implement proven tobacco control 
policies and strategies are critical to preventing youth use of 
all tobacco products. Effective August 8, 2016, FDA finalized 
its deeming rule, which gave FDA jurisdiction over prod-
ucts made or derived from tobacco, including e-cigarettes, 
cigars, pipe tobacco, and hookah tobacco (8). Regulation of 
the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco 
products by FDA, coupled with full implementation of com-
prehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies at CDC-
recommended funding levels (9), could reduce youth tobacco 
product initiation and use (1,2,9). Strategies to reduce youth 
tobacco product use include increasing the price of tobacco 
products, protecting people from secondhand exposure to com-
bustible tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol, implementing 
advertising and promotion restrictions and national public 
education media campaigns, and raising the minimum age of 
purchase for tobacco products to 21 years (9,10). Continued 
monitoring of all forms of youth tobacco product use is critical 
to determine whether current patterns in use persist over time.

 * Any tobacco product use is defined as past 30-day use of electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco and/or bidis. 
 † Any combustible tobacco use is defined as use of cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis on at least one day in the past 30 days. 
 § ≥2 tobacco product use is defined as past 30-day use of two or more of the following tobacco products: electronic cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, smokeless 
tobacco, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis. 
 ¶ From 2015 to 2016, a significant decrease in use of any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, and hookahs 
was observed (p<0.05).
 ** During 2011–2016, use of electronic cigarettes and hookahs exhibited a nonlinear increase (p<0.05). Use of cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco exhibited a 
linear decrease (p<0.05). Any combustible tobacco use, pipe tobacco, and bidis exhibited a nonlinear decrease (p<0.05). There was a nonlinear change during this 
time in the use of ≥2 types of tobacco products (p<0.05). No significant trend in current use of any tobacco product was observed during 2011–2016.
 †† Beginning in 2015, the definition of smokeless tobacco included chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco because of limited sample sizes for 
individual products; this definition was applied across 2011–2016 for comparability purposes. In previous reports (National Youth Tobacco Survey 2014 and earlier) 
smokeless tobacco included only chewing tobacco/snuff/dip; snus and dissolvable tobacco were reported as separate products.
