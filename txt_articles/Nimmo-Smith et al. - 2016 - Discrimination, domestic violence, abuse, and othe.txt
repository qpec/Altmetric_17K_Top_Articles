SUMMARY
Objective: To quantify the experience of discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, and
other stressful life events in people with epilepsy in comparison with the general popu-
lation and people with other chronic conditions. To assess whether any excess relative
burden of these adversities could explain the higher rates of depression in people with
epilepsy.
Methods: The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 used comprehensive interviews
with 7,403 individuals living in private residences in England. Doctor-diagnosed epilepsy
and other chronic conditions were established by self-report. Discrimination, domestic
violence, physical and sexual abuse, and other stressful life events were assessed using
computerized self-completion and a face-to-face interview, respectively.
Results: People with epilepsy were sevenfold more likely to have reported experienc-
ing discrimination due to health problems (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7.1; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 3.1–16.3), than the general population without epilepsy. This
estimate was substantially greater in people with epilepsy than for people with other
chronic conditions. People with epilepsy also had greater odds of experiencing domes-
tic violence and sexual abuse than the general population, although these associations
were also found in people with other chronic conditions. There was less evidence of an
association between epilepsy and a history of physical abuse or having a greater burden
of other stressful life events. In exploratory analyses, assuming they lie on the causal
pathway, discrimination, domestic violence, and sexual abuse explained 42.7% of the
total effect of the relationship between epilepsy and depression or anxiety disorders.
Significance: People with epilepsy can face a range of psychosocial adversities and
extensively report feeling discriminated against as compared to the general popula-
tion. In addition, if confirmed in longitudinal studies, the results suggest that these psy-
chosocial adversities may have a significant role in the development of psychiatric
comorbidity and may be targets for future interventions.

 Key Points
• People with epilepsy were sevenfold more likely to
report experiencing discrimination due to physical
health problems than the general population
• People with epilepsy had greater odds of reporting
domestic violence and sexual abuse than the general
population
• These psychosocial adversities could explain a sub-
stantial proportion of the total effect of the relationship
between epilepsy and common mental disorders
Epilepsy is the most common serious neurologic disorder
globally, with an estimated prevalence of 1to 2% in commu-
nity samples.1 Many people with treated epilepsy can have a
condition that is clinically benign, but the stigma and dis-
crimination related to the diagnosis has been argued to be
worse than the disease itself.2,3 People with epilepsy are
more likely to have common mental health problems such
as depression and anxiety disorders than persons in the gen-
eral population4,5 and people with other chronic conditions.4
Although this excess psychiatric comorbidity may be
related to common neurobiologic factors, psychosocial fac-
tors may also be important.6 Discrimination,7 domestic vio-
lence,8 physical or sexual abuse,9 and stressful life events10
are all known to contribute to depression. These psychoso-
cial adversities have also been reported in people with epi-
lepsy but have not been adequately investigated in
population-based studies.
Previous studies exploring the experience of discrimina-
tion in people with epilepsy have either recruited from a sec-
ondary care setting or through epilepsy support groups,
which may bias results toward the experience of those with
more severe epilepsy or who are finding living with epilepsy
the most challenging.11–14 In these studies, the experience
of discrimination was reported in 44–56% of people with
epilepsy.12,13 The few community-based studies on this
topic also found that up to half of people with epilepsy
reported experiences of unfair treatment as a result of their
epilepsy15,16 but the studies did not include a control popu-
lation.
There is some evidence to support high rates of domestic
violence among persons with neurologic conditions,17 but
there is little information on this topic in relation to people
with epilepsy.18 The only community-based study of the
experience of physical or sexual abuse in people with epi-
lepsy has come is of pregnant mothers in the Norwegian
Mother and Child Cohort Study.18 This reported experience
of abuse by 22% of women with epilepsy compared to 19%
of women with nonepileptic chronic diseases and 15% of
women without epilepsy. This study was unable to study
men with epilepsy or women who were not pregnant at the
time.18 Other available studies to date have been small and
taken from selected secondary care populations without
control populations.19,20
The experience of stressful life events has been studied in
relation to seizure frequency,21 epilepsy onset,22 and in
studies comparing people with epilepsy with people with
nonepileptic attack disorder.19,23–25 Stressful life events
have also been proposed to have an epileptogenic effect, in
addition to being associated with psychopathology.26 How-
ever, because these studies were small or did not have con-
trols for comparison, only tentative conclusions were
possible.
A better understanding of the relative burden of adverse
experiences such as discrimination, abuse, and life events
may help provide a more complete picture of the difficulties
encountered by people with epilepsy in comparison to the
general population. It is important to know whether the bur-
den of these adversities in people with epilepsy is specific to
epilepsy or represents the experience of having a chronic ill-
ness, and whether it could be hypothesised to explain the
excess rates of common mental disorders in epilepsy. Such
insights may help inform psychosocial interventions to
improve the quality of life and mental health in people with
epilepsy.
To address these gaps in the literature, we report findings
from a nationally representative sample of adults in Eng-
land. The aims of our study were (1) to quantify the experi-
ence of discrimination, domestic violence, abuse and other
stressful life events in people with epilepsy; (2) to under-
stand the relative burden of these psychosocial adversities
in people with epilepsy in comparison with the general pop-
ulation and individuals with other chronic (asthma, dia-
betes) and neurologic (migraine) conditions; and (3) to
assess whether any excess relative burden of these adversi-
ties could explain the higher rates of depression and anxiety
disorders in people with epilepsy.
Methods
The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) 2007
The sample for APMS 2007 was intended to be represen-
tative of the population in England older than 16 years of
age and living in private households.27 The study imple-
mented a multistage probability sampling design. The sam-
pling frame was the United Kingdom’s Royal Mail Small
User Postcode Address File, which includes all delivery
sites receiving <50 pieces of mail every day. The Primary
sampling units (PSUs) were postcode sectors, which com-
prised 2,550 households on average. The PSUs were strati-
fied using Strategic Health Authorities, and by the
proportion of people in manual and nonmanual socioeco-
nomic groupings, and then by the proportion of households
that own a car from the United Kingdom’s 2001 Census
data. PSUs were then sampled from each stratum with a
probability proportional to size (measured by the number of
delivery points). There were 519 PSUs identified. Within

Psychosocial Adversities in Epilepsy
 these PSUs, 28 delivery sites were randomly selected, giv-
ing 14,532 delivery sites. Small businesses and organisa-
tions were excluded once the interviewer had confirmed the
address was not a private household, giving 12,694 eligible
sample addresses. For households with more than one adult
aged over 16, one adult was randomly selected for interview
and 7,461 (57%) of individuals agreed to be interviewed,
providing for 7,353 full interviews, 50 partial interviews,
and 58 proxy interviews. Excluding the proxy interviews,
which were not included in this study, data were used from
up to 7,403 productive interviews. Complete documentation
of the survey methodology is available elsewhere.27 Ethical
approval for the survey was given by the Royal Free Hospi-
tal and Medical School Research Ethics Committee.
Epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, or migraines
Participants were shown a card with specific health con-
ditions and asked if they had any of the conditions listed.
Those stating that they had “epilepsy/fits” since the age of
16 were then asked if a doctor had given them a diagnosis of
epilepsy. Epilepsy that started in childhood but persisted
into adulthood was included. Comparable questions have
been used and found to be valid in other studies of epilepsy
in Canada and the United States.5,28 A similar methodology
was used to identify people reporting a lifetime doctor-diag-
nosed history of asthma, diabetes, and migraines. We have
previously studied these conditions in comparison with epi-
lepsy to assess the specificity of comorbid psychopathology
to epilepsy.4
Discrimination, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and
other stressful life events
The experience of discrimination was ascertained using a
self-completion tool on a laptop computer during the face-
to-face interview. Self-completion was chosen because it
would enable interviewees to feel more comfortable report-
ing episodes of discrimination.29 The questions included
perceived unfair treatment in relation to age, sex, ethnicity,
religion, sexual orientation, mental health, or physical
health conditions, and were based on those developed for
International Social Justice Project.30 In the current study,
we specifically studied the responses to the question “Have
you been unfairly treated in the last 12 months, because of
any other health problem or disability?” which followed an
item specific to unfair treatment due to mental health prob-
lems.
Domestic violence was assessed using 10 questions based
on those asked in the British Crime Survey.31 These
included the current or an ex-partner ever withholding
household money from the respondent; preventing them
seeing close friends and family; frightening them by threat-
ening to hurt them; pushing, pinning down, or slapping
them; kicking, biting, or hitting with a fist or something
else; choking or strangling them; threats or actual use of a
weapon or force; and threats to kill the respondent. Subjects
were asked to include all relevant events and informed that
their answers would not be seen by the interviewer. We
defined exposure to domestic violence as an affirmative
answer on any one of these questions.
Sexual abuse was assessed using six questions including
someone talking to or touching the respondent in a sexual
way without consent, or having sexual intercourse without
consent since before or since the age of 16 years and one
additional question assessed physical abuse from a parent or
stepparent before the age of 16 years.
Finally, participants were asked about whether they had
ever experienced a range of life events using the List of
Threatening experiences scale32 (see appendix Table S1
for a full list of life events included). For the present
study, the question regarding the experience of illness was
removed as it may bias results if measuring in people with
chronic conditions. Two questions regarding violence in
the home and sexual abuse were also removed, as they
were measured by the tools described. The remaining
number of life events were summed to create a life events
score. Because the majority of the population reported
having experienced life events, we considered the report
of four or more events to denote the experience of a
greater number of life events.33
Potential confounders
Potential confounders studied included the respondent’s
age and sex, highest educational qualification (categorized
as having [i] degree or professional qualification; [ii] some
qualifications including secondary school education qualifi-
cations or [iii] no qualifications), marital status (married or
cohabiting, single or widowed, divorced, or separated),
employment status (unemployed/economically inactive or
employed), tenure of accommodation (owner occupier or
renting) ethnicity (white or nonwhite), quintiles of a small
area index of multiple deprivation, and presence of other
chronic conditions (reported having no, one, two, or three or
more chronic conditions apart from the one under study).4
The chronic conditions included a doctor diagnosed history
of cancer, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, ischemic heart
disease, chronic lung disease, asthma, upper and lower
gastrointestinal disease, bladder problems, arthritis, and
migraines requiring treatment in the preceding 12 months.
Common mental disorders
Individuals meeting the World Health Organization
(WHO) International Classification of Diseases, Revision
10 (ICD-10) diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders
were identified using the Clinical Interview Schedule-
Revised (CIS-R), a structured psychiatric interview admin-
istered face-to-face.4 Our previous work found important
associations between epilepsy and depression, phobic and
generalized anxiety disorders, and with individuals meeting
the criteria for any depressive or anxiety disorder.4 We
included these diagnoses in the present study to investigate

 if their associations with epilepsy could be explained by the
psychosocial stressors under study.
Analysis
We conducted analyses using the survey (svy) commands
in STATA 13 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX, U.S.A.). We used probability weights to account for the
complex study design and nonresponse to ensure the esti-
mates are representative of the population of England.27
Complete details of the weighting procedures are available
elsewhere.4,27 We estimated the weighted prevalence of dis-
crimination, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and life
events for people with epilepsy. We used weighted logistic
regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the association of dis-
crimination, physical and sexual abuse, and life events with
epilepsy. We included the variables representing age, sex,
marital status, educational qualifications, tenure of accom-
modation, employment status, ethnicity, index of multiple
deprivation, and the presence of other chronic conditions in
adjusted models as potential confounders to estimate
adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. In comparative analyses, we
used an equivalent methodology to estimate associations in
people with asthma, diabetes and migraines.
We then assessed the impact of these psychosocial adver-
sities on the association between epilepsy and common
mental disorders. We first adjusted for these in models
assessing the association between epilepsy and common
mental disorders, conceptualizing them as potential con-
founders (see Fig. 1). Although the temporal sequencing of
the variables was unknown in this cross-sectional study,
these variables could be considered to be on the causal path-
way between epilepsy and poor mental health (see Fig. 1).
To quantify the extent of possible mediation, we used the
user-written binary_mediation package in Stata to estimate
direct, indirect and total effects, and the total effect
mediated. We used bootstrapping with 1,000 replications to
calculate the bias-corrected confidence intervals for these
estimates.
Results
Results of the descriptive analysis, detailing sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of people with epilepsy and compar-
ing them with people without epilepsy, has been reported
previously4 and is available as supplementary material
(Table S2). For the purpose of this study, complete data
were present for 88 people with epilepsy and 6,819 people
without epilepsy.
The weighted prevalence of people with epilepsy-report-
ing discrimination due to physical health problems (11%)
was significantly greater than that estimated for the general
population (1.6%) (Table 1). Following adjustment for
potential confounders, people with epilepsy had a sevenfold
odds of reporting experience of discrimination due to their
physical health than the general population without epilepsy
(adjusted OR 7.1, 95% CI 3.1–16.3). In comparison, people
with asthma and diabetes had an almost twofold increase in
odds of reporting discrimination, but there was no evidence
of such associations in people with migraine (Table 2).
Over a third (37%) of people with epilepsy had experi-
enced domestic violence compared to 24% people without
epilepsy. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds
of reporting experiencing domestic violence were 60%
greater than in the general population (adjusted OR 1.6,
95% CI 1.0–2.7). This association was similar to that in
Figure 1.

Psychosocial Adversities in Epilepsy
 people with migraines (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8)
and greater than that observed in people with asthma or dia-
betes (Table 2).
About one in 10 people with epilepsy reported having
experienced physical abuse, compared to 4.6% reported by
the general population (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9–4.2).
The confidence intervals for this association crossed one but
the point estimate was comparable to people with migraines,
where >7% had reported experiencing physical abuse (ad-
justed OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.5). There was no significant
association between the chronic conditions asthma and dia-
betes and physical abuse (Table 2).
A third (34.0%) of people with epilepsy had reported
experiencing some form of sexual abuse compared to a
fifth (20.8%) of the general population (adjusted OR 2.0,
95% CI 1.3–3.3). The odds of experiencing sexual abuse
were also greater in people with asthma (adjusted OR
1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8) and migraines (adjusted OR 1.5,
95% CI 1.3–1.8).
A greater proportion of people with epilepsy (42.6%)
reported having experienced four or more adverse life
events than the general population (34.6%), although this
difference was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.4,
95% CI 0.9–2.3). This result was comparable to that for peo-
ple with asthma (adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.5) and peo-
ple with migraines (1.7, 95% CI 1.4–2.0).
Table 3 shows the results of the associations between epi-
lepsy and common mental disorders before and after addi-
tion adjustment for discrimination, domestic violence, and
sexual abuse. Following adjustment with these variables,
there was a substantial attenuation of the odds ratios for
depression and anxiety disorders, although the relationship
between epilepsy and depression still remained statistically
significant (Table 3). If these variables were assumed to be
on the causal pathway, we estimated in an exploratory medi-
ation model that they would explain 42.7% of the total effect
between epilepsy and common mental disorders (including
depression, all anxiety disorders, and mixed anxiety and

Discussion
In this population-based study, designed to be representa-
tive of the population of England, people with epilepsy were
sevenfold more likely to have reported experiencing dis-
crimination due to health problems compared to the general
population without epilepsy. This estimate was substantially
greater for people with epilepsy than for people with other
chronic conditions. People with epilepsy also had greater
odds of experiencing domestic violence and sexual abuse
than the general population, although these associations
were also found in people with other chronic conditions.
There was less evidence for a relationship between epilepsy
and physical abuse before age 16 or having an excess of
other adverse life events. If a causal pathway were assumed,
then discrimination, domestic violence, and sexual abuse
could explain a substantial proportion of the total effect of
the relationship between epilepsy and depression and anxi-
ety disorders.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge this is the only population-based study
describing the experience of discrimination, domestic vio-
lence, abuse, and other stressful life events in epilepsy using
general population controls and accounting for a range of
relevant confounders. In addition, the ability to compare our
results with the prevalence of these experiences in people
with other chronic conditions offer a significant advantage
toward understanding the specificity of these associations to
epilepsy.
There are several limitations to this study. Although the
sample was large, the number of people with epilepsy was
comparatively low, which resulted in wide confidence inter-
vals for some associations. We were unable to study risk in
specific subgroups such as women, since the numbers would
be insufficient to provide meaningful estimates. Only 57%
of the patients in the sample who were eligible for interview
responded in the APMS, and so weighting procedures were
used to reduce the likelihood of nonresponse bias.27
Because epilepsy was self-reported in this survey we were

Psychosocial Adversities in Epilepsy
 unable to prevent the possibility of reporting bias. There
were no data on the seizure type or frequency. It is possible
that some individuals who reported having had the diagnosis
of epilepsy actually have a different diagnosis, such as non-
epileptic attack disorder. However, the potential for such
misclassification exists in almost all large-scale epidemio-
logic studies of epilepsy, which routinely use self-reported
measures of epilepsy.5,15 This study measured perceived
experience of discrimination due to health problems, with
no corroborative objective information. Although such mea-
sures are widely used,12,13 it is not possible to delineate epi-
sodes of discrimination from legitimate restrictions (such as
restrictions on driving), which may have been placed on
individuals due to the nature of their health problems. In
addition, the possibility of selective recall cannot be ruled
out. For instance, it is possible that people with epilepsy
have more negative recollections than the general popula-
tion due to psychiatric comorbidities, or the cognitive or
behavioral side effects of medications. Finally, the cross-
sectional design limits any inferences of causation or direc-
tionality.
Our study builds on the findings of previous studies that
report high rates of discrimination or unfair treatment expe-
rienced by people with epilepsy.15,16 It adds that people with
epilepsy have a specific and stronger relationship with the
experience of discrimination compared to the general popu-
lation and those with other chronic conditions. It has been
widely documented that misperceptions about epilepsy have
persisted in society throughout history and perpetuated in
popular culture, resulting in stigma and social isolation.
Despite improvements in our understanding of epilepsy
over the last century, negative attitudes toward epilepsy per-
sist.3 For example, contemporary studies of attitudes toward
epilepsy continue to report high rates of individuals stating
that they would object to their child marrying someone with
epilepsy,34–36 or that people with epilepsy should not be
employed as a nurse or teacher irrespective of the type and
frequency of seizures.37 In the United Kingdom, >50% of
1,600 randomly selected informants agreed that people with
epilepsy are treated differently, including by social avoid-
ance and exclusion. They attributed this partially to fears
about people with epilepsy being “unreliable” and “abnor-
mal.”38 The prevalence of negative attitudes is sufficient to
indicate that people with epilepsy are likely to have experi-
enced them through enacted stigma, which refers to epi-
sodes of actual discrimination.39
Our study adds substantially to the literature on the expe-
rience of other psychosocial stressors in epilepsy including
domestic violence, physical and sexual abuse, and other
stressful life events. Previous work exploring these has been
largely focused on select populations with limited general-
izability.18–20 There is some evidence that the experience of
discrimination and of violence may interact. For example,
abuse from others has been studied in people with refractory
epilepsy and learning disability, and in this population, dis-
crimination due to health problems was experienced by
91%, and over half of the respondents reported having been
threatened or attacked because of their health problems.14
This could suggest that abuse follows the diagnosis of epi-
lepsy and forms part of the experience of discrimination. On
the other hand, stressors and life events may be considered
to have an epileptogenic effect.40 Previous literature has
also explored abuse in relation to people with nonepileptic
attack disorder,20,23–25 and some people assessed as having
epilepsy in our study may actually have this alternative
diagnosis.
In exploratory mediation analyses, we attempted to
understand the potential contribution of these psychosocial
adversities to the well-known excess burden of common
mental disorders in people with epilepsy. Our findings sug-
gest that a substantial proportion of the relationship between
epilepsy and common mental disorders could be explained
by the experience of discrimination, domestic violence, and
sexual abuse. However, it is important to note that making

 directional and causal inference is difficult in cross-sec-
tional studies, and various explanations may be possible.
For instance, these psychosocial stressors may be on the
causal pathway between epilepsy and common mental dis-
orders, or be confounders of the relationship. Finally, indi-
viduals with depression, anxiety, and both depression and
anxiety disorders might be more likely to recall or report
memories of stressors (Fig. 1). These questions can be
answered only by well-designed longitudinal studies.
Implications
Our study demonstrates that people with epilepsy face a
range of psychosocial adversities and extensively report
feeling discriminated against, even in a developed society
such as in England. The causal pathways between epilepsy,
psychosocial stressors, and mental disorders need to be
investigated in longitudinal studies. Such information may
lead to interventions that have the potential to reduce the
burden of common mental disorders in people with epilepsy
and improve quality of life. Continued efforts are needed to
develop and evaluate interventions to reduce epilepsy-
related discrimination. Finally, epilepsy clinicians should
consider that patient histories may also include episodes of
trauma or abuse and need to be aware of how to refer indi-
viduals to support agencies or further treatment.
