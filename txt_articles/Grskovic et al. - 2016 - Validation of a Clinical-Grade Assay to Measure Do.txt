The use of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker in transplant recipients offers advantages
over invasive tissue biopsy as a quantitative measure for detection of transplant rejection and
immunosuppression optimization. However, the fraction of donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) in
transplant recipient plasma is low and challenging to quantify. Previously reported methods to measure
dd-cfDNA require donor and recipient genotyping, which is impractical in clinical settings and adds
cost. We developed a targeted next-generation sequencing assay that uses 266 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms to accurately quantify dd-cfDNA in transplant recipients without separate genotyping.
Analytical performance of the assay was characterized and validated using 1117 samples comprising
the National Institute for Standards and Technology Genome in a Bottle human reference genome,
independently validated reference materials, and clinical samples. The assay quantifies the fraction of
dd-cfDNA in both unrelated and related donor-recipient pairs. The dd-cfDNA assay can reliably measure
dd-cfDNA (limit of blank, 0.10%; limit of detection, 0.16%; limit of quantification, 0.20%) across
the linear quantifiable range (0.2% to 16%) with across-run CVs of 6.8%. Precision was also evaluated
for independently processed clinical sample replicates and is similar to across-run precision. Appli-
cation of the assay to clinical samples from heart transplant recipients demonstrated increased levels of
dd-cfDNA in patients with biopsy-confirmed rejection and decreased levels of dd-cfDNA after successful
rejection treatment. This noninvasive clinical-grade sequencing assay can be completed within 3 days,
providing the practical turnaround time preferred for transplanted organ surveillance. (J Mol Diagn

Transplantation is often the most effective treatment option
for patients with end-stage organ disease. Organ transplant
patients require lifelong immunosuppression that necessi-
tates a finely tuned therapeutic strategy. Suboptimal dosing
and the threat of allograft rejection must be balanced with
increased risks of nephrotoxicity, diabetes, cardiovascular
complications, infections, and cancer that may result from
life-long immunosuppression. In this regard, a significant
unmet medical need exists for diagnostic tools, preferably
noninvasive, to assist clinicians who monitor the health of
the transplanted organ and manage immunosuppressive
therapy to improve short- and long-term outcomes. One of
the common procedures used to monitor organ health is
biopsy, which is invasive, subject to interpretation bias,
costly, and, at times associated with significant adverse
events.
Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been described as a
biomarker for prenatal testing, cancer, and organ trans-
plantation,1e4 each indication presenting different clinical

 and technological challenges. The presence of allograft (ie,
donor-derived) cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) circulating in the blood
of transplant recipients was first detected with PCR ampli-
fication of Y-chromosome genes in sex-mismatched trans-
plant recipients.5 Since then, multiple studies, using various
procedures, have shown that allograft DNA is detectable
and can be quantified as a fraction of total cfDNA in
recipient’s plasma,6e11 serum,12,13 and urine.14,15 Most of
these studies exploit the genetic polymorphisms that differ
between the donor and recipient, such as human leukocyte
antigen mismatch,12 differences in copy number deletions,16
and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).7e11 Whether
based on SNPs, human leukocyte antigen, or other genetic
differences,
using
digital
PCR,9,17
next-generation
sequencing (NGS),7,8,11 or other methods, all previously
described measurements of dd-cfDNA rely on knowledge of
donor and recipient genotypes, which requires significant
time and cost and depends on the availability of donor
genetic material.
To investigate the role of cfDNA as a biomarker of organ
injury associated with acute rejection, Snyder et al8
analyzed dd-cfDNA levels in heart transplant patients and
found significantly increased levels of dd-cfDNA in patients
with biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (2.75% �
1.81%, SD) compared to patients without evidence of
rejection (0.92% � 1.16%, SD). At the threshold of 1.70%,
receiver
operating
characteristic
analysis
demonstrated
sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 84%. Similar results
were obtained in a subsequent single-center prospective
study, in which heart transplant patients with either acute
cellular or antibody-mediated rejection exhibited signifi-
cantly higher dd-cfDNA levels compared to stable trans-
plant recipients.7 The levels of dd-cfDNA increased with
severity of rejection, with area under curve of 0.60 for
distinguishing mild, 0.83 for moderate-to-severe, and 0.95
for severe rejection events, each compared to the absence of
rejection. Furthermore, dd-cfDNA was found to be elevated
up to 5 months before the biopsy-proven rejection event,
suggesting a potential value of dd-cfDNA as an early
diagnostic marker of transplant rejection.7 Increased levels
of dd-cfDNA were also found to be associated with biopsy-
proven rejection in separate studies of pediatric and adult
heart transplant recipients.10,18
In
addition
to
heart
transplant
recipients,
elevated
dd-cfDNA was found to be associated with rejection in other
transplanted organ
settings.
In stable
liver transplant
recipients, dd-cfDNA levels were between 5% and 10%,
whereas in two cases of rejection dd-cfDNA levels increased
to 55% and 60%.9 In kidney, urinary dd-cfDNA was found to
be elevated with both acute rejection and BK virus nephrop-
athy, suggesting the role for urinary dd-cfDNA as a biomarker
of acute injury of the donor organ.14 In a study of lung
transplant recipients, increased levels of dd-cfDNA in plasma
correlated with severity of transbronchial biopsy grades, with
comparison of moderate-to-severe acute rejection versus
absence of rejection yielding an area under curve of 0.9.11
Beyond its value as a biomarker of rejection, dd-cfDNA
may be used as a guiding sensor for personalized immu-
nosuppressive treatment. For example, Oellerich et al17
compared
blood
trough
tacrolimus
concentrations
to
dd-cfDNA levels in 10 liver transplant patients and found
lower amounts of dd-cfDNA were associated with higher
tacrolimus concentrations. The possible role of dd-cfDNA
in
establishing
minimal
effective
trough
tacrolimus
concentrations suggests the wider potential of cfDNA in
monitoring of allograft health and detecting allograft injury
during optimization of immunosuppression.
Despite much progress in the methods to detect and
quantify dd-cfDNA, technical limitations have prevented
clinical implementation of dd-cfDNA as a diagnostic test.
Some methods used to measure dd-cfDNA levels are only
suitable for female recipients with transplanted organs from
males.5,6,13e15 Other methods require prior recipient and
donor genotyping, are time consuming, or are costly.7e9,11
In addition, each of these studies used research-grade tools
to measure dd-cfDNA. Robust clinical validity requires the
use of an assay with rigorously established analytical
performance. Once clinically validated, studies that estab-
lish the clinical utility can be performed by actively man-
aging patients according to the outcome of the biomarker.
Herein, we describe a targeted amplification, clinical-
grade NGS assay to quantify dd-cfDNA in transplant
recipients without the need for separate recipient or donor
genotyping. A panel of 266 SNPs was selected based on
allele
frequency
across
ancestral
heritage
groups,
sequencing accuracy, and lack of linkage. In addition, the
absence of genetic association of these SNPs with common
complex diseases avoids the challenges of reporting inci-
dental findings. Genomic regions encompassing each SNP
position are amplified, and each of the alleles is quantified
by NGS. The recipient genotype is determined at each SNP
position, and the relative fraction of dd-cfDNA is computed
on a validated analysis pipeline incorporating open source
and custom bioinformatic tools. The validity of the test was
demonstrated by establishing the sensitivity and reproduc-
ibility of the test on independent reference materials, and
clinical performance was demonstrated using heart trans-
plant recipient plasma.
Materials and Methods
Plasma Samples
Blood samples from healthy, nontransplant volunteers and
transplant patients were collected in 10-mL Cell-Free DNA
BCT tubes (Streck, Omaha, NE) and shipped to CareDx,
Inc. (Brisbane, CA), at ambient temperature in insulated
packaging to minimize temperature fluctuation. On arrival,
and within 7 days post-draw, plasma was separated by
centrifugation at 1600 � g for 20 minutes, followed by a
second centrifugation at 16,000 � g for 10 minutes, and
either plasma was stored at �80�C or cfDNA was extracted

 immediately using the Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen,
Redwood City, CA).
For the Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression
Observational (CARGO) II study, plasma from heart
transplant patients was drawn into a BD Vacutainer PPT
Plasma Preparation Tube (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA),
separated by centrifugation, and stored at �80�C. cfDNA
was extracted from thawed plasma using the Circulating
Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) and concentrated by centrifugal
vacuum concentration.
All transplant patient samples were collected in accordance
with institutional review boardeapproved study designs with
appropriate informed consent (full list of participating in-
stitutions is available in Supplemental Table S1). The
CARGO II study was designed to provide independent evi-
dence of the clinical performance of the noninvasive gene-

Reference Materials
Reference materials were developed by mixing cell line
genomic DNA (gDNA) fragmented by sonication (Covaris
SE220, Woburn, MA) to approximately 160-bp fragments
to simulate the size profile of cell-free DNA (Horizon
Discovery, Cambridge, UK). Three separate reference
material panels were constructed using a donor cell line
(RKO containing a single copy of EGFR T790M gene) and
three recipient cell lines (SW48, HCT116, and HCC-78).
Trace amounts of the donor DNA were mixed with the
recipient DNA at target levels ranging from 0.25% to 12%
to simulate different amounts of cfDNA originating from
donor. The amount of donor DNA was verified by Horizon
Discovery using digital PCR and a SNP genotyping assay
for EGFR T790M (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) on a
Biorad QX100 platform (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
The four cell lines were genotyped with the Infinium
CytoSNP-850K panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The chip-
based SNP genotyping provided an independent source of
comparison genotypes for the SNPs evaluated in the assay
on these same cell lines.
National Institute for Standards and Technology Genome
in a Bottle reference NA12878 (RM 8398) was obtained
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
and used to verify the accuracy of the sequence of each SNP
region and requisite SNP genotypes.
Three
cfDNA
reference
sample
panels
were
each
constructed by mixing cfDNAs from plasma samples
collected in Streck BCT from two healthy volunteers (one
donor and one recipient) and serial dilutions of that sample
with recipient cfDNA. cfDNA panel 1 was diluted 3-, 6-,
12-, 20-, and 30-fold. cfDNA panels 2 and 3 were diluted 6-,
20-, and 30-fold.
SNP Selection and Primer Design
For the dd-cfDNA assay to be applicable to different
transplant recipients without requiring separate genotyping
of either donor or recipient, SNPs were selected to ensure
that the same SNP panel could be used for individuals with
different ancestral heritages. We included 85 of 92 SNPs
previously identified as suitable for differentiating between
any two unrelated individuals.19 This combination of SNPs
has
an
extremely
low
probability
for
two
unrelated
individuals from across the globe having identical geno-
types. All SNPs have an average heterozygosity >0.4, and
the FST values are all <0.06 on 44 tested populations,
making these a universally applicable panel irrespective of
ethnicity or ancestry. We selected an additional 181 SNPs
based on the following criteria: minor allele frequency >0.4,
alleles with known low polymerase error, high coverage in
the dbSNP database (>1000 counts; http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/SNP), low linkage (>500-kb apart), no more than
one additional SNP with minor allele frequency >0.1 in the
amplicon, and no known association with disease. Primers
encompassing these 266 SNPs were designed with GC
content of <66% and the median amplicon length of 109
nucleotides (minimum, 100 nucleotides; and maximum, 130
nucleotides).

Supplemental Table S2.
Targeted Amplification and Sequencing
The dd-cfDNA assay is based on targeted amplification of
DNA regions harboring 266 SNPs and the measurement by
NGS of each allele contribution at each SNP position.
cfDNA extracted from 1.25 mL plasma or reference mate-
rials (described above, used at 3, 8, or 60 ng) was
preamplified in a single multiplex reaction with 266 primer
pairs for 15 cycles. Preamplified material was further
amplified using 48 limited complexity multiplexes (1 to 11
targets per reaction) on the Access Array microfluidic
system (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA). Index se-
quences and Illumina sequencing adapters were added to
each sample DNA by PCR, and the sample was qualified
and quantified by capillary electrophoresis. Up to 16
amplified samples were pooled in equimolar amounts, pu-
rified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA), and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq
instrument.

 Sequencing Data Analysis and SNP Allele Counting
The bioinformatic pipeline is hosted on a cloud-based
genome
informatics
and
data
management
platform
(DNAnexus, Mountain View, CA) to provide a secure
environment to host the clinical sequencing data, an
extensible pipeline that can handle increased capacity
without modification, and a sealed package to run the
validated process that is fixed. Quality control (QC)
processes and metrics were built around the pipeline to
ensure proper upload, processing, and results generation.
Each component was verified and documented in standard
operating procedures for critical parameters, and a set of
critical files for verification and testing was established.
The SNP allele counting pipeline included open source
and custom software. Bcl files were transferred to the cloud
environment and processed to FASTQ files. FASTQ
files were trimmed by TrimGalore! version 0.3.7 (http://
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore)
to
remove
barcode
sequences
(trimming
quality
minimum Z 30). Trimmed FASTQ files were aligned to a
custom reference specifically designed for the assay. The
custom reference was generated by concatenating sections
of genome comprising the targeted amplicons and 500-base
flanking regions on both sides of each amplicon using the
hg19 assembly (Supplemental Appendix S1). Alignment
was accomplished with BWA MEM version 0.7.9 (http://
bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) using Illumina 1.3 to 1.6 format.
SAM files were generated as intermediate output files of this
step. Samtools version 0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.
net) was used to convert SAM files into BAM files,
followed by BAM file sorting and indexing. Pileup was
accomplished by using mpileup of Samtools. Minimum
base quality of 30 and maximum number of reads per SNP
of 25,000 were used. Raw pileup files were produced as
input to a subsequent step of allele counting and tabulation.
Each pileup file contained base calls and base qualities for
each position sequenced in the target amplicons for each
sample. Each raw pileup file was parsed and reformatted
into a VCF file and pileup summary file as the final output
of the SNP allele counting pipeline.
Percent dd-cfDNA Calculation
The counts generated by NGS for each allele at each SNP
locus were examined, and the allele with a higher number of
counts was assigned primary and the other alternate desig-
nation. SNPs with total coverage <1000� or with more than
two alleles were excluded from further analysis. The alternate
allele frequency was calculated as the count of alternate
alleles/the total count of alternate and primary alleles. Back-
ground levels of alternate allele, resulting from amplification
or sequencing error, were subtracted from the alternate allele
frequency at each SNP site. The amount of background
subtracted from the allele frequency was 4.14 multiplied by
the background signal observed across non-SNP positions.
The value of 4.14 was empirically determined following the
observation that error rate at SNP positions is typically higher
than at non-SNP positions. The amount of background
subtracted was generally 0.03% to 0.05%.
The recipient genotype at each SNP was inferred
from the background-corrected alternate allele frequency.
A statistical procedure was used to infer a recipient hetero-
zygous cutoff in the range between 10% and 25%. SNPs that
had alternate allele frequency greater than or equal to a given
cutoff were called as recipient heterozygous, and SNPs that
had an alternate allele frequency less than the cutoff were
called as recipient homozygous. The SNPs called as recipient
heterozygous were not used further to estimate % dd-cfDNA.
A variable recipient heterozygous cutoff was necessary to
produce a high accuracy estimate for samples with low and
high donor concentrations.
The
percent
dd-cfDNA
was
estimated
from
the
background-corrected alternate allele frequencies of the
recipient homozygous SNPs. To further reduce the influence
of outliers, the highest 5% of SNPs called as recipient ho-
mozygous were discarded and the mean alternate allele
frequency of the remaining SNPs was calculated. Finally,
the percent dd-cfDNA was estimated by multiplying the
mean donor allele frequency with a multiplier based on the
level of relatedness between a donor and recipient. The
multiplier was determined based on the 5% fraction of
discarded SNPs and the expected distribution of donor ge-
notypes among the recipient homozygous SNPs (Table 1).
Sample Quality Control
To ensure accurate and robust dd-cfDNA reported results,
several quality control metrics were developed, and for each
metric a cutoff value was chosen, below or above which no
result was returned (Table 1): i) coverage variability, defined
as the CV of the total read counts across all SNPs; ii) the
fraction of recipient homozygous SNPs; iii) the number of
recipient homozygous SNPs; iv) background; and v) frac-
tion of SNPs with only one allele present.
Analytical Validation Plan and Analysis
A set of studies were performed to establish the analytical
performance
characteristics
of
the
dd-cfDNA
assay,
including determining limit of blank (LOB), lower limit of
detection (LOD), lower limit of quantification (LOQ), linear
range, accuracy, precision, and process reproducibility. The
upper limit of detection was not addressed in this study
because the percent dd-cfDNA calculation has a set upper
limit of detection at 25% dd-cfDNA. LOD and LOQ refer to
lower limit of detection and lower limit of quantification,
respectively. Samples (1115; 168 unique) were tested by
four different operators using two microfluidic systems and
four sequencing instruments, with each replicate run on a
different day as follows: i) For LOB: six replicates of each
of the four fragmented gDNAs (with no donor genome

 added) at three different input masses, 3, 8, and 60 ng (72
samples total); 26 replicates of HCT116 fragmented gDNA
at 8 ng and six replicates of each of the 15 cfDNA samples
obtained from healthy volunteers (90 samples total). All of
these samples have only one genotype and therefore are
blank for cfDNA from a second or donor genome. Input
mass for the healthy volunteer cfDNA samples was not
controlled so that samples tested reflect the range of yields
obtained. The input mass for these samples varied among
donors, but the within-donor replicates had the same input
mass. ii) For LOD, LOQ, and Linearity: twelve replicates
of each sample from the three reference panels at input mass
of 3 and 8 ng for each spiked-in level, and six replicates
of each sample from the three reference panels at input mass
of 60 ng for each spiked-in level. In addition, six replicates
of each of the three cfDNA reference panels at 8 ng input
mass for each spiked-in level. iii) Within-Run Precision:
duplicates at two targeted spiked-in levels, 0.60% and
2.00%, within each of 24 runs. iv) Across-Run Precision:
twelve replicates of each sample from the three reference
panels at input mass of 3 and 8 ng for each spiked-in level,
and six replicates of each sample from the three reference
panels at input mass of 60 ng for each spiked-in level. For
clinical samples, blood was collected in two Cell-Free DNA
BCT tubes (Streck, Omaha, NE) and processed indepen-
dently by different operators on different days.
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.2.0,
64 bit (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).
Analytical
parameters were calculated using
guidance provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute guidance document EP17-A2.20
LOB estimates were calculated using the nonparametric
method recommended in EP17-A2 via the R quantile
function.
All
replicates
of
blank
samples
passing
sample QC metrics were included for analysis. Limit
of
detection
estimates
were
calculated
as
follows:
LOD Z LOB þ cpSDL, where SDL is the standard devia-
tion of all replicates pooled across unique low-level
samples, and cp is a multiplier reflecting the degrees of
freedom of SDL. No normality transformation was required
before applying this method. Accuracy and linearity ana-
lyses using spiked-in samples required the reference, or
truth, values to be greater than or equal to the limit of
quantification, and to have measured dd-cfDNA values
greater than or equal to the limit of detection. Accuracy and
linearity analyses using Streck samples required only the
latter restriction. To properly reflect run-to-run variability,
all accuracy and linearity parameters are calculated by first
fitting simple linear regression models within a run, and
then averaging across runs.
LOD Assessment for Related Donor and Recipient Pairs
Because of the limited availability of reference material
from transplant recipients with related donors, for related
donor and recipient pairs, the LOB and LOD were estimated
using the alternate allele frequency information from indi-
vidual SNPs adjusted for genotype frequencies based on
degree of relatedness. This estimation was performed using
fragmented gDNA panels at input mass of 3 and 8 ng.
First, a set of SNPs that had no alternate alleles for
individual samples was identified. These were either
homozygous SNPs from blank samples or homozygous
SNPs with known identical genotype between the donor
and the recipient. Second, a zero cutoff was calculated as
the 95th percentile of a normal distribution fit to the low
alternate allele frequencies of these homozygous SNPs
without a donor alternate allele and with alternate allele
frequency <0.25%. The zero cutoff was 0.145%. Third, the
fraction of recipient homozygous SNPs with alternate allele
frequency higher than the zero cutoff was calculated for
each of 180 blank samples (no spike-in) from the frag-
mented gDNA panels and healthy volunteer cfDNA. The
95th percentile of the fraction higher than the zero cutoff
from these samples was 0.163. This is the fraction non-zero
LOB that was subsequently used to define the LOD for

 samples with related donor and recipient. Fourth, the
fraction of non-zero recipient homozygous SNPs (alternate
allele frequency higher than the zero cutoff) was calculated
for each sample from reference panels. Because the per-
centage of recipient homozygous SNPs that is expected to
carry the same allele as a donor SNP in unrelated donor/
recipient pairs is 25% (Table 1), the maximum average
fraction of non-zero SNPs in unrelated pairs is 0.75. The
fraction of non-zero SNPs for different related donor/
recipient pairs was modeled based on the expected genetic
similarity and the maximum average non-zero SNPs for
each sample from reference panels. Finally, an LOD for
related donor/recipient pairs was defined based on these
data. LOD is defined (Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute EP17-A2) as the minimum sample amount at
which 95% of the samples are detectable. Therefore, LOD
for related donor/recipient pairs was defined as the sample
with lowest percent dd-cfDNA for which 95% of the re-
peats are higher than the LOB.
Process Validation
The full assay process was validated end-to-end by
running 45 mock samples, both spiked-in samples and
blanks, from sample accessioning through the laboratory
workflow, data analysis, and reporting. Subsets of these
samples were assigned to commonly encountered work-
flow scenarios and tested to ensure that samples could be
reliably tracked and tested and results reported. Scenarios
included discrepant sample information handling, retest-
ing, and reanalysis.
Results
Clinical-Grade NGS Assay
We developed a clinical-grade NGS assay to measure the
fraction of dd-cfDNA in transplant patients (Figure 1).
cfDNA is purified from plasma, and selected SNPs are
amplified and sequenced to establish the allele counts for
each of the two possible alleles for each SNP. The relative
proportions of donor and recipient alleles are assigned and
calculated from the sequence data and used to estimate the
overall proportion of cfDNA from the donor. The assay
does not rely on prior genotyping of donor nor recipient.
Percentage of donor-derived cfDNA is computed on a
validated cloud-based analysis pipeline incorporating open
source and custom bioinformatic tools. Results are verified

to results from an 850,000 SNP array performed on refer-
ence standards. In addition, methods-based proficiency
testing was performed using the Genome-in-a-Bottle and
National Institute for Standards and Technology sample
(RM 8398), and the results corresponded to the established
sequences (data not shown). After the test development, the
standard

tory workflow, including results generation by the NGS

Reference Materials
Analytical
validation
of
dd-cfDNA
using
transplant
recipient plasma is hampered by the low abundance of
cfDNA in blood and the difficulty in obtaining a
sustainable source of patient-derived material spanning
various predetermined fractions of dd-cfDNA in total
cfDNA. Reference materials were therefore designed and
developed
to
represent
predefined
percentages
of
dd-cfDNA across a dynamic range previously observed in
transplant recipients, 0.25% to 12%.7e9 Availability of
large quantities of these reference standards allowed for
multiple replicate testing at each point in the dynamic
range at each of three different total input masses to assess
assay precision and variability.
The amount of total cfDNA in plasma varies among
transplant recipients. The distribution of total cfDNA
amounts in transplant populations was characterized using
purified cfDNA from 238 heart and 185 kidney transplant
recipients from D-OAR and DART studies, respectively
(Figure 2). Reference panels were diluted to three different
input masses, 3, 8, and 60 ng, representing the 1st, 17th, and
86th percentile, respectively, of the mass input of cfDNA
from clinical samples. Data for 8 ng are presented below,
and data for 3 and 60 ng are in Supplemental Figure S1.
Performance Characterization
To characterize the performance of the dd-cfDNA assay,
including determining LOB, LOD, LOQ, linearity, accu-
racy, and precision, 1026 samples (101 unique) were tested.
On average, 238 of 266 SNPs assayed per sample had
coverage >1000� and no more than two alleles and were,
therefore, included in the analysis. Of samples, 42 (4%)
failed during processing or sample QC and were therefore
not included in the analysis.
In accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute EP17-A2, LOB was empirically determined as the
95th percentile of 180 single-genomeecontaining (blank for
a donor genome) samples to equal 0.10% dd-cfDNA
(Figure 3A). The median % dd-cfDNA value for blank
samples was 0.02%.

qPCR assays are 106 and 103 nucleotides, respectively, matching the length of the amplicons in the dd-cfDNA assay.

 LOD is dependent on both the number of genome copies
in the assay and the number of SNPs that differ between
donor and recipient. For 8 ng input mass of sample with
unrelated donor-recipient pair, LOD was 0.16%; for 3 and
60 ng input mass, LOD was 0.19% and 0.15%, respectively
(Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure S1, A and B). Three
nanograms of sample with 0.20% dd-cfDNA contains
approximately 2 genome equivalents of dd-cfDNA; thus, the
assay can distinguish between 0 and 2 genome equivalents
of dd-cfDNA (Supplemental Table S3). For samples where
donor and recipient DNA differ in the least number of SNPs
(ie, where donor and recipient are siblings), LOD is 0.22%
and 0.28% for 8 and 3 ng of input, respectively (Figure 4
and Supplemental Figure S1C).
The precision of the assay was determined across 12 (for
3 and 8 ng input mass) or six (for 60 ng input mass)
replicates of the reference samples, and the limits of that
precision were identified to determine the LOQ. Figure 5A
shows the precision profile for all samples. As expected,
higher fractions of dd-cfDNA yield lower CVs, with a mean
CV of 7.2% across all samples tested. The LOQ is defined
as the lowest level of % dd-cfDNA measured at or above the
LOD at which the CV is <20%. As all of the samples tested
at 8 ng input mass had a CV <20%, for unrelated donor/
recipient pairs the LOQ equals the % dd-cfDNA for the
lowest sample tested, 0.20%. The LOQ for highly related
donor/recipient pair is equal to LOD, 0.22% (Table 2). The
highest
%
dd-cfDNA
sample
tested
measured
16%
dd-cfDNA and had a CV <20%. Therefore, the upper limit
of quantification is 16%. The upper limit of detection is
dictated by the assay design as 25% dd-cfDNA.
The accuracy of the assay was established by comparing
measured % dd-cfDNA results to the digital PCR results
obtained by the manufacturer of the reference materials
(Figure 5B). To assess the linearity of the dd-cfDNA assay
within the quantitative range, a simple linear regression was
fitted for each panel, input amount, and testing batch, and
inferred across batches (Figure 5B). The mean of within-batch
slopes is 1.275, mean of y-intercepts is �0.00083, and mean

 R2 value is 0.99819. These data indicate a linear and accurate
assay with minimal proportional or systematic bias.
To further validate the performance of the assay, refer-
ence samples were constructed from cfDNA extracted from
plasma drawn from normal healthy volunteers using Streck
BCT tubes (Figure 5C). Three sets of cfDNA samples were
prepared by mixing cfDNAs from two healthy volunteers
and performing serial dilutions of the sample with recipient
cfDNA. Linearity of the assay was confirmed by linear

Analytical performance of dd-cfDNA assay. A: Assay precision and limit of quantification (LOQ). Twelve replicates of each panel member at 3
(gray) and 8 ng (red) input mass, and 6 replicates at 60 ng (black) input mass were tested on different days by different operators across multiple instruments.
The CV (CV Z SD/mean � 100) for each of seven members from each of three panels is shown [panel 1 (circles), 2 (stars), and 3 (triangles)]. An exponential
decay function was chosen as a model for the relationship between CV and mean dd-cfDNA spiked-in percentage, such that CV z a þ b*exp (-g* dd-cfDNA).
This model was fit using nonlinear least squares. The LOQ was defined as the lowest level of % dd-cfDNA measured at or above the limit of detection at which
the CV was <20%. For 3-, 8-, and 60-ng mass input, LOQ is 0.37%, 0.22%, and 0.2%, respectively. Dotted line represents 20% CV. B: Assay linearity. Results
from 8-ng input mass are shown relative to orthogonal validation of reference material by digital PCR of the EGFR T790M gene [panel 1 (circles), 2 (stars), and

dd-cfDNA, horizontal error bars represent SD of digital PCR assay. Limited replicates of digital PCR at low dilutions resulted in large measurement error.

 regression fit to six replicates of these reference sample sets,
calculated as above for the reference materials, with mean
R2 value of 0.9914934 (Figure 5C).
Finally, assay precision was assessed across the quantifi-
able range within run, across runs, and in clinical samples
derived from heart transplant recipients (Table 3). Within-run
mean CV was determined based on 22 runs with paired 0.6%
and 2% dd-cfDNA samples at 8-ng input mass. Across-run
CVs were computed for the quantifiable range for 3-, 8-,
and 60-ng input mass. Blood was drawn and cfDNA derived
from two independent cfDNA preservation tubes (Streck)
from 22 transplant recipients. The % dd-cfDNA was deter-
mined in independent runs, and results compared (Figure 5D).
The average CV for samples <2% dd-cfDNA was 7.7%; and
for samples >2% dd-cfDNA, 4.5%. These data indicate a
highly reproducible and robust assay.
Process Validation
Rigorous process validations demonstrated a robust assay
system that accurately tracked and analyzed samples from
accessioning through the laboratory workflow, analysis
pipeline, and reporting. Summarized results of the acces-
sioning, testing, and reporting scenarios tested are shown in
Supplemental Table S4.
Distribution of dd-cfDNA in Plasma from Transplant
Recipients
Previous studies have described levels of % dd-cfDNA in
most transplant patients to vary between 0% and 2%.7,8 A
total of 185 plasma samples collected from 101 heart
transplant
patients
in
the
multicenter
observational
CARGO II study were analyzed for dd-cfDNA. The per-
formance and the linear range of the % dd-cfDNA assay
matched the range for dd-cfDNA present in plasma from
this representative set of heart transplant patient samples
(Figure 6A).
Increased dd-cfDNA Correlates with Biopsy-Proven
Transplant Rejection
To assess the validity of dd-cfDNA as a biomarker of
acute cellular rejection in organ transplant recipients,
plasma levels of dd-cfDNA were determined in heart
transplant recipients with a biopsy-confirmed rejection
and compared to levels of dd-cfDNA in nonrejecting
heart transplant recipients. Fifty-three samples were
selected from the CARGO II study based on clinical data
that defined the samples and consensus pathologist
reading of endomyocardial biopsy specimens. Rejection
was defined as agreement among two or more patholo-
gists that the biopsy grade was 2R or 3R, according to the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation
guidelines.21 Samples collected from patients without
rejection
(quiescent)
were
selected
to

 demographic metrics and days after transplant of the
rejection set. Nonrejection was defined as consensus
among three or more pathologists that the endomyo-
cardial biopsy was grade 0R. A t-test demonstrated a
statistical difference between rejection and quiescent
samples (P Z 0.008) (Figure 6B). In longitudinal
samples
from
a

transplant
patient
in
which
dd-cfDNA was elevated at time of biopsy-proven rejec-
tion, dd-cfDNA levels decreased after rejection treatment
with immunosuppressive drug (Figure 6C). These data
suggest utility of this biomarker for monitoring treatment
effectiveness in addition to identifying acute cellular
rejection.
Discussion
Sensitive noninvasive diagnostic tests for early detection of
transplanted organ injury and guided adjustment of immu-
nosuppression remain unmet clinical needs in solid organ
transplantation. The most common diagnostic method for
acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection, a
biopsy of the organ for histopathological interpretation, is not
optimal: it is invasive, dependent on heterogeneous sampling
of tissue, and susceptible to substantial interobserver vari-
ability.22,23 In a large representative multicenter heart trans-
plant study, CARGO II, the overall concordance of biopsy
interpretation among cardiac pathologists was found to be
71%, and the positive agreement for biopsy specimens
assigned a moderate or severe rejection grade (�2R) was
<30%.22 Substantial improvements in short-term transplant
survival have been realized; however, long-term survival has
remained essentially unaltered. Long-term survival has been
compromised
because
of
nephrotoxicity,
cardiovascular
complications, diabetes, infections, and malignancies resulting
from chronic and potent immunosuppression. dd-cfDNA in
the recipient’s blood and urine is a promising, potentially pan-
organ biomarker for monitoring the health of solid organ
transplants.4e15 Although cfDNA assays for research pur-
poses have been described, a clinical-grade assay has not been
reported. In this study, we validated an NGS-based targeted
amplification assay that measures the fraction of dd-cfDNA.
Validation was informed by NGS guidelines and recom-
mendations from professional organizations (College of
American Pathologists, American College of Medical Ge-
netics, Association for Molecular Pathology, American Soci-
ety for Human Genetics); and performed in a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendmenteregulated laboratory
in accordance with the NGS checklist established by the
College of American Pathologists.24e26
The overall performance of the assay was high: sensitive
to low levels of dd-cfDNA with precise quantification at
those levels. For input mass representing most transplant
samples, the LOD was 0.16%, which is lower than previ-
ously described cfDNA assays.27,28 To obtain sufficient
material for validation replicate testing, we designed
reference standards derived from mixtures of fragmented
cell line gDNA. Linearity studies using both the reference
materials and serially diluted spiked-in samples constructed
from blood drawn in Streck tubes showed the same assay
performance, confirming the appropriateness of the cell line
mixtures as reference materials. The amount of donor DNA
in reference standards was estimated by digital PCR using
an assay for a point mutation in the EGFR gene (T790M). %
dd-cfDNA measurements are highly reproducible, both
within and between runs. As expected, we observed tighter
CVs for samples with higher fraction of dd-cfDNA and
those with larger input mass, likely because of larger
absolute number of dd-cfDNA molecules in both cases. The
variability observed likely stems from sampling bias for low
input and low % dd-cfDNA samples, polymerase errors
during SNP amplification and sequencing library genera-
tion, and errors in NGS process itself.29 The use of high-
fidelity polymerase and relatively short read paired-end
sequencing (2 � 82) in this assay minimizes the library
preparation and sequencing errors.
By design, the assay detects trace amounts of a second
genome in the low levels of cfDNA present in plasma.
During the validation and post-validation testing, we did not
observe cross-contaminated samples, with blank samples
tested measuring lower than the LOD. Cross-contamination
of human genomic samples has been reported as an issue
in clinical NGS testing settings.30 To detect possible
contamination, each test run includes a blank control sample
and two control reference samples with known amounts of
dd-cfDNA; detection of any dd-cfDNA in control blank
sample or increased % dd-cfDNA in reference samples
invalidates the entire test run and no results are reported. In
addition, each sample is expected to contain a certain
number of SNPs that share the same allele between the
recipient and donor (based on the level of genetic related-
ness) (Table 1); if fewer than the expected number of such
SNPs is detected, sample will fail the QC criteria and no
result will be reported. National Institute for Standards and
Technology Genome in a Bottle reference NA12878 (RM
8398) was used to verify the accuracy of the amplification
and sequencing by examining each SNP region and requisite
SNP genotypes and comparing them to established values.31
Although not limited by the need for donor or recipient
genotypes, the design of this dd-cfDNA does lead to several
limitations that affect the population that can be served. The
upper limit of detection is 25% dd-cfDNA by design.
Although there are no reports of dd-cfDNA levels this high
in heart or kidney transplant recipients, baseline levels
appear to be higher in lung and liver transplant re-
cipients.9,11 We continue to evaluate samples from different
organ transplants to better define this limit. As with all tests
dependent on genomic differences, identification of dd-
cfDNA in identical twin donor/recipient pairs is not
possible; and the results may be impaired in the donor/
recipient siblings from consanguineous marriages. For dual
organ transplants from a single donor, the assay identifies

 graft injury, but does not distinguish the affected organ.
Last, multiple organ transplants (from different donors)
require the differentiation of the genotype among several
genomes, one recipient and multiple donors. Our current
algorithm does not address this constraint and therefore the
assay is currently limited to single-organ, single-donor
transplants. In multiple organ transplants where donor DNA
for each additional transplanted organ is available, it may be
possible to modify the assay such that the separately
determined donor genotype(s) is (are) used to determine the
level of dd-cfDNA in organ-specific manner.
Preliminary clinical validity of this assay is demonstrated
in heart transplant recipients with samples from patients
with biopsy-proven rejection having significantly increased
% dd-cfDNA compared to biopsy-proven quiescent pa-
tients. In addition, the levels and distribution of dd-cfDNA
in heart transplant recipients reported herein is in accor-
dance with levels and distribution reported previously.7,8,10
Although absolute % dd-cfDNA levels may differ among
types of assays with varying levels of analytical validation,
the ratio of mean rejection over mean nonrejection samples
is remarkably similar (2.9� for the assay reported herein
and by Snyder et al8). Additional clinical validity and
clinical utility studies are needed for dd-cfDNA to be
widely implemented in clinical practice. Two studies, D-
OAR and DART, have been initiated in conjunction with
large numbers of clinical centers. Early collection of sam-
ples in these studies was used herein to assess the distri-
bution of cfDNA mass collected from transplant recipients.
Ongoing collections will be used in case-control analyses to
establish clinical validity for dd-cfDNA and define the
distribution of % dd-cfDNA in the reference population.
The validation approach for multiple organ transplants will
be dependent on the information necessary to differentiate
signals. Multiple organ transplant from the same donor (eg,
heart/lung) may require validation of different thresholds
because of the baseline level of contribution from two or-
gans. The situation of organs from multiple donors will
require validation of the analytical methods to disambiguate
two donors, but may be bridged to single-organ, single-
donor clinical validations.
On collection of evidence in support of correlation of dd-
cfDNA with organ injury in clinical validity studies in
additional organs, there are several potential indications of
use that merit clinical utility studies. First, informing biopsy
decisions through enhanced interpretation of histological
findings of biopsy, to provide alternative to biopsy if the
benefit and risk of biopsy are not clearly supported, and to
reduce morbidity and increase cost-effectiveness of trans-
plant recipient surveillance. Second, detection of subclinical
organ injury to improve long-term outcomes and survival.
Third, immunosuppressive therapy optimization by nonin-
vasive monitoring and thereby reduction of infections and
malignancies,
and
improved
long-term
survival.
The
different types of organ transplants and relatively small
number of transplants and long-term nature of outcomes
challenge conventional trial designs. For example, we
anticipate that the thresholds and baselines may vary among
the different types of organ transplants, or for multiorgan
transplants. In this regard, an adaptive strategy, as suggested
for staged adoption of drugs, merits consideration.32 The
proposed adaptive strategy recognizes that evidence is a
continuum and may therefore facilitate timely pairing of
available evidence and clinical unmet need of specific
transplant patients.
In summary, we have developed and analytically vali-
dated a clinical-grade NGS test to measure the fraction of
dd-cfDNA in plasma of solid organ transplant patients. This
test is applicable to single-organ donor-recipient pairs and
does not depend on separate determination of either donor
or recipient genotypes. We further report preliminary clin-
ical validity results of the assay for heart transplant. Addi-
tional prospective clinical validity and utility studies will
inform how this clinical tool can be used to manage trans-
plant patients.
