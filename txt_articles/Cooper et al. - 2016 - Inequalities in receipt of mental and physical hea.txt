Abstract
Background: UK Dementia Strategies prioritise fair access to mental and physical healthcare. We investigated whether
there are inequalities by deprivation or gender in healthcare received by people with dementia, and compared healthcare
received by people with and without dementia.
Methods: we investigated primary care records of 68,061 community dwelling dementia patients and 259,337 people with-
out dementia (2002–13). We tested hypotheses that people with dementia from more deprived areas, and who are women
receive more psychotropic medication, fewer surgery consultations, are less likely to receive annual blood pressure, weight
monitoring and an annual review, compared with those from less deprived areas and men.
Results: only half of people with dementia received a documented annual review. Deprivation was not associated with health-
care received. Compared to men with dementia, women with dementia had lower rates of surgery consultations (adjusted inci-
dence rate ratio (IRR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.90–0.91), of annual blood pressure monitoring (adjusted IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.97)
and of annual weight monitoring (adjusted IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.90–0.93). Men with dementia were less likely to be taking psy-
chotropic medication than women with dementia. People with dementia had fewer surgery consultations and were less likely to
have their weight and blood pressure monitored at least annually, compared to the non-dementia group.
Conclusions: people with dementia, in particular women, appear to receive less primary healthcare, but take more psycho-
tropic medication that may negatively impact their physical health. Reducing these inequalities and improving access of peo-
ple with dementia to preventative healthcare could improve the health of people with dementia.
Keywords: dementia, healthcare disparities, deprivation, psychotropic drugs, equalities, medication, older people
Introduction
People with dementia have high rates of physical ill-health,
most commonly hypertension and diabetes [1] and of neuro-
psychiatric symptoms, that may be treated with psychotropic
medication, including antipsychotics [2–4]. Mental and phys-
ical well-being are key determinants of life quality and
independent living in dementia [5]. Improving physical health
may slow cognitive decline, by reducing cardiovascular path-
ology or functional impairment and improving diabetic
control [6].
In dementia, antipsychotic prescribing is associated with
cognitive decline [7], mortality [8], side effects, somnolence
and falls [9] and hypnotics and anxiolytics with cognitive

 decline [10, 11] and falls [9]. In 2009, the UK Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) high-
lighted risks of stroke and death with antipsychotics [12],
and a UK government-commissioned review prioritised
reducing their use in dementia [13]; UK usage has fallen
since these publications [14–16].
People with dementia may be at increased risk of social
inequalities. The reduced access to healthcare typical of the
oldest old, women and those with fewer socio-economic
resources may compound communication difficulties and
social isolation in people with dementia [17]. Socio-
economic factors may be implicated in dementia aetiology
[1]. Lower levels of education and worse physical health,
which are strongly linked to deprivation, are associated with
a greater dementia risk [2, 3]. Among people with dementia
those from more deprived areas, women and older people
are relatively less likely to receive anti-dementia drugs [18].
We aimed to investigate whether there are also social
inequalities in physical preventative healthcare provision
and psychotropic drug prescribing among people with
dementia, and to compare these outcomes in people with
and without dementia. We hypothesised, based on previous
findings, that women and people from more deprived areas
would access physical and mental healthcare less than their
counterparts [4, 5]. We selected variables from The Health
Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database to
test these hypotheses, constrained by data availability. We
judged that people with reduced healthcare access would be
less likely to receive a dementia review, and more likely to
be taking psychotropic medication, because medication for
short-term treatments of challenging behaviour would be
less frequently reviewed. We tested our hypotheses that
people with dementia from more deprived areas, and
women receive [1] more psychotropic medication [2], fewer
surgery consultations [3], are less likely to have had blood
pressure and weight monitoring and [4] an annual dementia
review recorded in the last year, compared with those from
less deprived areas and men.
Methods
Data
THIN primary care database contains anonymised informa-
tion on twelve million patients from over 500 participating
UK general practices (http://www.csdmruk.imshealth.com).
General Practitioners (GPs) record information on symp-
toms and medical diagnoses using the Read hierarchical clas-
sification system [19], and information on prescriptions is
entered onto the system automatically. Demographic infor-
mation recorded for each patient includes sex, year of birth
and Townsend deprivation score quintiles (see details below).
Study population
Individuals included in the study were under follow-up
while aged 50 years or over during the period 2002–13, and
had dementia, defined as a Read code for dementia
(see Appendix 1 for code list) or an anti-dementia drug pre-
scription (galantamine, rivastigmine, donepezil or meman-
tine). We excluded individuals for whom deprivation score
quintile data were not available (2%). For each practice, only
data from the date of acceptable levels of computer usage
and death recording were included, as inadequate recording
of events before these dates may lead to incidence being
underestimated [20, 21].
In this study, our focus was on people who were living
outside long-term care facilities. We identified and excluded
individuals who were likely to be resident in a long-term care
facility, based on the assumption that households with five or
more residents aged 70 or over on 1 January 2010 were such
facilities. For the psychotropic drug prescribing prevalence
and healthcare contact outcomes, patient data were addition-
ally required to contain at least 6 months of follow-up. For
each patient in the dementia cohort, we used a frequency
matching approach to randomly select up to five patients not
in the dementia cohort who were in the same practice, age
group and the same sex at the start of follow-up.
Measurements
A list of Read codes for dementia diagnoses was developed
using a published method [22]. We studied deprivation
using Townsend score quintiles [23]. This area-level depriv-
ation measure is calculated at the level of UK postcodes,
using 2001 census data on unemployment, car ownership,
home ownership and home overcrowding: quintiles are
based on the whole UK population. Prescription data were
used to determine initiation of antipsychotics, hypnotics
and anxiolytics. Healthcare contact outcomes were, over a
year: (i) number of surgery consultations; (ii) whether blood
pressure and weight had been measured; (iii) whether there
was a record that an annual dementia review (as required
for the Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) payment [24])
had occurred. Reviews involve assessment of physical and
mental health. Prevalence of an outcome was defined for
each 1-year period as the proportion of those under follow-
up during that period who had the outcome during that
year. Covariates included sex, UK country, age, and, for the
healthcare contact outcomes, a prescribing index as a meas-
ure of comorbidity (see details below). Age was analysed in
10-year categories. The prescribing index indicates the num-
ber of British National Formulary chapters from which
patients received prescriptions (excluding anti-dementia
drugs, vaccines and anaesthetics). This is a good measure
for comorbidity [25].
Analysis
We analysed data using Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp,
College Station, Texas). For the period 2002–13, we esti-
mated overall rates of initiation and prescribing prevalence
of antipsychotics, hypnotics and anxiolytics; surgery consul-
tations, annual blood pressure monitoring, annual weight
monitoring
and
annual
dementia
review.

 multivariable Poisson regression to investigate the relation-
ship between deprivation, gender and these outcomes.
Random effects for general practices were included in mod-
els
to
account
for
variation
in
individual
practices.
Comparisons were made to the cohort of patients without
dementia. Stratifying by Townsend quintile, incidence rate
ratios were calculated for outcomes comparing the demen-
tia cohort to the comparator non-dementia cohort.
Results
Included patients
A cohort of 68,061 patients was identified who had a
record of dementia while aged 50 or over during the period
2002–13 (Supplementary data, Figure S1, available in Age
and Ageing online); these patients were included in the ana-
lyses on psychotropic drug initiation. Of these, data were
available from 54,721 (80%) for at least 6 months of
follow-up, and so were included in the analyses on psycho-
tropic drug prescribing prevalence and healthcare contact
outcomes (Table 1). We included 259,337 people in our
control population without dementia.
Prescribing of psychotropic medication
The proportion of the 54,721 patients receiving at least one
prescription in a calendar year increased up to 2009, but
declined thereafter for antipsychotics, hypnotics and anxio-
lytics (Supplementary data, Figure S2(a)–(c) available in Age
and Ageing). During 2013, 3.1% of the 21,716 under follow-
up were prescribed antipsychotics, 2.4% were prescribed
hypnotics and 2.6% were prescribed anxiolytics. During
2009, when the psychotropic drug prescribing prevalence
was highest, 14.1% of the 16,043 then under follow-up were
prescribed antipsychotics, 10.6% were prescribed hypnotics
and 7.5% were prescribed anxiolytics. The proportion pre-
scribed antipsychotics ranged from 6.8% to 8.0% in the
deprivation groups; however, there was no systematic rela-
tionship between Townsend quintile and current prescribing
of antipsychotics (Table 2). Women with dementia were
more likely to be currently prescribed psychotropic medica-
tion than men with dementia. For example, 6.3% of men
were currently receiving antipsychotics, compared to 7.7% of
women, with an adjusted IRR (95% CI) of 1.18 (1.13–1.23).
Initiation of psychotropic medication
Overall, there was no systematic association between social
deprivation and the initiation of antipsychotics, hypnotics or
anxiolytics (Supplementary data, Table S1 available in Age
and Ageing). Men with dementia were more likely to initiate
all types of psychotropic medication than women with
dementia.
Consultations and healthcare monitoring in people
with dementia
The overall rate of surgery consultations was 6.8 visits per
year, with no systematic change over time (Supplementary
data, Figure S2(g) available in Age and Ageing). Annual blood
pressure and weight monitoring both increased over time,
and of the 21,716 patients who were under follow-up during
2013, blood pressure was recorded in 17,201 (79%) and
weight was recorded in 10,118 (47%) (Supplementary data,
Figure S2(d)–(e) available in Age and Ageing). From introduc-
tion in 2006, consistently around half of patients had a record
of receiving an annual dementia review (Supplementary data,
Figure S2(f) available in Age and Ageing). The crude rates and
proportions of these outcomes were similar across depriv-
ation score quintiles (Supplementary data, Figure S2 available
in Age and Ageing; Table 3). Of the 11,273 patients with a
dementia review during 2013, 5,657 (50%) had both weight
and blood pressure recorded during that year: of the 10,443
patients under follow-up in 2013 who did not have a demen-
tia review, 3,832 (37%) had both weight and blood pressure
recorded during that year.
Compared to men, women had lower rates of surgery
consultations (6.5 per person-year in women and 7.3 per
person-year in men; adjusted IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.90–0.91),
of annual blood pressure monitoring (72% in women and
75% in men; adjusted IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.97) and of
annual weight monitoring (36% in women and 41% in
men; adjusted IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.90–0.93).

 Comparator cohort of patients without dementia
Rates of initiation of antipsychotics, hypnotics and anxioly-
tics were higher overall in the dementia cohort compared to
the non-dementia cohort (Supplementary data, Table S2
available in Age and Ageing). People with dementia had fewer
surgery consultations and were less likely to have their
weight and blood pressure monitored at least annually, com-
pared to the non-dementia group, with similar differences in
each of the Townsend quintile strata (Supplementary data,
Table S2 available in Age and Ageing).
Discussion
Area-level deprivation was not associated with healthcare or
psychotropic medication receipt in people with dementia.
Only half of people with dementia received an annual
review as reimbursed by QOF. Among people with demen-
tia, female gender was associated with receiving fewer pri-
mary care surgery consultations and less health monitoring.
Men with dementia were more likely to be initiated on psy-
chotropic drugs, but less likely to be currently taking them.
Compared with our control population, people with demen-
tia had fewer primary care consultations and were less likely
to have weight and blood pressure monitored annually, des-
pite the association of dementia with vascular risk factors,
frailty and malnutrition [1], and were more likely to receive
psychotropic medications.
Our findings differ from general population studies that
found higher psychotropic prescribing levels in more
deprived areas in people without dementia [26]. Perhaps
government policies in the past decade, including targets
incentivising GPs to identify and review annually people
with dementia may have reduced inequities. One interpret-
ation of our findings is that people with dementia, not hav-
ing a family or friend carer to facilitate appointments may
be the most important barrier to care, rather than socio-
economic constraints per se. Interventions to increase under-
standing of dementia carers about the importance of main-
taining physical health and treating co-morbidities may
therefore be an important public health intervention.
Socio-economic
prescribing
inequalities
often
arise
because patients or carers from less deprived groups better
negotiate healthcare systems to seek out more desirable treat-
ments. Socio-economic gradients in psychotropic prescribing
have been attributed to differential access to alternate ser-
vices such as psychological therapies, or different patient or
carer expectations [26]. Perhaps this did not happen in peo-
ple with dementia because there are few psychological, evi-
dence based, routinely available treatments for behavioural
and psychological symptoms of dementia [27], or because of
the serious risks of initiating psychotropic drugs in dementia,
although we did not find inequity before the MHRA warn-
ings in 2009 [12]. In a previous study exploring the likelihood
of patients with physical health complaints being referred to
secondary care, inequalities associated with socio-economic
circumstances occurred more in the absence of explicit
guidance, whereas inequalities with older age and female gen-
der were evident for all conditions [28].
Having a dementia diagnosis predicted receipt of fewer
physical health checks and primary care contacts, despite
the National Dementia Strategies prioritising healthcare
access in this group. People with dementia often experience
difficulties arranging, remembering and attending appoint-
ments. Women with dementia are reported to have more
disability and disease than men with dementia [29], so it is
concerning that they receive less health monitoring. Despite
this, women were no less likely to receive an annual demen-
tia review, suggesting that the content of reviews should be
investigated, as preventative health monitoring should be an
important component. Women more often live alone, due
to their greater longevity [30]. The lesser likelihood of hav-
ing a co-resident carer might explain why women with
dementia access healthcare less.
Compared to men, women with dementia were less
likely to be initiated on psychotropic medication, but overall
more of these medications were prescribed to women indi-
cating they took them for longer. More regular medication
review could reduce unnecessary psychotropic prescribing.
As we found that men accessed healthcare more frequently,
there may have been more opportunities for review and
reduction where possible in line with current guidelines
[13]. In the general population, women are also more likely
than men to be prescribed psychotropic medication [31, 32].
Limitations
Surgery contacts might be lower in people with dementia
because they receive more home visits. We did not include
home visits in analyses as there is uncertainty about how well
they are recorded. Measures other than weight might be used
to assess malnutrition on home visits. We could not identify
people with undiagnosed dementia or control for dementia
severity. As area-level deprivation can reduce access to sec-
ondary care where most dementia is diagnosed, there may
have been more undiagnosed dementia in deprived areas; if
this were so, it is likely that early-stage dementia would be
most frequently missed due to symptom misattribution and
delayed help-seeking [33]. This could mean that the people in
more deprived areas had, on average, more severe dementia,
but we did not find higher rates of psychotropic prescribing
in these areas that might have suggested this. Women are
more likely to move to a care home [34]. Those who remain
at home might therefore have dementia which is on average
less severe than men living at home. This could explain the
lower rate of surgery consultations by women. The use of an
area-level deprivation measure is a limitation, as individual
deprivation level will sometimes be at odds to the deprivation
level of the area in which a person lives.
Conclusion
Only half of people with dementia have an annual dementia
review recorded, as recommended in UK guidelines and

 QOF. The QOF review for dementia has been associated
with fewer unplanned hospital admissions, so increasing the
proportion of patients who receive this may improve health
outcomes [6]. In people with dementia, women received
less physical healthcare monitoring, surgery visits and pre-
scriptions for psychotropic drugs. A greater likelihood of
women living alone without a family carer to help them
access healthcare probably explains some of these findings.
Enabling variables, such as having a carer to facilitate
attending appointments have also been shown to be
important determinants of people with dementias’ health-
care access in findings from other developed countries [7].
Interventions to improve access to physical healthcare and
reduce psychotropic use in people with dementia, especially
women, could benefit people with dementia, their families
and society by enabling them to live well with dementia for
longer.
Key points
• People with dementia received less primary, preventative
healthcare than people without dementia.
• Women with dementia received less primary, preventative
healthcare than men with dementia.
• Women with dementia were more likely to be taking psy-
chotropic medication than men with dementia.
