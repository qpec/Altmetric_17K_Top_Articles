IMPORTANCE To date, extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride has not previously been
compared directly with opioid medication treatment (OMT), currently the most commonly
prescribed treatment for opioid dependence.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as
effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining
abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label
randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between
November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23,
2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited
from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility.
Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized
participants.
INTERVENTIONS Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone,
4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered
intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical
trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days
of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use
of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.
RESULTS Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7%) were
women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to
buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release
naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, −0.1;
with 95% CI, −0.2 to 0.1; P = .04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days,
correspondingly (P = .33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed
noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of
opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference,
0.1 with 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.2; P < .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, −3.2 with 95% CI,
−4.9 to −1.5; P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, −2.7 with 95% CI, −4.6 to −0.9;
P < .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids
in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the
treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as
buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit
substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.

 S
ubstance use disorders involving opioids have a higher
risk of death, poly drug use, and blood-borne infec-
tions, such as HIV and hepatitis, than other substance
use disorders.1,2 Owing to the high risk of relapse and over-
doseinopioid-dependentindividuals,themostcommonlypre-
scribed treatment is opioid medication treatment (OMT), in
which opioids with longer absorption times and half-lives are
prescribed, such as the full opioid agonist methadone3 or par-
tial agonist buprenorphine hydrochloride.4 Because of the
injection-deterring potential of naloxone hydrochloride and
the better safety profile compared with methadone, daily
administration of combined buprenorphine and naloxone
(buprenorphine-naloxone) is the first choice of OMT medica-
tion in a number of countries. However, the extent to which
buprenorphine-naloxone deters injection in practice has
been debated.5
Opioid medication treatment is generally found to be ef-
fective in reducing illicit opioid use, overdose mortality,6 and
associated problems, such as criminal activity7 or injection-
related incidents.8 The disadvantages of OMT include contin-
ued physical dependence on and diversion of the prescribed
opioid.TheconventionalalternativetoOMTisfollow-upcoun-
seling of drug-free patients after detoxification, which car-
ries an increased risk of relapse to opioid use, especially soon
after leaving prison or inpatient treatment programs.9,10 The
reduction or loss of opioid tolerance following both short- and
long-term abstinence puts the individual at high risk of over-
dose if opioid use is resumed.11
The opioid agonist naltrexone hydrochloride has been pro-
posed as a third alternative to maintain opioid abstinence, but
in oral naltrexone treatment, low adherence, a high dropout
rate, and increased mortality have been described as serious
challenges.12-14 An alternative to the oral naltrexone product
now available is extended-release naltrexone, administered as
monthly intramuscular injections. Extended-release naltrex-
one inhibits the action of heroin and other opioid agonists by
a competitive blocking of the opioid receptors. This inhibition
hasproveneffectivecomparedwithplacebobothinlaboratory15
and clinical16-19 settings, and the effectiveness is in line with
previous studies on some implantable naltrexone formu-
lations.17,20Moreover,contrarytoOMTmedications,extended-
release naltrexone lacks abuse potential and should, in prin-
ciple, give opioid users a prolonged period of abstinence from
opioids with a high level of protection from relapse.
However, there is a lack of studies comparing extended-
release naltrexone treatment with OMT. Such studies would
provide novel information on differences in clinical effective-
ness and adverse event profiles between the 2 treatment ap-
proaches and allow clinicians to choose the most adequate
treatmentforagivenpatientaccordingtotheindividual’
sneeds
and motivation.
The aim of the present study was to compare the effec-
tiveness of extended-release naltrexone injections adminis-
tered every fourth week with daily oral buprenorphine-
naloxone in reducing the use of heroin and other illicit
substances in similarly motivated patients randomized to
either treatment after discharge from inpatient treatment or
detoxification.
Methods
This randomized clinical trial assigned 159 patients in a clini-
calsettingtotreatmentwithinjectionsofextended-releasenal-
trexone every fourth week vs daily oral buprenorphine-
naloxone. The protocol, including all outcome variables, is
provided in the Supplement; complete information about the
protocol is available in Kunøe et al.21
Inclusion was stopped on July 10, 2015, and the last pa-
tient follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. The study
was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and
Health Research Ethics South East Norway, the Norwegian
Medicines Agency, and the boards of research ethics at the par-
ticipating hospitals. Monitoring of the study was conducted
by the publicly funded Regional Monitoring Authorities at Oslo
University Hospital and Haukeland University Hospital (In-
novest) according to Good Clinical Practice standards. Partici-
pants provided written informed consent. They were not paid
or compensated for taking part in the study, with the excep-
tion of reimbursement of travel expenses. A lottery ticket in-
centive was offered for every urine drug test (UDT) adminis-
tered (value approximately $2 US).
Participants and Setting
Patients were recruited between November 1, 2012, and July
10, 2015, by study personnel from outpatient clinics and de-
toxification units at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway: Oslo
University Hospital, Akershus University Hospital, Hauke-
land University Hospital, Stavanger University Hospital, and
Vestfold Hospital Trust. Eligible participants were opioid-
dependent (according to DSM-IV criteria) men or women aged
18 to 60 years. Criteria for exclusion were other drug or alco-
hol dependence or serious somatic or psychiatric illness re-
garded as contraindications or in need of treatment that would
interfere with study participation. Women of childbearing age
could not be pregnant or lactating and agreed to use effective
birth control. Participants were screened for psychiatric dis-
orders using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Inter-
view 6.022 and examined for serious somatic disease. Eligible
Key Points
Question Are monthly intramuscular injections with
extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride as effective as daily
oral buprenorphine–naloxone hydrochloride in reducing the use of
heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified,
opioid-dependent individuals?
Findings In this 12-week, open-label randomized clinical trial
including 159 opioid users, treatment with intramuscular
extended-release naltrexone was as effective as oral
buprenorphine-naloxone in reducing the use of heroin, opioids,
and other illicit substances.
Meaning Maintaining short-term opioid abstinence with
extended-release naltrexone should be considered an equal
treatment alternative to buprenorphine-naloxone as
medication-assisted treatment for opioid-dependent individuals.

 participants were referred to a detoxification unit following
screening and inclusion. The study took place in an outpa-
tient setting, and all participants were discharged from de-
toxificationunits,inpatienttreatment,orprison.Ethnicitywas
defined by the participant.
Procedure, Outcomes, and Masking
After detoxification, participants were randomly assigned (1:1)
to commence either individually dosed buprenorphine-
naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d (target dose, 16 mg/d) given orally daily
in a controlled environment or extended-release naltrexone,
380 mg, given intramuscularly every fourth week for the fol-
lowing 12 weeks. Allocation to treatment group was comput-
erized using a permuted block algorithm provided by the re-
gional monitoring authority and not stratified for site or sex.
Following induction into either medication regimen, partici-
pants were asked to attend standard drug counseling, but no
behavioral interventions could be initiated. At baseline (in-
clusion) and every 4 weeks thereafter, patients underwent a
structured interview using the European version of the Ad-
diction Severity Index covering drug use, physical and men-
tal health, work, education, and criminal activity.23-25
Primary outcome variables were comparison of retention
in the study, the proportion of total number of UDTs without
illicit opioids, and number of days of use of heroin and other
illicit opioids. The weekly UDTs were analyzed using specific
chromatographicmethodsandcalculatedasthenumberofopi-
oid-negative urine drug screens divided by the total number
of attended tests (group proportion) in accordance with re-
cently revised Cochrane guidelines.26 Missing UDTs were con-
sidered as testing positive for opioids in all participants.
Since a number of participants were abusing illicit opioids
other than heroin at the time of inclusion, we discriminated
between such use.
Secondary outcome variables were number of days of use
of cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines, hal-
lucinogens, alcohol, the number of days of injecting (intrave-
nous) drugs, the degree of heroin craving (visual analog scale,
0-10, with 0 indicating none; 10, very strong), thoughts about
heroin (visual analog scale, 0-10, with 0 indicating none; 10,
constant or very frequent), life satisfaction (Temporal Satis-
faction with Life Scale–Present items, 5-35; with 5 indicating
very low; 35, very high),27 satisfaction with treatment (visual
analog scale, 0-10; with 0 indicating very low; 10, very high),
and mental health (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 of anxi-
ety and depression, 25-100, with 25 indicating very low; 100,
very high).28,29
Dataonheroin,otherillicitopioids,andsubstanceusewere
collected every fourth week by an interview using the time-
line follow-back technique, where participants reported the
number of days of use within the 28 days preceding each
interview.30 Retention in treatment was defined as the num-
ber of days until dropout from study medication and by the
number of patients completing the study at week 12.
Participants who completed this randomized clinical trial
were invited to continue or cross over to either treatment for
up to 48 weeks. These data will be described in a subsequent
publication.
Statistical Analysis
Minimum sample size was estimated in 2 scenarios. For the
noninferiority scenario with a power of 90% and significance
level of 5%, we assumed that both groups would retain 70%
of their participants at the end of week 12 and set 20% as the
noninferiority margin; this yielded a minimum sample size of
58 in each group (116 total).
The superiority scenario assumed extended-release nal-
trexone participants to have a mean of 7 opioid-negative
samples out of the total 12 (0.58) samples, while participants
receiving buprenorphine-naloxone would display a mean of
4 opioid-negative samples (0.33). Assuming an SD of 3.0 in
both groups and a significance level of 5%, the estimated
sample size would be 17 patients per medication arm (34
total) as sufficient to show a significant difference between
the arms with a power of 90%. Intention-to-treat analyses of
efficacy end points were performed with all randomized
participants.
Differences in primary and secondary outcomes were as-
sessed by linear mixed models with fixed effects for time,
group, and the interaction between the 2 variables. Random
effects for time and site were included in the models. A sig-
nificant interaction implied differences between the groups’
changes throughout the follow-up. The models were also ad-
justed for age and sex.
Noninferiority analyses were performed by linear mixed
models, where a nonsignificant interaction between time and
group was eliminated. Regression coefficients for group vari-
ables were combined with the predefined noninferiority mar-
gins (8 for heroin, 10 for illicit opioids, and 0.2 for opioid-
negative UDTs).
The normality of residuals was assessed by inspecting
the histograms. Bootstrap inference based on 1000 replica-
tions was generated in the case of skewed residuals; how-
ever, differences were negligible and the original results
were reported. Adverse events were compared using Fisher
exact test. Retention in treatment was assessed by a log-
rank test.
The results at P < .05 were considered significant in all su-
periority analyses. The noninferiority analyses were assessed
by 1-sided test at the same significance level. Statistical analy-
seswereconductedbyastudy-independentstatisticianblinded

formed in SPSS, version 24 (SPSS Corp) and SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute).

 women and 85.0% of the men were white. Four participants
were HIV positive, and 86 (54.1%) tested seropositive for
hepatitis C. The mean daily dose of buprenorphine-naloxone
during the study was 11.2 mg (range, 6-24 mg). Other charac-
teristics are reported in Table 1.
Retention in Treatment
Among the 232 participants assessed for eligibility, 165 were
included in the study and 159 were randomized to treatment
with extended-release naltrexone (80 [50.3%]) or buprenor-
phine-naloxone (79 [49.7%]). Reasons for exclusion of 73 in-
dividuals were refusal to participate (51 [69.9%]), not meet-
inginclusioncriteria(9[12.3%]),faileddetoxification(6[8.2%]),
and other reasons (7 [9.6%]) (Figure 1). Among the random-
ized participants, 143 agreed to commence their medication:
71 (49.7%) in the extended-release naltrexone group and 72
(50.3%) in the buprenorphine-naloxone group.

study (mean [SD], 69.3 [25.9] and 63.7 [29.9] days, respec-

tained in the extended-release naltrexone group was nonin-
ferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, −0.1;
95% CI, −0.2 to 0.1; P = .04).

Primary Outcomes
Treatment with extended-release naltrexone was noninferior
to buprenorphine-naloxone regarding the group proportion
of the total number of opioid-negative UDTs (mean [SD], 0.9
[0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively; mean difference, 0.1 with
95% CI, −0.04 to 0.2; P < .001). Regarding days of use of
heroin (mean difference, −3.2 with 95% CI, −4.9 to −1.5;
P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, −2.7 with
95% CI, −4.6 to −0.9; P < .001), extended-release naltrexone
treatment showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone
under the predefined conditions. Assessing superiority of 1
treatment over the other showed no significant differences
between the treatment groups in the proportion of negative
UDTs (P = .18). However, extended-release naltrexone par-
ticipants used significantly less heroin at all time points and
less other illicit opioids at weeks 4 and 8, even though the
pattern of use was not significantly different between groups
(P = .64 for heroin, P = .71 for illicit opioids).

 Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences between the treatment
groups in the pattern of use of amphetamine (P = .73), co-
caine (P = .13), alcohol (P = .21), cannabis (P = .78), or inject-
ing drugs (P = .68) (Figure 2). However, participants receiv-
ing extended-release naltrexone had a significant reduction in
daysofbenzodiazepineuse(P = .04),whilethebuprenorphine-
naloxone group remained stable. There were no significant dif-
ferences between groups at different time points. Hallucino-
gens were used once or twice by 5 participants receiving
extended-release naltrexone and 4 receiving buprenorphine-
naloxone (Table 2).
At all time points, participants receiving extended-
release naltrexone reported significantly less heroin craving
and thoughts about heroin (Table 2) than did buprenorphine-
naloxone participants. Satisfaction with treatment was sig-
nificantly higher among extended-release naltrexone partici-
pants and they would also recommend their treatment to
others to a higher extent compared with buprenorphine-
naloxone participants. Life satisfaction was significantly
higher among extended-release naltrexone participants at
weeks 4 and 8, but not at week 12. The Hopkins Symptom
Checklist-25 scores showed no significant differences
between the groups. Correcting the analyses for sex and age
did not change the results.
Adverse Events
More adverse events were reported by extended-release nal-
trexonethanbuprenorphine-naloxoneparticipants(49[69.0%]
vs 25 [34.7%]; P < .001), but only 10 participants discontinued
treatment owing to adverse events: 4 in the extended-release
naltrexone group and 6 in the buprenorphine-naloxone group.
Anumberofeventswererelatedtoinducedorexperiencedwith-
drawal symptoms, such as nausea, chills, shivering, diarrhea,
and sneezing, and were more frequent among the extended-

Discussion
Toourknowledge,thisisthefirststudycomparingtheeffective-
nessofextended-releasenaltrexoneinjectionswiththatofdaily
oralbuprenorphine-naloxone,thestandardOMTinNorwayand
other countries. Treatment with extended-release naltrexone
was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining re-
tentionintreatmentandreducingtheuseofheroin,otherillicit
opioids, and the use of other illicit substances except cannabis;
injectingbehavior;andcravingforopioids.Themainclinicalim-
plication of these findings is that extended-release naltrexone
seems to be as safe and effective as buprenorphine-naloxone
treatment for maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin,
opioids, and other illicit substances in opioid-dependent indi-
vidualsnewlydetoxifiedand/ordischargedfrominpatienttreat-
mentorprison.Sincewediscriminatedbetweenheroinandother
illicit opioids, mainly oral formulations, our data also seem to
beclinicallyrelevantforthegrowingnumberofindividualswho
are addicted to prescribed opioids.
Induction into extended-release naltrexone treatment re-
quired full detoxification to a greater extent than into the bu-
prenorphine-naloxone treatment. The Norwegian guidelines
for detoxification of opioid users turned out to be insufficient
for study detoxification and frequently produced adverse ef-
fects related to withdrawal symptoms on induction of ex-
tended-releasenaltrexoneand,tosomeextent,buprenorphine-
naloxone. We therefore changed our detoxification strategy
during the first year of the study in accordance with the most
recent literature at the time of our study,31-33 which reduced
thenumberofnewadverseeventsrelatedtoinductionoftreat-
ment. Serious adverse events were equally distributed be-
tween the groups and were not directly related to the given
treatment, which explains why there were no dropouts among
participants reporting a serious adverse event.
Satisfaction with treatment and willingness to recom-
mendtheirtreatmenttoothersweresignificantlyhigheramong
extended-release naltrexone participants. This finding may be
due to the perception of being protected against relapse of opi-
oid use and possible overdose and better opportunities to re-
turn to work or educational activities when not having to meet
daily or every second day for supervised intake of an opioid
agonist. However, the high availability of OMT in Norway34
makes it likely that the majority of participants were mainly
motivated to receive the novel extended-release naltrexone
treatmentandnotbuprenorphine-naloxone.Astreatmentpref-
erence has been shown to be important for treatment satis-
faction and adherence in other settings,35,36 it is difficult to
know whether extended-release naltrexone would be equally
effective in individuals with lower motivation for opioid
abstinence.
There was only 1 reported overdose in the study, which is
much lower than most reports on the first 12 weeks after dis-
charge from treatment or prison.9,37,38 This low rate may re-
flect the high motivation for treatment and good response to
regular follow-up by the same study worker in this group of
participants.
The rather low reported mean use of opioids the last 30
days before inclusion is probably due to the fact that a num-
ber of participants included in the study had already com-
pleted detoxification or had sustained abstinence for varying
periods of time (prison or inpatient treatment), while others
were still actively using opioids at study enrollment.
The doses of buprenorphine-naloxone used in the study
wereadjustedtocommunity-basedpracticerepresentingtreat-
ment as usual. Our mean daily dose of 11.2 mg therefore cor-
respondedfairlywellwiththe2016NationalOMTReportmean
dose of 13 mg/d.39
Limitations
One limitation of the present study is the lack of blinding. How-
ever,previousblindedplacebo-controlledstudiesinclinical16,17
and laboratory15 settings seem sufficient to prove efficacy for
the extended-release naltrexone medication. Owing to an in-
creased risk of overdose in newly detoxified opioid users, the
use of placebo and/or masking of medications were consid-
ered unethical. In addition to substantial practical challenges

 in managing 4 different medication arms, we regard most pa-
tients as capable of demasking or recognizing their respective
treatmentsquickly,giventheirlongexperiencewithopioiduse.
Since we wanted to perform the study in a naturalistic setting,
attempts to demask the treatment could easily be a disturbing
element interfering with a true-effectiveness assessment. We
therefore question the value of such a scheme in clinical trials
for opioid dependence.
Conclusions

naltrexone should be an available treatment option for opioid-
