Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome; its rising
prevalence parallels the rise in obesity and diabetes. Historically thought to result from overnutrition
and a sedentary lifestyle, recent evidence suggests that diets high in sugar (from sucrose and/or high-
fructose corn syrup [HFCS]) not only increase the risk of NAFLD, but also non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). Herein, we review the experimental and clinical evidence that fructose precipitates fat accumu-
lation in the liver, due to both increased lipogenesis and impaired fat oxidation. Recent evidence sug-
gests that the predisposition to fatty liver is linked to the metabolism of fructose by fructokinase C,
which results in ATP consumption, nucleotide turnover and uric acid generation that mediate fat accu-
mulation. Alterations to gut permeability, the microbiome, and associated endotoxemia contribute to
the risk of NAFLD and NASH. Early clinical studies suggest that reducing sugary beverages and total fruc-
tose intake, especially from added sugars, may have a significant benefit on reducing hepatic fat accu-
mulation. We suggest larger, more definitive trials to determine if lowering sugar/HFCS intake, and/or
blocking uric acid generation, may help reduce NAFLD and its downstream complications of cirrhosis
and chronic liver disease.

Introduction
‘‘Apicius made the discovery, that we may employ the
same artificial method of increasing the size of the
liver of the sow, as of that of the goose; it consists
in cramming them with dried figs, and when they
are fat enough, they are drenched with wine mixed
with honey, and immediately killed.”
Pliny the Elder (The Natural History 1ST Century
AD, eds John Bostock, Thomas Henry Riley)
Fructose is a simple sugar that is present in fruit
and honey, but is also a major component of the
two most commonly used sweeteners, sucrose
(table sugar, a disaccharide of fructose and glu-
cose), and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS, a mix-
ture of fructose and glucose monosaccharides).
Fructose intake has increased markedly over the
last several hundred years in parallel with the rise
in intake of sucrose and HFCS. Currently the intake
of added sugars approaches 15% of overall energy
intake in the average western diet, with higher
intakes among younger individuals (adolescents
and adults in their twenties) and among ethnic
minorities (African American, Hispanic, Native
American, and Pacific Islanders).1–4
The association between fructose and fatty liver
dates back to Pliny the Elder who noted that the
famous Roman chef, Marcus Apicius, would make
fatty liver (foie gras) by feeding geese dates (a rich
source of fructose). Later the German chemist, Jus-
tus von Liebig, made the observation that simple
carbohydrates stimulated fat accumulation in the
liver. Indeed, by the 1960s numerous scientists
reported that fructose was distinct from glucose
in its unique ability to increase both plasma triglyc-
erides and liver fat.5–7 Metabolic studies in which
fructose was labelled showed a two- to threefold
greater labelling of plasma and liver triglycerides
than that observed with glucose.8 However, the
overall amount of fructose being converted to
triglycerides was relatively small (1 to 3% of the
fructose), and did not account for the lipogenic
response observed.9,10 This led some scientists to
question the importance of fructose as a means of
stimulating lipid synthesis and accumulation.
However,
the
importance
of
fructose
re-
emerged with a report in this journal linking
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, and in par-
ticular fructose, with non-alcoholic fatty liver dis-
ease (NAFLD),11 an association that has been
confirmed in numerous other studies and is now
a major area of research.12–15 Herein, we provide
an update on the association and potential mech-
anisms by which fructose causes fatty liver. A key
finding is that the fructose molecule itself is not
primarily responsible for making triglycerides,
but rather fat accumulates in the liver by the gen-
eral activation of lipogenesis and blocking of fatty
acid oxidation.16,17 Indeed, the weight of studies
strongly suggest that sucrose and HFCS are major
risk factors for NAFLD.

 The discovery of NAFLD and its association
with metabolic syndrome
The association of diabetes with liver disease and
gout has been known for over 120 years18 and is
strongly
associated
with
insulin
resistance.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the strongest predictor
of NAFLD-related hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.19
However, the recognition that people with obesity
and
prediabetes
could
develop
NAFLD
only
emerged in the last several decades.20–22 Many
patients
with
NAFLD
show
characteristics
observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome,
including elevated plasma triglycerides, low HDL
cholesterol, impaired fasting glucose levels, an
increased waist circumference, and elevated blood
pressure.23 Indeed, NAFLD can be viewed as
another clinical manifestation of the metabolic
syndrome, like hyperuricemia, systemic inflam-
mation
(elevated
C
reactive
protein),
and
microalbuminuria.
NAFLD was not recognised as a clinical entity
until the 1980s,20–22 but it has since been increas-
ing in prevalence. It may progress to non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) or cirrhosis, with some
patients eventually requiring liver transplanta-
tion.24,25 NAFLD is also the most common chronic
liver disease in children and adolescents, espe-
cially in
obese
patients,
and
has even
been
detected in infants of mothers with gestational
diabetes, making this disorder relevant across a
wide spectrum of ages.26–28 Thus, identifying the
aetiologies of NAFLD represents a major goal.
Soft drinks and added sugar are associated
with fatty liver
While fructose is present in honey and fruits, the
major source of fructose is from sucrose and HFCS,
especially in sugar-sweetened beverages. While
sucrose-containing drinks have equal amounts of
glucose and fructose, HFCS-containing beverages
have varying ratios, usually varying from a 55/45
or 65/35 fructose:glucose ratio.29
Experimental studies
Dietary fructose, sucrose, or HFCS have been
shown to have a particular tendency to induce
fatty liver6,17,30–34 and inflammation35 in experi-
mental animals. To develop the fatty liver, it usu-
ally takes at least 8–24 weeks on a high-fructose
diet, with more progressive disease requiring
longer exposure.36 Often the administration of
fructose also induces other features of metabolic
syndrome as well, including elevated blood pres-
sure, elevated serum triglycerides, and insulin
resistance.37 In part, the fatty liver may be caused
by increased energy intake, as high fructose intake
induces leptin resistance in rats.38,39 However, if
diet is controlled so that the control group ingests
the same amount of total energy, the fructose-fed
rats will still develop features of metabolic syn-
drome, although weight gain will not be different
between groups.37,40 Indeed, one can even induce
fatty liver with a calorically restricted diet if the
diet is high (40%) in sugar.41 Others have also
reported that a high-fructose diet can induce fatty
liver in the absence of weight gain.35
Fructose has also been administered to pri-
mates. In one study in cynomolgus monkeys
(M. fascicularis), the administration of fructose
was shown to result in both an increase in liver
fat and hepatic fibrosis after seven years, with the
degree of fibrosis correlating with the length of
fructose exposure.42 Fructose-induced metabolic
syndrome can also be induced in rhesus monkeys.43
Based on comparative studies in which isocalo-
ric
diets
were
administered
using
sucrose
(glucose-fructose disaccharide) or a 50:50 mixture
of glucose and fructose monosaccharides, the
monosaccharide mixture appears to induce more
fatty liver, although the differences are slight.34
This may relate to differences in absorption or
other pharmacokinetics.
Endogenously
generated
fructose
may
also
have a role in fatty liver and NAFLD.44 For exam-
ple, the administration of high concentrations of
glucose in drinking water will lead to obesity,
insulin resistance and fatty liver in mice over
time.44 Our group reported that high levels of glu-
cose in the portal vein can induce the expression
of aldose reductase in the liver, which can convert
the glucose to sorbitol, which is then further meta-
bolised to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (the
polyol pathway). Indeed, glucose fed mice show
increased fructose levels in their liver, and when
fructose metabolism is blocked (by giving glucose
to fructokinase knockout mice) the animals are
almost completely protected from fatty liver and
insulin resistance, and are partially protected from
obesity.44
The NAFLD so commonly observed in patients
with diabetes may also represent the effects of
endogenous fructose accumulation. Indeed, either
knocking down aldose reductase mRNA in the
liver, or treatment with aldose reductase inhibi-
tors, can attenuate hepatic steatosis in the type 2
diabetic (db/db) mouse.45
Clinical studies
Sugar-sweetened beverage drink intake is also
strongly
associated
with
NAFLD
in
humans.
Ouyang et al.11 compared individuals with NAFLD,
without cirrhosis, to controls that were matched
for age, sex and BMI. Individuals with NAFLD had
a two- to threefold higher intake of fructose from
sugar-sweetened beverages than controls, and this
was associated with an increased expression of
fructokinase in the liver.11 Subsequently, fructose
from soft drinks has been associated with NAFLD
in children, adolescents and adults, where it corre-
lates with the severity of hepatic fibrosis in a dose-
dependent manner.11,13,46–52 Fructose intake has
also been shown to predict the development of
NAFLD.53

 Clinical studies also suggest a role for fructose
in NAFLD. For example, administering sugary bev-
erages to humans for six months resulted in
increases in liver fat that were confirmed by mag-
netic resonance spectroscopy.54 Conversely, the
restriction of fructose for nine days in children
with a high baseline fructose intake resulted in
both a reduction in liver fat and de novo lipogene-
sis compared to controls fed an isocaloric diet.55 In
a subset of the same study, there was also an
improvement in other features of metabolic syn-
drome, including diastolic blood pressure, serum
triglycerides and insulin resistance.56
While experimental and clinical studies suggest
an association between fructose intake and NAFLD,
there is one epidemiological study from Finland
that found an inverse relationship between fruc-
tose intake and NAFLD, but less than 10% of this
population consumed soft drinks, and fruit intake
was much more prevalent.57 While fruits contain
fructose, they are less likely to induce metabolic
syndrome because of the lower fructose content
per fruit (compared to a soft drink) and because
they also contain constituents (flavonols, epicate-
chin, ascorbate, and other antioxidants) that may
combat the effects of fructose.58
In addition to the aforementioned clinical stud-
ies, the rise in documented NAFLD prevalence in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) database (using a validated,
noninvasive measurement,59 the US Fatty Liver
Index), relative to the rise in obesity and added
sugar consumption (refined beet, and sugar cane
sucrose and HFCS) is shown for the periods from
1988–1991, 1999–2000, 2003–2004 and 2011–
2012 (Fig. 1).60–62 There is a clear association
between fructose intake from added sugars and
the rise in obesity and NAFLD.
Fructose effect on lipogenesis and fat
oxidation
Fructose intake has been shown to stimulate de
novo lipogenesis in animals, as well as to block
hepatic b-fatty acid oxidation.16,17,63 Similarly,
studies in humans have also shown that fructose
stimulates de novo lipogenesis and blocks fatty acid
oxidation in the liver.13,63–66 Fructose acutely
(hours) stimulates thermogenesis and metabolic
rate,67,68 but it has been shown to chronically (days
to weeks) reduce resting energy expenditure.66
The mechanisms for these effects are discussed
later, but it is evident how these processes could
lead to fat accumulation in the liver and elsewhere.
Differences in fructose and glucose
metabolism
In order to understand how fructose intake might
predispose an individual to the development of
fatty liver, one must know how fructose metabo-
lism is distinct from glucose metabolism. Glucose
is metabolised primarily by glucokinase or hexok-
inase, whereas fructose is principally metabolised
by fructokinase. Fructokinase utilises ATP to phos-
phorylate fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, fol-
lowed
by
the
metabolism
by
aldolase
B
to
generate D-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone
phosphate. From this stage on, fructose metabo-
lism is similar to glucose metabolism, and results
in the generation of glucose, glycogen, and triglyc-
erides.69 Thus, the unique aspect of fructose meta-
bolism lies in its first two enzymatic steps (Fig. 2).
The principal isoform of fructokinase in the
liver is fructokinase C, which phosphorylates fruc-
tose rapidly and without any negative feedback
control, resulting in a drop in ATP and intracellular
phosphate.70–73 The fall in intracellular phosphate
activates the enzyme, adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) deaminase, that converts AMP to inosine
monophosphate (IMP), resulting in purine nucleo-
tide turnover that culminates in the formation of
uric acid.74 Fructose also stimulates the synthesis
of uric acid from amino acid precursors.75,76 The
ability of fructose to induce ATP depletion was
shown in humans with both intravenous49,70,77,78
and orally79 administered fructose. Likewise, an
acute rise in uric acid also occurs following fruc-
tose ingestion.80–82 Thus, a unique aspect of fruc-
tose metabolism is the transient decrease in
intracellular phosphate and ATP levels, associated
with nucleotide turnover and uric acid generation,
which does not occur during glucose metabolism.
This fall in ATP level induces a series of reactions,
including a transient block in protein synthesis,
induction of oxidative stress, and mitochondrial
dysfunction that turn out to have a key role in
fructose-mediated effects.17,70,83

by fructokinase C results in the breakdown of AMP

 to IMP and the generation of uric acid (Fig. 2),
which is primarily due to a fall in intracellular
phosphate that occurs following the rapid phos-
phorylation of fructose by fructokinase C in the
liver.70,71 In contrast, fructokinase A is a second
isoform of fructokinase and is more ubiquitously
expressed, differing from fructokinase C in that it
phosphorylates fructose less efficiently and does
not cause significant ATP depletion.84,85 We have
observed that mice lacking both fructokinase C
and A are protected from fructose-induced fatty
liver, while fructokinase A-knockout mice develop
worse fatty liver than wild-type animals despite
ingesting similar amounts of fructose.85 These ani-
mals also show evidence of increased metabolism
of fructose through the fructokinase C pathway
and have higher intrahepatic uric acid levels.85 In
addition, another study by Softic, et al.85 found
that fructose, but not glucose drove lipogenic
enzymes and insulin resistance through fructoki-
nase, and that fructokinase levels are elevated in
fructose-fed mice as well as obese humans with
NASH.86 Thus, these studies suggest that there is
a unique property of the fructokinase C pathway
that leads to hepatic steatosis, raising the possibil-
ity that hepatic steatosis may relate to transient
ATP depletion, intracellular phosphate depletion
or uric acid generation.16
Gut permeability and the microbiome
One potential mechanism by which fructokinase
may drive fatty liver is via actions on the gut.
While fructokinase C is the main enzyme that
metabolises fructose in the liver, it is also highly
expressed in the small intestine. We have found
that the metabolism of fructose in the intestine
results in disruption of the tight junctions and that
this is not observed in fructokinase knockout
mice.87 This is likely to be responsible for the
increased gut permeability that has been observed
with fructose ingestion.88,89 Indeed, studies by
Bergheim’s group have shown that the increase
in gut permeability results in endotoxin entering
the portal vein, which is an important trigger for
fatty liver formation.90 Indeed, the administration
of antibiotics to reduce endotoxemia can improve
fatty liver.88,89 Endotoxemia has also been shown
to be elevated in children with NAFLD.91 Thus,
the microbiome may have a role in fructose-
induced fatty liver through an interaction with
fructose metabolism in the intestinal wall. Finally,
fructose has been found to alter the gut micro-
biome,
favouring
NAFLD
development,
which
along with increased gut permeability through
loss of tight junctions, leads to more progressive
disease.92–94
Role of the immune system
As noted, endotoxemia has been identified as a
mechanism by which fructose may exacerbate
NAFLD.88 Endotoxemia acts in part by activating
the innate immune system, and inflammation is
known to have a role in NAFLD, especially in the
transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis and cir-
rhosis.95 In this regard, a role for T cells and NK
cells (but not B lymphocytes) in fructose-induced
NAFLD has been shown experimentally, using
genetically modified mice that lack T cell or NK
cell function.96
Uric acid and its role in fructose-mediated
NAFLD
Fructose generates uric acid
As discussed earlier, fructose is the only common
carbohydrate that generates uric acid during its
metabolism (Fig. 2), with circulatory uric acid
levels rising within minutes of fructose ingestion,
and noted postprandially in individuals eating
fructose-rich meals.80,82,97 Fructose also increases
uric acid levels in the liver.17 Fructose also stimu-
lates the synthesis of uric acid from amino acid
precursors,75,76 and diets high in fructose are asso-

 ciated with increases in fasting serum uric acid
levels.98 Some, but not all epidemiological studies,
have
also
linked
high
fructose
intake
with
increases in fasting serum uric acid.99,100
Experimental studies
One striking finding was that fructose-induced
metabolic syndrome could be partially inhibited
by treatment with allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase
inhibitor that blocks uric acid generation.37 Subse-
quent studies showed that xanthine oxidase inhi-
bitors such as allopurinol or febuxostat could
reduce fatty liver caused by fructose,33 as well as
in a genetic model of NAFLD,101 diabetes-induced
fatty liver,102 high-fat diet associated NAFLD,103
and alcohol-induced fatty liver.104 This effect
appears to be mediated by reducing uric acid
levels and/or the effects of blocking xanthine
oxidase-induced
oxidative
stress.
Furthermore,
acutely raising uric acid levels by administering a
uricase inhibitor resulted in an acute increase in
liver triglycerides and hepatic expression of fatty
acid synthase (FAS),105 and incubation of liver cells
(HepG2 cells) with uric acid also resulted in an
increase in intracellular triglycerides.17,83
Additional studies identified potential mecha-
nisms by which a fructose-induced rise in uric acid
can stimulate hepatic lipogenesis. Firstly, fructose
was found to induce mitochondrial oxidative
stress that was mediated by uric acid-induced
activation of NADPH oxidase, which translocated
to mitochondria.17 Mitochondria contain a large
number of enzymes, but two in particular are
known
to
be
sensitive
to
oxidative
stress,
aconitase-2 (in the Kreb cycle) and enoyl CoA
hydratase
(involved
in
b-fatty
acid
oxida-
tion).106,107 Fructose and uric acid have been
shown to reduce aconitase-2 activity, leading to
an accumulation of citrate that moves into the
cytoplasm and activates lipogenesis by stimulat-
ing ATP citrate lyase.17 Choi et al.82 showed that
the initial oxidative stress in the mitochondria is
caused by NADPH oxidase, but later mitochondrial
oxidative stress is stimulated via the electron
transport chain, leading to endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, the activation of sterol regulatory ele-
ment binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1c),
and further stimulation of lipogenesis via activa-
tion of acetyl CoA carboxylase-1 and FAS.83 Others
have also shown fructose-induced induction of the
transcription factor, SREBP-1c,83,108–110 as well as
the carbohydrate responsive-element binding pro-
tein (ChREBP).33,111 The stimulation of ChREBP
results
in
the
stimulation
of
glucose-6-
phosphatase that may mediate some of the gluco-
neogenic effects of fructose.112
We also documented that fructose-induced
uric acid can impair fatty acid oxidation. While
mitochondrial oxidative stress may be partially
responsible for lowering enoyl CoA hydratase-1
activity, we also found that the activity of this
enzyme is regulated by AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) and AMP Deaminase-2 (AMPD).16
As mentioned, the rapid metabolism of fructose
leads to intracellular phosphate, GTP and ATP
depletion, with the stimulation of both AMPK
and AMPD activity. However, the stimulation of
AMPD tends to dominate, possibly by removing
AMP substrate, but also by generating uric acid
which feeds back to inhibit AMPK.16,113 The com-
bined effects of inhibition of AMPK, coupled with
AMPD overactivity, result in an inhibition of enoyl
A CoA hydratase and the accumulation of lipid,16
as well as the stimulation of gluconeogenesis.113
This process of reducing AMPK and stimulating
AMPD can also result in a reduction in hepatic
intracellular ATP levels. Baseline resting ATP levels
are low in diabetic individuals with NAFLD and fall
further following fructose challenge.77 Individuals
with NAFLD who have a higher serum uric acid
level show a greater fall in ATP levels following
the same fructose challenge.49 Thus, uric acid
may have a role not only in stimulating lipogene-
sis and gluconeogenesis, but also in blocking fatty
acid oxidation, leading to a relatively low hepatic
ATP state.
Thus, these studies show that the lipogenic
response to fructose is not a result of the metabo-
lism of the fructose molecule itself, but rather
from the general stimulation of lipogenesis and
blocking of fatty acid oxidation. Thus, studies
using labelled acetate document lipogenesis bet-
ter65 than those using labelled fructose.9,10
Soluble uric acid has also been shown to
have other proinflammatory effects that could play
a role in NAFLD, including the activation of the
transcription
factor
NF-jB,
stimulation
of
chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1, and the stimulation of NOD-like receptor
family
pyrin
domain

inflammasomes.114,115
Clinical studies
Epidemiological studies have also linked hyper-
uricemia with NAFLD in both adults11,116–122 and
children,117–119 in both cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal studies123,124 (Table 1). A liver biopsy
study also found that in individuals with NAFLD,
the higher the serum uric acid the greater the
NAFLD score, lobular inflammation and steatosis
grade.122 In addition, a meta-analysis found a
dose-dependent rise in the incidence of NAFLD
by 3% for every 1 mg/dl increase in serum uric
acid, even after accounting for metabolic syn-
drome and other lifestyle factors.125 Finally, a lar-
ger meta-analysis of 55,573 patients found an OR
of 1.92 (1.59–2.31) for NAFLD occurrence when
comparing the highest to lowest serum uric
acid.126 While most subjects with NAFLD are
obese, NAFLD can also occur in subjects with nor-
mal and low BMI, and elevated uric acid is com-
mon in these individuals.17,127
Hyperuricemia is also associated with NASH,
the intermediate stage and progressive form of

 NAFLD. In a study of adolescents, hyperuricemia
independently predicted the presence of NASH
(OR 2.5 [1.87–2.83]) after adjusting for age, sex
and other components of metabolic syndrome.51
Hyperuricemia in males has also been found to
associate more strongly with NASH than simple
steatosis and was significantly associated with
hepatocyte ballooning, BMI, and younger age in a
multivariate analysis.128
One small randomised controlled study evalu-
ated patients with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD
to determine whether allopurinol treatment (n =
17) was superior to placebo (n = 14). They reported
significant reductions in cytokeratin 18 (a marker

lower

and
aspartate

and improved total cholesterol and triglycerides

 fat diet, much more severe fatty liver occurs in
mice.132 One potential explanation is that, like
fructose,
high-fat
diets
induce
mitochondrial
oxidative stress.133 Nevertheless, mice lacking
fructokinase show marked protection from fatty
liver and insulin resistance, highlighting the key
role of fructose in western diet-induced NAFLD.132
Alcohol ingestion is well known to induce fatty
liver and chronic liver disease that can be histolog-
ically similar to NAFLD. Alcohol combined with
fructose was associated with worsening metabolic
features (hyperlipidaemia), although interestingly
they did not appear to have a synergistic effect
on inducing liver injury.134
As mentioned, high glycaemic diets can induce
endogenous fructose production.44 However, we
have found that high-salt diets can also induce
hepatic aldose reductase expression (because of
effects on osmolarity) leading to endogenous fruc-
tose production and NAFLD in mice, and mice
lacking fructokinase are protected (Lanaspa MA,
manuscript under review). High-salt diets are
independently associated with metabolic syn-
drome/diabetes135,136
and
NAFLD.137
Thus,
it
seems likely that both high glycaemic diets and/
or
high-salt
diets
might
exacerbate
fructose-
induced NAFLD.
In addition, genetic factors likely play a role in
fructose-induced NAFLD. For instance, in Hispanic
children who were homozygous for the patatin-
like phospholipase domain containing protein 3
(PNPLA3) gene variant rs738409 a positive correla-
tion was found between liver fat content and car-
bohydrate (r = 0.38, p = 0.02) and total sugar (r =
0.33, p = 0.04) intake.138 A similar correlation
between liver fat content and sugar-sweetened
beverage intake was made in Italian adolescents
with the same variant.139 Notably, in 18 adult
patients with NAFLD (matched for liver fat con-
tent), a six-day low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet
revealed reductions in liver fat content, but was
2.5-fold greater in those who were PNPLA3 GG
homozygotes (n = 8) vs. CC homozygotes (n =
10).140 Less is known about interactions with
other genes such as transmembrane 6 superfamily
member 2 (TM6SF2) which regulates very low-
density lipoprotein secretion and glucokinase reg-
ulatory gene (GCKR) that regulates the glycolytic
pathway. Overall, further investigations are war-
ranted in this area, but initial data suggest a role
for genetic polymorphisms interacting with fruc-
tose in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.
Protective factors for fructose-induced NAFLD
Omega 3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish
oils and in Mediterranean diets, may also protect
against NAFLD.141 For example, mice on a western
diet (high-fat, high-fructose) were partially pro-
tected from developing NAFLD if their diet was
supplemented with combined omega-3 fatty acids
and flavanols.142 Likewise, fish oil treatment was
found to improve hypertriglyceridemia and insu-
lin resistance in fructose-fed macaques, although
liver fat was not assessed in that study.143 A
short-term fructose feeding study in humans also
suggested fish oil might blunt the development
of hypertriglyceridemia and de novo lipogenesis.64
Further studies investigating this pathway are
needed.
Likewise, there is evidence that many sub-
stances found in natural fruits, such as flavanols,
epicatechin, vitamin C and other antioxidants
may also protect against fructose-induced meta-
bolic syndrome.58,144,145 This may explain why
intake of natural fruits is not associated with
NAFLD. Fruit juices, which are associated with
metabolic syndrome, contain higher amounts of
fructose and are often ingested rapidly, leading
to
higher
fructose
concentrations
that
cause
greater ATP consumption and depletion.
Other amplifying mechanisms
High sugar exposure may enhance the metabolic
effects of fructose
Repeated exposure to sugar is known to upregu-
late the transport of fructose through the GLUT5
transporter41,146 and also increase fructokinase
levels in the liver.41 Uptake of fructose is also
enhanced by glucose.147 Interestingly, this may
increase the risk of fatty liver. A study by Sullivan
et al. investigated the absorption of fructose in
lean children, obese children, and obese children
with biopsy proven NAFLD. While fructose malab-
sorption was common in lean children, it was less
in
obese
children
and
children
with
NAFLD
absorbed almost all of the oral fructose chal-
lenge.119 In addition, blood fructose levels were
lower in the obese children with NAFLD, suggest-
ing they also metabolised the fructose more
rapidly. Furthermore, Jin et al. reported that chil-
dren with NAFLD experience a greater rise in
serum triglycerides in response to fructose than
lean controls.148
Uric acid as an amplification mechanism
Elevated serum uric acid levels may also function
to amplify the effects of fructose by creating a pos-
itive feedback system. For example, uric acid may
feedback to increase endogenous fructose produc-
tion by stimulating AR149,150 and may also stimu-
late fructose metabolism by increasing expression
and activity of fructokinase.33 In contrast, high
concentrations of uric acid can block xanthine oxi-
dase.151,152 Thus, high concentrations of uric acid
may act to stimulate the upstream metabolism
of fructose, which will further promote purine
metabolism end-products, including uric acid.
Limitations
While the evidence for fructose as a risk factor for
NAFLD seems strong, large clinical trials are still
JOURNAL

1069
 lacking. Nevertheless, there are some groups that
have argued that fructose intake may not increase
the risk of NAFLD, especially in short-term (four
weeks or less) trials that compare fructose to iso-
caloric diets,153 as well as in studies of fructose-
associated hypercaloric diets.154 However, the
development of fatty liver with fructose takes
months in animals85,132 and most of the trials
were probably too short to note this effect. Some
of these trials are listed (Table 2), with the longest
performed by Stanhope et al. and Maersk et al. at
ten weeks and six months, respectively, showing
differences in either visceral fat, or liver and vis-
ceral fat were higher in patients receiving a fruc-
tose
diet
than
a
glucose
or
other
isocaloric
beverage, despite similar changes in weight. Other
studies noted are shorter, although the majority of
them support fructose worsening lipid profiles or
insulin sensitivity compared to glucose, providing
likely mechanisms for the development of NAFLD.
Of note, studies funded by the food industry, and/
or in which the authors are funded by the food
industry, often fail to show a relationship between
sugar intake and metabolic disease.155,156
Experimentally, the data that uric acid may have
a role in NAFLD is countered by a report in which
exogenously administered uric acid reversed hep-
atic steatosis since it can function as an antioxi-
dant.157
However,
there
may
be
differences
between exogenous uric acid and intracellular uric
acid in terms of its effects on oxidative stress.17,158
Finally, there is still much to learn about fructose
metabolism that is not well understood. For exam-
ple, fructose is now known to stimulate FGF21,
which may counter some of the negative effects of
fructose on craving, metabolic syndrome and liver
disease.159,160 Identifying how this factor modu-
lates fructose responses is clearly of major interest.

 Conclusions
In summary, there has been a marked rise in sugar
and HFCS intake that has paralleled the rise of
NAFLD. Experimentally, the fructose component
of sugar and HFCS appears to have a major role
in inducing fatty liver by both stimulating de novo
lipogenesis and blocking b-fatty acid oxidation.
Evidence suggests these effects are caused by the
unique metabolism of fructose by fructokinase
that leads to a fall in ATP with nucleotide turnover
and uric acid generation. The prooxidative and
proinflammatory
effects
of
uric
acid
lead
to
increases in gut permeability and endotoxemia
that exacerbate the lipogenic process in the liver,
which coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction,
result in NAFLD. Clinically the intake of sugar-
sweetened
beverages
is
strongly
linked
with
NAFLD. Reducing sugar or HFCS intake may have
major benefits for patients with NAFLD. Clinical
studies to investigate the potential benefit of low-
ering uric acid should also be performed. While
there are many causes of NAFLD, the intake of
fructose-containing sugars is likely to play a major
role.
