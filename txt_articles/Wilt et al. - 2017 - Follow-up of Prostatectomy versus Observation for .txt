BACKGROUND
We previously found no significant differences in mortality between men who under-
went surgery for localized prostate cancer and those who were treated with observation 
only. Uncertainty persists regarding nonfatal health outcomes and long-term mortality.
METHODS
From November 1994 through January 2002, we randomly assigned 731 men with local-
ized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy or observation. We extended follow-up 
through August 2014 for our primary outcome, all-cause mortality, and the main sec-
ondary outcome, prostate-cancer mortality. We describe disease progression, treatments 
received, and patient-reported outcomes through January 2010 (original follow-up).
RESULTS
During 19.5 years of follow-up (median, 12.7 years), death occurred in 223 of 364 men 
(61.3%) assigned to surgery and in 245 of 367 (66.8%) assigned to observation (absolute 
difference in risk, 5.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.5 to 12.4; 
hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.06). Death attributed to prostate cancer or 
treatment occurred in 27 men (7.4%) assigned to surgery and in 42 men (11.4%) as-
signed to observation (absolute difference in risk, 4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.2 
to 8.3; hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.02; P 
= 
0.06). Surgery may have been associ-
ated with lower all-cause mortality than observation among men with intermediate-risk 
disease (absolute difference, 14.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 25.6) but not among 
those with low-risk disease (absolute difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.5 to 
11.8) or high-risk disease (absolute difference, 2.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −11.5 to 
16.1) (P 
= 
0.08 for interaction). Treatment for disease progression was less frequent with 
surgery than with observation (absolute difference, 26.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 19.0 
to 32.9); treatment was primarily for asymptomatic, local, or biochemical (prostate-
specific antigen) progression. Urinary incontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction 
were each greater with surgery than with observation through 10 years. Disease-related 
or treatment-related limitations in activities of daily living were greater with surgery 
than with observation through 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS
After nearly 20 years of follow-up among men with localized prostate cancer, surgery 
was not associated with significantly lower all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality than 
observation. Surgery was associated with a higher frequency of adverse events than 
observation but a lower frequency of treatment for disease progression, mostly for 
asymptomatic, local, or biochemical progression. (Funded by the Department of Veter-
ans Affairs and others; PIVOT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00007644.)

Prostatectomy vs. Observation for Prostate Cancer
W
e previously reported that rad-
ical prostatectomy was not associated 
with significantly lower all-cause or 
prostate-cancer mortality than observation with 
noncurative palliative interventions through 12 
years among men with localized prostate cancer 
detected during the early era of prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) testing.1 In light of the protracted 
disease course and extended survival of many 
patients, treatment decisions often require infor-
mation about additional treatments received, 
patient-reported outcomes, and very-long-term 
mortality. Three other randomized trials com-
pared radical prostatectomy with observation or 
PSA-based active monitoring. One older trial 
showed no significant difference in overall mor-
tality.2 Another trial, also conducted before the 
widespread use of PSA screening, showed differ-
ences favoring surgery in all-cause and prostate-
cancer mortality of 12.7 and 11.0 percentage 
points, respectively, with similar differences in 
the risk of distant metastases at a median follow-
up of 13.4 years.3 The most recent trial, involving 
men with disease detected by PSA screening, 
showed no significant difference in all-cause or 
prostate-cancer mortality after a median of 10 
years of follow-up among radiation therapy, sur-
gery, and PSA-based active monitoring and de-
layed radical intervention.4 We report all-cause 
and prostate-cancer mortality through nearly 20 
years of follow-up and describe disease progres-
sion, treatments received, and patient-reported 
outcomes during the original follow-up.
Methods
Trial Design
We previously described the design, methods, and 
baseline results of the Prostate Cancer Interven-
tion versus Observation Trial (PIVOT).1,5 The trial 
was approved by the institutional review board 
at each site. Patients provided written informed 
consent. After completion of follow-up through 
January 2010, we amended the protocol to assess 
extended all-cause and prostate-cancer mortality. 
The original and revised protocols, including the 
statistical analysis plan, are available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Patients
From November 1994 through January 2002, we 
randomly assigned 731 men with localized pros-
tate cancer (mean age, 67 years; median PSA 
value, 7.8 ng per milliliter) to radical prostatec-
tomy or observation at Department of Veterans 
Affairs and National Cancer Institute medical 
centers.1,5 Patients had to be medically fit for 
radical prostatectomy and have histologically 
confirmed, clinically localized prostate cancer 
(stage T1-T2NxM0 in the tumor–node–metasta-
sis classification system according to the Ameri-
can Joint Committee on Cancer6) of any grade 
diagnosed within the previous 12 months. Pa-
tients had to have a PSA value of less than 50 ng 
per milliliter, an age of 75 years or younger, 
negative results on a bone scan for metastatic 
disease, and a life expectancy of at least 10 years. 
Trial sites assessed eligibility on the basis of lo-
cal PSA values and biopsy readings. One of the 
authors, who is a pathologist, reviewed and re-
classified biopsy specimens at a central location. 
The pathologist was unaware of the long-term 
fate of the patient and of the original Gleason 
score assessment at the local center.
Follow-up and Clinical Outcomes
We assessed all-cause and prostate-cancer mor-
tality through August 2014, for a minimum of 
12 years and a maximum of 19.5 years or until 
the patient died. Logistic and analytic difficul-
ties, including difficulty in obtaining informa-
tion about and adjudicating the cause of death, 
delayed the reporting of findings. An end-points 
committee whose members were unaware of the 
trial-group assignments determined the cause of 
death on the basis of information extracted from 
the patients’ medical records.1,7 Data on disease 
progression, treatment received, and patient-
reported health outcomes were based on follow-
up through January 2010. After January 2010, 
data on treatment and follow-up were not system-
atically collected. We classified progression as 
local, regional, systemic, or biochemical (PSA) 
and as symptomatic or asymptomatic (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). We defined treatments as “definitive 
intervention” (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), any surgery (including radical prostatectomy), 
radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemother-
apy, or immunotherapy, and we report treat-
ments according to type of disease progression.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Our 
secondary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality, 
which was defined as death that was definitely

or probably due to prostate cancer or definitely or 
probably due to treatment for prostate cancer. 
End points through January 2010 included the 
following: local, regional, systemic, and bio-
chemical (PSA) progression; additional treat-
ments; adverse events requiring treatment; and 
patient-reported outcomes of urinary inconti-
nence, erectile and sexual dysfunction, worry 
about health, “bother” due to prostate cancer or 
treatment, physical discomfort, satisfaction with 
sexual functioning, and functional limitations 
due to prostate cancer or treatment.
Analyses were performed according to the 
intention-to-treat principle with the use of Kaplan–
Meier methods and corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals. We used the Fine and Gray 
method to compare groups with respect to 
prostate-cancer mortality in the presence of com-
peting risks, because the Kaplan–Meier method 
for unadjusted survival analysis yields unreliable 
results for survival estimates in the presence of 
competing risks.8-10 We assessed the cumulative 
incidence of death, between-group differences, 
and relative risks at 4, 8, 12, and 16 years and at 
the end of follow-up. P values of less than 0.05 
were considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance, with no adjustment for multiple compari-
sons. We prespecified seven subgroups accord-
ing to baseline characteristics, as described 
previously1: age, race, coexisting conditions,11 self-
reported performance status, PSA level, Gleason 
score,12 and D’Amico tumor risk score.13 We also 
assessed mortality outcomes on the basis of 
central histopathological reclassification. Patient-
reported outcomes were analyzed at baseline, 
6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years 
with the use of Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
outcomes or a t-test for continuous measures. 
We used SAS software, versions 9.3 and 9.4 (SAS 
Institute), for the analyses.14
Results
All-Cause and Prostate-Cancer Mortality
As of August 2014, a total of 468 of 731 men 
(64.0%) had died. The vital status of all the par-
ticipants was available, although we were unable 
to ascertain the cause of death in 7 men (2 as-
signed to surgery and 5 to observation). The 
median follow-up from randomization to death 
or the end of follow-up was 12.7 years (inter-
quartile range, 7.3 to 15.5). All-cause mortality 
was not significantly lower with surgery than 
with observation (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.06) (Fig. 1A). 
The 19.5-year cumulative incidence of death was 
61.3% among men assigned to radical prostatec-
tomy and 66.8% among those assigned to obser-
vation (relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.02) 
(Table 1). Absolute differences in risk, although 
not significant, increased from 3.1 percentage 
points at 8 years to 5.5 percentage points at the 
end of follow-up (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The median survival was 13.0 years 
(95% CI, 12.5 to 13.5) with surgery and 12.4 years 
(95% CI, 11.4 to 12.8) with observation.
Death attributed to prostate cancer or treat-
ment occurred in 69 men (9.4%); 65 deaths were 
attributed to prostate cancer and 4 to treatment. 
Prostate-cancer mortality was not significantly

lower with radical prostatectomy than with ob-
servation (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.02; 
P 
= 
0.06) (Fig. 1B). The cumulative incidence of 
death due to prostate cancer or treatment was 
7.4% with surgery and 11.4% with observation 
(absolute difference, 4.0 percentage points; 95% 
CI, −0.2 to 8.3) (Table 2). Relative and absolute 
differences in risk remained stable after 12 years 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Death that was considered to be definitely due to 
prostate cancer or treatment occurred in 18 men 
(4.9%) assigned to surgery and 22 men (6.0%) 
assigned to observation.
Subgroup Analyses
The effect of surgery on mortality did not differ 
significantly according to baseline patient char-
acteristics (Fig. 2A and 2B and Tables 1 and 2, 
and Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Among men younger than 65 years of 
age, the absolute difference in all-cause mortal-
ity between the surgery group and the observa-
tion group increased from −1.5 percentage points 
(95% CI, −11.7 to 8.5) at 8 years to 12.0 percent-
age points (95% CI, −0.3 to 23.8) at the end of 
follow-up. Among men 65 years of age or older, 
the absolute difference at the end of follow-up 
was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −5.7 to 10.8).
The effect of surgery on all-cause mortality 
may have differed according to baseline PSA 
value (P 
= 
0.06 for interaction) and tumor risk 
category (P 
= 
0.08 for interaction) (Fig. 2A and 
Table 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Surgery was not associated with lower

There were no significant between-group differences in all-cause mortality (Panel A) or prostate-cancer mortality 
(Panel B) according to prespecified subgroups. However, the effect of surgery on all-cause mortality may have dif-
fered according to baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (P = 0.06 for interaction) and tumor risk (D’Amico 
tumor risk score [low, intermediate, or high], which was based on tumor stage, histologic score, and PSA level; P = 0.08 
for interaction). Scores on the Charlson comorbidity index range from 0 to 33, with higher scores indicating greater 
disease burden. Scores for self-reported performance status range from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating fully active and higher 
scores indicating poorer functional status. Scores on the Gleason histologic scale range from 2 to 10, with 10 indi-
cating the most poorly differentiated tumors. The bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

Exploratory analyses in men with T1c (nonpal-
pable, PSA-detected) tumors, including those with 
a PSA value of more than 10 ng per milliliter or a 
Gleason score of 7 or more (on a scale from 2 to 
10, with 10 indicating the most poorly differen-
tiated tumors), showed nonsignificant differ-
ences in all-cause and prostate-cancer mortality 
between the surgery group and the observation 
group (Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Few deaths from prostate cancer or 
treatment occurred among men with T1c tumors, 
and confidence intervals were wide (Tables S3 
and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Disease Progression and Additional 
Treatments
Fewer men assigned to surgery had disease pro-
gression or received additional treatment than 
men assigned to observation (Table 3, and Figs. 
S2 through S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Any progression occurred in 40.9% of the men 
assigned to surgery versus 68.4% of the men as-
signed to observation. Most disease progression 
was local, and approximately half the cases of 
local progression were asymptomatic. Definitive 
treatment occurred in 20.4% of the men assigned 
to observation, rarely after 5 years of follow-up,

Prostatectomy vs. Observation for Prostate Cancer
and in 85.5% of the men assigned to surgery, 
almost all occurring within 1 year (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Treatment for cancer 
progression, mostly for asymptomatic, local, or 
PSA progression, occurred in 33.5% of the men 
assigned to surgery and in 59.7% of the men as-
signed to observation (Table 3, and Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Androgen-deprivation 
therapy was less frequent among men assigned 
to surgery than among those assigned to obser-
vation (21.7% vs. 44.4%). The absolute difference 
in the risk of systemic progression or treatment 
for systemic progression was approximately 4 per-
centage points, in favor of surgery.
The frequency of treatment for local progres-
sion was lower with surgery than with observa-
tion in all tumor risk groups. Among men with 
low-risk disease, treatment for regional or sys-
temic disease was infrequent and did not differ 
significantly between the surgery group and the 
observation group. Among men with intermedi-
ate-risk disease, the frequency of treatment for 
systemic progression was lower with surgery than 
with observation (5.4% vs. 11.7%). Among men 
with high-risk disease, the frequency of treat-
ment for an increasing or persistently elevated 
PSA value was lower with surgery than with 
observation (33.8% vs. 52.5%), but there was no 
significant difference with respect to treatment 
for regional or systemic progression. (Details re-
garding treatment according to progression type 
and tumor risk category are provided in Fig. S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix.) Physician-pre-
scribed treatment for erectile dysfunction and 
urinary incontinence due to prostate-cancer pro-
gression or treatment was more common with 
surgery than with observation (Table 3).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Patient-reported overall health, physical or men-
tal health assessed with the use of the Medical 
Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form General 
Health Survey (SF-12), and worry about health 
did not differ significantly between the groups. 
As compared with men assigned to observation, 
men assigned to surgery were more likely to re-
port bother due to prostate cancer or treatment, 
physical discomfort, and limitations in activities 
of daily living through 2 years but not at later 
time points. The use of absorbent pads because 
of incontinence was greater through 10 years in 
men treated with surgery than in those assigned 
to observation; absolute differences exceeded 30 
percentage points at all time points. Erectile dys-
function as well as decreases in sexual function, 
activity, interest, and satisfaction were much 
greater through 5 years in men assigned to sur-
gery than in those assigned to observation. De-
tails on patient-related outcomes are provided in 
Figures S5 through S9 and Tables S5 through S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
After nearly 20 years, the absolute difference in 
all-cause mortality between men assigned to sur-
gery and those assigned to observation was less 
than 6 percentage points, and the absolute dif-
ference in prostate-cancer mortality was 4 per-
centage points. The extended follow-up yielded 
slightly greater differences in mortality favoring 
surgery than those described earlier, although 
the differences remained nonsignificant.1,14-16 The 
frequencies of disease progression and treatment 
for disease progression were lower with surgery 
than with observation, although most events of 
progression were asymptomatic, local, or bio-
chemical. There were large, long-term differ-
ences in urinary incontinence and erectile and 
sexual dysfunction in favor of observation and 
smaller, shorter-term differences in adverse ef-
fects with respect to physical function and activi-
ties of daily living.
Although relative differences in prostate-cancer 
mortality between the trial groups appeared to 
be larger, absolute differences were small, both 
relative and absolute differences were nonsignifi-
cant, and statistical measures were not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons; such an adjustment 
would have further reduced the levels of signifi-
cance of the differences.17 We encourage readers 
to focus on absolute differences in risk and cor-
responding confidence intervals.14-16 The differ-
ence was 1 percentage point when the end point 
was death that was considered to be definitely 
due to prostate cancer or treatment. Using all-
cause mortality as our primary end point avoid-
ed pitfalls in cause-of-death ascertainment.7,18
We urge caution in interpreting subgroup ef-
fects.19 Our trial was not powered to detect small 
differences between subgroups, but significant 
results may be due to multiple analyses.17 If dif-
ferences in all-cause mortality exist, they were 
confined to men with intermediate-risk disease

and depend on histopathological classification 
methods. For men with low-risk or high-risk 
disease, differences in all-cause mortality were 
3 percentage points or less and were not signifi-
cant. Surgical effects on mortality did not vary 
according to patient factors.
Most treatment for disease progression was 
for local, asymptomatic reasons, especially in-
creasing or persistently elevated PSA values. 
Among men assigned to surgery, 41% had dis-
ease progression and 34% received treatment for 
disease progression. There were few differences 
in quality of life and worry about health between 
the surgery group and the observation group. 
Long-term erectile and sexual dysfunction and 
urinary incontinence and physician-directed treat-
ment were substantially greater with surgery than 
with observation. Functional limitations and 
bother due to prostate cancer or treatment were 
greater with surgery than with observation 
through at least 2 years, whereas worry about 
health was less at 10 years.
Our findings are generally consistent with 
those of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 
Study Number 4 (SPCG-4)3,20 and the Prostate 
Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial.4,21 
SPCG-4, like PIVOT, compared surgery with ob-
servation, whereas the ProtecT trial compared 
surgery or radiation with active monitoring and 
delayed radical intervention based primarily on 
PSA results without surveillance biopsies. Data 
from randomized trials are lacking to assess 
biopsy-based active surveillance, the predominant 
active-monitoring practice in the United States. 
PIVOT involved men who received a diagnosis of 
prostate cancer, and who used treatments avail-
able, in the United States during the early era of 
PSA testing,1,5 a midpoint between the era before 
PSA testing (SPCG-4) and the later era of PSA 
testing (the ProtecT trial). Mortality differences 
across these studies may reflect differences in 
patient age and coexisting conditions but more 
likely reflect differences in the natural history of 
prostate cancer that are related to detection 
methods and possibly treatment approaches, 
including improvements in medical treatment 
for progressive disease. Only 9.4% of PIVOT 
participants died from prostate cancer. The ab-
solute difference in all-cause mortality between 
the trial groups was 5.5 percentage points in 
favor of surgery, and the absolute difference in 
prostate-cancer mortality was 4.0 percentage 
points. In the ProtecT trial, mortality and the 
incidence of metastatic disease (which included 
asymptomatic disease detected by surveillance 
imaging and biochemical [PSA] testing) as well 
as absolute differences between the trial groups 
in favor of radical intervention (1 percentage 
point for mortality and 4 percentage points for 
metastatic-disease incidence) were much lower 
through 10 years than in SPCG-4 or PIVOT.
Our results, together with those of SPCG-4, 
the ProtecT trial, and two earlier trials that 
showed no mortality benefits of surgery2 or radia-
tion22 as compared with observation, have clini-
cal implications. First, they show that long-term 
prostate-cancer mortality remains low among 
most men with localized prostate cancer who 
are treated with observation and that death from 
prostate cancer is very uncommon among men 
with low-risk and low-PSA disease. Reducing over-
treatment is needed. Men with low-risk and PSA-
based screening–detected disease can safely avoid 
harms and costs of early radical intervention or 
of biopsy-guided active surveillance with delayed 
radical treatment.4,21,23 Observation, PSA-based 
monitoring, and active surveillance with delayed 
radical intervention remain infrequently used, 
even among older men,24-26 despite a frequency of 
metastatic progression of less than 3%,27 prostate-
cancer mortality of 1% or less,28-31 and cost-effec-
tiveness that is superior to that with early radical 
intervention.23,32 PSA-based monitoring and biopsy-
based active-surveillance programs should reduce 
the frequency of surveillance biopsy and increase 
biopsy and PSA thresholds that trigger radical 
interventions.
Second, surgery may have mortality benefits in 
some men, particularly those with intermediate-
risk prostate cancer who have long life expectan-
cies. However, the comparative effects of active 
surveillance and PSA-based monitoring in many 
men with intermediate-risk disease should be 
examined. In addition, the risk of progression or 
death as well as the absolute treatment benefit 
diminish while overtreatment harms increase in 
men with smaller-volume, screening-detected 
lower-risk cancers. Beneficial effects depend on 
proper histopathological grading, which is fraught 
with interobserver and intraobserver variation. 
Revisions in Gleason grading and risk-score clas-
sification systems have resulted in an upgrading 
of prostate cancers that are classified today, as 
compared with those in men enrolled in PIVOT.

Prostatectomy vs. Observation for Prostate Cancer
This has led to more men being classified with 
intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, resulting 
in fewer men being considered eligible for ob-
servation or active monitoring.33-36
Third, although men with high-risk disease 
have a poor prognosis, surgery may not provide 
large benefits with respect to mortality. Safer 
and more effective options are needed. Fourth, 
surgery is associated with a decreased risk of 
disease progression and treatment for disease 
progression. However, most progression is asymp-
tomatic, local, or biochemical, for which the 
treatment benefit is uncertain. Among men with 
low-risk disease in our trial, the frequency of 
treatment for regional or systemic progression 
was not significantly lower with surgery than 
with observation. Reducing treatment for asymp-
tomatic progression would decrease harms and 
costs, with little, if any, effect on mortality. 
Fifth, surgery causes perioperative and longer-
term adverse effects, some requiring treatment. 
Nonetheless, regardless of the initial treatment, 
we found few differences between the trial 
groups in long-term bother, physical discomfort, 
worry about health, overall health, or limitations 
in activities due to prostate cancer or treatment. 
Differences in satisfaction with sexual function-
ing remained significant through 5 years.
In conclusion, radical prostatectomy was not 
associated with significantly lower all-cause or 
prostate-cancer mortality than observation through 
20 years of follow-up among men with localized 
prostate cancer that was diagnosed during the 
early era of PSA testing. Absolute differences re-
mained below 6 percentage points. Death from 
prostate cancer was very uncommon among 
men with low-risk disease who were assigned to 
observation. Surgery may be associated with de-
creased mortality among men with intermediate-
risk prostate cancer, depending on the pathologi-
cal classification. Surgery resulted in substantially 
greater long-term urinary incontinence and erec-
tile and sexual dysfunction than observation and 
was associated with a significantly lower risk of 
disease progression and additional treatments, 
most for local or asymptomatic biochemical 
progression.
