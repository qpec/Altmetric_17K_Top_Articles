Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Long work hours have recently been linked with dia-
betes, but more high-quality prospective studies are 
needed.
What are the new findings?
 
► Evaluation of the relationship between long work 
hours and the incidence of diabetes among 7065 
workers over a 12-year period in Ontario, Canada, 
showed increased risk of diabetes among women 
working 45 hours or more per week, but not among 
men.
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
 
► Promoting the regular workweek of 35–40 hours 
might be an effective strategy for preventing diabe-
tes among women.

Objective According to the International 
Diabetes Federation, the most important challenge for 
prevention is now to identify social and environmental 
modifiable risk factors of diabetes. In this regard, long 
work hours have recently been linked with diabetes, but 
more high-quality prospective studies are needed. We 
evaluated the relationship between long work hours and 
the incidence of diabetes among 7065 workers over a 12-
year period in Ontario, Canada.
Research design and methods Data from Ontario 
respondents (35–74 years of age) to the 2003 Canadian 
Community Health Survey were prospectively linked to 
the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database for physician 
services and the Canadian Institute for Health Information 
Discharge Abstract Database for hospital admissions. 
Our sample consisted of actively employed participants 
with no previous diagnoses of diabetes. Cox proportional 
hazard regression models were then performed to evaluate 
the relationship between long work hours (≥45 hours per 
week) and the incidence of diabetes.
Results Long work hours did not increase the risk 
of developing diabetes among men. However, among 
women, those usually working 45 hours or more per week 
had a significantly higher risk of diabetes than women 
working between 35 and 40 hours per week (HR: 1.63 
(95% CI 1.04 to 2.57)). The effect was slightly attenuated 
when adjusted for the potentially mediating factors 
which are smoking, leisure time physical activity, alcohol 
consumption and body mass index.
Conclusion Working 45 hours or more per week was 
associated with an increased incidence of diabetes among 
women, but not men. Identifying modifiable risk factors 
such as long work hours is of major importance to improve 
prevention strategies and orient policy making.
Diabetes is one of the primary causes of death 
worldwide, in addition to being a major risk 
factor for several other chronic diseases 
including cardiovascular diseases.1 By 2030, 
an estimated 439 million adults will live with 
diabetes globally (7.7%),2 which will repre-
sent a 50% increase compared with 2010.2 
The global costs of this chronic disease are 
colossal, accounting for US$1.31 trillion 
only for the year 2015.3 According to the 
International Diabetes Federation, the most 
important challenge for prevention is now to 
identify social and environmental modifiable 
risk factors of diabetes.4 In this regard, long 
work hours have recently been linked with an 
increased incidence of diabetes among low 
(but not high) socioeconomic status individ-
uals in a meta-analysis by Kivimäki et al.5 This 
estimate however relied exclusively on unpub-
lished data where the methodological quality 
was not presented.6 7 Moreover, the meta-esti-
mate based on results from the only four previ-
ously published studies led to a null finding, as 
mixed findings were observed in these studies 
despite their large sample sizes.8–11 More high-
quality prospective studies are needed.
The need to further investigate the effect 
of long working hours on diabetes incidence 
is further enhanced by the fact that three out 
of the four previous studies included only 
men8 10 or only women.9 It is increasingly 
recognized that single-sex studies in most 
areas of health are limited in their general-
izability and quality, as they fail to take into 
account of how potential biological and

social differences between men and women may influ-
ence the relationships between exposures and health 
outcomes.12 Specifically related to the area of long work 
hours and diabetes, it is plausible that the relationship 
may be stronger among women than men. Considering 
both paid and unpaid work, employed women are facing 
stiffer time constraints than men.13 Also, while men 
working long hours often hold high-skilled and well-paid 
occupations,14 women working such hours predominate 
in low-paid jobs.14 Working long work hours might lead 
to diabetes through a chronic stress response mecha-
nism involving an acceleration of the hypothalamic-pi-
tuitary-adrenal activity boosting glucocorticoids and 
cortisol levels,15 16 and increasing the risk of endocrine 
abnormalities, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, 
and obesity.17
The current study evaluated the relationship between 
long work hours and the incidence of diabetes among 
7065 men and women over a 12-year period in Ontario, 
Canada.

data source and study population
The data source for this study was the 2003 Canadian 
Community Health Survey (CCHS). Respondents’ 
responses were linked to the Ontario Health Insurance 
Plan (OHIP) database covering physician services, as 
well as the Canadian Institute for Health Information 
Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD) for hospital 
admissions. These data sets were encoded and linked at 
the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Information 
from the OHIP and CIHI-DAD databases was available 
up to March 31, 2015. The administrative databases were 
linked to the survey responses at the individual level, with 
the accuracy of the linkage verified against the Ontario 
Registered Persons Database using personal information 
provided by the respondents, such as health number, 
given names, surnames, date of birth, age, sex, and postal 
code.
The CCHS collects information on health conditions, 
health behaviors, and working conditions from repre-
sentative cross-sectional samples of the Canadian popu-
lation. The overall response rate from the respondents 
from Ontario to the 2003 CCHS was 78.5%.18 Of the 
40 507 Ontario respondents to the 2003 survey, 34 950 
(86%) gave permission to be linked to administrative 
healthcare data. A successful linkage was obtained for 
33 679 of these respondents (96%). For the purpose of 
this study, we focused on respondents who were currently 
employed, working 15 or more hours per week, and aged 
between 35 and 74 years (n=8895).
Outcome: incident diabetes
Incident diabetes was defined as one hospital admission 
with a diabetes diagnosis, or two physician service claims 
with a diabetes diagnosis within a 2-year period. Excel-
lent sensitivity and specificity have been reported for 
this algorithm, 86% and 97%, respectively.19 Although 
the administrative data available in the OHIP database 
cannot distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, this 
restriction is unlikely to impact on our results given the 
high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, in particular among 
older cohorts, and the fact that the incidence of type 1 
diabetes is very rare among adults.20
Since diabetes is known to affect work participation,21 
cases occurring within the first 2 years of follow-up were 
removed to limit the possibility of reverse causation. This 
choice also resulted from the fact that our definition of 
diabetes required a 2-year period for physician claims. 
Respondents who did not develop diabetes within the 
first 2 years of follow-up were right-censored at the devel-
opment of the disease, death from causes other than 
diabetes, or the end of the follow-up period (March 31, 
2015).
Primary independent variable: work hours
The primary independent variable was self-reported 
usual work hours in the respondent’s job per week and 
included both paid and unpaid hours. Work hours were 
grouped into the following categories: 15–34 hours, 35–40 
hours, 41–44 hours, and 45 or more hours per week. This 
categorization was performed to evaluate the potential 
adverse effects of working beyond the legal threshold of 
overtime (41 hours or more per week) of many countries 
including Canada, USA, China, and Greece.22
Other independent variables
Several other independent variables were also included 
in the analysis as covariates. Sociodemographic and 
health-related covariates measured were age; sex (men/
women); marital status (with/without a spouse) and pres-
ence of children under 12 in the house (yes/no); if the 
respondent was born in Canada; their ethnicity (white/
other); living location (urban/rural); and self-reported 
chronic medical conditions that have been diagnosed 
by a health professional and are expected to last or have 
lasted more than 6 months. Chronic medical conditions 
were divided into cardiovascular diseases, high blood 
pressure, back problems, mood and anxiety disorders, 
and other chronic conditions. A measure of whether a 
long-term physical or mental health condition limited 
the type or amount of activity the respondent could do 
at work (never, sometimes and often) was also included.
Other working conditions were also measured and 
were based on self-report and on occupational expo-
sures imputed based on respondents’ occupational 
title. Self-reported exposures included the number of 
weeks worked in the previous 12 months (1–26 weeks 
worked, 27–49 weeks, and 50 or more weeks), current 
shift schedule (regular, evening or night shift, rotating, 
or other shift schedules), and skills required to do the 
job (skills learned at the university, college, high school 
or learned on the job). Imputed occupational expo-
sures based on occupational title included the primary 
type of posture or body movement required (primarily

sitting; occupations involving primarily standing and/or 
walking; occupations involving combinations of sitting, 
standing, and walking; and work that involves other body 
postures) and the handling of loads 10 kg or greater 
(binary). Imputed exposures were assigned based on 
the validated Human Resources and Skills Development 
Canada’s Career Handbook.23 The Career Handbook 
assigns various occupational exposures to occupations 
at the four-digit occupational level, equating to 520 
different occupational titles. Each of these exposures was 
assigned by trained occupational analysts using a modi-
fied Delphi procedure.23
Body mass index (BMI) and health behaviors were also 
accounted for. BMI was based on self-reported height 
and weight (underweight/normal weight, overweight, 
obese). Health behaviors available were current smoking 
status (regular smoker, occasional smoker, non-smoker), 
alcohol consumption (non-drinker, regular drinker but 
never having five or more drinks in one sitting, regular 
drinker who has five or more drinks on an occasional to 
weekly status), and leisure time physical activity (inactive, 
moderately active, active).
analyses
Of the original sample of 8895 respondents, 546 respon-
dents (6%) had pre-existing diabetes, identified either 
through self-report or through their healthcare record, 
leaving a sample of diabetes-free respondents of 8349. 
Of this sample 566 (7%) were missing information on 
working conditions, with an additional 610 (7%) missing 
information on sociodemographic characteristics, health 
conditions or health behaviors, leaving a sample of 7173 
(86% of original sample). From this sample we excluded 
respondents who developed diabetes in the first 2 years 
of follow-up (n=108), leaving a final analytic sample of 
7065 respondents (figure 1). Logistic regression anal-
yses examined the relationship between age, sex and our 
outcome with the probability of missing information on 
working conditions. Male respondents were more likely 
to be missing work information, but no relationship was 
observed between missing work information and age, or 
the development of diabetes over the study period. A subse-
quent logistic regression model examined the probability 
of missing other study variables. This model included age, 
sex, diabetes outcome, skill level and work hours. Female 
respondents in lower skilled occupations and those who 
developed diabetes over the follow-up period were more 
likely to be missing information on these characteristics. 
No relationship was observed between age and work hours 
and the probability of missing information.
Among the sample of 7065 respondents included in the 
analyses, we had 78 390 person-years of follow-up, with a 
median length of follow-up in the sample of 11.7 years. 
Initial descriptive analyses examined the distribution of 
diabetes incidence rate and cumulative incidence across 
weekly work hours categories. Cox proportional hazard 
regression models were then performed to evaluate the 
relationship between long work hours and the incidence 
of diabetes over the 12-year follow-up. The first model 
examined the effect of long work hours on diabetes 
after adjusting for age, weeks worked in the previous 12 
months and skill level. A second model was additionally 
adjusted including all other covariates, except health 
behaviors and BMI, which were adjusted for in the third 
and fourth models, respectively. Health behaviors and 
BMI were sequentially adjusted for since it is not clear 
whether these factors are confounders or mediators in 
the relationship between work exposures and diabetes. 
Including potential mediators in the regression models 
could be considered overadjustment.24 All models were 
conducted separately for men and women.25 Differences 
between estimates from men and women were assessed 
by comparing the point estimates and the associated vari-
ances of these estimates for models run separately for 
men and women.26 27
To account for the complex sample design of the CCHS, 
in line with the guidelines from Statistics Canada, the CIs 
around each point estimate, with the exception of inci-
dence rates per 1000 person-years, were adjusted using 
a bootstrap technique.18 All analyses were weighted to 
account for the probability of selection into the original 
sample and non-response. All analyses were conducted in 
SAS V.9.4.

women. Over the study period, 10% of the study popula-
tion developed diabetes, with a higher incidence among 
men (12.2%) than women (7.5%), older groups, and 
obese individuals. Among women, a higher incidence of 
diabetes was observed among those working more than 
40 hours per week compared with those working fewer 
hours. Conversely, among men, the incidence of diabetes 
rather tended to decrease as the number of work hours 
increased.
Table 3 provides the HRs of diabetes across work hours 
categories for men and women. Estimates were sequen-
tially adjusted for age, weeks worked in the previous 12 
months and the highest level of education (model 1), 
other sociodemographic characteristics, working condi-
tions and health conditions (model 2), health behaviors 
(model 3), and BMI (model 4). No significant effect was 
observed among men, although the estimates tended to 
lower as the number of work hours increased, as observed 
in the descriptive analyses. Among women, those usually 
working 45 hours or more per week had a significantly 
higher risk of developing diabetes than women working 
between 35 and 40 hours per week (HR from model 2: 
1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.57)). The effect was slightly atten-
uated when adjusted for the potentially mediating factors 
which are smoking, leisure time physical activity, alcohol 
consumption (model 3) and BMI (model 4).
disCussiOn
Three out of the four previous studies on work hours and 
diabetes were limited by the inclusion of only men8 28 or 
women.9 The current 12-year prospective study added 
new evidence on the importance of evaluating this rela-
tionship separately for both genders. Working 45 hours 
or more per week was associated with an increased inci-
dence of diabetes among women, but not men.
In line with our findings, Kroenke et al9 observed that 
working long hours led to an elevated risk of developing 
diabetes among women. These authors investigated 
whether the adverse effect was amplified among women 
having children or performing long hours of unpaid work 
outside employment. Surprisingly, no additional effect 
was observed within these subgroups. Recent evidence 
nonetheless suggested that assuming high family respon-
sibilities may intensify the tendency of adults working 
long hours to engage in unhealthy behaviors,29 experi-
ence difficulties with sleeping29 and have poor mental 
health.30 Perceiving a ‘too high total workload’ from both 
paid and unpaid work has also been linked to ill-health to 
a higher extent than performing long hours of paid work 
alone.31 In the current study, paid and unpaid hours spent 
on the job were measured, but unpaid hours performed 
outside of the employment were not. A post-hoc anal-
ysis examined whether living with children aged under 
12 years modified the relationship between work hours

and the risk of diabetes among sex. Unfortunately, the 
smaller sample size with this additional level of stratifi-
cation led to wide CIs around risk estimates. Given this 
lack of precision, the results were not presented in the 
current paper (but are available on request), although 
the adverse effect of working 45 hours per week or more 
was most elevated among women living with children 
less than 12. Future studies, with larger samples, should 
further investigate the potentially amplifying effect of 
household responsibilities in the relationship between 
long work hours and diabetes, especially among women.
In the current study, the incidence of diabetes among 
men tended to diminish as work hours increased, 
although this trend did not reach statistical significance. 
This finding is consistent with that of Nakanishi et al10 
showing a protective effect of working 8 hours or more 
per day on the incidence of diabetes among Japanese 
men. A first explanation for this finding could be a 
healthy workers selection effect,32 where an important 
proportion of men performing long work hours may 
be physically active at work and healthier than men 
working fewer hours. Supporting this hypothesis, more 
than a third of men working long hours in our sample 
(36%) were holding jobs involving combinations of 
sitting, standing and walking. These occupations have 
previously been linked to a reduction in the risk of heart 
diseases among men.33 Other explanations could be that 
men tend to get an important sense of identity through 
work,30 many men working long hours hold high-skilled 
and well-paid occupations,14 34 men who work long 
hours may have partners who work very few hours or not 
at all, and/or may be required to perform less unpaid 
work related to family/household responsibilities than 
women.35 Another previous Japanese study by Kawakami 
et al8 however showed an increased risk of diabetes among 
men working more than 50 hours per week in an elec-
trical company.8 During the 1-year observation period 
of this study, workers reported experiencing greater job 
demands and distress due to the rapid introduction of 
new automated production machines. The use of such 
technology could have contributed to the development 
of diabetes through pathways involving a reduction of 
physical activity during work hours36 or disturbances in 
glucose metabolism due to increases in blood pressure 
related to work stress.37
In their meta-analysis, Kivimäki et al5 observed an 
increased risk of developing diabetes according to long 
working hours (≥55 hours per week) in the low socioeco-
nomic status group, while no increase was observed in the 
high socioeconomic status group (based on occupational 
titles). This finding can be due to the fact that workers 
in low socioeconomic groups tend to be more exposed 
to adverse physical and psychosocial work constraints.38 
In the current study the modifying effect of occupational 
skill level was examined. Skill level was collapsed into

limited sample size in the lowest skill level group, that 
is, having only on-the-job training, prevented us from 
examining the relationship between work hours and 
the risk of diabetes among the lowest socioeconomic 
status group. This modifying effect should be further 
studied in both men and women, as it might contribute 
to enlighten sex/gender differences observed in the 
current study and in previous studies.9 10
The deleterious effect of long work hours observed 
among women of this study was robust to adjustment 
for sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteris-
tics, other work-related exposures, and health conditions 
including hypertension, arthritis, and anxiety symptoms. 
However, risk estimates slightly attenuated with supple-
mentary adjustments for smoking, leisure time physical 
activity, alcohol consumption (model 3) and BMI (model 
4). Since these cofactors may be part of causal path-
ways linking long work works to diabetes (intermediate 
factors), adjusting for them could be considered as 
overadjustment. Further investigations of these causal 
pathways are required to quantify the direct and indirect 
trajectories linking work hours, potentially intermediate 
factors and diabetes. The potential intermediate effect 
of obesity would be especially important to study consid-
ering that it is a strong risk factor of diabetes in both men 
and women (HR from a large-scale meta-analysis39: 5.13 
in men and 12.41 in women).
A few limitations of the current study need to be 
acknowledged. First, work hours were measured at a single 
time-point over the 12-year follow-up. Potential changes 
over time were thereby unaccounted for, which could 
have led to a potential misclassification bias. Such bias 
generally leads to an underestimation of the true effect. 
Second, it was not possible to distinguish type 1 and type 
2 diabetes in the administrative healthcare records. It has 
however been estimated that type 1 diabetes represents 
approximately only 5% of all cases in those 18 years old 
or older.40 Third, the administrative healthcare records 
used to capture diabetes require a medical diagnosis of 
diabetes. The number of cases has likely been underes-
timated due to undiagnosed cases. However, it has been 
estimated that over a 5-year period, more than 70% of 
Ontarians aged over 40 receive a serum blood glucose 
test.41 In addition, Ontario has a publicly funded health-
care system, which limits socioeconomic differences in 
access to general practitioner care.42 The use of biolog-
ical measures (such as glycated hemoglobin or blood 
glucose tolerance tests) would have allowed a more thor-
ough identification of diabetes cases, although finan-
cial and logistical constraints would likely have led to a 
smaller and potentially less generalizable sample than 
the population survey sample that we were able to use in 
this study. Also, healthcare records offered the advantage 
of accurately estimating the time between baseline inter-
view and diabetes diagnosis, rather than relying on the 
time between study measurements8–10 or evaluating the 
prevalence at follow-up,11 as seen in the previous studies 
on work hours and biologically measured diabetes.
Additional strengths of the current study include the use 
of a large sample representative of the general Ontarian 
working population and including 50% women, a good 
participation rate (78.5%), a long follow-up period (over 
12 years), and the consideration of several confounders. 
A further strength is the use of an objective measure of 
diabetes, which limits the potential for common method 
bias to inflate the effects. These strengths allowed the 
current study to go beyond existing knowledge by 
circumventing previous studies’ limitations, and there-
fore provided new insights about the effect of work hours 
on the development of diabetes in men and women.
COnClusiOns
Using a sample that is representative of the variety of 
occupations and industries of the Canadian labor market, 
the current study suggests that working 45 hours or more 
per week was associated with an increased incidence 
of diabetes among women. Considering the rapid and 
substantial increase of diabetes prevalence in Canada 
and worldwide, identifying modifiable risk factors such 
as long work hours is of major importance to improve 
prevention and orient policy making, as it could prevent 
numerous cases of diabetes and diabetes-related chronic 
diseases. Future studies documenting the pathways 
linking work hours, health behaviors, family responsi-
bilities and diabetes and related gender differences are 
nevertheless needed to gain a better understanding of 
the effects and enrich prevention strategies.
