Abstract
Introduction A number of safety signals—complex regio-
nal pain syndrome (CRPS), postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome (POTS), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)—
have emerged with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines,
which share a similar pattern of symptomatology. Previous
signal evaluations and epidemiological studies have largely
relied on traditional methodologies and signals have been
considered individually.
Objective The aim of this study was to explore global
reporting patterns for HPV vaccine for subgroups of reports
with similar adverse event (AE) profiles.
Methods All individual case safety reports (reports) for
HPV vaccines in VigiBase� until 1 January 2015 were
identified. A statistical cluster analysis algorithm was used
to identify natural groupings based on AE profiles in a
data-driven exploratory analysis. Clinical assessment of the
clusters was performed to identify clusters relevant to
current safety concerns.
Results Overall, 54 clusters containing at least five reports
were identified. The four largest clusters included 71 % of
the analysed HPV reports and described AEs included in
the product label. Four smaller clusters were identified to
include case reports relevant to ongoing safety concerns
(total of 694 cases). In all four of these clusters, the most
commonly reported AE terms were headache and dizziness
and fatigue or syncope; three of these four AE terms were
reported in [
50 % of the reports included in the clusters.
These clusters had a higher proportion of serious cases
compared with HPV reports overall (44–89 % in the
clusters
compared
with
24 %).
Furthermore,
only
a
minority of reports included in these clusters included AE
terms of diagnoses to explain these symptoms. Using
proportional reporting ratios, the combination of headache
and dizziness with either fatigue or syncope was found to
be more commonly reported in HPV vaccine reports
compared with non-HPV vaccine reports for females aged
9–25 years. This disproportionality remained when results
were stratified by age and when those countries reporting
the signals of CRPS (Japan) and POTS (Denmark) were
excluded.
Conclusions Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of
AEs following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature
and describe symptoms that overlap those reported in cases
from the recent safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS), but
which do not report explicit diagnoses. While the causal
association between HPV vaccination and these AEs
remains uncertain, more extensive analyses of spontaneous
reports can better identify the relevant case series for
thorough signal evaluation.

 Key Points
There are additional reports of adverse events (AEs)
following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature
and overlap with symptoms reported in cases from
the recent safety signals of postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome, complex regional pain
syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.
A causal association between HPV vaccination and
these AEs remains uncertain.
Methods such as cluster analysis can help identify
the relevant case series for thorough signal
evaluation.
1 Introduction
Vaccines against the human papillomavirus (HPV) were
initially introduced into public use 10 years ago, first with
the 2006 European approval of the quadrivalent vaccine,
Gardasil, and then subsequently with the 2007 approval of
the bivalent vaccine, Cervarix. Since that time it has been
estimated that 80 million girls and women worldwide have
received the HPV vaccination [1].
Introduction of HPV vaccination into national vaccina-
tion programmes has been varied between countries, with
Australia becoming the first country to introduce a gov-
ernment-funded National HPV Vaccination Program in
2007 [2]. Within the EU, Germany recommended vacci-
nation as early as 2007, the UK implemented the HPV
vaccination into the national vaccination programme in
2008, while the various Nordic countries incorporated the
vaccination between 2009 and 2012 [3]. Although avail-
able for private purchase in the US since 2007, it was not
until 2010 that HPV vaccines were required to be covered
in insurance policies [4]. Japan introduced the vaccine in
April 2010 and had uptake as high as 90 % in those regions
of the country in which the vaccine was available by
government subsidy. By August 2014, 58 countries had
introduced the HPV vaccine into their national immunisa-
tion programme for girls and also for boys in some coun-
tries [5].
In 2013, a number of safety signals arose for HPV
vaccines: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in
Japan, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
in Denmark, and long-lasting fatigue in the Netherlands
[6–8]. Each of these diagnoses are generally poorly
understood and largely under-recognised, particularly in
the pediatric population, as revealed in the relative paucity
of published data regarding their pathophysiology and
epidemiology. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)
reported a review of the safety concerns of POTS and
CRPS in November 2015. The assessment primarily
included a review of data submitted by the marketing
authorisation holders (MAHs) and consultation with a
scientific advisory group on vaccines. Although the EMA
acknowledged the inherent difficulty in an evaluation of
these signals (‘‘Symptoms of CRPS and POTS may overlap
with other conditions, making diagnosis difficult in both
the general population and vaccinated individuals’’), their
final conclusion was that the current evidence does not
suggest a causal association between HPV vaccines and
POTS or CRPS [9]. In spite of these regulatory assurances,
public concerns regarding the safety of HPV vaccines
remain as revealed in the recent significant decrease in
vaccine uptake in Denmark [10] and in the actions of
patient advocacy groups collaborating globally [11].
The aim of this work was to explore VigiBase, the
World Health Organization (WHO) international database
of suspected adverse drug reactions, for additional relevant
cases in the review of the serious safety signal for HPV
vaccines which has been difficult to fully characterise by
traditional signal detection methodology. We hypothesised
that different reporters might use different AE terms to
describe similar conditions, and yet there might be enough
overlap between reports describing related conditions to
identify subgroups of HPV vaccine reports with similar AE
profiles. To achieve these aims, a novel data-driven
approach to signal exploration was used: adverse event
(AE) cluster analysis.
2 Methods
The data source for this investigation was VigiBase, the
WHO international database of suspected adverse drug
reactions. VigiBase is a computerised pharmacovigilance
system in which information is recorded in a structured,
hierarchical form. Reports are received from national
pharmacovigilance centres in the 124 countries participat-
ing in the WHO Programme for International Drug Mon-
itoring (PIDM). Reports submitted to national centres come
from both regulated and voluntary sources. Limited details
about each suspected adverse reaction are received by the
Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) [12].
All individual case safety reports (reports) for HPV
vaccines received into VigiBase to 1 January 2015 were
identified for use in this investigation. All analyses were
performed on AE data at the Medical Dictionary for Reg-
ulatory Activities (MedDRA�) Preferred Term (PT)-level
terminology.

 Seriousness designation is included in reports and is
determined either by reporter or at local reporting, national
pharmacovigilance centres. Commonly used standardisa-
tion of seriousness is as provided by International Con-
ference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines [13].
2.1 Adverse Event Cluster Analysis
Cluster analysis seeks to identify natural subgroups in data
with closer resemblance between items within a subgroup
than between items in different subgroups. It represents a
form of unsupervised learning, where the algorithm is not
provided with known examples from a number of pre-
specified classes or other information on the nature of the
classes. Instead, the classes and their profiles are derived
from data without additional guidance. Restricting our
dataset to HPV case reports containing at least two AE
terms, we applied latent class cluster analysis [14], which is
based on a probabilistic mixture model in which each
report is assumed to have been generated in a random
process, drawn from one of a set of distinct latent classes,
each with its overall relative frequency and set of proba-
bilities for reported AE terms. To begin with, reports are
randomly allocated to a latent class. A so-called expecta-
tion–maximisation (EM) iteration [15] is then employed by
which the relative frequency and AE probabilities of each
class are alternatingly re-estimated based on its allocated
reports, and the reports are then re-allocated to latent
classes based on the updated relative frequencies and AE
profiles of these classes. In order to increase the stability of
our overall solution, we applied so-called consensus clus-
tering. EM iteration was thus repeated 100 times with
random starting points, and final clusters derived as groups
of reports that had been allocated to the same latent class as
another report in the same cluster, in at least 90 of the 100
original solutions to the latent class cluster analysis.
2.2 Clinical Review of Clusters
All resultant clusters were reviewed independently by two
different clinicians (RC and IRE) to determine the clinical
scenario described by each cluster. Clusters with symptoms
relevant for current safety concerns were selected for case-
level clinical review.
Cases within the identified clusters were reviewed for
clinical coherence, with a focus on seriousness, which
included review of seriousness criteria as well as clinical
assessment of case narrative information, when available,
for details regarding diagnostic procedures or results and
impact on quality of life (such as quitting activities,
missing school).
A case was deemed relevant to current safety concerns if
the reported AEs, seriousness, and/or case narrative
together would warrant inclusion of POTS, CRPS, or
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) into a clinical differential
diagnosis. Neither cases reporting alternate diagnoses as
AE terms or including narrative information (risk factors,
diagnostic results) suggestive of the potential for other
diagnoses nor cases describing symptoms that had either
resolved or had been ongoing for a short duration after
vaccination (up to 1 week) were considered to be relevant.
2.3 Proportional Reporting Ratios
Upon identification of the combination of the AE terms
headache and dizziness with either syncope or fatigue from
the results of the cluster analysis, an investigation was
made to explore if there was disproportionate reporting of
this combination of AE terms in HPV vaccine reports
compared with non-HPV vaccines in the same sex and age
band (females 9–25 years). To match the time period in
which HPV vaccines have been available, we limited the
comparator group (non-HPV vaccine reports) to those
received from 2005 onwards. Given that the age range
described in the indication for HPV vaccines is somewhat
wide, stratified analyses were also performed for the age
groups
9–12
years,
13–16 years,
17–20 years,
and
21–25 years, as a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, given
that the signals of CRPS and POTS arose from Japan and
Denmark, respectively, adjusted proportional reporting
ratios (PRRs) were calculated after exclusion of reports
from these two countries. A further analysis was made to
determine if there was disproportionality in the ‘serious-
ness’ of reports describing this combination of terms in
HPV vaccine reports compared with non-HPV vaccines.
PRRs were calculated [16].
3 Results
On 1 January 2015 there were a total of 10.3 million
reports in VigiBase, and 39,953 HPV vaccine reports were
entered into the clustering algorithm. The reports were
sorted into a total of 4116 clusters with 54 of the clusters
containing five or more reports. All 54 clusters are included
in electronic supplementary Table 1.
The four largest clusters included 71 % (28,502) of the
analysed HPV vaccine reports and described AEs that are
well characterised and are included in the product label,
such as local and systemic events and vasovagal reactions.
These clusters were further characterised by the fact that,
on average, reports included only a few AE terms (three to
four PTs) and were generally classified as non-serious
(Fig. 1). Clinical review of the smaller clusters revealed
that they described case series related to various clinical
scenarios,
such
as

dysplasia

 mononucleosis (cluster 21), and systemic lupus erythe-
matosus (cluster 39) [electronic supplementary Table 1].
Four smaller clusters were identified as including case
reports relevant to ongoing safety concerns. In all four of
these clusters, the most commonly reported AE terms were
headache and dizziness and fatigue or syncope; three of
these four AE terms were reported in[
50 % of the reports
included in the clusters. These clusters had a higher pro-
portion of serious cases compared with HPV reports overall
(44–89 % in the clusters compared with 24 %). The most
common criteria for a ‘serious’ designation was ‘caused/
prolonged hospitalisation’ (32 %, 139/432 serious reports),
‘disabling/incapacitating’ (27 %, 111/432), or a combina-
tion of these two (14 %, 62/432).
Three of these clusters contained significant proportions
of the total number of overall HPV reports contained
within Vigibase reporting the AE terms of POTS (58 %,
61/106), CRPS (20 %, 15/76) and CFS (37 %, 32/87);
however, case reports including one of these diagnoses
represented only a small proportion of the total cases
included in the clusters (15 % of 694 reports) (Table 1)].
Individual-level review of cases within the clusters
revealed further clinical coherence between the clusters
reflected in the various patterns of less commonly reported
AEs, including symptom terms (such as nausea, muscular
weakness, disturbances in attention) and diagnostic pro-
cedure terms (such as electrocardiogram, magnetic reso-
nance imaging head), as well as the impact on the life of
the reporter, as identified from seriousness, reported AEs
(such as activities of daily life impaired, quality of life
decreased, bedridden, wheelchair user) and case narrative
information. Case examples demonstrating an impact on
the life of the reporter from each of the clusters include: ‘‘I
[mother] am very frustrated and so is she. This has affected
our entire family. I feel helpless and don’t know how to
help her’’ (cluster 8, case coded as ‘non-serious’); ‘‘She
was clever in school and at home, liked to go swimming,
bicycling, dancing and so on. After the vaccinations with
Gardasil she stopped being active, the life altered to the
worst’’ (cluster 14, case coded as serious ‘disabling/inca-
pacitating’, included both MedDRA terms ‘quality of life
decreased’ and ‘activities of daily living impaired’);
‘‘Missed lots of school due to NO energy and feeling bad.
Will sometimes sleep 12 to 20 hours a day. Very healthy
before the shot. She is tired of being sick’’ (cluster 17, case
coded as ‘non-serious’); ‘‘It’s too late for my son whose
life has been irrevocably altered/his life has never been the
same’’ (cluster 34, case coded as ‘non-serious’, included
the MedDRA term ‘quality of life decreased’).
Based on these individual-level clinical reviews, the
majority of the total of 694 cases (77.5 %) included in
these four clusters were deemed to be relevant to ongoing
safety concerns.
A timeline of the years of receipt of the cases contained
within the clusters into VigiBase reveals that cases have
been received throughout the post-marketing life of HPV
vaccines. The reporting countries represented in these
clusters are the following: USA with 491 cases, Denmark
with 88 cases, Japan with 39 cases, Germany with 28 cases,
the United Kingdom with 23 cases, Ireland with 6 cases,
Spain with 5 cases, France with 3 cases, Canada and
Australia and Belgium and Norway with 2 cases, and
Austria, Sweden, and Hungary with 1 case each. Those
countries with earlier introduction of HPV vaccination into
routine use reported the earliest cases (Australia, Germany
the United States, and the UK) with an increasing contri-
bution by those countries with a later introduction (Ireland,
Japan, Denmark) (Fig. 2).
PRRs were calculated using 45,780 HPV vaccine reports
and
32,839
non-HPV
vaccine
reports
from
females
between the ages of 9 and 25 years. There were 596
(1.3 %) HPV vaccine reports containing the AE combina-
tion of interest (headache and dizziness with either syncope
or fatigue) compared with 175 reports (0.53 %) for other
vaccines. The PRR was 2.44 (95 % confidence interval
[CI] 2.07–2.89). The age-stratified analysis revealed that
the PRR for this combination of AEs remained statistically
significantly increased for HPV vaccines compared with
other vaccines in all age groups, with the smallest value
being 2.09 (95 % CI 1.55–2.81). Additionally, the PRR for
this combination of terms remained significant when
reports from Japan and Denmark were excluded (2.28,
95 % CI 1.92–2.70) [electronic supplementary Table 2].
When restricting analyses to only those reports with
available information regarding ‘seriousness’, the reporting
rate of serious reports with this combination of AE for
HPV vaccines was 53.3 % and 43.9 % for other vaccines.
The PRR is therefore calculated to be 1.21 (1.00–1.47). In
both the age-stratified analyses and the analysis excluding
reports from Japan and Denmark, the PRR for serious
reports with this combination of AEs were all[
1, however
these results were no longer statistically significant (elec-
tronic supplementary Table 3).
4 Discussion
Our analysis of global reports of suspected AEs following
HPV vaccination has revealed a large number of reports
with a pattern of AEs, including headache, dizziness,
fatigue and syncope, distinguished from more common
AEs by their serious nature (causing/prolonging hospitali-
sation and/or disabling/incapacitating), resulting in an
impact on the quality of life of the patient. Included in this
group are reports that have been labelled as POTS, CFS,
and CRPS, but the majority of the reports lack explicit

 diagnoses. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that the
combination of headache and dizziness with either fatigue
or syncope is reported significantly more often in HPV
vaccine reports compared with non-HPV vaccine reports
for females aged 9–25 years; this disproportionality
remains when results are stratified by age and when those
countries reporting the signals of CRPS (Japan) and POTS
(Denmark) are excluded.

 Given concerns regarding the influence in reporting
secondary to media, we restricted our analyses to reports
that had been collected up to 1 January 2015 in order to
reduce any influence in reporting secondary to both the
widely publicised regulatory action of the EMA taken in
July 2015 and the widely viewed television program ‘De
vaccinerede piger’, which first aired in Denmark in March
2015 and was subsequently placed on YouTube with
English subtitles. In addition, we have shown that cases
within the clusters have been distributed over the entire
postmarketing life of HPV vaccines, with cases first
reported from those countries that were the first to rec-
ommend and/or implement HPV vaccination into routine
use. Furthermore, in our PRR analyses, we have found an
increased reporting of this combination of AE events in
HPV vaccines compared with other vaccines, even when
reports from Japan and Denmark are excluded. Finally, the
proportion of serious cases among reports with the AE
combination was at least as high (but not significantly
higher) for HPV vaccines as for non-HPV vaccines, which
might not have been so if attention in the media would
have led to increased reporting, primarily of less severe
events.
The greatest limitation of this study is the lack of
information on many of the reports in VigiBase. Missing
data means that it may be difficult to make a clinical
judgment regarding case relevancy, and thus there is the
potential for a lack of consistency between different

seen from the figure, case reports included in the clusters have been
received throughout the whole of the HPV vaccine postmarketing
period, with the earliest reports received from those countries who
were the first to introduce the HPV vaccine into their vaccination
programmes. Countries of origin are diverse, with the first reports
from Denmark and Japan (signalling countries) received in 2013. In
that same year, the largest number of reports were received from the
USA (64) Denmark (55) the UK (13), and Germany (12). In 2010, a

contribute to the final signal. Given the high proportion of

variation in clinical judgment between assessors is unlikely
to change the overall conclusion of our analysis.
The cases within the clusters are notably similar to those
described in a number of safety signals for the HPV vac-
cines. In The Netherlands, the Pharmacovigilance Centre
Lareb has published the document ‘‘Long-lasting adverse
events following immunization with Cervarix�’’ [8]. Given
a large number of reports of long lasting (
[
2 months) AEs
following immunisation, a survey to enhance the clinical
documentation level of these reports was performed.
Overall 230 reports were considered relevant. Several
combinations of frequently reported AEs were found, with
the most common being fatigue, headache and muscu-
loskeletal discomfort. Furthermore, the follow-up survey
revealed that these long-lasting, unexplained symptoms
have had a considerable impact on both the lives of the
girls and their family members. In Japan, Kinoshita et al.
reported a cohort of 40 subjects in whom they described
headaches, general fatigue, coldness of the legs, limb pain
and weakness. Eighteen girls met the criteria for a diag-
nosis of CRPS and, using the Schellong test, four were
identified as having POTS. The authors in Japan hypothe-
sised that the symptoms could be explained by abnormal
peripheral sympathetic responses [6]. In Denmark, Brinth
et al. reported a cohort of 35 subjects in whom they
described nausea, chronic headache, fatigue, palpitations,
reduced cognitive function, skin changes, intermittent tre-
mor/myoclonic twitches, neuropathic pain, sleep distur-
bances,
and
muscular
weakness.
All
subjects
were
diagnosed with orthostatic intolerance [7]. In the US,
Blitshteyn reported a case series whose symptoms included
dizziness, fatigue, nausea, weight loss and exercise intol-
erance [17], while in Mexico, Martinez-Lavı
´n described
two patients with fibromyalgia-type symptoms, including
severe pain, insomnia, profound fatigue, and paraesthesia
[18]. A signal of gastrointestinal motility disorders from
the UMC described a case series of 26 subjects, in whom
15 reported concomitant fatigue, 13 reported either head-
ache or migraine, and 9 reported dizziness [19]. The most
recent publication is a report from Italy that describes a
case series of 18 girls (aged 12–24 years) who were
referred to a ‘Second Opinion Medical Network’ for the
evaluation of ‘neuropathy with autonomic dysfunction’
after HPV vaccination; all girls complained of long-lasting
and invalidating somatoform symptoms (including asthe-
nia, headache, cognitive dysfunctions, myalgia, sinus
tachycardia and skin rashes) [20]. It is acknowledged that
these publications represent case series and thus have the
limitations that are traditionally associated with these types
of reports. However, the collection of a number of case
series displaying similar patterns of AEs from geographi-
cally distributed locations potentially adds to the overall
strength of the signal.
The EMA referral procedure focused on the two specific
syndromes of POTS and CRPS; the reviews of the safety
database and observed versus expected analyses performed
on spontaneous reports by the MAHs considered each of
these two syndromes separately. Furthermore, although it
was requested that the MAH use ‘common search strate-
gies’ to identify potentially undiagnosed case reports with
combinations of signs and symptoms common in CRPS or
POTS, the details of these search strategies have not been
provided in the publically available assessment report.
However, the total number of additional cases identified by
these queries, even prior to their assessment according to
CRPS and POTS diagnostic criteria, were less than the
cases identified by the explicit reporting of the terms POTS
and CRPS [9]. In contrast, our analysis identified a greater
number of potentially undiagnosed cases than the total
number of cases that had been labelled with one of these
diagnoses.
There have been a number of epidemiological investi-
gations regarding safety concerns of the HPV vaccine that
have relied primarily on the reporting of a specific diag-
nosis or single-symptom concept, either as a diagnostic
billing code or single or synonymous AE terms to define
the relevant case series. An epidemiological study in The
Netherlands was designed to investigate the potential for an
increased risk of migraine headaches after HPV vaccina-
tion [21]. As part of a proactive pharmacovigilance plan,
the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA)
performed an epidemiological study using self-controlled
case-series methodology in which they identified cases
reporting ‘fatigue-containing’ terms, such as chronic fati-
gue, chronic fatigue syndrome, post-viral fatigue and
fibromyalgia [22]. Although laudable that it considered a
variety of fatigue-related terms, the study did not account
for co-reported symptoms of a more varied nature. Simi-
larly, while the results of the largest post-authorisation
safety studies have been reassuring overall, it must be
remembered that such studies have used predefined, well-
defined medical pathologies as endpoints [23–26]. The use
of epidemiological studies that require specific case defi-
nitions are useful to quantify the risks of safety concerns
after a signal has been identified and well-characterised
from AE reports.
Given the lack of consensus on the specific diagnosis
these spontaneous reports describe, a focus on symptoma-
tology and seriousness in combination with an investiga-
tion of the underlying pathology may be required to fully
elucidate this safety signal. Evidence of a common
pathophysiology in girls with this symptomatology is, in
88
R. E. Chandler et al.
 fact, currently emerging, with a focus on autoantibodies to
G protein-coupled receptors in the nervous system, such as
b2-adrenergic and muscarinic-2 receptors which have been
isolated from one subject in the US [27] and in a large
proportion of a sample of patients in Denmark (Mehlsen J,
personal communication). These results could explain the
variety of labels that have been used to explain this
symptomatology, as autoantibodies to these receptors have
been previously linked with CRPS, POTS, and CFS
[28–31].
A causal association with the HPV vaccine remains
uncertain; however, we believe that a more thorough
investigation of this signal is required to ensure continued
public trust in both vaccination programmes and regulatory
authorities.
5 Conclusions
Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of AEs following
HPV vaccination, which are serious in nature and with
overlap in signs and symptoms to recent safety signals for
POTS, CRPS, and CFS, but without explicit diagnoses.
Furthermore, there is the suggestion of disproportional
reporting of this pattern of symptomatology in reports after
HPV vaccination compared with other vaccines in females
9–25 years of age. This disproportionality remained even
when those countries reporting the signals of CRPS (Japan)
and POTS (Denmark) were excluded.
A causal association between these AEs and HPV vac-
cination remains uncertain; however, given the medical
seriousness of this safety concern, we believe that a more
definitive study of the findings presented here is essential to
ensure continued confidence in the HPV vaccine.
Our study illustrates how more extensive analyses of
spontaneous reports can better identify the relevant case
series for thorough signal evaluation.
