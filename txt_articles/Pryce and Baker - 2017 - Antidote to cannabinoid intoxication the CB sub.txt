BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Cannabis is a recreational drug leading to intoxication, following stimulation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors. However, more
recently, herbs mixed with synthetic cannabinoids sometimes known as ‘Spice’ and ‘Black Mamba’ have been increasingly used,
and their high CB1 receptor affinity has led not only to marked intoxication but also life-threatening complications and an in-
creasing number of deaths. Although many studies have indicated that prophylactic treatment with CB1 receptor antagonists can
block cannabimimetic effects in animals and humans, the aim of this study was to determine whether CB1 receptor antagonism
could reverse physical cannabimimetic effects.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Cannabimimetic effects, measured by the hypothermic response following sedation and hypomotility, were induced by the
synthetic CB1 receptor agonist CB-13 (1-naphthalenyl[4-(pentyloxy)-1-naphthalenyl]methanone) in Biozzi Antibody High mice.
The CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist AM251 (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-
1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) was administered 20 min after the injection of CB-13 and its effects on the cannabimimetic re-
sponses were assessed.
KEY RESULTS
In this study, the CNS-related cannabimimetic effects, as measured by the hypothermic effect, induced by the CB1 receptor
agonist were therapeutically treated and were rapidly reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. There was also a
subjective reversal of visually evident sedation.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have been widely used and so may provide an acceptable single-dose antidote to cannabinoid
intoxication. This use may save human life, where the life-threatening effects are mediated by cannabinoid receptors and not off-
target influences of the synthetic cannabinoids or non-cannabinoids within the recreational drug mixture.

 Introduction
Cannabis sativa is a mind-altering recreational drug that con-
tains cannabinoid compounds, most notably Δ9-tetrahy-
drocannabinol (THC; Howlett et al., 2002). This acts via
the cannabinoid CB1 receptor that is widely expressed
by CNS nerves, to induce a number of behavioural and phys-
iological effects (Howlett et al., 2002). More recently, syn-
thetic CB1 receptor agonists, which often exhibit markedly
higher agonist activity than THC (Ki = 40 nM, at CB1 recep-
tors; Howlett et al., 2002), have become increasingly widely
used as an alternative to botanical cannabis (Keyes et al.,
2016). These recreational drugs, such as Spice, Black Mamba
and Buzz are laced with a variety of ever-changing, synthetic
CB1 receptor agonists (Fattore and Fratta, 2011; Hutter et al.,
2012; Hess et al., 2015; Kemp et al., 2016; Tournebize et al.,
2017). These agonists
include
JWH-018
(Ki
=
9
nM),
JWH-122 (Ki = 1 nM), JWH-250 (Ki = 11 nM), JWH-251
(Ki = 29 nM) and AM2201 (Ki = 1 nM), which can cause sub-
stantial intoxication, withdrawal symptoms, psychosis and
death (Fattore and Fratta, 2011; Kemp et al., 2016; Tournebize
et al., 2017). Although most exposures to these recreational
drugs result in non-life-threatening effects, not requiring
treatment (Hoyte et al., 2012), those containing synthetic
cannabinoids are causing an increasing number of appar-
ently cannabinoid-related deaths (Hoyte et al., 2012; Kemp
et al., 2016; Tournebize et al., 2017).
In animals, cannabimimetic effects have been associated
with a tetrad of behavioural effects including catalepsy, anal-
gesia, lack of locomotor activity and thermoregulation, medi-
ated mainly by THC within cannabis and by CB1 receptors
expressed within the CNS (Zimmer et al., 1999; Varvel et al.,
2005; Croxford et al., 2008). These behavioural effects in-
duced by THC and synthetic cannabinoids can be blocked
by CB1 receptor antagonists (Varvel et al., 2005; Marshell
et al., 2014). Likewise, behavioural and physiological effects
of
cannabis
can
be
blocked
by
CB1
receptor
antagonists/inverse agonists in humans (Huestis et al.,
2007). Therefore, receptor blockade could act as an antidote
to limit potentially life-threatening intoxication.
Although there are claims that inverse agonists of CB1 re-
ceptors can reverse cannabimimetic effects of synthetic can-
nabinoids (Taffe et al., 2015), on closer analysis, it is evident
that these antagonists/inverse agonists are typically applied
before the cannabinoid agonist. Therefore, it is an inhibition
of the development of cannabimimetic effects rather than a
reversal of established cannabimimetic effects (Huestis et al.,
2007; Marshell et al., 2014; Taffe et al., 2015). We therefore
assessed the possibility that cannabimimetic effects of a syn-
thetic cannabinoid could be reversed after they are manifest,
to test the hypothesis that CB1 receptor antagonists could act
as antidotes to cannabinoid intoxication.
Methods
Animals
All animal care and experimental procedures were performed
following ethical review by the Local Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Bodies and the UK Government Home Office.
Animals were housed, and experiments were performed, in
accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986
and
European Union
Directives
EU
2010/63/EU.
Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE
guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath and Lilley, 2015).
Adult Biozzi Antibody High (ABH) female mice were from
stock bred at Queen Mary University of London (Pryce et al.,
2014).
As
both
male
and
female
mice
develop
cannabimimetic effects (Pryce et al., 2014), as found in
humans (Schneiret al., 2011; Tournebize et al., 2017), animals
were selected based on availability and knowledge of drug re-
sponsiveness in the ABH wild-type and ABH.Cnr1�/� CB1
receptor-deficient mice (Pryce et al., 2014).
Treatments
A dose of CB-13 (5 mg·kg�1 i.p.) was selected that was known
to induce hypothermia in ABH mice and not in CB1-deficient
ABH mice (Pryce et al., 2014). AM251 was used at a dose
(5 mg·kg�1) known to prophylactically antagonize CB1 ago-
nists and was injected i.v. 20 min after CB-13 administration
at a time when it was known that hypothermia and sedation
would be present (Pryce et al., 2014).
T
emperature measurement
A K-type thermocouple was placed under the hind limb, and
the maximum temperature at each time point was measured
(Pryce et al., 2014). This element of the tetrad tests (Varvel
et al., 2005) was selected as it could most easily, rapidly and re-
peatedly be measured in groups of animals. Sedation seen by
visually assessed marked hypomotility was recorded as being
evident or unremarkable, but was not measured using open-
field monitoring of hypomotility within 5 min (Varvel et al.,
2005), as it was not possible to repeatedly quantitatively mea-
sure hypomotility with available equipment. Animals were
randomly selected to treatment, and the study was un-
blinded. The sample size (n ≥ 5) was based on experience from
previous studies with other compounds to obtain adequate
safety data to achieve the objectives of the study. Tempera-
tures were measured at baseline, 20 min (Pryce et al., 2014)
and 60 min after administration of CB-13. Additional mea-
surements at 40 and 120 min were taken in animals receiving
AM251.
Data and statistical analysis
The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommen-
dations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacol-
ogy
(Curtis
et
al.,
2015)
Repeated
measures
one-way
ANOVA, with Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test, or
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test or t-tests, with the
samples assessed for normality and equality of variances were
assessed
using
Sigmaplot
V11
(Systat
Software
Inc.,
Hounslow, UK). Paired analysis of the presence, assigned a
value of 1, or absence assigned a value of 0, of visible marked
sedation
(hypomotility)
was
performed
using
repeated
ANOVA on ranks using Sigmaplot V11. P < 0.05 was the level
of statistical significance.

Results
As anticipated, a 5 mg·kg�1, i.p. dose of CB-13 induced hypo-
thermia in ABH mice (Figure 1), which has been shown previ-
ously to be CB1 receptor-mediated and completely absent in
CB1 receptor-deficient mice (Pryce et al., 2014). This induced
significant visible sedation and also induced hypothermia,
which was measured to provide a quantitative readout. The
hypothermic effect was rapidly antagonized with AM251
(5 mg·kg�1, i.v.; Figure 1), and the significant marked seda-
tion, associated with the relative lack of motility, was lost
within 20 min. The hypothermia was lost by 40 min after
treatment with AM251 (Figure 1). Therefore, a CB1 receptor
inverse
agonist
can
reverse
CB1
receptor-mediated
cannabimimetic effects.
Discussion
This study suggests that CB1 receptor inverse agonism/
antagonism could act as an antidote to reverse cannabinoid
intoxication. However, the commercial development of CB1
receptor antagonists, including studies with rimonabant
(CB1 Ki = 12 nM), taranabant (CB1 Ki = 9–10 nM) and
otenabant (CB1 Ki = 1 nM) (Howlett et al., 2002), was halted
due
to
adverse
neuropsychiatric
effects
(Janero
and
Makriyannis, 2009). However, many thousands of people
have safely taken and tolerated a dose of a CB1 receptor antag-
onist /inverse agonist (Van Gaal et al., 2008; Topol et al.,
2010). The adverse events, notably depression, anxiety and
a low risk of suicide, which prompted withdrawal of
rimonabant from the market (Janero and Makriyannis,
2009), were not considered to be acceptable to justify its
long-term use against what may be considered lifestyle, food
and tobacco issues (Doggrell, 2008; Janero and Makriyannis,
2009). However, single-use cannabinoid antagonist therapy
to block potentially life-threatening, cannabinoid intoxica-
tion may be worth the re-manufacture and testing for such
an indication.
Although intoxication and possibly deaths (Hess et al.,
2015; Lusher, 2016) may be related to cannabinoid receptor
agonism, as the causative agents are unlicensed, lack proper
toxicology testing and have variable content, these deaths
may relate to the actions of toxic metabolites on alternative
targets unrelated to the cannabinoid system or possibly
non-cannabinoid compounds. The physical effects usually
reported include tachycardia, nausea, somnolence, halluci-
nations, paranoia and dry mouth syndrome (xerostomia) typ-
ical of cannabis intoxication. However, atypical cannabis
intoxication effects and worse complications such as psycho-
sis, seizures, flaccid paralysis, renal injuries, aggressiveness,
cerebral ischaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarc-
tion, coma and death have all been reported following the
use of synthetic cannabinoids (Kemp et al., 2016; Tournebize
et al., 2017). Cannabis intoxication is not usually fatal in
humans (Hartung et al., 2014), but high doses of cannabi-
noids can cause death in animals, via cardiovascular effects
that have been seen in people using synthetic cannabinoids
(Beaulieu, 2005; Andonian et al., 2017). Because there is not
enough data to be confident that the toxicity of the ‘Spice’
products is really due to their cannabinoid content, perhaps
the best way of determining whether this is the case would
be to undertake a trial of a rescue cannabinoid receptor
antagonist.
Proof of concept studies of p.o. formulations, for which
there is toxicological data and knowledge from human use,
could be administered to people who are conscious and com-
pliant. This may help determine whether the investment re-
quired to develop an i.v. formulation for use by paramedics
or more importantly an i.m. formulation for use in an emer-
gency autoinjector is justified. Because of the knowledge as-
sociated with their use in humans, it would be easier to
develop one of the antagonists/inverse agonists that have en-
tered clinical development, notably rimonobant, as it would
have a large history of human use and is known to antagonize
some of the chemical entities found in ‘Spice’ (Hruba and
McMahon, 2017). Further studies would be needed to deter-
mine whether other antagonists (McPartland et al., 2015),
which may lack the neurobehavioural issues associated with
inverse agonism with compounds of high CB1 receptor affin-
ity, are of value. However, unless a CB1-receptor antagonist
manufacturer is willing to undertake such studies, it would

 be futile to perform more animal studies. These could estab-
lish whether inverse agonism is required or whether receptor
blockade by low-affinity antagonists, neutral antagonism or
allosteric receptor modulation has similar efficacy. Just as nal-
oxone can be used to limit the effects of opioid overdose
(Wermeling, 2015), single-use CB1 receptor inverse agonists
could perhaps help save human life.
