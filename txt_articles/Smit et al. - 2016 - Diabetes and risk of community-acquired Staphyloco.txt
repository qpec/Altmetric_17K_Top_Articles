Clinical Study
Abstract
Objective: Patients with diabetes may experience higher risk of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) than patients 
without diabetes due to decreased immunity or coexisting morbidities. We investigated the risk of community-
acquired (CA) SAB in persons with and without diabetes.
Design: Using population-based medical databases, we conducted a case–control study of all adults with first-time 
CA-SAB and matched population controls in Northern Denmark, 2000 – 2011.
Methods: Based on conditional logistic regression, we computed odds ratios (ORs) of CA-SAB according to diabetes. 
We further assessed whether the risk of CA-SAB differed according to various diabetes-related characteristics 
(e.g. duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and presence of diabetes complications).
Results: We identified 2638 patients with incident CA-SAB, of whom 713 (27.0%) had diabetes, and 26 379 matched population 
controls (2495 or 9.5% with diabetes). Individuals with diabetes had a substantially increased risk of CA-SAB compared with 
population controls (adjusted OR 
= 
2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5 
– 
3.1)). Duration of diabetes of ≥10 years and poor 
glycemic control conferred higher risk estimates, with an adjusted OR 
= 
2.3 (95% CI: 1.9 
– 
2.7) for diabetes with Hba1c 
 
< 
 
7% 
(< 
 
53 mmol/mol) and an adjusted OR 
= 
5.7 (95% CI: 4.2 
– 
7.7) for diabetes with Hba1c ≥9% (≥75 
mmol/mol). The risk of CA-SAB 
was particularly high in patient with diabetes complications: adjusted OR 
= 
5.5 (95% CI: 4.2 
– 
7.2) with presence of microvascular 
complications and OR 
= 7.0 (95% CI: 5.4 
– 
9.0) with combined macro- and microvascular complications.
Conclusions: Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of CA-SAB, particularly in patients with diabetes 
of long duration, poor glycemic control, and diabetes complications.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus remains a leading cause of bacteremia 
associated 
with 
a 
30-day 
mortality 
of 
20 
– 
40% 
(1, 
2). 
Diabetes 
is an increasingly common disease with detrimental 
effects on almost all organ systems and patients’ quality 
of life (3, 4). Patients with diabetes may have increased 
susceptibility to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) for a number 
of reasons including tissue hyperglycemia and decreased 
oxygenation, and generally reduced immunity (5, 6). High 
age, coexisting morbidities and diabetes complications 
may further increase the risk of SAB (6).
In previous studies of SAB, diabetes has been noted as 
an underlying disease in 20 
– 
32% of patients (7, 8, 9, 10). 
 
Nevertheless, few clinical data exist concerning the asso-
ciation between diabetes and SAB, and to our knowl-
edge, no prior study has investigated diabetes as a risk 
factor for SAB as the main exposure. In previous studies, 
patients with diabetes have been identified using non-
validated methods, and diabetes has been treated as one 
entity disregarding the duration of disease, quality of gly-
cemic control, and presence of diabetes complications

(11, 12, 13, 14). In addition, the majority of former stud-
ies has been based on small and selected study popula-
tions (n 
  <   
250) (11, 13, 14).
Detailed information on the association between dia-
betes and SAB may extend our understanding of risk fac-
tors for SAB and help to optimize preventive measures for 
the growing group of persons with diabetes. Therefore, we 
conducted a population-based case–control study to inves-
tigate whether diabetes is associated with an increased 
risk of community-acquired SAB (CA-SAB). In addition, 
we ascertained the risk of CA-SAB according to various 
characteristics of patients with diabetes (e.g. 
diabetes type, 
duration of diabetes, and presence of diabetes complica-
tions), and we explored whether the risk of CA-SAB dif-
fered according to sex, age, and level of comorbidity.
Methods
Setting
This case–control study was conducted in Northern 
Denmark (catchment population ~1.8 million inhabitants) 
between January 1 2000 and December 31 2011 using 
population-based medical databases with routinely 
recorded data. Denmark has a tax-supported healthcare 
system providing free and unrestricted access to medical 
care for the entire Danish population. All Danish citizens 
are assigned a unique identification number (the civil 
registration number) upon birth or immigration, which 
allows unambiguous electronic linkage across the data 
sources (15, 16).
Patients with S. aureus bacteremia
Patients hospitalized with CA-SAB were identified in 
the databases of four regional departments of clinical 
microbiology from 1995 onwards (information on blood 
culture practice and susceptibility testing is provided in the 
Supplementary Material 1, see section on supplementary 
data given at the end of this article). We restricted inclusion 
to patients ≥15 years with presence of ≥1 positive blood 
cultures with S. aureus as the sole isolate. Compared to 
the general population, patients with previous SAB are at 
increased risk of reinfection with SAB (17). Therefore, we 
only included patients with incident SAB, defined as no 
prior SAB diagnosis within at least 5 years of the current 
admission.
CA-SAB was defined as SAB in patients, in whom one 
or more positive blood cultures had been obtained within 
the first 2 days of admission. If the positive blood culture 
had been obtained >2 days after admission, the infection 
was considered to be hospital-acquired, and the patient 
was excluded. The subset of CA-SAB patients with recent 
contacts to healthcare before the current admission was 
further classified as healthcare-associated SAB (HCA-SAB) 
if one or more of the following criteria were fulfilled: ≥1 
hospital admission, ≥1 contacts to hospital outpatient 
surgical clinics, ≥1 contacts to clinics of hematology, 
oncology or nephrology, all within a 30-day window of 
the current admission.
Information on recent healthcare contacts was pro-
vided by the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) 
(18). The DNPR has tracked all admissions to Danish hos-
pitals since 1977 and all visits to hospital outpatient clin-
ics since 1995. Each record includes the dates of hospital 
admission and discharge, up to 20 discharge diagnoses, 
and information on surgical procedures.
Selection of population controls
The Danish Civil Registration System (DCRS), which 
is updated daily, keeps records on sex, age, residence, 
marital status, and vital status for all Danish residents 
(15, 16). We used this registry to randomly select 
10 population controls for each SAB case on the date the 
first positive blood culture was drawn, matching by age, 
sex, and residence. Each control was assigned an index 
date identical to the SAB admission date for the matched 
case. We utilized the risk set sampling technique (19), 
i.e. eligible population controls had to be alive and at 
risk of a first hospitalization with SAB on the date the 
corresponding case was admitted.
Patients with diabetes
For both cases and controls, we identified patients with 
diabetes using a previously validated algorithm (20) 
that incorporates three databases: the DNPR, the LABKA 
Database (21), and The Aarhus University Prescription 
Database (AUPD) (22). Patients with a discharge or 
outpatient diagnosis of diabetes registered at any time 
before the index date were identified in the DNPR. The 
LABKA database (CSC Scandihealth, Denmark) holds 
laboratory test results from patients in Northern Denmark 
for the entire study period, including the exact time of 
blood sample collection (21). Using this database, we 
identified patients with a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) level of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or more measured 
at any time predating the index date. The AUPD contains

information on all filled prescriptions in the study area in 
accordance with the anatomical therapeutic classification 
(ATC) (22). This database permitted identification of 
patients with at least one recorded prescription for any 
antidiabetic drug at any time before the index date 
(diagnostic, laboratory, and ATC codes are provided in 
the Supplementary Material 2). Patients with diabetes 
diagnosed before age 30 years, using insulin monotherapy, 
and with no history of oral anti diabetes medication were 
classified as type 1 diabetes. The remaining patients with 
diabetes were classified as type 2 diabetes.
Characteristics of patients with diabetes
We computed the duration of diabetes as the time elapsed 
between the first record of diabetes in any of the three 
registers and the date the first positive blood culture was 
sampled. To assess the level of preadmission glycemic 
control, we obtained data on all Hba1c measurements 
within 12 months of the index date. One or more Hba1c 
measurements were available for 515 (72%) of the 713 
cases with CA-SAB, and 1819 (73%) of the 2495 controls 
with diabetes. The most recent Hba1c measurement before 
the index date was used in our analyses. Based on in- or 
outpatient contacts registered in the DNPR, we obtained 
data on the presence of macrovascular-, and microvascular 
complications, including in the latter indication of 
diabetes-associated renal disease in previous laboratory 
tests (defined by two separate dates with urinary albumin 
tests above the cut-off for microalbuminuria). Using the 
DNPR, we also identified patients with diabetes with 
conditions related to diabetic foot ulcers (i.e. neuropathy 
and/or peripheral atherosclerosis or vascular disease) 
and diabetes patients with previous lower-extremity 
ulcer diagnoses or ulcer-related procedures, as described 
previously 
(23). 
Preadmission 
renal 
function 
was 
ascertained using the most recent creatinine measurement 
from a general practitioner or an outpatient hospital 
clinic 1 year to 7 days before the index date (available 
for 78% of patients). We computed estimated glomerular 
filtration rates (eGFR) applying the four-variable version 
of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation (24) 
(equation provided in the Supplementary Material 2).
Demographics, comorbidity, and medication
Using the DNPR (18), we retrieved all diagnoses recorded 
up to 10 years before the index date to identify previous 
morbidity included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI). The CCI is a validated scoring system for ascertaining 
patients’ comorbid conditions in epidemiological studies 
and covers both the number and severity of 19 major 
disease categories (25, 26). Because diabetes constituted the 
exposure variable of interest, we removed this condition 
from the CCI and designated the index as a modified CCI 
(m-CCI). We classified patients as having a low (score = 
0), 
an intermediate (score 
= 
1 – 2), or a high comorbidity level 
(score >2). Data on a number of comorbid conditions 
not included in the CCI, including hypertension, dialysis 
(within 30 days of the index date), osteoporosis, and 
conditions related to alcohol and drug abuse were also 
collated. Using the AUPD, we retrieved information on 
prescriptions filled before the index date: Any previous 
use of antihypertensive treatment, statins, anticoagulants, 
and use of immunosuppressive or antibiotic drugs within 
30 days of the index date (laboratory, diagnostic, and ATC 
codes are provided in the Supplementary Material 2).
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of patients with and without diabetes 
were described in a contingency table. We used 
conditional logistic regression to compute crude and 
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) as a measure of relative risks 
of SAB among patients with and without diabetes. 
Diabetes exposure was further categorized by diabetes 
type, duration of diabetes (<  3, ≥3 – 
 <  6, ≥6 – 
 <  10, 
≥10 years), level of glycemic control (Hba1c 
 <  7% 
(<  53 mmol/mol), ≥7 – 
 <  8% (≥53 – 
 <  64 mmol/mol), 
≥8 – 
 <  9% (≥64 – 
 <  75 mmol/mol), ≥9% (≥75 mmol/
mol), 
unknown), 
diabetes 
complications 
(absent, 
microvascular, macrovascular, combined micro- and 
macrovascular, conditions related to diabetic foot ulcers, 
and previous lower-extremity ulcer diagnosis), and renal 
function before admission (eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) >90, 
60–90, 
 <  60, unknown). We adjusted for m-CCI score, 
alcohol-related conditions, marital status, any statin 
used predating the index date, and use of antibiotics 
within 30 days of the index date. To examine whether 
the risk of SAB differed among subsets of diabetes 
patients, we performed conventional logistic regression 
with additional adjustment for the matching factors and 
stratified the results by sex, age group (15 – 39, 40 – 59, 
60 – 79, 80+ years), and m-CCI level (0, 1 – 2, >2). We 
conducted all analyses using Stata 11.2 for Windows 
(Statacorp). According to Danish legislation, individual 
informed consent is not required for registry-based 
studies. The project was approved by the Danish Data 
Protection Agency (ref. no. 2012-41-0942).

Results
Descriptive data
During 2000 – 2011, we identified 2638 patients with 
incident CA-SAB and 26 379 population controls. The 
subset of all CA-SAB patients with recent preadmission 
contacts to the healthcare system (HCA-SAB) constituted 
42%. MRSA was rarely observed (0.5%). Characteristics of 
cases and controls are given in Table 1. The median age of 
cases and controls was 69 years (interquartile range (IQR), 
56 – 79), and 61% were males. CA-SAB patients were much 
more likely than population controls to have a history of 
hospital-diagnosed comorbidity, in particular congestive 
heart failure (13% vs 4%), peripheral vascular disease (12% 
vs 3%), cancer (20% vs 7%), and renal disease (17% vs 1%). 
Cases were also more likely to have filled prescriptions for 
antibiotics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, 
beta blockers, and acetylsalicylic acid.
Risk of S. aureus bacteremia
A total of 713 (27.0%) CA-SAB patients had diabetes, 
compared with 2495 (9.5%) among population controls 
(Table 2). The unadjusted OR for incident CA-SAB in 
patients with diabetes compared with persons without 
diabetes was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.4 – 4.1), and the adjusted OR 
was 2.8 (2.5 – 3.1) (Table 2). The adjusted OR for CA-SAB 
was 7.2 (95% CI: 3.9 – 13.0) in patients with type 1 
diabetes compared with 2.7 (95% CI: 2.4 – 3.0) in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.
Compared with individuals without diabetes and 
persons with shorter duration of diabetes, patients with 
≥10 years of diabetes history experienced markedly 
increased the risk of CA-SAB (adjusted OR 
= 
3.8 (95% CI: 
3.2 – 4.6)). The risk of CA-SAB rose gradually with suc-
cessive increases in HbA1c levels. Compared with indi-
viduals without diabetes, the adjusted OR was 2.3 (95% 
CI: 1.9 – 2.7) for patients with diabetes and an HbA1c 
level <  7% (<  53 mmol/mol), 3.2 (95% CI: 2.3 – 4.5) 
for patients with diabetes and HbA1c level ≥8 to 
 <  9% 
(≥64 to 
< 75 mmol/mol), and 5.7 (95% CI: 4.2 – 7.7) 
for patients with diabetes and an HbA1c level ≥9% 
(≥75 mmol/mol). Diabetes complications influenced the 
risk of CA-SAB, as compared with persons without dia-
betes. Thus, the adjusted OR was 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0 – 2.7) 
 
in patients with diabetes and no complications, 5.5 (95% 
CI: 4.2 – 7.2) in patients with microvascular complica-
tions, 2.7 (95% CI: 2.2 – 3.3) in patients with macrovas-
cular complications, and 7.0 (95% CI: 5.4 – 9.0) in persons 
with combined macro- and micro-vascular complica-
tions. Increased risk of CA-SAB was also evident among 
patients with diabetes and conditions related to diabetes 
foot ulcers (adjusted OR 
= 
4.9 (95% CI: 3.7 – 6.6)), and 
patients with diabetes and a previous lower-extrem-
ity ulcer or ulcer-related procedure (adjusted OR 
= 
6.9 
(95% CI: 5.4 – 8.8)). Decreased renal function also 
influenced the risk of CA-SAB with an adjusted OR of 
4.2 (95% CI: 3.5 – 5.1) in patients with diabetes and 
 
an eGFR 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with persons 
without diabetes.
Table 3 presents ORs according to diabetes stratified 
by age, sex, and comorbidity level. Female patients with 
diabetes appeared to experience a slightly increased risk 
of CA-SAB compared with males (adjusted ORs 3.2 (95% 
CI: 2.6 – 3.8) and 2.5 (95% CI: 2.2 – 2.9) respectively). The 
relative risk of CA-SAB decreased with advancing age and 
increasing level of comorbidity (Table 3).
Discussion
In this large population-based case–control study, diabetes 
was strongly associated with an increased risk of CA-SAB. 
Compared with patients without diabetes, the excess 
risk of CA-SAB was most pronounced among patients 
with type 1 diabetes, patients with ≥10 years of diabetes 
history, patients with poor glycemic control, and patients 
with diabetes complications, in particular microvascular 
disease. In addition, the relative impact of diabetes was 
most pronounced in younger patients and in patients 
without coexisting morbidities.
Our results extend the limited existing knowledge 
on the risk of CA-SAB in patients with diabetes (11, 12, 
13, 14). In an Italian case–control study of 165 patients 
with SAB, Bassetti et al. (11) observed an OR of 6.21 
(1.62 – 23.77) from diabetes in multivariate analysis. In a 
Canadian surveillance cohort study (12) including 1508 
SAB patients, the authors reported a substantial risk of 
SAB associated with diabetes (relative risk (RR) 
= 
10.6 
(95% CI: 9.3 – 11.9)). In two prior studies (13, 14), the 
investigators assessed diabetes as a risk factor for invasive 
S. aureus infections, defined as the isolation of S. aureus 
from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural or synovial fluid, 
or aseptically obtained deep-tissue aspirates or surgical-
tissue samples. In a Swedish cohort study of 168 patients, 
Jacobsson et al. (14) observed a RR of 8.2 (95% CI: 6 – 12) 
for invasive S. aureus infections in patients with diabetes 
as compared with patients without. This was supported by 
results from a Canadian study cohort (13) (n = 264), where

the investigators observed a considerable risk of invasive 
S. aureus infections in patients with diabetes (RR 
= 
7.0 
(95% CI: 5.0 – 9.7)).
Nevertheless, some limitations should be taken into 
account in the interpretation of these previous results: 
Small and selected study populations (11, 13, 14), lim-
ited numbers of patients with diabetes (11, 13, 14), 
incomparability of characteristics of cases and controls 
(11), or insufficient adjustment for concurrent comorbid 
conditions (12) could partly explain the observations. 
Furthermore, in contrast to our study, none of the pre-
vious studies assessed whether the risk of SAB differed 
according to characteristics of patients with diabetes or 
according to age, sex, and comorbidity level.

Diabetes and risk of S. aureus 
bacteremia
A number of different pathophysiological mecha-
nisms may explain the observed increased risk of CA-SAB 
associated with diabetes. Diabetes and SAB share sev-
eral risk factors including high age and comorbidity (6). 
Adjusting for comorbid conditions attenuated the associ-
ation between diabetes and CA-SAB, suggesting that part 
of the risk associated with diabetes is conveyed by the 
burden of multiple morbidities and concomitant general 
frailty.
In our study, the excess risk of SAB was particu-
larly evident in patients with diabetes complications. 
Decreased skin barriers may allow staphylococci access to 
adjoining tissues (27) or, at the most severe end of the 
spectrum, the blood stream (1, 2). Our findings of high 
ORs associated with diabetic foot ulcers may support this 
mechanism. Moreover, renal disease is a well-known risk 
factor for SAB (28), which may be of particularly impor-
tance in patients with concomitant diabetes, as indicated 
by the OR of 4.2 (95% CI: 3.5 – 5.1) observed in patients 
with an eGFR 
 < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Still, patients with diabetes may most likely experi-
ence increased susceptibility to CA-SAB for reasons other 
than concomitant morbidities including diabetes compli-
cations. Neutrophilic leukocytes constitute the primary 
cellular defense against S. aureus infections, yet chemo-
taxis, adhesion, and intracellular killing are impaired

Clinical Study
J Smit and others
Diabetes and risk of S. aureus 
bacteremia
in patients with diabetes (5, 6, 29). Furthermore, the 
impaired immunological response in patients with diabe-
tes has been shown to be affected by the level of glycemic 
control (30, 31), which is in accordance with our observa-
tions of gradual increases in CA-SAB risk with successive 
increases in Hba1c levels.
The main strengths of our study include its consider-
able size, well-defined study population, and the use of 
routinely recorded clinical data. We excluded patients 
with hospital-acquired SAB, which reduces confounding 
from major invasive procedures and concurrent diseases. 
In contrast to previous studies (11, 12, 13, 14), patients 
with diabetes were identified using a validated algorithm 
(20). Furthermore, we refined our analyses of diabetes as a 
risk factor for SAB by incorporating detailed information 
on various characteristics of patients with diabetes.
Limitations include the possibility that physicians 
may be more likely to admit patients with diabetes on 
suspicion of infection compared with patients without 
diabetes. Such surveillance bias would prompt an overes-
timation of the relative risk associated with SAB. However, 
previous studies from our setting (32, 33) assessing the 
risk of pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia, respec-
tively, demonstrated that preadmission antibiotic treat-
ment, microbiological results, levels of inflammatory 
markers on admission, and proportion of patients with at 
least one blood culture were comparable among patients 
with and without diabetes. This suggests that there was 
no substantial bias associated with the management of 
patients with diabetes. Although our ascertainment of dia-
betes was based on three separate population-based regis-
tries, some persons with diabetes may have been missed, 
which would bias our results toward unity. Diabetic foot 
ulcers were not coded consistently with unique diagnostic 
codes during the study period. Thus, we used conditions 
related to foot ulcers and previous lower-extremity ulcer 
diagnoses, which might represent somewhat crude prox-
ies. Nevertheless, both variables indicated a substantially 
increased risk of CA-SAB associated with diabetic foot 
ulcers, and we find it unlikely that misclassification alone 
could explain risk estimates of this magnitude. Finally, 
we lacked data to adjust for smoking and body mass 
index, which constitute a considerable limitation of the 
study. Still, these factors may be partly accounted for by 
the adjustment for lifestyle-related comorbidities in our 
analyses.
The low prevalence of MRSA in the study area ensured 
a clean focus on MSSA, but our results may not be directly 
applicable to settings with higher MRSA prevalence. Still, 
the results from our study may most likely be generaliz-
able to other healthcare systems with equal access to 
healthcare and prescription medication including anti 
diabetes therapy.
In conclusion, persons with diabetes experienced an 
almost threefold increased risk of CA-SAB compared with 
persons without diabetes. Long diabetes duration, subopti-
mal glycemic control, and diabetes complications includ-
ing renal disease further increased the risk of CA-SAB. 
These results emphasize the importance of improved 
preventive care for patients with diabetes, including opti-
mized glycemic control, and particularly good infection 
surveillance among patients with long duration of diabe-
tes and complications.
