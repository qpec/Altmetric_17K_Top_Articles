Background-—Prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is significantly higher among blacks as compared with non-Hispanic
whites, but the role of cigarette smoking in PAD is understudied in blacks. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette
smoking and PAD in blacks in the (JHS) Jackson Heart Study.
Methods and Results-—JHS participants (n=5306) were classified by self-reported baseline smoking status into current, past
(smoked at least 400 cigarettes/life), or never smokers. We examined multivariable logistic and robust linear regression models to
estimate the associations between baseline smoking status, smoking intensity, and measures of subclinical PAD (ankle-brachial
index [visit 1] and aortic calcium by computed tomography [visit 2]) to yield odds ratios and b-coefficients (estimated adjusted
difference) to compare each smoking status with never smokers (reference group). There were 3579 (68%) never smokers, 986
(19%) past smokers, and 693 (13%) current smokers self-identified at baseline. After adjustment for covariates, current smokers
had increased risk of ankle-brachial index <1 (odds ratio, 2.2, 95% CI, 1.5–3.3) and increased risk of abdominal aortic (odds ratio,
8.4, 95% CI, 5.8–12.0) and aortoiliac calcium (odds ratio, 9.6, 95% CI, 6.7–13.7). When stratifying by smoking intensity, those
smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily (1 pack) had higher likelihood of subclinical PAD by all of these measures compared with
lower-intensity use, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship.
Conclusions-—In a large black cohort, cigarette smoking was associated with measures of subclinical PAD in a dose-dependent
manner. These findings highlight the association between smoking and PAD in blacks and support further research exploring the
impact of interventions on smoking cessation to reduce PAD in this population. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e010674. DOI:

P
eripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with
increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1 Cigar-
ette smoking is a powerful predictor for the development of
PAD with a magnitude of association even greater than that
reported for coronary heart disease.2 PAD is nearly 3 times
more prevalent in blacks as compared with non-Hispanic
whites.1 However, ethnic-specific cohort data indicate that
blacks have less atherosclerosis in the thoracic and abdom-
inal aorta,3,4 suggesting the potential for differential PAD
phenotypes. There are limited data directly assessing the
association of cigarette smoking on PAD in blacks.5
Better understanding the association of smoking and PAD
in blacks is important for several reasons. Increasing knowl-
edge on the impact of cigarette smoking and PAD may
improve public health campaigns raising awareness of
adverse effects associated with tobacco. This is particularly
important in the black community, which is more aggressively
targeted by the tobacco industry.6 Although the burden of

 PAD is significantly higher among blacks, the specific impact
of smoking has not been well delineated beyond other risk
factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obe-
sity. Public policy and clinical interventions to improve PAD
outcomes in this population must rely on robust epidemio-
logical research supporting such interventions. The objective
of our study was to evaluate the relationship between
cigarette smoking and smoking intensity with measures of
subclinical PAD in the JHS (Jackson Heart Study), a large black
cohort.
Methods
The data, analytical methods, and study materials are
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing
the results or replicating the procedure by following the JHS
publications procedures and data use agreements.
Study Population
The JHS is a large, prospective cohort study of cardiovascular
disease in blacks and includes 5306 participants aged 21 to
84 years at baseline. Participants were recruited from the
tricounty area surrounding Jackson, Mississippi, and were
evaluated at baseline from 2000 to 2004. Data from visit 2
(2005–2008), including computed tomography (CT) measures
of aortic and aortoiliac calcium, were also utilized. We
included participants who completed Exam 1 and participated
in the substudy undergoing the CT protocol in Exam 2. The
study was approved by the institutional review boards of the
University of Mississippi Medical Center, Tougaloo College,
and Jackson State University. Each participant provided
written informed consent.
The baseline examination (V1) included a home interview,
self-administered questionnaires, and a clinic visit that
included blood and urine collection. Each participant was
asked to fast overnight before the clinic visit at which blood
pressure
(BP)
and
anthropometric
measurements
were
obtained. Blood and urine samples were collected according
to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory standards,
as reported previously.7
Study Variables
Cigarette smoking status was obtained via questionnaire at
V1. Participants who smoked >400 cigarettes in their lifetime
were defined as ever smokers. Participants who gave a
positive response to the question, “Do you now smoke
cigarettes?” were classified as current smokers. Those who
responded negatively to these questions were classified as
never smokers. Participants who were classified as ever
smokers who no longer smoked at the time of the examina-
tion were classified as past smokers. Further information
related to number of cigarettes smoked daily was collected.
To determine smoking burden (pack-years), the number of
cigarettes smoked daily was multiplied by number of years
smoked. Age, sex, and anthropometric data, such as body
mass index, were recorded at the baseline examination.
Hypertension was defined as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg or use of
BP-lowering medication, and diabetes mellitus was defined as
fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, or
use of diabetes mellitus medications within 2 weeks before
the clinic visit.7 In addition, total cholesterol was measured
from plasma with the use of a cholesterol oxidase method
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) on a Roche COBAS FARA
centrifugal analyzer.
Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured at V1. To
determine ABI, ankle and brachial systolic BP were measured
by trained technicians using a sphygmomanometer along with
an Ultrasonic Doppler Flow Detector (Model 811-B; Parks
Medical Electronic-Inc, Aloha, OR). Technicians followed a
standard protocol, using a contour wrapping technique with
the midpoint of the bladder over the posterior tibial artery; the
lower end of the bladder �3 cm above the medial malleolus.
Bilateral systolic BP measurements were taken with ultra-
sound measurement of the posterior tibial artery while the
participant was in the supine position. The dorsalis pedis
artery was used for measurement if the posterior tibial pulse
could not be found by palpation or by Doppler pen probe.
Measurements of the brachial systolic BP, usually in the right
brachial, were taken twice. The first brachial measurement
was made before leg measurements, and the second
measurement was made after the leg measurements were
completed. Two ABIs (1 for the right leg and 1 for the left leg)
were calculated as the average of the 2 ankle systolic BP
measurements divided by the average of the 2 brachial
readings. The lower of the 2 ABIs were considered the
participants’ ABI for the current study.8
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The role of cigarette smoking in peripheral artery disease
among blacks has not been well studied.
• In the JHS (Jackson Heart Study), a large black cohort,
cigarette smoking was associated with measures of periph-
eral artery disease in a dose-dependent manner.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• These findings support the evaluation of smoking-cessation
efforts to reduce the impact of peripheral artery disease in
this population.

 Abdominal aortic calcification was measured at visit 2
among 2398 participants. The research CT protocol included
the heart and lower abdomen using a 16-channel multidetec-
tor CT system equipped with cardiac gating (Lightspeed 16
Pro; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). An effective dose was
calculated for the abdominal scan used in the FHS-SCAN
(Framingham Heart Study/Subclinical Atherosclerosis Net-
work) and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis)
studies of 2.7 mSv for both women and men is noted
because neither sex’s gonads are directly irradiated. Scanning
took place at the JHS CT Data Acquisition Center located at
the Jackson Medical Mall (Jackson, MS). Quality-control and
image analysis were performed at a core reading center
(Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem,
NC). The protocol included scout images, 1 ECG-gated series
of the entire heart, and a series through the lower abdomen
from L3 to S1. Abdominal aortic calcification was quantified
utilizing Agatston scoring, modified to account for slice
thickness. Calcified artery plaque was computed by multiply-
ing each lesion by a weighted attenuation score on a
TeraRecon Aquarius Workstation (TeraRecon, San Mateo,
CA); scoring was in Hounsfeld units. Presence of abdominal
aortic calcification was defined as Agatston score >0;
reproducibility in scoring was 0.99.
Based on previous published data, subclinical PAD is
defined as ABI <1 or >1.4 and no history of clinical PAD
symptoms (claudication, peripheral artery surgery, or ampu-
tation attributed to PAD).9,10 Subclincal PAD is also defined
as the presence of abdominal aortic calcification, which has
been associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause
mortality.11
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean with SDs for continuous variables
and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables.
Relationships between smoking status (current, former, or
never), intensity among current smokers (cigarettes per day),
and burden among ever smokers (pack-years) with measures
of subclinical PAD (ABI and abdominal aortic calcification)
were assessed using robust linear and logistic regression
analyses. Based on past research and knowledge of clinically
significant factors associated with cardiovascular disease,
models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus status, total cholesterol,
triglycerides, self-reported prevalent cardiovascular disease,
physical activity, alcohol consumption in the past 12 months,
and level of education. These adjusted associations were
expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and b-coefficients (estimated
adjusted differences) to compare each smoking status with
never smokers (reference group). All statistical analyses were
performed with STATA software (version 14; StataCorp LP,

 College Station, TX). A 2-sided P<0.05 was considered
significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics and measures of subclinical PAD are
presented by smoking status in Table 1. In our analysis
including 5258 participants (99% of overall cohort) without
missing covariates, 3579 (68%) participants were never
smokers, 986 (19%) were past smokers, and 693 (13%) were
current smokers. Participants who were past or current
smokers were more likely to be men and have prevalent
cardiovascular disease. On average, all groups had high mean
body mass indices (≥30 kg/m2), low levels of physical
activity, and less than a high school education. Current
smokers were more likely to consume alcohol. Past smokers
were more likely to be older and have associated hyperten-
sion and diabetes mellitus. As compared with never smokers,
past smokers and current smokers had lower ABI and higher
infrarenal and aortoiliac Agatston scores.
After adjustment for covariates, past smokers were
significantly more likely to have ABI <1, infrarenal abdominal
aorta Agatston score >75th percentile, and aortoiliac Agat-
ston score >75th percentile. As compared with never
smokers, current smokers and past smokers had significantly
higher mean subclinical PAD measurements, with a greater
degree of association among current smokers. Among current
smokers, the highest degree of association with subclinical
PAD was observed among those smoking ≥20 cigarettes (1
pack) per day and those with higher total pack-year smoking
history. Associations between cigarette smoking and mea-
sures of subclinical PAD are presented in Table 2.
Discussion
In our community-based black cohort, 13% of participants
were current smokers and 19% were past smokers. After risk
adjustment, current smokers had 2.2 times the likelihood of
subclinical lower-extremity PAD and >8 times the likelihood of
a high aortic calcium burden. Among current smokers, there
was a dose-dependent response whereby those smoking ≥20
cigarettes per day and higher pack-year smoking exposure
demonstrated considerably higher odds of subclinical PAD
compared with those smoking 1 to 19 cigarettes per day.
A major finding of this study was the high degree of
association between cigarette smoking, smoking intensity,
and measures of subclinical PAD in the JHS cohort. In past
reports, prevalence of PAD was significantly higher among
blacks as compared with other racial groups, which parallels
higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.12
Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for PAD,
but the impact of smoking on PAD has been less thoroughly

 investigated in blacks. Previous studies were limited to
cohorts with smaller numbers of blacks, generally utilizing
only ABI and adjusting for smoking as one of many
covariates.13,14 The current study is among the largest
analyses in blacks utilizing multiple measures of subclinical
PAD, all stratified by smoking status and intensity.
The results of our analysis support clinical efforts and
policy initiatives aimed at tobacco control. As compared with
never smokers, current smokers and past smokers had higher
odds of subclinical PAD, although the odds were comparably
lower among past smokers than current smokers. Our
findings highlight both the importance of smoking cessation
as well as prevention of smoking initiation. These data are
particularly important given historical differences in tobacco
marketing based on race, given that blacks are more
aggressively targeted by cigarette advertising.6 PAD and its
associated morbidity, including claudication, exercise intoler-
ance, decreased quality of life, infection, and amputation,
should be included in antismoking campaigns targeting the
black community. These additional messaging points are
complementary to the often-cited health effects of smoking
on heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Furthermore, our data
support further research evaluating the efficacy of tobacco
control policy intervention, such as cigarette pricing increase,
which have been shown to be highly effective at reducing
smoking prevalence rates.15
In our analysis, there was a particularly strong association
between smoking and abdominal aorta and aortoiliac calcium
burden. These findings support the large body of clinical and
epidemiological data identifying smoking as a dominant risk
factor for abdominal aortic calcification.16,17 Predilection for
abdominal aortic pathology in smokers remains to be fully
elucidated, but current evidence suggests multiple environ-
mental, genetic, and epigenetic factors.18 Chronic inflamma-
tory infiltration and smooth muscle changes are thought to
contribute.19 Past work from the MESA Study demonstrated
that blacks, compared with whites, have less calcification of
the thoracic and abdominal aorta after accounting for
cardiovascular disease risk factors.3,4 Previous findings from
the JHS demonstrated an independent association with
smoking and progressive decline in renal function.20 In the
current analysis, the high burden of infrarenal aortic calcium
among smokers may suggest concomitant renovascular
atherosclerosis, potentially mechanistically linking smoking
and progressive renal function decline. This hypothesis and
the relationships between smoking, PAD, and chronic kidney
disease warrant further investigation.
The current study has several limitations that warrant
consideration. Our analysis is cross-sectional in design as
smoking status and ABI measurement were obtained at V1.
There is a 5.5-year mean delay between baseline determina-
tion of smoking status at V1 and the CT evaluation at visit 2.
Despite strong associations between smoking status and
measures of PAD, direction of causality cannot be inferred
and we cannot exclude residual confounding.8 The JHS was
conducted in a single community of blacks. We are limited in
our ability to generalize to individuals of African ancestry from
other regions or countries, and to compare with other races/
ethnicities. Cigarette smoking assessment was obtained by
self-report; cotinine levels and type of cigarette smoked were
not available for analysis. Recall bias may also contribute to
inaccuracies in smoking classification. However, validity of
self-reported smoking is consistently high in population-based
studies.21 The self-reported use of other tobacco products in
the JHS was low (0.6% dip/snuff, 0.3% pipe smokers, and 1.1%
cigars), but we cannot exclude effects related to unreported
tobacco use. JHS does not capture data related to second-
and third-hand smoke; therefore, potential differences in
these factors are not accounted for between groups. Also, the
participants with available data at baseline who underwent CT
measures represented a convenient sample of the cohort at
baseline (n=2398/5306) and may have resulted in selection
of a group in which the magnitude of the associations of
smoking with PAD differed from what might have been
observed if CT measures were available in the entire cohort.
In conclusion, in a large black cohort, we observed a strong
and dose-dependent association between cigarette smoking
and measures of subclinical PAD. There is a particularly strong
association between smoking and abdominal aorta and
aortoiliac calcification. These data provide further evidence
of the deleterious health effects of smoking in blacks and
support further research exploring the impact of interventions
on smoking cessation to reduce PAD in this population.
