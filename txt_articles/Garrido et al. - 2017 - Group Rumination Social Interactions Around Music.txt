One of the most important roles that music serves in human society is the promotion
of social relationships and group cohesion. In general, emotional experiences tend to
be amplified in group settings through processes of social feedback. However, previous
research has established that listening to sad music can intensify negative emotions in
people with tendencies to rumination and depression. This study therefore investigated
the phenomenon of ruminating with music, and the question of whether listening to sad
music in group settings provides social benefits for emotionally vulnerable listeners, or
whether it further exaggerates depressive tendencies. Participants recruited via online
depression groups and mental health websites were surveyed as to music listening
habits. Results revealed that people with depression were more likely to engage in “group
rumination” using music, and that this behavior could be partially explained by a general
tendency to ruminate using music. Both affective states and coping styles were found to
be related to the affective outcomes of group interactions around music. These findings
go some way toward clarifying the situations in which group interactions around music
are able to provide important social benefits for those involved, and situations in which
negative emotions can be amplified by the group context.

INTRODUCTION
Emotions serve adaptive social functions, including assisting individuals to create and sustain
relationships, and to establish or preserve their place within the social hierarchies of a group
(Fischer and Greitmeyer, 2006). Positive emotions particularly, serve so as to cement social bonds
within a group. However, demonstrations of negative emotions like crying, tend to signal weakness
and the need for social support (Balsters et al., 2013). Such displays of vulnerability can diminish
one’s social standing within a group. However, people in close relationships are more likely to
respond to displays of negative emotions with offers of support. Thus people tend to cry more
often in the presence of intimates than in public situations (Vingerhoets and Becht, 1997). Higher
mood improvements from crying are reported where such support is received (Bylsma et al., 2011),
suggesting that the social context in which crying occurs has an influence on the psychological effect
experienced.
In much the same way that expressions of emotion strengthen social bonds, music also bolsters
social relationships throughout the lifespan. In the early years, musical rituals consolidate parental-
infant bonds (Trehub and Trainor, 1998). Music also creates and strengthens interpersonal
relations between peers among adolescents and young adults because of the signals that
one’s taste in music gives about shared values (Boer et al., 2011). Music is thus used as an
 Garrido et al.
Group Rumination in People with Depression
“identity badge” (Frith, 1981; Tarrant et al., 2001), and in the
formation of friendships (Selfhout et al., 2009).
The act of creating or enjoying music alongside other
individuals similarly has an impact on social relationships.
Evidence suggests that when members of a group synchronize
to a beat, this influences their behavior toward both individuals
within the group and those perceived as being outside it.
Kirschner and Tomasello (2010), for example, found that 4-year
olds who synchronized movements and playing of percussion
instruments in a group activity were more likely to exhibit
cooperative and helpful behaviors afterwards compared to a
control group that did no musical activities. Similar effects on
prosocial behaviors and group affiliations have been found in
both children and adults after activities involving coordinating
their movements to a simple rhythm (Hove and Risen, 2009;
Cirelli et al., 2014).
Since both the sharing of emotions and the sharing of
music provide similar social benefits, it could be presumed that
situations in which individuals share emotional experiences with
music with others, are an especially powerful form of social
bonding. In fact, evidence suggests that emotional experiences
with music are amplified in group-settings. Emotional contagion
is believed to take place through processes of unconscious motor
mimicry which cause individuals to experience parallel emotions
to those perceived in other people (Hatfield et al., 2011). Social
facilitation theory also suggests that arousal levels increase in
the presence of others (Zajonc and Sales, 1966). Thus, the most
powerful emotional experiences in response to music often occur
at live events where other people are present (Lamont, 2009),
a phenomenon also observed in movie theaters (Coplan, 2006).
This emotional amplification is believed to take place through
processes of social feedback (Egermann et al., 2013).
Given the role of crying in gaining social support, the question
thus arises as to whether the sharing of sad music in group
contexts holds similar benefits for members of the group. The
potential for emotional responses to be intensified in group
settings is of particular interest when considering music that
evokes negative emotions. In fact, entire musical subcultures such
as “goth” or “emo” are focused on music with dark and depressing
themes. Such music has taken the blame in cases of suicide, such
as the double suicide in 2007 of two teenage girls in Australia who
had made multiple posts on social media about music that echoed
their negative views of the world (Young et al., 2014).
In fact, previous research has demonstrated that listening to
music that is perceived as sad can intensify depression in listeners
with ruminative tendencies (Garrido and Schubert, 2015a,b), and
that people with depressive tendencies may struggle to regulate
their emotional responses in musical contexts (McFerran, 2016).
Since group settings and social feedback can intensify the
emotions experienced in response to music, the possibility
exists that group interactions around sad music could have an
even more dangerous outcome for people with tendencies to
depression. Rose (2002) described the extensive discussion and
revisiting of problems among friends as “co-rumination,” and the
term has also been applied to group interactions about music
that focus on personal problems and negative thoughts (Miranda
et al., 2012). The combination of music that focuses on depressing
themes along with excessive listening and discussion of such
music in a kind of “group rumination” may be a particularly
detrimental mix for vulnerable individuals.
On the other hand, it may be possible that the sharing of
emotions via music listening in group settings provides depressed
individuals with needed social support and enhances their sense
of connection with other individuals. In general, “reflection” as
distinct from rumination, provides a useful psychological tool
for processing negative emotions (Trapnell and Campbell, 1999),
and it could be that similar processes are also occurring in
group interactions around music. It may be that individuals with
adaptive coping strategies such as reflectiveness or the seeking
of social support, may use group interactions around music in
positive ways so as to gain important support or to help them
process negative emotions. Thus the questions of how social
settings influence the affective outcomes of listening to music and
how this is related to coping style, are important ones to consider
in exploring the relationship between music and mental health
and wellbeing. The aims of the current study are, therefore:
1. To investigate the self-reported mood effects of listening to sad
music in group settings.
2. To investigate the influence of rumination, depression, and
coping style on the mood effects reported.
HYPOTHESES
H1: People with depression will tend to ruminate with music
during general listening and engage in “group rumination”
more than others.
H2: The relationship between depression and group rumination
will be mediated by a general tendency to ruminate using music.
H3: People with adaptive coping styles will experience positive
mood effects from listening to their self-selected music when sad.
H4: People with adaptive coping styles will be more likely to use
music in positive ways in group settings.
METHODS
Participants
After obtaining ethics approval from the relevant boards at
both the University of Melbourne and Durham University, 697
participants were recruited via advertisements on mental health
and depression websites in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S,
including 196 males and 501 females. Similar gender imbalances
are often found in studies relating to mental health issues such as
depression (see for e.g., Lindner et al., 2016), and likely reflect the
higher incidence of depression in females than males (Freeman
and Freeman, 2013). Participants ranged in age from 16 to 74
years of age (m = 24.9, SD = 11) and were mostly from the U.S.
(72.3%), Australia (10.3%), and the U.K. (5.2%), with 12.2% being
from a number of other countries in South America, Africa, Asia,
and Europe.

Group Rumination in People with Depression
Procedure
Participants completed an online survey in their own time in
which they were asked a number of questions relating to their
ways of using music, types of musical engagement and the effect
of music listening (see Appendix). They were also asked to
nominate a song that they would listen to when feeling sad.
Measures
Participants completed the short form of the Depression-
Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21; Henry and Crawford, 2005).
The DASS-21 is a 21-item questionnaire in which participants
indicate the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and
stress in the past week. Items are scored on a scale of 0 (did not
apply to me at all over the last week) to 3 (applied to me very
much or most of the time over the past week). In the current study
Cronbach’s alpha scores were 0.93 (Depression), 0.88 (Stress), and
0.87 (Anxiety).
In
addition
to
measuring
current
symptoms,
general
tendencies to depression were measured using the Rumination
Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ; Trapnell and Campbell, 1999).
The RRQ was designed to distinguish between a maladaptive
focus
on
negative
thoughts
(rumination)
and
healthier
tendencies
to
self-reflection
(reflectiveness).
Rumination
generally, is highly predictive of depression (Nolen-Hoeksema
and Morrow, 1993). Since the items in the rumination subscale
measure long-term coping styles, the scale is indicative of
tendencies to depression rather than the presence of a depressive
episode. In the current study reliability estimates were 0.91 and
0.88 for the rumination and reflectiveness subscales respectively
(Cronbach’s alpha).
The Healthy Uses of Music Scale (HUMS) (Saarikallio
et al., 2015) was also included, a scale developed to assess
musical engagement as an indicator of wellbeing. The HUMS
consists of 13 items of which five measure healthy and
eight measure unhealthy dimensions of musical engagement.
Reliability estimates in the current study were 0.77 for the healthy
subscale, and 0.83 for the unhealthy subscale.
Participants also completed 23 items designed by the authors
to examine various aspects of music listening both in solitary and
in group situations (see Appendix). These items included 3 items
relating to some of the reasons that people frequently give for
listening to sad music (Garrido and Schubert, 2013), and 3 items
relating to the emotional reactions people may be seeking with
their preferred music listening choices. A further 13 items were
designed to explore how people interact with music when with
friends, and the effects of listening to music both alone and with
others, while an additional item specifically focused on the mood
effects achieved when listening to self-selected music when sad
(Appendix: “Mood Effect”). In addition we also included items
relating to the frequency with which people listen to music alone,
their use of chat rooms or blogs to talk about music with others,
and how much they focus on the lyrics when listening to music.
Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0. Since lyrics
are known to have an important impact on the effect of music
listening (Peynircio˘
glu and Ali, 2006), an examination of lyrical
content was included using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC; Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010). This software calculates
percentages of word categories used in the text including affect
words, and use of words relating to specific topics such as
motion or death. This method has previously been used to
predict coping style (Pennebaker et al., 1997), trauma recovery
rates (Pennebaker, 1993), and social integration (Pennebaker and
Graybeal, 2001). In particular, given the relationship between
self- (Watkins and Teasdale, 2004) and past-focused thinking
(Garrido, in press) in the literature with depression, we focused
on lyrics relating to the self or the past, and lyrics expressing
negative emotions.
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
A principal component analysis (with varimax rotation) was
conducted on items relating to group music listening. The items
loaded consistently onto two factors (Table 1), one describing
positive group interactions around music (36.7% of variance),
which was labeled “Positive Group Listening,” and the other
describing negative group interactions around music (32.6% of
variance) which was labeled “Negative Group Listening.”
Sub-scales were created using the items that loaded most
strongly onto each factor with the Positive and Negative
Group Listening subscales returning reliability scores of 0.807
(Cronbach’s alpha) and 0.813 respectively. The loading of items
in the Negative Group Listening subscale suggests a construct
that could be understood to assess “group rumination,” since it

Group Rumination in People with Depression
involves talking about sad things and listening to sad songs with
friends, as well as increased depression from group interactions
around music. On the other hand, the Positive Group Listening
subscale involves social interactions involving music that result
in positive mood outcomes.
A principal component analysis (varimax rotation) was also
conducted on items relating to the use of music to either ruminate
or reflect. Again, items loaded consistently onto two factors
(Table 2), with the exception of one item (Fav02). The first factor
was labeled “Ruminating with Music” and explained 25.9% of the
variance in responses. The second factor was labeled “Reflecting
with Music” and explained 23.8% of the variance.
Subscales were created using the items that loaded most
strongly on each factor, omitting Fav02. The Ruminating with
Music subscale returned a reliability score of 0.710 and the
Reflecting with Music subscale returning a score of 0.630
(Cronbach’s alphas). The latter scale was omitted from further
analysis given the relatively low reliability score. The former
scale assesses the use of music to bring back sad memories and
intensify negative thoughts and affect.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated in order
to explore associations between the scale scores (see Table 3).
Ruminating with music was associated with Negative Group
Listening as well as with the HUMS Unhealthy subscale and
the DASS subscales. It was also negatively correlated with Mood
Effect, suggesting that people with high tendencies to ruminate
with music were unlikely to experience positive outcomes from
listening to their self-selected music when feeling sad. Negative
Group listening correlated with the HUMS Unhealthy, and
Positive Group listening correlated with the HUMS Healthy (in
support of the second hypothesis) In addition, Mood Effect was
positively correlated with the HUMS Healthy suggesting that
positive mood effects from listening to music are related to the
mood regulation strategies being utilized (in support of the third
hypothesis). Results also indicated that a reverse relationship
existed between age and Positive Group Listening scores
Depression and Ruminating with Music
As a test of the first hypothesis, participants were grouped
according to scores on the DASS Depression subscale based on
the cut-off points indicated by the Manual for the Depression
Anxiety Stress Scales (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995). Around
49% of participants in the study reported normal levels of
depression, at the time they completed the survey with 51% of
participants showing mild to severe levels of depression on this
scale.
A MANOVA was conducted with Depression Group as
the fixed factor, returning a significant main effect F(5, 608) =
24.3, p < 0.001, partial-eta squared = 0.1. Follow-up ANOVAs
indicated significant differences between groups on Negative
Group Listening F(1, 612) = 45.9, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.6;
Ruminating with Music F(1, 612) = 86.0, p < 0.001, Cohen’s
d = 0.8; listening to music alone (Item A1) F(1, 612) = 13.5, p <
0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.3; and the use of chat rooms and blogs (Item
A2) F(1, 612) = 11.8, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.3, with the Mild to
Severe Depression group (n = 313) experiencing higher scores
than the Normal Depression group (n = 301) on all of these
variables. In contrast, the Normal Depression group reported
significantly higher (more positive) F(1, 612) = 25.7, p < 0.001
effects of listening to their self-selected music when sad than
those with higher levels of depression. These results support the
first hypothesis in that people with mild to severe depression
were more likely to engage in Negative Group Listening and in
ruminating with music generally than those with normal levels
of depression. They also suggest that people with normal levels
of depression are more likely to benefit from listening to music
when sad in support of the third hypothesis.
To further explore the relationship between depression
and group rumination, a mediation model was tested using
bootstrapping methods outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2004)
(Figure 1). In this model Ruminating with Music was proposed
as a mediator between Depression and Negative Group Listening.
Since the lyrical content of the music and the degree to which
the listener focuses on lyrics could also be possible influences on
the model (Stratton and Zalanowski, 1994), item A3 (Appendix)
and the LIWC output for negative emotions in the lyrics were
also included in the model. Age was also included based on
the suggestion in our previous analysis that age was inversely
correlated to positive group listening. Results based on 5,000
bootstrapped samples confirmed the role of Ruminating with
music in the relationship between depression and Negative
Group Listening, with an unstandardized indirect effect of B =

0.14 CI (95%) 0.10 to 0.20 (p < 0.05). No other variable in the
model had a significant effect. The direct effect of Depression on
Negative Group Listening, while still significant [B = 0.13, t(359)
= 3.3, p < 0.001), dropped when controlling for Ruminating with
Music, indicating partial mediation.
Adaptive Coping Styles and Music Use
A regression analysis was then conducted in order to compare
the factors that might be predictive of positive mood outcomes
when listening to self-selected sad music. The regression analysis
tested the third hypothesis using Mood Effects as the dependent
variable and using the enter method with criterion of F to
enter <= 0.05 and probability of F to remove of > = 0.10. As
shown in Table 4, the variables that made a statistically significant
contribution to the model (at p = 0.05) were the HUMS Healthy
subscale, and Negative Group listening, while Ruminating with
music,), Depression, Anxiety, rumination, and the use of “I”
words in the lyrics were inversely predictive of positive mood
effects. The model explained 22% of the model variance (adjusted
R2). This supported the third hypothesis, demonstrating that
adaptive coping styles were predictive of experiencing positive
mood outcomes from music listening when sad.
A further regression analysis was then conducted in order to
test the fourth hypothesis that people with adaptive coping styles
would use music in uplifting or positive ways in group settings.
Positive Group Listening was the dependent variable, and the
enter method was used with criterion of F to enter <= 0.05 and
probability of F to remove of > = 0.10. Table 5 demonstrates
that statistically significant contributions to the model were
Ruminating with Music, DASS Anxiety and the HUMS Healthy
subscale. Predictors with an inverse relationship to the dependent
variable were Rumination and DASS Depression. The strong
result regarding the HUMS Healthy subscale supports the
fourth hypothesis, in that adaptive coping styles were seen to
be predictive of Positive Group Listening. Interestingly, while
Depression was inversely predictive of Positive Group Listening,
Anxiety was a positive predictor, suggesting that people with
Anxiety may benefit more from group interactions with music
as opposed to people with Depression.
DISCUSSION
The results suggested two distinct patterns of behavior involving
group music listening: (i) listening to sad music and talking about
sad things—a form of group rumination—and (2) listening to
inspiring music and discussing music and life more generally.
Items relating to the former construct aligned with the item
indicating feeling more depressed after listening to music with
friends, while positive interactions with music loaded onto the
same factor as the item indicating that listening to music with
friends felt good. This suggests that both types of behavior have
distinct outcomes. Correlation analyses also confirmed that the
two types of group interactions (positive and negative) were
associated with either healthy or unhealthy ways of using music
respectively.
Similarly, items relating to ruminating with music loaded
clearly together as did items relating more closely to Trapnell
and Campbell’s (1999) dimension of reflection, suggesting again,
that behaviors relating to music use fall into distinct patterns,
reflecting either healthy or unhealthy thought processes. Negative

group interactions around music also tended to occur more often
in younger participants, likely reflecting the relative importance
of both music and social relationships to younger people
(McFerran et al., 2014).
The results also reveal important information about the use
of music by people with depression. People with depression in
our sample reported listening to music alone more than people
with normal levels of depression. This is not surprising given
that social withdrawal is generally associated with anxiety and
depression (Rubin and Coplan, 2010). They were also more likely
to use online chat rooms and blogs relating to music than other
participants, in harmony with studies suggesting increased media
use in people with depression (Block et al., 2014). However,
negative group interactions around music were also higher in
the depressed group than in those with no depression, and were
higher in those who tended to ruminate with music generally.
Thus, while depressed individuals may often seek solitude, when
social interactions around music occur these may often be
ruminative in nature and result in negative outcomes. The fact
that the relationship between Depression and Negative Group
listening was mediated by Ruminating with Music suggests that
these negative outcomes are influenced by a tendency to use
music for ruminative purposes.
Interestingly, regression analyses suggested that while this is
so for people with depression, for people with anxiety, group
interactions about music may tend to be more positive, even
where such individuals have a tendency to ruminate with music.
Such positive outcomes were strongly predicted by scores on the
HUMS Healthy subscale. This scale assesses behaviors such as
using music to connect with other people and to relax. Thus,
it may be that people with anxiety who tend to use music
ruminatively when alone may actually benefit from the social
connections that music gives them.
Healthy uses of music were also associated with positive
effects from listening to self-selected music when sad other
than in group contexts. Another predictor of positive effects
was Negative Group listening. While the inclusion of group
rumination as a predictor of positive mood effects was surprising,
it perhaps suggests that people who find group interactions
around music to have negative effects may find listening to music

Group Rumination in People with Depression
alone more beneficial if healthy listening strategies are being
employed. Conversely, listening alone to self-focused music in
the context of ruminative behavior appears to be inversely related
to positive mood outcomes. Thus, the effect of group music
listening appears to be very much related to the coping style being
used, rather than to whether people listen to music alone or in
groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study has demonstrated that the outcomes of both
solitary and group music listening are related to the thinking
patterns and coping styles being employed in both settings.
People with generally maladaptive coping styles tend to report
negative outcomes from both listening to music alone and from
group interactions around music. It appears that this occurs
because such people are more likely to engage in ruminating with
music - using music both to intensify negative affect and to focus
on negative thoughts and memories.
Young people with depression may be particularly vulnerable
to the impacts of group rumination. While young people with
tendencies to depression who are a part of social groups may be
perceived as receiving valuable social support, our results here
suggest that the positive impacts of such group interactions are
reliant on the types of processes occurring in the group. Thus it
seems that strong social links—something that usually protects
against depression—can, in ruminators, lead to an increased
focus on negative emotions resulting in increased depression in
at risk individuals.
Music can facilitate the sharing of negative emotions. Where
this occurs within a group of distressed individuals, it seems
that group rumination by listening to depressing music and
focusing on negative thoughts and events, can tend to amplify
and nourish the maladaptive thought patterns implicit in the
group, with potentially dangerous results (Garrido, 2017). The
actual outcomes from this kind of sharing of emotions around
music may be dependent on the dominant affective responses
and thinking patterns of the individuals in the group. While
this was not directly measured in this study, the research
presented here suggests that neither certain genres of music
themselves nor the sub-cultures associated with them, can
be blamed for situations in which music appears to have
played a role in youth suicides. However, susceptible individuals
with a predilection for rumination may be most likely to
suffer negative outcomes from group rumination, with social
feedback deepening and exacerbating negative thoughts and
feelings. Where group interactions provide social support or
opportunities for cognitive reframing and processing of emotions
such as where such group discussions are carefully facilitated by
a therapist, the effects are more likely to be positive (Zhou et al.,
2015).
Thus,
these
findings
have
important
implications
for
addressing depression in young people and in understanding
social interactions around music in vulnerable individuals. The
study is limited by its basis on cross-sectional data. Thus it cannot
be assumed that the same results would be found in a longitudinal
study or that the direction of the relationship between depression
and group rumination is clearly established. While the current
study tested the idea that people with depression were more likely
to engage in group rumination and to experience negative mood
outcomes from such group interactions, future research should
aim to assess causal relationships more clearly in experimental
settings. Furthermore, despite the fact that some of the group
reported low scores in depression, participants were recruited
through mental health websites and discussion boards related
to depression. Many participants who did not report current
depression may not be completely removed from behavior
common in depression. Thus, further study will also be required
to clarify how the dynamics of group interactions influence
mood outcomes and whether the impact of group rumination
is likely to be more or less dangerous than solitary forms of
rumination, comparing people with depression to a healthy
control group.

Committee at Durham University, UK. The research was
conducted by means of an online survey. The opening page
of the survey outlined the purpose and details of the study
and participants were advised that if they clicked “Next” to
continue with the survey they were consenting to participate in
the study under those terms. Since the study involved people
with depression participants were questioned at the end of the
survey as to whether participation in the study had made them
feel worse. An answer of “yes” from a participant triggered an
automatic email alert to the researchers who were able to follow
up with advice as to appropriate local sources for mental health
support.
