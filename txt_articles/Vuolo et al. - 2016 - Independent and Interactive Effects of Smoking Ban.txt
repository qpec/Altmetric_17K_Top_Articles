Abstract
Objectives—Most tobacco policy studies neither examine the impact of smoking bans and taxes 
on individual behavior over time nor consider their interactive effects, and often overlook city-
level contexts. We examine the mutual effects of these policies on smoking among a longitudinal 
cohort of young adults.
Methods—Combining a repository of U.S. tobacco policies with the nationally-representative 
geocoded National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 from ages 19–31 and Census data, we use 
multilevel logistic regression to examine the impact of tobacco policies on any current and daily 
pack smoking.
Results—For current smoking, we find significant effects for comprehensive smoking bans, but 
not excise taxes. We also find an interaction effect, with bans being most effective in locales with 
no/low taxes. For daily pack smoking, we find significant effects for taxes, but limited support for 
bans.
Conclusions—Social smoking among young adults is primarily inhibited by smoking bans, but 
excise taxes only deter such smoking in the absence of a ban. Heavy smokers are primarily 
deterred by taxes. While both policies impact young adult smoking behaviors, their dual presence 
does not intensify each policy’s efficacy.

The denormalization of tobacco use in Western nations has led to declines in both smoking 
and its public acceptability.1 Even with overall reductions in smoking, tobacco use remains 
the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the United States,2 making assessment 
of the efficacy of particular policies on actual smoking behavior an imperative. Tobacco 
control policies have been described as intensifying the process of denormalization of

 smoking among young people.3 The focus on young people is much deserved, as those who 
begin smoking at younger ages are at higher risk for smoking, particularly heavy smoking, 
as adults.4–5 The identification of policies that affect smoking behavior among young people 
can have long-term implications for public health as those individuals age into later life.
Estimates suggest that tobacco control policies have likely impacted tobacco consumption in 
the aggregate.6 A wide array of research has suggested that excise taxes and clean air 
policies are efficacious tobacco control policy tools, but these studies have come with 
several limitations that prohibit linking policy with actual individual-level behavior. For 
clean air policies, studies have inferred the effects of such prohibitions through cohort 
effects,7 relied on cross-sectional data,8–10 have not considered city-level policy,9–13 or used 
data within a single locality.14–15 Studies have also found robust effects of excise taxes on 
tobacco use.10,12–13,16–29 We note, however, that most studies of excise taxes utilized either 
aggregate time-series or repeated cross-sectional data, and often at the state or national level. 
Thus, for both bans and taxes, the literature has yet to link policy contexts at the local level 
to a longitudinal dataset of the same individuals over time as well as account for potential 
interactive effects of these policies. Even studies using the same datasets utilized herein 
have not considered the interaction between smoking bans and excise taxes.12
The local level is critically important, yet often overlooked in studies of both clean air 
policies and excise taxes. Cities led the way in enacting smoking bans in the U.S, such that 
the diffusion of clean air regulations began at the local level and spread vertically up to the 
state in an unusual example of “bottom-up federalism.”30 Chahine and colleagues suggested 
that, “contextual covariates play a larger role more locally, for example at the level of towns 
or neighborhoods. This may especially be the case for indoor smoking restrictions, which 
are highly variable within states.”9:757 They later suggest that future research should 
consider contextual variables at the local level in order to “fully characterize social 
determinants of smoking variability across populations and places.”9:758 Furthermore, 
although prohibited in some states, cities in several states may levy taxes on tobacco 
products in addition to those imposed by the state, creating similar variability on the issue of 
taxation. Thus, without accounting for the city-level, the policies to which an individual is 
subjected may be mischaracterized.
Our study overcomes the limitations of past studies by, first, combining a repository of all 
tobacco ordinances in the U.S. with a nationally representative annual survey of a single 
cohort of youth, allowing us to directly link a multilevel policy context to individual-level 
behavior over time in a manner not possible through aggregate or repeated cross-sectional 
data. Second, we consider the critical but underexplored policy context of the city-level. 
Third, no studies consider the independent and interactive effects of taxes and bans 
simultaneously. This is important as interaction analyses may lead to the identification of 
potential synergistic effects of tobacco policies. Thus, we utilize multilevel statistical 
modeling to identify the impact of these two important tobacco control policies on smoking 
behaviors over time in a nationally-representative sample of U.S. youth.

 Methods
Individual-level data source
The individual-level data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 
(NLSY97). The NLSY97 has a large nationally representative, geocoded sample (N=8,984) 
designed to track the transition of youth into adulthood, with an oversample of Black and 
Latino youth. Adolescents from ages 12 to 16 were randomly sampled in 1997 and have 
been surveyed annually. The retention rate was nearly 83% in 2011. The restricted-access, 
geocoded NLSY97 identifies the respondents’ core-based statistical area (CBSA; i.e. 
metropolitan or micropolitan area), county, and state. We analyzed a subset of respondents 
whose city of residence could be identified by combining CBSA and county information 
with a variable assessing whether the respondent lived in a principal city within the metro 
area. Thus, our analyses focus on those living in the largest principal city of a CBSA, given 
the importance of the local level within a broader multilevel policy context. We also restrict 
analyses to waves 2004 and later (ages 19–31), as this was the first year in which CBSA 
data is available. This subset amounts to 19,668 observations among 4,341 individuals 
within 487 cities. We note that respondents only contribute in years in which they live in 
these cities; that is, respondents move in and out of the defined subset. Among the subset of 
individuals that contribute at least once, 33.6% live in such a city within a CBSA in all years 
with valid data, while 59.6% live in such a city in at least half of all years with valid data.
Dependent Variables
Each year, respondents who indicated they ever smoked an entire cigarette were asked the 
number of days they had smoked during the 30 days prior to the interview, and the number 
of cigarettes they had smoked each day on those 30 days. We created two outcome variables 
based upon these self-reports: one indicating any cigarette use during the past 30 days 
(pooled mean=34.5%) and a second variable for heavy use for those who reported smoking 
at least a pack per day (pooled mean=4.9%).
Individual-Level Covariates
In all models, we included a considerable battery of control variables at both the individual-
level and the city-level. Given that age is central to patterns of substance use among young 
adults, we chose age as our time metric,31 including a quadratic term as this fit the data 
better than any other polynomial for age. Age in 1997 is also included in the models to 
control for cohort effects. We included several other individual-level risk factors for tobacco 
use in the models. Regarding family, we included time-varying indicator variables for 
whether the respondent lived with a parent, was married, and had children.32–34 We also 
accounted for recent moves via a dummy variable for a past year move across at least one 
county. For work-related risk factors, we included time-varying categorical variables for job 
status and job schedule.35 To assess peer-related influences, we included the percentage of 
peers who smoked in 1997, the only year it was measured.36 For academic performance, we 
included a dummy variable for receiving “mostly A’s” in high school.37 To control for the 
respondent’s mental health,38 the dataset included a five-item scale for depression asking 
whether the respondent in the last month has been a very nervous person, felt calm and 
peaceful, felt downhearted and blue, has been a happy person, and felt so down in the dumps

 that nothing could cheer you up, of which we use the 2004 baseline measure (alpha=0.77). 
To account for intergenerational health influences,39–44 we included parents’ self-reported 
health from 1997. We included several measures for socioeconomic status. We measured 
SES of household of origin by respondent-reported parents’ education level.45–47 The 
respondent’s SES was assessed by a time-varying measure that combined school enrollment 
status and degree attainment.32,37,47–48 Finally, we included controls for race/ethnicity,49–50 
U.S. nativity, and gender.51 Appendix A, available as a supplement to the online version of 
this article, shows the descriptive statistics for all predictors and outcomes.
City-Level Data and Measures
City-level policy data come from the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation 
(ANRF) tobacco policy database. ANRF collected a complete national repository of 
tobacco-related ordinances and regulations within the country by date. The main predictor 
variables are (1) whether or not the respondent lived in a city with a comprehensive smoking 
ban, defined as policies mandating that workplaces, bars, and restaurants are 100% smoke-
free with no indoor exceptions (pooled mean=35.8%); and, (2) the total excise taxes in that 
locale (pooled mean=$1.26; s.d.=1.05). From the ANRF repository, we created a location-
year dataset at the state- and city-level for each data year using the effective date for the 
policies. Since the state policies are not independent of city policy (i.e., a state ban 
automatically implies a city ban, and therefore, the dummy variables must match), we 
recoded cities in states with bans to reflect this status. Similarly, total excise taxes reflect the 
per pack sum of state taxes, from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and city 
taxes, from ANRF. Thus, all policy information is statistically at the city-level, but accounts 
for both state and local policies. We used FIPS codes to link the geocoded NLSY97 to 
ANRF data at the city-level, allowing us to determine the tobacco policy context within 
which respondents were located. Figure 1 displays both smoking bans and tax amounts by 
year for our respondents. There is a rapid increase over the observation period in both 
measures. The percentage living in a city with a comprehensive ban increased from 14.9% 
to 58.7% from 2004 to 2011, while average taxes increased from $0.81 to $1.65.
Several city-level measures from Census data are included as controls.52 Census data come 
from the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses, with linear interpolation for in-between years 
and official estimates used for 2011. To include both population size and density, we created 
a categorical measure of population, while density is considered continuous (logged due to 
skewness). We included the percentage of female-headed households, as a useful proxy for 
other economic measures such as poverty and income.53 To measure ties to the community, 
we used the percentage of owner-occupied housing. Finally, we included the percentage of 
non-Hispanic whites and percentage of minors to account for community racial and age 
composition, respectively.
Methods
Given the various levels of analysis and a binary outcome, we used multilevel logistic 
regression models, also known as mixed effects models, to estimate the effects of clean air 
policies and excise taxes on young adult smoking. Although respondents can move across 
cities and thus the structure is more akin to a cross-classified model, the loss in precision of

 the estimation of the variance components from using the typical multilevel structure is 
slight relative to the great computational advantage.54:117 Among years spent within the 
subset located in the largest city within a CBSA, 15.3% were located among two cities, 
2.3% among three, and 0.4% among four, such that the cross-classification of individual and 
city is of little consequence. Still, for robustness, we checked models for those who do and 
do not move and found similar results, and also included a fixed-effect in all models to 
adjust for the average effect of moving across geographic units since the last survey.
In our analysis using a typical hierarchical structure then, observations are nested within 
individuals, whom are nested within cities. Our three level model thus includes random 
intercepts for both the individual-level (Level 2) and the city-level (Level 3). These models 
adjust for the person- and city-level averages through a variance parameter that defines a 
normal distribution for each of those averages. At the lowest level of observation (Level 1), 
the predictors represent time-varying measures for both the city and the individual. At the 
individual-level, we have the time-invariant characteristics of the respondent. Because we do 
not include static city characteristics, the random intercept is the only term at Level 3. All 
models used the “xtmelogit” procedure in Stata 14.0, with the “margins” post-estimation 
command used to estimate predicted values. The study was approved by the university 
Institutional Review Board.
Results
Table 1 shows the coefficients from our models for our policy variables of interest (see 
Appendix B, available as a supplement to the online version of this article, for the full table 
with all control variables). According to Model 1 for the outcome of current smoking, even 
controlling for a robust set of covariates and excise taxes, there is a significant effect of 
comprehensive smoking bans. Those residing in cities with bans are 21.1% less likely to 
currently smoke. By comparison, there is no significant effect from taxes. Turning to Model 
2, however, we find a significant interaction effect of the two tobacco policies, with the odds 
ratios for the interaction displayed in Figure 2. The main effect for excise taxes represents 
the slope for cities with no smoking ban. In such cities, an increase of $1 in taxes results in a 
19.7% lower odds of individual-level current smoking ([1 – 0.803]*100% = −19.7%). The 
coefficient for bans now represents the effect when taxes are zero. In the absence of a tax 
then, the odds of currently smoking are 39.7% lower when a smoking ban is in effect. By the 
definition of an interaction effect, the sum of the excise tax main effect (−.220) and the 
interaction effect (.222) represents the slope for taxes in cities with a comprehensive 
smoking ban, which is virtually zero (−.220 + .222 = .002). In other words, taxes are of little 
consequence in cities with smoking bans, as reflected in the equal odds ratios for locations 
with comprehensive smoking bans in Figure 2. Figure 2, however, only displays the 
differences for a $1 increase in taxes. To understand the effect across the distribution of 
excise taxes, we display the predicted probability of current smoking by taxes and the 
presence of a ban in Figure 3. As reflected in the zero slope noted above, the tax effect in 
cities with bans is negligible. Relative to the line for cities without bans, the largest effect of 
bans occurs in cities with no to low excise taxes. The effect of the ban becomes smaller as 
taxes increase, such that the effect of a ban becomes negligible relative to a city without a 
ban when taxes are just over $2 per pack. We note that the shorter length of the line for

 locales with no bans reflects the fact that the maximum excise taxes in such places is $3.40, 
compared to $5.85 for locales with a ban.
The results for smoking a pack daily are shown in Model 3. Without the interaction, we find 
the opposite effect in comparison with any current smoking: excise taxes significantly 
reduce the odds of daily pack smoking, while smoking bans do not. A $1 increase in taxes is 
associated with 17.9% lower odds of daily pack smoking. Model 4 shows that the interactive 
effect is non-significant, although the significant main effects are still informative, yet 
should be interpreted with caution. When taxes are zero, we again find a significant effect of 
smoking bans, such that those in cities with bans are 43.6% less likely to smoke a pack 
daily. Similarly, there is a significant reduction in daily pack smoking as taxes increase in 
cities with no bans (by 30.0% per $1), though the interaction term tells us that this slope is 
not significantly different in cities with smoking bans. We note that we also interacted the 
policy terms by time to determine if these effects vary across the period of observation; 
these terms were non-significant.
Discussion
These findings provide further evidence for the efficacy of comprehensive clean air policies 
and excise taxes as tobacco control tools. Yet, we find that their influence is dependent upon 
the form of smoking under consideration. Our results indicate that any smoking in the past 
30 days among young adults is inhibited by comprehensive smoking bans. The outcome of 
any current smoking includes a large pool of young adults who smoke, but do not smoke at a 
daily pack level. This indicates that smoking bans may be most effective in deterring social 
smoking young adults, which may be an important point of early intervention. Given the 
interaction, comprehensive clean air policies are most pertinent as a tobacco control strategy 
in locations with low excise taxes. Excise taxes only deter such social smoking in the 
absence of a ban, and the impact eventually converges with that of smoking bans at high 
enough tax rates. This finding does not imply that bans are ineffective in high tax 
environments, but simply that the addition of higher excise taxes does not further deter 
young adult social smoking. By contrast, heavy smokers are primarily deterred by economic 
costs incurred through higher excise taxes. We also found limited support for the influence 
of bans on heavy smoking in places with no taxes, though given the non-significant 
interaction term, we interpret this finding with caution. Importantly, these policy effects 
were robust to the inclusion of a considerable battery of control variables at both the 
individual and city levels.
While both policies impact young adult smoking behaviors, their dual presence does not 
intensify each policy’s efficacy. In other words, smoking bans and high excise taxes together 
do not appear to have an additional effect beyond that of each policy in the absence of the 
other. This finding reiterates that either tobacco control policy can have some impact, as 
exemplified by the highest levels of smoking occurring in cities with low taxes and no 
smoking bans. Importantly, there are multiple policy pathways to reducing young people’s 
smoking, with variation depending on the outcome measure, giving policymakers several 
effective options for tobacco control. Further, even though the effect of bans and taxes on 
young adult smoking may converge at high enough tax levels, studies have found other

 health benefits to passing comprehensive clean air policies, often related to reductions in 
secondhand smoke intake,55–57 and excise taxes, such as reductions in prenatal exposure.58 
Yet, the uneven geographic distribution of these laws may reinforce health disparities given 
that these policies are more likely to be passed in locations with higher per capita incomes, 
higher education, and lower percentage of non-Hispanic Blacks after accounting for 
urbanity.59–60 Considering that clean air policies both directly inhibit smoking and foster the 
denormalization of tobacco use, policymakers should work to ensure a fair distribution of 
such tobacco controls in order to promote the health of all.
We are careful to note limitations within our study. First, we only included young adults 
whose city we could identify. The subset of analyzed respondents is similar on almost all 
individual-level variables as the sample as a whole, with two exceptions. Given our focus on 
cities, unsurprisingly Blacks are somewhat overrepresented (34% in subset vs. 27% in whole 
sample), while Whites are underrepresented (40% vs. 50%) relative to the entire sample. 
The subset is also more likely to work. We are careful to limit our generalizability to young 
people living in such locales. Further, CBSAs were first measured in 2004, such that we 
examine ages 19–31. While restricting the data to age 19 and older, we do not view this 
restriction as negative given that this constitutes an age when young adults begin to frequent 
establishments, such as bars and nightclubs, with the most between-city variation in clean air 
policy and can legally purchase tobacco products. Additionally, members of the longitudinal 
cohort self-reported smoking behaviors, which may be subject to recall and social 
desirability biases, as is common in behavioral research.
This article has taken an important next step in the analysis of excise taxes and 
comprehensive clean air policies as a means of tobacco control among young adults. The 
strengths include directly linking policy and individual behavior over time, examining the 
important city-level policy context, and modeling the potential interactive impact of both 
policies. In sum, we find comprehensive smoking bans and excise taxes to be important 
forms of tobacco control for young people, but there appear to be no synergistic effects in 
locations with both policies. Further, each policy impacts a different form of tobacco use.

 Figure 3. Interaction between City Comprehensive Smoking Ban and Tobacco Excise Tax
Note: The length of the line for locales with no comprehensive smoking bans is shorter to 
avoid extrapolation due to the lower maximum for taxes in such places ($3.40), compared to 
locales with bans ($5.85).

Note: The displayed variance components account for the differences in averages on the outcomes across individuals (Level 2) and cities (Level 3).
Note: All models contain time-invariant controls for gender, race/ethnicity, US nativity, age cohort, parents’ education, parent self-reported health, baseline depression, high school grades, and peer 
smoking in 1997; time-varying respondent controls for age, living with a parent, education, recent move between counties, employment status, job schedule, marital status, and parent status; and time-
varying city control for population, population density, owner-occupied housing, percentage minors, female-headed households, and percentage Non-Hispanic Whites. See Appendix B, available as a 
supplement to the online version of this article, for the full model with all controls displayed.
