ABSTRACT
Objective: Suboptimal magnesium status is likely widespread in the United States and increasing evidence
links it to many chronic diseases. Therapeutically addressing magnesium status can be challenging, as
higher supplementation often leads to bowel intolerance. This study evaluated the absorption, cellular
uptake, and clinical effectiveness of a timed-release formulation containing dimagnesium malate with
vitamins B6, B12, and folate (MagSRTTM) in a standard clinical population.
Methods: A standard clinical population of 91 adults participated in a placebo-controlled study carried out
at two clinics; 53 individuals received MagSRTTM, containing 500 mg dimagnesium malate and vitamins
B6, B12, and folate, while the remaining individuals received a placebo. Baseline serum magnesium, red
blood cell (RBC) magnesium, and magnesium status questionnaire scores were collected prior to trial
initiation. Serum magnesium was measured 4 and 8 hours after participants ingested 2 supplemental
tablets (250 mg magnesium) or 2 placebo tablets. After 30 days, RBC magnesium was evaluated and
participants completed the magnesium status questionnaire. A subset of MagSRTTM participants (24)
continued the trial for 90 days. Both RBC magnesium and the magnesium status questionnaire were
evaluated at 90 days.
Results: More than 75% of trial participants presented with suboptimal serum and RBC magnesium status
at baseline, while the magnesium status questionnaire predicted 100% of participants to have suboptimal
magnesium status. MagSRTTM was well tolerated by 91% of magnesium intervention participants. RBC
magnesium increased 6% and 30% over 30 and 90 days, respectively, suggesting magnesium absorption
and uptake into red blood cells over time. Overall symptomatology, assessed through a magnesium status
questionnaire, improved 28% over 30 days and 63% over 90 days.
Conclusion: A standard adult clinical population presented with both qualitative and quantitative
evidence of compromised magnesium status at the beginning of the trial. Supplementation with
MagSRTTM, a timed-release dimagnesium malate supplement containing vitamins B6, B12, and folate, for
at least 30 days significantly improved magnesium status symptoms and increased RBC magnesium with
minimal gastrointestinal symptoms.

Introduction
Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 biochemical reac-
tions throughout the body, influencing protein synthesis, mus-
cle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood
pressure regulation (1). All catalytic reactions involving energy
production, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycoly-
sis, require magnesium (1). Magnesium contributes to the
structural development of bone and is involved in the synthesis
of DNA and RNA. The active transport of calcium and potas-
sium ions across cell membranes is facilitated by magnesium, a
process vital to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction,
and normal heart rhythm (2).
The small intestine and the kidney are responsible for main-
taining magnesium homeostasis. Magnesium absorbed through
the intestinal endothelium is determined by magnesium intake
(3), gastrointestinal-tract health (4), magnesium status, and
genetics. When dietary magnesium meets physiological needs,
transcellular transport mediates approximately 30% of intesti-
nal absorption; however, when magnesium intake is lower or
higher than physiological needs, absorption increases or
decreases, respectively (3). After absorption, most magnesium
will pass through the kidneys, which filter 2000–4000 mg mag-
nesium per day, assuming a normal glomerular filtration rate.

 Roughly 96% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed by the renal
tubules and redistributed throughout the body (3).
Many of today’s chronic disease states are associated with
low magnesium status, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, systemic inflammation, hypertension, vascular dis-
ease, and osteoporosis (5). Additionally, many nonspecific
symptoms related to magnesium status improve with increased
magnesium intake via food or supplementation. Related symp-
toms include muscle weakness and cramps, tremors, nausea,
anxiety, respiratory issues, dizziness, fatigue, heart palpitations,
difficulty swallowing, poor memory, and confusion (3).
The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for
magnesium is 400 mg for men between 19 and 30 years
and 420 mg/day for men 31 years and older; for women,
the magnesium RDA is 310 mg/day between 19 and 30 years
and 320 mg/day at age 31 years and older. Magnesium
RDA increases to 350–360 mg/day for pregnant women,
depending on age (6). Data from the 1999–2000 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indi-
cate that at least 68% of Americans consume less than the
RDA for magnesium (7).
Magnesium supplementation can correct for reduced intake,
increased magnesium loss from poor absorption, or increased
needs linked to chronic disease. However, supplementing mag-
nesium in recommended or therapeutic doses can cause unde-
sirable side effects if it is not absorbed well in the small
intestine. Malabsorption may create an osmotic gradient in the
colon, resulting in loose stools or diarrhea (1). Many cost-effec-
tive retail-grade supplements contain magnesium oxide or
magnesium carbonate; however, bioavailability of these forms
is very low and often results in negative gastrointestinal (GI)
symptoms (8). Magnesium glycinate, threonate, and malate,
found in more expensive physician-grade supplements, are
magnesium salts of organic acids with higher bioavailability,
increasing absorption and minimizing GI discomfort (8). Mag-
nesium malate is a combination of magnesium and malic acid,
a weak organic acid found in fruits and vegetables. This form of
magnesium is highly soluble in the body and is therefore well
absorbed (9).
The average adult body contains 25 grams of magnesium,
with 99% stored in bone, muscle, and soft tissue (3). Less
than 1% of the body’s total magnesium is found in blood
serum, with levels tightly controlled through homeostatic
regulation (10). Although this makes evaluation difficult,
the most common and readily available method for assess-
ing magnesium status is to measure serum levels. Serum
magnesium values represent extracellular concentration and
only weakly correlate to total body magnesium or specific
tissue levels (4); however, serum magnesium is a useful
diagnostic tool to evaluate short-term or acute changes in
magnesium absorption (8). Unlike serum testing, red blood
cell (RBC) magnesium testing evaluates an intracellular con-
centration. Some researchers have found little relationship
between RBC and tissue or bone magnesium content, while
others have found that changes in RBC magnesium corre-
late with hypertension, premenstrual syndrome, and chronic
fatigue syndrome (8). Comparatively, a symptoms-based
questionnaire provides a qualitative approach for evaluating
magnesium status. Questionnaires are beneficial in tracking
patient perception of overall health and symptomatology
and provide a noninvasive means for tracking patient prog-
ress with supplementation or other therapies.
This study evaluated the efficacy of Jigsaw Magnesium
w/SRT�
(aka. MagSRTTM), a timed-release formulation
containing magnesium with B6, folate, and B12, in a real-
world cross section of patients with clinically normal mag-
nesium status. Primary clinical outcomes include evaluation
of magnesium absorption by measuring changes in serum
magnesium levels at 4 and 8 hours after initial supplemen-
tation; examination of cellular uptake using RBC magne-
sium values after 30 and 90 days of supplementation; and
evaluation of patient symptomatology shifts using a magne-
sium status questionnaire after 30 and 90 days of supple-
mentation. Estimating the percentage of recruited patients
(representing a clinically healthy population) with subopti-
mal magnesium status, based on serum, RBC and question-
naire results, was a secondary objective.
Methods
Study design
This pragmatic, placebo-controlled study was completed in two
segments, with the intervention trial conducted first, followed
by a separate placebo study. The trial was approved by the
Pharmasan Labs Internal Review Board.
To determine trial sample size, we assumed an effect size of
0.5 mg/dL for RBC magnesium and a population standard
deviation of 0.25 mg/dL (11) and a conservative effect size and
standard deviation of 10 for the magnesium status question-
naire. Assuming a Type 1 error rate (a) of 0.05, a Type II error
rate (b) of 0.1, and a two-tailed test, at least 42 participants
were required, 21 in the trial and 21 in the placebo group. To
improve the study power and account for an unknown dropout
rate, we aimed to recruit at least 100 participants, with 50 per
group.
Trial and placebo participants were recruited through either
the Scottsdale Heart Institute at Chambers Clinic (Center 1,
20801 N Scottsdale Rd., Suite 250, Scottsdale, AZ 85255) or
through LabCorp (Center 2, 7300 Girard Ave., #105, La Jolla,
CA).
The
trial
arm
evaluated
MagSRTTM
(Jigsaw
Health,
Scottsdale, AZ), a timed-release magnesium malate plus B
vitamin supplement, from March 15 to April 15, 2016. Trial
intervention was 4 tablets of MagSRTTM, with each tablet
containing 125 mg magnesium (as dimagnesium malate),
2.5 mg vitamin C (as ascorbyl palmitate), 1.25 mg vitamin
B6 (as pyridoxal 5-phosphate monohydrate), 50 mg folate
(as Quatrefolic� 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid glucosamine
salt), and 1.5 mg vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin). Serving
size was 2 tablets, twice per day. After 30 days, participants
were given the option to continue with MagSRTTM for a
total of 90 days (ending June 15, 2016).
Tablets containing only the timed-release components of
MagSRTTM were evaluated within an independent placebo
group from January 10 to February 10, 2017. Each placebo tab-
let contained 648 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. Participants
were asked to take two tablets, twice a day.

 Participants
Ninety-four and 57 participants were initially recruited through
Centers 1 and 2 for the MagSRTTM trial and the placebo,
respectively. The principal investigator explained the nature of
the trial and summarized the consent form, which stated that
patient privacy would be maintained under patient–doctor con-
fidentiality as it pertains to the appropriate state medical board,
state law, and federal and supported medical ethics.
After patients consented to participate in the trial, their
charts were evaluated to determine whether they met the fol-
lowing inclusion criteria: adults 35 to 70 years of age (inclusive)
who understood the nature of the study, the informed consent,
and other trial materials. To ensure the safety of participants,
individuals were excluded if they had any of the conditions or
medical history listed in Figure 1. Additional exclusion criteria
included undergoing elective surgery during the course of the
study.
Fifty-three individuals were enrolled in the trial group and
38 were enrolled in the placebo group. Participants were
unpaid, and received free MagSRTTM or placebo tablets over
the course of the trial and free laboratory testing of RBC mag-
nesium and serum magnesium. After trial enrollment, all indi-
viduals were provided with a diary and asked to document
adverse reactions, side effects, and personal notes. Participants
were instructed to stop ingestion of MagSRTTM or the placebo
if they perceived any side effects or adverse reactions and to
contact the principal investigator.
Measurements
Prior to receipt of MagSRTTM or placebo tablets, participants
completed a baseline magnesium status questionnaire and had
blood drawn to determine baseline serum and RBC magnesium
(time 0, day 0). All blood samples were sent to LabCorp (Palo
Alto, CA) within 2 hours of draw.
Upon completion of baseline evaluation, participants took 2
of the 4 MagSRTTM or placebo tablets. Serum magnesium was
measured at 4 hours and 8 hours after ingestion to evaluate
magnesium absorption through the small intestine and into the
bloodstream.
On day 30, RBC magnesium status was recorded and partic-
ipants completed a day 30 magnesium status questionnaire. At
this time, MagSRTTM participants were given the option to
continue the trial for a total of 90 days. Individuals continuing
with the intervention had RBC magnesium levels measured at
90 days and completed a 90-day magnesium status question-
naire. An extended trial was not offered to placebo participants.
The magnesium status questionnaire used for the trial is
reproduced in the appendix. The survey included 65 questions
assigned a weight from 2 to 5, with 5 indicating a greater

 impact on magnesium status and 2 indicating a reduced impact
on magnesium status. A score greater than 30 suggests subopti-
mal magnesium status that may or may not be detected by
serum magnesium or RBC magnesium testing. Questions are
organized by diet/lifestyle, health conditions, and nervous sys-
tem symptoms commonly associated with low magnesium sta-
tus. A fourth section includes medications and supplements
that compete with magnesium absorption.

Normally distributed within group comparisons were con-
ducted using a paired two-sample t-test for means, 95% confi-
dence interval, a D 0.05, and a two-tailed p value. To
determine significance between nonnormal within group
medians, a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used at
a D 0.05. Normally distributed independent group compari-
sons (i.e., MagSRTTM vs. placebo) were completed using an
independent two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances
(most conservative), 95% confidence interval, a D 0.05, and a
two-tailed p value. A two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test (a D
0.05) was used to determine significance between nonnormal
independent medians.
Significance of individual symptom changes on the magne-
sium status questionnaire was determined using one-tailed p
values for significance tests of z scores calculated from the pro-
portions of participants with each specific symptom at baseline
and day 30 using a 95% confidence interval.
Results
Participants
Figure 2 summarizes participant flow through the MagSRTTM
and placebo trials at Centers 1 and 2.
In total, 94 individuals were recruited for the MagSRTTM
trial and 90 were assessed to determine whether they met the
trial’s eligibility requirements. Ultimately, 53 participants
started the MagSRTTM study and 5 participants (9%) did not
finish the trial, stating side effects (see Supplement tolerance
section). On day 30, 24 of the original 53 participants (45%)
chose to extend the MagSRTTM intervention for 60 additional
days (total intervention of 90 days). Of these, 24 (100%) com-
pleted the magnesium status questionnaire and had RBC mag-
nesium determined on day 90.
In total, 57 individuals were recruited for the placebo group,
with 41 ultimately assessed to determine if they met the trial’s
eligibility requirements. Of these, 38 participants started the
placebo. On day 30, 32 of the 38 (84%) completed a final mag-
nesium status questionnaire and had their blood drawn to
determine RBC magnesium levels. In total, 6 of the original 38
(16%) placebo participants did not complete the trial, citing
uncomfortable side effects as the reason for withdrawal (see
Supplement tolerance section).
Baseline characteristics of MagSRTTM and placebo subjects
are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences
in location, age, gender, body weight, or body mass index
(BMI) between MagSRTTM and placebo participants.
Baseline magnesium status
Baseline serum magnesium values were statistically equivalent
for the MagSRTTM and placebo groups (Table 2). The lab
reported a normal serum magnesium range between 1.6 and
2.3 mg/dL; 4 participants (5%) had serum magnesium less than
normal, while 43 participants (95%) had serum magnesium
within normal values.
Baseline RBC magnesium values for the MagSRTTM group
were statistically equivalent to those of the placebo group
(Table 2). Values between 4.2 and 6.8 mg/dL are within the test
lab’s normal range. For all participants at baseline, 6 (8%) had
RBC magnesium values less than 4.2 mg/dL and 69 (87%) fell
within the normal range.
Mean magnesium status questionnaire scores were statisti-
cally equivalent between the MagSRTTM and placebo groups.
One hundred percent of the MagSRTTM and placebo partici-
pants exceeded the questionnaire cutoff value of 30, suggesting
suboptimal magnesium status within these populations.
Magnesium absorption
Changes in serum magnesium were used to evaluate the
absorption of magnesium into the bloodstream during the first
day of the trial. Samples were collected in 4-hour increments
for both the MagSRTTM and placebo groups. Results are sum-
marized in Table 2 and Figure 3.
In
the
MagSRTTM
group,
serum
magnesium
values
increased 22% at 4 hours after taking 2 tablets of MagSRTTM.
Serum magnesium for 8 (17%) of the MagSRTTM participants
exceeded the normal range value of 2.3 mg/dL at 4 hours after
taking the initial supplement dose. Serum magnesium values
decreased 5% 4 hours later, resulting in a 17% total increase in
serum magnesium 8 hours after taking 2 MagSRTTM tablets.
Serum magnesium for all participants fell within the lab’s nor-
mal range 8 hours after trial initiation.
Serum magnesium increased 3% for the placebo group,
4 hours after intake of 2 placebo tablets. One participant (3%)
had a serum magnesium value lower than normal. Serum mag-
nesium remained constant at 3% 8 hours after intake of 2 pla-
cebo tablets, with all values falling within the normal lab range.
30-day cellular magnesium uptake and symptoms
RBC magnesium increased 6% over 30 days for those in the
MagSRTTM group (Table 2), although one participant contin-
ued to have a RBC magnesium value below the normal range.
This participant started with the lowest RBC magnesium
(3.8

less than the cutoff value of 30.
Table 3 summarizes changes in specific questionnaire symp-
toms over 30 days for the MagSRTTM and placebo groups. The
MagSRTTM group showed significant improvement in 11 of the
38 individual symptoms tracked throughout the trial. No signif-
icant individual symptom improvement was observed in the
placebo group.
Of the 53 MagSRTTM participants, 0 reported adverse reac-
tions, while 13 (25%) reported 16 total side effects, with 9
reporting a single side effect and 4 participants reporting 2 side
effects. Specific side effects included diarrhea, dizziness, stom-
ach pain/cramps, and loose stool.
Of the 38 placebo participants, 3 (8%) had an adverse reac-
tion to the tablets (itching, headache, stomach pain). Four
(11%) in the placebo group reported 6 total side effects, includ-
ing gas, bloating, and loose stool.

 participants. Placebo values at baseline (n D 38) and 30 days
(n D 32) are included for comparison.
RBC magnesium values increased a total of 30% for the 90-
day MagSRTTM subgroup, with all values falling within the nor-
mal range.
Magnesium status questionnaire scores for the 24 remaining
MagSRTTM participants decreased 63% over 90 days (Table 2).
Ultimately, all 24 (100%) of the 90-day MagSRTTM participants
achieved a score less than the cutoff value of 30.
Participants who continued the MagSRTTM intervention for
90 days reported 0 side effects throughout the trial duration.
Discussion
The following are key findings from supplementing with
MagSRTTM for at least 30 days:
1. Seventy-nine percent and 89% of all trial participants
presented with suboptimal serum and RBC magnesium
status at baseline, respectively. The magnesium status
questionnaire predicted suboptimal magnesium status
for 100% of trial participants.
2. MagSRTTM was well tolerated by most individuals, with
91% of participants completing the 30-day trial and 75%
completing with no reported side effects. Of those indi-
viduals who continued the trial for 90 days, none
reported side effects.
3. RBC magnesium increased 6% and 30% over 30 and
90 days, respectively. This increase suggests that supple-
mental magnesium was absorbed in the GI tract and
transported into red blood cells over time.
4. Overall symptomatology, assessed through a magnesium
status questionnaire, improved 28% over 30 days and
63% over 90 days.
Baseline magnesium status
Recent values for magnesium status in the U.S. population are
not readily available (1), although some researchers and experts

 suggest that Americans are magnesium deficient (12). Eval-
uating baseline magnesium status and the impact of magne-
sium supplementation on status is therefore one objective
of this study. Laboratory normal ranges are often used to
determine if a patient has sufficient vitamin or mineral sta-
tus; however, lab test ranges are determined by the results
of the population being tested. If magnesium status is
expected to be suboptimal in most Americans, the corre-
sponding normal range in laboratory values would reflect
values below what may be ideal.
The normal range for serum magnesium is between 1.6
and 2.3 mg/dL; however, optimal serum magnesium status
is expected at values �2.0 mg/dL (13). At baseline, 11 par-
ticipants (21%) had serum magnesium values �2.0 mg/dL,
indicating that 79% of participants may have had subopti-
mal serum magnesium status. Eight hours after ingesting
250 mg of dimagnesium malate, 39 (74%) MagSRTTM par-
ticipants had serum magnesium values �2.0 mg/dL.
The normal range for RBC magnesium is between 4.2 and
6.8 mg/dL. There is some debate around optimal intracellular
magnesium levels. One source suggests that an optimal RBC
magnesium would be �6.0 mg/dL (9). At baseline, 5 (11%) of
all participants had RBC magnesium values of 6 or greater,
indicating that 89% may have had low magnesium status. After
30 days, 9 individuals (19%) in the MagSRTTM trial had a RBC
magnesium value �6 mg/dL. Of those who continued the
MagSRTTM trial for 90 days, 22 (92%) showed optimal magne-
sium status.
According to these ranges for both serum and RBC magne-
sium, roughly 80–90% of this trial population may have had
suboptimal magnesium status at baseline. These findings corre-
late well with the results from the magnesium status survey,
which indicated that 100% of participants had a score �30 at
baseline, indicating potentially low magnesium status.
Supplement tolerance
The tolerable upper limit (TUL) for magnesium supplementa-
tion is currently 350 mg for adults 20 years and older (14). The
Food and Nutrition Board established this TUL in 1997 because
of the laxative effects commonly associated with inorganic
magnesium salts (5). This trial illustrates that MagSRTTM, a
timed-release
organic
salt
of
magnesium
(dimagnesium
malate), when taken at 250 mg twice a day, is well tolerated by
most individuals.
Six individuals (11%) reported loose stools and diarrhea,
and two (4%) reported GI symptoms within the first
30 days of the MagSRTTM trial. These symptoms echo those
associated with poor inorganic magnesium absorption, sug-
gesting possible intestinal malabsorption with this form of
magnesium for this subgroup. A comparison of incremental
serum magnesium (at 0, 4, and 8 hours), baseline RBC
magnesium, magnesium status questionnaire scores, and
age shows no significant difference between these 6 individ-
uals and the remaining participants. Magnesium absorption
can be compromised by hypochlorhydria (9), which can
result from long-term use of proton pump inhibitors or
antacids (3), increased age (9), low dietary zinc (9), and a
high relative calcium intake (9). For those unable to tolerate
magnesium supplementation, it’s imperative to understand
the cause underlying this difficulty so that it may be cor-
rected, with likely improvements in overall micronutrient
absorption.
Magnesium absorption
Serum magnesium increased 22% at 4 hours after taking 2 tab-
lets of MagSRTTM (250 mg dimagnesium malate), then showed
a 5% decrease after an additional 4 hours. The initial increase

 in serum magnesium suggests that magnesium was absorbed
through the small intestine into the bloodstream. The slight
decrease at 8 hours may have captured the body in the process
of regulating serum magnesium concentration, either by incor-
porating it into cells or releasing it into the urine.
Trial participants ranged in age from 35 to 69 years.
This age range was chosen for two reasons: first, these
ages are representative of the patients who visit Center 1,
and second, absorption of vitamins and minerals may
decrease with age as a result of stress (9) and certain

 clinical conditions (Helicobacter pylori infection, diabetes,
congestive heart failure, pernicious anemia) that develop
with age (15). The low pH of stomach acid breaks the
bonds between most minerals and macronutrients to facili-
tate absorption in the small intestine. As we age, stomach
acid pH increases (16) and the free mineral content
released from the stomach diminishes. Since pH gradually
increases with progression through the GI tract, further
absorption of bound minerals is unlikely.
Four- and 8-hour serum magnesium values indicate that
magnesium absorption did occur in an age group at risk for
hypochlorhydria.
Uptake of magnesium into red blood cells
While RBC magnesium levels increased 6% over 30 days,
we were surprised that magnesium content increased an
additional 24% over the 90-day extension. The increase in
RBC magnesium over time indicates cellular magnesium
uptake, at least into red blood cells. It also suggests that
red blood cells have a substantial capacity for absorbing
magnesium. Further research evaluating the relationship
between magnesium intake levels and RBC magnesium over
a longer test period to determine if RBC magnesium con-
centration levels reach a plateau value may be indicated.
Symptom reduction
Symptoms showing significant improvement after 30 days of
MagSRTTM supplementation included (ranked from smallest to
largest p value): memory, carbohydrate/chocolate cravings, sex-
ual energy, blood pressure, fatigue, concentration, asthma/
wheezing, anxiety, and gagging/choking from esophageal
spasms. These results suggest that MagSRTTM may provide a
relatively safe, highly effective clinical tool for addressing these
particular symptoms. However, because the supplement con-
tains significant amounts of methyl folate, B12, and B6 in addi-
tion to magnesium, we cannot conclude that magnesium alone
is responsible for the improvement in symptomatology. A
future trial evaluating the effect of dimagnesium malate alone
on the magnesium status questionnaire scores is necessary to
further validate the questionnaire.
Placebo effect
A small placebo effect was observed in this study, with placebo
participants reporting a 6% reduction in the magnesium status
questionnaire score over 30 days. A placebo effect is expected
in any clinical trial, and is also observed in clinical practice
(17); it demonstrates the powerful impact that the brain can
have on symptoms and healing. A meta-analysis of antidepres-
sant trial results, measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale of
Depression, indicates a mean placebo response of 30% for 35
trials, with the 4 tested antidepressants having a mean effective
rate of 1.5 times that of the placebo (18). In contrast, magne-
sium supplementation over 30 days in the MagSRTTM group
was 4.6 times more effective than the placebo, indicating a
strong, positive response to the intervention, and a limited
response to the placebo.
Placebo participants showed a small, but significant increase
in 30-day RBC magnesium. It’s possible that the RBC magne-
sium test may be insensitive to small changes in magnesium
concentration.
Strengths and limitations
This study suggests a relationship between MagSRTTM (500 mg
per day dimagnesium malate) intake over at least 30 days,

 increased RBC magnesium values and improved magnesium-
specific symptomatology. The completion of the trial at two
sites improves the generalizability and clinical applicability of
the results.
Trial design is the greatest limitation to the validity of the
reported data. This trial was initially conceived to evaluate the
efficacy of MagSRTTM within an average clinical population.
However, once the trial arm began, an independent placebo
group was recruited to improve the validity of the study. Future
studies should utilize a fully randomized crossover design to min-
imize potential experimental, participant, and investigator bias.
Based on the 90-day MagSRTTM results, conducting the full
trial (both intervention and placebo) for at least 90 days would
have been beneficial. Future research involving a trial length of
at least 90 days, and possibly 6 or 12 months, could provide
additional information on the kinetics of cellular magnesium
uptake and magnesium supplementation necessary to maintain
optimal magnesium status. Collecting urine samples to deter-
mine urinary magnesium content over the course of the trial
would provide additional clinical information on how the body
is absorbing and processing MagSRTTM.
Finally, measurements of additional vitals, such as blood
pressure and pulse, and additional serum tests, such as potas-
sium, sodium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, and phospho-
rus, would have provided additional, quantifiable information
on the clinical impacts of MagSRTTM.
Conclusion
Seventy-nine percent and 89% of MagSRTTM and placebo par-
ticipants presented with suboptimal serum and RBC magne-
sium status at baseline, respectively. The magnesium status
questionnaire predicted suboptimal magnesium status for
100% of trial participants. Supplementation with MagSRTTM, a
timed-release dimagnesium malate supplement containing vita-
mins B6, B12, and folate, improved patient-reported symptoms
using a magnesium status questionnaire by 30% and 63% over
30 and 90 days, respectively. At the same time, RBC magne-
sium increased 7% after 30 days and 36% after 90 days of sup-
plementation. Ninety-one percent of the participants reported
no gastrointestinal discomfort after taking MagSRTTM for at
least 30 days.
