ABSTRACT
Individuals with schizophrenia and their
first-degree relatives have higher rates of type 2 diabetes
(T2D) than the general population (18–30 vs. 1.2–6.3%),
independent of body mass index and antipsychotic med-
ication, suggesting shared genetic components may con-
tribute to both diseases. The cause of this association
remains unknown. Mutations in disrupted in schizophre-
nia 1 (DISC1) increase the risk of developing psychiatric
disorders [logarithm (base 10) of odds = 7.1]. Here, we
identified DISC1 as a major player controlling pancreatic
b-cell proliferation and insulin secretion via regulation of
glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK3b). DISC1 expression
was enriched in developing mouse and human pancreas
and adult b- and ductal cells. Loss of DISC1 function,
through siRNA-mediated depletion or expression of a
dominant-negative truncation that models the chromo-
somal translocation of human DISC1 in schizophrenia, re-
sulted in decreased b-cell proliferation (3 vs. 1%; P < 0.01),
increased apoptosis (0.1 vs. 0.6%; P < 0.01), and glucose
intolerance in transgenic mice. Insulin secretion was re-
duced (0.5 vs. 0.1 ng/ml; P < 0.05), and critical b-cell
transcription factors Pdx1 and Nkx6.1 were significantly
decreased. Impaired DISC1 allowed inappropriate acti-
vation of GSK3b in b cells, and antagonizing GSK3b
(SB216763; IC50 = 34.3 nM) rescued the b-cell defects.
These results uncover an unexpected role for DISC1 in
normal b-cell physiology and suggest that DISC1 dysre-
gulation contributes to T2D independently of its impor-
tance for cognition.—Jurczyk, A., Nowosielska, A.,

The continued increase of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major
public health concern worldwide. In addition to genetic
predisposition, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle contribute
to its prevalence, and one-third of individuals with hyper-
insulinemia, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tol-
erance will eventually develop T2D (1, 2). Increased
insulin secretion can compensate for insulin resistance;
however,reducedaction of b cells and a reduction inb-cell
mass eventually result in compromised glucose tolerance
and T2D develops (3). This reduction of b-cell mass/
function may result from increased cell death and/or in-
adequate proliferation (4).
Intriguingly, individuals with severe mental illnesses
such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder also have
higher rates of metabolic syndrome and diabetes than the
general population (5). The higher rates of T2D in
schizophrenics and their family members (18–30% vs.
1.2–6.3% in the general population) suggest a pathoge-
netic association between diabetes and these psychiatric
disorders (6, 7). Antipsychotic therapies often lead to weight
gain and further increase incidence of T2D (8); how-
ever, even nonobese schizophrenic patients (with normal
weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist
hip ratio) also show dysregulated insulin secretion (9).
In addition, impaired glucose tolerance has been ob-
served in first-episode, drug-na¨
ıve patients with schizo-
phrenia (2, 6, 10, 11).
Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a well-
characterized schizophrenia susceptibility gene that was

 a balanced chromosomal translocation segregated with
schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders (12). Ad-
ditionally, a mutation in DISC1 was also identified in an
American family (13), and multiple DISC1 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms associated with mental disorders have been
identified, as reviewed elsewhere (14). Genetic linkage
studies have confirmed DISC1 involvement with several
psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar disor-
der, and major depression with logarithm (base 10) of odds
score 7.1 (15–17). In addition, the blood RNA expression
levels of DISC1 and its interacting proteins are decreased in
schizophrenic patients as compared with healthy individuals
(18). Biochemical studies established DISC1 as a multi-
functional protein hub that is required for both neuro-
development, because of its ability to regulate the
proliferation and migration of neuronal progenitors, as well
as for normal adult cognitive functioning (19–21).
Because DISC1 was shown to be expressed in pancreas
(12), we hypothesized that DISC1 may also play a role in b
cells and that defects in DISC1 may predispose individuals
to T2D in addition to the known disruption of cognition.
Therefore, to investigate a possible genetic link between
severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and
impaired glucose homeostasis, we chose to examine the
function of DISC1 in vitro in b cells and in vivo in a trans-
genic mouse model with inducible b-cell-specific expres-
sion of a dominant-negative truncation of human DISC1
[truncated human DISC1 (thDISC1)]. Previously, schizo-
phrenia was thought to disrupt central control of blood
glucose homeostasis, leading to T2D (22). Here we
present an alternative perspective showing that DISC1
disruption impairs mouse b-cell function independently
of CNS regulation, thus revealing an important role for
DISC1 in normal pancreatic b-cell function and glucose
homeostasis in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Mice were housed in theUniversity of Massachusetts facilities on a
12 h light-dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water.
ThDISC1 transgenic mice were obtained from The Jackson Lab-
oratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The Tet-On double transgenic
system was modified from elsewhere (23) to generate a mouse
modelofinduciblethDISC1expressioninb cells[NOD.Cg-Prkdc,
scid . Il2rg , tm1Wjl . Tg(Ins2-rtTA)2Efr/Sz; Tg(tetO-DISC1*)
1001Plet/J ]. Mice harboring both of these transgenes have doxy-
cycline (DOX)-inducible expression of thDISC1 in pancreatic b
cells following dietary administration of 200 mg/kg DOX (Bio-
Serv; Flemington, NJ, USA). These mice have a mixed genetic
background. To use mice with similar mixed genetic back-
grounds for experiments, we used double transgenic homo-
zygote mice without DOX for controls and double transgenic
homozygote mice with DOX for experimental animals.
Body weight and fed blood glucose levels were measured
weekly using a OneTouch glucometer (LifeScan; Wayne, PA,
USA) on blood from a tail snip. Samples for intraperitoneal glu-
cose tolerance tests were collected from mice fasted overnight
and at indicated time points after intraperitoneal injection of
glucose (2 g/kg body weight).Plasma insulin wasmeasured with a
mouse insulin ELISA kit (Alpco; Salem, NH, USA). Glycogen
synthase kinase-3b (GSK3b) inhibitor rescue injections were
performed after indicated time of DOX or control diet with 4
intraperitoneal injections, every day of SB 216763 (IC50 = 34.3 nM;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 2 mg/kg body weight.
Cell culture and gene silencing
The INS1 832/13 insulinoma cell line [gift from Dr. Urano,
(Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA)] was cultured in RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin
and streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and b-mercaptoethanol. The
MIN6 insulinoma cell line (gift from Dr. Urano) was cultured in
DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin. Primary
humans islets obtained from the IIDP (Integrated Islet Distribution
Program, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Dia-
betes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Bethesda, MD, USA) were
plated onto Matrigel (BD Biosciences; Billerica, MA, USA) coated
chamberslides(ThermoFisherScientific;Waltham,MA,USA)and
cultured in CMRL medium supplemented with 10% FBS, non-
essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin.
For small interference RNA (siRNA) transfection Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen; Grand Island, NY, USA) was used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequences for siRNA (siDISC1: 59-
AACGGCTGAGCCAAGAGTTGG-39, 59-AAGGCAAACACTGTGA-
AGTGC-39; SCR: 59-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-39).
Primary islets, islet perifusion, and insulin content
Pancreatic islets from control or thDISC1 mice were harvested by
collagenase digestion as described elsewhere (24). For perifusion
experiments, islets were isolated and cultured overnight on
nonadhesive petri dishes after which 25 islets were hand selected
and loaded for perifusion using a perifusion machine from Bio-
rep Technologies (Miami, FL, USA). The islets were perifused in
Kreb’s buffer with 0.17% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of
100 ml/min throughout the run and flow-through was main-
tained at 4°C. Perifusion solutions were gassed with 95% O2/5%
CO2 and the islet chambers were maintained at 37°C. At the end
oftherun,the islets werecollectedfromthechambersandplaced
in acidified ethanol overnight to determine total insulin levels.
Pancreatic insulin content was determined as described else-
where (25). The whole pancreas was dissected out, weighted,
and placed into 1.5% HCl, 70% EtOH solution overnight at 2
20°C. The tissue was spun the following day and insulin content
of the supernatant was determined by ELISA kit (Alpco; Salem,
NH, USA).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Mouse and human islets were isolated and RNA extracted
with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA, USA) and re-
verse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Gene
expression was evaluated with qPCR using TaqMan system
and TaqMan probes (human ACTB: Hs01060665_g1, DISC1:
Hs00962132_m1, GCG: Hs01031536_m1, INS: Hs02741908_m1;

 Human pancreas and in situ hybridization
Human frozen pancreas sections (4 mm) were obtained from the
Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes program (26).
Fetal pancreata were obtained from Stem Express (Placerville, CA,
USA). The sections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (50 ml of Tris-
buffered saline, 1 g bovine serum albumin, 50 ml Tween, 2% goat
serum), and incubated with primary antibodies followed by sec-
ondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were anti: actin (1:1000),

(1:1000) and Alexa 647 (1:500) from Invitrogen.
For in situ hybridization (ISH), human paraffin sections from
Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes pediatric
organ donors were used and ISH was performed according to
manufacturer’s recommendations (RNAScope, Advanced Cell
Diagnostics, San Francisco, CA, USA). Amplification was applied
as recommended followed by counterstaining with Gill Hemox-
ylin and coverslipping with Cytoseal (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Colocalization with insulin was determined in one donor using
the ISH procedure as described without coverslipping before
immunofluorescence detection of insulin.
Image acquisition
All images were acquired with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Eclipse Ti
series microscope. Images were further analyzed with Nikon El-
ements image analysis software.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with the Student’s t test. All
values were expressed as means 6 SEM. Differences were consid-
ered to be statistically significant when P , 0.05.
Study approval
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts Medical School approved all experi-
mental procedures involving mice.
RESULTS
Endogenous DISC1 expression is enriched in adult
human and mouse pancreatic b cells and ducts
Although DISC1 mRNA expression was reported in adult
human pancreas (12), the precise cell types remained
unknown. Closer examination of human (Fig. 1A) and
mouse (Fig. 1B) pancreas showed DISC1 immunofluo-
rescent staining enriched in insulin-positive b cells and in
cytokeratin 19 (CK19)-staining ductal cells; exocrine pan-
creas showed much less staining. ISH confirmed DISC1
mRNA in human islets and ductal cells, with lower ex-
pression in exocrine pancreas (Fig. 1C). The full length
DISC1 protein is ;100 kDa; however, multiple differen-
tially spliced transcripts of DISC1 have been identified (27,
28). By Western blot (Fig. 1D), the previously described
;100-kDa doublet as well as smaller DISC1 isoforms were
observed in murine b-cell lines (TC6 and MIN6) and hu-
man islets (29). The functional relevance of DISC1 iso-
forms is not understood. Specificity of the DISC1 antibody
was demonstrated by DISC1-specific peptide blockade for
Westernblots(Fig.1D)andimmunofluorescenceof b cells
(Fig. 1E).
To verify more precisely which islets cells express DISC1,
we fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted adult
human islets into insulin-positive b cells and glucagon-
positive a cells and performed quantitative RT-PCR on the
sorted cell populations. We show that DISC1 mRNA is
expressed in insulin-positive b cells and, to a lesser extent,
in glucagon-positive a cells (Fig. 1F); expression levels of
insulin and glucagon indicate relative abundance com-
pared to actin.
DISC1 is coexpressed with human pancreatic
progenitor markers during development
Because DISC1 is important for maintaining the neu-
ronal progenitor pool (19) and we detected DISC1 in
ductal cells, the source of pancreatic progenitors during
embryonic neogenesis, we tested whether DISC1 also
coexpresses with pancreatic progenitors in human fetal
pancreas. At 17 wk, DISC1 coexpressed with pancreatic
progenitor markers SOX9 (Fig. 2A) and PDX1 (Fig. 2B)
in pancreatic epithelium. Most pancreatic ductal cells
exhibiting high SOX9 and PDX1 expression also
showed high DISC1 expression. Recently published
RNA-seq analysis of FACS-sorted fetal pancreas extend
our immunofluorescence data showing high DISC1 ex-
pression in fetal b cells compared with adult b cells (5.98 6
1.53 vs. 0.69 6 0.203 transcripts per million; P , 0.01)
(30). Similarly in neurons, DISC1 is enriched in fetal as
compared to adult brain (29). Sox9 levels, similar to DISC1,
were also enriched in developing pancreas, and PDX1
levels were higher in adult b cells (30). Together, these data
suggest an important role for DISC1 in development of hu-
man pancreatic progenitors in addition to mature pancreas.
thDISC1 transgenic mice have normal body weight but
transient hyperglycemia postweaning
To determine the function of DISC1 specifically in b cells,
we used an established thDISC1 transgenic mouse model
(engineered to model the effects of the disease-associated
chromosomal translocation of DISC1 in schizophrenia)
(23). These mice were crossed with mice expressing the
tetracycline transactivator under control of the insulin 2
(Ins2) promoter to inducibly express thDISC1 in mature
b cells (Fig. 3A). DISC1 truncation acts as a dominant
negative in animal models and cell lines by binding
to native DISC1 and preventing its interactions with
other binding partners (31–34). Experimental animals
were derived from homozygous mice continuously provided

 DOX containing food from the time a plug was observed
in the pregnant females, throughout pregnancy and un-
til takedown, although control animals were the same
genotype but without DOX in their diet. DOX induction
led to b-cell expression of thDISC1 (Fig. 3B). We and
others have not observed any toxic effects of DOX,
including glucose regulation (data not shown) (35, 36).
Transgenic thDISC1 mice were born at predicted mendelian
proportion with normal body weights (Fig. 3C). How-
ever, between weeks 3.5 to 4.5, thDISC1 mice had sig-
nificantly elevated blood glucose (Fig. 3D). Although
blood glucose levels subsequently normalized after 6 wk
of age, transient early hyperglycemia has been reported
to result in alterations in gene expression, as well as im-
paired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in b cells
(37, 38).
thDISC1 transgenic mice have reduced plasma insulin
levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased
pancreatic insulin content
To determine whether our transgenic animals had im-
paired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we first
performed a glucose tolerance test. We found that at 6
wk of age thDISC1 mice had significantly impaired glu-
cose tolerance (Fig. 4A), and their nonfasting plasma
insulin (Fig. 4B), and fasting and glucose-stimulated
levels of plasma insulin (Fig. 4C) were significantly
lower. Indeed, b-cell mass, as determined by pancreatic
insulin content, was marginally decreased (P = 0.087) in
thDISC1 mice early in life, at 1 wk of age, suggesting that
the animals may have been born with a deficiency in
endocrine pancreas (Fig. 4D) and eventually by 28 wk,

 b-cell insulin content of thDISC1 was significantly lower
than controls (Fig. 4D).
Isolated pancreatic islets from thDISC1 transgenic
mice have decreased expression of b-cell-specific
transcription factors and insulin and reduced
insulin secretion
To investigate the mechanism underlying the decreased
insulin levels in thDISC1 mice, we first determined the
levels of b-cell-specific transcription factors because DISC1
has recently been identified as a transcriptional regulator
of schizophrenia-associated genes in human neural pro-
genitor cells (39). By quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we
found that b-cell-specific transcription factors Pdx1 and
Nkx6.1, as well as insulin, were significantly down-regulated
in islets isolated from thDISC1 mice as compared with
control (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the expression of Neuro-
genin 3, a critical transcription factor for endocrine dif-
ferentiation and survival early in development (40), was
not changed. Decreased expression of b-cell-specific

 transcription factors could underlie the decreased insulin
secretion and subsequent glucose intolerance in thDISC1
mice. In support of this, targeted disruption of the Pdx1
gene leads to diabetes in mice, whereas partial down-
regulation leads to decreased insulin expression and se-
cretion and predisposes b cells to apoptosis (41–43).
However, in addition to pancreatic b cells, the INS2
promoter that drives thDISC1 expression shows some de-
tectable expression in brain (44). We did not observe any
detectable expression of thDISC1 in the brain (data not
shown); however, to dissociate any potential effects of
DISC1 disruption in the brain, we performed perifusion
analysisonisletsisolated fromthDISC1 mice.Wefound that
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased when
comparing equivalent numbers of size-matched islets from
thDISC1 and control mice (Fig. 5B), indicating an effect
of DISC1 disruption on insulin secretion independent of
the brain.
thDISC1 transgenic mice exhibit decreased
proliferation and increased apoptosis of b cells
Another factor that could contribute to low insulin levels
would be an effect of DISC1 disruption on b-cell pro-
liferation and/or apoptosis. To first test the effect of
truncated DISC1 expression on b-cell proliferation, we
used newborn animals because proliferation remains high
during the postnatal period, thus improving our ability to
measure changes in proliferation rate. Indeed, overnight
BrdU incorporation was significantly decreased in b cells
expressing thDISC1, but not in a cells that lacked trans-
gene expression (Fig. 6A, B). We next assayed for b-cell
apoptosis, and found that TUNEL staining in b cells from
newborn thDISC1 mice was also increased (Fig. 6C). De-
creased proliferation and increased apoptosis could also
contribute to the deceased insulin secretion and glucose
intoleranceobserved inthDISC1 mice.However,decreased

 b-cell numbers cannot account for the decreased insulin
secretion observed in isolated islets, where equivalent
numbers of size-matched islets from thDISC1 and control
mice were used (Fig. 5B). Therefore, together our data
indicatethat DISC1 is important for bothproliferation and
survival of b cells, as well as glucose stimulated insulin
secretion.
DISC1 regulates proliferation and apoptosis of b cells
through GSK3b activity
To determine the mechanism by which DISC1 regulates
proliferation of b cells we used specific siRNAs to deplete
DISC1 in INS 832/13 insulinoma cells (Fig. 7A). Because
DISC1 regulates proliferation of progenitor neurons by
direct binding of GSK3b and inhibition of its activity (19),
we tested whether DISC1 plays a similar role in b cells. A
well-known readout of GSK3b kinase activity is the
phosphorylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of
b-catenin(45).Weshowthatbothactive/dephosphorylated
and total levels of b-catenin were reduced in DISC1-
depleted b cells by Western analysis (Fig. 7A) and immu-
nofluorescence (Fig. 7B), and that b-catenin levels were
partially restored with the GSK3b inhibitor, SB-216763
(Fig. 7A). These results are consistent with an increase in
active GSK3b with DISC1 depletion, which coincides with
the observed decrease (Fig. 7A) in the inactive phospho-
Ser9 (p9) formof GSK3b (46, 47). Cyclin D1, a well-known
b-catenin target that promotes cell cycle progression, was
also decreased (Fig. 7A). Although treatment with a spe-
cific GSK3b inhibitor restored the levels of p9-GSK3b
and b-catenin in DISC1-depleted cells, the levels of cyclin
D1 were not significantly changed (Fig. 7A), indicat-
ing a different mechanism for the down-regulation of
cyclin D1.

 To investigate the mechanism of DISC1’s role in b-cell
survival, we again used siRNA technology to deplete DISC1
in vitro. We observed an increase in apoptosis as deter-
mined by FACS-based quantitation of Annexin-positive
cells (Fig. 7C) and sub-G0/G1 (,2 N) dead cells (Fig. 7D).
The cell survival was partially rescued by treatment with a
specific GSK3b inhibitor (Fig. 7D). Thus, the increase in
b-cell death we observed with DISC1 depletion may be a
consequence of GSK3b activation, as previously reported
in primary neuronal cultures (48, 49).
Induction of thDISC1 in adult animals results in
glucose intolerance that can be rescued by
GSK3b inhibition
Because expression of thDISC1 throughout the pre- and
postnatal period disrupted glucose homeostasis (Figs. 3
and 4), we asked if a similar phenotype occurs when
thDISC1 is expressed postdevelopment in adult animals.
Adult transgenic animals were induced with DOX; after 2
mo, thDISC1 animals showed glucose intolerance (Fig. 8A).
Because in vitro GSK3b inhibition was able to rescue the
effects of DISC1 depletion on the regulation of GSK3b
(Fig. 7A) as well as cell death (Fig. 7D), we asked if in vivo
GSK3b inhibition could rescue the glucose intolerance of
thDISC1 mice. In the following 1 wk, DOX-induced thDISC1
mice were additionally treated every day with 4 injections of
GSK3b inhibitor (2 mg/kg, i.p.); glucose tolerance of these
thDISC1 animals was restored and comparable to that of
vehicle-treated thDISC1 mice on control diet (Fig. 8B). Our
data, in vitro and in vivo showed that activation of GSK3b by
disruption of DISC1 and its deleterious effects on pancre-
atic b-cell survival and function can be rescued by treat-
ment with a specific GSK3b inhibitor.
DISCUSSION
Given that individuals with severe mental illness such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder also have higher rates
of metabolic syndrome and diabetes than the general
population (5) and that DISC1, a well-known associated
geneforpsychiatricdisorderslocalizestopancreas(12),we
set out to determine whether DISC1 plays a role in pan-
creatic b cells. We have identified DISC1 as a novel regu-
lator of b-cell function. Our in vivo studies with a mouse
model expressing dominant-negative thDISC1 demon-
strate that DISC1 disruption decreases proliferation and
increases apoptosis in b cells of newborn mice, and adult
mice have reduced levels of plasma insulin and are glucose
intolerant. However, to further ensure that our studies of

 DISC1 function in b cells were not influenced by the
contribution of the nervous system, we performed addi-
tional in vitro analyses using 2 different approaches. First,
using insulinoma cell lines with siRNA-mediated knock-
down of DISC1, we demonstrated that DISC1 depletion
resulted in increased apoptosis of b cells, consistent with
our studies in newborn mice. Furthermore, DISC1 de-
pletion caused a decrease in active b-catenin, an indicator
of decreased cell proliferation, which was rescued by
GSK3b inhibition. Second, we isolated pancreatic islets
from our thDISC1 mice, and showed by in vitro perifusion
that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced
compared with equal numbers of islets from control cells.
Importantly, not only do these studies exclude any poten-
tial CNS effects, they also demonstrate that b-cell function
is impaired using 2 completely different methodologies to
disrupt DISC1, namely, siRNA-mediated depletion and
transgenic expression of a dominant-negative truncation.
Together with our finding that DISC1 expression is en-
riched in fetal and human pancreatic b cells and ducts,
these data indicate that DISC1 could play an important
function in human b-cell function and survival. Indeed,
these findings illustrate an emerging principle where in-
congruous coprecipitation of disorders such as schizo-
phrenia and diabetes can now be explained by parallel but
independent dysfunction of a single protein in different
tissues—brain and islets. A global DISC1 knockout rat has
recently become available (SAGE Labs, Boyertown, PA,
USA),and it will be interesting toseehow b-cell function in
these animals compares with our b-cell-specific dominant-
negative DISC1 mouse model.
At the cellular level, our data suggest normal DISC1-
mediated inhibition of GSK3b activity promotes b-cell
proliferation via preservation of b-catenin, as well as
b-cell survival and insulin secretion via appropriate
maintenance of Pdx1 levels (see model in Fig. 9A).
GSK3b has many cellular targets, and we propose that
during early neonatal stages when proliferation of b
cells is robust, DISC1 inhibition of GSK3b and the
subsequent stabilization of b-catenin and Pdx1 could
play important roles in the proliferation and survival,
respectively, of b cells. Later in life, when proliferation
may not be the primary mechanism of compensating
for increased insulin demand, the action of Pdx1 on
insulin expression and secretion could play a more
important role. In support of this, reduction of Pdx1
was shown to reduce b-cell compensatory insulin se-
cretion response to insulin resistance in adult mice
(50).
Because inhibition of GSK3b plays an important role in
pancreatic b-cell function and survival (51, 52), relieving
inhibition of GSK3b by disrupting DISC1 could account
for our observed deleterious b-cell phenotypes (see model
in Fig. 9B). In support of this, glucose intolerance and

DISC1 inhibits GSK3b leading
to accumulation of b-catenin and

of DISC1 allows activation of
GSK3b that, in turn, phosphor-
ylates b-catenin and Pdx1 for
degradation; this leads to de-
creased proliferation and insulin
secretion and increased apopto-
sis of pancreatic b cells.

 apoptosis of DISC1-disrupted b cells was rescued by treat-
ing thDISC1 mice or DISC1-depleted cells with a specific
GSK3b inhibitor. This direct role of DISC1 in glucose ho-
meostasis could explain the increased rates of T2D among
people with DISC1-related psychiatric illnesses (53, 54).
Diabetes is a multivariable disease and several interacting
variables must coalesce for a patient to become diabetic
(55, 56). Individuals with mental illnesses may be predis-
posed to developing T2D due to lifestyle and to genetics,
including disruption of DISC1; antipsychotic drug treat-
ments that are known to cause a further increase in T2D
could tip the balance toward disease. To our knowledge,
this is the first identification of a pleiotropic role, in neu-
rons and b cells, for DISC1 gene whose disruption was
previously associated only with mental illnesses. In this
study, we now show that DISC1 also plays a novel role in
pancreatic b-cell survival and function and provide a mo-
lecular link for a prevalence of diabetes in individuals with
psychiatric disorders.
