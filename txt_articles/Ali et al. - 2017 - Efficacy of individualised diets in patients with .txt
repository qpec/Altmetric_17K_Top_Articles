Irritable bowel syndrome
AbsTrACT
background Patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) are often placed on diets guided by food intolerance 
assays, although these have not been validated. We 
assessed the effects of individualised diets in patients with 
IBS guided by a leucocyte activation test.
Methods This is a parallel-group, double-blind, 
randomised controlled trial of 58 adults with IBS seen at 
an academic health centre in Northeast USA. Peripheral 
venous blood was analysed using a leucocyte activation 
test; individual foods were reported to produce positive 
or negative results. Participants were randomised to 
a 4-week diet with either individualised guidance to 
eliminate foods with positive assay results and allow 
foods with negative assay results (intervention), or with 
individualised guidance, matched in rigour and complexity, 
to eliminate foods with negative assay results and allow 
foods with positive assay results (comparison). The 
primary outcome was between-group differences in the 
IBS Global Improvement Scale (GIS). Secondary outcomes 
included reductions in IBS Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) 
scores and increases in IBS Adequate Relief (AR) and 
Quality of Life (QOL) scores. An aptamer-based proteomic 
analysis was conducted in strong responders.
results The intervention group had significantly greater 
increases in mean GIS score after 4 weeks (0.86 vs 
comparison; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.67; p=0.04) and 8 weeks 
(1.22 vs comparison; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.22; p=0.02). The 
intervention group also had significantly greater reductions 
in mean SSS score at 4 weeks (–61.78 vs comparison; 
95% CI –4.43 to –119.14; p=0.04) and 8 weeks (–66.42 
vs comparison; 95% CI –5.75 to –127.09; p=0.03). There 
were no significant differences between intervention and 
comparison groups in mean AR or QOL scores. A reduction 
in neutrophil elastase concentration was associated with 
reduced symptoms.
Conclusions Elimination diets guided by leucocyte 
activation tests reduced symptoms. These findings could 
lead to insights into the pathophysiology of IBS.
Trial registration number NCT02186743.
IntroductIon
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent 
and costly condition that can be disabling. In 
the USA, 8%–20% of the population meets 
diagnostic criteria, with female predom-
inance,1 with direct and indirect costs 
estimated at $1.5 billion annually.2 Over 60% 
of patients with IBS report symptoms related 
to food, such as symptomatic exacerbations 
(ie, food sensitivity/intolerance),3 4 and 
improvement when avoiding these foods.5–8
Assessing food intolerance in clinical 
practice is challenging. The double-blind, 
placebo-controlled food challenge is the 
summary box
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Over 60% of IBS patients report symptoms related 
to food, such as symptomatic exacerbations and 
improvement when avoiding these foods.
 
► Previous trials of elimination diets for 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) found 
varying levels of efficacy, with trials of the 
low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, 
disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet 
demonstrating promise.
 
► No previous randomised trials have been published 
assessing the efficacy of leucocyte activation 
testing in IBS.
What are the new findings?
 
► Statistically significant benefits were seen in 
global improvement and in symptom severity in a 
4-week diet guided by leucocyte activation testing 
compared to a matched sham diet.
 
► This study provides novel data suggesting that a 
leucocyte activation test can be used to develop 
an individualised diet that can alleviate symptom 
burden in IBS, distinct from other types of dietary 
interventions.
 
► A broad proteomic screen found a reduction 
in plasma elastase in strong responders to the 
intervention diet.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
 
► This study provides data suggesting that a 
leucocyte activation test can be used to develop 
an individualised diet that can alleviate symptom 
burden in IBS. These dietary changes may be less 
restrictive than a low-FODMAP diet and may result 
in better long-term adherence.

gold standard for diagnosing food intolerance.9 10 While 
clinically valid, this approach is rare outside academic 
contexts and largely impractical for practising clinicians.4
A number of commercially available blood tests claim 
to diagnose food intolerance,11 and most remain largely 
unvalidated.12 Among the more highly used13 are leuco-
cyte activation tests, which are used to guide elimination 
diet recommendations, although no rigorous studies of 
leucocyte activation tests are in Medline-indexed jour-
nals. These tests are generally considered unproven diag-
nostic methods for detecting food allergy.14 In a survey of 
unconventional medical laboratory tests,13 some respon-
dents noted that leucocyte activation testing is anecdot-
ally reported to be of greater clinical value than other 
unconventional food intolerance assays.
Leucocyte activation tests culture peripheral blood 
leucocytes with standardised extracts of individual foods, 
utilising flow cytometry to detect morphological changes 
in leucocytes after exposure to food extracts, claiming to 
identify intolerance to the foods. Clinicians use these tests, 
then make targeted food elimination recommendations.
Here, results are reported from a rigorously controlled 
trial of a leucocyte activation test, adequately powered to 
assess clinical response in participants with IBS, compared 
with a matched, individualised, sham diet. The null 
hypothesis was that that there would be similar responses 
to either elimination diet (consistent or inconsistent with 
test results), with no scientific basis to presume differen-
tial between-group effects.
Methods
ethics and trial registration
The study was approved by the Human Investiga-
tion Committee of Yale University (New Haven, 
Connecticut, USA). Data were collected at the Yale Center 
for Clinical Investigation outpatient facility. All partic-
ipants provided written informed consent and received 
financial compensation. The protocol was registered on 
 
clinicaltrials. 
gov prior to enrolment (NCT02186743).
study design
This was a parallel-group, randomised clinical trial with 
two arms allocated in a 1:1 ratio. The primary aim was to 
assess the efficacy of individualised 4-week diets in partic-
ipants with IBS:
intervention—elimination diet consistent with leuco-
cyte activation test results; versus comparison—elimi-
nation diet systematically inconsistent with test results, 
matched in rigour and complexity.
Participants
Adults 18–75 years of age meeting Rome III criteria for 
any subtype of IBS15 with active symptoms (SSS ≥150) 
were enrolled. Concurrent IBS medications (eg, fibre, 
antispasmodics, antidepressants, loperamide, and so on) 
and behavioural treatments were allowed if dosing was 
stable for 30 days prior to enrolment.
Exclusion criteria included a history of inflammatory 
bowel disease, abdominal surgeries, radiation proctitis, 
recent (within 30 days) antibiotic use, and current use of 
opioids/other analgesics (with the exception of non-ste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs), anticoagulants, or immu-
nosuppressives. Also excluded were persons unlikely to 
make dietary changes, who were operationally defined as 
eating outside of the home more than five times per week.
Interventions
Leucocyte activation test
On enrolment, a single sample of de-identified periph-
eral venous blood preserved in 3.8 sodium citrate was 
sent for testing at a commercial laboratory (Alcat Test; 
Cell Science Systems, Deerfield Beach, Florida, USA) via 
overnight courier. Leucocytes were separated from whole 
blood using a density gradient at high-speed centrifuga-
tion, and a neutral buffer and autologous plasma were 
added back to the cells, which were then aliquoted into a 
round-bottomed test wells or control wells containing 200 
test food extracts or neutral buffer, respectively, and then 
incubated for 15 min, with 100 rpm rotation, at 37°C. Cell 
counts were performed using the electric sensing zone 
method (Coulter or impedance method) of particle 
sizing, distributing each cell into one of 256 size chan-
nels, thus creating a size/volume distribution curve, or 
histogram for each control and each test sample. Differ-
ences in morphology curves categorise foods as (1) severe 
intolerance, (2) moderate intolerance ((1) and (2) denoted 
as positive in this study), (3) mild intolerance (denoted as 
mild), or (4) acceptable foods/no reaction ((4) denoted as 
negative in this study).
Diet assignment
Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive the 
following:
1. Intervention: individualised diet consistent with test 
results.
Participants were instructed to avoid positive foods 
for the diet period (4 weeks). Participants were allowed 
to consume mild foods every fourth day, and negative 
foods ad libitum, consistent with usual clinical practice. 
Dietary instruction was delivered at baseline (in person; 
30–45 min) by a blinded registered dietitian, and after 2 
weeks (telephone; 15 min). After 4 weeks, participants 
were instructed to consume an ad libitum diet.
2. Comparison: individualised sham diet systematically 
inconsistent with test results.
Participants were instructed to avoid negative foods for 
the diet period (4 weeks). Participants were allowed to 
consume mild foods every fourth day and positive foods ad 
libitum. Dietary instruction was identical to the interven-
tion group.
Assessments
Participants were assessed at baseline (the day prior to 
starting the diet), 4 weeks (the final day of the diet), and 
at 8 weeks postbaseline.

Assessment of global improvement, symptom severity, adequate 
relief, quality of life, and adherence
Primary outcome
The IBS Global Improvement Scale (GIS) is a vali-
dated assessment of IBS symptoms using a 7-point Likert 
scale ranging from ‘substantially worse’ to ‘substantially 
improved’ widely used in clinical trials.16 Improvement in 
the IBS-GIS is associated with satisfactory control of urgency, 
firmer stools, fewer stools per day, and fewer days with 
incomplete evacuation compared with non-responders.
The IBS Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) is a psychomet-
rically valid and reliable instrument that contains five 
100-point scales assessing the severity of abdominal pain, 
the frequency of abdominal pain, the severity of abdom-
inal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and inter-
ference with quality of life.17–23
The IBS Adequate Relief (AR)24 is a single-item ques-
tion asking ‘Over the past week have you had adequate 
relief of your IBS symptoms?’
The IBS Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire25 is a 
34-item measure assessing the degree to which IBS inter-
feres with quality of life. Each item is rated on a 5-point 
Likert scale and a linear transformation yields a 0–100 
score, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.25
Adherence
Participants were queried about the number of times 
restricted foods were consumed during the course of the 
4-week intervention.
No changes were made to trial outcomes after the trial 
commenced.
Proteomic analysis
After initial data analysis, six intervention participants 
with the highest magnitude of improvement in the SSS 
(strong responders) were selected for proteomic analysis. 
Baseline and 4-week plasma samples were sent to Soma-
Logic (Boulder, Colorado, USA) for analysis of 1128 
proteins.
sample size
Based on results from Kaptchuk and Lembo assessing 
responses to placebo interventions in IBS,19 an analytic 
sample of 46 participants was calculated with 80% power 
to detect a between-group difference of 1.1 points 
(SD=1.3) on the GIS (two-sided; α=0.05). Accounting 
for up to 25% attrition, 29 participants per arm were 
recruited (total n=58).
randomisation
Participants were randomised in permuted blocks (size of 
4) using the OnCore Enterprise Research System (Forte 
Research Systems, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Alloca-
tion was concealed by restrictions in the software to all 
blinded study personnel.
Blinding and dietary instruction
All participants, investigators, and study personnel 
(besides 
the 
coordinator 
who 
assigned 
dietary 
interventions) were blinded to allocation status. 
Participants were assessed individually. Data analysis 
commenced after all study assessments were complete 
and the database locked.
Dietitians maintained blinding to study arm using the 
following procedures:
On enrolment, blood was drawn for eligibility screening 
and leucocyte activation testing. Test results were elec-
tronically transmitted to the coordinator (TRW), and 
eligible participants were then scheduled for dietary 
instruction. Prior to the dietitian visit, the coordinator 
electronically sent the dietitian each participant’s list of 
positive, mild, and negative foods.
In order to create a sham diet control, a standardised 
food substitution list was developed prior to enrolment. 
Substitute foods were matched by type (fruits, vegeta-
bles, legumes, grains, spices, and so on) and ubiquity 
(common/uncommon foods). Second-choice, third-
choice, fourth-choice, and fifth-choice foods were noted 
in the substitution list to account for instances where 
preceding foods were restricted. Substitution choices 
were limited to the 200 items in the test food bank 
(see online supplementary appendix 1 for the food 
substitution list).
For participants randomised to the comparison diet, 
the food substitution list was used to develop an elimina-
tion diet that matched the rigour (ie, number of foods to 
eliminate) and complexity (range of foods) as the ‘true’ 
test results. Thus, the list of foods designated as positive 
or mild to the dietitian was actually foods from the nega-
tive list in the participants’ test results. The dietitians 
counselled all participants in the same manner without 
knowledge of true test results. Thus, each participant 
received an individualised elimination diet either consis-
tent with (intervention) or systematically inconsistent 
with (comparison) test results.
statistical methods
Analyses were conducted using Stata V.14.1. Individual 
changes between baseline and week 4 were computed 
for each outcome and tested for whether the mean 
change observed in the intervention and comparison 
groups differed significantly (α=0.05) using independent 
t-tests. Distributions of change across time were tested 
for equality between the intervention and comparison 
groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The t-tests have 
more statistical power, while the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests are more robust to non-normality of the underlying 
distributions. Effect sizes (Cohen’s D) were calculated 
as the mean difference in changes across time between 
groups divided by the pooled SD of changes across time. 
The same analyses were performed for changes between 
baseline and week 8. Analyses followed the intention-to-
treat principle.
Proteomic data were analysed by paired t-tests (α=0.05). 
To account for multiple comparisons, a Benjamini-Hoch-
berg correction with a false detection rate at 0.3 and 
significance threshold at 0.05 was applied.

results
Participants were recruited from Connecticut from

ments, flyer postings, and electronic media, including 
 
clinicaltrials. 
gov and university ( 
yalestudies. 
org) sites.
Of 126 volunteers screened, 68 were not eligible or 
declined to participate. Fifty-eight participants were 
randomised between July 2014 and November 2015. One 
participant, randomised to intervention, declined to 
participate as new employment resulted in a lack of time 
to participate. Two other participants (randomised to 
intervention) left due to participant burden (one prior 
to week 4 and one between weeks 4 and 8). All 29 partic-
ipants in the comparison group completed the study. 
Thus, 56 participants (97%) remained for the week 4 
analysis and 55 participants (95%) remained for the week 
8 analysis. The final follow-up visit (8 weeks) occurred in 
January 2016. The trial ended once the predetermined 
sample size (58) was achieved. There were no missing 
data (see figure 1).
Baseline characteristics are in table 1 showing no signif-
icant between-group differences. Table 2 notes the most 
frequently restricted foods. Participants were restricted 
from a mean of 13 foods (SD=6), out of 200 possible test 
foods. During the 4-week dietary period, participants 
consumed restricted foods at a mean of 2.46 (SD=4)

times. Overall rates of adherence are statistically indistin-
guishable (p=0.26) between intervention and comparison 
groups. Seven participants consumed restricted foods 
more than four times, and three participants consumed 
restricted foods more than eight times.
Primary outcome: IBs-GIs
Intention-to-treat analysis
The intervention diet resulted in a statistically signifi-
cant change over time in GIS between the intervention 
(n=27) and comparison (n=29) diet at 4 weeks with a 
mean between-group difference equal to 0.86 (p=0.04, 
95% CI 0.05 to 1.67). The significant improvement in 
the GIS in the intervention group persisted at 8 weeks 
with the mean between-group difference equal to 1.22 
(p=0.02, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.22) (see table 3 and figure 2).
secondary outcomes
Intention-to-treat analysis
Both the intervention and comparison groups demon-
strated significant improvements from baseline in SSS, 
with the intervention group experiencing significantly 
larger improvements. The mean between-group differ-
ence in change since baseline at 4 weeks was –61.78 
(p=0.04, 95% CI –4.43 to –119.14), and the mean 
between-group difference in change since baseline at 8 
weeks was –66.42 (p=0.03, 95% CI –5.75 to –127.09)  (see 
table 3 and figure 2).
There were no statistically significant between-group 
differences in the change over time for IBS-AR and 
IBS-QOL at 4 weeks or 8 weeks (see table 3 and figure 2).
No adverse effects related to the intervention were 
reported. Two instances of syncope related to blood draw 
occurred.
Ancillary analyses
Levels of adherence
To assess whether dietary adherence affected outcomes, 
the sample was divided into higher adherence (eating 
restricted foods two or fewer times) and lower adherence 
(eating restricted foods three or more times) over the 
course of the 4-week intervention period, resulting in an 
approximately 50–50 distribution (median-split analysis). 
No significant differences were found between the adher-
ence subsamples and the full sample.
Effect of dietitians
The original study dietitian (AS) had a leave of absence 
during the course of the study (after 35 participants), and 
was replaced by a second dietitian (SK). Effects were esti-
mated separately for participants counselled by each dieti-
tian. No significant differences between dietitians were 
found.

Sensitivity analysis
To account for potential bias induced by non-random 
attrition, effects of the treatment were re-estimated on 
the entire baseline sample under the assumption that 
those who discontinued treatment would have expe-
rienced zero effect of the treatment. One individual 
dropped out of the study before week 4, and two dropped 
out before week 8. Between-group differences in GIS and 
SSS remained statistically significant.
Placebo effects
As placebo effects have been shown to increase with more 
invasive interventions,26 27 we assessed the effects of the 
number of restricted foods versus change in the IBS-SSS 
(our continuous measure). No association was found 
between the number of restricted foods and change in 
IBS-SSS scores in both the intervention group (p=0.70) 
and in the control group (p=0.82).
Proteomic data
In paired analysis of the 12 plasma samples, concen-
trations of 87 of the 1128 proteins were significantly 
different (p<0.05) between baseline and week 4 samples. 
To correct for multiple comparisons, these data were anal-
ysed with a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.28 After this 
correction, a significant pre–post difference in a single 
protein (neutrophil elastase) was found to be reduced in 
strong responders.
dIscussIon
In this study, statistically significant benefits were seen 
in the primary outcome of global improvement, as well 
as in symptom severity in a 4-week diet guided by leuco-
cyte activation testing compared with a matched sham 
diet29 in an adequately powered sample of 58 partic-
ipants with IBS. While quality of life and adequate 
relief both improved, statistically significant between-
group differences were not seen. Both groups demon-
strated significant improvements from baseline. Thus, 
a substantial intervention effect and a substantial 
placebo effect were seen, with the intervention effect 
significantly better than placebo in global improvement 
and symptom severity, with effect sizes30 of medium 
magnitude.
Furthermore, between-group differences in global 
improvement and symptom severity remained statisti-
cally significant at 8 weeks postbaseline (4 weeks after 
the dietary intervention), as participants noted adhering 
to aspects of the elimination diet (during the ad libitum 
phase between weeks 4 and 8) consistent with achieving 
symptomatic relief.

These findings reject the null hypothesis and show 
that a diet guided by leucocyte activation testing results 
in demonstrable clinical improvement in IBS. These 
clinical results, associated with a reduction in plasma 
neutrophil elastase, have implications for better under-
standing the role of food intolerance and the patho-
physiology of IBS.
Strengths of this study include an adequately powered,3
1 randomised design32 33 with a matched comparison diet 
utilising a rigorous blinding strategy, validated outcome 
measures, an intention-to-treat analysis,34 high levels of 
dietary adherence, and minimal dropout, all of which 
can reduce bias in making valid statistical inferences.31 
Sample size calculations were based on a previous study 
of placebo interventions,19 thus accounting for substantial 
placebo effects seen in IBS clinical trials.35 Furthermore, 
mechanistic correlates and sensitivity analyses corrob-
orated the intention-to-treat findings. This study was 
designed, conducted, and analysed completely indepen-
dent of the sponsor,36 and preregistered on  
ClincialTrials.

Limitations of this study include self-report instru-
ments for clinical outcomes, an ethnically homo-
geneous population, as well as a relatively short 
intervention period of 4 weeks. This 4-week interven-
tion was chosen to maximise internal validity, as adher-
ence to behavioural interventions wanes over time,38 
and previous trials have found significant changes in 
these outcomes over a 3-week period.19 Furthermore, 
other factors that can affect IBS symptoms were not 
accounted for, such as the gut microbiota,39 psycho-
logical stress,8 39 40 or travel.41 Nevertheless, adequate

demonstrated significantly larger between-group improvement than the comparison group in the (A) GIS at 4 
weeks (1.93 vs 
1.07; ES 0.55, p=0.04; n=56—primary endpoint) and 8 
weeks postbaseline (1.81 vs 0.59; ES 0.63, p=0.02; n=55), and (B) SSS

weeks (116.4 vs 50.0; Effect Size (Cohen's D) (ES) 0.57, p=0.03) postbaseline. 
No significant between-group differences were seen in the (C) AR and (D) QOL scales. Relative to baseline, all outcomes 
improved in both groups at 4 
weeks and 8 
weeks.

randomisation controls for potential confounding 
factors, known and unknown.42
While the prior literature assessing specific elimi-
nation diets for IBS has shown conflicting results,4 43 
a dietary pattern restricting fermentable oligosaccha-
rides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols 
(FODMAPs) has shown promise as an efficacious, 
although burdensome, dietary intervention for IBS.4 44 
Indeed, the magnitude of improvement in SSS scores 
(mean 121 points in intervention participants, 60 
points in comparison participants) compares favour-
ably with participants consuming a low-FODMAP diet 
(mean change of 78 points) in a recent randomised 
trial.45 In contrast to the broad restrictions imposed 
by the low-FODMAP diet, this study finds significant 
effects from individualised diets based on results from 
a leucocyte activation test. As seen in table 2, there 
was infrequent overlap between test-positive foods and 
high-FODMAP foods,46 as well as no significant differ-
ences in the frequency of restriction of high-FODMAP 
foods between intervention and control groups. 
Future studies can directly assess clinical response 
based on leucocyte activation testing compared with 
low-FODMAP diets.
This study provided an opportunity to further investigate 
biological factors associated with IBS. Diet may impact the 
course of IBS through effects on the microbiome, immune 
activation, intestinal permeability,8 47 brain–gut interac-
tions,8 39 40 and motility.7 Indeed, some study participants 
reported exacerbations of IBS symptoms during stressful 
periods. The breadth of these potential factors makes it 
difficult to develop a hypothesis-based approach that would 
investigate one or a few biological factors. To circumvent 
this challenge, a broad proteomic screen was used that 
found a reduction in plasma elastase in strong responders 
to the intervention diet.48
This finding is of interest as elastase is widely distrib-
uted in innate immune cells, including in neutrophils 
and mast cells. Mast cells are of particular interest as they 
have been shown to be increased in close approximation 
to nerves in the colonic mucosa.49 50 Mast cell mediators 
such as tryptase and histamine are increased in the colon 
of patients with IBS.49 Elastase can cause tissue damage 
and also disrupt tight junctions, which may increase 
intestinal permeability.51 The validity of the clinical 
results is not dependent on the proteomic data, which 
may however provide mechanistic insights. Future studies 
can investigate mechanistic factors in greater detail.
In a related study, positive responses in leucocyte acti-
vation testing (in healthy controls) were associated with 
greater magnitudes of DNA release, but not myeloperox-
idase release, mediated by protein kinase C and nuclear 
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) pathways. Furthermore, test-positive foods 
were associated with CD63 upregulation in eosinophils 
compared with test-negative foods.52
It is noteworthy that participants consuming a 
sham diet improved from baseline. Non-specific, 
contextual, and placebo responses tend to be high 
in IBS.35 53 54 Indeed, Kaptchuk and Lembo demon-
strated the utility of open-label placebos in IBS.19 
Placebo interventions involving a therapeutic ritual, 
such as an elaborate dietary change, may affect 
subjective symptomatology to a greater extent versus 
simple placebos, such as pills.26 27 It is also possible 
that comparison group outcomes reflect a combina-
tion of beneficial placebo combined with deleterious 
effects of consuming presumably intolerant foods in 
the elimination diet. Nevertheless, between-group 
differences in the GIS and SSS were approximately 
double in the intervention group compared with 
the comparison group. Furthermore, we found no 
evidence to indicate that the rigour of the interven-
tion (number of restricted foods) was associated with 
greater improvements.
In summary, this study provides data suggesting that a 
leucocyte activation test can be used to develop an indi-
vidualised diet that can alleviate symptom burden in 
IBS. These dietary changes may be less restrictive than 
a low-FODMAP diet, and may result in better long-term 
adherence. Future studies, ideally multisite and in larger 
samples, can assess comparative effects of other dietary 
interventions in IBS, the effects of restricting specific 
foods, and whether dietary changes guided by leucocyte 
activation testing affect other conditions.
