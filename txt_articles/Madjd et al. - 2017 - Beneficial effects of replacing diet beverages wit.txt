Abstract 
3 
Aims: To compare the effect of replacing diet beverages (DBs) with water or continuing 
4 
to drink DBs, in Type 2 diabetes during a 24 week weight loss program. The primary 
5 
endpoint was the effect of intervention on weight over 24 weeks. The main secondary 
6 
endpoints included anthropometric measurement, glucose and fat metabolism during 
7 
the 24 weeks. 
8 
Methods: 81 Overweight and obese women with type 2 diabetes, who usually 
9 
consumed DBs in their diet, were asked to either substitute water for DBs or continue 
10 
drinking DBs five times per week after their lunch for 24 weeks (DBs group), while they 
11 
were on a weight loss program.  
12 
Results: Compared with the DBs group, the Water group had a greater decrease in 
13 
weight (Water: -6.40 ± 2.42 kg; DBs: -5.25 ± 1.60 kg; P =0.006), BMI (Water: -2.49 ± 
14 
0.9 2
 kg/m2; DBs: -2.06 ± 0.62 kg/m2; P =0.006), FPG(Water: -1.63 ± 0.54 mmol/l; DBs: - 
15 
1.29 ± 0.48 mmol/l, P=0.005), fasting Insulin (Water: -5.71 ± 2.30 m lU/ml; DBs: -4.16 ± 
16 
1.74 m lU/ml, P=0.011), HOMA IR (Water:-3.20 ± 1.17; DBs: -2.48 ± 0.99, P=003) and 
17 
2h post prandial glucose (Water: -1.67 ± 0.62 mmol/l; DBs: -1.35 ± 0.39 mmol/l; 
18 
P=0.027) over the 24 weeks. However, there was no significant group * time interaction 
19 
for waist circumference, lipid profiles and HbA1C within both groups over 24 weeks. 
20 
Conclusion: Replacement of DBs with water after the main meal in patients with type 2 
21 
diabetes obese adult women may lead to more weight reduction during a weight loss 
22 
program.

Introduction: 
24 
There is evidence that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is associated positively 
25 
with BMI (1, 2). Obesity also complicates the management of type 2 diabetes by 
26 
increasing insulin resistance and blood glucose concentrations (3). In contrast, weight 
27 
reduction is an effective goal for overweight/ obese type 2 diabetes in order to improve 
28 
glycemic control (4). 
29 
In the last decades, the amount of energy consumed in beverages has increased, 
30 
providing a significant source of daily energy intake (5). Also, to promoting weight gain, 
31 
a higher intake of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with the 
32 
development of metabolic syndrome and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (6). On 
33 
the other hand, diet beverages (DBs) are of interest as dietary tools which offer sweet 
34 
taste without energy (7-9). 
35 
Nutritionists usually advise individuals who wish to lose weight to raise their water 
36 
consumption (10, 11). Conversely, many obese and diabetic patients believe that they 
37 
can drink DBs during a diet plan without any deleterious effects on their weight and 
38 
diabetes management (12). A previous review indicated that DBs might be the ideal use 
39 
of intense sweeteners in the setting of a weight control plan, while they have been 
40 
shown to be associated with some modest weight loss (13). Thus, it would be expected 
41 
that Type 2 diabetic patients could consider DBs in order to help them to lose weight 
42 
and control their blood glucose.  
43 
Nevertheless, SSBs and DBs intake were associated with a significantly higher risk of 
44 
type 2 diabetes (14) and a subsequent observational study revealed that consumption 
45 
of DBs was significantly associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (15). More

experimental study is needed to determine the effect of DBs consumption on the 
47 
management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. 
48 
Recently, we investigated the effect of replacing DBs with water, on promoting weight 
49 
reduction in obese adults without diabetes who were on a hypo-energetic diet (16). The 
50 
Water group had a greater decrease in weight and insulin resistance over the 24 weeks 
51 
of study compared with DBs group. Due to beneficial effects of substitution of DBs with 
52 
water in overweight/ obese women, it would be interesting to repeat this protocol in 
53 
those with Type 2 diabetes.  
54 
Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of replacing DB 
55 
consumption with water during a comprehensive 24-wk weight-loss program on body 
56 
weight as a primary outcome, along with abdominal adiposity, carbohydrate and lipid 
57 
metabolism as secondary outcomes, in overweight and obese women with Type 2 
58 
diabetes.

Materials and Methods  
60 
Study participants 
61 
Obese female adults with diabetes were selected between April 2015 and June 2015 
62 
from the participants attending NovinDiet Clinic, Tehran, Iran to lose weight and control 
63 
diabetes.  Inclusion criteria were  female, 18-50y of age, BMI = 27 -35 kg/m², 
64 
6.5<HbA1C<7.2 and only taking Metformin to control their diabetes , self-reported 
65 
habitual consumers of DBs who were willing to introduce a dietary change to lose 
66 
weight which might include changing beverage consumption.   
67 
All participants were required to be nonsmokers, free of established cardiovascular 
68 
diseases, stroke, liver diseases, kidney diseases, depression, cancer or autoimmune

disease. Subjects included those who were able to keep an adequate 4- day food 
70 
record and who demonstrated readiness to participate safely in daily physical activity 
71 
(PA). 
72 
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation during the previous 6 months or planned 
73 
pregnancy in the next 6 months, weight loss ≥10% of body weight within the 6 month 
74 
before enrollment in the study, taking medication to lower lipids/ cholesterol or that 
75 
could affect metabolism or change body weight.  
76 
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of The Digestive Research Institute, 
77 
Tehran University of Medical Science. All subjects provided their signed consent prior to 
78 
study enrollment. This trial was registered at http:/www.clinical trials.gov/ as 
79 
NCT02412774. 
80 
Randomization and Intervention 
81 
The study was a 2-arm, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Eligible participants were 
82 
randomly assigned after baseline measures by using a computer-generated random-
83 
numbers method by the project coordinator with allocation concealed from the 
84 
participants and dietitians until randomization was revealed to the study participants at 
85 
the initial intervention clinic appointment.  
86 
Eighty-one participants who were eligible for the study were randomly assigned to one 
87 
of the 2 groups. All had a 2-wk any artificial sweetener products including diet 
88 
beverages washout period before intervention. The groups were the Water group in 
89 
which subjects replaced habitual post lunch (main meal) intake of DBs with a glass of 
90 
water (250 ml) and in the DBs group subjects were instructed to continue to drink DBs 
91 
once a day (250ml), after their main meal (lunch) 5 times a week. Both groups were free

to drink water as beverage at other times, but were not allowed to have DBs 
93 
consumption. In addition, both groups were asked not to drink DBs or water during the 
94 
lunch meal and also not to add low calorie sweeteners to beverages such as tea or 
95 
coffee. To control the effects of menstrual cycle on measurements, participants started 
96 
the study at the same phase of their menstrual cycle. Bi-weekly visits to the dietitian 
97 
were required in order to promote adherence to the hypo-energetic diet and beverage 
98 
substitution.   
99 
Dietary and activity programs 
100 
NovinDiet Clinic is a private weight loss clinic which uses an integrated approach 
101 
(dietary, behavioural, exercise and medical treatments). Subjects who participated in 
102 
this study did not pay clinic fees, were provided the diet beverages for DBs group and 
103 
water for the Water group over the study. In this study the program was designed to 
104 
enable weight loss of 7-10% of starting body weight, at a rate of 0.5-1 kg/week over 24 
105 
weeks. The individual diet programs were based on the individual’s food diary records, 
106 
with gradual adjustment to bring their diet in line with the NovinDiet protocol. PA was 
107 
encouraged; the objective was to gradually increase activity levels to achieve 60 
108 
minutes of moderate activity on five days/ week. Predominant behavior change 
109 
strategies applied included stages of change, goal setting, self-monitoring with food 
110 
diaries and PA (17, 18).  
111 
At bi-weekly sessions, resources were provided as home booklets for each subject to 
112 
record adherence to the diet protocol. During the intervention period, subjects 
113 
completed the feedback form regarding their adherence to the diet. Subjects also had

support from a consultant, if needed.   
116 
Outcomes 
117 
To assess the effect of replacing DBs with water outcomes were collected at the 
118 
baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks (except height which was taken only at the screening 
119 
visit). 
120 
Anthropometric measurements 
121 
Body weight was taken to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital calibrated scale (Omron 
122 
Health Care, Hoofdorp, Netherland), whilst subjects wore light clothing, without shoes. 
123 
Body height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm by using a wall mounted stadiometer 
124 
(SECA, Hamburg, Germany) while participants were barefoot and in a free-standing 
125 
position. Waist circumference (WC) was measured with a rigid measuring tape and 
126 
recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. WC was measured at the smallest horizontal 
127 
circumference between the ribs and iliac crest (the natural waist), or, in case of an 
128 
indeterminable waist narrowing, halfway between the lower rib and the iliac crest (19). 
129 
BMI was calculated from measured weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in 
130 
meters.  
131 
Blood sample measurements 
132 
Blood samples of all subjects were taken after overnight (8-10 h) fasting, between 07:00 
133 
and 09:00, at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks for biochemical, cellular and hormonal 
134 
measurements. Fasting blood samples were collected by venipuncture according to a 
135 
standard protocol. Blood samples were taken while the subjects were in a sitting 
136 
position, according to the standard protocol, and were centrifuged at 2000g at room

temperature within 30–45 min. Antecubital venous blood samples for two-hour 
138 
postprandial plasma (2hpp) glucose were taken 2 hours after ingesting 75g of glucose 
139 
according to the standard method(20). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2hpp plasma 
140 
glucose levels were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric method. Insulin was 
141 
measured by using a radioimmunoassay with 125I-labeled human insulin and a human 
142 
insulin antiserum in an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) (Biosource, Dorest, Belgium) 
143 
with a gamma-counter system (Gamma I; Genesys). Insulin resistance was evaluated 
144 
by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (21).  
145 
Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1C) was measured by a colorimetric method after an initial 
146 
separation by ion exchange chromatography (Biosystem, Barcelona, Spain). 
147 
 Biochemical analysis of the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-
148 
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was carried out on a Selectra E auto analyzer (Vita 
149 
Laboratory, Netherlands) following standard procedures of the Pars Azmoon diagnostic 
150 
kits (Iran). The LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula(22). 
151 
LDL cholesterol = TC – HDL cholesterol + (TG ÷ 2.2)  
152 
Self-reported dietary assessment  
153 
Energy and macronutrient intake at baseline, weeks 11 and week 23 was analyzed by 
154 
Nutritionist IV software (version 4.1; Hearst). 
155 
Statistical analyses 
156 
Baseline values of cardiovascular risk factors (including weight, waist circumference, 
157 
LDL-c, HDL-c, TC, FPG, TG, fasting insulin, HOMA IR, HbA1C, 2hpp glucose data) were 
158 
compared between the Water and DBs groups using unpaired t-tests.

At baseline, distribution was normal for all variables. All participants who were randomly 
160 
assigned and completed an initial assessment were included in the final results by using 
161 
an intention-to-treat analysis. Multiple imputations with the use of linear regression were 
162 
used to impute missing values from 24 wk and were based on the assumption that data 
163 
were missing at random.  
164 
The primary analysis was an intent to treat linear mixed effect, which assessed at 12 
165 
and 24 weeks. These models, which included time, treatment, a time by group 
166 
interaction and the respective baseline value as principal explanatory variables for all 81 
167 
participants. The per-protocol analysis was also done for the outcomes .the results from 
168 
per-protocol analysis were also similar to those of the intent to treat analysis in direction 
169 
and significance. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as 
170 
mean ± SD unless otherwise stated. Associations between variables were assessed by 
171 
simple correlational analyses (Pearson’s r). All statistical analyses were performed 
172 
using SPSS 22.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., USA). 
173 
The primary outcome addressed in this study was the difference in body weight loss 
174 
during the 24 week weight loss program. The power calculation was based on the 
175 
previous studies (16, 23) (α = 0.05, power = 0.85), which were performed based upon 
176 
expected differences in weight loss between weight loss diet groups (2.0 ± 2.5 kg) to 
177 
determine the targeted final sample size (n = 56). Anticipating a dropout rate of 30% the 
178

124 patients with type 2 diabetes, who believed that they were eligible and expressed 
182 
an interest in participating in the study, were evaluated for eligibility by a physician. After 
183 
evaluation, 81 subjects were recruited and 65 subjects completed the 24-week 
184 
intervention (with 80% retention rate, Figure 1).  The remaining 81 subjects gave 
185 
written consent and then randomly 41 subjects were allocated to the water and 40 to the 
186 
DBs group.  After starting the intervention, a total of 11 subjects dropped out because 
187 
they did not wish to continue or they moved away from the area.   2 subjects left the 
188 
study as they became pregnant. The remaining 3 subjects did not give any reason for 
189 
their withdrawal. 
190 
At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences in age, physical 
191 
characteristics or biochemical measurements between the groups or between those 
192 
who completed or did not complete the study once recruited (Table 1). 
193 
Body weight 
194 
As shown in Table-2, there was a significant weight reduction in each group after 24 
195 
weeks (P<0.001). There was also a significant difference in weight reduction between 
196 
the two groups after 24 weeks (P=0.006, Figure 2).  
197 
BMI and Waist circumference 
198 
BMI reduction in each group was in the expected direction with significant effects over 
199 
24 weeks for both groups (P< 0.001). However, the decline in BMI was greater in the 
200 
water group than the DBs group after 24 weeks (P=0.006).  
201 
In both groups, waist circumference had decreased after 24 weeks of intervention 
202 
(P<0.001) with no significant difference in WC effects between the two groups after the 
203 
intervention (P=0.833).

Glucose metabolism measurement 
205 
Fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, 2 hour postprandial (2hpp) glucose, Hb 
206 
A1C  and HOMA-IR all decreased over time in both groups (P < 0.001). Also between 
207 
group differences were significant for all variables (Table 2).   
208 
There was a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose level changes between the 
209 
two groups after 24 weeks (P=0.005). In terms of 2hpp, during the 24 weeks of 
210 
intervention between group changes was significant (P=0.027). 
211 
There was a significant difference in insulin resistance between the two groups over 24 
212 
weeks (P =0.003) but no significant improvement in HbA1C in the water group compared 
213 
with the DBs group over the 24 weeks (P =0.149).  
214 
Furthermore, Fasting serum insulin concentration decreased significantly over time, with 
215 
significant differences between the two groups after 24 weeks (P=0.011). 
216 
Food intake measurement 
217 
At baseline, there was no significant difference in energy intake. Estimated energy 
218 
intake measurements showed a significant reduction over time in both groups (P < 
219 
0.001 for time effect). As shown in Table 3, there was a significant group*time 
220 
interaction for total energy intake over 24 wk (P = 0.005). 
221 
In addition, macronutrient intake measurements showed no significant differences 
222 
between the 2 groups at baseline. However, there was a greater carbohydrate deficit in 
223 
the water group than in the DB group during the 24 wk of intervention (group * 
224 
time interaction, P < 0.001, Table 3)

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of DBs and water 
227 
consumption after lunch, as a main meal, on weight loss and also characteristics of 
228 
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in overweight and obese women with type 2 diabetes 
229 
attending a weight loss program for 24 weeks. The results of present study showed that 
230 
drinking water may lead to more weight loss, a greater improvement in fasting plasma 
231 
glucose, insulin sensitivity, measured by HOMA IR and 2hpp glucose levels compared 
232 
with consumption of DBs in women with Type 2 diabetes.  
233 
To our knowledge, this study was the first randomized controlled trial in women with 
234 
Type 2 diabetes which has assessed the impact of excluding DBs consumption on 
235 
weight loss, during a voluntary weight reduction program, for 24 weeks. 
236 
Weight gain and obesity are strongly related to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes 
237 
while moderate weight loss improves glycaemic control (1). All of the subjects in our 
238 
weight loss plan had a significant weight loss. This would have been predicted given the 
239 
characteristics of the prescribed treatment plan which included energy restriction, PA 
240 
instruction and regular patient visit and consultation in the clinic. In other rigorous clinic-
241 
based behavioral lifestyle adjustment programs, 5–10% weight losses have been 
242 
reported at 6 months (24-26) which is similar to the weight losses reported in our study. 
243 
These comprehensive weight loss methods are more constantly effective in comparison  
244 
with others recommending small but theoretically sustainable lifestyle changes that can 
245 
be made to improve health (27). Furthermore, the present study showed a major 
246 
reduction in waist circumference and significant improvements in cardio metabolic risk 
247 
characteristics in both groups over 24 weeks, as would be predictable given the weight 
248 
loss observed. Although the results indicated a significant effect of replacing DBs with

water on weight loss during 24 weeks, it seems that the 24 weeks of intervention was 
250 
not enough to reveal any significant effects on waist circumference (WC) as a related 
251 
metabolic variable. Further longer term studies measuring metabolic effects, including 
252 
WC, and more accurate assessment of body fat change using DEXA Scanning would 
253 
be required.Previous intervention studies have attempted to investigate the effects of 
254 
water and DBs consumption on weight loss with inconsistent results. In a recent study, 
255 
the effects of either water or DBs consumption in comparison to SSBs, without any 
256 
hypoenergetic diet, and only  having  group behavioural counselling to promote 
257 
adherence to beverage substitution were compared(28). The authors failed to find any 
258 
significant differences in weight loss between water and DBs. In another  study(29), 
259 
drinking water and diet beverage was compared in subjects undergoing cognitive 
260 
behavior therapy only, with no specific dietary restrictions. The result of this study 
261 
showed a greater impact on weight loss with DBs compared with water. On the other 
262 
hand, in a study by Dennis et al. (30), subjects who were randomly assigned to drink 
263 
pre-meal water lost about 2 kg more weight than subjects on an  hypoenergetic diet 
264 
alone. It should be noted that the protocol of the last study (30) was not similar to our 
265 
study in that subjects in both groups had either water or DBs after their meal rather than 
266 
before the meal, which is more representative of normal behaviour in this group. 
267 
Furthermore, none of these studies involved obese or overweight subjects with Type 2 
268 
diabetes. Following our recent study (16) indicating the beneficial effects of replacing 
269 
diet beverages with water on weight loss and insulin sensitivity of obese and overweight 
270 
adults, our goal was to investigate whether these effects may be seen in women with 
271 
Type 2 diabetes.

In our current study, participants drinking water after their lunch over 24 weeks lost 1.16 
273 
kg more than those in the DBs group, which is in agreement  with the result of our 
274 
previous study(16) where the  overweight/ obese but otherwise healthy women in the 
275 
water group lost 1.2 kg more than the DBs group. In contrast, our results are 
276 
inconsistent with other studies which indicated either no significant change in effects on 
277 
weight loss between water and DBs (28) or reported greater impact on weight loss with 
278 
DBs compared with water(29). Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that these studies 
279 
had different experimental designs, for example not including any weight loss plan(28) 
280 
or have cognitive behavioral therapy alone for weight loss during a shorter period of 12 
281 
weeks(29). Also, the volume of beverage, the time of drinking and the type of 
282 
participants were different in these studies.  
283 
The results of our latest study may have arisen because the effect of replacement of 
284 
DBs with water may lead to better adherence to the weight loss diet in the Water group.  
285 
It has been hypothesized that artificial sweeteners may raise the hedonic desire for 
286 
sweetened and more energy dense foods (31-33). Also in our current study, the effect 
287 
of replacement of DBs with water on weight loss reflected better adherence to the 
288 
weight-loss diet in the water group. The greater reduction in energy intake in water 
289 
group compared with DBs group resulted in more weight loss in this group than DBs 
290 
group. Moreover, more reduction of carbohydrate consumption in the water group than 
291 
in the DBs group might support greater weight loss in the water group. However, in 
292 
order to elucidate the mechanism that might explain the better weight loss in the Water 
293 
group compared with the DBs group, longer term studies are required.

Like our study on healthy overweight/obese women (16), our present study in women 
295 
with Type 2 diabetes revealed a better improvement in fasting insulin sensitivity, ( 
296 
HOMA IR), in the Water group over the 24 weeks. there was also a beneficial impact of 
297 
on fasting glucose and HbA1C in the Water group,  although our previous study in 
298 
women without diabetes(16) did not show any effects on these carbohydrate 
299 
metabolism characteristics. But these outcomes seen on diabetic patients were 
300 
consistent with the results of the recent epidemiological study indicating daily diet 
301 
beverage consumption was associated with impaired glucose control(32). 
302 
These results may have clinical implications, showing that if overweight/ obese people 
303 
with Type2 diabetes use a weight loss plan, they may have better improvements in 
304 
glycemic characteristics and weight loss if they drink water instead of DBs.  These 
305 
findings would reinforce the recommendations given in popular weight loss programs 
306 
that the obese and overweight patients who are keen to lose weight should increase 
307 
their water intake (10, 11). On the other hand, most obese people consider that they 
308 
can drink diet beverages during a low- energy diet without any harmful effects on their 
309 
weight management, and whilst they do still lose weight, the magnitude of the weight 
310 
loss may be greater if they avoid DBs completely. Whilst the present study is consistent 
311 
with the current guideline for increasing water consumption for better diabetes control, 
312 
our results do not entirely support the recommendations indicating no deleterious 
313 
effects of diet beverage on diabetes control(34). Since the consumption of diet soda is 
314 
higher among people with diabetes than those without (35), the potential implications of 
315 
studies such as ours needs further investigation.

The main strength of this study is that it was a randomized, outpatient clinical trial, whilst 
317 
participants were selected from participants wished to lose weight and control their 
318 
blood sugar and included middle-aged overweight and obese women who were able to 
319 
comply with weight-loss plan; hence, they demonstrated that they were motivated to 
320 
adhere to the weight-loss diet protocol (36). Thirdly Subjects who participated in this 
321 
study did not pay clinic fees and were provided the diet beverages for DBs group and 
322 
water for the Water group which were incentive for regular by-weekly visits with the 
323 
dietitian when compliance could be encouraged in both groups.  
324 
On the other hand, there are some limitations. First of all, even though the sample size 
325 
 providing sufficient power to distinguish statistically significant effects in the key 
326 
outcome variables, the sample was not representative of the general population,  
327 
mainly as it did not include men. In addition, due to the possible effects of the time of 
328 
the beverage consumption, we only asked the participants to drink either water or diet 
329 
beverages after the lunch in order to cover this confounding factor. Also we did not 
330 
record the fluid intake of participants as it may influence satiety. Moreover the energy 
331 
expenditure was not verified which would affect weight loss.  Lastly, although our 
332 
weekly follow up by phone call and fortnight clinic visit to measure dietary compliance of 
333 
the subjects, the present study 
334 
 only relied upon subjective report of storing and consuming the water and DBs which is 
335 
not as accurate as objective methods for measuring their compliance. 
336 
In conclusion, replacing DBs with water consumption would appear to impact 
337 
beneficially on weight loss, BMI, FPG and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese
