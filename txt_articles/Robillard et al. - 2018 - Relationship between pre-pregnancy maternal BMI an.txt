Abstract
Background: There is a peculiar phenomenon: two separate individuals (mother
and foetus) have a mutually interactive dependency concerning their respective
weight. Very thin mothers have a higher risk of small for gestational age (SGA)
infants, and rarely give birth to a large for gestational age (LGA) infant. While
morbidly obese women often give birth to LGA infants, and rarely to SGA.
Normal birthweight (AGA) infants (>10th and <90th centile of a neonatal
population) typically have the lowest perinatal and long-term morbidity. The aim
of the current study is (1) to determine the maternal body mass index (BMI)
range associated with a balanced risk (10% SGA, 10% LGA), and (2) to

 investigate the interaction between maternal booking BMI, gestational weight gain
(GWG) and neonatal birthweight centiles.
Methods: 16.5 year-observational cohort study (2001e2017). The study population
consisted of all consecutive singleton term (37 weeks onward) live births delivered at
University’s maternity in Reunion island, French Overseas Department.
Findings: Of the 59,717 singleton term live births, we could define the booking
BMI and the GWG in 52,092 parturients (87.2%). We had 2 major findings (1)
Only women with a normal BMI achieve an equilibrium in the SGA/LGA risk
(both 10%). We propose to call this crossing point the Maternal Fetal Corpulence
Symbiosis (MFCS). (2) This MFCS shifts with increasing GWG. We tested the
MFCS by 5 kg/m2 incremental BMI categories. The result is a linear law:
opGWG (kg) ¼ �1.2 ppBMI (Kg/m2) þ 42 � 2 kg
Interpretation: IOM-2009 recommendations are adequate for normal and over-
weighted women but not for thin and obese women: a thin woman (17 kg/m2)
should gain 21.6 � 2 kg (instead of 12.5e18). An obese 32 kg/m2 should gain
3.6 kg (instead of 5e9). Very obese 40 kg/m2 should lose 6 kg.

1. Introduction
Knowing the optimal gestational weight gain (GWG, from conception to birth)
among the annual 135 million of human pregnancies worldwide is considered to
be one of the “Holy Grail” for maternity health care providers, neonatologists and
epidemiologists. Extensive literature exists on the subject with, in background, the
current international cornerstone which is the 2009-IOM recommendations [1] based
on the WHO-BMI classification [2] underweight women (before pregnancy) <18.5
kg/m2 should have a GWG between 12.5 and 18 kg, normal weight, 18.5e24.9 kg/
m2, a GWG of 11.5e16 kg, overweight, 25e29.9 kg/m2, a GWG of 7e11.5 kg, and
obese >30 kg/m2 a GWG of 5e9 kg. Evolution of ideas on the subject are well re-
ported in a recent paper [3]: besides the eternal well accepted social dogma of “eating
for two”, medicine tended to recommend a GWG of 7 kg per pregnancy before 1945
[3]. The experience of the 1944 Dutch famine lead to the liberalization of this view to
evolve toward the real first international guidelines for GWG in 1990 [4]. Finally,
with the increasing worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity over the last
4-5 decades, revised IOM guidelines were proposed in 2009 [1], more tailored to
maternal booking BMI in line with the WHO BMI.
Since then, multiple papers debated two main controversies: 1) are the IOM guide-
lines, made mainly on Caucasian population, adequate for other population such as
Asian women for example? For Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scholars, the answer

 is clearly no [5, 6, 7, 8], and they even propose an Asian classification where over-
weight would begin at 23kg/m2, and not at 25 [6, 7]). These authors also concluded that,
theIOM recommendationsaretoolow for underweight women[5,6,7, 8].2)theobesity
problem: are the 5e9 kg recommendations also adequate for obese pregnant women?
This is in fact the research core of different meta-analysis [9, 10, 11, 12]: for obese
women shouldn’t we accept a GWG below 5 kg, or even a gestational weight loss [9,
13, 14, 15]? The puzzle is further complicated by the fact that the American College
of Obstetrics and Gynecology committee has in 2013 stated that if an obese woman is
gaining weight below the recommendation, but has an appropriately growing fetus,
thepotentialbenefitsmightbemorethanthosegainingweightwithintheguidelines[15].
Further, there is a growing consensus to differentiate within obese women 3 class of
obesity [9, 16, 17]: class 1 (30e34.9 kg/m2), class 2 (35e39.9 kg/m2) and class 3 (40
kg/m2 and over). The debate is “should super obese women lose weight during preg-
nancy?”. According to Kiel et al [13], class 1 women should gain between 4.5 and 11
kg (vs IOM 5e9 kg, all obese), class 2 women should gain between 0 and 4 kg, and
class 3 women should lose between 1 and 4 kg, while for Marguerison Zilko et al
[18] or Oken et al [19] these class 3 women should lose 7 kg. Swank et al on their
side studied specifically the “super obese”, i.e. >50 kg/m2 [20], and reported that in
these women gaining weight below the recommendations (therefore less than 5 kg),
was not associated with an increase of pre-term births or low birthweight, while there
was a significant reduction of birthweight more than 4,000 g. While Kapadia et al
[11], in a recent meta analysis, concluded that gestational weight loss should not
be advocated in general for obese women.
Whatever, the central tenet of all these analyses is that all authors had chosen as pri-
mary outcomes of their studies: small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational
age (LGA) newborns. Taking SGA-LGA (international consensus to study this sub-
ject) as somewhere a final end-point seems rational considering that the finality of a
pregnancy being to have a normal birthweight (AGA) infant, the gestational weight
gain of the mother is completely linked to this goal. Both SGA and LGA are well
known to have some immediate morbidities, but moreover long-term effect on the
future life of the individual [21, 22, 23].
The 2 aims of this study are: First, to establish in term deliveries the “natural ten-
dency” of SGA-LGA association per maternal BMI and, second to establish if there
is an association between GWG and the 10% crossing point SGA-LGA for each
maternal BMI category.
2. Material and methods
From January 1st, 2001, to 30 June 2017, the hospital records of all women delivered
at the maternity of the University South Reunion Island (ap. 4,300 births per year)

 were abstracted in a standardized fashion. All data were entered into an epidemiolog-
ical perinatal data base which contained information on obstetrical risk factors,
description of deliveries and neonatal outcomes. As participants in the French na-
tional health care system, all pregnant women in Reunion Island have their prenatal
visits, biological and ultrasound examinations, and anthropological characteristics
recorded in their maternity booklet. In our term pregnancies the average of prenatal
visits was 9.2 � 2, and 4.2 � 1.7 ultrasounds per pregnancy.
In the general analysis, there were three criteria of exclusion: Preterm births (<37
weeks), multiple births and fetal deaths (in utero fatal deaths, stillbirths and medical
termination of pregnancy).
Small for gestational age (SGA, �10th percentile) and Large for gestational age ba-
bies (LGA, �90th percentile) have been defined by a local curve established from our
perinatal data base [24].
Reunion Island is a French department in the Southern Indian Ocean. The peculiarity
of this tropical region lays in the multiethnic origin of inhabitants [Africa and inter-
mixed population (50%), Europe (27%), India (20%) and China (3%)]. Compared to
Europe and mainland France, there is a younger reproductive population (the mean
age at primiparity is 23 years). Finally, accessibility to maternity services is easy, and
high-quality care is provided free of charge by the French healthcare system.
Epidemiological data have been recorded and analysed with the software EPI-INFO
7.1.5 (2008, CDC Atlanta, OMS), EPIDATA 3.0 and EPIDATA Analysis V2.2.2.183.
Ethics approval: This study analyzing data anonymously was exempt from approval
of institutional review board (Comit�
e de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et
Outre Mer III) and according to French legislation written consent.
3. Results
There were 60,870 term births (37 weeks onward) at the South Reunion maternity
during the 16.5 year period (January 1, 2001eJune 30, 2017). Multiple pregnancies
(N ¼ 508 pregnancies and 1,029 newborns), fetal deaths (in utero N ¼ 108, 13 still
births at term and 3 medical termination of pregnancy) were excluded from further
analysis. The live-birth term population consisted of 59,717 singleton pregnancies.
The final study population consisted of 52,092 patients (87.2%), where we could
define the maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and the Gestational Weight Gain.
1. What is the “natural tendency” of SGA-LGA association per maternal BMI?
All is summarized in Fig. 1: we found that the natural tendency for thin women
(10e14 kg/m2) was to spontaneously have some 25% of SGA babies and some
2% of LGA babies, while on the other side of the spectrum, very obese women

 (40e44 kg/m2) had spontaneously some 20% of LGA and 5% of SGA newborns,
Fig. 1.
In Fig. 1, we see that 1) Only women with a normal BMI achieve an equilibrium in
the SGA/LGA risk (both 10%). We propose to call this crossing point the Maternal
Fetal Corpulence Symbiosis (MFCS).
2) What is the association between GWG and the 10% crossing point SGA-LGA
(MFCS) for each maternal BMI category?
Calculations for the Figures were based on the WHO BMI classification, and the
(<18.5, 18.5e24.9, 25e29.9, 30 and plus) IOM recommendations. However, data
in the tables will be presented using, 5 kg/m2 increments in order to have regular in-
tervals. Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5 show the incidences (%) of SGA-LGA newborns For all
categories of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and GWG. The data clearly showed that
there is a regular shift from the right to the left of the MFCS crossing point beginning
in very thin mothers (10e14.9 kg/m2) to the obese (30e39.9 kg/m2). This shift ap-
pears to be quite regular, and even linear.
In Fig. 6, and Table 3, we tested all these items in very obese women: we could not
achieve to have a SGA-LGA MFCS crossing point in our 1,087 very obese women.
To test the possible linearity of the MFCS point drift per maternal pre-pregnancy cat-
egories, we recalculated all these variables with regular BMI intervals of 5 kg/m2,
Tables 1, 2, and 3. The results are shown in the Tables and are summarized in
Fig. 7: weight gains corresponding to MFCS crossing points describe a linear curve

4. Discussion
Notthstanding hundreds of studies and meta-analysis made on the subject [5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26], no consensus has
been reached regarding the optimal GWG for different maternal BMI categories
[9, 10, 11, 12].
Our data show that the so-called SGA-LGA crossing point (10% SGA and 10%
LGA) happens “naturally” for normal weighted women (20e24 kg/m2), Fig. 1.
This is a surprising findings, as the very definition of SGA (10th percentile of a given
neonatal population) and LGA (90Th percentile) have never been designed to corre-
spond in any matter with maternal BMI. The fact that this 10% SGA/LGA point cor-
responds to a given maternal BMI category suggest that there is a kind of biological
maternal-foetal connection. This was proposed by Kapadia et al [9, 11] who wrote
that it should have “a graded relationship between maternal weight gain (or loss) and
infant size” [11].
The 2nd main findings was that for all categories of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and
GWG, we did notice that there is a linear shift from the left of the MFCS crossing
point beginning in very thin mothers (10e14.9 kg/m2) to the obese (30e39.9
kg/m2), Tables 1, 2, and 3. The fact that this linear association between maternal

 pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG has now finally been deciphered will greatly facilitate
an individualized approach when advising women about their optimal GWG without
needing to put them in fixed categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese,
very obese, super obese etc.). This will enable maternity care providers and the
pregnant women to agree on the optimal GWG, e.,g. “you have a BMI of 17.5
kg/m2, our common goal is that you should try to gain 21 kg during this pregnancy
(�2 kg), versus “your BMI is 33 kg/m2, you need to try to restrict your weight gain
to 2.4 kg”. While very obese women e.g. 38 kg/m2, should try to lose 3e4 kg. These
findings should resolve the ongoing debate among researchers facing populations
with a high incidence of obesity, many of these were already claiming that these
women should lose weight during pregnancy [13, 18].
We would like to encourage other populations (particularly Asian population repre-
senting 25e30% of mankind), to establish their own maternal BMI-GWG associa-
tion. Our formula is valid for all pre-pregnancy maternal BMI including obesity
class II (<40 kg/m2). For the “super obese” BMI > 40 kg/m2 we could not establish
the MFCS crossing point (Fig. 6, Table 3). This could partially be due to the fact that
BMI > 40 is rare our population.: we had in our population “only” 1,087 women
over 40 kg/m2 with 243 women who had lost weight in that category (and only
21 women having lost more than 10 kg). If we were to extend extend the formula
to these women, for example a woman with a 47 kg/m2 BMI should lose 14 kg.
We tested in Table 4 specifically those women who should have lost weight accord-
ing to our equation (i.e. 36 kg/m2 and over), and results seem to be in that line.
Further studies in populations with a high rate of super obesity are required to check
Fig. 7. Crossing points (MFCS) of SGA and LGA curves per pre-pregnancy maternal corpulence and
gestational weight gains at term.

 if there is a MFCS crossing point in these pregnant women [16, 20, 27], and hope-
fully to arrive at individualized gestational weight loss guidelines. Maternal obesity
is associated with increased rates of many complications during pregnancy for the
mother, the fetus and the neonate, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal
malformations, the risk of stillbirth and fetal overgrowth with as a result increased
birthweights. Different factors of maternal metabolism may contribute to higher
fat mass in neonates born to women with obesity. In a recent study by Mitanchez
et al, [28] the authors compared non-diabetic and diabetic obese women and showed
that they had the same level of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR at 37
weeks and the same level of HbA1c at delivery. They furthermore demonstrated
that pregnant women with obesity who have normal glucose tolerance still had a
higher glucose profile (glycemia and HbA1c) than pregnant women of normal
weight, thereby exposing the fetus to relative hyperglycemia. The authors concluded
that regardless of gestational diabetes, deregulation of glucose metabolism is present
in obese women and may contribute to fat mass in the neonates. A fascinating
finding of this study by Mitanchez et al was that these effects were largely limited
to girls.
5. Conclusion
Future perspectives: Without too much efforts different populations can establish
their own local linear curve, moreover if they have also their specific centile curves
for their SGA and LGA infants. Establishing such curves would allow easy devel-
opment of smart-phone applications entering weight and the height of a woman,
will inform the pregnant woman and her care provider about her individual optimal
GWG, and probably also the GWG for the last trimester of pregnancy (we are
testing, but the GWG is also a linear curve from 22 weeks gestation to 40 weeks).
