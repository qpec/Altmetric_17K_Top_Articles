Abstract
Dietary protein is a potentially modifiable risk factor for fracture. Our objectives were to assess the 
association of protein intake with incident fracture among older men and whether these 
associations varied by protein source or by skeletal site. We studied a longitudinal cohort of 5875 
men (mean age 73.6, SD=5.9 years) in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. At

 baseline, protein intake was assessed as percent of total energy intake (TEI) with mean intake from 
all sources=16.1%TEI. Incident clinical fractures were confirmed by physician review of medical 
records. There were 612 major osteoporotic fractures, 806 low-trauma fractures, 270 hip fractures, 
193 spine fractures, and 919 non-hip non-spine fractures during 15 years of follow-up. We used 
Cox proportional hazards models with age, race, height, clinical site, TEI, physical activity, marital 
status, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal surgery, smoking, oral corticosteroids use, alcohol 
consumption, and calcium and vitamin D supplements as covariates to compute hazard ratios (HR) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI), all expressed per unit (SD=2.9%TEI) increase. Higher protein 
intake was associated with a decreased risk of major osteoporotic fracture (HR=0.92 [95% CI: 
0.84, 1.00]) with a similar association found for low-trauma fracture. The association between 
protein and fracture varied by protein source; e.g. increased dairy protein and non-dairy animal 
protein were associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture (HR=0.80 [95% CI: 0.65, 0.98] and 
HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.97], respectively), while plant-source protein was not (HR=0.99 [95% 
CI: 0.78, 1.24]). The association between protein and fracture varied by fracture site; total protein 
was associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture (HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.95]), but not 
clinical spine fracture (HR=1.06 [95% CI: 0.92, 1.22]). In conclusion, those with high protein 
intake (particularly high animal protein intake) as a percentage of TEI have a lower risk of major 
osteoporotic fracture.

Introduction
Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are a significant health care burden in older 
adults. Between 1986 and 2005, the annual incidence of hip fractures among those over 65 
years of age was 9.6 per 1,000 for women and 4.1 per 1,000 for men with subsequent 
mortality of nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 3 men.(1) Hip fractures are also associated with 
decreased health-related quality of life(2) and substantial health care costs.(3,4) The Institute 
of Medicine has formulated an acceptable macronutrient distributions range for adults, 
which specify that protein intake among adults should range between 10–35% of total 
energy intake (TEI).(5) This range is not based on an assessment of protein requirements to 
maintain optimal musculoskeletal health among older adults. Causal links between protein 
intake and bone health are contentious due to many conflicting reports. Some of this 
discordance might be related to protein source (animal vs. plant, dairy vs. non-dairy). In 
particular, several studies (all in women) have observed heterogeneity by source of 
protein.(6–8) A recent study assessing protein and fracture risk in both men and women 
found no statistically significant heterogeneity between protein and fracture risk by source of 
protein.(9) The same study found that the association between protein and bone mineral 
density (BMD), a key risk factor for fracture, did vary by source of protein. A plausible 
explanation for this finding might well have been the insufficient number of fracture 
outcomes to observe heterogeneity by source, particularly in men. Another potential 
explanation for the discordant fracture results could be heterogeneity of effect by skeletal 
site of fracture. A recent study of Beasley et al in postmenopausal women found that high

 protein intake was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture and forearm fracture, but was 
not associated with a lower risk of clinical spine fracture.(10)
Thus, our primary objective was to assess the association of protein intake overall and by 
dietary source (dairy, non-dairy animal, and plant) with fracture risk (major osteoporotic, 
low-trauma, and skeletal site-specific) among older men. Our secondary objective was to 
assess potential mediation by other factors including BMD. Our primary hypothesis was that 
higher protein intake would be associated with a lower risk of fracture, with possible 
attenuation of effect with increasing intake. We also hypothesized that the effect of protein 
intake would depend on source of intake, likely due to the mediation by total hip BMD.
Material and Methods
From 2000 to 2002, the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study enrolled 5994 
ambulatory men aged 65 years and older living in one of six U.S. metropolitan areas. The 
baseline clinical exam included height (Harpenden stadiometer), weight (balance beam or 
electronic scale), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight using the formula BMI = weight 
(kg)/height (m)2. The study sample for this analysis included 5875 men who completed a 
food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline with fewer than 10 percent missing 
responses, who had plausible reported energy intake (>500 kcal/d), and who had no missing 
data on covariates used in the main analysis (see Figure 1). Further details concerning study 
cohort recruitment and methods have been published elsewhere.(11,12) All participants gave 
written informed consent; the study was conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration, 
and ethics approval was granted through institutional review boards at the respective study 
centers.
Protein Intake
Participants completed a modified version of the original Block FFQ at study baseline.(13) 
The FFQ asked 69 individual food item questions, including an additional 13 questions 
about food preparation and low-fat foods which were used to refine nutrient calculations. 
There were nine categories of frequency responses for foods and beverages and four 
categories of portion size responses. A graphic representation of standard portion sizes was 
included with the questionnaire. Total energy intake, total protein intake, and protein intake 
by source were derived from the responses to the questionnaire by Block Dietary Data 
Systems (Berkeley CA, USA), with dietary reference data from the United States 
Department of Agriculture Database for Standard Reference for Version 12 and the 1994–
1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals database. We considered the 
following subcategories of intake: protein from dairy products, non-dairy animal protein 
(e.g. meat, fish, poultry, eggs), and protein from plant sources (e.g. legumes, grains, nuts).
Fracture Outcomes
Participants were contacted every 4 months and queried whether they had a fracture. The 
radiographic reports pertaining to the fracture event were obtained and reviewed at the 
MrOS Coordinating Center to adjudicate incident fracture outcomes. For incident spine

 fractures, spine images taken at the time of the clinical encounter were obtained and 
reviewed by the study radiologist, who used the Genant semi-quantitative method to confirm 
that the community imaging study showed an increase of 1 SQ grade in one or more 
vertebrae compared with the study baseline lateral spine radiographs.(14) The main fracture 
outcome was major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical spine, forearm/wrist, or humerus). A 
secondary fracture outcome was low-trauma fracture, excluding those of the head, hands, or 
feet. Low-trauma fractures were defined to be a fractures due to 1) a fall from standing 
height or less; 2) moderate trauma other than a fall (e.g. collisions with objects during 
normal activities); or 3) minimal trauma other than a fall (e.g. turning over in bed). Other 
secondary fractures outcomes were hip fracture, clinical spine fracture, and non-hip, non-
spine fractures (regardless of trauma). Note that the main outcome and the secondary 
outcomes were not mutually exclusive.
Total Hip BMD (Mediator and Secondary Outcome)
Participants had BMD at the hip measured using QDR 4500 fan-beam densitometers 
(Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). The study used standardized procedures for position and 
scanning and certification of machine operators to ensure reproducibility. A set of whole 
body, spine, hip, and linearity phantoms were circulated between centers; however, variation 
between centers was within acceptable limits and no corrections were required.
Other Covariates
Information on demographics, lifestyle, and medical and family history was obtained by 
questionnaire and interview by trained clinical staff. Race/ethnicity was self-identified. 
Participants were classified into current, past, or never smokers. Self-reported alcohol intake 
was divided into four categories: none/occasional (<1 drink/week), light (1–6 drinks/week), 
moderate (7–13 drinks/week), and heavy (≥14 drinks/week). Physical activity was measured 
by computing the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Gait speed was determined 
from the using the best time to complete a 6-meter walk and expressed as m/s. Time to 
complete 5 chair stands was measured and expressed as number of stands/second. Grip 
strength (kg) was measured in four trials (two in each hand) using a handheld Jamar 
dynamometer (Sammons Preston Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL, USA) and maximum grip 
strength was taken to be the maximum of all measures. Those who were unable to perform 
the physical performance tests (gait speed, chair stand, and grip strength) were assigned the 
value 0 in the respective speed or strength measure. Participants were asked to bring all 
current (any use within the past 30 days) prescription medications with them to the clinic. 
All prescription medications were recorded in an electronic medication inventory database 
and matched to its ingredients(s) based on the Iowa Drug Information Service drug 
vocabulary (College Pharmacy, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Information on calcium 
and vitamin D supplement use was determined from supplement questions on the modified 
Block FFQ. Appendicular lean mass was measured by Hologic densitometers (the same 
machines used to determine BMD).
Statistical Methods
We used ANOVA for comparisons of continuous variables by protein intake quartile and chi-
square tests for comparisons of categorical variables by protein intake category. We used a

 time-to-event (Cox) model to determine the association between protein intake and risk of 
fracture. Participants were followed until a fracture, death, loss to follow-up, or end of study 
follow-up, whichever occurred first. We considered age-adjusted and full confounder-
adjusted models. Total protein was the primary exposure variable, while protein intake by 
source (dairy, non-dairy, animal, plant) were secondary exposure variables. Our analysis 
considered protein intake (and protein intake by source) as a percent of total energy intake 
(TEI), while TEI was included as an adjustment variable in all multivariate models to 
account for the correlations between energy intake and the exposure and outcome. We 
assessed all continuous variables for possible non-linearity using higher order terms and 
fractional polynomials. Heterogeneity by source (dairy vs. non-dairy, animal vs. plant) was 
tested by looking at the coefficient of the difference variables (e.g. percent dairy protein 
minus percent non-dairy protein) with threshold p<0.05 with adjustment for all covariates 
previously listed. If this testing indicated heterogeneity, source-specific estimates were 
estimated using a single model including all three protein source variables. We did not 
exclude participants with missing supplement or medication data, but rather used derived 
variables with a separate category for those with missing data. We found that missing data 
for these variables was not in fact associated with either the exposure (protein intake) or 
fracture outcomes. If the source of trauma was unknown, we classified the fracture as low-
trauma, since we presumed that participants would have recall of all high-trauma fracture 
events. We performed a sensitivity analysis repeating the low-trauma fracture analysis and 
excluding the 71 fractures for which there was no recall of associated level of trauma, and 
results were unchanged.
Mediation was assessed using two methods on the sub-cohort with measures for all 
mediators (complete case analysis). Mediation was first informally assessed by including the 
appropriate covariates in the Cox proportional hazards models and looking at the change 
(attenuation) in point estimates. We also performed a second formal mediation analysis to 
estimate direct effects (independent of mediators) and indirect effects (via one or more 
mediators). Figure 2 shows the directed acyclic graph linking exposure, mediator, and 
outcome; in this case the mediator is total hip BMD. The total effect is decomposed into two 
separate components – the direct component which occurs through causal mechanisms other 
than total hip BMD, and the indirect component which occurs through the posited 
mediator(s). The indirect component is a sequential effect, and thus is not null when both 
exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations are not null. We used inverse odds 
ratio weights to measure the direct and indirect effects and used a bootstrap to estimate 
standard errors.(15) The exposure coefficient in such a weighted regression estimates the 
natural direct effect of exposure on the outcome, and indirect effects are identified by 
subtracting direct effects from total effects. Weighting renders exposure and mediators 
independent, thereby deactivating indirect pathways of the mediators. Hypothesized 
mediators of the association of protein intake with fracture risk included BMI, total hip 
BMD, appendicular lean mass, history of falls, and physical performance measures (grip 
strength, usual walking speed, chair stand speed). Total hip BMD was found to be the most 
important mediating covariate with statistically significant indirect effect; therefore, we 
further analyzed the sequential relationship by considering total hip BMD as an outcome in 
a linear regression model. Effect size was defined to be the beta coefficient from a regression

 model where both exposure and outcome were parameterized to have mean=0 and SD=1. 
For comparison purposes, models considering protein by source were parameterized to have 
the same units as for total protein, i.e. 1 unit=2.9%TEI. Several post-hoc sensitivity analyses 
were performed: 1) exclusion of men taking medications likely to impact bone mineral 
metabolism (androgens, androgen-agonists, bisphosphonates), 2) competing risk analysis for 
mortality using Fine-Grey models), 3) explicit inclusion of non-dairy sources of calcium and 
vitamin D (food and supplements), and 4) truncation of analysis at shorter time intervals (5 
and 10 years). Analysis was performed using Stata Version 14.0 (College Station, TX).
Results
Among the cohort of 5875 men, the mean (SD) age was 73.6 (5.9) years, the mean (SD) 
energy intake was 1630 (635) kcal/d, and the mean (SD) total protein intake was 16.1 (2.9) 
%TEI. The distributions (mean [SD]) of protein intake by source as a percent of total energy 
intake were as follows: dairy protein 3.5 (2.0) %TEI, non-dairy animal protein 6.2 (2.9) 
%TEI, and plant protein 6.3 (1.7) %TEI. The same parameters expressed as a percent of 
total protein intake were as follows: dairy protein 22.0% (11.2%), non-dairy animal protein 
37.7% (13.2%), and plant protein 40.4% (11.9%). Baseline characteristics of the study 
sample stratified by total protein intake quartile are shown in Table 1. Participants in the 
higher quartiles of protein intake compared with those in the lower quartiles of protein 
intake were more likely to have post-secondary education and were more likely to report 
moderate/heavy alcohol use. Those in the lower quartiles of intake had slightly lower BMD, 
appendicular lean mass, grip strength, usual walking speed, and chair-stand speed than those 
in the upper quartiles of intake. BMI and smoking did not vary by protein intake quartiles.
Protein and Fracture Outcomes
During a mean follow-up of 10.5–11.2 years (depending on outcome) there were 613 
incident major osteoporotic fractures, 806 low-trauma fractures, 270 hip fractures, 193 
clinical spine fractures, and 919 non-hip non-spine fractures. Unadjusted incident fracture 
rates by protein intake quartile are shown in Figure 3. There was a statistically significant 
trend by quartile of protein intake for major osteoporotic fracture (p=0.048) and hip fracture 
(p=0.001), where those with higher protein intake had a lower fracture incidence. In 
particular those in the highest quartile of protein intake had a hip fracture incidence of 2.91 
(95% CI: 2.20, 3.84)/1,000 person-years whereas those in the bottom quartile of protein 
intake had a hip fracture incidence of 5.27 (95% CI: 4.25, 6.53)/1,000 person-years. Table 2 
shows the association between total protein intake (and by source) and incident fracture 
(major osteoporotic fracture, low-trauma fracture, and site specific fracture). Higher total 
protein intake was associated with a decreased risk of major osteoporotic fracture (HR=0.92 
[95% CI: 0.84, 1.00] per unit=2.9%TEI increase in protein intake) and low-trauma fracture 
(HR=0.92 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.99]). Higher total protein intake was also associated with a 
decreased risk of hip fracture (HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.95]) and with a non-statistically 
significant (p=0.07) decreased risk of non-hip non-spine fracture (HR=0.94 [95% CI: 0.88, 
1.00]), but was not associated with a risk of clinical spine fracture (HR=1.06 [95% CI: 0.92, 
1.22]).

 The association between protein and fracture varied by protein source; e.g. increased dairy 
protein and non-dairy animal protein were both associated with a decreased risk of hip 
fracture (HR=0.80 [95% CI: 0.65, 0.98] and HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.72–0.97], respectively) 
while increased plant-source protein was not (HR=0.99 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.24]).
Potential Mediators of Association of Protein Intake with Fracture Outcomes
We further assessed the extent to which the association between protein intake and fracture 
was mediated by BMI, total hip BMD, appendicular lean mass, falls, and physical 
performance measures (grip strength, usual walking speed, and chair stand speed) in a sub-
cohort of 5598 (95%) men in which these intermediate outcome variables were assessed. In 
the mediation sub-cohort, there were 568 incident major osteoporotic fractures, 753 low-
trauma fractures, 246 hip fractures, 183 spine fractures, and 865 non-hip non-spine fractures. 
Table 3 shows there was an association between protein intake and major osteoporotic 
fracture in the mediation model which decomposed into an estimated (albeit non-significant) 
direct effect (HR=0.93 [95% CI: 0.85, 1.01] per unit=2.9%TEI increase in protein intake) 
and estimated indirect (via 1 or more mediators) effect (HR=0.97 [95% CI; 0.95, 1.00]). A 
similar analysis considering total hip as the sole intermediate variable showed an estimated 
(albeit non-significant) direct effect (HR=0.93 [95% CI: 0.85, 1.02]) and estimated indirect 
(via total hip BMD) effect (HR=0.97 [95% CI; 0.96, 0.99]). The only statistically significant 
direct effects observed were for hip fracture. There was a statistically significant indirect 
effect of total hip BMD for all fracture outcomes, but this effect was strongest for hip 
fracture. The direct effects estimated with inverse odd ratio weighting were nearly identical 
to the estimates from Cox proportional hazards models which included either total hip or all 
mediators as covariates (data not shown).
Protein and Total Hip BMD
Higher total protein intake was associated with higher total hip BMD with effect size 
(beta=0.06, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.09). Similar to the findings for the association of protein intake 
with fracture, the association between protein intake and total hip BMD varied according to 
source of protein. With regards to protein source, higher intake of protein from dairy sources 
was associated with higher total hip BMD (beta=0.10, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.14), as was higher 
protein intake from non-dairy animal sources (beta=0.06, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.08), but higher 
intake from plant sources was not (beta=−0.01, 95% CI: −0.06, 0.04), with all betas 
calculated per unit=2.9%TEI increase in protein intake.
We performed several post-hoc sensitivity analyses. Exclusion of men taking androgens, 
androgen-agonists, or bisphosphonates yielded similar results (difference <0.01 for all sites 
except the spine). For the spine there was a slight change in point estimate (1.04 vs. 1.06) 
which did not affect the overall conclusions. The results of the Fine-Grey competing risk 
analysis were largely concurrent with the main analysis with only a slight attenuation of the 
point estimates, e.g. HR=0.93 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.01) for major osteoporotic fracture and 
HR=0.85 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.96) for hip fracture. We considered auxiliary variables (vitamin D 
from non-dairy foods, calcium from non-dairy foods, vitamin D from supplements, and 
calcium from supplements) but none of these variables were associated with hip fracture. 
Finally, we considered truncation of follow-up. The association between protein intake and

 hip fracture was HR=0.84 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.08) per SD increase when truncated at 5 years 
and HR=0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95) per SD increase when truncated at 10 years.
Discussion
We found that older men with higher protein intake as a percentage of TEI had a decreased 
risk of major osteoporotic, low-trauma, and hip fracture, but not clinical vertebral fracture. 
We did not find evidence of a threshold effect for any of the fracture outcomes. Higher 
protein intake was also associated with higher total hip BMD. These associations varied 
according to source of protein; higher protein intake from animal sources (both dairy and 
non-dairy) was associated with higher hip BMD and lower major osteoporotic and hip 
fracture risk, but higher intake from plant sources was not related to these outcomes. We also 
found that the association between protein and fracture could be decomposed into a direct 
association (independent of major risk factors) and an indirect association (mediated by one 
or more major risk factors). The indirect component was small in magnitude, but statistically 
significant and largely attributable to the serial correlations between protein intake, total hip 
BMD, and fracture risk.
The results are consistent with the larger cohort studies that examined the association of 
protein intake with fracture risk, but do not confirm findings of some other smaller studies. 
In particular, Mussolino et al showed that higher protein intake and higher calcium intake 
were each independently associated with a lower risk of hip fracture based on a population-
based cohort of non-Hispanic white men, concurrent with the present analysis linking source 
of protein (dairy vs. non-dairy) and risk of hip fracture.(16) The fracture site heterogeneity in 
the present study was also consistent with that noted in the Women’s Health Initiative 
(WHI), a large prospective study of US women which determined total biomarker-calibrated 
protein among women and found that protein intake was associated with a decreased risk of 
hip and forearm fracture, but was not associated with the risk of clinical spine fracture.(10) 
Fracture risk factors may vary by skeletal site due to different contributions of cortical vs. 
trabecular bone to bone strength parameters and failure mechanisms. As an example, a study 
of postmenopausal women found several prominent risk factors for hip fracture; in particular 
weight, BMI, and neuromuscular disability were not related to incident spine fracture.(17) 
Thus, it is quite possible in the present case that higher protein intake may preserve lean 
mass and muscle strength, consequently preserving cortical integrity of the proximal femur, 
and that these risk factors are not a key component of vertebral fracture risk.
The present study expands upon a previous paper from the MrOS cohort that reported that 
low protein intake was an independent risk factor for hip fracture in that it considers source 
of intake, longer follow-up and consideration of skeletal site and level of trauma.(18) These 
results are somewhat concordant with results for major osteoporotic fracture and low-trauma 
fracture in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) cohort(9) and hip fracture 
outcomes in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study cohort.(19) The CaMos study did not find 
protein source heterogeneity for fracture outcomes, but did not specifically evaluate hip 
fracture, the fracture site where protein source heterogeneity appeared to be the strongest. 
The Framingham study evaluated hip fracture but was limited by the low total number of 
fractures in men (n=80 in women, n=20 in men).

 Some earlier studies assessing protein and fracture were less clear in identification of an 
association between protein and fracture. One study assessing protein intake and the risk of 
hip fracture in Norwegian men and women was largely inconclusive, but noted an increased 
risk among those with high intakes of non-dairy animal protein intake.(6) Another study 
assessing protein intake among participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (US) also noted an 
increased risk of forearm fractures in women, but found no association for hip fracture.(20) A 
third study assessing the association among US men and women had mixed results; high 
protein intake was associated with decreased fracture risk among men and women ages 50–
69 but not among men and women ages 70–89.(21) The present study did not confirm any of 
these previous results, but might not be entirely inconsistent in view of the markedly 
different target populations and noted heterogeneity by source and outcome in the present 
study.
A novelty of the present study is that it identifies total hip BMD as a key mediator in the 
association between protein intake and fracture. A meta-analysis assessing the relation 
between protein intake and BMD or bone mineral content at the main clinically relevant 
sites found that increased protein intake was associated with increased BMD with 1–2% of 
variation in BMD explained by protein intake.(22) One underlying biologic mechanism 
linking protein intake to BMD is increased calcium absorption. Based on experimental 
studies, Kerstetter et al proposed that there is a biological interaction between protein and 
calcium intake whereby protein increases calcium absorption in the gut.(23) A controlled 
feeding study showed that increasing protein intake from 10% to 20% of TEI increased 
fractional calcium absorption among those with low calcium intake.(24) Greater fractional 
calcium absorption was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in an older cohort of 
women.(25) Calcium protein interactions have been observed in many studies. Of note, 
Dawson-Hughes et al found that higher protein intake was associated with attenuated bone 
loss, but only among those randomized to calcium and vitamin D supplementation.(26) Other 
analyses have shown similar protein-calcium interactions, such as the study of Zhong et al 
that showed protein intake was associated with lower risk of fracture, but only for 
postmenopausal women with total calcium intake of more than 1,200 gram/per day.(27) In 
the study of Dawson-Hughes et al, the addition of calcium and vitamin D (a randomized 
exposure) appears to modify the putative effect of protein intake. Assuming this to be true 
we would expect that dairy vs. non-dairy sources of protein to have a stronger association 
with bone health outcomes such as BMD and fracture as observed in the present study.
Given the pattern of heterogeneity noted in the present study for both BMD and fracture 
outcomes, it is likely that the heterogeneity is due several source-dependent nutrient 
differences. One such difference noted previously is the calcium and vitamin D content of 
dairy products. The second is the different underlying amino acid profiles of the three 
protein sources considered in this study. An experimental study in male rats by Gaffney-
Stromberg et al found systematic differences in markers of bone mineral metabolism specific 
to eight different experimental scenarios (normal vs. high protein, milk protein vs. soy 
protein, ad libitum vs. energy restriction).(28) Energy restriction had a consistent effect on 
gain in body mass with strong secondary effects on markers of bone mineral metabolism. 
Rats assigned to a high protein group had overall lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
bone turnover and increased trabecular volumetric BMD vs. those in a normal protein group.

 Finally, PTH was higher and bone turnover was lower in rats assigned to a milk protein 
group vs. those assigned to a soy protein group. A longitudinal study in men and women 
demonstrated that both low protein intake and low animal-source protein intake were both 
associated with increased bone loss at the lumbar spine and femoral neck.(29) More recent 
results from the CaMos study also confirmed a strong source-specific association between 
protein intake and BMD change whereby high intake of plant protein was associated with 
greater BMD loss, but high intake of protein from animal sources was not associated with 
greater BMD loss.(9) Kerstetter et al showed that supplemental whey protein was not 
associated with change in lumbar spine BMD, but was associated with preservation of fat-
free mass in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.(30) Protein intake has also been shown to 
be related to appendicular lean mass in other studies.(31,32) However, appendicular lean mass 
was not found to be an independent mediating variable in the present analysis, and therefore 
the results of this study are not attributable to this hypothesized mediator. Likewise, protein 
intake has been associated with physical performance measures in a cohort of older 
women(33), but again physical performance itself was not shown to be an independent 
mediating variable in the present analysis.
The strengths of this study are the inclusion of major potential confounders and a large 
sample of community-dwelling older men with a long follow-up and more than adequate 
number of fracture outcomes to detect small effects. We assessed protein intake by source, 
accounting for different nutrient profiles (i.e. micronutrients and distribution of specific 
amino acids) of the three major sources (dairy, non-dairy animal, and plant). We further 
strengthened the analysis by considering intermediate variables that were biologically 
relevant. Finally, we performed several sensitivity analyses which all showed that the main 
results were robust to consideration of medications, non-dairy sources of calcium and 
vitamin D, competing mortality, and truncation of follow-up.
Study limitations include the use of a FFQ at a single point in time vs. a life-course analysis 
to assess long-term dietary intake and its relationship to bone health. FFQs have limitations 
in the assessment of absolute and relative intake with likely bias towards the null. The study 
design was an observational cohort study, and therefore limitations include the possibility of 
selection bias and residual confounding. The generalizability of the present study is limited 
to healthy community-dwelling older men. The cohort was also mostly non-Hispanic white, 
and therefore we were unable to assess potential racial/ethnic differences, and this will also 
limit generalizability. Finally, we were unable in this analysis to assess whether the 
differential effects for dairy vs. non-dairy sources of protein is attributable to the calcium 
(and vitamin D) or due to different amino acid profiles. Milk, yogurt and hard cheese all 
have similar calcium/protein ratios (30–36 mg per gram protein) but have different profiles 
of other nutrients and hence intakes of these items cannot be used to find differential effects 
of calcium vs. protein. Products with substantially different ratios include soft cheese, Greek 
yogurt, and calcium and/or protein fortified dairy products. None of these items was 
specifically queried on the baseline questionnaire, which was a questionnaire designed to 
assess only the most commonly consumed food items.
In summary, we found that protein intake (particularly protein from animal sources) as a 
percentage of TEI is an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for major

 osteoporotic fracture (with the exception of spine fracture). In particular, each 1 SD increase 
in protein intake was associated with an 8% decrease in major osteoporotic fracture risk and 
a 16% decrease in hip fracture risk. To put the association in context for potential 
intervention, 1 SD or 2.9%TEI corresponds to an absolute increase of 12 g protein for those 
with average energy intake in this cohort of older men, or equivalently, 1–2 protein-rich food 
servings per day. These types of dietary interventions could easily be incorporated into an 
older person’s diet.
