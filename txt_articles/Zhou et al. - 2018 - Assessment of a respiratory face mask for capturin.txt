Background: Prevention of infection with airborne pathogens and exposure to airborne particulates and 
aerosols (environmental pollutants and allergens) can be facilitated through use of disposable face masks. 
The effectiveness of such masks for excluding pathogens and pollutants is dependent on the intrinsic ability 
of the masks to resist penetration by airborne contaminants. This study evaluated the relative contributions 
of a mask, valve, and Micro Ventilator on aerosol filtration efficiency of a new N95 respiratory face mask.
Methods: The test mask was challenged, using standardized methods, with influenza A and rhinovirus type 
14, bacteriophage ΦΧ174, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and model pollutants. The statistical significance 
of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with 
operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. 
Results: The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion 
of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium 
chloride (surrogates for PM2.5). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask 
configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus 
and bacteriophage ΦΧ174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly 
different. 
Conclusions: The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection 
against both small- and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for 
filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM2.5) present 
in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders this 
individual-use N95 respiratory mask an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a 
variety of environmental contaminants including PM2.5 and pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.

Zhou et al. Filtration efficiency of a N95 respiratory mask
Introduction
Concern over personal health in the face of airborne assaults 
in the form of aerosolized pathogens (viruses, bacteria, 
mycobacteria, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, etc.) and 
environmental pollutants (allergens and particulates) is high 
in geographical areas with high morbidity and mortality 
associated with these pollutants (1-10). Of particular 
concern is fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic 
diameter <2.5 μm (referred to as PM2.5) that originates 
from fossil fuel combustion associated with, for instance, 
 
coal-fired power plants and traffic. 
The potential for infection with airborne pathogens and 
for exposure to such airborne particulates poses a threat 
to global public health (9) which can be mitigated through 
the personal use of disposable face masks. The effectiveness 
of such masks for excluding pathogens and pollutants is a 
function both of wearer compliance and comfort (11) and 
the intrinsic ability of the masks to resist penetration by 
airborne particulates (such as PM2.5) and infectious agents. 
For instance, the use of protective face masks negatively 
impacts respiratory and dermal mechanisms of human 
thermoregulation through impairment of convection, 
evaporation, and radiation processes (11). 
Wearer comfort can be enhanced by a variety of 
modifications to the masks, including (among others) the 
addition to the face mask of features such as the Micro 
Ventilator (comprising a Smart Valve and ventilation fan) 
 
(Figure 1). The Micro Ventilator improves the flow of 
exhaled gas out of the mask (11). The purpose of the 
 
one-way Smart Valve is to limit the air flow into the mask 
through the valve such that all of the air must pass through 
the filter material. On the other hand, exhaled air may pass 
out of the mask through the valve. The purpose of the fan 
is to aid in the removal of exhaled air from the interior of 
the mask. The Dettol PROTECT
+ Smart Mask Large size 
(hereafter called the “test mask”) (Figure 1) incorporates 
these features that are designed for the purpose of 
enhancing wearer comfort (11).
It is important that effectiveness of personal protective 
devices such as face masks be measured against a variety 
of relevant pathogens and pollutants, and that this 
effectiveness be established both while using and rendering 
inoperable any incorporated comfort-enhancing features. 
The present studies were designed to assess the ability of 
different configurations of the test mask (the mask with 
operating Micro Ventilator, the mask with operating Smart 
Valve but without Micro Ventilator, and the mask with the 
Smart Valve covered/sealed) to exclude the penetration of 
experimentally aerosolized influenza A virus and rhinovirus 
type 14, phage ΦΧ174, and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 
surrogate air pollutants (paraffin oil and sodium chloride) 
using methods specified in the appropriate Standards 
[ASTM F2101 (12,13), EN 14683:2014 (14), and EN 
149:2001 + A1:2009 (15)]. 
Methods
Viruses and cell lines
Influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain A/PR/8/34 was obtained 
from Charles River Laboratories (Horsham, USA). 
Rhinovirus type 14, strain 1059 (ATCC VR-284) was 
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(Manassas, USA). The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell 
line (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34) and the H1-HeLa cell line 
(ATCC CRL-1658) were also obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection.
Test mask 
The test mask is an N95-rated (16) respiratory face mask 
comprised of the following layers, from outer to inner 
(Figure 2): an outer layer constructed of hydrophobic 
 
non-woven polypropylene that prevents external moisture 
from entering the mask material, followed by two layers 
of melt-blown non-woven polypropylene that capture oil 
and non-oil based particles through four key mechanisms. 
These include: (I) inertial impaction; (II) interception; 
(III) diffusion; and (IV) electrostatic attraction (16). The 
next layer is a modacrylic support layer that provides rigidity 
and adds thickness to the mask, giving it more structure and 
adding to the feel of comfort. The innermost layer is another 
hydrophobic non-woven polypropylene layer which minimizes 
moisture within the mask from entering the mask material and 
adversely impacting filtration efficiency. The mask samples 
were supplied to INSPEC Certification Services (Greater 
Manchester, UK), and Nelson Laboratories (Salt Lake City, 
USA) by Innosparks Pte Ltd. (Singapore) for a portion of the 
testing, while RB (China) provided mask samples to Microbac 
Laboratories (Sterling, USA) for additional testing. 
Assessment of influenza A virus and rhinovirus type 14 
penetration
An aerosol filtration test apparatus (Figure 3) assembled at 
Microbac per modified ASTM F2101-14 (12) was used for

Zhou et al. Filtration efficiency of a N95 respiratory mask
(the mask with operating Micro Ventilator, the mask with 
operating Smart Valve but without Micro Ventilator, or 
the mask with the Smart Valve covered/sealed) were placed 
between upstream and downstream chambers. The virus 
filtration efficiency test was performed in triplicate (N=3). 
For each run, a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Mesa Labs, 
Butler, USA) was filled with a measured amount of virus 
suspended in 0.1× Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) and 
the virus was aerosolized and delivered into the upstream 
chamber using high-pressure air. A downstream vacuum 
was turned on to create an air flow (28.3 L/min) through 
the mask that was intended to mimic human breathing (17). 
 
After the delivery of the aerosol, the upstream air 
pressure was turned off and the downstream vacuum 
pump was left on for another minute to pull residual 
aerosol from the chambers into the one-stage Andersen 
sampler. Virus aerosol that passed through the mask was 
captured on a Petri dish containing semi-solid medium 
 
(5% gelatin/minimal essential medium). The collected 
sample was liquefied at 36±2 ℃ for approximately 10 min. 
The resulting samples were divided into separate portions for 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction and for infectivity assays (18). 
Viral infectivity was measured on the basis of cytopathic 
effect (CPE) generated in MDCK cells (for influenza virus) 
and H1-HeLa cells (for rhinovirus). For the infectivity 
assay, a ten-fold dilution series of the samples collected as 
described above was prepared in a dilution medium. The 
sample dilutions were then inoculated onto the host cells. 
After 4–9 days of incubation, the CPE was scored under a 
phase-contrast light microscope. Viral titers were calculated 
in units of log10 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) 
per mL according to Spearman-Kärber (19).
For the qRT-PCR assay, RNA was extracted using 
a Qiagen QIAamp
® Viral RNA Mini kit following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was analyzed using 
primers and probes specific to each virus. For influenza 
H1N1 virus, the forward primer was 5’-GAC CRA TCC 
TGT CAC CTC TGA C, the reverse primer was 5’-AGG 
GCA TTY TGG ACA AAC GTC TAA, and the probe was 
5’-(FAM) TGC AGT CCT CGC TCA CTG GGC ACG 
(BHQ). For rhinovirus 14, the forward primer was 5’-GAG 
GTG TGC TGT GTG CTA CT and the reverse primer 
was 5’-GAC TTG GTT GGC GTG TTG AC. 
Assessment of S. aureus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174 
penetration
Bacterial and phage filtration efficiencies for the masks without 
Micro Ventilator were determined at Nelson Laboratories per 
EN 14683:2014 (14) and ASTM F2101-07 (13), respectively. 
The purpose of this testing was to assess the filtration 
efficiency of the filter material used in the test mask (Figure 2).
The bacterial filtration efficiency test compared the 
upstream bacterial control counts to downstream counts 
(i.e., counts attributed to passage of bacteria through the 
face mask). A suspension of S. aureus was aerosolized using 
a six-jet Collison nebulizer and delivered to the face mask 
(N=5 replicate measurements) at a constant flow rate 
 
(28.3 L/min) and challenge delivery [1.7–2.7×10
3 colony 
forming units (CFU)] with a mean particle size (MPS) of 
3.0±0.3 μm. The aerosolized droplets were drawn through a 
six-stage Andersen sampler for collection. 
The viral filtration efficiency test compared the upstream 
bacteriophage control counts to downstream counts (i.e., 
counts attributed to passage of bacteriophage through the 
face mask). A suspension of bacteriophage ΦΧ174 was 
aerosolized using a six-jet Collison nebulizer and delivered 
to the face mask (N=5 replicate measurements) at a constant 
flow rate (28.3 L/min) and challenge delivery [1.1–3.3×10
3 
plaque forming units (PFU)] with a MPS of 3.0±0.3 μm. 
The aerosolized droplets were drawn through a six-stage 
Andersen sampler for collection. 
Assessment of paraffin oil and sodium chloride penetration
Filter penetration by the paraffin oil method for the test masks 
with operating Micro Ventilator was evaluated at INSPEC 
Certification Services per EN 149:2001 + A1:2009 (15) using a 
modified Phoenix SG-20 aerosol generator with detection using 
a photometer. The purpose of this evaluation was to provide 
evidence that the test mask configured with each of the features 
designed to enhance comfort would satisfy the requirements 
of this Standard. Per the Standard, the median diameter of the 
generated particles must be 0.6 μm (15). Three replicates of the 
mask were evaluated under “as received”, “simulated wearing”, 
and “mechanical strength and temperature conditioning” 
conditions per the Standard (15). The methodology is equivalent 
to that specified by the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH) for rating masks. For instance, 
an N95-rated mask removes 95% of a 0.3-μm (mass median 
aerodynamic diameter) particle sodium chloride aerosol and is 
not resistant to oils (16).

determine the statistical significance of differences in the 
mean filtration efficiency values obtained for different test 
microorganisms, or in particulates testing, the differences 
between “as received” and other conditions (see above). A 
P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 
The significance of differences among mean values for 
different test mask configurations for a given virus was 
evaluated using a two-tailed t-test.
Results
The efficiencies of various configurations of the test mask 
(masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans or 
masks with sealed Smart Valves) for filtration of pathogens and 
surrogate air pollutants, including respiratory viruses, bacteria, 
bacteriophage, and particulates, were determined empirically 
per the requirements of the relevant Standards (12-15).
Assessment of influenza A virus and rhinovirus 
penetration
The ability of the test mask to provide user protection against 
airborne pathogenic viruses was assessed using the human 
respiratory viruses, influenza A (H1N1) virus and rhinovirus 
14 per ASTM F2101-14 (12). The viruses evaluated differ 
with respect to size and envelope status. Influenza virus is 
a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family and is a relatively 
large (80–120 nm) enveloped virus, while the rhinovirus is a 
member of the Picornaviridae family and is a small (27–30 nm) 
non-enveloped virus (20). It might be expected, based purely 
on particle size, that the rhinovirus would represent a greater 
challenge for a filter mask than the influenza virus, but other

Zhou et al. Filtration efficiency of a N95 respiratory mask
considerations apply, as discussed below.
The results of the virus filtration efficiency study (Table 1) 
 
indicate that regardless of configuration or surrogate 
virus evaluated, ≥99.6% (range, 99.6–99.9%) of infectious 
virus was excluded by the test mask. Filtration efficiency 
determined by RT-PCR (which determines presence of 
both infectious and non-infectious virus) was found to range 
from 98.9% to 100%. In most cases, greater variability was 
observed in these replicate filtration efficiency measurements 
based on RT-PCR, compared with the infectivity endpoint 
(T
able 1). No statistically significant differences were observed 
when these data were analyzed by either influenza virus 
or rhinovirus for a given mask configuration, or by mask 
configuration for either one of the viruses.
Assessment of S. aureus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174 
penetration
Additional characterization of the ability of the test mask 
without Micro Ventilator to provide user protection 
against airborne pathogens was afforded by examination 
of the filtration efficiency for Staphylococcus aureus and 
the bacteriophage ΦΧ174 per ASTM F2101-7 (13). 
These bacterial and viral surrogates differ greatly in 
size (~2,000×500 nm for S. aureus vs. ~34 nm for the 
bacteriophage). Due to their differing sizes, it might be 
expected that the bacteriophage would represent a greater 
challenge for a filter mask than the bacterium, although 
other considerations apply, as discussed below.
The result of the virus filtration efficiency and 
bacteria filtration efficiency studies (Table 2) indicate that 
regardless of the surrogate pathogen evaluated, ≥99.5% 
 
(range, 99.5–99.9%) of microbial agents was excluded by the 
mask. No statistically significant differences were observed 
when these data were analyzed by surrogate pathogen for 
the test mask configuration evaluated.

A1:2009 (15) using paraffin oil to model liquid particulates 
and sodium chloride to model solid particulates. The results 
for various conditioning categories required by the Standard 
are displayed in Table 3. The efficiency for exclusion of 
sodium chloride was 99.9%, regardless of the conditioning 
(“as received”, “simulated wearing”, or “mechanical strength 
and temperature conditioning”). The efficiency for paraffin 
oil ranged from 99.3% to 99.7%. Although a statistically 
significant difference between “as received” and “simulated 
wearing” testing was identified for both sodium chloride 
and paraffin oil (P<0.05), the requirements for the Standard 
were met, including penetration limits as well as breathing 
resistance (a measure of comfort; data not shown).
Discussion
Protection of individuals from environmental pollutants, 
including pathogens, allergens, and fine particulates (PM2.5), 
can be achieved, in part, through use of personal protective 
devices such as respiratory face masks. The use of face masks 
for this purpose is more common in certain geographical 
regions, such as China and India, where population densities 
are higher, and the residents are more likely to be chronically 
exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding annual World Health 
Organization Air Quality Guidelines (<10 μg/m
3) (9). 
The compliance of use of respiratory face masks should 
be facilitated by features such as the Smart Valve and 
operational Micro Ventilator (Figure 1), which are designed 
to aid in the evacuation of exhaled gases from the interior 
of the mask (11). The enhancement of user comfort may 
be measured quantitatively through assessment of gas 
content in the dead space of the mask and systemic and 
facial thermoregulation (11). Goh et al. [Goh YTD, Mun 
MW, Lee WLJ, et al. A randomised clinical trial to evaluate 
the safety, fit, comfort of a novel N95 mask in children. 
(submitted for publication)] found, in a clinical study 
in children aged 7–14 years, that wearing this test mask 
without Micro Ventilator increased the end-tidal CO2 
(ETCO2) and fractional concentration of inspired CO2 
(FICO2), compared to children without masks at rest and 
during brisk walking. In contrast, wearing the mask with 
operational Micro Ventilator brought FICO2 levels for 
both activities closer to baseline levels obtained in children 
not wearing the mask. Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) simulation experiments conducted in adult subjects 
have demonstrated that the introduction of a ventilation 
fan to the N95 mask is a feasible option for reducing CO2 
accumulation in the dead space of the mask and also for 
controlling the temperature of the air within the dead 
 
space (21,22). The clinical study [Goh YTD, Mun MW, 
Lee WLJ, et al. A randomised clinical trial to evaluate 
the safety, fit, comfort of a novel N95 mask in children. 
(submitted for publication)] confirmed the earlier CFD 
studies indicating reduction of CO2 in the dead space of the 
mask with operational ventilator fan. Furthermore, CFD 
studies performed in adult subjects have demonstrated 
reduction in heat, CO2, and moisture build-up within N95 
masks configured with operational ventilator fans (21,22). 
Moisture build-up in N95 masks used in high humidity 
atmospheres has been shown to reduce filtration efficiency 
of the masks for Ebola-Makona virus (23). 
Mask inhalation and exhalation breathing resistance 
requirements are addressed in the European Respiratory 
Protection certification EN149:20001 + A1:2009 (15). 
These requirements were met by the test mask with 
operational Smart Valve and Micro Ventilator fan. Additional 
evidence that the Smart Valve and Micro Ventilator 
fan results in a mask that provides acceptable breathing 
resistance characteristics (inhalation and exhalation) is 
the fact that the test mask was awarded an N95 rating by

Zhou et al. Filtration efficiency of a N95 respiratory mask
NIOSH. Testing for satisfaction of this rating includes 
evaluation of inhalation and exhalation resistance (16). 
 
The use of respiratory face masks with operational ventilation 
fans is therefore useful both from a comfort-enhancement 
perspective as well as for providing optimal filtration efficiency. 
Ideally, any features added to a respiratory protective 
device solely for the purpose of enhancing wearer comfort 
should not adversely impact the primary function of 
the device, which is to filter airborne particulates and 
infectious agents from the contaminated air. In the present 
study, we have assessed the efficiency of the test mask for 
filtration of surrogate pathogens (bacteria and respiratory 
viruses) and pollutants. Various configurations of the mask 
 
(Table 1) were challenged, including the mask with 
operating Micro Ventilator, the mask with operating Smart 
Valve but without Micro Ventilator, and the mask with the 
Smart Valve covered/sealed. The latter configuration would 
be considered “best case” for excluding experimentally 
aerosolized contaminants [surrogate pathogens/particulates 
such as PM2.5 (16,24)], while the fully operational Micro 
Ventilator would be considered “worst case” for this 
purpose. For instance, a poorly functioning Smart Valve 
may allow environmental contaminants into the interior 
of the mask, defeating the purpose of the mask as a 
 
filtration device.
A filtration efficiency value for pathogens (influenza 
A, rhinovirus 14, bacteriophage ΦΧ174, and S. aureus) 
of >99.6% was achieved by the test mask, regardless of 
configuration tested. This value reflected the ability of the 
mask to exclude infectious agents, including respiratory 
viruses. Similar, albeit more variable, results were obtained 
when genomic copies of influenza A virus and rhinovirus 
were monitored rather than infectious virus. The filtration 
efficiency of the test mask for surrogate pathogens was 
similar, regardless of the challenge microbial agents’ size 
(ranging from 27–30 nm for bacteriophage and rhinoviruses 
to 2,000 nm for S. aureus). 
This similarity in filtration efficiency for different size 
microbes may reflect, in large part, the fact that the challenge 
was in the form of aerosol particles with MPS of ~3.0 μm. 
The particle size used was that stipulated in the relevant 
Standard (ASTM F2101) (12,13) and reflects the concern 
over transmission of infectious agents through fine aerosols, 
as has been demonstrated for influenza virus (25-27) and 
smallpox (variola) virus (28). The potential role of fine 
aerosols in transmission of a variety of viruses, such as 
measles, influenza, rhinoviruses, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), hantavirus 
 
(Sin Nombre virus), rabies, pox and Ebola viruses has been 
reviewed (7,8). For example, Lindsley et al. (27) measured 
the content of influenza virus in aerosol particles from 
human coughs, reporting that 35% of the influenza RNA 
detected was contained in particles >4 μm in aerodynamic 
diameter, whereas 23% were contained in particles of 
 
1–4 μm diameter and 42% were in particles <1 μm in 
diameter, indicating that the majority of the viral RNA 
from human coughs was within the respirable size range. 
Also, aerosols generated by coughing patients infected 
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis were between the range of 
 
0.65–4.7 μm in diameter (29).
The reduction of viable H1N1 influenza conferred by five 
brands of N95 face mask was found to range from 96.3% 
to 99.995% by Harnish et al. (30). The nearly three log10 
reduction in penetration of viruses observed in the current 
study and in other studies using N95 face masks represents 
an improvement over the 2.8-fold reduction in penetration 
of genomic copies for influenza virus challenged via a fine 
(<5 μm) aerosol obtained during testing of a surgical mask 
(25). The latter results confirm previous observations of 
the limited value of surgical masks for filtering fine aerosols 
containing infectious agents and particulates (31). 
The filtration efficiency studies performed on the test 
mask were based on methodologies described in the various 
international Standards followed (i.e., ASTM F2101 and 
EN149:20001 + A1:2009). The methods described within 
these Standards are based on the following assumptions: 
(I) that infections that are typically transmitted through 
the respiratory route are in the form of virus-containing 
aerosols originating from the source (e.g., infected patient’s 
respiratory secretions) and not individual monodispersed 
viral particles. For instance, influenza virus, particles of 
which are only about 100 nm in diameter, has been found in 
healthcare centers predominantly in aerosolized respiratory 
fluid droplets having aerodynamic diameters of 4 μm or 
larger (32); further assumptions are: (II) that the testing of 
penetration of model pathogens and particulates through 
a mask can be used to determine acceptable performance 
against a variety of pathogens/particulate types; and (III) 
the ASTM F2101 Standard does not require pre-stressing 
or conditioning of the mask, and it must be acknowledged 
that degradation of the mask material by physical, chemical, 
or thermal stresses could negatively impact the filtration 
efficiency of the mask (12). The ASTM Standard also 
does not address breathability characteristics of the mask, 
although this is addressed by the EN149:20001 + A1:2009

Standard and the N95 testing performed by NIOSH as part 
of their rating process.
Masks are often used in healthcare settings, where they may 
be employed to limit the spread of respiratory infections from 
infected patients to healthcare workers (33). In these cases, the 
masks are worn as personal protective equipment by healthcare 
workers. Results of the increased efficiency of N95-rated 
masks such as that tested in our study suggest that such masks 
should be used, rather than surgical masks, for this purpose. 
The relatively greater filtration efficiency of N95-rated face 
masks relative to surgical masks demonstrated in laboratory 
studies has not, however, translated into significant differences 
in protection of healthcare workers in controlled studies (34-36) 
which could be due to lack of fitting information provided in 
 
these studies.
Given the cultural acceptability of wearing masks in 
public in countries such as China, consumers use masks 
for prevention of exposure to infectious agents (during 
influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV outbreaks). Will 
such face masks protect family members, healthcare workers 
and other patients by having the source (infected) patient 
wear the mask? On theoretical grounds, a face mask with 
a Smart Valve should allow unfiltered exhaled air to exit 
the mask. If this occurs, having an infected patient wear 
such a mask may not protect other patients and healthcare 
workers. As a next step it would be prudent, using methods 
such as those used by Milton et al. (25), to assess the passage 
of virus in the reverse direction (i.e., from the interior of 
the mask to the exterior through the Smart Valve) in order 
to provide assurance to both healthcare professionals and 
public at large. The development of a Micro Ventilator 
containing a suitable filter as part of the Smart Valve 
might confer the necessary filtration capabilities to a mask 
intended for such purposes.
Filtration of fine non-infectious particulates is also an 
important aspect of face masks such as the test mask. The 
anticipated health benefits associated with this function 
include reduction in the inhaled burden of allergens and 
toxic pollutants (e.g., PM2.5). The wearing of face masks 
has been demonstrated to provide cardiopulmonary health 
benefits in studies involving both healthy and comorbid 
clinical subjects in Beijing (37,38). Currently, a study 
is underway which is investigating the interventional 
role of the test mask in cardiovascular events emerging 
 
post-exposure to fine particulates (PM2.5) in healthy 
American subjects (39). The filtration efficiency of the test 
mask in the present study was >99.9% for sodium chloride 
and >99.3% for paraffin oil. The latter result indicates 
that the filter material used in the test mask displays oil 
resistance. As such, the test mask would be expected to 
provide filtration efficiency for combustion products (40) 
in addition to the efficiency demonstrated for sodium 
chloride (a surrogate for allergens and pollutants such 
as PM2.5). As discussed above for filtration of infectious 
agents, comparative testing of N95 facepiece respirators 
and surgical masks has shown that surgical masks are less 
effective for filtration of sodium chloride aerosols (41).
Any increased benefits of N95 facepiece respirators such 
as the test mask over surgical masks are likely dependent 
upon the ergonomic fit of the mask to the wearer’s face. 
This is because in the absence of a tight fit, inward leakage 
would be expected to dominate over filter penetration as 
the predominant mode of entry of particulates/aerosols 
containing infectious agents into the mask, regardless 
of the type of mask (30-32,41). A controlled clinical 
study failed, however, to reveal a significant difference in 
protection of healthcare workers using fit-tested vs. non-
fit-tested N95 masks (42). As with other clinical trials of 
this type mentioned above, the study may not have been 
powered sufficiently to detect any differences. In addition, 
compliance was not complete in the study (masks were 
worn 68–79% of the time) and the degree of leakage in the 
not-fit-test arm was not assessed. Judging from the low rate 
of fit-test failures observed in the fit-test arm (1.1%), the 
actual amount of leakage that occurred in the non-fit-tested 
arm may have been very low (i.e., the lack of fit testing 
likely did not correspond to leaky masks in that treatment 
arm) (42). Therefore, the test mask used in this study is 
targeted for improving comfort, and therefore compliance, 
and may potentially deliver positive health benefits both in 
healthy and comorbid populations.
Conclusions
The results generated by three independent testing 
laboratories demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of the test mask 
for the protection of users from influenza A virus, rhinovirus 
14, and S. aureus, and >99.3% effective for surrogate 
particulates such as paraffin oil and sodium chloride. The 
mask provides protection against both small- and large-size 
pathogens and the surrogate particulate results suggest that 
the mask should also be effective at excluding pollutants 
such as PM2.5 and allergens. Importantly, the mask appears 
to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens including 
influenza and rhinoviruses and fine particulates present 
in aerosols which represent a greater challenge for many
