A sensational newspaper article concerning a possible adverse reaction to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was published in
March 2013 in Japan. In June 2013, the Japanese government suspended their proactive recommendation for vaccination, despite the
lack of proof for a causal relationship. We searched Nikkei Telecom 21, the largest newspaper database in Japan, for articles published
from January 2011 to December 2015 to evaluate the characteristics of newspaper publications about human papillomavirus vacci-
nation. We identified 1138 HPV vaccine–related articles. Compared with those published before March 2013, articles concerning
human papillomavirus vaccination after March 2013 were more likely to include adverse reaction-related and authority-related key-
words; articles that included efficacy-related keywords decreased significantly. Negative-negative and negative-neutral articles be-
came more frequent, and positive-positive and positive-neutral articles were less frequent. A sensational case report shaped the
tone of negative media coverage as a catalyst, regardless of scientific statements from health authorities.
Keywords.
human papillomavirus; vaccination; media.
In Japan, 2 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix
and Gardasil, were approved in 2009 and in 2011, respectively.
These vaccines were included in the recommended routine
vaccination program for adolescent girls starting in April
2013. However, in March 2013, the Asahi Shimbun, one of
the most authoritative and influential newspapers in Japan,
publicized the case of a junior high school student who suf-
fered from difficulties in walking and mathematical calcula-
tion after HPV vaccination. Similar cases were increasingly
reported as the adverse events gained media attention, al-
though the time intervals between the receipt of the vaccine
and the onset were inconsistent in reported cases. The Japa-
nese government suspended their proactive recommendation
for vaccination starting in June 2013, and the safety of HPV
vaccination became a significant public concern, despite the
lack of proof for a causal relationship between the vaccination
and reported adverse events. Newspapers are one of the most
popular primary sources of information about health prob-
lems and vaccines among the general public and may influ-
ence the government’s health policy decisions [1]. To
elucidate the characteristics of newspaper articles about
HPV vaccination, we conducted a literature search of articles
in the 5 largest newspapers in Japan (Asahi, Mainichi,
Yomiuri, Sankei, and Nihon Keizai), which have 27 million
subscribers in total.
METHODS
We collected articles published from January 2011 to December
2015 concerning HPV vaccines using the largest newspaper da-
tabase in Japan, Nikkei Telecom, with “human papillomavirus
vaccine” or “cervical cancer vaccine” in Japanese as keywords.
We counted the number of articles that included keywords. Ef-
ficacy-related keywords were “efficacy,” “effectiveness,” “bene-
fit,” and “prophylaxis.” Adverse reaction–related keywords
were “adverse reaction,” “risk,” “side effect,” “convulsion,”
“movement disorder,” “consciousness disorder,” “pain,” “paral-
ysis,” “fatigue,” “fibromyalgia,” “Guillain-Barre syndrome,”
“human papillomavirus vaccination associated with neuropath-
ic syndrome,” and “complex regional pain syndrome.” Author-
ity-related keywords were “World Health Organization,”
“Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety,” “European
Medicines agency,” “Centers for Disease Control,” “Japan Soci-
ety of Obstetrics and Gynecology,” and “Japan Pediatric
Society.”
The tone of articles was independently classified by 2 review-
ers, who were both physicians and blinded to the other’s ratings,
as positive, neutral, or negative; positive if they focused on ben-
efits, such as prevention of cervical cancer, neutral if they in-
cluded both benefits and risks, and negative if they focused
on risks, such as adverse events and discouragement of the
vaccination. We then classified the articles into 6 categories,
that is, identical classifications between reviewers (positive-
positive, neutral-neutral, and negative-negative) and discrepant

 classifications (positive-neutral, negative-neutral, and positive-
negative).
Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.1.2 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The
kappa statistic was used to measure interreviewer agreement.
To examine associations, we used relative risk (RR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) and Fisher exact tests. In all analyses,
P < .05 indicated statistical significance.
RESULTS
We identified 1138 articles concerning the HPV vaccine, which
comprised 0.02% of all articles published during the study pe-
riod. Twelve articles were excluded from the tone analysis be-
cause the full text was unavailable. Among the 1126 articles
included, the squared weighted kappa coefficient of 0.636 indi-
cated substantial interreviewer agreement.
Compared with the period before March 2013, the month in
which the sensational newspaper article on a possible HPV vac-
cine-related adverse reaction was reported, articles concerning
HPV vaccination after March 2013 were more likely to appear
on the front page (RR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.01–6.16; P = .045) and
include adverse reaction–related (RR, 5.49; 95% CI, 4.46–6.75;
P < .001) and authority-related keywords (RR, 3.37; 95% CI,
1.71–6.61; P < .001). Articles that included efficacy-related key-
words decreased significantly (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, .61–.72;
P < .001; Table 1). Negative-negative (RR, 21.1; 95% CI, 10.0–
44.5; P < .001) and negative-neutral articles were more frequent
(RR, 12.4; 95% CI, 6.39–24.1; P < .001), whereas positive-posi-
tive (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, .14–.33; P < .001) and positive-neutral
articles were less frequent (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, .07–.15;
P < .001). Neutral-neutral and positive-negative articles did
not show significant trends.
Figure 1 (upper panel) shows chronological trends of the
number of articles that included keywords on efficacy, adverse
reaction, and health authority. Before March 2013, 78.9% of the
articles mentioned efficacy-related keywords (red) and 15.8%
mentioned adverse reaction–related keywords (blue). There
were consistently more articles that included efficacy-related
keywords than those that included adverse reaction–related key-
words up until March 2013. However, this trend was reversed
(Figure 1, lower panel), with 52.2% of the articles including ef-
ficacy-related keywords and as many as 86.8% mentioning ad-
verse reaction–related keywords after this time point. Articles
that included authority-related keywords were rare throughout
the entire study period; they comprised 2.1% before March 2013
and 6.9% after March 2013.
Figure 2 shows chronological trends of the number and tone
of articles per month. Before March 2013, the rate of negative-
negative (blue) and negative-neutral (light blue) articles com-
prised only 3.3%, whereas that of positive-positive (dark red)
and positive-neutral (pink) articles was 59.5%. After March
2013, the proportion of negative-negative and negative-neutral
articles increased to 53.6% in total. The proportion of positive-
positive and neutral-positive articles plummeted to 8.1%.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that a sensational report on a possible HPV
vaccine–related adverse reaction in March 2013 abruptly led to
negative changes in the portrayal of HPV vaccination in influ-
ential Japanese newspapers, with continued reports of adverse
events for approximately 3 years following the initial article. Al-
though most experts have concluded that there is no definite
proof of a causal tie between these adverse events and the
HPV vaccines, some doctors, scientists, and groups represent-
ing families with children have denounced the vaccine as the
cause, and many parents fanatically believe there is a connec-
tion, as in the case of autism and mumps-measles-rubella
(MMR) vaccine [2].
Concerning adverse events from the standpoint of criticizing
specialists, a research team of the Japanese Medical Research
Foundation reported in September 2014 that the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) underestimated the

 number of people reportedly suffering from effects of HPV vac-
cination [3]. At a March 2016 government conference, a re-
search team supported by the MHLW publicized immature
results of basic research using mice and small-scale clinical
data that indicated a causal relationship between brain injury
after vaccination and the human leukocyte antigen [4]. The
mass media publicized the report extensively despite the fact
that it had not undergone an adequate peer-review process.
This type of negative media coverage is likely to have influenced
public opinion, lessened confidence in vaccination, and led to
hesitancy among Japanese citizens. Moreover, this coverage
may have contributed to the Japanese government’s reluctance
to re-introduce HPV vaccination as an active recommendation.
Media reports do not necessarily provide balanced informa-
tion about vaccine risks [5, 6] and can affect vaccination rates
among the public [7, 8]. In the 1970s and 1980s, antivaccine

 movements captured in mass media led to a sharp reduction in
coverage of whole-cell pertussis vaccination in Sweden, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation [9]. The
1998 Lancet article by Wakefield, which falsely linked MMR
vaccination, bowel disease, and autism, is famous for invoking
a cascade of vaccine fear mediated, in part, by media coverage,
leading to drops in vaccination uptake rates in the United King-
dom [10]. One example of an association found specifically be-
tween newspaper coverage and vaccination uptake comes from
the case of the South Wales Evening Post, which ran a campaign
against the MMR vaccine in 1997 [8, 11].It was found that 1998
MMR vaccination uptake rates dropped in areas covered by the
South Wales Evening Post, even more so than other areas in
Wales, suggesting the influence of 1 newspaper campaign [8].
In Japan, continued negative media coverage nationally is likely
to have contributed to dramatic changes in vaccine uptake. In-
deed, HPV immunization rates in Sapporo, Japan, plummeted
from 70% in the 1994–1998 birth cohorts to 0.6% in the 2000
birth cohort [12].
Health authorities all over the world have repeatedly stated
the safety and clinical benefits of HPV vaccination [13–15]
but have had limited influence on the tone of newspaper articles
and governmental recommendations. In September 2013, the
Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Japan Association
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Japan Society of Gyne-
cologic Oncology issued a statement calling for resumption of
the active recommendation of vaccination as soon as possible.
Since then, the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology
has repeatedly issued safety statements, and the Japan Pediatric
Society also issued a new statement in October 2014. Moreover,
in April 2016, 15 academic organizations jointly called for an
early restart of an active vaccine recommendation. However,
such movements did not gain as much media attention com-
pared with reported adverse events, as we have shown in the
current study.
We suspect 3 underlying reasons for this. First, the Japanese
government has avoided releasing explicit statements of safety,
most likely in order to mitigate the risk of national lawsuits.
This background of inaction may be related to Japan’s history
of bitter experiences with repeated national lawsuits for report-
ed adverse events associated with drugs, including vaccines.
For example, a series of adverse events following MMR vacci-
nation, which was included in the routine vaccination program
in Japan in 1989, resulted in class-action lawsuits against the
government, leading to the abandonment of the vaccine
[16]. Affected by such negative events concerning the contro-
versy related to HPV vaccines, the MHLW has relinquished
their leadership in risk communication and not yet resumed
proactive recommendation for more than three years. The
lack of clear initiative by the MHLW is one factor that could
have contributed to the continuation of negative media
reporting.
Second, there has been increasing mistrust in scientific soci-
eties in Japan, after repeated reports of corruption in clinical re-
search and inappropriate financial relationships between
doctors and pharmaceutical companies since 2012 [16, 17]. In
this regard, patient advocacy groups have severely criticized the
conflict of interest among some doctors who promote HPV vac-
cination in Japan.
Third, women suffering from possible adverse events of HPV
vaccination had not been compensated promptly, which has
prolonged the problem. Therefore, we underscore the need
to implement a no-fault compensation scheme in Japan.
No-fault compensation schemes are increasingly regarded as
an important component of successful vaccination programs.
For example, in the United States, the National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program was established as the result of a similar
scare relating to diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus vaccination in
1986 [18, 19]. However, the current compensation scheme in
Japan requires confirmation of causality by the government
and may lead claimants to seek further compensation through
private litigation [18]. On 30 March 2016, 12 women claiming
aftereffects of HPV vaccination held a press conference to bring
legal action against the government and pharmaceutical compa-
nies in Japan, claiming their responsibility and the need for
compensation [20]. While claims of nonsensical adverse events
would not be compensated, even under the no-fault compensa-
tion program, others who are suffering from unavoidable
adverse events could be compensated promptly [2, 19]. As a
result, it is possible that implementation of this system could
attenuate vaccine-related conflict in Japanese society and reduce
the risk of lawsuits against the government.
In current Japanese society, the HPV vaccine controversy has
fallen into a cycle of combative dualism between proponents
and those who believe they have suffered an adverse reaction,
making it implausible to persuade the opposite side to reach a
sensible consensus. Our study shows a limitation of existing
newspapers to create an environment where the balance of
risks and benefits can be discussed with composure scientifi-
cally. For this purpose, it is possible that grassroots risk commu-
nication, with an increasing number of participating individual
physicians, through social networking services and online
media, may provide an option for the public to access unbiased
information.
Our study has several limitations. We only examined newspa-
per articles and could not examine the content of other media,
such as television programs and Internet media, both of which
may be influential to public opinion. Furthermore, a key outcome
in this study, the tone of articles, may have been subject to bias.
However, it appears that the potential for bias was lessened
through substantial agreement between the blinded reviewers.
We should recognize that a sensational case report can shape
the tone of further media coverage as a catalyst and that scien-
tific statements from health authorities may not alter trends. To
