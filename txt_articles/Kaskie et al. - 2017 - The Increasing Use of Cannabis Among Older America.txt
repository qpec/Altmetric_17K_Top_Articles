Abstract
Cannabis use among older Americans is increasing. Although much of this growth has been attributed to the entry of a 
more tolerant baby boom cohort into older age, recent evidence suggests the pathways to cannabis are more complex. 
Some older persons have responded to changing social and legal environments and are increasingly likely to take cannabis 
recreationally. Other older persons are experiencing age-related health care needs, and some take cannabis for symptom 
management, as recommended by a medical doctor. Whether these pathways to recreational and medical cannabis are sepa-
rate or somewhat tangled remains largely unknown. There have been few studies examining cannabis use among the grow-
ing population of Americans aged 65 and older. In this essay, we illuminate what is known about the intersection between 
cannabis and the aging American population. We review trends concerning cannabis use and apply the age–period–cohort 
paradigm to explicate varied pathways and outcomes. Then, after considering the public health problems posed by those 
who misuse or abuse cannabis, we turn our attention to how cannabis may be a viable policy alternative in terms of sup-
porting the health and well-being of a substantial number of aging Americans. On the one hand, cannabis may be an 
effective substitute for prescription opioids and other misused medications; on the other hand, cannabis has emerged as an 
alternative for the undertreatment of pain at the end of life. As intriguing as these alternatives may be, policy makers must 
first address the need for empirically driven, representative research to advance the discourse.

Cannabis use among persons older than 50 years has 
increased significantly, exceeding projections and out-
pacing the recent growth observed across all other age 
groups (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2014). In 2000, past-year cannabis use 
among all persons older than 50 years was estimated as 
1.0%, with rates reaching 2.0% among those aged between 
50 and 59 years (i.e., the baby boomers). Projecting to the 
year 2020, use rates among those older than 50 years were 
expected to climb to 2.9%, largely as a function of the 
continued aging of a baby boom cohort with historically 
higher rates of lifetime use (Colliver, Compton, Gfroerer, 
& Condon, 2006). However, when analyzing the 2008 
National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 
DiNitto and Choi (2011) found past-year cannabis use for 
all persons older than 50 years already had reached 2.8%. 
When NSDUH data from 2008 through 2012 were pooled, 
Choi, DiNitto, Marti, and Choi (2015) found past-year 
cannabis use climbed to 3.9%.
Using another nationally representative survey, the 2014 
Summer Styles Consumer Panel Survey, Schauer, King, 
Bunnell, Promoff, and McAfee (2016) found that 5.1% of 
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article-abstract/57/6/1166/2884381 by guest on 02 June 2019
 persons older than 50 years reported taking cannabis in 
the past month, suggesting use rates might be higher than 
indicated by the NSDUH data. Schauer and colleagues 
(2016) also reported that among all current cannabis users 
(including those older than 50 years), 10.5% reported 
medicinal-only use, 53.4% reported recreational-only use, 
and 36.1% reported both. In comparison to the NSDUH, 
these estimates were generated from a small subpopulation 
of older adults who were not recruited from a population-
based probability sample. Schauer and colleagues also did 
not stratify reasons for use by age (Figure 1).
Although this prior work has been illuminating, policy 
makers have only been offered glimpses into this imminent 
public health challenge. Several substantive gaps exist in 
what is currently known about cannabis and older persons. 
What are the self-reported antecedents of taking cannabis? 
Does cannabis use lead to substance misuse or prescrip-
tion substitution? As the United States is about to enter a 
period when the older adult population is projected to dou-
ble (Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014) and the cannabis 
economy may grow fivefold (Caulkins, Kilmer, Reuter, & 
Midgette, 2015), such critical questions need to be asked. 
Yet, at this time, there have been few directions charted for 
conducting the kind of research that would be most useful 
in providing empirically based answers.
In this analytic essay, we apply the age–period–cohort par-
adigm to explore the intersection between cannabis and older 
persons. We consider how cannabis use among older adults 
is being shaped variably by social attitudes, state laws, and 
individual characteristics, such as health needs and prescrip-
tion drug use, and rely on previous data analyses as well as 
original data collected from eight state medical cannabis pro-
grams to chart the different paths older adults are taking. We 
consider undesirable outcomes such as the misuse and abuse 
of cannabis. We then direct our attention to two other promi-
nent public health issues, one concerning the increasing mis-
use of prescription medications (e.g., opioids) and the other 
focusing on the undertreatment of pain at the end of life, and 
consider how cannabis substitution may be a viable policy 
alternative to these more prominent public health problems.
Antecedents of Cannabis Use 
Among Persons 
Older Than 50 Y
ears
The majority of persons older than 50 years who currently 
take cannabis are healthy and white, though there are sev-
eral significant individual differences among the population 
of nearly 45 million older Americans (Choi et al., 2015; 
Colliver et al., 2006; DiNitto & Choi, 2011). The NSDUH 
data indicated that older persons who currently take can-
nabis were statistically more likely to have started taking 
cannabis before the age of 30 years, with many starting 
before the age of 18 years. These persons who initiated can-
nabis use before the age of 30 years make up half of all 
those older than 50 years who used it recently, and nearly a 
quarter of these consistent users took cannabis at least 3–4 
times per week in the past year. Past-year cannabis use also 
has been associated with gender (men are more likely to use 
than women), marital status (those who are not married are 
more likely to use), and race (non-whites are more likely 
to use than whites). Persons older than 50 years who take 
cannabis are more likely to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, 
and use cocaine and other illicit drugs including opioids.
The majority of all persons older than 50 years who 
took cannabis in the past year indicated they used less 
than once every 10 days, and 25% of all older persons 
used less than five times during the past year (Blazer & 
Wu, 2009). More than 9 out of 10 of all older persons 
who took cannabis in the past year reported having 
no emotional or functional problems, and the majority 
indicated they placed no self-limit on their use (Black & 
Joseph, 2014). Only 2.0% of persons older than 50 years 
indicated they have been diagnosed as having abused can-
nabis in their lifetime, and only 0.9% have ever received 
professional treatment for taking cannabis, though 20.7% 
individuals who used in the past year reported seeking 
treatment for alcohol or some other substance besides 
cannabis at some point in their life (Blazer & Wu, 2009; 
Wu & Blazer, 2011). Although there is reason to be con-
cerned that increasing cannabis use among older persons 
may contribute to increased rates of substance misuse or 
other undesirable outcomes such as overdoses and traffic 
accidents, the overwhelming majority of older adults do 
not experience negative outcomes. In fact, an increasing 
number of reports have highlighted the benefits that older 
persons derive when taking cannabis (Ahmed, van den 
Elsen, van der Marck, & Rikkert, 2015).
Charting the Pathways Between Cannabis 
and Older Persons
One way to illuminate the growing intersection between 
cannabis use and United States’ aging population is to 
deploy a paradigm in which individual outcomes (e.g., tak-
ing cannabis) are assumed to be shaped by cohort effects 
(e.g., more favorable attitudes held by one generation 
but not another) as well as period effects (e.g., historical 
events such as cannabis legalization) and age effects that

 occur over the life course (e.g., health problems). O’Malley, 
Bachman, and Johnston (1988) originally applied this per-
spective to examine the dynamic changes in cannabis use 
among nationally representative panels of high school sen-
iors who graduated between 1976 and 1986 (Figure 2).
In trying to understand why cannabis use increased 
and then decreased among succeeding graduating classes, 
they referred to a period effect. In particular, O’Malley 
and his colleagues attributed the decreasing cannabis use 
among seniors graduating after 1981 to national efforts 
to curtail illegal drug use initiated by the Reagan admin-
istration. O’Malley and his colleagues then linked the con-
sistent decreases in cannabis use after the age of 21 years 
to maturation (age effect) and argued that taking canna-
bis declines as individuals assume more professional and 
personal responsibilities. Other researchers (e.g., Miech & 
Koester, 2012) have since deployed the age–period–cohort 
paradigm to examine contemporary patterns of cannabis 
use among nationally representative panels, but little effort 
has been made to analyze the pathways associated with 
varied cannabis use among older persons.
Cohort Effects
According to social learning theory, individual attitudes are 
developed through social interactions and are maintained 
through conditioning, imitation, and reinforcement (Black & 
 
Joseph, 2014). Persons born between 1946 and 1964 have 
consistently held more favorable attitudes toward legalizing 
cannabis than persons born prior to 1945 (e.g., the silent 
generation born between 1925 and 1945). By the time these 
“baby boomers” graduated from high school, 43% held the 
opinion that marijuana should be legalized (Black & Joseph, 
2014). Although such favorable attitudes toward legaliza-
tion dropped to 17% in 1990 (reflecting the period effect 
associated with the Reagan administration, as identified by 
O’Malley et al.), the boomers’ positive attitudes toward can-
nabis have been increasing steadily ever since. By 2000, as the 
leading edge of the baby boom cohort reached and surpassed 
their 50th birthdays, 34% were in favor of legalizing canna-
bis (Black & Joseph, 2014). Other researchers have found 
that as general public opinion about cannabis has become 
less negative, older individuals have become more likely to 
adopt favorable attitudes (Schuermeyer et al., 2014).
Changing attitudes among older adults also have been 
tied to perceptions about the medical benefits of cannabis. 
Kalata (2004) reported that nearly 60% of persons over the 
age of 45 years believed cannabis provided a medical bene-
fit and 72% believed doctors should be allowed to recom-
mend medical cannabis. Although such attitudes were higher 
among those who previously had taken cannabis, nearly two 
out of every three who never took cannabis at any point dur-
ing their life also held such favorable attitudes about medical 
benefits. Wang and Chen (2006) suggested that such attitude 
changes can occur when a person assigns a higher degree of 
relevance to an issue. In this case, when facing a health crisis, 
an older adult may be more likely to engage in processing 
new information that ultimately may alter a long-standing 
attitude about how to treat the health problem. For example, 
suppose some older person who historically has held nega-
tive attitudes toward cannabis begins to suffer with intract-
able pain. As the pain progresses and remains inadequately 
treated, the older adult may receive information about the 
potential benefits of taking cannabis from a patient advo-
cacy organization such as the ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis) Foundation. The older patient may then inquire 
of his or her physician if cannabis may provide some sort of 
benefit. This sort of information processing reflects how a 
long-held attitude about cannabis can be altered.
In 2014, favorable attitudes among aging baby boomers 
reached 52%, and Black and Joseph linked these increas-
ingly more favorable views with increasing rates of past-
year use among those older than 50 years. In 2000, the 
percentage of older persons who had tried marijuana at 
least once in their lifetime reached 23% among 50–64 year 
olds and 3% among those aged 65 and older. By 2011, life-
time usage rates increased to 44% among those between 50 
and 64 years old and 17% for persons older than 65 years 
(Black & Joseph, 2014).
Period Effects
Another perspective suggests the decision to take canna-
bis is based on subjective calculations concerning reward 
and risk (Black & Joseph, 2014). Individuals living in states 
with medical marijuana laws (MMLs) may perceive less risk 
in taking cannabis and, thus, increase their use. Although 
most studies linking past-year use rates with states that have 
taken some step toward legalizing cannabis have focused 
on younger populations, we did find a few that offered 
some insight into whether the introduction of MMLs 
had an effect on older persons. Using data from the 2004 
National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related

 conditions as well as the 2004 NSDUH, Cerdá, Wall, Keyes, 
 
Galea, and Hasin (2012) identified significant statistical dif-
ferences in past-year use rates between those living in states 
with and without MMLs, and these persisted across all age 
groups. A more recent study by Wen, Hockenberry, and 
Cummings (2015) pooled NSDUH survey data from 2004 
through 2012 and contrasted past month cannabis use 
rates within those states that adopted MMLs during this 
period with those that did not. They found that, among all 
persons older than 21 years, the introduction of an MML 
corresponded with significant increases in past-month can-
nabis use. Given the lack of significant differences between 
younger and older adults, we surmised that persons older 
than 50 years living in MML states were just as likely as 
younger persons to have increased their past-year use.
Because the NSDUH survey only asks about the ille-
gal use of cannabis, we retrieved registry data from eight 
state programs to determine whether older adults were 
using legalized medical cannabis as well. In analyzing the 
multiyear population summary data presented by four of 
these states, we found the total number of older program 
participants has been increasing steadily in the last 5 years, 
and persons older than 60 years are representing a greater 
portion of the state program population. In Montana, 680 
persons older than 60 years registered for the state medi-
cal cannabis program in 2010, representing 7.9% of all 
program participants; by 2015, the number of older par-
ticipants grew to 2,037 and persons older than 60 years 
represented 19.3% of all program participants. In Arizona, 
the number of state program participants over the age of 
60 years totaled 7,191 in 2013 and represented 16.7% of 
the registry; by the end of 2015, the number reached 14,680 
and persons older than 60 years constituted 18.9% of reg-
istered participants. The Colorado registry data revealed 
that participants older than 60 years totaled 17,495 in 
2014 and increased to 17,877 in 2015. The other state 
program registries only recently began collecting patient 
data and the proportion of older users ranged from 9.9 
to 20.5% of all participants. States in which cannabis has 
been approved for recreational purposes do not compile 
such data (Figure 3).
We suspect the total number and proportion of older 
users might be even greater in those states in which efforts 
to implement medical cannabis programs are more exten-
sive. In particular, although the majority of states have 
moved to legalize cannabis in the past decade, the scope 
of these state laws and related implementation efforts vary 
considerably (Pacula, Hunt, & Boustead, 2014). Some 
states allow recreational use as well as medicinal use for a 
wide range of conditions, other state laws and dispensary 
operations are more restrictive. Pacula, Powell, Heaton, 
and Sevigny (2015) found that MMLs vary across no fewer 
than four substantive dimensions, and increased use of can-
nabis has been associated with factors such as whether the 
state allows for individual cultivation.
Age Effects
As persons become older, they may experience stressful 
events such as the loss of a spouse or a lack of sufficient 
retirement income, and these age-related events may lead 
them to take cannabis as a coping mechanism (Black & 
Joseph, 2014). As persons age, the chances of acquiring a 
disease or disability that are possibly amenable to medical 
cannabis also increase considerably. For example, glaucoma 
refers to a constellation of age-related ocular conditions 
that constitute the primary cause of blindness among per-
sons older than 65 years. Several researchers have reported 
that medical cannabis successfully reduces glaucoma-
related ocular pressure and can help prevent blindness, and 
the use of medical cannabis for glaucoma is supported by 
the American College of Physicians (2008). Another set 
of age-related conditions considered amenable to medical 
cannabis include cachexia (or wasting syndrome), nausea, 
and other diagnosable conditions associated with can-
cer. The National Cancer Institute (2016) indicated that 
medical cannabis can successfully stimulate appetites and 
be helpful for patients who experience nausea and pain. 
Neurologic diseases also are considered amenable to med-
ical cannabis; the American Academy of Neurology (Patel 
et al., 2014) supports the use of oral cannabis to improve 
symptoms among persons with multiple sclerosis.
We determined that up to 21 states have approved the 
use of medical cannabis for such age-related diagnosable 
conditions (Marijuana Policy Project, 2016). In reviewing 
registry data for patients older than 65 years in Colorado, 
glaucoma was the primary condition assigned to 3.6% 
of older program registrants. (Note: Colorado is the only 
state that offered data by age and condition.) We found 
cachexia was diagnosed among 1.6% of the registrants, 
5.7% had nausea, and 10.8% were identified as having 
cancer. The age-related neurologic conditions that are cov-
ered by state programs include amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis (covered in nine states), muscular dystrophy (two 
states), and Parkinson’s disease (three states), and 15.9% 
of those older than 65 years in Colorado were diagnosed 
with one of these. Eight states have extended coverage to

 persons with Alzheimer’s disease (N = 8), and three states 
have approved cannabis for persons receiving palliation or 
hospice. In Montana, 14 people obtained medical cannabis 
to help navigate the end of life in 2015.
Still, by far, the primary application of medical cannabis 
has been to alleviate pain, generally defined as central and 
peripheral neuropathic pain or more specifically as nocicep-
tive pain associated with a particular condition (Erickson & 
 
Kiser, 2016). We determined 19 states have approved the 
provision of medical cannabis for persons diagnosed with 
symptoms of pain and, in reviewing the patient registry 
data, 89.7% of those older than 65 years in the Colorado 
program had listed pain as a primary or secondary con-
dition. In an independent study of persons who enrolled 
in a Michigan medical cannabis program, Illgen and his 
colleagues found that 87% of new program participants 
were looking to relieve symptoms of pain. They also found 
that 27% of these newly enrolled patients were older than 
50 years, and 79% of these older participants never used 
cannabis before (Ilgen et al., 2013).
In linking the state registry data with the number of 
approved conditions, it was apparent that states with higher 
participation rates among older adults had approved the 
use of cannabis for a greater number of age-related condi-
tions including neuropathic pain. As more states look to 
legalize medical cannabis and expand the menu of quali-
fied conditions, we suspect the number of older adults who 
take cannabis should increase substantially as perceived 
medical need appears to be a prominent starting point for 
those who take cannabis for the first time since they were 
younger or for the first time ever (Figure 4).
Moreover, the Institute of Medicine (1999) and American 
College of Physicians (2008) have endorsed the use of medi-
cal cannabis for a limited number of age-related conditions, 
and such endorsements appear to be having an impact on 
the perceptions of medical doctors and other health care 
providers. In a survey of 1,446 readers of the New England 
Journal of Medicine, Adler and Colbert (2013) found that 
76% supported the use of medical cannabis in a case study 
in which an older woman was diagnosed with metastatic 
cancer and suffering with nausea and pain. Although sev-
eral other provider organizations (e.g., American Medical 
Association, American Nurses Association, American 
Pharmacists Association) have stopped short of endorsing 
the use of medical cannabis, they all have called for more 
public education and training of their provider constitu-
encies with particular emphasis being placed on differen-
tiating the legal risks associated with a doctor prescribing 
cannabis (i.e., a FDA violation) relative to the risks of a 
doctor recommending it (i.e., as protected by free speech). 
Arguably, as medical doctors and other allied health profes-
sionals become more educated about the potential uses of 
medical cannabis and how to communicate this informa-
tion legally, they may be more likely to recommend can-
nabis for some of their older patients. As suggested earlier, 
such authoritative cues may alter patient attitudes about 
taking medical cannabis, particularly among those who 
historically had not supported cannabis legalization or may 
continue to disapprove of taking cannabis for recreational 
purposes.
Cannabis, Opioids, and End of Life
Much of the previous work concerning cannabis use 
among older persons has pointed to negative outcomes. 
As more older persons take cannabis, the number of those 
who abuse or become dependent will increase; as more 
older adults abuse or become dependent on cannabis, they 
will place a greater demand on specialty service providers 
(Blazer & Wu, 2009; Wu & Blazer, 2011). Although these 
studies present valid public health concerns that already 
have captured the attention of policy makers and pub-
lic officials, the use of cannabis among older adults also 
should be juxtaposed to the potential benefits.
For example, some older adults are taking cannabis 
as a viable substitute or complement for addictive and 
potentially harmful prescription medications. Lucas and 
colleagues (2012) found that among 404 registered par-
ticipants from 4 Canadian compassionate care clubs (i.e., 
authorized cannabis dispensaries), 67.8% took cannabis 
as a substitute for prescription medication. In a follow-
up, 80% of another sample of 473 club members reported 
substituting cannabis for prescribed pharmaceutical medi-
cations. These substitutions occurred most often among 
persons experiencing pain (87%), and the primary reasons 
for doing so was to decrease side effects and improve symp-
tom management (Lucas et al., 2015).
Increased access to medical cannabis also has been 
linked with a reduction in negative outcomes associated 
with opioid use. In contrast to the number of opioid over-
doses within states with and without MMLs, Smart (2015) 
found that opioid related deaths increased across all states, 
but such deaths were 25% less likely to occur in those 
states with MMLs and opioid deaths specifically were less

 common among older persons. Given that West, Severtson, 
Green, and Dart (2015) reported that the rate of prescrip-
tion opioids is highest among women older than 60 years 
(8.6% compared with 4.7% for those aged 20–39 years), 
such findings highlight a need to consider medical canna-
bis as a possible alternative to prescribing opioids for older 
adults—a sentiment expressed publicly at a recent Senate 
Special Committee on Aging hearing entitled, “Opioid Use 
Among Seniors – Issues and Emerging Trends.”
At the state level, Montana and New Mexico recently 
have moved to approve cannabis for dying patients. In 
doing so, these states have established a viable alternative 
to address the long-standing public health failure to ade-
quately treat pain at the end of life (Imhof & Kaskie, 2008). 
Not only have these state policy makers facilitated targeted 
access to those who would appear to benefit substantially 
from taking medical cannabis, they have taken a substan-
tial leap to advance implementation of the federal Patient 
Self-Determination Act of 1989. In particular, by adding 
end of life to the roster of qualified conditions, these states 
have facilitated the opportunity for older adults to partici-
pate in directing their own course of end-of-life care and 
have offered a greater number of real choices about dying 
as pain-free as possible.
Conclusion
We have used an age–period–cohort paradigm to explicate 
divergent pathways of cannabis use among the older adult 
population and demonstrate how attitudes, laws, and indi-
vidual health needs can shape these paths. This analysis has 
lead us to identify several kinds of research that would be 
useful to policy makers. On the one hand, we certainly rec-
ognize a need for more biomedical studies focusing on the 
individual health outcomes of taking cannabis for a wide 
array of age-related diseases and disorders. We also see a 
need for clinical research studies that compare older adults’ 
use of cannabis with prescription opioids and other phar-
maceutical derivatives such as cannabidiol (Ahmed et al., 
2015). On the other hand, there is a need to expand pub-
lic health research that encompasses the legal, medical, and 
behavioral issues surrounding cannabis use and older adults. 
How are doctors and other professionals talking to older 
patients about medical cannabis? Should states with limited 
MMLs extend coverage to more age-related medical con-
ditions such as end of life? Should states extend insurance 
coverage for older adults who take cannabis as a substitute 
for opioids? At this time, these sorts of critical public health 
policy questions cannot be answered largely because there 
is a pervasive lack of reliable and representative information 
being collected about cannabis and older persons. A state-
wide or national survey that accounts for how changing 
legal, medical, and other norms have affected older adults’ 
attitudes and behaviors about taking cannabis certainly 
would help advance the public policy conversation.
Meanwhile, the United States is about to enter a period 
when the older adult population is expected to double 
(Ortman et al., 2014), the cannabis economy may grow 
fivefold (Caulkins et al., 2015), and federal officials con-
tinue to wrestle incrementally with a variety of controver-
sial and technical issues such as whether cannabis should be 
classified in the same category as heroin (Bostwick, 2012). 
Although these certainly are critical issues for federal policy 
makers to resolve, it is here we turn our attention to the 
critical role of the states.
For more than two decades, cannabis policy across 
the United States has reflected a model of federalism in 
which state governments have become laboratories, as 
demonstrated by the increasing number of states that have 
advanced medical cannabis programs, the lack of enforce-
ment being exercised by key federal agencies, and the 
recent decision by the Supreme Court to refuse to consider 
the state of Nebraska’s claim against the state of Colorado 
(Sevigny & Pacula, 2014). By not actively enforcing the 
supremacy of federal policy concerning the classification 
of cannabis as a Schedule 1 narcotic, the states have been 
left to experiment with some of the most critical aspects of 
program development and implementation such as estab-
lishing eligibility criteria, defining dispensation mecha-
nisms, financing, and maintaining oversight (Sevigny & 
Pacula, 2014). Perhaps these laboratories also will experi-
ment with increasing use of cannabis among older persons 
as a way to reduce opioid misuse or the undertreatment of 
pain at the end of life.
