Introduction
Efficacy of modified diet and nutritional 
management has been illustrated in some 
tumors.[1‑4]
Ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, (90% of 
the calories fulfill from fat) adequate protein, 
low carbohydrate diet that produces ketone 
bodies through imitation metabolic changes 
subsequent starvation.[5,6] In 1920, KD 
was designed for treatment of epilepsy.[7] 
However, recent evidence suggests that it is 
effective on controlling of some metabolic 
disease.[8] This dietary restriction lowers 
plasma glucose levels and limits the 
energy source to some cells while raise 
circulating blood ketone levels.[9] Also, this 
diet imposes cells to rely on fat oxidation 
and 
mitochondrial 
respiration 
compare 
with glycolysis for energy production.[10] 
In this regard, these dietary modifications 
might be expected to reduce tumor size and 
growth rate which depend on glucose as an 
energy source during anaerobic glycolysis.

Abstract
Recently, interest in targeted cancer therapies via metabolic pathways has been renewed with the 
discovery that many tumors become dependent on glucose uptake during anaerobic glycolysis. Also 
the inability of ketone bodies metabolization due to various deficiencies in mitochondrial enzymes is 
the major metabolic changes discovered in malignant cells. Therefore, administration of a ketogenic 
diet (KD) which is based on high in fat and low in carbohydrates might inhibit tumor growth and 
provide a rationale for therapeutic strategies. So, we conducted this systematic review to assess the 
effects of KD on the tumor cells growth and survival time in animal studies. All databases were 
searched from inception to November 2015. We systematically searched the PubMed, Scopus, 
Google Scholars, Science Direct and Cochrane Library according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses statement. To assess the quality of included studies we used 
SYRCLE’s RoB tool. 268 articles were obtained from databases by primary search. Only 13 studies 
were eligible according to inclusion criteria. From included studies, 9 articles indicate that KD had a 
beneficial effect on tumor growth and survival time. Tumor types were included pancreatic, prostate, 
gastric, colon, brain, neuroblastoma and lung cancers. In conclusions, although studies in this field 
are rare and inconsistence, recent findings have demonstrated that KD can potentially inhibit the 
malignant cell growth and increase the survival time. Because of differences physiology between 
animals and humans, future studies in cancer patients treated with a KD are needed.

Also 
the 
inability 
of 
ketone 
bodies 
metabolization due to various deficiencies 
in mitochondrial enzymes, is one of the 
metabolic modification found in malignant 
cells. Further, ketone bodies possibly result 
in a decreasing the supply of gluconeogenic 
precursors by restriction of the branch chain 
amino acids oxidation.[11]
In this way, KD can provide a rationale 
for therapeutic strategies via tumor growth 
inhibition.[12] 
Although 
studies 
about 
association of mentioned diet and cancers 
are rare,[13] it was proposed that high 
fat intake and carbohydrate restriction 
associated with KD might be useful for 
cancer by providing sufficient energy 
substrates for peripheral tissues and as 
well as interfering with important cancer 
survival pathway.[14] However, the KD 
effects on tumor growth and survival are 
not similar.[9,15,16]
So, in the present literature we attempt to 
review systematically animal studies for 
evaluate the impact of KD on tumor cells 
growth and survival time.

Methods
This review was done base on Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses guidelines and 
has been registered at PROSPERO (CRD 42015023956).
Search strategies
By conducting a systematic review to assess the 
relationship between the KD effects on tumor cells growth 
and survival time, we have searched PubMed, Scopus, 
Google Scholars, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. 
All databases were searched from inception to November 
2015. We used the terms “KD” and “Cancer” or “Tumor” 
or “Neoplasm” without any restriction. Additionally, 
the reference list of each eligible article was manually 
reviewed to identify other related researches. All the 
review process independently was established by three 
investigators.
Study selection
Generally, articles were included if there were experimental 
studies on animals that reported effects of KD on tumor cells 
growth rate and survival time. Excluded studies involved 
cell lines studies and literatures that didn’t estimate tumor 
cells growth or survival time after KD. Also, documents 
that KD combined with other agents such as, hyperbaric 
oxygen therapy (HBO2T) and radio‑chemotherapy were 
excluded.
268 articles (PubMed 114, Scopus 25, Science Direct 68, 
Cochrane 1, Google Scholar 60) obtain from databases 
by primary search. After removing duplicate articles (60) 
relevant researches were identified from title, abstract 
and full text. Any disagreement between reviewers was 
resolved by refer to third reviewer. Finally, thirteen studies 
were included in this systematic review. The flow chart of 
the selection of studies is shown in Figure 1.
Data extraction
The data extracted from selected studies, included first 
author, country, year, animal model, cancer type, study 
design, age, sex, study duration, type of intervention, 
sample size, main result and P‑values were extracted. 
Characteristics of each study are illustrated in Table 1.
Quality assessment
To assess the quality of included studies we used 
SYRCLE’s RoB[17] tool that contains 10 items to investigate 
any important sources of bias such as allocation, adjust 
for confounder, assignment to the different groups 
adequately concealed during, animals randomized for 
housed, blinded investigators, animals random selection for 
outcome assessment, blinded outcome assessor, addressing 
incomplete outcome, free of selective outcome reporting 
and other risk of bias. Quality scores of these studies are 
shown in Table 1.
Results
From all identified articles, after applying inclusion criteria, 
13 studies were selected. All of them assessed the KD 
effects on tumor growth alone and 9 articles examined both 
tumor growth and survival time. Study duration, design and 
their quality were different between them. Most of studies 
had good quality and the mean score of them was near the 
60%.
Poff et al.[11] reported mice with systematic metastatic cancer 
that used KD represented a significant increase in survival 
time compare to control group. Also, bioluminescent signal 
showed a clear trend of reduced tumor growth. By day 
7 of intervention, mice in KD group lost about 10% of their 
body weight and keep that weight for end of intervention. 
Results revealed a significant correlation between body 
weight loss with increasing survival time.
This result has been replicated in another study.[12] Mice 
were injected with gastric tumor cells and then, randomly 
were divided into two feeding groups; either a KD or a 
standard diet (SD). The tumor growth and mean survival 
time in the KD group were significantly reduced and 
induced respectively, compared to the SD group. The tumor 
size and tumor volume were assessed with callipers and the 
ellipsoid formula respectively.
In another study[14] animals were acclimated on the Western 
diet (WD) for 4 days. After injected prostate tumor 
cells, animals were randomized in WD, noncarbohydrate 
ketogenic diet (NCKD) or 10% and 20% carbohydrate 
KD groups. In this intervention, results showed shortest 
survival among WD groups. Furthermore, diet containing 
20% carbohydrate had a slowest tumor growth and 
longest survival time. Also, among group that was on 10% 
carbohydrate diet, nonsignificant tendency for improved 
survival compared to WD was seen.
Zhou 
et 
al.[18] 
investigated 
on 
mice 
fed 
with 
KetoCal (KC) (a new KD that balanced nutritionally for 
high fat/low carbohydrate containing fat, carbohydrate, 
protein and fibre comprised 720 g, 30 g, 150 g, and 0 g/kg 
of the diet; respectively) in either unrestricted (UR) or 
restricted of caloric intake. The effects of KC on tumor 
growth and survival time were compared with an UR 
high carbohydrate SD. When KC diet was consumed in 
restricted amounts of calorie, decreased tumor growth and 
enhanced survival time relative to the control groups were 
seen significantly.
Another result revealed that KC enhanced survival and 
slowed tumor growth in brain tumor‑bearing mice. 
Following tumor cell implantation, animals were fed SD 
for 3 days and then were randomized to remain on SD or 
changed to KC that was providing a 4:1 ratio of fats to 
carbohydrates plus protein (72% fat, 15% protein, and 3% 
carbohydrate).[19]

In addition finding from Mavropoulos et al. showed 
that[20] adherence to a NCKD, without energy restriction, 
could reduce tumor growth and significantly extended 
survival relative to a high‑fat/moderate carbohydrate or 
moderate‑carbohydrate diet.
In another study, Morscher et al.[21] examined KD 
and/or calorie restriction on neuroblastoma tumor growth 
and survival time. After incubating tumor cells, mice 
were fed four different types of diet for over 5 week: SD, 
calorie‑restricted (CR‑SD), KD and CR‑KD. Components

of these regimes are given in Table 1. Tumors volume 
of all groups was significantly inhibited compare to SD 
group. Toward of SD group survival of mice on CR‑SD, 
KD and CR‑KD were prominently increased. It should be 
mentioned that body weight loss on the last day of study in 
the CR groups was below 20%.
To determine the influence of a KD with different kinds 
of fatty acids on tumor growth and survival time in mice 
with colon cancer, Hao et al.[22] split animals into three 
feeding groups: A KD rich in omega 3 fatty acids and 
medium‑chain triglycerides (MCT) (MKD group), lard 
only (LKD group) and SD group for 45 days. All animals in 
KD groups intake the UR‑KD and showed a clear increase 
in body weight in duration of study. However, mean body 
weight difference was not significant. Mean tumor size in 
different groups showed retardated tumor growth in MKD 
and LKD compare with SD group. As well as utilization 
of this diet with different types of fatty acids significantly 
increase survival time. Although reduced tumor growth 
and increased survival time in MKD groups was efficient 
than other, but this difference between two groups was not 
significant.
In contrast, another study[16] documented that no significant 
differences in the tumor volumes and overall survival among 
NCKD, 10% carbohydrate diet, or 20% carbohydrate diet 
groups, after animals were fed a WD for a 5‑day. Although 
there were no significant differences in tumor volumes at 
any time, at days 52 and 59 in 10% carbohydrate group, 
mice had larger tumors compare with 20% carbohydrate 
group. In order to avoid from weight loss, NCKD animal 
were fed about 10% extra calories relative to WD; while 
the 10% and 20% carbohydrate groups were fed with 7.5% 
more calories.
In one study, Allen et al. used two kind diets for mice 
bearing lung cancer. The mice in intervention and control 
group were fed KC and SD (25% protein, 21% fat, and 
54% carbohydrate) respectively for 80 days. This Result 
shows that KD could slow tumor growth relative to control 
group.[10,12]
In 
another 
experimental 
study[23] 
the 
mouse 
with 
brain tumor were randomized and allocated to one 
of four diet groups: (1) the SD fed ad libitum or 
unrestricted (SD‑UR), (2) the KD fed ad libitum or 
unrestricted (KD‑UR), (3) the SD restricted to 40% (SD‑R), 
or (4) the KD restricted to 40% of the SD (KD‑R). Although 
the tumor grew rapidly in both UR‑fed mice groups, tumor 
growth decreased significantly in SD or KD restricted 
feeding group. Although total body weight decreased, the 
restricted fed mice were healthy and more active than the 
mice in other group. No signs of micro nutrient deficiency 
were observed in the restricted fed mice.
Another study[15] was conducted on mice that prostate cancer 
cells were injected sub‑cutaneous in the flank. Mice were

randomized to three groups: WD, SD and NCKD plus SD. 
Mice were fed and weighed three times per week. Also, feed 
was adjusted to maintain body weights similar. Tumor sizes 
were measured twice a week with calipers once palpable. 
This research emphasized that NCKD was significantly 
associated with lower tumor volumes.
Shukla et al. in their study used two type diets: Normal diet 
and KD for mice induced pancreatic cancer in 3 weeks. 
After intervention ketone bodies diminish cancer cell 
growth. In this research in order to assessment of cachexia, 
muscle weight was recorded. A 45% increase in the muscle 
weight in KD‑fed mice rather than controls was reported.[24]
In order to avoid weight loss in most of these studies 
KD was administered with high energy level. Therefore, 
significant changes in weight didn’t observe between 
groups with different regimes. Body weights remained 
similar in intervention and control groups despite the 
major differences in the caloric and composition content of 
mentioned diets.[10,12,15,16,18‑20,22,25]
Discussion
This is a systematic review of 13 studies that were 
evaluated the KD effects on tumor growth and survival 
time in animal models.
In this study, all included articles indicate that KD had a 
inhibitory effect on tumor growth[9,10,15,21‑25] and 9 researches 
expressed that KD could enhance survival time.[9,12,19,21‑23,26] 
Among these researches, the greatest effect was seen for 
the KD with omega 3 fatty acids 21.8%, MCT 36.2%, lard 
11%, carbohydrate 3% and protein 20% (MKD).
Compliance with animal welfare regulations, long duration 
of follow up, similar conditions at baseline in the groups, 
control of body weight and calorie intake are strengths of 
most of these evidence.
Several limitations need to be taken into account in the 
interpretation of our findings. Even though animal models 
still remain a unique source of information, differences 
in physiology between animal and humans may lead to 
limited successful translation from animal models to human 
experimentation. So, these findings must be repeated and 
confirmed by human studies for applying these dietary 
restriction regimens in cancer patients.
Secondly, inadequate randomization of animals and small 
sample size[9,10,25] are limitation in some experiments.[13] In 
addition, in animal studies, cancer cells incubate to normal 
tissue, therefore, it is important that the disease was induced 
before or after randomization.[21] Also, a heterogeneity 
existed in KD prescribed in different time, before or after of 
injection tumor. Further, considering the different survival 
time is an important bias across studies.[15,16] Also, tumor 
growth assessment by calipers may have a measurement 
error.[16]
Although the mean score quality for all articles considered 
was 60%, considering the risk of other bias such as 
potential conflicts of interest, sample size calculation, 
appropriateness of dose selection and measurement of 
outcomes are important.[27] Given the nature of a systematic 
literature search, consideration of these limitations like 
publication, reporting, performance and detection biases is 
also important.
Many studies above the past 60 years have not only 
supported glucose consumption in tumor cells but also show 
influence of glucose on cancer survival and metastasis.[28]
A substantial metabolic and molecular distinction between 
cancerous and normal cells has been known. One great 
metabolic difference is cellular respiration, glucose 
metabolism, and energy production.[29] KDs may be work 
as an adjuvant tumor therapy by two distinct mechanisms 
that both of them elevate the oxidative stress in tumor 
cells. Lipid metabolism restricts the availability of glucose 
for glycolysis; also lipid metabolism forces tissues to take 
their energy from mitochondrial metabolism.[28] Most of 
tumor cells have abnormities in number and operation of 
mitochondria. In the other hand, mitochondria performance 
is necessary for ketone body oxidation. So, tumor cells 
unable to metabolize the ketone bodies,[30] and they will 
be anticipated to experiment oxidative stress induced by 
limited glucose metabolism in the feeding KD. Similar to 
fat metabolism, protein forces cells to get their energy from 
mitochondrial metabolism.[28,31] Further, cancer cells have 
low adaptability to nutrient change that induced by KD 
or caloric restriction.[21,32,33] Overall, tumor cells have high 
levels of glucose uptake, glycolysis and pentose phosphate 
pathway activation for growth,[22] and use of KD cause an 
elevation in blood ketones, reduction of blood glucose and 
restriction of energy supply for cancer tissues.[7]
Serine/threonine kinase Akt most frequently activated in 
human cancer and cause increasing of cell proliferation 
and oncogenic mutation rates and inhibition of apoptosis. 
Reduced Akt levels by KD may be responsible mechanisms 
for the favorite effects of this diet on cancer.[34]
Reactive 
oxygen 
species 
(ROS) 
accumulation 
following by Akt‑stimulated,[35] may also help to tumor 
genesis.[34] KD can be prevented ROS production and 
increase blood antioxidative capacity.[36] Furthermore, KD 
can improve mitochondrial function by decreasing of ROS 
production[18] through restrict glycolysis and increase fatty 
acid oxidation.
Also, this dietary modification may shift gene expression 
involved in oxidative stress and inflammation in tumor 
tissue to a style seen in a normal tissue.[37] Further, reducing 
of ROS production, inflammatory cytokines and circulating 
levels of arachidonic acid are multiple possible mechanisms 
of observed favorite effects by KD on cancer.[38‑40]

In addition, NCKD lead to lower levels of circulating 
insulin and insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1), as 
growth factors in some cancer, and the IGF‑I/IGF binding 
protein (IGFBP)‑3 ratio as an indicator of bioactive 
IGF‑I.[12,19] It was shown that lower expression level of 
IGF‑1 are linked with slower tumor growth. Also, high 
levels of IGFBP‑3 may have an anticancer property via 
proapoptotic pathway activation.[12,22]
In contrast, some studies indicated that KD caused cellular 
metabolic oxidative stress by elevated ketone levels or 
chronic exposure to β‑hydroxybutyrate.[28] Also, KD may 
increase the production of lipid peroxidation, protein 
damage and stress oxidative.[28] It should be noted that in 
this study various tumor with different characteristics were 
assessed which lead to different response to KD.
It should be mentioned that KD can create various 
complications; dehydration is the first most common 
prevalent during initial fasting course. Gastrointestinal 
disturbance 
is 
the 
next 
complication 
including 
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation that linked 
to poor toleration of the diet. Furthermore, the KD is an 
unusually high‑fat diet, so changing in lipid profile should 
be considered.[41] The effect of KD on blood triglyceride 
to be more evident but KD can have positive effect on 
decrease of total cholesterol and increment in high‑density 
lipoprotein; if this diet enrichment with ω‑3and MCT fatty 
acids.[42] From rare but serious complication, it can be 
noted the acute pancreatic and cardiomyopathy. In addition 
to these complications, hypoproteinemia, hyperuremia, 
hyponatremia, persistent acidosis, hypomagnesia have 
observed too.[41,43] In addition, a number of complications 
on bone and mineral metabolism such as hypercalciuria, 
urine acidification, hypocitraturia and kidney stones, was 
related to the KD.[44] However, recent study showed a KD 
approach is tolerable and can potentially be an adjuvant to 
standard treatments among cancer patients.[45]
Conclusions
Although in the current review included studies were 
different in tumor size measurement methods, cancer types, 
sample size, carbohydrate amount of KD and intervention 
time; but most of them demonstrated that KD significantly 
show increase in survival time mean and a clear trend of 
slower tumor growth in pancreatic, prostate, gastric, brain, 
lung cancer.[6,9,10,14‑19]
Further studies with longer duration and well‑designed are 
needed to determine the effects of KD on cancers indices 
with considering side effects.
