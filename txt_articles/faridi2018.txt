The diversity of peptides displayed by class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) plays an essential role in T cell im-
munity. The peptide repertoire is extended by various posttranslational modifications, including proteasomal
splicing of peptide fragments from distinct regions of an antigen to form nongenomically templated cis-spliced
sequences. Previously, it has been suggested that a fraction of the immunopeptidome constitutes such cis-spliced
peptides; however, because of computational limitations, it has not been possible to assess whether trans-spliced pep-
tides (i.e., the fusion of peptide segments from distinct antigens) are also bound and presented by HLA molecules,
and if so, in what proportion. Here, we have developed and applied a bioinformatic workflow and demonstrated
that trans-spliced peptides are presented by HLA-I, and their abundance challenges current models of proteasomal
splicing that predict cis-splicing as the most probable outcome. These trans-spliced peptides display canonical HLA-
binding sequence features and are as frequently identified as cis-spliced peptides found bound to a number of differ-
ent HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes. Structural analysis reveals that the junction between spliced peptides is highly solvent
exposed and likely to participate in T cell receptor interactions. These results highlight the unanticipated diversity of
the immunopeptidome and have important implications for autoimmunity, vaccine design, and immunotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
The proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
[human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules in humans] play a
critical role in adaptive immunity by binding to intracellular peptide
antigens and presenting them on the surface of cells for recognition
by CD8+ T cells (1). The canonical mechanism for HLA-I–bound pep-
tide (p-HLA) production is degradation of intracellular proteins by
the proteasome, which generates peptides with lengths between 2
and 22 amino acids (2). These antigenic peptide precursors are subse-
quently transported into the endoplasmic reticulum via the transporter
associated with antigen-processing (TAP) molecule. Further peptidase
trimming generates peptides typically between 8 and 12 amino acids in
length that bind to nascent HLA-I molecules before being exported to
the cell surface. Posttranslational modification (PTM) of p-HLA can
profoundly influence the composition of the immunopeptidome and
T cell recognition (3, 4). For instance, although considered to be a rare
event (5–7), recent studies have shown that proteasomes can also ligate
distinct peptide fragments (termed here spliced peptides), producing se-
quences that are noncontiguous and therefore not linearly templated in
the genome (5, 6, 8). The origin of spliced peptide segments can be from
the same protein (cis-splicing) or different proteins (trans-splicing)
(Fig. 1A). Althoughthe ability of HLA-I to present linear peptides is well
known (5), the potential for binding of cis- and trans-spliced peptides
has received limited investigation. Liepe et al. (9) recently reported that
a substantial (~30%) fraction of p-HLA are short-distance cis-spliced
peptides. However, although trans-spliced peptides have been reported
for HLA-II, and the generation (with similar efficiency as cis-spliced
peptides) of several HLA-I trans-spliced peptides has been shown to
occur in vitro and in vivo, the relevance of trans-spliced peptides in
HLA-I immunopeptidomes has not yet been determined (4, 10).
The most comprehensive method for investigating HLA-I immuno-
peptidomes is through immunoaffinity purification of p-HLA-I and
subsequent sequencing of the bound peptides by tandem liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The data acquired
by this approach are then interrogated using algorithms that rely on
reference proteome or proteogenomic databases for spectral match-
ing (11, 12). Although this method is successful for identifying linear
p-HLA-I, the absence of sequence information for nonlinear pep-
tides in the predicted proteome precludes the use of this workflow
for the identification of spliced peptides. As a means to overcome this,
Liepe et al. (9) generated a theoretical database containing proximal
(donor segments within 20 amino acids) cis-spliced peptides for
searches of nonlinear peptide antigens. However, considering the ad-
ditional complexity introduced by peptides that are generated via
trans-splicing and the possibility of more distally cis-spliced pep-
tides, similar algorithms to account for these peptides would gener-
ate extremely large databases that make computational analyses
impractical. One substantial barrier to comprehensively identifying
trans-peptides is the availability of computational resources required
to process all permutations of trans- and cis-spliced peptides (11). Here,
we have developed a bioinformatics workflow to identify p-HLA and
discriminate between linear and spliced peptides. We have used this
workflow to analyze MS data acquired from p-HLA purified from a

RESULTS
To identify spliced peptides from eluted p-HLA repertoires, we lever-
aged the capabilities of de novo peptide sequencing of high-quality
MS/MS spectra combined with database searching (13) and an in-house
developed algorithm (“hybrid finder”) for hierarchical source protein
identification. Briefly (see Fig. 1B and figs. S1 and S2 for a schema),
we first identified linear p-HLA by the PEAKS Studio 8.5 software (a
de novo–based peptide library search algorithm), matching against the
human reference proteome at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold.
We reasoned that the remaining unidentified de novo sequences (them-
selves derived from high-quality MS/MS spectra) would constitute any of
the following: (i) true linear sequences that fell below the stringent 1%
FDR cutoff applied in the above database search; (ii) potential cis- or
trans-spliced peptides; or (iii) untemplated peptides with no biological
explanation at this stage or whose de novo sequencing was not of high
enough accuracy. We therefore extracted these high-confidence de novo
candidates (set at a maximum of five sequence assignments per spec-
trum) and processed each with our hybrid finder algorithm, which as-
signed a possible explanation as above. To make the most conservative
estimate possible, these results were then ranked by likelihood, our ra-
tionale being that a linear (i.e., proteome-matched) explanation takes
precedence over cis-splicing, which in turn takes precedence over trans-
splicing. If no explanation could be found, then the sequence was dis-
carded. This resulted in a single assigned sequence per spectrum, which
we then built into a proteome-like FASTA database, merging it with the
human reference proteome and thus generating a combined sample-
specific database. After this, all the mass spectra were researched against
the combined library, and peptides were identified at a 1% FDR cutoff.
Spliced and linear HLA-I peptides share similar overall
sequence features
We applied thisdata-driven workflow to MS data acquired from p-HLA
purified from 17 different monoallelic cell lines, comprising expression
of eight and nine different HLA-A and HLA-B alleles, respectively. We
used monoallelic (14) cell lines to overcome the ambiguity in p-HLA
motifs that may arise from the coexpression of multiple HLA alleles.
In total, we have identified more than 50,000 p-HLA peptides (range
of 978 to 11,110 peptides and median of 2781 peptides per HLA
allotype; Fig. 2, A and B). Although 38,345 (~72%) of these peptides
could be mapped to sequences within the human proteome, a substan-
tial (28%) fraction of the data was found to be best explained by peptide
splicing (note that less than 3% of all de novo candidates could not be
mapped to any splicing explanation). When assessing individual alleles,
we observed a range of 12.6% (HLA-A*24:02) to 44.7% (HLA-B*15:02)
(HLA-B*51:01 median, 24.6%) of spliced peptides. A high proportion of
these spliced peptides could only be explained by a reaction in trans, with
this pattern observed for both HLA-A and HLA-B peptidomes (Fig. 2C).
Given the two main factors that affect peptide binding to HLA are
sequence length (typically 8 to 12 amino acids for class I) and HLA-
binding amino acid motifs (allele-specific), we next assessed the degree
to which these peptide properties were maintained across linear and
spliced peptides for any given allele (Fig. 2, D and E). We found that
spliced peptides also conformed to an 8- to 12–amino acid length pro-
file; however,theirlengthswere skewedtowardmore 10-mersandfewer
9-mers [P < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) multiple-
comparison test] in comparison to linear peptides (Fig. 2D).

tation pathways for display at the cell surface. (B) Workflow for the identification of linear and spliced peptides. From high-quality MS/MS spectra, an initial de novo–assisted
database search (using the reference human proteome) was carried out, filtering the data at a 1% FDR. Subsequently, all high-quality de novo–only sequenced peptides (the top
five sequences per spectrum) that fell below this threshold were searched using our in-house algorithm to hierarchically rank peptides as to whether they had a linear > cis >
trans explanation (or, failing this, were discarded). The top-ranked peptides for each spectrum sequence were then built into a custom FASTA-formatted database and merged
with the human proteome, and the original MS/MS data were researched, taking the 1% FDR cutoff as a final output of results.

 Next, we compared HLA-binding motifs in spliced and linear pep-
tides in each dataset through statistics-based visualization using iceLogo
(15, 16) (Fig. 2E and fig. S3), examining amino acid enrichment at each
position of the 9-mer and 10-mer peptides. For all HLA allotypes in this
dataset, the major anchor positions were at position 2 (P2) and/or P3, as
well as PW (the C-terminal anchor residue). Across all alleles, we found
that the particular amino acid frequency at the PW position correlated
strongly (r > 0.9, Pearson test) between spliced and linear peptides (Fig.
2F). At the P2/P3 position, we noted more variance in concordance be-
tween spliced and linear peptides—for example, HLA-B*27:05 and
HLA-B*15:02 showed the weakest correlation at P2 (r = 0.4863) and
P3 (r = 0.5388), respectively (Fig. 2F). Nonetheless, the correlation
was statistically significant (P < 0.05, Pearson test) across all alleles.
To examine this potential impact on HLA-binding affinity, we used
NetMHC 4 or NetMHCcons to predict in silico binding affinity of both
linear and spliced p-HLA (9-mers and 10-mers) for their corresponding
HLA allomorph. We found that, on average, 77.3% of linear peptides
were predicted to bind to their corresponded HLA, whereas for spliced
peptides this value was significantly (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon test) lower
(46.86%; fig. S4).
Experimental validation confirms spliced peptide sequence
authenticity and p-HLA binding
To validate the authenticity of identified spliced peptides, we used data
from the C1R-B*57:01 immunopeptidome. We selected this dataset be-
cause it contained the greatest number of overall peptides (>10,000) and
because this allomorph has strict and distinctive peptide binding char-
acteristics. One possible explanation for the existence of p-HLAs that
are unable to be mapped to a reference proteome is that either the
reference proteome does not account for all known translated tran-
scripts or the genomic background of the cell line (in this case, the
B-lymphoblastoid cell line C1R from which many of our monoallelic
datasets are derived) bears nonsynonymous mutations or expresses
unanticipated transcripts. To address the first possibility, we searched all
B*57:01 peptides against the Ensembl protein database (converting all
Ile to Leu and including all ab initio predicted peptides within this
database) and matched 99.9% of linear peptides but just 0.6% of spliced
peptides. Then, for the second possibility, we carried out detailed RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the C1R-B*57:01 (as well as parental
C1R) cell lines and assessed whether any mutations or unanticipated
transcripts could give rise to peptide sequences that we attributed to
spliced peptides. From all RNA-seq reads, we carried out six-frame
translations, and (after removing redundancy associated with isobaric
amino acids and converting all Ile to Leu) we searched for any occur-
rences of our HLA-B*57:01 linear and spliced peptides. This analysis
showed that, although 98.7% of all linear peptides could be matched
to the RNA-seq data, only 12.7% of spliced peptides could be found
(table S1). Thus, even with the most far-fetched transcript explanations
from this in-depth immunopeptidogenomics approach, the vast major-
ity of spliced peptides cannot be templated to the transcriptome.
As an additional verification of the integrity of the de novo–based
sequence assignment, we selected 28 identified HLA-B*57:01 spliced
peptides for synthesis and compared the LC–MS/MS spectra of the syn-
thetic to the corresponding original p-HLA–eluted spectra, computing
their correlation score and P value for similarity assessment (17). All
eluted peptides matched significantly (P < 0.05) to their synthetic pep-
tide counterparts (see Fig. 3, A and B; fig. S5; and table S2), consistent with
otherstudiesthathaveshowntheutilityofdenovo–basedsequenceassign-
ments(13,18–21)andhighlighttheaccuracyofdenovosequencingwithin
the present study. After this, we sought to validate our de novo sequencing
approach for p-HLA genomically untemplated peptide identification on
several levels (fig. S2), as detailed in Materials and methods and in the ex-
tensive Supplementary Materials. This included finding minimal (<1%)
spliced peptide detection in complex proteolytic digests generated by tryp-
sin or elastase digests of mammalian cellular proteomes, eliminating a role
for common amino acid PTM in false assignment of spectra, and testing
for any bias in database and search algorithms by using several search
engines for the library-based searches. We have also precluded potential
contamination from bovine peptides contained within the culture media
and potential viral and retroviral sources of the parental antigen.
To further confirm that the spliced peptides identified from the
repertoire of HLA-B*57:01 could bind and be presented by this allele,
we selected a panel of peptides for in vitro stabilization binding assays
(using the TAP-deficient cell line T2-B*57:01; Fig. 3C) and for refolding
of peptide B*57:01 complexes for determination of crystal structures
(Fig. 3D). Of the five (four trans- and one cis-) spliced peptides that were
tested for in vitro stabilization, four were found to bind HLA-B*57:01
withsimilarcapability to a known B*57:01-restricted linearpeptide (Fig.
3C). One peptide, trans-spliced LSDSTARDVTW, was not observed to
stabilize B*57:01 in this assay.
For crystallization of p-HLA complexes, our choice of four spliced
peptides included those with defined ligation site possibilities: cis-
LALLTG + VRW, trans-LSDSTA + RDVTW, and trans-TSMSF +
VPRPWeachhad only one possible ligation site, whereasthe trans-peptide
GSFDYSGVHLW could be spliced as either GSFDY + SGVHLW or
GSFDYS+ GVHLW. Crystalstructureswere determinedto aresolution
of between 2.04 and 1.83 Å (structure statistics summarized in table S3),
with the data permitting the visualization of the four p-HLA structures
and, with the exception of the LSDSTARDVTW peptide, the junction
of peptide splicing. That is, all peptide residues including the junction
points of GSFDYSGVHLW, LALLTGVRW, and TSMSFVPRPW were
resolved in the density; however, for LSDSTARDVTW (the same pep-
tide that was not found to detectably stabilize T2-B*57:01 in Fig. 3C),
the Ala6-Arg7 splice junction was disordered, and we interpret this to
reflect a high degree of flexibility in this region (Fig. 3D). Analysis of
these four novel structures and comparison with previously determined
HLA-B*57:01 complexes [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession codes:
2RFX (22), 3UPR (23), 3VRI (24), and 5T6Y (25)] showed a high degree
of structural conservation, with root mean square deviations between
0.21 and 0.36 Å (over Ca positions of their peptide-binding clefts amino
acids 1 to 177). Further, each spliced peptide comprised canonical
anchor residues at P2 (Ala/Ser) and PW (Trp) that were accommo-
dated in the B and F pockets of HLA-B*57:01 in an orthodox fashion
(Fig. 3D). Accordingly, all four spliced peptides were bound to and
presented by HLA-B*57:01 in the canonical manner.
To understand whether the overall level of expression of HLA-
B*57:01 spliced peptides differed from that of linear peptides, we used a
label-free quantification approach in measuring the distribution of peak
areasfromthe massspectradata. Consistent withthereport of Liepe et al.
(9) on the relative abundance of cis-spliced peptides, spliced peptides
were present at lower abundance than linear peptides (fig. S6). Specifical-
ly, spliced peptides accounted for 16.7% of the abundance of linear pep-
tides in the immunopeptidome of C1R-B*57:01.

 spliced peptide to determine whether there was a bias underlying the
ligation position and/or flanking residues of donor peptide segments
(Fig. 4). Because there are different segment length combinations and
different donorproteins that may comprise any given spliced peptide, to
aid this analysis, we first extracted all spliced peptides from all 17 data-
sets that had only one possibility for ligation (n = 3029 “unique” spliced
peptides). From these peptides, we analyzed the amino acid pairing
at the P1 (C terminus of the N-terminal segment) and P1′ (N terminus
of the C-terminal segment) positions (Fig. 4A; see also fig. S7 comparing
the log2 ratio between observed and expected amino acid pairs from the
human proteome). These data were compared with adjacent amino
acids located across the equivalent central position of linear peptides
(n = 31,297) and also with a set of 31,000 amino acid pairs derived from
randomly generated peptides whose amino acid frequency was com-
puted to resemble that of the natural human proteome. Data show that
linear peptides exhibit a similar distribution to these randomly derived
pairs, which largely reflects the natural amino acid frequency (note that
all Ile has been substituted for Leu in this analysis to account for
redundancy in the de novo candidate sequences; Fig. 4A). However,
an analysis of the spliced peptide junction shows a markedly different
distribution, with notable enrichment in small nonpolar residues
(Gly/Ala/Ser) pairing either with the same residues or withhydrophobic
Ile/Leu/Val in either orientation. Pro-Ile/Leu pairing was also of note
but was only observed to be enriched in a P1-P1′ direction.
Although this more limited (3029) subset of peptides allowed for an
analysis of the splicing junction by virtue of only a single explanation of
segment pairing per peptide, we next sought to determine how many
donor sites might contribute to peptide splicing. That is, for any given
spliced peptide, there may be multiple proteins that can supply a donor
segment (e.g., a 9-mer peptide can be broken into 1 + 8, 2 + 7, 3 + 6, and
so on segments, and thus there may be a multitude of ways of making
the same peptide). To address this question, we took all unique spliced
nonamers from our datasets (5806 peptides), segmented each peptide
into all possibilities, and counted the number of occurrences of each
segment from the reference human proteome (Fig. 4B). As expected, as
segment length increased, the number of possible sources decreased,

 with a median of just two sources once a segment length of six amino
acidswas reached. Using these data, it wastherefore possible to compute
the number of permutations of generating a spliced peptide by multiply-
ingthenumberofoccurrencesofonesegmentwithitscorrespondingpair
(e.g., for a nonamer, a segment length of 2 has to be paired with its
corresponding segment length of 7). Most of the peptides contribute to
the 4 + 5 or 5 + 4 segment pairing (Fig. 4C). However, it is notable that,
althoughtheoccurrencesof1+8or8+1pairingwererareracrossthisset
ofpeptides,theircombinedpermutationsareultimatelyhigherbecauseof
the overwhelmingly large number of single amino acid sources that can
pair with the segment of eight amino acids (with a similar situation being
true for 2 + 7, 7 + 2, and so on, until the 4 + 5/5 + 4 trough is reached).
Thus, collectively, we observe a significant proportion of nonlinearly
encoded peptides that contribute to the immunopeptidome of a num-
ber of HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes. We propose, as others have, that
these peptides are generated through a reverse proteolytic mechanism,
which may include the recently reported proteasomal catalyzed peptide
splicing events (4, 9, 26). Their existence in the immunopeptidome has
profound implications for immunity and will be the subject of future
research.
DISCUSSION
We have developed a workflow for the comprehensive identification of
spliced p-HLA ligands, and, as a result, we report the considerable con-
tribution of trans-spliced peptides, as well as both proximal and distal
cis-spliced peptides, to the immunopeptidome. The unanticipated pro-
portion of trans-spliced peptides reveals additional complexity of the
immunopeptidome to that which has recently been documented (9).
Comparison of peptide-binding motifs across the 17 different alleles
tested shows that, for any given allele, linear and spliced peptides share
highly similar PW preferences and similar enrichment in P2/P3 anchor
residues. Given that selection of peptide binding occurs downstream of
proteasomal processing [notwithstanding
trimming by enzymes such as endoplas-
mic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP)],
it is not unexpected that spliced peptides
share similar binding motifs to linear pep-
tides, but the discrepancies observed at
P2/P3 (notable examples being that of
HLA-B*27:05 at P2 and HLA-B*07:02 at
P3) may perhaps be accounted for by
splicing selection/ligation constraints put
onto residues proximal to the splicing
junction. Such subtle differences highlight
the requirement to train binding predic-
tion algorithms for this class of peptides.
One of the assumptions made about
the genesis of trans-spliced peptides is
that the proteasome must accommodate
and process multiple polypeptide chains
simultaneously (27)—the probability of
two distinct protein substrates being
degraded at the same time inside one
proteasome is low (10). However, we pro-
pose that, for trans-spliced peptides [as
shown before in cis-spliced peptides
(28)], it is not necessary that each of two
different segments always originates from
a particular position of a protein. For short segments of spliced peptides,
the proteasome could use identical polypeptides generated from a mul-
titude of donor proteins. Forinstance, for a 6+ 3 or 3+ 6 model of trans-
spliced peptide generation, on average, around 7360 locations in the
proteome could donate any given three–amino acid segment. Thus, al-
though individual trans-spliced reactions may be rare, the high abun-
dance of “trans-donors” may make this reaction more likely (29).
It should be noted that, for the present datasets, at maximum less
than 3% of high-quality de novo sequences remained unassigned as
spliced and therefore remain uncharacterized. The evolution of post-
translational proteasomal splicing and the impact on host immunity
have yet to be fully determined. Thus, despite a number of initial reports
of immunogenicity (5–7), the true physiological relevance of such prev-
alent peptides has yet to be comprehensively demonstrated. A high fre-
quency of spliced peptides can increase the diversity of target antigens
for T cell recognition (Fig. 5). For instance, it may be that, for antigens
that are highly susceptible to proteasomal degradation (where most
cleavage products are too short to generate HLA-I ligands), the ligation
of short oligopeptides may allow immunosurveillance of that antigen
through the production of cis- or trans-spliced peptides. In the context
of infectious immunity, this process may generate novel pathogen-
derivedpeptidesand enhance the breadthof the immune response. This
may be particularly important for pathogens with small genomes that
may not encode significant numbers of suitable HLA-I ligands. Presum-
ably, under this circumstance, ligation of pathogen-derived peptide
fragments with other antigens may create better targets for immunity,
thus providing an advantage to the host. In contrast, this may also reveal
an Achilles’ heel of the immune system, facilitating the generation of
cross-reactive T cells due to molecular mimicry of pathogen-derived
and self-peptides (30). We found that only 235 (less than 1%) spliced
peptides from all datasets have an exact sequence match in all proteome
sequences stored in “NCBI RefSeq Non-redundant Proteins.” There-
fore, our findings suggest that peptide splicing does not necessarily

croorganisms. However, the possibility of pathogen-derived spliced
peptides has also been reported and may contribute to equal propor-
tions of the pathogen-derived immunopeptidome as those determined
for self-derived peptides. Thus, the full repertoire of potential mimics,
between both self-spliced/pathogen-linear and self-linear/pathogen-
spliced, may be greater than was considered in this analysis.
With the implementation and application of this workflow, we have
demonstrated the unanticipated abundance of trans-spliced peptides in
the HLA class I peptidome. As more examples become apparent, we
anticipate that the precise mechanism and underlying rules of peptide
ligation will be systematically delineated in cellulo, leading to the gen-
eration of models to predict spliced peptides. Although we found subtle
preferences at the junctional amino acids, no obvious splicing rules were
apparent across our datasets, possibly reflecting the broad specificity of
the various forms of proteasome potentially found in these cell lines
(constitutive and immunoproteasomes, as well as mixed complexes).
Thus, incorporating spliced peptides into the models of antigen presen-
tation will broaden our understanding of T cell immunity while having
implications in the context of immunotherapeutics, such as peptide vac-
cines, and having the potential to reinvigorate the search for auto-
immune triggers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and isolation of p-HLA complexes
Monoallelic cell lines were generated from C1R cells transfected with
HLA alleles of interest and include C1R-A*01:01, C1R-B*07:02, C1R-
B*08:01, C1R-B*15:02, C1R-B*18:01, C1R-B*27:05, C1R-B*57:01,
C1R-B*57:03, and C1R-B*58:01 (24, 31–33). These cells were grown
to high density in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum,7.5mMHepes,streptomycin(150mg/ml),benzylpenicillin(150U/ml),
2 mM L-glutamine (MP Biomedicals), 76 mM b-mercaptoethylamine,
and 150 mM nonessential amino acids. Cells were tested for my-
coplasma contamination in-house at regular intervals. Cells were har-
vested by centrifugation (1200g, 20 min, 4°C) and snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Clarified lysates were generated from cells with a combination
of cryogenic milling and detergent-based lysis. HLA-peptide complexes
were immunoaffinity-purified from cell lysates using the W6/32
monoclonal antibody in solid phase as described previously (34).
Bound complexes were eluted by acidification with 10% acetic acid
and fractionated in a 4.6-mm (internal diameter) by 100-mm (length)
monolithic reversed-phase C18 high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC) column (Chromolith SpeedROD; Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany) using an ÄKTAmicro HPLC system (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The mobile phase con-
sisted of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; Thermo Fisher Scientif-
ic) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid;
Thermo Fisher Scientific). HLA-peptide mixtures were loaded onto
the column and separated using the following chromatographic
conditions: 2 to 15% buffer B for 0.25 min (2 ml/min), 15 to 30% buffer
B for 4 min (2 ml/min), 30 to 40% buffer B for 8 min (2 ml/min), 40 to
45% buffer B for 10 min (2 ml/min), 45 to 99% buffer B for 2 min
(1 ml/min), and 99 to 100% for 2 min (1 ml/min), re-equilibrate 6 min
in 2% buffer B at 2 ml/min. Fractions (500 ml) were collected, concata-
nated into 10 to 15 pools before vacuum-concentrated to 10 ml, and
diluted in 0.1% formic acid to reduce the acetonitrile concentration.
For the other alleles, we have used the publicly available data for
monoallelic HLA-I cell lines (35).
LC–MS/MS sequencing of p-HLA–bound peptides
For LC-MS/MS acquisition, peptide-containing fractions were loaded
onto a microfluidic trap column packed with ChromXP C18-CL
3-mm particles (300-Å nominal pore size; equilibrated in 0.1% formic
acid, 2% acetonitrile) at 5 ml/min with a NanoUltra cHiPLC system
(Eksigent). An analytical (75 mm × 15 cm ChromXP C18-CL, 3 mm,
120 Å; Eksigent) microfluidic column was switched in line, and pep-
tides were separated by linear gradient elution with 0 to 30% buffer B
(80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) over 50 min and 30 to 80% over
5 min flowing at 300 nl/min. Separated peptides were analyzed with
a SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer equipped with a
Nanospray III ion source and accumulating up to 20 MS/MS spectra
per second. The following instrument parameters were used: ion
spray voltage, 2400 V; curtain gas, 25 l/min; ion source gas, 10 l/min;
and interface heater temperature, 150°C. MS/MS switch criteria in-
cluded the following: ions of mass/charge ratio >200 amu; charge
state, +2 to +5; and intensity, >40 counts per second. The top 20 ions
meeting these criteria were selected for MS/MS per cycle. We cali-
brated the instrument every four LC runs using [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide
B standard.
De novo sequencing algorithm evaluation
The accuracy of PEAKS Studio 8.5 de novo sequencing algorithm has
been previously described (36). Nevertheless, we sought to evaluate the
accuracy of this de novo algorithm in the context of p-HLA peptides.
Therefore, we mixed 289synthetic nontryptic peptides with lengthstyp-
ical of p-HLA and analyzed them under identical conditions by LC-MS/
MS (as mentioned above). We then used PEAKS de novo [the parent
mass error tolerance was set to 15 parts per million (ppm) and the frag-
ment mass error tolerance to 0.1 Da] and allowed the algorithm to gen-
erate the top 10 candidates for each spectrum. Of the total 289 peptides,
220 peptides were identified by PEAKS de novo sequencing alone (fig.
S3A). By using PEAKS DB (“database”; 1% FDR cutoff), we identified
239 peptides. Six peptides were identified by PEAKS de novo that were
not identified at 1% FDR by the library search, whereas 25 peptides were
identified by PEAKS DB that were not identified by PEAKS de novo. In
total, 89.5% of peptides that were identified by the library search could
also be identified by de novo sequencing. We also found that more than
99.5% of peptides that were identified by PEAKS de novo derived from
the top five sequence candidates of the spectra (fig. S3B). The median of
average local confidence (ALC) score for peptides identified by PEAKS
de novo was 85 ± 13.5.
Peptide identification
Step 1: LC-MS/MS data were searched against the human proteome
[UniProt v_05102017 with additional possible contaminations such
as all UniProt entries for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus used to
immortalize C1R cells and the bovine serum proteome] by PEAKS Stu-
dio 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions; fig. S2A). MS data files were imported
into PEAKS Studio 8.5 (PEAKS de novo, PEAKS DB) and subjected to
default data refinement. The parent mass error tolerance was set to 10
and 15 ppm and the fragment mass error tolerance to 0.02 or 0.1 Da for
data generated by Thermo or SCIEX instruments, respectively (based
on the software’s default settings). Oxidation of methionine and de-
amidation of asparagine or glutamine were set in the de novo and
database peptide searches as variable PTMs. A 1% FDR cutoff was ap-
plied, and all peptides identified by PEAKS DB were defined as lin-
ear peptides. For spectra that were just identified by PEAKS de novo
(denovo–onlypeptides),thetopfivecandidates(see “Denovosequencing

 algorithm evaluation” section) were extracted. Although we found that
85% of correct sequences appear as the first candidate (fig. S2B), we
extracted multiple high-confidencecandidates instead ofjust the high-
est hit per spectrum. Hence, by this logic, we reduced possible false-
positive spliced peptide matching due to isobaricPTMand substitution
errors. For finding the ALC cutoff for de novo candidates in each dataset,
the ALC of spectra for identified linear peptides (at 1% FDR) was
exported, and their corresponding median and SD were calculated.
For retaining high-confidence de novo candidates for each spectrum,
a mathematical model was generated by using Eq. 1
ALC cutoff for de novo candidates ¼ median ALCðlinear peptides
at 1% FDRÞ‐SDðlinear peptides at 1% FDRÞ
ð1Þ
For instance, for the HLA-B*57:01 dataset, the median and SD of
ALC score for linear peptides were 91 and 12, respectively. Therefore,
the ALC cutoff for this dataset was 79, and all candidates with ALC less
than 79 were not included in the next steps. All de novo candidates
that did not pass the ALC cutoff in their corresponding dataset were
removed.
Step 2: An in-house algorithm (“Hybrid finder”) was designed and
set to execute the workflow indicated in fig. S3B. This software was
designed and implemented using the JAVA programming language.
De novo candidates that passed the ALC cutoff were analyzed by this
hybrid finder algorithm. Given that it is not possible to distinguish be-
tween leucine (Leu) and isoleucine (Ile) residues by their mass (37), in
the context of de novo sequencing, each Ile and Leu was converted to
“L” in the proteome library (38). This conversion prevents false assign-
ment of linear peptides as spliced peptides by considering all permuta-
tions and combinations of Ile and Leu in the reference proteome. The
steps of the algorithm were as follows: The algorithm first searches to
find any match for the sequence in the proteome database. If this step
fails to find a match, then the algorithm splits the peptide into all pos-
sible two segment pairs. The algorithm then searches each segment pair
against the same library as used above. By analyzing the protein headers
gathered from the search of the two segments, the program then lists
proteins for potential cis-spliced and then trans-spliced peptides. There
can be many possible source proteins for each segment (the algorithm
identifies all possibilities), but because of limitations in space for the
output, just one of the possibilities is listed in the attached tables (table
S4). If a sequence is not included in any of the above peptide categories
(linear, cis-, or trans-spliced), then the algorithm assigns it as having no
current biological explanation.
Step 3: De novo candidates from the same spectrum were grouped
as candidates. In this step, we retrieved the ALC score for each candi-
date from the first de novo sequencing (in step 1) and the assigned
linear or splicing type from the hybrid finder output (step 2). Then,
we reranked the candidates in each spectrum group based on two dif-
ferent criteria. The first criterion was biological possibility, with our
rationale being that a linear peptide explanation was deemed more
likely than a cis-spliced peptide, which in turn was deemed more likely
than a trans-spliced peptide. After this step, if multiple peptide se-
quences (of the same biological explanation) within a spectrum group
were tied for first place, then such peptides were reranked on the basis
of their de novo sequencing ALC score. For instance, if there were two
cis-spliced candidates (and thus no linear candidates) tied for the first
place in a group, then the one with the higher ALC would claim the
first place.
Then, the first ranked candidate was kept from each candidate
group, and all other candidates were removed. In the next step, only
the candidates with a splicing (cis or trans) explanation were kept,
and any linear and no biological explanation (NBE) candidates were
removed. Subsequently, by using an in-house algorithm, all such spliced
candidates were merged into a FASTA format, with sequences conca-
tenated into representative pseudoprotein lengths (i.e., to mimic typical
protein entries and thus to not bias protein scoring), and these collective
sequences were appended to the original UniProt database. The result-
antmergedproteome database wasusedforthesecondandfinalPEAKS
DB search, with the identical search parameters as the first PEAKS DB
search. Peptides that were identified at 1% FDR that matched to our
spliced candidate list were counted as spliced peptides (table S4).
