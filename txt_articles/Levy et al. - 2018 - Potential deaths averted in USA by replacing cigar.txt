Introduction US tobacco control policies to reduce 
cigarette use have been effective, but their impact has 
been relatively slow. This study considers a strategy of 
switching cigarette smokers to e-cigarette use (’vaping’) 
in the USA to accelerate tobacco control progress.
Methods A Status Quo Scenario, developed to project 
smoking rates and health outcomes in the absence of 
vaping, is compared with Substitution models, whereby 
cigarette use is largely replaced by vaping over a 10-year 
period. We test an Optimistic and a Pessimistic Scenario, 
differing in terms of the relative harms of e-cigarettes 
compared with cigarettes and the impact on overall 
initiation, cessation and switching. Projected mortality 
outcomes by age and sex under the Status Quo and 
E-Cigarette Substitution Scenarios are compared from 
2016 to 2100 to determine public health impacts.
Findings Compared with the Status Quo, replacement 
of cigarette by e-cigarette use over a 10-year period 
yields 6.6 million fewer premature deaths with 
86.7 million fewer life years lost in the Optimistic 
Scenario. Under the Pessimistic Scenario, 1.6 million 
premature deaths are averted with 20.8 million fewer life 
years lost. The largest gains are among younger cohorts, 
with a 0.5 gain in average life expectancy projected for 
the age 15 years cohort in 2016.
Conclusions The tobacco control community has been 
divided regarding the role of e-cigarettes in tobacco 
control. Our projections show that a strategy of replacing 
cigarette smoking with vaping would yield substantial 
life year gains, even under pessimistic assumptions 
regarding cessation, initiation and relative harm.
InTRoduCTIon
Harms from cigarette smoking remain unacceptably 
high even though smoking prevalence in the USA has 
decreased markedly over the past 50 years.1 2 T
wo of 
three long-term smokers will likely die prematurely 
of a smoking-attributable disease.3–5 Although 
many tobacco control policies, such as higher 
cigarette taxes, smoke-free public places, media 
campaigns, cessation treatment programmes and 
advertising restrictions, have already been imple-
mented with substantial effectiveness, their pace in 
averting preventable deaths has been relatively slow 
and their potential to secure quick and substantial 
new smoking declines is limited.6 7 Accordingly, 
tobacco control experts and national governments 
have begun considering what might be done to 
accelerate declines in tobacco-caused health harms 
and eventually eliminate all tobacco consumption 
(often termed an ‘endgame’). The 2014 US Surgeon 
General Report recommended an endgame strategy 
for the tobacco epidemic.6 Finland, New Zealand, 
Hong Kong and Ireland have already set the goal of 
reaching an endgame.8 
While some refer to an endgame for all tobacco, 
most appear to focus on cigarettes as a more real-
istic and most important target, since they cause 
the vast majority of harm.7 9–16 However, a credible 
plan to minimise cigarette use has yet to be imple-
mented. At the same time, emerging nicotine-de-
livery products, such as e-cigarettes, call for an 
updating of traditional tobacco control strategies to 
better address new opportunities and threats that 
they present.17
Rather than focusing on policies designed exclu-
sively to reduce cigarette use, some public health 
experts suggest a complementary approach to 
encourage the use of less harmful nicotine delivery 
products, such as e-cigarettes, as a substitute for 
cigarettes.6 9 18–21 Some public health experts and 
officials fear that e-cigarette use ('vaping’) may 
increase overall tobacco-related harms by serving 
as a gateway to smoking or prompting smokers to 
vape or engage in dual use instead of quitting all 
use.22–25 However, evidence is mounting that e-cig-
arettes deliver only a small percentage of the toxi-
cants delivered by cigarettes.26–32 In addition, newer 
e-cigarettes models have been shown to more effi-
ciently deliver nicotine29 30 33 than older models and 
provide sensorimotor experiences and ‘throat-hit’ 
similar to smoking,34 thus increasing their potential 
to serve as effective substitutes for cigarettes.
The goal of this paper is to show the potential 
health impact from an endgame strategy directed 
at replacing all or most cigarette smoking by e-cig-
arette use over a 10-year period. The 10-year time 
frame is used for illustrative purposes to show 
the potential health gains that could be secured 
by a potent switching-based strategy. To address 
the major concerns about switching smokers to 
e-cigarettes, some of the projections assume a 
much smaller net reduction in health harms from 
switching to e-cigarette from cigarette use than 
existing research suggests, and that the switching 
strategy will increase initiation into regular vaping 
by youth and others who would not otherwise use 
any nicotine delivery products and will prompt 
some smokers who would otherwise have quit 
all tobacco and nicotine use to instead use e-cig-
arettes. To distinguish the effect of policies on 
younger and older cohorts, we present separate 
analyses for the cohorts age 15 years and age 35 
years in 2016.

MeThods
The analysis begins with a Status Quo Scenario for smoking rates 
and health outcomes. E-cigarette Substitution models are then 
developed in which cigarette use is replaced by vaping. Projected 
mortality and life years lost (LYL) under the Status Quo and 
E-cigarette Substitution models are compared to determine the 
public health impact.
To reflect the population of smokers alive today in USA, we 
confine the analysis to the population age 15 years through age 
99 years in 2016. Projections are applied through the year 2100 
to incorporate the potential health effects of those at younger 
ages. The model was built in Excel for transparency and to facil-
itate use by interested parties. The model equations, an explicit 
statement of the assumptions, and further details, are provided 
in supplement 1 technical appendix.
status Quo scenario
The Status Quo Scenario focuses on cigarette use and is initialised 
in 2016 with the population classified as never, current and 
former cigarette smokers. Due to data limitations and to simplify 
the analysis, the Status Quo Scenario only considers cigarettes, 
and does not include smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes or cigars.
Future cigarette use
Smoking rates are projected forward using age-specific and 
sex-specific initiation and cessation rates, and age-specific, 
sex-specific and smoking status-specific mortality rates. Holford 
et al1 35 developed the initiation and cessation rates by applying an 
age-period-cohort statistical model to data from the 1965–2012 
National Health Interview Surveys while correcting for bias due 
to higher mortality among current and former smokers. They 
were validated by comparing the smoking prevalence projections 
based on these initiation and cessation rates over the period 1965 
through 2010 against observed rates.34 Age-specific, sex-specific 
and cohort-specific initiation and cessation rates were used to 
project forward current, former and never smoker rates from 
their initial 2016 levels. To distinguish between successful cessa-
tion and short-term cessation followed by relapse, cessation is 
measured as having quit smoking for at least 2 
years. All-cause 
cohort life tables subclassified by smoking status (never, former 
and current) were developed for the 1864–1980 birth cohorts,36 
and projected forward35 37 using data on smoking prevalence and 
relative risks by age, sex and smoking status derived from the 
first two American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Studies 
and the smoking prevalence data described above.
Mortality outcomes
Under the Status Quo, the number of smoking-attributable 
deaths for current smokers is calculated by age, sex and year as 
the product of their excess mortality risks (ie, current smoker 
mortality rate minus never smoker mortality rate) multiplied by 
the number of smokers. A parallel process is used to derive esti-
mates for former smokers. The numbers of smoking-attributable 
deaths for current and former smokers are combined and then 
multiplied by the expected years of life remaining of a never 
smoker in their age group to estimate LYL from smoking.
e-cigarette substitution scenarios
Starting with the same proportions of smokers, former smokers 
and never smokers as in the Status Quo Scenario, the two E-ciga-
rette Substitution Scenarios were constructed to show the impact 
of substituting e-cigarette use for cigarette smoking. The Opti-
mistic Scenario is based primarily on current use patterns in 
e-cigarettes and published evaluations of harm reduction, while 
the Pessimistic Scenario is intended to reflect the ‘worst case’ 
of suggested harms (eg, with e-cigarettes more harmful than 
the science indicates), and the switching strategy substantially 
increasing vaping beyond those who would have smoked in the 
Status Quo Scenario.
Future cigarette and e-cigarette use
We assume that the prevalence of cigarette use will be reduced 
to a 5% residual prevalence of cigarette use in the Optimistic 
Scenario and to 10% in the Pessimistic Scenario. This residual 
of cigarette smokers would reflect those unwilling or unable 
to quit cigarettes as well as those who initiate e-cigarette use 
and progress to smoking. The substitution of e-cigarette for 
cigarette use under the Optimistic Scenario is modelled as a 
10% reduction in the difference between the 2016 smoking 
prevalence and the 5% residual at each age to each cohort 
each year over 10 years starting in 2017, that is, replacing 
10% of cigarette by e-cigarette users over 10 years, so that a 
residual of 5% cigarette smoking prevalence remains in 2026. 
In the Pessimistic Scenario, the corresponding annual reduc-
tion is calculated to instead yield a 10% prevalence of ciga-
rette use after 10 years.
Those who replace cigarettes with e-cigarette use before age 
40 years are treated as never smokers using e-cigarettes, since 
their risks as former smokers will be close to that of never 
smokers.38 Those who replace cigarette with e-cigarette use after 
age 40 years are treated as former smokers using e-cigarettes.
In the Status Quo Scenario, most never smokers initiate ciga-
rette smoking by age 24 years. Under the Optimistic Scenario, 
never smokers who would have smoked cigarettes instead 
become e-cigarette users at the same rates as initiation of ciga-
rette use in the Status Quo Scenario after the 5% smoking 
prevalence is reached, reflecting the small percentage of never 
smokers who have been found to use e-cigarettes.39–41 Under the 
Pessimistic Scenario, e-cigarette initiation is assumed to occur at 
150% of the Status Quo smoking initiation rate to reflect some 
renormalisation of nicotine use.22–25
The Optimistic and Pessimistic Scenarios are also distin-
guished by the rate of cessation from e-cigarettes. Like cigarette 
smokers, e-cigarette users may quit e-cigarette use for health or 
other reasons. Indeed, some studies have found e-cigarettes vary 
substantially in nicotine delivery and can have lower nicotine 
addiction liability than when the nicotine is delivered via inhaled 
smoke from the combustion of tobacco smoking.33 42–45 Under 
the Optimistic Scenario, e-cigarette users each year quit at the 
same age-specific and sex-specific cessation rate as smokers in 
the Status Quo Scenario. Under the Pessimistic Scenario, e-ciga-
rette users each year quit at half the rate of cigarette smokers in 
the Status Quo Scenario.
The final distinction between the Optimistic and Pessi-
mistic Scenarios is the expected risk of e-cigarette use, which 
is measured here relative to the excess risk of cigarettes. 
Although the health risks have yet to be thoroughly charac-
terised, e-cigarettes appear to have much lower levels of toxi-
cants than cigarettes26–29 32 Under the Optimistic Scenario, an 
excess risk of e-cigarette use at 5% of cigarette excess risk is 
applied to current e-cigarette users, reflecting estimates from 
published reports.27 46 We assume that the risk to former 
smokers from using e-cigarettes is proportional to the differ-
ence in risks between current and former smokers. Applying 
the 5% excess risk of exclusive e-cigarette use to former 
smokers using e-cigarettes, their excess risk is estimated as

that of former smokers plus (5% x (current smoker mortality 
rate − former smoker mortality rate)). Although worst case 
estimates of excess risks have not been published, we apply 
an excess risk of 40% for e-cigarette use under the Pessimistic 
Scenario, as suggested by some critics of vaping.47 48 Parallel 
to the Optimistic Scenario, the 40% risk is then also scaled by 
the difference in risks between current and former smokers.
Health outcomes
For the Optimistic and Pessimistic E-Cigarette Substitution 
Scenarios, total premature deaths and LYL are calculated for 
e-cigarette users that never smoked, e-cigarette users among 
former smokers, former e-cigarette users, and current and 
former smokers who have not yet switched to e-cigarette use. At 
each age, excess risks are multiplied by the number of individ-
uals in each of these categories and summed to obtain premature 
deaths and multiplied by expected life years remaining of a never 
smoker to obtain LYL.
Public health impact of replacing cigarette use by 
e-cigarettes
For the Optimistic and Pessimistic Scenarios, the public health 
impact is estimated by subtracting total premature deaths in 
each of these Scenarios from those in the Status Quo Scenario, 
and similarly for LYL. The public health impact is first deter-
mined for each cohort by summing overall remaining ages, and 
then summed over cohorts to determine the overall impact. By 
dividing the change in LYL by the 2016 population, we obtain 
a measure of the impact of the E-cigarette Substitution Scenario 
on life expectancy.
ResulTs
Table 1 contains the premature deaths and LYL by age predicted 
under the Status Quo and the two E-cigarette Substitution 
Scenarios. Supplement 2 contains additional results by sex and 
for different levels of e-cigarette risk.
status Quo scenario
Under the Status Quo Scenario, smoking prevalence (age 
15–99 years) in 2016 is 19.3% for men and 14.1% for women, 
and declines over time for cohorts above age 24 years in 2016. 
A cumulative total of 26.1 
million (18.8 
million male; 7.3 
million 
female) premature deaths and 248.6 
million (177.9 
million male; 
70.8 
million female) LYL are projected.
e-Cigarette substitution scenarios
Under the Optimistic Scenario, a cumulative total of 19.5 
million 
(14.0 
million male; 5.5 
million female) premature deaths and 
161.9 
million (115.0 
million male; 46.9 
million female) LYL are 
projected. Compared with the Status Quo Scenario, a net gain of 
6.6 
million (4.8 
million male; 1.7 
million female) fewer prema-
ture deaths and 86.7 
million (62.9 
million male; 23.9 
million 
female) fewer LYL are projected, representing 25% fewer prema-
ture deaths and 35% fewer LYL. The reduction in LYL translates 
to an increased average life expectancy of 0.33 (0.49 male; 0.18 
female) years for the 2012 age 15 years and above population.
Under the Pessimistic Scenario, the e-cigarette prevalence is 
slightly larger in the early years (due to the 10% rather than 5% 
residual smoking prevalence), but does not decline as rapidly over 
time as in the Optimistic Scenario. With a 10% residual preva-
lence, the models allows no switching to e-cigarette use after 
age 61 years for men and after age 54 years for women, since 
smoking rates are 10% at those ages in 2016. Health outcomes 
are worse than the Optimistic Scenario with a cumulative total 
of 24.4 
million (17.4 
million male; 7.0 
million female) prema-
ture deaths and 227.8 
million (160.0 
million male; 67.8 
million 
female) LYL. Compared with the Status Quo Scenario, a net gain 
of 1.6 
million (1.4 
million male; 0.3 
million female) representing 
6% fewer premature deaths and 20.8 
million (17.8 
million male; 
3.0 
million female) representing 8% fewer LYL are projected. 
Average life expectancy increases 0.08 years (0.14 male; 0.02 
female).
The 2001 birth cohort
As shown in table 2, male smoking prevalence under the Status 
Quo Scenario for the 2001 birth cohort (age 15 years in 2016) 
is 4.5% at age 15 years, increasing to 21.7% at age 25 years, and 
decreasing to 10.6% at age 55 years. Female smoking prevalence is 
substantially lower beginning at 2.4%, increasing to 15.2% at age 
25 years and falling to 8.3% at age 55 years. A cumulative total

82% fewer premature deaths and 79% fewer LYL. Life expectancy 
increases by 0.5 years (0.8 male; 0.3 female), largely reflecting 
the 2.9 years (3.7 male; 1.7 female) increase in life expectancy of 
otherwise smokers. Compared with the Status Quo Scenario, 16% 
fewer premature deaths and 10% fewer LYL are projected under 
the Pessimistic Scenario.
The 1981 birth cohort
As shown in table 3, male (female) smoking prevalence under the 
Status Quo Scenario for the 1981 birth cohort (age 35 years in 
2016) begins at 28.4% (21.0%), decreasing to 21.4% (16.3%) at 
age 45 years and 5.5% (3.7%) at age 75 years. Compared with 
the Status Quo Scenario, the projected net public health gain 
with the Optimistic Scenario is 160.5 thousand (119.9 thousand 
male; 40.5 thousand female) or 43% fewer premature deaths 
and 2.2 
million (1.7 
million male; 559.8 thousand female) or 
52% fewer LYL. For the Pessimistic Scenario, 13% fewer prema-
ture deaths and 17% fewer LYL are projected.
dIsCussIon
Our analysis shows that a hypothetical substitution of e-ciga-
rette for cigarette use provides tremendous potential to avert 
premature deaths due to smoking, with only a relatively small 
amount of premature deaths due to e-cigarettes. Among those 
aged 15 years and above in 2016, almost 6.6 million fewer 
premature deaths and 86.7 
million fewer LYL due to cigarette 
use occur in the Optimistic Scenario. The average 15-year-old 
would increase their life expectancy by 0.5 years, reflecting the 
increased life span of those who have, or would otherwise have 
smoked cigarettes, switching to e-cigarettes. Our results also 
show that although there would still be considerable premature 
deaths and LYL in all scenarios (table 1), these are primarily due 
to the impact of smoking among those aged 35 years and older 
in 2016 (tables 2 and 3). This estimate corresponds, in our view, 
to reasonable estimates of initiation, cessation and e-cigarette 
risk known to date.19 49
Even in the Pessimistic Scenario, where we allow for long-
term ongoing renormalisation of tobacco use in terms of e-ciga-
rette initiation, reduced cessation, far smaller reductions in harm 
from e-cigarettes than existing science indicates, and a residual 
prevalence of 10%, there are still overall net gains in averted 
premature deaths and LYL. Accordingly, this study suggests 
that, even under a worst case scenario, an endgame strategy 
that successfully prompted most cigarette smokers to switch to 
vaping would secure substantial public health gains.
In addition to the reductions in mortality, further health bene-
fits would accrue from reduced disability, tobacco-related disease 
incidence and exposure to secondhand smoke. The reduced 
disability and disease burden would also translate directly into 
lower medical costs associated with cancer, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease and heart disease, reduced productivity 
losses due to death and disease primarily among those of ages 
40 years through 64 years , and improved quality of life.6 These 
gains can be expected to reduce health disparities, since smoking 
rates are highest among those with lower income and education.6 
In addition, secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol has been 
found to be less extensive and less harmful than exposure to 
cigarette smoke,50 51 thus reducing mortality and morbidity in 
non-smokers.
Unlike previous models of e-cigarette use,49 52–54 our model 
was not developed to predict future e-cigarette and cigarette use 
based on past trends. Rather the aim was to examine a hypo-
thetical endgame strategy of reducing cigarette use through 
switching to e-cigarettes. As with any hypothetical modelling 
exercise, a number of limitations are worth noting.
The Status Quo Scenario is developed based on past smoking 
uptake and cessation rates through the years 2012, prior to the 
major growth in e-cigarette use.55 56 The projections do not 
incorporate tobacco control policy changes and the effect of 
increases in e-cigarette use that have occurred after 2012. To the 
extent that e-cigarette use and tobacco control policies imple-
mented since 2012 would have already reduced cigarette use, 
our estimates of the gains under the Optimistic and Pessimistic 
Scenarios would be reduced.
Our models were limited to cigarette and e-cigarette use, and 
do not incorporate the use of other nicotine delivery products, 
including smokeless tobacco, water pipes and cigars. While use 
of these other products are relatively minor contributors to 
overall tobacco-related harms, policies should be directed at 
all combustible tobacco to reduce the likelihood of substituting 
other harmful smoked products, such as little cigars.57 Taking 
into account the substitution of e-cigarettes for these other prod-
ucts would further increase the estimated public health gains 
from an e-cigarette substitution strategy.
The choice of a 10% residual rate of smokers in the Pessimistic 
Scenario and a 5% residual in the Optimistic Scenario were 
included to allow for the possibility that some current cigarette 
smokers would be unlikely to quit. The residual prevalence of 
cigarette smokers will depend on the potency of policies directed 
at cigarette use. Traditional cigarette-oriented policies, including 
significant cigarette tax increases,10 58–60 large and graphic picto-
rial warnings on cigarette packages,61 and retail point-of-sale 
restrictions on advertising displays,62 have each been projected 
to reduce smoking prevalence by at least 10% in relative terms. A 
previous study estimated that strong policies (including a $2.00 
tax increase) would reduce cigarette use by 40%. A nicotine 
reduction policy may substantially reduce cigarette use if prop-
erly enforced,16 63 64 especially when accompanied by a more 
permissive approach to e-cigarettes.65 In addition, a menthol 
cigarette ban may encourage cessation and discourage youth and 
young adults from cigarette use.66 Synergies may enhance the 
effect of these policies.
Substitution from cigarettes to e-cigarettes will also depend 
on the policies directed at e-cigarette use. Information dissem-
ination policies that provide the best available information 
on the relative risks of e-cigarettes are likely to encourage 
switching to e-cigarette use. In addition, just as innovations have 
improved both the appeal and delivery of nicotine in a satis-
fying manner,29 30 33 innovations are likely to improve the substi-
tutability of e-cigarettes for cigarettes, unless there are major 
regulatory hurdles for introducing new products. Once smokers 
were switched to vaping and any significant new re-emergence 
of smoking were discouraged, the same tools that have success-
fully been employed in reducing cigarette use, such as increasing 
e-cigarette taxes,67 raising and enforcing the minimum purchase 
age,37 and restricting marketing directed at youth, could be 
applied to e-cigarette use if vaping were found to be more 
harmful than current evidence suggests or if e-cigarette use was 
at unacceptably high levels through normalisation of vaping.

*Life years gained=life years lost in Status Quo Scenario − life years lost in E-cigarette Substitution Scenario.
†Smoking rates evolve from initial 2016 levels based on age, gender and cohort-specific smoking initiation and cessation rates in the absence of e-cigarette use.
‡Optimistic Scenario: e-cigarettes excess risk 5% of smoking, 5% of the population continues to initiate cigarette smoking or remain as smokers, the remainder of never smokers 
then initiate e-cigarette use at the rate of cigarette smoking initiation in the Status Quo Scenario, and both smokers and e-cigarette users quit at the rate of smokers in the 
Status Quo Scenario.
§Pessimistic Scenario: e-cigarettes excess risk 40% of smoking, 10% of the population continues to initiate cigarette smoking or remain as smokers, the remainder of never 
smokers then initiate e-cigarette use at the 150% rate of cigarette smoking initiation in the Status Quo Scenario, and e-cigarette users quit at 50% of the rate of smokers in the 
Status Quo Scenario and smokers quit at the Status Quo cessation rate.

Research paper
Another limitation is that we treated e-cigarettes as a homo-
geneous category in terms of risks. In fact, products vary in 
terms of their toxicant content,28 price68 and desirability.69 We 
do not yet have evidence of the actual long-term health effects 
of e-cigarette use. However, applying sensitivity analysis to the 
Pessimistic Scenario, we found that substitution from cigarettes 
to e-cigarettes yielded public health gains with excess risks of 
e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes as high as 71% for men and 
55% for women. Regardless, prudent product standards to limit 
known toxicants as much as practical would reduce the range of 
harm for different types and brands of e-cigarettes, and is likely 
to increase perceptions by smokers of reduced harm of e-cig-
arettes relative to cigarettes. If the relative risk of e-cigarettes 
were to be reduced to 3% and the residual prevalence to 2.5%, 
the relative reduction in LYL would increase from 35% to 44%. 
Furthermore, heat-not-burn tobacco products have been intro-
duced in some countries, and these may be a better substitute 
for cigarettes than e-cigarettes, but have higher toxicant levels. 
While they may impose greater health risks, they are still likely 
well within the estimates used in our Pessimistic Scenario.
In conclusion, tobacco industry documents70 reveal an industry 
strategy of ‘divide and conquer’ focused primarily on fostering 
divisions within the tobacco control community regarding modi-
fied risk products. Indeed, the tobacco control community has 
had divided approaches to e-cigarettes, and in the process may 
have lost focus on cigarettes, the most deadly form of nicotine 
delivery. Our analysis shows that a strategy of replacing cigarette 
by e-cigarette use can yield substantial gains, even with conser-
vative assumptions about related risks. Most important, an e-cig-
arette substitution strategy provides the justification to redouble 
efforts to target cigarette use, as called for by the WHO Frame-
work Convention for Tobacco Control.71 An endgame scenario 
for cigarettes might well be within reach, if new technologies 
for delivering nicotine with substantially less harm, but sufficient 
satisfaction, are harnessed with sufficient passion and political 
will to aggressively phase out tobacco cigarettes.
What this paper adds
 
► The 2014 US Surgeon General’s Report suggested the need 
for a new strategy to more quickly end tobacco use, but a 
credible strategy has not been provided. This paper considers 
a strategy of switching cigarettes smokers to e-cigarette use 
in USA to accelerate tobacco control progress.
 
► Using a previously validated simulation model, our 
projections show that a strategy of replacing cigarette 
smoking with e-cigarette use would yield substantial life 
year gains, even under pessimistic assumptions regarding 
cessation, initiation and relative harm.
