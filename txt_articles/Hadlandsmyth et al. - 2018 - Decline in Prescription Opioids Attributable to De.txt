BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of temporal
trends in short- and long-term opioid prescribing may
inform efforts to curb the opioid epidemic.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of short- and
long-term opioid prescribing in the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration (VHA) from 2010 to 2016.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study using VHA
databases.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients receiving at least one outpa-
tient prescription through the VHA during calendar years
2010 through 2016.
MAIN MEASURES: Prevalence of opioid use from 2010
through 2016, stratified by short-term, intermediate-
term, and long-term use. Temporal trends in discontinu-
ation among existing long-term users and initiation of
new long-term use and the net impact on rates of long-
term opioid use. Relative likelihood of transitioning to
long-term opioid use contrasted with use patterns in the
prior year.
KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of opioid prescribing was
20.8% in 2010, peaked at 21.2% in 2012, and declined
annually to 16.1% in 2016. Between 2010 and 2016,
reductions in long-term opioid prescribing accounted for
83% of the overall decline in opioid prescription fills. Com-
paring data from 2010–2011 to data from 2015–2016,
declining rates in new long-term use accounted for more
than 90% of the decreasing prevalence of long-term opioid
use in the VHA, whereas increases in cessation among
existing long-term users accounted for less than 10%. The
relative risk of transitioning to long-term use during 2016
was 6.5 (95% CI: 6.4, 6.7) among short-term users and
35.5 (95% CI: 34.8, 36.3) among intermediate users, rel-
ative to patients with no opioid prescriptions filled during
2015.
CONCLUSIONS: Opioid prescribing trends followed simi-
lar trajectories in VHA and non-VHA settings, peaking
around 2012 and subsequently declining. However,
changes in long-term opioid prescribing accounted for
most of the decline in the VHA. Recent VA opioid initiatives
may be preventing patients from initiating long-term use.
This may offer valuable lessons generalizable to other
healthcare systems.

INTRODUCTION
Rapid and widespread escalation in long-term opioid prescrib-
ing over recent decades have revealed a spectrum of harms
including opioid use disorder, transition to heroin use, bowel
dysfunction, endocrine dysfunction, excess sedation, vehicu-
lar accidents, respiratory depression, and fatal overdoses.1–7
Growing awareness has led prescribers, policymakers, and the
lay community to enact numerous efforts to Bturn the tide^ on
the opioid epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring
programs, 1,2 hydrocodone rescheduling,3 state-based limits
on prescribing,4 the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) guidelines on opioids in chronic pain man-
agement,5 the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,6
and an array of local awareness campaigns.
A recent study using data from nearly 90% of US pharmacies
reported a key reversal in per capita opioid prescribing, shifting
to a downward trend in 2012.7 Despite this encouraging en-
dorsement of efforts to curtail use and availability, opioid
prescribing remained approximately three times as high in
2015 as in 1999. Moreover, decreases were limited to opioid
prescriptions of <30 days’ supply, whereas prescriptions for
≥30 days’ supply continued increasing through 2015. In com-
posite, the average days’ supply per prescription rose from 13.3
in 2006 to 17.7 in 2015. These patterns suggest that recent
decreases in opioid prescribing were attributable to decreases in
incident prescribing, largely driven by treatment of acute pain.
In contrast, expansion in prescriptions of ≥30 days’ supply
suggests that long-term opioid use, likely for chronic pain,
has persisted and perhaps even increased in recent years.7
Secular trends in opioid prescribing have also impacted the
Veteran Health Administration (VHA), the largest nationally
integrated health system in the US. From 2004 to 2012, the
prevalence of opioid prescribing nearly doubled.8 Since this
time, VHA has employed several strategies to combat the

 opioid epidemic, including deployment of educational ini-
tiatives, improving pain management programs, creating
risk mitigation systems to enhance opioid safety, and
expanding access to addiction treatment.9 Mirroring chang-
es in the private sector, escalating opioid prevalence in the
VHA slowed and reversed toward a downward trend over
the period from 2012 to 2014.9 However, VHA prescribing
trends have not been explicitly segregated into trends in
short-term versus long-term use. This distinction is critical
in understanding the impact of VHA’s strategy to combat
the opioid epidemic.
Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to
characterize the overall prevalence of opioid prescribing
in the VHA from 2010 through 2016, stratified according
to duration of use categories: short-term, intermediate-term,
and long-term. In addition to prevalence, opioid prescribing
trends were expressed in terms of number of prescription
fills and days’ supply dispensed. These alternative metrics
provided complementary data concerning patterns of opioid
prescribing and allowed examination of trends in days’
supply per prescription for comparison to prior evaluation
in the non-VHA setting.7 Given the key role of long-term
opioid use, we further examined changes within this patient
group, specifically charting the number of patients entering
as new long-term users and exiting through cessation of
long-term use, and how these prescribing patterns changed
over time. Finally, we contrasted no use, short-term use, and
intermediate-term opioid use groups and their relative like-
lihood of transitioning to long-term use in the subsequent
year, as well as changes in the likelihood of transitioning to
long-term use over time.
METHODS
Data Sources and Patients
National administrative data from the VA Corporate Data
Warehouse were accessed using the VA Informatics and Com-
puting Infrastructure. Prescriptions dispensed during calendar
years 2010 through 2016 were identified using outpatient
pharmacy data sets. Annual cohorts of VHA pharmacy users
were constructed and defined by the presence of at least one
outpatient prescription dispensed during that calendar year.
This study was approved by the University of Iowa Institu-
tional Review Board and the Iowa City Veterans Administra-
tion Research and Development Committee.
Opioid Prescribing Measures
Opioid medications considered were non-injectable dosage
forms of butorphanol, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone,
levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone,
oxymorphone, pentazocine, and tapentadol dispensed as out-
patient prescriptions. The prevalence of opioid use for each year
was determined by the number of patients dispensed at least
one opioid prescription divided by the number of pharmacy
users in that year. Additional measures of opioid prescribing
included total opioid prescriptions dispensed, supply days dis-
pensed, milligrams of morphine equivalents dispensed,10 and
mean supply days per fill. Estimated daily doses were calculat-
ed for each prescription based on unit strength, quantity, and
days’ supply values, and were used to assess a time-weighted
mean daily dose for each patient over the course of a calendar
year, expressed in milligrams of morphine equivalents per day.
Duration of opioid use was defined at the patient level and
determined for each calendar year as one of four categories: no
use, short-term (acute) use, intermediate use, or long-term
(chronic) use. Patients with no opioid prescriptions filled
during the calendar year were classified as no use. Patients
with either a single opioid prescription or two prescriptions
separated by more than 90 days were classified as short-term
use. This second criterion was used to allow patients to have
up to two discrete episodes of opioid therapy during a given
year without being placed into a category of higher opioid use.
Long-term use was defined as a period of >90 days of contin-
uous opioid use within the calendar year, as established by the
cabinet supply approach.11 Patients with any other pattern of
opioid use were classified as intermediate use. The mean
supply days dispensed during 2016 were 15.0, 58.8, and
305.8 days for short-term, intermediate, and long-term opioid
use groups, respectively.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to quantify trends in opioid
prescribing metrics over time in aggregate and separately for
short-term, intermediate, and long-term use categories. Given
the importance of long-term opioid use, we further examined
changes within this patient group by charting the number of
patients entering as new long-term users and exiting through
cessation of long-term use. We specifically examined these
transitions in long-term opioid use from 2010 to 2011 and
again from 2015 to 2016 to determine how these prescribing
patterns changed over time. Log-binomial regression was used
to determine the relative risk of becoming a new long-term
user based on duration of use category from the prior year (no
use, short-term use, or intermediate use).
RESULTS
The number of veterans dispensed a VHA prescription rose
from 4,635,313 in 2010 to 4,991,926 in 2016. The prevalence
of opioid prescribing was 20.8% (962,193/4,635,313) in 2010,
peaked at 21.2% (1,017,826/4,793,253) in 2012, and declined
annually to 16.1% (803,888/4,991,926) in 2016 (Fig. 1). The
prevalence of long-term and intermediate use decreased by
approximately one-third: long-term use declined from 9.5%
(453,100/4,793,253 in 2012) to 6.2% (309,881/4,991,926 in
2016) and intermediate use declined from 4.4% (210,555/
4,793,253 in 2012) to 3.0% (150,884/4,991,926 in 2016). In

 contrast, short-term opioid use remained relatively constant
throughout the observation period, ranging from 343,556
(7.4%) in 2010 to 354,171 (7.4%) in 2012 and 343,123
(6.9%) in 2016.
Supplemental measures of opioid prescribing paralleled
the trend in decreasing prevalence. The total number of
opioid prescription fills declined by 24.4%, supply days by
27.2%, and morphine equivalents by 32.2% from 2010 to
2016 (Table 1). The reduction in opioid prescribing was
unevenly distributed across duration of use categories
(Table 1). Total opioid prescriptions decreased by 25.2%
among long-term users and 31.8% among intermediate-term
users, but only 1.6% among short-term users. In total, changes
in prescribing among long-term opioid users accounted for
83.0% (1,125,237/1,355,217) of the overall decline in opioid
prescription fills in the VHA during the observation period,
81.9% (33,344,343/40,692,111) of the change in supply days
dispensed, and 90.5% (1785 M/1973 M) of the change in
morphine equivalents. The number of supply days per pre-
scription was relatively stable among long-term users (1.7%
decrease), but declined 15.0% (3.2 days) among intermediate
users and 16.9% (2.7 days) among short-term users. Estimated
daily opioid doses were substantially higher among long-term
users, 47.0 mg of morphine equivalents in 2016, compared to
27.0 mg and 24.7 mg among intermediate and short-term
users, respectively. Daily doses declined slightly over time
among long-term users, down from 50.2 mg in 2010.
Given the declining prevalence of long-term opioid use, we
sought to determine the extent to which this was explained by
an increase in cessation among existing long-term users versus
a reduction in patients becoming new long-term users (Fig. 2).
Therefore, we examined patterns of transitioning into and out
of long-term use over subsequent years at two time intervals:
2010 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. Of 4,125,454 patients who
were VHA pharmacy users during 2010 and 2011, 389,890
(9.5%) were long-term opioid users in 2010. The majority
(82.5%; n = 321,710) persisted as long-term users in the sub-
sequent year, while the remaining 17.5% (n = 68,180) of pa-
tients did not persist with long-term use in 2011. However,
103,793 patients became new long-term users during 2011,
resulting in a net increase of 35,613 long-term opioid users
from 2010 to 2011. Applying the same approach to the later
period of 2015–2016 revealed some important differences.
Notably, 73,052 former long-term users discontinued, but only
44,359 new long-term users were observed, resulting in a net
reduction of 28,693 long-term users from 2015 to 2016. Given
the net decrease in the number of new long-term users over
time (103,793 − 44,359 = 59,434) and net increase in patients

 discontinuing (73,052 − 68,180 = 4872), new long-term use
accounted for more than 90% (59,434/64,306) of the decreas-
ing prevalence of long-term opioid use in the VHA.
The overall likelihood of transitioning to long-term opioid
use decreased from 2.8% to 1.1% during the observation
period, and decreased within all individual categories of prior
opioid use (Table 2). Among patients with no use in the prior
year, 1.1% of patients during 2010 and 0.4% of patients during
2015 developed subsequent long-term opioid use; 6.7% of
short-term users during 2010 compared to 2.6% during
2015, and 24.4% of intermediate users during 2010 compared
to 14.1% during 2015. These risks further demonstrated that
prior opioid exposure was associated with subsequent risk for
long-term opioid use in a stepwise manner. The relative risk of
transitioning to long-term use during 2016 was 6.5 (95% CI:
6.4, 6.7) among short-term users and 35.5 (95% CI: 34.8,
36.3) among intermediate users, relative to patients with no
opioid prescriptions filled during 2015.
DISCUSSION
On the surface, opioid prescribing trends followed similar
trajectories in VHA and non-VHA settings, peaking around
2012 and subsequently declining.7,9 We observed a decrease
of 16% in overall opioid prevalence between 2012 and 2015,
compared to 13% reported in non-VHA settings.7 Importantly,
our analysis provided a more finely tuned examination of
VHA trends, revealing that the prevalence of short-term opioid
prescribing decreased by approximately 7%, while the
prevalence of long-term and intermediate-term opioid pre-
scribing decreased by approximately one-third from 2012
through 2016. These findings stand in some contrast to non-
VHA settings. The average supply days per prescription de-
creased from 2010 through 2016 in the VHA, reflecting an
underlying decrease in long-term opioid use. However, in a
study of U.S. retail prescription data, this parameter increased
through 2015, driven primarily by a shift toward more 30-day
prescriptions, which may indicate a parallel rise in long-term
opioid use in the community setting.7 More direct evidence
comes from National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey data, which demonstrated a decrease in short-term opioid
use from 2012 to 2014, but an increase in long-term use during
this period.12
The relative stability of short-term opioid prescribing rates
within the VHA is consistent with observations from prior
time periods. From 2004 to 2012, incident opioid prescribing
increased by only 11%, where newly prescribed opioids gen-
erally reflect short-term use for acute pain.8 The fact that short-
term opioid prevalence decreased by only 7% from 2012 to
2016 should not be surprising given that incidence rates had
increased by a similarly small degree during the prior decade.
Short-term opioid therapy has a clear therapeutic role in the
management of acute pain.13 While the optimal rate of short-
term opioid prescribing in the VHA is unknown, the dose and
number of supply days dispensed should be minimized when
prescribed, and non-opioid alternatives should be employed
when clinically appropriate.13–15 Minimizing opioid prescrib-
ing for acute pain is important not only for reducing risk
among patients to whom they are dispensed, but also in
reducing the overall opioid supply distributed and available

 to the public at large. In keeping with this concept, mean
supply per prescription decreased by 2.7 days among short-
term opioid users in the VHA from 2010 to 2016, and de-
creased by 2.5 days among all users. In sharp contrast, data
from the non-VHA retail setting demonstrated an increase in
average days’ supply per prescription of 2–3 days between
2010 and 2015.7
One striking observation was the decrease in the prevalence
of long-term opioid therapy from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to
6.2% in 2016. This trend is particularly notable given that rates
of long-term opioid prescribing outside the VHA system ap-
peared stable, if not potentially increasing during this period.7
While minimizing short-term opioid exposure is important,
the clear majority of opioid harms occur among long-term
users, and these individuals accounted for 80–90% of VHA
opioid prescribing. Similarly, opioid prescribing increases in
the VHA prior to 2012 were largely driven by long-term use,
where opioid prevalence nearly doubled from 2004, and me-
dian calendar days of exposure increased from 87 to 147 days.8
Therefore, declining rates of long-term opioid use in the VHA
seem to be a favorable reversal of prior prescribing practices,
particularly in light of recent CDC guidelines calling for more
judicious use of long-term opioid therapy in the treatment of
chronic pain.5
More detailed examination revealed that recent decreases in
long-term opioid prescribing did not occur through discontin-
uation among existing users, but principally through reduc-
tions in the number of new long-term users. It is well docu-
mented and widely understood among practicing clinicians
that long-term opioid therapy is infrequently discontinued
once initiated.16 Therefore, it is little surprise that the path of
least resistance in curtailing opioid prescribing would be to

 focus first on minimizing new long-term use, presumably by
emphasizing the role of alternative pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic therapies. Overall, the likelihood of new long-
term opioid use decreased from 2.8% in 2011 to 1.1% in 2016,
and this trend was observed across all classifications of prior
opioid use, including non-users, short-term users, and inter-
mediate users.
Though determining the causal mechanisms underlying
observed trends was beyond the scope of our study, the
VHA has undertaken several initiatives that may explain our
findings.9 The 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs and
Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guide-
line for Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain17
emphasized a goal-directed approach to trialing opioid ther-
apy in chronic pain, careful patient selection and monitor-
ing, and weaning if treatment goals are not reached. These
guidelines have since been updated with a recommendation
against initiation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic
pain.18 Further, VHA has expanded access to complemen-
tary treatments and multimodal therapy for chronic pain. In
2009, two VHA directives were issued addressing the avail-
ability of chiropractic care19 and implementation of stepped
care,20 emphasizing a biopsychosocial understanding of
chronic pain. Increased provision of alternatives to opioid
therapy may have contributed to decreased opioid use.
Lastly, the VA Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) implemented
nationally in 2013 focused on specific clinical safety targets
such as high-dose use and concurrent benzodiazepine pre-
scribing, as well as monitoring via urine drug screens and
state prescription drug monitoring databases.21 Although
the OSI was primarily targeted at existing long-term opioid
users, it is possible the initiative helped accelerate a change
in prescribing culture that has multiple influences, includ-
ing media coverage of opioids and opioid-related deaths,
and non-VA policies or practice guidelines.
The primary limitation to our study was the inability to
observe opioid prescriptions filled by non-VA pharmacies.
First, our observation that 80–90% of opioid prescribing in
the VHA was accounted for by long-term use is true from the
system perspective, but may be overestimated from the patient
perspective. Patients suffering from acute pain may be more
likely than those with chronic pain to seek care outside the
VHA because it is closer to home or otherwise easier to
access on an acute basis. Moreover, patients with acute pain
seen at VHA community-based outpatient clinics, many
without a dispensing pharmacy on-site, may preferentially
fill opioid prescriptions at a local non-VA pharmacy. Thus,
opioid prescribing data within the VHA is likely skewed
toward long-term use relative to opioid prescriptions dis-
pensed to veterans across all healthcare systems and set-
tings. In addition, under-identification of opioid prescrip-
tions from non-VHA sources would result in misclassifica-
tion of patients into lower exposure categories. For exam-
ple, patients may have been classified as intermediate users
in our analysis, but would be classified as long-term users if
all opioid prescriptions were observable. An additional
limitation is that this analysis does not consider potential
changes in rates of underlying pain diagnoses or other
patient characteristics over time that might be associated
with opioid prescribing. However, it seems unlikely that
there has been a precipitous drop in the prevalence of
chronic pain or other such characteristics over the past few
years that would account for the magnitude of change
observed in long-term opioid prescribing.
CONCLUSION
Opioid prescribing trends followed similar trajectories in
VHA and non-VHA settings, peaking around 2012 and sub-
sequently declining. More detailed analysis revealed that
changes in long-term opioid prescribing accounted for most
of this decline in the VHA, whereas the primary driver in non-
VHA retail pharmacy data seemed to be decreases in short-
term use.7 This apparent discrepancy suggests that recent
VHA initiatives to curb the opioid epidemic may be having
a direct and specific benefit in minimizing potential harms
from exposure to long-term opioid therapy—particularly by
preventing patients from initiating long-term use. Future work
toward understanding precisely which initiatives have most
positively impacted opioid prescribing would be needed to
maintain effective approaches within the VHA, and as impor-
tantly, would offer valuable lessons that may be generalizable
to other healthcare systems, providers, and patients.
