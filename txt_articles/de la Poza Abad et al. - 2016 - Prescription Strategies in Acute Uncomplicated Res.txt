IMPORTANCE Delayed antibiotic prescription helps to reduce antibiotic use with reasonable
symptom control. There are different strategies of delayed prescription, but it is not yet clear
which one is the most effective.
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of 2 delayed strategies in acute,
uncomplicated respiratory infections.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We recruited 405 adults with acute, uncomplicated
respiratory infections from 23 primary care centers in Spain to participate in a pragmatic,
open-label, randomized clinical trial.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 potential prescription strategies:
(1) a delayed patient-led prescription strategy; (2) a delayed prescription collection strategy
requiring patients to collect their prescription from the primary care center; (3) an immediate
prescription strategy; or (4) a no antibiotic strategy. Delayed prescription strategies consist of
prescribing an antibiotic to take only if the symptoms worsen or if there is no improvement
several days after the medical visit.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the duration of symptoms and
severity of symptoms. Each symptom was scored using a 6-point Likert scale (scores of 3 or 4
were considered moderate; 5 or 6, severe). Secondary outcomes included antibiotic use,
patient satisfaction, and patients’beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics.
RESULTS A total of 405 patients were recruited, 398 of whom were included in the analysis;
136 patients (34.2%) were men; mean (SD) age, 45 (17) years. The mean severity of symptoms
ranged from 1.8 to 3.5 points on the Likert scale, and mean (SD) duration of symptoms described
on first visit was 6 (6) days. The mean (SD) general health status on first visit was 54 (20) based
on a scale with 0 indicating worst health status; 100, best status. Overall, 314 patients (80.1%)
were nonsmokers, and 372 patients (93.5%) did not have a respiratory comorbidity. The
presence of symptoms on first visit was similar among the 4 groups. The mean (SD) duration of
severe symptoms was 3.6 (3.3) days for the immediate prescription group and 4.7 (3.6) days for
the no prescription group. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of severe symptoms was 3
(1-4) days for the prescription collection group and 3 (2-6) days for the patient-led prescription
group. The median (IQR) of the maximum severity for any symptom was 5 (3-5) for the
immediate prescription group and the prescription collection group; 5 (4-5) for the patient-led
prescription group; and 5 (4-6) for the no prescription group. Patients randomized to the no
prescription strategy or to either of the delayed strategies used fewer antibiotics and less
frequently believed in antibiotic effectiveness. Satisfaction was similar across groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Delayed strategies were associated with slightly greater but
clinically similar symptom burden and duration and also with substantially reduced antibiotic
use when compared with an immediate strategy.

R
espiratory diseases are one of the most common rea-
sons for consultation with family physicians, the most
frequent being rhinitis, pharyngitis, and acute
bronchitis.1 Most respiratory infections are self-limiting, and
recent systematic reviews have suggested that antibiotics
modify the course of most of these infections only slightly.2-8
Nevertheless, in the United States, about 60% of patients with
a sore throat and 71% of patients with acute uncomplicated
bronchitis still receive an antibiotic prescription.9,10 Overpre-
scription of antibiotics not only increases resistance to these
drugs11,12 but also strains resources, places patients at risk of
adverse effects, and increases the number of future consulta-
tions for similar episodes.13-15 In primary care, the availability
of diagnostic procedures is generally limited, contributing to
diagnosticuncertaintyanddrivingantibioticprescriptioneven
when there is no clear indication of bacterial infection. Anti-
biotics are also often prescribed because physicians and pa-
tients are concerned about the risk of complications and be-
cause many patients still expect an antibiotic prescription,16
an expectation that may be overestimated by physicians.17
In cases of uncertainty, when it is difficult to determine
whetheraninfectioniscausedbyavirusorbacteria,thedelayed
antibioticprescribingstrategycanbeavaluabletooltoavoidun-
necessaryantibioticuse.Thisapproachconsistsofprescribingan
antibiotic to take only if the symptoms worsen or if there is no
improvement several days after the medical visit. This strategy
hasbeenevaluatedmainlyinacute,uncomplicatedrespiratory
infections.18 Systematic reviews have suggested that delayed
antibioticstrategiescouldresultinpoorersymptomcontrolthan

caltrialpublishedtodateforacuteuncomplicatedrespiratoryin-
fections in primary care, Little et al16 found little difference in
symptom control in the short term between delayed antibiotic
strategies and no prescription. In a recent British study22 in pa-
tientswithsorethroat,complicationswerefoundinonly1.4%of
patients,withtheriskofcomplicationsbeingnohigherinthede-
layed antibiotic group than in the immediate antibiotic group.
Theuseofdelayedprescriptionvarieswidelyfromcountry
to country. In the United Kingdom, more than 50% of all pre-
scriptions for acute, uncomplicated respiratory infections are
delayed,23 while in Southern Europe this strategy is not com-
monlyused.NoevidenceisavailablefortheUnitedStates.Inad-
dition, most studies on delayed antibiotic strategies have been
carriedoutintheUnitedKingdomandScandinaviancountries,
wheretheconsumptionofantibioticsislowerthaninSouthern

ated delayed prescribing in primary care and found a reduction
of antibiotic prescribing but did not include clinical outcomes.
Therefore,wedesignedourstudytodeterminetheeffectiveness
of 2 delayed antibiotic strategies compared with immediate
antibiotic prescription or no offer of antibiotics.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We performed a pragmatic, randomized, multicenter, clinical
trial (trial protocol available in Supplement 1), the methodol-
ogy of which has been published elsewhere.26 Competitive re-
cruitmentwasperformedin23primarycarecentersin4regions
in Spain from December 2009 to July 2012. Eligible patients
were older than 18 years and had 1 of the following acute, un-
complicated respiratory infections: acute pharyngitis, rhino-
sinusitis,acutebronchitis,orexacerbationofmild-to-moderate
chronicobstructivepulmonarydisease(COPD)(eAppendix1in
Supplement2).Inallcases,thephysicianhadreasonabledoubt
astowhethertotreatwithanantibiotic.Thestudywasapproved
by the ethics committee of the Jordi Gol i Gurina Foundation
(Barcelona, Spain) and by the clinical research ethics commit-
tees in each healthcare area. Approval was also obtained from
the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Interventions
Patientswererandomizedto1of4strategies,twoofwhich—the
patient-ledprescriptionstrategyandtheprescriptioncollection
strategy—weredelayedprescriptionstrategies.Patientsrandom-
ized to the patient-led prescription strategy were given an anti-
biotic at first consultation, and patients randomized to the pre-
scription collection strategy could collect the antibiotic at their
primary care reception desk 3 days after the first consultation.
Patients allocated to the delayed antibiotic strategies re-
ceived the same instructions from the physician. They were
told it was normal to feel worse over the first few days after
the visit. If they felt substantially worse in the first few days,
however, they were recommended to consider taking the an-
tibiotics or to return to the physician if they considered it nec-
essary. If they noted no improvement after 5 days (in cases of
pharyngitis) or after 10 days (in cases of other infections), they
were also instructed to consider taking the antibiotics.
Patientsrandomizedtotheimmediateprescriptionstrategy
receivedanantibioticatfirstvisitandwereinstructedtostartthe
medicationonthesameday,andpatientsrandomizedtotheno
prescription strategy were not offered antibiotics.
Patients allocated to the immediate prescription strategy
or to the no prescription strategy were told it was normal to
feel worse over the first few days after the visit. However, they
were instructed to consider reconsultation if they felt they
should see their physician or if there was no improvement af-
ter 5 days (in cases of pharyngitis) or after 10 days (in cases of
other infections).
In all 4 prescription strategy groups, the choice of
antibiotic was made by the physician.
Randomization and Masking
Physicians randomized patients centrally using an electronic
online platform. Randomization was performed using per-
muted block sizes of 4 and stratified by type of infection.
Neither patients nor health professionals were blinded.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the duration and severity
of symptoms. Patients filled out a daily questionnaire for a
maximum of 30 days.27 Each symptom was scored using a
6-point Likert scale. Symptoms scoring 3 or 4 were consid-
ered moderate, and those scoring 5 or 6 were considered se-

vere. We included common symptoms such as fever, discom-
fort or general pain, cough, difficulty sleeping, changes in
everyday life in all patients, and specific symptoms accord-
ing to the condition. Our secondary outcomes were antibiotic
use, satisfaction with health care, belief in the effectiveness
of antibiotics, and absenteeism (absence from work or doing
their daily activities). We also determined the risk of compli-
cations (eg, pneumonia, abscesses, or cellulitis) and the need
for unscheduled health care (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2).

Statistical Analyses
Sample Size Calculation
We calculated a sample size of 150 patients per arm (600 pa-
tients) considering a mean (SD) of 12 (6) days as the average
durationofanacuteuncomplicatedrespiratoryinfectionwith-
out treatment.27 We considered a difference of 2 days in the
duration of symptoms in the immediate antibiotic strategy,
compared with a delayed strategy, as a clinically relevant re-
sult. For our statistical analyses, we used an α error of 5%
(α = .05) and a power of 80% (β = 0.2).
Main Analyses
Characteristicsofthestudypopulationweredescribedusingfre-
quencies for categorical variables, and mean (SD) for quantita-
tive variables. To compare the included strategies, we used a χ2
test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and analysis of
variance(ANOVA)forcontinuousvariables.Tocomparethedu-
ration of symptoms across strategies, we used a negative bino-
mialregressionmodelpersymptomwithsymptomduration(ie,
number of days with the symptom) as the dependent variable
and both the prescription strategy and antibiotic consumption
asindependentvariables.Forseverityofsymptoms,weusedan

complications, adverse effects, or the need for unscheduled
care among the strategy groups, and no differences were
observed in the perception of general health statuses as-
sessed at 30 days. The majority of patients that collected the
antibiotic reported that they finally took them (Table 5).
Rates of absenteeism were lower in the delayed strategy
groups (prescription collection, 18 patients [21.4%]; patient-
led prescription, 23 patients [25.8%]) than in the immediate
prescription group (28 patients [33.3%]) and the no prescrip-
tion group (33 patients [39.8%]) (P = .05). Patient satisfaction
was high and similar among the 4 groups (P = .14). Belief that
antibiotics had no effect or were not very effective was higher
for patients in the 2 delayed antibiotic strategies (prescrip-
tion collection, 12 patients [15.6%]; patient-led prescription,
16 patients [19.0%]) and the no antibiotic strategy (15 pa-
tients [19.7%]) than the immediate prescription strategy
(7 patients [8.2%]) (P = .02). Finally, more patients random-
ized to the immediate prescription strategy (n = 72 [85.7%]) re-
ported that they would return to their physician for a similar
episode than patients in the no prescription (n = 59 [70.2%]),
prescription collection (n = 58 [69.1%]), and patient-led
prescription strategies (n = 60 [69.0%]) (P = .06).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date outside
Northern Europe to evaluate the effect of 2 delayed antibiotic
strategies in acute, uncomplicated respiratory infections on
symptom control. We found that the delayed strategy groups
had slightly greater symptom burden and duration than the
immediate prescription group, although the differences were
not clinically relevant. Delayed prescription and no prescrip-
tion strategies notably reduced antibiotic use compared with
the immediate prescription group.
Our results are comparable with a previous Cochrane sys-
tematic review21 and a recent trial by Little et al16 studying de-
layedprescriptioninacuteuncomplicatedrespiratoryinfections.
Withrespecttothedurationofsymptoms,theCochranereview
of3157patientswithrespiratoryinfectionsreportedthatthedu-
rationofsymptomsinthedelayedantibioticstrategygroupswas
similartothatintheimmediateprescriptionapproach,particu-
larly in those with a sore throat and acute otitis media.21,22 This
was consistent with our study, which showed that the duration
ofseveresymptomswasquitesimilarintheimmediateprescrip-
tion group and in the 2 delayed prescription groups.
In their trial, Little et al16 found minimal differences in
symptom severity. The authors compared the effectiveness
of 4 delayed antibiotic strategies (recontact for a prescrip-
tion, post-dated prescription, prescription collection, and
patient-led prescription) with no antibiotics in patients with
acute uncomplicated respiratory infections. However, the
study did not include an immediate antibiotic randomiza-
tion strategy. Our findings are concurrent with their results.

strategy.Conversely,theuseofantibioticsintheimmediatean-
tibiotic group was very high as expected (n = 92 [91.1%]).
Although still unclear, several patterns in the delayed pre-
scription approach seem to be emerging. Earlier studies21 com-
paringdelayedprescriptionstrategiesshowedvariabilityinan-
tibiotic use rates, with higher use in patient-led strategies than
intheprescriptioncollectionstrategies.Laterstudies,16likeour
own, show a similar pattern. The hassle of having to return to
a clinic for a prescription likely plays a role in this difference.

The low use of antibiotics observed in clinical trials should be
considered with caution because they may not reflect real use.
As opposed to observational studies, research participants re-
ceive structured advice and are typically more motivated than
in usual practice.25
TheCochranereview21didnotfindanyevidencethatdelayed
antibiotics are safer or more harmful than a no antibiotic ap-
proach, but as in our study, this outcome was underpowered.16
With respect to patient satisfaction in the Cochrane review, im-
mediateantibioticshadslightlyhigherlevelsofpatientsatisfac-
tion than delayed antibiotics, although the clinical significance
was marginal (92% vs 87%, respectively).21 Our results did not
reveal any significant differences between groups.
Limitations and Strengths of Our Study
The first limitation of our study is that we did not achieve the
targetsamplesize.Thiswasmainlybecauseweranoutoffund-
ing since recruitment was slow as a result of clinicians’time
limitations.28Despitethesmallersamplesize,however,thevari-
abilityobservedinthedurationofsymptomswas2.8insteadof
6 standard deviations, which was lower than expected. With
these new data our study was overpowered. Second, most pa-
tientshadpharyngitisandbronchitis,limitingtheinferencesfor
patientswithrhinosinusitisorexacerbationofmild-to-moderate
COPD.Third,itcouldbearguedthattheopennatureofthestudy
mayhavecausedaplaceboeffectfavoringantibiotics.However,
thiseffectwasminimizedbythesimilarstructuredinformation
allpatientsreceivedabouttheself-limitingnatureofrespiratory
infections and the advice about nonantibiotic medication use.
Furthermore, the open design allowed us to study the percep-
tions of patients in a situation similarly to usual practice.29
Thestrengthsofourstudyareitspragmaticdesignandthat
our study, as far as we know, is the largest trial to assess de-
layed prescription strategies outside Northern Europe by
directly comparing delayed prescription strategies with an
immediate prescription arm in a randomized fashion.
Implications for Practice and Research
Delayed prescription strategies are a useful approach to man-
agement in patients with acute uncomplicated respiratory in-
fections. When patients or physicians are concerned about the
risk of complications, or when patients expect to be pre-
scribed antibiotics, a delayed antibiotic strategy may be par-
ticularly helpful compared with a no prescription strategy. De-
layed prescription strategies show high potential for clinical
benefit not only in Spain but in other countries, including the
United States, where antibiotic use is often inappropriate.9,10
Furtherstudiesarerequiredtoidentifysubgroupsinwhich
delayed prescription strategies may be most useful. Like-
wise, delayed strategies should be evaluated in larger popu-
lations that include older patients, participants with a lower
educational level, exacerbations of mild-moderate COPD, or
acute sinusitis and otitis. Finally, more qualitative research is
called for to better understand the contextual use of delayed
prescription strategies.
Conclusions
In this pragmatic, open-label, randomized trial of antibiotic
treatment strategy for acute, uncomplicated respiratory in-
fections, delayed strategies were associated with slightly
greater, but clinically similar, symptom burden and duration,
as well as substantially reduced antibiotic use when com-
pared with an immediate prescription strategy. In case of un-
certainty, delayed strategies should become standard prac-
ticeastheyreduceantibioticuseandpatientbeliefinantibiotic
effectiveness.

Delayed Antibiotic Prescribing Strategies—Time to Implement?
Amanda R. McCullough, PhD; Paul P. Glasziou, PhD
Despite growing concern over antibiotic resistance, global
antibiotic use continues to rise.1 Outpatients in the United
States used more than 30 million antibiotics for acute respi-
ratory infections in 2010,2
yet those prescriptions
offered minimal or no ben-
efits for most patients.3
Since antibiotic use drives the development of antibiotic
resistance, simple and effective interventions to curb antibi-
otic use and slow the development of resistance are urgently
needed. A delayed prescription strategy is an intervention
that may offer an acceptable compromise between immedi-
ate and no antibiotic prescription.
Cates4 first used a delayed prescribing strategy for par-
entsofchildrenwithacuteotitismediabyprovidingthemwith
anantibioticprescriptionandinstructionstowaitfor1or2days
before filling it. At 1 year, amoxicillin use fell by 32% (95% CI,
25%-39%) compared with a 12% (95% CI, 4%-20%) reduction
incontrols.4Thisreductioninantibioticusewassustainedeven
after 3 years.5 A systematic review of subsequent random-
ized clinical trials6 confirmed that delayed prescribing re-
ducesantibioticusecomparedwithimmediateprescribingand
causes only minor reductions in patient satisfaction without
increasing rates of complications or consultations. Fewer pa-
tients (28%) used antibiotics if they had to return to collect a
delayed prescription from the clinic reception compared with
40% of patients when a delayed prescription was given dur-
ing the consultation.6 The lowest rate of antibiotic prescrip-
tion was achieved by not prescribing antibiotics (14% of pa-
tients) and the highest rate was achieved by providing an
immediateantibioticprescription(93%ofpatients).6Therehas
been no direct comparison of these 4 strategies in a single trial,
and the sustainability of delayed prescription outside of the
study by Cates5 has not been explored.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, de la Poza Abad
and colleagues7 test delayed prescribing in a 4-arm random-
ized clinical trial for adults with uncomplicated acute respi-
ratory infections in primary care clinics in Spain. This is the
first study in a Spanish setting and the first to directly com-
pare 4 different prescription strategies: (1) a patient-led strat-
egy where physicians prescribe an antibiotic and advise pa-
tients to take it only if symptoms worsen or do not improve
within several days; (2) a collection strategy where patients
could collect an antibiotic prescription on day 3 postconsul-
tation; (3) an immediate prescription strategy; or (4) a no
prescription strategy without reconsultation.
Amongpatientsallocatedtotheimmediateprescribingstrat-
egy,91%usedantibiotics.7Ratesofantibioticuseinthepatient-
led,prescriptioncollection,andnoprescriptionstrategieswere
significantly lower: 33%, 23%, and 12%, respectively (absolute
reductions in antibiotic use of 58%, 68%, and 79%).7 Com-
pared with the immediate prescribing strategy, severe symp-
toms lasted 0.4 to 1.5 days longer in the patient-led, prescrip-
tion collection, and no prescription strategies, but patient
satisfactiondidnotdiffer.Importantly,fewerpatientsrandom-
ized to the patient-led, prescription collection, or no prescrip-
tion strategies intended to reconsult for the same illness (69%,
70%,and69%,respectively)comparedwiththeimmediatepre-
scription strategy (86%).7 Overall, more patients randomized
to the patient-led, prescription collection, and no prescribing
strategiesbelievedthatantibioticswereineffectiveforacutere-
spiratory infections (19%, 16%, and 20%, respectively) com-
pared with the immediate prescribing strategy (8%).7
These findings should be interpreted in light of the study’
s
limitations. The risk of allocation bias is unclear because the
authors do not report the allocation concealment procedures
at randomization. Participants self-reported their symptom
burden and antibiotic use leading to a high risk of measure-
