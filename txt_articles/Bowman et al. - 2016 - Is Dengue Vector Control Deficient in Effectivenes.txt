Abstract
Background
Although a vaccine could be available as early as 2016, vector control remains the primary
approach used to prevent dengue, the most common and widespread arbovirus of humans
worldwide. We reviewed the evidence for effectiveness of vector control methods in reduc-
ing its transmission.
Methodology/Principal Findings
Studies of any design published since 1980 were included if they evaluated method(s) tar-
geting Aedes aegypti or Ae. albopictus for at least 3 months. Primary outcome was dengue
incidence. Following Cochrane and PRISMA Group guidelines, database searches yielded
960 reports, and 41 were eligible for inclusion, with 19 providing data for meta-analysis.
Study duration ranged from 5 months to 10 years. Studies evaluating multiple tools/
approaches (23 records) were more common than single methods, while environmental
management was the most common method (19 studies). Only 9/41 reports were random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs). Two out of 19 studies evaluating dengue incidence were
RCTs, and neither reported any statistically significant impact. No RCTs evaluated effec-
tiveness of insecticide space-spraying (fogging) against dengue. Based on meta-analyses,
house screening significantly reduced dengue risk, OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05–0.93, p = 0.04),
as did combining community-based environmental management and water container cov-
ers, OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.15–0.32, p<0.0001). Indoor residual spraying (IRS) did not impact
significantly on infection risk (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.22–2.11; p = 0.50). Skin repellents, insecti-
cide-treated bed nets or traps had no effect (p>0.5), but insecticide aerosols (OR 2.03; 95%
CI 1.44–2.86) and mosquito coils (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.09–1.91) were associated with higher
dengue risk (p = 0.01). Although 23/41 studies examined the impact of insecticide-based
tools, only 9 evaluated the insecticide susceptibility status of the target vector population
during the study.

prevention.
Author Summary
Dengue fever has increased dramatically over the past 50 years and today is the most wide-
spread mosquito-borne arboviral disease, affecting nearly half the world’s population in
128 countries. Until the arrival of a vaccine, control of its Aedes vectors has been the only
method to prevent dengue infection. With dengue outbreaks occurring at increasing fre-
quency and intensity, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the litera-
ture, to evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of vector control strategies currently
available. Forty-one studies (from 5 months to 10 years duration) were included in the
review. Most studies investigated combinations of approaches but only 9 studies were ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs). Remarkably, no RCTs evaluated effectiveness against
dengue of insecticide space-spraying (outdoor fogging), the main response to dengue out-
breaks used worldwide. Nevertheless, there was limited evidence indicating that house
screening and to a lesser extent, community-based environmental management with
water container covers could reduce risk of dengue infection. However, skin repellents,
bed nets and mosquito traps had no effect while insecticide aerosols and mosquito coils
were associated with higher dengue risk. However, the quality of the few studies eligible
for inclusion was poor overall, and the evidence base is very weak, compromising the
knowledge base for making recommendations on delivery of appropriate and effective
control. Given this paucity of reliable evidence, standardised studies of higher quality must
now be a priority.
Introduction
Dengue is a viral infection transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes. With an esti-
mated 390 million dengue infections occurring every year, and almost half the world’s popula-
tion exposed to infection with dengue viruses, it is the most widespread mosquito-borne
arboviral disease today, affecting 128 countries worldwide [1–3]. The dramatic increase in den-
gue over the past 50 years can be attributed to a number of factors, ranging from increased
urbanization, in-country and international population movement, erratic water supplies and
ineffective or unsustainable vector control [4, 5]. The human and economic cost of frequent
dengue outbreaks is high, though current Figs are almost certainly underestimates [6–9]. Den-
gue is showing signs of emergence in more temperate latitudes [10–13] and is a potential threat
to many of the international mass-gatherings that are a feature the modern era, such as the
FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, or religious gatherings like the Hajj, although their contri-
bution to global spread has never been proven [14, 15].
Until recent advances in vaccine development [16–17], and the approval and potential avail-
ability of the first product in 2016 [18], dengue has been unique among the major vector-borne
diseases, in that prevention from infection could only be attempted by reducing or eliminating
bites by infected vector mosquitoes [19, 20].

 Dengue viruses are transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti, a cosmotropical mosquito that
thrives in urban environments. It is highly anthropophilic and breeds in small bodies of fresh
water, most commonly in the numerous containers found around the home, ranging from
water storage drums and overhead tanks to bottles, buckets and discarded waste items [4].
Between blood feeding and oviposition, adult female mosquitoes rest within or close to human
dwellings [19]. A second vector, Aedes albopictus, was originally confined to Asia, but in recent
decades has expanded its global range and contributed to the spread of the chikungunya virus,
as well as dengue [21–24].
Control of dengue vectors can be directed against the immature aquatic stages (larvae and
pupae) or the adult mosquitoes, with a number of methods available for each approach.
Described in detail elsewhere [19, 25], they can be grouped according to whether they target
the vector directly (i.e. aim to kill mosquitoes using insecticides or natural enemies or prevent
them from biting using repellents) or indirectly (e.g. environmental modification or sanitation
improvements that reduce potential larval development sites, or house improvements that pre-
vent mosquito entry). Some approaches require skilled staff and/or dedicated resources (e.g.
specialised spraying equipment, insecticides, transport) in order to be delivered effectively in a
vertical approach. For others, affected communities, empowered through education and advo-
cacy, can mobilize and mount effective control operations relatively independently via horizon-
tal or community-based efforts. Hence, space-spraying and larviciding require trained
personnel to deliver potentially toxic insecticides using specialized equipment and are depen-
dent on vertical municipality-driven programs. In contrast, reductions in potential larval devel-
opment sites can be achieved with householders and communities taking responsibility,
supported by education and social mobilization [19].
In dengue-affected communities worldwide, immature vector populations are targeted
through the reduction or elimination of potential larval development sites, typically by collec-
tion of purposeless or discarded containers in ‘clean-up’ or environmental management cam-
paigns; functional or useful sites are either covered (water storage containers), drained (gutters
or channels) or treated with an appropriate insecticide (usually referred to as ‘larviciding’) or
biological control agent (predatory copepods or fish). Identification of, and targeted action
towards, ‘productive’ container types (i.e. those that are assessed as contributing the greatest
burden of pupae, relative to other containers in the area) can potentially enable more cost-
effective larval control [26,27].
The typical response to dengue outbreaks is to target the adult mosquito population by
space-spraying or fogging with insecticide, delivered outside or inside the home, with the aim
of severely reducing the vector population at the time of delivery. This method is not designed
to deliver persistent insecticide residues on treated surfaces and if the outbreak continues, it
must be repeated at intervals that coincide with the vector life cycle [19].
Previously, Erlanger et al. (2008) [28] reviewed data on the effectiveness on vector indices of
all vector control methods and concluded that integrated vector control was the most effective,
while environmental management had minimal impact. Notably, the evidence for impact of
outdoor space spraying was limited, though only 1 of the studies included was less than 30
years old (dated from 2015). Two subsequent reviews [29, 30] focused on peri-domestic space
spraying and concluded that there was no evidence to support its use in dengue outbreak con-
trol, either as a standalone intervention or in combination with other interventions. Horstick
et al. (2010) [31] also found no evidence for a demonstrable effect of vector control on entomo-
logical indices and identified specific weaknesses in funding, management, staffing and com-
munity engagement, all of which conspired to lower operational standards and ultimately
restrict any likelihood of success. Recent reviews have examined the evidence for the effective-
ness of individual methods, including copepods, fish and temephos [32–34].

 Today, dengue outbreaks occur at an increasing frequency and intensity in affected commu-
nities worldwide and the need for evidence-based selection of the most appropriate interven-
tions has never been greater. What are the best currently available dengue vector control tools,
as measured by their impact on dengue infections, and not simply on vector populations? Are
previous dengue control failures the result of low operational and management strategies, or
are the available tools simply not effective? What evidence exists to provide a basis for evaluat-
ing dengue vector control today? To answer these questions and to provide guidance on the
most effective strategies currently available to combat dengue, we report here on a systematic
review and meta-analysis of the evidence.
Methods
Objectives
To systematically review randomized and non-randomized studies to evaluate the evidence of
the effectiveness of vector control interventions in reducing a) Aedes sp. vector indices and b)
human DENV infection and/or disease. The original search was conducted in April 2012 and
updated in December 2013 and on 10th January 2015.
Eligibility criteria
Table 1 displays the eligibility criteria. Only studies that presented data for a minimum dura-
tion of 3 months were included (regardless of the frequency of treatments undertaken within
that period), as this was considered the minimum period required to demonstrate a sustained
impact on the vector population and/or impact on dengue transmission. In addition, only stud-
ies published since 1980 were considered eligible for inclusion, for a number of reasons. The
period after 1980 saw the expansion in urban populations worldwide, notably in the less devel-
oped countries where the ratio of populations in urban and rural regions began to change dra-
matically [35,36]. This also was the beginning of the ‘globalization’ era, as characterized by
steep increases in trans-national and international movement of humans and merchandise,
and the time when all four dengue serotypes were reported in every continent, leading to an
increase in the frequency and magnitude of dengue outbreaks [5,37,38]. We are familiar with
the achievements prior to 1970, such as the ambitious yellow fever programs when Aedes
aegypti populations were significantly diminished, and indeed eliminated from many cities and
large geographic areas throughout Latin America [1,4,5,39]. On balance, it was concluded that
the control tools available before the 1980s (e.g. the highly persistent insecticide DDT) and the
settings in which they were carried out, were not pertinent to the challenge of dengue control
in urban environments of the 21st century, based on the significant logistical, sociological and

 epidemiological changes, and the rise in insecticide resistance in vector populations [40,41]
that have occurred in many of those countries during the past 35 years.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was dengue incidence (any reported case data; clinical or lab-confirmed/
serologically positive cases); secondary outcomes were a range of vector indices: Breteau Index
(BI), House Index (HI), Container Index (CI), tank positivity, number of mosquito adults,
pupae per person index (PPPI), presence of Aedes immatures and ovitrap positivity rates.
All methods were pre-specified in the review protocol. PRISMA Group guidelines were fol-
lowed as standard methodologies [42,43].
Search strategy
The databases WHOLIS, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and Science Citation Index were
searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) “dengue” followed by the Boolean opera-
tor “and” combined with the following ‘free text’ terms “epidemic” and further combined in
succession with: ‘threshold’ ‘sentinel’ ‘early warning’ ‘case management’ ‘vector control’
‘DDSS’ ‘space spraying’ ‘indoor residual spraying’ ‘fogging’ ‘integrated vector management’
‘IVM’ ‘source reduction’ ‘container’ ‘larvicide’ ‘repellent’ ‘insecticide’ ‘adulticide’ ‘fumigant’
‘aerial spraying’ ‘dengue decision support system’. The reference list of each of the included
studies was also searched, and ‘‘grey literature” (cited unpublished documents) were sought by
communication with authors. No limits were placed on year of publication status or language.
Study selection
Search results were imported into EndNote (EndNote X5, Build 7473). LRB and PJM indepen-
dently assessed the title and abstract of each record (or the corresponding full article) retrieved
by the search for eligibility; any discrepancies were discussed. The full article was retrieved for
each eligible study. The study’s investigators were contacted if eligibility was unclear, additional
data were unpublished or the article was inaccessible. Each article was scrutinized to detect
multiple publications from the same trial; such publications were included as a single study.
Data extraction
LRB and PJM independently extracted data according to an agreed checklist and differences
were discussed. Trial characteristics and risk of bias information were extracted along with out-
come data (S1 Table). For each randomized controlled trial, we extracted the number of indi-
viduals randomized and the number of individuals analysed for each treatment group. For
dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the number of individuals experiencing the event in each
treatment group for each study. For continuous outcomes we extracted means and standard
deviations (where presented) or medians, interquartile ranges, and ranges. When such data
were not reported, we extracted narrative information and tabulated results. For non-random-
ized studies, we extracted measures of effect, as well as treatment group data.
Risk of bias assessment
Using a pre-piloted form, LRB and PJM independently assessed risk of bias and discussed any
differences (S2 and S3 Tables). For randomized controlled trials we used the Cochrane risk of
bias tool and addressed: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding;
incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases [43]. For each compo-
nent of each trial, a judgment of high, low, or unclear risk of bias was made and the rationale

 for the judgment was given (S2 Table and S1 Fig). For non-randomized studies, LRB and PJM
used the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies [44] (S3 Table). This ensured that
each study could be ranked according to inherent study design limitations, which included but
were not limited to, bias, confounding and blinding.
Data analyses
Analyses were performed in Review Manager (RevMan Version 5.2. Copenhagen: The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, 2012). We extracted the measure of effect and CI from the study reports.
Where possible, we stratified analyses by intervention, outcome, measures of effect and study
design. For multi-arm trials, data from numerous intervention groups were pooled. We calcu-
lated trial-level results (i.e. MD, RR or OR and standard error [SE]) and pooled them using ran-
dom-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis to account for large variability present between
studies. Results were visualised in forest plots. Sub-group analyses were used to stratify studies
that used different and/ or combination interventions.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test statistic, the chi-squared test (P<0.01 indicated
possible significance) and by visual inspection of the forest plots to identify overlapping confi-
dence intervals. Studies that could not be visualised in forest plots were presented in tables.
When heterogeneity was detected, possible causes were explored using subgroup analyses
and predefined covariates.
Subgroup analyses were planned to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (i.e. effects of
seasonality, mosquito species, duration of intervention, coverage), but analyses were not car-
ried out because of the low number of studies available for analysis. For the same reason, sensi-
tivity analyses that excluded studies with a high risk of bias were pre-planned to assess the
robustness of results, but were not carried out. Hence, the planned funnel plots were not con-
structed to explore possible publication biases.
Results
Study eligibility results
A total of 960 potentially relevant studies were identified using systematic searches of the data-
bases, grey literature and their cited reference lists and 19 more were identified from other
sources (Fig 1). After removing duplicates, 582 citations were screened, of which 480 were
excluded. The full texts of the remaining 102 records were assessed and 61 articles were
excluded.
The reasons for exclusion were: incomplete outcome data (18 studies); study was a review, a
non-peer reviewed report or a mathematical model (14 studies); no intervention was carried
out (eight studies); undefined or inadequate dengue case definition (three studies); intervention
or outbreak duration was less than 3 months (10 studies); study included only one required
outcome (three studies); study preceded 1980 (three studies); time series data collection not
reported (two studies).
Forty-one studies were included in the review [45–85] (S1 Table), nineteen of which
reported sufficient data for inclusion in meta-analyses [46–48, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 66, 69, 73, 74,
76, 77, 80–83, 85].
Characteristics of included studies
The main characteristics of included studies are summarised in S4 Table. Of the 41 included
studies, geographic study locations comprised: SE Asia (n = 11) or Central America (10), South

 Asia (8), Australasia (4), South America (5) and North America (3). All studies were published
between 1986 and 2014, and 2009 was the median year of publication.
Grouped by study design, the studies comprised: 9 randomised controlled trials (i.e. 7 clus-
ter-randomized and 2 randomized controlled trials) and 32 non-randomised studies (i.e. 8 con-
trolled trials, 7 longitudinal studies, 4 interrupted time series studies, 5 before and after studies,

 2 observational studies, 1 case-control study, 1 cross sectional study, 1 retrospective observa-
tional study, 1 ecological study and 2 models) (S4 Table).
Vertical and community-led interventions were used exclusively in 20 and 10 studies
respectively, and 11 studies used a combination of both. Combination interventions (23 stud-
ies) were more common than single interventions (18 studies). Study duration ranged from 5
months to 10 years; 16 studies were less than 1 year, 12 took place over 1–3 years and 7 studies
were 8 or more years in duration.
Fig 2 (top) summarises the frequency of vector control tools by study design. The most fre-
quently evaluated interventions were clean-up programs (n = 19), of which 4 were cluster ran-
domised controlled trials. Outdoor fogging (9), education (11), larviciding (7) water jar covers
(7) also were the subject of multiple studies.
All studies presented data on Aedes aegypti; four presented additional data on Aedes albopic-
tus (S4 Table). Nineteen studies reported dengue incidence, 17 studies reported BI, 16 studies
reported HI, 11 studies reported CI, 1 study reported tank positivity, 3 studies reported number
of mosquito adults, 6 studies reported pupal indices, 3 studies reported ovitrap data.
Fig 2 (bottom) summarises the reported reduction in outcome at a statistically significant
level (p<0.05). Of note was the observation that in studies where it was an outcome, dengue
incidence was not reduced in either of 2 randomised study designs, although 8 of 14 studies
with other experimental designs reported a statistically significant reduction.
Risk of bias assessment results
Randomised studies.
The results of this assessment are presented in S2 Table and S1 Fig.
Nine studies were at low risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. Seven studies were at low
risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, while one was at medium risk and one was at a high
risk of bias. There was a high risk of bias due to inadequate blinding in all studies. Risk of bias
through allocation concealment was low in one study, unclear in four studies and high in four
studies. Risk of bias attributed to generation of allocation sequence was low in four studies,
unclear in four studies and high in one study.
Non-randomised studies.
The results of this assessment for non-randomised studies are
shown in S3 Table. Nineteen studies scored 3, equating a weak study, while nine studies scored
2, equal to a moderately strong study, and only two studies scored 1, equal to a strong study.
Effectiveness of interventions
Nineteen studies [46–48, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 66, 69, 73, 74, 76, 77, 80–83, 85] provided sufficient
data to allow their inclusion in meta-analyses. The results of those analyses are presented here
stratified by reported outcome, either the impact on dengue incidence or on vector indices.
Impact on dengue incidence
Impact of dengue incidence in randomised controlled trials.
None of the included
reports that investigated the impact of vector control on dengue incidence were randomised
controlled studies.
Impact on dengue incidence in non-randomised controlled trials.
Five studies measur-
ing the impact of any intervention[s] on dengue incidence using odds ratios were included in
one meta-analysis (Fig 3). These included a number of study designs (cross sectional, observa-
tional [x2], retrospective observational, case-control) and interventions (knockdown sprays or
insecticidal aerosols, house screening, indoor residual spraying, community-based environ-
mental management, insect repellents, bed nets, mosquito coils and mosquito traps).

 Heterogeneity across the studies was high, most likely due to the varying study designs, number
of studies per subgroup and intervention type (I2 = 92.1%).
The presence of house screening in homes (three studies: 52,59,69) significantly reduced the
odds of dengue incidence compared to homes without screens (0.22: 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.05, 0.93; p = 0.04). Combined community-based environmental management together
with the use of water container covers [58] also reduced the odds of dengue incidence to 0.22
(95% CI 0.15, 0.32; p<0.0001).
Indoor residual spraying reduced the odds of infection to 0.67 (95% CI 0.22, 2.11), but the
result was not significant (p = 0.50) [66,69]. There was no evidence that the use of mosquito
repellents [52], bed nets [52,69] or mosquito traps [69] significantly increased or reduced the
odds of dengue infection, with odds ratios of 1.02 (95% CI 0.71, 1.47; p = 0.91), 0.91 (95% CI
0.49, 1.67; p = 0.75) and 1.18 (95% CI 0.67, 2.08; p = 0.57) respectively.
Conversely, the use of knockdown sprays [52] (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.44, 2.86) or mosquito
coils [52,69] (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.09, 1.91; p = 0.01) was significantly associated with an
increased odds of dengue incidence.
Impact on vector indices
Impact on mosquito indices evaluated in cluster-randomized controlled trials
(CRCTs).
Cluster-randomized controlled trials with data suitable for inclusion in these -anal-
yses investigated: insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) [76, 77]; community-based combination
interventions such as waste disposal, clean up campaigns, formation of community working
groups, mobilization and education [73]; source reduction, larviciding, entomological surveil-
lance, communication, education and punitive fines [47]. Forest plots of analyses measuring
impacts on the BI, HI, CI and pupal indices are shown in Figs 4 and 5.
As shown in Fig 4, ITCs [76, 77] did not significantly reduce the pooled mean difference for
either BI, (-25.16; 95% CI -76.02, -25.70; p = 0.33), HI (-10.58; 95% CI -32.22, -11.05; p = 0.34),

 CI (-0.24; 95% CI -0.16, 0.25) or Pupal indices (-0.19; 95% CI -0.37, 0.75). Heterogeneity
between the studies was high, with I2 = 97% (p<0.0001) for outcomes BI and HI.
In Cuba, community-based combination interventions significantly impacted BI and HI
(Fig 5), with rate ratios of 0.48 (95% CI 0.26, 0.89) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.27, 0.89) in one study
[47], while another [83] found that routine interventions led by the community were signifi-
cantly more effective than routine interventions alone (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52, 0.81). Similarly,
in an ‘eco-health’ study in India [73], the mean difference was significantly reduced for all met-
rics: BI -4.66 (-5.89, -3.43), HI -17.10 (-22.16, -12.04) and CI -12.30 (-15.31, -9.29).
Impact on mosquito indices evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
One
study investigated the impact of covering productive larval development container types (S2
Fig). Water tank covers significantly reduced the number of tanks positive for immature stage
Ae. aegypti MD = -4.00 (95% CI -4.96, -3.04) [54], but an impact on dengue incidence was not
evaluated.
In quasi-experimental design, larviciding using the insect growth regulator Pyriproxyfen
delivered as part of a community-based strategy, was reported to have significantly reduced the
rate of dengue incidence in the intervention group: RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.12, 0.30) (S3 Fig) [80].

 Impact on mosquito indices evaluated in non-RCTs.
Although numerous studies evalu-
ated the impact of combinations of interventions on vector populations, it was not possible to
combine these into one forest plot, because of the wide range of study designs, outcomes or
outcome measures applied. Variously, the studies investigated: clean-up campaigns in conjunc-
tion with IRS and larviciding [46]; community-based environmental management (including
community-based environmental management, source reduction, larviciding, education, pro-
mote formation of CWGs, water covers) [48]; source reduction, larviciding and fogging [55];
nocturnal outdoor fogging [74]; the larval growth inhibitor pyriproxyfen, used alone [80] or in
combination with insecticide-treated water covers [82]; lethal ovitraps [81]; release of geneti-
cally modified mosquitoes (Release of Insects with Dominant Lethality, RIDL) [85].
Community-based environmental management significantly reduced the House Index:
MD = -2.14 (95% CI -3.72, -0.56) [48] (S4 Fig) and combination interventions (clean-up cam-
paigns in conjunction with IRS and larviciding) reduced ovitrap positivity MD = -10.30 (95%
CI -12.80, -7.80) [46] (S4 Fig). The use of fogging, source reduction and larviciding resulted in
lower odds of detecting increased larval densities (S5 Fig): Breteau Index OR = 0.15 (95% CI
0.10, 0.24) and House Index OR = 0.13 (95% CI 0.08, 0.22) when compared to baseline [55],
while the odds of the presence of immature stage Aedes were reduced in the intervention
group, through the combined use of Olyset net covers for waters jars and pyriproxyfen for a
period of 5 months (S2 Fig) [82]. Biogents Sentinel lethal ovitraps demonstrated potential in
reducing the number of circulating adult mosquitoes, although this result was modest and not
significant: MD 0.30 (95% CI -0.74, 0.13) (S6 Fig) [81].
Outdoor nocturnal ultra-low volume fogging significantly reduced numbers of adult Ae.
albopictus in the intervention group by -13.90 (95% CI -21.86, -5.94) (S4 Fig) but did not mea-
sure effects on immature stages [74]. Sampling was conducted using BioGents Sentinel Trap
and fogging was conducted between 3–5 times per annum; 43–90% mosquito control was
achieved.
In a seminal field study with genetically-modified mosquitoes in the Cayman islands, sched-
uled releases of sterile male mosquitoes reduced the odds of ovitrap positivity in intervention
clusters compared with control clusters: OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.07, 0.18) by [85] (S7 Fig).
Discussion
The dramatic growth in dengue over the past 35 years has been a remarkable epidemiological
event and, as evidenced by its continued global spread, a challenge for which the public
health community was not prepared. It is not surprising that 24 of the 41 studies included in
this review were published in the past 7 years, reflecting the increase in attention and
resources devoted to devising effective control strategies as recognition of the dengue pan-
demic grew. However, the fact that the global increase in focus on dengue control generated
so few studies performed at a standard required for inclusion in this review, indicates that
the magnitude of the response to the dengue pandemic has not been sufficient. Moreover,
most of these studies investigated the impact of interventions on dengue vector indices alone,
rather than dengue incidence. This also is discouraging, as the limitations of the Stegomyia
larval indices, primarily their poor correlation with dengue transmission, are well known
[86]. Finally, the inadequacy of the response to global dengue threat is demonstrated by the
identification of thirteen studies that measured the impact of vector control on dengue inci-
dence in the past 35 years, and that only six of these were suitable for inclusion in a meta-
analysis. Simply stated, we do not have a clear understanding of which of the currently avail-
able interventions actually work, where or when they succeed or might work best, and the
reasons why they succeed or fail.

 Nowhere is the inadequacy more apparent than in the absence of appropriately designed tri-
als to evaluate insecticide fogging or space-spraying for the prevention of dengue transmission.
Although space spraying is the standard public health response to a dengue outbreak world-
wide, and is recommended by WHO for this purpose [19], our study revealed the scant evi-
dence available from studies to evaluate this method sufficiently. Earlier reviews also noted this
serious omission from the literature published before 1980 [29,31]. Remarkably, no rando-
mised controlled trials have been undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of space-spraying or
fogging to reduce dengue transmission or dengue incidence, anywhere in the past 35 years. We
identified only one study [74] suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis that demonstrated a sig-
nificant impact of outdoor fogging on dengue vector populations.
Without adequate evidence, it is impossible to determine how effective space-spraying pro-
grams, whether indoor or outdoor, have been. It may be the case that outdoor fogging has the
potential to impact on dengue vector populations sufficiently to impact transmission, but the
minimum treatment frequency and geographic area requiring treatment remain unknown.
The most encouraging report comes from a recent longitudinal study analysing twelve years of
data from the city of Iquitos in Peru [84], which concluded that dengue cases could be reduced
if intensive city-wide space-spraying (outdoor fogging) was conducted early in the transmis-
sion season. Given the cost implications of delivering a similar scale treatment in an even larger
city, possibly with the need to do so in advance of an outbreak crisis, further studies to demon-
strate the potential benefits are essential.
Of those that could be assessed adequately, the method with the most evidence supporting
effectiveness in preventing dengue transmission was house screening. Data from cross-sec-
tional [52] and case-control studies [59] in Australia, and a case-control study in Taiwan (69)
were included in a meta-analysis that indicated a significant protective effect of window and
door screens on dengue transmission as detected by serology (ELISA or HIA (haemagglutina-
tion inhibition assay)) (Fig 3). Although the weaker study designs limited the power of this
result, the results are encouraging. Aedes aegypti exhibit predominantly indoor resting and
blood feeding behaviour (termed endophagic and endophilic behaviour, respectively)[87], and
barriers to access would be expected to impact on this species. Malaria vector mosquitoes and
other arthropods of medical importance are also active indoors and can be targeted in the same
way, increasing the likelihood of perception of benefit and adoption by householders. “Mos-
quito-proofing” houses was first considered over a century ago, and its potential as a sustain-
able and effective tool for malaria control has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in
recent years [88–90]. New investigations of screening for dengue prevention are also underway.
Recent studies in a high-risk dengue setting in Mexico reported that window and door screens
were a popular and widely-adopted intervention that significantly reduced domestic infesta-
tions of Aedes aegypti [91, 92]. House screening is not included in the current WHO dengue
guidelines, but given its potential and wide ranging benefits, it is a strong candidate for rando-
mised controlled trials to evaluate its effectiveness in preventing dengue.
Two observational studies reported on the impact of indoor residual spraying IRS, with con-
tradictory results and while one of these reported a positive significant reduction in the odds of
(secondary) incidence [66], the second study reported an insignificant increase [69]. Conse-
quently, the pooled odds ratio showed no statistically significant effect between intervention
and control groups. While indoor residual spraying can target Aedes aegypti, such methods
have rarely been used, nor are currently recommended [19, 93, 94]. Yet IRS is already used
widely to control a number of other vector-borne diseases in various settings worldwide and, as
it allows the delivery of a range of different insecticide classes, it can be an important tool for
managing insecticide resistance [95–98]. The possibility that existing IRS programs might be
expanded with minimal change to include dengue is an attractive prospect.

 Probably the most widespread practices to suppress dengue vector populations are clean-up
campaigns, typically community-driven and in tandem with education and health promotional
campaigns as well as numerous additional approaches. Efforts promoting environmental and
peri-domestic clean-up to reduce vector larval development sites have been routine practices in
many dengue-endemic localities for decades and as shown in Fig 2, they were the most com-
mon intervention evaluated in the reviewed studies. However, clean-up campaigns were evalu-
ated only as one element within multiple interventions or they continued to be promoted as a
background across all the arms within a study. Thus, source reduction or clean-up campaigns
were applied in some way in 20 studies but were associated with interventions ranging from
fogging or water container covers targeting adult mosquitoes to larviciding and copepods for
control of immatures (S3 Table). Hence it is not possible to dissect their specific contribution
to reducing vector populations or their impact on dengue transmission. Of these, the strongest
evidence (Fig 3) was from Cuba [58] where results indicated that community working groups
(CWGs), initially set up some years earlier, in a preceding study [71] promoting environmental
management, conversion of garbage zones into gardens, water pipe repairs and the use of water
container covers not only reduced vector indices, but also impacted dengue transmission, sig-
nificantly more than the routine A. aegypti control programme. Although WHO recommends
community participation as an essential element of sustainable dengue prevention [99], there
is little evidence that it can impact on dengue transmission [100]. A number of randomised
controlled studies have demonstrated significant impacts on vector indices [47, 48, 73, 83, 101]
(Fig 5) even though the methods of intervention varied considerably between the studies.
Results from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Nicaragua and Mexico [102] reported
reductions in dengue sero-conversion rates and self-reported dengue cases as well as vector
indices, following community mobilisation to deliver pesticide-free vector control. Clearly fur-
ther evidence is needed. It remains to be determined how best practice is defined in any setting
(i.e. which tools or methods the community should employ), and what coverage is necessary in
order to not simply reduce mosquito indices, but to impact on dengue virus transmission.
The use of fish and crustaceans as biological control agents that prey on or compete with
the immature vector stages may have potential in certain contexts, but we identified only three
studies that evaluated copepods (aquatic Crustaceans) [78, 79, 103]. In all cases, the crustaceans
were used together with clean-up programs, obscuring the impact of each method, and none of
the reports provided sufficient data to be included in a meta-analyses. Consistent with earlier
specific reviews [32, 34], there remains little evidence to suggest that biological control has
widespread potential.
A substantial number of reports demonstrated impacts on vector indices of insecticide-
treated materials (ITMs), deployed as window or door curtains [54, 75, 77, 82, 104, 105],
although they were effective only where houses with fewer and smaller windows and doors
[75–77, 104] and where coverage of the intervention was particularly high [77]. Hence, in the
meta-analyses, no significant impact on vector populations was indicated and the heterogeneity
between the studies was high (Fig 4). Effects on dengue incidence of ITMs used as vertical win-
dow or door screens or as horizontal covers for water containers, need to be quantified in loca-
tions and contexts where housing conditions indicate suitability. ITMs, used as curtains hung
or fixed tightly across external windows and doors, function in a similar way to mesh screens,
and potentially could provide enough protection without the need for insecticide, as suggested
by a study in Mexico, where ITMs reduced vector populations even though the targeted popu-
lation was highly resistant to the insecticide used [90].
There was no evidence of any impact on dengue infection risk by insecticide-treated bed
nets [52,69], mosquito traps [69, 81] or mosquito repellents [52]. Ongoing studies are investi-
gating a range of novel trap designs for Aedes spp. surveillance and control [106–108] but to

 date, evidence of traps preventing any mosquito-borne disease remains elusive. Both opinion
and evidence are weighed against the use of skin repellents for prevention of vector-borne dis-
eases [109], and attention has moved towards a new generation of spatial repellents, to be
deployed within or close to houses to prevent mosquito entry, possibly in combination with
attractant lethal traps in what is termed a ‘push-pull’ strategy [108, 110].
The significant negative associations found between the use of insecticide aerosols [52] and
mosquito coils [52,69] and higher odds of dengue incidence have a number of possible expla-
nations. These tools may have been purchased in response to an actual increase in mosquito
numbers, or a dengue case in the home or a neighbour’s house, during a period of dengue
transmission. Alternately, householders using aerosols or coils may have relied solely on these
anti-mosquito devices and not have adopted any other more effective preventative measures.
Approaches involving the use of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes or the intracellular
symbiont Wolbachia [111] are recent advances in insect control and only one field trial, dem-
onstrating impact on the vector population only [85], was included in this review. An increase
in the numbers of reports from ongoing new trials can be expected, although the use of GM
mosquitoes for dengue control will have to confront or overcome additional regulatory or ethi-
cal challenges and requirements prior to field tests and eventual deployment [112–116].
Regarding trials of methods that require the use of insecticides, we noted that while 23/41
studies examined the impact of insecticide-based tools, only 9 of these cited recent information
on insecticide resistance or referred to an evaluation of the susceptibility status of the target
vector population at any stage of the study. Resistance to DDT, pyrethroids and other insecti-
cides has been documented widely in dengue vectors, and continues to emerge, potentially
impacting on intervention effectiveness [40, 117–119]. Clearly, insecticide susceptibility testing
must be an integral part of any trial where insecticide-based interventions are under evaluation,
as recommended by the World Health Organisation [4].
Today, there is a widespread perception that Aedes aegypti control ‘has failed’ or that exist-
ing methods will not reduce dengue transmission, and that this is why we should abandon
existing approaches and invest in or pursue alternative strategies [111, 120, 121]. As we have
shown in this review and meta-analysis, this is incorrect. In reality, there is very little reliable
evidence from appropriately designed trials to reach a conclusion about any of the control
methods available. That this also applies to insecticide space-spraying or fogging illustrates
clearly the urgent need for such fundamental trials.
Care in designing studies is critical. Randomized controlled trials are the most robust design
for evaluating the effectiveness of any intervention [122]. In our review, only eight of the nine-
teen reports included in the meta-analysis (7 CRCTs, 1 RCT) were randomised, none of which
reported a significant impact on dengue incidence. In contrast, eight other studies that reported
a positive reduction in dengue incidence at p<0.05, were not derived from randomised con-
trolled trials, but from weaker experimental designs (see Fig 3). Weakness in the designs of tri-
als investigating vector control tools have been recognised, and expert guidance, identification
of challenges and pitfalls and clear recommendations for improvement are available [123,124].
Also apparent from this review is the large number of studies investigating impacts on the
vector population alone, with no measures of the effectiveness of the intervention on dengue
transmission. We recognise that detecting dengue viruses or confirming current, recent or his-
toric dengue infections are not simple routine or inexpensive tasks, requiring skills and equip-
ment that are not available without considerable investment. However, without this additional
investment, the value of many studies that are limited to evaluating impacts on the vector
alone is seriously reduced. Demonstration of impact on vector populations is achievable and
often reported but is no guarantee that an intervention will translate into a reduction in dengue
transmission [125, 126]. This is particularly true for dengue, where the complex relationship

 between vector abundance, virus transmission and human infection rates are far from clear
[86,127,128].
As well as their role in dengue transmission, Aedes aegypti is the main urban vector of yel-
low fever in Africa and South America, and this species and Aedes albopictus variously are vec-
tors of the Chikungunya and Zika viruses, two emerging human pathogens that constitute a
new global threat [129–132]. Despite the fears surrounding these threats, the urge to respond
must be tempered by reality, and based on sound evidence. In the large urban zones where
these vectors proliferate, to simply continue to use what has always been used, for that reason
alone, or to pursue new approaches without sound supporting evidence would be wrong, and
potentially a profligate waste of resources. Hence, there is an argument for instituting a global
independent advisory body to guide decisions regarding the selection of approaches and tools
for control or prevention of infections transmitted by urban Aedes sp. vector populations, and
the design of appropriate multi-centre trials to evaluate their effectiveness. With this in mind,
we hope that the findings of this review and meta-analysis will contribute to the sound evidence
base on which that approach would be founded.
