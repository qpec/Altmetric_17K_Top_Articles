ABSTRACT
Objective: Metformin, the first line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes, suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and reduces body weight in
patients, the latter by an unknown mechanism.
Methods: Mice on a high fat diet were continuously fed metformin in a therapeutically relevant dose, mimicking a retarded formulation.
Results: Feeding metformin in pharmacologically relevant doses to mice on a high fat diet normalized HbA1c levels and ameliorated glucose
tolerance, as expected, but also considerably slowed down weight gain. This was due to increased energy expenditure, since food intake was
unchanged and locomotor activity was even decreased. Metformin caused lactate accumulation in the intestinal wall and in portal venous blood
but not in peripheral blood or the liver. Increased conversion of glucose-1-13C to glucose-1,6-13C under metformin strongly supports a futile cycle
of lactic acid production in the intestinal wall, and usage of the produced lactate for gluconeogenesis in liver.
Conclusions: The reported glucoseelactateeglucose cycle is a highly energy consuming process, explaining the beneficial effects of metformin
given continuously on the development of a type 2 diabetic-like state in our mice.

1. INTRODUCTION
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common disorders
in industrialized countries, with rapidly increasing patient numbers in
the last decades; thus, its successful treatment in the setting of a
metabolic syndrome gets more and more important. According to the
2015 guidelines of the ADA (American Diabetes Association) and the
EASD (European Diabetes Association), lifestyle modification, i.e.
weight control and physical activity, in combination with metformin
(1,1-dimethylbiguanide) is the current first-line therapeutic concept for
T2DM patients [1,2]. Basically, metformin lowers elevated blood
glucose levels, and, with the successful treatment of hyperglycemia, it
results in a significantly reduced diabetes-related morbidity [3].
Beyond its glucose lowering effect, metformin-treatment results in
significant weight loss (summarized in recent large meta-analyses
[4,5]). Surprisingly, the mechanisms responsible for lowering body
weight are unknown, even though weight loss alone improves glucose
homeostasis in T2DM.
Although being introduced and available for clinical use since the
1950ies, metformin’s therapeutic mechanisms are still not under-
stood. One of the earliest possible modes of action, then identified for
alkylguanidines that are closely related to the biguanidine metformin,
was inhibition of oxygen consumption in liver mitochondria [6]. Later, it

 concentrations specifically inhibits complex I of the respiratory chain
and reduces gluconeogenesis, probably by inhibiting pyruvate
carboxylase inside mitochondria, a rate limiting enzyme of this process
which is sensitive to the cellular energy as well as the redox state [7,8].
Stimulated by the finding that the ATP/ADP ratio was lowered by
metformin in liver, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was
subsequently shown to be activated by metformin in isolated hepa-
tocytes [9]. However, later it was shown that in mice lacking both
isoforms of the AMPKa subunit as well as the upstream kinase LKB1,
the hypoglycemic effect of the drug was still maintained [10,11]. Since
then, new alternative mechanisms explaining how metformin may
inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis have been proposed, e.g. suppression
of glucagon signaling by interfering with cAMP production [12], altering
the hepatic redox state by direct inhibition of mitochondrial glycer-
ophosphate dehydrogenase [13] as well as activation of a neurohu-
moral gutebraineliver axis [14].
Most studies still concentrate on the liver as the main target of met-
formin, arguing that this organ plays the key-role in gluconeogenesis
and that intracellular drug concentrations will reach high levels after
orally administered metformin is absorbed by the intestine [15]. It was
previously shown that an important mode-of-action of the drug is to
improve lipid homeostasis by stimulating the AMPK mediated phos-
phorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylases, which consequently improves
insulin sensitivity [16]. Although elegant, it is important to note that the
drug was applied by intraperitoneal injection, thus bypassing the
physiological route of orally taken metformin.
However, after oral administration, the highest concentration of met-
formin is not found in the liver but in the intestinal epithelium [17e19].
Early data using obese fa/fa rats already showed that metformin
administration significantly increased glucose consumption in the in-
testine [20] due to mitochondrial inhibition, which was confirmed later
demonstrating increased lactate production in isolated human jejunal
preparations [19].
Here, we continuously fed metformin in a therapeutically relevant dose,
mimicking a retarded formulation, to mice on a high fat diet in order to
investigate how the drug slows down the development of T2DM, but
most importantly, how it slows down weight gain, the other well
described mode of action in patients.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Animals and experimental protocols
Animals (male C57BL6/J mice) were housed in a 12 h light-dark circle
(06:00 on, 18:00 off, including a period of dawn) at constant tem-
perature of 22 �C and a humidity of 60 rH.
Controls received standard chow (Altromin Spezialfutter, Lage, Ger-
many, #TPF-1314: 5% fat, 4.8% disaccharide, 23% protein). HFD
treated mice were fed a high fat, high sucrose diet (HFD; Altromin
Spezialfutter, Lage, Germany, #105712: 35% fat, 19% disaccharide,
19% protein). HFD þ Met and HFD þ lateMet received the same HFD
supplemented with 0,5% of metformin (1,1-Dimethylbiguanide Hy-
drochloride, 97%, Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany, #D150959).
Metformin was added to the diet during the manufacturing process to
assure equal distribution over the HFD. Mice had access to chow and
water ad libitum unless otherwise specified.
A detailed description about the different cohorts of mice used in this
study can be found in the supplementary experimental procedures. All
animal procedures were performed in accordance with the German
Laws for Animal Protection and were approved by the local animal care
committee (Landesamt für Natur-, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz,
LANUV, Recklinghausen, Germany; Az 37.09.298).
2.2. Metabolic characterization and glucose tolerance test
Mice were weighed every two weeks, starting at 6 weeks of age.
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed every 2
weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age, after 16 h of fasting by an
intraperitoneal injection of 2 g/kg glucose (Supplementary Figure 1).
Glucose was measured in tail venous blood at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min
after injection (Glucomen LX, Berlin-Chemie, Berlin, Germany).
2.3. Indirect calorimetry and physical activity measurement
At the age of 6 weeks, this cohort of animals was divided into two
groups and fed HFD þ Met or HFD (n ¼ 16 each) for 12 weeks. At the
age of 18 weeks, mice were kept for 48 h (starting at 10 am) in an
open circuit measurement system (PhenoMaster, TSE Systems GmbH,
Bad Homburg, Germany) after having been acquainted to the new
environment. Light phase was from 7:30 PM until 6:30 AM. The
following parameters were obtained: CO2 production, O2 consumption,
home cage activity, food intake, water intake and feeding events, and
values for energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER;
CO2
production/O2
consumption)
were
derived
from
these
measurements.
2.4. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and integrity of the
intestinal mucosa in the presence of metformin
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation; the small intestine (du-
odenum) was removed and immediately cooled on a metal plate kept
on ice to slow down self-digestion as much as possible. Samples from
the duodenum were immersed in Tissue Tek (O.C.T.� Compound e
Sakura Finetek, Staufen, Germany), immediately frozen in liquid ni-
trogen, and sectioned using a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica Micro-
systems, Wetzlar, Germany) at �20 �C. In order to quantitate NADH
dehydrogenase (Complex I) activity, the following method was used
(Diaphorase activity, modified from [21]: directly after preparation, 2e
3 mm sections were incubated in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, 4 mM NADH,
0.1 M TriseHCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM nitroblue tetrazolium chloride for
10 min at room temperature. Sections were then briefly rinsed with
distilled water, dried, and mounted in aqueous medium. Sections
incubated without NADH were used as controls. Before, it was
established that after 10 min, staining had not reached maximal in-
tensity, thus allowing determination of Complex I activity in situ in
different samples processed in a highly parallel way. Images were
taken at 20� or 40� magnification using an Olympus BX-40 micro-
scope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) and staining intensity was
analyzed using a thresholding tool-based method (Using ImageJ [22],
and the image processing package Fiji for Image J [23,24].). The
thresholding tool settings were established in samples from HFD mice
and used for quantification of all samples. The ratio of staining-positive
to total area of 2e4 samples of the duodenum from HFD and
HFD þ Met mice (n ¼ 2) were determined.
Staining procedures for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and PCNA (Proliferating
cell nuclear antigen) are described in the supplementary experimental
procedures.
2.5. Quantitation of glucose, lactate, and metformin by LC-MS/MS
Mice were fed with HFD or HFD þ Met lacking disaccharides, that was
supplemented with 1 g of glucose-1-13C (# 297046; Sigma Aldrich,
Darmstadt, Germany) per 10 g of food. After 3 h, cheek punch blood
samples of variable size were collected directly in 100 ml acetonitrile
and diluted 1:10 with acetonitrile; serum samples generated from
ventricular cavity blood were diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with acetonitrile. Of
these, 10 or 20 ml were analyzed on a triple quadrupole mass spec-
trometer (4000 QTRAP, AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany). The following

ionization with positive or negative electrospray was used. The
following fragments were chosen for selected reaction monitoring (m/z
parent, m/z fragment, collision energy (V; minus indicates negative ion
detection)): glucose, 179, 89, �10; glucose-1-13C, 180, 90, �12;

90, 44, �13; metformin, 130, 60, 19; methionine, 150, 133, 15. For
each analyte, the peak area was obtained from integrating intensity
above background vs. time in the proper elution time interval. Methi-
onine was chosen to normalize the cheek punch data because here the
Figure 1: Metformin slowed down the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice upon a high-fat diet and increased energy expenditure. (A þ B) Compared to
mice fed with high fat diet (HFD; n ¼ 8), metformin (Met) treatment significantly slowed down weight gain in mice fed with high fat diet and treated with metformin starting at the
same time (HFD þ Met; n ¼ 11; p < 0.01) and HFD mice treated with metformin after already developing glucose intolerance (HFD þ lateMet; n ¼ 8; p < 0.01) mice. Control
mice (n ¼ 11) received standard chow and their weight gain was considered as normal (p < 0.01 vs. HFD and HFD þ lateMet, respectively). (C þ D) Indirect calorimetry and
physical activity measurements after 12 weeks of treatment showed that (C) energy expenditure was persistently higher in HFD þ Met (n ¼ 16) mice, whereas (D) their locomotor
activity was significantly lower during dark phases compared to HFD mice (n ¼ 16). For statistical analysis of energy expenditure and activity, see Supplementary Figure S2. (E)
Results of glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) at 18 weeks treatment are shown as areas under the curve. There were no differences in glucose tolerance between control (n ¼ 10) and
HFD þ Met (n ¼ 11) mice (p ¼ n.s.). Glucose tolerance of HFD (n ¼ 7) and HFD þ lateMet (n ¼ 8) was significantly higher compared to control mice (p < 0.05). (F) Compared to
HFD (n ¼ 7) mice, glycemic control, judged by glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, was significantly improved in control (p < 0.05; n ¼ 9), HFD þ Met (p < 0.01; n ¼ 9) and
HFD þ lateMet (p < 0.05; n ¼ 8) mice. There were no differences between HFD þ Met, HFD þ lateMet and control mice (p ¼ n.s.). Data are expressed as mean � SD; for clarity,
SDs are not shown in Figure 1 (C) and (D). n indicates the number of analyzed mice or of individual mice from which blood was collected and analyzed. Differences between groups

 peak area followed dilution steps best. However, similar results were
obtained with leucine, phenylalanine, and valine. Serum data were not
normalized.
2.6. Further experimental procedures
Procedures describing immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and determination of
energy content of feces are described in detail in the supplementary
experimental procedures. In short, pACC/ACC ratios and quantifica-
tion of Ucp1 expression in BAT and WAT were determined by immu-
noblotting of proteins from liver samples after 12 weeks of treatment.
Expression of monocarboxylate transporters and lactate dehydroge-
nase isoforms were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Analysis of the energy
content of feces was performed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FT/IR)
reflectometry and following bomb calorimetry.
2.7. Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means � S.D. Areas under the curve (AUC)
were calculated using the trapezoidal method [25]. Differences be-
tween groups were analyzed by Student’s t-test or 1-way ANOVA,
followed by Bonferroni correction, as appropriate (see Figure legends).
Statistical significance of post-hoc analyses was accepted at p < 0.05.
Calculations were performed using SPSS21 (IBM Deutschland,
Ehningen, Germany).
3. RESULTS
3.1. Continuous metformin application slows down body weight
gain
Based on an extended pre-experiment, four groups were established
(Supplementary Figure 1). In one group, metformin was given to mice
that had already developed glucose intolerance (HFD þ lateMet); the
other group was treated together with the onset of HFD feeding
(HFD þ Met). Considering the food intake of our mice (about
0.08 g g�1 body weight per day of the HFD þ 0,5% metformin diet),
daily metformin intake was about 500 mg kg�1 per day, which equates
to a human equivalent dose (HED) [26] of about 40 mg metformin kg�1
per day. Extrapolated to the average patient’s weight, this dose is in the
same range as the maximum dose of metformin given to humans
(3 � 1000 mg per day) [27].
Weight development of the four groups is shown in Figure 1A. For
better illustration and quantitation, we compared the increase of
weight between 6 and 18 weeks (Figure 1B). While the HFD group
gained 9.6 g, metformin considerably reduced weight gain, with only
5.8 g weight gain in the HFD þ lateMet group and even only 3.6 g in
the HFD þ Met group (p < 0.01 vs. HFD, respectively).
3.2. Continuous metformin application increases energy
expenditure
In order to find out how metformin treatment results in reduced weight
gain, which is probably equivalent to weight loss in patients starting
treatment and equivalent to improved maintenance of weight during
treatment [28,29], whole body metabolism was analyzed at the age of
18 weeks, after 12 weeks of HFD vs. HFD þ Met. Reduced weight gain
cannot be explained by decreased food intake, since this was similar in
both groups, even though mice consuming metformin weighed less
(HFD: 0.08 � 0.03 g/day � g body weight vs. HFD þ Met:
0.09 � 0.02 g/day � g body weight; p ¼ 0.29; Supplementary
Figure 2A). However, energy expenditure of the HFD þ Met mice
was significantly higher, no matter if calculated from data for the entire
48 h period (Figure 1C; HFD: 21.1 � 4.0 kcal/h � kg body weight vs.
HFD þ Met: 22.5 � 4.9 kcal/h � kg body weight; p < 0.001) or by
separating it into light and dark phases (Supplementary Figure 2B).
Food, and thus also metformin, was consumed mostly during the dark
phase (HFD: 18.13 � 2.97 vs. HFD þ Met: 19.13 � 2.42 feeding
events; p ¼ n.s.), but also quite regularly during the light phase (HFD:
9.5 � 3.3 vs. HFD þ Met: 8.75 � 2.3 feeding events; p ¼ n.s.). Higher
energy expenditure cannot be explained by increased locomotor ac-
tivity, since HFD þ Met mice were even less active (Figure 1D; HFD:
1524 � 2182 counts/30 min vs. HFD þ Met: 812 � 688 counts;
p < 0.001), mainly caused by a higher activity of the HFD group during
the dark phase (Supplementary Figure 2C).
Also the respiratory exchange ratio (RER: CO2 production vs. O2 con-
sumption) was slightly higher in the HFD þ Met group (HFD:
0.821 � 0.03 vs. HFD þ Met: 0.826 � 0.03; p < 0.001). When the
light and dark phases were analyzed separately, the higher RER of the
HFD þ Met group was only seen in the dark phase, when animals are
active and consume most of the food together with metformin
(Supplementary Figure 2D). Water intake was significantly increased in
the HFD þ Met group with 0.11 � 0.03 ml/day � g body weight vs.
0.08 � 0.03 ml/day � g body weight in the HFD group (p < 0.01).
Since both groups had the same food intake, we asked if the reduction
of weight gain might be a result of malabsorption due to an acute effect
of metformin on mitochondrial performance in the intestinal transport
epithelium. However, no significant differences were observed in en-
ergy content of feces between groups (HFD: 19.35 � 1.04 kJ/g dry
weight vs. HFD þ Met: 19.96 � 0.52, p ¼ 0.23). We also measured
total feces production, but found no differences (data not shown).
3.3. Continuous metformin application improves glycemic control
and lipid metabolism
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) were performed in all
groups every two weeks starting at 12 weeks, i.e. 6 weeks after onset
of HFD, and blood glucose values during the GTTs done are shown in
Supplementary Figure 3. Glucose tolerance was impaired in the HFD
groups starting at 14 weeks, resulting in higher glucose levels at each
time point compared to normal chow controls. After 18 weeks, glucose
tolerance was not different from controls in the HFD þ Met group,
shown as areas under the curve (Figure 1E). Fasted glucose levels
were significantly, but only moderately elevated in the HFD groups
(Supplementary Table 1) confirming our previous finding that it takes
about 6 months to develop severe T2DM using C57BL6/J mice and this
food composition [30].
Metformin did not ameliorate fasting hyperglycemia compared to the
HFD group (Supplementary Table 1), probably also because the ani-
mals had not ingested the drug for 16 h before blood sampling, and the
effects on glucose tolerance seemed rather moderate. However in
humans suffering from T2DM, the level of HbA1c is a much more
reliable parameter for the long-term follow up of glycemic control [31].
Indeed, HFD significantly increased HbA1c levels, while both metfor-
min treatment schemes completely normalized them, recapitulating its
well established effect on glycemic control in humans (Figure 1F and
Supplementary Table 1).
Significantly higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were seen in
the HFD groups compared to controls (Supplementary Table 1), but this
was not diminished by metformin treatment. However, HDL levels were
significantly higher (176 � 5 vs. 137 � 26 mg/dl, p < 0.01), LDL
levels were similar (26 � 4 vs. 23 � 7 mg/dl, p ¼ 0.4) and VLDL/LDL
was significantly lower (0.26 � 0.04 vs. 0.35 � 0.07, p < 0.05) in
HFD þ Met treated animals compared to HFD.
In summary, in mice upon a high fat diet, feeding metformin slows
down the development of a type 2 diabetes-like phenotype with pro-
found effects on obesity and long-term glycemic control.

 3.4. No activation of brown adipose tissue
The increase of energy expenditure could be due to recruitment by
metformin of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or of beige fat cells [32] in
white adipose tissue depots (WAT). Both would be characterized by
increased levels of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) as well as subunits of
the mitochondrial respiratory chain [33], here analyzed by the repre-
sentative core subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase (CoxIV). However, no
differences were found for Cox IV, neither in BAT nor in WAT, and levels
of Ucp1 were unchanged in BAT, while it was not detectable at all in
WAT (Supplementary Figure 4).
3.5. Evidence for a futile glucoseelactateeglucose cycle
Metformin has been shown to inhibit complex I of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain in hepatocytes in high concentrations (100 mM up to
10 mM; [8]). In general, cells increase lactate production from glucose
when mitochondrial ATP production is insufficient or inhibited and
indeed, lactate levels rose in the intestinal wall, but not in liver, of mice
which had been fed a HFD with metformin for 24 h (Figure 2A).
Moreover, in blood taken from the portal vein of these mice, we found a
significant increase in lactate and a significant drop of pH as well as of
actual base excess (ABE), respectively (Table 1), clearly showing that
metformin indeed causes lactic acid production in the intestinal wall,
from which it is rapidly removed due to its high perfusion rate. In
contrast, neither an increase in lactate nor evidence for acidosis was
found in blood taken from the facial or tail vein, respectively
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), indicating that lactic acid released
into the portal circulation does not leave the enterohepatic vascular bed
and therefore does not reach the general circulation.
Since our results show that metformin indeed acts as a mitochondrial
inhibitor in the wall of the small intestine, we stained samples of the
duodenum for NADH-“diaphorase” activity, which is due to mito-
chondrial complex I activity in cells rich in mitochondria. This
demonstrated the high abundance of this complex in the intestinal
epithelium, both apical as well as basal (Figure 3A), and showed that
complex I activity was about 3 fold lower in metformin consuming mice
(Figure 3B). Staining for proliferating cells (PCNA; Figure 3C) and with
H&E (Figure 3D) showed no difference, demonstrating that metformin
does not cause any tissue damage at the administered dose.
Our results thus strongly suggest conversion of glucose to lactate in the
wall of the small intestine in the presence of metformin due to complex
I inhibition and the conversion of lactate back to glucose in the liver.
Indeed, glycogen levels were considerably lower in livers of mice after
12 weeks of HFD þ Met, further corroborating this hypothesis (control:
355 � 55; HFD: 301 � 29 vs. HFD þ Met: 137 � 39 mMol glycosyl
units/g wet weight, p < 0.01 vs. HFD and vs. control, respectively).
In order to demonstrate this pathway directly, mice were given labeled
glucose-1-13C in HFD. Since the natural abundance of the 13C-isotope
is only 1.1%, no doubly labeled glucose-1,6-13C was detected in the
blood samples before the experiment (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure 6). After 3 h of feeding, newly generated, doubly labeled
Figure 2: Modifications of the lactate metabolism in the splanchnic bed in response to metformin treatment. (A) After 24 h, lactate levels were not different in chyme and
liver of mice fed with high fat diet and treated with metformin (HFD þ Met; n ¼ 6) and HFD mice (HFD; n ¼ 6; p ¼ n.s.). Lactate levels were significantly higher in the intestinal
wall (small intestine and colon, cleared from chyme) of HFD þ Met compared to HFD mice (p < 0.05). (B) After 3 weeks of treatment, RT-qPCR results showed significantly
reduced expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (Mct-1), a transporter specialized for lactate import, in heart (p < 0.05), muscle (p < 0.01), and liver (p < 0.01) and a trend
for increased expression in the intestinal wall (p ¼ n.s.) of HFD þ Met (n ¼ 5) compared to HFD (n ¼ 6) mice. (C) Lactate levels were clearly reduced in chyme (p ¼ 0.054),

 glucose-1,6-13C was nearly two-fold higher in the presence of met-
formin compared to controls (Figure 4A,B). Glucose-13C, lactate-13C,
unlabeled glucose, and lactate were not significantly altered in pe-
ripheral blood (Figure 4C,D).
To even further support our findings (Figure 6), the expression of the
monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 as well as lactate dehydroge-
nase isoforms was analyzed by RT-qPCR in mice after 3 weeks of HFD,
i.e. when we expected that processes adaptive to the constant release
of lactate from the intestine had been fully initiated. In liver, heart and
muscle, expression of the monocarboxylate transporter Mct-1
(Slc16a1), which is specialized for lactate import, was significantly
decreased (Figure 2B), while there was a trend for increased
expression in the intestinal wall, in line with improved extraction of
lactate from the chyme at that later stage (Figure 2C). In addition, the
ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) isoforms Ldha/Ldhb was
increased in the intestinal wall, favoring the conversion of pyruvate to
lactate, while it was decreased in the liver, favoring the opposite re-
action (Figure 2D). Indeed, liver tissue showed significantly lower
levels of lactate at this stage (Figure 2C).
Our results seem to be in conflict with a large body of literature
showing inhibition of hepatic glucose production by metformin,
although in the long term, we also found a significant improvement of
glycemic control (Figure 1E). Therefore, we analyzed phosphorylation
of ACC at Ser 79, a well-known readout of metformin action in liver, in
mice after 12 weeks of treatment, but found no significant changes
compared to controls (Figure 5A). However, applying metformin at a
single high dose by gavage indeed led to increased ACC phosphory-
lation (Figure 5B), as shown by others who used daily i.p. injections or
gavage [16,34]. This demonstrates that at our feeding conditions,
metformin obviously did not reach the liver in concentrations high
enough to activate ACC phosphorylation and other downstream path-
ways. In order to substantiate this, metformin concentrations were
analyzed and found to be 13 � 5, 40 � 13 and 37 � 27 mmol/L after
feeding HFD with 0.5%, 1% and 2.5% metformin, respectively. Thus,
our feeding regime with 0.5% metformin resulted in levels which are in
the lower range of concentrations reached by others in animals and
humans (10e40 mmol/L) [34].
4. DISCUSSION
Numbers of prescriptions of metformin grew constantly in the last 20
years and it is now estimated to be given to at least 150 million people
suffering from T2DM worldwide [34]. Since high blood glucose causes
the most severe complications in T2DM, researchers interested in
understanding its mode of action mostly concentrated on the sup-
pression of glucose production in the liver, which certainly occurs
in vivo in patients upon treatment [35].
In contrast, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the mechanisms
responsible for lowering body weight upon or maintaining body weight
during metformin treatment [4,5,28,29,35e37]. This effect cannot be
explained by metformin’s suppressive effect on hepatic glucose output,
since gluconeogenesis is an energy consuming process; thus, met-
formin should decrease energy expenditure and therefore increase
body weight. However, weight loss alone is a powerful means to
improve glucose homeostasis in T2DM; therefore, we felt that deci-
phering the responsible mechanism also deserves attention. Indeed, in
our study metformin not only slowed down the development of a type 2
diabetes-like phenotype with disruption of glycemic control and dysli-
pidemia, as expected, it also significantly slowed down weight gain. We
first excluded the most trivial reasons like decreased food intake due to
metformin’s bitter taste, increased locomotion due to enhanced
foraging activity, or malabsorption due to inhibition of active transport
processes in the intestine. We also excluded activation of BAT or
recruitment of beige adipocytes in WAT, respectively.
Instead, the slower weight gain can be explained by the marked in-
crease in energy expenditure we found after metformin treatment. We
reasoned that metformin is an inhibitor of complex I of the respiratory
chain, at least at high concentrations [7,38], which are certainly
reached in the intestine after oral administration [18]. It has been
reported before that metformin causes increased conversion of
glucose to lactate in the intestinal wall, when given as single bolus at a
dose about five times higher than the maximum daily dose given to
patients ([39], summarized in [19]). This treatment did not cause
malabsorption of glucose, but the local lactic acidosis may explain the
gastrointestinal disturbances reported for about 20e30% of patients
taking metformin [11,40,41], some of which can even be associated
with polymorphisms of putative metformin transporters [41]. Indeed,
we found inhibition of complex I in the intestinal epithelium, followed
by increased lactate levels and accompanied by a drop in pH in portal
vein blood, but not in peripheral venous blood, and therefore conclude
that lactic acid is converted back to glucose in the liver (Figure 6). Most
convincingly, we demonstrate that circulating levels of doubly labeled
glucose-1,6-13C were twice as high in the presence of metformin after
oral administration of glucose-1-13C (Figure 4A,B). Breakdown of
glucose-1-13C will yield one molecule of lactate-3-13C, which can be
converted in the aldolase reaction into doubly-labeled glucose-1,6-13C,
when by chance two labeled lactate-3-13C molecules are used for
gluconeogenesis (Figure 6). Since more lactate-3-13C is generated in
the intestinal wall in the presence of metformin (Figure 2A) and
released into the portal vein (Table 1), it is more likely that doubly
labeled glucose-1,6-13C molecules are generated in the liver.
Eventually, this process consumes 6 mol of ATP, when 1 mol of
glucose is produced from 2 mol of lactate [42], which had generated
2 mol of ATP in the intestinal wall when derived from glucose, either
taken from the lumen or from blood. We propose that this futile cycle,

 together with energy consuming mechanisms maintaining pH-
homeostasis, largely explains the increased energy expenditure and,
consequently, the reduced weight gain of metformin treated mice
under a high fat diet.
Indeed, liver glycogen content was significantly lower after metformin
treatment, since additional resources are needed in the liver to support
the energy consuming glucose production (Figure 6, dotted line). In
addition, our model is reinforced by the observation that after 3 weeks,
several adaptive processes have occurred. In the intestinal chyme, the
level of lactate was significantly lower in the metformin treated group,
showing that the capacity to extract lactate from chyme has increased
(Figure 2C), probably by augmented expression of the responsible
inward transporter Mct-1 ([43]; Figure 2B; although not significant),
and by a change in the ratio of Ldh isoforms [44] favoring production of
lactate from pyruvate derived from absorbed or also blood-born
glucose (Figure 2D). Other metabolic organs have down-regulated
Mct-1 (Figure 2B), probably as a protection against inflow of lactate
together with the accompanying proton. This may help to avoid
intracellular acidosis in these organs when intestinal levels of met-
formin are high and lactic acid does appear in the periphery. In liver,
the ratio of Ldh isoforms has changed favoring production of pyruvate
from lactate (Figure 2D) as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Additional
data supporting our model are an increased respiratory exchange ratio
(RER) during the dark phase, when animals consume most of the drug
(Supplementary Figure 3D), which is a well-established indicator of
lactic acidosis, and a significantly increased water intake under met-
formin, which may be due to increased water loss by hyperventilation
as a compensation for lactic acidosis.
Although we saw long-term improvement of glycemic control, based
on HbA1c measurements and GTTs, we did not observe lower blood
glucose in the fasted state, indicating that metformin did not impor-
tantly suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis in our mice. This seems to
contradict an immense body of literature, both in patients [35] as well
as in mice [12,13]. However, since phosphorylation of ACC was un-
changed (Figure 5A), we conclude that under the conditions of our
experiment, metformin did not reach the liver in concentrations high
enough to induce this downstream effect well described in previous
studies. Indeed, 13 � 5 mmol/L metformin which we obtained in
peripheral blood with our feeding regime of 0.5% metformin is in the
lowest range of concentrations reached by bolus administration in
animals and humans reported by others [34]. When we administered
the daily dose of metformin by gavage, as done by others, we also
found increased ACC phosphorylation (Figure 5B), emphasizing that
hepatic metformin action is highly dose dependent, as discussed
recently [34]. Patients take metformin (500e1000 mg) two or three
times a day together with meals [39], and mice, in which phosphor-
ylation of ACC has been shown in liver, are routinely given the drug by
bolus gavage (15e500 mg/kg [12,45,46]) or daily i.p. injection
(150 mg kg�1 [16]). In contrast, our mice consume 500 mg kg�1
distributed over 24 h, mostly, but not exclusively, during the night, thus
other mechanisms due to different kinetics had to be expected.
Metformin has been shown to activate anaerobic glycolysis in isolated
intestinal preparations already at concentrations of 10 mM [47],
probably due to the efficient translocation into enterocytes mediated by
the apical transporters PMAT (SLC29A4) and SERT (SLC6A4) [48,49],
but concentrations of 100 mM to even 10 mM have to be used in

 hepatocytes to inhibit mitochondrial respiration there [38]. This is
much higher than therapeutic concentrations and was definitely not
reached in our setting.
Therefore, we propose that the energy-consuming, futile glucosee
lactateeglucose cycle, for which we have provided strong evidence
here, will also operate in patients as long as the metformin concen-
tration in the intestinal epithelium is high and low in the liver. Lactic
acidosis remains mostly confined to the enterohepatic circulation, but
may also affect other organs, which can be compensated by adaptive
processes, e.g. changes of Mct-1 and Ldh isoform expression, as
shown here in mice. The very rare cases in which patients experience
systemic lactic acidosis are due to exceptionally high levels of met-
formin, e.g. because of inadequate excretion in patients with renal
dysfunction [50,51] or polymorphisms in the organic cation trans-
porters responsible for its route [41].
In patients taking their daily metformin dose, we propose two
consecutive steps, as metformin will be first transported into the in-
testinal epithelium, which serves as a sink and where it inhibits the
mitochondrial respiratory chain. It has been clearly shown that the drug
is only slowly released into the portal vein [39], where it will inhibit
gluconeogenesis in the liver only if concentrations are sufficiently high,
which seems certainly to be the case in patients under normal treat-
ment regimens [35]. Formulations of metformin with retarded release
are already available on the market, and these may be adjusted to
contain even higher concentrations in order to effectively drive both
effects, increased energy expenditure due to the futile cycle described
here as well as inhibition of gluconeogenesis, which will both
ameliorate type 2 diabetes. Indeed, our work is strongly supported by a
recent paper showing in large patient cohorts that even the glucose
lowering effect of the drug may reside in the gut if given as a delayed-
release formulation (MetDR) [52]. To what extent the recently
described effects of metformin on the composition of the gut micro-
biota contributes to our findings is unclear. However, it has been re-
ported that in patients taking metformin, that there is a shift to

of ACC at Ser79 in liver. (A) After 12 weeks of treatment, phosphorylation of acetyl-
CoA carboxylase at Ser79 (p-ACC) was not different in livers of mice fed with high fat
diet and treated with 500 mg metformin kg�1 per day (HFD þ Met), HFD mice (HFD)
and control animals. Expression of unphosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was
comparable between all three groups. (B) However, 3 h after giving 500 mg metformin
kg�1 in one bolus by gavage to mice (Met), phosphorylation of ACC at Ser79 was
clearly induced in livers compared to livers from non-treated control mice. Expression
of ACC was comparable between both groups.
