The Volume Of TV Advertisements
During The ACA’s First Enrollment
Period Was Associated With
Increased Insurance Coverage
ABSTRACT The launch of the Affordable Care Act was accompanied by
major insurance information campaigns by government, nonprofit,
political, news media, and private-sector organizations, but it is not clear
to what extent these efforts were associated with insurance gains. Using
county-level data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
and broadcast television airings data from the Wesleyan Media Project,
we examined the relationship between insurance advertisements and
county-level health insurance changes between 2013 and 2014, adjusting
for other media and county- and state-level characteristics. We found that
counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements
during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in
their uninsurance rates than other counties. State-sponsored
advertisements had the strongest relationship with declines in
uninsurance, and this relationship was driven by increases in Medicaid
enrollment. These results support the importance of strategic investment
in advertising to increase uptake of health insurance but suggest that not
all types of advertisements will have the same effect on the public.
T
he Affordable Care Act (ACA) estab-
lished state-based and federal in-
surance Marketplaces and expand-
ed Medicaid intwenty-four states in
2014. Estimates indicate that more
than 8.0 million people selected coverage from a
Marketplace and that 4.8 million enrolled in
Medicaid during the first open enrollment peri-
od from October 1, 2013, through March 31,
2014.1,2 The introduction of new insurance op-
tions was accompanied by massive media mar-
keting campaigns from federal and state govern-
ments, nonprofit organizations, and insurance
companies selling products to potential health
plan enrollees. These marketing campaigns
aimed to inform consumers about the existence
of these new Marketplaces and insurance prod-
ucts. During the same time period, political
campaign advertisements provided information
about the ACA—albeit with specific political
perspectives—in high volumes in many areas
of the country.3 Almost 1,000 distinct insurance
advertisements were aired more than 605,000
times on local and national broadcasting, while
255 unique ACA-related political advertisements
were aired almost 85,000 times during the six
months of the first open enrollment period.4 In
addition to the high levels of insurance product
advertisements and political advertisements air-
ing during the first open enrollment period, a
high volume of news media coverage also de-
scribed the insurance Marketplaces and prod-
ucts available under the ACA to the American
public. Local television news constitutes the
dominant information source for Americans,5
and research indicates that there were high vol-
umes of ACA coverage on local television news
during this period.6

 It is well known that media messages, includ-
ing news coverage and advertising, can generally
influence the public’s attitudes and behaviors,7
and emerging evidence indicates that media
shaped the public’s attitudes during ACA imple-
mentation.8 However, the influence of ACA-relat-
ed media on health plan enrollment in the new
Marketplaces created by the ACA is unknown.
There has been very limited prior research ex-
ploring this question, although one study did
show a relationship between Medicaid enroll-
ment and television advertising of a toll-free
hotline for enrollment assistance.9 Based on this
research and our theoretical expectations, we
anticipated that higher volumes of media mes-
sages during the first open enrollment period
would be related to higher health insurance en-
rollment, since increased media exposure would
heighten the public’s awareness of their choices.
This study examined the relationship between
broadcast health insurance advertisements and
the changing uninsurance rate among individu-
als younger than age sixty-five between 2013
and 2014, adjusting for other contemporaneous
ACA-related media messaging and market-level
demographic factors.
Study Data And Methods
Outcome Variables: Uninsurance And Medic-
aid Enrollment Rates We extracted county-
level data on uninsurance and Medicaid enroll-
ment rates for people younger than age sixty-five
from the Census Bureau’s American Community
Survey (ACS) one-year estimates in 2013 and
2014. Because ACS one-year data are available
only for areas with populations of 65,000 resi-
dents or more, only 700 counties had measured
county-level uninsurance rates in 2013 and only
712 in 2014. Consequently, between the two
years there were 629 counties in which we were
able to evaluate changes in the percentages of
people who were uninsured and who were en-
rolled in Medicaid between 2013 and 2014.
Key Explanatory Variables: Media Volume
We constructed three key measures of media
volume at the Nielsen Designated Market Area
(DMA) level for the first open enrollment period:
insurance advertisements (both the total and
broken down by sponsor type: private, state, fed-
eral, other); news attention to the ACA as mea-
sured by ACA-related keyword “hits” of closed-
captionsearches fromtelevision newsprograms;
and political advertisements that referenced the
ACA negatively. A DMA is a geographic region
within which the population can view the same
television content, and each is composed of
counties (counties do not span more than one
DMA). Our sample included 185 DMAs. There
are 210 DMAs in the United States.
▸ INSURANCE ADVERTISEMENTS: We obtained
data on the volume of health insurance product
advertisements from Kantar Media/Campaign
Media Analysis Group through the Wesleyan
Media Project. This category included all adver-
tisements from health insurers promoting their
products as well as advertisements from the De-
partment of Health and Human Services, state
Marketplaces, and other groups and organiza-
tions encouraging enrollment.10 Our project
team viewed and coded all unique advertise-
ments for type of sponsor: federal, private, state,
or other. The othercategory included advertising
sponsoredby entities outside ofhealth insurance
companies or government (for example, non-
profit organizations, hospitals or health care sys-
tems, or television stations) and included public
service announcement–style advertisements.
We aggregated these insurance advertisement
volume numbers across the four types of spon-
sors for the open enrollment period of October 1,
2013, to March 31, 2014, and included advertise-
ments aired until April 15, 2014, to encompass
the Special Enrollment Period.1 To partially
account for the targeting of insurance advertise-
ments, we also constructed a measure of pre–
open enrollment period insurance advertise-
ment volume by aggregating the total volume
of insurance advertisements shown in the first
nine months of 2013 in each DMA.
▸ NEWS COVERAGE: We included the DMA-
level volume of local television news coverage
of the ACA (ascertained from the Wesleyan Me-
dia Project) to adjust for other television broad-
cast information disseminated at the same time
as health insurance advertisements. The volume
of ACA news coverage included counts of ACA-
related keywords11 in the closed captioning of
local television news programming (evening lo-
cal news on all major networks) over the study
period.
▸ POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS: The volume
of ACApolitical advertisements (also ascertained
from the Wesleyan Media Project) was measured
as a count of all advertisements from political
sponsors (that is, candidates and political organ-
izations) that referenced the ACA. We included
all anti-ACAadvertisements in the analysis; these
constituted 95.2 percent of all ACA-related polit-
ical advertisements aired during this time.12
Statistical Analyses The unit of analysis
was the county-year.Ourprincipaloutcome mea-
sure was the percentage of uninsured people
younger than age sixty-five.We estimated a mul-
tivariate regression model that related the per-
centage of uninsured people to media volume in
the DMA corresponding to the county, an indi-
cator for whether the period was post-ACA (year

 2014), and interactions of media volume mea-
sures and the post-ACA indicator. Media volume
included a vector of all three types of media mea-
sures described above. The estimate on the post-
ACAindicatorcaptured theaverage change in the
uninsurance rate from 2013 to 2014. The inter-
action terms of post-ACA with media measures
captured the differential change in the uninsur-
ance rate from 2013 to 2014 by each media mea-
sure.We also controlled for pre–open enrollment
period media volume and county- and state-level
characteristics, described in online Appendix
Exhibit A1.13 Standard errors were clustered at
the state level. We estimated models with and
without state fixed effects and present results
from both specifications.
In additional analyses, we distinguished ad-
vertising volume by type of advertising sponsor
(federal, private insurance company, state, or
other). We also replicated all analyses with the
percentage of people younger than age sixty-five
enrolled in Medicaid as the outcome variable.
Limitations This study had a number of lim-
itations. First, our analyses were limited to 629
counties with uninsurance and key demographic
data available both in 2013 and 2014. Never-
theless, these counties represented more than
80 percent of the US population.14 In Appendix
Exhibit A2, we provide detailed descriptive sta-
tistics on the counties included in the study.13
Second, we did not have measures of individ-
uals’ actual exposure to insurance product
advertisements, so we relied on ecological-level
measures (that is, measures at an aggregate, in-
stead of individual or person level) of the maxi-
mum volume to which individuals would have
been plausibly exposed.15
Third, we recognized that insurance market-
ers and local media might have targeted their
messages to particular areas. To account for this
media targeting by local economic and demo-
graphic characteristics, we included the pre–
open enrollment period volume of health insur-
ance product advertisement in our statistical
models. In addition, we estimated a series of
models in which we used variables correlated
with the media measures and uncorrelated with
study outcomes as instrumental variables to ac-
count for this potential targeting effect and to
provide causal support to our estimates. Finally,
we conducted a sensitivity analysis repeating our
analyses including only counties that were less
likely to be targeted within each DMA.
Study Results
Variation Of Insurance Advertisements On
average, 3,206 insurance advertisements were
aired in all DMAs, with an interquartile range
of 549 advertisements (twenty-fifth percentile)
to 4,469 advertisements (seventy-fifth percen-
tile) (Exhibit 1). A given DMA had an average
of 1,480 advertisements with private sponsors,
883 advertisements with federal sponsors, and
800 advertisements with state sponsors. In addi-
tion, an average DMAhad 378 political advertise-
ments aired and 778 ACA-related keyword hits in
local evening news aired during the open enroll-
ment period. The distribution of advertisements
was uneven, with many DMAs having no adver-
tisements shown in the tenth and twenty-fifth
percentiles of distribution.
The volume of insurance product advertise-
ments aired during the first open enrollment
period also varied substantially across DMAs
throughout the United States, with the largest
advertisement volumes occurring in the South-
west (Appendix Exhibit A3).13 For instance,
18,747 insurance advertisements aired in the
Albuquerque, New Mexico, media market, of
which the majority (62.4 percent) were spon-
sored by the State of New Mexico, followed
by advertisements sponsored by private health
insurers (36.7 percent). DMAs in the Upper
Mountain region and the West North Central
region had consistently low insurance product
advertisement volume during this time period.
In the East North Central region, advertise-
ment volume varied substantially across the
DMAs.Within some states, there was substantial
variation in advertisement volume at the DMA

market had zero insurance product advertise-

period.
Association Between Media Volume And
Percentage Uninsured In the first model,
which used aggregate insurance advertisement
volume, estimates found that the uninsured pop-
ulation younger than age sixty-five decreased by
2.9 percentage points in 2014 relative to 2013, on
average, in the included counties (Exhibit 2).
Counties with larger advertisement volumes
experienced a larger decline in uninsurance. A
1,000-unit increase in insurance advertisements
was associated with a 0.1-percentage-point re-
duction in uninsurance (coefficient estimate
on the interaction of post-ACA and insurance
advertisements). This finding held when we in-
cluded state fixed effects to account for time-
invariant differences across states (full estimates
on all covariates are presented in Appendix
Exhibit A4).13
The estimates suggested that increasing in-
surance advertisements from 549 (twenty-fifth
percentile across DMAs) to 4,469 (seventy-fifth
percentile across DMAs)—a difference of 3,920
advertisements—would be associated with a
0.392-percentage-point reduction in the per-
centage uninsured in 2014 (Exhibit 3). Also, in
2014 the uninsurance rate was lower at all points
in the advertisement volume distribution com-
pared to 2013. A key finding was the widening
gap between 2013 and 2014, which reflected
greater gains in insurance coverage as advertise-
ment volume increased.
We found no evidence that higher volumes of
political advertisements or news keywords were
associated with larger declines in uninsurance
between 2013 and 2014 (Exhibit 2). Pre–open
enrollment period volume of insurance adver-
tisements shown in the first nine months of
2013 had a positive and significant association
with uninsurance. Among other county and state
characteristics, specification without state fixed
effects indicated that having a larger fraction of
elderly (ages sixty-five and older), black, and
Latino populations; having higher poverty rates;

 having a lower percentage who voted for Barack
in 2012; and being in a non–Medicaid expansion
state were positively associated with uninsur-
ance. In the specification with state fixed effects,
black population and percentage who voted for
Obama were no longer associated with uninsur-
ance (Appendix Exhibit A4).13 In a sensitivity
analysis, we found that the key result of the as-
sociation of insurance advertisements with un-
insurance also held when we allowed the time-
invariant county and state characteristics to vary
in their associations in 2013 and 2014 (Appendix
Exhibit A5).13
In an instrumental variables approach, we
identified variables that were associated with
our key media measures but not insurance
enrollment (for example, non–ACA related polit-
ical ads and a competition index of local televi-
sion stations) and then reestimated the media-
enrollment relationship. Consistent with other
results, the coefficient estimate on the interac-
tion of insurance advertisement volume with
post-ACA indicators was negative and significant
in these models, providing causal support for the
finding that larger insurance advertisement vol-
ume led to larger declines in the uninsurance
rate between 2013 and 2014 (detailed methodol-
ogy and results are presented in Appendix Ex-
hibit A6).13 For example, these models indicated
that the uninsured population younger than age
sixty-five decreased, on average, by 3.8 percent-
age points in 2014 relative to 2013, and larger
insurance advertisement volume led to larger
declines in the uninsurance rate. A 1,000-unit
increase in insurance advertisements was asso-
ciated with a 0.24-percentage-point further
reduction in uninsurance.
When we distinguished among the insurance
advertisements by type of sponsor (Exhibit 2,
model 2), state-sponsored advertisements were
associated with a differential reduction in unin-
surance between 2013 and 2014. An increase in
aired state-sponsored advertisements of 1,000
reduced uninsurance further by 0.23 percentage
point. As before, the pre–open enrollment peri-
od volume of insurance advertisements shown in
the first nine months of 2013 had a positive and
significant association with uninsurance, but
this association disappeared when we controlled
for state fixed effects. This finding is not surpris-
ing, as pre–open enrollment insurance adver-
tisements at least partially capture media target-
ing of areas with higher uninsurance rates, and
state fixed effects also adjust for some of this
geographic targeting.
An additional sensitivity analysis that included
only counties that were less likely to be targeted
within each DMA based on their baseline
characteristics (uninsurance rate, target popula-
tion size, and poverty rate) also supported the
finding that insurance advertising, primarily
through state-sponsored advertising, was asso-
ciated with reductions in uninsurance (detailed
methodology and results are presented in Ap-
pendix Exhibit A7).13 For example, in counties
with populations that were likely to be low
targets for insurers within their DMA because
they
had
below-median
uninsurance
rates,
below-median percentages of the population
ages 18–64, and below-median percentages of
the population with incomes of 125 percent to
400 percent of the federal poverty level, an in-
crease in state-sponsored advertisements of
1,000 reduced uninsurance further by 0.19 per-
centage point.
Overall, the percentage of the population
younger than age sixty-five enrolled in Medicaid
in our sample counties increased by 1.3 percent-
age points between 2013 and 2014 (Exhibit 4).
Although there was no significant association
between the volume of advertisement airings
aggregated by type and Medicaid enrollment
(model 1), there was a relationship between ad-
vertisement airings and enrollment when the
advertisements were broken out by type. Specifi-
cally, the volume of private-sponsored advertise-
ments was associated with a reduction in county
Medicaid enrollment between 2013 and 2014,

2013 and 2014 corresponding to different values of the number of overall advertisements aired
during the first open enrollment period (based on model 1 in Exhibit 2). The difference between
the lines can be interpreted as the gains in insurance at each volume level of advertisement airings—
showing greater gains (or a larger decline in uninsurance) at a higher volume of ads.

 while the volume of state-sponsored advertise-
ments was associated with an increase in county
Medicaid enrollment between 2013 and 2014.
The volume of other advertisements (for exam-
ple, enrollment advocate and public service
announcements) was also associated with in-
creases in Medicaid enrollment. These advertise-
ment sponsor–specific findings held up even
with the fixed effects model specification, which
means that the findings were not driven by state
characteristics, such as differences in state Med-
icaid expansion status.
Finally, we found that higher numbers of anti-
ACA political advertisements were associated
with declines in Medicaid enrollment (Exhibit 4,
model 1); however, the coefficients were not sta-
tistically significant in the models that broke out
insurance advertisement types (model 2).
The sensitivity analysis that included only
counties that were less likely to be targeted with-
in each DMA demonstrated results similar to
those of the main analyses: Insurance advertis-
ing, primarily through state-sponsored advertis-
ing, was associated with increased Medicaid
enrollment from 2013 to 2014 (Appendix Ex-
hibit A7).13
Discussion
Numerous
researchers,
commentators,
and
journalists have reported on the significant
gains in health insurance achieved after the first
few years of the implementation of the ACA be-
tween 2014 and 2016.16–18 The financial invest-
ment in outreach and marketing to the unin-
sured population was considerable,3 and for
good reason: The stability of the health insur-
ance Marketplaces created by the ACA depended
upon ample enrollees, and federal and state gov-
ernments had strong political incentives to pro-
mote the new health insurance options to the
public and gain enrollees (and possibly new sup-
porters of the law).While other researchers have
described insurance gains and in which sub-
groups those coverage gains accrued,19 ours is
the first study to link insurance changes follow-
ing the 2014 implementation of the ACA period
with the efforts of federal, state, and nonprofit

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of the analytic data (constructed from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and Kantar Media/
Campaign Media Analysis Group data and other data sets listed in this study, 2013–14). NOTES In models, media volume included was
in 1,000s of advertisements (for example, 3,000 advertisements were included as 3). Estimates reported from multivariate regression
models in which the outcome variable was percentage uninsured nonelderly people (younger than age sixty-five) enrolling in Medicaid.
The unit of analysis was the county-year. Model 1 used aggregate insurance advertisement volume (across all advertisement sponsors:
private, federal, state, other), while model 2 included a breakdown of insurance advertisements by sponsor type. We present each
model first without state fixed effects (base) and next with state fixed effects. Other covariates included in both models but not
reported were county characteristics, percentage who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and state and rating area characteristics.
Standard errors were clustered at the state-level. Pre–open enrollment period 1 insurance advertisements include insurance
advertisement volume in the first nine months of 2013 in each Designated Market Area. ACA is Affordable Care Act.

Our results show strong and stable associa-
tions between the volume of insurance advertis-
ing and health insurance gains in counties be-
tween 2013 and 2014. Specifically, for every
1,000 advertisements shown, we observed an
average decline in uninsurance of 0.1 percentage
point. Most of these gains in insurance appeared
to be driven by the variations in volume of ad-
vertisements sponsored by state Marketplaces.
In models examining differences in Medicaid
enrollment between 2013 and 2014, we found
that state-based Marketplace advertisements
were associated with larger gains in enrollment,
even when we examined only within-state differ-
ences in advertisement volume. To put these es-
timates in context, we estimated that 593,251
insurance advertisements were aired in our sam-
ple counties during the first open enrollment
period. Of these, 148,120 were state-sponsored
advertisements. Moving from the twenty-fifth to
the seventy-fifth percentile of state advertise-
ments aired in a DMA would be an increase
of about 800 such advertisements. Our models
suggest that for that amount of outreach, 2,077
people in a DMA would gain insurance (a de-
crease intheuninsurancerate from12.71 percent
to 12.56 percent), representing approximately
2.5 people per state-sponsored advertisement.
Our models also predicted that doubling state-
sponsored advertisements from the mean of 800
at the DMA would reduce the uninsurance rate
from 12.56 percent to 12.41 percent (a 1.19 per-
cent reduction). These main findings, combined
with sensitivity analyses providing additional
support for an underlying causal relationship
between media volume and enrollment, suggest
that the efforts of those involved in marketing
health insurance options—and state govern-
ments in particular—might have contributed
to the uptake in health insurance. Interestingly,
we saw no evidence that advertisements spon-
sored by private sponsors (health insurance
companies themselves) were associated with in-
surance gains, despite the fact that private com-
panies were the most prominent advertisement
sponsor.
These results have implications beyond the
initial implementation period of the ACA. The
future of the ACA is uncertain as of spring
2017, and proposals by Congress to repeal and
replace the ACA are under discussion. Any health
insurance system—particularly a system with a
strong private-sector role, as articulated in Re-
publican plans—will rely on marketing to attract
new consumers. Indeed, this study demonstrates
an important finding for health communication
and health policy more generally: Consumers are
responsive to persuasive health communication
messages about health insurance, but the type of
advertisement might matter. Our findings sup-
port earlier work outside of the ACA context,
such as the finding that enrollment in Medicaid
increases following advertisements—in our case,
state-sponsored advertisements.9 Our finding of
null effects of private insurance advertising is
also consistent with recent research demonstrat-
ing that television advertising for private Medi-
care Advantage plans is unrelated to the propor-
tion of seniors who choose such plans.20,21 Of
course, the ACA may have provided a favorable
environment for health insurance enrollment,
given the subsidies provided and penalties for
not participating.Without these policy tools, it is
not clear what the relationship between adver-
tising and enrollment would be. Future research
could unpack the conditions that promote
greater or lower responsiveness to health insur-
ance messaging.
We examined only a single type of media,
broadcast television, while simultaneously ad-
justing for two other types of attention to the
ACA: local news discussion and political adver-
tisements aired.While we were unable to capture
other types of local-level information sources
about the ACA from other media (that is, Inter-
net, local newspapers, or radio) or of the activi-
ties of enrollment and outreach specialists, this
is an area that should be explored in the future.
Similarly, our data on the funding provided for
consumer assistance was at the state level, and
future work could collect and use measures of
locally focused enrollment or outreach activities.
Conclusion
We found that the volume of insurance advertise-
ments aired during the open enrollment period
of 2013–14 was related to insurance gains, par-
ticularly from state-sponsored advertisements

 and particularly for Medicaid. Future research
should look for opportunities to examine these
relationships at the individual level (based on
DMA of residence). These results support the
importance of strategic investment in advertis-
ing to increase uptake of health insurance but
suggest that not all types of advertisements have
the same effect on the public. ▪
