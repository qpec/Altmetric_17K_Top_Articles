C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of 
mortality for women in the United States1 and globally.2 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) has traditionally been con-
sidered a disease of men, but what has been the odyssey for 
women in the century since its initial description by Herrick 
in 1912?3 Despite stunning improvements in cardiovascular 
mortality for women in the past 2 decades (Figure),1 CHD 
remains understudied, underdiagnosed, and undertreated 
in women. Since 1984, the annual CVD mortality rate has 
remained greater for women than for men, and the absolute 
numbers of individuals living with and dying of CVD in the 
United States are larger for women than for men.1 Improved 
survival for women has been attributed equally to improved 
therapy for established CVD and to primary and secondary 
preventive interventions. Transformation of the research land-
scape and the results of landmark randomized, clinical trials 
have contributed to improved cardiovascular care for women.
Emerging data highlight important sex differences 
in the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and clini-
cal outcomes that were spurred by 2 milestone reports 
from the Institute of Medicine: Exploring the Biological 
Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?4 and 
Women’s Health Research: Progress, Pitfalls, and Promise.5 
These reports highlight the fact that although major progress 
has been made in reducing CVD mortality in women, medi-
cal research has historically neglected the health needs of 
Abstract—Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in 
American women. Since 1984, the annual cardiovascular 
disease mortality rate has remained greater for women than men; however, over the last decade, there have been marked 
reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality in women. The dramatic decline in mortality rates for women is attributed 
partly to an increase in awareness, a greater focus on women and cardiovascular disease risk, and the increased application 
of evidence-based treatments for established coronary heart disease. This is the first scientific statement from the 
American Heart Association on acute myocardial infarction in women. Sex-specific differences exist in the presentation, 
pathophysiological mechanisms, and outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This statement provides a 
comprehensive review of the current evidence of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcomes of 
women with acute myocardial infarction. (Circulation. 2016;133:916-947. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000351.)

women, apart from reproductive concerns. Women’s health 
involves 2 aspects: sex differences resulting from bio-
logical factors and gender differences affected by broader 
social, environmental, and community factors. Although 
the emphasis on sex-specific CVD research for the past 2 
decades has led to an improved understanding of sex-spe-
cific pathophysiology for CHD in women and important 
insights into an expanded spectrum of coronary atheroscle-
rosis, female research subjects are underrepresented when 
studies are designed, conducted, and analyzed.
Although obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the epi-
cardial coronary arteries remains the basic cause of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) in both sexes, plaque charac-
teristics differ for women, and recent data have suggested a 
greater role of microvascular disease in the pathophysiology 
of coronary events among women.6 Despite being older and 
having a greater risk factor burden and a greater symptom 
burden of angina and consequent morbidity and mortality, 
women paradoxically have less severe obstructive disease 
of their epicardial coronary arteries at elective angiography 
than men.7 Multiple studies have shown that women with 
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are less likely to be treated 
with guideline-directed medical therapies,8–10 less likely to 
undergo cardiac catheterization,8–11 and less likely to receive 
timely reperfusion.9,10,12–16
Improving CHD morbidity and mortality and closing the 
knowledge gaps on AMI clinical presentations and treatments 
for women are public health priorities. This American Heart 
Association (AHA) scientific statement provides a compre-
hensive review of the current evidence of the epidemiology, 
clinical presentation, pathophysiology, treatment, and out-
comes of women with AMI. Although sex and gender differ-
ences are presented in some sections, the primary intent of 
this document is to synthesize the current state of the science 
of AMI in women.
Scope of the Problem
Marked reductions in CVD mortality in women have occurred 
for the first time this past decade, partly as a result of an increase 
in awareness, a greater focus on women and their cardiovascu-
lar risk, and the application of evidence-based treatments for 
established CHD. Despite these advancements, CVD remains 
the leading morbidity and mortality threat affecting millions of 
American women. Reasons for the increased AMI rates among 
women are multifactorial and are related to the prevalence of 
disease and the influence of age, race, and ethnicity.
Prevalence of AMI
CHD afflicts 6.6 million US women annually and remains the 
leading morbidity and mortality threat in women. Of these, 2.7 
million have a history of MI, >53 000 died of an MI, and an 
estimated 262 000 women were hospitalized for an ACS (AMI 
and unstable angina).1 Regardless of age, within a year of a 
first AMI, more women than men will die (26% of women and 
19% of men); within 5 years of a first AMI, more women than 
men will die (47% of women and 36% of men), have heart 
failure (HF), or suffer from a stroke.1 At both 5 and 10 years 
after AMI, higher unadjusted mortality for women compared 
with men was explained partially by differences in age, MI risk 
factors, clinical presentation, and treatment.17 Studies report a 
higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), HF, hyperten-
sion, depression, and renal dysfunction in women compared 
with men. Compared with men, women more commonly pres-
ent with non–ST-segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI)18–20 and 
nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).18,21,22 Women 
are also more likely to have unusual pathophysiological mech-
anisms of CAD such as spontaneous coronary artery dissec-
tion (SCAD) or coronary artery spasm (CAS).23–26 Compared 
with men, women with ACS and those after coronary revascu-
larization have longer hospitalizations and higher in-hospital 
mortality, manifest more bleeding complications, and endure

up to 30% more readmissions within 30 days after the index 
hospitalization.27–31
Influence of Age
ACS in young women seems distinctive because premature 
CHD is relatively rare in this group.32 Limited existing data on 
the frequency of AMI among young patients reveal that each 
year >30 000 women <55 years of age are hospitalized with AMI 
in the United States.33 Hospitalizations for AMI increased 2% 
between 1997 and 2006.33 From 2001 to 2010, women demon-
strated either no change (in women 30–34 and 35–39 years of 
age) or a slight absolute increase (in women 40–44 and 45–49 
years) in hospitalization rates for AMI.34 Recent data of AMI 
patients <65 years of age demonstrate a nearly 2-fold higher 
crude 30-day hospital readmission rate in women compared with 
men of a similar age, even after adjustment for confounders.35 
Recent data show an unfortunate increase in CHD incidence 
and deaths among women 45 to 54 years of age.36 From 2001 to 
2011, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 39%, 
and the actual number of deaths declined 25.3%. Among women, 
death rates fell by 2.6%/y in the 1980s, by 2.4% in the 1990s, and 
4.4% from 2000 to 2002; however, when stratified by age, among 
women 35 to 54 years of age, the average annual rate of death 
fell by 5.4% and 1.2% and then increased by 1.5%.
The substantial decline in MI event rates or MI deaths in 
the United States in the past decade is absent in young women. 
Troubling trends of worse risk factor profiles and higher mortal-
ity among younger compared with older women persist, with 
continuing reports of excess in-hospital, early, and late mortal-
ity compared with men.34,37–44 Consistent evidence suggests an 
age-sex interaction whereby younger women are at particularly 
high risk of mortality after AMI even with other prognostic fac-
tors taken into account.37,45,46 The mechanisms, likely multifacto-
rial, contributing to excess risk and inferior health among young 
women remain unclear.32,47 Plausible candidates for poor out-
comes among young women include unique sex-specific biology 
and disease manifestations and distinctive gendered (socially 
constructed with identified roles and expectations) psychosocial 
stressors that interfere with health behaviors and interact with 
biology.47 Many unanswered questions remain about the excess 
mortality risk in young women with AMI. Publications from 
the recently completed Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender 
on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study provide 
insight into and guidance on sex differences in prognostic fac-
tors that affect outcomes in young women with AMI.48
Women are often older when they present with their first 
AMI, at an average age of 71.8 years compared with 65 years 
for men.1 The older age of onset of CHD in women compared 
with men is thought to be due to the protective role of circulat-
ing estrogens on the vascular endothelium.49 This hypothesis 
is derived largely from the observation that the incidence of 
AMI rises substantially in postmenopausal women; however, 
it is difficult to unravel the effect of age from that of meno-
pause. The complex mechanisms by which estrogen influ-
ences CHD risk are incompletely understood; however, direct 
effects of estrogen on the vascular system include increased 
release of nitric oxide leading to vasodilation,50,51 regulation of 
prostaglandin production,52 and inhibition of smooth muscle 
proliferation.53 Population studies have shown that estrogen 
depletion at menopause increases endothelial dysfunction and 
lipid deposition in the vasculature, which can precipitate the 
development of atherosclerosis over time.54,55 However, despite 
the cardioprotective effects of endogenous estrogen, studies 
evaluating exogenous estrogen hormone therapy for the pri-
mary prevention of CHD in postmenopausal women have been 
convincingly negative. The Women’s Health Initiative has 
provided evidence indicating that postmenopausal hormone 
therapy is not suitable for the prevention of CHD in women 
who initiate treatment distant from menopause onset,56 that 
utility in younger women remains inconclusive, and that more 
research is needed in this area. Therefore, according to current 
evidence-based guidelines, postmenopausal hormone therapy 
is not recommended for the primary or secondary prevention 
of CVD57 because hormone therapy does not prevent the pro-
gression of established atherosclerosis and precipitates acute 
CHD events in older women.56
Racial/Ethnic Disparities
Racially and ethnically diverse women with AMI have dis-
tinct experiences in terms of presentation, risk factor burden, 
evidence-based care, and long-term outcomes. Ethnically 
diverse women present with their incident MI at a younger 
age than white women.58,59 The prevalence of MI is higher 
in black women than in all other racial and ethnic groups of 
women.1,58,60–62 Black women also have a higher incidence of 
sudden cardiac death (SCD) as the first manifestation of CHD 
than white women,62–64 and their survival rate after out-of-
hospital arrest is about one third that of whites.65 Asian Indian 
women have greater proportionate mortality burden from CHD 
compared with non-Hispanic white women (proportional mor-
tality ratio, 1.12 versus 0.92).66–69 In stark contrast to other racial 
and ethnic groups, CHD mortality rates in Asian Indians were 
higher in 2010 than in 2003.66 Data from the INTERHEART 
registry suggest that Asian Indians have a greater burden of 
cardiovascular risk factors, particularly at a younger age.69
Compared with non-Hispanic white women, black and 
Hispanic women have more comorbidities (eg, DM, hyper-
tension, HF, and obesity) at the time of presentation with 
AMI.59,62,70,71 At the time of presentation, 60% of older black 
women and 54% of younger black women have a clustering of 
≥3 risk factors.72 The high prevalence of comorbidities is the 
hypothesized driver of higher rates of MI and a significant con-
tributor to poorer long-term outcomes in black women.60,62,70 
In the Corpus Christi Heart Project, rates of hospitalization 
for AMI were higher in Mexican American women than in 
non-Hispanic white women.73 Even with their adverse car-
diovascular risk profiles, Hispanics appear to have less SCD 
than non-Hispanics.71 Although not applicable to all Hispanic 
subgroups, the prevailing Hispanic paradox of relatively low 
cardiac mortality despite poor risk factor profiles is thought 
to be partially explained by greater social support, optimism, 
and strong family ties among Hispanics.71 More than one third 
of American Indian women have ≥3 cardiac risk factors.74 A 
staggering 78% of cardiovascular events in American Indian 
women occurred in diabetics.75 At a time when other groups 
are experiencing a decline, the rate of coronary events in 
American Indian women is increasing to levels that are almost 
2-fold higher than in the US population.75–77

AMI prevalence by race and ethnicity interacts with age. 
In women <55 years of age with AMI, black women have 
higher mortality rates than white women even after adjust-
ment for chronic renal failure, time to presentation, insurance, 
and treatment in the first 24 hours.78 Young black women have 
higher hospitalization rates for AMI than young white women, 
and they have more comorbidities, including hypertension, 
DM, chronic kidney disease, and HF, than white women.34,72,79 
At the time of presentation with AMI, older black and 
Hispanic women have a significantly higher prevalence of 
DM, hypertension, physical inactivity, and abdominal obe-
sity with less well-controlled blood pressure and lipid levels 
than non-Hispanic white women.70,72,80 Across all age groups, 
annual rates of hospitalization for AMI have decreased less 
rapidly for black women than for white women.81,82
Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians as a whole pres-
ent later to the hospital after AMI symptoms.83 The American 
College of Cardiology–National Cardiovascular Data Registry 
shows that women from all ethnic backgrounds were less 
likely to undergo percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) 
and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) than their male 
counterparts.58 Multiple studies have documented disparities 
in rates of referral of black women to coronary angiogra-
phy and reperfusion compared with white women and black 
men.59,79,84 Even after baseline differences were controlled 
for, black women are least likely to be referred for reperfu-
sion therapy and coronary angiography.79,83,85 The difference 
in rates of use of these interventions across ethnically diverse 
women has decreased over time.34,79,86
Despite more cardiac risk factors, secondary prevention 
efforts are less commonly used for black and Hispanic women. 
Rates of lipid-lowering medication use and counseling for smok-
ing cessation are lower among nonwhite women.87 Disparities 
are even more pronounced for younger black women compared 
with young white women.72 Even in institutions participating 
in quality initiatives that demonstrate narrowing of racial gaps 
in the use of preventive medications after MI at 30 days, nota-
ble differences remain by 12 months, with black and Hispanic 
women having the lowest risk-adjusted adherence to angio-
tensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and β-blockers.88 
Data suggest that increased adherence to guidelines may reduce 
these disparities for black and Hispanic women.79,89,90
Pathophysiology of AMI
The scientific evidence supports pathophysiological differ-
ences between women and men with AMI. Underlying causes 
are multifactorial and are related to the pathophysiological 
sex differences in CHD. Coronary pathology interacts with 
the biological sex characteristics of women to produce dif-
ferences in plaque characteristics (rupture versus erosion) and 
prevalence of CAS and SCAD.
Plaque Rupture and Erosion
Autopsy studies from past decades have established that there 
are predominantly 3 major vascular events underlying throm-
botic coronary occlusions responsible for AMI: plaque rup-
ture, plaque erosion, and calcific nodule. Plaque rupture is by 
far the most common cause, responsible for 76% of men and 
55% of women with fatal MI.91 Originally described 3 decades 
ago, ruptured plaques are associated with positive remodeling 
and characterized by a large necrotic core and a thin fibrous 
cap that is disrupted and infiltrated by foamy macrophages, 
T cells, and matrix metalloproteinases.92 As a consequence, 
tissue factor at the core is exposed to flowing blood, leading 
to activation of the coagulation cascade, and is ultimately 
responsible for formation of occlusive atherothrombus. 
Plaque erosion is another mechanism for coronary thrombo-
sis without plaque rupture.93,94 Erosions are distinguished by 
an absent or denuded endothelium overlying a plaque that is 
characterized by abundant proteoglycans and greater prolif-
eration of smooth muscle than inflammatory cells. Coronary 
obstruction is precipitated largely by the thrombi that develop 
on the dysfunctional intima of plaque erosions. Downstream 
microembolization is more commonly associated with plaque 
erosion than with plaque rupture, resulting in focal myocar-
dial necrosis.95,96 Finally, ≈2% to 7% of coronary thrombosis 
in STEMI might originate from calcific nodules, seen more 
frequently in the right coronary artery.94
Although plaque rupture was responsible for 76% of fatal 
AMI events among men in a worldwide survey, only 55% of 
these events in women were found to be due to plaque rup-
ture.91 Autopsy studies have shown an increased prevalence of 
plaque erosion in women compared with men, particularly in 
younger women.97 This is of significant interest given that MI 
without obstructive CAD is more common at younger ages 
and among women.98,99 With the advent of optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), plaque erosion has been characterized in 
living patients with STEMI100,101 and NSTEMI102 after throm-
bus aspiration. Plaque erosion accounted for 27% of patients 
with STEMI and 31% of NSTEMI in these studies.101,102 
Female sex and premenopausal status are the only 2 risk fac-
tors that have been shown to predict type of thrombotic coro-
nary lesion in autopsy studies. Although in vivo assessment 
with OCT shows that ACS patients with erosions are younger, 
have less severe obstructive stenosis, and less often present 
with STEMI than those with plaque rupture, there are no 
sex-related differences in prevalence of erosions.102 This can 
be explained partly by differences in the respective cohorts 
of SCD versus ACS patients. In a recent small study of 140 
patients, plaque rupture was the most frequent cause of coro-
nary thrombus; however, there were no sex differences in cul-
prit plaque morphology or factors associated with coronary 
thrombosis between age-matched men and women presenting 
with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. An important limita-
tion of the study is that the age-matching algorithm may have 
inherently lessened sex differences in baseline clinical char-
acteristics, including reduced enrollment of younger women 
who are known to have a higher prevalence of plaque ero-
sion.104 Plaque rupture is especially rare in premenopausal 
women, perhaps suggesting a protective effect of estrogen.105 
Contrasting results have been reported for the relationship of 
hypercholesterolemia, DM, and smoking with type of coro-
nary thrombotic occlusion.106–109 Hypertension does not favor 
any particular type of thrombosis.106 Some circulating bio-
markers, including myeloperoxidase, have been found to be 
at higher levels in patients with OCT-defined plaque erosions 
compared with rupture.105 Additionally, between 7% and 32% 
of women with MI have no angiographically demonstrable

obstructive CAD (>50% stenosis).18,98,99,110 Their MI may be 
due to plaque rupture and ulceration, plaque erosion, vaso-
spasm, and embolism.97,111
Characterization of the plaque pathology is not routinely 
performed because of limited availability of advanced imag-
ing techniques, including OCT, that allow the discrimination 
of intact fibrous cap from ruptured fibrous cap with a much 
higher resolution compared with intravascular ultrasound.112 
Although stenting is known to significantly improve outcomes 
with plaque rupture, it has been argued that reliable charac-
terization of plaque morphology might justify alternative 
approaches, including aspiration thrombectomy and catheter-
directed lytic therapy without stent implantation, as the initial 
strategy for treatment in patients with plaque erosions. In a 
recent study, 31 patients presenting with STEMI who under-
went thrombectomy and were found to have plaque erosions 
by OCT were randomized to dual antiplatelet therapy without 
PCI and standard angioplasty and stenting.100 After a median 
follow-up of 2 years, there was no difference in need for revas-
cularization in the 2 groups. However, randomized, controlled 
trials are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of these 
alternative management strategies in patients with plaque ero-
sions before they are incorporated into clinical practice.
A caveat to these studies is the relative absence of evi-
dence on the reliability of differentiating plaque rupture from 
erosion, including at autopsy and with OCT. Methods that can 
be trusted to accurately differentiate these underlying causes 
and to create a taxonomy that might ultimately have utility 
for prevention and treatment are needed. In young women, 
there is great heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of AMI. 
Approximately 1 of 8 young women with AMI in the VIRGO 
study did not fit in the current classification schemes for AMI, 
and as a result, the authors have proposed a new, more inclu-
sive taxonomy that may provide a framework for improved 
understanding and investigation into risk factors, treatment 
strategies, and outcomes in young women.113 For now, it is 
intriguing that the underlying mechanism of AMI varies by 
sex, with implications for treatment, yet more scientific inves-
tigation is needed in the realm.
Coronary Artery Spasm
CAS is a well-known phenomenon for recurrent chest pain epi-
sodes at rest with associated transient ST-segment elevation,114 
but it is also a rare mechanism for AMI.115,116 The pathogenesis 
of CAS is multifactorial and includes vagal withdrawal, vascu-
lar smooth muscle hyperactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and 
an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system.117,118 Cigarette 
smoking is a major risk factor for CAS,119 and possible trig-
gers include variation in autonomic activity,120 cocaine use,121 
ephedrine alkaloids,122 and other drugs.123,124 Provocative test-
ing with ergonovine, acetylcholine, or hyperventilation during 
coronary angiography can be helpful in diagnosing CAS.125–127
Data on sex differences associated with CAS are limited. 
One study demonstrated that women with CAS were typi-
cally older, had a lower incidence of smoking, and had less 
significant obstructive CHD compared with men with CAS. 
Five-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates 
were similar in both sexes, but further analysis revealed that 
younger women with CAS had a significantly lower survival 
rate than older women, perhaps because of higher tobacco use 
in the younger cohort.128
In a small study of patients with vasospastic angina 
who underwent repeated coronary angiography, persistent 
vasospasm was associated with progressive atherosclerosis, 
whereas reduced vasospastic activity was associated with 
atherosclerosis regression.129 CAS plays a significant role in 
the development of an AMI via thrombin generation result-
ing in thrombus formation130 and impaired fibrinolytic activ-
ity resulting in thrombus preservation.131 In patients with 
ACS from the Coronary Artery Spasm in Patients With Acute 
Coronary Syndrome (CASPAR) study, ≈25% had no obstruc-
tive culprit lesion on coronary angiography. CAS was present 
in almost 50% of the patients who underwent acetylcholine 
provocative testing.116 Provoked CAS is an independent pre-
dictor of major adverse cardiac events.132 The incidence of 
recurrent or persistent angina is high in the long term follow-
up of patients with CAS; however, rates of AMI and cardiac 
mortality are low.133,134
Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection
SCAD is a very rare cause of AMI that occurs more frequently 
in women and should be suspected in any young woman who 
presents with an ACS without typical atherosclerotic risk fac-
tors.135 The true prevalence of SCAD is unknown, but avail-
able data suggest a prevalence of 0.2% to 4%136–138 of patients 
undergoing cardiac catheterization, and it is reported to occur 
in 10.8% of women <50 years of age who present with an 
ACS or AMI.136 SCAD is associated with peripartum and 
postpartum status, oral contraceptive use, exercise, connective 
tissue disorders, and vasculitides (including fibromuscular 
dysplasia). In some cases, there are no identifiable coexisting 
conditions.139–141
The clinical presentation of SCAD can vary among 
unstable angina, MI, ventricular arrhythmias, and SCD. 
Single-vessel SCAD most frequently involves the left ante-
rior descending artery; however, multivessel involvement has 
also been reported.139 There are no definitive guidelines on the 
optimal treatment strategy for patients with SCAD. Treatment 
of SCAD has varied among conservative management, throm-
bolytic therapy (in the pre-PCI era), PCI, and CABG139,142,143; 
however, it has been proposed that patients with ongoing isch-
emia should be revascularized either percutaneously or sur-
gically.135 Regardless of therapeutic choice, the overall early 
mortality rate is low but complication rates are high in the 
PCI-treated patients because of propagation of the dissection 
flap with instrumentation of the vessel or failure to cross into 
the distal true lumen.139 Some dissections resolve without any 
coronary intervention.144,145
The Mayo Clinic has the largest series of SCAD patients 
and has reported a high recurrence rate of 17% (occurring 
solely in women), a 10-year mortality rate of 7.7%, and a high 
MACE (death, recurrent SCAD, MI, and HF) rate of 47.4%.139 
These rates are higher than in previously reported registries, 
perhaps as a result of referral-related differences in patient 
populations.136,146 In a recent analysis of 189 patients who 
presented with a first SCAD episode, the rates of procedural 
complications and PCI failure requiring emergency CABG 
were high, even in those who presented with vessel patency.

Those treated with conservative measures predominantly had 
favorable early outcomes, aside from a minority with SCAD 
progression within 7 days of presentation. Importantly, revas-
cularization did not preclude the development of recurrent 
SCAD or late target vessel revascularization, so these patients 
need close follow-up over the long term.147 The management 
of SCAD is controversial. Conservative measures for the 
most part have favorable outcomes, and revascularization is 
not without risk and perhaps should be performed in extreme 
circumstances such as ischemia caused by total vessel occlu-
sion. There is a paucity of clinical data on the true prevalence 
and optimal management strategy of SCAD; much of what is 
currently known is based on angiographic and autopsy case 
reports/series.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Evolving sex-specific research has demonstrated that although 
men and women share similar risk factors for CHD, certain 
risk factors are more potent in women. These include tobacco 
abuse, type 2 DM, depression, and other psychosocial risk fac-
tors. The INTERHEART study data identified 9 potentially 
modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, DM, waist-
to-hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, alcohol con-
sumption, plasma apolipoproteins, and psychosocial factors) 
that account for 96% of the population-attributable risk of MI 
in women.148 For young women with favorable levels of all 
5 major traditional risk factors (smoking, hypertension, DM, 
serum cholesterol, and body mass index), CHD is a rare event, 
but unfortunately, only ≈20% of US women <40 years of age 
meet these low-risk criteria.149 Almost 50% of women have 
a clustering of ≥3 metabolic risk factors for ischemic heart 
disease.150 Data from the VIRGO study demonstrate that the 
prehealth status (physical and mental function, quality of life) 
of young women with AMI is poor compared with men.151 A 
recent study of young women with AMI reported that women 
fail to accurately assess their personal risk of heart disease 
despite having a family history of CVD; women also reported 
limited access to preventive cardiac care before the AMI.152 
These studies reinforce the need for improved cardiovascular 
knowledge among women, including an emphasis on access 
to medical care for preventive measures.
Cigarette Smoking
Smoking is the single most important preventable cause of 
MI in women and a leading cause of MI in women <55 years 
of age, increasing their risk 7-fold.153 In the INTERHEART 
study, a history of smoking had a stronger association with 
MI in men compared with women; however, current smok-
ing history did not have significant variation by sex.148 The 
triad of tobacco abuse, dyslipidemia, and familial CHD is 
common in young patients with AMI.154,155 Among patients 
with AMI, women <55 years of age have a higher prevalence 
of tobacco abuse and obesity compared with older women.72 
The risk of AMI in women is substantially reduced within 
1 or 2 years of smoking cessation and falls to the level of 
the risk of nonsmokers within 10 to 15 years.1,156,157 Despite 
a general decline in tobacco use in the US population, this 
decline in recent decades has been less pronounced in women 
than in men.158
Hypertension
Hypertension is a major risk factor for MI in women, with a 
population-attributable risk of 36%, indicating that the risk of 
MI could be reduced by 36% if hypertension is eliminated as 
a risk factor. Hypertension is more strongly associated with 
MI in women compared with men.148 In older women, isolated 
systolic hypertension is the most common form of hyperten-
sion. Women with a systolic blood pressure >185 mm Hg have 
a 3-fold increase in cardiac death compared with women with 
a level of ≤135 mm Hg.159 Unfortunately, national surveys 
continue to show low rates of hypertension awareness, treat-
ment, and control among women, although these rates have 
increased over time.160,161
Dyslipidemia
Elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol predict cardiac death in both middle-aged 
(<65 years) and older (≥65 years) women, but the strength 
and consistency of these relationships in older women are 
diminished.162 Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
and high triglyceride levels are powerful risk factors for CHD 
in women. Among 32 826 postmenopausal women from the 
Nurses’ Health Study, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
was the lipid parameter that best discriminated risk of CHD.163 
Lipoproteins levels are associated with long-term cardiovascu-
lar risk; however, in the AMI setting, there is a lipid paradox: 
Patients with significantly lower triglycerides and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels have higher in-hospital164 and 
30-day mortality rates.165 This seeming paradox may be due to 
competing risks of collider (index event) bias resulting from 
the selection of a diseased population166 such as older age and 
higher rates of DM in those with lower lipoprotein levels in 
the acute setting. Sex specific data examining lipids at admis-
sion and AMI outcomes are lacking.
Obesity and Type 2 DM
One third of US women are obese and 7% are extremely 
obese, defined as a body mass index ≥40 kg/m2.1 Obesity is 
especially prevalent among black women: 54% are obese and 
15% extremely obese.167 Among women ≥60 years of age, 
the prevalence of obesity increased 6.6% between 2003 to 
2004 and 2011 to 2012.168 Increasing body weight is associ-
ated with increasing coronary risk, and women in the heaviest 
category show a 4-fold higher risk for cardiovascular events 
compared with lean women.169 Obesity is a major risk factor 
for AMI in women and increases their risk almost 3-fold.170 
The risk of AMI associated with the metabolic syndrome 
is higher in younger women than any of the other groups, 
increasing their odds of AMI almost 5-fold.171 DM, related 
to obesity and the metabolic syndrome, is associated with a 
higher relative risk of coronary events in women compared 
with men, in part as a result of a higher rate of coexisting risk 
factors in women with DM170 and better survival (relative to 
men) of women without DM.172 DM is an especially powerful 
risk factor in young women, increasing their risk of CHD, 
including ACS, by 4- to 5-fold.173 For both men and women 
with DM, mortality after STEMI or UA/NSTEMI is signifi-
cantly increased compared with their nondiabetic counter-
parts at 30 days and 1 year.174

Depression and Other Psychosocial Risk Factors
There is growing evidence that psychological factors and 
emotional stress can influence the onset and clinical course 
of ischemic heart disease, especially in women. In the 
INTERHEART study, an aggregate exposure to psycho-
social risk factors, including depression, perceived home/
work stress, low locus of control, and major life events, 
was significantly associated with AMI in women, with an 
adjusted odds ratio of 3.5.148 Young women compared with 
young men presenting with AMI in the VIRGO study had 
significantly higher perceived stress scores.175 These women 
had significantly higher rates of DM, depression, and previ-
ous PCI compared with men. They were also more likely to 
report stressful life events in the past year, including intra-
family conflict, major personal injury or illness, and death 
of a close family member. Compared with men, women also 
had worse physical and mental health. High stress at baseline 
was associated with worse recovery in multiple health out-
comes 1 month after AMI.
Depression is ≈2-fold more prevalent in women than in 
men in the general population176 and is an important risk 
factor for incident MI or cardiac death, increasing a wom-
an’s risk by at least 50%.177,178 Recent evidence suggests that 
depression in women is a powerful predictor of early-onset 
MI, showing a more robust association with MI and car-
diac death in young and middle-aged women than in men of 
similar ages.179 Compared with young men, young women 
with AMI in the VIRGO trial were more likely to have a 
history of depression. Even after adjustment for socio-
economic, clinical, and disease severity characteristics, 
young women with AMI had 60% greater odds of having 
significant depressive symptoms than young men.180 Severe 
childhood adversities such as physical and sexual abuse 
are emerging independent risk factors for the incidence of 
ischemic heart disease among women.181,182 A recent meta-
analysis showed that anxiety is a moderate but independent 
risk factor for incident ischemic heart disease and cardiac 
death in both men and women, although individual study 
results are heterogeneous.183
Clinical Presentation
Sex differences in clinical presentation among patients with 
ACS are increasingly evident.184–186 Although most patients 
with AMI present with typical chest pain or chest discomfort, 
women often present with atypical chest pain and angina-
equivalent symptoms such as dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, 
and indigestion, as illustrated in Table 1.187 Sex differences in 
clinical presentation have consequences for timely identifica-
tion of ischemic symptoms, appropriate triage, and judicious 
diagnostic testing and management. The detrimental conse-
quences for women are misdiagnosis, delayed revasculariza-
tion, and higher AMI mortality rates.
Symptoms of AMI
Compared with men, women are more likely to have high-
risk presentations and less likely to manifest central chest 
pain.41,185,188 Pain in the upper back, arm, neck, and jaw, 
as well as unusual fatigue, dyspnea, indigestion, nausea/
vomiting, palpitations, weakness, and a sense of dread, 
occur more frequently in women compared with men.189–193  
Ischemic symptoms in young black women include 
unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or 
frequent indigestion, with older white women display-
ing fewer symptoms.188,194 Shoulder pain and arm pain are 
twice as predictive of an ACS diagnosis in women compared 
with men.195
Among young patients in the Gender and Sex 
Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to 
Beyond Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome (GENESIS 
PRAXY) study, chest pain was the most prevalent symp-
tom in both sexes, regardless of the type of ACS. However, 
women were more likely to present with more symptoms but 
less chest pain compared with men.185 Similarly, compared 
with men, women ≤45 years of age with AMI are signifi-
cantly more likely to present without chest pain and to have 
higher in-hospital mortality.41 A qualitative study of women 
30 to 55 years of age with AMI found that although they 
reported a diverse range of symptoms from discomfort or 
pain (eg, chest, neck and jaw) to more general symptoms 
(eg, sweating, anxiety, fatigue, and dizziness), the majority 
reported chest pain.152 Other women reported more nuanced 
symptoms that would pass, recur, or build over days, weeks, 
and months before the AMI. These young women failed to 
consider CHD as the potential underlying cause of their 
symptoms, and fear of being perceived as hypochondriacal 
if they were not in fact having an AMI was a predominant 
theme.152 Women not only have unique symptoms but also 
have less obstructive CHD along the spectrum of ACS.99 
Ischemic symptoms independently predict subsequent ACS 
in women despite normal coronary arteries, and plaque dis-
ruption is evident in almost 40% of women with ACS and 
nonobstructive CHD.111,196
Variance in clinical presentation may explain some of the 
sex disparities in mortality. Women have longer presentation 
and treatment times, which may contribute to their worse in-
hospital mortality.197 Coronary angiography is used less often in 
women, largely because their risk is underestimated, yet women 
have significantly higher mortality rates than men regardless

of age.30 What accounts for this excess risk is unclear, but the 
absence of chest pain may be more predictive of mortality in 
younger women with MI than in other similar age groups.41
Sudden Cardiac Death
The incidence of SCD in the United States has been esti-
mated to be 200 000 to 400 000 per year.198 Few studies have 
addressed sex differences in rates, causes, or presentation 
to the emergency room. Analyses of SCD by sex have been 
largely limited by small sample sizes.
Association With AMI
SCD is relatively common in the era of modern coronary inter-
ventions, yet even with guideline-based therapies, SCD after MI 
accounts for 50% of overall mortality.199 The rates of survival 
from SCD remain an abysmally low 5%.200 The prevalence 
of SCD is increasing in the United States, with women now 
making up 40% of all cases.201 The frequency of SCD among 
MI survivors was lower among 1004 patients in Germany and 
Finland who receive optimized medical therapy compared with 
those who did not (1.2% versus 3.6%; P<0.01).202 Pathogenesis 
of SCD was examined in an analysis of 105 autopsy records 
from patients enrolled in the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial 
Infarction Trial (VALIANT).199 Nearly 50% of cases were 
attributed to recurrent MI (26.6%), cardiac rupture (12.4%), 
or pump failure (3.8%) within 1 month of the index MI. In 
contrast, after 3 months, SCD was attributed predominantly to 
arrhythmia. Data from this study were not disaggregated by sex. 
History of atrial fibrillation (AF) has also been associated with 
a higher incidence of ventricular fibrillation after MI. Among 
500 consecutive patients, ventricular fibrillation was higher in 
patients presenting with AF compared with those without AF. 
This study found a circadian variation in only men, with time of 
occurrence of SCD more likely during the hours of 4 and 8 am 
(13.1%) and 8 pm and midnight (19.8%; P<.05).203
Predictors of SCD
Severe left ventricular dysfunction has been associated with 
an increased risk of SCD and remains the major indication 
for implantation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators 
(ICDs).204 However, in a community-wide study of 714 
patients, a higher proportion of women had normal left ventric-
ular ejection fraction.204 Characteristics associated with nor-
mal left ventricular function and SCD included younger age, 
female sex, seizure disorder, specific medications, and a lower 
likelihood of recognized CAD.204 In a small Chinese study, 
T-wave alternans predicted SCD in post-MI patients; however, 
women were underrepresented in this study. Subanalysis by 
sex was not possible because only 10 deaths occurred.205 A 
retrospective study of 2665 cases of SCD in Greece showed 
a circadian rhythm of SCD, with the peak incidence during 
 
8 pm to midnight and a low incidence during the hours of 4 to 
8 am. This pattern was seen in both men and women but was 
not significant in women.206
Delay in Presentation
Time to Presentation
Prehospital median delay times in seeking treatment for symp-
toms of AMI have ranged from 1.4 to 53.7 hours.207,208 However, 
the majority of studies suggest the median delay ranges from 
2 to 5 hours,209 exceeding AHA recommendations by hours, 
not minutes. One study showed that women tend to call 9-1-1 
more often than men when experiencing an AMI; however, rates 
for both sexes are not optimal and suggest the need for educa-
tional initiatives to increase awareness of when to call 9-1-1.210 
Compared with young men with AMI in the VIRGO trial, young 
women who were eligible for and received reperfusion therapy 
were more likely to present with atypical chest pain or no symp-
toms (16% versus 10%; P=0.008) and more likely to present >6 
hours after symptom onset (35% versus 23%; P=0.002).16
Factors Associated With Delay
A number of studies have shown that women present later to 
treatment for AMI than men.209,211,212 In 1 study, the median 
delay time was 53.7 hours for women and 15.6 hours for 
men.213 Delays in seeking medical care for symptoms plausibly 
contribute to poorer outcomes for women.214 Delay in seeking 
treatment for AMI is often due to lack of awareness of risk, 
passivity, inaccurate symptom attribution, and barriers to self-
care.152,215 Additional factors associated with increased delay in 
seeking treatment for AMI include older age, female sex, Black 
or Hispanic race, and lower education and socioeconomic lev-
els.209 Having a history of angina, DM, hypertension, HF, or 
dyslipidemia is also associated with longer treatment-seeking 
delays. Living alone, interpreting symptoms as nonurgent and 
temporary, consulting with a physician or family member, fear, 
and embarrassment also lead to treatment-seeking delays.209
Treatment of AMI
Women are less frequently referred for appropriate treatment 
during an AMI compared with men despite proven mortal-
ity benefits of therapy. Regardless of treatment strategy with 
thrombolytic therapy or PCI, women manifest worse out-
comes than men, but this is often due to other confounding 
risk factors. Women have a more favorable outcome with PCI 
compared with thrombolytic therapy in the setting of STEMI 
and benefit from an early invasive strategy in the setting of 
a NSTEMI.216,217 Table 2 summarizes the key findings for 
the reperfusion strategies and pharmacotherapy in the treat-
ment of AMI in women. All recommendations in the table 
were derived from previously published American College of 
Cardiology (ACC)/AHA guidelines.57,216,217
STEMI Revascularization
Thrombolytic Therapy
Thrombolytic therapy, especially when administered early, 
reduces mortality regardless of sex and age.218 In the recent 
ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines, thrombolytic therapy is rec-
ommended in patients without contraindications who pres-
ent to a non–PCI-capable hospital and there is an anticipated 
delay to performing PCI within 120 minutes of first medical 
contact (Class I, Level of Evidence A)216; however, there are 
no sex-specific recommendations. Women treated with throm-
bolytics have higher morbidity and mortality rates than men, 
explained partly by worse baseline clinical profiles (includ-
ing age and rates of DM, hypertension, and HF).18,37,219,220 
In addition to increased mortality, the Global Utilization of 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 924  Circulation  March 1, 2016
Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded 
Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial showed that women have 
more nonfatal complications such as shock, HF, reinfarc-
tion, recurrent ischemia, bleeding, and stroke compared with 
men.15 The increased risk of reinfarction in women was con-
firmed in the Assessment of the Safety of a New Thrombolytic 
(ASSENT-2) trial and was associated with less aggressive 
management and higher mortality compared with men.221 
The use of enoxaparin as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy 
reduced the 30-day rate of death and reinfarction in women 
but increased the risk of bleeding.222 Despite these clinical out-
come differences, thrombolytic success as judged by 90-min-
ute patency rates and global ejection fraction (immediate and 
at day 7) was similar between women and men in the GUSTO 
trial.220 Conversely, there was greater hyperkinesis of the non-
infarct zone and a trend for higher reocclusion (8.7% versus 
5.1%; P=0.14) in women after thrombolytic therapy.
Women are at particular higher risk of bleeding complica-
tions, and in the GUSTO-1 trial, the risk of moderate or severe 
bleeding was increased 1.43-fold in women.15 Female sex is an 
independent predictor of intracranial bleeding with thrombolytic 
therapy.223 Moreover, women often have multiple relative contra-
indications (advanced age, hypertension, and small body size) that 
make physicians reluctant to use thrombolytic therapy in female 
patients. There was no significant increase in severe bleeding in 
menstruating women compared with nonmenstruating women.224 
There was, however, a significant increase in moderate bleeding 
that was offset by the benefits of fibrinolytic therapy.
Overall, thrombolytics are beneficial and have been shown 
to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity within 12 
hours of symptom onset. Fibrinolytics have an important role 
in the treatment of STEMI patients without contraindications 
to thrombolytics who have an anticipated delay of >120 min-
utes to a PCI-capable facility.216
Primary PCI
Complications of thrombolytic therapy and its perceived lack 
of eligibility have limited its use in most developed countries. 
Because women have the most complications from thrombo-
lytic therapy, it would stand to reason that they benefit the 
most from primary PCI. A pooled analysis of 22 trials225 that 
randomized 6763 STEMI patients to primary PCI versus 
thrombolytics found that women had lower 30-day mortal-
ity with primary PCI, regardless of whether they presented 
within the first 2 hours of symptom onset (7.7% versus 9.6%) 
or after >2-hour delay (8.5% versus 14.4%). Of note was the 
extremely high mortality in women with delay in presentation 
treated with thrombolytic therapy.
Use of primary angioplasty virtually eliminates the risk 
of intracranial bleeding and was an independent predictor of 
survival in women.226 The greater mortality benefit of primary 
PCI compared with thrombolytic therapy was confirmed in 
the GUSTO II-B angioplasty substudy, with primary PCI pre-
venting 56 deaths in women compared with 42 deaths in men 
per 1000 treated.227 Despite the improved prognosis in women 
treated with primary PCI, a recent meta-analysis of observa-
tional studies reported that even after adjustment for baseline 
differences, women have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality 
(relative risk, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–2.05).228

 Mehta et al  Acute Myocardial Infarction in Women  925
Although primary PCI has a reduced risk of intracranial 
bleeding compared with thrombolytic therapy, women remain 
at higher risk of non–central nervous system bleeding events. 
Vascular complications and the need for blood transfusions 
occur more frequently in women, even when weight-adjusted 
antithrombin agents are used,229,230 and female sex remains an 
independent predictor of bleeding.231
Although early-generation stenting was associated with 
higher mortality in women,232 later studies found that bare 
metal stenting during primary PCI compared with angioplasty 
in women reduced MACE rates and target vessel revascu-
larization, without influencing death or reinfarction rates.229 
A patient-level pooled analysis comparing stent choice in 
women found that newer-generation drug eluting stents (DES) 
were associated with reduced death or MI and reduced target 
vessel revascularization compared with both early-generation 
DES and bare metal stents; however, these data were not 
exclusively from STEMI patients.233
CABG Surgery
Although multivessel disease is observed in 50% of STEMI 
patients who undergo urgent catheterization, use of emergency 
CABG during AMI is extremely rare. Typically, the culprit vessel 
is treated with primary PCI if the culprit vessel is occluded. Once 
patency is restored, the patient may be reassessed for CABG at a 
later time. No sex-specific studies were found addressing STEMI 
patients undergoing CABG; therefore, studies of all-comers were 
reviewed. Both a systematic review of 23 published CABG stud-
ies that reported data stratified by sex234 and a mandatory registry 
of 40 000 patients undergoing CABG in California235 showed that 
women are older and sicker at the time of CABG. Adjusting for 
baseline differences reduced, but did not eliminate, an increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality in women. Moreover, women were 
less likely to receive an internal mammary graft235 and had 
more postoperative complications such as renal failure neuro-
logical complications, and postoperative MI.236
NSTEMI Revascularization
Women with NSTEMI have more complications than men, 
including bleeding, HF, shock, renal failure, reinfarction, 
stroke, and readmission. Numerous studies have found that 
women benefit from invasive management of NSTEMI,237–239 
and in the recent ACC/AHA NSTEMI guidelines, an early 
invasive strategy is a Class I, Level of Evidence A recom-
mendation in women with high-risk features.217 This recom-
mendation is based on several studies using post hoc sex 
analyses239–241 and a meta-analysis238 that demonstrated a 
significant reduction in death and MI at 1 year with an early 
invasive strategy in women with high-risk features. The meta-
analysis also showed a significant 33% reduction in death, MI, 
or rehospitalization for ACS (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.50–0.88) in women treated invasively. Evidence-
based guidelines recommend that myocardial revascular-
ization is reasonable in pregnant women with NSTEMI if 
medical therapy was ineffective for the management of life-
threatening complications (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).217
Studies investigating the use of DES found no sex differ-
ences in short- and long-term outcomes, including cardiac 
death, AMI, MACEs, or target vessel revascularization.242–244 
Recent pooled data show that newer-generation DES have a 
better safety and efficacy profile compared with older-gener-
ation DES and bare metal stents.233 However, these data on 
DES are not specific to AMI patients.
Women with NSTEMI who undergo CABG have more 
postoperative complications such as need for vasopressors, 
intra-aortic balloon pump, ventilator support, dialysis, and 
transfusions,27,234,235,242–244 but the long-term risk of death, MI, 
or stroke is similar between women and men.245 Although 
some of the early randomized, clinical trials found that a 
higher event rate in the invasive arm was due to complications 
from CABG in women,240 more recent studies suggest a more 
favorable prognosis in women who require CABG.246
Medical Therapies
The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce morbidity and 
mortality, to prevent complications, and to improve quality 
of life. The core post-MI medications are antiplatelet agents, 
β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), and statins.216,217 The efficacy and safety of these 
medications have been established through rigorous random-
ized, clinical trials that have included both men and women. 
Firm data on sex differences in treatment efficacy and safety 
are somewhat limited because many post-MI intervention tri-
als enrolled few women. However, similar benefits have been 
observed regardless of sex. The 2014 ACC/AHA NSTEMI 
guidelines recommend that women with NSTEMI be treated 
with the same pharmacological agents as those used in men 
for both acute care and secondary prevention of MI.217 This 
is a Class I, Level of Evidence B recommendation that also 
recommends consideration of weight and renal dosing of 
antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents because of the higher 
bleeding risks in women.8,247–249 Despite this evidence for effi-
cacy, observational studies show consistent underuse of these 
guideline-recommended therapies among women compared 
with men with AMI.8,30,250 Women with nonobstructive CAD 
and MI are less likely to be prescribed medications for sec-
ondary prevention of MI (including antiplatelet agents and 
statins),251 and these women have increased rates of readmis-
sion, reinfarction, and death in the first year after MI.252–254
Equally important for women after AMI is the discontinua-
tion of harmful drugs or drugs that are of no benefit. Hormone 
therapy with estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone should 
not be given de novo to postmenopausal women after AMI 
for secondary prevention of coronary events. Furthermore, 
postmenopausal women who are already taking estrogen plus 
progestin or estrogen alone at the time of their MI, in general, 
should discontinue taking these agents.216,217 If women wish to 
continue hormone therapy for another compelling indication, 
they should weigh the risks and benefits, recognizing the greater 
risk of cardiovascular events. Antioxidant vitamin supplements 
(eg, vitamins E and C and beta-carotene) and folic acid, with or 
without B6 and B12, should not be used for secondary prevention 
after MI because there is no evidence of benefit.57,216,217
Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulant Therapy
In secondary prevention trials, the benefit of aspirin in prevent-
ing recurrent ischemic events was similar in men and women.

 926  Circulation  March 1, 2016
The Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) 
trial found that the reduction in vascular mortality with aspi-
rin versus placebo therapy after AMI was 22% for men and 
slightly lower at 16% for women.255 In a 2009 meta-analysis, 
placebo-controlled secondary prevention trials that compared 
antiplatelet therapy (primarily aspirin) with placebo were ana-
lyzed in men and women.256 Antiplatelet agents were found to 
reduce the overall risk of any serious vascular event by 19% 
and to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by 22%. A meta-
analysis of randomized, clinical trials of aspirin documented 
that among both men and women with prior vascular disease, 
aspirin treatment reduced the risk of subsequent cardiovascu-
lar events by ≈25%.257 Studies have compared the efficacy of 
aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in men versus women. In 
an analysis evaluating 11 265 patients with a history of MI and 
6765 patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease (tran-
sient ischemic attack or stroke), aspirin reduced the risk of a 
major coronary event—nonfatal MI or coronary death—to a 
similar degree in men and women (19% reduction in men and 
25% reduction in women) and reduced the risk of stroke (17% 
reduction in men and 22% reduction in women) to a similar 
degree.258 The Clopidogrel and Aspirin Optimal Dose Usage 
to Reduce Recurrent Events−Seventh Organization to Assess 
Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes (CURRENT-OASIS 7) trial 
showed no significant difference in the composite risk of car-
diovascular death, MI, and stroke between higher- (300–325 
mg daily) and lower- (75–100 mg daily) maintenance-dose 
aspirin among ACS patients; consistent treatment effects were 
seen among men and women in prespecified subgroup analy-
ses (interaction P=0.59).259
In a meta-analysis of 5 large randomized, clinical trials, 
clopidogrel treatment was associated with a significant over-
all cardiovascular risk reduction compared with placebo in 
both men and women. Women made up 20% to 39% of the 
total population in these studies. However, the reduction in 
risk among women was significant only for MI, not for stroke 
or all-cause mortality, whereas significant reductions in all 
3 end points were seen for men. There was no statistically 
significant heterogeneity when the effect of clopidogrel was 
compared between the sexes, suggesting that this observa-
tion could be the result of chance alone.260 For higher-potency 
P2Y12 receptor inhibitors such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, no 
significant interaction with sex was observed in studies of the 
effect of each drug on MACEs.261–263
A significant interaction between treatment and sex has 
been observed in trials of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors with 
respect to cardiovascular events. Although glycoprotein IIb/
IIIa inhibitor use was associated with a significantly lower 
incidence of death or MI at 30 days compared with placebo 
among men with ACS, women had worse outcomes with 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor treatment.264,265 When risk was 
further stratified by troponin level, no sex differences were 
seen. More recent studies in the setting of concurrent clopido-
grel use have not shown sex-related differences in outcomes 
associated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use.265 Among 
STEMI patients, early glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use was 
associated with enhanced patency of the infarct-related artery 
before primary PCI and improved epicardial flow and reduced 
mortality after primary PCI in women.266
Anticoagulant therapy prevents thrombus formation at 
the site of arterial injury and reduces thrombotic complica-
tions during PCI and is, according to the ACC/AHA guide-
lines, a Class I recommendation for STEMI216 and NSTEMI217 
patients, regardless of the revascularization strategy. Early 
studies conducted primarily in the era before the routine use of 
early invasive strategies and dual antiplatelet therapy showed 
a reduction in cardiovascular events with the addition of 
unfractionated heparin to aspirin therapy.267 Low-molecular-
weight heparins were found to have similar efficacy among 
patients with NSTEMI ACS and those with STEMI treated 
with fibrinolysis compared with unfractionated heparin.268–270 
The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin was also found to be 
noninferior to either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight 
heparin in combination with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
among NSTEMI ACS patients and reduced cardiovascular 
death among STEMI patients. Bivalirudin is not considered a 
preferred agent over the combination of unfractionated hepa-
rin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the NSTEMI and 
STEMI guidelines, with the exception of patients undergoing 
PCI who are at a high risk of bleeding. In those patients, it 
is reasonable to use bivalirudin monotherapy in preference to 
these agents.216,217,271,272 Patients treated with fondaparinux, a 
selective factor Xa inhibitor, had ischemic outcomes similar to 
those treated with enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin.273,274 
Sex differences in the effectiveness of these anticoagulants 
have not been well described. In the Acute Catheterization 
and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial, no 
differences were observed in the 1-year composite ischemia 
or mortality end point in women who received bivalirudin ver-
sus heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.248 Prespecified 
subgroup analyses for fondaparinux also showed no signifi-
cant differences in efficacy between men and women.273
Antiplatelet therapy is of proven benefit in the treatment 
of women after MI. Antiplatelet therapy has also been shown 
to be safe; however, women have significantly higher rates of 
bleeding after MI than men.216 The 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI 
guidelines state that female sex is a risk factor for bleeding 
complications after STEMI, but there are no sex-specific 
recommendations for indications for the use of antiplatelet 
or anticoagulant therapies.216 The recent 2014 ACC/AHA 
NSTEMI-ACS guidelines recommend that women receive 
pharmacotherapy similar to that given to men in the acute set-
ting of an NSTEMI and for secondary prevention; however, 
to reduce bleeding risk in women, careful attention to weight 
and renal function when dosing antiplatelet and anticoagu-
lant agents is warranted (Class I, Level of Evidence B).217 
Clinicians should also be cognizant that in premenopausal 
women who are still menstruating, antiplatelet therapy may 
significantly increase menstrual bleeding.217
β-Blockers
β-Blocker therapy after MI has been associated with improved 
outcomes.275 Treatment with a β-blocker decreases the inci-
dence of ventricular arrhythmias, recurrent ischemia, reinfarc-
tion, infarct size, and mortality. Treatment with β-blockers is 
associated with a 21% reduction in mortality, a 30% reduc-
tion in sudden death, and a 25% lower reinfarction rate,276,277 
with reportedly similar benefits in women and men in some 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 Mehta et al  Acute Myocardial Infarction in Women  927
studies.278 Despite this evidence of benefit, β-blockers, like 
other cardiovascular therapies, are often underused in women.8 
Nonselective β-blockers should be avoided in patients whose 
AMI is due to coronary arterial vasospasm because these 
medications can exacerbate vasospasm, which is probably 
explained by the blockade of vasodilator coronary β2 recep-
tors, resulting in unopposed vasoconstrictor α-adrenergic 
receptors.118
ACE Inhibitors/ARBs
Use of ACE inhibitors has been shown in numerous random-
ized, clinical trials to improve survival and to attenuate left 
ventricular dilatation after MI.279–282 ARBs have been shown 
to be as effective as ACE inhibitors and are considered an 
alternative treatment option.283 Women are underrepresented 
in trials examining ACE inhibitors and ARBs in post-MI care, 
and no sex-specific trials have been found. A meta-analysis of 
ACE inhibitor studies demonstrated a favorable trend toward 
improved survival (13.14% versus 20.1%) and in the com-
bined end point of mortality and hospitalization (20.2% ver-
sus 29.5%) in women treated with ACE inhibitors compared 
with those not on the drug.284 Another meta-analysis showed 
that both women and men with symptomatic HF benefit from 
ACE inhibitors. However, in asymptomatic HF patients, a sig-
nificant mortality benefit was not seen in women but was seen 
in men.285
ACE inhibitors taken during pregnancy have been 
reported to cause congenital malformations, stillbirths, and 
neonatal deaths and thus are contraindicated. The number 
of drug-related adverse events has been considerably lower 
with ARBs than ACE inhibitors,286 but the risks of hyperkale-
mia,287 renal dysfunction,288 and teratogenicity289 are equiva-
lent between ARBs and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs are pregnancy category C (animal studies have shown 
an adverse effect on the fetus) for the first trimester of preg-
nancy and are labeled pregnancy category D (human fetal risk 
has been shown) during the second and third trimesters.
Statins
Statin therapy is another mainstay of post-MI pharmaco-
therapy. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) 
trial, a secondary prevention study of 4444 patients who had 
angina or prior MI and elevated cholesterol, showed a rela-
tive risk of cardiac death of 0.70 in subjects randomized to 
receive statin.290 In a subgroup analysis of 420 women in the 
treatment group, the relative risk of CHD mortality was 0.86 
(95% confidence interval, 0.42–1.74) compared with 407 
women on placebo. Another large statin trial, the Cholesterol 
and Recurrent Events (CARE) study, evaluated 4159 subjects 
with prior MI but only modestly elevated cholesterol levels 
and found that after 5 years of treatment with a statin, both 
men and women had fewer cardiovascular events.291 In a sub-
study of 576 women in the CARE trial, within 6 to 12 months 
after therapy began, women randomized to a statin had a 43% 
lower risk in death resulting from CHD and a 57% reduction 
in recurrent MI. A secondary prevention trial, the Long-Term 
Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) 
study, analyzed a subgroup of 1516 women and found that 
women experienced a benefit from lipid-lowering therapy 
with a statin similar to that seen in men.292 In the Pravastatin or 
Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy–Thrombolysis 
in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial, which 
included 21.9% women, intensive therapy in women was 
associated with a significant 25% relative reduction in the pri-
mary composite end point in women compared with a 14% 
reduction in men. There were no sex-related differences with 
respect to safety.293
These studies demonstrate a beneficial role of statin ther-
apy in patients at risk for CHD, regardless of sex. A meta-
analysis found that statin therapy was an effective secondary 
prevention intervention in both men and women but that 
there was no benefit on stroke or all-cause mortality among 
women.294 A recent study evaluating the impact of sex on 
lipid lowering, cardiovascular events, and adverse events in 
6 large, randomized, clinical trials found that changes in lip-
ids were similar in men and women.295 In women but not 
men, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant 
predictor of stroke. Discontinuation rates resulting from 
adverse events were higher in women in most of the trials 
reviewed. It is important to note that all statins are pregnancy 
category X, meaning studies in animals or humans have 
demonstrated fetal abnormalities, so they must not be used 
during pregnancy.
Nonpharmacological Treatment
Cardiac Rehabilitation Referral and Participation
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an essential component of com-
prehensive care after AMI, is internationally endorsed,296–300 is 
integrated in effectiveness-based guidelines for women,57 and 
reveals incontrovertible morbidity and mortality benefits.301–304 
CR after AMI is a Class I recommendation in evidence-based 
guidelines.57,216,217,305,306 Although referral to CR is designated 
as a performance measure of healthcare quality after AMI,307,308 
CR has failed to reach >80% of eligible women in the last 3 
decades.57,296,299,300,307,309 Women particularly absent from CR 
include the uninsured, unmarried, socioeconomically disad-
vantaged, smokers, depressed, obese, sedentary, elderly, and 
nonwhite and those with less education, less social support, 
and competing family obligations.310–317 Depressive symp-
toms are linked to suboptimal CR attendance, and depressed 
women have a 2-fold increased risk of noncompletion.318–320 
Evidence suggests that CR exercise training improves depres-
sion in women.320,321
The prevailing paradigm of CR is based largely on research 
conducted in men.303 Therefore, interventions for increasing 
CR referral, enrollment, and adherence of women are scarce, 
although tailored approaches increase the likelihood of suc-
cess.322,323 Even with a CR referral, women participate in CR 
and complete it less frequently than men. Patient-oriented, 
medical, and healthcare system factors variably account for 
poor CR attendance among eligible women.300,315,324–326 A 
primary predictor of dismal attendance is lack of physician 
endorsement of CR.324,327
Novel strategies for secondary prevention for women, an 
underserved segment of CR populations, are warranted, given 
their adverse psychosocial profiles and poor completion rates.

 928  Circulation  March 1, 2016
One recent randomized, controlled trial examined the effects 
of a motivationally enhanced CR designed exclusively for 
women with CHD compared with traditional CR on physi-
ological and psychosocial outcomes.328 Women completing 
the tailored intervention had significantly improved qual-
ity of life and depressive symptoms that were sustained at 6 
months compared with those completing traditional CR.320,329 
The tailored intervention also improved 4 dimensions of 
health: vitality, social functioning, general health, and mental 
health.330 Compared with traditional CR, the tailored interven-
tion resulted in significantly greater attendance and higher 
completion rates.
Home-based CR models may be an effective and realistic 
alternative or supplement for women with significant barriers 
to attending structured outpatient programs. Novel healthcare 
models using mobile phones, the Internet, and other com-
munication technologies to deliver CR services to patients in 
their homes are being investigated.331–333
Sexual Counseling
Sexual dysfunction among women after an AMI has received 
less attention compared with counseling for men,334 and few 
AMI patients receive adequate information about sexual 
health and sexual activity.335–337 In the VIRGO study, only 
12% of young women reported discussing sexual activ-
ity with a physician in the month after AMI.338 Those who 
did were commonly given restrictions on sexual activity not 
supported by evidence-based guidelines. Guidelines for the 
safe return to sexual activity are available to assist health-
care professionals to provide individualized and culturally 
sensitive sexual counseling.339,340 Women recovering from an 
AMI require information specific to their concerns, which 
might include vaginal dryness, decreased libido, orgas-
mic problems, or adverse drug effects. Psychological fac-
tors, including fear, anxiety, and depression, can negatively 
influence the resumption of sexual activity of women and 
their partners after an AMI. Sexual counseling with cogni-
tive behavioral techniques should begin with a face-to-face 
discussion with both the patient and partner to ensure that 
sexual problems are addressed and that both receive the 
same counseling information and benefit from the education 
and support of the healthcare team.336 Discussions can be 
supplemented with pamphlets and other resources provided 
for review in the outpatient setting. CR is an ideal setting in 
which to discuss sexual activity within the context of exer-
cise recommendations.
Complications After AMI
Complication rates after MI are higher in women than in men 
despite similar success rates with treatment. Women with AMI 
are more likely to suffer from bleeding complications, which 
are often secondary to pharmacological therapies or invasive 
procedures. Mechanical complications and HF are more likely 
to develop in women, whereas ventricular arrhythmias occur 
at similar rates in both sexes after an AMI. Aside from tradi-
tional prognostic risk factors, psychosocial risk factors have 
now also been implicated in the development of adverse out-
comes in post-MI women.
Bleeding Complications
Antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents are central to the treat-
ment of AMI in women, but they also pose risks of bleed-
ing. Data from 24 045 patients of the Global Registry of 
Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) trial indicated that women 
versus men had a 43% increased risk of bleeding during hos-
pitalization341; the risk appears to be even higher in the set-
ting of STEMI (odds ratio, 1.71). Women undergoing PCI 
also showed a significantly higher incidence of in-hospital 
major bleeding, including access-related complications, com-
pared with men.249 This increased bleeding risk appears to be 
related at least in part to inappropriate dosing of antithrom-
botic therapies.342 In these analyses, women had a higher risk 
for bleeding with antithrombotic therapy independently of 
age, weight, baseline blood pressure, renal function, baseline 
hematocrit, and other potential confounders. Most bleeding is 
procedure related and is associated with high morbidity and 
mortality.343–345 Vascular access site bleeding is the most com-
mon type of bleeding after STEMI, and trials have identified 
female sex as one of the risk factors for femoral access site 
bleeding.346 Other factors associated with access site bleeding 
are larger sheath size, postprocedural heparin use, higher acti-
vated clotting times, and late postprocedural sheath removal.
In studies of fibrinolytic therapy for AMI, women have 
significantly more bleeding than men. Female sex, even after 
adjustment for the presence of other factors, is a potent pre-
dictor of bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage.319,347 In 
multivariate analyses, the 3 most powerful independent pre-
dictors of hemorrhage are older age, lower body weight, and 
female sex.
Lifelong antiplatelet therapy is recommended for women 
after MI. Several antiplatelet therapies have specific dosing 
instructions by age, weight, and renal function of the patient.348 
For women, careful monitoring of antithrombotic therapy 
has been shown to decrease bleeding.349,350 The effectiveness 
of various bleeding avoidance strategies (vascular closure 
devices, bivalirudin, radial access, and combined approach) 
was studied in a large cohort of >500 000 from the CathPCI 
registry. Investigators found that the use of any bleeding 
avoidance strategy differed slightly between women and men 
(75.4% versus 75.7%; P=0.01) and that women had signifi-
cantly higher rates of bleeding than men when bleeding avoid-
ance strategies were not used (12.5% versus 6.2%; P<0.01).351 
The Study of Access Site for Enhancement of PCI for Women 
(SAFE-PCI) was the first randomized trial of specific PCI 
access strategies that was exclusive to women only. The trial 
demonstrated reductions in bleeding or vascular complica-
tions with the radial access approach in women undergoing 
elective or urgent cardiac catheterization. Fewer than 7% of 
patients were converted from radial to femoral approach as 
a result of arterial spasm. In a subgroup analysis of women 
undergoing PCI, radial access showed a trend toward benefit 
but did not significantly reduce bleeding or vascular compli-
cations. A major limitation of this study is the early termina-
tion of enrollment because of lower-than-expected bleeding or 
vascular complication rates; as a result, the PCI cohort sample 
size was much smaller than expected.352
Women continue to have almost twice the rate of bleeding 
after PCI as men.249,353 It is prudent to pay careful attention 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 Mehta et al  Acute Myocardial Infarction in Women  929
to body weight, renal function, and dosing guidelines in 
women.349,350 It is also important to continue evaluating for 
effective strategies to limit post-PCI bleeding in women.
Cardiogenic Shock
Cardiogenic shock (CS) associated with AMI is most often 
due to pump failure in the setting of extensive anterior 
AMI.354,355 Other causes of CS include mechanical complica-
tions of AMI and right ventricular infarct.357 CS usually occurs 
within 24 hours of presentation and carries a mortality rate of 
48% to 70%.354,356–358 Early revascularization has been shown 
to reduce mortality from AMI-associated CS and may account 
for the recent reduction in in-hospital mortality attributed to 
CS.357–362
Women are at increased risk of developing CS in the set-
ting of AMI despite presenting with less extensive CAD and 
smaller infarct size.15,354,363,364 Patient factors that may con-
tribute to the increased prevalence of CS in women with MI 
include older age, higher rates of DM and hypertension, and 
higher incidence of underlying HF.9,247,365–369 Given the signifi-
cant mortality benefit of early revascularization in the setting 
of AMI-associated CS, early revascularization (PCI or CABG) 
is recommended for all patients without contraindication who 
develop CS as a result of pump failure after AMI.359,362,370 The 
use of an intra-aortic balloon pump is reasonable for hemo-
dynamic support for women with CS that does not quickly 
stabilize with pharmacological therapy. Those patients with 
refractory shock may be considered candidates for circulatory 
support with alternative left ventricular assist devices.357,360
Heart Failure
Women are more likely to develop symptoms of HF in 
the setting of AMI.15,247,371 Several studies have identified 
that women have a higher Killip class at presentation for 
AMI.9,363,372 This may be related to higher rates of underlying 
hypertension, DM, and HF or may be due to longer delay in 
presentation to the hospital.12,14,15,247,365–369 Given the signifi-
cant mortality benefit of early revascularization for patients 
with ACS, women with AMI-associated HF should undergo 
early angiography with subsequent risk stratification and 
revascularization when appropriate.216,217,354 Medical stabili-
zation with diuretics, vasodilators, inotropes, and percutane-
ous mechanical support should be provided when clinically 
indicated.216,217,357,360
Even after adjustment for age, comorbidities, and disease 
severity, several studies have identified that women with AMI 
are less likely to receive appropriate medications on presen-
tation or at hospital discharge, including ACE inhibitors, 
β-blockers, and statins.8–10 In the absence of contraindications, 
STEMI patients with anterior location, HF, or reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction of <40% should receive an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB within 24 hours of presentation.216,217 After 
stabilization of HF, women with AMI-associated HF should 
receive a β-blocker.216,217 If women with AMI-associated 
HF are receiving therapeutic doses of an ACE inhibitor and 
β-blocker and have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, 
they should be prescribed an aldosterone antagonist in the 
absence of contraindications.216,217
Mechanical Complications
Mechanical complications account for 12% of cases of AMI-
associated CS.354 Mechanical complications after AMI are 
associated with high mortality rates and usually require urgent 
surgical intervention.354,373–375 Women are at a higher risk of 
developing mechanical complications after MI, but sex-spe-
cific data on treatment are sparse.
Women are at increased risk of developing acute severe 
mitral regurgitation after AMI.373 Acute severe mitral regur-
gitation represents 7% of all cases of AMI-associated CS and 
can be related to papillary muscle rupture or post-AMI left 
ventricular remodeling with displacement of the papillary 
muscles and tethering of the mitral valve leaflets.354,373,376,377 
Acute severe mitral regurgitation often occurs within 24 
hours of presentation, results in rapid hemodynamic deterio-
ration, and carries a mortality rate of 55%.354,373,378 Emergent 
surgery should be pursued for suitable surgical candidates 
with papillary muscle rupture.373 Medical therapies and intra-
aortic balloon pump or other mechanical support devices are 
indicated for stabilization while the patient awaits surgery.216 
Mitral valve replacement is usually necessary owing to the 
presence of friable tissues.373 Ischemic mitral regurgitation 
often can be treated with early revascularization and medical 
therapy, although mitral valve repair or replacement may be 
necessary.216
Women, older patients, and nonsmokers are at increased 
risk of ventricular septal rupture after AMI.375,379 Ventricular 
septal rupture complicates <1% of all AMIs but accounts 
for 4% of AMI-associated shock.354,379,380 It usually occurs 
within 24 hours of presentation, often in patients with no 
history of MI.375,379 Without surgical intervention, the mor-
tality rate is 94% to 100%.375,379,381 With surgical repair, 
30-day mortality improves to 45% to 80%.375,379,381 Because 
of the significant mortality benefit of surgical repair of 
AMI-associated ventricular septal rupture, urgent surgery 
is indicated.216
Left ventricular free wall rupture and tamponade are 
more common in women after AMI.382–384 Older age, ante-
rior AMI, and delayed thrombolysis are additional risk fac-
tors.374,382,383,385 Primary PCI is protective against free wall 
rupture, likely because of the reduction in hemorrhagic 
transformation of the infarcted myocardium.384 Although the 
incidence of free wall rupture is low, complicating <1% of 
AMI and representing 1.4% of AMI-associated CS, it carries 
a 55% to 60% mortality rate and is the second most common 
cause of death after left ventricular pump failure following 
AMI.354,374,382–384 Most cases of free wall rupture occur within 
1 week of AMI.384 Free wall rupture often presents dramati-
cally, with abrupt development of electromechanical disso-
ciation and asystole, sometimes immediately preceded by 
recurrent chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG.384,386 
In a small, prospective study of subacute ruptures, approxi-
mately one third of ruptures did not have signs of tamponade 
initially when the rupture site was sealed; this is an important 
cohort of patients to identify early for successful treatment 
of a potential lethal complication of AMI.387 Although there 
is some evidence that women may be less likely to survive 
cardiac rupture than men, immediate surgery is indicated for 
all women with free wall rupture.374,384

Arrhythmias
Women and men appear to be at similar risk for the devel-
opment of ventricular arrhythmias after AMI.388 Ventricular 
arrhythmias occur in 6% to 10% of patients with AMI.388,389 
Both early (<2 days) and late (>2 days) ventricular arrhyth-
mias are associated with increased mortality, with late 
arrhythmias carrying a worse prognosis.388,389 Peri-infarction 
β-blockers have been associated with reduced incidence of 
ventricular arrhythmias.390 In the absence of contraindi-
cation, women with AMI should be started on β-blocker 
therapy within 24 hours of presentation.217 Women with 
sustained ventricular arrhythmias occurring >48 hours after 
AMI, in the absence of other reversible causes, should have 
an ICD placed before hospital discharge for secondary pre-
vention of SCD.391–394 Women with reduced ejection frac-
tion after AMI should be reassessed for ICD candidacy for 
primary prevention of SCD ≥40 days after discharge.394–396 
Currently, there are no sex-specific guidelines with respect 
to ICD use; however, women are less likely to receive an 
ICD for primary or secondary prevention of SCD compared 
with men.397 Substudies of large, randomized trials have 
shown lower appropriate ICD shock rates in women com-
pared with men; however, there are variable results in terms 
of ICD mortality benefit, perhaps a result of the low num-
ber of women in these post hoc substudies.398,399 Two meta-
analyses have shown contradictory results for all-cause 
mortality benefit in women with ICDs.400,401 Additionally, 
women have a better prognosis after cardiac resynchroni-
zation therapy compared with men.402 Women were under-
represented in these ICD trials, once again highlighting the 
need for increased enrollment of women in clinical trials or 
sex-specific trials.
New-onset AF occurs in 6% to 9% of patients with AMI 
and is associated with HF, CS, stroke, and increased 90-day 
mortality.380,403 Women and older patients are at increased risk 
of developing AF in the setting of AMI.403 Stroke prevention in 
this setting can be challenging, given the requirements for dual 
antiplatelet therapy after stent placement. Anticoagulation on 
hospital discharge in patients with AMI-associated AF has 
been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke and mortality.403 
For suitable candidates with AMI-associated AF and risk fac-
tors for stroke, anticoagulation should be considered on hos-
pital discharge with an understanding that fatal and nonfatal 
bleeding risks will be high.404
Overall, 7% of patients hospitalized with AMI develop 
significant bradyarrhythmias.380,405 Women are at increased 
risk for developing high-degree atrioventricular block in the 
setting of AMI.405 Atrioventricular block complicates 12% to 
13% of patients presenting with an inferior MI and is asso-
ciated with increased 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortal-
ity.405–407 Bradyarrhythmias associated with inferior AMI are 
usually self-limited, but temporary pacing should be used 
for symptomatic bradycardia refractory to medical manage-
ment.216,408 When high-degree atrioventricular block is associ-
ated with anterior AMI, the prognosis is significantly worse, 
likely reflecting greater extent of infarct.405 In this setting, pro-
phylactic temporary pacemaker placement is recommended.216 
Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated only for per-
sistent high-degree atrioventricular block.409
Prognostic Factors for Adverse 
Outcomes After AMI
Markers of Disease Severity
Little is known about prognostic factors for adverse outcomes 
after MI specific for women. A number of risk prediction 
models that incorporate routinely measured medical history 
factors and clinical severity indicators such as the GRACE410 
and TIMI411 scores are commonly used in patients with ACS. 
However, they were developed in patient populations that 
were at least two thirds male; their performance in women is 
not well established. In a study of patients presenting to the 
emergency department with chest pain, the TIMI risk score 
performed well in both men and women for the prediction 
of death or MI at 30 days.412 In another recent study, prog-
nostic indicators such as left ventricular ejection fraction and 
ECG parameters (heart rate, heart rate variability, non–sinus 
rhythm, and QRS width) predicted 5-year mortality in both 
women and men, but there were some differences in magni-
tude of effects between women and men. For example, the 
absence of sinus rhythm was associated with a hazard ratio of 
7.6 in women and 3.2 in men.413
Presentation Characteristics
Women with MI who present without chest pain41 and with a 
STEMI43 have a higher risk of hospital death in all age groups. 
The absence of chest pain appears to be a stronger marker 
of mortality risk among women than men, especially among 
young women.41 Compared with NSTEMI, STEMI is also a 
more robust short-term prognostic indicator in women than 
in men, with higher mortality rates in the initial 24 hours of 
hospitalization.10,99 DM is another powerful prognostic factor 
after MI among women, approximately doubling their risk of 
long-term mortality; again, this effect is larger in women than 
in men.414,415
Age
Although age is a potent prognostic indicator after MI in all 
patients, the relationship between age and mortality after 
MI is less pronounced in women than in men. The reason 
is that young women, that is, those who experience early-
onset MI (before ≈60 years of age), have a higher short-term 
mortality than men in the same age group; this difference 
declines with age.9,37,416 This disparity is also seen after hos-
pital discharge up to 2 years39 but is less evident in the long-
term after ≥5 years.17
Traditional Coronary Risk Factors
Women hospitalized with an AMI have a high prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, hypercho-
lesterolemia, current smoking, DM, and obesity, which are 
established prognostic indicators. Black women have espe-
cially high risks. Among 2369 AMI patients from 19 centers, 
72% of patients had ≥2 risk factors and 40% had ≥3; black 
women had the largest risk factor burden of any subgroup, 
with 60% of older black women and 54% of younger black 
women having ≥3 risk factors.72 Despite their elevated risk 
factor profile, black women and black men were less likely 
than their white counterparts to receive secondary prevention

efforts such as smoking cessation counseling and antihyper-
tensive and lipid-lowering medications.
Psychosocial Risk Factors
Women with MI, especially young women with early-onset 
MI, have a disproportional burden of psychosocial risk fac-
tors, even though indicators of AMI severity are similar or 
more favorable in women compared with men of similar age 
or older women.417,418 Emerging evidence links psychosocial 
factors to adverse outcomes in patients with ischemic heart 
disease, especially depression, which is now a recognized 
prognostic factor after ACS.419 The prevalence of depression 
is ≈20% in post-MI patients, several times higher than in the 
general population, and is about twice as high in women with 
MI as in men with MI.419 Depression is especially common in 
young female MI patients (<60 years old).417,418,420 Fifty per-
cent of post-MI women ≤50 years of age and >40% of post-MI 
women between 50 and 60 years of age meet the diagnostic 
criteria for major depression.418 Among women with MI or 
other forms of ischemic heart disease, depression is associ-
ated with an ≈3-fold increased risk for death or subsequent 
cardiac events independently of severity of depression.421–423 
In addition to having high levels of depression, women with 
premature MI are often from minority groups and have high 
rates of poverty and trauma exposure during childhood, espe-
cially sexual abuse.418
Marital stress is an understudied but potentially important 
risk factor for recurrent events in post-MI women. A series 
of studies of Scandinavian women with ACS have demon-
strated robust associations of marital stress with subsequent 
cardiac events424 and with progression of CAD measured with 
quantitative coronary angiography.425 Conversely, social sup-
port appears to be an important mitigating factor in post-MI 
recovery among women; those with higher social support 
experience better mental functioning, better quality of life, 
and fewer depressive symptoms at 12 months.426
Young women in the VIRGO trial reported poorer physi-
cal and mental health functioning, more symptoms of angina, 
and poorer quality of life over a 12-month period after AMI 
compared with men of a similar age.427 The future challenge is 
to determine what interventions would mitigate deterioration 
in perceived health status among young women in the year 
after AMI.
Consistent with an important prognostic role of psychoso-
cial stress in women with AMI, myocardial ischemia caused 
by emotional stress, induced experimentally through a stan-
dardized mental stress test, is common in women with isch-
emic heart disease, especially young women after MI. Studies 
of patients with stable CHD have reported higher rates of 
mental stress–induced ischemia, assessed by echocardiogra-
phy, in women than men.428 Such differences are even more 
pronounced among young post-MI patients. Women up to 50 
years of age who have survived an MI in the past 6 months 
show twice the rate of mental stress–induced ischemia, mea-
sured with myocardial perfusion imaging, compared with 
age-matched men, a difference that is not observed among 
older patients.418 Mental stress–induced ischemia is associated 
with a 2-fold increased risk of mortality or recurrent events 
in patients with ischemic heart disease.429 Thus, it could be 
an important, albeit unrecognized, prognostic indicator in 
women with MI. Because mental stress ischemia induced in 
the laboratory correlates with ischemia in daily life,430 it could 
also be a more frequent trigger of AMI in young women than 
in other groups. Recent evidence also links depression to men-
tal stress–induced ischemia,431,432 providing a new explanatory 
pathway for the worse prognosis of MI patients with depres-
sion, many of whom are women, compared with those without 
depression.
Future Directions: Closing the 
Gap in Sex Disparities
Despite their substantial burden of CVD, women have been 
underrepresented in clinical trials of CVD, generally mak-
ing up only ≈20% of enrolled patients, even though women 
represent 40% to 50% of participants in longitudinal studies 
and registries. Even when women were included in clinical 
trials, data often were not disaggregated by sex, limiting the 
evidence-based information available to healthcare provid-
ers and patients.433 The first step to personalized medicine is 
attention to sex-specific characteristics, and attention to sex 
disparities likely will improve the awareness, prevention, rec-
ognition, treatment, and outcomes of CHD in women. It is 
recognized that the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular drugs 
and devices may vary by sex. Although the new US Food and 
Drug Administration mandate has a legislative requirement 
for sex-specific data in drug studies, it only recommends, but 
does not mandate, sex-specific data in device studies. Women 
constituted only about one third of participants in the 78 clini-
cal trials of cardiovascular devices from 2002 to 2007, and 
the proportion of women has not increased over time. More 
policy solutions should be developed for an increase in the

percentage of women in all cardiovascular trials, which are 
not sex specific, to improve outcomes.
Closing the research gap requires sex-specific examination 
of coronary pathophysiology; optimal diagnostic strategies; 
effective lifestyle, pharmacological, and invasive interven-
tions; and exploration of subpopulations of women socially 
disadvantaged because of race, ethnicity, income level, or edu-
cational attainment. Table 3 reviews current gaps in knowledge 
concerning AMI in women. Adverse outcomes likely reflect 
both bias and biology, defining the need for sex-specific basic 
and clinical research. Exclusion of elderly patients from clini-
cal trials doubly disadvantages women whose coronary events 
occur predominantly at an older age.
Women’s heart health is not solely a medical issue but also 
involves economic, legal and regulatory, psychosocial, ethi-
cal, faith-based, cultural, environmental, community, health 
systems, and political and public policy issues locally and 
globally.3 Table 4 is a summary of the priorities to improve 
outcomes in women with AMI. Therefore, women’s cardio-
vascular health research should involve not only basic and 
multidisciplinary clinical research scientists but also health-
care providers, women and their families, governmental offi-
cials and agencies, and members of Congress.
Conclusions
CVD is an equal-opportunity killer, and since 1984 the mor-
tality burden has been higher in women than men, but a 
significant decline has occurred since 2000. This dramatic 
decline may be the result of the application of evidence-based 
therapies and education to improve the public and medical 
communities’ awareness of heart disease in women. This 
is encouraging, but there remains an excess in mortality in 
women that is multifactorial. This document reviews the dif-
ferent factors plausibly responsible in the setting of an AMI. 
Sex differences occur in the pathophysiology and clinical pre-
sentation of MI and affect treatment delays. Recommended 
perfusion therapies for AMI in women are similar to those in 
men, yet bleeding risks and other complications remain greater 
in women. Women are undertreated with guideline-based 
recommendations, leading to worse outcomes and increased 
rates of readmission, reinfarction, and deaths in the first year 
after MI. CR is underused and underprescribed for women, 
but novel approaches to increase participation by women are 
promising. To further compound undertreatment, women’s 
adherence to these evidence-based recommendations is sub-
optimal. There is a need for continued public health messages 
and interventions to target racial and ethnic minority women, 
given the burden of risk factors and continued disparity in out-
comes. Multidisciplinary research teams are urged to examine 
innovative secondary prevention models of care that are age 
appropriate, culturally sensitive, and personalized to women’s 
psychosocial and physiological characteristics.
