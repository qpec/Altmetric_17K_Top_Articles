Abstract
Importance—There are long-standing interests in the potential benefits of vitamin D for 
preventing breast cancer recurrence and mortality; yet data from prospective cohort studies are 
limited.
Objective—We investigated a serum biomarker of vitamin D status, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25OHD) measured at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, with prognosis.
Design—The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors established 
in 2006. Enrollment was completed in 2013; follow up is ongoing.
Setting—The cohort was established in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large 
integrated healthcare delivery system in San Francisco Bay Area and central valley, California.
Participants—Women diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer were typically consented 
and enrolled within 2 months of diagnosis. The overall enrollment rate was 46%. Participants are 
followed for health outcomes and comorbidities at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 months after baseline 
interview. A case-cohort design was used for efficiency assay of 25OHD, selecting 1,666 cohort 
members with serum samples and ensuring representation in the sub-cohort of races and clinical 
subtypes.
Main Outcome Measures—Primary outcomes are breast cancer recurrence, second primary 
cancer (SPC), and death.
Results—Serum 25OHD concentrations were lower in women with advanced stage tumors, and 
the lowest in premenopausal women with triple-negative cancer. Levels were also inversely 
associated with hazards of disease progression and death. Compared with the lowest tertile (T1),

 women with the highest (T3) 25OHD levels had superior overall survival (OS). This association 
remained after adjustment for clinical prognostic factors [hazards ratio (HR)=0.72, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.54, 0.98]. Among premenopausal women, the association with OS was 
stronger, and there were also associations with breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and invasive 
disease-free survival (IDFS) (OS: HR=0.45, 95% CI, 0.21–0.96; BCSS: HR=0.37, 95% CI, 0.15–
0.93; IDFS: HR=0.58, 95% CI, 0.34–1.01; all after full adjustment.)
Conclusions and Relevance—Serum 25OHD levels were independently associated with 
breast cancer prognostic characteristics and patient prognosis, most prominently among 
premenopausal women. Our findings from a large, well-characterized prospective cohort provide 
compelling observational evidence on associations of vitamin D with lower risk of breast cancer 
morbidity and mortality.

Introduction
Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in a variety of cancers.1,2 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25OHD), the major circulating metabolite, provides a direct assessment of vitamin D status 
in vivo.3 Many epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have investigated the association 
of blood 25OHD levels with breast cancer risk, reporting mixed results.4–9 This could be 
due, in part, to the etiological heterogeneity of breast cancer. We previously showed that, 
among premenopausal women, low 25OHD concentrations were associated with advanced 
tumor stage and triple-negative (TN) subtype.10
Compared to studies of breast cancer risk, only a few have examined vitamin D with 
prognosis. Goodwin et al showed higher risk of distant recurrence and death among patients 
with vitamin D deficiency than those with sufficient levels.11 Although several later studies 
reported similar findings,12–15 two studies reported null associations.16,17 It is noted that 
previous studies invariably examined all-cause mortality, and only one examined breast 
cancer-specific mortality.14 Because vitamin D may be related to mortality due to all causes 
that are not necessarily specific to cancer,18–20 it is important to consider breast cancer-
specific survival and other outcomes.
In a large prospective cohort of breast cancer survivors, we investigated associations of 
serum 25OHD with breast cancer prognostic characteristics and outcomes, including 
recurrence, second primary cancers, and death.
Study Population and Methods
Study population and biospecimen collection
The analyses were conducted within the Pathways Study, a prospective breast cancer cohort 
of women with breast cancer. Established in January 2006 at Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California (KPNC), Pathways was designed specifically to examine factors associated with 
breast cancer recurrence and survival. As previously described,21 women diagnosed with

 incident invasive breast cancer were identified through rapid case ascertainment, and were 
typically consented in writing and enrolled within 2 months of diagnosis. The enrollment 
rate was 46%, and participants were representative of women diagnosed with breast cancer 
at KPNC during the study period. Baseline interviews were conducted in person and 
included detailed questionnaires and anthropometric measures; bloods were drawn shortly 
thereafter. Regular follow-ups are conducted via mailed or phone questionnaires for lifestyle 
factors at 6, 24, and 72 months, and health outcomes and comorbidities at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 
96 months. Blood samples were collected from 90% of the women at a median time of 69 
days (range 31–455 days) after diagnosis and shipped to Roswell Park Cancer Institute 
(RPCI) Data Bank and Biorepository (DBBR) laboratories for processing. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Boards at KPNC and RPCI.
Clinical and outcome data collection
Diagnostic and treatment data were obtained from the KPNC Cancer Registry and other 
electronic clinical and administrative databases. During follow-up interviews, women 
reported new breast or other cancers and conditions. On a monthly basis, KPNC electronic 
medical records were searched for re-initiation of chemotherapy and/or evidence of a 
potential recurrence using a computerized algorithm of ICD-9/ICD-10 codes, based on 
research in similar integrated health systems.22–25 Potential recurrences identified from both 
self-report and electronic medical records were confirmed by medical record review. Death 
information came from several sources, including family members, medical records, and 
linkage with the KPNC mortality file, which incorporates data from KPNC sources, the 
State of California, and the Social Security Administration. Underlying cause of death was 
determined from the death certificate, hospital discharge summary, autopsy or coroner’s 
report, or physician notes.
Breast cancer clinical subtypes were classified using clinical data from KPNC, ascertained 
using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). For patients with equivocal HER2 
status, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used. Subtypes were defined as: luminal 
A: ER+ or PR+, and HER2−; luminal B: ER+ or PR+, and HER2+; HER2 enriched: ER−, 
PR−, and HER2+; and triple-negative: ER−, PR−, and HER2−.26
Case-cohort design and 25OHD measurement
We used a case-cohort design to select a sub-cohort of patients from the total 3,175 
participants available at the time. All non-White cases and non-luminal A subtypes were 
included, along with a random sample of 400 white women with luminal A tumor. We also 
included women outside the sub-cohort, who had an outcome during this time. In the final 
subcohort of 1,666 women, serum samples were analyzed for 25OHD concentration by an 
immunochemiluminometric assay performed at Heartland Assays (Ames, IA). The assay 
coefficient of variation was 8.8%.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess associations of 25OHD concentrations 
with non-clinical factors that could potentially affect levels, including age at diagnosis,

 menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), self-reported race/ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status (SES), physical activity, smoking, supplementary and dietary vitamin D intake, and 
season of blood collection. As only weak seasonal variations in 25OHD concentrations were 
observed in this population (Supplemental Figure s1), we used measured rather than season-
adjusted concentrations of vitamin D levels, and accounted for residual confounding by 
including season in all models. We chose to divide vitamin D levels by tertiles rather than 
clinical cutpoints (sufficient, insufficient, and deficient), because of controversies over the 
deficiency definitions and the uncertainty of relevance of such definitions to breast cancer. In 
additional analyses of vitamin D levels classified by clinical cutpoints (deficient: <20 ng/ml; 
insufficient: 20–29.9 ng/ml; sufficient: ≥30 ng/ml),27 the results were similar to those with 
tertiles.
Serum 25OHD concentrations were compared by known prognostic characteristics at 
diagnosis, including tumor stage, grade, ER status, and clinical subtype, with adjustment for 
non-clinical covariates including age at diagnosis, BMI, race/ethnicity, and season of blood 
collection. Further adjustment for physical activity, smoking, and SES variables in the 
models did not substantially change the results and were thus omitted. Multinomial logistic 
regression was used to assess odds ratios (ORs) for 25OHD tertiles with clinical subtypes by 
IHC, using the most common luminal A subtype as the referent group.
To account for the subcohort sampling scheme, sampling weights were incorporated in 
ANOVA and multivariable analyses described above, which generated similar estimates.
According to the standardized definitions in the STEEP system,28 survival outcomes 
assessed included the following: recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), breast 
cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). IDFS considers 
recurrence, secondary primary invasive cancers, as well as death due to any causes. We also 
examined second primary cancers (SPC), including both invasive cancers and ductal 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Follow-up began at the time of breast cancer diagnosis until the 
occurrence of a breast cancer event, and a patient with no event of interest during the follow 
up was censored at the time of last outcome ascertainment (November 2014). The median 
follow-up time was 7.0 years (range: 3.7–8.9 years), with 9% loss to active follow up by 
phone interview (passive follow up by medical records continues).
The associations of serum 25OHD levels with time to each endpoint were examined using 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, modified for the case-cohort design by the 
method of Langholz and Jiao.29 Minimally-adjusted models included only significant non-
clinical covariates (age at diagnosis, BMI, race/ethnicity, and season of blood draw), 
followed by full adjustment for clinical prognostic factors. Time-covariate interactions were 
assessed, and no appreciable non-proportionality was found. Interactions were assessed 
using the Wald test. Non-linearity was tested by including a squared term of ordered vitamin 
D levels in the models, which was not significant. Only a few covariates were missing with a 
small proportion and observations with missing data were excluded from the multivariable 
models by default. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

 Results
Serum 25OHD concentrations by selected non-clinical factors are summarized in 
Supplemental Table s1. As expected, concentrations were associated inversely with BMI and 
positively with physical activity, vitamin D supplement use, and dietary vitamin D intake; 
African Americans and Hispanics had lower 25OHD concentrations than Whites; and 
current smokers had lower concentrations than never and former smokers. Older women 
tended to have higher 25OHD concentrations than younger women. SES variables, including 
education, household income, and marital status, were also associated. There were 
statistically significant yet small seasonal variations in 25OHD concentrations. At baseline, 
almost half (48%) of the patient population were vitamin D deficient, and another 35% 
insufficient.
As shown in Table 1, there were inverse associations of 25OHD concentrations with tumor 
stage and tumor grade. The results remained statistically significant for stage after 
adjustment for covariates, and did not vary by menopausal status (data not shown). No 
significant differences were found by ER or IHC subtype. Among premenopausal women, 
however, 25OHD concentrations were the lowest in TN cases (mean: 20.0, 19.8, 19.3, and 
18.7 ng/ml for luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and TN, respectively). Using the 
luminal A subtype as the referent group, premenopausal women with 25OHD levels in the 
higher two thirds of the distribution had reduced odds of TN subtype than those in the lowest 
third (T2 vs. T1: adjusted OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.83; T3 vs. T1: OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.27, 
1.04; p for trend=0.03).
Kaplan-Meir survival curves by tertile of serum 25OHD are shown in Figure 1. In 
multivariable analyses of survival outcomes with adjustment for non-clinical factors, higher 
25OHD levels were associated with superior OS (HR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.72, p for 
trend<0.0001), BCSS (HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.90, p for trend=0.01), and IDFS 
(HR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.85, p for trend=0.004), but not with RFS or SPC (model 1 in 
Table 2). The associations with BCSS and IDFS were attenuated and became non-significant 
after further adjustment for clinical factors including tumor stage, grade and IHC subtype; 
while the association with OS remained significant (T3 vs. T1: HR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54, 
0.98, p for trend=0.03; Model 2 in Table 2).
When stratified by menopausal status, higher 25OHD levels were associated with superior 
RFS, OS, BCSS and IDFS among premenopausal women (survival curves in Supplemental 
Figure s2; and adjusted HRs in Supplemental Table s2). These associations remained 
significant after adjustment for non-clinical factors (HR1) and further for clinical factors 
(HR2). Among postmenopausal women, there were significant associations of 25OHD 
levels with OS and suggestive associations with IDFS when adjusted for non-clinical factor; 
both of which, however, became non-significant after further adjustment for clinical factors. 
Serum 25OHD was not associated with SPC in either pre- or post-menopausal women. 
Interactions of 25OHD levels with menopausal status on associations with outcomes were 
non-significant (p for interaction >0.05).

 Additional adjustment for treatment regimens (surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy and hormonal therapy) in the multivariable models already containing clinical 
prognostic factors did not changed the above results.
Discussion
In this case-cohort analysis of serum 25OHD levels with outcomes in a prospective study of 
women with breast cancer, we found that higher levels of 25OHD were associated with 
superior prognosis. Women with higher levels of 25OHD had better overall survival, and in 
premenopausal women, also better breast-cancer-specific survival, recurrence-free survival, 
and invasive-disease-free survival. No impact of 25OHD levels was observed for risk of 
second primary cancers.
Several previous studies examined blood 25OHD levels with breast cancer survival 
outcomes: five reporting superior OS in patients with high 25OHD levels;11–15 four 
remained significant and one became non-significant after adjustment.14 Our findings are 
thus consistent with the majority of the literature demonstrating better OS among patients 
with higher 25OHD levels, following a dose-response pattern. This largely consistent trend 
was confirmed in two recent meta-analyses.4,30 A systematic Cochrane review 
commissioned by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) also concluded that mortality is probably 
inversely related to blood 25OHD concentrations among cancer patients.31
In addition to OS, recurrence has also been studied with blood 25OHD in the literature, yet 
the results have been mixed. Three studies reported an inverse association11,12,15 and 
another two16,17 reported null associations. In our study, 25OHD levels were not related to 
RFS in the overall patient population or among postmenopausal women, but an inverse 
association was found among premenopausal women. Other survival outcomes were only 
occasionally evaluated in previous studies: BCSS was reported in one study with no 
association,14 and SPC was reported in the MA14 trial with no association.16 While our 
results of SPC were similar to the MA14 trial, we did observe a significant association of 
serum 25OHD levels with BCSS in premenopausal women.
The lack of consistency in results of outcomes other than OS may be, in part, due to 
differences across studies in validity and completeness of data on recurrence, second 
primary cancers or cause of death. Compared with all-cause mortality, these outcomes might 
be challenging to track, collect and ascertain, especially when the data are scattered across 
different providers in the healthcare system. Our study minimizes this limitation by being 
conducted within a single large integrated healthcare delivery system. There is also a 
possibility that the consistently observed associations of high blood 25OHD concentrations 
with lower risk of all-cause mortality reflect more of a general relationship that is not 
specific to breast cancer patients.18–20 We cannot completely refute this possibility, yet the 
significant associations with RFS and BCSS in our study suggest otherwise.
We advise caution when interpreting our findings of vitamin D with outcomes due to 
potential residual confounding, given that blood 25OHD concentrations are subject to many 
environmental and physiological changes. To assess causality and place our findings in the

 context of the literature, we adapted the Bradford-Hill criteria as recently discussed by 
Robsahm et al,32,33 regarding the association of vitamin D and cancer. These criteria include 
temporality, strength, exposure-response, biological plausibility, and consistency. As there is 
strong biological plausibility of vitamin D’s anticancer properties from experimental 
studies,1,2 good consistency across studies of overall survival, and a clear dose-response 
relationship, we focused our discussion on temporality and confounding effects.
In our study, blood samples were collected typically within 2 months post-diagnosis, a 
timing likely prior to the development of symptomatic disease progression events. Given that 
treatment may affect 25OHD levels34–37, we assessed the impact of blood collection time 
relative to cancer diagnosis and treatment (surgery and initiation of radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy). Only the time intervals from diagnosis to 
chemotherapy or endocrine therapy had a moderate influence on measured 25OHD levels. 
Even so, consideration of timing of blood draw relative to these clinical events did not 
change associations of 25OHD with outcomes, when the other covariates were already in the 
models (data not shown). It is also possible that disease severity might adversely impact 
25OHD concentrations. Thus, in addition to obesity and other non-clinical factors affecting 
25OHD levels, we also adjusted for tumor stage, grade and clinical subtype. Some of the 
associations were attenuated; yet the associations of 25OHD with OS and among 
premenopausal women remained. There is also a concern of confounding by the systemic 
inflammatory response.38 However, the relationship between inflammation and blood 
25OHD concentrations is complex and also subject to reverse causation. In fact, vitamin D is 
known to be anti-inflammatory,39,40 and suppression of tumor-caused inflammation may not 
be confounding, but along the causal pathway of vitamin D’s association with breast cancer 
prognosis.
Based on the above assessment, we tend to agree with the conclusion drawn by Robsahm et 
al. that the relationship between blood 25OHD and cancer survival may be causal.33 To 
definitively prove this, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation vs. 
placebo would be necessary. However, in a feasibility study, 84.4% of newly-diagnosed 
breast cancer patients reported use of vitamin D-containing supplements, and only 12.7% 
patients met the eligibility criteria,41 possibly due to increasing public and medical 
recognition of the issue of vitamin D deficiency. The low levels of deficiency/insufficiency 
among those cancer patients led the authors to conclude that such an RCT would have 
limited feasibility. This issue may be further complicated by individuals’ changing behaviors 
of sun exposure and dietary pattern, which may also “contaminate” an RCT schema. Indeed, 
except for an RCT in UK to test the feasibility of a trial on Vitamin D and Longevity 
(VIDAL) (http://vidal.lshtm.ac.uk/), we are unaware of any other RCTs on vitamin D and 
cancer survival as the primary endpoint. The ongoing Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial 
(VITAL) may eventually provide some data on cancer survival outcomes with continued 
follow-up;42 however, it may take many years to accumulate enough events. In this regard, 
observational studies like ours from large prospective breast cancer cohorts are valuable to 
advance our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer survival. 
In particular, studies of blood levels of vitamin D per se – as contrasted with studies of 
vitamin D supplementation – are not amenable to primary investigation through RCT study 
designs.

 Some limitations of our study should be noted. Although we show stronger associations of 
25OHD levels with survival in premenopausal women, interaction testing with menopausal 
status was not significant. Based on ad hoc power calculation, this is likely due to inadequate 
sample size, especially when the interaction is quantitative, i.e., in the same direction but 
with different magnitudes of the associations. We did not explicitly control for multiple 
comparison testing considering the five survival endpoints examined, as our analyses were 
conducted with a priori hypothesis based on the literature and our previous study. Lastly, our 
classification of IHC subtypes was based on three markers available from the clinical record, 
ER, PR and HER2. The lack of Ki-67 data may have misclassified some luminal B cases 
featuring ER/PR-positivity and high Ki-67 as luminal A. However, the proportion of these 
cases is expected to be small and our main findings are not focused on luminal tumors.
Conclusions
We found that low serum 25OHD levels were associated with poorer survival in this 
prospective cohort study of women with breast cancer. Furthermore, low serum 25OHD 
levels were also associated with prognostic characteristics, including TN subtype. The 
associations with prognostic characteristics and outcomes were independent of each other 
and were most prominent among premenopausal women. Our findings provide compelling 
observational evidence for inverse associations between vitamin D levels and risk of breast 
cancer progression and death.

HR1: adjusted for age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and season of blood collection. HR2: adjusted additionally for tumor stage, 
grade and IHC subtype. Cutoff points for serum 25OHD levels: T1: <16.75 ng/ml; T2: 16.75–25.09 ng/ml; T3: ≥25.10 ng/ml. Further adjustment 
for cancer treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) on the basis of HR2 models did not substantially changed the 
results. The P for trend test was done by treating the tertiles as an ordered value in the models.
