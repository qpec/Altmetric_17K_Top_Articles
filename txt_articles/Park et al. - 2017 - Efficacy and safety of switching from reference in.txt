ABSTRACT
Objectives To investigate the efficacy and safety of
switching from infliximab reference product (RP) to its
biosimilar or maintaining biosimilar treatment in patients
with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
Methods This open-label extension study recruited
patients with AS who completed a 54-week, randomised
controlled study comparing CT-P13 with RP (PLANETAS).
CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every
8 weeks from week 62 to week 102. Efficacy end points
included the proportion of patients achieving Assessment
of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20.
Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were measured using an
electrochemiluminescent method. Data were analysed for
patients treated with CT-P13 in the main PLANETAS
study and the extension (maintenance group) and those
who were switched to CT-P13 during the extension
study (switch group).
Results Overall, 174 (82.9%) of 210 patients who
completed the first 54 weeks of PLANETAS and agreed
to participate in the extension were enrolled. Among
these, 88 were maintained on CT-P13 and 86 were
switched to CT-P13 from RP. In these maintenance and
switch groups, respectively, ASAS20 response rates at
week 102 were 80.7% and 76.9%. ASAS40 and ASAS
partial remission were also similar between groups. ADA
positivity rates were comparable (week 102: 23.3% vs
27.4%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation
during the extension study in 3 (3.3%) and 4 (4.8%)
patients, respectively.
Conclusions This is the first study to show that
switching from RP to its biosimilar CT-P13 is possible
without negative effects on safety or efficacy in patients
with AS. In the maintenance group, CT-P13 was
effective and well tolerated over 2 years of treatment.
Trial registration number NCT01571206; Results.
INTRODUCTION
CT-P13 is a biosimilar of infliximab, a chimerical
human-murine
monoclonal
antibody
against
tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Biosimilar drugs
such as CT-P13 are generic versions of innovator
biologics,
or
‘reference
products’
(RPs).1
Regulatory authorities in Europe, the USA and else-
where have defined strict criteria for biosimilar
approval. Although exact criteria vary in different
countries or regions, it is usually necessary to show
that a biosimilar is highly similar to its RP in
physicochemical and biological terms. In addition,
clinical studies must establish statistical equivalence
in pharmacokinetics and efficacy, and comparability
of safety.2–4
CT-P13 has been approved by the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) for all indications held by
the infliximab RP
. Extensive testing has shown that
all major physicochemical characteristics and in vitro
biological activities of CT-P13 and RP
, including
affinity for soluble and transmembrane TNF, are
highly comparable.5 6 CT-P13 and RP were also
compared in two 54-week, multinational, rando-
mised,
double-blind,
parallel-group
studies
in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or rheumatoid arth-
ritis
(RA),
namely
Programme
evaLuating
the
Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in
AS
patients
(PLANETAS)
and
Programme
evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational
drug
cT-p13
in
RA
patients
(PLANETRA).
Analyses of these randomised studies established
the pharmacokinetic and efficacy equivalence of
CT-P13 and infliximab RP
. Immunogenicity and
safety
findings
for
the
two
drugs
were
also
similar.6–9
Due to the lower cost of biosimilars versus RPs,
there is considerable interest in determining if newly
diagnosed patients can be effectively and safely
treated with a particular biosimilar, and whether
those already on RP treatment can be switched to its
biosimilar without adverse consequences on efficacy
or safety.10 11 Collection of clinical data on this
topic of ‘switchability’ is necessary. Here, we report
the results of an open-label extension study that
recruited patients with AS who had completed
54 weeks of the main PLANETAS study. This was a
single-arm extension study in which all patients
were pooled to be treated with CT-P13. The aims of
the extension were twofold: (1) to investigate effi-
cacy and safety during switched therapy to CT-P13
in patients previously treated with RP for 54 weeks
in the main study (hereafter named the ‘switch
group’); and (2) to investigate the efficacy and safety
of CT-P13 treatment over 2 years in those patients

 treated with CT-P13 in the main study (the ‘maintenance
group’). To aid interpretation, we describe the data for the main-
tenance and switch groups over two periods: the main study
(week 0–54) and the extension study (week 54–102). A similar
extension study that has recently been completed in patients with
RA (PLANETRA) is also reported in this issue.12
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Methods of the main 54-week, randomised, double-blind,
parallel-group PLANETAS study have been reported previously.6 7
Briefly, the main study recruited patients aged 18–75 years with
active AS for ≥3 months according to the 1984 modified
New York classification criteria. This Phase 1 PLANETAS exten-
sion study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01571206) was an
open-label, single-arm extension study conducted in 40 centres
in 8 countries. Patients who had completed 54 weeks of the main
PLANETAS study were offered the opportunity of entering the
extension study for another 1 year. Those who did not sign a
new informed consent form for the extension were excluded.
Additional eligibility criteria applied for the extension study were
no major protocol violation in the main study and no new
therapy for AS in the extension. Details of patient flow through
the main and extension studies are shown in figure 1.
In the main PLANETAS study, patients received nine infusions
of CT-P13 (CELLTRION, Incheon, Republic of Korea) or the
infliximab RP ( Janssen Biotech, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA).
After the ninth infusion of PLANETAS study treatment (given
at week 54), eligible patients could choose to continue into the
extension study during which patients and physicians were
blinded to the treatment received in the main study. Patients in
the extension study received an additional six infusions of
CT-P13 given every 8 weeks from week 62 to week 102.
CT-P13 was administered via 2 h intravenous infusion at a dose
of 5 mg/kg. At the discretion of the investigator, antihistamines
could be provided 30–60 min before CT-P13 infusion. The
extension study was performed according to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on
Harmonisation good clinical practice guidelines. The relevant
independent ethics committees approved the study protocol,
consent forms and other written information for the extension
study.
Study end points
Efficacy assessments were made at baseline and weeks 14, 30,
54, 78 and 102. Efficacy end points included the proportion of
patients achieving clinical response according to Assessment of
SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20 and ASAS40
criteria; the proportion of patients with ASAS partial remission
(PR); the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index
(BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index,
the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, and the

ive protein (CRP).
For assessment of immunogenicity, the proportion of patients
with antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was assessed at baseline and
weeks 14, 30, 54, 78 and 102 using an electrochemiluminescent
immunoassay method, as previously reported.6 7 The neutralis-
ing activity of ADAs was also assessed by a flow-through
immunoassay method using the Gyros Immunoassay platform
(Gyros AB, Sweden). For safety, treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) were assessed throughout the main and exten-
sion studies. The following TEAEs of special interest were also
monitored: infusion-related reactions (including hypersensitivity
and anaphylactic reaction), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB (defined
as a positive conversion on an interferon-γ release assay—which
was negative at baseline—together with a negative result on
chest
X-ray
examination),
serious
infection,
pneumonia,
drug-induced liver injury, vascular disorders and malignancies.
Other safety assessments included monitoring of vital signs,
physical examination findings and clinical laboratory analyses.
Details of exploratory and post hoc end points are included in
online supplementary appendix A.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software V
.9.1.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Continuous data
were summarised using descriptive statistics. Categorical data
were summarised using counts and percentages. The populations
were predefined in the study protocol and statistical analysis
plan for participants in the extension study. The intent-to-treat
(ITT) population consisted of all enrolled patients. The efficacy
population consisted of all patients who received at least one
full dose of study treatment and had data for at least one efficacy
assessment in the extension study. All efficacy analyses were per-
formed using a ‘missing equals excluded’ (MEX) approach.
A logistic regression model was used to analyse the proportion
of patients achieving clinical response (ASAS20/ASAS40/ASAS
PR), with treatment group as a fixed effect and the stratification
factors (baseline BASDAI score and region) as covariates.
Treatment effect differences between maintenance and switch
groups were estimated by calculating ORs and their 95% CI.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyse other efficacy end
points. The safety population (used to analyse all safety and
immunogenicity events) consisted of all patients who received at
least one dose of study treatment in the extension study. Data
from the main study period were analysed in participants of the
extension study only, and not in all patients from the main
study. Methods for sensitivity analyses of ASAS responses are
included in online supplementary appendix A.
RESULTS
Patients
The first patient visit in the main PLANETAS study was held in
November 2010; the last patient visit in the extension study took
place in June 2013. A total of 174 of 210 patients from the main
study who consented to participate in the extension study were
screened under the approval of the appropriate ethics committee
(figure 1). All 174 screened patients were enrolled and were
included in the ITT
, efficacy and safety populations of the exten-
sion study. Of these, 88 had been randomised to CT-P13 in the
main study and 86 to RP
. Thus, the ITT population for the exten-
sion study included 88 and 86 patients in the maintenance and
switch groups, respectively. Patient demographics and baseline
characteristics were broadly comparable between these two
groups (table 1). In the ITT population, 81 (92.0%) and 77
(89.5%) patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respect-
ively, completed all 48 weeks of the extension study; 7 (8.0%)
and
9 (10.5%) patients discontinued the extension study.
Reasons for discontinuation are detailed in figure 1. T
wo patients
randomised to RP in the main study were incorrectly treated with
CT-P13 during that study. Applying a conservative approach,
those two patients were classified as being in the CT-P13 group
for safety analyses in the main study. Therefore, 90 and 84
patients were included in the maintenance and switch groups,
respectively, in the safety population of the extension study.
Efficacy
During the extension study (ie, week 54–102), the proportion of
patients achieving a clinical response according to ASAS20 and
ASAS40 criteria, and ASAS PR rates, were maintained at similar
levels to those in the main study in both the maintenance and
switch groups, and were comparable between groups (table 2).
In the switch group, response rates at week 102 (ie, 48 weeks
after the last infusion of RP at week 54) were similar to those
observed before switching (ie, at week 54; ASAS20: 76.9% at
week 102 vs 75.6% at week 54; ASAS40: 61.5% vs 53.5%;
ASAS PR: 23.1% vs 17.4%). Response rates at week 102 were
also similar to those observed at week 54 in the maintenance
group (ASAS20: 80.7% at week 102 vs 70.5% at week 54,
respectively; ASAS40: 63.9% vs 58.0%; ASAS PR: 19.3% vs
17.0%). Among patients who participated in the extension study,
clinical response rates were also similar between groups through-
out the main study (week 0–54) (table 2). In a subgroup analysis
performed
according
to
ADA
status,
the
proportion
of
ADA-negative patients achieving ASAS20 was 75.7% at week 54
and 83.9% at week 102 in the maintenance group, and 79.0% at
week 54 and 84.6% at week 102 in the switch group. In com-
parison,

 (week 54) and 62.5% (week 102) in the switch group achieved
ASAS20 (online supplementary appendix B, figure B-1). As sum-
marised in figure 2, there were no noticeable changes in other
efficacy end points during the PLANETAS extension, either
between or within groups.
Sensitivity analyses to compare populations and statistical
approaches appeared to support sustained efficacy and compar-
ability between the two groups. Analyses using the last observa-
tion carried forward (LOCF) approach showed highly similar
results to those using the MEX approach, both in the mainten-
ance group (ASAS20: 80.7% at week 102 with both LOCF and
MEX approaches) and the switch group (ASAS20: 74.4% at
week 102 using LOCF vs 76.9% using MEX). Analyses of the
main study ITT population using the LOCF and non-responder
imputation (NRI) approaches showed relatively low response
rates compared with the extension study ITT population.
However, when analysed using the LOCF approach, response
rates were comparable between the two groups and were sus-
tained
throughout
the
2-year
study
period,
both
in
the
extension study ITT population (ASAS20: 80.7% at week 102
vs 70.5% at week 54 in the maintenance group, 74.4% vs
75.6% in the switch group) and the main study ITT population
(ASAS20: 65.6% at week 102 vs 58.4% at week 54 in the
CT-P13 group, 64.8% vs 65.6% in the RP group) (online
supplementary appendix C, tables C-1 and C-2). When analysed
using the NRI approach, lower response rates were seen at week
102 than week 54 but rates were still comparable between the
groups (ASAS20: 53.6% at week 102 vs 56.8% at week 54 in
the maintenance group; 48.0% vs 60.0% in the switch group)
(online supplementary appendix C, table C-3).
Immunogenicity
During the main and extension studies, the proportion of
patients with ADAs was similar in the maintenance and switch
groups at each time point (table 3). At week 54, the proportions
of patients with ADAs in the maintenance and switch groups
were 22.2% and 26.2%, respectively. In the extension study,
these figures were 23.3% and 29.8% at week 78 and 23.3% and

 27.4% at week 102. Between-group differences did not reach
statistical significance at any time point. In the switch group,
ADA incidence did not increase from week 54 to 102 (26.2% vs
27.4%). In general, most of the patients with a positive ADA
result were also positive for neutralising antibodies. The propor-
tion of ADA-positive patients with sustained ADAs was similar
in the two groups (85.7% and 88.9% in the maintenance and
switch groups, respectively). There was no analysis for IgG4.
Pharmacodynamics
In a subgroup analysis by ADA status, mean change from base-
line in CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was com-
parable in the maintenance and switch groups at week 54 and
week 102 in both ADA-negative and ADA-positive patients (see
online supplementary appendix B, table B-1).
Safety
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one TEAE
was 48.9% (n=44 of 90) in the maintenance group and 71.4%
(n=60 of 84) in the switch group during the extension study,
and 70.0% (n=63) and 61.9% (n=52) during the main study.
Online supplementary appendix D lists all TEAEs reported
during the extension study (see online supplementary table
D-1). Rates of TEAEs in both groups during the main and
extension studies were within the range reported in historical
studies with infliximab RP (online supplementary appendix E).
TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study
treatment were reported in 20 (22.2%) and 33 (39.3%) patients
in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, during the
extension study, and in 40 (44.4%) and 35 (41.7%) patients
during the main study. During the extension phase, reported
treatment-related
TEAEs
included
infusion-related
reactions
(7.8% and 7.1% in the maintenance and switch groups, respect-
ively), abnormal liver function tests (4.4% and 4.8%), latent TB
(2.2% and 4.8%) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.3%
and 2.4%) (table 4). Most treatment-related TEAEs were mild
to moderate in severity (45.6% (41 of 90) and 65.5% (55 of
84) in maintenance and switch groups, respectively).

 TEAEs led to discontinuation of treatment during the exten-
sion study in 3 (3.3%) and 4 (4.8%) patients in the maintenance
and switch groups, respectively. In both groups, four patients
experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs)
during the extension study. T
wo of these SAEs were considered
related to treatment (TB, one in each group). During the main
study, four (4.4%) and two (2.4%) patients in the maintenance
and switch groups, respectively, experienced treatment-emergent
SAEs. One of these events, which occurred in a patient in the
switch group, was considered to be related to treatment (cellu-
litis). All these SAEs were resolved except one SAE (prostate
cancer) which was reported in the maintenance group during
the extension study and which was considered to be unrelated
to the study drug by the investigator.
Data on TEAEs of special interest are shown in table 5.
Infusion-related
reactions
were
reported
in
seven
(7.8%)
patients in the maintenance group and six (7.1%) in the
switch group during the extension study. Of these, four
patients
in
each
group
were
ADA-positive
(see
online
supplementary appendix B, table B-2). Among patients with
infusion-related
reactions,
none
experienced
anaphylaxis.
During the main study period, infusion-related reactions were
reported in four (4.4%) and seven (8.3%) patients in the
maintenance and switch groups, respectively. Of these, one
and four patients, respectively, were ADA-positive. Latent TB
occurred in five (5.6%) and seven (8.3%) patients in the
maintenance and switch groups, respectively, during the exten-
sion study, and in six (6.7%) and three (3.6%) patients in the
main study. Patients reporting latent TB received TB prophy-
laxis according to local guidelines. Among such patients, two
reported active TB SAEs during the extension study (one in
each group), as reported above. One malignancy was observed
during
the
extension
study
(the

 DISCUSSION
The open-label extension study reported here evaluated the effi-
cacy and safety of treatment with a maximum of six infusions of
CT-P13 in patients with AS who had previously been treated
with either CT-P13 (maintenance group) or RP (switch group)
for 54 weeks. In the switch group, ASAS response rates were
maintained from week 54 (ie, the time of the last RP infusion)
to week 102 (ie, 48 weeks after the last RP infusion). In the
maintenance arm, responses to CT-P13 observed in the preced-
ing 54-week study were maintained throughout the open-label
extension study. As previously reported,6 7 efficacy findings at
weeks 30 and 54 of PLANETAS were comparable to 24-week
and
54-week
data
from
the
infliximab
arm
of
ASSERT
(Ankylosing
Spondylitis
Study
for
the
Evaluation
of
Recombinant infliximab Therapy) and another pivotal placebo-
controlled study of RP in AS.13–15 Similarly, ASAS response
rates in the maintenance group at the end of the PLANETAS
extension (ie, week 102) were comparable to those observed at
week 102 of ASSERT (ASAS20: 80.7% vs 73.9%, respectively;
ASAS40: 63.9% vs 59.4%).16 Data for all other efficacy end
points were also similar between the maintenance and switch
groups throughout the main and extension study periods, as
well as within each group over both study periods. Sensitivity
analyses supported the findings of sustained efficacy and com-
parability
between
groups.
LOCF
and
MEX
approaches
reported highly similar results, both in the maintenance and
switch groups. Analyses of the main study ITT and extension
study
ITT
populations
showed
comparable
and
sustained
outcomes throughout the 2-year study. Although analysis of the
main study ITT population using the NRI approach showed
lower response rates at week 78 and week 102 than when the
LOCF approach was used, response rates were still comparable
between groups. Differences in response rates by analysis
method were likely due to the fact that some patients who
responded during the main study were not included in the
extension (figure 1); therefore, the LOCF approach can be con-
sidered the most appropriate method.
In this extension study, CT-P13 was well tolerated, displaying
a safety profile over the long term that was consistent with the
profile of infliximab RP
.16
17 No notable differences were
observed between the maintenance and switch groups in the
incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study
(3/90 and 4/84, respectively), SAEs (4 patients in either group),
serious infections including active TB, ADAs or infusion reac-
tions (tables 3 and 5). A lower proportion of patients in the
maintenance group than the switch group experienced one or
more TEAE during the extension. To further evaluate the
numerical imbalance in the proportions of patients reporting
TEAEs during the extension study, a safety meta-analysis using
data from historical studies conducted with infliximab RP was

 performed. For this purpose, a literature search was conducted
to identify studies in patients with AS focusing on randomised
studies or those with an observational design, with a duration of
at least 54 weeks and long-term cohorts, and observational
studies capturing safety reporting up to 2 years. Only studies
which reported the methodology of collecting safety data and
incidence of adverse events using reliable denominators were
included in the meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis is
presented in online supplementary figure E-1. The proportion
of patients reporting TEAEs in both the maintenance and
switch groups was within the range reported in historical studies
with infliximab RP
.6 16 18–22 Of note, the majority of TEAEs in
the switch group were generally mild to moderate in severity. In
addition, the incidence of infusion-related reactions did not
increase in patients who switched from RP to CT-P13, while the
proportion of patients with sustained or transient ADAs was
comparable between groups throughout the study, although
only qualitative analyses of these data were performed. In a
similarly designed extension study of PLANETRA—a Phase III
study which compared CT-P13 and RP in patients with RA —
the incidence of TEAEs in the maintenance and switch groups
was similar (see online supplementary appendix F).12 In this
regard, there was no indication of a change in the safety profile
when patients transitioned from infliximab RP to CT-P13.
It is well known that development of ADAs against infliximab
is associated with a decreased clinical response and is also linked
to adverse effects such as infusion-related reactions.23 24 W
e
observed lower ASAS20 response rates, higher levels of CRP
and ESR, and a higher incidence of infusion-related reactions in
ADA-positive compared with ADA-negative patients. These
effects were comparable in both groups, suggesting that switch-
ing from RP to CT-P13 did not have a negative impact, regard-
less of ADA status.
The current data suggest that switching to CT-P13 in patients
previously treated with the infliximab RP shows similar efficacy
and safety profiles, compared with maintaining CT-P13. A
number of randomised and non-randomised studies have investi-
gated the issue of switchability for other biosimilar drugs,
including those such as the epoetins, granulocyte-colony stimu-
lating factors and human growth hormone that have been
approved in Europe for several years.25–31 In general, these
studies suggest there are unlikely to be adverse consequences of
switching between innovator biologics and those biosimilars that
have undergone the rigorous level of scrutiny necessary for
approval by the EMA. The similarly designed extension of the
PLANETRA study in patients with RA also showed no adverse
effects of switching to CT-P13 from RP
.12
It is important to note that this single-arm, open-label exten-
sion study was neither designed nor powered to formally evalu-
ate the non-inferiority or equivalence of switching from RP to
CT-P13 vs continued treatment with CT-P13. In this regard, a
randomised, double-blind, Phase IV study has been initiated in
Norway
(‘NOR-SWITCH’;
ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier:
NCT02148640). NOR-SWITCH is comparing the safety and
efficacy of switching from the infliximab RP to CT-P13 vs con-
tinued treatment with RP in adults with RA, spondyloarthritis,
chronic psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s
disease. In addition, a pharmacovigilance programme has been
initiated by the manufacturers of CT-P13. This programme will
monitor the safety of CT-P13 in patients with various inflam-
matory diseases, including AS, who have switched from RP
, and
who are receiving infliximab treatment for the first time.
CONCLUSIONS
CT-P13 was well tolerated with comparable efficacy and safety
as the historical infliximab RP treatment in patients with AS
over 102 weeks. Furthermore, switching from the infliximab RP
to CT-P13 after 1 year of infliximab RP treatment showed con-
tinued comparable efficacy, immunogenicity and safety, to main-
tenance of CT-P13 treatment during the 2nd year of the
treatment.
