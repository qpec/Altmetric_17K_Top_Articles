AbsTrACT 
Lateral ankle sprain injury is the most common 
musculoskeletal injury incurred by individuals who 
participate in sports and recreational physical activities. 
Following initial injury, a high proportion of individuals 
develop long-term injury-associated symptoms and 
chronic ankle instability. The development of chronic 
ankle instability is consequent on the interaction of 
mechanical and sensorimotor insufficiencies/impairments 
that manifest following acute lateral ankle sprain 
injury. To reduce the propensity for developing chronic 
ankle instability, clinical assessments should evaluate 
whether patients in the acute phase following lateral 
ankle sprain injury exhibit any mechanical and/or 
sensorimotor impairments. This modified Delphi study 
was undertaken under the auspices of the executive 
committee of the International Ankle Consortium. The 
primary aim was to develop recommendations, based 
on expert (n=14) consensus, for structured clinical 
assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. After 
two modified Delphi rounds, consensus was achieved 
on the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain 
injuries. Consensus was reached on a minimum standard 
clinical diagnostic assessment. Key components of this 
clinical diagnostic assessment include: establishing 
the mechanism of injury, as well as the assessment of 
ankle joint bones and ligaments. Through consensus, 
the expert panel also developed the International 
Ankle Consortium Rehabilitation-Oriented ASsessmenT 
(ROAST). The International Ankle Consortium ROAST will 
help clinicians identify mechanical and/or sensorimotor 
impairments that are associated with chronic ankle 
instability. This consensus statement from the 
International Ankle Consortium aims to be a key resource 
for clinicians who regularly assess individuals with acute 
lateral ankle sprain injuries.
InTroduCTIon
Lateral ankle sprains are the most common lower 
limb musculoskeletal injury incurred by individuals 
who participate in sports and recreational physical 
activities.1 2 The prevalence of lateral ankle sprains 
among the general population is also substantial, as 
demonstrated by hospital emergency department 
data.3–6 Up to 70% of the general population 
report having incurred an ankle injury during their 
lifetime.7 
Lateral ankle sprain injuries associate with high 
societal economic costs, related to injury diagnosis, 
initial management, rehabilitation and reduced 
work productivity. In the UK, Cooke et al6 reported 
an average of 6.9 days of paid work lost due to 
lateral ankle sprain injuries, adding at least an 
additional £805 in lost productivity costs for each 
injury to the overall costs, compared with £135 of 
direct healthcare costs. The combination of high 
incidence and both direct and indirect costs makes 
the economic burden of lateral ankle sprain injuries 
indisputable.
Lateral ankle sprain injuries have the highest 
reinjury rate of all lower limb musculoskeletal inju-
ries.8 Individuals who incur an acute lateral ankle 
sprain injury have a twofold increased risk of rein-
jury in the year following their initial injury.9 Rein-
jury coincides with the progression of a number of 
chronic injury-associated sequelae including: pain, 
persistent swelling, feelings of ankle joint insta-
bility, ankle joint ‘giving-way’, recurrent injury and 
reduced functional capacity as illustrated by reduced 
scores on patient-reported outcome measures ques-
tionnaires.1 2 10–12 These injury-associated sequelae 
constitute the characteristic features of chronic 
ankle instability.10–13 High reinjury rates might be 
due to inadequate rehabilitation,1 2 and/or prema-
ture return to sport.14 Hence, reducing the risk of 
reinjury and the propensity for the development of 
chronic ankle instability is a key priority after acute 
lateral ankle sprain injury occurrence.15
The interaction of mechanical and sensorimotor 
impairments that manifest following acute lateral 
ankle sprain injury contribute to the development 
of chronic ankle instability.16 Therefore, clinical 
assessments should evaluate whether a patient 
in the acute phase following lateral ankle sprain 
injury exhibits any mechanical and/or sensorimotor 
impairments. However, previous research has docu-
mented that clinicians may have a limited under-
standing of the full spectrum of mechanical and 
sensorimotor impairments that manifest following 
an acute lateral ankle sprain injury.17 Hence, the

Consensus statement
treatment being administered following acute lateral ankle sprain 
injury is unlikely to be based on objectively identified mechan-
ical and sensorimotor impairments. As such, it is necessary to 
develop recommendations for structured clinical assessment 
following acute lateral ankle sprain injury, which addresses both 
mechanical and sensorimotor impairments. Considering this, the 
aim of this project was to develop, based on expert consensus, 
recommendations for structured clinical assessment of acute 
lateral ankle sprain injuries. These recommendations should 
have a particular emphasis on impairments that are known to 
associate with chronic ankle instability.
MATerIAls And MeThods
study design
This modified (consisting of two rounds) Delphi study was 
undertaken under the auspices of the executive committee of 
the International Ankle Consortium. The International Ankle 
Consortium, which was inaugurated in 2004, is an interna-
tional community of researchers and clinicians whose primary 
academic purpose is to promote scholarship and dissemination 
of research-informed knowledge related to ankle sprain injury 
and chronic ankle instability. A previous consensus statement of 
the International Ankle Consortium2 and its supporting evidence 
document1 were used as the starting point for this modified 
Delphi study. The protocol for the present modified Delphi study, 
which details the study methodology, has been published.18 In 
summary, our modified Delphi process started with an anony-
mous online questionnaire (round 1) specifically related to the 
clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. The 
online questionnaire consisted of a number of distinct sections 
including: (1) participant demographics; (2) subjective assess-
ment and patient-reported outcome measures; (3) diagnostic 
imaging; (4) objective assessment (including asssessment of bony 
integrity, ligamentous integrity, range of motion, arthrokine-
matics, strength, neurodynamics and postural balance); and (5) 
performance assessment. An email was sent to all members of 
the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium 
requesting their participation in the online questionnaire. Partic-
ipants were required to complete the online questionnaire within 
4 weeks of receiving the invitation email. A reminder email was 
sent to all participants 2 
weeks after the initial invitation email. 
Regarding the online questionnaire, participants were requested 
to respond to questions related to the importance of different 
constructs of the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain 
injuries on a scale of 1–5 (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 
3=no 
opinion; 4=agree; and 5=strongly agree). They also had 
the opportunity to elaborate further on how they would assess 
certain structures or functions by providing expanded answers 
to open-ended questions. The responses to the online ques-
tionnaire were collated, analysed (completed August 2017) and 
used as the foundation for a subsequent consensus meeting of 
the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium 
(ie, international multidisciplinary expert group). This consensus 
meeting (held on 14 September 2017) represented round 2 of 
this modified Delphi method.
data analysis
Data from round 1 were automatically extracted from the online 
questionnaire to a Google Sheets document. For questions with 
a Likert scale response, frequency tables were automatically 
generated, and the level of agreement was calculated for each 
response. To establish the level of agreement, the total percentage 
of ‘strongly agree’ (5 on the Likert scale) and ‘agree’ (4 on the 
Likert scale) responses was calculated. Consensus agreement was 
defined as ≥75%, partial agreement was defined as 50%–75% 
agreement, while no agreement was defined as <50%. Qualita-
tive data (ie, open-ended responses to questions as part of the 
online questionnaire) and responses that reached partial agree-
ment were used as discussion points in round 2 of the modified 
Delphi process.
resulTs
After two consecutive modified Delphi rounds, performed 
between May 2017 and September 2017, full consensus was 
achieved on the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain 
injuries (figure 1 and table 1).
expert panel
Fourteen experts from the executive committee of the Inter-
national Ankle Consortium were invited to participate, all of 
who agreed. The expert panel (males=84.6%, females=15.4%; 
age=45±6.2 years) were employed in a number of countries 
including Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, USA 
and the UK. All expert panel members had authored or coau-
thored numerous peer-reviewed articles on the topics of lateral 
ankle sprain and chronic ankle instability, as well as having 
contributed to previous consensus statements. The years of clin-
ical experience varied (15.7±13.5 years) across the members. 
The expert panel members assessed an average of 40 patients a 
year with lateral ankle sprain injuries and/or chronic ankle insta-
bility. The expert panel members identified their expertise in 
the clinical assessment of patients with acute lateral ankle sprain 
injuries and/or chronic ankle instability as an average of 8 out of 
10, with 10 being the highest level of expertise.
delphi round 1
All experts (100%) participated in round 1; however, answers 
for one participant were excluded due to technical issues. 
Thirteen participants successfully completed round 1. Expert 
consensus (≥75% 
agreement) was reached on 37 of the 62 
questions included in the online questionnaire. Fifteen criteria 
reached partial agreement (50%–75%) and hence were brought 
forward for discussion in round 2. Online supplementary file 
table 1 details the level of agreement for each of the questions in 
the online questionnaire.
delphi round 2
Ten of the 14 expert panel members were able to attend the exec-
utive committee meeting of the International Ankle Consortium, 
which functioned as round 2 of the modified Delphi process. 
This meeting took place the day before the 7th International 
Ankle Symposium (14 September 2017). Results from round 1, 
which reached ≥75% 
agreement, were automatically included 
in this consensus. Results from round 1 that reached partial 
agreement (50%–75%) along with responses to open-ended 
questions (part of the online questionnaire) were discussed 
further among the 10 experts who were present at round 2. To 
establish the level of agreement in round 2, the total percentage 
of ‘strongly agree’ (5 on the Likert scale) and ‘agree’ (4 on the 
Likert scale) responses was calculated. Consensus agreement was 
defined as ≥75%. Final consensus was reached in round 2 and is 
presented in figure 1 and table 1.

Consensus statement
consensus on recommendations for clinical assessment of acute 
lateral ankle sprain injuries. With regard to injury diagnosis, 
there were five important considerations, which the expert panel 
reached consensus on. These are as follows: (1) mechanism of 
injury; (2) history of previous lateral ankle sprain; (3) weight-
bearing status; (4) clinical assessment of bones; and (5) clinical 
assessment of ligaments. Hence, the experts agreed that these 
should be clustered into a clinical diagnostic assessment.
Regarding the evaluation of mechanical and sensorimotor 
impairments, there were 10 important considerations, which 
the expert panel reached consensus on. These are as follows: (1) 
pain; (2) swelling; (3) range of motion; (4) arthrokinematics; (5)

balance; (8) gait; (9) physical activity level; and (10) patient-re-
ported outcome measures. Hence, the experts agreed that these 
should be clustered and termed the International Ankle Consor-
tium Rehabilitation-Oriented ASsessmenT (ROAST). We advo-
cate that clinicians should consult these recommendations as 
they detail an imperative first step towards the development of 
an appropriate management pathway for this prevalent injury.
Clinical diagnostic assessment
The expert panel agreed on a pragmatic minimum standard 
clinical diagnostic assessment, which does not require specialist 
equipment (eg, diagnostic imaging) and can be applied across a 
range of clinical settings.
Mechanism of injury
Establishing the mechanism of injury is advocated as it can 
give clinicians an indication of what anatomical structures are 
likely to have incurred insult, and hence what tissues should be 
prioritised during clinical assessment. Numerous published arti-
cles have described the kinematics of lateral ankle sprain injury 
occurrences.19–24 Clinicians should suspect injury to the lateral 
ligaments of the ankle joint if the patient reports that the mech-
anism of injury involved a sudden rapid inversion and internal 
rotation loading of the foot and ankle complex, irrespective of 
sagittal plane angular displacement. The mechanisms of injury 
associated with ankle syndesmosis ligament injuries are less clear 
but have been reported to include external rotation of the foot, 
eversion of the talus within the ankle mortise and excessive 
dorsiflexion.25 Therefore, clinicians should suspect injury to the 
syndesmosis ligaments if the patient describes/recalls any of the 
aforementioned injury mechanisms (ie, external rotation of the 
foot and hyperdorsiflexion).
History of previous lateral ankle sprain
Establishing history of previous lateral ankle sprain injury 
or ankle joint injury is endorsed primarily for two reasons. 
First, it has been established that previous lateral ankle sprain 
injury heightens the risk of injury recurrence.26 27Second, if the 
presenting patient has previously sustained a lateral ankle sprain 
injury, it is probable that injury-associated mechanical and senso-
rimotor impairments are present, which should be addressed as 
part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme.
Weight-bearing status
Weight-bearing status should be established, both via subjective 
reporting related to the time of injury and during clinical presen-
tation in accordance with the Ottawa Ankle Rules. An inability 
to weight-bear four steps immediately after injury and on clin-
ical presentation should alert clinicians to the possibility of 
ankle joint fracture.28 The likelihood of ankle joint fracture can 
be established with high sensitivity by using the Ottawa Ankle 
Rules, whereby weight-bearing status and clinical assessment of 
the ‘malleolar zone’ are combined in a clinical prediction rule.28
Clinical assessment of bones
The Ottawa Ankle Rules28 should be used to determine the like-
lihood of ankle joint fracture. If a patient reports pain in the 
‘malleolar zone’ and if this is accompanied by pain on palpation 
of the distal 6 
cm of the posterior edge of the medial malleolus, 
or pain on palpation of the distal 6 
cm of the posterior edge of 
the lateral malleolus, or an inability to weight-bear four steps 
immediately after injury and on clinical presentation, then an 
ankle joint X-ray is warranted (online supplementary appendix 
I). The Ottawa Ankle Rules have been reported to have higher 
sensitivity than specificity, meaning that they are better at ruling 
out the possibility of ankle joint fracture, rather than making a 
diagnosis of ankle joint fracture.29 Following an inversion and 
internal rotation injury of the ankle joint, the pretest proba-
bility of ankle joint fracture is less than 15%.30 If the Ottawa 
Ankle Rules are implemented in such instances but findings are 
negative (ie, none of the rules are positive; negative likelihood 
ratio=0.02), the post-test probability of ankle joint fracture is 
less than 1%.
Clinical assessment of ligaments
The clinical assessment of the integrity of the lateral ligaments of 
the ankle joint, as well as the ankle joint syndesmosis ligaments is 
advocated. The main lateral ligamentous stabilisers of the ankle 
joint are: the anterior talofibular ligament, the calcaneofibular liga-
ment and the posterior talofibular ligament. The anterior talofib-
ular ligament is the most commonly injured of these ligaments.31 
It originates at the anterior margin of the lateral malleolus, and it 
runs anteromedially to insert on the talar body immediately ante-
rior to the joint surface occupied by the lateral malleolus.32 Repli-
cation of the patient’s ‘known pain’ on palpation and/or stressing 
(ie, passive plantar flexion and inversion) of the anterior talofib-
ular ligament is indicative of injury to this ligament (online supple-
mentary appendix I). Clinical stability tests to assess for complete 
disruption of the anterior talofibular ligament are best performed 
between 4 days and 6 days after injury.33 The anterior drawer test 
is the most sensitive clinical stability test to assess for complete 
rupture of the anterior talofibular ligament.33 The sensitivity and 
specificity of this test are 0.96 and 0.84, respectively, with an asso-
ciated negative likelihood ratio of 0.04.33 This means that if there 
is no ‘sulcus sign’ on testing the integrity of the anterior talofibular 
ligament using the anterior drawer test, then there is low proba-
bility that it is completely disrupted/ruptured (online supplemen-
tary appendix I).
The calcaneofibular ligament originates from the anterior part 
of the lateral malleolus and courses obliquely downwards and 
backwards to attach to the posterior region of the lateral calca-
neal surface.32 It is superficially crossed by the peroneal tendons 
and sheaths, with only approximately 1 
cm of the ligament being 
uncovered and directly palpable. Replication of the patient’s 
‘known pain’ on palpation and/or stressing (ie, passive dorsi-
flexion of the ankle joint combined with passive inversion of the 
rearfoot) of the calcaneofibular ligament is indicative of injury to 
this ligament (online supplementary appendix I).
The prevalence of ankle joint syndesmosis ligament injury (with 
or without concomitant lateral ligament involvement) has been 
reported to be 20%.31 As such, it is important to undertake a clin-
ical assessment of the ankle joint syndesmosis ligaments. Sman and 
colleagues34 have reported that localised tenderness on palpation 
of the syndesmosis ligaments is the most sensitive clinical assess-
ment test (sensitivity=0.92), while the squeeze test is the most 
specific clinical assessment test (specificity=0.88). Thus, if the 
most sensitive clinical assessment test (palpation of the syndesmosis 
ligaments) and the most specific clinical assessment test (squeeze 
test) are positive, there is a high probability of injury to the syndes-
mosis ligaments (online supplementary appendix I).

Consensus statement
determine the true presence of these impairments in the acute 
phase following injury clinicians can potentially use the non-in-
jured side as a comparator.
Pain
Quantification of a patient’s current self-reported ankle joint 
pain is endorsed. Self-reported pain should be used as a clin-
ically oriented outcome measure to guide the progression of 
exercise-based rehabilitation and to assess the efficacy of treat-
ments implemented. Numerous options exist for assessing ankle 
joint pain in clinical settings. The numeric rating scale for pain 
is a valid and reliable scale to measure pain intensity.35 It can be 
administered both verbally and in writing and can be used to 
quantify pain during various activities. However, it only evalu-
ates one component of the pain experience, namely, pain inten-
sity. The assessment of ankle-specific pain is a central component 
of the Foot and Ankle Disability Index, which is a patient-re-
ported outcome questionnaire designed to assess functional 
limitations related to foot and ankle conditions.36
Swelling
The assessment of ankle joint swelling is advocated. Ankle joint 
swelling may alter somatosensory input to the central nervous 
system which, through the process of arthrogenic muscle inhibi-
tion, could negatively affect functional joint stability.37 The quan-
tification of ankle joint swelling should be used as a clinically 
oriented outcome measure to direct exercise-based rehabilitation 
progression and to measure the efficacy of therapeutic interven-
tions. The figure-of-eight method has been reported to be a valid 
and reliable clinically applicable method for indirectly quantifying 
ankle joint swelling (online supplementary appendix I).38–41
Range of motion
A comprehensive assessment of both passive and active ankle 
joint range of motion is endorsed. The quantification of ankle 
joint range of motion should be used as a clinically oriented 
outcome measure to guide exercise-based rehabilitation progres-
sion and to gauge the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Of 
particular concern following lateral ankle sprain injury is the 
propensity for the development of a restriction in ankle joint 
dorsiflexion range of motion.42 Sufficient ankle joint dorsi-
flexion range of motion is important as it has been reported to 
explain up to 28% of the variance in dynamic postural balance 
performance, as assessed via the anterior reach direction of the 
Star Excursion Balance Test.43 The weight-bearing lunge test is 
a clinically applicable, valid and reliable method for assessing 
ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion (online supplementary 
appendix I).44–46
Arthrokinematics
Assessment of talocrural joint arthrokinematics is advocated. It 
has been proposed that impairments in ankle joint dorsiflexion 
range of motion are likely related to a disruption in talocrural 
arthrokinematics.16 This is supported by studies that have 
reported either restrictions in posterior talar glide,47 48 or the 
existence of an anterior positional fault of the talus within the 
talocrural joint.49 50 The posterior talar glide test as reported by 
Denegar et al48 can be used to assess posterior glide of the talus 
within the talocrural joint.
Muscle strength
Assessment of ankle joint muscle strength is advocated. During 
the contractile process, musculotendinous units generate 
stiffness, resulting in dynamic protection of joints. A strength 
deficit of the ankle musculature could compromise the integ-
rity of the ankle joint to withstand sudden injurious movements. 
Individuals with chronic ankle instability have been reported to 
exhibit deficits in ankle joint strength.51 Muscle strength can be 
measured objectively using isokinetic dynamometers and hand-
held dynamometers. A hand-held dynamometer offers a prac-
tical, clinically applicable alternative to isokinetic dynamometry 
due to its portability, reduced cost and convenient size.52 Ankle 
joint strength can be measured in an objective and reliable 
manner using hand-held dynamometry (online supplementary 
appendix I).53 Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that hip 
strength may be an important factor to also consider, as research 
has identified proximal strength deficits in individuals with 
chronic ankle instability.54
Static postural balance
Assessing static postural balance is endorsed as an integral 
component of a rehabilitation-oriented clinical assessment 
following acute lateral ankle sprain injury. Deficiencies in static 
postural balance have been consistently identified in individuals 
with chronic ankle instability.55 Both the Balance Error Scoring 
System56 and the Foot Lift Test57 are clinically applicable methods 
for assessing static postural balance performance (online supple-
mentary appendix I).
Dynamic postural balance
Assessing dynamic postural balance is endorsed as a central compo-
nent of a rehabilitation-oriented clinical assessment following 
acute lateral ankle sprain injury. Impairments in dynamic postural 
balance performance have been steadfastly identified in individuals 
with chronic ankle instability.55 58 The Star Excursion Balance Test 
can be readily used in the clinic to assess dynamic postural balance 
performance (online supplementary appendix I).58
Gait
Assessment of walking gait is endorsed following acute lateral 
ankle sprain injury. It has been posited that the high potential 
for lateral ankle sprain injury recurrence during gait is likely due 
to inappropriate positioning of the lower extremity joints in the 
loading–unloading transitions between stance and swing.59 60 
Aberrancies in lower extremity biomechanics during walking 
gait have been consistently identified in individuals with chronic 
ankle instability.61 62
Physical activity level
Establishing the patient’s level of physical activity prior to incur-
ring their lateral ankle sprain injury is endorsed primarily for two 
reasons. First, it can help guide the specificity of exercise-based 
rehabilitation. Second, it can be used to establish whether the 
patient has returned to his or her preinjury participation level. 
An example of an appropriate questionnaire is the Tegner activi-
ty-level scale (online supplementary appendix I).63
Patient-reported outcome measures
Patient-reported outcome measures improve the quality of 
assessing, and reporting the outcome of treatments and their use 
as part of a rehabilitation-oriented clinical assessment following 
lateral ankle sprain injury is advocated. A number of patient-re-
ported outcome measures exist, which have been commonly used 
with individuals with chronic ankle instability.64 Examples of 
appropriate patient-reported outcome measures to assess func-
tion of the ankle include the Foot and Ankle Disability Index36

Future research
High-quality prospective research is needed to determine 
whether these recommendations for clinical assessment of acute 
lateral ankle sprain injuries can optimise the management of 
individuals who have incurred this injury.
ConClusIon
The executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium 
reached consensus on recommendations for structured clinical 
assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. Recommenda-
tions are provided on an initial diagnostic clinical assessment. 
The International Ankle Consortium ROAST is also presented, 
which places emphasis on the assessment of mechanical and 
sensorimotor impairments that are known to associate with 
chronic ankle instability.
