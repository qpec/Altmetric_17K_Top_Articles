ABSTRACT
Objective Since 2010, England has experienced relative 
constraints in public expenditure on healthcare (PEH) and 
social care (PES). We sought to determine whether these 
constraints have affected mortality rates.
Methods We collected data on health and social care 
resources and finances for England from 2001 to 
2014. Time trend analyses were conducted to compare 
the actual mortality rates in 2011–2014 with the 
counterfactual rates expected based on trends before 
spending constraints. Fixed-effects regression analyses 
were conducted using annual data on PES and PEH with 
mortality as the outcome, with further adjustments for 
macroeconomic factors and resources. Analyses were 
stratified by age group, place of death and lower-tier local 
authority (n=325). Mortality rates to 2020 were projected 
based on recent trends.
Results Spending constraints between 2010 and 2014 
were associated with an estimated 45 368 (95% CI 
34 530 to 56 206) higher than expected number of deaths 
compared with pre-2010 trends. Deaths in those aged 
≥60 and in care homes accounted for the majority. PES 
was more strongly linked with care home and home 
mortality than PEH, with each £10 per capita decline in 
real PES associated with an increase of 5.10 (3.65–6.54) 
(p<0.001) care home deaths per 100 000. These 
associations persisted in lag analyses and after adjustment 
for macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, we found that 
changes in real PES per capita may be linked to mortality 
mostly via changes in nurse numbers. Projections to 2020 
based on 2009-2014 trend was cumulatively linked to 
an estimated 152 141 (95% CI 134 597 and 169 685) 
additional deaths.
Conclusions Spending constraints, especially PES, are 
associated with a substantial mortality gap. We suggest 
that spending should be targeted on improving care 
delivered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or 
increasing nurse numbers.
InTROduCTIOn
Health 
systems 
in 
most 
industrialised 
countries are facing the concurrent chal-
lenge of managing rising demand amidst 
funding constraints, following the recent 
global economic crisis. The National Health 
Service (NHS) in England, which provides 
tax-funded, universal health coverage, is no 
exception.1–4 Since 2010, the NHS in England 
has seen a real-term annual increase in public 
healthcare spending of 1.30% between 2010 
and 2014, as compared with historical annual 
growth of around 4%.4 During the same 
period, demand and healthcare cost inflation 
have increased, with a growing and ageing 
population, in addition to new treatments 
and technologies. By 2020/2021, a funding 
gap, between what is needed and what is 
available, has been predicted, unless major 
changes are implemented.4 
Although the role of social determinants in 
health is increasingly acknowledged,5 there 
is underinvestment in social care in many 
high-income countries such as the USA.6 In 
England, public sector funding for social 
care has suffered.7 Such funds enable the 
provision of means-tested home care and 
care home accommodation,8 allowing, for 
example, hospitals to discharge frail patients 
who would otherwise have no adequate 
support. Real-term adult social care spending 
decreased by 1.19% annually between 2010 
and 2014 after correcting for the effect of 
inflation, reversing the annual increase of 
3.17% between 2001 and 2009. This is despite 
increasing demand, with the group most

likely to require social care—the over 85s—set to rise 
from 1.6 million in 2015 to 1.8 million in 2020.9
This supply–demand mismatch has manifested in 
several ways. During the first week of 2017, more than 4 
in 10 NHS hospitals declared a major alert.10 Emergency 
medicine departments (A&E) saw 900 000 (4.6%) more 
attendances in 2015/2016 compared with the previous 
year, and 4% more emergency hospital admissions.11 Over 
the past 2 years, the number of elderly patients waiting 
over 12 hours in A&E has trebled, and there has been a 
31% increase in delayed hospital discharges.11
While the funding gaps facing health and social care 
have been well quantified,12 13 the impact on population 
outcomes remains unclear. Here we sought to model the 
past, present and future impact of funding constraints 
experienced by the publicly financed health and social 
care system in England on mortality, to provide insights 
into the association between funding and health outcomes 
and inform future financial allocations.

data collection
Population mortality, potential years of life lost and life expectancy
Annual population mortality data for England were 
extracted from the UK’s Office for National Statistics 
(ONS)14 based on Medical Certificates of Cause of Death 
from the Registration Online system. Age-standardised 
death rates (ASDR) were calculated with reference to a 
standard European population using mortality data split 
into 10 age groups (see online supplementary appendix). 
Information on deaths by place of occurrence (care 
homes, hospice, home, hospital and other establish-
ments) was provided by Public Health England. Addition-
ally, mortality data were collected for 325 lower tier local 
authorities, which are the equal of districts, boroughs or 
city councils, based on 2010 boundaries with Cornwall 
and the Isles of Scilly combined, due to the small popula-
tion of the latter. Data on life expectancy were obtained 
from the ONS, whereas data on potential years of life lost 
(PYLL), a measure of premature mortality from causes 
considered amenable to healthcare, were obtained from 
the UK Health and Social Care Information Centre15 and 
age standardised.
Spending and resources data
Nominal public expenditure on health (PEH) data were 
defined as total expenditure limits for the Department 
of Health (responsible for the NHS in England), for the 
financial years 2001/2002 to 2014/2015, and were collated 
from Her Majesty’s Treasury’s Public Expenditure Statis-
tical Analyses.16 To account for inflation, real PEH using 
2014/2015 financial year prices was calculated as the 
product of nominal PEH and the gross domestic product 
(GDP) deflator for a given financial year, divided by 100, 
which denoted the GDP deflator for the financial year 
2014/2015. To ease interpretation, real PEH per capita was 
converted to units of £10. Public expenditure on social care 
(PES) in nominal terms was defined as total gross adult 
social care expenditure, which excludes the Supporting 
People fund (a block grant to local government supporting 
vulnerable people living in their own homes available from 
2003/2004) and NHS transfers.17 Further details, including 
health and social care resources (staff and bed numbers), 
are provided in the online supplementary appendix.
Statistical analysis
For all analyses, we used 2001 as the start of the study 
period since complete population mortality data were 
available from this year onwards. To assess mortality 
gap, time trend analyses were conducted using Poisson 
or quasi-Poisson regression models with all-cause ASDR 
as the dependent variable and calendar year as the inde-
pendent variable. Analyses were stratified by sex and 
repeated using rates of PYLL and life expectancy as alter-
native health outcomes. Analysis for mortality outcomes 
was further stratified by age groups and place of death as 
well as their combination, and by local government area. 
Further details are provided in the online supplementary 
appendix.
Fixed-effects regression models were conducted using 
real PEH/PES per capita and controls for economic varia-
tion (unemployment18 and the average annual consumer 
price index19) and average weekly pensions as the inde-
pendent variables, and care home, home and hospital 
mortality as the dependent variables. For a given year, 
population mortality on the same year was the outcome 
whereas spending data for a financial year starting at the 
given year was used as the main predictor. Since popula-
tion mortality was collected annually and spending data 
is reported for each financial year (starting 1 April in 
the UK), we repeated our analysis using 1 and 2-year lag 
periods. We additionally incorporated both PEH and PES 
in the same model.
Effects of public spending on resources such as staff 
or infrastructure have been documented20 and these 
resources have also been linked with health outcomes.21 
Therefore, we explored resources of health and social 
care as potential mediating factors by running fixed-ef-
fects regression models with real PEH/PES per capita 
and each resource variable as the independent variables; 
and care home/home mortality as the dependent vari-
able. Resource variables that were associated with the 
dependent variable, resulted in weaker associations 
between PEH/PES and the dependent variable, and 
retained the same coefficient sign as univariable regres-
sions were considered to be putative mediators. Analyses 
were repeated for 1 and 2-year lag periods.
To investigate the possibility of a future population 
mortality gap, two different mortality projection anal-
yses for 2015–2020 were performed. Each analysis had 
a different observation base: one using 2001–2010 data 
and the other using 2009–2014 data, with the number 
of projected deaths based on 2001–2010 data subtracted 
from the number of projected deaths based on 2009–
2014 data.

Finally, using fixed-effects regression modelling, the

mortality gap on top of planned spending budgets, as of 
2016, was computed for three different efficiency hypo-
thetical scenarios: 0%, 1% and 3% (see online supple-
mentary appendix for a definition and explanation).22
ReSulTS
health and social care spending
From 2001/2002 to 2009/2010, the average annual 
increase in real PEH per capita was 3.82%. Between 
2010/2011 and 2014/2015, the average annual increase 
was 0.41% (online supplementary figure S1). Planned 
real PEH spending to 2020/2021 is forecasted to increase 
at an average of 0.72% per year, based on published infor-
mation up to 2016. Real PES per capita experienced an 
average annual increase of 2.20% between 2001/2002 and 
2009/2010, while between 2010/2011 and 2014/2015 it 
decreased by 1.57% annually.
Assessment of a mortality gap
From 2001 to 2010, the absolute number of deaths in 
England decreased by an average of 0.77% per year. From 
2011 to 2014, the number of deaths increased by an average 
of 0.87% per year. To quantify the potential mortality 
gap associated with the 2010 spending constraints, we 
compared actual and predicted mortality rates for both 
sexes and found 8148 higher than expected number of 
deaths in 2012 (95% CI 2004 to 14 292), 18 896 (95% CI 
12 641 to 25 152) in 2013, and 18 324 (95% CI 11 953 to 
24 695) in 2014 (figure 1). Sex-stratified time series anal-
yses revealed similar results between men and women 
(online supplementary table S1).
To validate these results, we looked at two alternative 
health outcomes: life expectancy and PYLL. We found 
2012–2014 male and female life expectancy to be 3.84 
months (2.40–5.28) and 5.16 months (3.36–7.08) less, 
respectively, than the values anticipated from 2001–
2003 to 2009–2011 data (online supplementary table 
S2). Moreover, we found that PYLL increased after the 
2009/2010 spending constraints compared with predicted 
rates (online supplementary table S3).
To see whether the possible effects of the 2010 
spending constraints were sensitive to age, we conducted 
time series analyses for 10 different age groups (online 
supplementary table S4). Higher than expected numbers 
of deaths were confined to those ≥60 years of age with 
all six ≥60 age groups showing excess deaths in 2013. 
By contrast, <60 age groups most often exhibited fewer 
deaths.
We next looked at place of death for all age groups, 
while stratifying them by age into <60 and those ≥60 
years. Time trend analyses revealed care home and home 
deaths to be the first and second largest contributors, 
respectively, to excess deaths across age groups and in 
those ≥60 (figure 2 and online supplementary figure S2 
and supplementary table S5), with a relative increase in 
these places of death over others during the study period. 
For every year analysed, lower than expected numbers of 
deaths occurred in hospitals. For those <60 years, hospi-
tals were the most frequent place of death, and so the net 
result was a lower than expected number of <60 deaths. 
Time series analyses by local government area (for time 
points up to 2013) revealed no correlation between 
changes in the number of expected deaths and depriva-
tion (p=0.14, RS=0.08).
longitudinal associations between spending and mortality
We found that £10 per capita declines in real PEH 
and real PES were associated with increases of 0.19 
(0.01–0.38) (p=0.049) and 5.10 (3.65–6.54) (p<0.001) 
care home deaths per 100 000 in England, respectively 
(table 1). For PES, these relationships persisted at least 
2 years after the initial change but became weaker for 
PEH. We next sought to demonstrate that these asso-
ciations were independent of macroeconomic forces 
such as unemployment (for younger age groups) and 
pensions (for older age groups), which have each been 
linked with increased mortality.23 24 On adjusting the 
regression models for macroeconomic factors and the 
annual average of weekly pensions, we found real PES 
per capita and real PEH per capita to remain inversely 
associated with care home mortality (table 1). Next, we

used a regression model with both real PES and PEH 
per capita as explanatory variables and found only PES 
remained inversely associated with care home mortality 
(table 1). In this model, the variance inflation factor 
between PEH and PES was 4.15, suggesting that multi-
collinearity was not a problem. The results for home 
deaths replicated those for care home deaths (online 
supplementary table S6). In contrast to care home and 
home mortality, real PEH per capita was more strongly 
related to hospital mortality than real PES per capita 
without adjusting for controls. On adjusting for macro-
economic forces, the relationship between PEH and 
hospital mortality was no longer apparent (online 
supplementary table S7).

Identification of resources potentially mediating the 
spending–mortality relationship
We found that the numbers of NHS hospital and commu-
nity nurses, and NHS health and social care clinical support 
staff were each associated with care home mortality. 
These factors alleviated the relationship between real 
PES per capita and care home mortality at lag years 1 and 
2, suggesting these staff numbers were important medi-
ators of the spending–mortality relationship (table 2). 
We found the number of nurses, but not clinical support 
staff, was suggested to be a mediator of the relation-
ship between spending (both PEH and PES) and home 
mortality rates for lag years 1 and 2 (online supplemen-
tary table S8). We also found the number of nurses to be 
the sole mediator of the relationships between PEH per 
capita and care home mortality (online supplementary 
table S9) and PEH per capita and home mortality (online 
supplementary table S10) for all years. From 2001 to 2010, 
the average annual increase in nurse numbers was 1.61% 
whereas from 2010 to 2014, the average annual increase 
was over 20-fold lower at 0.07% (online supplementary 
table S11).
Mortality projections to 2020 and scenario modelling
We projected mortality rates to 2020 using two observa-
tion bases: one using 2001–2010 data and a second using 
2009–2014 (2009 and 2010 were included to ensure 
a sufficiently large observation base). We found that 
the 2009–2014-based projection entailed an additional 
152 141 deaths (aggregate 95% CI 134 597 to 169 685) 
from 2015 to 2020 compared with the 2001–2010-based 
projection (online supplementary figure S3).
To determine what it would take to close this gap above 
planned health and social care spending to 2020/2021, we 
modelled three different scenarios (figure 3 and online 
supplementary table S12). On top of the combined 
health and social care budget, as of the end of 2016, 
the aggregate spending and efficiency combinations 
required to completely close the mortality gap would 
be: an additional £29.56 billion (£25.74–£33.37 billion) 
for a conservative 0% annual efficiency increase; an 
additional £27.26 billion (£23.61–£30.91 billion) for a 
moderate 1% annual efficiency increase; and an addi-
tional £23.03 billion (£19.67–£26.39 billion) for an 
aggressive 3% annual efficiency increase (figure 3 with 
an annual breakdown in online supplementary table 
S12). Under an ideal scenario in which no additional 
spending would be needed to close the mortality gap, the 
annual efficiency increase to 2020 would need to reach 
10.79% (7.8–14.46). In these scenarios, efficiency gains 
reflect improvements across the system required to meet

This study demonstrates that recent constraints in PEH 
and PES spending in England were associated with nearly 
45 000 higher than expected numbers of deaths between 
2012 and 2014. If these trends continue, even when 
considering the increased planned funding as of 2016, 
we estimate approximately 150 000 additional deaths may 
arise between 2015 and 2020. Combining these projected 
excess deaths and the observed deaths prior to 2015 
translates to around 120 000 excess deaths from 2010 to 
2017. Contemporaneous reductions in life expectancy 
and excesses in measures of preventable death both vali-
dated our mortality findings.
The excess deaths observed in our study corroborate 
recent evidence highlighting the reversal of declining 
mortality trends observed in England and Wales in the 
past decade.13 Similar to findings reported by Hiam

Figure 3 Additional spending needed to close the 2020 mortality gap. Data are shown for PEH (blue) and on top of that, PES 
(beige), in real terms according to 2014/2015 prices. Actual out-turn data are shown for 2001/2002 to 2014/2015. However, for 
2015/2016 to 2020/2021, the budgeted total Department of Health expenditure limit is shown for PEH. For PES, data are based 
on the continuation of −2.25% annual percentage change in core PES in 2014/2015 supplemented by the potential revenue 
from the adult social care precept for council tax.12 Additional spending needed to close the projected mortality gap for each 
year from 2015 to 2020 is shown as color-coded dotted lines for three different scenarios, each of which assumes different 
annual efficiency improvements. The additional annual spending numbers with associated 95% 
CI are shown as bar plots for 
each scenario. PEH, public expenditure on healthcare; PES, public expenditure on social care.
and colleagues,13 we observed that those aged ≥60 years 
are most susceptible to the observed excess mortality 
burden, as compared with those aged <60 years. We 
added to this evidence by additionally evaluating PYLL 
and life expectancy as outcomes, projecting excess 
deaths to 2020, determining potential mediating factors 
which may explain the observed excess deaths, and 
testing different hypothetical scenarios of funding and 
efficiency improvement which may be able to close the 
mortality gap.
By setting, deaths at care homes and at home contrib-
uted most to the observed ‘mortality gap’, while hospital 
mortality was lower than expected. This is most likely 
because social care experienced greater relative spending 
constraints than healthcare. Furthermore, the recent 
drive to move patients with poor prognoses and who have 
reached their ceiling of care away from the hospital envi-
ronment to care homes or their own homes may have 
contributed to this.25 It is also important to consider the 
architectural differences between health and social care 
delivery in England. The NHS provides publicly delivered 
universal health coverage, with studies suggesting this 
confers a protective effect during episodes of substantial 
cost constraint.26 In contrast, social care is means tested 
and often privately delivered, without universal coverage; 
factors that may influence access and quality.
The associations observed between PEH, PES and 
mortality were independent of macroeconomic changes 
that often co-occur with periods of reduced public sector 
spending. However, adjustment for potential mediating 
factors, nursing numbers in particular, nullified the asso-
ciations between PEH, PES and mortality. Our study 
suggests that the number of NHS-qualified nurses is the 
strongest tested mediator of the relationships between 
spending, and care home and home mortality; this is 
congruent with findings in other reports.27
This study has several policy implications. First, it 
demonstrates that decelerated increases in PEH and 
PES, in England, may have adversely affected popula-
tion mortality as demand increased and healthcare costs 
rose above inflation. This demonstrates that while health 
system design and ambition, such as delivery of universal 
coverage, is important, it must be adequately financed 
to ensure design translates into health improvement. 
Second, the finding that the elderly population and those 
in care homes were the most vulnerable to recent finan-
cial challenges, makes a strong case for targeted interven-
tions to ensure adequate management of these patient

groups.4 This includes funding increases in social care, 
in addition to maintenance or rises in nursing numbers 
aligned with demand. Third, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, there remains a prospective cost to the current 
trajectory of system financing that entails a number of 
excess deaths. While it would be presumptive to class 
these deaths as avoidable (we have used the terms ‘addi-
tional’ or ‘excess’ to describe higher than expected 
numbers; however it is not possible to determine the 
extent to which these deaths may be entirely preventable), 
we have outlined several funding efficiency scenarios that 
attempt to demonstrate how such a gap could perhaps be 
closed. Given that the health system has historically 
achieved 1%–2% annual productivity improvements, and 
that current demand is unprecedented, it seems unlikely 
that greater annual improvements could be expected. 
After factoring in planned government spending, and 
the £2 billion funding increase to social care announced 
in the 2017 Spring Budget, our analyses based on 1% 
annual productivity increase suggest that a cumulative 
spending increase of approximately £25.3 billion would 
be required to close this gap across health and social care 
by 2020/2021, equating to around £6.3 billion annually. 
Future studies may be needed to provide in-depth inves-
tigations on how funding allocations across PEH and PES 
may influence projected mortality rates.
This is the first study to provide an in-depth analysis 
of the potential effects of constraints in PEH and PES, 
on mortality. In this regard, we did not intend to analyse 
general changes in government policy, priorities or the 
overall environment in which health and social spending 
operates. A limitation was that our study was observational 
and retrospective, thereby our findings likely capture asso-
ciation rather than causation. Future studies combining 
different countries or regions with and without spending 
constraints may allow shock-based causal strategies or 
natural experiments which mimic random assignment in 
clinical trials. We were unable to analyse specific causes 
of death as outcomes because there were differences in 
how causes of death in 2001–2010 and 2010 onwards were 
coded, resulting in a lack of comparability for causes of 
death such as circulatory disease.28 Finally, between 2010 
and 2012, nurse numbers dropped by approximately 
6000, which, by our regression analyses, translates to 
approximately 10% of expected deaths for that period. 
Therefore, the changes in NHS-qualified nurse numbers 
must only be partly responsible for the putative relation-
ship between spending and mortality. Other resources 
and complex, emergent behaviour, which do not depend 
solely on the component parts of the health and social 
care system but rather on their interactions with one 
another, might also explain some of the additional deaths 
observed.
COnCluSIOn
We have found that spending constraints since 2010, 
especially PES, may have produced a substantial 
mortality gap in England. Our analyses demonstrate 
that if demand-side solutions are infeasible, large 
improvements in efficiency or, more feasibly, spending 
above growth in demand (and not just general infla-
tion) are required to close this gap. We suggest that 
spending should be targeted on improving care deliv-
ered in care homes and at home; and maintaining or 
increasing nurse numbers.
