 Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is a large-
scale government funded programme that has dramatically changed
the face of psychological care in England since its inception in 2008.1
Its defining features include the provision of evidence-based psycho-
logical treatments informed by clinical guidelines, the delivery of
interventions in a stepped-care model and the routine application
ofvalidatedpatient-reportedoutcomemeasures(PROMs)tomonitor
and evaluate treatment.2 Currently around 147 IAPTservices provide
treatment across 212 clinical commissioning group (CCG) localities.3
Consistent with UK government policy,4 mental health services
are expected to attain measurable outcomes for equitable access
to care, waiting times, clinical improvement and satisfaction. Current
policy rhetoric emphasises the notion of ‘recovery’ from common
mental disorders.4 Informed by outcomes observed in an initial
pilot study,1 the clinical performance of IAPT services is assessed
based on whether at least 50% of treated cases recover according
to data derived from PROMs. Available data3 appear to show very
wide variations in recovery rates across CCG areas, ranging
between 8.2 and 86.6%. At face value this may indicate marked
variations in the quality and effectiveness of care. For example,
a national evaluation report suggested that variability in outcomes
could be partly explained by lack of fidelity to evidence-based
treatment guidelines and lower mean therapy sessions offered by
some services.5 An alternative and overlapping explanation is that
such variability may be influenced by differences in the local
clinical populations. For example, there is a wide gradient of
socioeconomic deprivation across England.6 More deprived local
populations show a greater prevalence of psychiatric morbidity.7
They also appear to be less likely to present to mental health
services8 and less likely to start therapy if they are referred to
psychological care.9 Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that
socioeconomic status is associated with counselling10 and psycho-
therapy treatment outcomes.11 Considering the above, we examined
the relationships between socioeconomic deprivation with referrals,
access to therapy and clinical outcomes in English psychological
services aligned to the national IAPT programme, based on
publically available data3 covering more than 200 local CCG areas.
Method
We obtained available data on new referrals, case-load sizes
(individuals that were referred, accessed therapy and were
discharged from care) and recovery rates nested within 211
identifiable CCG areas across England, for the period July to
September
2014.
This
included
data
on
293 400
referrals
(referrals per CCG between 70 and 4355) and clinical outcomes
for a total of 110 415 patients who accessed therapy (case-load
sizes per CCG 35 to 2425) in the English IAPT system. The
recovery rate calculations are based on validated PROMs,12,13
which are combined into a single index of recovery representing
the number of individuals whose post-treatment depression and
anxiety scores were below established clinical cut-offs used to
screen common mental disorders.1 We matched these data to
the normalised index of multiple deprivation (IMD)6 rank per
each CCG, where a lower rank denotes greater deprivation.
Associations were examined in four steps. First, we calculated
rank correlations between IMD, number of referrals and case-load
sizes per CCG area. Second, we calculated rank correlations
between IMD and recovery rates. A sensitivity analysis excluding
extreme outliers was carried out to assess whether CCG areas with
unusually
large
or
small
recovery
rates
overly
influenced
associations between the variables of interest. Next, we used
weighted least squares regression to assess the proportion of
variance in recovery rates attributable to IMD, and to estimate
adjusted recovery rates. We estimated 95% confidence intervals
weighted by sample size to account for measurement error, and
based on the rationale that services should be expected to perform
at least as well as the ‘average’ IAPT site working within a similar
socioeconomic context. The predictors entered into the regression
model included IMD and a dummy variable to assess the influence
of outlier cases. Finally, we used chi-square and kappa (k)
statistics to compare the classification of CCG areas with sub-
optimal outcomes according to (a) the current 50% benchmark
and (b) the lower 95% confidence interval for the IMD-adjusted
benchmarks. Ethical approval was not required for these analyses,
since they relied on information available in the public domain
that does not contain any personally identifiable patient data.

Summary
Since 2008, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
(IAPT) programme has disseminated evidence-based
interventions for depression and anxiety problems. In order
to maintain quality standards, government policy in England
sets the expectation that 50% of treated patients should meet
recovery criteria according to validated patient-reported
outcome measures. Using national IAPT data, we found
evidence suggesting that the prevalence of mental health
problems is greater in poorer areas and that these areas had
lower average recovery rates. After adjusting benchmarks for
local index of multiple deprivation, we found significant
differences between unadjusted (72.5%) and adjusted (43.1%)
proportions of underperforming clinical commissioning group
areas.

 Results
We observed a statistically significant and negative correlation
between IMD rank and the number of new referrals per CCG
(r = 70.27, P50.001), but IMD was not correlated with case-load
sizes (r = 70.07, P= 0.33). Online Fig. DS1 displays a scatterplot of
recovery rates and IMD rank per each CCG area. Rank correlations
were statistically significant (r = 0.39, P50.001) and excluding
extreme outliers had a negligible influence on the correlation
coefficient (r = 0.38, P50.001). Similarly, outlier cases did not
significantly leverage regression slopes (P = 0.54), so the dummy
variable was removed to attain a parsimonious regression
equation including IMD rank as a single independent variable that
predicted 15.3% of variance in outcome (F = 37.76, d.f.= 1,
P50.001). Agreement between the benchmarking methods was
low (k = 0.45). The 50% benchmark classified a significantly
greater proportion (72.5%) of CCG areas as ‘underperforming’
by comparison with the IMD- adjusted benchmark (43.1%;
w2 = 60.66, d.f.= 1, P50.001). The mean IMD-adjusted recovery
rate for the whole sample was 45.2% (s.d.= 30.0, 95% CI 40.1–50.5).
Discussion
Consistent with the wider literature on psychiatric morbidity,7
higher numbers of referrals for psychological care were moderately
associated with greater deprivation of local areas. However, no
such relationship was found for deprivation and case-load sizes,
which suggests that the ‘inverse care law’ applies in this
context. This could be explained by the detrimental influence of
deprivation on the likelihood of starting therapy after being
referred,9 insufficient healthcare resources in services working in
poor areas, or a combination of both. Furthermore, we found
evidence
of
statistically
significant
associations
between
socioeconomic deprivation and psychological therapy outcomes.
Poorer areas had lower average recovery rates. These associations
were moderate in strength at an aggregate population level. Given
that more detailed data were not accessible at the time of analysis,3
it is unclear whether these associations would remain significant
after controlling for patient-level variables. A range of other factors
including
employment
status,14
baseline
symptom
severity,
functional impairment and variability between therapists are
likely to influence clinical outcomes in psychological care.15
We found that the current 50% recovery target is classifying a
significantly larger number of CCG areas as underperforming (an
additional 29.4%) by comparisonwith the IMD-adjusted benchmark.
It seems improbable that over 70% of IAPT services are attaining
poor outcomes. The most recent national audit for psychological
therapies16 reported aggregated effect sizes of d = 0.88 (interquartile
range (IQR) = 0.78–1.00) for depression and d = 0.98 (IQR = 0.81–
1.09) for anxiety measures across 119 IAPT services. These are
large clinical effects by conventional standards, comparable with
efficacy benchmarks derived from clinical trials.17 Although an
IMD-adjusted benchmark may offer a more realistic estimate,
we recognise that this raises a contentious political issue about
whether it is appropriate to apply what may be perceived as ‘lower
standards’ for some services and not others. A related and perhaps
more palatable consideration is whether services working in more
deprived areas should receive increased funding, commensurate
with the increased psychiatric morbidity and disadvantages of
their local populations. Overall, we caution against the wholesale
application of unadjusted performance targets, and argue for
population-matched and risk-adjusted metrics such as those
advanced in other areas of healthcare.18
