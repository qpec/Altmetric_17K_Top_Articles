ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate the effect of FIFA injury
prevention programmes in football (FIFA 11 and FIFA 11+).
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies
Randomised controlled trials comparing the FIFA injury
prevention programmes with a control (no or sham
intervention) among football players.
Data sources MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via OVID,
CINAHL via Ebsco, Web of Science, SportDiscus and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from 2004 to
14 March 2016.
Results 6 cluster-randomised controlled trials had
assessed the effect of FIFA injury prevention programmes
compared with controls on the overall football injury
incidence in recreational/subelite football. These studies
included 2 specific exercise-based injury prevention
programmes: FIFA 11 (2 studies) and FIFA 11+ (4 studies).
The primary analysis showed a reduction in the overall injury
risk ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.98), p=0.04, in favour
of the FIFA injury prevention programmes. Secondary
analyses revealed that when pooling the 4 studies applying
the FIFA 11+ prevention programme, a reduction in the
overall injury risk ratio (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.61; 95%
CI 0.48 to 0.77, p<0.001) was present in favour of the
FIFA 11+ prevention programme. No reduction was present
when pooling the 2 studies including the FIFA 11
prevention programme (IRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23,
p=0.940).
Conclusions An injury-preventing effect of the FIFA injury
prevention programmes compared with controls was shown
in football. This effect was induced by the FIFA 11+
prevention programme which has a substantial injury-
preventing effect by reducing football injuries by 39%,
whereas a preventive effect of the FIFA 11 prevention
programme could not be documented.

INTRODUCTION
FIFA estimates that more than one-quarter of a
billion people around the world regularly partici-
pate in football (soccer).1 Football has been recog-
nised, together with running, as one of the most
promising sports and leisure time activities to
improve health.2 Football improves cardiovascular
and metabolic health,2 and diminishes risk factors
for lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes and hyperten-
sion.3 However, football also includes an inherent
risk of injury,4 5 which is why injury prevention in
football is crucial.6
European data show that millions of sports-
related injuries occur each year and require medical
attention and of all sports-related injuries seen in
general practice, about one in four are football-
related.7 Furthermore, 5.8 million people each year
are treated at hospitals in Europe due to injuries
associated with sports.8 T
eam ball sports account
for almost half of all hospital-related sports injury
treatment—and football accounts for two-third of
these.8 Since 2004, FIFA has focused on strategies
for injury prevention by introducing FIFA Medical
Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) pre-
vention programmes, known as the FIFA injury pre-
vention programmes, and assessed their effects on
football injury rates.9 These programmes include
specific
strengthening,
balancing
and
jumping/
landing exercises, and are to be included during a
structured warm-up session. The goal of the pro-
grammes
is to
improve
strength,
balance
and
jumping/landing ability, which may lead to injury
reduction.10–12 T
wo variations of such programmes
have been developed and provided by FIFA, the
FIFA
11
and
the
FIFA
11+
prevention
pro-
gramme.10 The FIFA 11+ is a revised version of
the original FIFA 11 prevention programme.10–12
The FIFA 11+ includes similar key exercises as the
FIFA 11 with minor additions, including a more
dynamic warm-up and a more specific progression
model for the included exercises to allow for more
variation
and
optimising
physical
improvement
(figure 1).10–12 The programmes have been tested
in different football cohorts and individual studies,
but with varying effects on injury estimates.10
Findings of no differences in injury estimates from
single studies cannot, however, be considered con-
firmation of no effect.10 This may simply be due to
insufficient power to detect reductions in injury
rates of <40%, which the first FIFA injury preven-
tion programme trial was powered to detect.12
Pooling
data
from
individual
studies
into
a
meta-analysis offers an opportunity to increase stat-
istical power and test whether the FIFA injury pre-
vention programmes are associated with injury
reduction, as originally hypothesised in the initial
studies where FIFA was involved.10–12
Since the specific strategic goal of the F-MARC
since 2009 has been proclaimed to be: ‘to prevent
football
injuries
and
to
promote
football
as
a
health-enhancing leisure activity

tion programmes seems more timely and relevant than ever. Until

e therefore carried out a comprehensive and
up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of the
FIFA injury prevention programmes in football, including only ran-
domised controlled trials, to provide level 1 evidence in this field.
METHODS
W
e used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) as a guideline for this study.15 The
study was registered at PROSPERO (ID=CRD42015024120),
and a publicly available comprehensive study protocol including
data extraction forms was uploaded at the following website:

Deviations from study registration and study protocol
Agreement by raters on risk of bias decisions for the included
randomised controlled studies was calculated as a percentage of
agreement and κ values, and included in the results. Since the
secondary analysis concerning type of programme showed that
only the FIFA 11+ prevention programme was effective in redu-
cing injuries, all secondary outcomes concerning lower limb,
hamstring, knee and ankle injuries were only analysed in rela-
tion to this programme. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis on
hip/groin injury in relation to this programme was also included.
Preplanned secondary analyses on the incidence rate ratio (IRR)
in the following subgroups: gender (male and female), and
mean age groups (youth (<19 years), seniors (19–30 years), old
girls/boys (31–39 years) and veterans (>39 years)) were not con-
ducted, as the included studies did not allow making meaningful
comparisons with only six studies, where studies with male
(n=3) and female participants (n=3) significantly differed in the
age group they targeted. The predefined secondary analysis of
compliance at team level was not performed as all team-level
data could not be obtained from the corresponding authors of
the included studies. Instead, the preplanned analysis of the
association between prevention programme compliance and
injury incidence was further supported by a post hoc analysis of
the association between prevention programme compliance and
the overall injury IRR from each study to accommodate for the

Eligibility criteria
W
e included only randomised or cluster-randomised controlled
trials comparing the FIFA injury prevention programmes with a
control (no or sham intervention) among football players. T
o be
included, studies were required to fulfil the following criteria:
(1) the full-text paper published in a peer-reviewed journal was
available; (2) the study contained original data from a rando-
mised controlled or a cluster-randomised trial; (3) the preventive
effect of FIFA 11 or the FIFA 11+ prevention programme was
evaluated; (4) only football players were included; and (5) foot-
ball injury was an outcome. For the assessment of harms
(adverse events), we also included all other original studies or
reports including practical execution of FIFA injury prevention
programmes in football.
Literature search and study selection
W
e systematically searched the following bibliographic data-
bases: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL
via Ebsco, W
eb of Science, SportDiscus and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled T
rials, from 2004 to 14 March 2016, as
the FIFA injury prevention programmes were initiated and
implemented from 2004 to 2005.9 13 A hand search of the ref-
erence lists of relevant articles was also conducted for other
potentially relevant references, and F-MARC was contacted to
verify if any important FIFA 11 or FIFA 11+ studies/publica-
tions did not appear from the search. No restriction on language
was included in the search. The following search strategy was
tested and found to be the most valid and efficient across data-
bases, and was applied in all the databases aforementioned: (fifa
OR f-marc OR fmarc OR prevention program* OR warm-up
program* OR warmup program* OR the11) AND (football OR
foot ball OR soccer). Possible relevant studies, identified by
titles and abstracts from the search, were downloaded into
Reference Manager V
.14 (Thomson Reuters, USA) and dupli-
cates were removed. T
wo authors (KT and KKK) independently
performed the selection of studies based on the title and abstract
provided by the bibliographic databases. This was followed by
full-text evaluation of the selected studies from the first selection
step. Disagreement between the two reviewers was solved by
discussion. If consensus was not achieved, a third reviewer
(EMB) was involved.
Data extraction
T
wo reviewers (EE and MBC) independently extracted data
using a specifically designed standardised data extracting form
(see study protocol), and afterwards the reviewers compared the
extracted data for consistency. All inconsistencies between the
two forms were resolved by discussion between the two data
extractors. Any disagreement between the data extractors after
the initial discussion related to inconsistencies between the two
individual data extractions was to be solved by involving a third
person (EMB). General study information, participants and
intervention characteristics, compliance, adverse events, with-
drawals and outcome measures were extracted. Where data were
not available from tables or the results section, the authors of
the study in question were contacted by email, with one
reminder after 2 weeks, if they did not respond to the first
email. Data obtained from authors not available from the arti-
cles can be seen in table 1, indicated by asterisks.
Primary outcome
Effect of FIFA injury prevention programmes on football
injury rates
The primary outcome was overall injury incidence defined as
the total number of injuries per 1000 hours of football expos-
ure. This included all injuries (overuse and traumatic) sustained
during the study period in training and match play.
Secondary outcomes
Effect of FIFA injury prevention programmes on football injury
rates
Secondary outcomes were lower limb injury incidence and
region-specific injury incidence for hamstring, hip/groin, knee
and ankle, all defined as the number of injuries per 1000 hours
of football exposure, respectively. This included all injuries
(overuse and traumatic) in each category sustained during the
study period in training and match play.
Compliance with the FIFA injury prevention programmes and its
association with football injury rates
In the present study, compliance with the intervention was
defined and estimated as the number of FIFA injury prevention
programme sessions performed at team level during the inter-
vention period divided by the length of the intervention period
in months. The mean compliance for each study included in the
primary analysis was estimated at team level from data available
from included trials. For the same trials, the compliance for
each individual team was estimated from similar data, at team
level, obtained directly from the authors of the original trials.
Accordingly, data at team level were obtained on: total number
of injuries; total exposure time (hours); number of FIFA injury
prevention programme sessions performed, and the duration of
the
FIFA
injury
prevention
programme
exercise
period
(months). The first author of this systematic review (KT) con-
tacted corresponding authors of cluster-randomised studies
included in the primary analysis concerning these compliance/
injury data, and asked them to provide this information in a pre-
specified data extraction form on compliance and injury rates at
team level (study protocol).
Harms resulting from the execution of the FIFA injury prevention
programmes
The number and type(s) of adverse effects resulting from the
actual execution of the FIFA injury prevention programmes
(experienced while performing the prevention exercises) were
obtained from all identifiable studies including practical execu-
tion of these programmes.
Synthesis of results
Effect of FIFA injury prevention programmes on football
injury rates
For the primary analysis on the effects of the FIFA injury pre-
vention programmes on overall injury rates, we calculated the
pooled overall injury incidence for intervention and groups sep-
arately using data on injuries and exposure from all included
cluster-randomised studies. If the data used to calculate the
injury incidence were not available in the published article, the
first author (KT) of the systematic review requested the missing
data from the author(s). All cluster-randomised trials were
adjusted for cluster effect in all pooled analyses. Since only one
included study11 reported cluster-adjusted estimates, we used
the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) from their trial on
all trials to adjust for a potential cluster effect by calculating the

 inflation factor (IF). The equation for cluster adjustment is IF=1
+(n−1)ρ, where ρ is the ICC, n the average cluster size and IF
the inflation factor.16 17 Effective sample size was then calcu-
lated by dividing the number of injuries and exposure hours by
IF, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Review of Interventions, V
.5.1 (part 3: 16.3.4).17
For the primary and secondary analyses including all rando-
mised studies using FIFA injury prevention programmes, the
overall injury IRR and 95% CIs were estimated as the relative
effect size. In the secondary analyses on body region-specific
injury rates, we only included studies using the FIFA 11+ pre-
vention programme, and IRR and 95% CIs were estimated as
the relative effect size using the extracted and pooled injury
data from the following body regions: lower limb, hamstring,
hip/groin, knee, and ankle, analysed in five separate analyses,
one for each body region.
Stata

(StataCorp

was
used
to
perform
the
meta-analysis and calculate the pooled estimates. A forest plot
is presented to allow for visual comparisons between studies.
The level of statistical heterogeneity for pooled data was estab-
lished using the χ2 and I2 statistics. The χ2 and I2 statistics
describe heterogeneity or homogeneity of the comparisons
with p<0.05 indicating a significant heterogeneity.18 The
Mantel-Haenszel19 20 random-effects method was selected for
all analyses.
Compliance with the FIFA injury prevention programmes and its
relation to football injury rates
T
o assess the association between prevention programme com-
pliance and effect on injury incidence, we performed two
random-effects
meta-regression
analyses
using
Stata.
One
meta-regression was performed using the injury incidence in the
intervention group as the outcome and the average team compli-
ance in each study as the explanatory variable. The post hoc
meta-regression was performed to investigate the association
between IRR from each study as the outcome and the average
team compliance from each study as the explanatory variable.
Harms resulting from the execution of the FIFA injury prevention
programmes
Adverse effect/harms of applying an FIFA injury prevention pro-
gramme was given as number and type(s) of adverse effects
resulting from the actual execution of the FIFA injury preven-
tion programmes (experienced while performing the prevention
exercises) relative to the total number of players performing the
FIFA injury prevention programmes in the included studies.

 Risk of bias assessment
The included cluster-randomised studies were assessed for risk
of bias by two independent raters (EE and MBC) using the
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in rando-
mised controlled trials.17 Each trial was evaluated across seven
domains of bias, including one or more items that were
appraised in two parts. First, the relevant trials’ characteristics
related to the item were summarised. Second, each bias domain
was judged as high or low risk of bias according to its possible
effect on the results of the trial. When the possible effect was
unknown or insufficient detail was reported, the item was
judged as unclear. All the above concerning risk of bias followed
the
description
outlined
in
the
Cochrane
Handbook
for
Systematic Review of Interventions, V
.5.1 (part 2: 8.5.1).17
Since only cluster-randomised trials were included, particular
types of bias were assessed in the ‘other bias’ domain for all
studies, according to how to assess risk of bias in cluster-
randomised
trials
following
the
recommendations
in
the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions,
V
.5.1 (part 3: 16.3.2).17 Any disagreements between ratings
were resolved by discussion between the raters. Consultation
with a third party (EMB) was to be used if disagreements still
persisted after this discussion. An assessment of the methodo-
logical quality was not performed, because no evidence for such
appraisals and judgements exists as to why such an assessment
could be potentially misleading.17
High risk of bias is to be expected from the domains con-
cerning blinding of participants and researchers (performance
bias), and blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias). In
prevention studies using active exercise programmes such as
the FIFA injury prevention programmes, it is very difficult to
blind the participants to the intervention. Furthermore, it is
impossible to blind the outcome assessment as the reporting of
injuries is self-reported by definition. Risk of bias assessment
was therefore followed as recommended in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, V
.5.1 (part
2: 8.5.1 and part 3: 16.3.2),17 but not considered for sensitiv-
ity analyses in the final evaluation of the primary or the sec-
ondary
outcomes.
Intertester

RESULTS
The literature search yielded 2400 studies after removal of dupli-
cates. Out of these, 51 were considered for inclusion after review
of title and abstract. Following a full-text review, 19 reports were
excluded due to 11 not qualifying as full-text articles, and 8
because they did not include football players performing the
FIFA injury prevention programmes. This left 32 studies investi-
gating the FIFA injury prevention programmes, including poten-
tial harms.9

 prevention programmes, and 180 teams (3645 players) to the
control group (no programme).
Study characteristics
The mean age of players in the individual trials ranged from 15
to 45 years. The follow-up time for the trials included periods
of 5–9 months (table 1).
Synthesis of results
By pooling data of 6574 individuals playing football at the rec-
reational/subelite level, 510.055 exposure hours and 2454
overall injuries were collected from the six included randomised
controlled trials. The pooled total injury incidence was 3.99
injuries per 1000 hours of exposure for the intervention group
and 5.57 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure for the control
group.
In the primary analysis, and for the primary outcome (overall
injury rate), the pooled results showed a 25% overall injury
reduction per 1000 hours of exposure in the FIFA injury pre-
vention programmes (FIFA 11 and FIFA 11+) group compared
with the control group (IRR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98,
p=0.036; figure 3). There was significant heterogeneity in this
analysis (I2=68.9%, p=0.007).
In the secondary analyses (type of programme), for the
primary outcome (overall injury rate) the pooled results showed
injury reduction per 1000 hours of exposure in the FIFA 11+
programme group compared with the control group (IRR 0.61;
95% CI 0.48 to 0.77, p<0.001, I2=25.5%, p=0.259), but no
significant reduction in the FIFA 11 programme group (IRR
0.99; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23, p=0.940, I2=0.0%, p=0.982)
compared with the control group (figure 4).
In the secondary analyses (body region) for the secondary
outcome (region-specific injury rates) associated with the FIFA
11+ programme, an overall injury reduction existed in favour
of the FIFA 11+ programme for lower limb injuries (IRR 0.63;
95% CI 0.48 to 0.81, p<0.001, I2=28.1%, p=0.243). More
specifically, an overall injury reduction existed in favour of the
FIFA 11+ programme for the following body region-specific
outcomes: hamstring injuries (IRR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84,
p=0.016, I2=0.0%, p=0.627), hip/groin injuries (IRR 0.59;
95% CI 0.35 to 0.97, p=0.037, I2=0.0%%, p=0.350), knee
injuries (IRR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72, p<0.001, I2=0.0%,
p=0.573) and ankle injuries (IRR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.97,
p=0.035, I2=27.1%, p=0.254; figure 5).
Compliance
Four of the six studies included information in the methods
section concerning the FIFA 11 injury prevention programmes
(FIFA 11+ and FIFA 11) which specified that the programme
should be performed at least twice a week.11 12 40 43 This is in
accordance with the recommendation from F-MARC on the
execution of FIFA injury prevention programmes (http://www.
f-marc.com/11plus/11plus/).
Study characteristics
For the six cluster-randomised studies, the average number of
FIFA injury prevention programme sessions per week performed
by included intervention teams was 1.2 (SD±0.7) sessions/week.

studies,11 12 21 33 43 out of 168 intervention teams from all six
included studies in total,11 12 21 33 40 43 the number of FIFA
injury prevention programmes sessions conducted on average
per week at team level was obtained: 15% of teams did less
than half a session per week, 53% did less than one session per
week, 72% did less than one and a half sessions per week, and
87% did less than two sessions per week, meaning that 13% of
all intervention clubs reached the suggested minimum of at least
two sessions per week.
Synthesis of results
There was no significant association between average compli-
ance in the individual studies and the overall injury incidence
estimate from the intervention group in each study (adjusted
R2=−18.8%, p=0.670). The post hoc meta-regression showed
no significant association between compliance and IRR from
each study (adjusted R2=72.4%, p=0.107). However, the direc-
tion of this non-significant association did point towards a
higher preventative effect among the studies with higher
compliance.

The
two
reviewers resolved all disagreements and no third reviewer
involvement was needed for achieving consensus. Judgements
on the domain ‘other bias’ were discussed among the reviewers
for all six studies. All studies were assessed as having a high risk
of bias in at least three domains (see online supplementary table
S2). In all studies, neither intervention providers nor interven-
tion receivers (performance bias), or outcome assessment in the
form of self-reported injury (detection bias), could be consid-

Study characteristics
Out of all 32 studies9 11 12 21–49 including information on prac-
tical execution of the FIFA injury prevention programmes, only
one cluster-randomised trial11 commented on possible harms
(adverse events).
Synthesis of results
In relation to the total number of players performing the FIFA
injury prevention programmes (n=4594), only one report of a

DISCUSSION
In this systematic review and meta-analysis where the primary
outcome was the overall injury incidence, we found a statistic-
ally significant reduction in football injuries in recreational/sube-
lite football players in favour of the FIFA injury prevention
programmes compared with controls (no programme). The
secondary analyses revealed that significant effects were found
when pooling data from studies applying the FIFA 11+ preven-
tion programme, whereas no significant effects were found
when pooling data from studies applying the FIFA 11 preven-
tion programme.
Level 1 evidence on the effect of FIFA injury prevention
programmes
One previous systematic review including a meta-analysis by Al
Attar et al14 was published in 2015. The study investigated the
benefits of FIFA injury prevention programmes in footballers.
While this study reported very similar overall injury reduction
estimates to those of this study, the analyses and conclusions in
the study by Al Attar et al14 were based on studies different
from those included in the current review and meta-analysis.
They included both randomised and observational studies in
their meta-analysis,14 and thus did not separate meta-analyses
on cluster-randomised/randomised controlled studies from ana-
lyses made on observational studies, as recommended in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions.17
Furthermore, cluster-adjusted estimates were not calculated by
Al Attar et al,14 which means that the effective sample size was
never taken into account.16 These are central points when per-
forming systematic reviews including meta-analyses, which we
have previously addressed in a letter to the editor,50 since we
were concerned about the confidence one could have in the
robustness of the estimates considering the statistical approach
applied by Al Attar et al.14 To the best of our knowledge, this
study is therefore the first systematic review and meta-analysis to
exclusively provide level 1 evidence from cluster-randomised
studies in a pooled meta-analysis and, furthermore, to account
for possible cluster effects to the same extent shown by Soligard
et al11 to be present among the teams in their large prevention
study.

 The FIFA 11 prevention programme versus the FIFA 11+
prevention programme
Our study documents that cluster-randomised studies of FIFA
injury prevention programmes, when pooled together, show a
substantial injury reduction in recreational/subelite football. This
effect seems to be primarily driven by the large effect of the
FIFA 11+ prevention programme, as the initially introduced
FIFA 11 prevention programme alone does not seem to induce
any injury-reducing effect. The heterogeneity analyses also
support this notion, as significant heterogeneity between FIFA
injury prevention programme studies only exists when pooling
studies including FIFA 11 and FIFA 11+ together, and disap-
pears when pooling FIFA 11 and FIFA 11+ prevention pro-
gramme studies separately. This suggests that effect sizes from
the studies including these two different programmes are
diverse. This diversity cannot be investigated or explained by
differences in the methodology used in these studies, as all
studies have similar issues concerning risk of bias.
What modulates the injury-preventing effect of the FIFA
11+ programme: compliance or conditioning?
The finding of no injury-preventing effect from the FIFA 11
prevention programme in the large study by Steffen et al12 was
initially suggested to be due to the low compliance. This was,
however,
somehow
contradicted
by
the
findings
of
van
Beijsterveldt et al,21 which also did not show any injury-
preventing effect of the FIFA 11 prevention programme, despite
having a much higher team compliance than the study of
Steffen et al.12 The findings of this study did not reveal any stat-
istically significant association between compliance (the number
of sessions performed per week at team level) and overall injury
incidence, or overall injury IRR, although the post hoc analysis
(using IRR) did point towards the possibility of a higher pre-
ventative effect among the studies with the highest team compli-
ance. T
wo studies on the FIFA 11+ programme have indicated,
within the same study context (female adolescent footballers)
and injury definition, that there is an association between

 individual player compliance (number of sessions performed)
and an overall injury- preventing effect.44 47 The indications
from these studies suggest that FIFA 11+ is the most efficacious
in individuals with higher compliance rates.44 47 Importantly, all
studies11 12 21 33 40 43 included in the present systematic review
and meta-analysis showed poor overall team compliance in
terms of achieving the minimally suggested prevention pro-
gramme dosage of at least two weekly team sessions. Only 13%
of all teams from the included studies reached this benchmark.
Getting at least two team sessions a week may therefore still be
important to achieve the optimal effect, which is further sup-
ported by the fact that physiological and performance improve-
ments documented from the FIFA 11+ programme were
obtained from studies where football players were performing
the prevention programmes 2–3 times a week for 8–12
weeks.23 25–30 34 Several FIFA 11+ programme studies have
shown improvements in quadriceps and hamstring muscle
strength, as well as in balance, agility and running speed, after
only 8–12 weeks execution of the FIFA 11+ prevention pro-
gramme compared with a control group with no warm-up pro-
gramme.23 25–30 34 In contrast, the much less strenuous FIFA 11
prevention programme seems to induce no or only minimal
physiological adaptations in quadriceps and hamstring strength,
as well as in balance, agility or running speed.12
45 In this
context, we speculate that the large difference in prescribed
exercise intensity between the FIFA 11 and the FIFA 11+ pre-
vention programmes could also provide a possible explanation
for the discrepancy in injury-preventing effects between the two
programmes.
Accordingly,
despite
similar
exercises
being
included in both programmes, the FIFA 11+ includes much
higher loads/skill levels, longer active muscle contractions (time
under muscle tension) and/or more repetitions for these type of
exercises (figure 1). By introducing three exercise progression
levels in the FIFA 11+ for each exercise, the number of repeti-
tions and the time under tension for the strength training exer-
cises alone are increased 2–3 times when a player exercises at
levels 2 and 3.11 12
Harms related to the execution of FIFA injury prevention
programmes
W
e also searched the literature for information on harms
(adverse events) associated with the execution of the FIFA
injury prevention programmes, and we included all studies pub-
lished from 2004 onwards. W
e only found one report of injury
on 4594 players performing the FIFA injury programmes.
Based on the lack of preplanned and standardised registration
of adverse events related to the FIFA injury prevention pro-
grammes, it is questionable how meaningful this result is.
Future FIFA injury prevention programme studies need to
ensure a more stringent and transparent reporting of adverse
events related to the prevention programme, as it cannot be
assumed that this is negligible based on reports from existing
studies.
The FIFA 11+ prevention programme works in controlled
studies—now it is time for adoption and implementation!
An injury-preventing effect of 25% was present when conduct-
ing the FIFA injury prevention programmes compared with fol-
lowing the usual training and match routines in recreational/
subelite football, but no clinically meaningful conclusion can be
drawn from this result due to the apparent diversity in effect
sizes between studies looking at FIFA 11 and FIFA 11+ preven-
tion programmes. More specifically, the FIFA 11+ prevention
programme was shown to have a substantial injury-preventing
effect by reducing football injuries by 39%, whereas a prevent-
ive effect from the FIFA 11 prevention programme alone could
not be documented. Reducing injuries to this extent by using an
exercise-based prevention programme has, furthermore, been
shown to reduce injury-related costs in football by more than
40%.36 51
At this point in time, very little information on the actual
adoption and implementation of the FIFA injury prevention
programmes exists. Data from a few preliminary studies suggest
that it may not be realistic to transfer the results from this study
to elite football where application, relevance, dosage and inten-
sity need to be specifically defined and adapted to the elite
environment.52–56 More research and information on how to
optimise adoption and implementation of FIFA 11+ at all levels
should therefore be given high priority in the future, as positive
effects from this prevention programme are now well documen-
ted. Providing substantial level 1 evidence-based information for
the programme’s preventive effects and for the injury-related
cost that can be saved from using the programme is among the
first important steps towards worldwide adoption and imple-
mentation. Furthermore, the information needs to reach health
and football policymakers in order to highlight and encourage
the importance of adopting and implementing the FIFA 11+
prevention programme at all recreational levels of football, as
football is globally the most popular sport, and is an excellent
form of physical activity. Football is, as such, already documen-
ted to be one of the most potent physical activities to induce
important health benefits such as cardiovascular and metabolic
health across ages and genders;3 thus, reducing football injuries
associated with this form of activity is crucial.
Methodological limitations and considerations
A limitation of this study is that the included studies in the
meta-analyses use different injury definitions. While four out of
the six included studies only report ‘time-loss’ injuries, the
remaining two studies report all injuries. Although such a dis-
crepancy in injury definitions can provide different injury inci-
dences between studies, it should not affect the IRR within
randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, we did not assess
statistically for publication bias (tests for funnel plot asymmetry)
due to the low number of included studies in our meta-analyses.
This is, however, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Review of Interventions, V
.5.1 (part 2: 10.4.3),
where tests for funnel plot asymmetry are only recommended
when
there
are
at
least
10
studies
included
in
the
meta-analysis.17
Despite not reaching the recommended dose, this study
clearly shows that application of the FIFA 11+ reduces injuries
dramatically in recreational and subelite football, which relates
to the majority of players worldwide. However, more studies on
exercise intensity, dose–response relationship, as well as adop-
tion, implementation and compliance with the FIFA 11+ pro-
gramme are called for to improve understanding of what the
most important parameters are when we aim to adopt and
implement the FIFA 11+ programme at the different levels of
football.
In conclusion, an injury-preventing effect of the FIFA injury
prevention programmes compared with usual care (no injury
prevention programme) was shown in football. This effect was
induced by the FIFA 11+ prevention programme which has a
substantial injury-preventing effect by reducing football injuries
to a clinically relevant 39%. In contrast to this, a preventive
effect of the FIFA 11 prevention programme could not be
documented.

 What are the findings?
▸ The FIFA 11+ prevention programme has a substantial
injury-preventing effect by reducing football injuries in
recreational/subelite football by 39%, whereas a preventive
effect from the FIFA 11 prevention programme alone could
not be documented.
▸ The FIFA 11+ prevention programme reduces the top four
most prevalent football injuries: hamstring, hip/groin, knee
and ankle injury by 60%, 41%, 48% and 32%, respectively.
▸ Less than 15% of intervention teams from randomised
controlled trials investigating the effect of FIFA injury
prevention programmes reached the recommended dose of
two sessions per week during the season. This suggests that
there is room for improvement when it comes to optimal
adoption and implementation of FIFA injury prevention
programmes.
▸ Preplanned and standardised registration of adverse events
related to the execution of FIFA injury prevention
programmes are generally lacking. Possible adverse effects
of the programmes have therefore not been sufficiently
investigated at present.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Since football induces important health benefits across
gender and lifespan by improving cardiovascular and
metabolic health, and preventing risk factors for lifestyle
diseases, the prevention of injuries through implementing
the FIFA 11+ prevention programme in recreational/subelite
football is important to optimise the number of players who
will achieve important health benefits from playing football.
▸ Through the provision of level 1 evidence-based information
from the current study, worldwide adoption and
implementation of the FIFA 11+ prevention programme
should be further encouraged among all relevant parties—
from health and football policymakers, stakeholders and
associations to clubs, coaches and players at all recreational/
subelite levels of football.
▸ To support future adaptation and implementation of the
FIFA 11+ programme, there is a need to focus on dose–
response relationships, compliance and potential adverse
events in relation to the usage of the FIFA 11+ at different
levels of football.
