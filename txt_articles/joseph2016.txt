IMPORTANCE Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a relative contraindication for facial plastic
surgery, but formal screening is not common in practice. The prevalence of BDD in patients
seeking facial plastic surgery is not well documented.
OBJECTIVE To establish the prevalence of BDD across facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery
practice settings, and estimate the ability of surgeons to screen for BDD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter prospective study recruited a cohort of
597 patients who presented to academic and private facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery
practices from March 2015 to February 2016.
METHODS All patients were screened for BDD using the Body Dysmorphic Disorder
Questionnaire (BDDQ). After each clinical encounter, surgeons independently evaluated the
likelihood that a participating patient had BDD. Validated instruments were used to assess
satisfaction with facial appearance including the FACE-Q, Blepharoplasty Outcomes
Evaluation (BOE), Facelift Outcomes Evaluation (FOE), Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation
(ROE), and Skin Rejuvenation Outcomes Evaluation (SROE).
RESULTS Across participating practices (9 surgeons, 3 sites), a total of 597 patients were
screened for BDD: 342 patients from site 1 (mean [SD] age, 44.2 [16.5] years; 158 patients,
site 2 (mean [SD] age, 46.0 [16.2] years), site 3, 97 patients (mean [SD] age, 56.3 [15.5]
years). Overall, 58 patients [9.7%] screened positive for BDD by the BDDQ instrument, while
only 16 of 402 patients [4.0%] were clinically suspected of BDD by surgeons. A higher
percentage of patients presenting for cosmetic surgery (37 of 283 patients [13.1%]) compared
with those presenting for reconstructive surgery (21 of 314 patients [6.7%])screened positive
on the BDDQ (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.20-3.68; P = .01). Surgeons were only able to
correctly identify 2 of 43 patients (4.7%) who screened positive for BDD on the BDDQ, and
the positive likelihood ratio was only 1.19 (95% CI, 0.28-5.07). Patients screening positive for
BDD by the BDDQ had lower satisfaction with their appearance as measured by the FACE-Q,
ROE, BOE, SROE, and FOE.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Body dysmorphic disorder is a relatively common condition
across facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery practice settings. Patients who screen positive
on the BDDQ have lower satisfaction with their facial appearance at baseline. Surgeons have a
poor ability to screen for patients with BDD when compared with validated screening
instruments such as the BDDQ. Routine implementation of validated BDD screening
instruments may improve patient care.

B
ody dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric condi-
tion that is classified as an obsessive compulsive–
related disorder.1 Patients with BDD have an obses-
sive preoccupation with perceived defects of their appearance
that are minuscule or nonexistent and commonly involve the
nose, eyes, skin, or hair.2,3 Patients with BDD often suffer from
significant emotional distress and functional impairment.1
Mood, anxiety, and personality disorders are common psychi-
atric comorbidities in these patients.
Patients with BDD exhibit compulsive or repetitive behav-
iors that aim to improve or hide their perceived defects. In-
deed,upto76%ofpatientswithBDDseekconsultationforcos-
metic procedures, and up to 60% of patients with BDD actually
undergo unnecessary surgical procedures for their perceived
defects.2,4,5 A vast majority (84%) of cosmetic plastic sur-
geons report having operated on patients whom they be-
lieved had BDD, with 82% of these patients having a negative
outcome.6,7 Numerous studies have shown that patients tend
to have poor satisfaction following surgery and show a higher
rate of aggression and litigation toward surgeons.4,5,8 There-
fore, it is important to accurately identify patients with BDD
in plastic surgery practices, because the proper treatment for
these patients is psychiatric care and occasionally surgery with
psychiatric care and/or intensive psychological support.9,10
The prevalence of BDD is approximately 2.4% in the gen-
eral population.1 The reported prevalence of BDD in patients
presenting for facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery varies sig-
nificantly, likely owing to varying patient populations and in-
consistent screening methods.11-18 Furthermore, because for-
mal and routine screening for BDD is uncommon in these
practices, there is often an underdetection of BDD.2,3,6,18 More
recent studies suggest that the prevalence of BDD is up to 13%
in the facial plastic surgery setting and 6.9% in the oculoplas-
tic surgery practice.19,20
TheBodyDysmorphicDisorderQuestionnaire(BDDQ)was
developed in the psychiatric setting for BDD screening. Re-
cently, the BDDQ was validated in the facial plastic surgery pa-
tient population and was found to have a sensitivity of 100%
and specificity of 90.3%.20 Despite the existence of this vali-
dated screening instrument for BDD, many surgeons con-
tinue to rely primarily on their intuition and intangible infor-
mation gathered from the clinical encounter to determine if a
patient has BDD. Whether surgeons’suspicion of BDD based
on clinical intuition correlates well with the validated BDDQ
has not been investigated. In the study, we aim to establish the
prevalence of BDD across multiple cosmetic and reconstruc-
tive facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery practices. Further-
more, we sought to prospectively determine surgeons’accu-
racy in screening for BDD compared with the validated BDDQ.
Methods
Participants
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Uni-
versity of Michigan Medical School. Informed consent or a
waiver of informed consent for study participation was ob-
tained for each study site. A total of 3 clinical sites partici-
pated in this study. Study site 1 represents an academic facial
plastic and reconstructive surgery practice; site 2, a private fa-
cial plastic and reconstructive surgery practice; and site 3, an
academic oculoplastic surgery practice. Across the 3 partici-
pating sites, a total of 597 patients that presented between
March of 2015 and February of 2016 participated in this study.
Data Collection
Allpatients18yearsorolderpresentingtotheparticipatingsites
for a new patient consultation were invited to complete the
screening questionnaires during the registration process. Pa-
tients who agreed to participate were provided a portable elec-
tronic tablet which displayed the clinical instruments in an in-
teractive manner. Regardless of the study site, the survey
questions were presented in an identical order and had the
same on-screen formatting. In addition to questions involv-
ing the primary screening instruments, patients were asked a
series of background demographic questions including age,
ethnicity, sex, marital status, education level, and primary cat-
egory of consultation (reconstructive vs cosmetic).
Clinical Instruments

Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder
(BDD) and ability of facial plastic and oculoplastic surgeons to
clinically diagnose this condition?
Findings In this multicenter prospective study, 597 patients were
screened for BDD. Approximately 10% of patients screened by a
validated screening instrument were positive for BDD, but
surgeons were only able to correctly identify approximately 5% of
those patients screening positive.
Meaning Body dysmorphic disorder is a common condition within
facial plastic surgery practices, but surgeons have a low accuracy in
identifying these patients when compared with validated
screening instruments. Routine use of validated BDD screening
tools may improve patient care.

short series of questions to determine whether they believed
each patient met diagnostic criteria for BDD and their cer-
tainty in the diagnosis (Figure 1). Surgeons were blinded to the
results of the BDDQ instrument throughout the study.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to assess baseline demo-
graphicvariables.Forcategoricalvariables,theFischerexacttest
or χ2 test was used to test for differences across study sites.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods were used to compare
continuous demographic variables (age) across study sites.
Simple logistic regression was used to assess for differences in
baseline patient-rated satisfaction scores based on BDDQ sta-
tus. Surgeon diagnostic accuracy was compared with the vali-
datedBDDQscreeninginstrument.Sensitivity,specificity,posi-

were assumed to be missing at random and a sensitivity analy-
sis of our results to missing data was performed using multiple

tests were 2-sided and P values less than .05 were considered
statistically significant. Besides what was otherwise noted, all
remaining statistical analyses were performed using Stata Data
Analysis and Statistical Software, version 14.0 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Study Population
A total of 597 patients completed the surveys and were in-
cluded in the study population. Baseline demographic vari-
ables are shown in Table 1. Patients presenting to each study
site had similar age. Across study sites, there was a difference
in the distribution of gender (χ2 [2, N = 595] = 17.36; P < .001),
education(χ2[10,N = 595] = 21.13;P = .049),self-reportedrace
(χ2 [10, N = 595] = 25.81; P = .004), and marital status (χ2 [4,
N = 594] = 34.08;P < .001).Furthermore,theproportionofpa-
tients presenting primarily for cosmetic concerns differed
across sites (χ2 [2, N = 597] = 58.21; P < .001).
BDDQ Screening
A total of 58 patients (9.7%) across study sites screened posi-
tive for BDD based on the BDDQ instrument. The proportion
of patients screening positive at each study site is shown in

of patients screening positive across the 3 study sites (χ2 [2,
N = 597] = 1.11; P = .57). Patients presenting primarily for cos-
metic purposes (37 of 283 patients [13.1%]) were more likely
than those presenting for reconstructive reasons (21 of 314 pa-
tients [6.7%]) to screen positive on the BDDQ odds ratio [OR],
2.10; 95% CI, 1.20-3.68; P = .01).
Surgeon Diagnostic Accuracy
The diagnostic accuracy of surgeons in performing clinical
screening for BDD was compared with that of the validated
BDDQ screening instrument. A total of 402 patients com-
pleted the baseline screening surveys and were also screened
by a surgeon. Independent of BDDQ status, a total of 16 pa-
tients(4.0%)weresuspectedbysurgeonsashavingBDD.While
43outofthe402patients(10.7%;95%CI,7.8%-14.1%)screened
positive on the BDDQ instrument, only 2 of these patients
(4.7%) were correctly identified by surgeons as having BDD.
The sensitivity of surgeon diagnosis of BDD when compared
with the BDDQ was 4.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-15.8%) with a speci-
ficity of 96.1% (95% CI, 93.5%-97.9%). The positive predic-
tive value was found to be 12.5% (95% CI, 1.6%-38.3%) and
negative predictive value was 89.4% (95% CI, 85.9%-92.3%).
The positive and negative likelihood ratios for surgeon diag-
nosis were 1.19 (95% CI, 0.3-5.1) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.9-1.1), re-
spectively, and both 95% CIs contain one suggesting that little
additional information is gained for discriminating BDD sta-
tus of a patient based on clinical diagnosis of a surgeon. The
ROC area was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.47-0.54). Plots of pretest and

Discussion
Patients with BDD frequently seek plastic surgery to address
their perceived defects in appearance. Yet, data suggest that
these patients most commonly have poor satisfaction and may
not benefit from surgery.2 Therefore, it is of critical impor-
tance that surgeons accurately identify patients with BDD who
presentseekingsurgeryandmanagethemappropriately.Many
plastic surgeons do not formally screen for BDD. This may be
owing to surgeons’underestimation of the prevalence of BDD
in their practice setting or a lack of familiarity with validated
screening tools. Indeed, when members of the American So-
ciety of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery were surveyed, a majority of
respondents believed that the prevalence of BDD was only 2%
in their practice.6 In this prospective multicenter study, we
aimed to determine the prevalence of patients screening posi-
tive for BDD across multiple facial plastic and oculoplastic sur-
gery settings in a standardized fashion. This is also the first
study to determine the accuracy of surgeons at identifying pa-
tients with BDD.
TheoverallprevalenceofpatientsscreeningpositiveforBDD
byBDDQinourstudypopulationwas9.7%.Theprevalencewas
higherinpatientswithprimarilycosmeticconcerns(13.1%)than
those presenting for noncosmetic reconstruction (6.7%). The
gold standard for diagnosing patients with BDD is the struc-
tured clinical interview for diagnosis (SCID), which is time-
consumingandchallengingtoimplementinabusycosmeticsur-
gery practice.23 However, the BDDQ is a validated screening
instrument in the facial plastic surgery setting with a very high
sensitivity and specificity.20 Of patients who screen positive on
the BDDQ, approximately two-thirds of cosmetic patients and
onehalfofreconstructivepatientsareexpectedtohaveBDDby
SCID.20 Thus, the BDD prevalence in our study population can
be estimated to be 9.9% in the cosmetic population and 3.4%
in the reconstructive population. These findings are consis-
tent with those that were recently reported elsewhere.17,18,20
There was no significant difference in the proportion of pa-
tients screening positive on BDDQ across the various practice
settings (academic vs private practice, facial plastic vs oculo-
plastic surgery). The BDDQ-positive patients were also shown
to have significantly lower baseline satisfaction on all out-
come measures tested (FACE-Q, ROE, BOE, FOE, SROE).
Surgeons commonly determine whether or not a patient
has BDD based on interaction with the patient and clinical in-
tuition. Interestingly, our results show that surgeons are poor
at screening for BDD when compared with the standardized
BDDQ, with the former having sensitivity of only 4.7% and a
positivelikelihoodratio(1.2;95%CI,0.3-5.1)thatindicatesthat
littleadditionalusefulinformationisgainedbysurgeonscreen-
ing—that is, out of 100 patients with BDD, surgeons could iden-
tify less than 5 of them. This point is most clearly illustrated
by the positive and negative posttest vs pretest probability
curves that show that the chance a patient would screen posi-
tive or negative does not change appreciably based on the sur-
geon’
s opinion. Nevertheless, surgeons were extremely con-
fident of their ability to identify patients with BDD, with an
average 89% certainty of the accuracy of their judgement. Not
surprisingly, in the same American Society of Aesthetic Plas-
tic Surgery survey discussed above, 84% of plastic surgeons
said they had unknowingly performed surgeries on patients
with BDD.6 Taken together, these findings point to the need
for a validated, standardized, objective method to screen for
BDD in the plastic surgery practice.
While the performance metrics are specific to the study,
this study had a broad geographic pool and sampled both aca-
demic and private practices. In addition, the likelihood ratios
and the corresponding posttest vs pretest probability curves
can be used to estimate surgeon’
s performance based on lo-
cal prevalence, which should be globally poor.
The BDDQ is a self-administered, brief (1-2 minutes), vali-
dated screening instrument that patients can easily complete
as they wait for the surgeon. It was successfully used in high
volume facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery practices in our
study, without impeding clinic flow. Patients screening posi-
tive on the BDDQ should alert surgeons to the possibility that
a patient may have BDD, and prompt surgeons to ask addi-
tional questions as part of the clinical interview. Surgeons
should pay special attention to BDDQ-positive patients to de-
termine if there is a true indication for surgery since most pa-
tients with BDD have been shown to not benefit from cos-
metic surgery and have poor satisfaction after surgery.8
To our knowledge this is the largest prospective study un-
dertaken to estimate the prevalence of patients screening posi-
tive for BDD in the facial plastic and oculoplastic surgery set-
ting. Our inclusion of a variety of practice settings (private and
academic; cosmetic and reconstructive), and geographic lo-
cations, lends to the generalizability of our findings.
Limitations
One limitation of our study is that not every patient that was
screened by the BDDQ was also screened for BDD by their sur-
geon (402 of 597 patients [67.3%] were screened by their sur-
geon and with the BDDQ). It is possible that this may have in-
troduced bias to the analysis of surgeons’ accuracy in
identification of patients with BDD. Nonetheless, the ex-
tremely poor ability of surgeons to clinically identify patients
with BDDQ underscores the value of routine screening for BDD
with validated screening instruments in facial plastic and ocu-
loplastic surgery practices.
