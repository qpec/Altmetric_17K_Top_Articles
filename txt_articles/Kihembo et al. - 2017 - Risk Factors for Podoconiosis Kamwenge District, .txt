Abstract.
Podoconiosis, a noninfectious elephantiasis, is a disabling neglected tropical disease. In August 2015, an
elephantiasis case-cluster was reported in Kamwenge District, western Uganda. We investigated to identify the
disease’s nature and risk factors. We defined a suspected podoconiosis case as onset in a Kamwenge resident of
bilateral asymmetrical lower limb swelling lasting ≥ 1 month, plus ≥ 1 of the following associated symptoms: skin
itching, burning sensation, plantar edema, lymph ooze, prominent skin markings, rigid toes, or mossy papillomata. A
probable case was a suspected case with negative microfilaria antigen immunochromatographic card test (ruling out
filarial elephantiasis). We conducted active case-finding. In a case–control investigation, we tested the hypothesis that
the disease was caused by prolonged foot skin exposure to irritant soils, using 40 probable case-persons and 80
asymptomatic village control-persons, individually matched by age and sex. We collected soil samples to characterize
irritants. We identified 52 suspected (including 40 probable) cases with onset from 1980 to 2015. Prevalence rates
increased with age; annual incidence (by reported onset of disease) was stable over time at 2.9/100,000. We found that
93% (37/40) of cases and 68% (54/80) of controls never wore shoes at work (Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio [ORMH] =
7.7; 95% [confidence interval] CI = 2.0–30); 80% (32/40) of cases and 49% (39/80) of controls never wore shoes at
home (ORMH = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.8–15); and 70% (27/39) of cases and 44% (35/79) of controls washed feet at day end
(versus immediately after work) (OR = 11; 95% CI = 2.1–56). Soil samples were characterized as rich black-red volcanic
clays. In conclusion, this reported elephantiasis is podoconiosis associated with prolonged foot exposure to volcanic
soil. We recommended foot hygiene and universal use of protective shoes.
INTRODUCTION
Podoconiosis is a neglected tropical nonfilarial elephantiasis
characterized by progressive bilateral asymmetrical lymph-
edema of the lower limbs.1,2 The disease is theorized to be
caused by an abnormal inflammatory reaction to persistent
contact with irritant volcanic soils derived from volcanic
rocks. However, the exact pathogenesis is poorly under-
stood.3 During foot contact with volcanic soils, irritant
mineral particles penetrate the skin of the foot into lymphatic
vessels where they are taken up by macrophages and induce
inflammation with subsequent fibrosis. Recurrent exposure
to irritant soils leads to repeated cycles of inflammation and
fibrosis. This causes scarring and blockade of the lymphatic
vessels resulting into lymphedema.3
In August 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO)
Uganda Country Office received a report from a non-
government organization of a perceived increase in the
number of elephantiasis cases in Kamwenge District, which
had caused tremendous suffering. Records showed that in
2014 a similar report was filed, which prompted the Vector
Control Division, Ministry of Health of Uganda, to conduct
screening for elephantiasis cases between March and April
2015 in the district. The screening ruled out lymphatic filariasis
as a cause of the elephantiasis and pointed to podoconiosis.
Between September 20 and 29, 2015, we conducted a formal
epidemiologic investigation to confirm the diagnosis, identify
risk factors for the disease, and provide evidence to guide
prevention and control efforts.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study setting. Kamwenge District is located in western
Uganda and is composed of 16 subcounties. The district’s
average altitude is 1,280 m above sea level and receives a
well-distributed bimodal rainfall, average 1,200 mm annually.4
Agriculture is the main economic activity with > 90% of the
population engaged in nonsubsistence maize crop farming.
Twenty-four percentage of the district population fall with in
the lowest two of the five quintiles on the wealth index.5 Our
investigation was conducted in Busiriba and Kamwenge
subcounties located in the northern part of the district. These
subcounties were selected because they had the highest
reported cases of elephantiasis. Generally in Uganda, more
male-headed households (70%) own atleast one pair of
shoes compared with 67% in female-headed households.6
Study procedures. We defined a suspected podoconiosis
case as onset in a Kamwenge District resident of bilat-
eral, asymmetrical, hard swelling of lower limbs (nonpitting
edema) lasting for ≥ 1 month, with history of any of the
following associated symptoms from 1980 onward: lower
limb skin itching, burning sensations, plantar edema, lymph
ooze, prominent skin markings, hyperkeratosis (skin harden-
ing) rigid toes, formation of mossy papillomata, or skin
nodules on the lower limbs. A probable case was a suspect
case with a negative microfilaria antigen on the immuno-
chromatographic card test (ICT).7–9 A negative ICT result
(described below under the laboratory investigation sec-
tion) rules out filarial elephantiasis, thereby establishing the
diagnosis of podoconiosis.10 Suspected case-patients were
thoroughly examined clinically to rule out ailments such as
leprosy and other skin disorders. Members of the district
health team indicated that since no specific treatment of the
disease is offered at the health facilities and health workers
hardly understood the disease, case-persons were not

 seeking care at the district’s health facilities. We therefore
conducted active case-finding in affected communities using
a standard questionnaire, with assistance of local health
workers and authorities. During the community case-finding,
we measured the altitude at which the case-patients’ homes
were located using a global positioning system device. We
also collected soil samples from the homesteads and gar-
dens of the cases.
We conducted a case–control investigation in the most
affected subcounties to assess potential risk factors for
podoconiosis transmission. Through face-to-face interviews
using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information
on case and control persons. We enrolled only probable
case-persons for the case–control investigation. When a
household had more than one case-person, we randomly
selected one person to participate. For each case, we
selected
two
controls
among
asymptomatic
immediate
neighbors to the case-persons (community controls), matched
by age group (5-year age group) and sex using a case-to-
control ratio of 1:2. If multiple appropriate controls were avail-
able in one household, we randomly selected one, and picked
the second control from another household.
Sample size estimation. Of the 52 suspected case-
persons identified by the investigating team, 40 underwent
ICT and were all negative, hence meeting the definition for
probable case-persons. All the 40 probable case-persons
were enrolled as cases in the case–control investigation. Using
the Epi Info 7 Stat calculator option for matched case–control
studies, we estimated that 80 controls were needed to
detect an odds ratio (OR) of 2.5 assuming the exposure rate
in the nondiseased group to be 45%, with a power of 80%.
Data collection. Between September 21 and 30, 2015,
we used a standardized structured questionnaire to interview
cases and controls. We collected participant information on
sociodemographics, including age, sex, educational level,
and ocupation, duration of stay in Kamwenge District,
footwear, and foot hygiene practices.
Laboratory investigation. To rule out filarial elephantiasis,
we obtained fingerprick blood samples from suspected
case-persons and tested them for circulating Wuchereria
bancrofti antigen using an ICT (Binax NOW® Filariasis,
Inverness Medical, Scarborough, ME). Two drops of whole
blood were added onto an ICT test pad and the result was
subsequently observed. Although positive samples can be
identified in < 5 minutes, we observed the test result after
15 minutes to maximize the test sensitivity, which peaks
after this test duration. The ICT kits were refrigerated while in
storage and testing strictly conducted according to the
manufacturer’s protocols and guidelines.5 The kits were kept
in cool boxes throughout the fieldwork period.
Soil analysis. We collected five spot soil samples at the
surface and five from a depth of 0.5 m from homesteads,
gardens, and farm land areas where case-persons spent most
of the time during the day. The five samples (surface and
0.5 m depth) were pooled. Two aliquots of 20 g each were
preserved in 0.01% HNO3 and subsequently 5 g of each
aliquot was analyzed for free soil silicon and soil pH. The soil
analysis was conducted at the Department of Chemistry
Laboratory, Faculty of Science, Makerere University.
Data analysis. We assessed foot exposures to irritant
volcanic soils by comparing shoe-wearing habits and foot
hygiene practices between case- and control-persons. We
used the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) method to account for the
matched case–control design.
Ethical considerations. The Ministry of Health of Uganda
through the office of the Director General Health Services
gave the directive and approval to conduct this investigation.
Additionally, the office of the Associate Director for Science,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Uganda, deter-
mined that this investigation (protocol no. 2017-039) was not
human subjects’ research, because the primary purpose was
to identify, characterize, and control disease in response to a
perceived immediate public health threat. We obtained verbal
informed consent from case-persons and controls above
18 years. For participants below 18 years of age, we sought
verbal consent from their parents or guardians. We ensured
privacy by conducting interviews in a secure place where
none of the people around the home could follow proceed-
ings of the interview.
RESULTS
Disease description. We identified 52 suspected case-
persons with illness onset from 1980 to 2015. All suspected
case-persons had a lower limb involvement (Figure 1),
including lymphedema (100%), plantar edema (96%), and
skin itching (94%). Genital edema was present in only one
case-person. The epidemic curve showed relatively stable
number of cases over the last 35 years, indicating a continu-
ous common source exposure (Figure 2). Year of onset
“heaping” of case- patients at 5-year interval was also noted.
All suspected case-persons resided in 28 villages in Busiriba
and Kamwenge subcounties, located in the northern part of
the district (at-risk population = 421,470). These subcounties
are at a high altitude (median = 1,263 m; range = 1,163–
1,328 m) (Figure 3). The annual disease incidence based on
the suspected cases was 2.9/100,000. The mean age of the
suspected cases was 48 (range = 13–80) years. The preva-
lence rate increased with age (Table 1). The median age of
disease onset (lower limb swelling) was 35 (range = 8–76)
years. Females had a higher attack rate (1.6/1,000) than
males (0.32/1,000).
Hypothesis generation. Interview of 24 initial case-
persons revealed that all were farmers engaged in digging
and growing various crops; 14 (63%) never wore shoes while
at work and 16 (67%) never washed their feet during the day
and only washed feet before going to bed to sleep. We
therefore hypothesized that the disease was associated to
prolonged exposure to volcanic soils. Findings of the case–
control investigation were as follows: in the case–control
investigation, not wearing shoes at work was associated
with being a case (MH OR(ORMH) = 7.7; 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 2.0–30) and so was not wearing shoes at
home (ORMH = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.8–15), as shown in Table 2.
When we cross-tabulated shoe-wearing behaviors at work
and at home, not wearing shoes at work nor at home was
more associated with being a case compared with wearing
shoes both at work and at home (ORMH = 13; 95% CI = 2.6–
61) (Table 3). Similarly, only washing feet at the end of the
day before going to bed to sleep (compared with washing
feet within 2 hours after returning home from the fields) was
more associated with being a case (ORMH = 11; 95% CI =
2.0–56) (Table 3). The type, structure, or cover of the floor at
the participants’ homes or kitchen, and cultivating activities
1491

 in valley areas or cultivating activities in the areas adjacent
to the Kibaale Forest were not associated with the disease.
We also observed disease clustering within families: 55%
of case-persons compared with 15% of controls reported a
similar illness in at least one family member (ORMH = 11;
95% CI = 3.3–42). Compared with not having any family
member with similar disease or disease in a non blood rela-
tive family member, persons having a blood relative with
podoconiosis were more likely to be a case (ORMH = 9.2;
95% CI = 2.0–44).
Soil analysis. Of the 20 soil samples tested, the mean
free Silicon was 14 mg/dL (8.7–18 mg/dL). The average pH
was 6.3 (range = 5.6–6.8), which is in the acidic range.
DISCUSSION
Our investigation has uncovered endemic of elephantiasis
that was clinically and epidemiologically consistent with
podoconiosis in Kamwenge District, an area that has not
previously been known to be endemic for this disease. The
investigation demonstrated that simple and inexpensive
interventions to prevent foot exposure to irritant soils, such
as improving basic foot hygiene and ensuring universal use
of protective foot wear, can go a long way in preventing this
debilitating disease.
Podoconiosis is nonfilarial elephantiasis mainly affecting
lower limbs bilaterally. Typically, podoconiosis presents with
bilateral asymmetrical lower limb lymphedema that rarely
involves the genitals or progresses above the knee, pre-
ceded by repeated episodes of itching of the skin of the
forefoot and with associated burning sensations.11–15 The
disease has been associated with prolonged exposure to
irritant alkaline soils derived from the alkaline rock.12,13

 Podoconiosis is associated with high levels of disability,
reduced productivity, and social stigma. The disease,
however, is totally preventable with simple basic interven-
tions.16,17 Contrary to the perception that an outbreak of
elephantiasis had occurred in the area, we have uncovered a
chronic neglected tropical disease with a relatively stable
annual incidence over the last three decades. The year on
onset “heaping” at 5-year intervals noted on the epidemic
curve could be due to problems with recalling events that
happened > 20 years back. The fact that this disease had
never before been reported in this remote area implies that
the residents have been silently suffering from this disease
without help for more than 30 years.
Globally, it is estimated that about 4 million people are
affected by podoconiosis, particularly in east and central Africa,
Central and South America, and southeast Asia.13,14,18–21 Sur-
veys have noted a prevalence of 5–10% among populations
who work barefooted on irritant soils in endemic areas.22
High prevalence of podoconiosis has been found in countries
such as Ethiopia, India, Uganda, and Cameroon.22–27 In
Uganda, the disease has been reported on the slopes of
Mt Elgon in Kapchorwa in northeastern Uganda (areas rich in
volcanic soils), and in the highlands of Kabale and Kisoro
districts in southwestern Uganda.1,22,28,29 However, podo-
coniosis had never before been recognized in western Uganda
(Toro–Ankole region).
In this investigation, women were at greater risk compared
with men. Most of the published studies have shown a
higher risk in women as well.12,23,24,30,31 The few exceptions
were in central Ethiopia, the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:125
and in a previous study in eastern Uganda, the male-to-
female ratio was 1:1.22 The exact reason that women had a
higher risk was unknown. In our investigation, the higher
risk among women might be due to the fact that, in rural
Uganda, women are more likely than men to be engaged in

 agriculture activities and spend longer periods in the fields
and are therefore more exposed to irritant soils.4 This can also
be explained by sex differences in preventive behaviors such
as shoe ownership and shoe use between men and women.
Podoconiosis has been theorized to be caused by an
interplay between environmental risk and personal factors
that predispose an individual to prolonged exposure with
irritant volcanic soils.13,32–35 Our investigation findings were
consistent with findings of previous studies that showed that
podoconiosis generally occurred in high-altitude and high-
precipitation (> 1,000 mm annually) areas.36 Kamwenge
District and surrounding districts are known to have heavy
annual precipitation of 1,200 mm.37 The low pH (measure of
solvated hydrogen ion to define acidity or alkalinity) of the
soils in the area was similar to that documented elsewhere
and has been mainly attributed to the high rainfall, leaching
calcium and other bases in the volcanic soils.36 The Toro–
Ankole volcanics where Kamwenge District is located lies
in the western branch of the East African Rift System.38
Geochronological data suggest that about 2.5 million years
ago during the late quaternary pulse of volcanic activity that
occurred in the area, emitted alkaline magma rocks and
ashes, which have undergone chemical weathering over
time.39–42 The soils in the area are predominantly cambisols
and ferralsols with weathered volcanic nitiosols on the gentle
slopes plus clay-rich vertisols in the valley floors. Such soils
also exist in some parts in eastern and northwesten Uganda
(West Nile).43 However, the area where the disease was
reported was once covered by extensive forest and grass-
land vegetation. However, beginning in the 1960s, mas-
sive migration of mainly cultivators from southwest Uganda
replaced the indigenous hunter-gathering tribe of the area
and, subsequently, the soils were laid bare.37,44 This period
of mass cultivation coincides with the appearance of the
disease in the area.
Our findings also showed that, whereas both case-persons
and controls were predominantly farmers, not wearing shoes
at work or at home was strongly associated with developing
podoconiosis. In addition, quickly washing feet after soil
exposure was protective against disease risk. This finding
was consistent with those in previous studies conducted in
Ethiopia.20,30,32,45 Unlike in previous studies, our investiga-
tion found no association between the floor type or floor
cover in the house and disease. This lack of association
could be explained by the fact that these floor covers were
partial and do not prevent feet–soil contact. The floor covers
in the area were mainly for people to sit, particularly during
meal times.
Podoconiosis has been noted in the published literature to
have a genetic predisposition, with family clustering of the
disease noted in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Burundi.30,33 A study
by Davey and others in Ethiopia found a 5-fold increase in
podoconiosis risk among siblings of affected individuals.34
Our investigation found a 9-fold increase in the odds of
disease development among participants with history of
disease among family members. However, this associa-
tion became statistically nonsignificant on stratification on
blood relations, indicating that the association was due
to confounding.
In this investigation, due to logistical challenges, we were
only able to take 20 soil samples for analysis. We were also
unable to histologically rule out other pathologies such as
leprosy or Kaposis sarcoma, which might lead to misclass-
ification of podoconiosis.15 However, in making a podo-
coniosis diagnosis, WHO recommends consideration of one’s
location, history, clinical findings, and absence of microfilaria
or antigen on immunological card test in populations living at
high altitudes (> 1000 m above the sea level). More still,
the ICT has been shown to be an appropriate field test
for detecting microfillaria with > 95% sensitivity and 100%

 specificity when compared with thick blood smear examina-
tion.7–9,46 We strictly adhered to the WHO gold standard for
podoconiosis diagnosis.47 Further still, studies have shown
that the negative predictive value of using a mere clinical
assessment in making a podoconiosis diagnosis exceeds
90%, compared with the WHO gold standard.48
In conclusion, our investigation revealed nonfilarial ele-
phantiasis consistent with podoconiosis in an area not previ-
ously known to be endemic with this disease. Prolonged
foot exposure to irritant volcanic soils (as a result of not
wearing protective foot wear while at work and home and
delayed foot washing to get rid of irritant soils) was strongly
associated with the disease. We recommend that residents
in Kamwenge District are provided with gumboots or other
protective shoes to reduce the risk of this disabling disease.
Our study findings served to inform the Ugandan Ministry of
Health and Kamwenge District local government about the
existence of podoconiosis in the region and as a basis for
advocacy and programming. Surveillance and provision of
care for patients with podoconiosis ensued following dis-
semination of the study findings. Further research to bet-
ter understand the genetic dynamics of the disease in the
country is commended.
