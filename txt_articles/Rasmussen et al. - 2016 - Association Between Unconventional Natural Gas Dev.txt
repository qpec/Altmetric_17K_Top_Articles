IMPORTANCE Asthma is common and can be exacerbated by air pollution and stress.
Unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) has community and environmental
impacts. In Pennsylvania, UNGD began in 2005, and by 2012, 6253 wells had been drilled.
There are no prior studies of UNGD and objective respiratory outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations between UNGD and asthma exacerbations.
DESIGN A nested case-control study comparing patients with asthma with and without
exacerbations from 2005 through 2012 treated at the Geisinger Clinic, which provides
primary care services to over 400 000 patients in Pennsylvania. Patients with asthma aged 5
to 90 years (n = 35 508) were identified in electronic health records; those with
exacerbations were frequency matched on age, sex, and year of event to those without.
EXPOSURES On the day before each patient’
s index date (cases, date of event or medication
order; controls, contact date), we estimated activity metrics for 4 UNGD phases (pad
preparation, drilling, stimulation [hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”], and production) using
distance from the patient’
s home to the well, well characteristics, and the dates and durations
of phases.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We identified and defined asthma exacerbations as mild
(new oral corticosteroid medication order), moderate (emergency department encounter), or
severe (hospitalization).
RESULTS We identified 20 749 mild, 1870 moderate, and 4782 severe asthma exacerbations,
and frequency matched these to 18 693, 9350, and 14 104 control index dates, respectively.
In 3-level adjusted models, there was an association between the highest group of the activity
metric for each UNGD phase compared with the lowest group for 11 of 12 UNGD-outcome
pairs: odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for the association of the pad metric
with severe exacerbations to 4.4 (95% CI, 3.8-5.2) for the association of the production
metric with mild exacerbations. Six of the 12 UNGD-outcome associations had increasing ORs
across quartiles. Our findings were robust to increasing levels of covariate control and in
sensitivity analyses that included evaluation of some possible sources of unmeasured
confounding.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Residential UNGD activity metrics were statistically
associated with increased risk of mild, moderate, and severe asthma exacerbations. Whether
these associations are causal awaits further investigation, including more detailed exposure
assessment.

A
sthma is a common chronic disease—in 2010, 25.7 mil-
lion people in the United States had asthma, a preva-
lence of 8.4%.1 Asthma is characterized by variable and
recurring symptoms (including cough, wheezing, shortness of
breath,andchesttightness),reversibleairflowobstruction,bron-
chialhyperresponsiveness,andunderlyinginflammation.2,3 In
2009,therewere11.8millionoutpatientvisits,2.1millionemer-
gency department visits, and 479 300 hospitalizations for
asthma in the United States.1
Outdoor air pollution is a recognized cause of asthma ex-
acerbations. A large body of literature links asthma exacerba-
tions to exposure to air pollutants, including ozone, particu-
late matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide,2,4 and
exposure to even low levels of these pollutants has been as-
sociated with asthma hospitalizations, emergency depart-
ment visits, and rescue medication use, with latency be-
tween 0 and 5 days.5-11 Stress at the individual and community
levels is also associated with asthma exacerbations.12 Psycho-
social stress can modify the effects of environmental triggers13
and is associated with worse asthma control and medication
aderence.14
Unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) has re-
cently become a major energy source domestically and world-
wide. Pennsylvania has proceeded with UNGD rapidly—
between the mid-2000s and 2012, 6253 wells were drilled. In
contrast, New York and Maryland, also in the Marcellus shale,
havenotdeveloped.15,16Despitecallsforresearchonthehealth
effects of the industry, there are few published studies of pub-
lic health impacts of UNGD.17,18
The first step of UNGD is well pad preparation, lasting
about 30 days, during which 3 to 5 acres are cleared, and
materials are brought to the site.19 Drilling begins on the
spud date and typically lasts up to a month as a well is
drilled vertically 2000 to 3000 m and horizontally 600 to
3000 m.19 After drilling is completed, the horizontal portion
is perforated. Stimulation, also called hydraulic fracturing or
“fracking,” follows; this process lasts about a week and
requires 11 to 19 million liters of water, sand, and chemical
additives (eg, friction reducers, biocides, gelling agents).19,20
Development to this point requires over 1000 truck trips per
well.19 After stimulation, gas production begins. The Penn-
sylvania Department of Environmental Protection requires
companies to submit documentation at most of these stages
of well development.21
UNGD has been associated with air quality and commu-
nity social impacts.22-29 Psychosocial stress,12 exposure to
air pollution4,30 including from truck traffic,31 sleep
disruption,32,33 and reduced socioeconomic status34 are all
biologically plausible pathways for UNGD to affect asthma
exacerbations. To date, there have been no epidemiologic
studies of UNGD and objective respiratory outcomes. Respi-
ratory outcomes are appropriate outcomes to assess poten-
tial health impacts of UNGD because these have clear links
to air pollution and stress, have short latency between
exposure and health effects, are common in the general
population, and prompt patients to seek care and so are
captured by health system data. Using electronic health rec-
ord (EHR) data from the Geisinger Clinic, located in over 35
counties in Pennsylvania, including many with active
UNGD, we conducted a nested case-control study of the
association between 4 UNGD activity metrics and asthma
exacerbations.
Methods
Study Population
We identified patients with asthma from the Geisinger
Clinic population, which is representative of the general
population in the region.35 We included Pennsylvania and
New York patients and, using International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
codes, excluded patients with cystic fibrosis (277.0x),
chronic pulmonary heart disease (416.x), paralysis of vocal
cords or larynx (478.3x), bronchiectasis (494.xx), and pneu-
moconiosis (500.xx-508.xx). We required patients to have
at least 2 encounters or medication orders with ICD-9-CM
codes for asthma on different days.36 Patients were geo-
coded using previously published methods,37 88.9% to
home address, 2.6% to ZIP + 4, and 8.5% to ZIP code cen-
troid. Inclusion criteria also included contact with Geisinger
from 2005 through 2012 while between the ages 5 and 90
years and recorded information on sex (n = 35 508). The
study was approved by the Geisinger Health System institu-
tional review board (which has an authorization agreement
with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health)
with a waiver of consent and a waiver of HIPAA authoriza-
tion. Patients were not paid for their participation.
Outcome Ascertainment
We identified and defined new oral corticosteroid (OCS) medi-
cation orders, asthma emergency department encounters, and
asthma hospitalizations as mild, moderate, and severe exac-
erbations, respectively. For patients with more than 1 exacer-
bation of a given type within a calendar year, we randomly se-
lected 1 event. For mild exacerbations, we distinguished new
OCS medication orders from 2008 through 2012 for an asthma
exacerbation from standing orders or OCS ordered for other
diseases (Figure 1). The medication order date was consid-
ered the index date. OCS orders from before 2008 were ex-
cluded because these were not consistently captured before
Key Points
Question Is there an association between unconventional natural
gas development (UNGD) and asthma exacerbations?
Findings In this nested case-control study of 35 508 patients with
asthma, those in the highest quartile of residential UNGD activity
had significantly higher odds of 3 types of asthma exacerbations
(new oral corticosteroid medication orders, emergency
department visits, and hospitalizations) than those in the lowest
quartile.
Meaning UNGD activity near patient residences was associated
with increased odds of mild, moderate, and severe asthma
exacerbations.

then. For moderate and severe exacerbations, we identified all
emergency and hospitalization encounters from 2005 through
2012. Primary or secondary diagnoses for asthma (ICD-9-CM
code 493.x) were used to identify emergency or hospitaliza-
tion encounters. Patients who had multiple emergency or
hospitalization encounters within 72 hours were considered
to have a single event. Emergency and hospitalization
encounters within 72 hours were identified as a single hospi-
talization. The first encounter or admission date of each group
of combined encounters was the index date. For patients with
more than 1 type of exacerbation within a week, we retained
only the higher category.
Controls and Matching
We identified controls from patients with asthma under
observation by the health system, so that if the patient were
to have an exacerbation, it would be captured by the EHR.
All patient contact dates were identified (eg, encounter,
order, test). Because many of the covariates and the UNGD
metrics were time varying, we needed a single date on
which to assign these variables. Therefore, for controls, we
randomly selected 1 contact date per year per patient. A case
patient was always eligible to be a control for a less severe
event or for an event of equal or greater severity until the
year of the case patient’
s event. We frequency matched
cases to controls by age category (5-12, 13-18, 19-44, 45-61,
62-74, or ≥75 years), sex (male or female), and year of
encounter.

ing status, overweight and obesity status, Medical Assistance

betes)foreachindexdateandnon–time-varyingcovariates(sex
and race/ethnicity) for each patient. Race/ethnicity was as-
sessed by patient self-report and was included because it is a
well-documented confounder in studies of asthma.2 We esti-
mated the patients’distance to the nearest major and minor
road using a network from the Federal Highway
Administration38 and used patients’geographic coordinates to
assign them to a community using a mixed definition of place
andcalculatedcommunitysocioeconomicdeprivationforthese
places.37,39Incities,communitiesweredefinedbycensustracts;
elsewhere, communities were defined by minor civil divi-
sions (townships and boroughs). We estimated the peak tem-
perature on the day before each index date using data from the
nearest weather station to each patient.40
Well Data
Well data were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection for well spud (start of drilling) and
production,thePennsylvaniaDepartmentofConservationand
NaturalResourcesforinformationonwellstimulation(hydrau-
lic fracturing) and depths, and SkyTruth, which used crowd-
sourcing of aerial photographs from the US Department of
Agriculturetoidentifythelocationofwellpads.41Foreachwell,
we had information on the well pad; latitude and longitude;
datesofspudding,stimulation,andproduction;totaldepth;and
volume of natural gas produced and the number of production
days. We imputed missing total depths (0.4%) using condi-
tionalmeanimputation.Weestimatedmissingproductionquan-
tities(0.2%)byaveragingproductionquantitiesinthepriorand
following period. We extrapolated missing spud (2.0%) and
stimulation(34.6%)datesusingthewell’
savailabledatesofde-
velopment by requiring that the stimulation date fall between
the spud and production start dates and by using median du-
rations between phases from wells without any missing dates.
Activity Metric Assignment
We estimated the UNGD activity metrics using an inverse dis-
tance-squared method for pad preparation, spud, stimula-
tion, and production phases. We compared activity metrics on
the day before, 3 days before, the sum of 3 to 5 days before,
and the sum of 1 to 5 days before the index date, and because
they were highly correlated (Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.96 to 1.00), we used only the day before
the index date.
For the pad preparation and spud metrics, we used Equa-

where n is the number of wells, dij

ral gas production volume (cubic meters) of well i. Produc-
tion volume was used as a surrogate for fugitive emissions and
compressor engine activity.22
Based on descriptions of the process19 and our data, we es-
timated that pad development lasted 30 days before the spud
date for the first well on a pad; drilling lasted between 1 and
30 days after the spud date based on total depth; and stimu-
lation lasted 7 days. All wells in Pennsylvania in a given phase
on the day prior to an index date contributed to that phase’
s
activity metric (Equations 1-3). We divided the 4 continuous
metrics (pad preparation, drilling, stimulation, and produc-
tion) into quartiles using all 69 548 index dates from all 3 out-
comes (mild, moderate, or severe asthma exacerbation), so the
cut points were the same for all outcomes (very low, low, me-
dium, or high).
Statistical Analysis
To assess the association of the 4 UNGD activity metrics
with the 3 types of asthma exacerbations, we used multi-
level logistic regression with random intercept for patient
and community to account for multiple events per patient
and patient clustering within communities. The base model
included 1 of the 4 UNGD activity metrics (very low,
low, medium, or high), age category (5-12, 13-18, 19-44,
45-61, 62-74, or ≥75 years), sex (male or female), race/
ethnicity (black, Hispanic, white, or other), family history of
asthma (yes or no), smoking status (former, current, never,
or data missing), season (summer, fall, winter, or spring),
Medical Assistance (yes or no), and overweight/obesity
status (using BMI percentile for children and BMI for
adults43) as covariates. We then added, 1 at a time, type 2
diabetes (yes or no), community socioeconomic deprivation
(across quartiles),37,39 distances to nearest major and minor
arterial road (in meters, z transformed), and maximum tem-
perature on the day prior to the event (degrees Celsius, per
interquartile range [IQR]) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). We
included the continuous covariates as linear and quadratic
terms to allow for nonlinearity and used a 2-sided type 1
error rate of .05 for significance testing. We used Stata soft-
ware, version 11.2 (StataCorp LP) and R software, version
3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), for our
analyses.
Model Building
We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient for the per-
son and community levels. The proportions of total variance
that were accounted for by between-community variation and
between-person variation, respectively, were 14% and 63% for
severe exacerbations, 41% and 89% for moderate exacerba-
tions, and 1% and 59% for mild exacerbations. We evaluated
covariates for conditional significance as they were added to
the models.
Sensitivity Analyses
To evaluate how the 4 separate UNGD activity metrics com-
pared with a summary measure, we calculated z scores using
continuous metrics, summed the z scores, and re-ran the
final models with this combined UNGD activity metric
(across quartiles). To explore whether an unmeasured con-
founder was responsible for our associations, we evaluated
associations with encounters for a negative control44 (intes-
tinal infectious disease and noninfectious gastroenteritis,
ICD-9-CM codes 001-009 and 558.9, respectively) among
patients with asthma, and we also replaced the UNGD activ-
ity metric with indicators for counties. We were concerned
about the unbalanced numbers of cases and controls for cer-
tain age categories, sex, and years in the mild exacerbations
analysis, so we reran the analysis dropping the unbalanced
cells. To check the sensitivity to geocoding level, we re-ran
the final model for the production UNGD metric and each
outcome using only patients who were geocoded to their
home address. We estimated how large an unmeasured con-
founder would need to be to account for the observed asso-
ciations, in whole or in part.45
Results
Descriptions of Wells and Patients
Between2005and2012,6253unconventionalnaturalgaswells
were spudded on 2710 pads; 4728 were stimulated; and 3706
were in production. The median number of wells per pad was
1 (IQR, 1-3), and the median total depth was 3394 m (IQR, 2934-
3839 m). Most development occurred after 2007 (Figure 2). On
their index date, patients in the highest group of the spud
metric lived a median of 19 km from the closest spudded well
comparedwith63kmforpatientsinthelowestgroup.Weiden-
tified 5600 severe, 2291 moderate, and 25 647 mild exacerba-
tions. After retaining 1 event per type per year per person, 4782
severe, 1870 moderate, and 20 749 mild exacerbations were
included. There was substantial overlap of patients and wells
in the northern counties (Figure 3) and substantial overlap of
patients by quartile of UNGD activity metric (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement).
Demographic and clinical variables differed by outcome,
in many cases significantly, and the specific data quantifying

these significant differences are reported in Table 1. Com-
paredwithpatientswithmildandmoderateexacerbations,pa-
tients with severe exacerbations were more likely to be fe-
male,older,currentsmokers,andobese(allP < .001;seeTable1

tions were more likely to be on Medical Assistance and of black
racethanpatientswiththeother2outcomes,andpatientswith
mild exacerbations were more likely to live in townships than
patients with the other 2 outcomes (all P < .001; see Table 1 for
all supporting data).
Associations of UNGD Activity Metrics
With Asthma Outcomes
For severe, moderate, and mild exacerbations, the average
percentage changes for all odds ratios (ORs), from simple
models with random intercepts for person and place with-
out covariates to fully adjusted multilevel models, were
−8.5%, −0.2%, and 6.0%, respectively, suggesting little sen-
sitivity of the associations with measured covariates. In
adjusted models, the high activity (vs very low) of each
UNGD metric was associated with each asthma outcome
(Table 2), except for the pad metric with mild exacerbations.
Associations for the other 11 exposure-outcome pairs ranged
from OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for pad metric with severe
exacerbations to OR, 4.4 (95% CI, 3.8-5.2) for production
metric with mild exacerbations. Of the 12 activity metric-
outcome pairs, 6 had increasing ORs across quartiles 2, 3,
and 4.
Sensitivity Analyses
The 4 UNGD activity metrics, calculated for all case and
control index dates (n = 69 548), were correlated with one
another (Spearman correlation coefficients of the continu-
ous variables ranged from 0.73 to 0.91). In the analysis to
evaluate associations of a combined UNGD activity metric of
the 4 phases of development, the OR point estimates were
between those from regressions of each phase separately. In
the negative disease control analysis, we found no associa-
tion of the spud activity metric with gastrointestinal illness.
In a model evaluating associations of counties with out-
comes (UNGD metrics removed), counties with high UNGD
activity were not associated with outcomes. In the analysis
that removed cells with unbalanced numbers of cases and
controls in the mild exacerbation analysis, associations
were attenuated (ORs decreased by 5%, 17%, 37%, and 55%
for the high group OR for the pad, spud, stimulation, and

of 0.3 in the exposed group, would not likely change our
inference about associations, given our models. However,
for moderate exacerbations, an unmeasured confounder
with the same characteristics could account for 2 of the 3
statistically significant associations.
Discussion
We conducted a nested case-control study in a large number
of patients with asthma using EHR data in Pennsylvania
from 2005 through 2012, a period of rapid development. In
this first study of UNGD and objective respiratory outcomes,
we found consistent associations of 4 UNGD activity metrics
with 3 types of asthma exacerbations. Whether these asso-
ciations are causal awaits further investigation, including
more detailed exposure assessment.
Asthma is a suitable outcome because UNGD has commu-
nity and environmental impacts that could affect it: it is highly
prevalent; it can be exacerbated by stress and small changes
in air quality with short latency; and patients usually seek care
for exacerbations so they are captured by an EHR. By leverag-
ing longitudinal EHR data, we were able to complete a num-
ber of sensitivity analyses that suggested that the associa-
tions were robust to increasing levels of adjustment, although
in some cases they were attenuated.
Studiesofairpollutionandasthmaexacerbationshavegen-
erally found small but consistently increased risks. A study of
pediatric emergency department visits for asthma in Atlanta
found that a standard deviation increase in pollution had as-
sociated risk ratios of 1.020, 1.036, and 1.062 for particulate
matter smaller than 10 μm, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone,
respectively.46 Studies on psychosocial stress have found that
in children with asthma, the risk of an asthma exacerbation
increased 4.7 times in the 2 days following a very stressful
event.47 Adults exposed to violence in their community have
2.3 and 2.5 times the risk of an asthma emergency depart-
ment visit and hospitalization, respectively, than those not ex-
posed to community violence.48
Two sensitivity analyses were directed to the very impor-
tant possibility that unmeasured confounding could account
for our results. First, UNGD metrics were not associated with
the negative disease control. Second, in the analysis replac-
ing UNGD metrics with indicators for counties, counties with
UNGD were not associated with severe exacerbations. These
both provide evidence that unmeasured confounding is un-
likely to account for our findings, but we acknowledge that the
possibility still exists. We note that an unmeasured con-
founder would need to be strongly associated with both UNGD
and asthma outcomes to account for our results. In sensitiv-
ity analysis to address unbalanced numbers of cases and con-
trols, results were attenuated; the majority of dropped pa-
tientsmadeupthemostsusceptiblegroups(youngerandolder)
in the most exposed years, so attenuation was not unex-
pected. Finally, geocoding method and analysis with an over-
all activity metric did not change inferences.

This study had several strengths, including a large sample
size from a population that represents the general population
in the region. In addition, our exposure assessment im-
proved on that used in prior studies,49,50 which used categori-
cal distance-based metrics that did not account for UNGD
phases. Our metric incorporated the temporality and
duration of phases, gas production volume, and a surrogate
for truck traffic. This study also improved on outcome ascer-
tainment used in the previous study on UNGD and respira-
tory outcomes,50 which relied on self-reported outcomes and
grouped several respiratory symptoms and conditions to-
gether (including asthma). We used documented asthma ex-
acerbations. Our findings were robust to increasing levels of
covariate control and in several sensitivity analyses.
This study also had limitations. The EHR did not contain
information on occupation and only reflects patients’most re-
cent address. However, comparing addresses used in a prior
study35 with addresses used in this study (39 months apart),
79.8% of patients were at the same address, and an addi-
tional 7.4% and 7.6% were less than 3.2 km and from 3.2 to 16.0
km, respectively, from their prior address, indicating little resi-
dential mobility. The EHR contained data only on events that
occur at Geisinger facilities, but ambulances go to the closest
hospital, so we may have undercounted events. We were un-
able to differentiate between asthma exacerbations that were
hospitalized from those that occurred while hospitalized. We
frequency matched cases and controls for year because UNGD
activity metrics and year were highly correlated. We did not
include year in the final model because of this high correla-
tion, so there remains the possibility of unmeasured residual
confounding by factors that strongly vary by year. We kept all
4 UNGD metrics because of a priori evidence that exposures
differed by phase, but because metrics were highly corre-
lated, we were unable to definitively distinguish among them.
Furthermore, our UNGD metrics do not provide insight into
the mechanism of the associations we observed.
Conclusions
Asthma is a common disease with large individual and soci-
etal burdens, so the possibility that UNGD may increase risk
for asthma exacerbations requires public health attention.
As ours is the first study to our knowledge of UNGD and
objective respiratory outcomes, and several other health
outcomes have not been investigated to date, there is an
urgent need for more health studies. These should include
more detailed exposure assessment to better characterize
pathways and to identify the phases of development that
present the most risk.
