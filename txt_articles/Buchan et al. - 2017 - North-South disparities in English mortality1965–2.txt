background Social, economic and health disparities 
between northern and southern England have persisted 
despite Government policies to reduce them. We 
examine long-term trends in premature mortality in 
northern and southern England across age groups, and 
whether mortality patterns changed after the 2008–
2009 Great Recession.
Methods Population-wide longitudinal (1965–2015) 
study of mortality in England’s five northernmost versus 
four southernmost Government Office Regions – halves 
of overall population. Main outcome measure: directly 
age-sex adjusted mortality rates; northern excess 
mortality (percentage excess northern vs southern 
deaths, age-sex adjusted).
results From 1965 to 2010, premature mortality 
(deaths per 10 000 aged <75 years) declined from 64 
to 28 in southern versus 72 to 35 in northern England. 
From 2010 to 2015 the rate of decline in premature 
mortality plateaued in northern and southern England. 
For most age groups, northern excess mortality remained 
consistent from 1965 to 2015. For 25–34 and 35–44 
age groups, however, northern excess mortality increased 
sharply between 1995 and 2015: from 2.2% (95% CI 
–3.2% to 7.6%) to 29.3% (95% CI 21.0% to 37.6%); 
and 3.3% (95% CI –1.0% to 7.6%) to 49.4% (95% CI 
42.8% to 55.9%), respectively. This was due to northern 
mortality increasing (ages 25–34) or plateauing (ages 
35–44) from the mid-1990s while southern mortality 
mainly declined.
conclusions England’s northern excess mortality has 
been consistent among those aged <25 and 45+ for 
the past five decades but risen alarmingly among those 
aged 25–44 since the mid-90s, long before the Great 
Recession. This profound and worsening structural 
inequality requires more equitable economic, social 
and health policies, including potential reactions to 
the England-wide loss of improvement in premature 
mortality.
IntroductIon
England has profound and persistent regional 
divides in economy, society and health.1–3 Major 
structural disparities in power and resources 
between northern and southern territories were 
described as far back as the 11th century in the wake 
of Norman suppression of the North.4 By the 18th 
century the concept of a North-South divide, with 
political and economic power concentrated in the 
South, was widely acknowledged5 and judged unac-
ceptable by commentators from across the political 
spectrum. In 1845, the plight of the working classes 
following an extended period of rapid industriali-
sation was placed in the context of regional differ-
ences in material conditions and health by future 
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in his novel 
Sybil—The Two Nations,6 and by Friedrich Engels 
in The Condition of the Working Class in England,7 
leading to the development of radically different 
political solutions.8 In more recent political history, 
successive governments have commissioned reports 
on health inequalities and have set policies to reduce 
them,9–12 but the divide has remained.
In 2010, we used the historical geography of 
the North-South divide to examine trends over 
time in English mortality and found a persistent 
20% northern excess in premature (under age 75 
years) mortality from 1965 to 2008.13 Over this 
period, the total burden of mortality in England 
fell by around 50% in men and 40% in women, 
but the North-South gap did not close. For younger 
age groups (under 50 years), the gap increased 
from the mid-1990s onwards, despite a relatively 
benign economic climate and the implementation 
of national policies to reduce inequalities in health. 
This worsening of early premature mortality 
remains underexplored.
The Great Recession of 2008–2009 raises new 
questions about inequalities in mortality. Somewhat 
counterintuitively, mortality rates tend to decline 
faster during economic downturns, mediated in part 
by changes in: work and leisure patterns (through 
greater available time for family, leisure and phys-
ical activities and a reduction in motor vehicle 
deaths); and health-related behaviours (through a 
reduction in risky health behaviours during reces-
sions).14 Some adverse risky behaviours such as 
excessive alcohol use decline during recessions 
and increase during periods of economic growth.15 
However, the impact on inequalities in mortality 
is less clear. Higher levels of deprivation in the 
North may result in a slower decline in mortality 
rates during recessions. In addition, the depth of 
the 2008–2009 recession was greater than previous 
recessions in 1990–1991, 1980–1981 and 1973–
1975, and it was followed by a prolonged period of 
austerity and restricted public spending. During this 
period, the long-term trend for declining suicide 
rates sharply reversed in the UK, with the greatest 
increases occurring in the areas experiencing the 
highest rises in unemployment16; areas concen-
trated in the North.17 Given the strong associations 
between unemployment, (relative) poverty, social 
welfare and health, it is reasonable to consider how 
this economic shock and the subsequent policy

response impacted on long-standing regional disparities in 
mortality.18 The current UK/global political and economic turbu-
lence raises the importance of new policy evidence in this area.
In the present study, we identify the age groups most affected 
by northern excess mortality and examine long-term trends in 
mortality for these groups in the North and the South. We also 
examine changes in these long-term trends following the 2008–
2009 Great Recession.
Methods
data sources and geographies
For the whole of England and by region, we obtained annual 
counts of deaths (by any cause, registered in the specified year), 
and midyear population estimates in all years from 1965 to 
2015, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS 
midyear populations were based on Decennial Censuses and 
interpolated estimates obtained for the remaining years (extrap-
olated for 2012 onwards). The death and population data were 
stratified by sex and age group (infants; 1–4; 5–9; …; 80–84; 
85 and over). We also used ONS deprivation statistics: Index 
of Multiple Deprivation 2015 at lower layer super output area 
(districts of mean 1500 population).
The regions were defined, using established methodology,13 
as aggregates of Government Office Regions: North (North 
East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands 
and West Midlands); and South (East, South West, London and 
South East). This geography divides the English population into 
two approximately equal halves: the five northernmost and the 
four southernmost Government Office Regions, which approxi-
mates to a line drawn between the Wash and the Severn Estuary, 
and is consistent with previous studies.4 19 20
statistical analyses
Mortality rates were calculated from death registrations and 
midyear population estimates and examined by age group, sex 
and region (North vs South England) for each year from 1965 
to 2015.
Age-sex adjusted mortality rates were derived using direct 
standardisation for population structure, with the total period 
population as the reference, and were used for comparing 
changes over time by regions and age groups.
Where the only statistic drawn from each year was a mortality 
rate ratio, Poisson models were fitted by year (with death as 
the outcome, the natural logarithm of the midyear popula-
tion size estimate as the offset, and age/sex groups as categor-
ical covariates). In this way, North and South were compared 
after standardising for age and sex across the entire population 
within the relevant year, and the adjusted mortality rate ratios 
were presented as ‘northern excess mortality’ (the percentage 
of excess deaths in the North compared with the South after 
adjusting for differences in age and sex).
To study how age-specific mortality rate ratios between North 
and South changed over time, we fitted a Poisson model as above, 
but with age/sex/year groups and north/south status as categor-
ical covariates. We included a three-way interaction between age 
group, year and north/south status.
To address the hypothesis of change around recession 
periods we report, from the Poisson model, relative change 
in overall northern excess premature mortality (under 75) in 
the year after the recession compared with 3 years earlier, for 
the recessions of 1973–1975, 1980–1981, 1990–1991 and 
2008–2009.
Statistics are presented as the main effect with 95% CIs.
results
demographics
The average North:South population size ratio from 1965 to 
2015 was 1.050 for men and 1.030 for women. The South grew 
faster than that of the North over the study period and by 2015 
the North:South population ratios were 0.878 for men and 
0.879 for women.
Changes in the age-sex structures of North and South 
England from 1965 to 2015 are illustrated in Supplementary 
figure A1. In the North, the median age for women increased 
from 37.0 in the first 3 years of the period to 41.4 in the last 
3 years, and for men from 34.0 to 39.5. In the South, median 
ages increased from 38.4 to 40.8 for women and from 34.9 to 
38.9 for men. Over the study period, the proportion of people 
over 65 increased more in North England (22.9% to 36.7%) 
than in South England (25.9% to 34.4%). Correspondingly, 
the proportion of men aged 25–44 decreased in the North 
(from 53.9% to 50.7%) but increased in the South (from 
49.6% to 49.8%); for women, the proportions increased from 
53.5% to 56.7% in the North and from 49.1% to 55.2% in 
the South.
Figure 1 illustrates the split of English regions into northern 
and southern halves by expectation of life at birth (men, women) 
for each Government Office Region, and by material deprivation 
using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 summarised as the 
proportion of neighbourhoods (lower layer super output areas: 
mean population size 1500) falling in the 10% most deprived 
for all England.
Premature mortality time trends
Taking the key public health indicator of premature mortality, 
crude rates (as deaths per 10 
000 population under age 75 years) 
fell in the North from 72 in 1965 to 35 in 2010 and in the South 
from 64 to 28 (figure 2A). From 2012, both crude and age-sex 
adjusted (figure 2B) rates appear to plateau. Relative changes in 
northern excess premature mortality before and after each reces-
sion were small (Supplementary table A1 and figure A2).
A gap in crude premature mortality rates of between 7.1 
(1968) and 10.2 (1988) deaths per 10 
000 aged <75 years, 
changing smoothly over time, existed between North and South 
throughout the study period (figure 2A). In 1965, the difference 
in age-sex adjusted rates was 11.9 per 10 000, steadily closing 
thereafter to 5.6 per 10 
000 in 2010 (figure 2B). After 2010, this 
gap in crude rates widened while the rise in age-sex adjusted 
relative rates became larger.
After adjusting within each year for the age-sex population 
structure differences between North and South England, using 
Poisson models, northern excess premature mortality increased 
from 17.5% (95% CI 16.7% to 18.4%) in 1965 to 21.5% (95% 
CI 20.2%–22.7%) in 2015, with the largest excess being 23% 
(95% CI 21.8% to 24.3%) in 2014 (Supplementary figure A2). 
In absolute terms, the total number of northern excess prema-
ture deaths throughout the study period was 1 
173 
360 (95% CI 
1 
112 
724 to 1 
234 
280).
Age-group specific mortality time trends
Figure 3 shows the northern excess mortality for all age groups 
and years in this study. The current hot spot of over 50% greater 
risk of death in middle adult life in the North compared with 
the South appears to have a cohort pattern originating in the 
mid-90s. We do not make strong inferences about younger age 
groups where numbers of deaths are small. The following anal-
yses unpick mortality trends over time in wider age bands.

Figure 4 examines excess mortality in the North by age 
group, using Poisson models with age-group/year/region inter-
action terms, contrasting the 2010–2015 period following the 
Great Recession with the two previous decades, and with the 
early half of the study period. Over five decades, northern 
excess mortality followed a consistent pattern: high (13%–
25% excess) in the under 5s, declining with increasing age 
to the mid-30s, then climbing to a peak (18%–23% excess) 
in the 50–74 age group, before falling again. Prior to 2000, 
the lowest northern excess mortality was consistently found 
in the 20–34 age group, but after 2000 the pattern reversed 
with the 25–44 age group showing the highest northern excess 
mortality.
Important underlying patterns are seen by examining the 
change over time in age subgroup mortality in North and South 
England. Figure 5 charts the change over time in northern excess 
mortality at ages 25–34, 35–44 and 45–54 years, derived from 
within-year Poisson models:

between 1965 and 1984, with a slightly faster rate of 
decline, from a higher baseline, in the North. Rates then 
climbed slightly in both regions until 1995, after which 
they continued to increase for the rest of the decade in 
the North while declining rapidly in the South, opening 
a large gap in excess mortality which persisted to the end 
of the study period. The absolute gap in age-sex adjusted 
mortality for the 25–34 age group (figure 6A) closed 
from 7.9% (95% CI 1.9% to 14.0%) in 1965 to 2.2%

dIscussIon
summary of findings
We examined long-term trends in mortality in the North and 
South of England, focusing on the age groups most affected by 
northern excess mortality. Between 1965 and 2010, national 
mortality declined while the northern excess remained consis-
tent for most age groups. Among adults aged 25–44, however, 
northern excess mortality increased sharply from the mid-1990s 
onwards due to a stall in the North of the long-term decline in 
mortality. By 2012, following the Great Recession of 2008–2009, 
four decades of declining premature mortality in both North and 
South England had stalled, a pattern not seen following earlier 
recessions.
strengths and limitations of the study
This study analysed mortality data over five decades for 
England’s population, enabling differences in long-term trends 
between North and South to be examined in full. Measuring 
inequalities between two large, meaningful geographies of 
around 25 
million people each allowed us to minimise the effects 
of errors in population estimates, and more precisely to examine 
age group specific mortality. While the classification of smaller 
geographies into North or South is to some extent arbitrary, 
it reflects boundaries of administration and political responsi-
bility, as well as established social, economic and cultural divi-
sions. This dichotomous approach does not, however, allow 
us to account for heterogeneity within each region. Within the 
South for example, London concentrates political and economic 
resources. We have not examined causes of death, which limits 
the conclusions we can draw about the underlying drivers of 
the disparities, although the relative ranking of causes of death 
for different age groups is the same across all regions of the 
country.21 We also have not measured the changes over time in 
potential social, economic, behavioural and demographic deter-
minants (eg, migration, smoking rates and unemployment), as 
this was beyond the scope of the study. Finally, in our analysis 
of recessionary periods we have not examined other periods of 
economic or social insecurity.

Interpretation of findings
In common with other advanced industrial nations, mortality 
rates consistently fell across all regions of England in the 
second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 
21st. Premature mortality rates in the North steadily converged 
on—but remained substantially higher than—rates in the South 
throughout a period that included three recessions and multiple 
changes in political administration, with a total of 23 years of 
Labour and 22 years of Conservative government. However, the 
same uniform pattern of converging mortality was not apparent 
in all age groups. For the 25–34 and 35–44 age groups there 
were distinct phases: between 1965 and 1985, mortality rates fell 
more quickly (from a higher baseline) in the North, closing the 
North-South gap to 12% in the 35–44 age group and completely 
in the 25–34 age group. This was followed by a decade when the 
long-term decline in mortality rates among young adults halted 
nationwide, with little change in regional disparities. However, 
from the mid-1990s northern excess mortality increased by 25 
percentage points in the 25–34 age group and by 23 percentage 
points in the 35–44 age group. Underlying this rapid divergence 
was an increase (ages 25–34) or plateauing (ages 35–44) of 
mortality rates in the North at the same time as mortality rates 
in the South started to decline again. Because deaths in the under 
45s are relatively uncommon, these patterns are concealed in 
whole population mortality rates, which are dominated by older 
age groups. However, the consequences for the population, in 
terms of years of life lost, are grave.
Prior to the Great Recession of 2008–2009 there were no 
obvious effects of recessionary periods on either long-term 
trends in mortality or on inequalities in mortality between North 
and South, even in the working age population. For example, the 
divergence in mortality rates for young adults between North 
and South began in 1995, 4 
years after the 1990–1991 reces-
sion, and continued for another decade through a period of 
sustained economic growth. It is possible, however, that overall 
mortality figures conceal different trends for specific causes of 
death; analyses of previous economic crises found that increases 
in cardiac deaths were counterbalanced by reductions in respi-
ratory deaths.22
During the 2008–2009 recession, there was again no obvious 
change in underlying trends in mortality, but from 2012 the 
historical decline in under 75 mortality rates plateaued in both 
the North and the South. Within the under 75s, this overall 
pattern is reflected equally in North and South England for 
the 25–34 and 45–54 age groups; however, for the 35–44 age 
group the gap is widening due to a decline in mortality post-
2012 not seen in the North. It remains to be seen whether the 
overall plateauing is a transient phenomenon, or whether years 
of improving premature mortality are fading and existing wide 
regional disparities are persisting or worsening.
The extended period of austerity following the 2008–2009 
recession has raised concerns about detrimental impacts on popu-
lation health,23 particularly the health of disadvantaged socio-
economic groups and more economically precarious regions.18 
However, the divergent trends in mortality we noted in the 
1990s and early 2000s suggest that inequalities can increase 
rapidly during periods of sustained economic growth. Similar 
patterns have emerged in the USA (and have been similarly 
concealed by overall mortality patterns), where mortality rates 
in white non-Hispanic women aged 45–54 started to increase in 
the late 1990s.24
Explaining the rapidly widening divide in young adult 
mortality between North and South over the past two decades 
will require detailed analysis of specific causes of death and 
the plausible explanations, including epidemiological, social, 
economic and migratory factors. The most common causes of 
death in this age group are suicide, poisoning, land transport 
accidents and liver disease. Over the age of 40, other causes 
become increasingly common; ischaemic heart disease in men 
and breast cancer in women.21 The recent rises in mortality 
rates noted above in the USA were driven by rapid increases 
in suicide, poisonings and chronic liver disease—increases that 
were heavily concentrated in less educated populations.24 In 
the UK, suicide rates declined nationally throughout the 1990s 
and 2000s, but this general fall may have concealed different 
regional and socioeconomic trends. The rapid increase in 
suicides from 2008, and its concentration in areas of high 
unemployment, suggests that already wide health inequalities 
affecting England are worsening.18 The age-standardised rate 
for alcohol-related deaths in the UK has increased since 1994. 
Although the rate peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fallen, 
the 2014 rate is still higher than that observed in 1994.25
Some commentators on the nation’s growing inequalities 
conclude that the transition from premature mortality driven 
by infectious diseases in the Victorian era to chronic diseases 
today means that the era of effective state intervention—which 
included the great public works of sanitation, housing reform, 
immunisation and universal healthcare—is past, and that respon-
sibility for addressing current disparities now lies with the indi-
vidual.26 Following this logic, the government would do no more 
than provide education and some behavioural nudges, partic-
ularly in the case of the violent and self-destructive causes of 
premature mortality that afflict young and middle-aged adults. 
However, the strong social and geographical patterning of 
trends in premature mortality points to structural defects that 
lie beyond the control of the individual, demanding collective 
action and a strong policy response.
Future policies may be distracted from addressing inequali-
ties due to the pan-regional nature of the apparent plateau in 
declining premature mortality and the reversal of declining 
elderly mortality.27 Doing so would ignore the persistent North-
South divide and the potential population health gain from 
addressing it effectively.
conclusIons
We have identified an alarming growth in England’s North-
South divide in mortality for the population aged 25–44, amid 
a persistent inequality accounting for 1.2 
million northern excess 
deaths under age 75 over five decades. Policy responses to this 
profound, persistent health divide will reflect a variety of ideol-
ogies. Effective policies, however, may require substantial social 
and economic changes, including a rebalancing of the economy 
between North and South England that is proportionate to the 
scale of the problem.
What is already known on this subject
 
► From 1965 to 2008 the chances of dying early (age <75 
years) were a fifth higher in the North of England than the 
South, while England’s overall mortality fell by around 50% 
in men and 40% in women.
 
►
Northern excess mortality decreased from the early 80s to the 
late 90s, then increased,with a large (22%) rise among the 
20–34 years age group from 1996 to 2008.

What this study adds
 
► Since 1995, the North of England has experienced a 
profound rise in early (ages 25–44 years) premature 
mortality, relative to the South.
 
►
Between 2010 and 2015, rates of premature (age <75 years) 
mortality have plateaued in both the North and South of 
England after falling for more than four decades.
