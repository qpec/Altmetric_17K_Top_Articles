Abstract. A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are amyloid plaques in the brain consisting of aggregated
amyloid-� 42 peptide (A�42) derived from cellular amyloid-� protein precursor (A�PP). Based on successful experiments in
mouse AD models, active immunization with A�42 peptide and passive immunizations with anti-A�42 antibodies were started
in clinical trials. Active A�42 peptide immunization in humans had led to an inflammatory autoimmune response, and the trial
was stopped. Passive immunizations had shown some effects in slowing AD pathology. Active DNA A�42 immunizations
administered with the gene gun into the skin elicits a different immune response and is non-inflammatory. While in rodents,
good responses had been found for this type of immunization, positive results in larger mammals are missing. We present here
results from sixteen New Zealand White Rabbits, which underwent intradermal DNA A�42 immunization via gene gun. The
humoral immune response was analyzed from blood throughout the study, and cellular immune responses were determined
from spleens at the end of the study. A good anti-A� antibody response was found in the rabbit model. The T cell response
after re-stimulation in cell culture showed no IFN� producing cells when ELISPOT assays were analyzed from PBMC, but
low numbers of IFN� and IL-17 producing cells were found in ELISPOTS from spleens (both 5 immunizations). Brains from
immunized rabbits showed no signs of encephalitis. Based on these results, DNA A�42 immunization is highly likely to be
safe and effective to test in a possible clinical AD prevention trial in patients.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading
cause of death in the United States. With the pro-
jected increase in life expectance worldwide and no
current treatment, the social and economic burden
from this disease will potentiate in the next twenty
years [1]. Immunization against A�1-42 peptide, a

highly fibrillogenic end product, of the physiologi-
cal turnover process of amyloid-� protein precursor
(A�PP), which had shown success in AD mouse
models with removal of amyloid plaques from brain,
and benefits in learning and memory behavior tests,
had failed in a stopped clinical trial, AN1792. 6%
of patients developed a meningoencephalitis, which
had been caused by an autoimmune and inflamma-
tory T cell response. Despite the removal of amyloid
from brain in the patients, the immunizations had
not stopped the progression of dementia [2–6]. In
another study, a small effect on the percentage of
cognitive decline in positive antibody responders was
reported [7]. One of the main conclusions from this
trial was that the immunization against A�42 worked
to remove amyloid from brain, but the treatment had
been started too late, and did not reverse downstream
pathologies. Biomarkers, such as A� deposition in
brain, precede the clinical symptoms of AD by about
twenty years, and therapy to treat AD must start
before the symptoms are visible [8–10].
In the common late-onset form of AD, A�
clearance from brain is significantly reduced in com-
parison to cognitively normal controls while rates of
A� production are similar [11, 12], which supports
the concept of immunotherapy with involvement of
antibodies and cellular components such as microglia
to facilitate the clearance processes. Ongoing clin-
ical trials are concentrating on the use of passive
immunization with injection of preformed anti-A�
monoclonal antibodies to avoid a potentially inflam-
matory T cell response. With a positive outcome from
threemajorpreventiontrials,anewfocuswillconcen-
trate on active immunization again due to its higher
applicability to large and diverse populations.
DNA immunization in the skin elicits a different
type of immune response compared to the immu-
nization with peptide. The full-length DNA A�1-42
immune response produces a non-inflammatory
immune response with sufficient antibody produc-
tion, and no inflammatory IFN� and IL-17 cytokine
secretion from accompanying T cell responses
[13–17]. We have shown this previously in mouse
models, and show here the results in a large animal
model, the New Zealand White (NZW) Rabbit.
METHODS
Animals and immunizations
Sixteen four- to five-year-old NZW rabbits (ten
females, six males, 3.5 to 5 kg) were purchased from
Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The rabbits were ran-
domly separated in two groups, in which one group
received a high dose immunization regimen receiv-
ing 16 �g DNA per immunization time point and
the other group received a low dose regimen (8 �g
DNA/immunization). The intradermal DNA immu-
nizationswiththetwoplasmidDNAswereperformed
into skin of the outer ear using the Helios gene gun
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In brief, DNA coated gold
particleswereinjectedontotheskinoftheshavedears
with a helium pressure of 400 psi for a total of five
immunizations. The first three immunizations were
done in biweekly intervals, followed by two vacci-
nations in monthly intervals. Two month following
these five immunizations, nine of the rabbits were
euthanized for pathological examination and cellu-
lar immune responses. One animal had died after the
fourth immunization due to bacteremia secondary to
a tooth root abscess. Immunization was continued in
six of the rabbits for five additional time points (total
of ten immunizations). Animal experimentation was
performed in accord to the guide of the ARC at UT
Southwestern Medical Center. Animal use for this
study was approved by the UT Southwestern Med-
ical Center IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee).
The plasmid system used for DNA A�42 trimer
immunization is illustrated in Fig. 1. A dual plasmid
system, activator and responder plasmid is used for
expression of the A�1-42 trimer (3 copies of A�1-42
in a row): The activator plasmid codes for the tran-
scription factor Gal4, the responder plasmid codes for
A�1-42 trimer. Gal4 transcription factor transcription
is driven by a CMV promoter. The Gal4 protein binds
as a homodimer to UAS sites present upstream of
the promoter on the responder plasmid. Gal4 binding
drives transcription of the A�1-42 trimer sequence
containing also an Adenovirus E3 leader sequence
and an endosomal targeting sequence derived from
mouse MHC class II (H2-DM) (Fig. 1A). Expression
of A�1-42 trimer from the plasmid was verified by
analysis of mouse skin which was injected with the
plasmids via gene gun. Protein lysates from mouse
ear (24 h following DNA immunizations) were run
on a 4–20% SDS PAGE and A� protein expres-
sion was detected with an anti-human A�42 antibody
(Fig. 1B). UAS-monomer transfection (Mon, 1 copy
of A�1-42) in mouse ear resulted in a unique band at
about 10 kDa, UAS-trimer (Tri) transfection resulted
in double fragments at 19 kDa, and dimerized bands
of these doublets at about 40 kDa, respectively.

ing sequence (see Fig. 1A). The earlysate transfected
with control DNA (Gal4/UAS-Luc) showed no pro-
tein bands detectable with the A�42 antibody (Luc).
Antibodies and peptides
As a standard antibody to determine the anti-A�
IgG immune response a C-terminal A� specific rab-
bit monoclonal antibody recognizing A� peptides
ending amino acid 42 was used (clone 1-11-3, Biole-
gend). Other anti-A� antibodies used in this study
were the mouse moab 6E10 (Biolegend) and rabbit
A11 (Life Technologies). As comparison to antisera
generated in peptide immunized rabbits we pur-
chased polyclonal rabbit antisera detecting A�1-15
or A�42 from GeneTex (Irvine, CA). A panel of
secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies was used: anti-
rabbit Ig, anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech, Santa
Cruz), anti-rabbit IgM (Southern Biotech), anti-
rabbit IgA (Pierce), and three anti-rabbit IgG moabs
(Southern Biotech, SIGMA). A� peptides used in this
study had been purchased from rPeptide, AnaSpec,
New England Peptide, Bachem, and American Pep-
tideCompany.Full-lengthA�1-42 peptides(rPeptide)
were pretreated and fibrillized as described in Stine
et al. [18].
Necropsy reports and histology
Nine of the rabbits underwent necropsy and histo-
logical evaluation of target tissues by a veterinarian
pathologist.
Plasma and splenocyte collections
Blood was collected prior to the first, after the
second, third, and fourth, and two, eight, and six-
teen weeks past the fifth immunization. Antibody
levels were determined from all blood samples.
Blood chemistry and complete blood counts (CBC)
were determined from samples prior to the first,
after the fourth immunization, and from blood sam-
ples drawn eight weeks past the fifth immunization.
Ten days following the final blood draw the rab-
bits were euthanized. Lymphocytes from blood were
isolated by density separation centrifugation using
Lympholyte® Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane
Labs, Burlington, ON). Spleens and bone marrow
were aseptically removed and processed for tissue
culture. Tissue culture was performed as previously
described [10].
Antibody ELISA
Aggregated A�1-42 and �-synuclein peptides were
prepared as described previously [9]. Briefly, the
peptide solution was prepared by adding 250 �l
phosphate buffered saline (PBS pH 7.4) to 1 mg
of lyophilized A�1-42 (counterions TFA, NaOH, or
HCl) or �-synuclein, followed by an overnight incu-
bation at 37◦C.
Anti-A� antibodies in rabbit plasma are mea-
sured according to standard procedures. High binding
96-well plates were coated with human A�1-42 pep-
tide (2 �g/ml) in 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.6
overnight at 4◦C. Standard curves were included by

adding serial dilutions of the rabbit anti-A� mono-
clonal antibody 1-11-3 in PBS/1.5% BSA. Plasma
samples were diluted and added at concentrations
ranging from 1:200 to 1:5000 to measure the anti-
gen specific antibody concentrations. ELISAs were
repeated three to four times and showed an inter-
assayvariabilityof5–8%.DatafromoneELISAwere
presented.
Dot blot assays
2 �l of A� peptide solutions (0.5 �g/ � l) were
spotted in duplicates onto nitrocellulose filters and
air dried. After blocking of the membranes in TBS-
T containing 10% milk, further incubation with
the respective antibodies (mouse- anti-human A�1-6
(6E10) and rabbit- anti-human A�x-42 (1-11-3) both
1:10,000, or oligomeric A� (A11, 1:2,000) was
performed overnight at 4◦C. Rabbit plasma was
used at a dilution of 1:200. HRP labeled secondary
antibodies (anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG)
were used in dilutions of 1:50,000. Antibody bind-
ing intensities were measured with an Opti4CN
detection kit as recommended by the manufacturer
(BioRad).
ELISA and ELISPOT assays
ELISA assays for antibody levels and titers in rab-
bit plasma were performed according to standard
procedures. IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody isotypes
were analyzed. Secondary isotype antibodies used
had been cross adsorbed with rabbit IgG or IgM,
respectively (Southern Biotech). The used polyclonal
anti-rabbit IgA antibody was noted to show no cross-
reactivity with other rabbit Ig isotypes (Pierce). As
standard a monoclonal rabbit-anti-human A�42 IgG
antibody (clone 1-11-3, Biolegend) was used. For
testing of antibody avidity, a 90-min incubation step
with the chaotropic salt NaCN in different molarities
(5 M, 2 M, 1 M, 0.5 M, 0.25 M, 0.125 M, 0.006 M)
was inserted in the ELISA protocol between the pri-
mary antibody binding and the detection step (NaCN
ELISA). ELISPOT assays to determine frequencies
of cytokine secreting cells were performed accord-
ing to standard procedures (48 h), and as previously
described using commercial available antibody sets
for rabbit IFN�, IL-17, and IL-4 (Kingfisher Biotech,
Saint Paul, MN) [13, 15, 16]. For maximal T cell
stimulation, Concanavalin A (Con A) was used at a
concentration of 2.5 �g/ml.
B cell ELISPOT
MultiScreen-IP plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
were washed with 70% ethanol, rinsed three times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then
coated with 100 �l of A�42 (4 �g/ml) in PBS at
4◦C overnight. Plates were washed six times with
PBS and blocked with RPMI with 2% BSA for 2 h
at room temperature. Rested splenocytes and bone
marrow cells were plated in 200 �l of medium and
incubated 48 h at 37◦C. Plates were washed six times
in PBS with 0.25% Tween 20 (Sigma) and incubated
with100 �lof1:250HRPconjugatedgoat-anti-rabbit
IgG or goat-anti-rabbit IgA for 1 h at room tempera-
ture. The plates were again washed with PBS-T and
a final wash in PBS, and developed with 100 �l of
AEC substrate for 20 to 30 min at room temperature,
and the reaction was stopped with deionized water.
Spots were air dried and automatically counted with
an ELISPOT reader.
Analysis of cell proliferation by CFSE dilution
Cells for labeling were re-suspended in PBS and
immediately mixed with an equal volume of CFSE
diluted in PBS (1:1). The cells were incubated for
5 min at room temperature with repeated mixing
to obtain an even CFSE labeling of all cells. The
labeling was stopped by adding of an equal vol-
ume of complete RPMI medium and removal of
the solution from the cells by centrifugation. The
cells were plated in round-bottom 96-well cell cul-
ture plates at concentrations of 1 × 106 cells per well
and re-stimulated with A�42 peptide or ConA for
six days. After harvesting cells were re-suspended in
FACS buffer (PBS/1% BSA/ 0.1% NaN3) and stained
with a mouse-anti-rabbit CD4 antibody (clone clone
RTH1A, Kingfisher) followed by an APC conjugated
rat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (eBioscience). Fluo-
rescence of the cells was measured using an Accuri
C6 Flow Cytometer (Ann Arbor, MI) and analyzed
with CFlow Plus and FCS Express Version 3 software
programs.
AD mouse model brain immunohistochemistry
For plaque staining formalin fixed brain sections
were treated with 70% formic acid for antigen
retrieval. Non-specific staining was blocked by a
1-h incubation in 2% BSA/2% goat normal goat
serum/0.3%TritonX100inPBSatroomtemperature.
Tissues were then incubated with primary antibodies

(rabbit plasma, dilution 1:250) or control antibody
(McSA1(Medimabs, Canada), 1:500) overnight at
4◦C. Secondary antibody binding (goat-anti-rabbit
IgG HRP, goat-anti-mouse IgG HRP) was detected
with a 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate kit.
Sections were scanned using a NanoZoomer digi-
tal pathology system and analyzed with NDP viewer
software (Hamamatzu, Japan).
Statistics
For statistics (unpaired t test with two tailed p val-
ues, Mann-Whitney t test, column statistics), we used
GraphPad Prism version 6 for Windows (San Diego,
CA, http://www.graphpad.com). p-values of ≤ 0.05
were considered significant.
RESULTS
Blood work and general histology
Blood from the sixteen rabbits used in this study
was tested before the vaccination and following the
4th vaccination for signs of inflammation (CBC),
or signs of metabolic changes (blood chemistry).
No changes were observed (data not shown). All
nine rabbits undergoing necropsy were in good body
condition with adequate body fat stores and no appre-
ciable postmortem autolysis. No gross abnormalities
were found. Two female rabbits had small cysts in
their kidneys; these cysts in the renal cortex are not
uncommon in aged rabbits. Two other female rab-
bits had developed uterine leiomyoma, which again
is likely due to the age of these rabbits, and the fact
that they were retired breeders. Three different HE
stained brain regions were examined and showed
no sign of lymphocyte infiltration or inflammation
(Fig. 2). One female rabbit of the six remaining ani-
mals that received continued immunizations (10x)
had a mammary adenocarcinoma, which was surgi-
cally removed. This animal was euthanized later due
to the development of a tooth root abscess of the pre-
molars. The pathology report for this rabbit showed
metastasis of the adenocarcinoma to the uterus. The
brain showed no sign of inflammation. Two male rab-
bits (both seven years old) died after this study was
completed. One of them died 3 months after the last
immunization. Necropsy and histological examina-
tions showed no cause of death (undetermined). The
brain of this rabbit showed no signs of inflamma-
tion.Thesecondmalerabbitwaseuthanized4months

after the 10th immunization due to a soft tissue tumor
(basal cell carcinoma) on one of his hind legs.
Four out of 12 analyzed rabbit brains showed posi-
tive staining with Prussian Blue (one to three cortical
lesions, data not shown).
Antibody immune response in DNA Aβ42
immunized rabbits
Antibody levels and total antibody amounts were
measured for anti-A�42 antibodies of the IgG, IgA,
and IgM isotypes. In blood samples taken prior to
the first immunizations, baseline levels of anti-A�42
antibody levels were found (< 20 �g/ml plasma). An
analysis of the antibody titers found in the rabbits
after three immunizations demonstrated the devel-
opment of an anti-A�42 IgG antibody response. In
Fig. 3, the representative titers for two rabbits which
had received high dose DNA A�42 immunizations,
and two rabbits which had received the low dose

immunization are shown (Fig. 3A). Half maximal
binding was determined for rabbit 828D as 1:25,000,
1:3,200 for rabbit 831D, 1:12,800 for rabbit 833D,
and 1:1,600 and 1:5,000 for rabbit 858D. This second
increase of antibody binding to A�1-42 at higher dilu-
tions of the plasma samples is indicative of a second
antibody epitope, which becomes more accessible
at higher antibody dilutions due to antibody hinder-
ance and steric competition at lower plasma dilutions.
Similar findings were made in all of the sixteen rab-
bits. Further analyses to the epitope binding of the
anti-A�42 antibodies produced in these four rabbits
showed a strong binding to full-length A�1-42 pep-
tide, and much lesser binding to a panel of shorter
A� peptides (linear epitopes) spanning this peptide at
this early time point (Fig. 3B). Shown are the binding
pattern for the antibodies from the same rabbits for
which the antibody titer analysis is depicted, but sim-
ilar results were obtained for all sixteen animals. The
binding to the linear epitopes at this early time point
(3 immunizations) is low in rabbits 828D and 831D,
much higher in rabbit 833D, and antibodies produced
in rabbit 858D bound stronger to a mid-region A�
peptide, A�10-26 and A�17-31, than to the typical B
cell epitope of A�42, which is A�1-16 (Fig. 3B).
Antibody levels increased to mean antibody

differ-
ences were found between the low dose (8 �g

declined slightly to 246.6 ± 109.5 �g/ml (n = 15,
p = 0.461) after a resting period of two month follow-
ing the 5th immunization. The analyses of antibody
producing plasma cells in spleen from the immu-
nized rabbits confirmed that a good humoral immune
response had been elicited in the rabbit model with
the DNA vaccine. Anti-A�1-42 IgG antibody produc-
ing plasma cells were found in these cultures with

cell culture supernatant (48 h) contained an aver-
age of 0.2 �g anti-A�42 IgG antibody/ml medium
confirming the presence of A�42 specific plasma
cells in spleens of DNA A�42 immunized rabbits
(Fig. 4C).
Antibody epitopes were determined for all six-
teen rabbits following the 4th immunization. Anti-A�
antibodies of the IgG (Fig. 4D), IgA (Fig. 4E), and
IgM (Fig. 4F) isotypes bound to a wide panel of
small A� peptides including N-truncated (A�3-42,
A�4-17,A�5-17,A�6-17)andpyroglutamatemodified
A� peptides (3Pyr-A�3-42 and 11Pyr-A�11-42).
In the six rabbits, which received continued immu-
nizations in monthly intervals, antibody levels did not
increase further (Fig. 5). These six rabbits had anti-
A�42 IgG antibody levels of 247.9 ± 57.63 �g/ml
plasma after five DNA immunizations, and an
antibody level of 246.4 ± 50.29 �g/ml after ten
DNA A�42 immunizations. Following the stop of
further vaccinations, the antibody levels declined
to 162.7 ± 32.5 �g/ml after a two-month period,
and to 105 ± 37.58 �g/ml after a four-month period
(Fig. 5A). From these data, the antibody half-life was
calculated as three months (Fig. 5B).
Linear anti-Aβ B-cell epitopes are distributed
over the entire amino acid sequence Aβ1-40
For characterization of the linear anti-A� specific
B-cell epitopes, we used a panel of shorter A� pep-
tides spanning the A�1-40 sequence, A�1-16, A�6-20,
A�10-26, A�17-31, A�22-35, and A�29-40, in a direct
ELISA assay. Antibody epitopes were determined
from antibodies of 3x, 5x, and 10x immunized rab-
bits, as well as from the antibodies following the two
or four-month interval (plasma dilutions 1:400 (3x),
Fig. 3B; plasma dilutions 1:1000 (5x, 10x), Fig. 5C-
F). These data show a wide epitope binding, detecting
epitopes throughout the smaller 11–16 amino acid
long peptides spanning the entire A�1-40 sequence.

available rabbit antisera had been used in a 1:2000 dilution. B) Antibodies in plasma from DNA A�42 trimer immunized rabbits reacted with
several N-truncated and N-modified A�42 peptides, as well as �-synuclein. The two commercial available antisera from peptide immunized
rabbits reacted strong with A�1-42, and much weaker with the N-truncated or Pyroglutamated A�42 peptides, and �-synuclein. In fact, only
the antiserum generated against A�1-42 showed some weak reactivity with these peptides, the antiserum generated against A�1–15 did not.
Antibody isotypes
The rabbit humoral immune response consists of
four antibody isotypes: IgM, IgG, IgE, and IgA.
While humans and mice have four or five IgG sub-
classes respectively, there is only one IgG subclass
in the rabbit. We analyzed the binding of antibody
isotypes, IgM, IgG, and IgA to full-length A�1-42,
N-truncated (A�4-42, A�5-42) and Pyroglutamated
A� peptides (3PyrA�3-42 and 11PyrA�11-42) in DNA
A�42 immunized rabbits (Fig. 6A). Commercially
available rabbit antisera against A�1-15 and A�1-42
showed similar binding of antibody isotypes indica-
tive that the rabbit produces all three isotypes in an
immune response (data not shown). The binding to
A�4-42 or A�5-42 and 3PyrA�3-42 contained mainly
IgG and IgM antibodies and significantly less IgA
antibodies (p values of 0.0317, 0.022, 0.022, Mann-
Whitney). In Fig. 6B, the results for IgG antibody
binding to A�1-42, A�4-42, A�5-42, and 3PyrA�3-42
from six rabbits are shown. When the rabbit sera were
tested against a different brain antigen, �-synuclein,
they displayed the same binding pattern: strong bind-
ing of IgG and IgM antibody isotypes and significant
less binding of antibodies with the IgA isotype. From
the two commercially available antisera (anti-human
A�1–15 and anti-human A�1-42), only the serum
with A�1-42 specificity contained some IgG anti-
bodies binding to A�4-42, A�5-42, 3PyrA�3-42, and
�-synuclein (Fig. 6B).
Since there is only one IgG antibody isotype in
the rabbit and a lack of information about additional
biological features of the antibodies (differences in
complement binding or Fc receptor binding), it is not
possible to classify the immune response based on
isotyping data in this species.
Dot blot assay and avidity ELISA
For further specification of the antibody binding to
A�, a dot blot assay was performed. Peptides were
spotted on nitrocellulose membranes and probed with
the commercially available antibodies 6E10, 1-11-3,
and A11, or the different sera from rabbits immu-
nized in this study. As shown in Fig. 7A, the 6E10
antibody (A�1-16) bound well to A�1-42 and A�1-40,
while 1-11-3 bound to A�1-42, and not to A�1-40
consistent with the epitope specificity of this anti-
bodyintheC-terminalendoftheA�1-42 peptide.A11
bound weakly to A�1-42/HFIP and A�1-40 indicative
of some degree of oligomeric A� conformers in these
preparations. Antibodies in the six rabbit plasma sam-
ples bound well to A�1-42 and A�1-40. Also, all six
rabbit plasma samples bound to �-synuclein with the
highest intensity found for rabbit 858D, and did not
bind to amylin, another amyloid peptide.
In an ELISA protocol using different molarities of
the chaotropic salt NaCN to test for antibody bind-
ing avidities, the antigen binding specificities seen in
the dot blot were confirmed (plasma dilutions 1:500,
Fig. 7B). All rabbit plasma samples bound with high
avidity to A�1-42 and the deletion mutant of A�1-42
lacking residue 22 (�22 A�1-42, not shown in the
dot blot). Avidity of binding for the rabbit antibod-
ies was compared to the control antibodies 6E10 and
1-11-3. High avidity to �22 A�1-42 was found for
moab 11-3-1, the rabbit plasma antibodies bound to
�22 A�1-42 with similar strength as moab 6E10.

Fig. 7. Comparison of the antibody binding of plasma from six rabbits with the commercial anti-A�42 antibodies, 6E10 and 1-11-3, and
the anti-oligomer antibody A11 in a dot-blot assay (A) and NaCN Affinity ELISA (B). A) Nitrocellulose filters contained duplicate spots
of the peptides indicated on the bottom of the filters (1–4). Filters were incubated with the different rabbit plasma samples or monoclonal
antibodies as noted above of each of the membranes. Rabbit plasma was used in a 1:200 dilution, the moabs 6E10 and 1-11-3 had been used
in a 1:5.000 dilution, A11 was used in a 1:2.000 dilution. B) Avidity of the antibody binding was studied using the chaotrophic salt NaCN in
different concentrations. A comparison of binding of the rabbit plasma samples and moabs 6E10 and 1-11-3 to A�1-42, �22A�1-42, A�1-40,
and �-synuclein is shown. Rabbit plasma samples (0.2 mg/ml) were used in a dilution 1:500; 6E10 and 1-11-3 (1 mg/ml) were used in a
dilution 1:5.000. Samples were tested in triplicates, mean values are shown.
Highest A�1-40 binding was detected for the moab
6E10 with a substantial decrease of binding at NaCN
concentration of 0.5 M. No binding was found for
moab 1-11-3 consistent with the specificity of the
antibody for A� peptides ending in residue A�42. The
six rabbit plasma samples showed an intermediate
avidity to A�1-40 with loss of binding at NaCN con-
centrations at 0.5 M, except plasma antibodies from
828D which showed loss of binding at 1 M NaCN.
No binding to �-synuclein was found for moabs 6E10
and 1-11-3. The six rabbit plasma samples tested in
this assay showed similar avidities in binding to �-
synuclein with loss of binding at salt concentrations
of 0.5 M NaCN. Plasma antibodies of 858D, which
showed a strong signal in the dot blot assay (Fig. 6A),
also showed the strongest binding to �-synuclein in
the NaCN ELISA; binding was clearly detectable at
concentrations up to 1 M NaCN (Fig. 7B).
Cross-reactivity of rabbit plasma samples with
α-synuclein
The �-synuclein binding was further evaluated in
a series of ELISA assays. Plasma samples from 15
DNA A�42 immunized rabbits were tested after the
5th immunization time point for binding to A�1-42,

Fig. 8. Cross-reactivity of antibodies in plasma of DNA A�42 immunized rabbits with �-synuclein. A) The plasma samples from fifteen
rabbits from the 5th immunization time point were tested for binding to a variety of amyloid [amylin, islet amyloid protein (IAPP), serum
amyloid P component (SAP)] and �-synuclein peptides (1–140, �61–95, and 1–60). Plasma was diluted 1:500 for these assays. No significant
differences were found for the comparison of binding to A�1-42 and the �-synuclein peptides, whereas significantly less binding was found
for amylin, IAPP, and SAP (Mann-Whitney p < 0.0001). B) The six rabbits which received continued immunizations were extracted from
the 15 samples in A and shown again in B for a better comparison to C. Levels of significance dropped due to the smaller sample size, but
were still highly significant in the comparison of binding to A�1-42 with binding to amylin or SAP (Mann-Whitney p = 0.0043 and 0.0173).

which has been described as highly oligomeric [19]
(plasma dilution 1:500, Fig. 8A), High binding was

Analyses of T cell responses in the immunized
rabbits
IFN� secretion was determined by an ELISPOT
assayforalloftherabbits(n = 15)oneweekfollowing
the 5th immunization from peripheral blood lympho-
cytes. No IFN� secreting cells were detected after
A�42 peptide re-stimulation while high numbers of
IFN� spots were found in wells which had been stim-
ulated with ConA (data not shown). Further T cell
responses were determined from splenocytes in eight
of the rabbits four months following the fifth DNA
A�1-42 immunization by ELISPOT assays for IFN�,
IL-17, and IL-4 (Fig. 9) and a CFSE proliferation
assay (Figs. 10 and 11).
The analyzed rabbits showed high variability in
the cellular assays between the individual animals,
which was expected since the cohort consisted of

showed low numbers of IFN� secreting cells but with
significant differences in response to A�42 peptide re-
stimulation in three of the eight rabbits (831D, 835D,
and 855D). The IL-17 ELISPOT showed increased
numbers of IL-17 secreting cells in all eight rab-
bits analyzed, and again for three of the rabbits
significantly increased numbers of IL-17 secreting
cellswerepresentuponpeptidere-stimulation(830D,
833D, and 836D). IFN� and IL-17 producing cells
were not overlapping as they were found in different
animals. No significant differences between medium
controls and A�42 peptide re-stimulated splenocyte
cultures were found in regard to IL-4 secreting cells.
In the CFSE proliferation assay, high background
levels with unspecific proliferation in medium con-
trol wells was found for rabbits 830D, 835D, and

855D. Two rabbits, 833D and 835D, showed signifi-
cantly increased levels of CD4 T cell proliferation in
response to the A�42 peptide re-stimulation in vitro,
which increased from 17% in medium to 25% in
A�42 peptide containing medium, or 8% to 22% in
the second rabbit, respectively. The remaining three
rabbits, 829D, 831D, and 836D showed no signifi-
cant increase in T cell proliferation following A�42
peptide re-stimulation (Fig. 10). Representative his-
tograms for the CFSE proliferation are shown in
Fig. 11A-G. Figure 11A shows the gating (gate R1)
on proliferating of CD4+ T cells following A�42 pep-
tide re-stimulation of splenocytes in culture of rabbit
833D, which possessed 28.7% of proliferating CD4
T cells (Figs. 10, 11A, and 11B). Further analyses
of these cells with the FCS Express Version 3 soft-
ware program (shown in Fig. 11C, D), indicated that
the clouds of cells seen in Fig. 10A are likely only
noise, which do not form separated peaks of dividing
cells, which is shown for the CD4 T cell populations
following ConA stimulation in Fig. 11G. Only one
clear peak for the undivided cells is seen (grey peak
in Fig. 10C, D). In Fig. 11E-G, the same analyses
were performed for a different rabbit, 831D, which
showed no CD4 proliferation in Fig. 10. Also for this
rabbit only one peak for the undivided cells can be
found (Fig. 11E medium control, Fig. 11F A�42 pep-
tide re-stimulation), but the histogram from the ConA
stimulated splenocytes of this rabbit formed five
clearly separated peaks of dividing cells (black) and
one small peak of undivided cells (grey, Fig. 11G).
Similar findings of background noise and no clearly
dividing cell populations were made in the detailed
proliferation analysis of the other six rabbits (data
not shown). All rabbits showed high levels of CD4
T cell proliferation in response to ConA stimulation
(positive control).
Anti-Aβ42 antibodies from immunized rabbits

The staining of brain sections from a 3xTg-

mouse
(B6;129-Psen1tm1Mpm
Tg(APPSwe,

bits, which had received DNA A�42 immunizations,
showed clear staining in the typical areas in which
amyloid plaques are present in this AD mouse model,
frontal cortex and subiculum of the hippocampus
(hippocampus shown in Fig. 12A). In the compar-
ison to a commercial anti-A�42 antibody (McSA1,
shown in Fig. 12B), we found a substantial overlap
of detected amyloid plaques in the areas stained with
both antibodies (indicated with blue and green aster-
isks). In addition to the overlapping areas, unique
staining pattern can be identified for both of the anti-
bodies as well. Brain sections from this 3xTg-AD
mouse showed no staining with control plasma from
a non-immunized rabbit (Fig. 12C). No staining was
foundinplaquefreeareasasshownforthecerebellum
(Fig. 12D-F).
DISCUSSION
DNA A�42 trimer immunization with a two-
plasmid system led to good antibody responses in the
rabbit model. This is an important finding, because
DNA immunization has been shown to be success-
ful in rodents, but positive results in larger animals
were missing, and had been a major drawback for
developing these approaches further for clinical use.
Furthermore, rabbits used for the DNA immunization
were aged animals (≥ 5 years old), which is impor-
tant in regard to analysis of the immune responses
in large mammals showing age-associated immune
deficiencyandimmunosenescence.Resultsdescribed
here, showing positive antibody responses but no
T cell activation, were very similar to the findings
we published for various mouse experiments (wild-
type and AD mouse models) [13–17, 20, 21]. Brains
from the immunized rabbits did not show any signs
of inflammation. Thus, DNA A�42 immunization
appears to be effective and safe in larger mammals,
and the immune response is similar to the mouse
models we analyzed previously.
The antibody levels produced in the sixteen rab-
bits reached mean values of 280 �g/ml plasma after
five immunizations. Much lower antibody concentra-
tions, 3.1–19.4 �g/ml plasma were found in a study
in which rabbits received four immunizations with
a DNA A� epitope vaccine containing three copies
of A�1–11 [22]. This group developed an optimized
vaccine with inclusion of more T helper epitopes into
the DNA construct (3A�1–11-Thep), and in a second
group of immunized rabbits receiving the optimized
vaccine, mean antibody levels reached 40–80 �g/ml
plasma. While the rabbits in our study produced IgG,
IgM, and IgA antibodies, the rabbits in the epitope
vaccine study produced only IgG antibodies, which
is likely due to the lack of T cell help during the
generation of an antigen specific immune response.

We have shown in different mouse models that
DNA A�42 trimer immunization does not lead to con-
tinued T cell responses, and in particular does not
lead to an inflammatory cellular immune response
with IFN� or IL-17 secreting cells [13–17]. T cell
stimulation in the immunized rabbits in this study
was analyzed on two levels: T cell proliferation upon
antigen stimulation in culture and cytokine secretion.
The results from these assays are divergent, which is
likely due to the fact that these rabbits were all aged
outbreed breeders (four to five years old) with under-
lying small and diverse medical problems. Three
rabbits showed no specific CD4 proliferation upon
A�42 peptide re-stimulation, which is consistent with
our findings in the mouse. Three rabbits had similar
levels of T cell proliferation in the medium controls
and A�42 peptide containing wells, and two rabbits
showed a significant increase in CD4 T cell prolifer-
ation upon A�42 peptide re-stimulation. A detailed
analysis of the proliferating cells using the FCS
express proliferation software package confirmed for
all seven rabbits, which had CD4 T cell proliferation
(8 to 16%, Fig. 9C) already in the medium control
wells, that this proliferation appears indeed like to
be unspecific proliferation (background noise), with
no specific increase in wells to which A�42 peptide
was added (Fig. 9A). Also, compared to levels of
CD4 proliferation in A�42 peptide immunized mice,
in which we find 50% CD4 proliferation [15], the
proliferation levels (22%) are rather low. These low
levels of proliferation can very well be due to Th2 or
Treg proliferation, which we had also shown before in
the mouse model [16]. Significantly increased num-
bers of IFN� and IL-17 secreting cells were found
in three of the eight rabbits, but for different ani-
mals (except one, 830D), and again non-overlapping
with the rabbits which showed increased CD4 pro-
liferation. Interestingly, rabbit 830D, which showed
IFN� and IL-17 secreting cells upon A�42 peptide
re-stimulation was one of the rabbits, which had
already high levels of CD4 T cell proliferation in the
medium controls, and can thus be considered as non-
specific proliferation. Therefore, we conclude that
IFN� and IL-17 secretion in these animals was due to

the age of the rabbits and possibly underlying medi-
cal complications, and was not due to the DNA A�42
immunization and the immune response thereof.
The humoral anti-A�42 immune response in the
rabbit is a well-established research area. Already
in the early publications, it was found that the anti-
bodies produced after immunization with fibrillar
A�42 peptide bound approximately 1000-fold more
tightly to fibrillar A�1-42 than to the linear shorter
A� peptides [23]. Following immunization of rab-
bits with a morphologically homogeneous population
of A�42 fibrils, it was found that rabbits produced
conformation dependent antibodies recognizing dis-
tinct assembly states of amyloids, such as prefibrillar
oligomers and fibrils. One of the well characterized
anti-oligomer antibodies, clone A11, was derived
from one of these studies [24]. Large panels of mono-
clonal antibodies were described later and confirmed
the variability of anti-A� antibodies generated in the
rabbit detecting linear epitopes as well as several con-
formational epitopes [25, 26].
Antibodies in plasma from DNA A�42 immunized
rabbits stained plaques in brain of 3xTg-AD mice. A
common problem with polyclonal antisera is that they
contain in addition to the specific antibodies large
amounts of unspecific antibodies, which can result
in high background noise. To reduce the background
staining, we used a rather high dilution of the rab-
bit samples in exchange of losing probably some of
the positive staining due to the low concentrations
of specific antibody. Our analyses in staining of A�
in brain of an AD mouse model, 3xTg-AD, with the
polyclonal rabbit anti-A�42 antisera derived from the
DNA A�42 immunizations, showed specific staining
in areas in which amyloid plaques can be typically
found in this mouse model (Fig. 12). The staining was
not as strong as the control anti-A�42 moab McSA1,
but this is also not surprising considering the reasons
why polyclonal antibody staining can be problem-
atic (see above in this paragraph). The staining was
highly specific as no stain was found in plaque free
areas.
As shown in the dot blot analyses, Avidity ELISA
(Fig. 8), and testing of cross-reactivity (Fig. 9), the
rabbit plasma samples bound to fibrillized A�1-42
peptides, A�1-40 peptide, and bound strongly also
to aggregated �-synuclein, a peptide, which has no
sequence homology to A�1-42 peptide, and the two
shorter �-synuclein peptides, �61–95 �-synuclein
and 1–60 �-synuclein. The antibody response to �-
synuclein is a new and potentially important finding
as �-synuclein also accumulates in the brain of AD
patients with some regularity, and thus the immune
response may have additional potential to reduce
�-synuclein levels as well [27]. It also might indi-
cate that the antibodies generated after DNA A�42
trimer immunization contain at least in part anti-
bodies which detect conformational epitopes or A�
oligomers [28].
Conclusions
Positive results for antibody production after DNA
gene gun immunization in large mammals has been
missing, and the data presented here show that DNA
A�42 immunization induced a good humoral immune
response in aged NZW rabbits, which possess the
same A�1-42 sequence as humans. The rabbit skin
at the injection site showed no signs of inflamma-
tion or irritation in any of the vaccinated animals,
and because the rabbit skin is an optimal target to
test chemical agents for irritation, it is highly likely
that human skin will show the same results following
DNA gene gun vaccinations. Brains from the ana-
lyzed rabbits showed no sign of inflammation. The
humoral immune response was polyclonal and mul-
tivalent; detecting N-terminal truncated A� peptides
as well as several mid-region A� peptides very simi-
lar to our findings in the mouse [29]. Full-length DNA
A�42 vaccination into the skin is likely to induce a
good humoral immune response in humans as well.
