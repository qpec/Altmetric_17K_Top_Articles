Background
There is growing interest in linking vitamin D deficiency with
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The association between
vitamin D deficiency during gestation, a critical period in
neurodevelopment, and ASD is not well understood.
Aims
To determine the association between gestational vitamin D
status and ASD.
Method
Based on a birth cohort (n=4334), we examined the association
between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), assessed from both
maternal mid-gestation sera and neonatal sera, and ASD
(defined by clinical records; n=68 cases).
Results
Individuals in the 25OHD-deficient group at mid-gestation had
more than twofold increased risk of ASD (odds ratio (OR)=2.42,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 5.07, P=0.03) compared
with the sufficient group. The findings persisted in analyses
including children of European ethnicity only.
Conclusions
Mid-gestational vitamin D deficiency was associated with an
increased risk of ASD. Because gestational vitamin D deficiency is
readily preventable with safe, inexpensive and readily available
supplementation, this risk factor warrants closer scrutiny.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of
neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by repetitive or stereo-
typed behaviours, and deficits in social relationships. In recent years,
we have learnt a good deal about the genetics of ASD.1 Similarly, our
knowledge of the non-genetic risk factors associated with ASD has
been refined2 – candidate prenatal and early life exposures include
infection, obstetric complications, and nutritional and toxin-related
exposures. Within the domain of nutritional exposures, there is
growing interest in the possible links between gestational vitamin D
deficiency and an increased risk of ASD.3–6 This research has been
inspired by birth cohort studies, which have provided evidence
that prenatal vitamin D deficiency (as assessed in maternal sera) is
associated with a range of later brain-related outcomes including
impaired language development7,8 and cognitive development in
offspring.9,10 Although several studies have reported that vitamin D
deficiency or insufficiency is more common in children with ASD
compared with controls,11 few studies addressed the specific hypoth-
esis that vitamin D deficiency during gestation, a crucial time point
in neurodevelopment, is related to the risk of subsequent ASD. One
study compared neonatal vitamin D status in children with ASD
v. their unaffected siblings (n=58 sibling pairs). This study
reported lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in
neonatal samples from the ASD cases compared with their unaffec‐
ted siblings.6 Recently, a Chinese ASD case–control study (n=68 cases)
compared first trimester (11–13 weeks) maternal 25OHD concentra-
tions and reported significantly lower concentrations of 25OHD in the
ASD cases compared with their gender- and age-matched controls.12
We recently reported an association between developmental
vitamin D deficiency and a measure of social impairment within
the autism spectrum, based on a large Dutch birth cohort.13 In
this study, vitamin D was measured at two occasions: at mid-
gestation and at birth. Mid-gestation samples were collected from
maternal sera and neonatal sera collected from cord blood. Autistic
traits were based on parental ratings of the Social Responsiveness
Scale (SRS), which quantifies behavioural features related to cogni‐
tion, social communication and autistic mannerisms.14 Compared
with individuals who were vitamin D sufficient (25OHD concentra-
tions >50 nmol/L), those who were deficient (25OHD <25 nmol/L)
had significantly higher (more impaired) SRS scores.
We had the opportunity to explore the association between
developmental vitamin D status and risk of ASD, based on the
same Dutch birth cohort in which we previously reported an
association between low mid-gestational and neonatal vitamin D
concentrations and autistic traits.13 Within the cohort, we had
access to an extensive set of potential confounding variables
as well as the children’s individual-level genome-wide genotype
data. These data allowed us to precisely adjust our analyses for
important confounding factors including ethnic background and
genetic relatedness within the cohort. We predicted that, com-
pared with individuals with sufficient concentrations of 25OHD,
those who were 25OHD deficient (defined as <25 nmol/L) would
be at increased risk of clinical ASD.
Method
The cohort
This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-
based prospective cohort from fetal life onward, based in
Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The design and cohort of Generation
R is extensively described elsewhere.15,16 Briefly, the study is designed
to identify environmental and genetic correlates of normal and
abnormal health-related outcomes in mothers and their children.
A total of 9778 mothers were enrolled in the study, of whom
8878 (91%) were enrolled during pregnancy. Delivery dates of
the pregnant women were between April 2002 and January 2006.
Baseline response was 61% and follow-up rates in children until
the age of 6 years exceeded 80%. Relevant to this study,

 Generation R is a multi-ethnic cohort, with the Dutch comprising
roughly half of the sample. The ethnic background of the children
was defined by the parents’ country of birth and further classified
using definitions from Statistics Netherland.17 If both parents
were born abroad, the country of birth of the mother was used to
define the child’s ethnicity. The main non-Dutch ethnic groups
were Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan and Cape Verdean, which
together accounted for almost 30% of the cohort. Written informed
consent was obtained from the mothers, and the study was
approved by the institutional review board of the Erasmus Medical
Centre.
Vitamin D status: 25-hydroxyvitamin D
Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring 25OHD.18 Samples
were quantified using isotope dilution liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical system consisted of
a Shimadzu Nexera UPLC coupled to an AbSciex 5500 QTRAP
equipped
with
an
atmospheric-pressure
chemical
ionisation
source. Assay accuracy was assessed using certified reference
materials purchased from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST SRM 972a Levels 1–4). Samples were analysed
at the Queensland Brain Institute in Brisbane, Australia, between
July 2013 and August 2014. Further details of the assay methodology
and a thorough analysis of the prevalence and sociodemographic
correlates of 25OHD concentrations in the Generation R cohort have
been described elsewhere.19 25OHD concentration was defined as the
sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) and 25-hydroxyvitamin
D3 (25OHD3) species measured in serum.20 Within the total
Generation R cohort, 25OHD was measured from prenatal and
cord serum in a total of 7935 expecting mothers and their
children. The first sample was taken at mid-gestation (mean (s.d.)
gestational age 20.6 (1.2) weeks; range 18.1–24.9, n=7256). The second
sample was collected at birth, from neonatal cord blood (mean (s.d.)
gestational age 40.0 (1.5) weeks; range 27.6–43.6, n=5023).
In the current analyses, we examined three stratified levels
of 25OHD concentrations: deficient (<25 nmol/L), insufficient
(25–49.9 nmol/L) and sufficient (≥50 nmol/L). Although there is
some debate about the definition of these strata,21 there is no
debate that children with 25OHD concentrations of <25 nmol/L
have vitamin D deficiency (as defined by an increased risk of
rickets and increased parathyroid hormone). Because the fetus is
entirely dependent on the maternal supply of 25OHD, and
because of the relatively long half-life of 25OHD (approximately
2 weeks), cord blood assays serve as a proxy measure of late
gestational 25OHD status (with deficient cord levels suggesting a
25OHD-deficient environment during late gestation).22,23
ASD
The ascertainment of ASD in a general population cohort is
challenging. The Netherlands has no general medical register but
general practitioners hold all medical records, including information
on treatment and diagnoses by medical specialists (e.g. paediatricians
and child psychiatrists). A diagnosis of ASD is generally based
on clinical consensus by a specialised multidisciplinary team. The
diagnostic workup typically involves an extensive developmental
case history obtained from parents as well as teachers, based on
repeated observations of the child.
To identify ASD cases, we undertook the following steps:
(a) Children were formally screened with the SRS. The authors
of the scale recommend cut-offs for screening for ASD in
population-based settings, consistent with short-form SRS-
weighted scores of 1.078 for boys and 1.000 for girls.14
(b) Children who scored in the top 15% on the Child Behavior
Checklist-1.5–5 total score24 underwent a more specific screening
using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Children
with scores of 15 or above on the SCQ were considered
screen-positive.25
(c) The presence of psychiatric diagnoses and treatments in the
children were routinely assessed from parents at all contact
points between ages 6 and 9 years (centre visits and
questionnaires).
We obtained medical records of children who were screen-
positive on one or more criteria. To minimise false positives, only
screen-positive children for whom a diagnosis could be confirmed
by medical specialist records were considered ASD cases in this
analyses. To minimise false negatives, we relied on multiple sources
of information to select the children for medical record retrieval to
ascertain ASD.
Within the cohort of children for whom at least one 25OHD
assay was available (i.e. at mid-gestation or time of birth), there were
(a) 68 screen-positive children on the SRS, of which 23 children
with ASD were confirmed with medical records; (b) an additional
20 children were identified screen-positive through the SCQ, of
which 6 children with ASD were confirmed with medical records;
and (c) an additional 74 children were considered screen-positive
based on maternal report, of which 39 children with ASD were
confirmed with medical records. In total, these procedures identified
68 children with ASD, within our total sample of 4334 children.
The observed prevalence of ASD in the cohort was 1.6%, which is
consistent with the estimated prevalence in high-income countries
(1.4%).26 To maximise statistical power, children in the cohort who
did not meet the screening criteria or children for whom ASD
diagnosis was not confirmed were all treated as controls in the
downstream analyses.
Ancestry information and genetic relatedness derived
from observed common genetic variants
Ethnicity is strongly associated with vitamin D status (darker
skinned individuals are more prone to vitamin D deficiency and
insufficiency).19 Genome-wide genotype data for the children
allow us to build models that are better able to account for
variation in ethnic background (compared with register-based or
self-ascribed ethnicity) and for genetic relatedness between cohort
members that may inflate an association statistic when genes affect
the exposure or outcome variable. DNA was extracted from blood
collected from the umbilical cord, or if this was not available, from
a blood sample that was obtained by venepuncture during the
child’s visit to the research centre at a mean age of 6 years.
Genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanHap 610 or 660
Quad chips, depending on collection time, following manufacturer
protocols. A detailed description of the genotyping and quality
control of the Generation R cohort is described elsewhere.27
Analyses involving genome-wide genotype data in this study
were based on 3234 individuals on 518 245 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs).
Imputation of missing data
The sample sizes vary between analyses depending on the avail-
ability of mid-gestational and cord 25OHD concentrations, offspring
genotype information and inclusion criteria related to ethnic back-
ground of the children. Note that twin pregnancies and mothers
with no follow-up after birth were removed before analyses (see
Supplementary Figure 1).
To optimise the sample size (number of ASD cases in our
population-based cohort study is small, as expected for a disorder
with a low life-time prevalence), we imputed a range of parental
and offspring variables that were included as covariates in
the models. Imputation was performed using the ‘Mix’ imputation
Vinkhuyzen et al
86
 package in R.28 ‘Mix’ uses an iterative multiple regression algorithm
which is expectation–maximisation (EM) based and imputes mixed
continuous and categorical data under the general location model.
Imputation expectancies were based on covariates only and were
independent of predictor variables (25OHD concentrations) and
outcome variable (ASD status). Four out of eight variables had
missing data with missing proportions ranging from 3% (‘Educa-
tional level of the mother’) to 10% (‘Mother smoking during
pregnancy’). We held a conservative approach to imputation of
missing variables, as such, we did not impute ethnic background of
the child and neither did we impute exposure and outcome variables
in the study.
Statistical analyses
To estimate the effect of vitamin D deficiency on ASD, variations
of linear models were fitted to the data. The choice of model
depended on the distribution of close relatives in the sample and
the method that was applied to control for population structure.
Main analyses
Logistic regression analyses were applied to test the effect of
vitamin D deficiency status on ASD. To remove the effect of family
relatedness in the sample, we removed one of each pair of siblings,
prioritising siblings with valid vitamin D measurements from both
mid-gestation and cord serum to maximise sample size. Because
maximum likelihood estimates are often prone to small sample
bias, we applied the Firth correction to our ASD analyses using
the ‘logistf’ package in R.29 The Firth correction uses a penalised
likelihood estimation method to handle complete or quasi-complete
separation in the data.
We compared full models in which we included the vitamin D
predictor and parental and offspring demographic variables with
nested models that did not include the vitamin D predictor.
Parental variables included maternal and paternal age, maternal
body mass index (BMI, measured mid-gestation), smoking status
of the mother during pregnancy and educational level of the
mother. Offspring variables included ethnicity of the child,
gestational age at birth, birth weight and gender of the child.
Significance of the vitamin D predictor was tested by comparing
the fit of the full model with the fit of the reduced model, thereby
considering that the penalty that is involved in the Firth correc‐
tion is the same for the full and the nested model to make the two
models directly comparable.
We fitted four full and reduced (nested) models to test the
effect of deficient v. sufficient and insufficient v. sufficient at
mid-gestation or cord. Subsequently, we estimated the population
attributable fraction associated with the mid-gestation 25OHD
status (assuming that the entire population could be moved into
the 25OHD sufficient group), using Equation 10 of Bruzzi and
colleagues.30

Sensitivity analyses
In addition to the main analyses, we undertook three series of
sensitivity analyses.
First, we analysed only offspring with European ethnic back-
ground (based on the reported parental country of birth). The
models fitted to these data were the same as the models in the
main analyses, with the exception that the self-report ethnicity
variable was not included as a covariate.
Second, because the exposure variable in this study (25OHD
concentration) is highly associated with skin colour and thus with
ethnic background,19 we aimed to fit a model in which potential
confounding effects related to ethnic differences between indivi-
duals were accounted for accurately. To this end, we fitted a mixed
linear model in which we replaced the ethnicity covariate with a
genetic component (i.e. genome-wide genetic relationship matrix)
that very precisely captures both population stratification and
genetic relatedness and consequently allows a test for association
that is free from confounding because of sample structure. A
detailed description including a simplified worked example of this
method is described in our previous work.13 Only children for
whom individual-level genome-wide genotype data were available
were included in these analyses.
Third, we fitted a model on the full sample replacing the
categorical vitamin D predictor with a continuous measure of
vitamin D and tested the association between 25OHD and ASD.
These models included all the covariates that were also included
in the main analyses.
Results
Supplementary Figure 1 depicts a flow chart of the inclusion of
participants in this study. In total, 4334 children and their mothers
were available with measures of vitamin D concentrations drawn
from maternal blood at mid-gestation or drawn from cord blood
at time of birth as well as data on the SRS and ASD status. Of
these children, 3234 had individual-level genotype data available.
Supplementary Table 1 provides an overview of the distributions of
parental and offspring demographic variables in the study sample
before and after imputation of missing covariates.
On average, 25OHD concentrations from cord blood were lower
compared with concentrations at mid-gestation (mean 25OHD
concentration in maternal serum at mid-gestation: 58.6 nmol/L;
mean 25OHD concentration in cord blood: 35.9 nmol/L; t=35.8,
P<001). The observed correlation between mid-gestation and cord
samples was 0.50 (t=28.7, P<001).
Table 1 summarises the prevalence of 25OHD deficiency in
mid-gestation and cord blood stratified by ASD diagnosis. The
proportions of cases and controls with developmental 25OHD
deficiency were substantial for both mid-gestation samples and
cord samples with higher proportions for ASD cases of mid-
gestation samples but not in cord samples.
Vitamin D and ASD
For the main analysis, we observed that compared with individuals
with sufficient concentrations of 25OHD at mid-gestation, those
that were deficient had a more than twofold increased risk of ASD
(odds ratio (OR)=2.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–5.07;
P=0.03) (Table 2). None of the other comparisons were significant.

Gestational vitamin D deficiency and autism
 Based on the main analysis, the population attributable risk for the
comparisons related to mid-gestation 25OHD was 10.8%.
Sensitivity analyses
In the analyses restricted to offspring with European ethnicity,
we observed that the pattern of findings persisted. Comparing
individuals with deficient levels at mid-gestation with those with
sufficient levels, we estimated an OR of 2.42 (95% CI 1.21–6.43;
P=0.02) (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, when we replaced
ethnicity with the genetic component that captures both popula-
tion stratification and family relatedness, the pattern of findings
identified in the main analyses remained significant, assuring that
the observed association is free from confounding with ethnicity.
OR for the mid-gestation deficient v. sufficient comparison was
2.19 (95% CI 1.42–3.38; P=0.01) (Supplementary Table 3). When
we treated 25OHD concentrations as a continuous variable,
the association between 25OHD and ASD status was no longer
statistically significant (OR=0.99, 95% CI 0.98–1.00, P=0.11)
(Supplementary Table 4).
Discussion
Based on a sample of 4334 children and their mothers, of whom
68 children were diagnosed with ASD, we show that gestational
25OHD deficiency is associated with a higher risk of being
diagnosed with ASD. This finding is restricted to mid-gestation
25OHD status – in our sample we do not find evidence that cord
blood 25OHD status is associated with ASD. In light of the robust
findings linking developmental 25OHD concentrations (i.e. both
mid-gestation and neonatal 25OHD concentrations) with autistic
traits as measured with the SRS in this same population,13 this may
reflect a lack of power for the current ASD comparisons based on
cord blood samples. The number of cases with ASD in the analysis
of cord blood was 46 of whom 30% were 25OHD deficient at time
of birth, compared with 36% of the non-ASD children. Confidence
intervals around the estimates are fairly large implying that
substantial effect sizes are required to reach statistical significance.
The association between 25OHD deficiency at mid-gestation
and ASD was significant and the pattern of findings persisted when
we restricted the analyses to the offspring of European ethnicity,
and when we thoroughly accounted for ethnic variation and family
relatedness using genetic data. These robust sensitivity analyses
strongly reduce the chance that our findings were confounded by
ethnic diversity and genetic differences in the sample.
Our results add to earlier findings from two previous studies
that reported an association between 25OHD deficiency (obtained
from neonatal dried blood spots) and 25OHD deficiency in first
trimester maternal sera, with increased risk of ASD.6,12 Of interest, a
Swedish study examined the risk of ASD in the offspring of women
with a lifetime diagnosis of 25OHD deficiency (v. women without this
diagnosis).31 Although this study was not able to address the specific
timing of this exposure (e.g. during the gestation of the index
offspring), a robust association was reported between lifetime 25OHD
deficiency and autism associated with intellectual disability.
Our study, based on a large, population-based, multi-ethnic
cohort, was well suited to test our hypotheses. The prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency was high in this cohort (17% of the mothers
had mid-gestational 25OHD concentrations <25 nmol/L). Based
on the current sample and with the standard caveats associated
with the interpretation of population attributable fraction (i.e.
assuming that the variables of interest are causally related and that
other variables remain unchanged), optimising vitamin D status of
this sample could be associated with a reduction in the prevalence
of ASD of approximately 10%.
The finding from this study lends weight to the growing body
of epidemiological and animal model-based research linking gesta-
tional vitamin D deficiency and altered brain development. ASD is
considered a neurodevelopmental disorder; abnormalities at different
developmental stages may therefore be part of the pathophysiology.
Rodent models based on transient prenatal exposure to vitamin D
deficiency have found a range of persistent molecular, neurochemical
and behavioural changes of interest to neuropsychiatry.32 A number
of studies have linked ASD with neuronal migration.33 Migration-
associated phenotypes such as changes in neuronal density and
volume, aberrant minicolumns and heterotopias have been detected
in patients with ASD.34,35 As neuronal migration starts at 6 weeks
gestation and usually ends around 24 weeks gestation, the observed
association between our mid-gestation samples, which were drawn at
~20 weeks gestation, and risk of ASD corroborates our previous
findings linking vitamin D deficiency with abnormal brain develop-
ment. Furthermore, neonatal vitamin D deficiency has been pre‐
viously associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.36 ASD
and schizophrenia are known to share genetic risk variants;37 our
findings provide additional evidence of the shared risk architecture
between these two neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, the
active form of vitamin D (1,25OHD) is known to affect the function
of voltage-gated calcium channels.38 Variants in genes coding for
subunits of these same calcium channels (e.g. CACNA1C) have been
linked to risk of both schizophrenia and ASD.39
With respect to study limitations, the sample of offspring
with ASD was small, and the diagnoses were not confirmed with
gold-standard research criteria. Additionally, we lacked resources to
systematically retrieve records of all 4334 cohort members for ASD.
However, such misclassifications would bias our study towards the
null hypothesis (i.e. no association between the variables of interest).
Although we had measures of 25OHD concentrations at two devel‐
opmental time points, we lacked information at other stages of ges‐
tation and early life. In future studies, it will be of interest to explore
the critical window during which low vitamin D may contribute to
ASD risk – it is feasible that exposure in the first few years of life may
also contribute to adverse brain outcomes. Defining the precise
critical window during which developmental vitamin D deficiency
adversely affects brain development at this stage would be premature.
This study has several important strengths. The study was
based on a large representative multi-ethnic cohort. We used a

 gold standard assessment of 25OHD concentrations and we had
access to genome-wide genotype data of the children that allowed
us to adjust for population stratification (e.g. ethnic differences)
and genetic relatedness between cohort members.
Clearly, our findings are based on a relatively small sample
of ASD cases and require replication in a larger sample. Because of
the low prevalence of ASD, case–control samples may be better
suited to explore this particular hypothesis. Findings based on
observational epidemiology remain susceptible to residual confound-
ing and thus randomised controlled trials would be required to infer
causality.
Developmental vitamin D deficiency at mid-gestation was
associated with a twofold increased risk of ASD. The association
between developmental vitamin D deficiency and ASD may have
important implications from a public health perspective. It is
feasible that a safe, inexpensive and publically acceptable vitamin D
supplementation in at-risk groups may reduce the prevalence of
this risk factor. Just as prenatal folate supplementation has reduced
the incidence of spina bifida, we speculate that prenatal vitamin D
supplementation may reduce the incidence of ASD.
