IMPORTANCE Studies have established the importance of physical activity and fitness, yet
limited data exist on the associations between objective, real-world physical activity patterns,
fitness, sleep, and cardiovascular health.
OBJECTIVES To assess the feasibility of obtaining measures of physical activity, fitness, and
sleep from smartphones and to gain insights into activity patterns associated with life
satisfaction and self-reported disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The MyHeart Counts smartphone app was made
available in March 2015, and prospective participants downloaded the free app between
March and October 2015. In this smartphone-based study of cardiovascular health,
participants recorded physical activity, filled out health questionnaires, and completed a
6-minute walk test. The app was available to download within the United States.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The feasibility of consent and data collection entirely on a
smartphone, the use of machine learning to cluster participants, and the associations
between activity patterns, life satisfaction, and self-reported disease.
RESULTS From the launch to the time of the data freeze for this study (March to October
2015), the number of individuals (self-selected) who consented to participate was 48 968,
representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Their median age was 36 years
(interquartile range, 27-50 years), and 82.2% (30 338 male, 6556 female, 10 other, and 3115
unknown) were male. In total, 40 017 (81.7% of those who consented) uploaded data.
Among those who consented, 20 345 individuals (41.5%) completed 4 of the 7 days of
motion data collection, and 4552 individuals (9.3%) completed all 7 days. Among those who
consented, 40 017 (81.7%) filled out some portion of the questionnaires, and 4990 (10.2%)
completed the 6-minute walk test, made available only at the end of 7 days. The Heart Age
Questionnaire, also available after 7 days, required entering lipid values and age 40 to 79
years (among 17 245 individuals, 43.1% of participants). Consequently, 1334 (2.7%) of those
who consented completed all fields needed to compute heart age and a 10-year risk score.
Physical activity was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.5% (8.0%) of individuals’total recorded
time. Physical activity patterns were identified by cluster analysis. A pattern of lower overall
activity but more frequent transitions between active and inactive states was associated with
equivalent self-reported cardiovascular disease as a pattern of higher overall activity with
fewer transitions. Individuals’perception of their activity and risk bore little relation to
sensor-estimated activity or calculated cardiovascular risk.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A smartphone-based study of cardiovascular health is
feasible, and improvements in participant diversity and engagement will maximize yield from
consented participants. Large-scale, real-world assessment of physical activity, fitness, and
sleep using mobile devices may be a useful addition to future population health studies.

nvestigators have established the importance of physical
activity, fitness, sleep, and diet in the maintenance of car-
diovascular health. Low fitness is a key risk factor,1,2 while
insufficient physical activity accounts for 5.3 million deaths
per year and approximately 6% of the burden of coronary heart
disease.3-5 Decrements in sleep quality through sleep frag-
mentation and obstructive sleep apnea also affect overall
mortality.6
Most of these observations, particularly with respect
to activity, have been achieved through individual efforts
of research coordinators and have required in-person
consent, interviews, exercise or sleep studies, and
follow-up.7,8 Such methods rely on accurate post hoc par-
ticipant recall. Survey-based physical activity estimation
has been shown to systematically overestimate measured
activity.9,10
Mobile technology, in particular advances in smartphone
sensors, offers a new approach to the study of cardiovascular
health and fitness.11-15 Direct measurement of activity through
always-on, low-power motion chips provides a promising al-
ternative to questionnaire-based approaches, as recognized by
large-scaleprojects,suchastheUnitedKingdomBiobank16and
the US Precision Medicine Initiative.16 Widespread owner-
ship of smartphones worldwide could thus transform global
clinical research.
In 2015, Apple Inc (Cupertino, California) introduced an
open-source framework (ResearchKit17) to facilitate clinical re-
search and standardization of data collection. Herein, we re-
port the first findings from MyHeart Counts, one of the launch
smartphone apps for the framework. MyHeart Counts is a car-
diovascular health study administered entirely via smart-
phone, incorporating direct sensor-based measurements of
physical activity and fitness, as well as questionnaire assess-
ment of sleep, lifestyle factors, risk perception, and overall
well-being.
Our objectives in this study were 2-fold. The first
objective was to establish the feasibility of mobile consent
and real-time gathering of sensor and survey data from a
large ambulatory population. The second objective was to
investigate the associations between patterns of physical
activity, fitness, and self-reported well-being or medical
history.
Methods
Data Acquisition
This study was approved by the Stanford University Institu-
tional Review Board. The MyHeart Counts smartphone app
was made available in March 2015, and prospective partici-
pants downloaded the free app from the Apple Inc app store
between March and October 2015. The written informed
consent process was developed specifically for the smart-
phone platform and incorporates unambiguous language in
a “card” format optimized for reading and understanding on
a telephone (eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
After consent, a secondary screen seeks specific permission
for sharing of each category of telephone data with
researchers. At any time, the participant can withdraw a
specific category of data or his or her entire participation
directly from the telephone.
Consented participants were able to contribute data to a
range of study components, including health surveys on
diet, well-being, risk perception, work-related and leisure-
time physical activity, sleep, and cardiovascular health
(Figure 1 and eFigures 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplement). Par-
ticipants also self-reported demographic information, such
as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. For reporting of race/
ethnicity, they were given the opportunity to select multiple
options (defined by the investigators) or none at all. During
the initial 7-day monitoring period, the participant’
s motion
was recorded through the motion coprocessor chip of the
telephone. The low-power motion chip integrates signals,
including triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and
barometer, to estimate distance, as well as the presence and
modality of movement, such as stationary, walking, run-
ning, cycling, or driving. On day 7, participants were
requested to complete a self-administered 6-minute walk
test that uses global positioning system–calibrated pedom-
eter functionality built into the motion coprocessor chip.
Reminders to complete surveys occur on a daily basis dur-
ing the initial 7-day monitoring period.
Statistical Analysis
K-means and hierarchical clustering were applied to define
groupswithcohesivepatternsofphysicalactivityfromthemo-
tion tracking data. Features for clustering included percent-
age of time spent stationary, percentage of time spent active,
number of state changes between active and stationary, and
the fraction of time spent on each activity (stationary, walk-
ing,running,cycling,driving,orunknown)(Figure2AandeFig-
ure 1A and eFigure 6 in the Supplement). Categorical compari-
son among multiple groups was performed using the χ2 test.
We tested for associations with life satisfaction using linear re-
gression models with age and sex included as covariates. For
the self-reported presence of disease, we tested the associa-
tion using logistic models with age and sex as covariates. For
both outcomes, stepwise selection of significant univariate as-
sociationswasperformedtobuildamultivariablemodel.When
Key Points
Question Can a smartphone approach enhance the study of
cardiovascular health–related behavior by taking advantage of
embedded security and sensor technology to optimize consent
and facilitate data collection?
Findings In this smartphone cardiovascular health study, physical
activity patterns were identified by cluster analysis and correlated
with life satisfaction and self-reported disease. A pattern of lower
overall activity but more frequent transitions between active and
inactive states was associated with equivalent self-reported
cardiovascular disease prevalence as a pattern of higher overall
activity with fewer transitions.
Meaning A smartphone-based study of cardiovascular health is
feasible and allows rapid, large-scale, and detailed assessment of
physical activity, fitness, and sleep.

sented to participate was 48 968 (Figure 1 and eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Participants were predominantly male (82.2%
[30 338 male, 6556 female, 10 other, and 3115 unknown]), with
a median age of 36 years (interquartile range, 27-50 years). Par-
ticipants were from all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
with the most participants from California (n = 4423) and the
fewest participants from North Dakota (n = 35). Of 23 351 re-
spondents, 6987 reported having a disease, while 3185 (of
22 457 respondents) reported taking medication (Table 1). Par-
ticipation dropped markedly during the initial 7-day monitor-
ing period, and data for some measures are contributed only
from several thousand individuals.
Quantity of Physical Activity
Among those who consented, 20 345 individuals (41.5%)
completed 4 of the 7 days of motion data collection, and
4552 individuals (9.3%) completed all 7 days. Of the 20 345
individuals whose devices recorded physical activity, 13 896
(68.3%) were estimated by their smartphones to be station-
ary for more than 50% of the time for which data were
recorded, spending a mean (SD) of 14.5% (8.0%) of their
time active (10.9% of time walking and 3.5% of time on vig-
orous activity, such as running) (Table 2). On average,
smartphones of male participants reported 3.8% more time
active than smartphones of female participants (P < .001). A
linear regression of sensor-measured active time onto age
yields P = .58 (adjusted R2<.001). The linear regression of
self-reported active time onto age yields P < .001, with a
coefficient of interaction between age and activity equal to
−0.49 (30 seconds). This result indicates no strong associa-
tions between active time and age.
Patterns of Physical Activity
K-means clusters of physical activity data are shown in
Figure 2A. Clusters of activity levels were significantly cor-
related with self-reported cardiovascular health status, as
determined by a χ2 test for the presence or absence of chest
pain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and joint pain
(Figure 2B and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Individuals in
the least active cluster were found to have an elevated risk
for all conditions listed above, with χ2 standardized residu-
als ranging from 2.5 for hypertension to 6.3 for heart dis-
ease. Conversely, individuals in the “weekend warriors”
cluster were at a significantly lower risk (standardized
residuals below −2) for chest pain, diabetes, heart disease,
and joint pain (Figure 2B and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Weekend warriors were defined as individuals who were
more active during the weekend than during the weekdays.
These individuals (Figure 2A) spent approximately 25%
more time in the “active” state during the weekend.
The second analysis focused on the number of state
changes from stationary to active and vice versa (eFigure 7 in
the Supplement). Cluster analysis suggested that, although
state changers were less active overall than weekend war-

riors, they experienced similarly better cardiovascular health
status compared with those in inactive clusters.
Fitness
In total, 4990 individuals (10.2% of consented participants)
completed the 6-minute walk test, made available only at the
end of 7 days, with a mean (SD) step count of 693 (127) steps
and a mean (SD) distance walked of 455 (520) m (Table 1). Par-
ticipants who completed the 6-minute walk test were slightly
older than the general study population (median age, 42 years
and mean age, 43.2 years) and had a higher ratio of men to
women (5.6 vs 4.6 for the entire cohort). Sensor recordings in-
dicated that the 6-minute walk test cohort was active during
a mean (SD) of 15.1% (7.1%) of their total recorded time com-
pared with a mean (SD) of 14.5% (8.0%) for the full cohort.
Sleep
Each participant self-reported the number of hours slept each
night (Table 2). Overall, 34 048 participants (69.5% of those
consented) reported a mean of 7.8 hours of sleep per night. Fe-
male respondents to the sleep survey (n = 5827) reported a
mean of 0.3 hours more sleep than male respondents
(n = 25 871) (P < .001).
We derived daily bedtimes for each participant based on
the last time of movement recorded by the motion chip. We
then compared the distributions of self-reported life satisfac-
tion ratings (on a scale of 1-10) for participants with the earli-
est bedtimes (earliest tertile) with those for participants with
the latest bedtimes (latest tertile) using the median bedtimes
for each participant (among 14 895 patients, 30.4% of those
consented). Individuals with 2 or fewer bedtimes recorded or
outliers (bedtimes before 7:30 PM or after 3:30 AM) were ex-
cluded. Participants who retired the earliest in the evening re-
ported an overall higher life satisfaction rating (mean, 7.48)
than participants who stayed awake the latest (mean, 6.80)
(P < .001) (Figure 3B). Individuals who retired the earliest
tended to be older (median, 44 years) than those who retired
the latest (median, 33 years old). A linear model adjusted for

age and sex (n = 14 179) found the median bedtime in hours to
be a significant univariate predictor of life satisfaction
(β = −0.16; 95% CI, −0.18 to −0.14; P < .001).
Models of Life Satisfaction and Self-reported Disease
In addition to associations with health conditions, activity
levels were also found to correlate with participants’life sat-
isfaction (P < .001) (Figure 2C). Individuals in the inactive
cluster reported the lowest life satisfaction (mean, 6.82),
while individuals in the most active cluster reported the
highest life satisfaction (mean, 7.48). Drivers and weekend
warriors reported mean life satisfaction values of 7.14 and
7.36, respectively.
We tested the association of life satisfaction and self-
reported disease status in our population with dietary, life-
style, and other factors. Overall life satisfaction scores clus-
tered around a mean of 7.12. Because many lifestyle predictors
are correlated, we derived a multivariable linear model using
stepwise selection on all significant univariate predictors, in-
cluding age and sex as covariates. We found that fruit con-
sumption, sugary drink intake, recorded activity, and min-
utes of self-reported vigorous activity remained significant
predictors of life satisfaction (eTable 3 in the Supplement). For
self-reported disease status, we used stepwise selection on sig-
nificant predictors to derive a multivariable logistic regres-
sion model (with age and sex as covariates) that showed fam-
ily history, whole grain consumption, and job activity as
significant predictors (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Geographic Diversity
We analyzed the pattern of behavior across the United
States (Figure 3A) with a mixed-effects model containing
3-digit zip code prefix as a random effect and US census
region as a fixed effect. Using analysis of variance, we
found significant differences between US census regions
in the measured activity levels (n = 14 406) (P < .001)
and the reported life satisfaction (n = 14 391) (P = .001).
The West had the highest mean activity proportion, while
the Midwest, South, and Northeast had lower recorded
activity levels (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Based on
16 hours of nonsleeping time a day, individuals in the
West had on average an additional hour of physical activity
each week compared with individuals in the Northeast. The
West also had the highest life satisfaction, and the North-
east had the lowest life satisfaction. The 0.2 difference in
life satisfaction is equivalent to 15% of the entire range
(6.9-8.2) seen between developed countries in previous
results.18
Perceived Activity and Actual Activity
At baseline, participants were asked to rate how active they
were on a scale of 1 to 6 on the Leisure-Time Activity Survey
(eFigure 4A in the Supplement). On the Moderate or Vigor-
ous Physical Activity Questionnaire, participants were also
asked to report the number of minutes of moderate and
vigorous physical activity that they performed in a week.
These values were compared with the total time partici-
pants spent in the walking, running, and cycling states,
as determined by the motion tracker data. Despite the large
number of participants in the study, we observed a signifi-
cant association between the perceived and reported
activity levels (P < .001), but the correlation between
the perceived and reported levels was negligibly small
(R2<.001).

Perceived Risk and Actual Risk
A participant’
s 10-year risk and lifetime risk of stroke and myo-
cardial infarction19 were calculated according to the 2013
American College of Cardiology and American Heart Associa-
tion atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease guidelines.20 Pre-
dicted risk calculations were compared with individuals’self-
reported perceptions of risk (eFigure 4B and eFigure 8 in the
Supplement).21 A Pearson product moment correlation (R2) of
0.18 was observed between individuals’perceived 10-year risk
andthecalculated10-yearrisk(Figure3C).TheHeartAgeQues-
tionnaire, available only after 7 days, required entering lipid
values and age 40 to 79 years (among 17 245 individuals, 43.1%
of participants). Of the 1334 participants who completed all
questions on the Heart Age Questionnaire, necessary to com-
puteheartageanda10-yearriskscore,512underestimatedtheir
10-year risk (mean difference, 6.0%), while 817 overesti-
mated their 10-year risk (mean difference, 1.2%). The remain-
ing5individualshadpredictionsclosetotheactualvalue.Simi-
larly, participants did poorly at predicting their lifetime risk:
a Pearson product comment correlation of 0.09 was ob-
served between individuals’perceived and calculated risk
(Figure 3D). In total, 457 participants overestimated their life-
time risk by a mean of 12.7%, while 501 participants underes-
timated their lifetime risk by a mean of 12.0%, indicating that
individuals predicted their personal risk with low accuracy.
Discussion
Seminal investigations established the importance of physi-
cal activity, fitness, sleep, and diet for cardiovascular
health.4,22,23 Such studies were completed with time-
consuming, in-person measurements with substantial reli-
ance on participant recall. Mobile technology allows an alter-
native approach to such studies,10,24-26 with major challenges
and opportunities.

Large-scale data afford approaches to analysis and in-
sights that are not available from smaller-scale data.27 Herein,
we used an unsupervised clustering approach to define cat-
egories of individuals by their physical activity patterns. Such
approaches28 allow the data, rather than prior assumptions
about the structure, to drive categorization. Despite decades
of research, there is little certainty as to the optimal pattern
of physical activity to recommend for health. Indeed, advice
from national organizations has changed significantly over
time.29 While causality requires randomization, we report
herein correlative associations not just with overall activity but
with a pattern of more frequent transition from inactive to ac-
tive states. For example, our result that participants who
changed their activity state frequently tended to be healthier
aligns with prior findings that link prolonged periods of un-
interrupted sedentary time with increased risk for metabolic
syndrome and type 2 diabetes.22,30,31 Such observations sup-
porttherandomizedassessmentofinterventionsaimedataug-
menting activity state transitions during daily living.31
A major advantage of a smartphone-based study is that
mostpeoplecarrythedevicewiththem,allowingnotonlypas-
siveregistrationofmotionbutalsoactiveassessmentofchang-
ing psychological states, such as life satisfaction and happi-
ness. A major disadvantage is the inherent ascertainment bias.
While such bias exists in all studies (eg, among the individu-
als who choose to contact a study coordinator or in the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria for a clinical trial), it is important
to minimize this bias as much as possible. Of particular note,
the bar for entry to this study was much lower than that for
equivalent studies performed using in-person visits. This low-
ering has the demonstrated advantage that many people con-
sented but has the notable disadvantage that those individu-
als are by definition less invested in the study and thus less
likely to complete all portions. For some data points in this
study, we have data for only several thousand individuals,
while almost 50 000 consented. We believe that the low bar
in fact represents an opportunity to engage this larger group
who are interested enough to download the app and answer a
fewquestionsbutnotmuchmore.Balancingengagement,data
feedback, and study design remain areas for further research.
We delayed the 6-minute walk test and heart age assessment
until completion of all other portions of the study to mini-
mize bias from this information, but that certainly contrib-
utedtothedropinparticipationinthesetasks.Aneasymethod
to link lipid values directly from one’
s electronic health rec-
ord would help. However, even in the Practice Innovation and
Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) electronic health record–
based cardiovascular registry, data to calculate the 10-year risk
score were available in less than 30% of patients.32 Future ver-
sions of MyHeart Counts will introduce more personalization
and earlier participant feedback. Elements of gamification, ex-
emplified by Pokémon Go (http://www.pokemongo.com),
could also be introduced to maximize engagement.
We found a significant disconnect between an individu-
al’
s perceived cardiovascular risk and his or her actual risk de-
rived from the 2013 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
pooled cohort equations. These findings are in line with those
reported by Mazalin Protulipac et al,33 who concluded that the
actual presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in par-
ticipants did not appear to alter their perception of risk com-
paredwithparticipantswithoutcardiovasculardiseaseriskfac-
tors. Similarly, Ko and Boo34 found that, among cardiovascular
risk factors, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, and family his-
tory of cardiovascular disease did not affect self-perceived
health. Imes and Lewis35 observed that, even when individu-
als are aware of their cardiovascular disease risk, the associa-
tionbetweenhealth-relatedbehaviorchangeandperceivedrisk
was inconsistent. For example, our results illustrate that self-
reportedminutesofmoderateorvigorousphysicalactivityand
movement recorded by the smartphone do not agree, which
suggests that participants were poor at predicting their levels
ofphysicalactivity.36Suchadisconnectbetweenperceivedand
actual levels of physical activity and cardiovascular risk high-
lights the potential usefulness of smartphones as personal-
ized informational tools to optimize healthy lifestyles. The
MyHeart Counts app provides the user with feedback in the
form of a heart age relative to ideal cardiovascular health sta-
tus, an approach to personalizing and making more visceral
the understanding of risk (eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supple-
ment). In addition, we include feedback in the form of a plot
showing where each individual falls in relation to the overall
study distribution for the 6-minute walk test distance. The
natural extension of such findings is toward tailored physical
activity and lifestyle recommendations,37 and indeed future
versions of the app will introduce randomized studies of mo-
tivational strategies for improving activity, diet, and cardio-
vascular health measures.
Limitations
Our study has several important additional limitations. The
demographics of the enrolled population reflect those of
typical smartphone users.38 For example, young male indi-
viduals are heavily overrepresented. We are testing engage-
ment strategies that target other populations. Some indi-
viduals do not carry their smartphones with them at all
times; therefore, physical activity measurements are a
lower bound for actual physical activity. While daily ques-
tions were used to try to capture activity lost in this way, a
stronger approach comes in the form of increasing users’
adoption of wearable technology.39 Furthermore, the
motion trackers cannot distinguish the cause of periods of
lack of motion. In addition, it is likely that (as in most stud-
ies of physical activity) participants may have been more
active than usual during the first weeks of the study. Conse-
quently, in a follow-up study, we will track individuals for
multiple weeks to quantify the effect of different types of
coaching strategies on modification of participant behavior.
Validation of 6-minute walk test step counts reported by the
smartphone (eFigure 9 in the Supplement) suggests that the
step count algorithm needs improvement to achieve suffi-
cient accuracy for clinical use.25 Finally, the 2013 American
College of Cardiology and American Heart Association ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk calculator has limi-
tations. Specifically, the 10-year risk score was implemented
for age 40 to 79 years and does not fully account for biogeo-
graphic ancestry and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions
Our study found 5 main results. First, we demonstrate the fea-
sibility of consenting and engaging a large population across
the United States using only smartphones. Second, we show
that large-scale data can be gathered in real time from mobile
devices, stored securely, transferred, deidentified, and shared
securely, including with participants. Third, we find that a data
set for the 6-minute walk test larger than any previously col-
lectedcouldbegeneratedinweeks.Fourth,wereportthatstate
transition patterns of activity, not just absolute activity, re-
latetothereportedpresenceofdisease.Fifth,weconcludethat
there is a poor association between perceived and recorded
physical activity, as well as perceived and formally estimated
risk. Most important, we also present the major challenges and
limitationsofmobilehealthresearch,includingtheskewedage
and sex of participants, plus the rapid drop-off in engage-
ment over time, with the resulting loss of data collection for
several measures. To realize the promise of this novel ap-
proach to population health research, participant engage-
ment needs to be optimized to maximize full participation of
those who have expressed at least enough interest to down-
load the app and consent to join the study.
