quality (that is, insomnia related symptoms) could be a 
mediator of the relation between shift work and adverse 
health effects. Although several narrative reviews have 
assessed how shift work affects sleep, very few discuss 
whether insufficient sleep could lead to impaired health.
The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the 
evidence for links between shift work, chronic health 
problems, and occupational accidents. A central theme 
concerns whether insufficient sleep is a plausible mecha-
nism of adverse health outcomes among shift workers. To 
expose the role of sleep as a pathway for chronic disease 
and accidents in shift work, we also examined the epide-
miological link between short sleep, as well as poor sleep 
quality, and the same health outcomes used in the review 
of shift work and health. Furthermore, we reviewed recent 
experimental models related to sleep loss, circadian dis-
ruption, and physiological changes indicative of future 
adverse health consequences.
Sources and selection criteria
We did a literature search to evaluate the link between 
shift work, sleep, and chronic health problems (see sup-
plement for details). We included the following health 
outcomes: coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 
diabetes, obesity (weight gain), depression, occupational 
accidents/injuries, all cause mortality, coronary heart dis-
ease mortality, and cancer mortality. The review covers 
both experimental and epidemiological studies and is

ABSTRACT
This review summarises the literature on shift work and its relation to insufficient 
sleep, chronic diseases, and accidents. It is based on 38 meta-analyses and 24 
systematic reviews, with additional narrative reviews and articles used for outlining 
possible mechanisms by which shift work may cause accidents and adverse health. 
Evidence shows that the effect of shift work on sleep mainly concerns acute sleep 
loss in connection with night shifts and early morning shifts. A link also exists 
between shift work and accidents, type 2 diabetes (relative risk range 1.09-1.40), 
weight gain, coronary heart disease (relative risk 1.23), stroke (relative risk 1.05), and 
cancer (relative risk range 1.01-1.32), although the original studies showed mixed 
results. The relations of shift work to cardiometabolic diseases and accidents mimic 
those with insufficient sleep. Laboratory studies indicate that cardiometabolic 
stress and cognitive impairments are increased by shift work, as well as by sleep 
loss. Given that the health and safety consequences of shift work and insufficient 
sleep are very similar, they are likely to share common mechanisms. However, 
additional research is needed to determine whether insufficient sleep is a causal 
pathway for the adverse health effects associated with shift work.
Introduction
The definition of shift work usually encompasses work 
time arrangements outside of conventional daytime 
hours, which includes fixed early morning, evening, 
and night work, as well as roster work and rotating three 
shift work. The term rotating three shift work implies 
that employees rotate (alternate) more or less regularly 
between a day, an evening, and a night shift. About 29% 
of workers in the United States have work time arrange-
ments outside of the normal workday of 0600-1800,1 
and many of these work nights. EU statistics from 2015 
showed that about 19% of all employees work nights at 
least once a month.2
Shift work forcefully disrupts the normal sleep-wake 
cycle, leading to short sleep and excessive fatigue.3 4 
Evidence has suggested that shift work may also affect 
long term health and safety, with several studies report-
ing elevated risks for breast cancer and coronary heart 
disease.5 The evidence is inconsistent, however, and it 
is now accepted that shift work is not a definite causal 
factor for chronic disease.6 A critical problem preventing 
progress in the field concerns a poor understanding of the 
pathways and mechanisms by which shift work may lead 
to chronic health problems.
Robust support exists for insufficient sleep causing 
adverse immunological and metabolic changes,7 caus-
ing cognitive impairments,8 9 and increasing the risk 
for chronic diseases.10 11 Thus, short sleep or poor sleep

min) is also restricted, particularly with an early start time 
(before 0600)15 or if preceded by an evening shift.17 A sys-
tematic review concluded that short recovery times (<11 
h) between shifts drastically shorten sleep duration.17 
Another characteristic of shift schedules that influences 
sleep duration is speed of rotation. Slowly rotating sched-
ules (four to seven consecutive shifts of the same type) 
gave a slightly longer sleep duration (6 h 56 min) than 
did rapidly rotating schedules (defined as one to three 
similar shifts in a row: 6 h 31 min). We found no system-
atic review on sleep duration on days off in connection 
with shift work. However, observational studies suggest 
that sleep is extended above 8 h for the first day off after 
a spell of work shifts.18
Most studies on sleep and shift work concern the acute, 
shift related, effects on sleep duration. The degree to 
which shift workers are able to sleep and recover between 
work shifts is poorly understood. A narrative review esti-
mated that the difference in sleep duration for permanent 
day workers (mean 7 h 37 min) and shift workers (7 h 23 
min to 7 h 37 min) was small when considering sleep over 
an entire shift cycle.19 The longest sleep duration over an 
entire shift cycle was found for permanent evening work-
ers (7 h 57 min). Thus, evidence supports acute sleep loss 
but not chronic sleep loss among shift workers. It is still 
possible that shift schedules with few days off, limited 
rest time between shifts, or a low frequency of evening 
shifts, may be related to chronic sleep loss.
Subjective reports often overestimate sleep duration, 
and objective assessments with polysomnography in 
shift workers are rare. Several reviews concluded that 
polysomnography recorded day sleep periods (after 
night shifts) were only about 5.0-5.5 h, and sleep periods 
before early morning shifts were 5.5-6.0 h.14 20 Notably, 
the reduced sleep duration for both these sleep periods 
involved less stage 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, 
whereas slow wave sleep was unaffected.14 Suppressed 
slow wave sleep seems to be present only when early 
awakenings are anticipated, as in the case of on-call work 
or before early morning shifts.15-22
The sleep problems reported by shift workers are usu-
ally linked to excessive sleepiness, occurring during peri-
ods with night work or early morning work or when the 
recovery time between shifts is reduced.4 When the work 
schedule related sleep/wake problems become chronic 
(that is, symptoms last for at least three months), the 
worker fulfils the criteria for “shift work sleep disorder” 
(SWD), which is a clinical circadian rhythm sleep disor-
der according to the international classification of sleep 
disorders.23
The prevalence of SWD has been estimated to be 
10-23% in rotating shift and night shift workers.4 Virtu-
ally all studies on SWD are cross sectional, but one lon-
gitudinal study in nurses found that new cases of SWD 
were more prevalent in those with more night shifts.24 
The cross sectional studies show that workers with SWD 
report more health complaints and sleepiness related 
accidents, although these studies do not permit any con-
clusions to be drawn about a cause-effect relation.4
To sum up, both subjective and objective sleep meas-
ures indicate that night work and early morning work are 
primarily based on systematic reviews and meta-anal-
yses rather than original studies. The literature search 
used three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane 
Library), with 22 February 2016 as the latest search date. 
We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses that 
contained at least one sub-analysis based on studies with 
a case-control or a prospective or randomised design, 
were published between 2006 and 2016, were written in 
English, and incorporated the above mentioned chronic 
diseases. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses pub-
lished before 2006 are rare, and the aim was to focus on 
the most recent findings. We excluded systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses limited to cross sectional studies, sim-
ulated night work, or non-working populations (such as 
adolescents), as well as those that did not adhere to the 
PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses) or QUOROM (quality of reporting of 
meta-analyses) guidelines. We found very few systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses on shift work and disturbed 
sleep, and we decided to accept also narrative reviews, 
systematic reviews that included observational studies 
using a cross sectional design, and recent articles on this 
topic. Inclusion criteria for sleep outcomes were sleep 
duration, short sleep, and disturbed sleep (or synonyms 
such as poor sleep quality and insomnia), whereas stud-
ies on sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, and hypersomnia were 
excluded. The literature review concerning mechanisms 
is primarily based on systematic reviews and meta-anal-
yses, but it also includes narrative reviews and articles 
when considering recent models and findings of poten-
tial mechanisms by which disturbed sleep may lead to 
chronic disease and accidents.
Shift work and sleep
A systematic review and meta-analysis has summarised 
the effect of shift work on habitual sleep quality in epi-
demiological studies.12 On the basis of seven prospective 
studies, the review showed a trend towards an increased 
risk for shift workers to develop chronic sleep distur-
bances, such as insomnia symptoms (risk ratio 1.16, 95% 
confidence interval 0.97 to 1.38).12 However, a systematic 
review on sleep in shift work in the offshore petroleum 
industry found that shift workers reported more sleep 
problems than did day workers.13
Subjective sleep quality in relation to specific shifts 
has been extensively studied, but we found no system-
atic review. Narrative reviews indicate a strong circadian 
effect on subjective sleep quality.14 Sleep episodes that 
end close to the circadian trough (that is, before starting 
early morning shifts) are often perceived as non-refresh-
ing, and awakening is difficult.14 Daytime sleep occur-
ring after a night shift normally has short subjective sleep 
latency with relatively few awakenings throughout the 
sleep, but it is usually terminated prematurely after four 
to six hours.15
Many studies have assessed the effects of shift work on 
sleep duration, but systematic reviews are rare. A meta-
analysis based on subjective sleep duration showed that 
daytime sleep after night work was the shortest (mean 5 h 
51 min), whereas the longest sleep occurred after evening 
shifts (8 h 2 min).16 Sleep before morning shifts (6 h 37

However, an earlier systematic review was more cau-
tious and concluded that limited evidence existed for a 
causal relation between shift work and heart disease.26 
Despite most of the studies (n=14) showing an associa-
tion between shift work and coronary heart disease, it 
was not possible to rule out biases relating to methodo-
logical problems such as inadequate confounder control, 
selection bias, and misclassification due to very crude 
measures of night work exposure.
Metabolic disorders
Considerable data exist on how shift work affects metabolic 
disorders, and two systematic reviews conclude that shift 
work increases the risk for becoming overweight or obese.27 28 
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews published in the past 
three years also conclude that shift work increases the risk for 
developing type 2 diabetes. The first meta-analysis included 
12 cohort studies with 226 652 participants and found a 
pooled adjusted odds ratio of 1.12 (95% confidence interval 
1.06 to 1.19).29 A second meta-analysis based on 10 cohort 
studies found an odds ratio of 1.15 (1.08 to 1.22) after 
adjustment for several confounders.30 These results are in 
line with a previous systematic review of cohort studies.31
Breast cancer
In 2007 the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) concluded that shift work involving night work 
and circadian disruption probably increases the risk for 
breast cancer.32 Since then, several systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses have been published on the subject. 
Three reviews concluded that insufficient or limited evi-
dence existed for an association between night shift work 
and breast cancer,33-35 whereas four reviews showed that 
particularly long exposure to night work (>20 years) was 
associated with an elevated risk for breast cancer.36-39
associated with reduced sleep and that about 20-30% 
of shift workers report insufficient sleep and excessive 
sleepiness in relation to night and early morning work.
Shift work, insufficient sleep, chronic disease, and 
occupational accidents
Shift work is associated with a wide range of health and 
safety problems. This section summarises the knowledge 
on how shift work affects health and safety related out-
comes. The table and box 1 summarise the results; the 
table also summarises the findings for short sleep dura-
tion and poor sleep quality for the same outcomes.
Cardiovascular disease
The largest systematic review and meta-analysis com-
prised 34 observational studies examining the asso-
ciation between shift work and coronary heart disease, 
including more than two million people, and concluded 
that shift work was associated with myocardial infarc-
tion (pooled relative risk 1.23, 95% confidence interval 
1.15 to 1.31) and ischaemic stroke (1.05, 1.01 to 1.09).25 
The analysis of various characteristics of shift schedules 
found that the highest risks related to night shifts (relative 
risk 1.41), whereas evening shift work was not signifi-
cantly related to coronary heart disease.25

Box 1 | Key health risks in shift work
Shift work including night work is prospectively associated 
with increased risk for:
• Sleep loss in connection with early morning and night shifts
• Occupational accidents
• Obesity/weight gain
• Type 2 diabetes
• Coronary heart disease
• Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer

Effects of short sleep
The epidemiological link between short sleep (defined 
as four to seven hours of sleep a night) and the health 
outcomes that had elevated risks with shift and night 
work showed a high correspondence. Thus, short sleep 
increased the risk for coronary heart disease,47 48 stroke,49 50 
type 2 diabetes,30 51 obesity/weight gain,52 53 and work-
place accidents.54 Short sleep was also associated with 
an elevated risk for depression and mortality.55-57 On the 
other hand, one systematic review found no association 
between short sleep duration and weight gain,58 and two 
meta-analyses found no increased risk of breast cancer.38 59
Effects of sleep quality
A significant association existed between poor sleep 
quality and occupational injuries,54 60 coronary heart 
disease,61 type 2 diabetes,30 51 depression,62 and to some 
extent all cause mortality as well as coronary disease 
mortality.63 A few of the meta-analyses examined specific 
symptoms of insomnia and found that difficulties initiat-
ing sleep were associated with type 2 diabetes, all cause 
mortality, and coronary disease mortality.51 63 Symptoms 
such as difficulty maintaining sleep and early morning 
awakening show mixed results, although a systematic 
review reported an elevated risk for type 2 diabetes with 
difficulties maintaining sleep.51 Non-restorative sleep 
has also been associated with a 17% increase in risk for 
all cause mortality.63 We found relatively few systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses on poor sleep quality, and we 
did not obtain any reviews that fulfilled our search criteria 
for the effects on stroke, cancer, or obesity/weight gain.
Summary
To conclude, moderate but not conclusive support exists 
for a link between shift work and adverse health out-
comes relating to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabe-
tes, cancer, and occupational accidents. The results also 
suggest that schedules with night work induce larger risks 
than do shift systems limited to day and evening shifts. 
Similar findings (that is, related to cardiometabolic dis-
eases and occupational accidents) have been observed 
for short sleep and poor sleep quality. The correspond-
ing significant associations between shift work and dis-
turbed sleep support the hypothesis that short sleep or 
poor sleep quality (experience of insomnia symptoms) is 
a plausible pathway for how shift work increases the risk 
for adverse health outcomes and accidents.
Mechanisms linking shift work with adverse health 
outcomes
A better understanding of the mechanisms that link shift 
work with adverse health outcomes is important so that 
better scheduling, legislation on working hours, screen-
ing for biomarkers and disorders, and countermeasures 
can be prioritised. Figure 1 illustrates a model of how cen-
tral pathways for how shift work related behaviours may 
lead to acute cognitive impairments and accidents and 
to the development of chronic disease. A comprehensive 
review of all possible mechanisms is beyond the scope of 
this article, so the focus is on mechanisms linked to shift 
work and disturbed sleep.
Some of the reviews support a dose-response rela-
tion.36-39 One estimated that each five year increment 
of night work was associated with an approximately 
3% higher risk of breast cancer. The systematic reviews 
that did not find sufficient support for an association 
between night work and breast cancer highlighted 
methodological weaknesses including the limited num-
ber of studies, the heterogeneity between the studies, 
the weak associations, and that many of the prospec-
tive studies that found an association were conducted 
among specific occupational groups such as nurses 
and flight attendants. Consequently, there is a risk that 
the results can be explained by bias, chance, or con-
founding factors.33 Several of the recent reviews also 
raise methodological problems related to the assess-
ment of exposure to night work and shift work. Thus, 
more detailed exposure data on the shift schedules are 
needed—for example, whether the shift system is rotat-
ing or involves permanent shifts, whether rotation is 
regular or irregular, and accumulated time with non-
daytime work hours.40
Other disorders
We found two reviews on night shift work and prostate 
cancer. A systematic review from 2012 identified four 
studies with mixed results.41 However, a meta-analysis 
published in 2015 based on eight studies reported a 
significantly increased risk, including a dose-response 
relation, for prostate cancer.42 The relative risk was 1.24 
(95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.46), with a 2.8% 
(0.3% to 5.4%) increase in risk for each five years’ dura-
tion of night shift work. A recent meta-analysis has also 
shown an elevated risk for colorectal cancer with night 
shift work.43 The literature search did not obtain any 
systematic review or meta-analysis on shift work and 
depression.
Mortality
Some of the recent meta-analyses on shift work and 
chronic disease have calculated pooled risk ratios for 
mortality. One found no significant association with car-
diovascular mortality (risk ratio 1.04).25 Another showed 
a small significantly increased risk for cardiovascular 
death (1.03, 1.00 to 1.05), whereas the pooled risk ratio 
was non-significant for cancer related death and all cause 
death.39
Workplace accidents
The literature search found two systematic reviews of 
workplace accidents and shift work. One of the reviews 
included three cohort studies on rotating shift work and 
permanent night work.44 The relative risks were signifi-
cantly elevated in all studies (ranging between 1.21 and 
1.36), with no difference between rotating shift work and 
permanent night work. A systematic review of night work 
and shift work in the offshore petroleum industry showed 
mixed results for accidents.13 The literature search did 
not obtain a systematic review or meta-analysis on com-
muting accidents and night work; however, a few studies 
show an elevated risk for car accidents in drives following 
night shifts.45 46

Sleeping during the day, at least when in darkness, 
can shift the circadian phase.70 A recent narrative review 
reported that shift work was linked to irregular eating, 
eating at the wrong circadian phase, and poorer quality 
of food.71 Although the total energy intake on alternat-
ing shifts seems to be similar or slightly increased during 
night shifts, support exists for shift workers eating more 
carbohydrates (related to snacking) and less fruit.71 A 
typical pattern seems to be that night workers eat sev-
eral small meals across the waking period, and hence at 
circadian phases that are not optimal for post-prandial 
responses (that is, related to impaired glucose tolerance 
and worse blood lipid profiles).72
A recent meta-analysis also concluded that long work-
ing hours (>48 hours a week) is prospectively related to 
increased use of alcohol (odds ratio 1.12) compared with 
the standard 35-40 hour work week.73 We found no meta-
analysis or systematic review, but there are some indi-
cations that shift workers report smoking more often6 74 
and engage less in physical activity.75 Caffeine is the most 
Several recent reviews concern possible mechanisms by 
which shift work may lead to adverse health outcomes.6-67 
The proposed mechanisms can be roughly divided into 
behavioural mechanisms such as altered eating hab-
its, psychosocial stress related to work-life balance, and 
physiological mechanisms such as cardiometabolic stress. 
A vital and often neglected aspect is that many workers 
tolerate shift work well, and understanding of why some 
people are more resilient to shift work than others is poor.
Behavioural mechanisms
Shift work is believed to alter several behaviours includ-
ing light exposure, eating patterns, sleep patterns, physi-
cal activity, smoking, and alcohol use, but few systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses have looked at these. When 
working nights, shift workers are exposed to more light at 
night and less daylight because they are sleeping during 
the day.68 This would presumably result in reduced mela-
tonin concentrations during the night, but field studies 
are inconclusive.69

Fig 1 |  Theoretical model of mechanisms and pathways by which shift work and shift work related behaviours increase risk for chronic diseases and accidents. 
The model proposes that shift work increases the risk for chronic diseases and accidents through behaviours that lead to circadian disruption, disturbed sleep, 
and other risk behaviours that, in turn, increase the risk for chronic diseases via well known as well as recently proposed physiological disease mechanisms. 
Importantly, many of the relations are bidirectional, and disturbed sleep, circadian disruption, and other risk behaviours interact with one another. The model does 
not cover all proposed mechanisms, and more specific models exist for specific diseases. Th2=T helper 2 cells

le 
ading to long term alterations,65 these seem to relate to 
a circadian disruption rather than an up-regulation. Even 
though insufficient evidence exists for a link between 
shift work and long term effects on stress hormones such 
as cortisol and catecholamines,6 65 experimental studies 
indicate that chronic sleep disturbances gradually sensi-
tise animals to stress responses.86
Cardiometabolic stress
Experimental studies clearly show that disturbed sleep 
impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and 
alters the energy balance,64-88 but systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses are sparse. Whereas a recent systematic 
review of 22 prospective shift work studies found strong 
support for shift work impairing glucose tolerance,28 a 
small meta-analysis of seven observational studies did 
not show impaired insulin sensitivity in short or long 
sleepers.89 Short sleep and shift work, particularly when 
someone is working nights, facilitate eating at the wrong 
circadian phase; eating at night in particular is related 
to worse blood lipids and insulin resistance.90 Recent 
experiments indicate that a simulated work week with 
restricted sleep leads to a reduction in insulin sensitiv-
ity when early breakfasts are eaten or when timing is 
shifted.84 91
Recent meta-analyses including 24 and 13 studies,92 93 
and a systematic review,94 show that short sleep duration 
is related to a higher prevalence of hypertension. Some 
support exists for links between shift work, elevated 
blood pressure, hypertension, worse blood lipid profile, 
and blood coagulation,6 71 as well as for blood lipids being 
worse in people eating more at night.65 On the other hand, 
a recent meta-analysis on shift work and metabolic risk 
factors concluded that insufficient evidence existed for 
links between shift work and blood pressure, as well as 
blood lipids.28
An important aspect concerns when the measures are 
taken, and 24 hour recordings are preferred to single 
measures. For example, shift workers do not have the 
same blood pressure dips or diurnal variations of blood 
coagulation when sleeping during the day as when sleep-
ing during the night.6
Only a few studies exist on shift work and endothelial 
function, and two large observational studies showed 
shift workers to have an increased risk for subclinical 
levels of atherosclerosis and that the effects were already 
seen in shift workers before the age of 40.95 96 In all, shift 
work and sleep disruption cause metabolic stress,28 64 
and the effects are worse when combined with circadian 
disruption.64
Altered immune functioning
Results from experimental studies on sleep and immune 
functioning are inconsistent, but some systematic pat-
terns have emerged. The only meta-analysis we found 
on sleep and inflammatory markers included 72 stud-
ies.7 The analyses, based on cross sectional field studies, 
showed that disturbed sleep and short sleep duration 
were related to increased concentrations of some inflam-
matory markers, such as C reactive protein (CRP) and 
interleukin 6, but not others, such as tumour necrosis 
widely used psychoactive drug in the world and is com-
monly used to mitigate sleepiness and improve perfor-
mance.76 Although it is often assumed that shift workers 
consume large amounts of coffee to remain alert, data on 
their coffee intake and whether they engage in particular 
strategies to improve alertness are lacking.
Psychosocial stress
Health problems with shift work may also derive from 
disruption of social rhythms.77 Working at times and 
on days that do not fit well with the worker’s social and 
family commitments can lead to a conflict between work 
and family demands, which may lead to a poor work-life 
balance. A systematic review showed that shift work neg-
atively affects work-life balance and that work-life imbal-
ance is associated with poor subjective health.77
Psychosocial work stress is also related to chronic 
disease, such as coronary heart disease.78 It has been 
suggested that shift work is associated with higher psy-
chosocial work stress, in particular lower job control,74 
and lower individual control over work times.79 Shift work 
has also been linked to lower socioeconomic class.74 80 
Hence, the health risks associated with shift work may 
be partly mediated by elevated psychosocial stress from 
both work and private life.
Physiological mechanisms
Several physiological mechanisms are hypothesised to 
link shift work with accidents and adverse health. The 
most acknowledged and recently proposed links are 
reviewed below and are also illustrated in figure 1.
Circadian disruption
Most regulatory hormones show strong diurnal rhythms. 
Some are largely regulated by sleep (for example, testos-
terone, growth hormone, and prolactin), whereas others 
are mainly under circadian influence (such as cortisol and 
melatonin) or affected by food intake and fasting (such as 
insulin).81 82 Some hormones are also directly influenced 
by light (melatonin), and others are coordinated by both 
sleep and the circadian system (for example, thyrotrophin 
and to some extent cortisol). Experimental studies clearly 
show that the altered sleep timing, food timing, and light 
exposure typical for shift workers lead to an acute cir-
cadian disruption (or misalignment) of these regulatory 
hormones.64 To what extent the circadian disruption of 
regulatory hormones affects downstream physiological 
processes and health consequences, and how they relate 
to shift work, is beyond the scope of this article and has 
been reviewed by others.64-85
Neuroendocrine stress
Narrative reviews have concluded that disturbed sleep is 
often related to a mild temporary increase in the major 
neuroendocrine stress systems,86 as well as elevated 
stress responses.65 We found no meta-analysis on shift 
workers, but some support exists for shift workers hav-
ing acute increases in stress related hormones and sym-
pathetic activity,6 65 as well as a considerable alteration 
of the diurnal rhythms of neuroendocrine processes 
(see above). Although some support exists for shift work

A meta-analysis of 18 studies (of which seven were pro-
spective) of people aged over 55 found that short sleep 
duration was related to poor overall cognitive function-
ing (odds ratio 1.4).9 A meta-analysis of 24 studies that 
had compared people with insomnia with normal sleep-
ers found that people with insomnia had worse episodic 
memory, problem solving, and working memory but no 
impairment of other cognitive processes such as general 
cognitive functioning, perceptual processes, procedural 
learning, or attention.114
A fundamental consequence of sleep loss concerns 
global deficits in arousal and variability in attention, 
especially for monotonous tasks.39 115 With an increas-
ing degree of sleep deprivation, people’s performance 
becomes highly unstable, fluctuating from normal levels 
to serious mistakes.116 117 A promising model describing 
the nature of these cognitive deficits involves a gradual 
increase in “wake state instability” with prolonged wake-
fulness.118 This is a likely consequence of “local sleep” 
pressure affecting local neural assemblies or high main-
tenance cortical circuits, and/or deactivation of arousal 
promoting systems. 119-121 In other words, the increased 
need for sleep at the local level can lead to a breakdown of 
functions in specific neural areas, as well as a breakdown 
of connectivity between cortical areas, leading to loss of 
specific functions or affecting a large number of functions 
and behaviours. A meta-analysis on seven experimental 
neuroimaging and sleep manipulation studies showed 
that sleep deprivation leads to decreased activity in the 
fronto-parietal attention and salience networks.109
In a recent systematic review of 13 studies, nine con-
cluded that shift work leads to worse performance and 
errors.108 A systematic review found that the long and 
erratic working hours typically found among junior doc-
tors resulted in worse performance.122 These extreme 
working hours also increase the risk for doctors’ involve-
ment in motor vehicle accidents on the commute home 
from long night shifts.45
Findings on whether shift workers also have chronic 
impairments in cognitive functioning are mixed.123 124 The 
performance deficits and the risk of accidents increase 
across the working shift, and regular breaks are impor-
tant.125 An experimental study of 15 shift working police-
men showed that partial adaptation to the shift (as part 
of a light exposure intervention) improved sleep and per-
formance.126 Taken together, moderate to strong support 
exists for shift work and sleep disturbances causing cog-
nitive impairments. From a safety perspective, the riskiest 
factors include long waking periods, night shifts (with 
both long waking periods and the circadian trough), and 
the commute home from the night shift, as well as work 
weeks with extremely long working hours.127
Individual differences in resilience to shift work
Some people are more affected by shift work than others, 
as recently reviewed.66 Importantly, people are vulnerable 
to insufficient sleep in different ways; whereas some peo-
ple are impaired on certain tasks when deprived of sleep, 
others become impaired on other tasks.128
The genetic make-up is clearly an important predictor 
of why some people are more vulnerable to shift work and 
factor-α. However, the meta-analyses based on experi-
mental sleep manipulation studies did not support an 
increase in inflammatory markers.
Several experimental studies show that sleep supports 
T helper cell 1 reactivity and that sleep loss promotes T 
helper cell 2 reactivity,97 98 similar to what is found after 
other types of stress. Two large well conducted studies 
(n=153 and n=164) found that being a short sleeper or 
having disturbed sleep substantially increased the risk 
for developing the common cold if inoculated with nasal 
drops containing rhinovirus.99 100
Several studies indicate that the combination of circa-
dian disruption and sleep deprivation increases inflam-
matory markers.84 101 A few studies have found that 
shift workers, compared with day workers, have higher 
concentrations of CRP and circulating leucocytes,102 103 
whereas the data regarding natural killer cell activity 
are inconclusive.65 Extended work shifts, at least those 
involving night shifts, seem related to elevated concentra-
tions of CRP and interleukin 6 compared with normal day 
shifts.65 Low grade inflammations and infections are well 
established risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic 
disorders and may mediate the adverse health outcomes 
associated with disturbed sleep in shift work.
Cellular stress
Experimental studies indicate that sleep deprivation and 
shift work relate to cellular stress. A meta-analysis in 
2015 of animal studies concludes that sleep deprivation 
leads to an increase in oxidative stress.104 The elevated 
glucose metabolism caused by sleep loss has been pro-
posed to lead to an increase in free radicals in certain 
brain areas.105 A few studies on shift workers suggest an 
increase in oxidative stress, as indicated by an altered 
balance of pro-oxidative and anti-oxidative markers.65 A 
narrative review published in 2016 concluded that extra-
cellular levels of metabolites, including amyloid β and τ, 
increase in the brain during wakefulness and are reduced 
during sleep.106 Sleep disturbances are also related to a 
reduced clearance of these metabolites.106 Animal data 
also suggest that disturbed sleep reduces the integrity 
of the blood-brain barrier, allowing more substances to 
enter the brain.107 The occurrence of these stress mecha-
nisms in shift workers needs further investigation, and a 
parallel track would be to determine whether shift work 
can be linked to the cause of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Cognitive impairments
Cognitive impairments and safety are two of the primary 
concerns with shift work.44 108Figure 2 shows a model 
of risk factors for cognitive impairments in shift work-
ers. Cognitive performance deteriorates during periods 
of extended wakefulness and after acute restriction of 
sleep.9-112 A meta-analysis focusing on six cognitive 
domains found that the strongest effects are for sustained 
attention for simple tasks, and to some extent for work-
ing memory, short term memory, sustained attention for 
complex tasks, and processing speed.8 Accuracy of rea-
soning was not negatively affected. Sleep is also impor-
tant for learning and associative memory functions.113

These findings indicate that the phenotypes most apt 
at tolerating shift work are evening types—that is, those 
more resilient to sleep loss in the morning hours (at least 
regarding fatigue)132 133—and those with an ability to sleep 
at different times during the day.66 Other aspects, such 
as languidity, neuroticism, low scores on extraversion,66 
having low testosterone concentrations, and a long sleep 
need,18 may relate to poor shift work tolerance, but the 
causality of these relations are unclear.
Although understanding of aspects that may help the 
adaptation to shift work in the short term is growing, 
insufficient sleep than others. Polymorphisms in genes 
associated with homeostatic processes and circadian 
rhythms also relate to individual differences in sleep pres-
sure, fatigue, and performance.72-131 The PER3 gene, for 
example, is related to multiple phenotypic variables asso-
ciated with sleep quality, sleep timing, and vulnerability 
to sleep loss.131 132 A repeated finding is that people with 
the long PER3 polymorphism (PER3−/5) have a morning 
preference, and night workers with this polymorphism 
are more fatigued and tend to have earlier circadian 
phases, indicating a lack of adaptation to night work.72 132

Fig 2 |  Theoretical model of risk factors and protective factors influencing cognitive functioning in shift workers, a crucial aspect for job performance and safety. The 
top panel includes risk factors, and the bottom panel lists protective factors and countermeasures. The use of individual strategies (and individual differences, not 
shown) explains why people vary distinctively in their resilience to shift work. The organisational strategies are important for successful management of fatigue 
and accidents in the workplace. Brain areas affected by sleep loss include the prefrontal-parietal attention network, the salience network (insular and medial 
frontal cortex), and the hippocampus. Knowledge is lacking on countermeasures improving long term health, and the countermeasures should be seen as mainly 
targeting acute effects. The exceptions are dietary habits, which largely target long term health consequences

the effect of caffeine and other alertness enhancing drugs 
(such as modafinil) in mitigating sleepiness during night 
shifts,135 a systematic review on studies of simulated shift 
work showed that caffeine might be an effective interven-
tion for improving alertness in shift workers.112
The benefits of forward rotating shift systems for sleep 
were also found in an earlier systematic review, whereas 
insufficient evidence existed to support that long (≥12 h) 
shifts and timing of shifts influenced duration and quality 
of sleep.136 As discussed previously, a systematic review 
found that short (<11 h) recovery time between shifts was 
associated with more sleep disturbances.17 We identified 
two systematic reviews on characteristics of shift sched-
ules and health related outcomes.77 137 Of the included 
studies, 40 were observational, five had a prospective 
design with a control group, and nine had fewer than 20 
participants. The low number of longitudinal studies and 
the poor methodological quality made drawing conclu-
sions about whether certain shift aspects were associated 
with a reduced risk of adverse health outcomes impossi-
ble.137 It was still concluded that a change from backward 
to forward rotation, and switching from slow to fast rota-
tion, slightly improved subjective health indices.77
Scheduled napping is commonly used to alleviate severe 
fatigue during night work and long work shifts. A recent 
systematic review found limited support for enhanced 
alertness when short naps were taken during the night 
shift.138 This review did not find that naps caused severe 
sleep inertia immediately after awakening.138 However, 
many of the studies had small sample sizes, and only one 
was a randomised controlled trial. A small, but conceptu-
ally important, study on shift working policemen found 
that light exposure allowed for partial adaptation to night 
work and positive effects on sleep and performance.126
Recent studies indicate that clinical sleep disorders 
such as sleep apnoea are common among shift work-
ers.139 140 It is plausible that sleep disorders increase the 
risk for adverse health and occupational accidents in shift 
work. Although few data exist, it is likely that screening 
and treatment of sleep disorders may be an efficient way 
to improve safety and health in shift workers.
Overall, the intervention studies that aimed to mitigate 
the adverse health effects of shift working were of poor 
quality. The lack of randomised controlled trials and well 
powered studies restricts the possibility to draw evidence 
based conclusions on the efficacy of the interventions. 
The strongest support for improving sleep is for use of for-
wardly rotating schedules and allowing at least 11 hours 
of recovery time between shifts (see box 2).
Conclusions
This review highlights the associations between shift/
night work and occupational accidents/injuries, worse 
job performance, obesity and weight gain, type 2 dia-
betes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer of the 
breast, prostate, and colorectum. However, systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses also show inconsistency 
between studies, and the number of studies is small for 
several of the outcomes. Many of the studies are subject to 
bias owing to low quality of the assessment of exposure, 
which may have caused misclassification of exposure to 
knowledge is lacking about characteristics of shift work-
ers that reduce or increase the risk of developing diseases 
over longer time periods. Large individual differences in 
vulnerability to shift work exist. On the basis of current 
evidence, people who are unable to sleep during the day, 
take naps, and/or adapt their circadian phase to shift 
timing, as well as those who are sensitive to sleep loss, 
should be cautious about shift work.
Intervention studies
Relatively few controlled intervention studies on health 
and sleep problems in shift work have been conducted. A 
systematic review published in 2014 identified 44 stud-
ies that had examined organisational and individual 
interventions to improve sleep and health in connection 
with night work.134 The organisational interventions con-
cerned characteristics of shift systems, and the individual 
strategies focused on controlled light exposure (during 
the night shift), behavioural countermeasures (such as 
physical activity and health education), and pharmaco-
logical countermeasures (such as melatonin and hypnot-
ics134). The only organisational intervention that tended 
to show positive effects on sleep was forwardly rotating 
shift schedules (that is, morning-evening-night); however, 
only three out of six studies showed a significant improve-
ment. Exposure to bright light before or during night 
shifts when combined with light blocking glasses during 
leisure time seemed to promote adaptation to shift work, 
which in turn had beneficial effects on sleep.134 However, 
the findings were inconsistent and several studies failed 
to show significant improvements in sleep quality or sleep 
duration. Although light can improve alertness and adap-
tation on night shifts, it could also cause circadian disrup-
tion and increase the risk for cancer.83
Behavioural and pharmacological interventions have 
shown inconsistent effects on health indicators in shift 
workers.134 A systematic review published in 2014 (based 
on 15 randomised, placebo controlled trials) found low 
quality evidence for melatonin being a countermeasure 
against sleep problems after a night shift.135 No conclusions 
could be drawn about the effectiveness of hypnotics against 
sleep problems in relation to night work, as too few studies 
were identified.135 Although only weak evidence exists for 
Box 2 | Organisational and individual countermeasures*
Mitigation of the health and safety risks associated with shift work involves:
• Shift schedules should minimise insufficient sleep and circadian disruption and be 
characterised by forward and rapid rotation, have a minimum of 11 hours of recovery time 
between shifts, and avoid long weekly working hours (<60 hours) and work shifts (<10 hours)
• Offer shift workers a high degree of individual working time control and regulate excessive 
working hours (including overtime and double work)
• Regularly screen (and offer treatment) for clinical sleep disorders among shift workers
• Educate shift workers on individual strategies that can mitigate acute sleep and fatigue 
problems and protect long term health:
 
– Knowledge on sleep hygiene; how to prioritise sleep and recovery before, during, and 
after work periods; and napping before and during night shifts
 
– Knowledge of how to use caffeine and bright light exposure at night to promote 
adaptation and performance
 
– A healthy lifestyle for shift workers includes a healthy diet, limited night time eating, 
physical activity, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol intake
*The guidelines for countermeasures are mainly based on narrative reviews

shift and night work. Therefore, insufficient evidence 
exists to show that shift work is a causal factor for chronic 
disease.6
The relations between shift work and chronic diseases 
correspond with findings of meta-analyses and system-
atic reviews for insufficient sleep, which supports the 
assumption that sleep may be a mechanism of adverse 
health outcomes among shift workers. Furthermore, the 
review of possible mechanisms shows experimental sup-
port for sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality caus-
ing cardiometabolic stress and cognitive impairments. 
These are likely underlying factors in the increased risk 
for accidents, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart 
disease observed in shift work. However, limited epide-
miological support exists for cardiometabolic stress and 
cognitive impairments in field studies of shift work, and 
a causal link between shift work, disturbed sleep, and 
health risks could not be established.
Systematic reviews on shift scheduling and individual 
strategies to mitigate sleep/wake problems and health 
risks associated with shift work showed inconsistent 
results, which restricted the possibility to make conclu-
sions about their efficacy. The best supported method 
for improving sleep in shift workers includes having a 
forward rotating shift system (day-evening-night) and 
avoiding short recovery periods (<11 h).

FURTHER RESEARCH
• To improve knowledge of whether sleep is a causal 
mechanism for the link between shift work and health risk, 
the gap between epidemiological studies and laboratory 
experiments needs to be bridged
• Findings from experimental laboratory studies need to be 
replicated in large scale prospective field studies with shift 
workers
• The measurements in studies of shift work and health 
should involve objective assessments of working times, 
sleep, physiological mechanisms, and health outcomes
• More research is needed on whether workers with 
disturbed sleep are more susceptible than others to shift 
work
 
– Such studies should have a longitudinal design and 
allow for screening of shift work disorder and other 
sleep disturbances (for example, sleep apnoea)
• Evidence based guidelines are needed for 
recommendations of shift scheduling and organisational 
and individual countermeasures.
