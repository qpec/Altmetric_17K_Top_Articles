Growth Charting of Brain Connectivity Networks
and the Identification of Attention Impairment in Youth
Daniel Kessler, BS; Michael Angstadt, MAS; Chandra Sripada, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), important units of brain functional
organization, demonstrate substantial maturation during youth. In addition,
interrelationships between ICNs have been reliably implicated in attention performance. It is
unknown whether alterations in ICN maturational profiles can reliably detect impaired
attention functioning in youth.
OBJECTIVE To use a network growth charting approach to investigate the association
between alterations in ICN maturation and attention performance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were obtained from the publicly available
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, a prospective, population-based sample of 9498
youths who underwent genomic testing, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging.
Data collection was conducted at an academic and children’
s hospital health care network
between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2011, and data analysis was conducted
between February 1, 2015, and January 15, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistical associations between deviations from normative
network growth were assessed as well as 2 main outcome measures: accuracy during the
Penn Continuous Performance Test and diagnosis with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder.
RESULTS Of the 9498 individuals identified, 1000 youths aged 8 to 22 years underwent brain
imaging. A sample of 519 youths who met quality control criteria entered analysis, of whom
25 (4.8%) met criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The mean (SD) age of the
youth was 15.7 (3.1) years, and 223 (43.0%) were male. Participants’patterns of deviations
from normative maturational trajectories were indicative of sustained attention functioning
(R2 = 24%; F6,512 = 26.89; P < 2.2 × 10−16). Moreover, these patterns were found to be a
reliable biomarker of severe attention impairment (peak receiver operating characteristic
curve measured by area under the curve, 79.3%). In particular, a down-shifted pattern of ICN
maturation (shallow maturation), rather than a right-shifted pattern (lagged maturation), was
implicated in reduced attention performance (Akaike information criterion relative likelihood,
3.22 × 1026). Finally, parallel associations between ICN dysmaturation and diagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were identified.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Growth charting methods are widely used to assess the
development of physical or other biometric characteristics, such as weight and head
circumference. To date, this is the first demonstration that this method can be extended to
development of functional brain networks to identify clinically relevant conditions, such as
dysfunction of sustained attention.

N
ormativegrowthcharts(eg,pediatricgrowthchartsfor
height, weight, and head circumference) have been
produced for physical or other biometric characteris-
tics for at least 200 years and have proved valuable in the early
identificationofclinicallyrelevantstatesandconditions.1With
the advent of resting-state functional neuroimaging,2 the po-
tential now exists to extend growth charting methods to ma-
turing functional relationships in the brain. The human brain
is organized into several large-scale intrinsic connectivity net-
works (ICNs), each associated with distinct neurocognitive
functions.3,4 Moreover, relationships within and between ICNs
exhibit clear trajectories of change from childhood to young
adulthood.5-9 It is plausible, then, that deviations from nor-
mative trajectories of network maturation might be predic-
tive of a range of clinically important psychological character-
istics and conditions.
Network growth charting methods might be particularly
well suited to assessing sustained attention functioning and
diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
The capacity for sustained attention (ie, maintaining task-
directed focus for extended periods of time) improves rap-
idly from early childhood to young adulthood.10-14 In largely
independent lines of research, influential new brain network
models15-22 propose that proper sustained attention function-
ing requires both (1) engagement of task-positive networks
(TPNs),includingfrontoparietalcontrolnetwork(FPN)anddor-
sal and ventral attention networks (DAN and VAN), and (2) sup-
pression of the default mode network (DMN),23-27 an impor-
tant ICN implicated in introspective attention and mind
wandering. Individuals with ADHD exhibit reduced sus-
tained attention29-34 as well as distributed alterations in
ICNs,15,16 in particular, disrupted organization within the DMN
andinadequatesuppressionofthisnetworkbyTPNs.19,35Func-
tional connectivity patterns within the DMN and between the
DMN and TPNs exhibit massive maturation from childhood to
young adulthood.5-9 This observation raises an intriguing hy-
pothesis that deviations from normative patterns of intranet-
workandinternetworkmaturation,calculatedbymeansofnor-
mative network growth charts, could reliably predict early
emergence of sustained attention impairment and ADHD. To
our knowledge, the present study is the first to directly inves-
tigate this approach.
Methods
Sample
All data were obtained from the Philadelphia Neurodevelop-
mentalCohort,36,37asampleof9498youthsdistributedviathe
Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes dissemination
platform.38,39 After providing written informed consent (or as-
sent with parental consent for participants younger than 18
years), participants underwent neurocognitive and genetic as-
sessment.Fromthissample,1000participantsunderwentneu-
roimaging. Of these, youths who met the criteria for high-
quality scans and motion correction were retained for analysis
(below and eMethods in the Supplement). Demographic in-
formation is presented in the Table and in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. The University of Michigan institutional review
board determined that review was not required for the present
study. Data collection was conducted at an academic and chil-
dren’shospitalhealthcarenetworkbetweenNovember1,2009,
and November 30, 2011, and data analysis was conducted be-
tween February 1, 2015, and January 15, 2016.
Task
ParticipantscompletedthePennContinuousPerformanceTest
consisting of 180 trials.40 Stimuli are displayed once per sec-
ond, and participants respond whenever the segments dis-
played form a digit or letter, depending on the task phase. We
calculated accuracy as a proportion of correct trials out of all
180 trials (Table). Consistent with prior research,10-14 accu-
racy during sustained attention improves substantially with
increasing age (F2,516 = 126.96; P < 2.2 × 10−16). Our goal was
to build a regression model that predicts participants'task ac-
curacy relative to what is expected for age. We thus corrected
accuracy for participants’ age by modeling task accuracy as a
function of linear and quadratic age and retaining the residu-
als. This age-corrected accuracy variable was our primary de-
pendent measure.
Clinical Interview
All participants underwent a computer-aided GOASSESS
interview41 (an abbreviated in-person interview modeled on
the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version42). Par-
ents or caretakers were interviewed to provide diagnostic in-
formationonyouthaged8to17years,andthoseaged11orolder
were also interviewed directly.43 The ADHD module has been
shown to have excellent correspondence with the full Com-
positeInternationalDiagnosticInterview–Adolescentversion.43
We identified a subset of youths with ADHD based on (1) the
presence of at least 2 symptoms of inattention (for inatten-
tive type) or 2 symptoms of hyperactivity (for hyperactivity/
impulsivity type) or both (for combined type), (2) the pres-
ence of symptoms in more than 1 context, (3) the presence of
symptoms at the time of evaluation, and (4) the severity of
these symptoms reported to be 5 or greater (0, not signifi-
cant; 5, significant; 10, very severe). A total of 25 youths met
Key Points
Question In the same way that pediatricians use growth charts of
physical characteristics (height, head circumference) to identify
somatic abnormalities, can we use growth charts of functional
networks in the brain to identify neurocognitive abnormalities, in
particular, impairments in attention functioning?
Findings In this study of 519 youth (aged 8-22 years) who
underwent resting-state scanning, deviations from normative
patterns of brain network growth were significantly predictive of
impaired sustained attention performance and diagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Meaning Growth charting of functional brain networks could
provide a novel approach for constructing neuroimaging
biomarkers for psychiatrically relevant conditions.

these criteria (10, inactive type; 3, hyperactive/impulsive type;
and 12, combined type), and their demographic information
and medication status are reported in the Table.
Preprocessing and Connectome Generation
Preprocessing and connectome generation were consistent
with previous work.9,44-47 Briefly, resting-state data were de-
trended and nuisance effects were removed from each vox-
el’s time course. Next, band-pass filtering was followed by mo-
tion scrubbing (where high-motion volumes are removed from
the time series) using a 0.2-mm framewise threshold. We then
calculated spatially averaged time series for each of 1068 re-
gions of interest placed in a regular 12-mm grid throughout the
brain. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients, calculated be-
tween each region of interest, were transformed using Fisher
ztransformation.Resting-statefunctionalconnectivityquality-
control plots48,49 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) showed vir-
tually no residual systematic association between connec-
tion length and motion effects. For visualization, we used the
network map of Yeo and colleagues50 to assign regions of in-
terest to large-scale ICNs.
Independent Components Analysis
We carried out a form of joint independent components analy-
sis (ICA)46,51-54 that we modified to be applied to a single mo-
dality while retaining the method’s focus on characterizing in-
tersubject variability. Additional details are provided in
previous work46 and in the eMethods in the Supplement. In
brief, the steps are as follows. Each connection of the connec-
tome underwent regression-based cleansing to remove nui-
sance variation. In addition, variance associated with effects
of interest were augmented by adding the mean effect to in-
duce selection of components related to effects of interest. Af-
ter dimensionality reduction (standard in ICA) with model or-
der set at 15 (chosen heuristically to correspond with previous
work46), the FastICA algorithm was applied to these reduced
data55toobtaincomponentsourcemapsandexpressionscores.
Components were thresholded at |z|>3 for display. Stability was
assessed with ICASSO,56 which was run 1000 times and indi-
cated that all components were stable (Iq ranged from 0.9366
to 0.9990).57
Network Growth Charting Analyses
Using our ICA-based method, we parsed the connectome into
15 cohesive components that we designated with the letters
A through O. Each participant received an expression score for
each component, which reflects the extent to which the com-
ponent is expressed in that participant’s connectome. We next
created normative growth charts for each component by plot-
ting a quadratic fit line for component expression against age.
We then assigned a maturational deviation score for each com-
ponent to each participant. These deviation scores reflect the
differences in each participant’s component expression rela-
tive to what is predicted by the person’s biological age, with
positive numbers reflecting overexpression relative to what is
predicted for age and negative numbers representing under-
expression.
Using multiple regression, we examined whether these
maturational deviation scores were predictive of perfor-
mance on the Penn Continuous Performance Test (ie,

age-corrected accuracy) as well as ADHD status. Additional
multiple regressions (as used above to generate fit lines) were
used to assess whether specific components exhibited statis-
tically significant maturation. In these regressions, compo-
nent expression was predicted by linear and quadratic age
terms and Bonferroni correction was applied for serial testing
across multiple components. An overview of the overall ana-
lytic strategy is shown in Figure 1.
Results
Network Growth Charting to Predict Task Accuracy
Using our network growth charting method, we found that
the maturational deviation scores of the 15 connectomic
components predicted age-corrected task accuracy
(F15,503 = 13.48; P < 2.2 × 10−16) (eTable 2 in the Supplement
reports regression coefficient test statistics). Moreover, a
subset of 6 of the 15 components (components A-F)
accounted for nearly all of the predictive power of the model
(F6,512 = 26.89; P < 2.2 × 10−16; regression coefficients for all
6 components were statistically significant at P < .001). In
particular, the full 15-component predictor model accounted
for 28.7% of the variance (R2) in age-corrected task accuracy,
and the 6-component predictor model accounted for 24.0%
of the variance. Of these 6 components, 5 (components A-E)
showed clear evidence of vigorous maturation (tested using
quadratic growth models; all P < .05, Bonferroni corrected
for serial testing) (eTable 3 in the Supplement provides indi-
vidual test statistics). For all 5 of these highly maturing com-
ponents, downward deviations from the normative matura-
tional trajectory (ie, underexpression relative to age)
predicted worse accuracy.
To assess the replicability of our main analysis, a split-
half analysis was conducted (eMethods in the Supplement) in
which the participants were divided into a training sample and
an independent test sample. This analysis showed that com-
ponents learned on the training sample still had remarkable
predictive power for age-corrected task accuracy when ap-
plied to the test sample (F15,244 = 3.48; P = 2.1 × 10−5;
R2 = 17.6%), providing evidence of good replicability.

tome (Figure 2 and eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement), and
each had distinct maturational curves (Figure 3 and eFigure 4
in the Supplement). Nonetheless, they shared many striking
commonalities.
DMN Integration
Components A, D, and E exhibited increases in intra-DMN
connectivity. For component A, intra-DMN integration (ie,
increased connectivity with age) was widespread through-
out the network. For components D and E, integration was
relatively concentrated in certain nodes: angular gyrus for
component D and posterior cingulate cortex and angular
gyrus for component E.
Changing DMN-Attention Network Relationships
Components A, D, and E all showed changing interrelations be-
tween DMN and 2 major attention networks: DAN and VAN.
In component A, there was extensive segregation (ie, de-
creased connectivity with age) between DMN and both DAN
and VAN.
Changes in FPN and Its Relationships With Other Networks
The FPN was prominently represented in all 5 highly matur-
ing components. Component B, which is both the strongest
predictor of task performance as well as the most vigorously
modulated by age, showed increasing connectivity within
the FPN and DAN and increasing integration between these
networks. More details about components A through F can
be found in the eResults, eDiscussion, and eFigures 2-12 in
the Supplement.
Shallow vs Lagged Dysmaturation and Task Accuracy
For components that exhibit an inverted U-shaped matura-
tional trajectory (ie, B, C, and E), it is possible to distinguish 2
simple, distinct forms of altered maturation (eMethods and
eFigure 13 in the Supplement). The first form consists of shal-
low maturational trajectories that are downshifted relative to
the normative trajectory (in contrast, an upshifted curve re-
flects a more robust maturational trajectory). Alternatively, al-
tered maturation could manifest as maturational lag, where a
later onset of maturational change yields a right-shifted curve
(incontrast,precociousindividualsexhibitleft-shiftedcurves).
The lagged model showed a statistically significant fit
(F6,512 = 3.37; P = .0029), but it accounted for relatively little
variance (R2 = 4%). In contrast, the shallow model had excel-
lent overall fit (R2 = 24%, as reported in the Results section).
We quantitatively compared these models using the Akaike in-
formation criterion,58 which showed overwhelming evi-
dence in favor of the shallow model (relative likelihood of shal-
low vs lagged, 3.22 × 1026). Relative likelihoods greater than
100 are considered decisive evidence.59
Biomarker of Attention Dysfunction From Network
Growth Charting
We next assessed whether the maturational deviation scores
for components A through F could serve as objective biomark-
ers of youth placed into dichotomous groups of normal per-
formers and low performers on the Penn Continuous Perfor-
manceTest.Wedefinedlowperformersasyouthwhofellbelow
thexthpercentileintermsofage-correctedperformance,where
x was allowed to vary from a stringent 5th percentile to a lib-
eral 50th percentile in 5% increments; normal performers were
defined as the remaining youths. Logistic regression was used
to classify youths as low or normal performers based on de-
viation scores. Leave-one-out cross-validation (eMethods in
the Supplement) indicated that classification was reliable
(Figure 4), with highly statistically significant findings for all
cut points (peak accuracy was at the 10th percentile cut point,
with 79.3% area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve). For better appreciation of the nature of trade-offs in
sensitivity and specificity that give rise to area under the curve
values, we provide all receiver operating characteristic curves
in eFigure 14 in the Supplement.
Biomarker of ADHD From Network Growth Charting
We used the maturational deviation scores for components A
through F to carry out a logistic regression predicting ADHD
diagnosis. The model as a whole was significant (likelihood ra-
tio test, χ 2
6 = 13.00; P = .043). In addition, components A
through C were significantly predictive of diagnosis (odds ra-
tios,1.70[P = .0269]forcomponentA;2.07[P = .0129]forcom-
ponent B; and 1.87 [P = .0160] for component C) (eTable 4 in
the Supplement reports all odds ratios and test statistics).
Discussion
A recent consensus review60 challenges psychiatric neurosci-
entists who seek deeper understanding of neurodevelopmen-
tal conditions to “unravel the miswired connectome.”60(p1335)
In our resting-state imaging study of 519 youth in the Phila-
delphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we used a novel net-
work growth charting method. We mapped the normative
maturational trajectories of major components of the func-
tional connectome and showed that downshifted compo-
nent expression relative to the normative profile (shallow
maturation) is implicated in both impaired attention task per-
formance and ADHD. Many psychiatric disorders are thought
to have their origins in early neurodevelopmental events. Our
results invite further investigation into the use of network
growthchartingtoidentifypatternsofbraindysmaturationthat
can serve as early, objective markers of cognitive problems and
disorder vulnerability.

have proposed that large-scale ICNs, especially DMN and TPNs

Large circles represent individual intrinsic connectivity networks (based on the
network parcellation by Yeo and colleagues50) and each dot within a large circle
represents a region of interest (ROI) within that network. To further aid
interpretability, groups of ROIs are assigned to anatomical regions within a
network. Each line reflects a superthreshold connection; red lines reflect
increased connectivity while blue lines reflect decreased connectivity. These
highly maturing components consistently show prominent alterations within
and between default mode network and task-positive networks (TPNs),
including dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and
frontoparietal control network (FPN) (eMethods in the Supplement provides

Notably, abnormalities in all of these networks have been ob-
served in ADHD.16,67,68
Our network growth charting method forges an important
connection between the neurodevelopment of ICNs and their
role in sustained attention. We showed that when individuals
deviate from normative maturational trajectories in the devel-
opment of ICNs, they consistently exhibit worse sustained at-
tentionperformance.Inaddition,weachievedreliabledichoto-
mous classification of youth as low and normal performers
(basedonsustainedattentionfunctioningduringthePennCon-
tinuousPerformanceTest),withreliabilityofclassificationgen-
erally increasing with the stringency of the cutoff used to de-
fine the low performance group. Our approach contrasts with
that of Rosenberg and colleagues,28 who used functional con-
nectomes to predict sustained attention performance but who
did not take a network maturation approach.
We also found that many of the same dysmaturation pat-
terns that are predictive of poor attention performance are also
predictive of ADHD, consistent with a previous study9 using
the ADHD-200 data set (encompassing 421 youth after exclu-
sions; 135 with ADHD). There it was found that the neurotypi-
cal pattern of integration within the DMN and segregation of
the DMN from attention networks is reduced in youth with
ADHD, which is highly similar to our present results involv-
ing component A. Other nondevelopmental studies in
youths69,70 and adults71-73 have also found alterations in DMN-
attention network interconnections in ADHD.67
When testing which of 2 forms of dysmaturation (ie, shal-
lowvslagged)betterexplainsworseattentionperformance,we
found strong evidence in favor of the shallow model of
dysmaturation. In this form of dysmaturation, there is reduced

mental trajectory (more precisely, throughout the age range in-

of the brain (eg, cortical thickness74 and cortical surface area75)
have also shown that poor attention functioning, as indexed by
ADHDdiagnosis,isassociatedwithshallowmaturation.Theab-

For each connectomic component, we calculated maturational deviation scores
that quantify the extent to which expression of the component deviates from
age-typical levels. We entered maturational deviation scores for components A
to F into a logistic regression model to classify participants as low and normal
performers on a sustained attention task. The percentile used to define low
performers ranged from a stringent 5th percentile to a liberal 50th percentile
(with the remaining participants considered normal performers). The
performance of the classifier in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework was
measured by area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves. Classifier performance was significantly better than chance for all
performance cut points tested and reached a high of 79.3% in identifying youth
in the bottom 10% of performance vs the remaining participants. Gray shading
indicates 95% CIs; the solid line represents classification performance as
measured by AUC ROC.

Conclusions
This study introduces a novel brain network growth charting
method for the prediction of attention impairment. Our re-
sults invite further investigation into the use of neuroimag-
ing to identify patterns of brain dysmaturation that can serve
as early, objective markers of cognitive problems and disor-
der vulnerability.
