This fi
 rst paper of the Lancet Series on ending preventable stillbirths reviews progress in essential areas, identifi
 ed in 
the 2011 call to action for stillbirth prevention, to inform the integrated post-2015 agenda for maternal and newborn 
health. Worldwide attention to babies who die in stillbirth is rapidly increasing, from integration within the new Global 
Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health, to country policies inspired by the Every Newborn Action 
Plan. Supportive new guidance and metrics including stillbirth as a core health indicator and measure of quality of care 
are emerging. Prenatal health is a crucial biological foundation to life-long health. A key priority is to integrate action for 
prenatal health within the continuum of care for maternal and newborn health. Still, specifi
 c actions for stillbirths are 
needed for advocacy, policy formulation, monitoring, and research, including improvement in the dearth of data for 
eff
 ective coverage of proven interventions for prenatal survival. Strong leadership is needed worldwide and in countries. 
Institutions with a mandate to lead global eff
 orts for mothers and their babies must assert their leadership to reduce 
stillbirths by promoting healthy and safe pregnancies.
The 2011 call to action for stillbirth 
Historic achievements have been made for women’s and 
children’s health in the past 15 years.1 Yet, 2·6 million 
women experience the death of their babies in stillbirth 
in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour.2–5
In 2011, the Lancet Series on stillbirths reviewed the 
status of stillbirths2,6 and evidence for cost-eff
 ective 
interventions that could save the lives of 1·1 million 
babies annually7,8 and provide triple return on investments 
with prevention of newborn and maternal deaths.9 The 
call to action covered crucial activities for stillbirth 
reduction:10 international and country targets for stillbirth 
prevention; improved monitoring of stillbirths, their 
causes, and disparities; inclusion of stillbirth prevention 
in maternal and newborn health plans and research; and 
action against stigma, which adds burden to families 
and hampers societal engagement in stillbirth issues.
That Series received wide press coverage, reaching 
almost 1 billion people and generating a substantial 
response not only from academia and organisations but 
also from the public.11 Yet, unlike eff
 orts for maternal and 
newborn survival,1,12,13 no systematic monitoring of progress 
followed after the Series. Changes in global health policy 
are typically noted over many years,14,15 but despite the 
restricted time for change, an update on progress, potential 
solutions, and priority actions is essential to underpin 
operationalisation of the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals,16 the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and 
Adolescents’ Health 2016–30 (Global Strategy),17 and 
the Global Strategy’s supporting Global Financing 
Facility.18 Our fi
 ndings in this Series inform a renewed call 
to action.19
In this fi
 rst paper of the Lancet Ending preventable 
stillbirths Series,4,19–21 the objective is to review progress 
in critical areas identifi
 ed in the 2011 call to action.10 
We adopted a heuristic approach to policy analysis used 
in maternal and newborn health to learn how these 
initiatives created change,15,22–25 supplemented with a 
framework of determinants of political priority in global 
health, to explore why stillbirths are prioritised or why 
not (fi
 gure 1).22 We reviewed fi
 ve key domains: stillbirths 
on the worldwide maternal and newborn health agenda, 
formulation of global and national policies, funding and 
implementation 
of 
programmes, 
development 
of 
capacity for monitoring and research, and the role of 
leadership and partnerships. For leadership and 
partnerships, we used the framework for global health 
network analysis previously applied to newborn mortality 
(table 1, appendix).28,29
Agenda setting and prioritisation
The Lancet Stillbirths Series exposed a gap between the 
large stillbirth burden and the absence of this issue on the 
global maternal and newborn health agenda,2,6 and called 
on the international community to include stillbirths in all 
relevant health reports and initiatives.10 Agenda setting is 
crucial, as shown by actions at the country level for 
maternal and newborn health that followed the policy 
norms advanced by the Millennium Development Goals 
and the 2010 Global Strategy.1,12,29–31 The Lancet Stillbirths 
Series addressed issue characteristics and ideas that 
hampered prioritisation of stillbirth and called on 
stakeholders to address barriers in the political context 
and in actor power (fi
 gure 1).2,10
Several themes presented among the key messages in 
the Lancet Stillbirths Series relate directly to these four 
domains of the framework for political priority in global 
health (fi
 gure 1, table 2). Among issue characteristics, 
the Series presented stillbirth rate and estimates of 
cause as credible indicators of burden,3,6,32 and evidence 
for simple and cost-eff
 ective preventive interventions to 
integrate into health systems.7–9 Ideas included the 
Lancet 2016; 387: 574–86

portrayal of stillbirths as a neglected issue, with 
devastating and stigmatising losses of babies for 
mothers and fathers that need to be registered and 
valued. Aligned with the emerging norm of an 
integrated continuum of care for the inextricably linked 
mother and baby,33 stillbirths were recognised as babies 
dying of preventable causes, especially intrapartum, 
which were inseparable from major causes of maternal 
and newborn deaths. The Lancet Stillbirths Series 
added rate, cause, and estimates of intervention 
eff
 ectiveness into the Lives Saved Tool, to report a triple 
return on investments for integrated prevention of 
stillbirths and maternal and newborn mortality 
(fi
 gure 1, table 2).7
To assess evidence of adoption of such ideas and issue 
characteristics shown in the Lancet Stillbirths Series in the 
activities and new initiatives of global maternal and new-
born health agencies, commissions, and partner 
ships, a 
comprehensive document review was completed (table 2, 
appendix). The integrated continuum of quality care for 
the interlinked mother and baby is a widely adopted 
theme, particularly in new initiatives. Although all docu-
ments including stillbirth did so in a broader maternal 
and newborn health context, these themes had little 
correlation with stillbirth priority, neither in qualitative or 
quantitative analyses. Of all themes among ideas (fi
 gure 1), 
the triple return on investment theme, implicitly 
acknowledging the burden, lives lost, and interlinked 
causes and solutions, was most frequently adopted. All 
subsequent maternal and newborn health documents 
with investment cases included stillbirths averted, even 
when this triple return theme was the only mention of 
stillbirth.18 
Additional 
common 
themes 
included 
presentation of cost-eff
 ective preventability, and rates and 
burden of stillbirth. We noted this fi
 nding irrespective of 
any explicit priority for stillbirth prevention, indicating 
that these themes might be benefi
 cial but are insuffi
  cient 
alone to create priority. No documents addressed stigma 
associated with stillbirths.
In initiatives with explicit calls for stillbirth prevention 
or targets, two correlated portrayals of stillbirth stand 
out. First, stillbirths are humanised as babies that have 
died, rather than only enumerating them as stillbirths. 
Second, prenatal and newborn health are shown as 
an inseparable continuum, whether in pathology (shared 
pathophysiology with preterm birth, low birthweight, 
and newborn deaths) or health (prenatal biological 
potential for health). These concepts must be reinforced 
to overcome pervasive barriers identifi
 ed in the Lancet 
Stillbirths Series: the stigma that impedes women’s 
voice, and the fatalism that stillbirths, as previously for 
newborn deaths,29 are not amenable to prevention and 
are lesser losses than newborn deaths.2,12,21
Figure 2 illustrates the political context in which 
maternal, newborn, and child health agencies and 
partnerships have written annual reports to support the 
Every Woman Every Child Initiative: the Millennium 
Development Goal targets for maternal and child deaths 
were the dominating so-called supernorm,31 shaping 
policy attention and driving behaviour visible on the 
maternal and newborn health agenda. The major UN 
agencies pursued a joint mission to “ensure that health 
plans are [Millennium Development Goal] MDG-driven 
and performance-based”.34 The reports’ objectives were to 
convey eff
 orts to achieve these targets and compliance 
with recom 
mendations to support these goals. In the 
Millennium Development Goals era, little opportunity 
was available to focus on stillbirths, which did not directly 
count towards the targets, unlike newborns. In review of 
these reports, only the unfi
 nished business stillbirth 
theme was related to the Millennium Development Goals 
(appendix).
The Lancet Stillbirths Series swayed discussions for the 
post-2015 agenda, onto which stillbirth rapidly emerged. 
WHO’s multistakeholder global action report on preterm 
birth emphasised the stillbirth burden shown in the 
Lancet Stillbirths Series and the shared nature of causes 
and solutions with preterm births.35 Global agencies, 
donors, and maternal and newborn health organisations 
led by UNICEF and WHO, presented Every Newborn: An 
Key messages
Stillbirth prevention prioritisation
Stillbirth prevention has fi
 rmly emerged in the convergence of priorities for the mother 
and her baby and is integrated into global initiatives such as the Every Newborn Action 
Plan and the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health.
Policy development needs
Policy and guidance that address the entire continuum of prenatal health and survival 
through high quality antenatal care and care at birth are being developed, but no 
progress has been made in eff
 orts to address stigma and taboos associated with 
stillbirths, or in the support given to aff
 ected women and families.
Programme implementation for stillbirth prevention
Countries responding to the Every Newborn Action Plan are in the process of 
implementing programmes and targets that, if achieved, would prevent one in four 
stillbirths worldwide. Still, in most countries, implementation of the recommended 
community actions and health interventions for prenatal health is generally low. 
Hardly any development funding for implementation has been disbursed.
Improvements for monitoring and accountability
Routine data for stillbirths are improving but accountability for high quality antenatal 
care and care at birth needs to use antepartum and intrapartum stillbirth as core 
indicators. Health information systems and indicator development show promise but 
minimal data are available for eff
 ective coverage of the essential interventions.
Research into stillbirths
Progress has been made in research eff
 orts for high-burden settings, but compared 
with the stillbirth burden, research continues to be underdeveloped and underfi
 nanced.
Leadership and partnership opportunities
The network of organisations addressing stillbirth is expanding, but is underused and 
is reliant on individuals rather than the core global governance structure of UN 
agencies and partnerships. These agencies and partnerships must seize this important 
opportunity to collaborate for prenatal health and survival.

Action Plan To End Preventable Deaths to WHO’s Executive 
Board in 2014,36 integrating intrapartum stillbirth 
prevention into the plan.37 Countries, individuals, 
professional 
associations, 
and 
non-governmental 
organisations engaged strongly in consultations, and 
countries specifi
 cally requested stillbirth prevention 
targets.38 The World Health Assembly endorsed the Every 
Newborn Action Plan, requesting progress reports 
towards targets and urged member states to implement 
these policies and strengthen monitoring.39 In parallel, 
the independent Expert Review Group, a UN initiative 
monitoring accountability for women and children, 
called to integrate stillbirth into the post-2015 agenda.12,40 
This group requested a Global Investment Framework 
for Women’s and Children’s Health, the precursor of the 
Global Financing Facility to support the new Global 
Strategy, both incorporating stillbirths in their investment 
cases on the basis of the Lives Saved Tool.18,41 The UN 
Population Fund’s 2014 State of the World’s Midwifery42 
and the Lancet Midwifery Series43 stressed midwifery’s 
role in preventing stillbirths. This emphasis was 
reiterated in the Strategies toward Ending Preventable 
Maternal Mortality,44 endorsed by the global agencies, 
donors, and professional organisations, calling for 
stillbirth monitoring and setting “to protect and support 
the mother-baby dyad”44 as a guiding principle for action. 
The Every Newborn Action Plan and Strategies toward 
Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality subsequently 
promoted integrated strategies covering the full 
continuum of care.45 The 2015 progress report for the 
2010 Global Strategy identifi
 ed stillbirths as a neglected 
area for future priority action.30 
Many aspects of how the Lancet Stillbirths Series 
framed the issue of stillbirths have resonated with global 
maternal and newborn health initiatives, shown by fi
 rm 
integration of stillbirth in the 15 scoping papers for the 
new Global Strategy.45–47 Many organisations have 
endorsed new initiatives for stillbirth, showing a shift in 
priority, compared with previous activity reports 
(appendix). The new Global Strategy has been subjected

Themes
Progress
Incomplete tasks
Ideas
Stillbirths are portrayed as babies that die; 
stillbirth prevention is part of a triple return on 
investment; stillbirths need to be counted; 
improved data for stillbirth are needed; 
stillbirth prevention is part of an integrated 
continuum of care in MNH; stillbirth is a loss 
to mothers and families; stillbirth is associated 
with stigma
Global organisations that refer to stillbirths as babies and 
acknowledge the continuum from prenatal through newborn 
health, typically prioritise stillbirth prevention; most groups 
include lives saved from stillbirth in their investment case; the 
Global Strategy 2016–30 promotes action on stillbirth 
prevention, supported by ENAP and EPMM; stillbirth 
prevention is increasingly recognised as integral to quality in 
the continuum of care
Humanisation of stillborn babies and recognition of the 
importance of prenatal health has been insuffi
  ciently 
adopted—in particular in country-level policies; accountability to 
the investment cases is scarce—no funding for stillbirths has yet 
materialised; CRVS and health information systems need 
strengthening to systematically count stillbirths; loss and stigma 
are not mentioned as key issues in any of the global policy 
documents assessed
Issue 
characteristics
Stillbirth is part of the mortality burden in 
MNH; stillbirths are preventable; antenatal 
care and care at birth can prevent stillbirth; 
quality of care is important for stillbirth 
reduction; perinatal audit is essential for 
stillbirth reduction; cost-eff
 ective 
interventions to reduce stillbirths exist
Stillbirth data are increasingly available, stillbirth is now a 
WHO core 100 indicator and mortality will be monitored by 
WHO and reported to the WHA; preventability of stillbirths is 
widely recognised; eff
 ective interventions to prevent 
stillbirth, and associated costs, have been included in the 
Lives Saved Tool and the OneHealth Tool; feasibility of 
prevention is supported by WHO guidance for antenatal care, 
the broader quality of care in MNH, and perinatal audit
A dearth of data for intrapartum stillbirth and causes is available; 
coverage data for interventions are often not available in the 
highest burden countries; the range of stillbirth defi
 nitions 
hamper comparisons; the exclusion of stillbirth from the global 
burden of disease, DALYs and QALYs restricts full consideration of 
stillbirth; research and evidence supporting country-level priority 
and implementation is absent
Political context
Stillbirth is part of the unfi
 nished agenda of 
the MDGs; stillbirth should be included in the 
post-2015 agenda; the stillbirth rate is used as 
an indicator or a target for mortality reduction
The global agenda has moved beyond the MDGs: the Global 
Strategy 2016–30 envisions an end to preventable stillbirths; 
the WHA is demanding accountability, monitoring, and 
progress reports as part of ENAP; targets set by the highest 
burden countries would, if met, reduce stillbirths worldwide 
by at least 25%
Specifi
 c targets for stillbirth reduction are not in the Global 
Strategy 2016–30 or the Sustainable Development Goals, only in 
ENAP; cultural challenges surrounding babies dying in stillbirth, 
including stigma and absence of value, are barriers to country 
adoption
Actor power
International organisations should explicitly 
call for and monitor stillbirth reduction; 
parental organisations need improved 
integration with global MNH organisations
Organisations increasingly prioritise stillbirth prevention, 
compared with their previous activities; the UN agencies are 
accountable to the Global Strategy 2016–30 for ending 
preventable stillbirths
Global leadership is too weak; organisations interact with 
committed individuals rather than stillbirth specifi
 c mandates; 
political and country actors are scarce; parental groups need 
greater involvement in global advocacy; monitoring and 
evaluation is too scarce to support country advocacy

Topics in the Lancet Stillbirths Series (2011)
Methods and data sources
Agenda setting and 
prioritisation
Address stillbirths in all relevant MNH international 
reports; include stillbirth reduction targets in all 
relevant MNH initiatives
Reviewed annual reports for global health agencies, partnerships, commissions, or other platforms to support 
Every Woman, Every Child and reviewed inaugural reports for new MNH initiatives; themes from the key 
messages of the Lancet Stillbirths Series (2011) were manually identifi
 ed, coded, and analysed in NVivo; use of 
these themes was contextualised to the framework of political priority;22 interviews with organisational 
representatives working directly or indirectly on stillbirth issues, with various methods; interviews were 
analysed for common themes and organisational networks19
Policy formulation
Create a plan for stillbirth reduction; audit stillbirths; 
provide bereavement support
Reviewed health plans, policies, and strategies for high-burden countries in public databases; ”stillbirth”* was 
searched for; available documents were assessed for the Lancet Stillbirths Series in 2011 call to action topics, 
supplemented with information from countries with the highest burden of stillbirth for status of stillbirth in 
national planning and these results were combined with the Every Newborn Action Plan progress report 
(appendix)
Programme implementation 
Reduce stigma; ensure empowerment of women; set 
up pregnancy improvement committees; provide 
birth plans and transportation
Analysed the number of implementation projects and total spending on stillbirth from the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development Creditor Reporting System database, from 2002 to 201326,27 
Monitoring and research
Report stillbirth rates and causes of death; collect 
accurate data on stillbirth rates and causes of death; 
create a universal classifi
 cation system; increase 
support for those aff
 ected; increase research capacity; 
assess disparities; include stillbirth as an outcome in 
relevant research
Reviewed stillbirth data and modelled results;4,5 coverage indicator levels were extracted from publicly 
available databases and sources (appendix); surveys of health facilities were identifi
 ed and assessed for 
inclusion of questions about indicators related to stillbirth; analysis of research funding for maternal and 
newborn health from publicly available databases of 11 not-for-profi
 t institutions (appendix pp 43–45); 
MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for “stillbirth”* literature between 2000 and 2014; assessed 
total volume and time trends, to compare documents from high-burden countries and low-burden countries; 
qualitative analysis was done with NVivo into titles and abstracts of stillbirth research and identifi
 cation of 
articles reporting on the research priority topics of the Lancet Stillbirths Series (2011); all registered clinical 
trials within WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were assessed for use of terms related to 
”stillbirth”*
Leadership and partnerships
Implement eff
 ective business models
Themes noted in the reports and initiatives and identifi
 ed by interview respondents were reassessed in 
relation to a framework to understand global health networks, specifi
 cally relating to leadership and 
partnerships; we acknowledge the limitations of our insider role as members of the stillbirth network, 
although acting as observers

to worldwide country and public consultations, 
coordinated by The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn 
and Child Health, a global partnership of UN agencies, 
donors, professional, and civil society organisations. The 
strategy envisions “an end to preventable maternal, 
newborn, child and adolescent deaths and stillbirths”, 
and states that the stillbirth burden is among key “child 
health challenges”, humanises stillbirth as “2·6 million 
babies [who] die”, lists essential interventions for 
stillbirth prevention, and takes a life-course approach 
recognising that “Everyone is born with a unique 
biological potential for health”.17
Similar themes were emphasised in interviews of 
representatives from 33 organisations working in 
maternal and newborn health. These themes included: 
the need for integration within the broader maternal and 
newborn health agenda, integrated quality care for 
maternal and newborn health, clear and sensitive 
messaging to counter stigma associated with stillbirths, 
and framing of stillbirth prevention in a continuum with 
newborn health (appendix). Although our document 
review identifi
 ed that evidence in the Lancet Stillbirths 
Series has been widely adopted by global maternal and 
newborn health initiatives, agencies, commissions, and 
partner 
ships, respondents raised concerns that evidence 
and information is insuffi
  cient for rates, causes, and 
cost-eff
 ective solutions in low-income and middle-income 
countries to support prioritisation at the country level. 
These themes were identifi
 ed in the Lancet Stillbirths 
Series as key concepts to overcome perceived futility of 
stillbirth prevention.2 In support of the appropriateness 
of a worldwide discourse humanising babies that die, no 
respondents had concerns for stillbirth prevention being 
in confl
 ict with reproductive rights when asked for key 
challenges for the community. This fi
 nding was in 
accordance with the Lancet Stillbirths Series, which 
established that abortion issues were unrelated to 
stillbirth priorities in low-income and middle-income 
countries.2
The shift in priority for stillbirths globally from a 
prolonged period of stability (largely driven by the 
Millennium Development Goals) is taking a form 
reported in several other global health issues, such as 
malaria, tuberculosis, polio, and tobacco control.14 That 
is, a disruptive burst of rapid transformation by a new 
policy conceptualisation in the presence of a policy 
venue (the processes towards the Global Strategy 
2016–30). Yet, many opportunities have been missed 
for integration of stillbirth into new maternal and 
newborn health initiatives, including acknowledgment 
of the burden, promotion of essential interventions, 
and calls to monitor stillbirth (appendix). This new 
priority will only matter if followed by policies, 
funding, and nationwide adoption, but as this 
transformation is only barely completed, rudimentary 
policy formulation and programme implementation 
should be expected.
Policy formulation and programme 
implementation
The Lancet Stillbirths Series recommended interventions 
for integration into policies and programmes for prenatal 
health across the continuum of care,7,8 as well as system 
approaches such as perinatal audits, birth planning, and 
transportation,9,10 and actions to reduce stigma.2,4,5,10,19
New policies are emerging. Partly based on the failure 
of previous policies to prevent stillbirths,48–50 WHO is 
revising guidance for antenatal care, including ante-
partum stillbirth as a quality of care indicator, on the 
basis of 57 systematic reviews including stillbirth among 
key outcomes of interventions and care models. WHO 
has published a framework for quality of care in 
maternal and newborn health51 and is preparing 
standards and core indicators, which will include 
antepartum stillbirths as an indicator for high quality 
antenatal care and intrapartum stillbirth as an indicator 
of care at birth. Also, WHO is preparing guidance for 
audits to assess causes and preventability of stillbirths 
and newborn deaths. All policies are expected to be 
completed in 2016.

Some countries’ policies for stillbirth have changed 
rapidly, mostly driven by the Every Newborn Action Plan37 
providing programmatic guidance. In 10 months, 
39 low-income and middle-income countries had provided 
commitments to the plan.52 In India, the adoption of key 
themes from the Lancet Stillbirths Series, including global 
advocacy, national leadership and champions, and allies in 
maternal and newborn health providing evidence for 
feasibility of national stillbirth monitoring and prevention, 
were all instrumental for implementation of the India 
Newborn Action Plan (panel). By August, 2015, of the ten 
countries contributing 65% of stillbirths worldwide,4 fi
 ve 
countries had written or were writing sharpened maternal 
and newborn health plans inspired by the Every Newborn 
Action Plan, with four countries including stillbirth 
reduction targets (appendix). Enforcement and funding 
associated with these plans vary, and many plans devolve 
implementation to subnational levels. Of the remaining 
fi
 ve countries, only one included a stillbirth target in their 
most recent maternal and newborn health plan. Stillbirths 
globally would be reduced by a quarter if the fi
 ve countries 
with stillbirth targets met their goals. Some countries 
specifi
 cally omit stillbirth from their newborn action plans 
because of their cultural norms that lead to stillbirths 
being perceived as a lesser concern than newborn deaths.
Of the 67 low-income and middle-income countries that 
had accessible health plans, only 15 plans mentioned 
stillbirths, of which seven were made more recently than 
2011 (appendix). Interventions recommended by the Lancet 
Stillbirths Series were modestly addressed in the health 
plans with mentions of: folic acid supplementation (12%), 
syphilis detection and treatment (26%), caesarean sections 
and comprehensive emergency obstetric care (66%), and 
magnesium sulphate for eclampsia (24%).
Community actions, such as birth planning and 
transportation, social and bereavement support, and 
addressing stigma, have been only captured in these 
health plans if preceded by a concerted national policy. 
So, although our fi
 ndings underestimate community 
action, we found hardly any health plans that promoted 
such activities. No country health plans responded to the 
Lancet Stillbirths Series’ calls to act against stigma and 
Panel: The India Newborn Action Plan
In September, 2014, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare adopted the India Newborn Action Plan, which includes 
a so-called single-digit stillbirth target (ie, a target to reduce 
stillbirth to less than ten per 1000 births) for 2030—the fi
 rst 
national stillbirth prevention target. The plan is based on 
integrated interventions in antenatal care and care at birth for 
stillbirth prevention and newborn survival, linked to an in 
progress roll-out of a national stillbirth monitoring scheme 
capturing rates and causes. A National Nodal centre at the 
Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, 
Chandigarh, India, and the Technical Advisory Committee on 
Stillbirths, under the leadership of the Joint Secretary of the 
Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, supports this plan.
The convergence of three streams of scientifi
 c and public health 
work and advocacy were instrumental in this development. 
First, India committed to a 2011 WHO initiative for the 
elimination of transmission of HIV and syphilis from mother to 
child. To monitor and achieve the goals to eliminate congenital 
syphilis, stillbirth was a key indicator for mother-to-child 
transmission and information about cause-specifi
 c stillbirth 
rates were needed. With support from WHO Regional Offi
  ce for 
South-East Asia and the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, ten sentinel sites were organised for stillbirth 
monitoring, providing data for the burden and causes of 
stillbirth. Second, mortality statistics showed that 56% of 
deaths in children younger than 5 years were newborn babies. 
To reduce child mortality in India, this focus became a priority in 
professional communities. Research and inconsistent national 
stillbirth estimates provided evidence showing a substantial 
proportion of newborn deaths were reported as stillbirths 
rather than an unsuccessful neonatal resuscitation. A strong 
sense emerged that stillbirths needed to be monitored together 
with newborn deaths to provide improved data and indicators 
of care provision for babies and mothers to support further 
improvements. Third, advocacy by the Lancet Stillbirths Series 
and WHO Regional Offi
  ce for South-East Asia increased 
awareness of stillbirths, and experts in obstetrics and 
gynaecology became champions for stillbirth prevention in 
national discussions. With the political endorsement and 
support for the Every Newborn Action Plan, continuing eff
 orts 
by professionals and scientists converged with political priority 
to include scale-up of monitoring and targets for stillbirth 
reduction in the India Newborn Action Plan.
Several elements were important to enable this development. 
Evidence emerged that most stillbirths were preventable with 
simple interventions similar to those for the prevention of 
newborn mortality. A national consensus showed that 
improved data were needed for babies dying as newborns or as 
stillbirths, and that these data were important indicators of 
care, in particular in the setting of reduced maternal mortality. 
Additionally, a consensus was met for defi
 nitions of early and 
late stillbirths and for the use of an adapted Causes of Death 
and Associated Conditions classifi
 cation. The sentinel sites had 
proven the feasibility of stillbirth monitoring as a template for 
national scale-up of monitoring that would support the 
continuing national child screening programme for birth 
defects, particularly in view of the increase in facility deliveries 
beyond 80% promoted by the Indian Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfare. And fi
 nally, the existence of national champions 
among professionals supporting global advocacy created 
political support for the India Newborn Action Plan stillbirth 
targets and monitoring.

provide bereavement support. The Lancet Stillbirths 
Series called for empowerment of women and families, 
but although stigma was acknowledged to prevent 
women from realising their reproductive rights, none of 
the key UN entities working for the empowerment and 
rights of women address stigma, taboos, and abuse after 
stillbirth or newborn death.53–56 Additionally, worldwide 
eff
 orts to promote improved mental health have no focus 
on such topics.57
Because stillbirths have been outside of the norms of 
the Millennium Development Goals, hardly any funding 
from donors reporting to the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development’s database has targeted 
stillbirth 
prevention. 
Funding 
for 
reproductive, 
maternal,  and child health has increased substantially 
with the Millennium Development Goals, reaching 
more than US$13 billion in 2013 alone.1 By contrast, only 
four projects mentioned stillbirth in the entire 12-year 
funding period analysed (2002–13); only two of them 
funded implementation programmes valued at less than 
$3·0 million overall. During that same period, more 
than 80 disbursements for malaria in pregnancy and 
35 for syphilis were also funded but their eff
 ects on 
stillbirth were unstated.
Stillbirth monitoring and research
For the global maternal and newborn health community 
to coalesce eff
 ectively for stillbirth prevention, lessons 
from maternal and newborn mortality suggest the need 
for agreement on credible measures of stillbirth burden 
and causes, a classifi
 cation of stillbirth to present them, 
and evidence for simple and cost-eff
 ective interventions 
with indicators for monitoring (fi
 gure 1).22–25
Although stillbirths have not been on the worldwide 
agenda, civil registration and systems for vital events have 
been prioritised and strengthened.28 Data sources for the 
new global estimates of stillbirths, the fi
 rst since 2011, 
show improvement in availability of data at the country 
level with 38 countries having no data compared with 
68 countries in 2009.5 Further improvements are expected 
due to stillbirths being included in WHO 100 Core Health 
Indicators58 and the UN Inter-agency Group for Child 
Mortality Estimation’s monitoring programme.52 At the 
2015 World Health Assembly, the slow reduction of 
stillbirths was reported with the Millennium Development 
Goals for the fi
 rst time, due to reporting requirements for 
the Every Newborn Action Plan.37,52,59,60 Although the 
Lancet Stillbirths Series was published in time to aff
 ect 
the new Global Strategy, selection of the Sustainable 
Development Goals targets, starting in 2012, was guided 
by 
political 
recommitment 
to 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals.16 The Sustainable Development 
Goals likewise have targets for maternal and child 
mortality, but not stillbirth.16 The Global Strategy for 
2016–30 and Global Financing Facility, politically 
committed to support the Sustainable Development 
Goals, therefore do not include stillbirth targets.17,18
Dissimilar stillbirth defi
 nitions continue to hamper 
comparisons between countries.4,5 40% of data in the 
global estimates rely on defi
 nitions other than WHO’s.5 
Rights and care in pregnancy rely on gestational age, 
whereas 
WHO’s 
stillbirth 
defi
 nition 
relies 
on 
birthweight.61 This defi
 nition does not fi
 t national 
legislation or data, and WHO refrained from using their 
defi
 nition for the global stillbirth rates, targets, and 
100 Core Health Indicators.5,37,58 Disaggregated data, such 
as timing, causes, and geography, are scarce. Only 36% 
of countries reported intrapartum mortality, and even 
fewer countries reported causes of death.4,5,62 Subsequent 
to the call for a global classifi
 cation by the Lancet 
Stillbirths Series,2,6,8,10 WHO collaborated with scientifi
 c 
groups to inform a new approach to perinatal mortality 
classifi
 cation with use of the International Classifi
 cation 
of Diseases (ICD-PM),62 modelled on the maternal 
mortality classifi
 cation, known as ICD-MM.63 The Lancet 
Stillbirths Series reported that ICD-10 does not capture 
important fetal and placental categories for stillbirths,6 
and the 2018 revision of ICD-11 must address this 
underlying weakness. Capacity to identify causes of death 
of stillbirths might have been weakened: although the 
2007 WHO Verbal Autopsy Tool adequately defi
 ned 
newborn deaths and stillbirths by time of death, with 
various causes, the 2012 revision requires reporting 
stillbirth as the cause of stillbirth (only distinguishing 
fresh from macerated).64,65 With this guidance, verbal 
autopsies cannot inform ICD-PM appropriately.
Data for action is severely restricted because of a 
scarcity of monitoring of eff
 ective interventions with 
population-based data. Contact with care providers does 
not equal women having received any of the interventions 
recommended by the Lancet Stillbirths Series, nor does 
this contact refl
 ect receipt of the signal functions of basic 
and comprehensive emergency obstetric care, which 
constitute eff
 ective coverage of quality care.7,66 Present 
estimates are largely based on household surveys with 
only a few indicators of eff
 ective coverage (table 3),67,68 
leaving most essential interventions unmonitored. 
Additionally, only a subset of low-income and middle-
income countries have had a national survey including 
key indicators after 2011: 54% of countries reported on 
intermittent malaria prevention in pregnant women, 
58% reported on insecticide-treated bednets, and 10% 
reported on caesarean section rates (table 3).67,68
Metrics for monitoring and research of stillbirth are 
improving. The Every Newborn Action Plan metrics group 
is developing an action plan for indicators, methods, and 
institutionalisation of metrics in national and global 
architecture.69 A direct response to the Lancet Stillbirths 
Series and the accountability agenda was an initiative by 
WHO and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to 
strengthen health information systems, specifi
 cally 
electronic health registries tracking women and children 
across the continuum of care.70 This eRegistries framework 
integrates process and outcome indicators, including 
 Series

stillbirth, for screening and management, as well as 
guidance for electronic solutions, and ethical governance 
of data.70 Sustainable electronic health information 
systems are now widespread across low-income and 
middle-income countries70 with 27 countries having 
written eHealth strategies, half specifi
 cally in support of 
women’s and children’s health.71 Electronic solutions 
create 
unprecedented 
opportunities,70,72,73 
potentially 
combining health records for care providers with a health 
registry for public health monitoring and targeting.70 
According to a survey70 of public health offi
  cials from 
low-income and middle-income countries, four of 
fi
 ve countries register data for pregnancy, birth, and child 
health—of whom three quarters are in transition with 
both paper and electronic reporting. The new global 
roadmap for Measurement and Accountability for Results

 cally commits to closing the gaps in 
maternal and newborn health data for eff
 ective coverage 
and accountability for every baby. Civil registration should

The Lancet Stillbirths Series identifi
 ed research 
priorities, but standard search functions proved 
ineffi
  cient to assess alignment with these recom-
mendations because many were complex combinations 
and subsets of ideas.10 Qualitative analysis software 
identifi
 ed only 11% of abstracts related to stillbirth to be 
potentially linked to the Lancet Stillbirths Series 
priorities, but with a substantially greater proportion in 
concordance 
in 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries (appendix). Although the volume of stillbirth 
research increased three fold since 2000, the amount is 
only 20% of research relating to newborns, which has 
increased similarly. The greatest increase in stillbirth 
research was in low-income and middle-income 
countries. The annual number of registered trials for 
maternal and newborn health including terms relating to 
stillbirth increased by 29% in 2011–15 relative to 2008–10. 
Total funding for research focused on stillbirth from 11 of 
the largest research funders (appendix pp 43–45) 
amounted to $50 million between 2012 and 2014, 
constituting only 3% of overall maternal and newborn 
health research funding. Compared with the average 
annual funding over 2006–10, research funding of 
maternal and newborn health has not changed whereas 
research into stillbirth increased by 22% (appendix).
Leadership and partnerships
Strong leadership and partnerships are needed to ensure 
change for prenatal health and survival (fi
 gure 1). The 
results from global health network studies have shown 
that the emergence and eff
 ectiveness of leaders and 
networks is shaped by issue characteristics and political 
context.28 The severe consequences and tractability of 
stillbirth are issue characteristics that typically strengthen 
networks (table 2). The policy environment of potentially 
strong allies with interests that align also strengthens 
networks. Simultaneously, funding gaps and exclusion of 
stillbirths from the policy supernorms advanced by the 
Millennium Development Goals have hampered the 
eff
 ectiveness of a global stillbirth network.28 A moment of 
opportunity to aff
 ect decision makers was essential to 
create priority for maternal mortality;22,31 a moment that 
might now exist for stillbirth with the new Global 
Strategy. Four key features from a new framework for 
understanding global health networks are drawn on to 
explore the stillbirth network: leadership, governance, 
composition, and framing strategies.28
The Lancet Stillbirths Series in 2011 originated from 
an initiative by the leadership in the International 
Stillbirth Alliance, an advocacy and knowledge group 
creating 
a 
network 
of 
parental 
and 
scientifi
 c 
organisations, and the then WHO Department for 
Making Pregnancy Safer. With leadership from 
The Lancet’s Editor, a group of individual scientists was 
assembled to develop the Series, including scholars in 
global maternal and newborn health policy. These 
previously disconnected groups, together with funding 
agencies and others specifi
 cally approached to support 
the development and dissemination of the Lancet 
Stillbirths Series, created the core of the global stillbirth 
network; 33 organisations working in maternal and 
newborn health were assessed by an organisational 
network analysis shown in this Series.19 The context of 
publishing deadlines for the Lancet Stillbirths Series 
forced the emerging network of parental, scientifi
 c, and 
policy groups to coalesce rapidly on the framing 
strategies and themes published in the Lancet Stillbirths 
Series (table 2).
This network seems to be expanding. The network 
analysis identifi
 ed the most highly connected organi-
sations in terms of stillbirth work.19 Yet, on a formal 
organisational level, several groups had paid only minor 
attention to stillbirths before the policy opportunity of the 
new Global Strategy, according to their activity reports. 
Insuffi
  cient organisational commitment to stillbirth 
issues was a key theme in the qualitative interviews with 
organisation representatives, as the network continues to 
be generally dependent on a small group of committed 
individuals rather than their overall organisations. 
Respondents also reported an absence of strong political 
voice and individual advocates in the public domain; in 
particular, these organisations’ representatives wished for 
a stronger presence of parental groups and voices in the 
broader stillbirth network (appendix).
The diverse composition of the network created 
opportunities to address stillbirths,28 but the predominant 
composition of scientists and professionals, with 
insuffi
  cient inclusion of political and civil society actors, 
probably hampered progress for country implementation 
of action, similar to that which occurred for newborn 
survival.29 Additionally, the organisations do not exploit 
the network effi
  ciently. Among the organisations 
surveyed, on average each organisation only interacted 
(eg, information sharing or mutual commitments) with 
a fi
 fth of potential network partners on stillbirth-related 
issues. Maternal and newborn-related interactions 
between these same organisations exhibited more than 
twice the number of connections on average.19
This network created for the Lancet Stillbirths Series was 
not a concerted eff
 ort by the global maternal and newborn 
health community, which should have had ownership of 
the issue. Without a formal governance structure, 
leadership is shared more by individuals than by 
organisations, mostly not at the level of top leadership. The 
Lancet Stillbirths Series was not based on commitments 
from the leadership of UN agencies nor did it call for them 
to assume their global governance responsibility.10 A key 
challenge reported by the organisations’ representatives 
was that agencies, such as WHO, had not yet assumed the 
leadership role noted for the rest of the maternal and 
 Series

583
newborn health agenda. But the policy environment is in 
fl
 ux, both in terms of the reigning norms and in cooperating 
allies of the growing stillbirth network. With stillbirths 
integrated into the Global Strategy 2016–30 and the 
reporting requirements of the Every Newborn Action Plan, 
the UN now has mechanisms for holding UN agencies 
accountable for leadership and governance for stillbirth.
Progress and unfi
 nished business
We have noted clear progress in agenda setting and 
prioritisation (table 2). Although leadership for stillbirth 
has been too weak to overcome the barrier of the 
Millennium Development Goals’ supernorm, the shift of 
norms and integration into the new Global Strategy might 
be a turning point for the neglect in attention for stillbirth. 
Uptake of themes from the Lancet Stillbirths Series in the 
worldwide discourse helps to explain why stillbirths have 
ascended on the agenda but also points to themes with 
insuffi
  cient adoption, such as the recognition that 
stillbirths are babies that die and that prenatal health is the 
biological foundation of life-long health for every newborn. 
The insuffi
  cient adoption of these themes suggests a 
communication issue for stillbirth to gain political priority. 
Reviewed sources strongly emphasised the need for 
eff
 ective integration of stillbirths within existing maternal 
and newborn health priorities and programmes, as did the 
Lancet Stillbirths Series2,9,10 and our interview respondents. 
The global maternal and newborn health discourse, 
naturally, is predominantly about health, not death 
(fi
 gure 2). All new initiatives go beyond survival. These 
initiatives are for maternal health and for newborns to 
survive and thrive. Stillbirth seems hard to fi
 t into the 
positive health discourse and is relegated to mortality 
sections—often as a literal appendix: such as, maternal and 
newborn mortality (and stillbirth). This potential 
misconception of a poorly integrated issue is important. 
Stillbirth prevention calls for integrated action for prenatal 
health and survival from periconception through 
pregnancy and childbirth.2,7–10 Concerted communication 
that stillbirth prevention is promotion of prenatal health is 
needed: prenatal health relates to stillbirth in exactly the 
same way as neonatal and maternal health relates to 
neonatal and maternal death. At the core of public health 
programmes for women’s and children’s health, support 
for prenatal care through high quality antenatal and 
intrapartum care protects the mother and her baby,44,51,76 
and represents a quadruple return on investments, saving 
the lives of mothers and newborns, preventing stillbirths, 
and additionally, improving child development.41,47
We have noted progress in global policies and 
programme guidance, and crucially, the Global Strategy 
2016–30 has combined the policies of the Every Newborn 
Action Plan and Strategies toward Ending Preventable 
Maternal Mortality17,45,47 with action for the continuum of 
prenatal health, including prevention of antepartum 
stillbirths, accounting for the majority of stillbirths. 
Without this progress, the global targets19,37 cannot be met, 
even with a reduction of intrapartum deaths by two-
thirds.4,5 For health systems, clients, and providers, 
integration is the only way forward. The policies inspired 
by the Every Newborn Action Plan include examples of 
countries introducing stillbirth targets, and conversely, 
countries that specifi
 cally omit stillbirth targets. These 
discrepancies exemplify that coordinated but specifi
 c 
action for stillbirths is needed for advocacy, policy 
formulation, monitoring, and research. Women’s rights 
and mental health groups should be engaged. Cultural 
mores towards stillbirth must be countered: prenatal 
health aff
 ects the entire life-course; stillbirth prevention 
is prenatal health promotion; and to mothers, stillbirths 
are not numbers but babies that die. The assumption that 
stillbirth mortality will automatically reduce in parallel 
with maternal and neonatal mortality without focus is 
false; the average annual reduction rate for stillbirths 
(1·8%) in the past 15 years is substantially smaller than 
for newborn (3·1%) and maternal (3·4%) mortality.4
Notably, many interventions recommended by the 
Lancet Stillbirths Series are not yet standard. Few countries 
have adopted perinatal audits, which can reduce perinatal 
mortality if implemented appropriately.77–79 No action 
has been taken against stigma or for support of 
aff
 ected families.
The mortality eff
 ect of interventions shown with the 
Lives Saved Tool in this Series21 exemplifi
 es the need for 
cause of death data to allow policy makers to develop 
investment and action plans.80 Conversely, the exclusion 
of stillbirths from the calculation of disability-adjusted 
life-years in the Global Burden of Disease project, and of 
quality-adjusted life-years, restricts cost-eff
 ectiveness 
analyses and impedes the generation of evidence for 
investment in maternal and newborn health.80
Stillbirth is included in maternal and newborn health 
investment cases, but so far with no accountability: no 
funding of substance has materialised. An increased 
traction of the triple return on investment within policies 
at the country level is plausible as funding of 
programmes by the Global Financing Facility requires 
an investment case,18 and the UN recommended 
OneHealth 
Tool 
incorporates 
Lives 
Saved 
Tool 
calculations for stillbirth.18
Progress has been made for metrics to monitor and 
research stillbirths, but monitoring and evaluation is far 
too scarce and infrequent to support country advocacy for 
priority and action.32 A universally adopted defi
 nition of 
stillbirth is needed in addition to a global repository to 
access such data. The in-progress revision of ICD-10 to 
ICD-11 should be an opportunity to formally revise 
WHO’s stillbirth defi

coverage—antepartum stillbirth for antenatal care and 
health promotion, and intrapartum stillbirth for care at 
birth.7,82,83 The call to action from the Measurement and 
Accountability for Results in Health group understands 
that health information systems are an integrated part 
of health systems, and seamless communication of 
health information fl
 owing at all levels of the health 
system is essential for quality of care. Care should be 
taken to select indicators that support countries’ eff
 orts 
to build sustainable actionable health information 
systems at point-of-care, rather than have these eff
 orts 
undermined with indicators that are only available 
through household surveys.51,71
Our fi
 ndings on the status of research are promising, 
including a strong growth of research activities and 
alignment with research priorities in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Nonetheless, funding for 
stillbirth research is incommensurate with burden.
The global stillbirth network emerged with the Lancet 
Stillbirths Series but leadership still needs purposeful 
development, particularly to ensure country uptake. 
Institutions with the mandate to lead global eff
 orts for 
maternal and newborn health are not as central as 
desired and organisations must commit strongly, not 
rely on committed individuals. Until now, the core 
global governance structure of the UN and partnerships 
for maternal and newborn health have mostly been 
followers for stillbirth prevention. In the era of the new 
Global Strategy, these organisations and partnerships 
must seize this potentially historic opportunity to 
strengthen targets for healthy lives and promote 
wellbeing for all, at all ages, through improved prenatal 
health and survival.19,84
