Context: Enrollment in colleges of osteopathic medicine continues to increase, as
does the need for physicians practicing in underserved areas. The cost of osteopathic
medical education is substantial, with students often incurring debt of $200,000 or
more. It is unclear whether practice patterns of new graduates will be affected by
debt-to-income ratios.
Objective: To determine whether the intended practice location of graduates of col-
leges of osteopathic medicine is associated with medical education debt.
Methods: Using data from the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic
Medicine’s annual survey to graduates of colleges of osteopathic medicine, the
authors focused on graduates’ intention to practice in an underserved area, the
amount of debt incurred, and plans to enter a loan-repayment program. Survey data
from 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 were analyzed.
Results: From 2007 to 2016, the percentage of graduates who intended to practice
in underserved areas increased (27.5% to 35.3%, respectively). Graduates with the
most debt intended to practice in underserved areas at a higher percentage than
those with the least amount of debt, and they also planned on using loan-repayment
programs at a higher rate.
Conclusion: There is a strong association among the intention to practice in an
underserved area, high debt load, and intention to use a loan-repayment program.
Therefore, the osteopathic medical community should support increased access to
loan-repayment programs to help its graduates surmount economic and social bar-
riers to providing care in underserved areas.

T
he osteopathic medical profession has grown rapidly over the past 30 years. Since
2007, the average increase in enrollment in colleges of osteopathic medicine
(COMs) has been 6.9% per year.1 Today in the United States, 1 in 4 medical stu-
dents matriculate to a COM. As of the end of 2016, more than 5000 new DOs graduated
annually.2 This number represents an astounding 276% increase from 1986.2
Of the 34 accredited COMs, 6 are public institutions.2 Fourteen have opened within the
past decade, all of which are private institutions.3 Comparison of tuition fees alone
between public and private COMs shows a large discrepancy in first-year osteopathic

 medical student annual tuition (mean, $28,570 vs
$47,052, respectively).3,4 These figures, however, do
not include institution fees, which can vary consider-
ably from facility to facility, or cost-of-living expenses.
Mean osteopathic education debt among 2016 gradu-
ates was $240,331, a 16.9% increase from 5 years
earlier. National inflation for the same period was only
6.7%.5,6 Public COM graduates reported mean indebt-
edness of $208,962 vs private COM graduates’ mean
indebtedness of $246,941.6 In comparison, students
graduating from allopathic institutions in 2016 incurred
a mean medical education indebtedness of only
$180,000, which was less of an increase compared
with 5 years earlier (14%) than for COMs during that
period.7,8
The surge in COM graduates’ indebtedness has
occurred simultaneously with a national dialogue that
has highlighted both physician shortages and health dis-
parities in the United States. A 2017 Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention report9 highlighted some of
these gaps in its discussion of higher rates of death
among people in rural areas due to conditions such as
heart disease, respiratory disease, and stroke compared
with people in urban areas. The authors concluded that
nonmetropolitan communities have higher age-adjusted
death rates from the leading causes of mortality in the
United States.9 A zip code analysis of major metropol-
itan areas in Oklahoma found that people in the same
city can have life expectancies that differ by as much
as 14 years.10 Although many factors contribute to
these statistics, a common theme reverberates: lack of
access to medical care in certain geographic areas.
These concerns raise questions regarding practice loca-
tion intentions of medical school graduates. The
mission statements of many COMs have themes such
as “care for underserved populations,” “fulfilling
primary care needs,” and primary care for both rural
and urban “communities.”11-16
In light of the rapid growth of osteopathic medicine,
coupled with the increasing burden of debt for COM
graduates, we aimed to analyze practice intentions of
osteopathic graduates with regard to area (underserved
vs nonunderserved), the level of debt incurred during
medical school, and the intention to enroll in a loan-
repayment program. We also examined the role of
indebtedness in graduates’ intention to practice in an
underserved vs nonunderserved area.
Methods
The American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic
Medicine (AACOM) annually invites all accredited
COMs to administer a voluntary survey to their graduat-
ing classes. The survey examines trends among COM
graduates in terms of demographics, satisfaction,
career choice, and other metrics.5
The survey has evolved over time, but questions
seeking feedback on intended practice area, practice
population, and current level of indebtedness have
remained consistent. With AACOM’s permission, we
obtained deidentified responses from the 2007, 2010,
2013, and 2016 AACOM surveys. We examined
responses to the following questions:
▪ Are you planning to practice in any underserved or
shortage areas?
▪ If “Yes” (to practicing with underserved), in what type
of underserved or shortage area do you plan to practice?
▪ Indicate the principal amount you borrowed from
each loan source listed below to finance your osteo-
pathic medical education.
▪ Do you plan to enter a loan-repayment program?
For this study, we stored the deidentified data and
analysis in a password-protected Excel (Microsoft
Corporation) file. χ2 and analysis of variance tests
were used with standard statistical methods. P<.05 indi-
cated statistical significance. SAS software (SAS
Institute Inc) was used for all analyses.
Results
For the years 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016, the overall
mean response rate was 76.6%. Total responses

 increased from 2403 in 2007 to 4191 in 2016 as class
size increased. The percentage of graduates who
intended to practice in underserved areas was 27.5% in
2007, 32.5% in 2010, 32.2% in 2013, and 35.3% in
2016, which represents a significant increase from
2007 to 2016 (P<.001). In contrast, the percentage of
graduates who intended to work with nonunderserved
populations decreased, from 25.0% in 2007 to 15.8%
in 2016 (P<.001).
Graduates’ responses were then divided into quar-
tiles based on indebtedness (least debt, quartile 1;
most debt, quartile 4), and each quartile was ana-
lyzed. For 2007, no statistically significant difference
was found between debt quartiles in whether gradu-
ates intended to practice in underserved areas. In
2010, 2013, and 2016, however, the percentages of
graduates who intended to practice in underserved
areas were significantly lower among those with the
least debt than among the graduates with the most
debt (P=.001, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively)
(Table 1).
2013 and 2016 graduates who intended to practice
in underserved areas planned on participating in
loan-repayment programs at a significantly higher
percentage than did graduates who did not plan to
practice in underserved areas (P<.001 for both
survey years) (Table 2).
Discussion
Our findings affirm that as modern health care con-
tinues to evolve and as national medical practice trends
change, an increasing number of COM graduates will
complete their degree with intentions to practice in
underserved areas, especially among graduates with
higher debt burdens. The 42.4% increase in new
COMs in the past decade seems to not have slowed the
percentage of COM graduates who intended to practice
in underserved areas.1 In fact, during that period, the
rate at which graduates expressed intent to practice in
underserved areas was shown to increase.
Although conventional wisdom suggests high debt
burdens may drive new physicians away from prac-
ticing primary care in underserved areas,17 this pre-
sumption does not seem to be supported by the
findings of the current study. The higher the debt
incurred by respondents, the greater the intent to prac-
tice in underserved communities. Subgroup analysis of
the intent to participate in loan-repayment programs
revealed one possible explanation for this trend.
Graduates who intended to practice in underserved
areas planned to use loan-repayment programs at much
higher rates than graduates who intended to practice in
nonunderserved areas. This finding may be confounded
by the fact that a large number of loan-repayment pro-
grams require underserved area location of practice.

 However, this strong association has not previously
been documented, to our knowledge, and presents a
topic for future study.
Some research has detailed the effectiveness of loan-
repayment programs in influencing practice patterns,
but the evidence remains unclear.18 Graduates have
stated that loan repayment is a strong factor that affects
their job decision,3,19 although opinions are mixed
regarding whether incentives direct those already plan-
ning on practicing in rural areas.20 The results of the
current study indicate that graduates who intend to prac-
tice in underserved areas have both high debt and plan
on participating in loan-repayment programs (most of
which are directed toward underserved communities).
One limitation of this analysis is that surveys did not
evaluate how specialty choice relates to practice type,
location, population, or debt. We recognize that spe-
cialty choice may be a substantial contributing factor
in the decision to practice in underserved areas, and
more research is needed on this topic. Specifically,
there may be differences in the recruitment of primary
care physicians compared with specialists to under-
served areas. In addition, because of the complexities
of the decision about practice area, little longitudinal
research has been performed assessing the intentions
of medical school graduates and how their intentions
translate into long-term career choices. Another limita-
tion is that we did not analyze whether students
came from underserved areas. Colleges of osteopathic
medicine are increasingly opening in and recruiting stu-
dents from these areas. Could it be that respondents
plan to practice in underserved areas because they
want to stay in or return to those underserved areas
they grew up in? We also acknowledge that survey
data are retrospective and have response bias.
Although determining the impact of COM graduates’
chosen practice or the causal factors behind employ-
ment decisions is beyond the scope of this study, the
steady increase in medical education cost and loan
burdens, combined with the many uncertainties in loan-
repayment options or reimbursement for practice, exert
continued pressure on medical school graduates’ long-
term career decisions.21 A growing body of evidence
suggests that the career paths of osteopathic medical
graduates can be shaped by finances and incentives.
The increasing use of programs currently in place to
help reduce health care access inequality by attracting
physicians to underserved areas seems to provide
effective incentives with tens of thousands of dollars a
year in student loan repayment. Further research is
needed to determine how to optimally manage loan-
repayment programs, but continued expansion of these
programs and incentives may prove critical to placing
newly graduated physicians in areas of greatest need.
Conclusion
Given the association among the intention to practice in
an underserved area, debt load, and plan to participate
in a loan-repayment program, the osteopathic medical

 profession must continue to be aware of and involved in
addressing the economic and social pressures on its
new graduates to continue to fulfill its public health
missions. Understanding how to provide quality health
care in areas with critical needs provides an opportunity
to attract strong public health–minded applicants to the
osteopathic medical profession.
