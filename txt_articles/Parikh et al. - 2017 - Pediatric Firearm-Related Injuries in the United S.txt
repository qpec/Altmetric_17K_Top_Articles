Pediatric firearm-related deaths and injuries are a national public health crisis. In this Special
Review Article, we characterize the epidemiology of firearm-related injuries in the United States and
discuss public health programs, the role of pediatricians, and legislative efforts to address this health
crisis. Firearm-related injuries are leading causes of unintentional injury deaths in children and
adolescents. Children are more likely to be victims of unintentional injuries, the majority of which
occur in the home, and adolescents are more likely to suffer from intentional injuries due to either
assault or suicide attempts. Guns are present in 18% to 64% of US households, with significant
variability by geographic region. Almost 40% of parents erroneously believe their children are
unaware of the storage location of household guns, and 22% of parents wrongly believe that their
children have never handled household guns. Public health interventions to increase firearm safety
have demonstrated varying results, but the most effective programs have provided free gun safety
devices to families. Pediatricians should continue working to reduce gun violence by asking patients
and their families about firearm access, encouraging safe storage, and supporting firearm-related
injury prevention research. Pediatricians should also play a role in educating trainees about gun
violence. From a legislative perspective, universal background checks have been shown to decrease
firearm homicides across all ages, and child safety laws have been shown to decrease unintentional
firearm deaths and suicide deaths in youth. A collective, data-driven public health approach is crucial
to halt the epidemic of pediatric firearm-related injury.

 Firearm-related injuries and fatalities are
a dangerous reality for children and
adolescents in the United States. The
firearm-related fatality rate is 49 times
higher for 15- to 24-year-olds in the
United States than in other high-income
countries.1 Globally, 9 out of 10 children
,15 years of age killed by firearms reside
in the United States.1 Data from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reveal that firearm-related injuries are
leading causes of injury deaths in youth.2
Homicide by firearms is the fourth leading
cause of injury death in 5- to 9-year-olds and
10- to 14-year-olds and the second leading
cause in 15- to 19-year-olds. In addition,
suicide by firearm ranks as the third most
common cause of death in children 10 to
14 and 15 to 19 years of age.2 Across all
ages, in 2014 firearm injuries were
responsible for the same number of deaths
in the United States as motor vehicle
crashes.3
The morbidity, mortality, and financial
costs of firearm-related violence
demonstrate why guns have become a
public health issue. The rate of firearm-
related injuries in the United States has
remained stable since the 1990s,
whereas this rate in other countries has
decreased during the same time period.4
Firearm-related injuries were responsible
for .35 000 deaths (all ages, 2015 data)
in the United States, and the medical
cost of treating firearm-related injuries
in children and young adults ,21 years
old was .$330 million (2010 cost data)2
(Table 1). This review discusses the
available evidence on the epidemiology
of firearm-related injuries in pediatrics
and the public health interventions,
the role of pediatricians, and the impact of
legislation.
PEDIATRIC FIREARM-RELATED
INJURIES AND HEALTH CARE
UTILIZATION
In 2015, there were 4500 deaths from
firearm violence in children and young
adults ,21 years of age.2 Firearm-related
mortality is one of the top 4 causes of death
in American youth.2 In pediatric firearm
injuries presenting to US emergency
departments (EDs) or ambulatory care
centers from 2001 to 2010, one-third were
related to homicide or suicide, but the
majority of firearm-related injuries were
unintentional or accidental injuries.5
Younger children are more likely to be
unintentionally injured, and the majority of
these accidental shootings occur in the
home.6 Homicide and suicide by firearms
are the second and third leading causes of
death, respectively, for adolescents 15 to
19 years of age.2
EDs are an important point of entry into
the health care system for victims of
firearm-related injuries. Approximately
20 000 children present for care to the ED
for firearm-related injuries every year.5
Children ,12 years of age account for 10%
of all firearm-related ED visits by children
and adolescents, and those 12 to 19 years of
age account for the remaining 90%.5 For
every child killed, a substantially greater
number are seriously injured, and ∼50% of
children hospitalized for a firearm-related
injury are discharged from the hospital with
a disability.7
Pediatric ED evaluations and
hospitalizations due to firearm-related
injuries are a health care and financial
burden.5 Hospitalization data from the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids’
Inpatient Database revealed that there were
.7000 hospitalizations for firearm-related
injuries in US children and adolescents in
2009.8 On average, 20 US children and
adolescents were hospitalized each day for
firearm-related injuries. Hospitalizations
due to injuries from assault were the most
frequent (61.7%), whereas hospitalizations
due to suicide attempt were infrequent
(3.7%). In children ,10 years of age,
hospitalization due to unintentional firearm
injuries was most common (74.2%); in
contrast, in adolescents (ages 15–19 years),
the majority of hospitalizations were related
to assault (66.8%).8
FIREARM ACCESS IN CHILDREN
AND ADOLESCENTS
An understanding of routes of firearm
access in the pediatric population is
important to help guide interventions.
Surveys conducted in different parts of the
United States demonstrate significant
variability in firearm ownership among
families with children.9–11 In a survey of
424 parents of children 4 to 12 years of age
in suburban areas by Atlanta, Georgia,
.25% of parents reported having firearms
in their homes; however, ,50% reported
storing them safely.10 In another survey of
314 families with children 5 to 14 years of
age in rural Alabama, 64% reported the
presence of $1 firearm in the home.11 In a
larger survey of .5000 fifth-graders and
their caregivers from 3 different US
metropolitan areas (conducted 2004–2006),
18% of surveyed families reported firearms
in their homes.9 According to that survey,

Downloaded from 
 families with African American and Hispanic
children had lower odds of firearm
ownership than families of non-Hispanic
white children, and only 6% of families with
firearms stored firearms safely (locked,
unassembled, with trigger locks, and with
ammunition locked up). Families of non-
Hispanic white children were less likely than
families with African American children to
engage in safer storage practices.
Protection from crime and hunting were
reported as the most common reasons for
ownership.9
A few surveys have also reported on the
behavior of young children who encounter
household guns. In 1 survey, when asked
what their child would do if he or she
encountered a gun, nearly 75% of parents
reported that the child would not touch the
gun.10 However, in another observational
study of gun behavior among school-age
boys, the majority of the boys handled a gun
after discovering it hidden in a drawer, and
almost 50% pulled the trigger.12 In another
study, 73% of children ,10 years old living
in homes with guns reported knowing the
location of their parents’ firearms, and 36%
admitted they had handled the weapons.11 Of
note, 39% of parents from that study who
reported that their children did not know
the storage location of household guns and
22% of parents who reported that their
children had never handled a household
gun were contradicted by their child’s
report. These studies reinforce the need for
safe storage practices for household guns
and the need for parents to talk to their
children about firearms.
The 2011 National Youth Risk Behavior
Surveillance reported that ∼5% of students
in grades 9 through 12 had carried a gun in
the past month.13 Furthermore, a recent
survey of .3000 high school seniors found
that 65% reported having $1 gun in their
household. The likelihood of gun ownership
was higher among white men and boys, and
gun access was not associated with mental
health status.14 There have been few studies
evaluating screening practices and firearm
access among adolescents in the health
care setting. One study of pediatric
residents from various residency programs
found that only 50% reported screening for
firearm access during routine adolescent
health visits.15 An ED-based survey that
enrolled 300 adolescents presenting for
care regardless of presenting complaint
found that 16% reported having a gun in
their home, and 28% stated they could
access a loaded gun within 3 hours.16
Furthermore, .50% of adolescents
screened for firearm access stated that they
had a friend or relative who owned a gun,
and almost 50% reported that they knew
someone who had previously been shot.16
Interestingly, a study evaluating differences
in firearm accessibility between patients in
the ED who presented for violence-related
injuries and non–violence-related concerns
found no difference in access to firearms
between the 2 groups.17 Given the high
prevalence of firearm access among
adolescents, universal screening for access
to firearms in adolescents may be a
beneficial strategy.
INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE
FIREARM SAFETY
Firearms are common in US households
with children, and some studies have shown
that counseling parents can improve gun
safety in the home.18,19 Most families are
willing to discuss gun safety with health
care providers,20 and counseling by health
care providers results in safer storage
practices in the home.21 Interventions
targeting counseling can take place in the
ED, outpatient, or inpatient settings, and
Tables 2 and 3 describe interventions
focused on improving gun safety. Table 2
describes 6 studies with positive impact on
increased gun safety in the home, and
Table 3 describes 7 studies with null
findings. Of note, 3 of the 6 interventions
with positive findings provided free gun
safety devices (locks or cabinets) to
families, whereas the null studies involved
interventions focused on verbal and written
counseling for firearm safety.
Many ED-based public health interventions
have capitalized on the notion of a
“teachable moment,” or an event that
motivates people to adopt risk-reducing
behaviors. In a random sample of
emergency physicians, the majority
surveyed did not believe that their patients
would be receptive to firearm safety
counseling.22 However, studies demonstrate
that parents who are advised by ED
clinicians or mental health clinicians to
restrict access to firearms after a child
presents with a mental health concern are
more likely to do so than parents who are
not advised to restrict access.23,24
Furthermore, several ED and inpatient-
instituted youth violence intervention and
counseling programs have been successful
in decreasing the frequency of violent
aggression and criminal justice
involvement.25–27
Community and clinic-based interventions
have also been successful at improving
firearm safety. Table 2, adapted from a
systematic review that analyzed community
and clinic-based studies examining safe
firearm storage interventions,28 describes a
few of these studies. Barkin et al21
conducted a large cluster randomized
controlled multicenter study via the
Pediatric Research in Office Settings
network to analyze the efficacy of office-
based counseling focused on violence
prevention, specifically media use, corporal
punishment, and firearm access. These
authors highlighted health care clinicians’
struggles with their role in addressing
violence prevention, specifically lack of time,
inadequate training, and uncertainty of
impact. In response, the investigators
conducted a study to compare a bundle of
interventions focusing on violence
prevention with usual care. The
interventions included the use of a previsit
summary by parents to assess behaviors
and concerns about media use, discipline
strategies, and children’s exposure to
firearms; brief motivational interviewing by
clinicians; the provision of tangible tools for
parents (ie, gun cable locks); and referral to
local agencies for behavioral or aggression
concerns.21 The authors reported that the
odds of storing all firearms with a gun lock
in the intervention group was twice that of
the nonintervention group.21 In addition,
investigations by Carbone et al29 and
Grossman et al30 reported increased gun
safety after family education and provision
of gun safety devices. Interventions in high-
risk populations (eg, children with mental
health disorders or families who own guns)

Downloaded from 
 Zatzick et al32 showed increased gun safety
through verbal or written counseling alone.
Although the heterogeneity of these studies
makes some conclusions difficult, 3 of these
studies provided free safe firearm storage
devices to participants. This finding
suggests that combining both counseling
interventions with provision of free safe
storage devices may be a successful method
by which to increase the safe storage of
firearms.28 Table 3 describes interventions
that focused on verbal and written
counseling and 1 that provided coupons for
discounts on gun safety devices; none of
these studies demonstrated significant
changes in gun safety practices. More
studies in this area are necessary to better
understand why some interventions work in
certain settings and others fail to improve
firearm safety in the homes with children.
The interventions above targeted parents
and caregivers rather than the children
themselves. Although programs designed to
educate children and adolescents on
firearm safety exist, these programs have
failed to demonstrate a reduction in risky
behaviors.33,34 One explanation for the lack of
efficacy is that these programs focus on gun
safety instruction but not behavioral skills.
The National Rifle Association sponsored a
program to instruct children on gun safety;
however, a 2004 study showed that although
children in this program were able to talk
about gun safety, they failed to demonstrate
gun safety in a simulation exercise.33 The
risk of these programs is that by relying on
a child’s verbal report of gun safety
knowledge, parents may overestimate their
child’s understanding of gun safety in
practice.
Although the previously mentioned studies
were conducted mainly in ED, outpatient, or
community settings, to our knowledge
interventions related to firearm safety have
yet to be studied in the inpatient setting. As
with other educational initiatives in the
inpatient setting, such as smoking
cessation,35,36 hospitalists often have
different availability of time and resources
to engage patients and caregivers on topics
such as gun safety. Given the results of
studies conducted in the outpatient setting,
an effective inpatient intervention would
include verbal and written counseling
coupled with the provision of safe storage
devices.
ROLE OF PEDIATRICIANS IN
CURTAILING FIREARM-RELATED
INJURIES
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
strongly supports the prevention of firearm-
related injuries with an emphasis on safety
counseling during routine health
maintenance visits, reduced access, safe
storage, and stronger regulations on the
sale and purchase of firearms.37
Educating Physicians and Trainees
The AAP encourages the education of
physicians on gun violence prevention,
including gun safety and strategies for
anticipatory guidance with patients and
families.37 However, a recent systematic
review found that students and trainees
rarely receive training on firearm-related
injury prevention and firearm safety.38
Although there are limited studies on
pediatric resident perspectives, 1 study
reported that the likelihood of residents
asking parents about guns and providing
counseling relates to level of comfort and
previous education on the topic.15
Pediatricians have an opportunity to
educate trainees about gun safety
strategies and model ways to speak with
patients and families about firearm safety.
One study found that a Web-based gun
violence curriculum for pediatric residents
successfully increased feelings of self-
efficacy in providing firearm injury
prevention guidance.39 Given that
increased confidence on the topic
increases the likelihood that residents will
provide gun safety counseling,40
incorporating such curricula for pediatric
residents at the national level may be a
promising strategy to improve counseling
for families.
Discussing Anticipatory Guidance
With Families
The lack of training on firearm safety in
medical education has affected practice.
In the audio recordings of .170 well child
visits with pediatric residents, firearms
were not discussed in a single encounter.41
Pediatricians discuss a variety of safety and
injury prevention topics at routine visits,
including risks of lead paint exposure,
bicycle helmet safety, and substance abuse,
but discussion of firearm safety remains
nonexistent, a surprising finding given the
magnitude of the public health threat posed
by gun violence. In addition to education
about safe storage, several advocacy
groups, including the AAP,37 recommend
encouraging parents to ask about guns in
the homes of others when their children
spend time in someone else’s home.
Encouraging parents not only helps ensure
the safety of their own child but also
promotes community dialogue surrounding
gun safety.
The AAP also recommends that physicians
screen for access to firearms in all patients
with mood disorders, substance abuse, or
history of suicide attempts.37 Several states,
including Florida, Montana, Missouri, and
Minnesota, enacted legislation limiting how
and when patients can be asked about gun
ownership or limiting how much they are to
document in the medical record. However,
they do allow physicians to ask if medically
necessary and if a patient is at risk.42
Access to firearms is an obvious risk factor
for suicide completion.43 Legislation that
restricts a physician’s ability to counsel
could prevent a physician from obtaining
life-saving information from a depressed
adolescent who has access to firearms in
his or her home. Restrictive legislation has
been challenged in several state courts, and
in Florida it has also involved the federal
courts. The issue remains dynamic, and
federal involvement may affect future
legislation in other states. It is important to
consider the context from which this
legislation and cases evolved. In Florida, in
a well-publicized case, a pediatrician
discharged a family from his practice after
the mother refused to answer questions
about access to firearms. This case along
with other complaints led to the passage of
Florida’s physician gag law.19,44,45, The Florida
chapters of the AAP, the American Academy
of Family Physicians, and the American
College of Physicians challenged the law. As
this issue continues to evolve, pediatricians
must remain involved and aware of any
legislation that restricts their ability to keep
children safe.

 Leading Research Efforts to Study
Firearm-Related Injury Prevention
Progress in firearm injury prevention has
been limited in the United States by a lack of
scientific inquiry, knowledge, and
publications on this topic, primarily because
of lack of funding. According to a
2013 report published by the Institute of
Medicine, “the scarcity of research on
firearm-related violence limits
policymakers’ ability to propose evidence-
based policies that reduce injuries and
death and maximize safety.”46 In the 1980s,
the CDC launched efforts to promote
scientific inquiries about firearm-related
injuries; however, in 1996 Congress
restricted the agency from funding work “to
advocate or promote gun control.”46 An
executive order in 2013 by President Obama
sought to increase firearm-related funding
to the CDC, but Congress did not give full
support. Journal publications are the
cornerstone of dissemination of scientific
knowledge and can provide evidence for
intervention development and policymaking.
However, given the dearth of funding in this
area, publications on this topic have
plateaued. Between 1985 and 1999, the
annual number of publications about gun
violence increased markedly, but then they
plateaued through 2012 at about 90 articles
annually.46 When researchers accounted for
the growth of scientific literature as a whole
over the time period, publications on
firearm-related injury prevention declined
64% in 2012, compared with an increase in
firearm-related publications between
1985 and 1999; in addition, there are few
active career researchers in this area.46
Adding scientific inquiry and evidence in
this area can help promote change at the
local level, with more interventions or
program development, and at the national
level, providing policymakers with evidence.
A more nuanced understanding of pediatric
firearm-related injury through rigorous,
well-conducted research will inform the
work of public health agencies,
policymakers, and pediatricians to
effectively intervene legislate and counsel.
FIREARM LEGISLATION
There are .300 federal gun laws in the
United States that regulate the sale and
possession of firearms and ammunition.
However, because of different state and
local laws, there is tremendous variation in
the implementation of these federal laws at
the local level.47,48 A 2016 study evaluating
individual laws (through 2009) compared
their effectiveness in reducing firearm-
related mortality.49 Only 3 laws were found
to be strongly associated with reduced
deaths from firearms in this study:
universal background checks before the
purchase of guns, universal background
checks before the purchase of ammunition,
and firearm identification (microstamping
or ballistic fingerprinting) requirements.49
More recently, in a 2017 systematic review
focusing on firearm homicide, US firearm
laws were divided into 5 categories: those
that curb gun trafficking, strengthen
background checks, improve child safety,
ban military-style assault weapons, and
restrict firearms in public places.50 These
researchers found that laws that strengthen
background checks and that require a
permit to purchase a firearm are
associated with decreased firearm
homicide rates across all ages. However,
specific laws directed to improve child
safety were not associated with decreases
in firearm homicide rates.50 These findings
are in contrast to other studies that focus
on unintentional shooting deaths or suicide
deaths (not only firearm homicides), which
show a reduction in firearm-related death in
children when laws aimed to improve child
safety are associated with felony
prosecution or broader firearm legislation
to promote responsible ownership.51–53
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act
of 1993 (Brady Act) is one of the most
significant pieces of legislation that exists to
control firearm access by strengthening
background checks. The Brady Act
mandates that federally licensed firearm
dealers perform federal background
checks. The original legislation instituted a
5-day waiting period for all people
purchasing a handgun; however, this
requirement ended in 1998, and currently
there is no federally mandated waiting
period. Once the background check is
complete, the gun can be transferred to the
purchaser. Although a federally licensed
firearm dealer is required to wait
3 business days to complete the background
check, a gap in the law allows unlicensed
sellers, perhaps online or at gun trade
shows, to sell firearms without background
checks. Background checks blocked almost
2.8 million prohibited people from
purchasing or receiving a permit to
purchase or carry a firearm between
1994 and 2014.54 It is important to note that
unless local or state laws exist to regulate
private sales, only federally licensed firearm
dealers are required to conduct background
checks before sales. This variability in
firearm regulation at the state and local
level makes evaluating the effectiveness of
different categories of firearm legislation
difficult.
Child safety laws include requiring the sale
of guns with mechanical trigger locks and
mandating age restrictions for gun
purchases. Child access prevention laws
regulate the safe storage of firearms to
prevent access by minors and impose
criminal liability on adults who allow
children unsupervised access to
firearms.50,51,55 No federal child access
prevention law exists, and as of 2013, only
27 states and the District of Columbia have
enacted child access prevention laws.56
Whereas Lee et al50 concluded in their
systematic review that the overall evidence
from the 9 studies related to laws improving
child safety does not support the
effectiveness of child protection laws in
reducing firearm homicide deaths, other
studies have shown that stronger firearm
legislation and child safety laws are
associated with safer firearm storage in
families with preschool-aged children57 and
that child safety laws are effective in
reducing unintentional firearm and suicide
deaths among children.51–53 For example,
1 study evaluated the impact of the child
access prevention laws in 12 states and
found that unintentional firearm deaths fell
by 23% from 1990 to 1994 for children
,15 years of age, but only in the subgroup
of 3 states in which violation of the law was
a felony.51 Other studies noted that child
access prevention laws were associated
with an 8.3% decrease in suicide among
14- to 17-year-olds52 and a decrease in
unintentional pediatric firearm-related
injuries in states with very aggressive,

Downloaded from 
 felony prosecution for violators (eg, Florida
and California).53 Overall, child safety laws
have shown reductions in unintentional
firearm deaths and suicide deaths in youth,
and their role in overall firearm homicide by
age group may warrant more study.
Other available research examines the
overall strictness of firearm regulation
based on state-based legislation in relation
to firearm-related injury or mortality. The
Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence
and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence
annually assess and compare each state’s
legislation on gun laws and assign a score
based on various policy points including
strength of background checks, limitation of
military-style assault weapons, and
limitation on firearms in public places.47
Although it is not a validated score, studies
have used the Brady score to account for
variability in state-based firearm legislation
when studying firearm-related injuries. A
study that examined gun laws and firearm-
related injuries across 18 states revealed
that states with the strictest gun laws had
the lowest numbers of hospital visits for
nonfatal firearm-related injuries.58 In
particular, among children, stricter states
also had lower rates of hospital admissions
and visits for firearm-related injuries than
states with less strict firearm legislation.58
Additionally, in a national sample, mean
firearm-related injury rates among trauma
patients were higher in states with less
strict firearm legislation than in states with
strict firearm legislation.48 Stricter firearm
laws have also been associated with fewer
high school students reporting firearm
carriage in the past 30 days.59
Although the data suggest that individual
review of gun laws is sufficient to evaluate
their effectiveness, important interactions
between laws must not be overlooked.
There are hundreds of state-level laws that
regulate firearms. Attention should be
focused on supporting the laws, or
combination of laws, that have been shown
to be effective.
CONCLUSIONS
Firearm-related injuries are a pediatric
public health crisis with significant
morbidity and mortality in the United
States. Of 20 000 firearm-related pediatric
injuries every year, injury in younger
children is generally caused by accidental
access, whereas adolescent injury is most
often intentional, from suicide attempts
and violence. Legislation to combat
firearm-related injuries has existed since
the signing of the Brady Act in 1993. Since
then, research has emerged clearly
demonstrating that universal background
checks and firearm identification are
the most effective pieces of legislation
to prevent firearm injuries.49,50 Child
access prevention laws with felony
prosecution of violators may also play
an important role in the legislative
environment.
Rigorous investigations, with the use of
validated scoring systems, large
comprehensive databases, and accurate
detailed reporting and surveillance of
firearm access and related injury, are
urgently needed. Firearm research by the
CDC has been limited by constant threats
by Congress to reduce funding, and recent
efforts to increase funding have been
unsuccessful.60 A collective, data-driven
public health approach is crucial to halt
the epidemic of pediatric firearm-related
injury.
