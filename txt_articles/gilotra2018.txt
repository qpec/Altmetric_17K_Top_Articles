ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of a novel, pH-neutral formulation of furosemide
administered subcutaneously (SC) for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (HF).
BACKGROUND Congestion requiring intravenous (IV) administration of a diuretic agent is the main reason patients
with HF present for acute medical care.
METHODS Outpatients presenting with decompensated HF were randomized to receive a single SC or IV dose of
furosemide. Primary outcome was 6-h urine output, and secondary outcomes were weight change, natriuresis, and
adverse events.
RESULTS Forty-one patients were randomized: 19 were treated with IV (mean dose: 123 � 47 mg) and 21 with SC
furosemide (fixed dose of 80 mg over 5 h). The 6-h urine output in the IV group was not significantly different from that
in the SC furosemide group (median IV: 1,425 ml; interquartile range [IQR]: 1,075 to 1,950 ml; vs. median SC: 1,350 ml;
IQR: 900 to 1,900 ml; p ¼ 0.84). Additionally, mean weight loss was not significantly different (�1.5 � 1.1 kg in the IV
group vs. �1.5 � 1.2 kg in the SC group; p ¼ 0.95). Hourly urine output was significantly higher in the IV group at hour 2
(425 ml in the IV group vs. 250 ml in the SC group; p ¼ 0.02) and higher in the SC group at hour 6 (125 ml, IV group vs.
325 ml, SC group; p ¼ 0.005). Natriuresis was higher in the SC group (IV: 7.3 � 35.3 mEq/l vs. SC: 32.8 � 43.6 mEq/l; p ¼
0.05). There was no worsening renal function, ototoxicity, or skin irritation with either formulation. Thirty-day hospi-
talization rates were similar.
CONCLUSIONS In this phase II trial, we did not identify significant differences between urine output obtained with
pH-neutral furosemide administered SC and that obtained by IV. This method of decongestion may allow treatment at
home and reduced HF resources and warrants further investigation. (Sub-Q Versus IV Furosemide in Acute Heart Failure;

 furosemide has a peak onset of action within
1 to 2 h, which then wanes; however, particu-
larly in the setting of worsening edema of the
gut, oral absorption can be quite erratic (4).
Therefore, in these situations, patients may
require intravenous (IV) diuretic therapy,
often
resulting
in
HF
hospitalization.
In
fact, nearly 90% of patients with ADHF are
treated with IV loop diuretics (5). With the
rising cost of HF hospitalization (6), novel
strategies are being used worldwide to keep HF pa-
tients out of the hospital. In 2012, we established
the
Johns
Hopkins
Heart
Failure
Bridge
Clinic
(HFBC), an outpatient HF disease management pro-
gram with the ability to administer IV diuretics. In
2016, we administered IV furosemide 441 times.
Other studies have shown that such a strategy is
safe and results in significant urine output (7). How-
ever, this therapy still requires a clinic visit, use of re-
sources, patient inconvenience, and peripheral IV
catheter placement.
Furosemide for injection (or furosemide USP) has an
alkaline pH ranging from 8.0 to 9.3, thus limiting the
ability to administer the drug subcutaneously (SC) due
to discomfort upon injection and local skin irritation
(8). A novel, buffered, pH-neutral formulation of
furosemide was developed for SC administration
(scFurosemide, product SCP-101, scPharmaceuticals,
Lexington, Massachusetts) with the aim of developing
an alternative to IV furosemide that could ultimately
be used by patients outside the acute care setting.
scFurosemide injection (80 mg/0 ml) is administered
by SC infusion, with 30 mg delivered in the first hour
and 12.5 mg/h delivered for the subsequent 4 h for a
total dose of 80 mg. The SC infusion has been
demonstrated to be well tolerated and can achieve
therapeutic drug levels in stable chronic HF subjects
(9). We sought to study the efficacy and safety of
scFurosemide administered SC in patients with wors-
ening HF requiring IV diuresis in the outpatient clinic.
METHODS
STUDY
DESIGN. This was a randomized proof-of-
concept pilot study.
STUDY PARTICIPANTS. Adult outpatients who pre-
sented to the HFBC with a history of HF treatment of
least 3 months or HF hospitalization within 60 days
and who were identified by providers as requiring IV
diuresis for worsening HF were eligible for the study.
Patients were categorized as New York Heart Associ-
ation functional classes II to IV with signs and/or
symptoms of volume overload. Exclusion criteria
were as follows: patients presenting with signs or
symptoms
where
chance
of
hospitalization
was
high,
such
as
myocardial
ischemia,
uncontrolled
arrhythmia, infection, fever >101�F (38�C), hemody-
namic instability (systolic blood pressure #80 mm Hg,
symptomatic hypotension, diastolic blood pressure
$120 mm Hg, or evidence of hypertensive urgency or
emergency), respiratory compromise, mental status
changes, acute kidney injury defined as >25% increase
in
serum
creatinine
from
baseline,
hypokalemia
defined as serum potassium <4.0 mmol/l, patients
receiving
experimental
medication
therapy
or
currently
participating
in
another
cardiovascular
research study, presence of or need for urinary bladder
catheterization, urinary tract abnormality or disorder
interfering with urination, or allergy to loop diuretics.
Subjects were enrolled from February 2016 to April
2017, and all participants provided written informed
consent. Patients could only be enrolled in the study
once during the study period. The study was approved
by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board.
RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION.
Subjects were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to
receive a single dose of IV furosemide or scFur-
osemide. Randomization was performed using block-
stratified
assignments
by
using
a
computerized
pseudorandom number generator by the Johns Hop-
kins Hospital Investigational Drug Service, which
dispensed study drug and was blinded to clinical
outcomes. All subjects underwent examinations for
baseline vital signs, weight, and laboratory testing
(including serum sodium, potassium, creatinine, pro–
B-type natriuretic peptide [proBNP] and urinary so-
dium concentrations). All laboratory testing occurred
at the Johns Hopkins core laboratory. Subjects ran-
domized to IV therapy underwent usual care, with
placement of peripheral IV catheter and administra-
tion of diuretic agent as an IV bolus. Dose was
calculated based on the subject’s outpatient oral
dose, typically with a 1:1 conversion, with a maximum
IV dose of 160 mg. The SC group received 80 mg of
scFurosemide administered over 5 h (30 mg in the
first hour, followed by 12.5 mg/h for 4 h) by using an
infusion
pump
system
(Perfusor
space
infusion
pump, B. Braun Medical, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania)
and a standard commercial infusion set. Subjects also
received potassium or magnesium supplementation
according to standard of care protocol in the diuresis
clinic. Subjects vital signs (blood pressure and heart
rate) and urine output were monitored for 6 h. Sub-
jects

 staff member on an hourly basis over the 6-h study
observation period. During diuretic administration,
all patients underwent a 100-ml fluid consumption
restriction. At 6 h, patients’ weight measurements
and laboratory testing were repeated. They were
monitored
for
side
effects
and
adverse
events,
including access site discomfort (burning, itching,
pain, and rash), ototoxicity, change in renal function
and potassium concentrations, and symptoms of po-
sitional lightheadedness. Subjects were then dis-
charged from the clinic, and were followed for clinical
events for 30 days.
ENDPOINTS. The primary outcome was volume of
urine output at 6 h. Secondary outcomes included
weight change, hourly urine output, natriuresis, fre-
quency of adverse events, and 30-day hospitalization
rate. A follow-up telephone call and medical chart
review were performed at 1, 7, and 30 days to assess
for
side
effects,
further
IV
diuretic
needs,
and
hospitalization.
SAMPLE SIZE. Based on experience in the clinic, we
estimated the 6-h urine output to be approximately
1,200 ml in the IV group. We considered a difference
in urine output of 500 ml to be clinically significant.
Using a SD of 500 ml, we estimated we would need
approximately 20 patients in each group to have 80%
power to detect a clinically significant difference in
6-h urine output between the IV and SC groups.
STATISTICAL METHODS. The Shapiro-Wilk test was
used
to
determine
data
distribution.
Parametric
continuous variables are given as mean � SD, and
nonparametric continuous variables are reported as
medians and interquartile ranges. Comparisons were
made using the Student t or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
Categorical variables are presented as percentages
and
were
compared
using
the
chi-squared
test.
The pre-specified threshold for significance was a
p value <0.05. All statistical analyses were performed
using STATA version 13 software (Stata Corp., College
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study. One
patient was a screen failure after randomization and
prior to receiving study drug due to lack of need for IV
diuretic
on
reassessment.
Twenty-one
patients
received SC furosemide, and 19 patients received IV
furosemide. The mean IV dose administered was
123 � 47 mg, with 58% of subjects receiving the
maximum dose of 160 mg.
Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1.
Study subjects were average 57 � 13 years of age, 55%
were female; and the average body mass index was
38.7 � 11.2 kg/m2. The mean home oral furosemide
daily dose was 246 � 167 mg. No meaningful baseline
clinical differences were observed between IV and SC
groups (Table 1).

1,075 to 1,950 ml vs. 1,350 ml in the SC group; IQR: 900
to 1,900 ml; p ¼ 0.84). Mean urine output in the IV
group also did not differ significantly from that in the
SC group (IV: 1,636 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1,182 to 2,089 ml vs. SC: 1,514 ml; 95% CI: 1,182 to 1,847
ml; mean difference between groups: 121 ml; 95%
CI: �415 to 658 ml; p ¼ 0.649). Maximum 6-h urine
output was 4,325 ml in the IV group and 3,200 ml in the
SC group. Hourly urine output was significantly lower
in the SC group at hour 2 (IV: 425 ml vs. SC: 250 ml;
p ¼ 0.02) and higher in the SC group at hour 6 (IV: 125 ml
vs. SC: 325 ml; p ¼ 0.005) (Figure 1).
Weight loss between the 2 groups was not signifi-
cantly different (IV: �1.5 � 1.1 kg vs. SC: �1.5 � 1.2 kg;

proBNP concentration decreased in the IV group
(�2 � 14 mEq/l) and increased in the SC group
(þ3.5 � 13 mEq/l), the difference was not statistically
significant (p ¼ 0.21).
There were no events of worsening renal function,
severe electrolyte disturbances, arrhythmia, ototox-
icity, or skin irritation with either formulation. There
was 1 case of mild hypokalemia in the SC group, in
which the pre-diuresis serum potassium concentra-
tion of 4.1 mEq/l fell to 3.3 mEq/l.
At 1-, 7- and 30-day follow ups, no patients in the
SC group reported delayed skin irritation or pain at
infusion site after leaving the clinic. There was a
42% (n ¼ 8 of 19 subjects) 30-day hospitalization rate
in the IV group compared with a 52% (n ¼ 11 of 21

DISCUSSION
There have been limited advancements in diuretic
therapy
in
decompensated
HF,
despite
diuretics
serving as the mainstay for relief of congestion for
several decades. This is the first study to examine the
efficacy of a novel SC formulation of the loop diuretic
furosemide administered by 5-h fixed-dose infusion
in patients presenting with worsening HF in the
outpatient setting. We found that the 80-mg 5-h
infusion
of
scFurosemide
achieved
diuresis
and
weight change similar to and effectively as that of IV
furosemide at an average 50% higher dose, without
any differences in adverse events.
The biphasic diuretic administration regimen used
in this study was designed to achieve maximum
diuretic efficiency, that is, milliliters of urine output
per milligram of drug. We were initially concerned
that using only 80 mg of SC furosemide would be an
insufficient amount of furosemide as many of our
patients were receiving higher oral doses. The 80-mg
dose is a fixed dose determined by tolerability studies
of the volume of drug that can be infused and by
pharmacokinetic studies showing a sustained thera-
peutic drug level. Despite the fact that the IV group
received a greater average dose of furosemide, there
were no differences in urine output volume at 6 h.
Buckley et al. (7) administered a total IV bolus dose of
260 mg of furosemide followed by an infusion strat-
egy to a similar patient population and demonstrated
a median urine output of 1,045 ml over the course of a
clinic visit. Based on our current study, 80 mg SC
furosemide administered in this biphasic regimen is
clearly an efficacious dose for HF patients with acute
volume overload.
The efficacy of the lower SC dose is in part due to
its better bioavailability, in addition to the slow
infusion design. In a small study of healthy volun-
teers, low-dose SC furosemide (20 mg) produced both

 diuretic (1,430 � 504 ml vs. 459 � 279 ml urine
output; p < 0.05) and natriuretic (134 � 31 mEq/l vs.
29 � 17 mEq/l urine sodium; p < 0.05) effects
compared with placebo (8). A study using a contin-
uous SC infusion by using an elastomeric pump for 4
to 5 days demonstrated a significant weight change
from baseline of 79.4 kg to 77.3 kg (10). Prior studies
of oral furosemide have demonstrated low bioavail-
ability (72%) with wide variability within individual
patients (11). Using the SC formulation studied and
administered at the same doses as in the current
study, scFurosemide has been shown to achieve
therapeutic plasma levels within 30 min of adminis-
tration as well as nearly 100% bioavailability (9).
In
comparison,
the
mean
bioavailability
of
the
oral formulation was 61% of the SC formulation.
Compared with both oral and IV formulations in
pharmacokinetic studies, the SC groups avoided peak
concentrations and demonstrated a constant rate of
absorption (9). In our study, subjects in the scFur-
osemide group had more robust hourly urine output
later in the 6-h observation window than that in the
IV
group.
This
difference
may
reflect
the
more
consistent drug level attained by SC formulation than
that in the early peak seen with bolus IV administra-
tion. It is also possible that the SC group would have
had ongoing diuresis and greater total urine output
over a longer window of time (8 to 12 h), given the
later peak in urine output in the SC group seen in this
study. Additionally, despite the average body mass
index of 38.7 � 11.2 kg/m2 in our study subjects, the
SC group had an equally robust urinary and a greater
natriuretic response than that in the IV group. This
further emphasizes the efficacy of the SC route of
administration. Further study is needed to assess the
delayed (previous 6-h) effects of SC furosemide.
Prior formulations of SC furosemide have been
limited by the alkaline pH, allowing only low-volume
injection and causing frequent administration site
burning and stinging (8,12). Alternative strategies to
administration of the SC formulation have been the
use of an elastomeric pump; however, that too has
limitations as it requires catheter placement and
continuous infusion and has been complicated by
frequent site reactions including abscess formation
(10,12). In an attempt to address some of these hur-
dles to SC administration of furosemide, the scFur-
osemide used in this study was developed with a
physiologic pH of 7.4 and the ability to administer it
through an infusion pump. Notably, there were no
skin administration site reactions or patient reports of
discomfort acutely or at follow-up. This new mode of
furosemide administration therefore seems to have
eliminated prior concerns of skin irritation and infu-
sion intolerability.
Acute HF is a burgeoning epidemic and accounts
for more than 1 million hospitalizations annually in
the United States (2). Additionally, 25% of patients
hospitalized with HF are readmitted within 30 days of
discharge (13). HF health care costs are expected to
approach $70 billion by 2030 (6). The main driver for
these HF presentations is congestion that necessi-
tates IV diuretic therapy in a hospital or clinic setting
with a certified health care professional. Therefore,
the potential use of SC rather than IV furosemide in
the management of volume overload has significant
clinical implications by shifting treatment outside the
hospital setting.
Already, SC medications are used in patients un-
der palliative or hospice care, to avoid venous access
and improve patient comfort. Small retrospective
case series have demonstrated the efficacy of SC
administration of furosemide in end-stage HF pa-
tients to relieve dyspnea and congestion in home or
hospice
settings
(14–16).
Our
study
expands
the
possibility of applying this novel treatment strategy
in patients with less advanced HF presenting to the
outpatient clinic with an acute decompensation, who
can be treated and discharged home without an
admission. Ultimately, the goal would be to send
patients home with SC furosemide or to prescribe the
medication without the patient having to come in to
the clinic or hospital. The current need for patients
to
present
to
a
clinical
setting
naturally
delays
diuretic administration, and it has recently been
demonstrated that earlier administration of diuretics
in the emergency department is associated with
improved outcomes in cases of worsening HF (17).
The furosemide formulation in this study is being
developed to be administered through a wearable SC
drug delivery infusor (i.e., a patch pump) for use
outside the acute care setting. This strategy’s safety
and impact on use of resources warrants future
investigation.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. It was a small, single-center
study carried out at an urban tertiary care center, thus
potentially limiting generalizability. However, it is
the largest study of its nature, assessing the SC
administration of furosemide in patients with ADHF,
and the first study to evaluate a novel, pH-neutral
formulation of furosemide in patients with volume
overload
presenting
to
an
outpatient
HF
clinic.
Additionally, this was a high-risk
outpatient HF
cohort, in which nearly half the patients required
hospitalization during study follow-up. This likely

 to study design, which required subjects to remain in
clinic for 6 h, thus limiting participant enrollment
perhaps to those patients who are seen frequently for
IV diuresis and are, therefore, at higher risk for future
diuresis need or hospitalization. Although the longer
administration time of the SC formulation may be
seen as a barrier to widespread use, the benefit of 5-h
administration is the maximization of diuretic effi-
ciency, which allows a more steady-state concentra-
tion and prolonged diuresis, as we demonstrate.
CONCLUSIONS
This study, the first in outpatients with worsening
HF, demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety of SC
administration of furosemide that was comparable to
that of IV furosemide. We describe the first clinical
comparison between the fixed dose of a novel, pH-
neutral formulation of furosemide and our standard
regimen, which involved IV administration of a dose
that was approximately 50% higher. The findings of
this study corroborate the design premise that a
higher diuretic efficiency can be achieved by slower
infusion compared to that of the IV bolus. Addition-
ally,
these
results
have
significant
implications
for
the
outpatient
management
of
HF.
Future
investigation
is
required
to
assess
home
self-
administration of scFurosemide and its potential
effects on HF hospitalization reduction.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
In patients with worsening HF, fixed-dose SC
administration of scFurosemide resulted in diuresis
that was similar to bolus dose IV furosemide.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies are
needed to assess the use of scFurosemide at home
and the impact of such an intervention on outcomes in
patients with HF.
