Abstract
The accurate delivery of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for definitive prostate cancer
treatment is aided by intrafraction image guidance. The common methods for intrafraction
imaging require the invasive placement of fiducial markers or electromagnetic transponders.
Recently, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tri-cobalt-60 head radiotherapy system
has become available for treatment, which can utilize real-time cine MRI to non-invasively
track prostate motion. We report on a clinical vignette using this technique to deliver SBRT for
the definitive treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The incorporation of an MRI-
guided radiotherapy system and the implementation of real-time adaptive dose delivery
accounting for intrafraction anatomic motion may improve outcomes using this technique.

Introduction
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is being increasingly utilized as a definitive treatment
option for prostate cancer [1]. This technique exploits the low alpha/beta ratio of prostate
cancer cells to potentially improve efficacy while also improving patient convenience by
condensing treatment length. One of the challenges with this treatment involves minimizing
the impact of inter- and intrafraction target motion when only five fractions are being
delivered. Several image guidance methods have been developed for intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments in prostate cancer to account for prostate motion and
deformation. These include cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), stereoscopic x-ray
verification using intraprostatic fiducial markers, and the Calypso system (Varian Medical
Sytems, Palo Alto, California, United States) using electromagnetic transponder placement.
Intrafraction prostate motion and deformation are particularly important with SBRT delivery
given that more dose is delivered per day in many fewer fractions than in a conventionally
fractionated radiation therapy course. Therefore, a significant deviation in even a single
fraction may alter 20% of the delivered dose in a particular location, resulting in the over-
dosing of normal structures or the under-dosing of the prostate. We report on a clinical vignette
illustrating the opportunity for non-invasive, accurate treatment delivery of SBRT for prostate

 cancer with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tri-cobalt-60 radiation therapy
system.
Case Presentation
A 74-year-old man presented with a newly diagnosed, favorable-intermediate risk prostate
cancer (clinical T-category T1c, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 5.54 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason
score 3+4=7). He was initially found to have an elevated screening PSA, for which he was
referred for a diagnostic prostate MRI exam. This revealed a 42-gram prostate with two
suspicious lesions at the left anterior peripheral mid-gland, measuring 1.9 cm, and at the right
anterior peripheral apical mid-gland lesion, measuring 0.9 cm. No evidence of an extraprostatic
extension was seen, including either seminal vesicle invasion or neurovascular bundle
involvement. No suspicious lymphadenopathy or bone lesions were appreciated. Subsequently,
a targeted and limited systematic prostate biopsy was performed. This procedure was
performed under anesthesia, given the patient’s extreme apprehension of needles. Pathology
revealed three out of eight cores having evidence of malignancy, with two cores containing
Gleason score 3+4=7 disease and one core containing 3+3=6 disease. 
The patient refused further invasive manipulation of his perineum as well as consideration of
brachytherapy or radical prostatectomy as treatment options. His reticence for the invasive
manipulation of his prostate also resulted in an active surveillance program incorporating
further biopsies being an undesirable option. He was very interested in an external beam
radiation technique to treat his prostate cancer, and he was most interested in SBRT given the
convenience of the treatment.
In order to accommodate his desires, it was decided to deliver SBRT utilizing the 0.35-Tesla
MRI-guided tri-cobalt-60 radiotherapy system, which would obviate the need for fiducial
placement. MRI- and computed tomography (CT)-based simulations were performed for
radiation planning. A true fast imaging with steady-state free precession (TRUFI) sequence was
performed to acquire the three dimensional MRI images with 1.5-mm isotropic spatial
resolution and a field of view of 50x45x43 cm without contrast injection and a total acquisition
time of 172 seconds. The MRI-based simulation was used for volumetric target and organs-at-
risk (OARs) anatomic delineation. The CT-based simulation was utilized to provide electron
density information for treatment planning. The prescribed dose to the planning target volume
(PTV) was 38Gy in five fractions. The radiation dose distribution and dose-volume histogram
(DVH) of the treatment plan are presented in Figure 1.

Real-time cine MRI imaging at a rate of four frames/second was also utilized during treatment

 (MRI) imaging of the pelvis in the sagittal plane during treatment shows a significant motion of the
prostate (thin red line) relative to the treatment gating window (thick red line) as a result of bowel
gas distending the rectum.

A 3-mm gating margin from the prostate contour was set as the gating boundary. Beam delivery
was halted if the prostate moved outside the gating boundary or if the system detected low
image correlation between the acquired cine frames and the initially acquired three-
dimensional images. Despite that, minimal interfraction motion was observed on daily MRI
setup images. As shown in Figure 2, significant rectal volume deviations were found during
treatment delivery due to bowel gas distending the rectum at the level of the prostate (Video 1
and Figure 3).
FIGURE 3: Sequential Image Capture Illustrating Prostate
Motion due to Rectal Distension
These sagittal images capture intrafraction prostate motion (contoured as the thin red line) away
from the treatment gating window (thick red line) at various time points due to rectal distension from
bowel gas movement.
This resulted in significant intrafraction prostatic motion during every treatment fraction, even
with bowel preparation recommendations including simethicone. Treatment was stopped either
by the radiotherapy system or manually stopped by the treatment team to limit the treatment
delivered when bowel gas was distending the rectum further into the PTV and the prostate out
of the PTV. Treatment was resumed when the prostate returned to its desired position. When
tracking the prostate-anterior rectum interface, up to 1 cm of anterior-posterior deviation was
seen during treatment (Figure 4).

Rectal Distension due to Bowel Gas Movement
Two tracking points were placed on the prostate-rectal wall boundary (red) and pubic bone (black)
on the cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track motion during treatment. Significant
anterior-posterior deviation (up to 1.0 cm) was observed at the tracking point placed at the prostate-
rectum boundary, indicating repetitive prostate movement caused by gas motion. As a control, the
point placed on the pubic bone demonstrated minimal motion.
Discussion
This clinical vignette presents one of the major challenges with SBRT delivery in prostate
cancer – rectal distension leading to inaccurate treatment delivery. At our institution, linear
accelerator-based prostate SBRT employs both CBCT and stereoscopic x-ray imaging for image
guidance [1]. After the attending radiation oncologist evaluates the anatomy on CBCT prior to
treatment delivery initiation, a verification of alignment with intraprostatic fiducial markers
placed at the time of CT simulation is performed with stereoscopic x-ray imaging. The
treatment is subsequently delivered using four half arcs with volumetric-modulated arc therapy
(VMAT). Prior to every half arc being administered, stereoscopic imaging verification is
performed to ensure optimal prostate alignment. Using this technique, our institution and
others have reported little long-term difference in the quality of life analyses evaluating
urinary and bowel domains as compared to prior to treatment [2].
However, there has been the suggestion of increased late toxicity when not utilizing similar
image guidance techniques, in particular in the high-risk prostate cancer setting. This includes
a Canadian prospective phase I/II study of prostate SBRT, which reported that 30% of men had
grade two or greater gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity at six months [3].
Notably, patients in this study did not have fiducials placed or stereoscopic imaging during
treatment delivery (only a CBCT prior to treatment). While nodal volumes were treated in this
study, our institutional prospective phase II protocol of SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer,
including nodal treatment, has found far more favorable toxicity, including late grade two GU
and GI toxicity of 4.5% and 13.6%, respectively [4].

 While prostate fiducial placement for the utilization of stereoscopic x-ray imaging appears to
be a valuable technique for limiting the late toxicities of prostate cancer, there are situations in
which fiducial placement may be contraindicated. For example, some patients may be unable to
temporarily suspend anticoagulation for fiducial placement without an unacceptably high risk
of thromboembolic events. Also, some patients may have an increased risk of infection due to
comorbidities, including immunosuppression. Other patients may have already developed a
serious infection following prostate biopsy, making further perineal manipulation with fiducial
placement a less attractive option. In addition, some patients may desire a fully non-invasive
treatment for prostate cancer.
In this case, our patient had a prohibitive fear of prostate fiducial placement. MRI-guided
treatment with the tri-cobalt-60 head radiotherapy system provided a platform to administer
radiation accurately in a completely non-invasive format. Also, this treatment provided further
insight into the significant prostate motion that can occur during treatment. While this was
known previously from studies performed with the Calypso system [5], this case report directly
illustrates that intermittent rectal distension due to bowel gas may result in significant
inaccuracies in dose delivery. While translational or rotational changes are appreciated with the
Calypso system, prostate deformation is only directly evaluable with real-time MRI guidance.
While our protocol is to perform stereoscopic localization after every half arc with our linear
accelerator-based SBRT treatment, a significant deviation may be occurring during each half arc
delivery. These deviations may be clinically significant in some patients, potentially resulting
in the grade two toxicities seen with our own institutional protocol and the more significant
late toxicities observed in the Canadian trial when no intrafraction imaging verification was
used. Rectal distension may perhaps even result in an elevated local failure rate given the
under-dosing of the PTV. Importantly, a rectal balloon has been reported to reduce
intrafraction prostate motion [6-7], with hydrogel spacer performing similarly in a comparative
study [8]. Either technique may serve to improve SBRT delivery, albeit with greater invasiveness
added to the treatment.
Several limitations of this treatment protocol are important to note. First, some patients may
not be candidates for MRI-based imaging with the tri-cobalt-60 head radiotherapy system,
including those who are pacemaker-dependent or who have artificial hip instrumentation
causing significant image distortions. Second, while cine MRI imaging may improve accurate
treatment delivery, there are greater dosimetric limitations of tri-cobalt-60 head-based
treatment delivery as compared to linear accelerator-based dosimetry, potentially limiting the
improvement that this system may have for treatment delivery accuracy. An MRI-guided linear
accelerator-based treatment delivery system may improve this limitation. Third, the use of
MRI-based intrafraction imaging is time-consuming, as it extends the treatment delivery time
when the treatment is halted due to rectal distension. As such, a more reliable real-time
treatment adaptation of the delivery system to account for prostate motion is essential to
optimize both treatment accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the spatial resolution of imaging
is 1.5 mm, which results in a geometric distortion of less than 1 mm at a 10-cm radius from the
isocenter and 1-2 mm at a 17.5-cm radius [9]. While encouraging, improvements in both spatial
resolution and geometric distortion will aid in more accurate treatment delivery, which is
especially important in SBRT treatment courses.
Conclusions
SBRT is an increasingly common treatment for prostate cancer, and optimal image guidance is
essential for accurate treatment delivery to maximize efficacy and minimize the toxicity profile.
As an alternative to invasive fiducial or electromagnetic transponder placement, non-invasive
real-time intrafraction cine MRI can optimize the accuracy of treatment delivery. The
implementation of both MRI-guided radiation therapy and real-time dose delivery adaptation
to prostate motion may improve the efficacy and efficiency of treatment delivery.
