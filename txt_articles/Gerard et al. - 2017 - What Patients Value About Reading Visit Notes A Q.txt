Abstract
Background: Patients are increasingly asking for their health data. Yet, little is known about what motivates patients to engage
with the electronic health record (EHR). Furthermore, quality-focused mechanisms for patients to comment about their records
are lacking.
Objective: We aimed to learn more about patient experiences with reading and providing feedback on their visit notes.
Methods: We developed a patient feedback tool linked to OpenNotes as part of a pilot quality improvement initiative focused
on patient engagement. Patients who had appointments with members of 2 primary care teams piloting the program between
August 2014-2015 were eligible to participate. We asked patients what they liked about reading notes and about using a feedback
tool and analyzed all patient reports submitted during the pilot period. Two researchers coded the qualitative responses (κ=.74).
Results: Patients and care partners submitted 260 reports. Among these, 98.5% (256/260) of reports indicated that the reporting
tool was valuable, and 68.8% (179/260) highlighted what patients liked about reading notes and the OpenNotes patient reporting
tool process. We identified 4 themes describing what patients value about note content: confirm and remember next steps, quicker
access and results, positive emotions, and sharing information with care partners; and 4 themes about both patients’ use of notes
and the feedback tool: accuracy and correcting mistakes, partnership and engagement, bidirectional communication and enhanced
education, and importance of feedback.
Conclusions: Patients and care partners who read notes and submitted feedback reported greater engagement and the desire to
help clinicians improve note accuracy. Aspects of what patients like about using both notes as well as a feedback tool highlight
personal, relational, and safety benefits. Future efforts to engage patients through the EHR may be guided by what patients value,
offering opportunities to strengthen care partnerships between patients and clinicians.

Introduction
As the trend toward greater transparency accelerates in health
care, clinicians with electronic health records (EHRs) and patient
portals are inviting patients to view online laboratory results,
medication lists, and more recently, visit notes [1-2]. Health
care consumers are seeking more data [3], but little is known
about their experiences reading and using this information. A
better understanding of what motivates patients to interact with
their health data may inform efforts that promote patient
engagement through patient portals. Thoughtful EHR and patient

 portal design may be leveraged to strengthen patient and
family-centered care and patient-clinician relationships [4-8].
Although clinicians often report negative experiences with the
EHR, patient attitudes about the EHR may be more neutral or
even positive [9-11]. Greater health information transparency,
more rapid communication, patient-friendly educational
resources, and easier access to the medical record can send a
powerful message of inclusivity to patients and families. What
was once the purview of clinicians alone is increasingly shared
with patients and families and can lead to better informed shared
decision making [12]. Today, over 15 million patients in 40
states have easy access to their visit notes (OpenNotes) through
their patient portal [13]. As OpenNotes spreads, sharing health
information shows promise not only for patient engagement
and adherence [14-16], but also for relational benefits such as
enhanced patient trust and satisfaction [17,18].
Even though millions of patients can log on to patient portals
to read notes, we understand little about what they value in
doing so, perhaps because information sharing has been largely
one-way and passive. Opportunities to more effectively connect
with various patient populations and family care partners through
shared notes are vast, but relatively under-explored [19-22],
and patients, families, and communities remain a largely
untapped resource as health partners [8]. As patients increasingly
gain access to visit notes, they may uncover errors or
discrepancies in their records, and they generally lack a
systematic way to report this feedback [23]. Tools to guide
patients on their health data and systems to efficiently and
effectively hear their feedback are needed.
To learn more about the patient experiences with their notes,
we piloted an online OpenNotes patient reporting tool as part
of a quality improvement initiative [23]. In a 12-month test, we
asked patients to report possible inaccuracies in notes. In
addition to characterizing patient-identified errors [23], we
aimed to understand whether patients thought reading notes and
providing feedback was valuable, and if so, why. We envisioned
that what patients and care partners value about interacting with
their notes could inform organizational patient engagement
strategies and further drive patient and family-centered care.
This paper focuses on their qualitative responses.
Methods
The OpenNotes Patient Reporting Tool
The patient reporting tool was designed together with patients
and family members, as well as with Patient Relations and
Health Information Management personnel, Patient Safety
leadership, 
clinicians, 
and 
other 
stakeholders. 
This
multidisciplinary team of stakeholders met every other week
for nine months to plan the reporting tool and supporting patient
education materials, including a patient FAQ specifically
designed for the project [23]. These materials underwent several
iterations after review by our team, a plain language specialist,
and several additional PFAC members who tested the tool and
education links. The final patient reporting tool was a 9-item
form accessible through a “My Feedback” link located at the
end of each visit note. Participants had to first read the note in
order to use the reporting tool. Either patients or their care
partners (CPs) could complete the form. Questions included
whether patients (or CPs) understood the note and care plan,
identified possible inaccuracies in the note, had positive
feedback for their providers, and found the reporting tool
valuable.
Respondents who found the opportunity to read and provide
feedback on notes to be “very valuable” or “somewhat valuable”
were asked: “What do you like about reading or providing
feedback on your note?” We chose this broad exploratory
question intentionally because there is little existing data on
why patients engage with their health data, how they feel about
reading notes, or what benefits they may perceive from a
feedback tool linked to their notes. We used this expansive
approach because we did not have a preference regarding
whether patients responded to their attitudes about reading notes
or about using the reporting tool, given that both could inform
patient engagement strategies. We anticipated there would be
some overlap in responses since patients had to read notes in
order to use the tool, but we also hypothesized that some patients
may value reading notes alone, and simply use the tool to share
this information. Finally, although we considered asking two
separate questions, we prioritized streamlining open-ended
questions to prevent losing patient interest in completing the
form. We anticipated that results from a single exploratory
question could then inform more specific future queries as well
as targeted interventions to further engage patients and care
partners, based on what matters to them the most.
Participants
All patients with portal access and a visit note by a participating
provider during August 2014-August 2015 were invited to
participate in the feedback project. Patients received an email
notification when a note became available including a link to
frequently asked questions (FAQ) [23] and a dedicated email
address for any project-related concerns. Patients were told that
“The goal (of the project) is to help patients and their providers
work together to make sure the information in each patient’s
medical record is accurate and care is the best it can be. We also
hope to learn what patients like about reading their notes.”
Patients were also told that at the end of the QI project, all
comments would be de-identified and used to promote
organizational learning and quality improvements.
We launched the pilot quality improvement (QI) project with
clinicians from 2 of 10 teams in our hospital-based primary care
practice. OpenNotes was already implemented at our
organization and providers were offered the opportunity to
opt-out of participation. As part of the OpenNotes policies at
our medical center, clinicians can also “hide” individual notes,
such that they do not appear on the portal, although <1% do so
(personal communication, Lawrence Markson, MD, Vice
President, Clinical Information Systems, BIDMC). All other
notes generated by the participating providers included the “My
Feedback” link and an invitation for patients to use it.
Analysis
Two researchers (SKB and MG) independently reviewed and
coded a subset of responses to identify common themes.

 Through discussion, the two researchers merged the themes to
develop a codebook, and then coded another subset of responses.
Each subset comprised an independent (ie, not previously coded)
10-20% of the data. They repeated this process until no new
themes were found. All disagreements were resolved through
discussion. Next, the researchers used the codebook to separately
code another set of responses and tested reliability between the
two researchers (κ=.74). Finally, one researcher (MG) coded
the remaining responses using the same codebook.
Ethics
The proposal for implementation and evaluation of the
OpenNotes patient reporting tool was reviewed by our
institutional review board and determined to be a quality
improvement program. Data collected were integrated into
existing QI workflows and used in real time to improve care.
Patient participation was voluntary. Patients were told that they,
and their provider, might be contacted by Patient Relations
personnel if their report pointed to a safety concern. Otherwise,
the data populated an aggregate database from which we
generated de-identified comments for this analysis. We informed
patients that de-identified comments would be used to promote
organizational learning and quality improvements. Further
details of the methods and patient communications have been
published elsewhere [23].
Results
We analyzed consecutive reports submitted by patients and care
partners over the 12 months of the pilot period. In total, 260
reports were submitted; of which, 256 (98.5%) reports indicated
that the tool was valuable, and 179 (68.8%) reports included a
qualitative response to what patients liked about the OpenNotes
reporting tool process. Compared with patients who submitted
a report but did not respond to the voluntary qualitative question,
patients who provided a response were slightly older; otherwise
patient characteristics were not significantly different between
the two groups (data not shown). Responses highlighted a total
of 8 key themes, presented below. Four themes pertained to
what patients value about the content of notes, and the other
four described what patients liked about using the reporting tool
(for which reading notes was implicit).
What Patients Value About Note Content
Confirm and Remember Next Steps
For many participants, notes served as an extension of the visit.
One patient noted:
I sometimes have white coat syndrome where I am a
little nervous in the doctor’s office and then cannot
remember all that was said. Reading the notes after
my visits confirms what I have heard.
By far the most common theme, reading visit notes helped
patients to better remember next steps. Many commented on
turning to notes as a reminder of tests or other recommended
follow-up.
Several participants alluded to the stressful nature of the visit:
I think it is a great way to double check I didn't miss
anything if I was not feeling well or was too
overwhelmed.
Patients liked reviewing what happened at the visit in the
comfort (and pace) of their own homes:
Reading the note takes the burden off of me to
remember the details of what we discussed and
becomes a useful reference for me.
They also liked the ability to confirm or double-check the
doctor’s recommendations independently:
If I forget something, I can go back and read the plan
without having to bother the doc[tor].
Quicker Access and Results
Patients and CPs valued the opportunity to have access to
records and results, stressing the importance of being able to
view this information quickly and at any time. Participants found
the notes particularly valuable because they provided context.
One patient commented:
I like knowing what the results of my tests mean. The
records [laboratory results] show the numbers but
the notes provide the interpretation in regards to my
personal health status.
Participants also liked having longitudinal access to notes, and
the benefits of a consolidated reference, “all in one place.” Like
an “encyclopedia on a shelf,” OpenNotes provided patients with
a cohesive roadmap over the arc of their health journey:
It is now all on record for me to review…and not just
after the consult. Allows for history.”
Patients noted a heightened sense of ownership of their records
and their health when they could review and interact with their
notes collectively and comprehensively over time:
Doctors’ notes are my medical history and until
OpenNotes patients had no insight into what is
ultimately my medical history.
Positive Emotions
Reading notes helped patients gain confidence in their providers,
“confirm[ing] that…care is being handled well.” It also
generated additional positive emotions like hope and
encouragement. One patient wrote, “I like reading my notes
because they keep me uplifted.” Another added, “I feel less
helpless and perhaps more hopeful.” Participants highlighted
the relational benefits of “being heard.” Their comments
described a powerful “validation” from reading notes, and
feeling listened to and cared for:
We have had a funeral and a hectic week. I felt like
someone cared. May seem quite simple but it was a
nice human touch. I am a nurse and I am impressed.
Sharing Information With Care Partners
The invitation to read notes and provide feedback was
particularly appreciated by care partners who support vulnerable
patients. In particular, they found notes essential to the
coordination of care for their loved ones:

 We are grateful to receive “notes” to be able to
review the visit and procedures (if any) performed.
Especially helpful for older patients who may have
hearing and/or some cognitive [or] memory loss.
Patients liked the option to give their note to care partners too:
“I like that I'm able to share how my visit was,” and “I can
reference info[rmation] to inform my family [and/or] wife [of]
what is going on.” Another patient added, “I don't have to take
tons of notes myself…to make sure I understood.” OpenNotes
connected care partners with information that they may not have
otherwise had access to, and provided a way for them to stay
updated on medication or treatment plan changes.
What Patients Value About Their Use of Notes and
the Reporting Tool
Accuracy and Correcting Mistakes
Patients and care partners commonly noted that what they like
about reading notes and providing feedback is the new ability
to confirm the accuracy of the note and catch potential errors.
As one patient noted, “I like to see that my medical records as
embodied in the notes are consistent with the conversation I
have had with my doctor.” Another noted, “I appreciate the
open exchange and the opportunity to correct any possible
misunderstandings.” Finally, some patients liked testing the
accuracy of their own communication, welcoming the
opportunity to clarify misunderstandings about their report of
symptoms or history through the tool.
[Reading] my notes allows me to see how well I am
communicating my issues, which leads to how well
my doctors are hearing and documenting my issues.
It also allows me to catch errors.
While some clinicians worry that patient-found mistakes may
lead to casting blame or trust erosion, several participants
explicitly commented on understanding human fallibility and
wanting to play a role, alongside their provider, in contributing
to note precision: “It is easy to make a mistake when writing a
note. I like that they can be reviewed for accuracy.” Another
added: “We can work together to make notes accurate,
understood, and…a good resource for future medical care.”
Partnership and Engagement
Patients frequently noted that they liked reading notes to
“[Make] sure that we are on the same page,” and that the
feedback tool enhanced a sense of partnership with their
clinicians. Participants described notes as a window into how
their provider thinks:
I like that level of communication and the ability to
see the doctor’s thought process. The more open
communication there is, the better care I, as an active
participant, have access to.
Patients also saw engagement through OpenNotes and the
reporting tool as a two-way street:
Reading the notes can only make me come to my
appointments better prepared and help my team
understand what issues are important to me and what
I need them to hear.
Moving away from the traditional paternalistic view of medicine,
the reporting tool encouraged shared agency for health: “It puts
me in an active rather than passive position and cuts out red
tape.” Several responses addressed the value of inviting patients
to provide input. One participant noted, “Health care should
be a two-way conversation; this forum provides another
opportunity for that.” Another commented, “[The note] helps
me feel that my [doctor] and I are partners in promoting my
health.”
Finally, several patients and CPs commented on the level of
detail, articulation, and precision in the notes. The
comprehensive nature of notes helped patients feel that their
provider “knows” and cares about them, strengthening a
therapeutic alliance through shared values and goals.
Bidirectional Communication and Enhanced Education
Patients and CPs often described reading notes as playing a
significant role in improving communication between patients
and providers, while also increasing learning. As one patient
stated, “It is an opportunity to become more knowledgeable
about my condition and how I can manage it better.” Patients
and care partners emphasized the power of print, indicating that
some learning styles favor written information, and the
importance of an enduring reference: “I very much appreciate
the opportunity to see again in writing what was discussed.”
Patients also reported feeling more informed and gaining a better
understanding of their health condition as a result of reading
notes, and that the reporting tool extended “teach-back”
opportunities from providers to patients, with an opportunity
for bidirectional communication:
I like the educational and improvement potential of
the process. I learn. My provider learns. All good.
Several reports also emphasized that reading notes and providing
feedback affords patients a way to share information without
bothering their providers: “It allows more frequent non-intrusive
communication with doctor.” Patients liked the chance for “no
embarrassing face to face asking of questions if [they] want to
understand or know more.”
Importance of Feedback
Patients embraced the opportunity for feedback on many levels:
receiving feedback about their health and how they are doing
in various aspects of their care, and giving feedback to their
providers. Many patients liked the tool because it offered a new
way to share positive feedback: “I appreciate the opportunity
to praise my healthcare providers.” Others saw the tool as a
safe haven for feedback:
This is a way to [confidentially] reflect a patient’s
reaction to a provider without “causing trouble.” I
will use it a lot.
Another noted:
This new project, [OpenNotes] Feedback, is terrific.
Finally. Because it is [confidential] I will use it with
a mental comfort I have not had till now—over 10
years.

 Some patients read notes as a self-feedback mechanism—a way
to check how well they were communicating and understood
by their providers.
Patients also valued feedback as a way to contribute to the note,
for example adding missing information patients found
important. Several comments reflected an understanding of
quality improvement and a desire to participate in making care
better: “Having the opportunity to provide feedback is important
to moving the program forward and helps stimulate innovation.”
Patients appreciated being asked for their input, irrespective of
whether they identified a potential safety concern in their note:
I am happy that you asked for feedback—if only so
that I can say how helpful it is and how pleased I am
to have this site available to me.
As above, patient comments drew a link between the invitation
for feedback and the effect of inclusivity on strengthening
patient-clinician relationships:
Being able to provide feedback is very important to
me as well. I feel it keeps me connected to my health
care providers.
Discussion
Principal Findings and Implications
With little knowledge on what motivates patients to engage with
their health data, we sought to characterize what patients value
about reading visit notes as part of a quality improvement
initiative. Our findings highlight several insights. Patients and
care partners described priorities that can be leveraged to design
patient portals that better support patients and families while
improving quality of care. For example, participants liked
reading notes to remember and confirm next steps. They felt
less overwhelmed and more proactive in their care as a result
of reading notes. Patients valued the ability to go back to their
health information at their own pace and leisure as an enduring,
longitudinal resource; open bidirectional dialogue with clinicians
and the ability to ask questions with “non-embarrassing” face
to face dynamics; and quicker access to notes and results, an
established ambulatory care safety priority [20]. Additionally,
patients reported developing a greater understanding of their
condition from reading notes and liked learning about “the
doctor’s thought process.” Taken together, the specific features
that patients valued have direct implications for strengthened
shared decision making and informed consent [12,24,25].
Participants also particularly valued the ability to check note
accuracy and to share notes with family care partners. A
feedback mechanism that encourages commentary from patients
and care partners, who may catch possible documentation errors
or clinically important oversights in the notes, may also improve
portals and care. Poor electronic health record interoperability
is a recognized problem [26], medication errors are frequent,
and missing information poses a safety threat, particularly for
vulnerable patients with complex care needs. As supporting
family care partners of older or vulnerable patients becomes a
health care priority [21], OpenNotes and the reporting tool may
empower care partners with health information and provide a
space for their feedback. Though some studies question whether
patients would be willing to identify errors [27], our findings
resonate with recent reports showing that patients and families
can recognize quality problems [28,29], and suggest that at least
some patients and care partners particularly value working
alongside their providers to ensure their records are accurate.
Shifting the nexus of control away from clinicians alone to one
that is shared with patients and families and reflects their values
has been described in the literature as patient-centered care,
person-centered care, and relationship-centered care, among
other terms [8,30]. Here, we refer to “patient and family-centered
care” although several of the other terms also apply. In our
findings, patients suggested that an invitation to read notes and
use the reporting tool sends a message of inclusivity and
empowerment, validating patients as capable change agents.
Such 
comments resonate with 
experts’ 
support 
for
“democratization of health care,” shifting traditional power
relationships in medicine, and bringing patient and family voices
more consistently to health decisions, system design and patient
activation tools so that they can engage in ways that “matter
most to them” [8,12]. Inviting patients and families to read notes
and give feedback helps to level the playing field, providing
more information needed for participation in care. Recognizing
that while some patients want to be included in decision-making
and treated as experts or safety partners regarding their own
experience [31], not all patients desire this degree of engagement
[32], and hence the evolution of patient portals should work
toward closing the digital divide while respecting individuals’
choices. As information transparency spreads, our findings can
help inform patient and family-centered strategies that further
engage those patients who seek their health data (Table 1).
Portals and electronic information are never a substitute for
meaningful face-to-face time with clinicians. But although
doctors worry that computer use during shorter visits can make
clinical interactions feel impersonal [33], patients who read
notes liked “feeling heard,” describing a deeper sense of caring
and respect, and improved patient-clinician relationships.
OpenNotes is not a solution for the shortcomings of the EHR,
but it may help make the computer feel like less of an obstacle
and more of a shared resource, particularly if clinicians turn it
toward patients’ view and actively invite them to read notes and
even provide feedback after the visit. Although some health
care providers worry that doing so may increase liability or
erode trust, our findings suggest that this innovation may
strengthen partnerships with clinicians, consistent with prior
studies and data in other fields suggesting that transparent
communication enhances trust [18,34].
The availability of notes may also make face-to-face time more
effective. Some patients felt more attentive or present during
visits because they didn’t need to take copious notes, knowing
they could access the documentation later. Because patients can
go back to notes repeatedly and at patients’ own leisure and
pace, reading notes may extend the visit, and clinicians may
find opportunities to take advantage of this extra “time with
patients.” With patients as a consistent audience to notes,
clinicians may even begin to adapt note-writing in the future to
be more personalized, trust-building, or even therapeutic [35].

Create mechanism for positive patient feedback; curb provider burnout
Finally, we were struck by patients’ interest in praising their
providers and their description of positive emotions stemming
from reading notes. At a time when clinician burnout is in the
spotlight [36,37], it is intriguing to consider the potential positive
relational effects of OpenNotes on both providers and patients.
Creating a space for patients to provide positive feedback for
clinicians may bolster morale and even influence positive culture
change if amplified across practice settings. Like clinicians,
patients and care partners too may be alienated, emotionally
distanced and exhausted from interactions with a fragmented
and depersonalized health care system [38]. Mechanical,
template notes with abundant copy and paste material may
exacerbate the problem, and OpenNotes may make this problem
more “visible.” On the other hand, restoring some patient
narrative to notes may help patients feel heard. Assimilation of
multiple visits through integrated note access on a single portal
may help unify the patient’s perception of care, particularly if
clinicians refer to each other’s notes, as patients learn about
how the team works together. Additionally, similar to
approaches to decrease burnout for clinicians, enhancing
meaningful connections between patients and providers through
supportive language in notes and a sense of belonging to the
team may be a valuable strategy.
Although these reports reflect the perspectives of patients and
care partners who are already engaged by reading notes,
organizational exploration of what patients value about note
transparency can have a large impact, considering that over 15
million patients have access to their notes across the country
today [13]. Building a system in which people want to engage
requires knowing what matters most to them. We were struck
that half of the themes described by patients reflected what
patients valued about reading notes alone, suggesting that simply
sharing notes (even without a patient reporting tool) can help
patients better remember the care plan, feel less overwhelmed,
gain quicker access to results, generate positive emotions, and
enable information sharing with care partners. The other
themes—ensuring note accuracy, enhanced engagement and
partnership, bidirectional communication and education, and
the opportunity for feedback and inclusivity—are also valued
by patients who read notes, and further strengthened by a patient
reporting tool. These can serve as important first steps to inform
patient engagement strategies through the patient portal (Table
1). Additional research and health literacy supports are needed
to learn what matters most to patients and families who are not
yet registered on patient portals and to make that information
accessible to them in meaningful ways.
Limitations
Our findings are limited by the small size of a pilot initiative at
a single institution. Respondents likely represent a self-selected
population, biased toward activated patients who are registered
on the patient portal, use OpenNotes, and are from one
geographic area. Patients at our medical center are largely white
and more likely to have a 4-year college degree or higher. This
quality improvement initiative was designed specifically for
one health care organization, limiting generalizability to other
patient populations. Although a formal analysis of additional

 sites is beyond the scope of this report, as the OpenNotes
reporting tool has expanded to other clinical settings and
organizations, we are seeing similar themes surface, reflecting
our findings.
Conclusion
In summary, as EHR transparency spreads, new ways for
patients to engage with their data in ways that matter to them
most and to comment on their records are needed. Many aspects
of what patients and care partners like about reading notes and
providing feedback have important implications for improving
patient and family-centered quality of care, safety, and
patient-clinician relationships, and can also inform future patient
engagement strategies and patient portal design.
