Association Between Method of Prescribing
and Primary Nonadherence to Dermatologic Medication
in an Urban Hospital Population
Adewole S. Adamson, MD, MPP; Elizabeth A. Suarez, MPH; April R. Gorman, MS
IMPORTANCE Prescription underuse is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. A significant
proportion of underuse is owing to primary nonadherence, defined as the rate at which
patients fail to fill and pick up new prescriptions. Although electronic prescribing increases
coordination of care and decreases errors, its effect on primary nonadherence is less certain.
OBJECTIVES To analyze factors associated with primary nonadherence to dermatologic
medications and study whether electronic prescribing affects rates of primary nonadherence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of medical records was
conducted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, among a cohort of new patients
prescribed dermatologic medications at a single, urban, safety-net hospital outpatient
dermatology clinic.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the overall rate of primary
nonadherence, defined as filling and picking up all prescribed medications within a 1-year
period, and the difference in primary nonadherence between patients who received
electronic prescriptions and those who received paper prescriptions. Secondary outcomes
included the association of primary nonadherence with sex, age, relationship status, primary
language, race/ethnicity, and number of prescriptions.
RESULTS A total of 4318 prescriptions were written for 2496 patients (mean [SD] age,
47.7 [13.2] years; 849 men and 1647 women). The overall rate of primary nonadherence was
31.6% (n = 788). Based on multivariable analysis, the risk of primary nonadherence was 16
percentage points lower among patients given an electronic prescription (15.2%) than
patients given a paper prescription (31.5%). Primary nonadherence decreased with age
(<30 y, 38.9%; 30-49 y, 35.3%; and 50-69 y, 26.3%), and then increased in elderly patients
70 years and older (31.9%). Of patients who were given 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 prescriptions, rates of
primary nonadherence were 33.1%, 28.8%, 26.4%, 39.8%, and 38.1%, respectively. Primary
nonadherence decreased with age but then increased in elderly patients. Patients identifying
English as their primary language had the highest rate of primary nonadherence (33.9%)
compared with Spanish (29%) or other speakers (20.4%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with paper prescriptions, electronic prescriptions
were associated with less primary nonadherence. Number of prescriptions, language,
race/ethnicity, and age were associated with increased rates of primary nonadherence.
Efforts must be made to understand why primary nonadherence occurs, identify patients
prone to primary nonadherence, and simplify medication regimens to maximize adherence
and quality of care.

A
s the health care system in the United States has
increasingly moved to the use of electronic medical
records, electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) has
become an important part of improving quality of care and
the patient experience. Electronic prescribing increases
coordination between pharmacist and physician and can
decrease prescription errors.1,2 However, it is less certain
how e-prescribing affects the rate at which patients fill (pri-
mary adherence) or do not fill (primary nonadherence) their
new prescriptions.3
Although it may seem intuitive that primary adherence
would increase by removing the patient from the prescription-
to-pharmacy routing process, few studies have compared pri-
mary nonadherence of patients given traditional paper pre-
scriptions vs e-prescriptions. Of these studies, there have been
mixed results regarding the use of e-prescriptions, with some
showing increased primary adherence, others showing de-
creased primary adherence, and still others showing no
difference.4-7
Understanding the epidemiologic factors of prescrip-
tions is important because underuse of prescription medica-
tionscontinuestobeaproblem.Underuseofprescriptionmedi-
cations has been linked to poorer patient outcomes and
increased health care costs.8 Most studies examining nonad-
herence focus on medication use patterns among patients who
have already filled their prescriptions.9-14 Fewer studies fo-
cus strictly on primary nonadherence. In dermatology, only a
few, mostly small studies have specifically investigated pri-
mary nonadherence.15-17
In this study, we measure primary nonadherence to der-
matologic medications by examining prescription data from
a large, urban county hospital system with an enclosed pre-
scription environment. Patient and prescription characteris-
tics were evaluated to assess factors associated with primary
nonadherence.
Methods
PatientsontheParklandHealthPlus(PHP)program,ataxpayer-
subsidized health insurance program for uninsured, low-
income residents of Dallas County, Texas, were included in this
study. As part of PHP, patients receive a prescription drug ben-
efit at considerably reduced cost if they fill their prescrip-
tions through a closed pharmacy system. Data from the closed
pharmacy system were linked with the electronic medical rec-
ord system of Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas,
Texas, for this analysis. Only new patients at PHP seen by a der-
matologistintheoutpatientdermatologyclinicatParklandMe-
morial Hospital were included. New patients were defined by
not having a visit to the clinic in the prior 3 years. The index
visit was defined as a visit by a new patient occurring from
January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, during which 1 or more
dermatologic medications were prescribed. Patients were ex-
cluded if they did not have a medication prescribed at their
visit.Nonformularymedicationswereexcludedfromtheanaly-
sis. Patients’age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, relation-
ship status (married, common law, or significant relationship
[eg, domestic partnership or civil union] vs divorced, legally
separated,single,orwidowed),primarylanguagespoken,num-
ber of dermatologic prescriptions, type of prescription given
(electronic or paper), and date of medication pick-up were ex-
tracted from the linked electronic medical record and phar-
macy record.
Primary nonadherence was defined as not filling and pick-
ing up all dermatologic prescriptions obtained during the in-
dex visit within 1 year of the prescription date. Adherence was
further classified as full adherence (filling all prescriptions),
some adherence (filling some but not all prescriptions), and
complete nonadherence (filling none of the prescriptions).
Demographic and prescription characteristics and their crude
association with primary nonadherence were assessed using
Mantel-Haenszel general association tests for categorical vari-
ablesandanalysisofvarianceforcontinuousvariables.Weused
linear regression models (with identity and log link func-
tions) to estimate crude and adjusted risk differences and risk
ratioswith95%CIsfortheriskofprimarynonadherenceamong
patients with e-prescriptions vs paper prescriptions. The vari-
ables included in the analysis were age, sex, race/ethnicity,
marital status, and primary language spoken. Kaplan-Meier
product limit survival curves were created for time (in days)
until all prescriptions were filled. Data management and analy-
sis was performed with SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
The study was approved by the University of Texas South-
westernMedicalCenterInstitutionalReviewBoard.Owingtothe
retrospective nature of the study, patient consent was not nec-
essary.Adatauseagreementwasalsoapprovedforuseofthede-

Results
Atotalof2496patientsmettheinclusioncriteriaandwerepre-
scribed a total of 4318 medications for dermatologic condi-
tions, at a mean of 1.7 prescriptions per patient. The mean (SD)
age of patients was 47.7 (13.2) years, and the majority were
women (1647 [66%]). Consistent with the population served
by this health system, nearly half of patients (1220 [48.9%])
were Hispanic, and the rest were black (654 [26.2%]), white
(443 [17.7%]), or other race/ethnicity (179 [7.2%]). The most
common primary language was English (1468 [58.8%]), fol-
lowed by Spanish (920 [36.9%]) (Table 1). Most encounters
involved printed prescriptions (1693 [67.8%]). Overall, 3254
Key Points
Question Are patients more likely to fill and pick up medications if
they receive a paper prescription or an electronic prescription?
Findings In this record review of 2496 patients with a highly
subsidized pharmaceutical benefit plan seen at the dermatology
clinic of a county hospital, there was a 47% reduction in primary
nonadherence if the prescription was in electronic format
compared with a paper prescription.
Meaning Patients are more likely to fill and pick up medications if
they are prescribed in an electronic format.

prescriptions (75.4%) were filled and picked up. The patient-
level primary adherence rate was 68.4% (n = 1708). Of the pa-
tients who were nonadherent, 169 (6.8%) filled and picked up
some of their prescriptions while 619 (24.8%) filled and picked
up none.
Sex and relationship status were not associated with a dif-
ference in primary nonadherence. Rates of primary nonad-
herence decreased with increasing age (<30 years, 67 of 231
[29%]; 30-49 years, 295 of 1100 [26.8%]; 50-69 years, 237 of
1096 [21.6%]; and ≥70 years, 20 of 69 [29%]). Patients who did
not speak English had lower rates of primary nonadherence
(Spanish, 221 of 920 [24%]; other language, 20 of 108 [18.5%])
compared with those who identified English as their primary
language (378 of 1468 [25.7%]). Hispanic patients had the high-
est full adherence rate (858 of 1220 [70.3%]) of any racial/
ethnic group (Table 2).

Theriskofprimarynonadherencewas17percentagepoints
loweramongpatientsgivenane-prescriptionthanpatientsgiven
a paper prescription. This difference was 16 percentage points
in the adjusted analysis. This finding represents a 47% reduc-
tion in the risk of primary nonadherence for patients who re-
ceivedane-prescriptionvsthosewhoreceivedapaperprescrip-
tion. Patients with paper prescriptions had a higher proportion
of full adherence in the first 4 days after the prescription was
issued, but after this point, patients with e-prescriptions were
much more likely to be fully adherent (Figure).
Primary adherence was 66.9% (864 of 1291) when 1 pre-
scription was given and increased to 71.2% (553 of 777) when
2 and 73.6% (201 of 273) when 3 prescriptions were given; how-
ever, primary adherence declined to 60.2% (77 of 128) when
4 prescriptions were given (Table 3).
Discussion
Inthisstudymeasuringratesofprimarynonadherencetomedi-
cations prescribed by dermatologists, we found a 31.6% rate of
primary nonadherence, defined as failing to fill and pick up all
prescriptions within 1 year of receiving the prescriptions. This
rateisslightlygreaterthanthe20%to30%ratesofprimarynon-
adherence reported in previous studies specifically investigat-
ingdermatologicmedications.15-17However,someofthesestud-
ieswerelimitedbyself-reportedresponsebias,whichcouldhave
underestimated the level of primary nonadherence. In fact,

marynonadherenceof6.2%,whenpharmacyrecordswereque-
riedforexternalvalidation,ratesofprimarynonadherencewere

over, unlike many primary nonadherence studies, our unit of

to dermatological medications of 31.2% reported by Fischer et
al,18 27.8% reported by Tamblyn et al,19 and 29.2% reported by
Stormetal.17Thiscomparablelevelofprimarynonadherenceis
remarkablegiventhelow-incomedemographicofpatientsinour
study. Patients with lower incomes are often more sensitive to
prices, and our results are likely owing to the subsidized phar-
macy benefit received by patients for their medications.
Similar to Anderson et al,15 we found a decrease in pri-
mary nonadherence to dermatologic medication with use of
e-prescriptions.Wealsofoundthat,duringthefirst4daysfrom
the index visit, patients with paper prescriptions had a higher
rate of full adherence. Although this study was not designed
to establish a cause, it is possible that having a paper prescrip-
tion served as a tangible reminder for patients to fill and pick
up their prescription in the short term. However, in the lon-
ger term, lost or misplaced paper prescriptions could have led
to a diminished likelihood of full adherence.
The effect of e-prescribing on primary nonadherence has
been variable, with studies showing increased, decreased, or
unchanged rates of primary nonadherence.4-7 For example, in
a prospective study conducted in an emergency department,
while pharmacy wait times and patient satisfaction im-
proved, there was no difference in rates of primary nonadher-
ence between e-prescriptions and paper prescriptions.4 In an-
other example, a large cross-sectional cohort study examining
the characteristics of abandoned prescriptions showed that
e-prescriptions were more likely to be abandoned at the
pharmacy.6 It is possible that the variability in primary non-

adherence is owing to different populations being studied or
different study designs, such as reliance on patient self-
reports, for measuring rates of primary nonadherence.
Anotablefindingofourstudyisthedecreaseinratesofpri-
mary nonadherence when patients are given between 1 and 3
prescriptions, followed by an increase in rates of primary non-
adherence when they are given more than 3 prescriptions
(Table3).Thenumberofdispenseddrugsisassociatedwithpri-
mary nonadherence.20 Polypharmacy is a well-documented
problem in patients’compliance with complex treatment
regimens.21,22 Patients on the PHP plan pay $5 per prescrip-
tion,whichcouldexplainincreasednonadherencebeyond3pre-
scriptions. Cost is a major consideration for many patients. Up
to 32% of older patients take less medication than prescribed
to reduce costs.23 Although patients in our study are buffered
from high medication costs, multiple medications can be-
come financially burdensome.
Similar to other studies of primary nonadherence, we did
not find a sex difference in rates of primary nonadherence;
however, younger patients had higher rates of primary
nonadherence.15,18 In our study, Hispanic patients had among
thelowestrateofprimarynonadherence.Thisfindingisincon-
trast to other reports that show higher rates of primary non-
adherence among Hispanic patients.24,25 However, a similar
finding has been reported for rates of primary nonadherence
to cardiac medications within the PHP population.26 Adher-
ence is multifactorial and complex, but it is possible that ad-
herence of Hispanic patients is higher because Parkland Me-
morial Hospital has the infrastructure to accommodate the
needs of its high volume of Spanish-speaking patients. Socio-
cultural differences of non–English-speaking patients in their
trust of physician recommendations could also have posi-
tively influenced primary adherence.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. The insurance coverage
environment allowed for direct study of nonadherence;
however, this distinctiveness makes the study less general-
izable as it exclusively encompasses a population of poor
residents of Dallas County in one subspecialty clinic receiv-
ing a subsidized pharmacy benefit. Sixty-six percent of
study participants were female, and the racial demograph-
ics included 48.9% Hispanic and 26.2% black patients,
which may not be representative of other dermatology clin-
ics. It is possible that there were other factors not captured
in the data that could have resulted in the difference in
adherence rates. Misclassification of medications as unfilled
could have resulted if prescription adjustments were made
by telephone after initial visit. Finally, while this study
uncovered factors associated with primary nonadherence,
it was not designed to understand the reasons for patient
nonadherence.
Conclusions
Electronic prescribing has become one of the major criteria to
evaluate meaningful use of electronic health records by health
care professionals.27 In this study, we demonstrated that
e-prescribing is associated with reduced rates of primary non-
adherence. As the health care system transitions from paper
prescriptions to directly routed e-prescriptions, it will be im-
portant to understand how that experience affects patients,
particularly their likelihood of filling the prescriptions. Pri-
marynonadherenceisacommonandpervasiveproblem.Steps
should be taken to better understand why primary nonadher-
ence happens and how it can be improved.

NOTABLE NOTES
The History of John Hans Menkes and Kinky Hair Syndrome

tant mineral, explaining the symptoms that Menkes observed.3
Menkes is famous for other medical achievements, such as describ-
ing the first known cases of maple syrup urine disease while he was an
intern in 1954.1 This autosomal recessive disorder is due to a disruption
in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, leading to a buildup
of isoleucyl ketoacid that gives the urine its characteristic odor.
Menkes’s contributions to society were not limited to medicine, as
he was also highly regarded for his contributions to the humanities. His
passion for writing did not falter as he aged, and he wrote 3 novels and
3 plays that were produced in Los Angeles. One of these productions,
titled The Last Inquisitor, was a Holocaust drama that won a prestigious
Drama-LogueAward;thiswasatheaterawardforaplayselectedbythe-
ater critics of the Drama-Logue newspaper, a weekly west-coast the-
ater trade publication. In addition, Menkes served as an expert witness
for plaintiffs in trials involving damage resulting from vaccines and was
appointed to the National Institute of Medicine’s Forum for Vaccine
Safety.1
Menkes was named the director of pediatric neurology at Los An-
geles’ Cedar-Sinai Medical Center in 1997. He died of colon cancer and
complicationsofchemotherapyinNovemberof2008,1monthfromhis
80th birthday.
