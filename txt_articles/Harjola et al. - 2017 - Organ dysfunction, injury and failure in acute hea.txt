a smaller proportion presents with peripheral hypoperfusion or cardiogenic shock. Hypoperfusion further deteriorates organ function. The
injury and dysfunction of target organs (i.e. heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, intestine, brain) in the setting of AHF are associated with increased
risk for mortality. Improvement in organ function after decongestive therapies has been associated with a lower risk for post-discharge
mortality. Thus, the prevention and correction of organ dysfunction represent a therapeutic target of interest in AHF and should be evaluated
in clinical trials. Treatment strategies that specifically prevent, reduce or reverse organ dysfunction remain to be identified and evaluated
to determine if such interventions impact mortality, morbidity and patient-centred outcomes. This paper reflects current understanding
among experts of the presentation and management of organ impairment in AHF and suggests priorities for future research to advance
the field.

Introduction
Acute heart failure (AHF) is characterized by an acute or sub-
acute deterioration in cardiac function resulting from numer-
ous possible underlying heart diseases and precipitating factors.1
Congestion is the predominant clinical profile in most patients
with AHF; a smaller proportion presents with peripheral hypo-
perfusion or cardiogenic shock.1–3 Congestion or hypoperfusion
can lead to organ injury, impairment and, ultimately, the fail-
ure of target organs (i.e. heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, intestine,
brain), which are associated with increased mortality. Data sug-
gest that the correction and prevention of organ injury are asso-
ciated with better outcomes.4 Thus, the prevention and correc-
tion of organ dysfunction have evolved as therapeutic targets
of interest in AHF and should be further evaluated in clinical
trials.5
The pathophysiology behind organ injury in AHF remains
incompletely understood. Elderly patients with co-morbidities
are especially predisposed to organ injury.6 Treatment strate-
gies that prevent, reduce or reverse organ injury need to be
tested for their effects on morbidity, mortality and patient-centred
outcomes. The Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the Euro-
pean Society of Cardiology (ESC) convened a multidisciplinary
group of experts to discuss existing knowledge and emerg-
ing evidence regarding organ injury in AHF and its associated
pathophysiology, clinical assessment, management and research
needs.
Pathophysiological mechanisms
of organ injury in acute heart
failure
Acute heart failure is a heterogeneous syndrome. Patients with de
novo AHF may have fluid overload less often, whereas those with
worsening chronic heart failure (CHF) more commonly have fluid
excess. The ESC heart failure guidelines classify patients based on
the presence of congestion and/or hypoperfusion.1 The ‘
wet and
warm’(congestion without hypoperfusion) presentation is most
commonly encountered (in more than 90% of cases)1 and is the
focus of this manuscript.

Haemodynamic mechanisms
of organ injury
Congestion caused by elevated filling
pressure
In AHF, blood remains upstream of the ventricles, which results
in increased filling pressures (i.e. congestion) that impair organ
function. Pulmonary congestion and pulmonary oedema occur
when blood remains upstream of the left ventricle because of
elevated left atrial pressure, whereas congestion of organs in the
abdominal cavity ensues when blood remains upstream of the right
ventricle (Figure 1).7–9 Pulmonary and organ congestion may occur
separately or simultaneously. In addition, increased intra-abdominal
pressure as a result of organ congestion and/or ascites may further
contribute to injury or impairment of the end-organs impacted by
these increased pressures.
Congestion indicates excessive vascular filling of the central
venous system. Filling pressure depends on venous compliance
and capacitance,10 plasma volume and cardiac function. Indeed,
the transition from CHF to AHF is often attributed to increased
sodium avidity and extracellular volume overload, leading to a pro-
gressive increase in cardiac filling pressures.11–13 However, filling
pressure is a poor surrogate for volume overload. In one study,
54% of patients hospitalized for AHF gained ≤0.9 kg during the
30 days prior to admission,14 suggesting that volume overload
incompletely characterizes the pathophysiology of AHF. Addition-
ally, weight loss during hospitalization is not necessarily always asso-
ciated with improved in-hospital or post-discharge morbidity or
mortality.15
Consequently,
it
has
been
suggested
that
redistribution
(from venous capacitance beds to the central venous system)
rather than absolute volume overload may be a frequent
cause of increased cardiac filling pressures.16–19 The abdom-
inal compartment probably plays an important role in this as
the splanchnic venous system contains 25% of total blood
volume.18 It normally pools and releases blood in order to
maintain an optimal cardiac preload. Splanchnic arterioles and
veins are very sensitive to changes in sympathetic activity.16
Increased sympathetic output leads to splanchnic arterial and
venous constriction and blood redistribution from the splanchnic

capacitance vasculature to circulatory volume, which increases
venous return and raises cardiac filling pressures.16,
18 Indeed,
this capacitance function becomes compromised during states
of longstanding venous congestion and/or increased sympathetic
activation in AHF.18,
20 Failure of the abdominal compartment
buffer systems may ultimately result in a cardio–abdominal–renal
syndrome.17,

21
Organ hypoperfusion
Acute heart failure with a clinical profile of low cardiac output and
subsequent organ hypoperfusion (cold–dry or cold–wet1) is much
less common than a profile of congestion with normal perfusion.
It is usually associated with low systolic blood pressure (<90
mmHg) and mean arterial pressure (<65 mmHg) (i.e. cardiogenic
shock). Incidences of cardiogenic shock are 5.7–10.1% in acute
myocardial infarction22,
23 and approximately 4% in AHF.1,
2,
24 The
aetiology of cardiogenic shock is acute coronary syndrome in 80%
of cases.25
Perfusion that is inadequate to meet the metabolic demands of
tissues results in hypoxia and inadequate aerobic metabolism and,
ultimately, cell injury, cell death, tissue injury and organ failure.
Patients with low output syndrome have more chronic or subacute
manifestations of poor perfusion, whereas cardiogenic shock is
characterized by an abrupt onset. Organ impairment in the setting
of shock is of prognostic importance. In the CardShock study, con-
fusion, elevated blood lactate and a reduced glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.25
Of note, excessive diuretic therapy may reduce cardiac preload,
thereby diminishing stroke volume and contributing to the shock
state iatrogenically.26

Neurohormonal response
and inflammation in acute heart failure:
impacts on endothelial glycocalyx
and vascular function
The neurohormonal and inflammatory response to systemic con-
gestion and/or peripheral hypoperfusion, if present, may further
contribute to organ injury.26–28 Neurohormones, oxidative stress
and inflammation may also impair the structure and function of the
endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) that is composed of glycosamino-
glycan (GAG) networks.29 These GAG networks function as
sodium buffers and play important roles in fluid homeostasis and
endothelial function. In heart failure, neurohormonal alterations
disrupt GAG structure, leading to loss of the interstitial buffer
capacity and disproportionate interstitial fluid accumulation.29
Moreover, a diminished eGC results in increased vascular resis-
tance and disturbed endothelial nitric oxide production, leading
to endothelial dysfunction.29 Endothelial dysfunction increases left
and right ventricular systolic workload, potentially contributing
to organ injury,30 and is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in
heart failure of any stage.31–34

stretch, remodelling, ventricular myocyte necrosis and a progres-
sive decline in cardiac function.35 Natriuretic peptides are released
from the atria or ventricle under such conditions of wall stretch or
cardiac stress.36
Cardiac troponin is detectable in a large proportion of patients
with AHF, especially with high-sensitivity assays,37
revealing
non-ischaemic myocyte injury or necrosis.37–39 Troponin release
may be secondary to increased wall stress, structural changes
in the myocardium, elevated myocardial pressure, direct toxicity
of circulating catecholamines or inflammation.37 In the Relaxin
in Acute Heart Failure (RELAX-AHF) study, 90% of patients had
high-sensitivity troponin T (TnT) levels above the 99th upper
reference limit, with a median value of 0.033 𝜇g/L.40 Conversely,
patients without detectable high-sensitivity cardiac-specific TnT
(cTnT) may be at decreased risk for subsequent events.41
Lungs
Rises in hydrostatic left atrial pressure and mitral regurgita-
tion are transmitted backward as increased pressure to the pul-
monary capillaries, creating an imbalance in capillary Starling forces.
These changes increase the regular fluid filtration rate to the
interstitium, causing lung stiffness and, in some patients, dys-
pnoea. The lymphatic system regularly drains interstitial fluid,
but when interstitial pressure exceeds pleural pressure and sur-
passes drainage capacity, fluid moves to pleural and intra-alveolar
spaces, causing pleural effusion and alveolar oedema.42 Individ-
ual susceptibility and genetic characteristics, often involving nitric
oxide interactions, may explain why some patients develop pul-
monary oedema and others with similar haemodynamics do
not.43–45 An inflammation-triggered increase in permeability of
the pulmonary vasculature may play a role in patients who
develop pulmonary oedema despite relatively low hydrostatic
pressures.46
Repetitive or severe decompensations may result in cardiopul-
monary remodelling (i.e. endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of
myofibroblasts, fibrosis and thickening of the extracellular matrix)
with an impairment in alveolar gas diffusion properties,47 pul-
monary vasoconstriction and, finally, pulmonary hypertension.48
This process also leads to the restrictive ventilation pat-
tern observed in CHF.49 The bronchial tree is also affected,
which may lead to an obstructive or reactive airway disease
pattern.50
Kidneys
Cardiorenal syndrome refers to the pathophysiological interplay
between the heart and kidney. Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome is
manifested as an acute cardiac event (e.g. AHF) that results in
kidney injury and renal dysfunction.9 Depending on its definition,
the reported incidence of worsening renal function during AHF
hospitalization is 20–30%.51
Systemic congestion was a stronger predictor of worsening renal
function than cardiac output or mean arterial pressure in analyses
of patients with decompensated advanced heart failure.52–54

(ESCAPE) trial showed no positive association between cardiac
index and renal function,55 suggesting that worsening renal function
cannot be predominantly attributed to reduced cardiac output
in the population of patients represented by this analysis (i.e.
patients who are hospitalized for decompensated heart failure
without shock).54 Elevated central venous pressure may worsen
renal function through several different mechanisms, including
pressure-induced reduction in renal blood flow, renal hypoxia,
increased interstitial pressure and interstitial fibrosis.56 Other
contributors to acute kidney injury or worsening renal function
in AHF include inflammatory mediators (e.g. infection, tissue
damage), iatrogenic damage (e.g. contrast media, nephrotoxic
medication), low cardiac output57 and elevated intra-abdominal
pressure.17
Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome consists of subclinical injury, which
can be detected by tubular markers (Table 1), and acute kidney
injury, which is reflected by a rise in functional markers (creatinine
and cystatin C). Whether tubular markers in plasma or urine will
be helpful in distinguishing these two clinically important entities
remains unproven. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) defines acute kidney injury as indicated by any of the
following: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5
𝜇mol/L) within 48 h; an increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times
the baseline level, which is known or presumed to have occurred
within the prior 7 days, and urine volume of <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6
h.58 Impaired baseline renal function is the strongest risk factor
for acute kidney injury,59 suggesting that underlying intrinsic kidney
disease is an important determinant of kidney reserve and the renal
response to AHF and aggressive diuretic treatment.
The clinical progression of renal dysfunction in patients with
AHF is complex and may follow any of several pathways. In some
patients, clinical improvement of the AHF state leads to improved
renal function. Prior studies have found a small absolute increase in
serum creatinine (i.e. 0.3 mg/dL) within 48 h, as well as a cystatin C
increase of 0.3 mg/L, to be clinically important markers of acute kid-
ney injury and to predict death or hospitalization for heart failure
in patients with AHF.4,
51,
60–63 However, patients who experience
transient worsening of renal function in conjunction with clini-
cal heart failure improvement may have ‘
pseudo worsening renal
function’and may not be at increased risk for adverse events.63,
64
Pseudo worsening renal function is mostly the result of changing
intraglomerular haemodynamics rather than renal injury. Although
aggressive fluid removal is related to deterioration in renal func-
tion and haemoconcentration, haemoconcentration is associated
with improved survival in AHF.65 In fact, a recent secondary analysis
suggested improved renal function may be associated with wors-
ened outcomes when compared with worsening renal function.66
Clearly, the clinical scenario (i.e. improved or worse) must be con-
sidered when interpreting changes in renal function. Thus, some
degree of ‘
worsening renal function’is acceptable while effective
decongestion is ongoing. Finally, only very few patients with car-
diac improvement will have renal tubular injury and experience
an irreversible decline in GFR that is prognostically important.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to predict the renal response to
decongestion.

Liver
Hepatic dysfunction is present in 20–30% of patients with
AHF.7,
67–69 Elevated liver enzymes portend a poor prognosis.7
Hepatic dysfunction is also closely related to renal dysfunction in
AHF (i.e. cardio–renal–hepatic syndrome). These conditions may
have synergistic prognostic implications.70–73
In
the
setting
of
venous
congestion,
cholestasis
is
observed with elevation of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and
𝛾-glutamyltransferase (GGT).68,
74,
75 Cholestasis is a more com-
mon finding in patients with AHF than the more ominous finding
of centrilobular necrosis and elevated transaminases as a result of
hypoperfusion in the setting of hypoxic hepatitis.74 Hypoxic liver
injury is the most common cause of massively raised aminotrans-
ferase levels in hospital.76 It occurs in 5–10% of patients with
critical illness77 and is a strong risk factor for mortality in the
intensive care unit (ICU).78
Intestine
Intestinal morphology, permeability and absorption are altered in
heart failure.79–81 Increased intestinal permeability and an aug-
mented bacterial biolayer may contribute to the origins of both
chronic inflammation and malnutrition.80,
81 Systemic/venous con-
gestion, sympathetic vasoconstriction and low cardiac output con-
tribute to decreased flow in the splanchnic microcirculation and
increase the risk for bowel ischaemia.18 Ischaemia causes epithe-
lial cell dysfunction and loss of the barrier function of the intes-
tine, which allows lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin produced by
gram-negative gut bacteria to enter the circulatory system.18
These effects trigger systemic inflammation and cytokine gener-
ation, leading to several abnormalities of cardiomyocyte function
and energetics.18 Interestingly, the Mini Nutritional Assessment
revealed that 75% of patients with AHF had malnutrition or were
at risk for malnutrition, suggesting this pathophysiology is highly
prevalent.82
Brain
Normal cerebral perfusion is generally very stable: there is a short
time window before cerebral damage occurs in the setting of
hypoperfusion. Impairment of higher cortical function can occur
in at least three inseparable phenotypes in patients with AHF:
depression, cognitive dysfunction, and delirium.83 Prevalences of
cognitive impairment in AHF of 54–75% have been reported.84–87
Delirium is an acute disorder of inattention and global cognitive
dysfunction, and is associated with significant adverse outcomes
in patients with acute medical illness.88 Cerebral dysfunction is
associated with an independent increase in mortality in patients
with AHF.89,
90
Hypoxaemia is the primary cause of cerebral dysfunction in
AHF, but other factors (e.g. inflammation, stress and neurohor-
monal dysregulation) may also play significant roles.91 As well as
higher cortical dysfunction, impaired neurocardiac reflexes may
affect haemodynamic control of the vasculature and myocardial
performance, based on feedback from peripheral tissues to the

brain. Diversion of the chemoreflex sensitivity occurs in the
setting of altered haemodynamics (e.g. congestion) and may
worsen with increasing severity of heart failure.92,
93 Silent cerebral
infarctions, hypotension, disturbances of cerebral metabolism,
cardiac embolism, frailty and low adherence to medications
may also contribute to cognitive dysfunction and depression
in AHF.89
Clinical and biochemical
assessments of acute heart failure
and organ injury
Initial work-up
Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with
symptoms of AHF require an extensive work-up to differentiate
between AHF and other causes of dyspnoea, monitor response to
therapy, quantify risk, and determine the need for admission. Rapid
and accurate diagnosis may facilitate faster initiation of deconges-
tive and other therapies, which, in turn, may reduce or prevent
the extent of organ injury, but this hypothesis needs to be tested.
Importantly, diagnostic and therapeutic plans commonly occur in
parallel in patients suspected of AHF.
Diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary
oedema
Pulmonary oedema is characterized by pulmonary congestion in
the face of an acutely increased preload or afterload, with a
rapid onset, extensive alveolar flooding and significant respira-
tory distress. An abrupt increase in pulmonary congestion leads
directly to decreased pulmonary compliance, which further con-
tributes to tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypoxaemia. Acute pul-
monary oedema is characterized by increased work of breathing
with a respiratory rate of >25 breaths/min and peripheral oxy-
gen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) of <90%.94 Monitoring of
SpO2 provides reliable information about arterial oxygen satura-
tion (SaO2).95 Respiratory rate96 and SpO2
97 also closely correlate
with AHF severity and mortality. Increases in peripheral oedema
and body weight occur in a relatively small proportion of pul-
monary oedema patients, suggesting that relative volume redistri-
bution, as opposed to an absolute increase in total body fluid, may
play a major role in the pathophysiology of the pulmonary oedema
phenotype.19
Blood gas analysis of venous samples can be useful for a rapid
assessment of acid–base status.95 Arterial blood gas analysis is
indicated in patients with suspected severe hypoxaemia, hypoven-
tilation and cardiogenic shock, high risk or suspicion of hypercap-
nia, or in whom oxygenation cannot be assessed reliably by pulse
oximetry.94 Dyspnoea causes hyperventilation and consequent
hypocapnia,98 especially in mild or early stages of pulmonary
oedema. A significant fall in alveolar ventilation occurs in patients
with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and in those with severe or advanced acute pulmonary oedema
and respiratory fatigue, which usually will lead to hypercapnia.

hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing) and contributes to respira-
tory distress.98 Blood lactate reflects the severity of hypoperfusion
and shock.
It is estimated that 20–35% of patients have concomitant COPD
and heart failure,102 and differentiating between the two con-
ditions can be difficult because of overlapping symptoms and
physical examination findings. Natriuretic peptides can be ele-
vated in COPD as a result of the effects of COPD on the right
ventricle.103,
104 However, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnoea are usually more characteristic of heart failure, and
elevations of natriuretic peptides are usually more modest than
those occurring in the setting of AHF.105 Pulmonary function test-
ing should be postponed until patients are stable and decon-
gested because congestion may cause an obstructive pattern.103
Pulmonary congestion attributable to AHF can also be misdiag-
nosed as multifocal pneumonia.2 Clinical assessment (fever, leuko-
cyte count, sputum, cultures) and imaging with ultrasonography or
chest radiography are necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis. In
the ICU setting, pulmonary artery or transpulmonary thermodilu-
tion (PiCCO) catheters may provide important information regard-
ing cardiac output, capillary wedge pressure and extravascular lung
water (EVLW).46 They may be helpful in selected haemodynami-
cally unstable patients in whom the mechanism of deterioration is
unknown.1
Imaging
Chest X-ray
Chest X-ray is widely available and remains a standard compo-
nent of the AHF evaluation. It can detect pulmonary venous con-
gestion, pleural effusion, interstitial or alveolar oedema, and car-
diomegaly, but chest X-ray findings may be normal in up to 20% of
patients.1,
94,
106
Echocardiography
In acute situations, focused transthoracic echocardiography is typ-
ically performed and interpreted by clinicians at the bedside, and
portable or pocket ultrasound systems can provide similar levels
of accuracy.107
Comprehensive echocardiography provides detailed information
about cardiac structure and function.108,
109 Inferior vena cava diam-
eter may be increased and its respiratory variation suppressed in
patients with AHF, findings that support its diagnosis.110 Echocar-
diography can also provide an estimate of left atrial pressure with
mitral valve inflow and left ventricular tissue Doppler assessments
(E/e′ ratio). Sonographic assessment includes examination of the
lungs and pleural space for detection of pulmonary oedema and
pleural effusions.111,
112 Echocardiography is preferred within 48
h of admission in patients with de novo AHF or unknown car-
diac function.1 Immediate echocardiography is necessary in haemo-
dynamically unstable patients or suspected acute life-threatening
structural or functional cardiac abnormalities.1

Lung ultrasound
In dyspnoeic patients presenting to the ED, lung ultrasound is
more accurate than auscultation or chest X-ray for the detection
of pulmonary congestion in AHF.113–116 Lung ultrasound can
be performed within 2–5 min using either standard ultrasound
equipment or pocket devices111,
117 with investigation of three or
four zones for B-lines on each hemithorax and the presence of
pleural effusions laterally.112,
114 Vertical B-lines provide a graded
measure of EVLW (interstitial or alveolar oedema) with high
inter-rater reproducibility after a short duration (i.e. 30 min) of
training.114,
118 At least three B-lines in two or more intercostal
spaces bilaterally are considered indicative of interstitial or alveolar
oedema in the acute care setting.111,
112,
114,
117,
119 Despite their high
accuracy in the identification of pulmonary oedema in patients with
suspected AHF, B-lines can also be found in other conditions, such
as interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
pulmonary contusions and pneumonitis.112
Serial assessment with lung ultrasound may be useful for moni-
toring treatment effects in patients with AHF.119–121 Importantly,
hospitalized patients with residual pulmonary congestion at dis-
charge are at risk for subsequent heart failure hospitalizations or
death.119,
122–124
Biomarkers
Blood and urine biomarkers quantify biochemical signatures that
are closely related to organ injury and functional impairment.
Well-validated and inexpensive biomarkers are available to quan-
tify injury or impairment of the heart, kidneys or liver and can be
used routinely (e.g. natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponin, serum
creatinine, cystatin C, albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, transami-
nases, coagulation factors, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin).4 Other
emerging biomarkers are currently under study (as noted below)
and may have future roles.
Natriuretic peptides are recommended for measurement in all
patients with acute dyspnoea and suspected AHF.1 Acute heart fail-
ure is unlikely in patients with BNP of <100 pg/mL, NT-proBNP
of <300 pg/mL or MR-proANP of <120 pg/mL.1 Elevated natri-
uretic peptide levels may be attributable to other cardiac or
non-cardiac causes; results must therefore be interpreted in the
clinical context.1,
125 Further, obesity may lead to falsely low natri-
uretic peptide levels, and this should be considered when diagnos-
ing or excluding AHF in this cohort.126 Procalcitonin levels may aid
in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with AHF and
suspected concomitant infection.127,
128 Other biomarkers (e.g. sol-
uble ST2, galectin-3, GDF-15) may have clinical roles in the future,
primarily in prognosis and risk stratification.129
Cardiac injury is detected by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
or T assays. Although patients with AHF and elevated troponin are
at higher risk than those with undetectable troponin,94 it is unclear
whether any inpatient interventions impact the trajectory of their
risk profile (in the absence of acute myocardial infarction).
Kidney injury can be detected and quantified using a combi-
nation of urine output and blood biomarkers of renal function
(e.g. cystatin C, serum creatinine to calculate estimated GFR, albu-
minuria, blood urea nitrogen63), or blood and/or urine markers

of tubular injury [e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL), pen-enkephalin and KIM-1, although these may not be
widely available in clinical practice]. Functional biomarkers have low
sensitivity and high specificity, whereas tubular injury markers have
high sensitivity and low specificity to detect kidney injury. Several of
these markers are elevated in heart failure, both acute and chronic,
and are associated with worse survival.130,
131 However, their abil-
ity to predict acute kidney injury has been disappointing, limiting
their clinical utility. In AHF, levels of urinary NGAL did not differ
between patients with and without worsening renal function,132
and the Acute Kidney Injury Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated
Lipocalin Evaluation of Symptomatic Heart Failure Study (AKINE-
SIS) showed that plasma NGAL was not superior to creatinine in
predicting worsening renal function in patients with AHF.133 These
data emphasize that progression from tubular damage to reduced
function is incompletely understood.
An acute rise in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels signals liver cell necrosis. Coagula-
tion factors reflect actual hepatic synthetic function, especially in
acute organ failure, whereas albumin, which has a half-life of 2–3
weeks, represents hepatic synthetic capacity in chronic stable con-
ditions. Alkaline phosphatase, GGT and, to a lesser extent, bilirubin
are cholestasis markers. Arterial ammonia may serve as a surrogate
marker of hepatic encephalopathy.134,
135
Circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut-derived
metabolite, is associated with AHF and is predictive of death or
rehospitalization. Transthyretin (prealbumin) provides prognostic
information in combination with the Mini-Nutritional Assessment
in patients with AHF.82
Research is ongoing to determine the clinical roles of
vascular
and
endothelial
biomarkers
such
as
mid-regional
pro-adrenomedulin,136
pro-endothelin-1
and
endothelin-1.137
Recently, circulating CD146 appeared to indicate the level of
congestion in AHF.138
Clinical management tools
in acute heart failure
Supplementary oxygen, non-invasive
and invasive ventilation
Patients with AHF should be immediately assessed for respiratory
distress in the pre-hospital or ED setting.94 Patients with mild acute
respiratory failure present with hypoxaemia and/or other mild
blood gas abnormalities without signs of respiratory distress and
account for nearly 30% of the AHF population.98,
139 Oxygen ther-
apy is recommended in these patients.94,
140 Recently, conservative
oxygen therapy (SpO2 targets: 94–98%) proved to be safer than
conventional oxygen therapy (SpO2 targets: 97–100%) in medical
ICU patients.141 In acute pulmonary oedema, non-invasive venti-
lation is superior to conventional oxygen therapy.142,
143 Continu-
ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) does not require specialized
training and may be administered without a ventilator, which is an
advantage in the pre-hospital or ED setting. Meta-analyses have
shown evidence that it reduces respiratory distress, endotracheal
intubation and even mortality in high-risk patients.142–144
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Non-invasive pressure support ventilation applied with positive
end expiratory pressure (PEEP) provides inspiratory support and is
appropriate in patients with hypercapnia. Expertise and appropriate
equipment are necessary to synchronize the patient’
s inspiratory
efforts and the ventilator. Non-invasive pressure support ventila-
tion reduces respiratory distress and the need for endotracheal
intubation, but data on its impact on mortality and its superiority in
comparison with CPAP are inconclusive.145,
146 Severe respiratory
distress and impending exhaustion may be indications for endotra-
cheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.94
In addition to the use of supplementary oxygen and ventilatory
support, other means of alleviating dyspnoea and ventilation dis-
orders may be indicated. These include the removal of clinically
significant amounts of pleural fluid and administration of inhaled
bronchodilators (in COPD and asthma). Opioids have been widely
used in this setting, but there are conflicting data on their safety
and efficacy.147
Pharmacological approaches to treating
congestion and preventing organ injury
The therapeutic approach to congestion depends on whether
vascular-type
fluid
redistribution
or
cardiac-type
fluid
accumulation1 is the primary cause of the elevated cardiac filling
pressures148,
149 (Figure 2). More than 80% of patients are initially
treated homogeneously with i.v. diuretics without consideration
of the underlying pathophysiology.11,
150
Diuretics
Diuretics are guideline-recommended first-line therapy in ‘
wet and
warm’patients in whom congestion is predominantly attributable
to fluid accumulation and volume overload.1 Diuretics are generally
ineffective in patients with congestion caused by vascular-type fluid
redistribution,1 generally observed as increased congestion despite
a lack of weight gain and predominantly indicated by hyperten-
sion. Loop diuretics should be prescribed i.v. at a dose sufficient to
achieve meaningful natriuresis, usually 20–40 mg of i.v. furosemide
(or equivalent: torasemide 5–10 mg, bumetanide 0.5–1.0 mg1) in
new-onset AHF or at least the oral dose in patients with CHF.1,
151
Bowel oedema impairs gastrointestinal absorption; therefore, par-
enteral administration is preferred. Strategies to address inade-
quate diuresis include the administration of a continuous infu-
sion as an alternative route of administration (e.g. 1–10 mg/h
of furosemide or equivalent, depending on the current dose) or
additional loop diuretic boluses; these strategies resulted in sim-
ilar degrees of symptomatic relief and did not differ in terms of
adverse effects in the Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation
(DOSE) trial.151 Patients respond individually to different strategies
and it is reasonable for physicians to tailor the choice of strat-
egy to the specific patient. Combination drug therapy targeting
different segments of the nephron [e.g. thiazide (hydrochloroth-
iazide) and thiazide-like (metolazone),152 diuretics, mineralocor-
ticoid receptor antagonists or acetazolamide] may be helpful in
some patients with an inadequate natriuretic response to loop

Figure 2 The pharmacological management of congestion in heart failure. Patients without congestion (i.e. normal filling pressures and no
volume overload) should be managed with neurohumoral blockers, the lowest possible dose of loop diuretics, and selected therapies in cases of
persistent symptoms. In congestion, it is pivotal to distinguish between the phenotype of volume overload: cardiac-type fluid accumulation (i.e.
oedema, ascites, pleural effusion) or vascular-type fluid redistribution. In volume overload, the goal is to remove extracellular fluid through the
use of loop diuretic therapy, which should be adequately dosed and administered i.v. Loop diuretics should often be used in combination with
diuretic agents acting in other segments of the nephron. Vasodilators may be added cautiously in low cardiac output and systolic blood pressure
of >90 mmHg, while avoiding a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure to <65 mmHg. Inotropes are to be used only in severe hypoperfusion.
The use of ultrafiltration is limited to selected cases of refractory volume overload. In contrast, vasodilating agents (with a considerably
lower dose of diuretics) are the preferred pharmacological option in vascular fluid redistribution. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB,
angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNI, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CRT, cardiac resynchronization
therapy; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction; HR, heart rate; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; NT-proBNP, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; SBP, systolic
blood pressure.
diuretics,149,
153 although strong evidence is lacking.1 A prospec-
tive trial with acetazolamide is currently being planned. Diuretics
alleviate congestion by decreasing cardiac filling pressure with-
out increasing ventricular contractility or cardiac output. High
diuretic doses may decrease renal blood flow and GFR by activating
the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and/or sympa-
thetic nervous system,154–156 although recent studies in patients
on guideline-directed therapy question whether the RAAS is acti-
vated to a significant extent.157 Tubuloglomerular feedback may
also play a role,158 whereby increased sodium chloride reabsorp-
tion by the macula densa results in adenosine release and increased
renin activity, leading to afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and a
decrease in single nephron GFR.159,
160
Vasodilators
Vasodilators may be used as first-line therapy to unload the
heart and increase venous capacitance in patients with AHF and
hypertensive, vascular-type fluid redistribution.1,
57,
149 Vasodilators
improve ventricular function by reducing afterload and decrease
symptoms by reducing cardiac filling pressure.1 Nitrates (e.g.

used most frequently. They have not been evaluated in ade-
quately powered studies specifically targeting the ‘
wet and warm’
phenotype; thus, they have not been shown to improve clinical
outcomes.161 Care should be taken to avoid hypotension.
Serelaxin was studied in the Relaxin in Acute Heart Failure
(RELAX-AHF) trial and was found to improve dyspnoea in com-
parison with the placebo plus standard of care arm.162 As recently
presented during the HFA 2017 Congress, RELAX-AHF-2, a phase
3 study, was neutral regarding the co-primary endpoints, and pub-
lication of the results will be forthcoming.
Ularitide was studied in the Trial of Ularitide’
s Efficacy and
Safety in Patients with Acute Heart Failure (TRUE-AHF).163 At 48
h, ularitide decreased NT-proBNP and systolic blood pressure to
a greater extent than placebo, and other evidence of intravascular
decongestion was observed (significant increases in haemoglobin
and serum creatinine and decreases in hepatic transaminases
compared with placebo). No difference between groups was
observed in the co-primary endpoints of clinical composite score
at 48 h or cardiovascular mortality over a median follow-up of 15
months.163

Vasopressors, inotropes and inodilators
Inotropes
(e.g.
dobutamine),
inodilators
(e.g.
levosimendan,
milrinone) and vasopressors (norepinephrine is preferred over
dopamine based on a subgroup analysis that suggested fewer side
effects and lower mortality with norepinephrine, as noted in heart
failure guidelines1,
164) should only be used when cardiac output
is severely reduced, vital organ perfusion is compromised, filling
pressures are normal or high, and patients cannot be stabilized
by other means1,
94 because of their associations with increased
mortality.165,
166 Recent evidence suggests that epinephrine should
be avoided in cardiogenic shock.167
Organ-specific management options
Heart
Current guidelines for heart failure suggest the use of short-term
mechanical circulatory support should be considered in patients
who remain unstable with insufficient end-organ perfusion despite
medical therapy.1 An intra-aortic balloon pump is not routinely rec-
ommended in cardiogenic shock.94 A device selection strategy [i.e.
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), extracorporeal
life support (ECLS), left ventricular assist device (LVAD)] based on
severity [i.e. Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circu-
latory Support (INTERMACS) criteria] is outlined in the ESC heart
failure guidelines.1
Kidney
Treatment of venous congestion may prevent or minimize kidney
injury in AHF.52–54 The therapeutic goal is to achieve the low-
est venous filling pressures without deteriorating cardiac output.
Ultrafiltation may be considered in patients in whom decongestion
goals are not met with vasodilators or loop diuretics.1 Data are
inconclusive for the effectiveness of ultrafiltration compared with
diuretics alone.168–170 Inotropes may be considered in patients
with deteriorating cardiac output and renal perfusion in the set-
ting of decongestion. Nephrotoxic agents and procedures should
be avoided during the AHF presentation.
Liver
Liver-specific management involves appropriate supportive treat-
ment for the problems induced by liver impairment or failure
(e.g. coagulopathy, hypoglycaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, hepatopul-
monary syndrome),171–176 but these are not specific to patients
with AHF. Liver impairment can impact the pharmacokinetics of
some drugs commonly used in heart failure, potentially leading to
adverse effects or toxicity caused by elevated serum concentra-
tions of some drugs (e.g. warfarin).
Intestine
Few interventions target gut protection in the setting of AHF.79
In addition to loop diuretics and vasodilators, paracentesis in
patients with ascites and elevated intra-abdominal pressure (>8
mmHg), or ultrafiltration may be strategies to consider in specific
patients.21,

Gaps in knowledge and future
directions
Defining adequate endpoints of decongestion is a major clinical
challenge of managing patients with AHF. Change in body weight is
often used as a guide, but this approach is frequently inadequate as
body weight is not increased in all patients and does not reflect con-
gestion caused by vascular-type fluid redistribution. Evidence-based
clinical and biochemical indicators of adequate decongestion are
lacking; thus, vasodilator or diuretic dose adjustments are largely
empirical. Developing reliable criteria and accurate methods for
assessing the extent of congestion and determining optimal decon-
gestion are crucial unmet needs because persistent congestion is a
marker of worse prognosis after discharge.180 Point-of-care imag-
ing may have potential, primarily for the evaluation of pulmonary
congestion. Novel, effective and safe pharmacological or mechani-
cal methods to achieve decongestion are needed. The patterns of
congestion in AHF with preserved ejection fraction are not well
characterized and warrant investigation, although the available evi-
dence suggests that patients with heart failure from reduced or
preserved ejection fraction have similar characteristics of conges-
tion at presentation (e.g. oedema, orthopnoea, elevated jugular
venous pressure, dyspnoea on exertion).181
Organ-specific injury markers suitable for clinical practice are
lacking for many organs (e.g. brain, lung, intestine, endothelium,
vasculature). Injury markers for these organs would be valuable,
along with evidence-based recommendations for monitoring, lead-
ing to possible intervention strategies. Even where organ-specific
injury markers exist (e.g. cardiac troponin, markers of renal or hep-
atic injury), research is needed to guide their interpretation. The
clinical progression of organ injury to dysfunction and ultimately
failure is not well characterized and the extent to which injury and
dysfunction are reversible or irreversible in the setting of AHF is
not known. The clinical importance of low levels of detectable tro-
ponin is not well understood and whether or not treatments that
target troponins alter risk is unknown. The same is true for novel
prognostic markers such as mid-region adrenomedullin and soluble
ST2. It remains uncertain whether decongestion targeting reduc-
tion in traditional markers of heart failure (i.e. natriuretic pep-
tides) is more beneficial than clinical guidance.182 More research
is needed to establish the appropriate pathway (i.e. discharge or
further evaluation) in otherwise stable patients with persistently
elevated biomarkers.
The
treatment
of
pulmonary
oedema
remains
largely
opinion-based as there is a general lack of robust evidence
to guide therapy. Similarly, although small studies suggest that
vasodilators are preferable as first-line therapy in AHF patients
with hypertension, a definitive trial testing this strategy is required
to fill this evidence void. Furthermore, no therapy has shown
simultaneous
benefits
in
symptomatic
relief,
haemodynamic
improvement, increased survival and end-organ protection.183
New methods such as thoracic impedance monitoring have been
used to detect pulmonary oedema in the research setting.184
The concept that treatment of congestion can reduce or pre-
vent organ injury needs to be tested in randomized trials, and the
effects of preventing organ injury on morbidity, survival and health

economics require validation. Whether regulators will accept pre-
vention of organ injury as an endpoint in AHF trials remains to
be determined; adequate reassurance of safety (i.e. in terms of
mortality) would also need to be demonstrated. Engagement with
payers is needed to determine their attitudes towards such an end-
point. It is reasonable to consider that payers may be supportive
of therapies that prevent organ injury if their use leads to shorter
ICU or overall hospital stays, decreases short-term readmissions
or reduces the need for other interventions (e.g. haemodialysis,
mechanical circulatory support), but this evidence must be gener-
ated.
Conclusions
Managing patients with AHF remains a clinical challenge and
current therapies have uncertain impacts on long-term morbid-
ity and mortality. The use of therapies that prevent or reverse
congestion-induced organ injury may represent a strategy to
reduce subsequent organ impairment and morbidity that is more
successful than the traditional approach of targeting dyspnoea
relief. Although much has been learned about the role of conges-
tion in promoting organ injury, future research efforts should focus
on defining the specific pathophysiological mechanisms through
which congestion leads to organ injury, determine whether decon-
gestive therapies can prevent or reverse organ impairment, and
evaluate the impact of an organ-preserving strategy on long-term
clinical outcomes.
