ABSTRACT
Background Smoking cessation was examined among
high-risk participants in the UK Lung Cancer Screening
(UKLS) Pilot Trial of low-dose CT screening.
Methods High-risk individuals aged 50–75 years who
completed baseline questionnaires were randomised to
CT screening (intervention) or usual care (no screening
control). Smoking habit was determined at baseline
using self-report. Smokers were asked whether they had
quit smoking since joining UKLS at T1 (2 weeks after
baseline scan results or control assignment) and T2 (up
to 2 years after recruitment). Intention-to-treat (ITT)
regression analyses were undertaken, adjusting for
baseline lung cancer distress, trial site and
sociodemographic variables.
Results Of a total 4055 individuals randomised to CT
screening or control, 1546 were baseline smokers (759
intervention, 787 control). Smoking cessation rates were
8% (control n=36/479) versus 14% (intervention n=75/
527) at T1 and 21% (control n=79/377) versus 24%
(intervention n=115/488) at T2. ITT analyses indicated
that the odds of quitting among screened participants
were significantly higher at T1 (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.38,
95% CI 1.56 to 3.64, p<0.001) and T2 (aOR 1.60,
95% CI 1.17 to 2.18, p=0.003) compared with control.
Intervention participants who needed additional clinical
investigation were more likely to quit in the longer term
compared with the control group (aOR 2.29, 95% CI
1.62 to 3.22, p=0.007) and those receiving a negative
result (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.84, p<0.001).
Conclusions CT lung cancer screening for high-risk
participants presents a teachable moment for smoking
cessation, especially among those who receive a positive
scan result. Further behavioural research is needed to
evaluate optimal strategies for integrating smoking
cessation intervention with stratified lung cancer
screening.

INTRODUCTION
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbid-
ity and premature mortality worldwide.1 In the UK,
an estimated 86% of lung cancer cases are attribut-
able to smoking.2
The
prevalence of cigarette
smoking
in
the
UK
remained
relatively
stable
between
2006
and
2014
at
approximately
10
million adults (∼20%)3 and although these rates are
much lower than those of the 1970s, this declining
trend
has
begun
to
plateau.4
The
association
between
cigarette
smoking
and
socioeconomic
group is well established, with higher smoking rates
among people living in more deprived areas.5
Trials have been undertaken to ascertain the
effectiveness of low-dose CT screening for the
earlier detection of lung cancer in high-risk groups,
including smokers.6–9 The impact of CT lung
screening on smoking cessation and abstinence has
been examined in response to concerns that taking
part in lung screening may offer a ‘licence to
smoke’, especially for smokers who receive favour-
able screening results.10 Evidence from controlled
trials, however, suggests that participating in lung
screening significantly increases smoking cessation
rates overall compared with the general population,
and that receiving a positive CT screening result
may provide an additional cue to action in prompt-
ing cessation. The Danish Lung Cancer Screening
T
rial (DLCST) reported smoking cessation rates of
almost 12% in both trial arms at 1 year follow-up,
compared with the Danish population rate of
4%.11 Quit rate was significantly higher in smokers
who had a positive CT result that required repeat
scans.11 In the Dutch-Belgian NELSON Trial, the
overall quit rate at 2 years follow-up was 16.6%
compared with a background population rate of
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What is the effect on smoking cessation of
taking part in the UK randomised pilot trial of
low-dose CT lung screening?
What is the bottom line?
▸ CT lung cancer screening does not appear to
falsely reassure smokers or reduce their
motivation to stop smoking.
Why read on?
▸ For clinicians and policy makers who are
considering implementation of stratified (ie,
high-risk) lung cancer screening, this study
adds to evidence suggesting that integrating CT
screening with evidence-based smoking
cessation interventions could prompt quitting in
motivated high-risk smokers.

Although
a
lower
prolonged
abstinence
rate
was
observed in the screened arm (14.5%) versus control (19.1%),
this effect disappeared following intention-to-treat (ITT) ana-
lysis, suggesting an overall positive effect of trial participation.12
A non-significant trend towards increased smoking cessation was
seen in those with multiple indeterminate screening results.13
The US National Lung Screening T
rial (NLST)14 found that
compared with normal lung screening results, receiving any
screen-detected abnormality significantly reduced the probability
of continued smoking.
In addition to the moderating effect of lung screening results,
demographic predictors of increased likelihood of smoking ces-
sation have been observed in previous lung cancer screening
studies. These have included older age,11 14 15 higher socio-
economic group,14 higher education,12 being married14 and
lower nicotine dependency.11 14 In addition, participants with
higher levels of concern about lung cancer and greater perceived
benefits of stopping smoking,10 and those who intend to stop
smoking,11 12 are more likely to quit in the context of lung
cancer screening.
The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) Pilot Trial is the first
to assess the feasibility, cost-effectiveness and psychosocial
impact of lung cancer screening using a single low-dose CT
screen versus no screening in a UK high-risk population.9 16
The current study builds upon previous UKLS reports by exam-
ining the behavioural effects of trial participation and modifying
variables on smoking cessation at short-term and long-term
follow-up. It was expected that intervention arm participants
would be more likely to report quitting compared with control
arm participants, and that predictors of smoking cessation
would include positive CT results (in screened participants),
higher
socioeconomic
group
and
higher
baseline
distress/
concern about lung cancer.
METHODS
Participants and procedures
A random sample of 247 354 individuals aged 50–75 years res-
iding in six recruitment areas in the UK (Liverpool, Knowsley
and Sefton; Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Bedfordshire)
was sent trial information packs that included a self-report ques-
tionnaire regarding lung cancer risk factors. From the question-
naire responders, 8729 patients were identified as high risk of
lung cancer (≥5% over 5 years) using the Liverpool Lung
Project (LLPv2) risk prediction model which includes age, sex,
family history of lung cancer, smoking duration, personal
history of other cancers and non-malignant respiratory diseases
and
exposure
to
asbestos.9
Characteristics
of
trial
non-
participants are reported elsewhere.17 18
Following completion of a second questionnaire to identify
trial eligibility, those meeting the criteria were invited to attend
their local recruitment centre in Liverpool or Cambridge (trial
sites). High-risk individuals who gave informed written consent
were randomised on a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (screening)
or control arms. Randomisation used unique random personal
ID codes and computer-generated sequencing for allocation con-
cealment.9 Participants who self-reported smoking in the first
questionnaire were eligible for inclusion in the current analyses.
Participants in both trial arms were offered standard smoking
cessation advice leaflets and given a list of local National Health
Service Stop Smoking services prerandomisation.
Participants
completed
a
touchscreen
questionnaire
that
included baseline psychosocial measures (T0). A second psycho-
social questionnaire (T1) was sent approximately 2 weeks after
receiving either a letter of assignment to the control group or a
baseline CT scan result letter (intervention arm). T2 psychosocial
questionnaires were sent in a single mailshot during January
2014.
Measures
Smoking status was calculated at T0 based on self-report data
within the first UKLS questionnaire. Participants were cate-
gorised into current smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers.
Smoking cessation was assessed using self-report at T1 and T2.
Participants were asked whether they had quit smoking since
joining UKLS, with response options ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘no but I intend
to quit smoking within the next 6 months’ and ‘not applicable’
(ie, not a smoker at baseline). Participants who responded ‘no’
or ‘no, but intend to quit’ were categorised as non-quitters.
Those who responded ‘not applicable’ or who returned the
questionnaire but missed out the smoking cessation question
were categorised as non-completers.
Lung cancer distress was measured using six items adapted
from Lerman et al19 and W
atson et al20 to assess the frequency
of lung cancer-related thoughts and their impact on mood and
daily functioning. Total score range was 6–24, with a score
above 12.5 corresponding to a clinically significant threshold
score on the General Health Questionnaire-28.21
Demographic variables: age and gender were obtained from
medical records. Socioeconomic group was measured using
Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks calculated from postcodes
and categorised into standard deprivation quintiles (quintile
1=most deprived, quintile 5=least deprived). Marital group
and experience of lung cancer (self and/or close others) were
included in the T0 questionnaire
Screening results
Baseline CT scan results in the intervention arm included nega-
tive (normal) results, those requiring a repeat scan in 3 or
12 months, those requiring referral to the multidisciplinary
team due to a major lung abnormality and significant incidental
findings (such as aortic aneurisms and pneumonia but with no
findings suspicious for lung cancer).
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using Stata V
.14. Baseline comparisons
were undertaken to compare the characteristics of smokers who
did and did not complete follow-up questionnaires. Participants
who did not answer the smoking cessation question at T1 or T2
were imputed as smokers and included in the primary analysis
of intervention effect using the ITT population, in accordance
with the Russell Standard for reporting smoking cessation
trials.22 Complete case sensitivity analyses were also conducted,
using
univariable
logistic
regression
models
fitted
to
the
smoking cessation outcome data at T1 and T2 independently
with an inverse probability weighting.23 Additionally, as a sec-
ondary analysis to adjust for confounders, multivariable logistic
regression models were fitted to evaluate the impact of trial allo-
cation on smoking cessation at T1 and T2 adjusting for T0 lung
cancer distress, sociodemographic factors (gender, age group,
marital group, deprivation quintile, experience of lung cancer)
and trial site.16 ORs and adjusted ORs (aORs) with 95% CIs
and p values are presented. Due to multiple testing, p<0.01 was
used to denote statistical significance.
T
o investigate the effect of the baseline scan result on
smoking cessation, we summarised intervention arm participants
into those who had a scan leading to additional clinical investi-
gation (including repeat scan, major abnormality and incidental
findings) and those receiving a negative result (ie, not requiring

 further investigation). Participants randomised to the control
group were used as the reference category in order to reflect
current practice. The impact of additional clinical investigation
on smoking cessation at T1 and T2 was analysed using univari-
able and multivariable logistic regressions in the imputed and
complete case populations. Lung cancer distress, sociodemo-
graphic factors and trial site were included in multivariable
analysis.
Further subgroup analyses were carried out within the inter-
vention arm only, involving additional univariable regression
analyses to examine T1 and T2 smoking cessation in those
receiving additional clinical investigation compared with a nega-
tive result as the reference category. W
e carried out this analysis
to reflect a potential national policy where participants receive
routine lung screening.
RESULTS
Trial participation
In total, 4061 individuals (5% of 75 958 responders to the risk
questionnaire;
47%
of
all
high-risk
positive
responders)
attended the recruitment clinic and were consented.24 As shown
in figure 1, 4055 trial participants were randomised (n=2028
CT intervention, n=2027 control). T1 completion rates were
n=527/758 (70%) for the intervention arm and n=479/786
(61%) for the control arm, giving a total T1 sample of n=1006.
The non-completion rate at T1 was n=538, of whom 231
(43%) were intervention and 307 (57%) were control partici-
pants. T2 completion rates were n=488/749 (65%) for the
screening arm and n=377/775 (49%) for the control arm (total
T2 n=865). Of the 659 T2 non-completers, 261 (40%) were
from the intervention arm and 398 (60%) were from the
control arm.
Factors associated with non-completion
Baseline smokers in the control arm and those with experience
of lung cancer were significantly less likely than those in the
intervention arm to complete T1 questionnaires (see online
supplementary table SI). Trial site, age, gender, marital group,
deprivation and T0 lung cancer distress were not statistically sig-
nificantly associated with T1 completion.
T2 questionnaire completion was significantly lower among
baseline smokers in the control arm and those recruited at the
Liverpool site in the most deprived quintile and with experience
of lung cancer. Age, marital group, gender and baseline distress
were not statistically significantly associated with T2 completion
(see online supplementary table SII).
Effect of trial allocation on T1 and T2 smoking cessation
As shown in figure 1, the overall T1 trial quit rate was 111/1006
(11%). In the screening arm, 75 (14%) individuals quit smoking
at T1 and 452 (86%) continued to smoke. Thirty-six individuals
(8%) in the control arm had quit smoking at T1 compared with
443 (92%) who had not quit. At T2, the overall quit rate was
194/865 (22%), with 115 screened individuals (24%) and 79
(21%) individuals in the control arm having quit smoking.
Primary ITTand sensitivity analyses are summarised in table 1.
T1 smoking cessation was statistically significantly higher in
screened individuals compared with control (p<0.001) and
remained statistically significant (p=0.001) after adjusting for T0
distress and all other covariates. Sensitivity analysis confirmed
that T1 smoking cessation was statistically significantly higher in
the intervention group (p<0.001). Effects of covariates on T1
smoking cessation were not statistically significant in ITTanalyses
(see online supplementary table SIII): trial site (p=0.14); age
group
compared
with
those
under
65 years
(66–70 years
p=0.50, over 70 years p=0.81); gender (p=0.87); marital group
(p=0.38); deprivation (most vs least deprived p=0.50) and lung
cancer experience (p=0.45). There was limited evidence that
participants with higher baseline lung cancer distress were more
likely to quit smoking at T1 (p=0.03). Similarly, covariates were
non-significant in crude and adjusted complete case analyses (see
online supplementary table SIV).
At T2, there was a statistically significant difference between
trial arms in quitting smoking in the crude ITT analysis
(p=0.003) and after adjusting for covariates (p=0.003). In sen-
sitivity analyses, the difference in cessation rate between inter-
vention and control groups at T2 was not statistically significant
(p=0.36); therefore, these findings should be interpreted with
caution (see table 1). The effects of other variables on T2
smoking cessation rate were not statistically significant in ITT
analyses
(see
online
supplementary
table
SV):
trial
site
(p=0.28); age (66–70 years p=0.49; over 70 years p=0.18);
gender (p=1.18); marital group (p=0.07); deprivation (most vs
least deprived p=0.24); lung cancer experience (p=0.60) and
baseline distress (p=0.08). The effects of covariates were not
statistically significant in complete case analyses at T2 (see
online supplementary table SVI).
Impact of additional clinical investigation on smoking
cessation
T1 smoking cessation was reported by 16% (48/299) of partici-
pants who had additional clinical investigation following the
baseline scan result and 11% (26/227) who received a negative
result. These were both compared with 8% (36/479) who
reported T1 smoking cessation in the control group. As shown
in table 2, the impact of needing additional clinical investigation
on T1 smoking cessation was statistically significant in univari-
able (p<0.001) and multivariable (p<0.001) analyses using the
imputed population. The effect of receiving a negative result on
T1
smoking
cessation
was
not
significant
in
univariable
(p=0.09) and multivariable (p=0.09) analyses. Similar findings
were observed in sensitivity analyses for both T1 comparisons.
At T2, 30% (83/275) of participants who received additional
clinical investigation following the baseline scan result and 15%
(32/212) who had negative results reported cessation. These
were compared with 21% (79/377) in the control group who
reported quitting at T2. There was a statistically significant effect
of additional clinical investigation on T2 smoking cessation in
univariable (p=0.007) and multivariable (p=0.007) ITT ana-
lyses. The effect of a negative result on T2 smoking cessation
was not significant in univariable (p=0.08) and multivariable
(p=0.07) analyses; however, caution is needed when interpret-
ing these findings. Similar results were observed in complete
case analyses (see table 2).
Subgroup analyses in the intervention group only
At T1, there was no statistically significant effect of needing add-
itional clinical investigation on smoking cessation, compared
with receiving a negative result (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 0.89 to
2.47, p=0.09). At T2, there was a clear effect on smoking cessa-
tion of additional clinical investigation compared with a nega-
tive result (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.84, p<0.001). Similar
results were found in complete case analyses (results not
shown).

 behavioural impact of CT screening in a UK high-risk popula-
tion and confirms the findings of previous trials that lung cancer
screening does not falsely reassure smokers or reduce their
motivation to stop smoking. The net UKLS Trial cessation rate
was 11% in the short term and 22% at up to 2 years follow-up
—both higher than the background cessation rate of 4% in the
general UK population. For participants who underwent CT
screening, the short-term quit rate of 14% was similar to that of
the Dutch-Belgian NELSON Trial12 and higher than that of the
DLCST
.11 Participating in the UKLS appeared to prompt
smoking cessation overall, with a differential and positive effect
of lung screening at short-term and longer-term follow-up.
While a degree of caution is needed due to imputation of
missing responders as smokers,22 the present findings indicate
that smoking cessation was higher in the intervention arm and
that engaging in CT lung cancer screening increased the likeli-
hood of stopping smoking in the longer term. Despite concerns
about a negative lung screen offering a ‘licence to smoke’,10
there was no evidence that UKLS screening participants who
received an all-clear CT result were less likely to quit. Analysis
indicated that a positive CT scan result prompted smoking cessa-
tion in the longer term compared with participants who were
not screened and participants who received a negative scan, sug-
gesting that a positive lung screening result may provide an add-
itional stimulus for quitting over and above that of screening
participation. This mirrors the findings of other controlled
trials, including the DLCST11 and US NLST
,14 where smokers
with identified abnormalities were more likely to stop smoking
than those with normal results.
The current evidence suggests that an integrated package of
CT lung screening and smoking cessation support has the poten-
tial to expedite quitting in smokers who are motivated and recep-
tive. The voluntary nature of the trial meant that smokers who
took
part
were
self-selected
and
may already

 contemplating quitting.25 It is difficult, therefore, to directly
attribute smoking cessation to UKLS participation, although
Ostroff et al10 reported that smokers who quit after CT lung
screening ascribed their decision to screening participation. In
the current trial, we observed a marginal trend towards higher
baseline distress in those who reported quitting in the short term,
which suggests that experiencing a degree of concern about lung
cancer
may
be
necessary
to
galvanise
smoking
cessation.
However, we did not directly assess baseline quit intentions, and
future evaluations of CT lung screening would therefore benefit
from
examining
the
influence
of
both
mood-related
and
smoking-related cognitions on behavioural outcomes.
The limitations of sample size and study design are acknowl-
edged. The UKLS Trial was not specifically designed to test the
effects of lung screening combined with smoking cessation
support;
hence,
the
types
of
stop-smoking
interventions
accepted by participants were not recorded, nor were compara-
tive data available on cessation rates in the Liverpool and
Papworth regions during the life of the trial. It was not possible
to ascertain the moderating role of nicotine dependence or
biochemically validate self-reported smoking behaviour; there-
fore, the current findings should be interpreted cautiously due
to the sole use of self-reported cessation. Nevertheless, the
present study adds to growing evidence that integrating CT lung
screening with evidence-based smoking cessation interventions
could prompt quitting in motivated high-risk smokers. While
our sample was not sufficiently large to examine continued
smoking abstinence in those who reported quitting at short-term
follow-up,
the
NELSON
Trial
indicated
that
combining
low-dose CT screening with smoking cessation advice led to sus-
tained abstinence.12 Most smokers enrolling in CT lung screen-
ing studies are motivated to quit; therefore, it will be critical to
evaluate actual quit rates prompted by screening and whether
they are maintained over time in the context of a lung screening
health service. W
e found that longer-term study retention was
less
likely
in
smokers
who
were
from
socioeconomically
deprived areas and
who had
experience
of lung
cancer.
Evidence from other studies suggests that these high-risk groups
may be deterred from lung screening due to fearful and fatalistic
beliefs
about
lung
cancer

 scepticism.29–31 The consistent association between smoking,
deprivation and lower screening uptake is a problem for public
health that must be addressed in future lung screening.
Implementation of a UK national lung cancer screening pro-
gramme for high-risk groups offers opportunities for smoking
cessation at multiple points in the screening process, from the
initial screening invitation to CT scanning and disclosure of
results.10 Smoking cessation counselling combined with pharma-
cotherapy is effective32–34 and could be successfully implemen-
ted
in
the
lung
screening
setting.35
However,
further
behavioural research is needed to identify ways of engaging
harder to reach smokers and to robustly test the optimal type
and timing of strategies for delivering stop-smoking support to
high-risk participants. Successful integration of evidence-based
strategies for smoking cessation with stratified lung cancer
screening
could
be
a
prudent
use
of
limited
healthcare
resources,
translating
into
major
health
benefits
for
all
smoking-related diseases.
