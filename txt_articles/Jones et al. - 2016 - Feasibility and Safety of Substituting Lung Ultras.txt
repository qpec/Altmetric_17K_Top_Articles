BACKGROUND: Chest radiography (CXR) is the test of choice for diagnosing pneumonia. Lung
ultrasonography (LUS) has been shown to be accurate for diagnosing pneumonia in children
and may be an alternative to CXR. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and safety of
substituting LUS for CXR when evaluating children suspected of having pneumonia.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized control trial comparing LUS with CXR in 191
children from birth to 21 years of age suspected of having pneumonia in an ED. Patients in
the investigational arm underwent LUS. If there was clinical uncertainty after ultrasonog-
raphy, physicians had the option to perform CXR. Patients in the control arm underwent
sequential imaging with CXR followed by LUS. The primary outcome was the rate of CXR
reduction; secondary outcomes were missed pneumonia, subsequent unscheduled health-care
visits, and adverse events between the investigational and control arms.
RESULTS: There was a 38.8% reduction (95% CI, 30.0%-48.9%) in CXR among investigational
subjects compared with no reduction (95% CI, 0.0%-3.6%) in the control group. Novice and
experienced physician-sonologists achieved 30.0% and 60.6% reduction in CXR use,
respectively. There were no cases of missed pneumonia among all study participants
(investigational arm, 0.0%: 95% CI, 0.0%-2.9%; control arm, 0.0%: 95% CI, 0.0%-3.0%), or
differences in adverse events, or subsequent unscheduled health-care visits between arms.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be feasible and safe to substitute LUS for CXR when evaluating
children suspected of having pneumonia with no missed cases of pneumonia or increase in
rates of adverse events.

 Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children
worldwide.1 Children with pneumonia may initially
present with fever, cough, and tachypnea. However,
these signs and symptoms are commonly seen in viral
respiratory infections as well and therefore do not
reliably predict bacterial pneumonia.2 Other clinical
examination findings, including those obtained by
means of auscultation, have also proven to be
unreliable.3-5 Chest radiography (CXR) is considered the
test of choice for diagnosing pneumonia in children.
The World Health Organization, however, has estimated
that as many as three-quarters of the world’s population
do not have access to diagnostic imaging.6
Use of point-of-care lung ultrasonography (LUS) is
growing,7-9 with published international evidence-based
recommendations available.10 LUS for diagnosing
pneumonia in children has been shown to be highly
accurate in multiple settings.9,11,12
Given the limited availability of radiography in the
developing world, LUS may be a substitute for CXR in the
diagnosis of pneumonia.6 In health-care settings with
access to advanced imaging, LUS may also function as
a triage instrument to determine the need for CT or
magnetic resonance imaging (in cases of complex
pneumonia) or as an add-on test when prior imaging,
such as CXR, is nondiagnostic.13 Additionally, as
ultrasonography is portable, less costly than radiography,
and safe for children,14 it may be the imaging modality of
choice for all health-care settings for the diagnosis of
pneumonia. Our objective was to determine the
feasibility and safety of substituting LUS for CXR when
evaluating children suspected of having pneumonia.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a randomized control trial of diagnostic tests15 from
August 1, 2012, to July 31, 2013, at an urban pediatric ED (PED).
Our institutional review board, the Program for the Protection of
Human Subjects at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,
approved
this
study
12-00153.
The
study
population
was
a
convenience sample of patients (enrolled 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week
by
available
study
physicians)
who
met
predetermined
inclusion criteria and from whom written informed consent and
assent in those $ 7 years of age had been obtained from the patient
or guardian prior to enrollment into the study.
Inclusion criteria consisted of patients from birth to 21 years of age
presenting to the PED with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia
requiring CXR for evaluation. Pneumonia was suspected in patients
with a combination of fever, cough, tachypnea, or abnormal findings
at auscultation. We excluded patients with a previously performed
CXR or those who were hemodynamically unstable.
Before enrollment, study physicians assessed for signs and symptoms
of pneumonia. Physicians obtained a history on a standardized data
collection form, documenting presence or absence of fever, cough,
difficulty breathing, chest pain, and abdominal pain. Triage vital
signs were recorded.
Study
sonologists
(physicians
who
obtained
and
interpreted
ultrasonographic images) consisted of 15 PED attending physicians
and fellows with varying levels of point-of-care ultrasonographic
experience. They underwent a 1-hour LUS training session prior to
study start. A six-zone scanning protocol of the chest (video with
scanning protocol, normal lung and pneumonia: https://youtu.be/
R60PgPKQNeU) was used as described by Shah et al,12 imaging the
chest in perpendicular planes in the midclavicular line anteriorly and
posteriorly on the chest, and in the midaxillary line from the axillae
to the diaphragm. Training consisted of a 30-minute lecture on
recognition of disease16-18 (Fig 1) and potential errors followed by a
30-minute hands-on scanning session of normal models.12 Similar to
methods used in prior studies,11,12 study sonologists used the
sonographic finding of lung consolidation with air bronchograms as
the definition of pneumonia on LUS.10 For purposes of analysis,
subcentimeter pneumonia was defined as focal lung consolidations
with sonographic air bronchograms less than 1 cm in diameter that
are undetectable with CXR (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v¼JHmBiIlu5oQ&feature¼youtu.be).12
B-lines
(defined
as
hyperechoic vertical reverberation artifact arising from the pleural
line to the bottom of the ultrasound screen without fading, and
move synchronously with lung sliding),10 confluent B-lines, and
small subpleural consolidations (with no air bronchograms) as
described by Caiulo et al17 and Tsung et al18 were considered
ultrasonographic findings viral in etiology.
Random Assignment
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned using an Internet-based
randomization
program
(www.SherlockMD.org).
Patients
were
assigned to investigational and control arms with the use of
permuted
blocks
of
variable
lengths,
stratified
by
sonologist
experience. All PED staff, patients, and guardians were aware of
group assignments, as blinding of allocation was not feasible for this
study.
Study Intervention
All subjects randomly assigned to the investigational arm underwent
LUS with use of a 10- to 5-MHz linear-array transducer (M-Turbo;
SonoSite). If there was clinical uncertainty, or if the referring
physician,
admitting
service,
or
guardian
requested
CXR,
the
enrolling physician had the option of performing CXR. These
reasons
for
performing
CXR
were
documented
on
our
data
collection form. All subjects randomly assigned to the control arm
underwent sequential imaging with CXR first followed by LUS.
All treatment decisions were left to the physician’s discretion. In
the
investigational
arm,
enrolling
physicians
documented
LUS
interpretations prior to CXR to maintain blinding to CXR results.

 Radiologists interpreting CXRs (posterior-anterior and lateral views)
were blinded to all LUS results.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was to determine whether LUS can be a safe
substitute for CXR when evaluating children suspected of having
pneumonia. Specifically, we hypothesized that LUS could reduce
CXR use in the investigational arm compared with the control arm
(with control patients possibly leaving PED prior to CXR). Analysis
was further stratified by experience, defining novice and experienced
sonologists as those who had performed # 25 and >25 LUS
examinations, respectively, on the basis of the American College of
Emergency Physicians ultrasonographic guidelines.19 The secondary
outcomes included the following: (1) unscheduled health-care visits
within 1 to 2 weeks after the index ED visit to determine disposition
and clinical course of enrolled children, (2) rates of antibiotic use,
(3) ED length of stay (EDLOS), and (4) hospital admission rates.
Study physicians monitored children for adverse events (death or
clinical deterioration requiring resuscitation) during observation in
the PED. We defined missed pneumonia as diagnosed by a health-
care provider during a repeat ED or other health care visit with
radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia and initiation of
antibiotics. A patient safety monitoring board, included physicians
not involved with patient enrollment, monitored for any adverse
events.
Quality assurance was performed by investigators-sonologists (B. P. J.,
E. T. T., and J. W. T.). They reviewed all ultrasonographic images and
video to classify errors made by study sonologists and to calculate
interobserver
agreement
(Cohen’s
kappa)
for
the
diagnosis
of
pneumonia between enrolling sonologists’ interpretations and an
investigator sonologist (J. W. T.) blinded to clinical examination
findings.
To measure potential cost savings from a payer perspective, we
performed a cost analysis by using the difference between $37020 as
the average CXR cost in the United States and $140, the cost for
point-of-care ultrasonography at our institution, which is similar to
national estimates (J. Resnick, MD, personal communication, August
2015), and multiplied by the number of times CXR was not used in
the investigational arm.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the sample size required to provide more than
80% power (with a two-sided alpha level of .05) to detect an absolute
reduction in CXR use of 15% or more in the investigational group.
The enrollment period was planned for at least 1 year or a minimum
of 60 subjects per arm. An interim analysis for monitoring of
excess adverse events, including missed pneumonia, was performed
on 60 enrolled subjects with the patient safety monitoring board.
The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle,
with all patients included in their assigned group. A secondary
subgroup analysis for EDLOS examined patients who did and those
who did not undergo CXR in the investigational group.
All outcomes between groups were compared by using a Pearson chi-
squared test. The alpha level was set at .05 for all analyses, 95% CIs
were calculated, and all comparisons were two tailed. Data analysis
was performed with the use of SPSS 20.0 (IBM).

 Results
Two hundred eleven children were screened for study
eligibility, and 191 were enrolled and randomly
assigned (Fig 2). All baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics were similar in both groups (Table 1).
Mean (SD) LUS examination duration was 7 (3)
minutes.
Main Outcomes
We found a 38.8% (95% CI, 30.0%-48.9%) reduction in
CXR use in the investigational arm compared with no
reduction (95% CI, 0.0%-3.6%) in the control arm. The
number needed to treat per scan was 2.5, so for every 2.5
children who undergo LUS, 1 can be spared CXR.
Pneumonia was diagnosed radiographically in 14 of 103
patients in the investigational arm and 12 of 88 patients
in the control arm. Dispositions and outcomes are
presented in e-Figure 1. A sample of correlated CXR and
LUS images are available at this link: https://youtu.be/
AuIeQaZs7EI?list¼PLHg2xyua_KjtS_bBnMWlmJH1
ujUPnA92n.
For novice and experienced sonologists, we found a
30.0% (95% CI, 23.5%-36.5%) and 60.6% (95% CI,
47.0%-74.1%) reduction in CXR use, respectively,
between arms. For patients # 2 years and > 2 years, there
were 47.9% (95% CI, 34%-62%) and 30.9% (95% CI,
19.5%-44.9%) reductions in CXR use, respectively,
between arms.
Including CXR performed after conclusive LUS results
at the request of the admitting service (n ¼ 16), referring
primary care physician (n ¼ 6), or parent or guardian
(n ¼ 7), there was a potential maximal reduction in CXR
of 67% (95% CI, 59.9%-75.0%). The number needed to
treat per scan was 1.5, so for every 1.5 children who
undergo LUS, 1 can be spared CXR.
Secondary Outcomes
Results for secondary outcomes are presented in Table 2.
There were no statistically significant differences with
respect to missed pneumonia (investigational arm,
0.0%: 95% CI, 0.0%-2.9%; control arm, 0.0%: 95% CI,
0.0%-3.0%), unscheduled health-care visits, rates of
consolidated pneumonia visible radiographically, rates
of antibiotic use at the index ED visit, overall median
EDLOS, and hospital admission rates between groups. A
statistically significant difference was observed for the
EDLOS in the LUS-only subgroup of the investigational
arm compared with the control arm (Table 2).

 supplemental e-Tables 1 and 2. There were no adverse
events as a result of subjects’ undergoing LUS. No changes
in treatment or missed pneumonia were found in those
investigational patients for whom enrolling sonologists
thought CXR was unnecessary but who performed CXR
because of parental, primary care physician, or admitting
team request. There was one death among subjects
enrolled in the control arm (sepsis from central line
infection) that was determined to be unrelated to the
study by the data safety monitoring board. The reduction
in CXR use in the investigational arm resulted in an
overall cost reduction of $9,200 in our study.
The Cohen’s kappa between enrolling sonologist and
expert reviewing sonologist for the overall study was
0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.90). No dynamic air bronchograms,
a highly specific finding for pneumonia described
in adults,21 were noted in any lung consolidations
identified by enrolling sonologists or at expert quality
assurance review.
Discussion
Determining whether a new diagnostic test can serve
as a substitute, a triage instrument,18 or an add-on
test to an existing test13 requires more than a simple
assessment of its sensitivity and specificity.15 Data
demonstrating the high accuracy of LUS for evaluating
pneumonia in children has been published and reviewed
from multiple settings around the world.9-12 Data
comparing important patient-centered outcomes
between diagnostic testing pathways using point-of-care
ultrasonography by using randomized control trial
design are available for adults8,22 but have not been
obtained for children.
Our study comparing LUS first with selective CXR against
CXR followed by LUS in evaluating children suspected of
having pneumonia decreased CXR use by 38.8%. There
were no cases of pneumonia missed based on clinical
follow-up or adverse patient outcomes among those who
underwent LUS alone, thus demonstrating that it may be
feasible and safe to substitute LUS for CXR when
evaluating children suspected of having pneumonia.
Widespread use of LUS could have large savings in
health-care costs. The reduction in CXR use in the
investigational arm resulted in an overall cost reduction
of $9,200 in our study. Substantial cost savings may be
obtained because of the large decrease in radiography
use demonstrated in our study. However, we did not
perform a formal economic analysis incorporating
precise medical costs; hospital costs; and indirect costs
such as radiation-induced cancers, parental days off
work, patient utilities, or sensitivity analyses.
Ultrasonography emits no radiation and poses no
increased lifetime cancer risk in infants and children.14
LUS may be an alternative imaging option in children
who are at high risk for radiation-induced cancers23 and
have undergone multiple radiographic or CT imaging
studies.24-27
Another potential benefit is more efficient ED
throughput. Our mean LUS examination times were

 the same as those reported by Shah et al.12 Our intention-
to-treat analysis showed a nonsignificant 26.5-minute
reduction in EDLOS in favor of the investigational arm.
Nevertheless, our result is consistent with data published
by Kocher et al28 and Stiell et al,29,30 showing radiography
added at least 27 or more minutes to EDLOS.
We suspected LUS would increase the rate of antibiotic
treatment because of its ability to detect subcentimeter
lung consolidations.12,18 CXR can miss solitary
pulmonary nodules averaging from 1.6 to 1.8 cm (range,
0.4-5.5 cm) in patients suspected of having lung
cancer.31-33 Similarly, Shah et al12 (in table 2 in their
article) observed that subcentimeter consolidations in
patients suspected of having pneumonia were not
detected with CXR and that in the three cases that
involved equivocal CXR readings for pneumonia, the
corresponding lung consolidations on LUS measured 1.5
to 1.8 cm (in depth from the pleural line), suggesting a
limit for CXR in detecting small pneumonia.
In our study, there was a 10.6% difference (Table 2)
(37.9%, investigational arm; 27.3%, control arm) in the
rates of antibiotic use between the two arms. This
statistically nonsignificant difference was likely because
of LUS’s ability to detect small, subcentimeter lung
consolidations undetectable on CXR.12 There were
14.6% children with subcentimeter lung consolidations
in the investigational arm and 4.5% children with
subcentimeter lung consolidations in the control arm.
We speculate that the enrolling sonologists may
have relied on CXR more than on the subsequent
ultrasonographic images in the decision to treat with
antibiotics in the control arm, or were more concerned
with missing pneumonia in patients in the investigational
arm or both. However, a minority of the enrolled patients
with subcentimeter lung consolidations with air
bronchograms required admission to the hospital with
intravenous antibiotics because of fever, hypoxia, or
respiratory distress (five of 13 in each arm) (e-Fig 1); this
number was similar to that observed and documented by
Shah et al12 (three of 12). Further research is needed to
determine whether subcentimeter lung consolidations
require treatment with antibiotics or whether a watchful
waiting approach can be adopted similar to treatment for
acute otitis media for improved antibiotic stewardship.
Our study had several limitations. First, this was a
single-center study performed in a PED of a general
academic medical center and may not generalize to
other PEDs or health-care settings. However, reports of
LUS with highly accurate pediatric pneumonia diagnosis
from around the world have been published in a
meta-analysis,9 and LUS has been used as the only
imaging modality for evaluating childhood pneumonia
in resource-limited settings,34 which may suggest
otherwise. Second, we were unable to calculate test
performance characteristics adhering to the Standards
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy35 because 38.8% of
the subjects in the investigational arm did not undergo
CXR that would have served as a practical reference
standard (e-Tables 1, 2).12 By design, the sonologists
were not blinded to CXR results in the control arm so
that the information could be used to guide treatment.
Lack of blinding to a reference standard could be a
potential source of bias in calculated test performance
characteristics for LUS. Additionally, test performance
characteristics of LUS in the investigational arm would
not be directly comparable with test performance
characteristics of LUS in the control arm (e-Table 2).
Chest CT imaging would allow direct comparison of
accuracy between CXR and ultrasonography36; however,
performing chest CT imaging in all patients was not
practical and not standard of care. Furthermore, we have
used the same techniques reported in our own prior
study12 and similar to those in other studies that have
shown high test performance characteristics for LUS.9,11
No missed pneumonias occurred with selective use of
CXR in the investigational arm and sequential imaging
(LUS as an add-on test after CXR) in the control arm.
Third, because of the inherent design of our study, there
was a high probability that the CXR use rate in the
control arm would be at or near 100%. However, there
was a small possibility of control patients leaving prior
to CXR because of prolonged ED waiting times, which
did not occur. Fourth, a control arm in which subjects
did not undergo any imaging may have yielded valuable
information in comparing diagnostic imaging with a
purely clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. However, there
were ethical concerns about withholding the option of
performing CXR in patients enrolled into a nonimaging
control arm. Fifth, physicians treating study participants
could not be blinded to group assignments, so they were
required to integrate LUS findings into the clinical
decision-making process. This lack of blinding may have
introduced bias toward more rapid provision of care in
the investigational arm. Sixth, our study may not have
had sufficient power to detect statistically significant
differences in the secondary outcomes of interest, such
as missed pneumonia, unscheduled health-care visits,
subcentimeter lung consolidations, and antibiotic
treatment rates. Lastly, we note an imbalance in subjects
136

 enrolled between our investigational and control arms.
To accomplish random assignment stratified by
sonologist experience, sonologists were assigned variable
block lengths of four to 20 subjects. This method was
used to maintain allocation concealment prior to
randomization but had the inadvertent effect of
unblocking our overall study when sonologists did not
complete their assigned block lengths to balance random
assignment between groups. However, proportions of
demographic and baseline characteristics between
groups were similar and not statistically different from
each other, and the imbalance did not appear to bias any
of our study outcomes.
Future research can further refine specific scenarios in
which LUS in conjunction with clinical prediction rules2
can safely achieve higher substitution rates for CXR in
the evaluation of children suspected of having
pneumonia. Additionally, pairing point-of-care LUS
with the World Health Organization algorithm may
improve management and outcomes for childhood
pneumonia in resource-limited settings, particularly
those with no access to diagnostic imaging
technologies.6,34
In conclusion, we observed a significant reduction in
CXR use when LUS was used as the initial diagnostic
imaging test. It may be feasible and safe to substitute
LUS for CXR when evaluating children suspected of
having pneumonia with no missed cases of pneumonia
or statistically significant increase in rates of adverse
events. However, further research is needed to
investigate the effect of LUS on antibiotic use and
stewardship.
