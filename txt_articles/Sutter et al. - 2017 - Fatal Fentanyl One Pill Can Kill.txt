ABSTRACT
Objective: The current national opioid epidemic is a public health emergency. We have identified an outbreak of
exaggerated opioid toxicity caused by fentanyl adulterated tablets purchased on the street as hydrocodone/
acetaminophen.
Methods: Over an 8-day period in late March 2016, a total of 18 patients presented to our institution with
exaggerated opioid toxicity. The patients provided a similar history: ingesting their “normal dose” of hydrocodone/
acetaminophen tablets but with more pronounced symptoms. Toxicology testing and analysis was performed on
serum, urine, and surrendered pills.
Results: One of the 18 patients died in hospital. Five patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, one
required extracorporeal life support, three required intubation, and two received bag-valve-mask ventilation. One
patient had recurrence of toxicity after 8 hours after naloxone discontinuation. Seventeen of 18 patients required
boluses of naloxone, and four required prolonged naloxone infusions (26–39 hours). All 18 patients tested positive
for fentanyl in the serum. Quantitative assays conducted in 13 of the sera revealed fentanyl concentrations of 7.9
to 162 ng/mL (mean = 52.9 ng/mL). Pill analysis revealed fentanyl amounts of 600–6,900 lg/pill. The pills are
virtually indistinguishable from authentic hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets and are similar in weight. To date,
our county has reported 56 cases of fentanyl opioid toxicity, with 15 fatalities. In our institution, the outbreak has
stressed the capabilities and resources of the emergency department and intensive care units.
Conclusions: A serious outbreak of exaggerated opioid toxicity caused by fentanyl-adulterated tablets
purchased on the street as hydrocodone/acetaminophen is under way in California. These patients required
higher dosing and prolonged infusions of naloxone. Additionally, observation periods off naloxone were extended
due to delayed, recurrent toxicity. The outbreak has serious ramifications for public health and safety, law
enforcement, and healthcare facilities and resources.
T
he current nationwide opioid epidemic for both
prescription and illicit drugs is a public health
emergency.1 Prescription opioids have now surpassed
homicide as a cause of mortality.2 This epidemic has
resulted in multiple agencies, including the U.S. Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issu-
ing guidelines aimed at altering prescribing practices
in an attempt to decrease morbidity and mortality.3–5
However, limiting legally obtained prescription opioids
only addresses a part of the epidemic. In a 2014
CDC national survey, 10.3 million persons reported
taking prescription opioids “recreationally,” that is,
opioids that had not been prescribed for them.1,6
These supposed prescription drugs are often pur-
chased illegally and are at risk for drug adulteration.
Previous fentanyl outbreaks exist; however, this out-
break demonstrated pills marketed as a typical pharma-
ceutical pill but with more severe toxicity.7–9 Patients

 reported the use of pharmaceutical opioid pills, and
thus an opioid presentation was not surprising, but
the clinical ramifications were different. In this report,
we describe 18 cases of patients taking fentanyl-adulter-
ated pills disguised as hydrocodone/acetaminophen
(10 mg/325 mg), that to date have led to 56 overall
cases, and 15 fatalities, in a single California county.
The consequences of this public health outbreak for
hospitals, public health and safety, and federal law
enforcement are discussed.
CASE SERIES
Index Patient
Recently, a series of patients presented to a single
urban academic emergency department with symptoms
suggestive of a severe opioid overdose after reportedly
taking hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets purchased
on the street. The index patient was a 24-year-old male
who presented on March 23, 2016, with hypotension
and hypoxic respiratory failure. Prehospital providers
had obtained a history on the scene indicating that
the patient had taken hydrocodone/acetaminophen
pills and that he complained of “not feeling right” and
“feeling really high” from taking his “normal amount.”
The patient’s clinical condition deteriorated during
prehospital transport. Naloxone was given via the
intranasal route (2 mg) and intravenously (1 mg) with-
out significant response. In the emergency department,
the patient continued to be hypotensive (systolic blood
pressure 90 mm Hg) and hypoxemic (oxygen satura-
tion 60%–70% on 100% nonrebreather mask). Addi-
tional intravenous naloxone (2 mg) did not improve
his condition.
The
patient
was
intubated.
Chest
radiographs
revealed evidence of pulmonary edema. He continued
to be hypoxemic and developed pulseless electrical
activity but responded to 1 mg of epinephrine and car-
diopulmonary
resuscitation.
Ventilation
strategies,
including neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium,
inhaled nitric oxide, and prone positioning were insti-
tuted, but he remained hypoxemic and deteriorated
hemodynamically. His B-type natriuretic peptide was
normal at 29 pg/mL, suggesting that his hypoxia was
unlikely from a cardiac source and more likely from
acute lung injury. He was given infusions of nore-
pinephrine, vasopressin, and epinephrine, and venove-
nous extracorporeal life support was administered.
During
the
next
48 hours,
ventilatory
and
hemodynamic support was decreased and then discon-
tinued. Toxicologic testing revealed no acetaminophen,
but the presence of fentanyl, norfentanyl, promet-
hazine, and hydrocodone was revealed.
The patient was extubated on hospital day 7 and
transferred out of the intensive care unit. On day 14,
he was discharged, ambulating without assistance, and
appeared to have normal neurologic function. He
admitted to taking 1½ pills, which he had purchased
on the street, believing that they were hydrocodone/
acetaminophen.
Within the next 8 days after the presentation of the
index patient, our institution cared for 18 patients
with symptoms of an exaggerated opioid overdose.
Additionally, one patient had a repeat respiratory
arrest after being off a naloxone infusion for 8 hours
requiring a naloxone bolus and repeat infusion. One
of the 18 patients died in hospital. Five patients
underwent
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation,
one
required extracorporeal life support, three required
intubation, and two received bag-valve-mask ventila-
tion. Seventeen of 18 patients required boluses of
naloxone, and four required prolonged naloxone infu-
sions (26–39 hours). A summary of the patients’ clini-
cal course is presented in Table 1. All 18 patients
tested positive for fentanyl in the serum, with concen-
trations of 7.9 to 162.3 ng/mL (mean, 52.9 ng/mL)
for those who had samples available for quantification.
A summary of complete toxicologic testing of biologic
samples as well as pills obtained from the patient are
listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Figure 1 shows
a comparison of a pharmaceutical hydrocodone/ac-
etaminophen (10/325) tablet (top) and a tablet pur-
chased on the street (bottom).
Pill
analysis
revealed
fentanyl
amounts
of
600–6,900 lg/pill and smaller amounts of other phar-
maceutical medications (Table 3). Pills were obtained
from six patients who voluntarily provided them for
sampling had a mass ranging from 402 to 489 mg
(mean,
454 mg).
Pharmaceutical
hydrocodone/ac-
etaminophen (M367) was made by Mallinckrodt Phar-
maceuticals; weights of 10 pills, weighed by electronic
scale (range = 422 to 429 mg; mean = 426 mg) were
not significantly different from the weights of the pills
obtained from patients.
Early Epidemiologic Investigation
On March 24, 2016, our institution received its fourth
patient presenting with opioid toxicity and clinical his-
tory similar to that of the index case. We notified our
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE • January 2017, Vol. 24, No. 1 • www.aemj.org
107
 county public health officer of our concerns for an
adulterated street pill being sold as hydrocodone/ac-
etaminophen. Given the severe degree of apparent opi-
oid toxicity, we would have expected to identify
acetaminophen in the blood if this were due to a com-
bination hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablet. However,
no
acetaminophen
was
detected
suggesting
these
tablets were not pharmaceutical grade and likely con-
tained some form of opioid. When preliminary testing
revealed fentanyl and its metabolite, norfentanyl, a
countywide California Health Advisory Notice was
issued (March 25, 2016).10 In addition to traditional
public health notification, our poison center notified
regional hospitals and three additional California poi-
son centers of our observations. By April 1, this out-
break had spread outside our neighboring counties,
and other counties in California began issuing health
alerts.11 At the same time, additional toxicologic test-
ing confirmed our suspicion that the suspect pills con-
tained
large
amounts
of
fentanyl.
Federal
law
enforcement officials from the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA) and the Department of Justice became
involved. Results of our pill analyses were shared with
law enforcement officials, and further intensive investi-
gation is under way.
Laboratory Evaluation
All patients had urine samples tested for amphetami-
nes, cocaine metabolites, opiates, benzodiazepines, and
barbiturates.
Samples
were
tested
by
automated
enzyme assay UniCel DXC800 (Beckman Coulter
Inc.). Comprehensive urine toxicology analysis with
gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, using the
6890 NPD Agilent ChemStation software (Agilent
Technologies), was performed at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Davis. Biologic samples (serum, plasma, and
urine) and pills obtained from patients were sent to
the clinical toxicology and environmental biomonitor-
ing laboratory at the University of California–San
Francisco. Targeted analysis of 610 illicit and designer
drugs with liquid chromatography–quadruple time-of-
flight mass spectrometry (Agilent 1260- QTOF/MS
6550) was performed as well as suspect screening of
55 opioid analogs. Confirmation of drugs detected in
the samples was done with Agilent MassHunter Quali-
tative Analysis software. Quantitation of drugs con-
firmed in both the pill and the biologic samples were
done by use of an isotope dilution method with Agi-

Investigation Oversight and Data Collection
This investigation and data collection were part of an
emergent public health outbreak. Therefore, they were
not considered to be research that required approval
from our institutional review board or informed con-
sent from patients.

 health outbreaks may occur in the emergency depart-
ment. Fentanyl is equipotent to morphine at doses that
are 50–100 times lower.12 Importantly, because fen-
tanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, which does not bear a
structural resemblance to naturally occurring opiates
(morphine, codeine), it is not detected by routine
immunoassay urine drug testing typically used as first-
line screening.13 Therefore, without targeted drug test-
ing, fentanyl is difficult to identify and quantify. The
mean serum concentrations of fentanyl in our patients
(52.9 ng/mL) is markedly higher than therapeutic con-
centrations of 0.63–2.0 ng/mL.9,14,15 Reported post-
mortem serum concentrations of patients who have
died from fentanyl overdoses range from 5–120 ng/
mL (mean = 36 ng/mL).16–18 The pills recovered in
our series had 600–6,900 lg/pill of fentanyl. Even
with oral bioavailability of about 30%, each pill can
readily deliver enough fentanyl to result in toxic serum
concentrations.19 Other medications such as promet-
hazine were also found in our patients’ biologic sam-
ples, which may have contributed to the patients’
feelings of euphoria, but, because of their less severe
toxicity profiles, those drugs likely played minimal roles
in the fatalities or prolonged hospitalizations.
This ongoing outbreak has had several public health
ramifications on the regional, state, and federal levels.
Eight of the 18 patients arrived in our institution
over a 16-hour period. This acute influx placed a
serious strain on our emergency department and inten-
sive care unit. Emergency department and hospital

Sutter et al. • ADULTERATED FENTANYL
 overcrowding is a nationwide problem that is exacer-
bated by acute surges regardless the cause.20–22 In this
outbreak, an even more important issue has been that
of antidote stocking. Our hospital’s supplies of nalox-
one were quickly depleted because of the large number
of patients that presented over a short period of time
and the need of some patients for several milligrams
of naloxone as bolus dosing and prolonged infusion
times. Our hospital required emergency deliveries of
naloxone to keep supplies sufficient for patient care. A
notable clinical difference we observed was not only
the prolonged naloxone infusions but also the recur-
rence of respiratory depression in the hospital after
8 hours of observation without naloxone. Eight hours
is longer than our typical observation period after
naloxone administration, and this left of us with the
clinical quandary of an appropriate observation time.
Patients were observed 6–14 hours based on total
naloxone required and social factors. This resource-
intense surge also affected care throughout the region.
Our institution is the tertiary care referral center for
region. Cumulatively, this placed a heavy load on our
emergency department and intensive care unit and lim-
ited the hospital’s ability to provide care for critically ill
patients from outside institutions. Outbreaks like this
one highlight the importance of not only single-hospi-
tal emergency-preparedness plans, but of plans that
integrate regional health care systems.23,24
The decision to notify public health can be difficult
and no criteria exist that are appropriate for every
scenario. The CDC has provided a protocol for public
health agencies to report disease outbreaks with sug-
gested response times.25 However, these criteria are
mostly for infectious diseases and do not provide guid-
ance to health care providers. Clearly, the more signifi-
cant the public health risk, the lower the threshold to
notify your local public health officer. In our outbreak,
we had three similar patients present within a few
hours of the index case. We felt these presentations
were far more severe than would be expected from
ingesting
one to
two
hydrocodone/acetaminophen
tablets. This exaggerated toxicity, defined by the sever-
ity of illness, in the setting of no detectable acetamino-
phen, was the key finding that triggered us to contact
the local public health officer. This initial public
health notification did not immediately lead to the
public at large being notified, but emergency response
units, hospitals, county coroners, and law enforcement
were contacted. After each of these health and law
enforcement entities were involved, it became clear we
had an ongoing public health event which led to the
notification of the public by the public health depart-
ment. Several months prior in the San Francisco Bay
Area, illicit drugs marketed as “Xanax” were also
found to contain fentanyl.26 These outbreaks illustrate
the ongoing public health problem that exists with
nonpharmaceutical fentanyl. According to the CDC,
since late 2013 several states have reported increasing
deaths related to fentanyl with most due to illicit man-
ufacturing.27 All available resources should be used to
identify and limit future outbreaks of nonpharmaceuti-
cal fentanyl.
Poison centers are a resource that can augment
regional care and coordinate with public health.
Nationwide, poison centers are linked to all hospitals
in a given area and are staffed with a 24-hour-a-day
call center with physician toxicologist oversight. In the
current outbreak, our poison center notified poison
centers statewide of the suspicion of an opioid-related
outbreak, and our poison center, in turn, contacted
local hospitals. The role of poison centers in public
health has been described; the centers can be an
invaluable tool during toxicologic outbreaks.28–30 How-
ever, a limitation of poison centers is that for the cen-
ters to identify an outbreak, health care providers
must initiate contact with the centers. Common causes
of overdose, such as those of opioids, which providers
feel confident in managing, are often underreported.
This underreporting may limit the ability of poison
centers to detect outbreaks of opioid poisoning in the

 early stages. Thus, providers should be encouraged
to report all potential toxicologic issues to a poison
center.
Beyond interaction with traditional public health
entities, this outbreak intersected with both local and
federal law enforcement units. As demonstrated in Fig-
ure 1, the tablet involved was visually very similar to
that
of
pharmaceutical-grade
hydrocodone/ac-
etaminophen tablets, and the weights of both kinds of
pills were similar. Since the pills content was over-
whelmingly fentanyl, which does not legally exist in
pill form, the pills were no doubt manufactured ille-
gally. Federal law mandates that any machine capable
of making and imprinting pills be registered with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.31 It is highly unli-
kely that illegal operations such as the one used to
make these tablets would comply with federal regula-
tions. This leads to concern about ongoing and future
outbreaks if fentanyl can be “repackaged” into various
pill forms. Our collaboration during this outbreak
with the DEA and the U.S. Department of Justice has
brought local, state, and federal (CDC) resources
together with law enforcement agencies to increase
surveillance for fentanyl-related overdoses. This aware-
ness is especially important since identification of fen-
tanyl requires targeted testing; medical personnel, from
health care providers to coroners, should be alert to
request the appropriate testing.
The magnitude of this public health outbreak is still
undetermined, as new cases and fatalities continue to
be reported. The reasons for producing such a concen-
trated fentanyl pill are unclear; whether it represents a
concentration error or nefarious intent is unknown. If
these pills are produced on a large scale, it is possible
that the end distributors were unaware of the degree
of adulteration to their customers. This highlighted the
importance of our interactions with the DEA and
national surveillance as additional outbreaks must be
detected early. Nonetheless, alerting the public and
health care providers of this serious health issue is
paramount to preventing its spread. The importance
of public health surveillance, regardless of the cause of
an outbreak, cannot be overstated. This series of fen-
tanyl overdoses confirms how healthcare providers on
the front lines play an important role in improving
