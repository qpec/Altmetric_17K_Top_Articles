IMPORTANCE Antipsychotics are used increasingly in youth for nonpsychotic and off-label
indications, but cardiometabolic adverse effects and (especially) type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) risk have raised additional concern.
OBJECTIVE To assess T2DM risk associated with antipsychotic treatment in youth.
DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO without language
restrictions from database inception until May 4, 2015. Data analyses were performed in July
2015, and additional analyses were added in November 2015.
STUDY SELECTION Longitudinal studies reporting on T2DM incidence in youth 2 to 24 years
old exposed to antipsychotics for at least 3 months.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent investigators extracted study-level data
for a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression of T2DM risk.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were study-defined T2DM,
expressed as cumulative T2DM risk or as T2DM incidence rate per patient-years. Secondary
outcomes included the comparison of the coprimary outcomes in antipsychotic-treated
youth with psychiatric controls not receiving antipsychotics or with healthy controls
RESULTS Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 185 105 youth
exposed to antipsychotics and 310 438 patient-years. The mean (SD) age of patients was 14.1
(2.1) years, and 59.5% were male. The mean (SD) follow-up was 1.7 (2.3) years. Among them,
7 studies included psychiatric controls (1 342 121 patients and 2 071 135 patient-years), and 8
studies included healthy controls (298 803 patients and 463 084 patient-years).
Antipsychotic-exposed youth had a cumulative T2DM risk of 5.72 (95% CI, 3.45-9.48;
P < .001) per 1000 patients. The incidence rate was 3.09 (95% CI, 2.35-3.82; P < .001) cases
per 1000 patient-years. Compared with healthy controls, cumulative T2DM risk (odds ratio
[OR], 2.58; 95% CI, 1.56-4.24; P < .0001) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) (IRR, 3.02; 95% CI,
1.71-5.35; P < .0001) were significantly greater in antipsychotic-exposed youth. Similarly,
compared with psychiatric controls, antipsychotic-exposed youth had significantly higher
cumulative T2DM risk (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.50-5 2.90; P < .0001) and IRR (IRR, 1.79; 95% CI,
1.31-2.44; P < .0001). In multivariable meta-regression analyses of 10 studies, greater
cumulative T2DM risk was associated with longer follow-up (P < .001), olanzapine
prescription (P < .001), and male sex (P = .002) (r2 = 1.00, P < .001). Greater T2DM incidence
was associated with second-generation antipsychotic prescription (P � .050) and less autism
spectrum disorder diagnosis (P = .048) (r2 = 0.21, P = .044).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although T2DM seems rare in antipsychotic-exposed youth,
cumulative risk and exposure-adjusted incidences and IRRs were significantly higher than in
healthy controls and psychiatric controls. Olanzapine treatment and antipsychotic exposure
time were the main modifiable risk factors for T2DM development in antipsychotic-exposed
youth. Antipsychotics should be used judiciously and for the shortest necessary duration, and
their efficacy and safety should be monitored proactively.

A
ntipsychotics are used increasingly in youth for many
psychiatric disorders, particularly second-generation
antipsychotics (SGAs).1-3 Although antipsychotic use in
youth had long been restricted to schizophrenia spectrum
disorders,4,5 significant data for SGA efficacy have accumu-
lated for nonpsychotic disorders, leading to regulatory ap-
proval for bipolar mania and irritability associated with autis-
ticdisorderandTourettesyndrome.6-9However,antipsychotic
use in youth has broadened substantially to many off-label
indications,10,11includingimpulsivity,mooddysregulation,ag-
gressive behaviors, depression, and anxiety.12-15
Antipsychotic efficacy should be balanced against ad-
verse effects, which requires adequate information concern-
ing their short-term and (especially) long-term risks. Yet, little
is known about long-term risks.16,17 Compared with first-
generation antipsychotics (FGAs), SGAs have significantly
fewerneuromotoradverseeffectsbutgenerallyhavemorecar-
diometabolic consequences, including weight gain, dyslipid-
emia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).16,18-20 Because car-
diometabolic effects, which can start even after short
antipsychotic exposure and at low dosages,18,19,21 are associ-
ated with increased morbidity and premature mortality, they
are a current focus of concern.18,22
Cardiometabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics tend to
appearfasterandtoagreaterextentinyouththaninadults.21,23,24
Antipsychotic treatment results in relevant weight gain in a
significant proportion of youth.23,25-27 Whether this overall
heightened risk of short-term cardiometabolic adverse ef-
fects in youth compared with adults is due to developmental
differences or because of less prior antipsychotic exposure
and lifetime antipsychotic-related weight gain remains
debated.16,17,21
In adults, there is a clear link between antipsychotic treat-
ment and impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and
risk for T2DM that seems to differ across agents,28-30with the
most serious concerns revolving around SGAs.31-33 Despite the
substantial use of SGAs in youth, far less is known about the
T2DM risk in children and adolescents than in adults treated
with antipsychotics.34-36
Given these uncertainties, a much smaller available data-
base regarding the difficult-to-study long-term antipsychotic
adverse effects in young people, and the importance of T2DM
as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease,37 we con-
ducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the in-
cidence of T2DM in antipsychotic-exposed youth compared
with psychiatric controls and healthy controls. In addition, we
sought to identify potential moderators of T2DM risk. Based
on the literature in adults, we hypothesized that antipsy-
chotictreatmentwouldbeassociatedwithsignificantlygreater
T2DM risk than in both control groups.
Methods
ThissystematicreviewwasconductedinaccordwiththeMeta-
analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology38 guide-
lines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-analyses39 standard.
Literature Search
Two independent authors (B.G. and A.R.) searched PubMed/
MEDLINE and PsycINFO without language restrictions from
databaseinceptionuntilMay4,2015,usingthefollowingsearch
terms: (child* OR adolescent* OR pediatric OR youth) and (an-
tipsych*ORneuroleptic)and(hemoglobinA1CORHbA1CORglu-
cose OR hyperglycemia OR diabetes OR prediabetes OR insulin
OR hyperinsulinemia). The electronic search was supple-
mented by a manual review of reference lists from eligible
publications and relevant reviews. Authors were contacted for
additional information.
Inclusion Criteria
We included longitudinal studies reporting on the incidence
of T2DM (defined by American Diabetes Association40 crite-
ria),prescriptionofantidiabeticmedications,orrecordedmedi-
cal diagnosis of T2DM in at least 20 youth 0 to 24 years old
exposed to antipsychotics for at least 3 months. When avail-
able,T2DMincidencedatawereincludedfrompsychiatriccon-
trols unexposed to antipsychotics or from healthy controls.
Studies of individuals with T2DM at baseline that reported on
the proportion receiving antipsychotics were ineligible for
inclusion.
Data Abstraction
Two of us (B.G. and A.R.) abstracted all data, and any incon-
sistencies were resolved by consensus or by a third author
(C.U.C.). When articles reported on overlapping samples, de-
tails of the largest study sample for each respective outcome
were included.
Data Analysis
Demographicinformationaboutthepooledstudysampleswas
calculated by weighting the study mean values according to
sample size. The unadjusted, cumulative T2DM risk was com-
puted as the number of patients with new onset of study-
defined T2DM divided by the number of individuals free of
T2DM diagnosis and T2DM treatment at baseline. Incidence
rates per patient-year were computed by dividing the num-
ber of patients with study-defined T2DM by the number of pa-
tient-years of follow-up. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were
computedbycomparingtheunadjusted,cumulativeT2DMrisk
in youth exposed to antipsychotics vs the unadjusted, cumu-
lative T2DM risk in psychiatric control youth or healthy con-
trol youth and between the 2 control groups. Incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs were used to compare the T2DM in-
cidence rates per patient-year in antipsychotic-exposed youth
vs psychiatric control youth or healthy control youth and
between the 2 control groups. Data were analyzed with a
software program (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version
2;http://www.meta-analysis.com).Allanalysesusedarandom-
effects model41 and were 2-sided, with α = .05. Hetero-
geneity was assessed with the I2 statistic,42 where I2 of at
least 50% indicated significant heterogeneity. The number
needed to harm (NNH) was calculated by dividing 1 by the risk
difference.
We also conducted exploratory subgroup, sensitivity, and
meta-regression analyses to identify potential moderators of

theunadjusted,cumulativeT2DMriskandincidencerateinan-
tipsychotic-exposed youth. The subgroup analyses examined
whether the T2DM risk was replicated when separately analyz-
ing studies restricting their sample to youth 18 years and
younger.ThesensitivityanalysesexaminedwhethertheT2DM
risk was replicated when separately analyzing (1) studies with
different T2DM definitions, (2) studies that potentially in-
cluded type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), (3) studies that poten-
tially included patients with a prescription of oral antidiabetic
medications for reasons other than T2DM, and (4) studies af-
terexcludingonestudy23with100%olanzapine-treatedyouth.
After excluding a significant effect of study quality using
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale43 (NOS) on the results, a back-
wardeliminationmixedrandom-effectsmeta-regressionanaly-
sis was conducted with the initial variables of sex, age, sample
size, percentage of patients with specific psychiatric diagno-
ses, and percentage of patients receiving SGAs (pooled). A sec-
ond meta-regression analysis replaced pooled SGAs with per-
centage of patients receiving specific SGAs. Variables were
entered into the initial backward elimination model if in uni-
variable analyses they reached P < .20. Publication bias was
assessed with the funnel plot, Egger regression test,44 and the
“trim and fill” method.45 Finally, descriptive statistical meth-
ods were used for the exploratory summary of study-
reported correlates of T2DM incidence based on patient-level
data not available for study-level meta-regression analyses.
Results
Theinitialsearchproduced4647results,and4517studieswere

erences,117wereexcludedafterfull-textreview,yielding13meta-
analyzablestudies23,34,35,46-55(1studyreportedon2subsetsbased
on antipsychotic class) (eFigure in the Supplement).
Study Characteristics
Eleven studies34,35,47,48,50-55 (n = 1 825 343) were retrospective
database investigations, 2 studies46,49 (n = 565) were prospec-
tive naturalistic cohort investigations, and 1 study23 (n = 121)
pooled data from 6 prospective olanzapine investigations. The
mean (SD) NOS score was 7.4 (1.8), and the median NOS score
was 8. Twelve of the 13 studies of antipsychotic-exposed youth
provided information on the mean (SD) follow-up duration,
whichwas1.7(2.3)years(310438patient-years).Thestudyqual-
ity was high overall, with scores between 7 and 9 on the NOS in
allbut2studies,whichhadscoresof3and4,respectively(eTable
1 in the Supplement).
Eight studies34,46-48,50,52,55 compared data with a healthy
control group, and the mean (SD) follow-up was 1.6 (2.9) years
(463 084 patient-years). Seven studies34,35,47,48,51,53,54 had a
psychiatric control group, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 1.6
(3.1) years (2 071 135 patient-years). Two studies23,49 did not
have a control group (Table 1).
Patient and Treatment Characteristics
The mean (SD) age of the antipsychotic-exposed sample
(n = 185 105) was 14.1 (2.1) years (age range, 2-24 years), and a
mean (SD) of 59.5% (8.0%) were male. The mean (SD) age of
the psychiatric controls (n = 1 342 121) was 13.8 (1.1) years (age
range, 5-24 years), and a mean (SD) of 55.7% (9.2%) were male.
The mean (SD) age of the healthy controls (n = 298 803) was
13.9(3.2)years(agerange,4-19years),andamean(SD)of52.6%
(9.0%) were male.
In the antipsychotic-exposed sample, most had a disrup-
tive behavior disorder (DBD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) (in 46.9%) or a mood spectrum disorder, in-
cluding mood disorder not otherwise specified (in 22.8%,), de-
pression (in 26.9%), bipolar disorder (BPD) (in 16.2%), and BPD
or psychosis (in 5.1%). Less commonly observed were anxiety
disorders(in7.9%),psychosis(in5.7%),pervasivedevelopmen-
tal disorder or autism (in 5.3%), substance abuse disorder (in
4.6%), and tic disorders (in 0.0003%). In the psychiatric con-
trolgroup,thepsychiatricdiagnosesweremainlyDBDorADHD
(in 51.8%) and mood spectrum disorder (in 34.1%). Other diag-
noses included anxiety disorders (in 8.7%), pervasive develop-
mental disorder or autism (in 5.4%), psychosis (in 0.3%), and
substance use disorders (in 0.2%).
All but one study53 provided general information regard-
ing antipsychotic treatment class, consisting predominantly
of SGAs (in 94.9% [n = 169 621]), with few youth being treated
with FGAs (in 3.7% [n = 6744]) or combinations of 2 or more
antipsychotics (in 2.4% [n = 4309]). In 10 studies with spe-
cific antipsychotic use data, risperidone was the most
commonly used (41.7%), followed by quetiapine fumarate
(26.6%), aripiprazole (17.2%), and olanzapine (10.2%).
Outcome Definitions
The analyzed studies used the following definitions of T2DM:
(1) the prescription of an antidiabetic medication or a clinical
diagnosis of T2DM (6 studies35,47,50,53-55 [42.9%]), (2) T2DM di-
agnosis based on a fasting blood glucose level of at least 126
mg/dL (2 studies23,46 [14.3%]) (to convert glucose level to mil-
limoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), (3) a recorded T2DM di-
agnosis and antidiabetic medication prescription (2 studies52
[14.3%]), (4) an antidiabetic medication prescription only (1
study51 with 2 separate samples [7.2%]), (5) a clinical diagnosis
ofT2DMonly(1study48[7.2%]),(6)aquestionnaire-basedT2DM
diagnosis (1 study49 [7.2%]), or (7) a T2DM diagnosis, antidia-
betic medication, glycated hemoglobin level of at least 7%, or
random plasma glucose level of at least 200 mg/dL (1 study34
[7.2%]). Regarding T2DM definition, 7 studies23,34,46,47,49,50,53
potentially included cases of T1DM, while 5 studies34,47,50,53,54
would have potentially included patients treated with oral an-
tidiabetic medications for reasons other than T2DM (Table 1).
Procedures to reduce confounding, including matching
and multivariable analysis, are summarized in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
T2DM in Antipsychotic-Exposed Youth, Psychiatric
Controls, and Healthy Controls
The meta-analytically calculated T2DM risk was highest in the
antipsychotic-exposed cohort, with an unadjusted, cumula-
tive risk of 5.72 (95% CI, 3.45-9.48) per 1000 patients and an in-
cidence rate of 3.09 (95% CI, 2.35-3.82) per 1000 patient-years
(P < .001 for both). The risk was intermediate in psychiatric

patient-years (P < .001 for both) (Table 2).
Subtractingtheriskinpsychiatriccontrolsandhealthycon-
trols from that in antipsychotic-exposed youth, these num-
bers translate into an excess of 3.11 and 3.57 new T2DM cases
per 1000 psychiatric controls and healthy controls, or an NNH
of 322 and 280, respectively. With regard to the incidence, the
numbers correspond to an excess of 1.35 and 2.41 T2DM cases
per 1000 patient-years of antipsychotic exposure or follow-up
compared with psychiatric controls and healthy controls, or an
NNH of 740 or 398 per patient-year, respectively.
T2DM in Antipsychotic-Exposed Youth vs Psychiatric
Controls and Healthy Controls
Compared with psychiatric controls, T2DM risk was signifi-
cantly greater in antipsychotic-exposed youth compared with
psychiatric controls, with an OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.50-2.90;
P < .001) and an IRR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.31-2.44; P < .001). In ad-
dition, T2DM risk was significantly greater in antipsychotic-
exposed youth compared with healthy controls, with an OR
of 2.58 (95% CI, 1.56-4.24; P < .001) and an IRR of 3.02 (95%
CI, 1.71-5.35; P < .001) (Table 2). These findings were based on
8studies(298 803patientsand463 084patient-years)(Figure1
and Figure 2). Furthermore, psychiatric controls had higher
T2DM risk than healthy controls, with an OR of 1.57 (95% CI,
1.29-1.90; P < .001) and an IRR of 2.02 (95% CI, 1.42-2.87;
P < .001) (Table 2).
No publication bias was identified for any of the compari-
sons (P = .39 to P = .72 for cumulative, unadjusted risk and
P = .26 to P = .91 for incidence) (Egger regression test). In the
antipsychotic-exposed youth vs psychiatric controls, the trim
and fill method identified one missing study in the compari-
son of cumulative, unadjusted risk (adjusted OR, 1.96; 95% CI,
1.44-2.66; P < .001) and 2 missing studies in the comparison
oftheincidence(adjustedIRR,1.51;95%CI,1.13-2.01;P < .001).
Sensitivity Analyses: Moderation of the Results by Precision
of T2DM Definition and Study Quality
The results of the unadjusted, cumulative T2DM risk and in-
cidence, as well as those of the group comparisons, were rep-
licatedindependentofT2DMdefinition,thepossibilityofT1DM
inclusion, or the potential inclusion of patients treated with
oral antidiabetic medications for reasons other than T2DM.
These results are summarized in Figure 3 and in eTable 3 and
eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Studies that potentially included T1DM cases yielded sig-
nificantlyhigher“T2DM”incidenceratesperpatient-yearthan
those that did not (P = .03). Conversely, the unadjusted, cu-
mulative risk and all group comparisons were unaffected by
this T2DM definition. Study quality, measured with the NOS,
was not associated with the unadjusted, cumulative T2DM risk
(P = .19) or exposure-adjusted T2DM incidence rate (P = .67)
(eTable 1 in the Supplement).

Moderation by Age: Samples With Patients 18 Years or Younger Only
The results for the unadjusted, cumulative risk, for the inci-
dence, and for the group differences were replicated when ex-
cluding studies with patients older than 18 years. The mean
ageofthestudysamplesdidnotsignificantlymoderatetheun-
adjusted, cumulative T2DM risk (P = .31) or T2DM incidence
(P = .43).
Mediation by Follow-up Time
Increased T2DM risk with antipsychotic treatment was medi-
ated by longer follow-up duration (P < .001). Conversely, study
follow-up duration did not mediate T2DM incidence (P = .47),
which was already adjusted for patient-years.
Multivariable Model
In the multivariable meta-regression model pooling all SGAs
together, only longer follow-up duration emerged as a signifi-
cant mediating variable of cumulative T2DM risk in antipsy-
chotic-exposed youth (r2 = 0.70, P < .001) (eTable 5 in the
Supplement). When entering individual SGAs separately,
greater T2DM risk was associated with longer follow-up du-
ration (P < .001), olanzapine prescription (P < .001), and male
sex (P = .002) (10 studies, r2 = 1.00, P < .001) (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
Pooling SGAs together, greater T2DM incidence was asso-
ciated with SGA prescription (P ≤ .05), whereas autism spec-
trum disorder diagnosis (P = .048) was associated with lower
T2DM incidence (13 studies, r2 = 0.21, P = .04) (eTable 7 in
the Supplement). When entering individual SGAs separately
to the model, no significant moderators emerged for T2DM
incidence.
Correlates of T2DM Incidence Identified
in Published Studies
Demographics
The findings regarding the influence of sex and age on T2DM
risk during antipsychotic treatment have been incon-
sistent.35,48,50-52 These results are summarized in eTable 8 in
the Supplement.
Diagnosis
One study35 showed a significantly elevated risk for patients
with BPD and either conduct disorder or ADHD. Other diag-
noses associated with T2DM were autism, DBD, and mood
disorders,34 while one study51 did not find any significant ef-
fects of psychiatric diagnoses on the risk of or time until de-
veloping T2DM using multivariable analyses (eTable 8 in the
Supplement).

Antipsychotic Medication, Dosage, and Exposure Time
One study47 found an elevated T2DM risk when comparing
SGAs vs FGAs (hazard ratio, 3.39, 95% CI, 0.83-13.90), while
another study35 found an elevated risk when restricting the co-
hort to SGA users. Conversely, 2 single cohorts (each receiv-
ing either FGAs or SGAs) had similar T2DM risk.52

In 2 studies,35,54 ziprasidone hydrochloride or aripip-
razole was associated with higher T2DM risk compared with
other SGAs (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Lower T2DM risk was
reported for aripiprazole in another study.48 Furthermore,
clozapine51 and antipsychotic polypharmacy48 were associ-
ated with significantly increased T2DM risk.
The T2DM risk did not vary significantly by baseline an-
tipsychotic dosage but increased with cumulative dose of all
antipsychotics, especially with risperidone and in children 6
to 17 years old.35 No significant dosage-associated risk was
found in another study51 using defined daily dose instead of
the actual mean daily dose. Whereas one study35 reported an
increased T2DM risk within the first year of antipsychotic ex-
posure (which was sustained for ≥1 year even after antipsy-
chotictreatmentdiscontinuation),anotherstudy54didnotfind
a significant effect of antipsychotic exposure time on T2DM
risk.
Coprescribed Medication
EffectsofcoprescribedmedicationsonT2DMriskwerereported
inonly2studies.35,54Onestudy54indicatedanincreasedT2DM
risk with adjunctive antidepressant use, whereas the results
were inconsistent regarding adjunctive stimulant treatment in
both studies.
Glucose Level Screening
One study35 demonstrated an increased T2DM risk related to
glucose level screening. This result was found both for anti-
psychotic users who did or did not have a glucose level screen-
ing at baseline or during the follow-up period.
Discussion
This meta-analysis of T2DM risk in antipsychotic-exposed
youthindicatesthattheunadjusted,cumulativeT2DMriskand
incidence of T2DM, respectively, were 2.6-fold and 3.0-fold
higher compared with healthy controls and 2.1-fold and 1.8-
fold higher compared with psychiatric controls. The attenu-
ated difference compared with psychiatrically ill youth
reflects that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and other pharma-
cologicaltreatmentsassociatedwithpsychiatricdisorderslikely
also contribute to the risk of weight gain or obesity, metabolic
abnormalities, and T2DM. For example, BPD and depression,
as well as mood stabilizers and antidepressants, have been
associated with metabolic syndrome and T2DM.33,56-59 Ac-
cordingly, T2DM risk was also 1.5-fold and 2.0-fold higher in
psychiatrically ill youth not exposed to antipsychotics com-
pared with healthy controls.
Although the T2DM risk was significantly higher in anti-
psychotic-exposed youth than in psychiatric controls and
healthy controls, the number of actual excess cases was low,
at least during the mean (SD) follow-up of 1.7 (2.3) years (range,
0.38-8.81 years). Nevertheless, the clinical importance of these
findingsisunderscoredbystudies60,61showingincreasedmor-
bidityandmortalityassociatedwithanearlierT2DMonset.The
relevanceofourfindingsisfurtherunderscoredbythefactthat
T2DM is only the most severe outcome of an interplay be-
tween antipsychotic exposure and genetic and lifestyle fac-
tors that lead to obesity and insulin resistance, which in and
of themselves have serious health risks, especially when start-
ing early in life.16,18-22,60,61 Our meta-analysis identified 3.1 and
3.6 excess T2DM cases per 1000 psychiatric controls and
healthy controls, respectively, as well as an excess of 1.4 and
2.4 T2DM cases per 1000 patient-years of antipsychotic expo-
sure or follow-up compared with psychiatric controls and
healthy controls, respectively. This increased risk must be
balanced carefully against the potential benefits of
antipsychotics4-6,9,15,17,26 and underscores the need for pre-
scriberstoexhaustlower-risktreatmentalternativesbeforeini-
tiating antipsychotic treatment and to routinely monitor youth
for weight gain and metabolic abnormalities.
Caution should be especially high in patients with non-
psychotic disorders, in whom clinicians should aim for the
shortest necessary treatment duration. This caveat is under-
scored by the fact that follow-up and thereby treatment du-
ration increased T2DM risk.
In multivariable analyses, T2DM risk was significantly
greaterinmaleindividualsthaninfemaleindividuals,inyouth
treated with olanzapine, and in those with longer follow-up
duration. The T2DM incidence was significantly greater in
youth treated with SGAs but was lower in youth with autism
spectrum disorder. The greater risk for T2DM in male indi-
viduals is consistent with data in adults.16,60 Our results con-
firm that T2DM risk with SGAs is not homogeneous and that
olanzapinetreatmentisamajormodifiableriskfactor.Whether
the lower risk in youth with autism spectrum disorder is driven
by other diagnostic groups that are associated with a higher
T2DM risk (eg, mood or psychosis spectrum disorders) or by
comedicationsusedforthesepatients31,33,34,56,59,62requiresfur-
ther clarification. Study quality assessed with the NOS did not
significantly affect the findings. Although not all aspects of
study quality are covered by the criteria in the NOS, many of
those relevant to the study of T2DM were captured by the ad-
ditional subgroup and sensitivity analyses, which confirmed
the overall results.
In patient-level analyses of T2DM risk factors conducted
intheoriginalstudies,youthinmidtolateadolescenceseemed
to have a greater T2DM risk, likely due to longer antipsy-
choticexposureorpuberty-relatedinsulinresistance.63There-
sults regarding sex-related risk remained inconclusive. Youth
with mood disorder diagnoses seemed to have a higher risk of
antipsychotic-related T2DM than youth with other diagnoses
(eg, autism spectrum disorder), which is consistent with the
findings of our meta-regression analysis. Other risk factors in-
cluded antidepressant cotreatment, consistent with elevated
T2DM risk compared with healthy controls in antidepressant-
treated youth,34 as well as cumulative antipsychotic duration
and dose and antipsychotic cotreatment, likely related to
greatermedicationexposureandillnessseverity.Finally,inone
study,54 aripiprazole was associated with a significantly higher
T2DM risk than risperidone, with an additional, trend-level

likelihood that higher-risk patients or those with concerning
cardiometabolicadverseeffectsduetootherantipsychoticsare
being started on or switched to these 2 lower-risk antipsychot-
ics. This hypothesis is supported by a large Danish registry
study51of7139antipsychotic-naivepatientsfollowedupfor6.6
years in which aripiprazole was associated with a reduced
T2DM risk, while olanzapine (as in our meta-regression analy-
sis and in most prospective studies16,18,19,21) and low-potency
FGAs and clozapine were associated with an elevated T2DM
risk.31 Because all but one study23 (which focused on olanza-
pine treatment only) reported on naturalistic settings with a
range of antipsyhotics, a detailed comparison of different an-
tipsychotics was not possible in this meta-analysis.
The results of this meta-analysis need to be interpreted
withinseverallimitations.First,althoughwewereabletometa-
analyze 13 studies with 185 105 antipsychotic-exposed youth,
themainlimitationsarefewstudieswithdataonT2DMriskand
the short and heterogeneous mean follow-up duration of 1.7
years (range, 0.38-8.81 years). Second, identified studies were
heterogeneousregardingdesign,patientascertainment,sample
characteristics, assessments, outcomes, and matching proce-
dures compared with the control groups, likely contributing to
heterogeneity of the results. For example, retrospective data-
basestudiesandprospective,observational,oropen-labelstud-
ies were combined. While this choice increased heterogeneity,
both study types have their strengths and weaknesses, which
arecomplementary,withhighergeneralizabilityofthesamples
in the database studies but greater granularity of the assess-
ments and precision T2DM definitions in the prospective stud-
ies. However, although the findings were heterogeneous,
subgroup and sensitivity analyses replicated the overall
results, indicating that the effect size estimates varied within
the significantly greater T2DM risk range and not between sig-
nificant and nonsignificant results. Moreover, the results were
unaffected by study quality, which generally was high. Third,
there are several restrictions because of the naturalistic setting
in all but one study23 (which focused on olanzapine treatment
only),aswellasthefactthatdataofallbut3studies23,46,49were
collectedretrospectively.Consequently,theresultsmighthave
been affected by the following factors: (1) part of the follow-up
period could have occurred after stopping antipsychotic treat-
ments, resulting in a conservative T2DM risk estimate associ-
ated with antipsychotic use in youth; (2) metabolically higher-
risk youth might be channeled to lower-risk medication
(channeling bias); (3) generally, low glucose level testing rates
in youth receiving antipsychotics64,65 may have resulted in un-
detected T2DM cases (surveillance bias),66 adding to the con-
servativebiasoftheresultsandrequiringadditionalstudieswith
adequate glucose level monitoring; and (4) cases reported as
T2DM might have been incorrectly classified (eg, by the count-
ing of T1DM or other illnesses for which antidiabetic medica-
tion was prescribed [misclassification bias]), leading to poten-
tially inflated outcomes. However, these biases appear to have
been small because they did not significantly affect the overall
results when conducting subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Moreover,thedifferentT2DMdefinitionsthatcanleadtoanin-
flated rate or to a deflated rate affected the comparison groups
equally. Fourth, although schizophrenia spectrum disorders
have been associated with T2DM development,62,67,68 too few
antipsychotic-exposed youth had such disorders to enable
meaningful subgroup or meta-regression analyses. Fifth, be-
cause long-term follow-up studies of antipsychotic-exposed
youth for T2DM (which is a distal and low-rate adverse effect)
are difficult to conduct,69 all but 2 studies were observa-
tional, database studies, restricting the available data. For ex-
ample, much potentially relevant data on T2DM-related vari-
ablesweremissinginthedatabases(eg,familyhistoryofT2DM,
body mass index, smoking status, diet and exercise behav-
iors, and illness severity) and were therefore not available for
confounding adjustment. Because T2DM is a long-term ad-
verse effect that is related to treatment, illness, behavioral, ge-
netic, and environmental factors, more prospective, long-
termobservationalstudiesofyouthtreatedwithantipsychotics
are needed that assess relevant risk factors for T2DM beyond
antipsychotic treatment.
Conclusions
The results of this meta-analysis indicate an association be-
tween antipsychotic treatment and increased risk for the de-
velopment of T2DM in youth. These risks should be consid-
ered in the clinical risk-benefit evaluation when initiating or
continuing antipsychotic treatment in this age group. Al-
though the absolute incidence rates are small (at least during
a mean follow-up period of 1.7 years), antipsychotics should
only be used when lower-risk interventions have failed, and
differential tolerability profiles should influence the antipsy-
chotic choice, including avoidance of olanzapine.18,19,21,70 An-
tipsychotics should be used judiciously and for the shortest
necessary duration. Furthermore, routine and proactive moni-
toring of cardiovascular risk factors should be enforced when
prescribing antipsychotics to youth. Patients and their care-
givers also need to be informed about possible adverse ef-
fects and supported in alleviating cardiometabolic risk via
healthy nutrition and physical activities.18,27,71-74
