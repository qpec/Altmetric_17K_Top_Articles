Abstract
OBJECTIVES: The COMMENCE trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel bioprosthetic tissue for surgical aor-
tic valve replacement (AVR).
METHODS: Patients underwent clinically indicated surgical AVR with the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNTTM Magna EaseTM aortic valve
with RESILIATM tissue (Model 11000A) in a prospective, multinational, multicentre (n = 27), single-arm, FDA Investigational Device
Exemption trial. Events were adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee; echocardiograms were analysed by an independ-
ent Core Laboratory.
RESULTS: Between January 2013 and February 2016, 689 patients received the study valve. Mean age was 67.0 ± 11.6 years; 71.8% were
male; 26.3% were New York Heart Association Class III/IV. Mean STS PROM was 2.0 ± 1.8 (0.3–17.5). Isolated AVR was performed in 59.1%
of patients; others had additional concomitant procedures, usually CABG. Thirty-day outcomes for all patients included all-cause mortality
1.2%, thromboembolism 2.2%, bleeding 0.9%, major paravalvular leak 0.1% and permanent pacemaker implantation 4.7%. Median inten-
sive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2 (range: 0.2–66) and 7 days (3.0–121.0), respectively. At 2 years, New York Heart
Association class improved in 65.7%, effective orifice area was 1.6 ± 0.5 cm2; mean gradient was 10.1 ± 4.3 mmHg; and paravalvular leak
was none/trivial in 94.5%, mild in 4.9%, moderate in 0.5% and severe in 0.0%. One-year actuarial freedom from all-cause mortality for iso-
lated AVR and for all patients was 98.2% and 97.6%, respectively. Two-year actuarial freedom from mortality in these groups was 95.3%
and 94.3%, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of aortic valve disease continues to increase as
the global population ages and life expectancy continues to rise
[1, 2]. Bioprosthetic aortic valve tissue made from bovine pericar-
dium is increasingly implanted, due its demonstrated longevity
and reliable haemodynamic performance. Additionally, aortic
valve
replacement
(AVR)
with
bioprosthetic
tissue
avoids
the long-term anticoagulation necessary with mechanical valves
[3–5]. The durability of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNTTM
bovine pericardial bioprosthesis platform has been demonstrated
by a low rate of valve-related adverse events including structural
valve deterioration (SVD) with an expected valve durability of up
to 20 years [6]. In patients under 60 years of age, the risk of SVD
and reoperation due to tissue failure as a result of calcification is
higher, emphasizing the need for a more durable valve in
younger patients with longer life expectancy [7–9].
Calcification plays a major role in SVD and eventual failure of
bioprosthetic heart valve tissue. Tissue calcification is understood
to be primarily due to chemical processes between glutaralde-
hyde and free aldehydes, remnants of the tissue treatment pro-
cess and their interaction with free calcium in the circulating
blood. Other factors contributing to SVD are patient comorbid-
ities such as hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus and renal
disease [10, 11].
The study valve investigated here builds upon the design of
the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNTTM Magna EaseTM valve and
incorporates RESILIATM tissue, a bovine pericardial tissue that in-
corporates a novel preservation technology, which permanently
blocks residual aldehyde groups known to bind to calcium, and
preserves tissue with glycerol, allowing dry storage of the valve
prior to surgical implantation. This avoids re-exposure to gluta-
raldehyde during storage and obviates the need to rinse the valve
during surgical preparation. The performance of this tissue has
been evaluated in an intramuscular rabbit study and demon-
strated that RESILIATM significantly reduced both free aldehyde
content and tissue calcification [12]. In juvenile sheep, mitral bio-
prosthetic valves with RESILIATM tissue demonstrated a statistic-
ally significant reduction in leaflet calcification (P = 0.002) and
significant
improvement
in
haemodynamic
performance
(P = 0.03) over commercially available pericardial tissue valves
(Carpentier-Edwards
PERIMOUNT
PLUSTM
Pericardial
Mitral
Bioprosthesis, Model 6900P) [13]. Early clinical experience with
this novel tissue is encouraging [14]. We here report the 2-year
results of the COMMENCE trial, evaluating the safety and per-
formance of RESILIATM tissue in a prospective, non-randomized,
multicentre study of patients undergoing AVR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The COMMENCE Trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-
centre clinical evaluation of the Edwards Pericardial Aortic
Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A, which features a new pericardial tis-
sue (RESILIATM) in subjects who require surgical replacement of
their native or prosthetic aortic valve. All study subjects were en-
rolled at 27 clinical sites in the USA and Poland (Supplementary
Material, Table S1) and followed for 1 year to assess primary safety
and effectiveness and annually thereafter for a minimum of 5 years
after the index operation. The present data set (locked 13 April
2016) includes 857 patient-years of total follow-up, including
800.9 patient-years of late (>30 days) follow-up, with mean follow-
up of 1.2 years; 515 patients have completed 1 year follow-up; 240
have completed 2 year follow-up. COMMENCE was conducted
using Good Clinical Practices in accordance with 21 CFR Part 812
(Investigational Device Exemption), 21 CFR Part 50 (Protection of
Human Subjects), CFR Part 54 (Financial Disclosure by Clinical
Investigators) and 21 CFR Part 56 (Institutional Review Boards),
and the Health and Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). The clinical protocol, consent form and protocol amend-
ments were reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or
Ethics Committee at each investigational site and registered with
Clinical Trials.gov (NCT01757665).
Study device
The study valve is a trileaflet bioprosthesis comprised of bovine
pericardium mounted on a flexible frame. The physical structure
and design of the Model 11000 A is identical to the Carpentier-
Edwards PERIMOUNTTM Magna EaseTM platform. RESILIATM tis-
sue is a bovine pericardial tissue that incorporates a novel pres-
ervation technology. The technology includes a proprietary
stable-capping anti-calcification process, which permanently
blocks residual aldehyde groups that are known to bind with
calcium. The technology also incorporates tissue preservation
with glycerol, which replaces the traditional storage in liquid-
based solutions such as glutaraldehyde. The valve is sterilized
using
ethylene
oxide
and
requires
no
rinsing
prior
to
implantation.
Population and procedure
The population of patients undergoing surgery were patients
with symptomatic aortic valve disease, operated upon by stand-
ard operative techniques (Table 1) [15]. Patients were offered en-
rollment into the COMMENCE trial by surgeons at individual
investigational sites based upon an indication for surgical aortic
valve replacement, an appropriate risk profile and surgical prefer-
ence for a bioprosthesis. Consented patients were considered en-
rolled in the clinical trial after the surgeon visually inspected the
aortic root, sized the aortic valve annulus and determined that
the trial valve could be implanted. Patients requiring concomi-
tant coronary artery bypass grafting, or replacement of the as-
cending aorta without circulatory arrest, were included. Excluded
patients were those with a history of prior valve operation involv-
ing a prosthetic valve or ring that would remain in situ; concomi-
tant valve repair or replacement of the mitral, tricuspid, or
pulmonary valves; and concomitant operations involving struc-
tures outside of the heart. The operative incision and technique

 of AVR were left to the discretion of the surgeon investigator and
included a minimally invasive ‘J’ or ‘T’ incision in the upper ster-
num or right mini-thoracotomy [16, 17].
Valve recipients were maintained on antiplatelet therapy (ex-
cept when contraindicated) during the initial healing stage
after
implant,
in
accordance
with
the
ACC/AHA
2006
Guidelines for the Management of Subjects with Valvular Heart
Disease [18, 19]. However, the final determination of antiplate-
let and/or anticoagulation treatment was at the discretion of
the surgeon.
Safety and effectiveness end-points
The primary safety end-point for the trial is the rate of implanted
subjects that experience structural deterioration (SVD) of the trial
valve. Secondary safety end-points included all-cause mortality,
valve-related mortality, reoperation, thromboembolism (stroke,
transient ischaemic attack or systemic embolism), valve throm-
bosis, all paravalvular leaks (PVLs), major PVL, endocarditis and
new permanent pacemaker implantation within the first year of
follow-up. Perioperative bleeding was defined as any intra- or
post-procedural bleeding related to the implant procedure up to
3 days post-implant, which led to patient death, re-exploration
or repair, prolonged hospitalization or transfusion of 3 or more
units of packed red blood cells. Safety outcomes were measured
using standardized end-points described in the Guidelines for
Reporting M&M after Cardiac Valve Interventions and FDA report-
ing requirements [19]. All safety end-points were adjudicated by
an independent Clinical Events Committee based on patient-
level source documents obtained from the investigational sites.
The primary effectiveness end-points in the study were im-
provement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class and valve haemodynamic performance (effective orifice
area, mean pressure gradient and PVL) at 1 year. Haemodynamic
performance
data
were
evaluated
by
an
independent
Echocardiographic
Core
Laboratory
(BioTelemetry
Research,
South San Francisco, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are summarized using item counts and per-
centages. Continuous variables are summarized using the mean,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Safety outcomes
were summarized for early (within 30 days of valve implant) and
late (beyond 30 days) events. Early events are expressed as a per-
centage of the number of patients experiencing an event divided
by the total number of patients. Late events are expressed as a line-
arized rate, which is calculated as the number of late events divided
by the total number of late patient-years. Late patient-years are
computed starting from postoperative Day 31 until the last follow-
up visit (or contact) or adverse event. Additionally, Kaplan–Meier
estimates are provided based on all primary and secondary safety
outcomes including both early and late outcomes. Statistical ana-
lysis is undertaken by trained biostatisticians using SAS Statistical
software package version 7.0. Throughout the manuscript, N is the
number of patients with available data for the given parameter.
RESULTS
Demographics and baseline characteristics
The COMMENCE Trial enrolled 694 patients with 689 receiving
implantation of the study device (Table 1). Results are provided for
the ‘as-treated’ population (N = 689). Mean age 67.0 ± 11.6 years
(range: 20.0–90.0, N = 689); 11.5% were >
_80years, while 20.9%
were <60 years; 71.8% were male (495 of 689). Distribution of
baseline NYHA functional class was as follows: Class I, 24.1% (166
of 689); Class II, 49.6% (342 of 689); Class III, 24.4% (168 of 689);
and Class IV, 1.9% (13 of 689). Of note, 43.7% of patients (301 of

artery disease (55.7%, 384 of 689) and cardiac rhythm abnormal-
ities (48.2%, 332 of 689). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons
Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score was 2.0± 1.8%
(range: 0.3–17.5) and the mean Logistic EuroSCORE II was 2.5 ± 2.8
(0.5–24.6). The aetiology of aortic valve disease included degenera-
tive (80.3%), congenital (30.1%) and rheumatic (3.6%) pathology.
Valvular dysfunction requiring AVR was stenosis (50.9%), stenosis
with aortic insufficiency (38.8%), pure insufficiency (7.0%) and
prosthetic valve dysfunction (2.5%) (Table 3).
Operative data
In patients treated with the study valve, isolated AVR was per-
formed in 59.1% of patients (407 of 689) and AVR + CABG in 24.4%
(168 of 689). Full sternotomy was employed in 82.4% of cases,
upper mini-sternotomy in 15.4% of cases and right anterior thora-
cotomy in 2.2% of cases. The complete distribution of concomitant
operations performed is listed in Table 4. The distribution of pros-
thetic valve sizes (19 mm to 29 mm) is shown in Table 5.
For isolated AVR, the mean aortic cross-clamp time and car-
diopulmonary
bypass
time
for
full
sternotomy
were
67.6 ± 22.4 min and 93.0 ± 32.3 min, respectively; for upper mini-
sternotomy, 69.7.5 ± 23.5 min and 96.4 ± 33.7 min, respectively.
Clinical events
Early clinical outcomes and actuarial event-free rates for all study
valve patients are listed in Table 6 and graphically displayed in
Fig. 1. Early (30-day operative) mortality was observed in 1.2% (8
of 689), 0.4% (3 of 689) of which were adjudicated as valve
related. Causes of death included cardiogenic shock (n = 2), car-
diac arrest (n = 2), respiratory failure (n = 1), stroke (n = 1), pul-
monary embolism (n = 1) and sudden unexplained death (n = 1).
One patient required reoperation (0.1%). Fifteen patients (2.2%)
experienced thromboembolic events, including stroke (n = 11,
1.6%) and 4 transient ischaemic attacks (n = 4, 0.6%). Six patients
experienced perioperative bleeding (0.9%). A new permanent
pacemaker was implanted in 4.7% of patients (n = 31). The mean
intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay were 3.0 ± 4.1
days (median: 2) and 7.7 ± 6.2 days (median: 7), respectively.
The present data set includes 857 patient-years of follow-up,
corresponding to a mean follow-up of 1.2 ± 0.7 years (range: 0–
3.1). Eighteen deaths were reported beyond 30 days of the index
operation (2.2%/patient-year), 6 of which were adjudicated as
related to the study valve (0.6%/patient-year). Actuarial freedom
from all-cause death at 1 year for all patients and for isolated
AVR only was 97.6% and 98.2%, respectively; freedom from
thromboembolism was 96.5% and 97.2%; and, freedom from
major paravalvular leak was 99.7% and 99.8%. Actuarial freedom
from all-cause death at 2 years for all patients and for isolated
AVR patients was 94.3% and 95.3%; freedom from thrombo-
embolism was 94.5% and 96.5%; and, freedom from major para-
valvular leak was 99.7% and 99.8%.

 Five cases of late endocarditis were observed (0.6%/patient-
year). Two were treated with intravenous antibiotics and re-
covered with complete resolution of echocardiographic findings.
In 3 other patients, the valve was explanted, patient treated with
antibiotics, and patients recovered without sequelae. At 2 years,
actuarial freedom from endocarditis was 98.9%. No cases of
structural valve deterioration, non-structural valve dysfunction,
valve thrombosis or hemolysis were reported.
Haemodynamic performance by valve size over time is shown
in Table 7. The mean transvalvular pressure gradient at 2 years
was 10.1 ± 4.3 mmHg and the mean effective orifice area was
1.6 ± 0.5 cm2. These values were maintained virtually unchanged
through 2 years. None or trivial (+1) PVL was reported in 94.5%
of patients at 2 years, 4.9% of patients had mild (2+) PVL, 1 pa-
tient had moderate PVL (+3). There were no patients presenting
with severe PVL (+4). At 2 years, 65.7% of patients showed im-
provement in NYHA class, 31.0% of patients were unchanged
and 3.3% of patients worsened. Overall, at 1 year, 80.7% of pa-
tients were in NYHA functional Class I (411 of 509); 17.3% in
Class II (88 of 509); 1.6% in Class III (8 of 509); and, 0.4% in Class
IV (2 of 509). At 2 years, 72.9% of patients were in NYHA func-
tional Class I (175/240); 24.2% in Class II (58 of 240); 2.5% in Class
III (6 of 240); and 0.4% in Class IV (1 of 240).
DISCUSSION
The COMMENCE Trial is an FDA investigational device exemp-
tion study evaluating the early safety and effectiveness of a novel
bovine pericardial bioprosthetic tissue, RESILIATM, incorporated
into the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNTTM Magna EaseTM aor-
tic bioprosthetic valve platform. The study valve is identical to
the standard Magna Ease valve in every way, except for the add-
ition of the new RESILIATM tissue and its novel integrity preserva-
tion technology.
In contrast to mechanical valves, bioprosthetic tissue valves
offer the advantage of not requiring lifelong anticoagulation, with
its associated risk of bleeding. However, the risks of prosthetic
valve deterioration and subsequent reoperation are higher in pa-
tients with bioprosthetic valves.
Degenerative calcification is the most common cause of bio-
prosthetic aortic valve stenosis and SVD [20]. Younger patients
have an increased risk of SVD compared with older patients
(>65 years old) [7, 21]. Tissue modification strategies aimed at
reducing calcium accumulation in bioprosthetic aortic valves in-
clude the use of surfactants or ethanol to remove the majority of
acidic phospholipids which are sites of mineralization and cal-
cium deposition [22, 23]. Amino-oleic acid and ethanol-based
methods are currently available approaches aimed at reducing
aldehyde content and tissue reactivity in bioprosthetic tissue [12,
24, 25]. RESILIATM tissue incorporates a proprietary
integrity
preservation
technology,
which
supplements
the
existing
ThermaFixTM tissue process by integrating an additional stable-
capping process that covalently binds in a permanent manner to
aldehyde residuals. This is followed by glycerolization to preserve
the tissue in dry storage. RESILIATM tissue is designed to enhance
long-term valve durability, allowing the valve to be stored with-
out liquid (glutaraldehyde); therefore, the valve rinsing step dur-
ing implantation is no longer necessary. Experimental evidence
indicates that the novel integrity preservation technology applied

 during the preparation of bioprosthetic tissue reduces the accu-
mulation of calcium in pericardial tissue [13]. The use of biopros-
thetic aortic valves in patients <
_65 years is supported by
numerous studies [7, 9, 26]. For patients reaching the 1- and 2-
year follow-up points in the COMMENCE Trial, no SVD was
observed in any patient.
With surgical AVR, SVD, valve thrombosis, non-structural valve
dysfunction and haemolysis are rare events during the first year
of follow-up. Moreover, the long-term durability for biopros-
thetic valves is well characterized. Recently, Johnston et al. re-
ported
12 569
patients
who
underwent
AVR
using
the
Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNTTM valve at the Cleveland Clinic
over a 271=
2-year period [27]. In patients aged between 60 years
and 80 years, the Kaplan–Meier estimates for SVD at 10 and
20 years were 1.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Thus, while the ab-
sence of SVD in the first 800 patient-years of follow-up in the
COMMENCE trial is reassuring, it is consistent with early out-
comes achieved with the predicate PERIMOUNTTM and Magna
EaseTM valves.
The surgical technique used for the AVR procedure in the
COMMENCE trial was at the discretion of each surgeon’s routine
surgical practice. Thus, early and 2-year results from this trial,
which enrolled 694 patients across 27 cardiac surgical sites, re-
flect contemporary surgical AVR outcomes. The mean STS pre-
dicted risk of mortality (2.0 ± 1.8%) and logistic EuroSCORE II
(2.5 ± 2.8%) were consistent with low operative risk. Thirty-day
outcomes were excellent and included an all-cause mortality rate
of 1.0% (4 of 396) among isolated AVR patients and 1.2% (8 of
689) among all patients. These results compare favourably with
previous studies of bioprosthetic tissue aortic valves reporting
early mortality ranging from 2.8 to 7.2% [6, 28–30]. The 30-day
incidence of stroke and pacemaker implantation was 1.0% and
4.1%, respectively. By comparison, in a meta-analysis of 176 stud-
ies of AVR, Biancari et al. reported operative mortality of 4.3%,
stroke
2.1%
and
pacemaker
implantation
5.9%.
Moreover,
haemodynamic performance, evaluated by an independent Core
Laboratory, reported favourable performance of the Magna
EaseTM valve manufactured with RESILIATM tissue. Mean effective
orifice area was 1.6 ± 0.5 cm2; mean pressure gradient was
10.1 ± 4.3 mmHg; and PVL was: none/trivial in 97.0% of patients.
Importantly, the incidence of endocarditis was low and well
within expected norms. These results may be taken as a contem-
porary benchmark against which outcomes with transcatheter
aortic valve implantation and rapid deployment aortic valve re-
placement can be measured.
Limitations
The COMMENCE trial was a single-arm study without an active
comparator group. Thus, it is susceptible to selection and chan-
nelling biases. During the enrollment phase of the study, consid-
erable emphasis was placed on procedural training. Nonetheless,
the possibility of performance bias cannot be excluded com-
pletely. The clinical end-points were objectively defined a priori,
and the outcomes were independently determined by a Clinical
Events Committee and an Echocardiographic Core Laboratory.
Thus, potential detection and measurement biases were miti-
gated but not completely eliminated. The current report is lim-
ited to primary safety and effectiveness at 2 years, with 800.9
patient-years late follow-up. Hence, additional follow-up is
required to establish long-term safety and effectiveness. The
COMMENCE trial will follow these patients through 5 postopera-
tive years.
CONCLUSIONS
These data from the COMMENCE FDA investigational device ex-
emption trial indicate acceptable early safety and effectiveness of
surgical AVR with the novel RESILIATM bovine pericardial tissue
in a predominantly low-risk population. This series of 689 pa-
tients having surgical AVR in 27 centres can also serve as a con-
temporary benchmark for alternative aortic valve therapies.
