Summary
Background Everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been used for various benign 
tumours associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. We assessed the effi
  cacy and safety of two trough exposure 
concentrations of everolimus, 3–7 ng/mL (low exposure) and 9–15 ng/mL (high exposure), compared with placebo as 
adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant focal-onset seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex.
Methods In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, eligible patients aged 2–65 years with 
tuberous sclerosis complex and treatment-resistant seizures (≥16 in an 8-week baseline phase) receiving one to three 
concomitant antiepileptic drugs were recruited from 99 centres across 25 countries. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1), via permuted-block randomisation (block size of six) implemented by Interactive Response 
Technology software, to receive placebo, low-exposure everolimus, or high-exposure everolimus. Randomisation was 
stratifi
 ed by age subgroup (<6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years, and ≥18 years). Patients, investigators, site 
personnel, and the sponsor’s study team were masked to treatment allocation. The starting dose of everolimus 
depended on age, body-surface area, and concomitant use of cytochrome 3A4/P-glycoprotein inducers. Dose 
adjustments were done to attain target trough ranges during a 6-week titration period, and as needed during a 12-week 
maintenance period of core phase. Patients or their caregivers recorded events in a seizure diary throughout the 
study. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in the frequency of seizures during the maintenance period, 
defi
 ned as response rate (the proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency) and median 
percentage reduction in seizure frequency, in all randomised patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01713946.
Findings Between July 3, 2013, and May 29, 2015, 366 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to placebo 
(n=119), low-exposure everolimus, (n=117), or high-exposure everolimus (n=130). The response rate was 15·1% with 
placebo (95% CI 9·2–22·8; 18 patients) compared with 28·2% for low-exposure everolimus (95% CI 20·3–37·3; 
33 patients; p=0·0077) and 40·0% for high-exposure everolimus (95% CI 31·5–49·0; 52 patients; p<0·0001). The 
median percentage reduction in seizure frequency was 14·9% (95% CI 0·1–21·7) with placebo versus 29·3% with 
low-exposure everolimus (95% CI 18·8–41·9; p=0·0028) and 39·6% with high-exposure everolimus (95% CI 35·0–48·7; 
p<0·0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 13 (11%) patients in the placebo group, 21 (18%) in the low-exposure 
group, and 31 (24%) in the high-exposure group. Serious adverse events were reported in three (3%) patients who 
received placebo, 16 (14%) who received low-exposure everolimus, and 18 (14%) who received high-exposure 
everolimus. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in two (2%) patients in the placebo group versus six (5%) 
in the low-exposure group and four (3%) in the high-exposure group.
Interpretation Adjunctive everolimus treatment signifi
 cantly reduced seizure frequency with a tolerable safety profi
 le 
compared with placebo in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and treatment-resistant seizures.

Introduction
Epilepsy is the most common neurological symptom of 
tuberous sclerosis complex, an autosomal dominant 
genetic disorder, and is reported in up to 85% of patients 
with the condition.1,2 Nearly two-thirds of patients with 
tuberous sclerosis complex present with seizures in the 
fi
 rst year of life, often as focal seizures or infantile 
spasms.1,2 Early onset of epilepsy and particularly 
untreated early-onset epilepsy is associated with an 
increased risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities, 
including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual 
disability.2 Seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex can be focal, multifocal, or generalised, and are 
typically diffi
  cult to control.3 More than 60% of patients 
are resistant to standard therapies such as antiepileptic 
drugs, epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, and vagal nerve

stimulation,1,2 as opposed to only 30–40% of patients with 
epilepsy without tuberous sclerosis complex.4
To date, tuberous sclerosis complex is treated 
symptomatically with antiepileptic drugs that are not 
specifi
 c for the underlying cause. Targeting of disease-
specifi
 c molecular signalling mechanisms that drive the 
development of seizures has been previously suggested 
in tuberous sclerosis complex or other epilepsy 
aetiologies,5 but not implemented. Antiepileptic drugs 
render neurons less excitable, typically by interacting 
with transmembrane ion channels. They can be 
particularly eff
 ective for some specifi
 c seizure types or 
epilepsy syndromes (eg, carbamazepine for localisation 
related epilepsy, vigabatrin for infantile spasms, and 
clonazepam for Angelman’s syndrome). However, 
antiepileptic drugs are not necessarily developed for or 
directed against a specifi
 c molecular pathomechanism.5
Aberrant mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signalling results in hamartomas, and neuropsychiatric 
disorders and epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex.2,3 Overactivation of mTOR leads to giant, 
dysplastic neurons, abnormal axonogenesis and dendrite 
formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, 
reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical 
laminar structure.6–11 Dysregulated mTOR activity due to 
mutations in upstream pathway genes, including 
STRADα, DEPDC5, and PI3K, has also been implicated 
in epileptogenesis and seizures associated with cortical 
malformations.12 At present, tuberous sclerosis complex 
is the best-characterised disease associated with mTOR 
pathway overactivation. Findings from preclinical 
studies8,11 have shown that treatment with mTOR 
inhibitors 
could 
increase 
survival, 
prevent 
the 
development of new-onset seizures, and ameliorate 
existing epilepsy. Case reports and open-label studies 
suggest benefi
 cial eff
 ects of everolimus in patients with 
epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.13–17 
Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that has been 
approved for the treatment of subependymal giant-cell 
astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma in patients with 
tuberous sclerosis complex.14,18 Another mTOR inhibitor, 
sirolimus, has been approved for the treatment of 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis 
in 
tuberous 
sclerosis 
complex.
We postulated that everolimus might improve seizures 
by targeting the specifi
 c molecular defect in patients with 
tuberous sclerosis complex and treatment-resistant focal 
epilepsy. Examining Everolimus in a Study of Tuberous 
Sclerosis Complex (EXIST-3) evaluated the effi
  cacy and 
safety of two dosing regimens of adjunctive everolimus

Research in context 
Evidence before this study
Limited evidence is available on the optimal treatment of epilepsy 
in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. We searched PubMed 
for English-language studies using the terms “tuberous sclerosis 
complex” or “tsc” and “epilepsy” or “seizure”, published up to 
June 23, 2016. Our search identifi
 ed exploratory clinical studies 
with small sample sizes and case reports demonstrating 
successful seizure control in some patients with various 
conventional antiepileptic drugs, but at least a third of patients 
are refractory to available medical and surgical therapies. 
Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes responsible for the 
overactivation of mammallian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are 
the genetic causes of tuberous sclerosis complex. Pharmacological 
inhibitors of mTOR have demonstrated effi
  cacy for the treatment 
of multiple features of tuberous sclerosis complex, including renal 
angiomyolipoma, subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, and 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Early human case reports showed 
benefi
 cial eff
 ects of mTOR inhibitors on seizures. Findings from 
a small prospective, single-group human clinical trial showed an 
improvement in seizure control in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex and refractory epilepsy. In two prospective 
human clinical trials, benefi
 t could not be demonstrated when 
seizure frequency was analysed as a secondary outcome measure. 
No large randomised clinical trials are available.
Added value of this study
This phase 3 multicentre study provides the benefi
 ts and risks 
of adding everolimus as adjunctive therapy to between one 
and three antiepileptic drugs in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex who have shown a high burden of 
treatment-resistant seizures (at least 16 in an 8-week period 
before randomisation). Additionally, this study provides the 
fi
 rst estimates of the optimal range of everolimus exposure 
suitable in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and 
seizures.
Implications of all the available evidence
By comparison with previous studies, which were either case 
series, retrospective cohort studies, prospective studies of 
small sample size, or prospective clinical trials with seizure 
outcome assessed as secondary measure, the fi
 ndings from 
EXIST-3 provide evidence that everolimus might be an 
eff
 ective treatment option as adjuvant therapy for children and 
adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. EXIST-3 extends the 
use of everolimus for seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex, in 
addition to the benefi
 t observed for other aspects of the 
disease (subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, renal 
angiomyolipoma, and facial angiofi
 broma). The time to 
effi
  cacy observed in the study suggests that everolimus, unlike 
conventional antiepileptic drugs, provides a unique 
mechanism of action through targeting of mTOR 
overactivation. This study’s fi
 ndings also demonstrate the 
short-term benefi
 t of everolimus when added to best available 
antiepileptic drug therapy.

compared with placebo in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex and treatment-resistant focal epilepsy.
Methods
Study design and participants
EXIST-3 is a three-arm, prospective, randomised, 
multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
study. It includes an initial 8-week baseline phase, 
followed by an 18-week core phase (reported here) and a 
48-week extension phase (which will be reported on 
completion). Patients aged 2–65 years with a confi
 rmed 
diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and treatment-
resistant epilepsy, with 16 or more seizures during the 
8-week baseline phase (with no continuous 21-day 
seizure-free period) and receiving between one and three 
antiepileptic drugs at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks 
before randomisation were included. Patients were 
excluded if they had subependymal giant-cell astro-
cytomas requiring immediate surgical intervention, 
seizures secondary to drug abuse, psychogenic non-
epileptic seizures, active infantile spasms, or an episode 
of status epilepticus within 1 year before study inclusion.
During the baseline phase, patients or their caregivers 
completed a seizure diary, recording seizure types and 
frequencies. In this population, many of whom have 
developmental delay, there are many seizure mimickers, 
including inattentive episodes, tics, and stereotyped 
behavioural events (known as stereotypies).19 To ensure 
reliable and consistent classifi
 cation of seizures across 
patients, seizures reported by patients and caregivers 
were entered into a seizure identifi
 cation form, separated 
into probable seizures (>80% likelihood of being 
an 
epileptic 
seizure) 
and 
questionable 
seizures 
(50–80% likelihood) by the investigators. Only probable 
seizures were counted towards the primary outcome. 
Focal seizures with retained awareness (simple partial 
seizures) were considered questionable if they had 
no motor or observable component, unless they 
had electroencephalogram (EEG) confi
 rmation. Stares 
without automatisms or other clear seizure-like 
manifestations were also counted as questionable. 
Independent reviewers (epileptologists from the Epilepsy 
Study 
Consortium, 
responsible 
for 
harmonising 
seizure classifi
 cations in the study) confi
 rmed the 
seizure classifi
 cation and designation as probable or 
questionable. Because multiple seizure types are present 
in tuberous sclerosis complex (a disease of focal 
pathology), all seizures were considered to be focal in 
onset unless an EEG confi
 rmed a generalised onset. 
Seizures were assigned to one of six categories: focal 
motor with retained awareness; focal non-motor with 
impaired awareness (including atypical absence or bland 
focal with altered awareness); focal motor with impaired 
awareness; other focal motor seizures (including those 
often classifi
 ed as of generalised origin—ie, focal to 
bilateral myoclonic, clonic, tonic, atonic); focal to bilateral 
tonic-clonic; and EEG-confi
 rmed generalised onset 
seizures (not included in seizure count for primary 
analysis but included in an exploratory analysis).
All patients (or their legal representatives) provided 
written informed consent before entering the baseline 
phase. The study was done in accordance with the 
principles of Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and all local regulations. The study protocol 
(appendix) and all amendments were reviewed and 
approved 
by 
independent 
ethics 
committees 
or 
institutional review boards for each centre.
Randomisation and masking
At the end of the baseline phase, eligible patients entered 
the core phase and were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via 
permuted-block randomisation (block size of six) 
implemented by Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
software, to receive placebo, everolimus titrated to a 
target trough concentration (Cmin) of 3–7 ng/mL (low-
exposure everolimus), or everlimus titrated to a target 
Cmin of 9–15 ng/mL (high-exposure everolimus), in 
addition to a stable regimen of one to three antiepileptic 
drugs. Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by age subgroup 
(<6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years, and ≥18 years). 
Dose adjustments to attain the target Cmin were done 
during the fi
 rst 6 weeks of the core phase, and as needed 
during the subsequent 12-week maintenance period. 
Patients, investigators, site personnel, and the 
sponsor’s study team were masked to treatment 
allocation, but allocation was not concealed from 
personnel in charge of drug supply, implementation of 
the randomisation list, and pharmacokinetic bioanalysis. 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) independent 
statistician and programmer were semi-blind to 
treatment allocation at the time of DSMB meetings. 
Study medication consisted of everolimus 2 mg pills and 
identical placebo pills, with both medication types being 
dispensed in yellow or blue blister packs. To maintain 
blinding, any patient in any treatment group could 
receive either or both colours of pills, and there were 
random dummy-dose titrations of placebo tablets in both 
the placebo group and the low-exposure group.
Procedures
We determined the starting dose of everolimus on the 
basis of patients’ age, body-surface area, and concomitant 
use of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)/P-glycoprotein 
(PgP) inducers. For patients younger than 10 years, the 
starting dose of everolimus was 6 mg/m² per day for 
those not receiving CYP3A4/PgP inducers and 9 mg/m² 
per day for those receiving CYP3A4/PgP inducers; for 
patients aged 10–18 years, the equivalent doses were 
5 mg/m² per day and 8 mg/m² per day, and for those 
older than 18 years were 3 mg/m² per day and 5 mg/m² 
per day, respectively. During the fi
 rst 6 weeks of the core 
phase, up to three dose adjustments were allowed to 
reach the targeted everolimus trough range. Further dose 
adjustments were possible as needed during the 12-week

maintenance period of the core phase. Dose adjustments 
were 2 mg for patients not receiving concomitant 
CYP3A4 inducers and 4 mg for patients receiving 
CYP3A4 inducers.  Dose increases and decreases were 
performed for patients with Cmin values lower and higher 
than the target range, respectively. 
Study treatment continued until the end of the core 
phase unless there was loss of seizure control, an episode 
of status epilepticus, interruption of one or more 
concomitant antiepileptic drugs for more than 7 days, 
intolerable toxic eff
 ects, or withdrawal of consent. 
Patients or their caregivers continued to record 
occurrence or absence of seizures on each day throughout 
the core phase. Patients were then off
 ered to continue in 
the extension phase, in which all patients received 
everolimus titrated to achieve a Cmin of 6–10 ng/mL 
(automated, IRT controlled) followed by non-automated, 
investigator-prescribed titrations to achieve a Cmin of 
3–15 ng/mL. 
The Vineland II Adaptative Behavior Scale was 
completed at baseline, at completion of the core phase, 
then every 6 months thereafter. This scale was completed 
by the physician while interviewing and observing the 
patient (survey interview form), but could be completed 
by the parent or their caregiver if the patient was unable 
to provide the information required (parent or caregiver 
form).
Outcomes
The primary effi
  cacy endpoint was change from baseline 
in seizure frequency for each of the two everolimus Cmin 
ranges compared with placebo during the 12-week 
maintenance period of the core phase, expressed as 
response rate (reduction in seizure frequency) and 
median percentage reduction in seizure frequency. 
Seizure frequency corresponds to the ratio between the 
number of seizures and the number of days on which 
seizure information was known within the same period 
of time (baseline or maintenance phase). 
The secondary endpoints included frequency of 
seizure-free days during the maintenance period, 
seizure-free rate (patients remaining seizure free 
during the entire maintenance period), the proportion 
of patients achieving at least a 25% reduction in seizure 
frequency from baseline, and exposure–response 
relationship analysis. A sensitivity analysis was done to 
assess the robustness of the primary and secondary 
effi
  cacy endpoints by considering the assessment 
period as the entire core phase (we used the 12-week 
maintenance period in the primary analysis to comply 
with a European Medicines Agency guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment of epileptic disorders).20 The study also 
assessed safety during the core phase. We assessed 
adverse events according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
version 4.03.21
Statistical analysis
EXIST-3 was planned as a phase 3 registration study in 
the absence of previous dose-fi
 nding studies in this 
indication of epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex. A literature review revealed that several recent 
studies of focal seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
were powered to achieve seizure reductions of 16–22% 
greater than placebo. In these studies, median reduction 
in seizure frequency in placebo groups ranged from 11% 
to 18%.22–25 In light of these studies, we chose a planned 
sample size of 345 patients (115 per group), to provide 
90% power to detect a diff
 erence in response rate from 
15% on placebo to 35% in each of the two everolimus 
groups, with each test at the 1·25% one-sided signfi
 cance 
level. At least 90% power was also expected for percentage 
reduction in seizure frequency, because response rate is 
less sensitive due to loss of information in dichotomising 
a continuous variable. Owing to a failure of the IRT 
system to titrate the everolimus dose during the fi
 rst 
5 months of the study, there was a concern about 
potential loss of power, particularly for the high-exposure 
everolimus group where most patients were expected to 
need at least one dose increase to reach the targeted 
trough range of 9–15 ng/mL. Without unblinding, we 
determined that a maximum of 18 patients in the high-
exposure everolimus might have missed dose titrations. 
Therefore, to mitigate against a potential loss of power, 
we increased the planned sample size in the high-
exposure everolimus group (in a blinded manner) by ten 
patients.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the 
baseline characteristics of the study population. The full 
analysis set was the primary effi
  cacy population, 
comprising all randomly assigned patients. We 
compared response rate between each everolimus group 
versus the placebo group using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel χ² tests stratifi
 ed by age subgroup. For 
percentage reduction in seizure frequency, we used a 
rank ANCOVA model, with baseline seizure frequency 
as a covariate, and stratifi
 ed by age subgroup. For each 
of the two primary variables (response rate and 
percentage 
reduction 
in 
seizure 
frequency), 
a 
Bonferroni-Holm procedure was used to ensure overall 
family-wise type I error rates of 2·5% (one sided), taking 
into account the comparison of each everolimus group 
with placebo; no multiplicity adjustment was made to 
take account of the two primary variables. The 
relationship between effi
  cacy parameters and exposure 
to study drug was assessed using regression models 
(with logit function for response rate and linear function 
for seizure frequency). Safety analysis was done with 
the safety set of all patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline 
safety assessment.
We did statistical analyses with SAS (version 9.2). 
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01713946.

Role of the funding source
The study was designed by academic investigators and 
representatives of the funder, Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation. Data were collected electronically using 
data management systems of a contract research 
organisation designated by the funder and were analysed 
by the funder’s statistical team. All authors had full 
access to the data for interpretation and analysis, were 
involved in development and approval of the report, and 
had the fi
 nal responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication. All authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the reported data, and attest that the 
study conformed to the protocol and statistical analysis 
plan.
Results
Between July 3, 2013, and May 29, 2015, 366 patients 
(190 men, 176 women) were enrolled from 99 centres in 
25 countries worldwide and randomly assigned to receive 
placebo (n=119), low-exposure everolimus (n=117), or 
high-exposure everolimus (n=130; fi
 gure 1). The median 
age was 10·1 years (range 2·2–56·3) with 104 patients 
(28%) younger than 6 years and 67 (18%) patients aged 
18 years or older (table 1). Of all patients enrolled, 178 
(49%) had previously tried and not responded to six or 
more previous antiepileptic drugs. Antiepileptic drugs 
that failed most frequently before screening were 
levetiracetam in 245 (67%) patients, vigabatrin in 
243 (66%) patients, and topiramate in 214 (58%) patients. 
At baseline, focal motor seizures with retained awareness 
were present in 71 patients (19%), focal non-motor 
seizures with impaired awareness in 165 (45%), focal 
motor seizures with impaired awareness in 95 (26%), 
other focal motor seizures in 149 (41%), focal to bilateral 
tonic-clonic seizures in 68 (19%), and EEG-confi
 rmed 
generalised onset seizures in six (2%; table 2). The 
median seizure frequency per 28 days at baseline 
excluding EEG-confi
 rmed generalised onset seizures 
was 42·0 (range 5·3–926·7) in the placebo group, 
34·5 (5·5–771·5) in the low-exposure group, and 
37·8 (1·0–873·5) in the high-exposure group.
346 (95%) patients completed the core phase. Five (4%) 
patients in the placebo group, seven (6%) in the low-
exposure group, and eight (6%) in the high-exposure 
everolimus group discontinued treatment during the core 
phase. The most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation was adverse events in all treatment 
groups (placebo, two [2%] patients; low-exposure 
everolimus, six [5%] patients; and high-exposure 
everolimus, four [3%] patients). The median dose received 
by patients in the everolimus low-exposure group

patients randomly assigned to the low-exposure group 
was 5·1 ng/mL (1·4–25·3) and in the high-exposure 
everolimus group was 8·3 ng/mL (0·8–22·0).
The median seizure frequency per week at baseline 
was 10·5 (range 1·3–231·7) in the placebo group, 
8·6 (1·4–192·9) in the low-exposure group, and 9·5 
(0·3–218·4) in the high-exposure group, and at the end 
of core phase was 8·5 (0–217·7), 6·8 (0–193·5), and 
4·9 (0–133·7), respectively. In the placebo group, 
18 of 119 patients had a 50% or greater reduction in 
seizure frequency during the maintenance period 
compared with baseline, equivalent to a response rate of 
15·1% (95% CI 9·2–22·8); the median percentage 
reduction in seizure frequency was 14·9% (95% CI 
0·1–21·7). By comparison, everolimus was associated 
with a signifi
 cantly greater response rate (33 of 
117 patients in the low-exposure group, response rate 
28·2% [95% CI 20·3–37·3], p=0·0077; and 52 of 
130 patients in the high-exposure group, response rate 
40·0% [31·5–49·0], p<0·0001) and a signifi
 cantly greater 
median percentage reduction in seizure frequency (in 
the low-exposure group, 29·3% [95% CI 18·8–41·9], 
p=0·0028; and in the high-exposure group, 39·6% 
[35·0–48·7], p<0·0001; fi
 gure 2). The odds of achieving a 
50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 
2·2-times higher (95% CI 1·2–4·2) for low-exposure 
everolimus than placebo and 3·9-times higher (2·1–7·3) 
for high-exposure everolimus than for placebo. Results of 
the sensitivity analysis (using the full core phase instead 
of the 12-week maintenance period) were consistent with 
the primary analysis; 13 patients had a 50% or greater 
reduction in seizure frequency (response rate 10·9% 
[95% CI 5·9–18·0]) for placebo compared with 29 patients 
(24·8% [17·3–33·6]) for low-exposure everolimus and 
42 patients (32·3% [24·4–41·1]) for high-exposure 
everolimus, and the median percentage reduction in 
seizure frequency was 10·7% (95% CI –1·6 to 17·6) for 
placebo compared with 18·4% (11·7–29·5) for low-
exposure everolimus and 34·9% (28·5–41·1) for high-
exposure everolimus.
A 25% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 
observed in 45 patients (37·8% [95% CI 29·1–47·2]) in the 
placebo group, 61 patients (52·1% [42·7–61·5]) in the low-
exposure everolimus group, and 91 patients (70·0% 
[61·3–77·7]) in the high-exposure everolimus group 
(fi
 gure 2). The seizure-free rate was 0·8% (95% CI 0–4·6; 
one patient) for the placebo group, 5·1% (1·9–10·8; 
six patients) for the low-exposure everolimus group, and 
3·8% (1·3–8·7; fi
 ve patients) for the high-exposure 
everolimus group. The median number of seizure-free 
days (per 28-day period) increased from baseline by 2·0 in 
the low-exposure group and 4·0 days in the high-exposure 
group, compared with 0·5 days in the placebo group. We 
noted seizure reduction with everolimus treatment among 
multiple seizure types (fi
 gure 2), and the seizure reduction 
fi
 ndings were essentially unchanged when generalised 
onset seizures confi
 rmed by EEG (reported in six patients) 
were included in the analysis (data not shown).
Logistic and linear regression models stratifi
 ed by age 
subgroup and adjusted by baseline seizure frequency 
supported exposure (expressed as time-normalised [TN] 
Cmin, denoting an estimated average of Cmin over the 
maintenance period) as a strong predictor of response rate 
and seizure frequency in the maintenance period of the 
core phase; a doubling of TN Cmin was associated with a 
statistically signifi
 cant 2·2-times increase (95% CI 1·3–3·5; 
p=0·0017) in the odds for a response and a statistically 
signifi
 cant 28·3% reduction (95% CI 11·7–41·8; p=0·0019) 
in seizure frequency.
In the placebo group, the median percentage reduction 
in seizure frequency peaked at week 10, and remained 
relatively stable throughout the rest of the core phase 
(fi
 gure 2). However, everolimus-treated patients reported 
an increasing benefi
 t until the end of the core phase 
(week 18). A similar pattern of diff

groups was observed when the measure of effi
  cacy was 
seizure freedom (fi
 gure 2). Quantifying these obser-
vations, a repeated measures analysis including both 
exposure and fi
 xed time intervals of 2 weeks as predictors 
noted that a doubling of TN Cmin was associated with 
a signifi
 cant average reduction of 9·7% (95% CI 
5·7–13·6; p<0·0001) in seizure frequency across the core 
phase. The time under treatment was also associated 
with a statistically signifi
 cant 4·8% reduction (95% CI 
3·2–6·3; p<0·0001) in seizure frequency for each period 
of 15 days more under treatment.
All 
patients 
assigned 
to 
placebo, 
low-exposure 
everolimus, or high-exposure everolimus received at least 
one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline 
assessment, and were therefore included in the safety 
anaylsis. The most common all-grade adverse events of 
any cause reported in more than 15% of patients in either 
treatment group during the core phase in the everolimus 
groups included stomatitis, diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, 
pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (table 3). 
Overall, 13 patients (11%) in the placebo group, 21 (18%) in 
the low-exposure everolimus group, and 31 (24%) in the 
high-exposure everolimus group experienced grade 3 or 4 
adverse events. Stomatitis of grade 3 or 4 severity was 
reported in four patients (3%) in the low-exposure group 
and fi
 ve patients (4%) in the high-exposure group. The 
other most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events (occurring 
in more than two patients) reported with everolimus 
included neutropenia (two [2%] patients in the low-
exposure group and three [2%] patients in the high-
exposure group), pneumonia (one [1%] patient and three 
[2%] patients, respectively), and irregular menstruation 
(three [2%] patients in the high-exposure group only). 
Serious adverse events were reported in three (3%) 
patients in the placebo group, 16 (14%) patients in the low-
exposure group, and 18 (14%) patients in the high-
exposure group. Adverse events leading to discontinuations 
were reported in two (2%) patients receiving placebo, six 
(5%) patients receiving low-exposure everolimus, and four 
(3%) patients receiving high-exposure everolimus, with 
stomatitis being the most common reason (two [2%] 
patients in the low-exposure group and two [2%] patients 
in the high-exposure group). Adverse events leading to a 
dose reduction or temporary interruption were reported 
in nine (8%), 28 (24%), and 46 (35%) patients in the 
placebo, low-exposure everolimus, and high-exposure 
everolimus groups, respectively. No deaths were reported 
during the core phase. Pharmacokinetic modelling 
assessing the exposure–safety relationship of everolimus 
showed that the changes in rates of stomatitis and 
infections observed upon doubling of exposure were not 
statistically signifi
 cant (data not shown).
Discussion
In this prospective, randomised phase 3 trial, everolimus 
produced a signifi
 cant reduction in seizure frequency in 
patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy and tuberous 
sclerosis complex compared with placebo. At baseline, 
nearly half of patients had failed treatment with six or 
more previous antiepileptic drugs, and the median 
seizure frequency was 37·5 per 28 days, suggesting a 
heavily pretreated population with a severe seizure 
burden. Tuberous sclerosis complex is associated with 
various seizure types and epilepsy syndromes.1 Previous 
studies of antiepileptic drugs have focused on either 
a specifi
 c syndrome (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) or a 
single seizure type (eg, primary generalised tonic-clonic 
seizure, atonic seizure).26,27 EXIST-3 is, to our knowledge, 
the largest cause-specifi
 c epilepsy drug trial done so far; 
we enrolled patients with a known seizure cause, 
irrespective of ictal semiology or epilepsy syndrome, 
from 99 centres across 25 countries. Because everolimus 
targets the molecular basis of the underlying disease in 
patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, it could 
produce a clinically signifi
 cant reduction in seizure 
frequency. Everolimus might also have activity in 
epilepsies associated with mTOR activation from other 
causes, such as DEPDC5 or STRAD mutations.5
Few clinical trials have assessed the role of mTOR 
inhibitors for seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex.15,28 Our study showed an improvement in 
seizure control with everolimus among multiple seizure 
types, suggesting that everolimus can treat a variety of 
seizure types in this population irrespective of epilepsy 
syndrome. The odds for response in patients treated with 
everolimus were 2·2-times (low-exposure group) and 
3·9-times (high-exposure group) higher than with 
placebo. A previous uncontrolled study with everolimus

showed a 50% or greater reduction in seizures in 
12 (60%) of 20 patients, with an overall median decrease 
in seizure frequency of 73% (p<0·001) and a median 70% 
decrease in cumulative seizure duration (p=0·020).15 
Results from the sensitivity analysis (adjusted for an 
18-week follow-up period) in the EXIST-3 study were 
consistent with the primary analysis.
During the core phase, the safety profi
 les of the 
low-exposure everolimus and high-exposure everolimus 
groups were similar to each other. The decision to use 
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events assessment scale to evaluate the safety 
profi
 le of the study treatment was in accordance with 
our experience from previous studies of everolimus 
in tuberous sclerosis complex for the treatment of 
subependymal 
giant-cell 
astrocytoma 
and 
renal 
angiomyolipoma. In most epilepsy studies, adverse 
events are usually classifi
 ed only into “mild”, “moderate”, 
and “severe”. The number of severe adverse events and 
events leading to discontinuation in this study were 
consistent with fi
 ndings from previous studies of 
antiepileptic drugs. For example, in a study of 
perampanel,26 six (7·4%) of 81 patients experienced 
serious adverse events, and nine (11·1%) had adverse 
events leading to discontinuation; by comparison, we 
noted a somewhat higher frequency of severe adverse 
events (21%) with everolimus in this study, but a 
substantially lower frequency of adverse events leading 
to discontinuation (4%). The frequency and incidence of 
adverse events with everolimus reported here were 
consistent with the known safety profi
 le of everolimus in 
tuberous sclerosis complex.14,18,29 No new safety signals 
were identifi
 ed. Importantly, the common side-eff
 ects of 
everolimus were generally non-overlapping with the 
typical side-eff
 ects of antiepileptic drugs such as 
sleepiness, dizziness, and fatigue, which might make it 
easier for patients to tolerate the medication in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs, and could 
account for the relatively low dropout rate in the study.
Previously, everolimus was reported to reduce the 
volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma29 and 
renal angiomyolipoma,18 which led to the approval of 
everolimus in these indications. Everolimus has also been 
reported to improve the appearence of skin lesions (facial 
angiofi
 broma) in these patients.14 Yet results from the 
current study demonstrate the clinical benefi
 ts of 
everolimus for another manifestation of tuberous 
sclerosis 
complex, 
treatment-resistant 
seizures. 
Everolimus diff
 ers from other antiepileptic drugs by 
targeting the dysregulation of the mTOR cellular 
signalling pathway, providing an opportunity for 
therapeutic synergy. Everolimus initiated for one of its 
approved indications could also reduce seizures, and 
everolimus initiated for seizures could be expected 
to improve other manifestations of the disorder 
(eg, 
subependymal 
giant-cell 
astrocytoma, 
renal 
angiomyolipoma, facial angiofi
 broma). However, it 
should be noted that the exposure–response relationship 
diff
 ers among the diff
 erent indications. 
Linear mixed models supported a statistically and 
clinically signifi
 cant association between a two-times 
increase in TN Cmin and a 28·3% reduction in seizure 
frequency. In the studies of subependymal giant-cell 
astrocytoma and angiomyolipoma, a two-times Cmin 
increase was associated with a non-clinically signifi
 cant 
10% (unpublished) and 13% statistically signifi
 cant 
reduction in volumes,30 respectively. This diff
 erence in 
exposure–response relationship might relate to higher 
interindividual variability of exposure and a threshold eff
 ect 
in the tumour-volume-based trials, or greater sensitivity of 
synaptic plasticity and neuronal hyperexcitability in this 
seizure study.
Several limitations in our study should be noted. Firstly, 
the results showed short-term benefi
 t of everolimus when 
added to best-available antiepileptic drug therapy during 
the core phase. With a potential need for multiyear or 
lifelong therapy in patients with tuberous sclerosis 
complex, exploration of longer-term durability of effi
  cacy 
and maintenance of safety and tolerability of everolimus is 
essential. With nearly 90% of patients continuing treatment 
in the extension phase, the EXIST-3 study could, in time, 
provide additional long-term effi
  cacy and safety data 
relating to everolimus in patients with treatment-resistant

seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Active 
surveillance and proactive management of adverse events 
are warranted in these patients, as in a phase 1/2 study 
where everolimus maintained seizure control for 4 years in 
14 of 18 patients and had a tolerable safety profi
 le.31 Second, 
in this study we had intended to report the eff
 ect of 
everolimus on patient behaviour using the Vineland 
Adaptive Behavior Scale Survey; however, the substantial 
intellectual disability in the study population resulted in 
frequent failure of investigators to perform the survey at 
baseline and yielded profound fl
 ooring (ie, scores below 
which the test can no longer distinguish levels of 
behavioural attainment) in many surveys, limiting the 
interpretation 
of 
results. 
Finally, 
we 
noted 
less 
diff
 erentiation in exposure than anticipated between the 
two everolimus groups, because of lower-than-expected 
exposure 
in 
the 
high-exposure 
everolimus 
group 
(median Cmin values at the end of the core phase were 
5·1 ng/mL for the low-exposure everolimus group and 
8·3 ng/mL for the high-exposure everolimus group). This 
lack of diff
 erentiation seems to have occurred because, in 
some patients, three titration steps of everolimus 2 mg or 
4 mg might not have been suffi
  cient to achieve the targeted 
trough range of 9–15 ng/mL (eg, patients with high 
everolimus clearance or high body-surface area). Despite 
overlap in actual Cmin values among the everolimus 
treatment groups, the range of exposures acheived in the 
study population was adequately broad to permit a robust 
determination of the everolimus exposure–response 
relationship. We noted that doubling of exposure could 
more than double the likelihood of a response without a 
statistically signifi
 cant increase in reported adverse events 
such as stomatitis. This fi
 nding suggests that increased 
exposure of everolimus might be a reasonable option for 
patients who do not demonstrate a satisfactory reduction in 
seizure frequency.
Existing antiepileptic drugs are thought to reduce 
seizure frequency through a direct antiseizure eff
 ect on 
neuronal hyperexcitability via γ-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)-ergic or glutamatergic mechanisms. Clinical 
eff
 ects of antiepileptic drugs are observed rapidly 
(seizure reduction is noted within days of initiating 
treatment) and remains stable through the duration of 
treatment.32,33  The mechanism of action of everolimus 
and its clinical eff
 ects are more complex. Findings from 
animal models suggest that mTOR inhibitors, such as 
everolimus, have antiepileptogenic eff
 ects by altering 
signalling pathways and protein expression, and 
modifying 
downstream 
mechanisms 
involved 
in 
epileptogenesis. These mechanisms drive complex 
morphological changes to neuronal and glial cells that 
evolve over long periods of time in animal models.12 
Consistent with these observations, Krueger and 
colleagues15 reported in a single-group study that 
everolimus reduced seizure frequency more in the later 
weeks than in earlier weeks of the 12-week study. This 
observation of a correlation between longer exposure 
and effi
  cacy has been confi
 rmed in this study, in which 
a clinically meaningful and statistically signifi
 cant 
reduction in seizure frequency continued to improve 
throughout the core phase. Pharmacokinetic modelling 
demonstrated that every 15 days of treatment delivered 
an additional 4·8% reduction in seizure frequency. 
This observation contrasts with that expected for 
levetiracetam33 and other antiepileptic drugs, which 
typically do not exhibit time-dependent amelioration of 
clinical benefi
 t.
In conclusion, our fi
 ndings demonstrate that everolimus 
treatment of mixed-type seizures in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex, despite the high baseline burden of 
seizures in these individuals, can lead to a clinically 
meaningful reduction in seizure frequency with a 
favourable 
benefi
 t–risk 
ratio 
that 
improves 
with 
ongoing treatment. Everolimus, a disease-modifying drug 
targeting the underlying molecular pathology of tuberous 
sclerosis complex, represents a new treatment option for 
patients with treatment-resistant seizures associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex. Further evaluation of mTOR 
inhibitors in patients with other diseases of treatment-
resistant seizures and cortical malformations, resulting 
from PI3K-mTOR pathway mutations causing mTOR 
overactivation, could be warranted.
