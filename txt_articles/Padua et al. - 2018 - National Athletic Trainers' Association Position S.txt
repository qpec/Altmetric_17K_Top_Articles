Objective:
To provide certified athletic trainers, physicians,
and other health care and fitness professionals with recommen-
dations based on current evidence regarding the prevention of
noncontact and indirect-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
injuries in athletes and physically active individuals.
Background:
Preventing ACL injuries during sport and
physical activity may dramatically decrease medical costs and
long-term disability. Implementing ACL injury-prevention training
programs may improve an individual’s neuromuscular control
and lower extremity biomechanics and thereby reduce the risk of
injury. Recent evidence indicates that ACL injuries may be
prevented through the use of multicomponent neuromuscular-
training programs.
Recommendations:
Multicomponent
injury-prevention
training programs are recommended for reducing noncontact
and indirect-contact ACL injuries and strongly recommended
for reducing noncontact and indirect-contact knee injuries
during physical activity. These programs are advocated for
improving balance, lower extremity biomechanics, muscle
activation, functional performance, strength, and power, as
well as decreasing landing impact forces. A multicomponent
injury-prevention training program should, at minimum, pro-
vide feedback on movement technique in at least 3 of the
following exercise categories: strength, plyometrics, agility,
balance, and flexibility. Further guidance on training dosage,
intensity, and implementation recommendations is offered in
this statement.
Key Words:
knee injuries, lower extremity biomechanics,
neuromuscular control, injury prevention
L
ower extremity injuries make up 66% of all sports
injuries, the knee being the most commonly injured
joint.1 A particularly important and devastating type
of knee injury is rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL). Unfortunately, surgical reconstruction and rehabil-
itation do not prevent long-term morbidity or decrease the
risk of future ACL injury.2–7 The costs associated with
surgically reconstructed ACL injuries range from $5000 to
$17 000 per patient; however, the estimated long-term
societal costs may be as high as $38 000 per patient.8–13
Perhaps even more alarming than the high financial costs
was a report14 indicating that the rate of ACL injuries is
rising rapidly. Preventing ACL injuries during sport and
physical activity may dramatically decrease medical costs
and long-term disability.
Most ACL injuries do not involve a direct blow to the
knee15–17 but rather are noncontact or indirect contact in
nature, involving uncontrolled lower extremity biomechan-
ics. Thus, ACL injury prevention may be achieved by
implementing training programs that improve an individ-
ual’s neuromuscular control and lower extremity biome-
chanics.
Compared with single-component training programs,
multicomponent training programs, or programs that
require more than 1 type of exercise (eg, agility, balance,
flexibility), appear more effective in reducing ACL

 injury rates.18–21 However, no researchers have identified
a single optimal preventive training program. As such,
general guidelines and recommendations are provided for
developing a multicomponent training program for
preventing ACL injury. Based on available evidence,
we recommend that a multicomponent injury-prevention
training program include, at minimum, feedback on
proper exercise technique for at least 3 of the following
exercise types: strength, plyometrics, agility, balance,
and flexibility. More detailed information on the
rationale, development, and implementation of a multi-
component training program, as well as identification of
target populations, is offered in the ‘‘Background and
Literature Review’’ section.
Therefore, the purpose of this position statement is to
provide certified athletic trainers (ATs), physicians, and
other health care and fitness professionals with recom-
mendations based on current evidence regarding the
prevention of noncontact and indirect-contact ACL
injuries in athletes and physically active individuals.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Effects of Injury-Prevention Training Programs on
Injury Reduction and Performance Enhancement
Two primary areas of benefit are associated with injury-
prevention training programs: decreased risk of ACL and
other knee injuries and improved performance.
1. Multicomponent training programs that include feed-
back regarding technique and at least 3 of the exercise
categories (ie, strength, plyometrics, agility, balance,
and flexibility) are recommended to reduce noncon-
tact and indirect-contact ACL injuries during physical
activity.18–21,23–31 Strength of Recommendation

perform a multicomponent training program to reduce
the risk of noncontact and indirect-contact ACL injury
during physical activity.18,20 SOR: A

training program to reduce the risk of noncontact and
indirect-contact ACL injury during physical activi-

indirect-contact knee injuries other than ACL
injuries during physical activity in females and
males.18,24,27,31–47 SOR: A

Development of Multicomponent Injury-Prevention
Training Programs (Exercise Selection, Intensity, and
Volume)
The acute variables for injury-prevention training (ie,
specific exercises to perform, order of exercises, repeti-
tions, sets, intensity, tempo, rest periods between exercis-
es, and training-session duration) vary among programs
that successfully decrease injury rates and improve
neuromuscular function and physical performance. Thus,
we cannot recommend a specific multicomponent training
program or group of exercises to prevent ACL injury.
However, certain common features of the preventive
training programs have been shown to be successful in
reducing injury rates and improving neuromuscular
function and physical performance. Therefore, general
guidelines regarding the organization and types of
exercises to include in multicomponent training programs
are provided.
Exercise Selection and Training Intensity
7. A multicomponent preventive training program involves
offering feedback on movement technique (eg, ‘‘land
softly,’’ ‘‘keep your knees over your toes,’’ ‘‘bend your
knees and hips’’) and should include at least 3 of the
following exercise categories: strength, plyometrics,
agility, balance, and flexibility.18–20,23–27,29–31,78–84 SOR: B
8. Injury-prevention training exercises should be per-
formed at progressive intensity levels that are chal-
lenging and allow for excellent movement quality and
technique.18,25,27,30,31 SOR: C
Training Volume (Frequency and Duration)
9. Multicomponent training programs should be per-
formed during the preseason and in-season.18,20,26,30,31
SOR: B
10. Multicomponent training programs should be per-
formed at least 2 to 3 times per week throughout the
preseason and in-season.18,19,23,27,31 SOR: B
11. To maintain the benefits of reduced injury rates and
improved neuromuscular function and performance
over time, multicomponent training programs (pre-
season, in-season, and off-season) should be per-

Implementation of Multicomponent Injury-Prevention
Training Programs (Program Adoption and
Maintenance)
12. Multicomponent training programs should be regularly
supervised by individuals who are skilled in identifying
faulty movement patterns to ensure excellent move-
ment quality and provide feedback on exercise
technique.18,19,23–25,31 SOR: C
13. Multicomponent training programs are effective when
implemented as a dynamic warm-up or as part of a
comprehensive strength and conditioning pro-
gram.18,19,23,31 SOR: C
14. To facilitate the adoption of and compliance with
multicomponent training programs, we support the
education of athletes, coaches, parents, and adminis-
trators on the following points related to preventive
training programs.88–95 SOR: C
a. Lower extremity injuries are common in sports.
b. Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a lower extremity
injury that is particularly costly and potentially
debilitating.
c. Multicomponent training programs reduce ACL injury
rates.
d. Multicomponent training programs not only are effec-
tive in reducing injury but also can improve physical
performance.
e. Many elite-level athletes and coaches already incorpo-
rate injury-prevention training exercises as part of their
in-season and off-season training programs.
f. Multicomponent training programs can be seamlessly
incorporated into preseason, in-season, and off-season
training practices without taking time away from skill
development.
g. If time constraints are a concern, some evidence
indicates that multicomponent training programs can
be performed in 10 to 15 minutes as part of a dynamic
warm-up before the start of practices and games.
h. The rationale for exercise selection and the importance
of maintaining proper technique and movement quality
when performing exercises should be emphasized.
15. When implementing multicomponent training pro-
grams for children (ie, 15 years of age and younger),
the following are advocated. SOR: C
a. Incorporate movement patterns that are developmental-
ly appropriate for children (eg, balancing, running,
skipping, landing, squatting) in addition to sport-
specific movements (eg, jump landings, jump stops,
cutting maneuvers).55,96,97
b. Focus on body control and movement quality by
providing regular feedback about proper exercise
technique.55,96,98
c. Shorten the session or break it into multiple shorter
segments depending upon the child’s attention span.55,72,96
Targeting Individuals for Injury-Prevention Training
Programs
All individuals involved in sports and physical activity
are advised to participate in a multicomponent preventive
training program. However, those who are active in
particular sports or display certain traits should be targeted
for preventive training as they either are at a relatively
higher risk of ACL injury or have a greater potential for
benefit.
16. Athletes participating in high-risk sports that involve
landing, jumping, and cutting tasks (eg, basketball,
soccer, team handball), especially females, should be
targeted for injury-prevention training.21,81,99,100 SOR:
A
17. Because a history of ACL injury is one of the strongest
predictors of future ACL injury, individuals with such
a history, especially younger individuals who return to
sport-related activities, should be targeted for injury-
prevention training.22,99,101–106 SOR: A
18. Children participating in higher-risk sports for ACL
injury that involve landing, jumping, and cutting tasks
(eg, basketball, football, soccer) should be targeted for
injury-prevention training.55,107–111 SOR: C
BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Sport-related musculoskeletal injuries represent a serious
long-term health concern for millions of Americans and
need to be prevented when possible. Data suggest that
sport-related injuries cause 20% of injured schoolchildren
to miss at least 1 school day each year and 28% of injured
working adults to lose at least 1 workday each year.1,12 In
addition to immediate time lost from work, school, or sport,
musculoskeletal injuries are a primary reason people stop
being physically active, which has detrimental effects on
future health. Lower extremity injuries make up 66% of all
sport-related injuries, and the knee is the most commonly
injured joint.1 A particularly important and devastating type
of knee injury is rupture of the ACL.
Both females and males are at risk for ACL injury and
may benefit from injury-prevention programs. Recent
estimates from the general population indicate that 1 to 5
ACL injuries occur per 5000 persons over a life-
time.15,112,113 In the United States alone, an estimated
200 000 ACL injuries occur annually15; however, the
incidence of ACL injury is greater among athletic and
military populations.114 In Switzerland, the rate of ACL
injury in the general population is less than 1 injury per
100 000 athlete-hours of sports exposure,112 but the rate
rises dramatically in specific athlete subgroups: for
example, up to 1 injury per 1000 athlete-hours for females
playing in professional soccer games.115,116 Thus, the rate
may be 10 to 100 times higher in elite athletes than in the
general population. Males also sustain more ACL injuries
than females in the general population.15,108,113 Yet high
school- and college-aged females participating in compa-
rable sports (eg, basketball, soccer, softball) are at 1.5 to 4.6
times greater risk of experiencing an ACL injury compared
with their male counterparts.99,100,102,104,112 This is not to
suggest that male athletes are at low risk for ACL injury.
Among male high school football athletes, the rate of ACL
injuries is 11.1 per 100 000 athlete-exposures, similar to
that in female high school soccer and basketball athletes.100
Perhaps most alarming are reports14,117 indicating the rate
of ACL injuries is rapidly rising.

 Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a career-threatening,
if not career-ending, injury in athletes. After ACL
reconstructive surgery, an estimated 82% of individuals
return to sport participation; however, only 63% return to
their preinjury level of sport participation, and only 44%
return to competitive sport.118 The injury also carries other
long-term consequences, as the odds of developing knee
osteoarthritis are nearly 4 times greater after knee injury,119
making a previous knee injury a strong risk factor for early
knee osteoarthritis.120 The rates of osteoarthritis after ACL
injury range from 10% to 90% within 10 to 20 years.3
Progression of knee osteoarthritis after ACL injury is not
ameliorated by surgical reconstruction and rehabilitation:
the risk of developing osteoarthritis is the same in ACL-
injured patients who undergo surgical reconstruction as in
those who do not.2–7
In addition to substantial long-term consequences and a
high level of disability, ACL injury places a large burden
on the health care system. A single ACL injury results in
multiple physician and rehabilitation visits, generating
significant costs to the health care system. A recent
estimate12 indicated that approximately $3 000 000 000 is
spent annually on the ACL reconstruction process. Thus,
given the associated frequency, disability, and costs, there
is a great need to prevent ACL injuries.
Most ACL injuries are noncontact or indirect contact in
nature and do not involve a direct blow to the knee.15–17
Noncontact or indirect-contact ACL injuries involve
uncontrolled lower extremity biomechanics, which suggests
that some ACL injuries may be preventable. Therefore, the
purpose of this position statement is to provide certified
ATs, physicians, and other health care and fitness
professionals with current best-practice recommendations
regarding the prevention of noncontact and indirect-contact
ACL injuries in athletes and physically active individuals.
This position statement provides recommendations based
on available current evidence related to the benefits,
development, and implementation of injury-prevention
training programs, as well as the identification of target
populations for these programs. The majority of effective
preventive training programs incorporate a multicomponent
exercise program including feedback on proper exercise
technique for at least 3 of the following types of exercises:
strength, plyometrics, agility, balance, and flexibility.
Benefits of Injury-Prevention Training Programs
Reduced ACL Injury Rate. Multicomponent preventive
training programs reduce the rate of ACL injury in males
and females participating in sport.18,19,23–31 In previous
systematic reviews with meta-analyses,83,121,122 the quality
of the included studies has been evaluated (Table 1). These
authors cited 7 level 1 studies18,20,23,24,27,28,30 and 7 level 2
studies.19,25,26,29,31,43,44 It should be noted that these reviews
incorporated 2 studies that did not use a multicomponent
training program43,44 but instead either isolated
plyometric43 or balance44 exercises, which did not reduce
ACL injury rates. The effectiveness of injury-prevention
training programs was also observed in the consistent
findings of recent systematic reviews with meta-analyses.
Overall, ACL injuries were reduced by 51% to 62% when
athletes performed a preventive training program.78,82 In
addition, those who participated in a preventive training
program had a greater relative risk reduction (RRR; 70%;
95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 54%, 80%)79 and lower
odds (odds ratio ¼ 0.54; 95% CI ¼ 0.35, 0.82)121,122 of
sustaining an ACL injury than those who did not. These
findings are very promising regarding the ability to reduce
ACL injuries by regularly performing an injury-prevention
training program.
This body of evidence is limited by the small number of
high-quality level 1 studies in which researchers specifi-
cally examined ACL injury after a preventive training
program was implemented. However, the authors of 3 level
1 studies18,20,23 reported a large reduction in ACL injury
rates (64%–73%) when a multicomponent preventive
training program was performed. Although Gilchrist et
al23 did not detect a statistically significant reduction in
injury rate (P ¼ .06), the 70% reduction they identified may

 be clinically meaningful given the difficulty of capturing a
sufficient number of ACL injuries for adequate statistical
power. However, these studies were limited to young (aged
13–24 years) females participating in basketball or soccer.
The findings of LaBella et al,18 Walden et al,20 and
Gilchrist et al23 support the use of multicomponent injury-
prevention training programs to reduce ACL injury rates in
young females (aged 13–24 years), who are at greatest risk
for sustaining an ACL injury. These investigators studied
training programs that were implemented by coaches or
ATs who had undergone formal training, used a combina-
tion of progressive multicomponent exercises with an
emphasis on technique, and were performed at least 2 to
3 times per week with good compliance. The other level 1
studies either lacked sufficient power for a statistical
evaluation of the program’s effects on ACL injury
risk24,27,42 or failed to detect statistical significance because
of poor player compliance with the program.30
Limited research has examined the effects of preventive
training programs on ACL injury rates in males. Silvers-
Granelli et al21 performed the only high-quality study that
demonstrated a significant reduction (4.25-fold) in ACL
injuries after collegiate male soccer athletes completed an
injury-prevention training program. Other investiga-
tors27,33,124 showed a reduction in ACL injuries, but their
studies lacked the statistical power necessary to specifically
examine ACL injury as an outcome. Future work is needed
to further assess the effectiveness of preventive training
programs in reducing ACL injuries in male athletes.
Reduced Lower Limb and Knee Injury Rate. A
substantial body of evidence18,21,24,27,31–47 supports the
implementation of preventive training programs to reduce
all noncontact and indirect-contact lower limb and knee
injuries in both males and females. A meta-analysis40 of
multicomponent preventive training programs revealed that
these programs significantly reduced lower limb injuries
(RRR ¼ 39%, 95% CI ¼ 23%, 41%) and acute knee injuries
(RRR ¼ 54%, 95% CI ¼ 24%, 72%). In a separate meta-
analysis,34 such training programs were effective in
preventing all sports injuries. Based on this body of
evidence, multicomponent preventive training programs
should be performed regularly to reduce the risk of lower
limb and knee injuries in males and females.
Improved Biomechanics, Neuromuscular Control, and
Functional Performance. In addition to reducing the rate of
ACL injuries, preventive training programs have other
benefits related to improved biomechanics, neuromuscular
control, and functional performance (eg, speed, agility,
power, strength). These are important benefits to
emphasize, as improvements in these measures may
facilitate the long-term adoption of injury-prevention
training programs by athletes and coaches. Lower extremity
biomechanics, neuromuscular control, and functional
performance measures are considered disease-oriented
evidence according to the Strength of Recommendation
Taxonomy.22 Recommendations based on disease-oriented
evidence are automatically classified as level C evidence.
Thus, despite high-quality successful studies, only level C
evidence exists for the benefits of injury-prevention training
programs to improve lower extremity biomechanics,
neuromuscular control, and functional performance.
Furthermore, no evidence to date suggests that changing
these disease-oriented measures will have a direct effect on
patient-oriented outcomes (eg, injury rates).
Altered lower extremity biomechanics, such as limited
sagittal-plane motion and excessive frontal- or transverse-
plane motion, place abnormal loads on the lower extremity
joints and soft tissues.125,126 Consequently, these move-
ments (eg, knee valgus, hip adduction, limited knee flexion)
are frequently discussed as modifiable risk factors for ACL
injury. Numerous authors50,59,63,66–68 have reported success
in reducing ground reaction forces with multicomponent
preventive training programs and by increasing knee- and
hip-flexion motion.49–52 Although 1 or more of these
changes in movement mechanics may provide mechanistic
support for the success of preventive training programs, no
data directly link these biomechanical changes to a
reduction in ACL injuries. The literature is less conclusive
regarding the ability to modify frontal- and transverse-plane
motion at the knee and hip using preventive training
programs. Some research supports the use of these
programs to reduce excessive knee valgus,59,127,128 knee
rotation,55 hip adduction,59,62 and hip rotation,49,62 but these
outcomes have not been observed consistently. This
discrepancy in the literature may be explained by large
differences among studies in methods, target populations,
and types of training programs.
Consistent evidence44,59,69–71 indicated that preventive
training programs can improve single-legged balance
ability in active, asymptomatic individuals. Poor single-
legged balance indicates impaired neuromuscular control
and is a risk factor for lower extremity injury.129–131
Recently, Steffen et al132 demonstrated simultaneous
injury-rate reductions and improved balance after adoles-
cent female soccer athletes performed a preventive training
program with high compliance. This finding supports the
roles of balance and neuromuscular control in reducing the
risk of and preventing injuries.
In addition to reducing injury rates and modify-
ing
neuromuscular
factors
related
to
injury
risk,
preventive training programs can also improve muscle
strength48,49,51–53,61,63,72–75 and athletic performance mea-
sures (eg, vertical-jump height, hop distance, hop speed,
estimated V
˙ O2max, sprint speed).48,49,52,61,69,73,76 Lower
extremity strength and performance changes have been
documented primarily after longer-duration (.60 min-
utes per session) training programs.50,61,63,77 Some
shorter-duration (approximately 15 minutes) training
programs have demonstrated improved vertical-jump
height in youth athletes, indicating that performance
improvements may also be possible with briefer pro-
grams.51,69 However, future investigation is necessary to
elucidate changes in performance and muscle strength
after preventive training programs because these changes
may be critical elements to promote when pursuing
adoption by coaches and athletes.
Preventive Training Program Components
No evidence suggests that a single optimal preventive
training program exists. Instead, general guidelines should
be considered when developing or implementing an injury-
prevention training program. An overview of the types of
exercises included in the ACL injury-prevention programs
that have been studied to date is provided in Table 2. These
Journal of Athletic Training
9
 guidelines can and should be modified for specific
populations (eg, activity, age, sex, time available) to
encourage program adoption, implementation, fidelity,
and maintenance. Several meta-analyses78–80,82–84,122 dem-
onstrated the risk of an ACL injury was reduced between
39% and 73% in those who performed a multicomponent
preventive training program compared with those who did
not. The wide range of injury reduction is likely attributable
to including athletes with contact or noncontact injury
mechanisms. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis133
showed that a multicomponent program involving strength,
balance, plyometric, and proximal neuromuscular control
exercises was more effective in reducing ACL injuries than
a single-component program. Based on these collective
findings, a multicomponent preventive training program is
recommended to reduce ACL and knee injury risk.
Although multicomponent injury-prevention training
programs reduced ACL injury rates, few researchers have
examined the ideal combination of program components
(eg, exercise selection, volume, intensity). No randomized
controlled trials have directly compared the effects of
different training programs or the individual components of
these programs on ACL injury rates. Thus, it is difficult to
determine the combination of components that is most
effective in a multicomponent training program.
Multicomponent preventive training programs typically
include instruction and feedback on proper exercise
technique for at least 3 of the following exercise types:
strength, plyometrics, agility, balance, and flexibility.83
Exercises used in multicomponent programs for reduction
of ACL injury rates are described in Table 3. Strength-
training exercises focus on improving muscle force
production using body weight, free weights, or resistance
machines. Plyometric training incorporates explosive
movements, such as repeated jumping or bounding. Agility
training addresses several important motor skills (eg,
acceleration, deceleration, accurate changes of direction
within the environment). Each component can be pursued
individually, and then the components can be combined for
agility training. Balance exercises often involve single-
legged– or double-legged–stance tasks that incorporate
various levels of visual input (eyes open � eyes closed),
surface stability or hardness (stable � unstable and hard �
unstable and soft), and external perturbations (no perturba-
tion � moving extremities � catching a ball � partner
perturbation). Lastly, flexibility training focuses on either
static or dynamic stretching.
Successful multicomponent preventive training programs
typically incorporate 1 to 3 exercises from each category
(Table 3). These exercises are often performed in a 15- to
20-minute time period as part of a dynamic warm-up before
sport activities. The specific exercises and intensity selected
should be based on the individual’s ability to complete the
exercises with good technique.
The authors of meta-analyses78,82–84,134 have attempted to
address how the components of preventive training
programs influence the ability to decrease ACL injury
rates. Several investigators83,84 have reported that plyo-
metric and strengthening exercises were effective compo-
nents for reducing ACL injuries, whereas balance exercises
were not. However, Sugimoto et al133 suggested that the
failure to see a positive result from balance exercises may
actually reflect the possibility that balance exercises are not
protective in isolation but are protective in combination
with other exercises. It is interesting that a greater reduction
in ACL injury rates was observed in programs with more
emphasis on and greater duration of static stretching.83
However, only 3 studies included in this meta-analysis used
static stretching, so caution is warranted when interpreting
this finding. In addition, when the static stretching is
performed during the course of a preventive training
program should be considered. Static stretching can result
in negative acute effects on maximal muscle strength and
explosive muscle performance135 and therefore may be best
incorporated at the end of training rather than during a
dynamic warm-up. In separate meta-analyses,84,133 ACL
injury risk was reduced in programs that incorporated
strength, plyometric, and agility training. In 2 additional
meta-analyses,78,134 researchers were unable to evaluate the
effects of isolated types of training because of heterogene-
ity among the articles included.
Based on the available evidence, we recommend that
multicomponent injury-prevention training programs in-
clude feedback on movement technique and quality and
incorporate exercises from at least 3 of the following
categories: strength, plyometrics, agility, balance, and
flexibility.18–21,23–27,29–31,78–84
An inverse dose response has been shown between
preventive training programs and ACL injury rates (ie,
increased dosage was associated with decreased ACL
injury rates). The dosage may be influenced by both the
volume and intensity of training. Volume is affected by the
time in a single training session, the frequency of
performing the program each week, and the total duration

 of the program over the entire training period. No original
research studies have directly examined the effects of time
in a single training session; however, decreased ACL injury
rates occurred with preventive training programs that lasted
approximately 15 minutes or longer (see Table 1 for ACL
injury odds ratios between preventive-training and control
groups).18–20,23,27,31 In a recent meta-analysis,123 training
sessions of both short (,20 minutes’) and long (.20
minutes’) duration reduced the ACL injury risk, but long-
duration training sessions lowered the risk of ACL injury
by 26% more than short-duration sessions. Although long-
duration training sessions may improve a program’s
effectiveness, this factor should be weighed against the
potential negative influence on program adoption and
compliance. Thus, preventive training sessions lasting at
least 15 minutes appear to be effective in reducing ACL
injuries.
Training-session frequency is also important, as a
minimal number of sessions per week may be required to
realize a program’s injury-prevention benefits. Soligard et
al45 observed that players who performed a preventive
training program an average of 1.5 times per week had a
35% lower risk of ACL injury compared with those players
who were less compliant (,0.7 times per week). Steffen et
al132 also noted that individuals who performed a
preventive training program an average of 2.2 times per

 week had a lower risk of lower extremity injury than low-
compliance individuals (,1.5 times per week on average).
In the 2 level 1 studies18,20 demonstrating reduced ACL
injury rates, the rate of compliance was high. On average,
the intervention groups performed the preventive training
programs 3.3 and 1.8 times per week in the LaBella et al18
and Walden et al20 studies, respectively. The authors of a
recent meta-analysis123 showed that 2 or more training
sessions per week were associated with a 27% lower risk of
ACL injury than a single session per week. Based on these
collective findings, multicomponent preventive training
programs should be performed 2 to 3 times per week to
achieve the minimal dosage needed to reduce ACL injury
rates.
Total program duration is also a consideration, as a
minimal amount of total training time may be required to
improve neuromuscular risk factors and lower one’s risk of
injury. Gagnier et al78 reported that programs with a longer
duration of follow-up (�14 months) and a greater number
of training hours per week (.0.75 h/wk) were more
effective in reducing ACL injury rates. Yoo et al84
demonstrated that performing preventive training programs
during both preseason and in-season was more effective in
reducing injury rates than performing them during either
preseason or in-season alone. In contrast, Taylor et al83
found that total training time and individual training-
session duration did not affect ACL injury rates. Most
recently, Sugimoto et al123 investigated total training time
per week (low ¼ ,15 minutes, moderate ¼ 15–30 minutes,
high ¼ .30 minutes) and revealed that 68% of expected
ACL injuries were avoided by performing a preventive
training program multiple times per week and for more than
20 minutes per session. In another study,87 a longer duration
of training (9 months versus 3 months) led to better
retention of improved landing biomechanics, but injury
rates were not evaluated. To ensure sufficient time to
modify one’s neuromuscular risk factors and achieve long-
term retention, we recommend that injury-prevention
training programs be initiated early in the preseason and
continue in-season to attain sufficient total training duration
and reduce ACL injury rates.
In summary, although no specific injury-prevention
training program, combination of exercises, single train-
ing-session duration, training-session frequency, or total
training duration can be recommended, evidence suggests
that multicomponent preventive training programs can
reduce ACL injuries up to 75% if performed on a regular
basis (2–3 times per week) beginning in the preseason.
Future research is needed to investigate methods of
optimizing preventive training programs in terms of
exercise selection and training volume, duration, and
intensity for specific groups of athletes.
Implementation of Preventive Training Programs
(Adoption and Maintenance)
As previously described, regular compliance with a
preventive training program is a critical factor in reducing
ACL and knee injury rates. Even the best-designed
preventive training programs will not be effective if they
are not performed with a high compliance rate and good
fidelity. Soccer players who were highly compliant with a
preventive training program had an 88% reduction in the
rate of ACL injury.136 Sugimoto et al123 observed similar
findings in their meta-analysis, where the compliance rate
was defined as the number of training sessions completed
divided by the total number of sessions offered. Specifi-
cally, participants with low (,33.3%) and moderate
(33.3%–66.6%) compliance rates demonstrated a 4.9 and
3.1 times greater relative risk of ACL injury, respectively,
compared with participants whose compliance rates were
high (.66.6%).
Given the importance of compliance to the program’s
success, it is vital to understand barriers to high
compliance,137 particularly when one considers that only
20% of youth soccer coaches reported performing a
structured preventive training program.138,139 Preventive
training program design and implementation factors appear
to influence compliance.140 When designing a preventive
training program, clinicians should give careful consider-
ation to (1) the amount of time required to complete a
single training session, (2) the use of sport-specific
exercises, and (3) including a variety of exercises that
may be modified or progressed over time.137 Each factor
has been reported138,140,141 to affect regular performance of
a preventive training program. Therefore, compliance may
be negatively affected by programs that take longer than 15
minutes to complete, do not include sport-specific exercis-
es, or lack variety or progression when performed over the
course of a season.
Once the preventive training program is designed,
consideration should be given to how it will be implement-
ed.137 We recommend implementation as a dynamic warm-
up before training or as part of a comprehensive strength
and conditioning program.18–21,23–31,43,44 Failure to plan
how the program will be implemented can result in poor
compliance and lack of success. Key implementation
factors to consider are (1) educating stakeholders on the
relative benefits of performing a preventive training
program, (2) training individuals to be confident in leading
the training program and providing proper feedback, and
(3) regularly monitoring for program compliance and
correct exercise technique. It is important that administra-
tors, coaches, athletes, and parents understand the impor-
tance and relative benefits of regular performance of a
preventive training program. Thus, educating these indi-
viduals on how preventive training programs can reduce the
injury risk and optimize performance may help to achieve
‘‘buy-in’’ and improve compliance.138,140 All stakeholders
must also be educated as to how the relative benefits of a
preventive training program far outweigh any perceived
barriers, such as a loss of practice time for skill
development. Providing examples of how the program
can be seamlessly integrated into existing practice and
conditioning schedules and the potential additional benefit
of enhancing sport-related performance may also be helpful
in gaining support.
Proper training of the individual who will be leading the
preventive training program is likely critical for achieving a
high rate of compliance.137 We recommend that a trained
professional who can provide feedback on movement
quality and exercise technique lead and directly supervise
training sessions.138,142 Recruiting trained professionals to
lead and monitor a preventive training program has been
shown to positively influence program compliance over the
course of a season85; however, this may not be feasible in
12
Volume 53 � Number 1 � January 2018
 many situations. Often a coach or team captain is charged
with leading a preventive training program. A lack of
confidence on the part of the coach or player leading the
training program can be a barrier to implementation. Thus,
the individual leading a preventive training program should
be trained on how to perform each exercise correctly and
how to provide proper feedback on movement quality and
exercise technique to ensure he or she is confident and
competent in leading these exercises.18,20,132 With consid-
eration of these factors related to program design and
implementation, in addition to appropriate exercise selec-
tion, the probability of achieving a high rate of compliance
may be enhanced, thereby promoting more success in
reducing ACL injury rates.
A final area of consideration for program implementation
is the population to whom the program will be delivered. A
recent meta-analysis121 demonstrated a greater effect of
preventive training programs when they were implemented
during the midteens versus older ages, but no evidence
indicated a specific age or maturation stage at which the
program should begin. As such, we recommend all children
who participate in sports involving landing, jumping, and
cutting tasks (eg, basketball, soccer, football) that are high
risk for ACL injury be targeted for preventive training
programs.55,107–111,121 It may be ideal to start preventive
training programs in those younger than 15 years, given the
greater effect of such training when implemented during the
midteens versus older ages.121
Although early intervention in children may improve the
long-term benefits of injury prevention, it is critical that
preventive training programs be modified appropriately for
younger athletes. Specifically, children may require special
considerations in both program design and implementation
to achieve optimal results. We recommend the following be
considered when implementing preventive training pro-
grams for children: (1) Incorporate movement patterns that
are developmentally appropriate for children (eg, balanc-
ing, running, skipping, landing, squatting) in addition to
sport-specific movements (eg, jump landing, jump stop,
cutting). (2) Emphasize body control and movement quality
by providing regular feedback about proper exercise
technique. (3) Use a multifaceted and integrated preventive
training program. (4) Shorten the session or break it into
multiple shorter segments depending on the child’s
attention span.55,96
Children need to develop a general foundation of motor
skills and strength in order to decrease the risk of future
injury143 and optimize confidence when participating in
physical activity. They develop fundamental motor skills,
such as running, jumping, and landing, at different
rates.144,145 Implementing programs that match an individ-
ual child’s cognitive and neuromuscular development
levels will likely promote confidence and intrinsic motiva-
tion to participate and continuously improve.97 It is also
important to allow adjustments to the programs as
necessary during development. This is especially true
during adolescence, when rapid changes in limb length
and body mass may result in muscle flexibility and strength
imbalances, as well as temporary declines in coordination
and balance.143,146 Implementing integrated, phased pro-
grams that begin with basic fundamental exercises, such as
a double-limb squat and stable balance exercises, may help
ensure that all children acquire a basic foundation of
strength, balance, and movement control. Children require
continuous feedback about their exercise technique to
optimize motor learning and appear to respond best to
internal cues of attention, such as ‘‘bend your knees.’’98,147
Programs should allow gradual, simple progressions (eg,
advancing to single-legged exercises, unstable surfaces)
and incorporate sport-specific exercises to promote the
transfer of proper movement control to at-risk activities.55
Shorter-duration programs per session (ie, 10 versus 20
minutes) may also help keep children’s attention but
consequently may require a higher volume of sessions for
them to retain the improvements.73,87
Identification of Individuals for Preventive Training
Programs
Preventive training programs are recommended for all
athletes; however, they may be critical for individuals with
a higher risk of injury. Sports involving frequent landing,
cutting, or direction changes and decelerations, such as
basketball, football, and soccer, have consistently been
shown to carry a higher risk of injury than other
sports.100,104,148 Although males account for the highest
absolute number of ACL injuries in the general population,
females in high-risk sports (eg, basketball, soccer) have a 4
to 6 times greater risk of injury compared with their male
counterparts.15 High school football players have similar
ACL injury rates to female basketball and soccer athletes,
but these rates may include direct-contact injuries.97
Consequently, we recommend these female athletes and
male football players be specifically targeted to perform
preventive training programs.
The individuals at highest risk for ACL injury are those
with a history of an ACL injury, especially younger
individuals who return to sport-related activities.149–152 This
elevated risk is consistent for both the ipsilateral and
contralateral limbs, so preventive efforts should not focus
solely on the previously injured limb. Preventive training
programs can specifically reduce the elevated risk associ-
ated with repetitive ACL injuries. Gilchrist et al23
demonstrated that after an ACL injury, individuals who
performed a preventive training program reduced their risk
substantially compared with athletes who did not perform
such a program. Therefore, we recommend that athletes
with a history of ACL injury perform preventive training
programs to reduce the risk of reinjury.
Identifying individuals at high risk for ACL injury may
allow clinicians to make prevention efforts more efficient in
situations where resources, such as time and personnel, are
limited. Proposed risk factors for ACL injury include but
are not limited to faulty movement patterns, genetics, knee-
joint laxity, and body mass index. Faulty movement
patterns (ie, restricted knee or hip flexion or excessive
knee valgus, hip adduction, or hip rotation) are considered
modifiable risk factors for ACL injury.153,154 Clinical
movement screening tests have been shown to be
reliable155–157 and valid for assessing these high-risk
movements157 and injury risk158 and should be considered
in conjunction with preventive training programs. In
addition to identifying high-risk individuals, these screen-
ing tests may help to improve adoption of and compliance
with programs by demonstrating observable changes to
Journal of Athletic Training
13
 coaches, athletes, parents, and other key personnel involved
in athletic health decisions.
Implementing preventive training programs in athletes
before high school may improve long-term compliance and
outcomes. Earlier intervention may also be ideal because
the middle-school age range is the best time for children to
develop neuromuscular control. Additionally, motor devel-
opment is not complete at this point and preadolescent
children may be at an optimal age to master fundamental
motor skills.144 Improving neuromuscular control in
children younger than 15 years may also decrease their
susceptibility to injury during the highest-risk years (ie,
adolescence). Furthermore, athletes who learn to perform
preventive training programs as part of their sport activities
at an early age may be more inclined to maintain this
behavior as they develop because they perceive it as a
normal part of sport. This attitude shift toward the
implementation of preventive training programs is likely
critical to ensuring widespread and lasting adoption of
injury-prevention programs at all levels. In summary, we
recommend that preventive training programs target not
only individuals in high-risk sports, those displaying high-
risk movement patterns, and those with a previous injury
but also younger children (,15 years).
CONCLUSIONS
The majority of ACL injuries are noncontact or indirect
contact in nature and involve uncontrolled biomechanics.
Injury-prevention training programs that improve biome-
chanics and neuromuscular control can protect the knee
joint from excessive loading and represent the best
opportunity to reduce the risk of ACL and other traumatic
knee injuries. Knowledge is growing about the ways to
optimize preventive training programs in terms of exercise
selection, training volume, and intensity; however, at this
time, we can make only general recommendations related
to the design or choice of an effective preventive training
program. Multicomponent preventive training programs
(including feedback on movement technique and quality in
combination with exercises from at least 3 of the following
categories: strength, plyometrics, agility, flexibility, and
possibly balance) that are performed 2 to 3 times per week
for approximately 15 to 20 minutes each session can
substantially reduce ACL injury rates, up to 75% in females
playing high-risk sports (eg, basketball, soccer). To reduce
the risk of ACL injuries, especially in higher-risk
populations, preventive training programs should be
implemented as part of an athlete’s preseason and in-
season training. Implementing these programs at an early
age (ie, before the age when injury rates rise) and
continuing these efforts through an individual’s competitive
years may be particularly advantageous if we are to
optimize motor-learning principles and ensure the retention
of improved neuromuscular control to reduce the risk of
injury.
Recommendations for future research are provided to
improve the efficacy and effectiveness of future multicom-
ponent preventive training programs in reducing ACL
injury rates:
1. Although good evidence indicates that multicomponent
preventive training programs are effective in reducing
ACL injury rates in females, research in males is
limited. Future investigators should examine the effec-
tiveness of preventive training programs in males
participating in high-risk sports for reducing ACL
injury.
2. Recent meta-analyses of multicomponent preventive
training programs suggest that including specific
exercises (eg, strength, proximal control, or core
stabilization) may be more effective in reducing ACL
injuries, whereas other exercises may be less effective
(eg, balance, static stretching). However, specific
exercises for reducing ACL injuries have not been
directly compared. Similarly, the role of exercise
progression over the course of an injury-prevention
program has not been examined. Future authors should
assess the effects of exercise selection and progression
to determine the most effective combination and
progression of exercises for reducing ACL injuries.
3. A growing body of research is addressing the effects of
exercise-based injury-prevention programs on biome-
chanics and neuromuscular control. However, these
studies have not consistently investigated programs
shown to be effective in reducing the risk of ACL or
knee injuries. To guide the future development of
effective and efficient multicomponent preventive
training programs, we need continued research examin-
ing the underlying mechanisms (eg, biomechanics,
neuromuscular control) of programs that have been
successful in reducing injury risk.
4. The body of research evaluating prospective risk factors
for ACL injury remains limited. Thus, it is not yet
possible to identify those individuals who should be
targeted for ACL injury-prevention interventions. High-
quality, prospective cohort studies assessing factors
such as biomechanics, neuromuscular control, genetics,
body composition, knee laxity and geometry, and
skeletal alignment are required to provide better insight
into those who may benefit most from preventive
training programs.
5. To have long-lasting public health benefits, an effective
multicomponent injury-prevention training program
must be adopted, implemented, and maintained by
multiple parties (eg, coach, athlete, parent, administra-
tion). In addition, these programs must be performed
with a high level of fidelity to maximize their benefits.
Descriptions and recommendations for implementing
multicomponent preventive training programs in real-
world settings are limited, although recent research
suggested that implementation planning can enhance
adoption by athletes and coaches. Deficiencies in the
ability to translate findings from controlled research
studies to the real world greatly limit the public health
effects of current programs. Future research into
implementation of and dissemination strategies for
multicomponent preventive training programs is needed
to improve the adoption and implementation fidelity in
real-world settings and maximize the population bene-
fits of these programs.
