This review summarises the evidence for the treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral 
neck in elderly patients. Results from randomised clinical trials and national register studies 
are presented when available. 
The advantages of arthroplasty compared with internal fixation are supported by several 
studies. A number of studies contribute to the discussions of total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
versus hemiarthroplasty and unipolar versus bipolar hemiarthroplasty, but no clear-cut 
evidence-based recommendation can be made. THA may be particularly advantageous for 
active, lucid patients with a relatively long life expectancy. For patients who are 
physiologically older, hemiarthoplasty is probably satisfactory, and for the oldest patients 
with more comorbidities, unipolar implants are considered to be sufficient. If the hospital 
can support emergency THA surgery in sufficient numbers and quality, there may be few 
patients who warrant bipolar hemiarthroplasty. 
The direct lateral approach reduces the risk of dislocation compared with the posterior 
approach. Cemented implants lower the risk of periprosthetic fracture and its subsequent 
morbidity and mortality. As the risk of peri-operative death related to bone cement can be 
reduced by adequate measures, cemented implants are recommended in fracture cases.
Take home message: There remains a great variation in the surgical management of 
patients with a hip fracture, and an evidence-based approach should improve the outcomes 
for this vulnerable patient group.

Elderly patients with a hip fracture justify
urgent medical care and surgical intervention.
Post-operatively, patients frequently demon-
strate a decline in function and a high rate of
complications including an increased risk of
mortality, and place a considerable demand on
hospital resources.1 
The treatment of displaced fractures of the
femoral neck has been debated in the literature
since the1930s, when it was termed “the
unsolved fracture”.2 In the 21st century, surgi-
cal outcomes are still variable, and as the pop-
ulation continues to age the need for research
and quality improvement continues. 
In the elderly patient, the goal of treat-
ment is to regain function as soon as possi-
ble, with minimal pain or complications. In
the event of treatment failure, many patients
do not have the capacity to withstand a sec-
ondary procedure. As urgent surgery is indi-
cated, the surgical techniques should be
robust and easily accessible in every organi-
sation. 
Fractures of the femoral neck are usually
divided into undisplaced and displaced frac-
tures. There are no studies of internal fixa-
tion versus arthroplasty in patients under
approximately 60 years of age; clinical stud-
ies focus on internal fixation and the rates of
complications and re-operation. The func-
tional outcome is seldom reported. For
undisplaced fractures, internal fixation is
considered to be the reference standard. Re-
operation is required in about one in ten
cases,3 although a randomised study com-
paring arthroplasty with internal fixation is
underway in Norway.
This review therefore considers the evi-
dence for the treatment of displaced neck of
femur fractures in elderly patients. We con-
sider the evidence for arthroplasty instead of
internal fixation. The options for arthroplasty
are varied; both total hip and hemiarthro-
plasty prostheses have cemented and unce-
mented designs. Hemiarthroplasty prostheses
may have a bipolar or unipolar head. Inser-
tion may be through a number of approaches,
of which the direct lateral4,5 and the
posterior6 are most common and discussed in
this review.

Patients and Methods
We searched PubMed for randomised trials for key words.
We included all relevant articles written in English, German
and Scandinavian, and we included all available ran-
domised controlled trial studies (RCTs). We used interna-
tional register networks (ISAR, NARA) to identify registers
in English or Scandinavian languages which include
patients with hip fractures. Large observational studies
based on national registers have increased statistical power,
but seldom provide patient-reported outcomes. 
We included studies from 14 different countries with
awareness of the traditional differences in treatment, and of
the author bias to omit culturally ‘normal’ details. For
example, the Anglo-Saxon world has continued to use the
Austin-Moore hemiarthroplasty, albeit it with decreasing
frequency.7 Meanwhile, the Scandinavian countries focused
on internal fixation techniques until the early part of the
21st century, when a sudden shift to modern modular
arthroplasty occurred.8 The use of total hip arthroplasty
(THA) as a primary treatment varies both nationally and
internationally.9 Other factors that influence outcomes
internationally include age limits for different procedures,
the accepted surgical delay, the variation in surgical train-
ing and competence, the management of complications,
rehabilitation protocols, elderly care and patients’ expecta-
tions. 
Internal fixation or replacement. A number of RCTs, with
both long and short follow-up, demonstrate that arthro-
plasty is the treatment of choice for elderly patients with
displaced fractures of the femoral neck.10-12 
Of the four RCTs spanning more than nine years, all
described significantly lower rates of re-operation for
arthroplasty compared with internal fixation, at least in
lucid patients.13-16 One study found that, after 17 years, the
functional outcome was still better following THA than
internal fixation.13 The pain and function of patients who
underwent internal fixation, without a major complication,
was never better than those who had a successful arthro-
plasty procedure.15
THA or hemiarthroplasty. Primary replacement of the femo-
ral head may be with a THA or hemiarthroplasty. 
In recent studies of modular hemiarthroplasty with four
to five years follow-up, the rate of major hip complications
ranged from 2% to 10%.17-20 The definition of ‘major’ hip
complications varied between papers, however, the two
most common complications after fracture-related hip
arthroplasty are dislocation and infection, the next is
periprosthetic fracture. Several studies support the benefits
of THA, which has a comparable long-term failure rate of
5% to 10%.13-15,17 This failure rate may increase though
with an unfavourable combination of patients and tech-
nique. For example, in demented patients treated with THA
through a posterior surgical approach, there was a failure
rate of 16%.14 Most studies define only recurrent disloca-
tions as a ‘failure’ after THA; hence complication rates
would be higher if single dislocations were also included.
Hemiarthroplasty carries the additional risk of acetabular
erosion (Fig. 1). This is an elusive condition, as it can some-
times be radiological only (i.e. subclinical). Even if the
patient has symptomatic acetabular erosion, the surgeon or
patient may not choose to undergo revision surgery (Fig. 2).
The prevalence is heavily influenced by the selection of the
patient and implant. Treating lucid patients who can walk
independently prior to their injury who are aged over 60
years with a bipolar hemiarthroplasty will lead to radiolog-
ical erosion in up to two third of the patients. However,
only one fifth will undergo revision surgery.21
In order that a fair comparison is made between hemiar-
throplasty and THA, studies including the outdated mono-
block hemiarthroplasty should be omitted. This leaves
seven randomised trials comparing THA and modular
hemiarthroplasty in healthy, cognitively lucid and relatively

active patients. Of these, four indicate better health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) and/or function after THA11,21-23
whilst three did not show any functional difference.24-26 A
study with seven to ten years follow-up showed a rate of
revision for THA of 2.5% in contrast with 20% for hemi-
arthroplasty.27 As only healthy, active patients with a good
walking ability were included, this may have contributed to
the poor outcome following hemiarthroplasty.
A large cohort study found patients treated with THA
had a lower level of pain and a higher level of satisfaction
compared with patients treated with hemiarthroplasty or
internal fixation.28
THA is assumed to have a higher risk of dislocation than
hemiarthroplasty, but the literature is contradictory, per-
haps due to the influence of variable factors such as surgical
approach.29-31 A recent meta-analysis did not find any dif-
ference in dislocation rate and concluded there is “some
evidence” to suggest that THA may lead to a better out-
come than hemiarthroplasty.32 However, THA is a
demanding operation, as malposition increases the risk of
dislocation and pain.33
The choice of THA or hemiarthroplasty should be
guided by the patient’s biological age, activity level, health
and likely remaining life span. For the majority, (those who
have functional and/or cognitive limitations) hemiarthro-
plasty is the most suitable choice. The benefits are surgery
which can be performed by a less experienced surgeon in
the emergent setting, a shorter operative time, less bleeding
and possibly a lower risk of dislocation. The long-term
advantages of THA may not be enjoyed by many as they
may be deceased within a few years. However, in active
individuals, hemiarthroplasty carries an unacceptably high
risk of acetabular erosion.21 For those patients, THA is a
better option. 
Cemented or uncemented fixation. The 
role 
for 
bone
cement in arthroplasty surgery for fracture patients is vig-
orously debated. Uncemented implants, which rely on
metaphyseal fixation, have a higher risk of periprosthetic
fractures, whereas the insertion of bone cement is associ-
ated with embolisation of fat and bone marrow contents
and intra-operative death, which has been referred to as
bone cement implantation syndrome.34-36 
Although catastrophic, intra-operative death is quite
rare; the rate has been reported at 0.18%.37 Even prepara-
tion of the femur, insertion of a uncemented stem and relo-
cation of the joint may induce similar, yet milder
reactions.34,38 Earlier studies comparing cemented and
uncemented stems are either of poor methodological qual-
ity or assess historical implants.39-42
Of the more recent randomised studies, five compare
modern uncemented and cemented hemiarthroplasties.
This generated six papers for review - two were consecutive
papers of the same patient cohort. As the earlier paper
reported on early complications both were included.19,43-47
The studies detected few differences regarding function or
HRQoL. The three studies with positive findings contradict
each other: in support of cemented implants, Taylor et al46
found improved functional outcomes at six weeks, and
Inngul et al47 found better function and HRQoL during the
first year. On the other hand, in support of uncemented
implants, Langslet et al19 reported improved functional
outcomes at five years, although no difference was found
regarding activities of daily living or HRQoL. Regarding
general 
complications, 
two 
studies 
reported 
no
difference43,46 but three found more complications in unce-
mented cases; mostly due to periprosthetic fractures.19,45,47
There was a shorter surgical time and decreased blood loss
in the uncemented group according to two studies.44,45 
Neither of the RCTs showed any difference in mortality
between patients treated with cemented or uncemented
stems.19,43-47
This may be due to the study groups being underpowered
to test for mortality. An Australian register study showed a
higher risk of death for patients with cemented implants on

the first post-operative day. However, the mortality risk
was higher in the uncemented group between one week and
one year post fracture.48 The Norwegian Hip Fracture Reg-
ister also found patients who had a cemented hemiarthro-
plasty had a higher risk of death on the day of surgery and
the first post-operative day. After day two, the mortality
rate was equal.49 A similar pattern was found in Finland,
where there was no difference in mortality after one
week.50
In the United Kingdom, in 2009, the National Patient
Safety Agency51 emphasised the risk of using bone cement
in hip fracture patients. However, a subsequent study from
the National Hip Fracture Database concluded there was
no increase in peri-operative mortality related to using
cemented fixation.52 There are recently published concise
guidelines in the United Kingdom, after a national collabo-
ration, to advise the anaesthetist and surgeon on measures
to reduce the risk.53 The risk of bone cement implantation
syndrome can be reduced by thorough lavage of the femo-
ral canal and avoidance of excessive pressure cementa-
tion.54,55 
The risk of peri-operative mortality must be weighed
against the risk of periprosthetic fracture. The reports and
studies of the national registers conclude that re-operations
occur more frequently after uncemented hemiarthro-
plasty.3,50,56,57 Cementless stems increase the risk of re-
operation due to periprosthetic fracture by 20 times.57 
A second fracture and subsequent surgical procedure is a
serious setback for an elderly patient.58,59 This might
explain the equivalent or even increased long-term mortal-
ity following an uncemented arthroplasty for patients in the
registry studies.48-52 
Surgical approach. The choice of surgical approach will
influence the frequency and nature of complications fol-
lowing arthroplasty surgery for hip fractures. In observa-
tional studies, a direct lateral approach has been found to
reduce the risk of dislocation.57,60-64 There is only one mod-
ern RCT comparing the direct lateral and posterior
approach in hemiarthroplasty. This was a single surgeon’s
series of 216 cases, which showed no difference in the rate
of complications, pain or function.66 Based on analyses of
patients with osteoarthritis, the posterior approach is
assumed to be beneficial regarding muscular function and
gait.65 This is, however, not supported by Parker’s RCT
regarding fracture cases. Pronounced pre-fracture func-
tional limitations in frail hip fracture patients may out-
weigh more the subtle differences between approaches.
The posterior approach may decrease the risk of long-
term aseptic loosening after THA in both osteoarthritis and
hip fracture patients.64,67 Analyses on the effect of
approach and loosening in patients following hemiarthro-
plasty are lacking. This may be due to the high mortality
after hip fracture, reducing the time available for sympto-
matic aseptic loosening to develop.
Dislocation is an early and common complication fol-
lowing hemiarthroplasty, occurring in 9% to 13% of
patients with the posterior approach compared with 2% to
3% with the direct lateral approach.60,63 A cohort study of
713 THA, in which the approaches were determined by the
surgeons’ preferences, found the rate of dislocation was 2%
with the direct lateral approach but 12% with the posterior
approach with a posterior repair, 14% without a posterior
repair. The posterior approach was the only factor associ-
ated with an increased risk of dislocation.61 Recurrent dis-
location is a particularly devastating complication which
results in a loss of HRQoL.68 
Given the seriousness of recurrent dislocations and its
early occurrence, the direct lateral approach is preferable.
Some centres are continuing with the posterior
approach, but use a dual mobility acetabular component to
reduce the risk of dislocation. The implant is sparsely stud-
ied in hip fracture cases, but three trials found the disloca-
tion rate after posterior approach to be reduced to 0%, 4%
and 6%, respectively.69-71 This looks promising, but the evi-
dence level is poor in these studies and the long-term results
of dual mobility acetabular components in fracture patients
are not known. 
Unipolar or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The large metal head
of a hemiarthroplasty prosthesis risks erosion of the acetab-
ular cartilage, as it articulates with the native acetabulum.
In order to reduce this risk, a bipolar head was developed in
the 1970s which consists of an inner and an outer articula-
tion. 
Several RCTs have tried to determine whether bipolar or
unipolar hemiarthroplasties should be used. A meta-analy-
sis found similar surgical and patient reported outcomes for
both.72 
Register studies contradict on this issue; in Sweden there
is a higher risk of early re-operation following bipolar
hemiarthroplasty compared with unipolar.57 The Austral-
ian National Joint Replacement Registry found that bipolar
prostheses had a decreased risk of revision than unipolar, at
least in younger patients.7 These results may be influenced
by patient selection; the typical hemiarthroplasty patient in
Australia is younger than in Sweden. When active patients
are treated with unipolar hemiarthroplasty, erosion may be
frequent.21 This complication might also remain unde-
tected in the elderly patient due to their more sedentary life.
There is weak evidence that bipolar heads decrease the risk
of acetabular erosion.18,57 
As there are no clear clinical advantages for the more
expensive bipolar implant, unipolar implants may pre-
ferred, at least for those with a shorter life expectancy. If the
use of THA continues to increase, the role for bipolar hemi-
arthroplasty will decrease. 
Unipolar hemiarthroplasty – modular or monoblock. The
inferior clinical results of the uncemented, monoblock
Austin-Moore implant are well known.73-77 However, in
2011, the British National Hip Fracture Database reported
the use of ‘‘uncemented, uncoated unipolar hemiarthro-
plasties’’ in 19% of patients78 (more recent reports have less
implant specific detail). It can be assumed that several of

295
VOL. 98-B, No. 3, MARCH 2016
these were Austin-Moore implants as the use of monoblock
prostheses in the United Kingdom was widespread.79
The assessment of the Thompson prosthesis, also a
monoblock design, is more complex. In the United King-
dom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidelines1 have advised against the use of the
Thompson and similar monoblock prostheses. However,
the Annual Reports from the Australian National Joint
Replacement Register show that Thompson prostheses give
better clinical results than the Austin-Moore. This may be
attributable to the use of cement7 and recent studies have
defended its use in selected patient groups.80,81 In very
elderly patients with limited mobility, it seems reasonable
that subtle design differences between cemented modular
and monoblock hemiarthroplasty prostheses may not be
clinically detectable, providing the implants are inserted via
a direct lateral approach.63 The short remaining life-span of
these patients precludes the development of long-term com-
plications such as acetabular erosion. 
Patients with severe cognitive impairment. Historically,
senile dementia was regarded as a contraindication for
arthroplasty, due to concerns of an increased risk of dislo-
cation. In addition, the patient's inability to express pain
and discomfort may have been interpreted as an absence of
pain, however, there is no reason to believe that an
unhealed fracture should be less painful in an individual
with dementia. Leaving a cognitively impaired patient
immobile after a hip fracture increases their demand for
care and assistance. A RCT comprising individuals with
severe cognitive impairment showed a modular unipolar
hemiarthroplasty to be beneficial over internal fixation.82
In an earlier study on a similar patient group, uncemented
Austin-Moore hemiarthroplasty did not generate better
results than internal fixation.83 
Discussion
In conclusion, the various combinations of implants,
approaches and patient heterogeneity lead to considerable
variations in outcome. It also presents problems for direct
comparison between studies. The evidence supports the
concept that healthy active patients with a fractured neck of
femur and a good life expectancy should be treated with a
cemented THA. In younger patients, around 60 to 65 years
of age, internal fixation may be an acceptable alternative, if
performed with thorough follow-up and the understanding
that a secondary THA may be required (Fig. 3). At the
opposite end of the spectrum, a patient with functional and/
or cognitive impairment and more severe comorbidities will
do well with a cemented, modular, unipolar hemiarthro-
plasty. The direct lateral approach is preferable to the pos-
terior approach (Fig. 2). This algorithm may not suit every
unit. Trauma surgeons may not have experience in per-
forming THA, which is technically more demanding fol-
lowing 
hip 
fracture; 
in 
their 
hands, 
a 
bipolar
hemiarthroplasty may be more appropriate.84 As some cen-
tres only perform uncemented THAs, they may not have
enough experience in efficient cementing techniques; con-
tinuing professional development is essential. The use of
different approaches also varies between countries.
Changes to accepted practice may be met with scepticism,
but can be made with the appropriate training and produce
good results.85 
For accountable high-quality outcomes, a clear-cut algo-
rithm and structured training is mandatory.86 Other key-
stones for a successful result after the treatment of hip
fracture; the prevention of general complications and opti-
misation of long-term rehabilitation, are topics worthy of
their own reviews.
