Abstract
Background: Context matters for the successful implementation of medical interventions, but its role remains
surprisingly understudied. Against the backdrop of antimicrobial resistance, a global health priority, we investigated
the introduction of a rapid diagnostic biomarker test (C-reactive protein, or CRP) to guide antibiotic prescriptions in
outpatient settings and asked, “Which factors account for cross-country variations in the effectiveness of CRP biomarker
test interventions?”
Methods: We conducted a cross-case comparison of CRP point-of-care test trials across Yangon (Myanmar), Chiang Rai
(Thailand), and Hanoi (Vietnam). Cross-sectional qualitative data were originally collected as part of each clinical trial to
broaden their evidence base and help explain their respective results. We synthesised these data and developed a
large qualitative data set comprising 130 interview and focus group participants (healthcare workers and patients) and
nearly one million words worth of transcripts and interview notes. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify
contextual factors and compare them across the three case studies. As clinical trial outcomes, we considered patients’
and healthcare workers’ adherence to the biomarker test results, and patient exclusion to gauge the potential “impact”
of CRP point-of-care testing on the population level.
Results: We identified three principal domains of contextual influences on intervention effectiveness. First, perceived
risks from infectious diseases influenced the adherence of the clinical users (nurses, doctors). Second, the health system
context related to all three intervention outcomes (via the health policy and antibiotic policy environment, and via
health system structures and the ensuing utilisation patterns). Third, the demand-side context influenced the patient
adherence to CRP point-of-care tests and exclusion from the intervention through variations in local healthcare-seeking
behaviours, popular conceptions of illness and medicine, and the resulting utilisation of the health system.
Conclusions: Our study underscored the importance of contextual variation for the interpretation of clinical trial
findings. Further research should investigate the range and magnitude of contextual effects on trial outcomes through
meta-analyses of large sets of clinical trials. For this to be possible, clinical trials should collect qualitative and
quantitative contextual information for instance on their disease, health system, and demand-side environment.

Background
“Context is key” [1] in medical interventions because it
“interacts, influences, modifies and facilitates or constrains
the intervention and the implementation effort” [2]. Con-
textual factors involve for instance patient characteristics,
the political environment, organisational cultures, or the
relationship between patients and healthcare staff [3–5],
and we should expect them to influence the full spectrum
of simple, pragmatic, and complex clinical trials, consider-
ing the extremely diverse health systems, socio-economic
settings, and epidemiological environments across and
within low-income, middle-income, and high-income
countries [3, 5–11]. Researchers call for more research in
this area because a better understanding of contextual fac-
tors can help to improve the implementation and oper-
ation of medical interventions [1, 2, 7].
Despite their importance, contextual factors in clinical
interventions are surprisingly under-researched [12, 13].
Statistical analysis can help detect the presence of context-
ual influences on trial outcomes [7, 14]; qualitative re-
search can shed further light on the nature and underlying
mechanisms of these influences [5, 10, 15, 16]. Among the
few examples is Reynolds et al. [6], who compiled qualita-
tive data from nine trials of malaria diagnostics and treat-
ment
across
seven
low-income
and
middle-income
countries (LMICs) to study real-life implementation pro-
cesses (e.g. communication between sub-study teams) and
their implications for trial data interpretation.
The present study contributed to this narrow yet essen-
tial body of knowledge through a qualitative cross-case
comparison of three diagnostic biomarker test trials in
Southeast Asia. The objective of this paper was to illumin-
ate how the trial context influenced the implementation
and operation of medical interventions. Our definition of
context followed Damschroder et al. [4] as: “the set of cir-
cumstances or unique factors that surround a particular
implementation effort.”
Our study was situated against the backdrop of anti-
microbial resistance (AMR). AMR is a global health pri-
ority that is feared to cause 10 million deaths annually
by 2050 [17], the economic costs of which have been lik-
ened to the 2008 global financial crisis with a dispropor-
tionate impact on LMICs [18–21]. Yet, AMR is a global
problem affecting also high-income countries, as can be
seen in a recent case of multi-drug-resistant Neisseria
gonorrhoeae originating in Southeast Asia that had been
detected in the UK [22]. Among the many factors that
contribute to AMR is the over-use and misuse of antibi-
otics especially for non-bacterial infections [19, 20, 23].
Across low-income, middle-income, and high-income
countries, such over-use has been attributed partially to
antibiotic over-prescription [23–26]. Various interven-
tions are therefore being explored to change prescription
patterns [25, 27], among which diagnostic technologies
to improve the behaviour of prescribers of antibiotics
have received particular attention [28–31].
This study focused on one such diagnostic technology,
namely
a
point-of-care
finger-prick
blood
test
for
C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP point-of-care tests (POCTs)
had been designed to help healthcare staff at the primary-
care level to distinguish bacterial from non-bacterial infec-
tions [32, 33]. They had been evaluated in high-income
countries [34–36], but LMICs are particularly interesting
settings for CRP POCTs for two main reasons: (1) the
widespread over-use of antibiotics alongside the higher risk
of under-treating potentially severe bacterial infections and
(2) the frequent absence of state-of-the-art laboratory facil-
ities at the primary-care level [37, 38].
We situated our study within large-scale clinical trials of
CRP
POCTs
in
Yangon
(Myanmar),
Chiang
Rai
(Thailand), and Hanoi (Vietnam). The purpose of this
paper was not to ascertain whether these CRP POCTs
met their objectives (which we report elsewhere [39]), but
rather to understand how a standardised intervention -
implemented with similar trial design and outcome meas-
urement in 20 primary-care sites of three Southeast Asian
countries - could yield heterogeneous outcomes. For ex-
ample, while overall prescriptions of antibiotics decreased
in the clinical trials, there were variable and often high de-
grees of prescribing in patients with a negative test result
(i.e. no antibiotic recommended). Healthcare workers
(HCWs)’ adherence to a negative test result was 78% on
average in Thailand, 81% in Myanmar, and 65% in
Vietnam. In the case of Vietnam, these rates varied from
29% to 96% across the participating sites (based on re-
ported immediate prescriptions [39]).
We collected a wealth of qualitative data alongside the
clinical trials to contextualise such heterogeneous study
outcomes. We drew in this paper exclusively on these
qualitative data to answer the question: “Which factors
account for cross-country variations in the effectiveness
of CRP biomarker test interventions?” Covering nearly
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111

 one million words worth of transcripts and interview
notes from 130 respondents, the extent and granularity of
our qualitative data allowed us to carry out a cross-case
comparison using thematic analysis [40] and contribute
an original perspective to the understanding of contextual
factors in clinical interventions. We thereby also contrib-
uted to the qualitative research of CRP POCT, which had
thus far only involved single-case studies in high-income
settings [41, 42].
Methods
Study design
The CRP POCT trials were situated in Southeast Asia,
which is deemed a global AMR epicentre due to wide-
spread unregulated antibiotic use in humans and animals
[43–45].
The
qualitative
data
were
collected
in
a
cross-sectional design as part of the clinical trials, in-
volving participating HCWs and patients (see Table 1 for
an overview of the clinical trials). The initial intention of
this qualitative data collection was to broaden the evi-
dence base and help explain the results of each clinical
trial individually [46]. More specifically, the objective of
the qualitative data collection in Chiang Rai and Yangon
was to contextualise the CRP POCT: “within an existing
system of practices at the patient–health system inter-
face” [47]; the Hanoi data were collected to “assess the
acceptance of CRP [point-of-care] testing to reduce in-
appropriate antimicrobial use for self-limiting [acute re-
spiratory
infections]
among
patients
[including
guardians of child patients] and HCWs in Vietnam”
[48]. Although the initial intention of the qualitative data
collection was not to carry out a cross-case comparison,
the qualitative data sets contained extensive and com-
patible context-related information (e.g. patients’ con-
ceptions
of
illness,
HCWs’
perceptions
of
patient
expectations) that enabled a secondary analysis across
the three trial case studies. We therefore synthesised the
qualitative data from the three trials and compiled a
large qualitative data set, using inductive thematic ana-
lysis (i.e. without predefined themes) to identify factors
that accounted for cross-case variation in the effective-
ness of the CRP POCT trials [49].
The target populations for the clinical trial in Hanoi
were patients with non-severe acute respiratory infections,
which represented a group of particularly high (and poten-
tially ineffectual) antibiotic use in Vietnam [50]. The trials
in Chiang Rai and Yangon focused on febrile patients,
considering the regional endemicity of malaria alongside
the limited range of diagnostic aides to guide treatment
for undifferentiated fevers [32]. These target groups are
comparable in their clinical presentation and represent
the commonest causes of attendance in primary care. The
target samples of the clinical trials involved 1200 patients
each in Chiang Rai and Yangon and 2000 in Hanoi, each
comprising 50% adults and 50% children (4446 trial par-
ticipants were recruited in total). As part of the consent
process, all trial patients were provided with brief infor-
mation in the local language about the role of antibiotics
and the risk of antibiotic resistance.
The clinical trials assessed the effectiveness of a CRP
POCT on reducing antibiotic prescriptions at urban,
peri-urban, and rural primary-care-level healthcare facil-
ities. As a diagnostic tool, CRP indicates whether a pa-
tient is likely to have a bacterial infection, and the CRP
POCT was intended to discourage HCWs from prescrib-
ing an antibiotic below a certain threshold that indicated
the absence of bacterial infections (10 and 20 mg/L in
children and adults in Hanoi, respectively; and two inter-
vention arms using 20 and 40 mg/L thresholds in Chiang
Rai and Yangon). The CRP POCT was administered as a
finger-prick blood test, and a reader device (NycoCard
II® reader) reported CRP levels within 5 min (for a more
detailed description of the process, see [47]). The partici-

 comprised public health centres staffed with nurse prac-
titioners and public health technical officers. In Yangon,
the outpatient department of a government hospital and
clinics run by a local non-governmental organisation
were staffed with medical doctors, and so were the pub-
lic health centres and the public district hospital in
Hanoi. Healthcare staff in all three sites received the
CRP POCT results from dedicated study staff, namely
study nurses in Chiang Rai and study doctors in Yangon
and Hanoi. The HCWs would then use the CRP POCT
results to complement their clinical judgement.
Qualitative data collection
The qualitative sampling strategies and the ensuing sam-
ples are summarised in Table 2. In Chiang Rai, all par-
ticipating HCWs were recruited, whereas the Yangon
and Hanoi studies sampled at least one HCW from each
participating site depending on their experience with the
CRP POCT and their availability. Patient sampling in
Hanoi involved a random sample of the patients in the
treatment groups (including guardians when the patients
were children), recruited successively until data satur-
ation was reached (defined as no new themes arising
from two consecutive focus group discussions/semi-
structured interviews, which can already occur after
10–12 interviews [51, 52]). In Chiang Rai and Yangon,
purposive maximum variation samples were obtained
specifically to capture differences across the target popu-
lation. The variables guiding the patient selection were
the randomised allocation to the trial group, antibiotic
prescription, sex, age, and education level. To under-
stand the intervention context more comprehensively,
the Chiang Rai and Yangon samples also included febrile
patients who did not participate in the clinical trial
(sampled through patient logs of the healthcare facil-
ities). The resulting qualitative data set involved 130 par-
ticipants
and
comprised
semi-structured
interviews
(SSIs, lasting 30–90 min) and focus group discussions
(FGDs, lasting 1–2 h).
The topics of the data collection instruments were
based on the literature around frontline HCWs, treat-
ment seeking and antibiotic use in LMICs, and rapid

guides covered similar topics, which are summarised in
Table 3 (the complete interview guides are presented in
[47, 48]). The FGDs focussed on triangulating insights
from the SSIs and therefore did not explore the topics in
the same level of depth. All interviews and discussions
were
conducted
in
the
local
languages
(Burmese,
[Northern] Thai, Vietnamese) and yielded approximately
98 h of audio-recorded material. The audio records were
transcribed and translated by the study team members
who conducted the interviews. The transcripts were
complemented with written notes describing for instance
the interview setting and non-verbal communication.
The resulting 977,000 words of written material formed
the basis of our qualitative data analysis.
Qualitative data analysis
Considering the scarcity of knowledge on contextual fac-
tors and their “subjectivity” [3], we chose an inductive the-
matic analysis approach for this cross-case comparison.
This means that we developed themes from the narratives
of patients and HCWs who were involved in the trials
(although different from a “grounded theory approach,”
this is sometimes referred to as “grounding” themes in the
qualitative data [56]; the inductive approach is opposed to
a deductive approach that would explore themes derived
from theory or the literature [49]).
The trial outcomes that we considered were (1) patient
adherence and (2) HCW (or “clinical user”) adherence to
the biomarker test results and (3) patient exclusion, to
gauge the potential “impact” of CRP point-of-care test-
ing on the population level (e.g. even if user and patient
adherence were high, the trial impact may be diminished
if the CRP POCT only reaches a small fraction of the
population). Following the process description for quali-
tative cross-case comparisons by Bazeley [40], the ana-
lysis took place in 3 stages: first, description of each
individual case study; second, identification of similar-
ities and differences of each case in relation to the trial
outcomes through pairwise comparisons; and third, in-
terpretation of key variables influencing the trial out-
comes in the three case studies.
In stage 1, all textual material was read and coded using
Nvivo 11 [57]. Codes were assigned in relation to any of
the 3 outcomes, starting with the SSI transcripts as our
primary data source, which we triangulated with FGD
transcripts (interview notes provided an overview and
contextualising information). The triangulation through
FGD transcripts involved checks of completeness and rep-
resentation of statements from the SSIs, whereby we
analysed participants’ contributions individually in the
context of the dynamic evolution of the discussion (see
[58]; this corresponds to participant-based group analysis,
as opposed to whole-group analysis [59]). In order to
ensure consistency of the coding frame across the three
case studies, this stage involved two coding rounds of all
textual material and was conducted in a single-coder ap-
proach by the lead social scientist (MJH; ambiguities in
meaning in the translated transcripts were clarified during
this stage through the local study team members NC,
NTTD, YKZ).
In stage 2, each individual case study was compared
pairwise against the remaining two cases, the similarities
and differences of which were tabulated in a cross-case
comparative matrix. After a first round of comparative
coding by the lead social scientist, the matrix was vali-
dated and amended by the local study team members who
were involved in the qualitative data collection (NC,
NTTD, YKZ), and by the team members who coordinated
the clinical trials across the three countries (TA, NTTD).
This validation process involved the critical interrogation
and challenge of the identified themes (e.g. in light of the
original-language transcripts) and the consideration of al-
ternative or omitted themes. This joint deliberation
entailed a further round of analysis of all textual material
relating to challenged or omitted themes.
In stage 3, the study team derived jointly the key
themes of the analysis, namely contextual domains, out-
comes, and the pathways linking them. In light of space
constraints, we focussed our presentation of the results
on the key themes and the cross-case comparative
matrix; an in-depth description of each individual case is
provided in Additional file 1. We further refrained in
this paper from linking quantitative outcome measures
to the qualitative themes, considering the breadth of the
latter (in statistical terms, we would have fewer observa-
tions than variables to specify the exact relationship).
Results
Figure 1 summarises the key themes of our qualitative
analysis and illustrates the pathways (depicted in green)
through which the CRP POCT trial outcomes (dark blue)
were affected by three inter-related domains of contextual
factors (light blue). The first domain was perceived infec-
tious disease risks, defined as treatment risks stemming
from the disease environment as HCWs evaluate them in
their routine practice (rather than “objective” measures of
disease burden in the local area). Second, the health sys-
tem context comprised health policies and guidelines that
governed the work of healthcare workers, and the struc-
ture of the health system. Third, the demand-side context
related to local healthcare-seeking behaviours and popular
conceptions of illness and medicine, and the resulting util-
isation of the health system among patients. We exempli-
fied the concrete manifestations of these elements across
our three case studies in Table 4 and described the main
elements in detail in the remainder of this section, struc-
tured according to the three contextual domains.

 Perceived infectious disease risks
The first contextual influence involved HCWs’ percep-
tions and fears of potentially life-threatening infections
and the extent to which they owned and managed the
associated treatment risks (e.g. through referral). A doc-
tor in Hanoi suggested for instance that antibiotic

 prescription decisions related partly to individual risks
that the clinical users (i.e. HCWs) of CRP POCT faced
in their treatment:
“If we prescribe antibiotics, we would not be blamed
for any problem the patients might have. If we don’t
prescribe antibiotics, the patients might get worse. In
this case, we would not be able to explain to their
relatives. And they would not accept our explanation.”
(Doctor, Hanoi, FGD)
Perceptions of risks may thereby correspond only par-
tially to the actual epidemiological environment. For ex-
ample, a survey in Vietnam by Minh [60] detected very
low rates of pneumonia of 1.2% among 563 outpatients
with acute respiratory infections visiting a paediatric ter-
tiary referral hospital [60]. Yet, doctors in Hanoi repeat-
edly expressed the need to protect themselves from
potentially under-treating such infectious diseases and
“co-infections of both viral and bacterial infections” by
over-prescribing (Doctor, Hanoi, SSI).
We observed similar tendencies in the Yangon clinics,
which catered especially to patients with tuberculosis
(TB) and patients with HIV and which were situated
among squatter populations with poor hygiene and en-
vironmental conditions [61, 62]. The participating doc-
tors would thus describe common risks of co-infection
and that: “If [the CRP test result is] low and [the pa-
tient’s] condition is bad, and there is bacterial infection,
what we fear most in the bacterial infection is the pneu-
monia. So for that we would give [antibiotics] even if the
CRP is low” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI). Considering the pos-
sibility of co-infection, antibiotics were also often pre-
scribed as prophylactic treatment especially in patients
whom the doctors considered to be high-risk groups
(e.g. children, malnourished patients, or those from
lower socio-economic backgrounds: “some [patients] are
very weak, so then I give antibiotics, but for patients

 with asthma or heart failure by birth, or children, I give
antibiotics even if they are not weak, because they are
more prone to infection” Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
In contrast to the experiences from Yangon and Hanoi,
respondents in Chiang Rai would only occasionally ex-
press a need for prophylactic prescriptions, considering
the different patient profiles resulting for example from
higher average wealth and access to improved sanitation
facilities (e.g. access to improved sanitation in Thailand
was 93% in 2015, compared to 78% in Vietnam and 80%
in Myanmar [63]; see Additional file 1 for details). How-
ever, when for example, pneumonia was suspected, one
nurse explained that: “mostly we’d have to refer and a
medical doctor will take care of it because that’s some-
thing quite serious” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI). Referral
mechanisms therefore mitigated the remaining risks for
the nurses when patients had low CRP but suspected
pneumonia, which underlined the role of the health policy
environment as a further determinant of the risks that
HCWs perceived when not prescribing an antibiotic.
In summary, perceived infectious disease risks under-
mined user adherence with CRP POCT insofar as they
created a fragile balance between clinical judgment and
the fear of missing a bacterial infection. Perceived infec-
tious disease risks when refusing patients antibiotics on
the basis of a negative CRP POCT could include social
pressure and adverse patient outcomes. Such situations
appeared more pronounced in Yangon and Hanoi: doctors
more commonly articulated fears of undertreating poten-
tially life-threatening infections and they owned treatment
risks to a greater extent than the nurses in Chiang Rai.
Health system context
Policy environment
The health policy environment related to three import-
ant themes in our data: (1) the supply environment of
antibiotics, (2) the range of available alternatives to anti-
biotic treatment, and (3) the characteristics of HCWs as
users of the CRP POCT.
First, the supply environment contributed to the liberty
with which HCWs could prescribe antibiotics. With the
2007 Antibiotic Smart Use campaign and the 2017–2021
National Strategic Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance,
Chiang Rai experienced a higher-level drive towards better
stewardship alongside local initiatives like stricter moni-
toring of primary-care-level antibiotic prescriptions [64–
67]. A health centre director described the situation as fol-
lows: “the policies from the ministry […] would focus [in-
creasingly] on antibiotics. […] It’s the kind of work of
which if we don’t reach the goal, our expenses or income
and things like that from that particular performance will
decrease” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI). In this strict supply en-
vironment, the CRP POCT emerged as a complementary
tool to help meet the policy requirement of lower anti-
biotic prescription.
In contrast, health policy in Myanmar and Vietnam
had hitherto focused on expanding the availability of an-
tibiotics, while existing AMR-related policies in Vietnam
had remained largely unenforced (e.g. the 2005 Drug
Law;
[45,
50,
68–70]).
One
manifestation
of
the
comparatively lax regulation was that HCWs experi-
enced no supply restrictions when prescribing antibiotics
(notwithstanding the limited spectrum of available anti-
biotics). A doctor in a non-governmental organization
(NGO) clinic in Yangon described for instance that anti-
biotics were well-stocked compared to other medicines:
“We may run out of stock for other medicines but not
the antibiotics. Because I think that according to sea-
sonal needs during these months it’s quite high and we
have a lot more consultation” (HCW, Yangon, SSI). Such
availability of antibiotics was even more pronounced in
Hanoi, where some respondents experienced a supply
glut of antibiotics to an extent that would render the
CRP POCT almost superfluous:
“100% of patients have been provided with
antibiotics as here are a lot of antimicrobials in
stock that need to be dispensed. Depending on
CRP results, I tell my patients to use the
antimicrobial immediately or keep for another
illness episode.” (Doctor, Hanoi, FGD)
In other words, adherence appeared to drop in condi-
tions of lax regulation and abundant supply.
Second, the presence and promotion of alternatives to
antibiotic prescription influenced adherence as well.
When asked whether she would prescribe antibiotics to
insistent patients, a nurse in Chiang Rai for example ex-
plained: “Sometimes I would change to herbal medicines
instead because here we have herbal medicines. Instead
of antibiotic, I can give them Fah Talai Jone [ฟ้าทะลายโจร] to
avoid their antibiotic use, I can use that technique” (Nurse,
Chiang Rai, SSI). In Chiang Rai, such alternatives were
promoted by antibiotic stewardship initiatives and comple-
mented both the strict regulatory environment and the
CRP POCT intervention (another common technique was
to defer prescription [47]). The opposite situation materia-
lised in Yangon. The participating NGO clinics (specialis-
ing in TB and sexually transmitted infections) would stock
only a narrow range of general medicine like cough sup-
pressants. This meant that doctors had to rely on antibi-
otics for want of more appropriate choices: “If we can get
other suppressants, other supported treatment, then we
wouldn’t use antibiotics
when
we hear crepitations”
(Doctor, Yangon, SSI). The limited range of non-antibiotic
medicine for general patients therefore undermined doc-
tors’ ability to adhere to a negative CRP POCT result.
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111 
Page 9 of 17
 Third, the policy environment also shaped the charac-
teristics of HCWs, for example their awareness of anti-
biotic resistance. It was common in all three contexts
for HCWs to ignore antibiotic resistance as a local prob-
lem relevant to their routine practice:
“I don’t think [antibiotic over-prescription] is a
problem in health centres. Because you need to
prescribe it anyway, it’s a principle. If you don’t, the
patients cannot get better.” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI)
“It is not the problem of my clinic. We do not have
the pressure of prescribing antibiotics.”
(Doctor, Hanoi, FGD)
“Doctors mainly have limitations [i.e. guidelines when
using antibiotics], but I think that the drug stores are
out of control. Doctors have their ethics so …”
(Doctor, Yangon, SSI)
However, the comparatively active policy environment
in Chiang Rai meant that the nurses had been widely ex-
posed to the problem through national policies (“they
want us to focus on [antibiotic] ‘Smart Use’ [a campaign
to raise awareness and reduce antibiotic use];” (Nurse,
Chiang Rai, SSI)), operational guidelines, and the media
(“a lot of us [nurses] began to use social [media] now so
that increases the knowledge for us;” (Nurse, Chiang Rai,
SSI)), while also recognising a greater degree of public
awareness (“the patients learn from the media [i.e. TV], as
well” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI)). The implementation of
the CRP POCT in this environment resonated with the
existing degree of antibiotic stewardship. We could not
discern such a link in the weaker AMR policy environ-
ments of Yangon and Hanoi. A doctor in Yangon indi-
cated for instance that, “Oh, we don’t have it here [i.e.
initiatives to reduce antibiotic use]” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
A final example of health policy context was its influ-
ence on primary-care-level antibiotic prescribers’ prior
experience
with
point-of-care
and
laboratory
tests.
Considering that only a few diagnostic technologies were
available at the primary care level in Chiang Rai
(e.g. finger-prick blood glucose testing [71]), the introduc-
tion of a novel point-of-care test was often received
favourably by the participating nurses. For example, a
nurse described that: “I check on the patients and they
would feel, like, like, ‘Our hospital [i.e. health centre] is
modern,
’ you know? […] It’s like it’s upgraded our class to
something higher, and we seem better” (Nurse, Chiang
Rai, SSI). The technological enthusiasm was not echoed in
Yangon and Hanoi, where the doctors were familiar with a
range of diagnostic testing technologies and their hospital
and specialised clinic environments offered a variety of
testing facilities and routine blood tests (“frankly speaking,
we can get X-ray and do something more informative;”
(Doctor, Yangon, SSI)). Nuanced and conservative atti-
tudes towards the intervention based on broader experi-
ences with diagnostic technologies therefore suggested a
lower degree of reliance on and adherence to the CRP
POCT in Yangon and Hanoi.
In summary, our interviews indicated a strong link be-
tween the health policy environment and HCWs’ adher-
ence
to
the
CRP
POCT
intervention.
The
policy
environment shaped the antibiotic supply environment
and the monitoring thereof, the availability of alterna-
tives to antibiotic treatment, and the characteristics of
the primary-care-level users of CRP POCT. In Chiang
Rai, this created complementary conditions for the inter-
vention and reinforced nurses’ trust in and adherence to
CRP POCT. The opposite was the case in Hanoi and
Yangon, where unrestricted antibiotic supply together
with a lax regulatory environment, limited concerns
about antibiotic resistance in HCWs’ routine practice,
and experience with a wide range of diagnostic technolo-
gies appeared to undermine adherence.
Health system structure
The primary healthcare centres hosting the Chiang Rai
trial were free of charge (except for unregistered minor-
ities) and commonly accessed by poorer segments of the
population, provided that these facilities were neither
overcrowded or out of reach [47, 72]. The Yangon study
clinics provided free healthcare as well, but were located
in poor sub-urban slums with widespread unregulated
access
to
antibiotics
and
unlabelled
medicine
sets
(so-called “drug cocktails” [61, 62, 73]). In Hanoi, the
participating clinics were commonly accessed by the
poor and people with health insurance, but the first and
cheaper
step
during
an
illness
was
typically
self-medication [48, 68]. Our qualitative analysis sug-
gested that such health system configurations influenced
patients’ adherence to CRP-POCT-based treatment, but
they also determined the population groups who were
excluded from routine access to healthcare and thus
from the intervention.
Local health system structures shaped the range of avail-
able healthcare choices for patients and thereby influenced
their adherence to CRP-POCT-based treatment. For in-
stance, patients who incurred a time-consuming and
costly visit to a primary healthcare care facility often artic-
ulated an expectation to receive some form of medication
to not leave the health facility empty-handed. This was
particularly pronounced in Chiang Rai, where patients’ re-
sponses often reflected explicit expectations for medicines
and a sense of entitlement (“I take time to go to the doc-
tor, if they don’t give [medicines] I’d be sad” (patient,
Chiang Rai, SSI)). Similar expectations were common in
Hanoi (“Some patients requested for more drugs so that
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111 
Page 10 of 17
 they would not have to come back to the clinics at next
time of being sick” (Doctor, Hanoi, FGD)), also because
health insurance coverage appeared to stimulate medicine
expectations (“I go to the clinics because my house is very
close to this clinic and medicines are covered by health in-
surance. So I don’t go to drug store because I have to pay
for medicines” (patient, Hanoi, SSI)). The patients inter-
viewed in Yangon had generic expectations of medicine
(rather than antibiotics in particular: “The unofficial un-
prescribed medicines are not helpful so we come in hopes
that medicines from here would cure us” (patient, Yangon,
SSI)), but also seemed to access informal and private
sources of medicine commonly prior to the clinic/hospital
visit (“Before [coming to this clinic], I would just take the
mixed medicines [“drug cocktails”], I didn’t go to the
clinic” (Patient, Yangon, SSI)).
The health system structure also entailed target group
heterogeneity in terms of exclusion from routine pri-
mary healthcare access, which shaped the potential
population-level impact of the intervention. For ex-
ample, a doctor in Hanoi described that: “Patients in
rural areas which are far from the hospital could not
come back for re-consultation, so [they] treated them-
selves with antibiotics at home” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
In Chiang Rai, villagers living in mountainous areas
would cite healthcare access constraints like: “If we don’t
have money, we would borrow and go buy [medicines]
near our house [rather than going to the hospital]” (pa-
tient, Chiang Rai, SSI). Also, seasonal constraints were
mentioned, with the workload around the rice harvest
meaning that: “most people would come [to the health
centre] after they’re done harvesting” (Nurse, Chiang
Rai). Access to formal healthcare (and thus to the CRP
POCT intervention) would therefore be limited, espe-
cially for poor people in rural and mountainous areas
and during harvest the season.
In short, the structure of the formal and informal health
system determined whether other healthcare providers
like pharmacies, private clinics, or even local grocery
stores could absorb patients’ demands for antibiotics. Yet,
healthcare access constraints like poverty and remoteness
led to the exclusion of parts of the relevant target groups
in all three case studies.
Demand-side factors
The third and final domain of contextual factors related
to the demand side of healthcare services, influencing
patients’ adherence to the CRP POCT and exclusion
from the intervention. Patient adherence was affected
when patients challenged the authority and decisions of
HCWs. This was especially pronounced in Chiang Rai,
where nurses rather than doctors were involved in the
clinical intervention (e.g. “they’re not doctors here [at
the health centre], they’re nurses” (patient, Chiang Rai,
SSI); versus “I have gone to hospital whenever I am ill. I
trust in doctors” (patient, Hanoi, FGD)). In addition, in
both Yangon and Chiang Rai (for which we had more
comprehensive qualitative data), patients with less for-
mal education, from lower socio-economic strata, or
with ethnic minority backgrounds would appear less as-
sertive and more compliant with HCWs’ treatment deci-
sions, stating for instance that: “I don’t have any
knowledge, so I’d take anything. I’d take whatever they
advise” (patient, Chiang Rai, SSI). Healthcare workers
echoed this observation and described these patients as
being “easy to talk to” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI) and that
they “don’t understand about medicines, so they do
accept the treatment we give” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
Based on these examples, we hypothesise that patient
adherence is higher in settings where the distance in
power between HCWs and patients is larger.
Adherence to the CRP POCT results could be further
undermined if patients’ conceptions of illness and medi-
cine were at odds with the implicit logic of the interven-
tion (viz. a conceptual distinction between bacterial and
non-bacterial causes of illness to guide antibiotic pre-
scription). With few exceptions, SSI and FGD respon-
dents
in
Hanoi
articulated
a
working
concept
of
“bacteria” and “viruses” as disease-causing agents. This
conception was less prevalent among our respondents in
Chiang Rai and Yangon, who would often link illness to
an “inflammation” of the body (Chiang Rai) or to an in-
fection with generic “germs” (Yangon). Respondents in
these two sites also had a wider range of notions of anti-
biotics, which would include “anti-inflammatory medi-
cine” (Chiang Rai), “germ killers” (Chiang Rai, Yangon),
or “pesticides” (Yangon), and some patients especially in
Yangon did not: “quite understand what germ killers [i.e.
antibiotics] are for” (patient, Yangon, SSI). As local con-
ceptions of illness and medicine in Chiang Rai and Yan-
gon more often contradicted the biomedical logic of the
CRP POCT, the information to explain the test might
have been less effective than in Hanoi. At the same time,
we observed a common pattern in Chiang Rai and Yan-
gon that patients misinterpreted and over-estimated the
capabilities of the CRP POCT as a comprehensive blood
test (e.g. the finger-prick test indicating: “[…] whether
this disease is good or bad, or if it’s very serious or not.
And we get to know what disease it is […]” (patient,
Yangon, SSI)). Ironically, this discrepancy appeared to
increase rather than undermine patient adherence (see
[47, 73] for more discussion on this point).
Local conceptions of illness and medicine also affected
exclusion from the CRP POCT: first, local approaches to
self-treatment with antibiotics were common in all three
sites, and they could potentially involve strategies as
elaborate as described by a patient in Hanoi:
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111 
Page 11 of 17
 “Sometimes I give [my daughter] ampi [ampicillin],
small capsule. After replacing it by cefexim,
I found [the treatment] better. Since then, I often
treat her with cefixim at home, normally for 3-5
days. If she doesn’t have fever, I will treat her at
home or buy medicines from [the] drug store.”
(Patient, Hanoi, SSI)
While
self-treatment
with
antibiotics
was
shaped
partly by local conceptions of illnesses and their corre-
sponding remedies, it was also an expression of barriers
to accessing healthcare: “If [the patients] are really a hill
tribe member, I don’t see them participate [in the trial], I
don’t think. Because it’s hard for them to come down
[from the mountain], something like that. It’s hard, it’s
inconvenient” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI)
Second, a mismatch emerged in Chiang Rai and Yan-
gon between patients’ expectations about antibiotics and
the focal condition of the test: neither patients nor
HCWs would commonly demand antibiotic treatment
for a fever, unless accompanied by other symptoms (see
[71] for an analysis of administrative primary-care-level
data from Chiang Rai):
“Anti... anti-inflammatory [i.e. antibiotic]; if they have
a fever only—fever or cold—I wouldn’t prescribe
[an antibiotic]” (Nurse, Chiang Rai, SSI).
Question (Q): “Right. And when you have a fever, do
you normally take anti-inflammatory [i.e. antibiotic]?”
Response (R): “For just fever, no, only Para.”
Q: “There has to be a sore throat.”
R: “Yes, if there’s an irritation, I’d take it right away.”
(patient, Chiang Rai, SSI).
“Here they don’t ask for germ killers [i.e. antibiotics].
Because people that come here don’t have much
knowledge, they might not even know that what they
are taking are germ killers.” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
“I don’t take medicine [for a fever]. I usually have a
sponge bath, if I have doubts [that I have fever], I take
a sponge bath. I don’t usually take medicine.”
(patient, Yangon, SSI).
Owing to the incongruency between fever and anti-
biotic demand, a doctor in Yangon reflected that: “I
don’t think that it [i.e. CRP POCT] can change much
the amount of antibiotics [on the clinic level] based on
whether or not to give antibiotics to those 5 or 10
people [out of 200 patients/day]” (Doctor, Yangon, SSI).
In summary, a smaller distance in power between
HCWs and patients and discrepancies between the inter-
vention logic and the local conceptions of the target
population appeared to undermine patients’ adherence
to the CRP POCT results. In addition, incongruencies
between local forms of antibiotic use and the disease/
healthcare provider focus of the CRP POCT intervention
could diminish the potential overall impact at the popu-
lation level.
Discussion
Summary
The objective of this paper was to contribute to the un-
derstanding of how contextual factors influence the im-
plementation and operation of medical interventions.
We compared three case studies of CRP POCT trials in-
volving qualitative research with 130 healthcare workers
and patients across Yangon (Myanmar), Chiang Rai
(Thailand),
and
Hanoi
(Vietnam).
The
qualitative
cross-case comparison demonstrated how perceived in-
fectious disease risks, health system factors, and the
demand-side context systematically influenced clinical
trial outcomes (adherence of HCWs and patients to the
test results, and target group exclusion from the clinical
trial). From a HCW perspective, less pronounced fears
of undertreating infectious diseases by withholding anti-
biotics, stricter prescription monitoring, and the promo-
tion of alternatives to antibiotic treatment appeared to
reinforce adherence to the CRP POCT in Chiang Rai.
The opposite was the case in Yangon and Hanoi, where
absent or unenforced AMR policies appeared to under-
mine compliance. Patient adherence to CRP-POCT-based
treatment was affected positively in Yangon and Chiang
Rai, where patients tended to interpret the CRP POCT as
a comprehensive blood test and therefore had a higher de-
gree of trust in the intervention. A final example was the
disease focus of the trial, which did not correspond closely
with expectations about antibiotic treatment among doc-
tors and patients in Chiang Rai and Yangon. This mis-
match may have entailed a relatively higher degree of
exclusion of antibiotic users among the target population
compared to Hanoi.
Implications
The documented variation in contextual factors demon-
strated how similar clinical trials operated differently
across countries and different parts of their target popu-
lations. The operational variations could influence the
interpretation and generalisability of trial findings. For
example, a CRP POCT trial implemented without a
complementary policy environment or out of sync with
local expectations of antibiotic use may yield less signifi-
cant findings than otherwise, which could hinder the
pursuit of further research in single-site trials unless the
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111 
Page 12 of 17
 source of the contextual impact is clear. Likewise, trial
results could appear positive yet emerge as unsustainable
in routine practice if healthcare workers reverted to their
accustomed behaviours during the workload-intensive
monsoon season.
While these implications were specific to the CRP
POCT trials, we could also distil more general lessons for
AMR-related interventions and for other clinical trials
more broadly. For AMR-related interventions, health
system factors appeared to be of fundamental importance
and echoed related social sciences research on malaria
rapid diagnostic testing in low-income and middle-income
countries. The literature has highlighted such factors as
the drug supply environment, healthcare workers’ prior
experience with diagnostic testing, or the availability of al-
ternative treatment options in case of negative test results
[14, 74, 75]. If AMR interventions failed to appreciate the
local context (e.g. the nature of the drug procurement and
monitoring systems, existing informal practices of health-
care staff), then they risk duplicating other solutions,
competing with existing practices, or producing unin-
tended consequences that potentially undermine the pur-
pose or sustainability of the intervention. The parallels
between our study and the literature on malaria therefore
underscore that interventions to manage and reduce anti-
biotic prescriptions need to respond and adapt to the local
health system context [76].
The same logic holds for the demand-side context of
AMR-related interventions. We highlighted the role of
local conceptions and how the resulting interpretations of
the CRP POCT affected patient adherence with the inter-
vention. The theme of language and the translation of sci-
entific into popular knowledge is not new and had been
raised as an issue in the field of AMR-related behaviour
change communication as well [77, 78]. Language and
popular conceptions of illness thereby emerged as an im-
portant pointer for contradictions between implicit as-
sumptions of the AMR intervention and local realities,
which our comparative case study confirmed.
These points may apply to other types of clinical trials,
although we cannot sustain this hypothesis without fur-
ther research. Nevertheless, our work did relate to fun-
damental contextual impact on clinical trials in diverse
settings. One problem is the potential disjunction be-
tween interventions’ assumptions and local realities. This
was for instance reported in the case of directly observed
therapy (DOT) as the World Health Organization’s rec-
ommended strategy for TB treatment [79, 80], which
faced numerous ethical and logistical challenges like in-
sufficient healthcare resources and insensibility to the
socio-economic constraints of patients [81–83]. Our
case study was a further example of such tension be-
tween internationally recommended guidelines for dis-
ease management and local health systems - manifest in
the often unrealistic delayed strategy of antibiotic pre-
scription for uncertain diagnoses [84].
Another element of common relevance for clinical trials
was target group heterogeneity. Our cross-case compari-
son illustrated how socio-economically disadvantaged
parts of the relevant target population behaved systematic-
ally differently from majority groups and struggled with
participation in the trial. Such situations may not be un-
common in other low-income and middle-income con-
texts, where poverty often renders health expenditure
catastrophic [85]. Our case study therefore related to
methodological arguments in the clinical trials literature
according to which the treatment effect of a trial may be
shaped by population heterogeneity and selection biases,
and average effects may not correspond to effects of the
intervention on sub-populations [86–88]. We argue that
the characteristics and behaviours of the target group are
important demand-side factors that require complemen-
tary qualitative evidence to help design and interpret clin-
ical trials within the local context.
Limitations
The main limitations of our research related to the slightly
different implementation of the clinical trials across the
three countries, to the varying depth of the qualitative
data across our field sites, and to the inductive thematic
analysis of our case studies. First, the trial implementation
differed for example in terms of the staff involved. Nurses
worked at the primary care units and dedicated study
nurses supported the clinical trial in Chiang Rai, while
doctors and dedicated study doctors participated in the
trials in Yangon and Hanoi. In Chiang Rai, the study
nurses voluntarily fulfilled other functions that helped ease
the workload at the health centres. This unintended trial
design effect (which we did not observe in the other sites)
may have increased nurses’ compliance with the trial dur-
ing peak times, ceteris paribus. The trial specifications
therefore evidently contributed to part of the variation
across our case studies. While this limited the comparabil-
ity of the trials to a certain degree, it was also partly a re-
sult of necessary local adaptation, it highlighted the
interactions between trial specifications and context [10],
and the broadly comparable interventions enabled us to
isolate contextual factors nonetheless.
Second, our themes potentially over-emphasised the
cases of Chiang Rai and Yangon, where more extensive
qualitative data were collected. However, all data sets in-
volved oral accounts from a wide array of healthcare
workers and patients, and all data were analysed by local
native speakers with knowledge of the CRP POCT trials
to provide as much depth to the interpretation as pos-
sible. Because the emerging themes applied across all
three case studies, we were confident that our analysis
uncovered relevant contextual factors.
Haenssgen et al. Trials          (2019) 20:111 
Page 13 of 17
 Third, inductive thematic analysis was chosen to iden-
tify unforeseen and locally specific factors on the basis
of our informants’ narrative accounts. This meant that
we were unlikely to produce an exhaustive list of all con-
textual factors at work in the three clinical trial case
studies - especially if our respondents did not allude to
them directly or indirectly, or if they applied equally across
Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. For example, while re-
gional and national trade policy regimes may have influ-
enced trial operations through the demand and supply of
antibiotics [89, 90], they did not emerge as a theme in the
narratives
of
patients
and
healthcare
staff.
Further
mixed-method research is therefore necessary to establish a
geographically and conceptually comprehensive knowledge
base of contextual factors affecting clinical trial outcomes.
Conclusion
Through a qualitative cross-case comparison involving the
narrative accounts of 130 respondents and nearly one mil-
lion words of transcribed material, we studied the influence
of contextual factors on the effectiveness of clinical trials
across three Southeast Asian countries. These trials of
diagnostic biomarker tests were situated against the back-
drop of antimicrobial resistance as a global health priority,
wherein our focus on low-income and middle-income
countries in Southeast Asia offered direct insights into the
realities of interventions in a global AMR epicentre. We
thus contributed essential knowledge in global health and
in an under-researched area of clinical trials.
We identified three major domains of contextual im-
pact on clinical trials - perceived infectious disease risks,
health system factors, and the demand-side context. Yet,
rather than providing a definitive list of contextual fac-
tors, our study should be understood as underscoring
the importance of contextual variation in determining
the effectiveness of clinical trials and the meaning of
their findings. Further research should investigate the
range and magnitude of contextual effects on trial out-
comes through meta-analyses of large sets of clinical tri-
als, and identify contextual variables that should be
included as covariates. For this to be possible, clinical
trials should collect further contextual information in-
cluding their disease, health system, and demand-side
environment - qualitatively and quantitatively. Ultim-
ately, this could help to develop a “toolbox” for clinical
trial designers to appraise the viability of a trial in light
of its local context, and to capture the most important
contextual factors during trial operation in order to in-
terpret and situate their findings.
