Converging evidence demonstrates that physical activity evokes a brain state characterized by distinctive changes in brain metabolism
and cortical function. Human studies have shown that physical activity leads to a generalized increase in electroencephalography power
across regions and frequencies, and a global increase in brain nonoxidative metabolism of carbohydrate substrates. This nonoxidative
consumption of carbohydrate has been hypothesized to include increased de novo synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters, especially
glutamate and GABA. Here, we conducted a series of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in human volunteers before and
after vigorous exercise (�80% of predicted maximal heart rate). Results showed that the resonance signals of both glutamate and GABA

Introduction
Vigorous physical activity is associated with several distinctive
changes in brain state. These include a shift toward excitation in
local cortical circuits (Fu et al., 2014), a generalized increase in
surface electroencephalographic (EEG) power (Crabbe and
Dishman, 2004), and a marked increase in whole-brain nonoxi-
dative carbohydrate (CHO) consumption (Rasmussen et al.,
2011). In human studies, EEG power increases following exercise
across delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequencies, and over all brain
regions studied (Crabbe and Dishman, 2004; Petruzello et al.,
2006). In mice, the excitation–inhibition balance shifts toward
excitation in visual and other sensory cortical regions, and sen-
sory cortex becomes more responsive to stimuli while running
compared with standing on a spherical treadmill (Bennett et al.,
2013; Fu et al., 2014). Cell type-specific studies suggest that these
changes result from GABAergic interneuron-mediated disinhibi-
tion of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (Fu et al., 2014).

Significance Statement
Increasing evidence suggests that distinctly different brain states are associated with sedentary behavior compared with physi-
cally active behavior. Metabolic studies show that the nonoxidative consumption of carbohydrates by the brain increases greatly
during vigorous activity. Prior studies have suggested that one component of this metabolic shift may involve increasing the
reserves of neurotransmitters in the brain via de novo synthesis from carbohydrate substrates. The current study reports the
results of three experiments that support this hypothesis by showing increased cortical content of glutamate and GABA following
physical activity. Understanding how brain metabolism and function differ during sedentary versus active behavioral states may
provide important insights into the neurotherapeutic potential of exercise.

 tently show that CHO uptake by the brain reaches unusually high
levels during physical activity and that much of the CHO taken
up by the brain during exercise is not oxidized. The metabolic fate
and function of this nonoxidized CHO uptake is not yet under-
stood (Dalsgaard et al., 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2011).
One possible explanation for increased nonoxidative brain
CHO metabolism during exercise is that CHO is consumed for de
novo synthesis of neurotransmitters (Dalsgaard et al., 2004;
Maddock et al., 2011). The most abundant neurotransmitters,
glutamate and GABA, are each readily synthesized from carbon
skeletons derived from CHO substrates, as long as a source of
amino groups is available. A recent magnetic resonance spectros-
copy (MRS) study demonstrated significantly increased MRS-
visible glutamate in the visual cortex immediately following
exercise, providing preliminary support for this hypothesis
(Maddock et al., 2011). However, this study had several limita-
tions, as follows: it measured only glutamate, it examined only
visual cortex, and it was conducted at 1.5 tesla. In addition, it was
conducted using only a relatively long echo time. Animal studies
suggest that T2 relaxation effects may render vesicular glutamate
invisible to MRS at longer echo times (Pirttila
¨ et al., 1993). Thus,
the prior result may have reflected translocation of glutamate
from the vesicular to the cytoplasmic compartment, rather than
de novo synthesis of glutamate.
The current study aims to test the hypothesis that the brain
state induced by physical activity includes an expansion of the
tissue pools of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate and
GABA. The study had the following two primary goals: (1) to
use a 3 tesla MRI system to test whether cortical GABA and glu-
tamate levels are increased following exercise; and (2) to examine
whether exercise-induced changes in glutamate are observed be-
yond primary sensory and motor cortical regions. To address
these questions, Study 1 measured exercise effects on GABA and
glutamate in primary visual cortex (V1), and Study 2 compared
exercise effects on glutamate in V1 and in the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC). A third study examined the possible role of T2
relaxation effects on MRS visibility by comparing exercise-
induced changes in V1 glutamate measured using interleaved
short and longer echo-time sequences in the same subjects. In
addition, a sedentary control study measured V1 glutamate over
time in subjects who went through all of the same procedures as
in the exercise studies, but did not exercise.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Thirty-eight healthy, normal-weight volunteers (22 females
and 16 males) participated in a series of three studies of exercise effects on
cortical glutamate or GABA levels or in a control study. Demographic
features of the subjects in each study are shown in Table 1. All subjects
gave informed consent, and underwent a screening medical interview
and electrocardiogram (EKG). Subjects were excluded if they had any
significant medical illness, history of head injury, neurological or psychi-
atric disorder, significant EKG abnormalities, or were receiving any
medication [hormonal contraceptives (N � 8) and stable thyroid re-
placement (N � 1) were permitted]. All subjects completed the Interna-
tional Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ, short form), a validated,
self-report measure of one’s physical activity during the preceding week
(Craig et al., 2003).
Exercise procedures. In Study 1, GABA was measured in V1 in eight
subjects (Table 1). Following pre-exercise MRS acquisitions, subjects
underwent graded exercise on a bicycle ergometer (model 868,
Monark) to reach a target heart rate (HR) of �80% of predicted
maximum HR (220 � age; Fox et al., 1971). HR was measured using
a heart rate monitor (Polar). Exercise began at 50–100 W and in-
creased by 25–40 W every 2–4 min depending on each subject’s fit-
ness level. For Study 1, subjects exercised until they reached their
target heart rate (8–17 min of cycling). Subjects then cycled at low
load for a final 1 min “cool-down” period before re-entering the MRI
scanner for postexercise measurements. This exercise procedure was
identical to that used in our earlier study of exercise effects on gluta-
mate (Maddock et al., 2011).
In Study 2, glutamate was measured in the ACC in eight subjects
and in V1 in eight subjects (Table 1). The exercise protocol used in
Study 1 resulted in different durations of exercise for each subject. To
remove this source of variance in the data, the duration of exercise
was standardized for Study 2. Following pre-exercise MRS acquisi-
tions, subjects in Study 2 underwent graded exercise until the target
heart rate was reached, and then exercised at constant load until the
total exercise duration reached 20 min. All subjects had a final 1 min
cool down before re-entering the MRI scanner for postexercise mea-
surements.
In Study 3, glutamate was measured in V1 using two different echo
times (30 and 144 ms) in eight subjects (Table 1). Following pre-exercise
MRS acquisitions, subjects in Study 3 underwent graded exercise, a cool-
down period, and postexercise measurements following the same proce-
dures as in Study 2.
In the control study, glutamate was measured in V1 in six subjects
following all of the same procedures as in Study 2, except that subjects
sat on the ergometer for 20 min without pedaling (Table 1).
MRS procedures. For Study 1, MRS data were acquired with a Sie-
mens TIM Trio 3 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) System using
a 32-channel, phased-array head coil. The scanning session began
with a three-view, T1-weighted, localizer image, followed by an
MPRAGE acquisition for voxel localization (resolution, 0.86 mm iso-
tropic; 192 slices; flip angle, 7°; TE � 4.81 ms; TR � 2160 ms).
Following automated second-order shimming, single-voxel pre-
exercise proton MRS data were acquired from a 3 � 2.5 � 2.5 cm
voxel placed bilaterally over the calcarine sulcus in the primary visual
cortex, with its posterior border 7 mm anterior to the dura at its
nearest point (Fig. 1). Since our primary goal in Study 1 was to test for
exercise-induced increases in GABA, spectra were acquired with a
Mescher–Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS)
GABA editing sequence with weak water suppression (Mescher et al.,
1998). This single-voxel J-difference spectral editing sequence ac-
quired interleaved edited and unedited spectra with the following
parameters: TR � 1500 ms; TE � 68 ms; number of averages � 416;
duration � 10.4 min; 8 step phase cycling; 2048 data points; 1000 Hz
receiver bandwidth; “on-resonance” edit frequency � 1.9 ppm; “off-
resonance” edit frequency � 7.5 ppm; edit pulse bandwidth � 44 Hz.
Following exercise, subjects re-entered the scanner. All of the above
MR procedures, including precise repositioning of the voxel, were

 repeated following exercise. This entailed an �14 min delay before
the postexercise MRS data collection could commence. Two 10.4 min
MEGA-PRESS acquisitions were obtained after exercise.
For Study 2, MR data were acquired with a Siemens Skyra 3 T MRI
System using a 32-channel, phased-array head coil. The scanning session
began with a localizer image followed by an MPRAGE acquisition with
the same parameters as in Study 1. Following automated, second-order
shimming, single-voxel, pre-exercise proton MRS data were acquired
from a 3 � 2.5 � 2.5 cm voxel placed either bilaterally over V1 as in Study
1, or bilaterally over the rostrodorsal ACC, with the posterior–inferior
edge of the voxel touching the dorsal surface of the genu and the line
marking the posterior quarter of the voxel aligned with the tip of the genu
(Fig. 1). Our primary aim in Study 2 was to examine the regional speci-
ficity of exercise-induced increases in amino acid neurotransmitter lev-
els. We prioritized measuring glutamate in Study 2 because glutamate is
present at much higher levels in cortex than GABA. Thus, demonstrating
increased glutamate implicates a larger neurometabolic shift than does a
similar percentage increase in GABA (Govindaraju et al., 2000; Maddock
and Buonocore, 2012). Since glutamate measurements with a PRESS
sequence are more reliable than glutamate measurements with a MEGA-
PRESS sequence in our laboratory, a PRESS sequence was used for Study
2. Eight minutes of baseline MRS data were acquired using a PRESS
sequence with weak water suppression and the following parameters:
TR � 1500 ms; TE � 144 ms; number of averages � 320; duration � 8
min; eight-step phase cycling; 1024 data points; 1200 Hz receiver band-
width. These parameters closely approximated those used in our earlier
1.5 T study of exercise effects on glutamate (Maddock et al., 2011). All
MR procedures were repeated following exercise, except that three suc-
cessive PRESS acquisitions, totaling 24 min, were obtained after exercise.
The primary aim of Study 3 was to compare the magnitude of the
exercise-induced increase in glutamate when measured at short and lon-
ger echo times. Thus, MR data were acquired with the same MR system
and procedures as for Study 2, except that MRS data were obtained using
interleaved short TE (30 ms; TE 30) and longer TE (144 ms; TE 144)
PRESS acquisitions. Specifically, PRESS acquisitions consisted of consec-
utive 2 min blocks composed of a TE 144 acquisition (three preparation
scans and 32 averages � 52.5 s), followed by a TE 30 acquisition (three
preparation scans and 32 averages � 52.5 s), followed by a TE 30 unsup-
pressed water acquisition (two preparation scans and 8 averages � 15 s).
Unsuppressed water spectra were acquired to enable eddy current cor-
rection of the TE 30 data, which is essential for spectral quality at short
echo times. The pre-exercise baseline MRS data were acquired for 10 min
(five cycles of interleaved acquisitions) and included 4.375 min of TE 144
acquisitions, 4.375 min of TE 30 acquisitions, and 1.25 min of unsup-
pressed water. The postexercise data were acquired for 24 min (12 cycles
of interleaved acquisitions) and were aggregated into three 8 min blocks,
each consisting of 3.5 min of TE 144 acquisitions, 3.5 min of TE 30
acquisitions, and 1 min of unsuppressed water.
For the sedentary control study, MR data were acquired with the same
parameters as for acquisition of V1 spectra in Study 2.
Processing of MRS data. For Study 1, GABA and creatine values were
quantified by an automated peak integration procedure using jMRUI-v4
(http://www.jmrui.eu) for phase and frequency alignment, and custom
software (available by request) for peak integration as previously de-
scribed (Yoon et al., 2010). The decision to use our peak integration
method for the primary analysis rather than curve fitting with LCModel
was based on pilot data showing lower within-subjects and between-
subjects coefficients of variation when using the former. However,
LCModel fits of the GABA resonance in the difference spectra were
also calculated using LCModel software version 6.3–1F (Provencher,
1993) and a simulated MEGA-PRESS basis set, which included n-ac-
etylaspartate (NAA), n-acetylaspartyl-glutamate, GABA, glutamate,

 glutamine, and glutathione. Macromolecules and homocarnosine con-
tribute to the signal measured as “GABA” by both of these methods.
GABA/creatine ratios (from peak integration) and GABA/NAA ratios
(from LCModel fits) were calculated for the pre-exercise baseline and the
two postexercise periods. As a secondary analysis, glutamate/creatine
ratios were estimated from the off-resonance spectra using LCModel
(version 6.3–1F) and a simulated PRESS basis set, which included NAA,
n-acetylaspartyl-glutamate, creatine, phosphocreatine, phosphocholine,
glycerophosphocholine, glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, scyllo-
inositol, glutathione, and taurine. The decision to use the off-resonance
spectra for glutamate rather than the coedited glutamate and glutamine
(Glx) peak from the difference spectra was based on pilot data showing
that the former correlated more reliably than the latter with glutamate
values obtained by LCModel fits of conventional PRESS acquisitions
from the same voxel.
For Study 2, spectra were processed and metabolite values were quan-
tified using the same LCModel version and basis set molecules as in the
glutamate analysis of Study 1, except that the basis set reflected the ac-
quisition parameters used in Study 2. Glutamate and other metabolite
values were normalized to creatine for statistical analysis.
For Study 3, spectral data from the TE 144 acquisitions were analyzed
as described for Study 2. The TE 30 acquisitions were analyzed with the
same version of LCModel, but incorporated the unsuppressed water
spectra for eddy current correction and a canonical basis set for TE
30 spectra that included the following additional resonances present at
the shorter echo time: aspartate, GABA, and glucose. Glutamate and
other metabolite values were normalized to creatine for statistical
analysis. For a secondary analysis, glutamate/water ratios were calcu-
lated for the TE 30 data.
For the control study, glutamate and other metabolite values were
quantified using the same procedures as for Study 2.
Statistical analysis. In our prior 1.5 T MRS study of exercise, the com-
bined signal from Glx was significantly increased during the first postex-
ercise measurement (effect size d � 0.94) but not during subsequent
measurements (effect sizes, all �0.18; Maddock et al., 2011). Thus, our
planned comparisons for each study targeted the changes from pre-
exercise to the first postexercise measurement (“pre-post exercise”).
Changes occurring at later postexercise measurements or in other me-
tabolites were examined for descriptive purposes. Because vigorous ex-
ercise leads to sweating and other shifts in water homeostasis, we
normalized metabolite values to creatine rather than water for the pri-
mary analyses.
For Study 1, a repeated-measures ANOVA over the three time points
was conducted, followed by the planned comparison of pre-exercise and
first postexercise GABA/creatine ratios by paired t test. Similar analyses
were conducted for the glutamate/creatine ratios. A Bonferroni correc-
tion for testing these two metabolites was applied. Parallel secondary
analyses were performed for other metabolite ratios and for the second
postexercise GABA and glutamate values. For Study 2, we first conducted
a 2 � 2 mixed-model ANOVA of glutamate/creatine ratios with region
(V1 and ACC) as a between-subjects factor and the four time points as
the within-subjects factor. This was followed by the planned comparison
ANOVA restricted to the pre-exercise and first postexercise measure-
ments. Parallel secondary analyses were performed for other metabolite
ratios. Paired t tests were used to examine exercise effects on glutamate
within each brain region and glutamate changes at later time points after
exercise. For Study 3, a repeated-measures ANOVA with both TE (30 and
144 ms) and time (four time points) as within-subjects factors was used
to test for an interaction between echo time and exercise effects on glu-
tamate. This was followed by the planned comparison ANOVA restricted
to the pre-exercise and first postexercise measurements. Paired t tests
were used to examine exercise effects on glutamate within each TE con-
dition and effects at later time points after exercise. Parallel secondary
analyses were performed for other metabolite ratios. For the control
study, a repeated-measures ANOVA over the four time points was con-
ducted, followed by a paired t test for the planned comparison of gluta-
mate/creatine ratios at baseline and during the first acquisition obtained
after sitting on the ergometer without exercising. The �-statistic was set
to 0.05 (one-tailed) for paired t tests used with planned comparisons for
our directional hypotheses. The �-statistic was set to 0.05 (two tailed) for
ANOVAs, correlations, and other exploratory analyses.
Results
Participant characteristics and exercise-related variables for all
studies are shown in Table 1. Subjects for all studies had normal
body mass index values. IPAQ scores categorized 74% of subjects
as having “high” levels of physical activity in the last week, 21% as
“moderate,” and 5% as “low.” Example spectra for each study are
shown in Figure 1. The GABA/creatine ratio and/or glutamate/
creatine ratio at baseline and during the first postexercise period
for each study are shown in Table 2. The time courses of the
percentage change in glutamate/creatine and GABA/creatine ra-
tios for each study are shown in Figure 2.
Study 1—exercise effects on V1 GABA measured with
MEGA-PRESS
Subjects in Study 1 exercised for an average of 11.5 min (range,
8–17 min) and achieved an average maximum heart rate that
was 85.5% of their predicted maximum heart rate (Table 1).
Repeated-measures ANOVA of the GABA/creatine ratio showed
a significant main effect of time (F(2,14) � 8.64, p � 0.004). The
V1 GABA/creatine ratio was significantly greater during the first
postexercise measurement compared with the pre-exercise mea-
surement (paired t(7) � 3.82, p � 0.003; Table 2). This effect
survived the Bonferroni correction that was applied to account
for also testing the change in glutamate levels. By the second
postexercise measurement, the GABA/creatine ratio no longer
differed from the baseline level (paired t(7) � 0.76, NS) and had
decreased from the first postexercise measurement (paired t(7) �
4.63, p � 0.001; Fig. 2).
A parallel secondary analysis using LCModel fits of the edited
GABA resonance in the difference spectra yielded similar results.

2.72, p � 0.03). The mean SNR for the off-
resonance spectra was 43, and the mean
CRLB for glutamate was 6.7 (range, 5–10).
The mean � SD for the line width of each
acquisition was 0.046 � 0.009 ppm. Four
other metabolite resonances from the
off-resonance spectra were quantified by
LCModel, with CRLBs all �7 for each ac-
quisition in each subject, including NAA,
choline-containing compounds (choline),
myo-inositol (inositol), and creatine plus
phosphocreatine (creatine). CRLBs were
not consistently �20 for any other metabo-
lites. Parallel exploratory analyses showed
no significant changes in NAA/creatine,
choline/creatine, inositol/creatine, or the
absolute (non-normalized) creatine signal
from baseline to the first postexercise mea-
surement (all t(7) � 0.92, NS).

 tion were all �8 (mean � 5.7, SD � 1.3). The mean � SD for the
line width of each acquisition was 0.049 � 0.012 ppm. The CRLB
and line width were similar in the two brain regions examined
(V1 and ACC). The mean � SD for the SNR of each acquisition
was 40.8 � 5.1 in V1 and 29.0 � 5.3 in ACC.
A mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA showed a signif-
icant main effect for time (F(3,42) � 9.39, p � 0.0001) and for
region (F(1,14) � 40.0, p � 0.0001), but no significant interaction
(F(3,42) � 0.70, NS). The planned comparison of the pre-exercise
versus first postexercise times in the two brain regions showed a
significant increase in glutamate/creatine ratios across both brain
regions, and no interaction with region (Table 2). The increase in
glutamate/creatine ratio after exercise was significant within each
region considered separately (ACC: paired t(7) � 4.27, p � 0.002;
V1: paired t(7) � 2.81, p � 0.013). The glutamate/creatine ratio
remained significantly elevated during the second and third
postexercise measurements in the ACC (t(7) � 2.21, p � 0.031,
and t(7) � 3.21, p � 0.008, respectively) but not in V1 (t(7) � 1.63,
p � 0.074, and t(7) � 1.03, NS, respectively; Fig. 2).
Four other metabolite resonances were quantified by
LCModel with CRLBs for each acquisition in each subject all �6,
including NAA, choline, inositol, and total creatine. CRLBs were
not consistently �20 for any other metabolite resonances. We
conducted parallel exploratory analyses of the effects of exercise
on these four metabolites. There was a significant main effect of
pre-post exercise on NAA/creatine, which increased from base-
line to the first postexercise measurement (1.748 � 0.34 and
1.794 �.31, respectively; F(1,14) � 5.16, p � 0.039). There was a
borderline significant main effect of pre-post exercise on inositol/
creatine, which tended to decrease from baseline to the first
postexercise measurement (0.873 � 0.124 and 0.831 � 0.115,
respectively; F(1,14) � 4.35, p � 0.056). There was no effect of
pre-post exercise for choline or absolute creatine (both F(1,7) �
0.44, NS). There were significant main effects for region for all
four metabolites, but no region by pre-post exercise interactions.
Study 3—exercise effects on V1 glutamate measured at TE 30
and TE 144
Ten subjects were enrolled in Study 3, generating usable data
from eight subjects. One subject’s TE 144 data were lost due to
technical error, and one subject fell asleep during the postexer-
cise measurements. Both of these subjects’ data were excluded
from the analysis. In Study 3, subjects exercised for 20 min and
achieved an average maximum heart rate that was 89.3% of their
predicted maximum (Table 1). The CRLBs for glutamate from
each acquisition were all �10 (mean � 6.0, SD � 1.3). The
mean � SD for the line width of all acquisitions was 0.043 �
0.006 ppm. The CRLB and line width were similar for the two
echo times used. The mean � SD for the SNR of each acquisition
was 47.5 � 5.7 with TE 30 and 39.5 � 3.3 with TE 144.
The primary aim of Study 3 was to test for an interaction
between exercise effects and echo time. A repeated-measures
ANOVA showed no significant interaction between TE and time
(F(3,21) � 1.01, NS). This analysis also showed a trend toward a
main effect of time (F(3,21) � 2.97, p � 0.055) and a significant
main effect of TE (F(1,7) � 175.0, p � 0.0001). The planned com-
parison of pre-exercise versus first postexercise times across short
and long TEs showed similar results, except that the difference
between pre-exercise and first postexercise was significant across
TE values (Table 2). The increase in glutamate/creatine ratio
from pre-exercise to first postexercise was significant for each TE
considered separately (TE 30: t(7) � 2.31, p � 0.027; TE 144: t(7) �
2.15, p � 0.034). The glutamate/creatine ratio remained signifi-
cantly elevated over baseline during the second postexercise mea-
surement with both TE 30 and TE 144 (TE 30: t(7) � 3.22, p �
0.007; TE 144: t(7) � 2.12, p � 0.036), but no longer differed from
baseline by the third postexercise measurement with either TE
(TE 30: t(7) � 1.67, p � 0.070; TE 144: t(7) � 0.92, NS; Fig. 2).
Because nonsuppressed water data were collected at TE 30, we
additionally assessed the effect of exercise on glutamate/water
ratios. The glutamate/water ratio at TE 30 increased significantly
from baseline to the first postexercise measurement (t(7) � 2.54,
p � 0.019). The glutamate/water ratio remained elevated over
baseline at the second and third postexercise measurements (at
second measurement: t(7) � 3.65, p � 0.004; at third measure-
ment: t(7) � 2.22, p � 0.031).
NAA, choline, inositol, and total creatine resonances were
quantified by LCModel with CRLBs all �7 for both TE 30 and TE
144. Parallel exploratory analyses showed a borderline significant
main effect of pre-post exercise on choline/creatine, which
tended to decrease from baseline to the first postexercise mea-
surement (0.182 � 0.024 and 0.177 � 0.019, respectively; F(1,7) �
5.21, p � 0.057). The effect of pre-post exercise did not approach
significance for the other three metabolites (all F(1,7) � 1.36, NS).
There were significant main effects for TE for all four metabolites,
but no TE by pre-post exercise interactions. Two additional me-
tabolites, glutathione and taurine, were quantified with all CRLBs
�17 for TE 30 only. Neither metabolite changed significantly
from baseline to the first postexercise measurement by paired t
test. CRLBs were not consistently �20 for any other metabolites
at either echo time.
Control study—V1 glutamate before and after a sedentary
control condition
In the control study, six subjects sat on the ergometer for 20 min
without exercising. The CRLBs for glutamate were all �8
(mean � 6.5, SD � 0.8). The mean � SD for the line width of
each acquisition was 0.042 � 0.006 ppm. The mean � SD for the
SNR of each acquisition was 42.2 � 3.7. Repeated-measures
ANOVA showed no significant effect of time on glutamate/crea-
tine ratio (F(3,15) � 1.83; NS). The V1 glutamate/creatine ratio
was nonsignificantly lower during the first measurement after
sitting on the ergometer compared with the baseline measure-
ment (paired t(5) � �1.22, NS; Table 2), and continued trending
down over subsequent measurements (Fig. 2).
Exercise effects across studies
In 16 subjects across Studies 2 and 3, the effect of exercise on gluta-
mate level was measured in the same brain region (V1) using the
same exercise protocol, pulse sequence, and TE (PRESS, TE 144).
The two studies showed very similar effect sizes and percentage in-
creases in glutamate (means of the two studies � 0.77 and 5.3%,
respectively). For descriptive purposes, the mean effect size and per-
centage change in glutamate over all brain regions, exercise proto-
cols, pulse sequences, and TEs used with the 32 exercising subjects
across all three studies were 1.07% and 4.9%, respectively.
Across Studies 2, 3 and the Control Study, the baseline gluta-
mate/creatine ratio was measured in the same region (V1) with
the same sequence (PRESS, TE 144) in 22 subjects. In these sub-
jects, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the association
between physical activity in the preceding week (IPAQ score) and
resting levels of cortical glutamate. There was a significant posi-
tive correlation between these variables, both by parametric (r �
0.457, n � 22, p � 0.031) and nonparametric analyses (Spear-
man’s � � 0.524, n � 22, p � 0.016).

Maddock et al. • Exercise Increases Cortical Glutamate and GABA
 Discussion
These studies demonstrate reliably increased glutamate
content in visual and anterior cingulate cortices following
vigorous exercise. Across all studies, the percentage increase
in glutamate averaged 4.9% during the first postexercise
measurement (�18 min postexercise). Glutamate returned
toward baseline by the final measurement (�34 min postex-
ercise). In contrast, only a downward drift in glutamate was
observed in the sedentary control group. These findings ex-
tend earlier results from a 1.5 tesla study (Maddock et al.,
2011). We also demonstrate for the first time significantly
increased visual cortex GABA after exercise. No other metab-
olites changed reliably following exercise.
MRS measures the overall tissue content of glutamate and
GABA. Most brain glutamate is found in three tissue environ-
ments. The largest fraction is in the cytoplasm of neurons and
glia. Smaller fractions are in synaptic vesicles, and in glial
and neuronal mitochondria (Kauppinen et al., 1994; Waa-
gepetersen et al., 2007). Because of the potential neurotoxicity
of extracellular glutamate and its avid transport out of the
synaptic cleft, only a small fraction of brain glutamate is lo-
cated in the synaptic cleft or other extracellular spaces in
healthy brain (Waagepetersen et al., 2007). The tissue distri-
bution of GABA is probably similar, except that the largest
fraction is specifically localized to the cytoplasm of GABAergic
neurons (Waagepetersen et al., 2007). At �10 mmol/kg, glu-
tamate is the second most highly concentrated organic small
molecule in the brain (Govindaraju et al., 2000). A wide-
spread, 5% increase in cortical glutamate persisting �20 min
following exercise suggests a functionally significant change in
brain metabolism. Given the neurotoxic potential of gluta-
mate in brain extracellular fluid (ECF), our findings are un-
likely to reflect increased glutamate within the synaptic cleft or
other ECF environments. The expanded tissue content of glu-
tamate and GABA more likely reflects an adaptive shift in
intracellular metabolic processes that support increased neu-
rotransmission during physical activity.
Study 3 examined whether using a short (30 ms) versus a
longer (144 ms) TE would influence the measured change in
V1 glutamate with exercise. Several laboratories found that
�25% of total brain glutamate measured ex vivo is “invisible”
to MRS at TEs ranging from 60 to 150 ms (Bove
´e, 1991; de
Graaf et al., 1991; Kauppinen and Williams, 1991; Pirttila
¨ et
al., 1993; Kauppinen et al., 1994). Shorter TEs have not yet
been examined for glutamate visibility. Rapid T2 relaxation
within some tissue environments can cause MRS invisibility at
longer TEs. The spatially restricted and viscous internal envi-
ronment of synaptic vesicles may impose relatively rapid T2
relaxation on vesicular glutamate (Zeigler et al., 2011). Thus,
vesicular glutamate may contribute significantly to the frac-
tion of brain glutamate that is invisible to MRS at echo times
�60 ms (Pirttila
¨ et al., 1993; Kauppinen et al., 1994). If so, the
findings in Study 1 (TE 68) and Study 2 (TE 144) of increased
glutamate signal following exercise could have been caused
either by the expansion of the overall tissue pool of glutamate,
or alternatively, by net movement of glutamate from a puta-
tive invisible vesicular environment to the “visible” cytoplas-
mic environment. Assuming that vesicular glutamate is more
visible at TE � 30 ms than at TE � 144 ms, the latter scenario
predicts that the exercise-induced increase in glutamate signal
would be smaller when measured at TE 30 than when mea-
sured at TE 144. A finding of larger effects at TE 30 than at TE
144 would argue against that scenario. Study 3 found no sig-
nificant difference between the effects of exercise at TE 30 and
TE 144. This result does not allow us to clearly adjudicate
between the two explanations for exercise-induced increases
in MRS-visible glutamate, since 30 ms may not be sufficiently
short to render vesicular glutamate fully visible. Studies with
shorter TEs could resolve this question. However, we observed
a slightly larger and longer-lasting increase in glutamate signal
measured at TE 30. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis
showed that the TE 30/TE 144 ratio of glutamate signal inten-
sities increased slightly, rather than decreased, after exercise
(Cohen’s d � 0.56). While only suggestive, these patterns are
consistent with an expansion of the overall tissue pool of glu-
tamate after exercise.
A robust but poorly understood change in brain metabo-
lism during exercise has been repeatedly described in human
studies using the arteriovenous difference method. Specifi-
cally, brain uptake of glucose and lactate increases more than
the uptake of oxygen during exercise, and this metabolic un-
coupling increases with more intense exercise (Dalsgaard et
al., 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2011). The oxygen/carbohydrate
uptake ratio decreases from its usual resting value of �6 to a
nadir of �3.75 during exercise protocols similar to those we
used in Studies 2 and 3 (Ide et al., 2000; Dalsgaard et al., 2002).
During exercise, the brain takes up much more glucose and
lactate than it consumes by oxidation. A similar uncoupling of
glucose and oxygen consumption occurs in localized brain
regions during neural activation—part of the phenomenon
that enables BOLD contrast (Fox et al., 1988). As with exercise,
this activity-dependent metabolic uncoupling is accompanied
by locally increased glutamate concentration (Bednar
˘ík et al.,
2015). However, the metabolic uncoupling during exercise is
observable broadly across the brain and is more sustained.
The metabolic fate of nonoxidized carbohydrate consumed by
the brain during exercise is unknown, but it is not leaving the
brain as lactate or accumulating as lactate more than slightly
(Dalsgaard et al., 2004; Maddock et al., 2011). Glycogen
shunting, flux through the pentose–phosphate pathway, and
flux through the anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase reaction
to sustain de novo synthesis of glutamate and GABA via
�-ketoglutarate transamination have been suggested as ac-
counting for some of the missing carbohydrate (Dalsgaard et
al., 2004; Dalsgaard, 2006; Maddock et al., 2011). Based on
published oxygen/carbohydrate uptake data and metabolic
models (Ide et al., 2000; Dalsgaard et al., 2002, 2004), and
assuming glutamate and GABA increase throughout the whole
brain and derived entirely from nonoxidized carbohydrate
uptake, we estimate that the increased glutamate and GABA
levels seen in our studies can account for at most �15% of the
increased brain nonoxidized carbohydrate uptake. While in-
creased synthesis of glutamate and GABA may be one compo-
nent of increased nonoxidative carbohydrate consumption
during exercise, other significant metabolic changes must also
be involved.
Both animal and human studies report substantial changes
in cortical functioning reflecting increased neural activity as-
sociated with physical activity. A review of 18 studies showed
that EEG power increases after exercise with moderate-to-
large effect sizes across all brain regions and frequency bands
studied (Crabbe and Dishman, 2004; Petruzello et al., 2006).
Three studies of evoked potential changes after exercise ob-
served a generalized increase in P3 amplitude (Kramer and
Hillman, 2006). In mice, the cortical excitation–inhibition
Maddock et al. • Exercise Increases Cortical Glutamate and GABA
J. Neurosci., February 24, 2016 • 36(8):2449–2457 • 2455
 balance shifts toward excitation in the visual cortex, and glu-
tamatergic pyramidal neurons become more responsive to vi-
sual stimuli during running compared with sedentary activity
(Niell and Stryker, 2010; Bennett et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014).
Similarly, behavioral performance on some visual tasks im-
proves in running mice (Bennett et al., 2013). In mouse visual
cortex, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive (VIP �) GABA
ergic interneuron activity increases and somatostatin-positive
GABAergic interneuron activity decreases during physical ac-
tivity, suggesting that the former interneurons increase their
inhibition of the latter to produce a net disinhibition of glu-
tamatergic pyramidal neurons (Fu et al., 2014). Ascending
neuromodulation by both cholinergic and adrenergic circuits
mediates the increased gain of excitatory neurons in visual
cortex in running mice (Polack et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014).
The observations on brain carbohydrate metabolism, electro-
physiology, and cortical excitation–inhibition balance suggest
that the brain state associated with physical activity includes a
widespread increase in neural activation compared with the
sedentary state. The current findings suggest that this brain
state includes a metabolic shift leading to expansion of the
tissue pools of glutamate and GABA.
In addition to demonstrating acutely increased glutamate
following exercise, we found preliminary evidence that more
exercise in the preceding week predicted higher resting gluta-
mate levels. These findings may have relevance to the thera-
peutic use of exercise in neuropsychiatric conditions. For
example, glutamate is consistently reduced in frontal and lim-
bic regions (especially the ACC) during episodes of major
depression and often normalizes in association with recovery
(Yu
¨ksel and O
¨ ngu
¨r, 2010; Luykx et al., 2012; Maddock and
Buonocore, 2012). A similar pattern of findings is evident for
GABA in major depressive disorder, especially in occipital cor-
tex (Sanacora and Saricicek, 2007). Exercise appears to be an
effective treatment for some patients with major depression
(Cooney et al., 2013). Future studies could determine whether
baseline glutamate or exercise-induced glutamate responses in
the ACC have value as predictors of clinical response to exer-
cise training as a treatment for depression.
In summary, we report a consistent increase in cortical
glutamate and GABA levels following a single bout of exercise
in young, healthy, physically active volunteers. Glutamate in-
creased in both V1 and ACC. These observations add to a
growing recognition that the brain state associated with phys-
ical activity differs from that associated with sedentary states
and includes distinctive changes in brain metabolism. Future
studies may determine how these acute effects relate to longer-
term training effects and whether they are relevant to the neu-
rotherapeutic potential of exercise.
