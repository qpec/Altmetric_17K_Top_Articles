Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) caused by flesh-eating bacteria is associ-
ated with high case fatality. In an earlier study, we reported
infection of an immunocompetent individual with multiple strains
of Aeromonas hydrophila (NF1–NF4), the latter three constituted a
clonal group whereas NF1 was phylogenetically distinct. To under-
stand the complex interactions of these strains in NF pathophysi-
ology, a mouse model was used, whereby either single or mixed
A. hydrophila strains were injected intramuscularly. NF2, which
harbors exotoxin A (exoA) gene, was highly virulent when in-
jected alone, but its virulence was attenuated in the presence of
NF1 (exoA-minus). NF1 alone, although not lethal to animals, be-
came highly virulent when combined with NF2, its virulence aug-
mented by cis-exoA expression when injected alone in mice. Based
on metagenomics and microbiological analyses, it was found that, in
mixed infection, NF1 selectively disseminated to mouse peripheral
organs, whereas the other strains (NF2, NF3, and NF4) were confined
to the injection site and eventually cleared. In vitro studies showed
NF2 to be more effectively phagocytized and killed by macrophages
than NF1. NF1 inhibited growth of NF2 on solid media, but ExoA of
NF2 augmented virulence of NF1 and the presence of NF1 facilitated
clearance of NF2 from animals either by enhanced priming of host
immune system or direct killing via a contact-dependent mechanism.

N
ecrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a deadly necrotic inflammation of
skin, s.c. tissues, and muscle bundles, most frequently
caused by Streptococcus species, notably Streptococcus pyogenes,
either alone or in combination with Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staph-
ylococcus aureus, or both (1, 2). NF is classified as polymicrobial
(type-I) or monomicrobial (type-II), and type-I is more prevalent
and frequently linked to immune status of the patient (2, 3).
In recent years, type-I and type-II–associated NF caused by
Aeromonas hydrophila have been reported at an increasing rate
(4–6). These infections progress to septicemia via hematogenous
access despite aggressive antibiotic treatment (6). Recently, we
described an infection with A. hydrophila of wounds and blood-
stream of a young immunocompetent NF patient. The patient, as
a result of the infection, had to undergo several lifesaving surgical
procedures, including amputations of limbs (7). Although this case
of NF may be considered monomicrobial, because only a single
Aeromonas species was involved, genomic analysis indicated mixed
infection due to four strains representing two paraphyletic lineages
of A. hydrophila. Three of the four strains, NF2, NF3, and NF4,
exhibited minimal difference in genome sequence [12 high-quality
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] and identical genome
content and synteny (7), thus can be considered a clonal group and
are assumed to share similar pathodynamics of infection. The
fourth strain, NF1, was phylogenetically distinct and, accordingly,
differed in virulence from the other NF strains (7). It was
speculated that the presence of multiple strains of A. hydrophila
influenced disease progression and outcome significantly than if
the individual strains had been involved alone. Plausibly, necrotic
lesions were caused by A. hydrophila strains producing a variety of
toxins (8, 9) and secreted toxins of one of the NF strains may have
had an influential role in pathogenesis, in concert with the other
strains during infection. Indeed, a notable difference in the genomes
of the strains was presence of a gene, exoA, encoding exotoxin A
(ExoA), a homolog of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoA, in the ge-
nomes of NF2, NF3, and NF4, but not NF1 (7, 10). ExoA has ADP
ribosylating activity for eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2),
leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and host cell death (11).
In the present study, we provide evidence that during mixed in-
fection with NF1 and NF2, NF1 benefited by greater dissemination
induced by ExoA secreted from NF2. However, the presence of
NF1 in the infection mixture either directly and/or via host
innate immune mechanisms antagonized virulence of NF2 by
preventing its dissemination and aiding in clearing of NF2
from the injection site.
Significance
Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing fatal skin and
muscle tissue lesion. We studied a human case of NF and found
that the infection was caused by multiple strains of A. hydro-
phila (NF1–NF4). The latter three strains constitute a clonal
group, whereas NF1 is phylogenetically distinct. We tested
these strains individually in a mouse intramuscular model of
infection and observed NF1 to be less virulent than NF2.
However, when NF1 and NF2 were mixed, NF1 exhibited more
virulence and it decreased NF2 virulence. The cross-talk be-
tween NF1 and NF2 was due to the presence of ExoA toxin in
NF2, ability of NF1 and NF2 to differentially modulate innate
immune mechanism(s), and direct killing of NF2 by NF1.

 Results
Virulence of A. hydrophila NF2. To understand virulence attributes of
NF1 and NF2, an i.m. (intramuscular) model of mouse infection
was used with these strains separately. A. hydrophila NF2 exhibited
greater virulence compared with NF1, measured by animal mortality
and bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs (Fig. S1 A and B).
On day 2 p.i. (postinfection), NF2 at infection dose of 8 × 107 cfu
(colony-forming units) caused 100% animal mortality, in contrast
to an approximately sixfold higher dose of NF1 with no mortality
at 7 d (Fig. S1 A and B). All animals infected with NF2 at an
infection dose of 2 × 108 cfu showed bacterial dissemination to
both spleen and liver, at a level of 103 to 105 cfu per organ.
However, only two of five mice inoculated with NF1 yielded bac-
terial counts in the spleen and no detectable bacterial growth was
observed in the liver.
Attenuation of Virulence of A. hydrophila NF2 in the Presence of NF1.
An infection dose of 5 × 108 cfu (7) with all four strains (NF1,
NF2, NF3, and NF4; 1.25 × 108 cfu per strain) caused 100%
mortality within 24 h p.i. after i.m. injection (Fig. 1A). The same
dose (5 × 108 cfu, 2.5 × 108 cfu per strain) of NF1 and NF2
combined also resulted in 100% mortality within 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1A).
A mixed infection of NF1 and NF2 at a dose of 2 × 108 cfu (1 ×
108 cfu per strain) resulted in 100% survivability of mice, whereas an
approximately threefold lower dose caused 100% mortality when only
NF2 was injected (Fig. S1A). These data can be interpreted as NF1
modulating the virulence of NF2 in mixed culture. These results were
substantiated because after 24 h p.i., gross necrotic lesions around the
site of the i.m. injection in mice, when qualitatively scored, were mild
for NF1 infection (1+), moderate for NF1 and NF2 mixed infection
(2+), and severe for NF2 infection alone (3+) (Fig. 1B).
Selective Dissemination of A. hydrophila NF1 to Peripheral Organs in
Mixed Infection and Role of exoA Gene. A large number of strain-
specific patterns associated with NF1 is indicative of its distinct
phylogenetic lineage, compared with other three isolates, NF2,
NF3, and NF4, which form a clonal group (7). Mixed infection with
all four strains injected i.m., yielded counts of ∼105 to 107 cfu in the
spleen and liver after 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2A). Although the four NF
strains were mixed in equal ratios, it was not known whether all four
strains would disseminate similarly or differentially to peripheral
organs of mice. Therefore, we used state-of-the-art unbiased whole
genome shotgun metagenomics and GENIUS software package
(CosmosID) to detect and quantify NF strains in muscle, spleen,
and liver tissue of infected animals.
A key feature of GENIUS is the ability to incorporate new ge-
nome sequences into the database, and use the modified database
to probe metagenome datasets. The newly sequenced NF genomes
(NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4) were incorporated into the existing
bacterial database, which placed these four NF strains into the
Aeromonas clade along with other A. hydrophila strains and iden-
tified unique patterns (biomarkers) associated with each of the four
NF strains (n = 41,483, 147, 47, and 63 for NF1, NF2, NF3, and
NF4, respectively). Indeed, GENIUS analysis of metagenomic
datasets derived from muscle, spleen, and liver was able to identify
and differentially detect individual NF strains (Table S1).
Results showed that, at the site of injection in the thigh muscle of
the animals and after 24 h p.i., all or the majority of the strains
(NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4) could be detected in varying propor-
tions (Fig. 2B). Whereas strain-specific genomic biomarkers corre-
sponding to strains NF1, NF2, and NF4 were detected in all muscle
samples, NF3 was detected only in one of four muscle samples.

Virulence features of mono and mixed infections with A. hydrophila NF

NF2-lux or NF1 to NF4 mixture and animal mortality was observed over 7 d.
Asterisks denote statistical significance among the indicated groups. (B) Three to
five mice were infected with NF1, NF1 and NF2-lux mixture, or NF2-lux at 2 × 108
cfu per animal i.m. Control animals were injected with sterile PBS. After 24 h p.i.,
severity of inflammatory swelling and necrotic lesions were examined and scored.
Based on the severity of necrosis, the scale used was as follows: 0 (no necrosis,
e.g., for the PBS group), 1+ (mild necrosis, for the NF1-infected group of mice), 2+
(moderate necrosis, for the NF1 and NF2-infected group of mice), 3+ (severe
necrosis, for the NF2-infected group of mice). Representative images are shown.

mixture of NF1 to NF4 at an infection dose of 5 × 108 cfu (1.25 × 108 cfu per
strain) per animal via i.m. route. After 24 h, whole spleen and liver from each
animal were homogenized and an aliquot from each sample was subjected
to bacterial colony count. The horizontal lines represent the arithmetic
means of the bacterial counts (B). The remaining portion of the homoge-
nates was processed for total DNA isolation. The isolated DNA for some
organs representing different animals was combined because of the low
yield and was labeled as muscle35, spleen45, and/or spleen123, respectively.
The isolated DNA was subjected to deep sequencing and metagenomic
analysis to identify the NF strains. Relative distribution of four A. hydrophila
strains NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4 in different metagenomic datasets derived
from muscle, spleen, and liver samples is shown.

MICROBIOLOGY
 Surprisingly, in the spleen and liver, only NF1-specific genomic
signatures were detected, with no reads corresponding to NF2, NF3,
or NF4, although a mixture of the four strains had been injected i.m.
These data suggested that the bacteria in the spleen and liver of
mice were only NF1 (Fig. 2A).
NF1 mixed with NF2, NF3, and NF4 or just with NF2 resulted
in only NF1 migrating to the peripheral organs of the mice after
i.m. injection. Antibiotic selection and expression of the luciferase
gene (lux) in NF1-lux or NF2-lux confirmed the bacterial colonies
recovered from the spleen and liver of mice injected in the mixed
infection experiments were solely NF1 (Fig. S2 A and B), vali-
dating the finding of GENIUS metagenomic detection.
Interestingly, when NF1 was mixed with the NF2ΔexoA mutant,
instead of the NF2 parental strain, and injected i.m., dissemination
of NF1 to peripheral organs was not observed. The injected strains
remained at the site of injection (Fig. S2C). Clearly, dissemination
of NF1 after injection was influenced by the mixture of NF1 and
NF2 and, most likely, due to ExoA secreted by the latter.
Elimination of NF2 from Site of Injection with NF1 and NF2. When
NF2-lux alone was injected in mice by the i.m. route at a dose of 2
or 5 × 108 cfu, bioluminescent signals were detected at 0 and 24 h
p.i. at the site of injection in all animals (Fig. 3A). At 24 h p.i., bio-
luminescent intensity was comparatively less around the site of in-
jection, likely due to the migration of NF2 from the site of infection
to peripheral organs. Similarly, i.m. infection with the NF1-lux alone
resulted in bacteria localized around the site of injection, between
24 and 72 h p.i. (Fig. 3D; 72 h data not shown). Eventually, the
NF1-lux bioluminescent signal decreased and the animals no longer
demonstrated localized bioluminescence at 6 d p.i., indicating
clearing of the bacteria from the mice; all of the animals survived.
However, mixed infection with NF1 and NF2-lux resulted in
significant decrease in bioluminescent signal at 24 h p.i., compared
with animals infected with NF2-lux alone (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
bacteria recovered from muscle tissue 24 h p.i. were bioluminescent-
negative NF1 (Fig. 3C). Thus, these results confirmed clearing of
NF2 within 24 h p.i. when injected with NF1.
Role of exoA in Murine Infection. Genome sequencing and annota-
tion revealed exoA gene, a major virulence factor in P. aeruginosa and
related species, was present in A. hydrophila NF2, NF3, and NF4, but
absent from NF1 (7). Similarly, diarrheal isolate SSU of A. dhakensis,
serving as reference, carries the exoA gene, which is 97% homologous
to exoA of NF2. Initially, the exoA gene was cloned with its cis-acting
promoter from the SSU strain and transformed via mini-Tn7 trans-
position system to NF1; the resulting strain is referred to as NF1-
exoA (Table S2). The exoA gene was inserted downstream of the
glmS gene encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase.
When NF1-exoA was injected i.m., all animals succumbed to in-
fection by 24 h p.i. at an infection dose of 8 × 107 or 2 × 108 cfu
(Fig. 4A). As a control, mice were infected with WT NF1 at a dose
of 2 × 108 cfu, and these animals all survived. Similarly, all mice
injected with WT SSU died by day 2, whereas animals injected with
SSUΔexoA mutant at the same dose survived (Fig. 4B). In contrast,
mice injected with SSUΔexoA::exoA at a dose of 2 × 108 cfu all died
Fig. 3.
Progression of infection from the local site of injection for NF strains in a mouse model. (A) A group of five mice was infected with NF2-lux or NF2-lux
and NF1 in mixed culture (1:1 ratio) at 2 × 108 cfu per animal. Immediately after injection and at 24 h p.i., the animals were imaged for bioluminescence signal.
(B) Total flux (p/s) was measured for each animal around the bioluminescent spot with the same shape and area across the images. The values between NF2-
lux and the NF1 and NF2-lux mixed infection were then compared. (C) After 24 h p.i., the absence of bioluminescence from bacterial colonies recovered from
muscle tissue of NF2-lux and NF1 mixed infection indicated elimination of NF2-lux from the site of injection. Bacterial load of the injected muscle tissue is also
shown. The horizontal lines represent the arithmetic means of the bacterial counts. (D) Time course for progression of dissemination for NF1-lux strain was
monitored for 6 d. Bioluminescence images are for 0 h, 24 h, and 6 d p.i.

 by 24 h p.i. (Fig. 4B), clearly indicating a role of ExoA in animal
mortality and, by extrapolation, septic progression of NF.
At 24 h p.i., NF1-exoA is concluded to disseminate signifi-
cantly more widely than when NF1 was injected. All animals
injected with NF1-exoA yielded bacterial counts for both spleen and
liver, i.e., 106 to 107 cfu per organ, respectively (Fig. 4C). In contrast,
only one of five animals injected with NF1 yielded bacterial colony
counts and then only ∼5 × 103 cfu per organ (spleen) (Fig. 4C). NF1
was not detected in the liver of any of the animals after 24 h p.i.
Subsequent construction of ΔexoA mutant of NF2 confirmed the
role of this toxin in an i.m. murine model. As a control, all animals
injected with NF2 parental strain at a dose of 2 × 108 cfu died by
48 h p.i. However, mice injected with NF2ΔexoA at the same or
2.5-fold higher dose all survived (Fig. 4D).
Phagocytosis Efficiency and Elimination of NF2 by Macrophages.
Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 infection in vitro with NF2
resulted in phagocytosis at a significantly higher rate compared with
NF1 (Fig. 5A). Uptake of NF1 and NF1-exoA by macrophages was
similar. Although NF2 was phagocytized to a greater extent, percent
intracellular survival of NF1, NF2, and NF1-exoA was approxi-
mately the same, i.e., 25% (Fig. 5B).
Suppression of Growth of NF2 by NF1. When NF1 and NF2 were
grown alone in vitro, both showed significant growth at 6 h (Fig.
5C). However, when NF1 and NF2-lux were mixed, 5:1 or 10:1,
plated on agar, and incubated for 6 h, colony counts for NF2-lux
were reduced approximately fivefold (Fig. 5D). In contrast, in a
liquid medium, when NF1 and NF2-lux cultures were grown at 5:1
or 10:1 mixture, NF2-lux exhibited four- to fivefold growth at the 6 h
time point (Fig. 5E). When NF2 was in excess compared with NF1-
lux (5:1 or 10:1) in mixed culture, the growth of NF1-lux on solid
agar plate was not inhibited by NF2 (Fig. 5F).
Influence of NF1 on Bacterial Motility via Expression of exoA. De-
letion of exoA from SSU resulted in increased swimming and
swarming motility, and motility returned to the level of A. hydrophila
SSU WT when the mutant was complemented with exoA (Fig. S3).
Equivalently, when exoA was expressed in NF1, swimming and
swarming motility was significantly decreased compared with that of
NF1 (Fig. S3). In accordance, the level of vfr gene expression, a
negative regulator of motility, was inversely related to levels of fleQ
transcript, a positive regulator of motility, in NF1, NF1-exoA, WT
SSU, and SSUΔexoA. For example, WT SSU showed 2.29 ± 0.05-
fold lower fleQ transcript level than that of SSUΔexoA mutant.
Similarly, fleQ expression was down-regulated by 2.41 ± 0.029-fold
in NF1-exoA compared with NF1. Conversely, the level of vfr gene
expression in NF1-exoA was 1.40 ± 0.01-fold up-regulated com-
pared with NF1. In SSUΔexoA, vfr gene expression was 1.45 ± 0.04-
fold down-regulated compared with WT SSU.
Discussion
A. hydrophila strains NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4 were isolated from a
patient with NF as a consequence of deep wound infection (7).
Among the strains, NF2, NF3, and NF4 were characterized as a
clonal group, with NF2 presenting as the dominant colony mor-
photype. Genomic analysis of NF1 demonstrated a phylogenetically
distant relationship to the other three stains, indicating the patient, in
reality, suffered from a mixed infection acquired from exposure to a
natural water reservoir of A. hydrophila. Specifically, the presence of
the exoA gene in NF2 led to increased virulence of strain NF2 when
tested in a mouse model, compared with NF1 (Fig. S1) (7).
In contrast, NF1 was restricted to the local site of infection and
eventually eliminated by the host innate immune system (Fig. 3D);
NF1 rarely caused death of the infected animals. One of the striking
differences between NF1 and NF2 was that the latter harbored the
exoA gene, with its C-terminal ADP ribosylation domain sharing
77% homology to a similar domain of P. aeruginosa ExoA. ExoA is

multiple of infection (moi) of 5, and percent bacterial uptake was calculated
based on colony counts after gentamicin treatment (1.75 h p.i.) (A). At 2 h
after gentamicin treatment, intracellular bacterial counts were determined
to estimate percentage of intracellular bacterial survival (B). Furthermore,
NF1 and NF2 were grown individually in LB medium at 37 °C for 6 h with
180 rpm shaking in an incubator (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Enfield, CT)
and bacterial counts determined (C). At the same time, NF1 and NF2-lux
were mixed at a ratio of 5:1 (solid bar) or 10:1 (dotted bar), respectively. The
mixed cultures were either incubated at 37 °C on LB agar plates for 6 h (D) or
in liquid LB medium with 180 rpm shaking for 6 h (E), and the growth of
NF2-lux was measured. Similarly, when NF2 was mixed with NF1-lux at a
ratio of 5:1 (solid bar) or 10:1 (dotted bar), respectively, and incubated at
37 °C on LB agar plates for 6 h, the number of NF1-lux was enumerated (F).
Results were plotted with arithmetic means ± SD.

 an eEF-2 inhibitor; the toxin is involved in catalytic transfer of ADP
ribose to eEF-2 (12), resulting in inhibition of host cell protein synthesis.
ExoA causes necrosis and apoptosis of mouse liver in acute phase
(10). Therefore, it is possible that ExoA secreted by NF2 destroys or
liquefies muscle (hallmark of NF) at the site of injection (Fig. 1B),
breaking the local barrier and allowing systemic spread of the or-
ganism. However, because NF1 does not natively produce ExoA, it
persists at the injection site and eventually is cleared by host defense
mechanisms (Fig. 3D).
Although studies of monomicrobial infection with only NF1 or
NF2 help to understand A. hydrophila-associated NF, we can now
offer the hypothesis that a mixture of NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4 at a
wound site significantly influences progression of infection. In-
terestingly, NF caused by group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus species
is often polymicrobial (1). During such mixed infections, synergistic
or antagonistic effects on virulence induced by the causative agents
comprise a complex interplay leading to establishment and subsequent
progression of disease (13, 14). For example, Mosser et al., recently
reported enhanced virulence for several natural and experimentally
paired Aeromonas strains in a Caenorhabditis elegans killing model
(13). Interestingly, the synergistic effects they observed were limited to
pairs that were composed of strains belonging to different species (13).
Synergistic virulence in wound infections has been reported for
type-2 diabetic mouse models (14). In those animals, mixed infec-
tions with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium per-
fringens led to a higher bacterial load of B. fragilis around the s.c.
injection sites when E. coli was present. Similarly, C. perfringens and
B. fragilis showed possible interplay enhancing their survival during
infection. The results presented in this study of mixed infection with
NF strains in a mouse model clearly indicate interactive processes of
both synergistic augmentation and antagonistic attenuation of vir-
ulence of NF1 and NF2 (Fig. 6). What is noteworthy is that un-
derstanding this interplay among strains of the same species
involved in a mixed infection is critical for determining molecular
mechanisms involved in progression of A. hydrophila-associated NF.
Reduction in mortality and elimination of NF2 from the site of
injection in mice was observed when both NF1 and NF2 were in-
jected (Figs. 1A and 3 A–C), indicating an antagonistic effect of NF1
on virulence of NF2. The results of in vitro growth experiments
provided evidence that NF1 was lethal for NF2 when both were in
close contact on a solid medium (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest
the possible involvement of a secretion system capable of introducing
toxic effector molecules from NF1 to NF2. One such secretion sys-
tem reported for A. hydrophila is the type-VI secretion system
(T6SS) (15). The genome profiles showed the presence of two
clusters of T6SS synthesis genes and effectors [three copies of
Hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and five copies of valine-
glycine repeat G proteins (VgrGs)] in both NF1 and NF2 (7),
raising the possibility that expression of these effector molecule-
encoding genes may be differentially regulated in A. hydrophila
NF1 and NF2. Alternatively, it is also plausible that NF1 but not
NF2 may possess yet-unidentified specific bacterial toxic T6SS
effectors. Likely, interaction of strain NF1 mutated for the T6SS
locus with NF2 may provide a definitive answer under this ex-
perimental setting. Therefore, future studies to determine the
role of T6SS in the interplay between NF1 and NF2 should be
conducted to understand the survival and thriving strategies
of these bacteria in a competitive environment, namely the
aquatic ecosystem.
Macrophage phagocytosis and intracellular survival data for NF1
and NF2 (Fig. 5 A and B) suggest that there is a host intervening
process in the elimination of NF2 when NF1 is also present at the
site of infection. NF1 in mixed culture may favor recruitment and/or
activation of macrophages, which would result in rapid elimination
of NF2 before the bacterium enters systemic circulation (Fig. 6).
It can be noted that the motile version of P. aeruginosa strain is
associated with enhanced macrophage recruitment to the site of
infection and efficient activation via bacterial flagellar interaction
with host pathogen recognition receptors (16–18). NF1 proved to
have superior motility (Fig. S3) and, thus, can be expected to in-
crease host innate immune surveillance at the local site of infection.
Because NF2 was relatively readily phagocytized and subsequently
killed by host macrophages (Fig. 5 A and B) in monomicrobial in-
fection, ExoA-mediated local tissue damage would overwhelm the
host macrophage-intervened defense process, allowing the bacte-
rium to cause septicemic infection and acute mortality in animals.
After the antagonistic effect of NF1 on virulence of NF2 had
been demonstrated, evidence was sought to delineate effects of NF2
on pathogenesis of NF1 in a mouse model of mixed infection.
Results showed ExoA secreted by NF2 played an important role in
progression of NF caused by NF1 during mixed infection. That is,
ExoA causes tissue damage at the site of infection, thereby weak-
ening host defense barriers. As a consequence, NF1 is less phago-
cytized and less likely to be killed by local macrophages, and
can disseminate efficiently to peripheral organs (Fig. 6). When
NF2ΔexoA mutant was mixed with NF1, dissemination of NF1 did
not occur, confirming a role of ExoA in bacterial dissemination.
Similarly, cis expression of the exoA gene in NF1 significantly in-
creased bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs and increased
animal mortality (Fig. 4 A and C).
In summary, when NF is caused by a mixed infection with strains
of a single species, namely A. hydrophila, progression of NF follows
a different course from that of a single strain of A. hydrophila. In this
study, a murine NF model of infection and metagenomic analysis
was used to show that ExoA of NF2 plays a significant role in both
local necrotic inflammation and bacterial dissemination to periph-
eral organs. Therapeutic formulation that could inactivate ExoA
should be considered when treating A. hydrophila-related NF. Fu-
ture studies identifying T6SS effector molecule(s) produced by NF1
that blocks growth of NF2 might prove useful in designing antimi-
crobials against NF strains of A. hydrophila.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions. A. hydrophila NF strains are listed in
Table S2 and were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth with
180 rpm shaking. The cultures were washed twice in sterile PBS and resuspended
in the same buffer to prepare doses for injection in mice. All animal studies were
performed under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
protocol at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Antibiotics, namely ampicillin
(Ap) 250 μg/mL, kanamycin (Km) 100 μg/mL, and rifampicin (Rif) 200 μg/mL, were
added as needed. LB agar plates were prepared with appropriate antibiotics
when growth of the bacteria on solid medium was required.

Schematic showing interaction of NF strains during mixed infections.
Left indicates absence of ExoA in strain NF1 resulted in the bacterium being
confined to the local site of infection and eventually eliminated by host de-
fense mechanisms. In contrast, Right shows secretion of ExoA by strain NF2
allowed the bacterium to disseminate to peripheral organs, away from the site
of infection, by destroying local tissue barriers. Middle reveals pathodynamics
of mixed infection with NF1 and NF2. ExoA secreted by NF2 assists dissemi-
nation of NF1 to peripheral organs by destroying local tissue barriers.
However, NF1 facilitates direct killing and/or host-mediated elimination of
NF2 from the site of infection in muscle tissue. Triple arrow indicates
overwhelming response compared with that indicated by the single arrow.

 Genetic Manipulation of the Bacterial Strains.
Construction of bioluminescent A. hydrophila NF2. Luciferase enzyme-mediated
bioluminescent strain of A. hydrophila NF2 was constructed as explained (7,
19). A detailed procedure is given in SI Materials and Methods.
Construction of A. hydrophila NF1-exoA strain. The exoA gene from a diarrheal
isolate SSU of A. dhakensis (20) was initially cloned, along with its native pro-
moter, in a Tn7-based transposon system. Briefly, the strain was generated by
triparental conjugation of Rifr NF1, E. coli SM10 λpir carrying the pTNS2 plasmid,
and E. coli SM10 λpir harboring the pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T::Ap-exoA plasmid.
Insertion of the target gene at the correct location was confirmed by PCR, using
a primer pair PTn7R:5′ ACAGCATAACTGGACTGATTTC 3′ and GlmSFwd: 5′
GCCAGTATCCCATTGCCATG 3′, followed by DNA sequencing.
Construction of A. hydrophila NF2ΔexoA mutant strain. Upstream and downstream
flanking regions corresponding to the exoA gene from NF2 strain were PCR am-
plified and the product cloned into pRE112 suicide vector to in-frame delete the
target gene from the genome of NF2, as described (21). Subsequently, deletion of
the exoA gene from the mutant was confirmed by PCR and genome sequencing.
Generation of A. dhakensis SSUΔexoA mutant strain and complementation of the
mutant with the corresponding exoA gene. In-frame deletion of the exoA gene
from the genome of SSU was performed as described above for the NF2ΔexoA
strain. To obtain the complemented strain, the SSUΔexoA mutant strain was
transformed with the plasmid pBR322 carrying the native exoA gene with its
200-bp cis-operating promoter. We also transformed empty pBR322 vector into
the WT SSU strain to serve as a negative control for some of the studies. Various
primer sequences used during the study are listed in Table S3.
In Vitro Characterization of the Bacterial Strains. Bacterial swarming and
swimming motilities were measured as described (7). A detailed method is
provided in SI Materials and Methods. Furthermore, various in vitro assays,
such as transcriptome measures for genes fleQ and vfr via RT-PCR, phago-
cytic assay and intracellular survival in macrophage cell culture, and growth
dynamics of mixed NF strains on solid or in liquid medium, carried out for
this study were elaborated in SI Materials and Methods.
Animal Infection and Mortality Pattern Analysis. Healthy female Swiss–Web-
ster mice (Taconic Farms) were infected via the i.m. route with infection
doses of 8 × 107, 2 × 108, or 5 × 108 cfu per animal. For mixed infections,
indicated doses represented equal numbers of cfu for each of the mixed
strains. After infection, animals were observed for disease progression over a
period of 7 d and the mortality rate was recorded daily.
Isolation of DNA from Murine Tissues Infected with A. hydrophila NF Strain
Mixture. Five animals were injected i.m. with a mixed culture of A. hydro-
phila, NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4, at infection dose of 5 × 108 cfu per animal (1.25 ×
108 cfu per strain). After 24 h p.i., ∼250 mg of muscle tissue around the injection
sites were collected in sterile PBS. Similarly, the entire spleen and liver were
excised from the animals and immersed in 1 and 2 mL, respectively, of sterile
PBS. The tissues were thoroughly ground, and homogenates passed through
70-μm nylon filters. An aliquot (100 μL) of the filtrate from each sample was
plated on sheep blood agar and colonies enumerated after incubation over-
night at 37 °C. Remaining filtrates were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min to
pellet animal tissue and bacteria. From the pellet fractions, total DNA was
isolated by using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen).
Bacterial Dissemination Using a Murine Intramuscular Model. Mice infected
with the given NF strain or mixture of strains i.m. were killed at 24 or 48 h p.i.
Approximately 250 mg of muscle tissue around the injection site and the
entire liver and spleen were placed in sterile PBS. Samples were homoge-
nized, serially diluted, and aliquots plated on LB agar plates supplemented
with appropriate antibiotic(s). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, colonies
were counted to calculate bacterial load per organ or gram of muscle tissue.
In Vitro Imaging of Animals Infected with A. hydrophila Strains and Bioluminescent
Bacterial Colonies on Agar Plates. Animals were infected with either A. hydrophila
NF1-lux or NF2-lux i.m. Whole-body imaging was performed at indicated time
points by using a IVIS 200 bioluminescence and fluorescence whole-body imaging
workstation (Caliper), with auto-background and other appropriate default set-
tings. Pixel intensity was adjusted to achieve uniform bioluminescence measure-
ment for all experiments. Tissue homogenates were serially diluted and plated on
LB agar and colony bioluminescence measured by using the IVIS system.
Metagenomic Sequencing and Analysis. Bacterial community DNA extracted
from muscle, spleen, and liver tissue was sequenced by using a MiSeq
benchtop sequencer (Illumina). The DNA was quantified with a Qubit 2.0
flourometer (Life Technologies), diluted to appropriate concentration, and
prepared for sequencing by using the Nextera sample preparation kit (Illu-
mina). Paired-end DNA libraries were sequenced for a total of 500 cycles in a
multiplex format (6 samples per run, on average). FastQ files were converted
to FastA format and directly analyzed by using GENIUS software package
(CosmosID) for rapid identification of bacterial species and strains with es-
timations of their relative abundance (22, 23). Work flow details of GENIUS
software are given in SI Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Animal survival rates were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier
survival estimate with Bonferroni post hoc test with GraphPad Prism version
6.0 software. Other data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test with GraphPad Prism version 6.0
software. In addition, unpaired t test was used to compare data from two
groups when appropriate. Wherever applicable, P values are reported, and a
P value of ≤0.05 is considered significant.
