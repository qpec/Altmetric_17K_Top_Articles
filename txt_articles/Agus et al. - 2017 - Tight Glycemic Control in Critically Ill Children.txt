Abstract
BACKGROUND—In multicenter studies, tight glycemic control targeting a normal blood 
glucose level has not been shown to improve outcomes in critically ill adults or children after 
cardiac surgery. Studies involving critically ill children who have not undergone cardiac surgery 
are lacking.
METHODS—In a 35-center trial, we randomly assigned critically ill children with confirmed 
hyperglycemia (excluding patients who had undergone cardiac surgery) to one of two ranges of 
glycemic control: 80 to 110 mg per deciliter (4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter; lower-target group) or 150 
to 180 mg per deciliter (8.3 to 10.0 mmol per liter; higher-target group). Clinicians were guided by 
continuous glucose monitoring and explicit methods for insulin adjustment. The primary outcome 
was the number of intensive care unit (ICU)–free days to day 28.
RESULTS—The trial was stopped early, on the recommendation of the data and safety 
monitoring board, owing to a low likelihood of benefit and evidence of the possibility of harm. Of 
713 patients, 360 were randomly assigned to the lower-target group and 353 to the higher-target 
group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median number of ICU-free days did not differ 
significantly between the lower-target group and the higher-target group (19.4 days [interquartile 
range {IQR}, 0 to 24.2] and 19.4 days [IQR, 6.7 to 23.9], respectively; P = 0.58). In per-protocol 
analyses, the median time-weighted average glucose level was significantly lower in the lower-
target group (109 mg per deciliter [IQR, 102 to 118]; 6.1 mmol per liter [IQR, 5.7 to 6.6]) than in 
the higher-target group (123 mg per deciliter [IQR, 108 to 142]; 6.8 mmol per liter [IQR, 6.0 to 
7.9]; P<0.001). Patients in the lower-target group also had higher rates of health care–associated 
infections than those in the higher-target group (12 of 349 patients [3.4%] vs. 4 of 349 [1.1%], P = 
0.04), as well as higher rates of severe hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level below 40 
mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter) (18 patients [5.2%] vs. 7 [2.0%], P = 0.03). No significant

CONCLUSIONS—Critically ill children with hyperglycemia did not benefit from tight glycemic 
control targeted to a blood glucose level of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter, as compared with a level of 
150 to 180 mg per deciliter.
Tight glycemic control to a blood glucose level of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter (4.4 to 6.1 
mmol per liter) was originally shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in a single-center, 
randomized clinical trial involving critically ill adult surgical patients,1 but subsequent trials 
involving adults have not shown benefit. 2–4 Results of trials of tight glycemic control in 
critically ill children have been inconsistent5–8; retrospective studies have consistently 
shown an association between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes. 9–12 A single-center, 
randomized trial involving children, most of whom had undergone cardiac surgery, showed 
significantly lower mortality and infection rate and shorter length of stay with lower glucose 
targets than with higher glucose targets, despite high rates of severe hypoglycemia (blood 
glucose level, <40 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]).5 Other investigators found 
significantly lower morbidity with lower glucose targets than with higher glucose targets in 
pediatric patients with burns.8 Multicenter trials of tight glucose control involving children 
have included mostly patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and have not shown 
lower mortality, shorter length of stay, or fewer health care–associated infections with lower 
glucose targets than with conventional glucose control6 or standard care7 but have shown 
lower 12-month health care costs.6
A survey of pediatric intensivists identified wide variation in glycemic control practice and 
equipoise between lower and higher glucose targets, which justifies further study.13 Pediatric 
intensivists indicated that safe adjustment of continuous intravenous insulin to minimize the 
risk of hypoglycemia was crucial.10,11,13 Thus, the current Heart and Lung Failure–Pediatric 
Insulin Titration (HALF-PINT) trial tested the hypothesis that tight glycemic control to a 
target range of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter (lower target) versus a target range of 150 to 180 
mg per deciliter (8.3 to 10.0 mmol per liter; higher target) would increase the number of 
intensive care unit (ICU)–free days in critically ill children with hyperglycemia who have 
cardiovascular or respiratory failure; the trial targeted an enriched cohort of pediatric 
patients in the ICU who could benefit most from tight glucose control — those with the 
greatest risk of death and longest lengths of stay.14,15 Continuous glucose monitoring and 
computer-guided insulin adjustment were used to minimize hypoglycemia.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
A total of 35 centers screened children 2 weeks to 17 years of age who were receiving 
vasoactive support for hypotension or invasive mechanical ventilation. Only patients with a 
measured blood glucose level greater than 130 mg per deciliter were assessed for exclusion 
criteria. We excluded children who had diabetes, those who had inadequate vascular access, 
and those who had undergone cardiac surgery. Children underwent randomization at 32 sites 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

 A data and safety monitoring board, whose members were appointed by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute, monitored trial data and oversaw patients’ safety. Central ethics 
review was coordinated by the institutional review board at Boston Children’s Hospital, with 
appropriate signed institutional reliance agreements. A total of 10 study sites established 
reliance relationships; at the remaining sites, oversight was conducted by a local institutional 
review board. Written informed consent was obtained from legal guardians, and assent was 
obtained from patients when appropriate.
All the authors participated in the design of the study and vouch for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). 
Nova Biomedical provided glucose meters (Nova StatStrip), test strips, management 
software, and training support at no cost, and Edwards Life-sciences provided closed blood-
sparing sampling systems (VAMP Jr. System) at no cost. Dexcom provided continuous 
glucose-monitoring systems and sensors (G4 Platinum) at a reduced rate, and Medtronic 
MiniMed provided continuous glucose-monitoring systems and sensors (Guardian REAL-
Time and Enlite) at a reduced rate. These companies were not involved in the study design 
or drafting of the manuscript and did not review the manuscript before it was submitted for

INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES
A detailed description of the study methods was published previously.16 Patients were 
randomly assigned, with the use of a central computer, to receive tight glucose control with a 
target of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter (lower-target group) or 150 to 180 mg per deciliter 
(higher-target group), with continuous intravenous insulin adjusted to maintain the blood 
glucose level in the target range. Randomization was performed according to a permuted-
block design with stratification according to study site. Bedside clinicians were aware of the 
study-group assignments, given the need to manage insulin therapy. The intervention began 
in each patient when hyperglycemia was confirmed (two consecutive blood glucose levels of 
≥150 mg per deciliter) and ended when the patient met study-defined, site-independent 
criteria for ICU discharge, including the discontinuation of vasoactive infusions and invasive 
mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation that provided at least 5 cm of water 
pressure, or after 28 days, whichever came first.
The blood glucose level was controlled with the use of continuous intravenous regular 
human insulin. The timing of blood glucose measurements, dosing of insulin, and glucose 
rescue boluses were guided by the bedside computerized Children’s Hospital Euglycemia 
for Kids Spreadsheet (CHECKS)7,17 protocol (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Blood glucose was measured with the use of an identical glucose meter at all the study sites, 
after blood was drawn through a closed blood-sparing system, preferentially from an 
existing arterial catheter. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to signal impending 
hypoglycemia.18–20 These specific devices were incorporated into the study design to 
mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia, to ensure consistency across centers, and to address 
limitations of previous studies.21,22 Age-based minimum glucose-infusion rates were 
recommended at 5 mg (0.3 mmol) per kilogram of body weight per minute in patients 
younger than 6 years of age and at 2.5 mg (0.1 mmol) per kilogram per minute in patients 6

 years of age or older.23 Site staff were supported by the Clinical Coordinating Center with 
live computer support, a 24-hour telephone hotline, and automatic messaging to alert staff of 
defined events, such as severe hypoglycemia.
The primary outcome was the number of ICU-free days to day 28, which is the inverse 
equivalent of 28-day hospital mortality–adjusted ICU length of stay.2,4,24–26 The number of 
ICU-free days was considered to be zero for children who did not meet the ICU discharge 
criteria or who were transferred or died by day 28. Secondary outcomes included 90-day 
mortality, severity of organ dysfunction (according to the Pediatric Logistic Organ 
Dysfunction [PELOD] score27), the number of ventilator-free days to day 28, the incidence 
of health care–associated infection according to current published definitions from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),28 and the incidence of hypoglycemia. 
Health care–associated infections were adjudicated by local independent infectious disease 
officers, who were responsible for reporting ICU-associated infections to national 
surveillance programs. These officers were not formally unaware of the study-group 
assignments. Nutritional intake and indexes of glycemic control were tracked during the 
period of ICU stay, according to a priori definitions.16
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We calculated the sample size on the basis of the primary outcome measure of the number of 
ICU-free days to day 28, using an estimated hospital mortality of 8% and a mean ICU length 
of stay of 8.5 days in the higher-target group, as calculated from the Pediatric Intensive Care 
Audit Network database.29,30 We estimated that to achieve 90% power at the 5% level of 
significance, with three interim analyses, we would have to enroll 1880 patients in the study 
to detect 20% lower mortality and 1 day shorter ICU length of stay with the lower target 
than with the higher target. This would equate to 1.25 more ICU-free days with the lower 
target than with the higher target (19.19 vs. 17.94). Given a slower-than-expected enrollment 
after 3 years, the sample size was revised to achieve 80% power with 1414 patients.
Analysis of the primary outcome was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and used 
proportional-hazards regression with adjustment for age group and severity of illness in the 
first 12 hours of ICU stay (as assessed with the use of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 
[PRISM] III-12 score31). Additional analyses were performed on a per-protocol basis, which 
excluded patients who had undergone randomization and never received the intervention and 
those whose guardian withdrew full consent.
The characteristics of the patients at baseline and the glycemia and insulin therapy variables 
were compared with the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher’s exact tests. Data on 
glycemic control included all blood glucose levels as measured with a bedside glucose 
meter. Sensor measurements were used whenever glucose-meter measurements were 
unavailable. Time-weighted glucose averages were calculated from serial measurements. 
Glucose measurements were interpolated at half-hour intervals from available 
measurements; the time to the target range (from randomization to the first measured 
glucose level in the target range) and the percentage of time in the target range were 
calculated from the interpolated curves. Other analyses used proportional-hazards regression 
for time-to-event outcomes, linear regression for continuous outcomes, and logistic

 regression for binary outcomes, with adjustment for age group and severity of illness. All P 
values are two-tailed and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute); StatXact software, 
version 11.1 (Cytel); East software, version 6.4 (Cytel); and GraphPad Prism software, 
version 7.00 (GraphPad Software).
RESULTS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Enrollment began in April 2012 and ended in September 2016. The recruitment was stopped 
early at 50% enrollment. Although the data did not cross prespecified efficacy or futility 
boundaries, conditional power analyses showed a 1% chance of detecting a significant result 
even if the number of ICU-free days was 1.25 days longer in the lower-target group than in 
the higher-target group with 100% enrollment (see the Supplementary Appendix). On the 
basis of all available data, the data and safety monitoring board recommended halting the 
trial.
A total of 713 patients underwent randomization at 32 sites. A total of 360 patients were 
assigned to the lower-target range, and 353 to the higher-target range; these patients were 
included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome (Fig. 1, and Tables S1 and 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Ten patients were withdrawn by study staff before the 
intervention owing to a change in eligibility status, and 5 whose guardians withdrew full 
consent were not included in the per-protocol analyses; thus, the per-protocol analysis 
included 698 patients (349 patients in each group). The characteristics of the patients in the 
two study groups were similar at baseline (Table 1).
INSULIN TREATMENT AND BLOOD GLUCOSE MANAGEMENT
The blood glucose measurements that qualified patients for randomization were similar in 
the lower-target group and the higher-target group (median, 189 mg per deciliter 
[interquartile range, 165 to 243] and 182 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 164 to 232], 
respectively [10.5 mmol per liter {interquartile range, 9.2 to 13.5} and 10.1 mmol per liter 
{interquartile range, 9.1 to 12.9}, respectively]; P = 0.25) (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The 
measurements at the start of the intervention were also similar in the lower-target group and 
the higher-target group (133 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 110 to 160] and 131 mg 
per deciliter [interquartile range, 107 to 165], respectively [7.4 mmol per liter {interquartile 
range, 6.1 to 8.9} and 7.3 mmol per liter {interquartile range, 5.9 to 9.2}, respectively]; P = 
0.80).
There was significant separation of blood glucose levels between the groups for the first 18 
days of the intervention (P<0.05 for each daily comparison) (Fig. S2 in Supplementary 
Appendix). The median time-weighted average glucose level over the study period was 109 
mg per deciliter in the lower-target group (interquartile range, 102 to 118 [6.1 mmol per liter 
{interquartile range, 5.7 to 6.6}]), as compared with 123 mg per deciliter in the higher-target 
group (interquartile range, 108 to 142 [6.8 mmol per liter {interquartile range, 6.0 to 7.9}]) 
(P<0.001) (Fig. 2B).

 Nearly all the patients in the lower-target group (344 of 349 patients [98.6%]) received 
insulin therapy per protocol, with a median dose of 0.74 units per kilogram per day over the 
study period, as compared with 215 of 349 patients in the higher-target group (61.6%) with a 
median dose of 0.01 units per kilogram per day (Fig. 2C). Bedside clinicians were highly 
adherent to the insulin-dosing recommendations of the CHECKS protocol (49,835 of 51,212 
recommendations [97.3%] in the lower-target group vs. 49,921 of 50,329 [99.2%] in the 
higher-target group, P<0.001). In addition to continuous glucose monitoring, providers 
performed more blood glucose measurements per 24-hour period in the lower-target group 
(median, 17.4 measurements [interquartile range, 13.9 to 19.6]) than in the higher-target 
group (median, 7.0 measurements [interquartile range, 5.5 to 11.5] (P<0.001).
Severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, <40 mg per deciliter) that was considered by the 
investigators, according to prospectively defined criteria,16 to be related to insulin 
administration occurred in 13 of 349 patients (3.7%) in the lower-target group, as compared 
with 1 of 349 (0.3%) in the higher-target group (P = 0.01). With the inclusion of instances in 
which severe hypoglycemia was considered to be unrelated to insulin administration, the 
total incidence was higher in the lower-target group than in the higher-target group (18 
patients [5.2%] vs. 7 [2.0%], P = 0.03). Three patients, all of whom had had seizure activity 
in the ICU before enrollment in the trial, had seizures during an episode of hypoglycemia. 
No other complications of hypoglycemia were reported. The incidence of hypokalemia 
(potassium level, <2.5 mmol per liter32) was similar in the two groups.
NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT
Over the first 8 study days (the median length of ICU stay), the glucose-infusion rates, the 
percentage of intake as enteral nutrition, and the level of total nutrition were similar in the 
two groups (Fig. 2D, 2E, and 2F). By the eighth day, patients in the lower-target group and 
those in the higher-target group were receiving more than half their intake as enteral 
feedings, with similar caloric content (median, 38 kcal per kilogram per day [interquartile 
range, 21 to 63] and 42 kcal per kilogram per day [interquartile range, 26 to 66], 
respectively; P = 0.36). Over the entire study period, patients in the lower-target group and 
those in the higher-target group received a similar percentage of their nutrition enterally 
(53% [interquartile range, 3 to 86] and 55% [interquartile range, 6 to 88], respectively; P = 
0.46). The median glucose-infusion rates over the study period were consistent with study 
recommendations in the combined treatment groups (5.6 mg per kilogram per minute 
[interquartile range, 3.8 to 7.0] [0.3 mmol per kilogram per minute {interquartile range, 0.2 
to 0.4}] in patients <6 years of age, and 2.6 mg per kilogram per minute [interquartile range, 
1.9 to 3.6] [0.1 mmol per kilogram per minute {interquartile range, 0.1 to 0.2}] in those ≥6 
years of age).
OUTCOMES
In the intention-to-treat analysis that included 713 patients, the median number of ICU-free 
days did not differ significantly between the lower-target group and the higher-target group 
(19.4 days [interquartile range, 0 to 24.2] and 19.4 days [interquartile range, 6.7 to 23.9], 
respectively; P = 0.58) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the per-protocol 
analysis involving 698 patients, the median number of ICU-free days also did not differ

 significantly between the lower-target group and the higher-target group (20.0 days 
[interquartile range, 1.0 to 24.2] and 19.4 days [interquartile range, 7.1 to 23.9], 
respectively; P = 0.86) (Table 3).
Secondary outcomes are reported according to the per-protocol analysis (Table 3). Of these, 
a significantly higher incidence of total health care–associated infections was noted in the 
lower-target group than in the higher-target group (12 of 349 patients [3.4%] vs. 4 of 349 
[1.1%], P = 0.04) — specifically, a higher rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections 
in the lower-target group (1.94 vs. 0 infections per 1000 central-venous-catheter–days, P = 
0.03). The incidence of all culture-positive infections, including those that did not meet the 
CDC definitions of health care–associated infection, did not differ significantly between the 
lower-target group and the higher-target group (29 patients [8.3%] and 34 patients [9.7%], 
respectively; P = 0.52). Conversely, empirical treatment with antibiotic agents without 
specific positive cultures was widespread and was slightly less common in the lower-target 
group than in the higher-target group (326 patients [93.4%] vs. 338 [96.8%], P = 0.04).
Mortality at 28 days was non-significantly higher in the lower-target group than in the 
higher-target group (47 of 349 patients [13.5%] and 32 of 349 [9.2%], respectively; P = 
0.09) and did not differ significantly between groups at 90 days (52 [14.9%] and 40 [11.5%], 
respectively; P = 0.22). No significant between-group differences were found in the number 
of ventilator-free days (P = 0.84) or the number of hospital-free days (P = 0.60). Other 
markers of the severity of illness were elevated similarly in the two groups, including the 
maximum PELOD score (P = 0.38), the maximum daily vasoactive-inotrope score (P = 
0.55), the incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P = 0.80), and cannulation for the 
delivery of extracorporeal life support (P = 0.37). There were no associations between health 
care–associated infection, severe hypoglycemia, or any hypoglycemia with either 28-day or 
90-day hospital mortality (P>0.05 for all comparisons by Fisher’s exact test). Adjustment for 
study site did not appreciably change the results.
DISCUSSION
In this multicenter, randomized trial, we found no significant difference in the number of 
ICU-free days (or 28-day hospital mortality–adjusted length of stay in the ICU) or in any 
secondary outcomes with tight glucose control targeted to a blood glucose level of 80 to 110 
mg per deciliter versus a level of 150 to 180 mg per deciliter. The enriched cohort of 
critically ill children with hyperglycemia had higher mortality at 90 days (13.2%) and a 
longer length of stay in the ICU (approximately 8 days) than in previous studies of tight 
glucose control in children.5–7,14,15 The 28-day hospital mortality was non-significantly 
higher in the lower-target group than in the higher-target group (P = 0.09), and the between-
group difference in hospital mortality was not significant at 90 days. There was no 
association between mortality and rates of infection or hypoglycemia.
There was a higher incidence of CDC-defined health care–associated infections, specifically 
catheter-associated bloodstream infections, in the lower-target group than in the higher-
target group. However, there was no significant between-group difference in the overall 
incidence of culture-positive infection, according to definitions reported in previous studies

 of tight glucose control.5,6 Although a higher incidence of bloodstream infections might be 
biologically plausible, given the greater frequency of glucose testing in the lower-target 
group, the overall profile of infectious outcomes is unexplained.
The strengths of the trial include 35 recruiting sites, explicit methods to control glucose and 
limit hypoglycemia, extensive standardized training of clinicians, and remote support with 
continuous quality monitoring from the Clinical Coordinating Center. Thus, the protocol was 
explicit and reproducible, and the rate of adherence to the protocol was high. Glucose 
control was achieved quickly after randomization, with significant separation in glucose 
levels between the groups for almost 3 weeks. The rates of severe hypoglycemia were low, 
as compared with other studies of tight glucose control.2,4,5,6
The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that targeting a blood glucose level of 
80 to 110 mg per deciliter would be superior to consensus recommendations from published 
critical care and endocrine societies (blood glucose levels of 150 to 180 mg per deciliter,34 
140 to 180 mg per deciliter [7.8 to 10.0 mmol per liter],35 and 140 to 200 mg per deciliter 
[7.8 to 11.1 mmol per liter]36). Our survey of pediatric intensivists indicated that there was 
equipoise between higher-target and lower-target ranges, that the use of a “no glycemic 
control” group was unacceptable, and that intensivists were not willing to infuse dextrose to 
elevate the glucose level intentionally above 150 mg per deciliter. Thus, the trial was a 
practical, replicable test of insulin therapy that was targeted to two ranges in an enriched 
population of critically ill children with hyperglycemia, rather than a glycemic clamp trial 
comparing glycemia at two ranges. The difference in glycemia that was observed between 
the lower-target group and the higher-target group (109 vs. 123 mg per deciliter) was similar 
to that observed in previous multicenter trials involving children (107 vs. 114 mg per 
deciliter [5.9 vs. 6.3 mmol per liter]6 and 112 vs. 121 mg per deciliter [6.2 vs. 6.7 mmol per 
liter]7), although it was less pronounced than the between-group difference in a single-center 
trial (113 vs. 158 mg per deciliter [6.3 vs. 8.8 mmol per liter]5) in which early parenteral 
nutrition was routine and conventional treatment was associated with a higher incidence of 
hyperglycemia.
Our results are consistent with those from other multicenter trials involving other critically 
ill children. The SPECS (Safe Pediatric Euglycemia in Cardiac Surgery) trial7 and the CHiP 
(Control of Hyperglycaemia in Paediatric Intensive Care) trial6 showed no significant 
differences in ICU length of stay or mortality among children who had undergone cardiac 
surgery or in children who had not undergone cardiac surgery. The CHiP trial showed that 
among patients who had not undergone cardiac surgery, the mean 12-month health care costs 
were lower in the group that was assigned to a lower target blood glucose range than in the 
group that was assigned to conventional glycemic control, a finding that was most likely 
attributable to a shorter hospital stay for the index admission among those assigned to the 
lower target. Notably, the hospital length of stay in our trial did not differ significantly 
between treatment groups.
Our results differ from those of a single-center study conducted in Leuven, Belgium,5 that 
showed substantially lower mortality, a shorter length of stay in the ICU, and a lower rate of 
infections with tight glucose control to lower glucose targets than to higher glucose targets,

 despite a significantly higher rate of severe hypoglycemia. Our study did not show any of 
these benefits, and the patients had less hypoglycemia overall, but the average glucose level 
in the higher-target group in our study was lower than the level in the higher-target group in 
the single-center study. In studies involving adults, an explanation for similar incongruities 
relates to differences in site-specific practices regarding parenteral nutrition.37 More recent 
findings in critically ill children indicate that the early initiation of parenteral nutrition leads 
to poorer outcomes than later initiation.38 The patients in the current study had a lower 
prevalence of parenteral nutrition than did those included in the trial conducted in Leuven.5
We ultimately planned for 1414 patients to be enrolled and to undergo randomization, on the 
basis of revised power calculations for 80% power, but the study was stopped after the first 
interim analysis, at 50% enrollment, because the data indicated a low likelihood of benefit 
and evidence of the possibility of harm (e.g., the non-significantly higher mortality, the 
health care–associated infection profile, and the risk of severe hypoglycemia) in the lower-
target group. A conditional power analysis indicated that continuation of the trial had a 
negligible potential (1% chance) of arriving at a different conclusion.
The study used continuous monitoring and a computerized algorithm to minimize the 
incidence, severity, and duration of hypoglycemia, which is the most important risk of 
glycemic control. As in the SPECS trial, our study showed a low rate of severe 
hypoglycemia. Unlike in the SPECS trial, nearly half the episodes of severe hypoglycemia 
(11 of 25 patients) in our trial were judged to be unrelated to insulin infusion but to be 
related rather to underlying illness or the abrupt discontinuation of caloric supply.
Our study has certain limitations. First, informed consent was obtained only after 
hyperglycemia was confirmed, which created a delay between the onset and treatment of 
hyperglycemia. Second, it was not possible for the bedside team to be unaware of the study-
group assignment. Concern for bias was mitigated by the explicitly defined intervention and 
primary outcome. Third, in order to compare two tight glucose-control targets within the 
range of usual care, we did not include a third group in which hyperglycemia was not 
treated. Thus, the two study groups had explicitly managed glucose and insulin adjustment.
In conclusion, in this multicenter, randomized trial involving a population of patients who 
had not undergone cardiac surgery, we found no significant between-group difference in the 
number of ICU-free days (or 28-day hospital mortality–adjusted ICU length of stay) or in 
any secondary outcomes when tight glycemic control with insulin administered to achieve a 
target blood glucose range of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter was compared with a target range of 
150 to 180 mg per deciliter in critically ill children with hyperglycemia who had 
cardiovascular or respiratory failure. Significant differences in glycemia and insulin dose 
were observed. We conclude that in an enriched population of critically ill children with 
hyperglycemia, a blood glucose target of 150 to 180 mg per deciliter was associated with 
clinical outcomes that were similar to outcomes with a target of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter, 
with a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

 Figure 1. Assessment, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Patients
The informed-consent rate was 50% (825 of 1662 patients). Only patients with a measured 
blood glucose level greater than 130 mg per deciliter were assessed for exclusion criteria. 
Two additional patients underwent randomization and were in the study when it was stopped 
early; these patients are not included in the analyses according to the stipulation of the data 
and safety monitoring board. Additional details are provided in Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.

 Figure 2. Glucose, Insulin, and Nutrition Levels, According to Study Group
Daily data are for the first 8 study days (the median duration of stay in the intensive care 
unit). Panel A shows time-weighted glucose averages obtained from a linear interpolation of 
the glucose values that were used to administer the tight-glycemic-control protocol. Open 
bars indicate either the value used to qualify for the study (Qual) or a partial study day (day 
0, the day of randomization), and shaded bars indicate full study days (midnight to 11:59 
p.m.). To convert values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. Panel B 
shows the median time-weighted average glucose level over the entire study period. Panel C 
shows the daily total insulin delivery, Panel D the daily glucose-infusion rates, Panel E the 
daily percentage of total nutrition given enterally, and Panel F the daily total nutrition. In 
each panel, the boxes represent the interquartile range, and the horizontal lines the median. P

*To convert values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551.
†For hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, P values for the comparison between treatment groups were calculated with the use of logistic regression 
with adjustment for age group and PRISM III-12 score. For other variables, P values were calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum or 
Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, in the per-protocol population.
‡Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a blood glucose level below 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter), and any hypoglycemia as a blood 
glucose level below 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter). Hypoglycemia was considered by the investigators to be related or unrelated to insulin 
administration according to prospectively defined criteria.16 Patients may have had both unrelated and related hypoglycemia events, so the sums of 
the values in those categories may exceed the overall total.
§Hypokalemia was defined as a potassium level below 2.5 mmol per liter.

*P values for the comparison between treatment groups were calculated with the use of proportional-hazards, linear, or logistic regression with 
adjustment for age group and PRISM III-12 score, as appropriate, except where noted.
†Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores range from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome.
‡Owing to zero counts or low event frequency, the P value was calculated with the use of exact Poisson regression.
§All infections include health care–associated infection as well as upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. tracheitis), lower respiratory tract infection 
not associated with ventilator (e.g. pneumonia), bloodstream infection not associated with catheter, colitis, urinary tract infection not associated 
with a urinary catheter, other wound infection, abdominal abscess, empyema, meningitis, and neck abscess.
