Purpose:
To compare the prognostic importance (time to major adverse car-
diovascular event [MACE]) of combined computed tomography (CT) 
angiography and CT myocardial stress perfusion imaging with that 
of combined invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and stress single 
photon emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging.
Materials and 
Methods:
This study was approved by all institutional review boards, and 
written informed consent was obtained. Between November 2009 
and July 2011, 381 participants clinically referred for ICA and aged 
45–85 years were enrolled in the Combined Noninvasive Coronary 
Angiography and Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Using 320-Detector 
Row Computed Tomography (CORE320) prospective multicenter 
diagnostic study. All images were analyzed in blinded independent 
core laboratories, and a panel of physicians adjudicated all adverse 
events. MACE was defined as revascularization (.30 days after in-
dex ICA), myocardial infarction, or cardiac death; hospitalization for 
chest pain or congestive heart failure; or arrhythmia. Late MACE 
was defined similarly, except for patients who underwent revascu-
larization within the first 182 days after ICA, who were excluded. 
Comparisons of 2-year survival (time to MACE) used standard Ka-
plan-Meier curves and restricted mean survival times bootstrapped 
with 2000 replicates.
Results:
An MACE (49 revascularizations, five myocardial infarctions, one 
cardiac death, nine hospitalizations for chest pain or congestive 
heart failure, and one arrhythmia) occurred in 51 of 379 patients 
(13.5%). The 2-year MACE-free rates for combined CT angiog-
raphy and CT perfusion findings were 94% negative for coronary 
artery disease (CAD) versus 82% positive for CAD and were simi-
lar to combined ICA and single photon emission CT findings (93% 
negative for CAD vs 77% positive for CAD, P , .001 for both). 
Event-free rates for CT angiography and CT perfusion versus ICA 
and single photon emission CT for either positive or negative re-
sults were not significantly different for MACE or late MACE (P . 
.05 for all). The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) for combined CT angiography and CT perfusion (AUC 
= 68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 62, 75) was similar (P = .36) to 
that for combined ICA and single photon emission CT (AUC = 71; 
95% CI: 65, 79) in the identification of MACE at 2-year follow-up.
Conclusion:
Combined CT angiography and CT perfusion enables similar pre-
diction of 2-year MACE, late MACE, and event-free survival similar 
to that enabled by ICA and single photon emission CT.

Chen et al
12-lead electrocardiography are the 
most important noninvasive tools in the 
diagnosis and management of CAD. Di-
rect validation of angiographic measure-
ments of coronary stenosis and athero-
sclerotic plaque burden with computed 
tomography (CT) on a vessel-by-vessel 
and segment-by-segment basis has 
been established by using histopathol-
ogy, intravascular ultrasonography, or 
both (5–9). However, in addition to 
diagnostic accuracy, the effectiveness 
of noninvasive strategies to diagnose 
and monitor CAD should demonstrate 
similar or superior ability to predict 
future adverse events as compared 
with the most commonly used clinical 
technologies in medical practice. Inva-
sive coronary angiography (ICA) yields 
important information on the progno-
sis of patients with CAD (10,11). Prior 
studies have shown higher risk of mor-
tality in patients who have multivessel 
having CAD, those who received only 
medical therapy fared just as well as 
those who underwent coronary revas-
cularization. In addition, the Fractional 
Flow 
Reserve 
Versus 
Angiography 
for Multivessel Evaluation (or FAME) 
study, which incorporated the use of 
fractional flow reserve along with in-
vasive coronary angiography (ICA) 
to guide coronary revascularization, 
showed improved patient outcomes in 
the fractional flow reserve guided treat-
ment arm (3). The FAME2 study also 
showed that revascularization of a he-
modynamically significant stenosis and 
optimal medical therapy were superior 
to optimal medical therapy alone (4). 
Moreover, in patients without hemo-
dynamically significant stenosis in the 
FAME2 study, optimal medical therapy 
alone resulted in very good patient out-
comes, regardless of the angiographic 
appearance of the stenosis (4). These 
studies suggest that understanding 
of the hemodynamic significance of 
atherosclerotic lesions via additional 
assessment of myocardial perfusion 
should play a greater role in directing 
therapy to optimize patient outcomes.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The 2-year major adverse cardio-
vascular event (MACE)-free rates 
for combined CT angiography 
and CT perfusion findings were 
94% negative for coronary artery 
disease (CAD) versus 82% posi-
tive for CAD (P , .001) and 
were similar to those for com-
bined ICA and single photon 
emission CT (93% negative for 
CAD vs 77% positive for CAD) 
(P , .001).
 
n MACE-free rates for CT angiog-
raphy and CT perfusion versus 
those for ICA and single photon 
emission CT for either positive 
or negative results were not sig-
nificantly different from those for 
MACE or late MACE (P . .05 
for all).
 
n The overall area under the re-
ceiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) of combined CT 
angiography and CT perfusion 
(AUC = 68; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 62, 75]) and of 
combined ICA and single photon 
emission CT (AUC = 71; 95% CI: 
65, 79]) in the identification of 
MACE at 2-year follow-up were 
similar  
(P = .36).
 
n A significant difference in survival 
was observed between patients 
without hemodynamically ob-
structive stenosis and those with 
three vessels containing hemody-
namically obstructive coronary 
stenoses for combined CT angi-
ography and CT perfusion (P , 
.001) and combined ICA and 
single photon emission CT  
(P = .007).
Implications for Patient Care
 
n When looking at anatomic pre-
dictors alone, a significant differ-
ence in survival was noted 
between those with and those 
without obstructive CAD at both 
invasive assessment and noninva-
sive assessment.
 
n Understanding the hemodynamic 
significance of atherosclerotic 
lesions via additional assessment 
of myocardial perfusion should 
play a greater role in directing 
therapy to optimize patient 
outcomes.
 
n A purely noninvasive anatomic 
and physiologic assessment via 
CT angiography and myocardial 
perfusion is adequate to identify 
patients with a MACE at 2-year 
follow-up in symptomatic 
patients suspected of having 
CAD.
C
oronary artery disease (CAD) is 
the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide (1). The care 
of patients with CAD has evolved rap-
idly over the past decade. The Courage 
study showed that not all patients with 
coronary artery stenosis benefit from 
coronary revascularization (2). In fact,

times (RMSTs) (20); standard errors 
were estimated with the bootstrap 
method with 2000 replicates and resa-
mpling at the patient level. Bootstrap-
ping at the patient level accommodates 
within-patient correlation due to the 
fact that each patient underwent im-
aging with both modalities. The RMST 
is calculated as the area under the Ka-
plan-Meier curve, and it can be inter-
preted as the expected time of event-
free survival within 2 years after ICA. 
To determine whether CT angiography 
and ICA can yield additional informa-
tion when adjusted for standard risk 
factors, a series of Cox proportional 
hazard models were used to compute 
hazard ratios for a base model and 
then for each imaging modality alone 
and together. The base model included 
age, coronary artery calcium score, 
history of myocardial infarction, prior 
congestive heart failure, and coronary 
artery bypass within 30 days of enroll-
ment. Each variable in the base model 
was tested for linear time dependency. 
Similar comparisons were also made 
for subgroups with and those without 
previous CAD, as well as the number of 
obstructive coronary arteries (zero to 
three vessels). Area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
was used as a measure of diagnostic 
power. The reference standard was 
defined as occurrence of a MACE by 2 
years after ICA. Two events that were 
captured during follow-up but occurred 
after 2 years were excluded from the 
Kaplan-Meier curves and their compar-
isons but were included in the Cox pro-
portional hazards models.
Combined CT angiography and CT 
perfusion and combined ICA and sin-
gle photon emission CT were defined as 
positive for disease if at least one ves-
sel had stenosis of 50% or more with 
a corresponding perfusion defect (sum 
stress score) (17) of two or more at CT 
perfusion or one or more at single pho-
ton emission CT. In the AUC analyses, 
CT angiography, CT perfusion, ICA, 
and single photon emission CT were 
modeled as continuous variables, with 
the corresponding Leaman score also 
included in the model. In Cox propor-
tional hazard models, CAD severity at 
National Institutes of Health. The study 
was approved by a central institutional 
review board, as well as by local insti-
tutional review boards, and all patients 
provided written informed consent. The 
study design included complete medi-
cal history, coronary CT angiography, 
adenosine stress CT perfusion, single 
photon emission CT myocardial perfu-
sion, and ICA. All noninvasive imaging 
was performed before ICA. Images 
were interpreted in central core labora-
tories by readers who were blinded to 
clinical history and to each other’s find-
ings. All image acquisition and interpre-
tation methods have been described in 
detail previously (15–17,19).
End Points and Follow-up
The primary end point was MACE at 
2 years. MACE was defined as a com-
posite of cardiac death, myocardial in-
farction, hospitalization for chest pain 
or congestive heart failure, late revascu-
larization (.30 days after index ICA), 
or arrhythmia. Late MACE was defined 
similarly, except for the exclusion of 
revascularizations occurring within the 
first 182 days after ICA.
Follow-up assessments were per-
formed 30 days and 6, 12, and 24 
months after ICA. Data were obtained 
at office visits, via telephone inter-
views, or with a standardized question-
naire sent by mail. The questionnaire 
assessed death, myocardial infarction, 
hospitalization, new or unstable angina, 
congestive heart failure, percutaneous 
intervention, coronary artery bypass 
surgery, and current medications. All 
events were adjudicated by a commit-
tee of cardiologists (M.Y.C., C.E.R., 
A.A., R.T.G., J.M.M., A.E.A., J.A.B., 
J.A.C.L.) and a radiologist (M.D.), all 
of whom were board certified with 10 
or more years of experience in medi-
cine. Non-English medical records were 
translated to English for adjudication.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were compared 
with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or x2 
test, as appropriate. Unadjusted com-
parisons of the distribution of 2-year 
survival used standard Kaplan-Meier 
curves and restricted mean survival 
CAD as compared with those who have 
single-artery disease (10,11). Similarly, 
data from noninvasive CT coronary an-
giography have established increased 
mortality in patients with three-vessel 
and left main CAD compared with pa-
tients with one- or two-vessel disease 
(12,13). Conversely, absence of CAD 
at CT angiography is associated with a 
low annualized risk of cardiac mortality 
(,0.02% per year) (14). In this regard, 
previous studies from four different pa-
tient populations suggest that the ana-
tomic information from CT angiography 
has prognostic importance similar to 
that of ICA (10–13).
However, a critical step in the care 
of patients with CAD is to establish the 
prognosis of functionally important le-
sions, which will be used to determine 
the most appropriate treatment (3,4). 
Thus, the principal aim of this study 
was to compare the prognostic impor-
tance (time to major adverse cardio-
vascular event [MACE]) of combined 
CT angiography and CT myocardial 
stress perfusion imaging with that of 
combined ICA and stress single pho-
ton emission CT myocardial perfusion 
imaging.

hemodynamically obstructive coronary 
artery stenosis (50% stenosis with 
combined CT angiography and CT per-
fusion and 1.896 years for combined 
ICA and single photon emission CT 
CT angiography and ICA was defined 
as an ordinal variable (0, no disease; 
1, ,50% stenosis; 2, single-vessel

perfusion sum stress score and single 
photon emission CT sum stress score 
were modeled as continuous variables.
Results
The CORE320 prospective multicenter 
study enrolled 381 patients who had 
been clinically referred for ICA and 
were aged 45–85 years. Overall, 379 
participants (99.5%) underwent all 
imaging tests, including coronary CT 
angiography, adenosine stress CT per-
fusion, single photon emission CT, and 
ICA and had complete 2-year follow-up 
data. Baseline characteristics are pro-
vided in Table 1. Within the 2-year 
follow-up period, a MACE (49 late re-
vascularizations [.30 days after index 
coronary catheterization], five myocar-
dial infarctions, one cardiac death, nine 
hospitalizations for chest pain or con-
gestive heart failure, and one arrhyth-
mia) occurred in 51 (13.5%) of 379 
patients. Similarly, within the 2-year 
follow-up period, late MACE (24 late 
revascularizations [.182 days after in-
dex coronary catheterization], five myo-
cardial infarctions, one cardiac death, 
nine hospitalizations for chest pain or 
congestive heart failure, and one ar-
rhythmia) occurred in 32 (8.4%) of 379 
patients. Follow-up data were not avail-
able in two patients.

CARDIAC IMAGING: The CORE320 Multicenter Study 
Chen et al
The AUC for CT angiography alone 
in the prediction of MACE at 2-year fol-
low-up was 65 (95% CI: 60, 70). When 
CT perfusion was added to the CT an-
giography model, AUC improved to 68 
(95% CI: 62, 75); however, there was 
not a significant difference between 
the AUC of CT angiography and that 
of combined CT angiography and CT 
perfusion (P = .31). Similarly, a signif-
icant difference was not found in AUC 
between ICA alone (AUC = 73 [95% 
CI: 68, 77]) and ICA and single pho-
ton emission CT (AUC = 71 [95% CI: 
65, 79]) in the prediction of MACE (P 
= .63). The AUCs for combined CT an-
giography and CT perfusion (AUC = 68; 
95% CI: 62, 75) and for combined ICA 
and single photon emission CT (AUC = 
71, 95% CI: 65, 79) in the prediction 
of MACE were similar (Table 2; Fig 3, 
 A). A significant difference was not 
found between the AUC of combined 
CT angiography and CT perfusion and 
the AUC of combined ICA and single 
photon emission CT in the prediction of 
MACE (P = .36, Table 2).
Combined CT angiography and CT 
perfusion did not enable us to iden-
tify eight cases in which the patient 
Having a greater number of he-
modynamically obstructive coronary 
arteries at combined CT angiography 
and CT perfusion and at combined 
ICA and single photon emission CT 
was associated with poorer survival. In 
patients who had no vessels with he-
modynamically obstructive CAD, the 
2-year MACE-free survival rates were 
94% and 93%, respectively, at CT an-
giography and ICA, whereas MACE-
free survival rates were 67% and 63% 
(Fig 2, A and B), respectively, at CT 
angiography and ICA in patients with 
three-vessel disease. At combined CT 
angiography and CT perfusion and at 
combined ICA and single photon emis-
sion CT, a significant difference in sur-
vival was observed between patients 
without hemodynamically obstructive 
stenosis (94% vs 82% [P , .001]) and 
those with three vessels containing he-
modynamically obstructive coronary 
stenosis (93% vs 77% [P = .007]). He-
modynamically significant one-vessel 
CAD and two-vessel CAD had inter-
mediate MACE-free survival rates for

for ICA and single photon emission CT

tively, with a difference of 4.8% (Table

were 1.751 years and 1.700 years, re-

ences in RMST were noted between 
patients with and those without he-

of MACE-free survival or RMST in pa-
tients without hemodynamically ob-
structive coronary artery stenoses (P = 
.42 for event-free survival, P = .27 for 
RMST; Table 2), in patients with ob-
structive lesions, differences in event-
free survival significantly favored com-
bined ICA and single photon emission 
CT (P = .047) (Table 2; Fig 1, A).

both, Table 2). Significant differences 
in event-free survival and RMST were 
noted between patients with and those 
without hemodynamically obstructive 
coronary artery stenosis at combined 
CT angiography and CT perfusion and 
at combined ICA and single photon 
emission CT. However, although no 
significant difference was found in the 
ability of combined CT angiography 
and CT perfusion to enable prediction 
of MACE-free survival in patients with-
out hemodynamically obstructive coro-
nary artery stenoses when compared 
with that of combined ICA and single 
photon emission CT (P = .62 for event-
free survival, P = .50 for RMST; Table 
2), in patients with obstructive lesions, 
differences were of borderline signifi-
cance and favored combined ICA and 
single photon emission CT in terms of 
2-year event-free survival of 97% and 
96%, respectively, with a difference of 
0.9% (Table 2; Fig 1, B). The presence 
of hemodynamically obstructive coro-
nary artery stenosis (50% stenosis 
with corresponding perfusion defect) 
was associated with poorer (P , .01 
for CT angiography and CT perfusion, 
P , .01 for ICA and single photon 
emission CT) 20-year MACE-free sur-
vival rates of 89% for CT angiography 
and CT perfusion and 85% for ICA 
and single photon emission CT, with 
a difference of 3.3% (Table 2). RMSTs 
for the groups were 1.967 and 1.955 
years for absence of stenosis at CT 
angiography and CT perfusion and at 
ICA and single photon emission CT, re-
spectively. Presence of stenosis yielded 
significantly lower RMSTs of 1.887 and 
1.859 at CT angiography and CT per-
fusion and at ICA and single photon 
had a subsequent MACE. In six (75%) 
cases, findings were interpreted as 
positive for disease at CT angiogra-
phy and as negative for disease at CT 
perfusion. In one (13%) case, findings 
were deemed negative at both CT an-
giography and CT perfusion (Table 3). 
 
Similarly, combined ICA and single 
photon emission CT did not enable 
us to identify nine cases with MACE: 
four (44%) in which findings were 
positive at ICA and negative at single 
photon emission CT and four (44%) 
in which findings were negative at ICA 
and negative at single photon emis-
sion CT (Table 3).

added to the CT angiography model, 
the AUC improved to 69 (95% CI: 63, 
79); however, there was not a signifi-
cant difference between the AUC of 
CT angiography and that of combined 
CT angiography and CT perfusion (P = 
.39). Similarly, a significant difference 
was not found in AUC between ICA 
alone (AUC = 72; 95% CI: 67, 77) and 
combined ICA and single photon emis-
sion CT (AUC = 71; 95% CI: 64, 80) in 
perfusion and at combined ICA and

in patients with three-vessel disease, 
event-free survival rates were 87% and 
73%, respectively (Fig 2, C and D). 
Hemodynamically significant one- and 
two-vessel CAD had intermediate rates 
of late MACE for CT angiography and

and ICA severity were included in the 
same model, ICA severity remained 
significant (HR, 1.354; 95% CI: 1.069, 
1.716). CT angiography and ICA re-
mained significant predictors when CT

when added to the base model (HR, 
1.304; 95% CI: 1.020, 1.669); however, 
CT angiography did not maintain sig-
nificance when ICA, CT perfusion, and

to the base model (HR, 1.059; 95% CI:

Discussion
We report an overall composite event 
rate of 13.5% at 2-year follow-up in 
this prospective multicenter study of 
prediction of late MACE (P = .75,

Relative Contributions of Anatomic and 
Physiologic Predictors of MACE
A significant hazard ratio (HR) was 
found for CT angiography severity 
(HR,1.252; 95% CI: 1.028, 1.526) 
and ICA severity (HR, 1.395; 95%

were similar (Table 2; Fig 3, B). No dif-

of MACE and late MACE with propor-
tional hazard models. Invasive fractional 
flow reserve studies primarily are used 
to determine the functional importance 
of coronary stenoses at conventional 
invasive angiography (23). This tech-
nique was validated against single pho-
ton emission CT but remains limited in 
availability and clinical use worldwide 
because it requires crossing the sus-
pected coronary stenosis with a wire to 
measure distal pressure during infusion 
of adenosine-induced hyperemia. Thus, 
the approach entails cardiac catheter-
ization and decision making at a time 
when the patient is sedated and already 
undergoing an invasive procedure; thus, 
he or she is largely unable to objectively 
participate in the decision to forgo or 
proceed with revascularization. Our re-
sults suggest that the combined CT an-
giography and CT perfusion approach 
is a noninvasive method with which to 
assess the presence and hemodynamic 
significance of coronary stenoses. This 
approach has prognostic power sim-
ilar to that of single photon emission 
CT and ICA in the prediction of clinical 
events.
Theoretically, CT fractional flow re-
serve and related methods can be used 
to determine the functional significance 
of coronary stenosis at rest (24,25). 
Such approaches, while promising, are 
sophisticated and expensive and have 
not yet been shown to enable prediction 
of future morbidity and mortality. The 
presence of coronary calcification in 
association with atherosclerosis signif-
icantly limits the ability of CT methods 
that use direct visualization of the epi-
cardial coronary lumen to help us as-
sess severity. Coronary calcium level 
can also affect the accuracy with which 
CT fractional flow reserve can be used 
to determine the vessel boundaries; 
thus, it can influence the functional 
evaluation of coronary stenosis. CT per-
fusion is not affected by the presence or 
absence of coronary calcium. However, 
as emerging technologies, both new CT 
techniques have the potential to signifi-
cantly improve the diagnostic approach 
in patients suspected of having CAD.
Our study had limitations. In the in-
terpretation of our results, we included 
or more minutes are needed for single 
photon emission CT depending on the 
acquisition protocol. The angiographic 
prognostic power of CT angiography 
is preserved when compared with that 
of ICA, and the addition of myocardial 
perfusion enhances the ability to distin-
guish patients with a high MACE-free 
survival rate from those who will expe-
rience major cardiac complications in 
the subsequent 2 years. Ischemic bur-
den, evaluated indirectly as the number 
of vessels containing coronary stenoses 
or measured directly as the extent of a 
myocardial perfusion defect downstream 
from a coronary atherosclerotic plaque, 
relates to the probability that the patient 
will experience untoward cardiovascular 
events (21). In the United States and 
abroad, single photon emission CT re-
mains the most commonly used modality 
to assess the extent and severity of myo-
cardial ischemia with proven prognostic 
value. Thus, combined single photon 
emission CT and ICA is the most used 
combination of technologies selected to 
depict the presence of obstructive CAD 
in current clinical practice.
Linde et al (22) have previously 
reported that CT perfusion yielded in-
cremental prognostic power over the 
Diamond and Forrester score in the 
prediction of MACE in patients with 
low risk of unstable angina pectoris. In 
our study, we report the effect of the 
addition of myocardial perfusion to an-
giography in the prediction of MACE or 
late MACE was minimal for combined 
CT angiography and CT perfusion and 
for ICA and single photon emission CT 
in both AUC and proportional hazard 
analyses. In the combined CT angiogra-
phy and CT perfusion analysis, the AUC 
improved from 65 (95% CI: 60, 70) to 
68 (95% CI: 62, 75) when CT perfusion 
was added to the model; however, the 
improvement in AUC was not signifi-
cant. Similarly, a significant difference 
in AUC was not found between ICA 
alone (AUC = 73; 95% CI: 68, 77) and 
combined ICA and single photon emis-
sion CT (AUC = 71; 95% CI: 65, 79) in 
the prediction of MACE. However, when 
modeled alone, CT angiography, CT 
perfusion, single photon emission CT, 
and ICA were all significant predictors 
379 symptomatic patients referred for 
conventional 
coronary 
angiography 
and who underwent CT angiography, 
stress CT perfusion, and single pho-
ton emission CT before ICA. Previous 
studies have reported on the prognostic 
value of CT angiography alone or ICA 
alone in the prediction of MACE; how-
ever, those studies were limited since 
they did not have prognostic data for 
both CT angiography and ICA from the 
same patient at virtually the same time 
(mean, 9.2 days 6 11.4 between tests 
in our study) (11–14). When we looked 
at anatomic predictors alone, a signif-
icant difference was noted in survival 
between those with and those without 
obstructive CAD at both CT angiog-
raphy and ICA. Moreover, in patients 
without obstructive CAD, there was 
not a significant difference in survival 
between invasive versus noninvasive 
assessment. Similarly, in the combined 
anatomic and physiologic predictive ap-
proaches, a significant difference was 
noted in survival between those with 
and those without hemodynamically 
obstructive CAD at combined CT angi-
ography and CT perfusion and at com-
bined ICA and single photon emission 
CT; however, there was no significant 
difference in the identification of pa-
tients with or without hemodynamically 
obstructive CAD when we used either 
the invasive method or the noninvasive 
method. The number of vessels identi-
fied with obstructive CAD is associated 
with poorer survival by both anatomic 
predictors alone, as well as by com-
bined anatomic and physiologic predic-
tors. Thus, the presence of myocardial 
ischemia in association with anatomic 
obstruction entails worse prognosis in 
patients with symptomatic CAD.
Our ensemble of findings clearly 
shows that a purely noninvasive ana-
tomic and physiologic assessment is 
adequate in the assessment of patients 
suspected of having CAD. Differences 
between CAD and ICA that cannot be 
excluded by the data are given as CIs in 
Table 2. The median procedure time for 
combined CT angiography and CT per-
fusion was 34 minutes, whereas historic 
data show 30 minutes are needed for 
diagnostic invasive angiography and 120

for which a patient suspected of hav-
ing CAD was referred to the ICA. We 
excluded events that occurred within 
30 days after the index event because 
those relate directly to clinical decision 
making at the time of the index event 
that led to ICA. We did not require in-
vasive fractional flow reserve because 
all these patients underwent single 
photon emission CT before ICA and be-
cause the single photon emission CT re-
sults were available to the clinical team. 
Furthermore, fractional flow reserve is 
not routinely performed currently, and 
it was conducted even less frequently 
during the time of patient recruitment. 
However, one strength of this study was 
the use of distinct core laboratories for 
all angiographic and myocardial per-
fusion measurements that were per-
formed with blinding to all other clin-
ical and phenotypic characterizations. 
Moreover, all comparative analyses 
were performed by an independent bio-
statistical core group.
In conclusion, the combination of 
CT angiography and CT myocardial 
perfusion yields similar prediction of 
2-year MACE-free survival, including 
the need for myocardial revasculari-
zation procedures in comparison with 
standard ICA and single photon emis-
sion CT perfusion imaging.
