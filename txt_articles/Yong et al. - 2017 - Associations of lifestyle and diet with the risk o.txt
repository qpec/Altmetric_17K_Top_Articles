Abstract 
Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a commonly diagnosed cancer in Southeast Asia. Many stud-
ies have examined the risk factors for NPC, yet the roles of some risk factors remain inconclusive. The purpose of 
this study was to examine associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and the risk of NPC in the Singaporean 
population.
Methods: We conducted a case–control study in Singapore with 300 patients and 310 controls who were recruited 
between 2008 and 2012. Each control was selected and individually matched to each patient based on sex, ethnicity, 
and age (±5 years). A total of 290 pairs of cases and controls were matched successfully. We examined lifestyle factors 
such as tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, various salted and preserved food consumption, and weaning practices.
Results: After adjusting for covariates, multivariate analysis showed that those participants who were current smok-
ers and had ever smoked tobacco had a higher risk of NPC than participants who had never smoked, with odds ratios 
(ORs) of 4.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58–7.86; P < 0.001) and 2.52 (95% CI 1.54–4.12; P < 0.001), respectively. 
Those who consumed salted vegetables at least once a week also showed a significantly increased risk of NPC than 
those who never or rarely consumed salted vegetables, with an OR of 4.18 (95% CI 1.69–10.38; P = 0.002).
Conclusion: Smoking (currently and ever-smoked) and consuming salted vegetables once a week or more were 
lifestyle risk factors for NPC, and changes of these factors for the better may reduce the risk of NPC.

Background
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a commonly diag-
nosed cancer in Southeast Asia. Indeed, NPC is endemic 
in China (especially South China, Hong Kong, and Tai-
wan) and Southeast Asia countries such as Malaysia and 
the Philippines. For example, in 2010, South China was 
reported to have an age-standardized rate (ASR) of inci-
dence of 2.44 per 100,000 people and an ASR of mortal-
ity of 1.18 per 100,000 people [1]; the Philippines was 
reported to have an ASR of incidence of 1.79 per 100,000 
people [2]. In Singapore, NPC is most commonly diag-
nosed in men; in 2012, the ASR of incidence of NPC 
reported in men was 8.8 per 100,000 people [3].
Numerous studies have been conducted in Southeast 
Asia to identify risk factors related to the development of 
NPC [4–14]. Some of these studies suggested that NPC 
results from an interaction of genetic and environmen-
tal factors [7, 10, 11, 15]. Studies conducted in a Chinese 
population in Hong Kong, China found that over 90% of 
people younger than 35 years consumed salted fish dur-
ing childhood and that they have continued to consume 
salted fish throughout adulthood [11, 16]. In addition, 
studies of the Chinese population in China reported 
that multiple food items, including preserved and fer-
mented foods, were significantly associated with NPC

during weaning and children exposure before 2 years of 
age [12]. Furthermore, risk factors such as occupational 
exposure to smoke and dust [15] and genetic variants [7] 
were shown to be associated with NPC. In 1994, Lee et al. 
[10] studied Singaporean Chinese patients with NPC 
who were younger than 45 years and found an increased 
risk of NPC in adults who frequently consumed salted 
food. In 2006, a Singaporean Chinese cohort study found 
that smoking duration, smoking intensity, age of smok-
ing initiation, and alcohol consumption were strongly 
associated with an increased risk of other oropharyngeal 
carcinomas; however, they found that the association of 
these factors with NPC was rather weak, except for those 
who had smoked for 40 or more years [17]. This previous 
cohort study did not specifically focus on the risk factors 
for NPC in a Singaporean population, and the non-signif-
icant finding was likely the result of the small sample size 
of NPC cases.
Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption have been 
widely studied in Southeast Asia [7, 15, 18, 19] and in 
Western countries such as the United States [20–22] and 
Italy [23], with no consistent relationships found between 
lifestyle factors and the risk of NPC. Although many stud-
ies have reported inconsistent results, in 2012 the World 
Health Organization (WHO) reported that tobacco use 
was an established risk factor for many cancer types, 
including NPC [24]. However, the relative importance of 
tobacco exposure in different NPC histologic subtypes 
remains largely unexplored [25–27], and additional pro-
spective studies are needed. Because of smoking’s modi-
fiable nature and causal relationship in the development 
of various cancers, it is an important lifestyle risk factor 
to target. In 2012, WHO in the Western Pacific region 
reported that China (which is a high-risk area for NPC) 
had more than 300 million smokers—one-third of the 
world’s total [28]. In our study, we postulated that given 
the higher incidence of smoking as countries (e.g., China) 
become further developed, given the increased accessi-
bility of treatment, given the rapid aging of populations, 
and given the increasing median age of survival, the bur-
den of cancer (prevalence) will increase.
The nitrosamines in tobacco are known to be active 
carcinogenic metabolites that cause DNA damage and 
chronic inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa [25]. 
Organs in direct contact with smoke—the oral cavity, 
esophagus, and lungs—have high risks of developing can-
cer. Similarly, the nasopharynx, which is located between 
the nasal cavity and the larynx, is also directly exposed 
to tobacco smoke. As tobacco smoking is a modifiable 
risk factor, indeed, 30% of all cancers reported in the 
United States could be prevented if smoking were elimi-
nated [29]. Tobacco contains carcinogens that may inter-
act with other exposures, such as alcohol, resulting in an 
increased risk of cancer [29]. Therefore, smoking ces-
sation is the single most important and effective way to 
reduce a person’s risk of cancer [29, 30].
In the present study, we examined the lifestyle fac-
tors (smoking, alcohol consumption, various salted and 
preserved food consumption, pre-chewing of food, and 
weaning practices) involved in the development of NPC 
in the Singaporean population. Since Singapore is a high-
risk area for the development of NPC, studying the risk 
factors in this population provides more data for future 
studies of NPC in other Southeast Asian countries. The 
National Cancer Centre of Singapore (NCCS) is the 
country’s largest tertiary referral center for NPC patients; 
as such, NPC patients recruited from there are represent-
ative of all Singaporean patients diagnosed with NPC.
Patients and methods
Study population
Between 2008 and 2012, 300 patients between 21 and 
80 years of age who were Singaporeans or permanent 
residents of Singapore were recruited from the NCCS. 
All patients were newly diagnosed with histologically 
confirmed NPC. The controls were friends of patients, 
support group volunteers in hospitals and other organi-
zations, members of religious societies, and NCCS staff
 
members. Since Singapore is a small country with a 
fairly homogenous population, people’s geographic loca-
tion does not affect demographics and their exposure 
to the risk factors studied. Controls and patients were 
recruited simultaneously, and a total of 310 controls 
were recruited to match the cases. From the databank 
of 310 controls, one control was selected randomly and 
matched with each case in terms of age (±5 years), sex, 
and ethnicity using statistical software. Eligible controls 
included healthy Singaporeans or permanent residents 
of Singapore between 21 and 80 years old with no his-
tory of cancer and/or cancer-related disease. This study 
was approved by the Ethical Review Board for research in 
SingHealth cluster, Singapore. All participants provided 
informed consent.
Data collection
Data were collected from patients and controls via face-
to-face interviews conducted in the NCCS by trained 
researchers using a standardized lifestyle questionnaire. 
This questionnaire was adapted from the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as part of a joint-
collaboration in a wide study of the genetic epidemiol-
ogy of NPC in Southeast Asia [7]. Information collected 
included demographics, tobacco smoking, alcohol drink-
ing, dietary habits (consumption frequency of traditional 
preserved food), and history of weaning (which included 
history of being breastfed, specific food items consumed, 
 Page 3 of 8
Yong et al. Chin J Cancer  (2017) 36:3 
and whether food was pre-chewed). Date of diagnosis 
and clinical variables were obtained from patients’ clini-
cal records.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the gen-
eral demographic characteristics of the study popula-
tion, stratified by cases and controls. The frequency of 
the food consumed was classified into three catego-
ries: never or rarely consumed, consumed at least once 
a month (monthly basis), and consumed at least once a 
week (weekly/daily basis). Where appropriate, categorical 
variables were assessed by the Chi square test or Fisher’s 
exact test; continuous variables were assessed by t tests. 
The matched-pair method was used to analyze the data 
[31]. Associations between the risk factors and NPC were 
examined singly using conditional logistic regression to 
obtain the crude odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 
95% confidence interval (CI), followed by multivariable 
analysis, adjusting for covariates and interaction effects 
if necessary [32]. Adjusted ORs were reported from 
the multivariate model that was best fit obtained dur-
ing statistical analysis. Additionally, to assess the possi-
bility of dose–response relationships with risk of NPC, 
overall trend (P-trend) for the consumption of the food 
items was computed. Case–control pairs that had miss-
ing values in either case or control were excluded from 
the analysis. Unconditional logistic regression adjust-
ing for age, sex, and ethnicity was also performed; the 
results were similar to those observed when conditional 
logistic regression was used. All statistics presented were 
obtained by conditional logistic regression. All statisti-
cal analyses were performed using STATA version 12.0 
software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). 
Two-sided tests with P values less than 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Demographics and clinical characteristics of study 
population
In this study, from the total of 300 patients and 310 con-
trols, only 290 pairs of cases and controls were identi-
fied and matched successfully. The remaining 10 cases 
were unable to be matched and were excluded from this 
study. The main characteristics of patients and controls 
are summarized in Table 1. Of the 290 pairs of patients 
and controls, 236 (81.4%) were men, and 54 (18.6%) 
were women. The difference of mean age of patients 
(49.9 years) and controls (48.3 years) was not statisti-
cally significant (P = 0.069). Most NPC patients were 
Chinese (94.1%), followed by Malays (5.2%) and Indians 
(0.7%). Marital status (P = 0.519) and the various dialects 
(P = 0.051) were not significantly different between the 
Chinese patients and controls. However, in this study, 
the proportion of those with less education was higher 
among the patients than among the controls, and the dif-
ference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Based on 
WHO histologic classification, 231 patients (79.6%) were 
categorized as having type III NPC (non-keratinizing 
undifferentiated carcinoma), 55 (19.0%) were categorized 
as having type II NPC (non-keratinizing carcinoma), and 
2 (0.7%) were categorized as having type I NPC (squa-
mous cell carcinoma) (Table 1).

Associations of lifestyle and diet with NPC risk factors
Univariate conditional logistic regression analyses of 
lifestyle, diet, and weaning are listed in Table 2. Tobacco 
smoking was significantly associated with the risk of 
NPC (current smokers: OR = 4.50, 95% CI 2.61–7.78; 
former smokers: OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.48–3.79), but the 
association of alcohol drinking with risk of NPC was 
not statistically significant (Table 2). Of the food items 
examined, the participants who consumed salted meat 
at least once a month was found to have doubled risk of 
developing NPC compared with those participants who 
never or rarely consumed salted meat (OR = 2.04, 95% 
CI 1.18–3.50). In addition to salted meat, salted vegeta-
bles consumed at least once a week were also found to 
significantly associated with an increased risk of devel-
oping NPC (OR = 3.70, 95% CI 1.58–8.64) compared 
with salted vegetables rarely consumed. The trend of 
increasing risk of NPC was significantly associated with 
increasing frequency of salted fish, salted meat, and 
salted vegetable consumption (P-trend = 0.033, 0.003, 
and <0.001, respectively).
The association between the risk of NPC and the con-
sumption of food items such as salted fish, smoked fish, 
smoked meat, preserved vegetables, and rusip/chincalup 
was not found to be statistically significant (Table 2). In 
addition, the consumption frequencies of smoked fish, 
smoked meat, preserved vegetables, and rusip/chincalup 
were similar between patients and controls (P = 0.082, 
0.538, 0.061, and 0.866, respectively) (Table 1).
Traditional preserved foods, such as salted fish 
(OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.18–4.16), salted meat (OR = 2.56, 
95% CI 1.18–5.52), and preserved vegetables (OR = 2.15, 
95% CI 1.12–4.16), that were consumed during the wean-
ing period were significantly related to an increased 
NPC risk. The unknown values of weaning information 
were similar between the patients and controls (Table 2). 
Other food items consumed during the weaning period, 
such as breast milk (P = 0.259), porridge (P = 0.177), and 
canned food (P = 0.051), were not significantly associ-
ated with NPC risk. Similarly, no association was found 
between the practice of pre-chewing food and the risk of 
NPC (P = 0.053).
In the multivariate model, the participants who smoked 
tobacco and those who had ever smoked and consumed 
salted vegetables at least once a week were significantly 
associated with increased risks of NPC (OR = 4.50, 
95% CI 2.58–7.86; OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.54–4.12; and 
OR = 4.18, 95% CI 1.69–10.38, respectively, after adjust-
ing for education level) (Table 3). No interaction effects 
were found in the model. Moreover, the food items con-
sumed during the weaning period that were significantly 
associated with the risk of NPC (salted fish, salted meat,

(Table 3).
Discussion
In our study, we found that tobacco smoking (by both 
current and former smokers) was a statistically signifi-
cant risk factor for developing NPC. Compared with 
never smokers, current smokers had four times the risk 
of developing NPC, and those who had ever smoked 
had double the risk. Studies conducted in Taiwan, China 
[5], in Thailand [6, 7], in Wuhan, China [8], in Shang-
hai, China [14], and in the United States [22] also found 
that smoking was a risk factor for NPC, although other 
studies in Singapore [17], Malaysia [33], Serbia [34], 
and China [35] found the association to be less clear but 
did suggest that the inhalation of passive smoke during 
childhood could affect the risk of developing NPC [34].

A recent meta-analysis found that ever smokers had a 
significantly higher risk of developing NPC than never 
smokers, but these associations were more relevant to 
squamous cell carcinoma and less relevant in undifferen-
tiated carcinoma [27]. Since most patients in our study 
(80.0%) had undifferentiated carcinoma type of NPC, our 
results seem to suggest that exposure to tobacco smoke 
is equally relevant to undifferentiated carcinoma and the 
Singaporean population.
The literature offers several possible explanations 
regarding the carcinogenic mechanism. Tobacco smoke 
comes in direct contact with the nasopharynx and, there-
fore, might have direct action. However, it has also been 
proposed that tobacco is just one of many risk factors 
for NPC and may contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-acti-
vating substances [26]. It is known that EBV infection is 
strongly associated with undifferentiated carcinoma, and 
in high-risk areas 95% of NPC patients have this type of 
carcinoma [27]. Several epidemiological studies have sug-
gested that high concentrations of volatile nitrosamines 
are found in tobacco smoke [12], and these compounds 
were positively associated with cancer in other sites, such 
as the esophagus [36] and possibly the nasopharynx [12]. 
With regard to alcohol drinking, our results were similar 
to those of other studies, finding no strong association 
between alcohol drinking and NPC risk [4–6, 14, 17].
Additionally, we observed that people who consumed 
salted vegetables at least once a week had four times the 
risk of developing NPC compared with those who never 
or rarely consumed salted vegetables. This observation is 
consistent with the results of studies conducted in 1994 
in Singapore [10], in 1998 in Malaysia [4], and in 2000 
[14] and 2010 in China [9], all of which suggested that 
frequent consumption of salted vegetables was associated 
with risk of developing NPC. Salted vegetables are widely 
consumed in Singapore, with 18.3% of the control popu-
lation in this study being regular consumers. These prod-
ucts are readily available in the supermarket, and people 
generally consume salted vegetables as part of a meal. The 
salted vegetables called suan cai is a traditional Chinese 
pickled cabbage—a unique type of cabbage and mustard 
greens because of the ingredients used and the method 
of production [37]. It is usually prepared first by being 
pressed slowly and fermented, followed by pickling with 
salt and brine [38]. It is similar to sauerkraut, which is a 
common food in Central and Eastern Europe [37]. On the 
other hand, preserved vegetables referred to other types 
of fermented vegetables or fruits or marinated in mix-
tures based on soy sauce and soybean paste [38]. Little is 
known about particular carcinogenic compounds found 
in salted vegetables that affect the nasopharynx; more 
research on this relationship is warranted. On univari-
ate analysis, we found, in contrast to previous studies [4, 
9, 14, 35], no clear significant association between adult 
consumption of salted fish and NPC risk. This could be 
due to the broad decreased consumption of salted fish 
in populations with high risk of NPC such as Singapore-
ans [25]. Indeed, since 1980, a markedly decreasing trend 
in salted fish consumption has been observed in similar 
high-risk areas such as Hong Kong, China [25, 39]. Not 
surprisingly, the Singaporean population, the majority 
of which is of Chinese ethnicity, has also changed their 
diet to a more Westernized and international one, replac-
ing the traditional Chinese diet. Furthermore, the harms 
associated with the frequent consumption of salted fish, 
although not salted vegetables, was widely publicized in 
Singapore [40].
Our findings may have several limitations, particu-
larly those inherent to retrospective case–control stud-
ies. First, case–control studies are vulnerable to recall 
bias when information can be collected only through the 
recall of study participants—this was the case for our 
study. We tried minimizing recall bias by asking confir-
mation questions and, on dietary questions, having sev-
eral options in terms of consumption frequency. Second, 
our data collection was limited by the questions in the 
questionnaire asked directly about the study participants, 
particularly with regards to lifestyle, dietary informa-
tion, and weaning practices. Data on weaning are ideally 
obtained from the mother of the study participant, rather 
than the participant himself or herself. But given that 
cancer is a late-onset disease, the mother may no longer 
be alive or may not remember this information, so the 
information was self-reported by the participant where 
possible. Notably, the amount of missing data on wean-
ing was similar across cases and controls. Nonetheless, 
none of the weaning variables was conclusive, and these 
variables were not included in the multivariate model. 
Our results must be interpreted in the context of these 
constraints. Third, we recruited controls from our staff, 
friends of patients, and various organizations (both hos-
pital and community). We acknowledge that there could 
be selection bias in our controls because controls were 
people who understood the importance of such studies 
and were willing to participate for the benefit of society. 
Also, they were more likely to have higher education. In 
Singapore, the general population’s participation rate in 
scientific studies is nearly low, and often significant effort 
is needed to recruit enough controls. We tried mini-
mizing selection bias by recruiting controls from many 
different organizations; at the same time we recruited 
cases of approximately the same age, sex, and ethnicity. 
Because of the fairly homogenous population in Singa-
pore, recruiting controls from various sources did not 
create significant biases. Fourth, we adjusted for educa-
tional level when analyzing the risk factors of NPC. Fifth,

interviewer bias was one additional concern because 
knowledge and understanding of the risk factors by the 
interviewers and study participants may cause skewed 
results. When the study participants and interview-
ers are aware of the risk factors, the patients are more 
likely than the controls to pay greater attention to risk 
factor information during data collection. Therefore, we 
reduced the risk of interviewer bias by having only two 
trained interviewers who employed a standardized inter-
view technique, using the same lifestyle questionnaire for 
both patients and controls. Sixth and finally, the lack of 
information regarding the EBV status of each participant 
was another potential limitation. We are aware that EBV 
status could be a main risk factor for the development of 
NPC and could potentially have influenced the results of 
our study. However, EBV is fairly common in Singapore, 
and seroconversion occurs at an early age, with a rate of 
EBV seropositivity of 40%–60% in children younger than 
5 years.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that certain modifiable risk fac-
tors, namely smoking and frequent consumption of salted 
vegetables, contribute significantly to the development of 
NPC. This finding is important because understanding 
the risk factors of NPC could potentially lead to changes 
in cancer prevention campaigns. The burden of NPC is a 
major public health concern in Singapore, and by know-
ing that the risk factors are modifiable, public health pro-
grams might be better able in the future to reduce the 
burden of NPC by allocating resources and formulating 
population strategies accordingly. Although it may take a 
long time to adopt the cancer prevention strategies that 
could reduce the incidence of NPC, our findings could 
help tailor such important strategies, which hold signifi-
cant future promise.
