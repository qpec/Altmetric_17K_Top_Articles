Although ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in autism, their roles and mechanisms in
brain development remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that in vivo knockdown
or conditional knockout of the autism-linked ubiquitin ligase RNF8 or associated ubiquitin-
conjugating enzyme UBC13 in rodent cerebellar granule neurons robustly increases the
number of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons and functional parallel fiber/Purkinje cell
synapses. In contrast to the role of nuclear RNF8 in proliferating cells, RNF8 operates in the
cytoplasm in neurons to suppress synapse differentiation in vivo. Proteomics analyses reveal
that neuronal RNF8 interacts with the HECT domain protein HERC2 and scaffold protein
NEURL4, and knockdown of HERC2 or NEURL4 phenocopies the inhibition of RNF8/
UBC13 signaling on synapse differentiation. In behavior analyses, granule neuron-specific
knockout of RNF8 or UBC13 impairs cerebellar-dependent learning. Our study defines RNF8
and UBC13 as components of a novel cytoplasmic ubiquitin-signaling network that sup-
presses synapse formation in the brain.

ovalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin plays critical
roles in the establishment of neuronal connectivity in the
developing brain1, 2. Protein ubiquitination requires the
activity of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-
conjugating enzyme, and E3 ubiquitin ligase3, 4. Ubiquitin ligases
are thought to provide specificity in ubiquitin-signaling and may
thus play regulatory roles in key steps of neuronal development.
Deregulation of diverse ubiquitin ligases contributes to neu-
rodevelopmental disorders of cognition5, 6. For example, muta-
tions in the HECT domain ubiquitin ligase UBE3A cause
Angelman syndrome, featuring intellectual disability and aut-
ism7–10. Genome-wide and homozygosity mapping studies in
patients with autism have uncovered copy number variations in
the ubiquitin ligases PARK2, RFWD2, and FBXO4011–13, a
homozygous missense mutation in the HECT domain protein
HERC214, and a deletion in the regulatory region of the gene
encoding the RING finger ubiquitin ligase RNF815. Whereas the
functions and mechanisms of UBE3A and PARK2 are beginning
to be elucidated1, 16–19, the roles of other autism-linked E3 ubi-
quitin ligases such as RNF8 in the brain have remained
unexplored.
RNF8 has been implicated in DNA damage signaling in pro-
liferating cells20, 21. RNF8 is recruited to sites of DNA damage via
interaction of its phosphothreonine-binding FHA domain with
the adapter protein MDC1, which is phosphorylated by the
protein kinase ATM20, 22. Once recruited, RNF8 acts with the E2
enzyme UBC13 to catalyze the K63-linked ubiquitination of
histone H123. Notably, RNF8 may also interact with the E2
enzyme UBCH8 and promote the K48-linked ubiquitination and
turnover of DNA repair proteins24, 25. Whereas RNF8 functions
have been characterized in DNA damage signaling in proliferat-
ing cells, RNF8 functions in the brain have remained unknown.
In this study, we have discovered an RNF8/UBC13 ubiquitin-
signaling mechanism that regulates cerebellar synaptic con-
nectivity and motor learning. Knockdown and conditional
knockouts of RNF8 and UBC13 in granule neurons in the rodent
cerebellum robustly increase the number of functional parallel
fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in vivo. Strikingly, structure–function
analyses show that RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm in post-
mitotic neurons to suppress synapse formation in vivo. Interac-
tion proteomics analyses reveal that RNF8 forms a complex with
the autism-linked HECT domain protein HERC2 and scaffold
protein Neuralized 4 (NEURL4). Knockdown of HERC2 or
NEURL4 mimics the effect of RNF8 inhibition on synapse for-
mation in vivo. In behavior analyses, conditional knockout of
RNF8, or UBC13 impairs cerebellar-dependent learning. Our
findings define RNF8 and UBC13 as components of a novel
cytoplasmic ubiquitin-signaling mechanism in neurons that
suppresses synapse formation in the developing brain.
Results
RNF8 suppresses synapse formation in the cerebellum. Granule
neurons of the cerebellar cortex represent an ideal system for
discovery of cell-intrinsic mechanisms that underlie neuronal
morphogenesis and connectivity in the mammalian brain26–28.
Converging evidence in patients and mice suggests that the cer-
ebellum may represent a critical site in the pathogenesis of aut-
ism29–31. Because deregulation of neuronal connectivity is
thought to contribute to autism32–34, we assessed the potential
role of the autism-linked ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in synapse
development in the cerebellum.
RNF8 mRNA was highly expressed in the cerebellum of rat
pups during the second and third weeks of postnatal development
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), coinciding temporally with synapse
formation in the cerebellar cortex. RNF8 protein was expressed in
the cerebellum in two- and three-week old rat pups and declined
into adulthood (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Notably, RNF8 protein
levels were increased in granule neurons upon inhibition of the
proteasome (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
To assess the role of RNF8 in synapse development in the
rodent cerebellum, we visualized granule neuron presynaptic
boutons using an in vivo electroporation method35–37 in which
we expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in granule neurons
in rat pups. Rat pups were electroporated at postnatal day 4 (P4)
with the GFP expression plasmid, and animals were sacrificed
8
days
later
at
P12.
The
cerebellum
was
subjected
to
immunohistochemistry using the GFP antibody, facilitating
visualization of parallel fiber varicosities in the molecular layer
of
the
cerebellar
cortex.
Parallel
fiber
GFP-varicosities
co-localized with the active zone protein Bassoon and were
contiguous with the postsynaptic protein GluR2 (Supplementary
Fig. 1d), indicating that parallel fiber GFP-labeled synaptic
varicosities represent presynaptic boutons38.
We induced the knockdown of RNF8 using a plasmid-based
method of RNAi39, 40. Expression of RNF8 shRNAs led to
knockdown of endogenous RNF8 in primary granule neurons
(U6/RNF8: 46.89 ± 7.98% of control, n = 3 cultures; mean ± s.e.
m.; p = 0.003, t test; U6/RNF8.2: 26.62 ± 5.72% of control, n = 3
cultures;
mean ± s.e.m.;
p = 0.0002,
t
test)
(Supplementary
Fig. 1e). Knockdown of RNF8 robustly increased the number of
parallel fiber presynaptic boutons in vivo (U6: 3.255 ± 0.235
boutons/100 μm;
U6/RNF8:
5.155 ± 0.392
boutons/100 μm;
n = 5 rats; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 3.556E−05, t test) (Fig. 1a), (U6:
3.893 ± 0.371 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8.2: 6.758 ± 0.589 bou-
tons/100 μm;
n = 3
rats;
mean ± s.e.m.;
p = 0.0183,
t
test)
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). These results suggest that RNF8 sup-
presses the formation of granule neuron presynaptic boutons.
We next employed a conditional mouse genetics approach in
which loxP sites were placed flanking exons 6 and 7 of the RNF8
gene (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Using the in vivo electroporation
approach to express the recombinase Cre, induction of RNF8
knockout in granule neurons significantly increased the number
of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons (Ctrl: 4.164 ± 0.206 boutons/
100 μm; Cre: 5.943 ± 0.213 boutons/100 μm; n = 6 mice; mean ±
s.e.m.; p = 0.0001, t test) (Fig. 1b).
We also crossed mice harboring the floxed allele of the RNF8
gene with mice in which the Cre driver is controlled by the
promoter of the Math1 gene, which is expressed in granule cells
within the cerebellar cortex41. Mice in which the RNF8 gene was
knocked
out
using
Math1-Cre
were
viable
and
weighed
similarly to control littermate animals (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Notably, global RNF8 knockout mice42 were smaller than control
littermate mice (data not shown). Conditional knockout of RNF8
reduced the abundance of RNF8 mRNA in the cerebellum of P10
mice by ~60% (RNF8 cKO: 44.88 ± 1.06% of control, n = 3 mice;
p = 8.274E−07, t test) (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). Global RNF8
knockout downregulated the abundance of RNF8 mRNA in the
cerebellum by almost 100% (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Because
granule neurons represent 70% of the cells in the cerebellum43,
these results suggest that Math1-Cre leads to efficient knockout of
RNF8 in granule neurons of the cerebellum. No anatomical
abnormalities were evident in the cerebellum of RNF8 conditional
knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e), suggesting that condi-
tional knockout of RNF8 specifically alters presynaptic bouton
differentiation.
We next characterized presynaptic differentiation in RNF8
conditional
knockout
mice
at
different
stages
of
synapse
development. There was little or no difference in parallel fiber
presynaptic
bouton
number
at
P13

Fig. 1 The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 suppresses presynaptic differentiation and synapse formation in the cerebellum in vivo. a Left: a representative image of
a cerebellum from a P12 rat pup electroporated with the GFP expression plasmid 8 days earlier. Granule neurons have descended to the internal granule
layer (IGL) and axonal parallel fibers reside in the molecular layer (ML). Arrowheads denote varicose structures along the parallel fibers that represent
presynaptic boutons. Right: P4 rat pups were electroporated with the RNF8 RNAi or control U6 plasmid together with a GFP expression plasmid and
sacrificed 8 days later. The cerebellum was removed, sectioned, and subjected to immunohistochemistry using a GFP antibody. Knockdown of RNF8
increased the density of presynaptic boutons in the cerebellar cortex in vivo (***p < 0.05, t test, n = 5 rats). b P9 RNF8loxP/loxP mice were electroporated
with the Cre expression plasmid or control vector together with the GFP expression plasmid and boutons along granule neuron parallel fibers were
analyzed as in a. Cre-induced knockout of RNF8 in granule neurons increased presynaptic bouton density (***p < 0.001, t test, n = 6 mice). c P9 RNF8
conditional knockout (RNF8 cKO) and control RNF8loxP/loxP mice were electroporated with the GFP expression plasmid and analyzed at different stages of
synapse development as in a. Left: representative axons at P17. Right: quantification of the number of presynaptic boutons at different stages of
development. Little or no difference in presynaptic bouton number was observed at P13. By contrast, the number of presynaptic boutons was increased at
P17 upon conditional knockout of RNF8 (***p < 0.001, t test, n = 3 mice), and this difference was maintained at P21 (**p < 0.01, t test, n = 4–5 mice). Scale
bars represent 10 μm. d The cerebellum from P24 RNF8 cKO and control mice were subjected to electron microscopy analyses. Left: representative

Right: quantification of the density of parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in RNF8 cKO and control mice. The density of parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses
was increased in RNF8 cKO mice compared to control mice (*p < 0.05, t test, n = 3 mice)

Fig. 2 RNF8 suppresses granule neuron to Purkinje cell neurotransmission in the cerebellum. a Acute sagittal cerebellar slices from P20–25 RNF8 cKO and
control mice were subjected to electrophysiological analyses. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in Purkinje neurons in
response to stimulation of parallel fibers with increasing intensity (30, 40, and 50 μA). Representative current traces (left) and quantification of the
amplitude of evoked EPSCs (right) are shown. The amplitude of evoked EPSCs in Purkinje neurons was increased in RNF8 cKO mice compared to control
mice (*p < 0.05 at 30 and 40 μA, ***p < 0.005 at 50 μA, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test, n = 14–15 neurons, four mice). b Acute coronal
cerebellar slices were prepared as in (a), and parallel fiber axons were stimulated at sites 400 μm away from an extracellular recording electrode. A
representative trace of the stimulus-evoked presynaptic waveform before and after the application of tetrodotoxin is shown (left). The stimulus artifact was
removed for clarity. On the right, quantification of presynaptic volley amplitude is shown. Conditional knockout of RNF8 had little or no effect on the
presynaptic volley amplitude. c, d Acute sagittal cerebellar slices were prepared as in (a) and Purkinje cell miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded.
Representative traces of mEPSCs from RNF8 cKO and control mice are shown (c, left). Quantification of the mean (c, right) and cumulative distribution (d)
of the mEPSC frequency and amplitude are shown. The frequency of mEPSCs was increased in RNF8 cKO mice compared to control mice (*p < 0.05, t test,
n = 18–20 neurons, three mice). Conditional knockout of RNF8 had little or no effect on the amplitude of mEPSCs in Purkinje neurons

establish that RNF8 suppresses formation of parallel fiber/
Purkinje cell synapses in the developing cerebellum.
RNF8 suppresses granule neuron/Purkinje cell transmission.
We next assessed the effect of conditional knockout of RNF8 on
neurotransmission at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses. Elec-
trophysiological analyses in acute cerebellar slices revealed that
the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs)
at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses was increased in RNF8
conditional knockout mice compared to control animals (at 30

least significant difference (PLSD) post hoc test) (Fig. 2a). In
control analyses, there was little or no difference in the amplitude
of presynaptic volleys in control and RNF8 conditional knockout
mice (at 30 μA, control: 0.187 ± 0.038 mV; RNF8 cKO: 0.199 ±
0.059 mV; p = 0.991; at 40 μA, control: 0.544 ± 0.072 mV; RNF8

n = 13–17 field recordings, two mice; mean ± s.e.m.; ANOVA
followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test) (Fig. 2b), suggesting that
the increased amplitude of evoked EPSCs in RNF8 conditional
knockout mice reflects alterations in synaptic function rather
than changes in axon excitability.
We next asked if augmented neurotransmission in RNF8
conditional knockout mice might be secondary to changes in
synapse number. The frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in
Purkinje cells was increased in acute cerebellar slices from RNF8
conditional knockout mice compared to control animals (control:
2.26 ± 0.8 Hz; RNF8 cKO: 6.14 ± 1.58 Hz; n = 18–20 neurons,
three mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.041, t test of means; p < 0.001,
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of cumulative distribution) (Fig. 2c, d),
consistent with the conclusion that synapse number is increased
in RNF8 conditional knockout mice. There was little or no change
in the amplitude of mEPSCs in RNF8 conditional knockout mice
(control: 12.15 ± 0.27 pA; RNF8 cKO: 12.68 ± 0.43 pA; n = 18–20
neurons, three mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.315, t test of means;
p = 0.43, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of cumulative distribution)
(Fig. 2c, d). There was little or no difference in the rise and decay
time of mEPSCs in control and RNF8 conditional knockout mice
(Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).
In analyses of granule neuron intrinsic excitability, there was
little or no difference in the number of evoked action potentials
(AP; at 10pA, control: 0.7 ± 0.517; RNF8 cKO: 1 ± 1; p = 0.793; at

serine (RNF8ResC405S), or the control vector and with the GFP expression plasmid and analyzed as in Fig. 1a. RNF8Res, but not RNF8ResC405S, reversed
the RNF8 RNAi-induced phenotype of increased presynaptic bouton number in vivo (*p < 0.05, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test, n = 3-4
rats). b P4 rat pups were electroporated with the UBC13 RNAi, UBCH8 RNAi, or control U6 plasmid and analyzed as in Fig. 1a. Knockdown of UBC13, but
not knockdown of UBCH8, increased the density of presynaptic parallel fiber boutons in the cerebellar cortex in vivo (***p < 0.005, t test, n = 3 rats). c P4
rat pups were electroporated with the control U6 plasmid or RNF8 RNAi together with a RNF8Res mutant in which isoleucine 407 was replaced with
alanine (RNF8ResI407A) or the control vector and with the GFP expression plasmid and analyzed as in Fig. 1a. Expression of RNF8ResI407A reversed the
RNF8 knockdown-induced phenotype on presynaptic boutons (*p < 0.05, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test, n = 3–6 rats). For
representative images of axons see Supplementary Fig. 6c. d P6/7 UBC13loxP/loxP mice were electroporated with the Cre expression plasmid or control
vector together with the GFP expression plasmid and analyzed as in Fig. 1a. Cre-induced knockout of UBC13 in granule neurons increased presynaptic
bouton density in vivo (***p < 0.001, t test, n = 6 mice). Scale bars = 10 μm. e The cerebellum from P25 UBC13 conditional knockout mice and control
UBC13loxP/loxP mice were subjected to electron microscopy analyses. Left: representative electron micrographs of the molecular layer of the cerebellar

Fig. 5 UBC13 suppresses granule neuron to Purkinje cell neurotransmission in the cerebellum. a Acute sagittal cerebellar slices from P23–26 UBC13 cKO
and control mice were subjected to electrophysiological analyses. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in Purkinje neurons in
response to stimulation of parallel fibers with increasing intensity (30, 40, and 50 μA). Representative current traces (left) and quantification of the
amplitude of evoked EPSCs (right) are shown. The amplitude of evoked EPSCs in Purkinje neurons was increased in UBC13 cKO mice compared to control
mice (***p < 0.005 at 40 μA, *p < 0.05 at 50 μA, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test, n = 25–29, six mice). b Acute coronal cerebellar slices
were prepared as in (a), and parallel fiber axons were stimulated at sites 400 μm away from an extracellular recording electrode. A representative trace of
the stimulus-evoked presynaptic waveform before and after the application of tetrodotoxin is shown (left). The stimulus artifact was removed for clarity.
On the right, quantification of presynaptic volley amplitude is shown. Conditional knockout of UBC13 had little or no effect on the presynaptic volley
amplitude. c, d Acute sagittal cerebellar slices were prepared as in (a) and Purkinje cell mEPSCs were recorded. Representative traces of mEPSCs from
UBC13 cKO mice and control mice are shown (c, left). Quantification of the mean (c, right) and cumulative distribution (d) of the mEPSC frequency and
amplitude are shown. The frequency of mEPSCs was increased in UBC13 cKO mice compared to control mice (*p < 0.05, t test, n = 32 neurons, six mice).
Conditional knockout of UBC13 had little or no effect on the amplitude of mEPSCs in Purkinje neurons

 (control: 1.418 ± 0.059 GΩ; RNF8 cKO: 1.386 ± 0.088 GΩ; n = 10
neurons, two mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.765, t test) in control and
RNF8 conditional knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).
These data suggest that RNF8 may not set the intrinsic excitability
of granule neurons. In other analyses, little or no difference in
paired-pulse
facilitation
was
found
in
control
and
RNF8
conditional knockout mice (control: 2.55 ± 0.149; RNF8 cKO:
2.47 ± 0.233; n = 8 neurons, three mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.771,
t test) (Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting RNF8 may not control
the probability of vesicle release at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell
synapses in the mouse cerebellum. Taken together, our findings
suggest that RNF8 influences the structural and functional
maturation of synapses in the cerebellar cortex.
RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm to suppress synaptogenesis.
We next determined the mechanism underlying RNF8 function
in the brain. The subcellular site of ubiquitin ligases plays a cri-
tical role in specifying their functions in neurons1, 44–46. RNF8
acts in the nucleus to mediate cellular responses to DNA damage
in proliferating cells20, 25. Surprisingly, in immunoblotting ana-
lyses of fractionated lysates of granule neurons, RNF8 immu-
noreactivity was present primarily in the cytoplasm in neurons,
though RNF8 was also present in the nucleus (Fig. 3a). Antibodies
to RNF8 performed poorly in immunocytochemical and immu-
nohistochemical analyses. We therefore characterized the locali-
zation of an RNF8–GFP fusion protein in granule neurons in the
cerebellum. RNF8–GFP was localized predominantly in the
cytoplasm in granule neurons in vivo (Fig. 3b).
We next performed structure–function analyses of RNF8
function in the control of synapse development in the back-
ground of RNF8 RNAi in rodent pups. We used the in vivo
electroporation approach in rodent pups to target RNF8 to the
cytoplasm or nucleus in granule neurons by appending a nuclear
export signal (NES) or nuclear localization signal (NLS),
respectively,
to
an
RNAi-resistant
rescue
form
of
RNF8
(RNF8Res) (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Expression of NES-
RNF8Res, but not NLS-RNF8Res, reversed the RNF8 RNAi-
induced phenotype of increased parallel fiber presynaptic bouton
number in vivo (U6: 3.352 ± 0.153 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8:
5.192 ± 0.478 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8 + NES Res: 3.535 ±
0.162 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8 + NLS Res: 4.854 ± 0.099 bou-

U6/RNF8:

(Fig. 3c). The exogenous expression of RNF8 in the absence of
RNF8 RNAi had little or no effect on the number of parallel fiber
boutons in vivo (GFP: 4.03 ± 0.223 boutons/100 μm; GFP +
RNF8: 4.011 ± 0.171 boutons/100 μm; n = 4 rats; mean ± s.e.m.;
p = 0.95, t test) (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Together, our results
suggest that RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm rather than the
nucleus
in
post-mitotic
neurons
to
suppress
synapse
differentiation.
UBC13 acts with RNF8 to suppress synapse differentiation.
The finding that RNF8 acts in the cytoplasm rather than the
nucleus in neurons led us next to the question of whether the
ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF8 is required for its function in
neurons. Expression of RNF8Res effectively reversed the RNF8
RNAi-induced phenotype of increased parallel fiber presynaptic
bouton number in the cerebellum in vivo (U6: 2.848 ± 0.158
boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8: 5.892 ± 0.982 boutons/100 μm; U6/
RNF8 + Res:
3.033 ± 0.09
boutons/100 μm;
U6/RNF8 +
ResC405S: 4.825 ± 0.666 boutons/100 μm; n = 3–4 rats; mean ± s.
e.m.; U6/RNF8 + Res vs. U6/RNF8: p = 0.044; ANOVA followed
by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test) (Fig. 4a). By contrast, expression
of a mutant form of RNF8Res in which the key regulatory
RING domain site cysteine 405 was replaced with serine
(RNF8ResC405S) failed to effectively reverse the RNF8 RNAi-
induced presynaptic bouton phenotype (U6/RNF8 + ResC405S vs
U6/RNF8: p = 0.42; ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc
test) (Fig. 4a). These results suggest that the ubiquitin ligase
activity of RNF8 suppresses synapse differentiation.
RNF8 interacts with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13
or UBCH8, and thereby catalyzes K63-linked or K48-linked
ubiquitin chains, respectively21, 24, 47, 48. We asked whether RNF8
acts via UBC13 or UBCH8 to suppress synapse differentiation.
Knockdown of UBC13, but not knockdown of UBCH8, robustly
increased the number of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons in vivo
(U6:
3.28 ± 0.175
boutons/100 μm;
U6/UBC13:
5.15 ± 0.269
boutons/100 μm; n = 3 rats; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.004, t test; U6:
3.51 ± 0.205 boutons/100 μm; U6/UBCH8: 3.69 ± 0.184 boutons/
100 μm; n = 3 rats; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.565, t test) (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary
Fig.
6a,
b).
Consistent
with
these
results,
expression of a mutant form of RNF8Res (RNF8ResI407A),
which fails to interact with UBCH8 but maintains interaction
with UBC1324, reversed effectively the RNF8 knockdown-induced
phenotype of increased parallel fiber presynaptic bouton number
in vivo (U6: 3.48 ± 0.19 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8: 5.147 ± 0.358
boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8 + ResI407A: 3.79 ± 0.19 boutons/100
μm;
n = 3–6
rats;
mean ± s.e.m.;
U6/RNF8 + ResI407A
vs.
U6/RNF8: p = 0.027; ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post
hoc test) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Together, these
results suggest UBC13, but not UBCH8, operates with RNF8 to
regulate synapse development.
In the in vivo electroporation approach to express Cre in
granule neurons in mice that harbor a floxed allele of the UBC13
gene (UBC13loxP/loxP), conditional knockout of UBC13 signifi-
cantly increased the number of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons
(control: 4.75 ± 0.23 boutons/100 μm; Cre: 6.44 ± 0.247 boutons/
100 μm; n = 6 mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.0005, t test) (Fig. 4d).
Conditional knockout of UBC13 had little or no effect on the
number of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons at P13 (control: 2.73
± 0.135 boutons/100 μm; UBC13 Cre: 3.16 ± 0.194 boutons/100
μm; n = 3–4 mice; p = 0.148; mean ± s.e.m., t test) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7a). By contrast, conditional knockout of UBC13 signi-
ficantly increased parallel fiber presynaptic bouton number at P17
(control: 3.94 ± 0.208 boutons/100 μm; UBC13 Cre: 5.37 ± 0.311
boutons/100 μm; n = 3 mice; p = 0.019; mean ± s.e.m., t test), and
this difference was maintained at P21 (control: 4.21 ± 0.203
boutons/100 μm; UBC13 Cre: 5.96 ± 0.084 boutons/100 μm; n = 3
mice; p = 0.005; mean ± s.e.m., t test) (Supplementary Fig. 7a).

 Together,
these
data
suggest
that
UBC13
suppresses
the
differentiation of presynaptic boutons.
We next crossed UBC13loxP/loxP mice with mice in which Cre is
expressed using the granule neuron-specific driver GABAα6
receptor gene promoter49. UBC13 protein and mRNA levels in
the cerebellum were downregulated in granule neuron-specific
UBC13 conditional knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c).
UBC13 conditional knockout mice were viable and weighed
similarly to control littermate animals (Supplementary Fig. 7d),
and had little or no alterations in the overall architecture of the
cerebellar cortex (Supplementary Fig. 7e). EM analyses revealed
an increased number of parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in the
cerebellar cortex in UBC13 conditional knockout mice (control:
13.43 ± 0.709
synapses/100 μm2;
UBC13 cKO:
17.38 ± 0.867
synapses/100 μm2; n = 3 mice; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.024, t test)
(Fig. 4e), suggesting that UBC13 suppresses synapse formation in
the cerebellar cortex.
In electrophysiological analyses in acute cerebellar slices, the
amplitude of evoked EPSCs at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses
was substantially increased in UBC13 conditional knockout mice
compared to control animals (at 30 μA, control: 71.26 ± 20.23 pA;
UBC13 cKO: 113.72 ± 23.03 pA; p = 0.167; at 40 μA, control:
206.41 ± 42.03 pA; UBC13 cKO: 408.62 ± 52.26 pA; p = 0.003; at
50 μA, control: 434.41 ± 69.22 pA; UBC13 cKO: 675.62 ± 73.38
pA; p = 0.019; n = 25–29 neurons, six mice; mean ± s.e.m.;
ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc test) (Fig. 5a).
There was little or no difference in the amplitude of presynaptic
volleys in control and UBC13 conditional knockout mice (at 30
μA, control: 0.212 ± 0.017 mV; UBC13 cKO: 0.202 ± 0.019 mV; p
= 0.69; at 40 μA, control: 0.408 ± 0.03 mV; UBC13 cKO: 0.44 ±
0.035 mV; p = 0.45; at 50 μA, control: 0.59 ± 0.047 mV; UBC13
cKO: 0.69 ± 0.055 mV; p = 0.19; n = 17–20 field recordings, three
mice; mean ± s.e.m.; ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post hoc
test) (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the increased amplitude of evoked
EPSCs in UBC13 conditional knockout mice is not secondary to
changes in axon excitability and instead reflects alterations in
synaptic function. In other analyses, the frequency of mEPSCs in
Purkinje cells was increased upon conditional knockout of
UBC13 mice, consistent with the conclusion that synapse number
is increased in UBC13 conditional knockout mice (control: 2.35
± 0.27 Hz; UBC13 cKO: 4.11 ± 0.64 Hz; n = 32 neurons; six mice;

 UBC13 conditional knockout mice (control: 13.23 ± 0.28 pA;
UBC13 cKO: 14.02 ± 0.31 pA; n = 32 neurons; six mice; mean ± s.
e.m.; p = 0.065, t test of means; p = 0.97, Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test of cumulative distribution) (Fig. 5c, d). In addition,
conditional knockout of UBC13 led to little or no difference in
the rise time of mEPSCs and to a modest increase in the decay
time of mEPSCs (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary
Table 2). Together, these data reveal that the structural alterations
in parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse development in UBC13
conditional knockout mice bear functional consequences on
synaptic neurotransmission. Collectively, our findings support the
conclusion that UBC13 operates in concert with RNF8 to
suppress synapse differentiation in the mammalian brain.
RNF8-interactors HERC2 and NEURL4 suppress synaptogen-
esis.
To
gain
insights
into
the
mechanisms
of
RNF8/
UBC13 signaling in synapse development, we employed a
computer-assisted interaction proteomics approach46, 50–52. We
immunoprecipitated FLAG-RNF8 in Neuro2A mouse neuro-
blastoma cells followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS). Eluted
trypsinized FLAG-RNF8 bait complexes were subjected to liquid
chromatography–MS/MS. We used Neuro2A cells as the neural
proteome for the immunoprecipitation of a large number of
proteins52. This approach facilitates identification of high-
confidence interacting proteins using the statistical software
ComPASS50, which compares the interactome of a specific pro-
tein to the interactomes of all other prey proteins in the same cell
type. These analyses led to the identification of RNF8-interacting
proteins including the HECT domain protein HERC2 and scaf-
fold protein NEURL4, which form a complex53–55 (Table 1).
Notably, HERC2 plays a critical role in DNA damage signaling21.
Upon phosphorylation by the protein kinase ATM, HERC2
interacts with RNF8 via the FHA domain of RNF821. HERC2 also
interacts with UBC13 and facilitates formation of the RNF8/
UBC13 complex that triggers K63-linked ubiquitination21. In
coimmunoprecipitation analyses in Neuro2A cells in which we
expressed RNF8, endogenous HERC2 and NEURL4 interacted
with RNF8 (Fig. 6a). HERC2 and NEURL4 mRNA and protein
were expressed endogenously in the developing rodent cere-
bellum (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Like RNF8, NEURL4, and
HERC2 localized in the cytoplasm in granule neurons (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9a, b). Importantly, endogenous RNF8 interacted
with HERC2 in the cytoplasmic fraction of the rodent cerebellum
(Fig. 6b).
We next determined the effect of NEURL4 knockdown or
HERC2 knockdown on presynaptic bouton formation in the rodent
cerebellum. We found that the number of presynaptic boutons was
significantly increased in NEURL4 knockdown animals (U6: 3.08 ±
0.133 boutons/100 μm; U6/NEURL4: 4.91 ± 0.274 boutons/100 μm;
n = 3–8 rats; mean ± s.e.m.; p = 0.0016, t test) and in HERC2
knockdown
animals
(U6:
3.29 ± 0.244
boutons/100 μm;
U6/
HERC2: 5.76 ± 0.246 boutons/100 μm; n = 6–9 rats; mean ± s.e.m.;
p = 3.556E−05, t test) (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 9c, d).
We assessed whether interaction with HERC2 and NEURL4
contributes to the ability of RNF8 to regulate synapse develop-
ment. Mutation of the FHA domain in RNF8 (R42A) impaired
the ability of RNF8 to form a complex with HERC2 and NEURL4
in cells (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f), suggesting that the FHA
domain mediates the interaction of RNF8 with HERC2 and
NEURL4. In structure–function analyses, an RNF8Res protein in
which the FHA domain was mutated (RNF8ResR42A)20 failed to
effectively reverse the RNF8 knockdown-induced increase in the
number of granule neuron parallel fiber presynaptic boutons
in vivo (U6: 3.07 ± 0.024 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8: 5.604 ±
0.496 boutons/100 μm; U6/RNF8 + ResR42A: 4.878 ± 0.642 bou-
tons/100 μm; n = 3 rats; mean ± s.e.m.; U6/RNF8 + ResR42A vs.
U6/RNF8: p = 0.421; ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD post
hoc test) (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these results suggest that the
interaction of RNF8 with HERC2 and NEURL4 plays a critical
role in the regulation of synapse development in the brain.
Role of RNF8/UBC13 ubiquitin signaling in motor learning.
Alterations of parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse number and
function have been associated with deficits in cerebellar-
dependent procedural motor learning30, 56, 57. We therefore

 and control littermate mice to a delayed eye-blink conditioning
response paradigm.
Eye-blink conditioning allows for high-precision measure-
ments and is sensitive to genetic perturbations in cerebellar
signaling30, 58–60. Eye-blink responses were characterized using
blue LED light pulses as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and
corneal air puffs as the unconditioned stimulus (US) (Fig. 7a).
After 7 consecutive sessions of conditioning (1 session per day;
150ms CS–US interval; 100 trials/session), control mice demon-
strated acquisition of the conditioned response (CR). In contrast,
RNF8 conditional knockout mice showed a profound deficit in
learning compared to control littermates (day 1: control = 0.84%
± 0.45, RNF8 cKO = 1.29% ± 0.54, p = 0.516; day2: control =

These results suggest that RNF8 plays a critical role in delayed
eye-blink conditioning.
We also characterized the effect of conditional knockout of
RNF8 in the accelerating rotarod test, in which the latency to fall
from an accelerating rotarod increases over several days. We
found a modest difference in the ability of RNF8 conditional
knockout and control littermate animals to learn in the
accelerating rotarod test (control and RNF8 cKO, n = 14 mice)
(Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 3). In other
analyses, little or no difference was evident in the open-field test
(control and RNF8 cKO, n = 10 mice) (Supplementary Fig. 10b).
Together, our results suggest that RNF8 may play a key role in
specific forms of cerebellar-dependent learning.
We next asked whether UBC13 plays a role in cerebellar-
dependent learning. We found that UBC13 conditional knockout
mice demonstrated impairment in learning compared with
control littermates in the delayed eye-blink conditioning para-
digm (day1: control = 2.69% ± 2.33, UBC13 cKO = 1.06% ± 0.55,
p = 0.48; day2: control = 20.11% ± 10.62, UBC13 cKO = 2.76% ±
1.27, p = 0.11; day3: control = 58.56% ± 7.94, UBC13 cKO =
4.43% ± 1.44,
p = 5.41E−0.5;
day4:
control = 69.57% ± 4.42,
UBC13 cKO = 39.02% ± 1.19, p = 0.029; day5: control = 72.17%
± 5.02, UBC13 cKO = 55.91% ± 11.10, p = 0.21; day6: control =
80.66% ± 3.31, UBC13 cKO = 61.37% ± 7.24, p = 0.042; day 7:
control = 81.5% ± 1.98, UBC13 cKO = 61.09% ± 7.46, p = 0.036;
n = 9 mice; mean ± s.e.m; ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD
post hoc test) (Fig. 7c). These results suggest that like RNF8,
UBC13 is required for delayed eye-blink conditioning. Taken
together, our data suggest that RNF8/UBC13 signaling in granule
neurons plays a crucial role in cerebellar-dependent motor
learning.
Discussion
In this study, we have discovered a novel function for RNF8/
UBC13 ubiquitin signaling in the establishment of neuronal
connectivity in the mammalian brain. Inhibition of RNF8 by
knockdown and conditional knockout in granule neurons of the
mouse cerebellum robustly increases the number of parallel fiber
presynaptic boutons and functional parallel fiber/Purkinje cell
synapses in vivo. In mechanistic studies, we have found that the
ubiquitin ligase RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm in neurons in
concert with the E2 enzyme UBC13 to suppress synapse forma-
tion in vivo. Interaction proteomics analyses reveal that neuronal
RNF8 interacts with the HECT domain protein HERC2 and
scaffold protein NEURL4, and their interaction plays a critical
role in the ability of RNF8 to suppress synapse differentiation
in vivo. Furthermore, behavior analyses showed conditional
knockout of RNF8 or UBC13 robustly impairs cerebellar-
dependent learning. Collectively, our findings define RNF8 and
UBC13 as components of a novel cytoplasmic ubiquitin-signaling
mechanism in neurons that suppresses formation of functional
synapses in the cerebellum.
Although ubiquitin ligases such as Cdc20-APC have been
shown to promote presynaptic development in the mammalian
brain37, our findings define RNF8 as the first ubiquitin ligase that
actively suppresses presynaptic differentiation in the mammalian
brain. What is the biological significance of suppression of
synapse formation in the developing brain? One possibility is that
such a mechanism might be required to prevent premature
synaptogenesis in newly developing neurons prior to their inte-
gration into neural circuits. Alternatively, suppression of synap-
togenesis by ubiquitin signaling might provide the means to fine-
tune neuronal connectivity once synapses are formed.
Whether RNF8 function in suppression of synapse formation is
relevant to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder is an
interesting question for future studies. We have found that the
inhibition of another autism-liked ubiquitin ligase, HERC2,
induces an increase in presynaptic boutons, and inhibition of the
ubiquitin ligase UBE3A in Drosophila has been shown to increase
the number of presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junctions18.
Taken together, our findings suggest the exciting possibility that
deregulation of presynaptic bouton differentiation may represent
a common underlying pathogenic mechanism in autism.
Our study reveals fundamental differences as well as parallels
between RNF8 functions in post-mitotic neurons and the role of
RNF8 in DNA damage signaling in dividing cells. Whereas RNF8
operates in the nucleus in DNA damage signaling20, 25, we have
found RNF8 resides and operates in the cytoplasm in post-mitotic
neurons to suppress synapse differentiation in the brain.
Although RNF8 may act via UBC13 and UBCH8 to promote
K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitination in DNA damage sig-
naling in proliferating cells21, 24, 47, 48, RNF8 acts with UBC13 but
not UBCH8 to suppress synapse differentiation in post-mitotic
neurons. On the other hand, several components of the DNA
damage signaling cascade including RNF8, UBC13, and HERC2
play crucial roles in the regulation of synapse formation in the
brain,
raising
the
intriguing
possibility
that
the
RNF8/
UBC13 signaling cascade may operate as a cassette that has
evolved to perform distinct functions in the nucleus in dividing
cells and in the cytoplasm in post-mitotic cells. In both cases,
owing to its interaction with RNF8, HERC2 may facilitate the
assembly of the RNF8/UBC13 complex and thereby promote its
activity. However, the association of NEURL4 with HERC2 in the
control of synapse differentiation distinguishes such potential
regulation from DNA damage signaling.
A key difference between RNF8/UBC13 signaling in the con-
trol of synapse differentiation and DNA damage signaling lies
presumably in downstream mechanisms. In proliferating cells,
RNF8 and UBC13 catalyze the K63-linked ubiquitination of
histone H1, which triggers DNA damage response23. Because
RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm to suppress synapse differ-
entiation, neuronal substrates of RNF8/UBC13 might be adhesion
molecules, synaptic vesicle proteins, active zone components,
cytoskeletal, or presynaptic terminal mitochondria proteins with
key roles in presynaptic differentiation61, 62. The identification of
substrates of neuronal RNF8/UBC13 ubiquitin signaling repre-
sents an important question for future studies.

strated by electrophysiological analyses of acute cerebellar slices

 from RNF8 conditional knockout and UBC13 conditional
knockout mice. The number of climbing fiber synapses may be
homeostatically regulated relative to parallel fiber/Purkinje cell
synapses63–65. In future studies, it will be important to determine
the effect of increased number of parallel fiber/Purkinje cells
synapses on the number and strength of climbing fiber/Purkinje
cell synapses.
At the organism level, RNF8 or UBC13 conditional knockout
mice demonstrate defects in cerebellar-dependent procedural
memory, suggesting that increased number of parallel fiber/Pur-
kinje cell synapses and potential consequent alterations of
synaptic plasticity may trigger deficits in cerebellar-dependent
behavior66. Whether inhibition of RNF8/UBC13 pathway in
granule neurons impacts plasticity at parallel fiber/Purkinje cells
synapses including long term depression and long term poten-
tiation will require future studies. The coding mechanisms used
in the cerebellum for learning and expressing a particular form of
motor learning, such as the delayed eye-blink conditioning
response, accelerated rotarod test, or adaptation of the vestibular
ocular reflex (VOR), require distinct cerebellar modules67. It will
be also important to determine if the morphological changes in
synapse differentiation in RNF8/UBC13 knockout mice induce
deficits in other forms of cerebellar learning such as VOR
adaptation. Finally, it will be interesting to investigate whether
increasing the number of synapses upon inhibition of RNF8/
UBC13 signaling might serve a beneficial effect in pathological
circumstances in which synapse number is reduced.
Methods
Plasmids. RNF8 was cloned from Sprague Dawley rat cDNA and inserted into the
pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech), and subcloned into the pCAG vector.
Silent rescue and point mutations of RNF8 were introduced by site-directed
mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. A NES or NLS, respectively, was
appended to an RNAi-resistant rescue form of RNF8 or GFP-RNF8 and
subsequently inserted into pcDNA3. NEURL4 was cloned from Sprague Dawley rat
cDNA and inserted into the pEGFP-C1 or pcDNA3-FLAG vector. A C-terminal
fragment of HERC2 (HERC2 P6, 4294–4779aa) was cloned from rat cDNA and
inserted into a pcDNA3-HA vector.
RNAi plasmids were designed as described40: HERC2, 5′-ctaggagatgg
aacaacaaac-3′; NEURL4, 5′-ttgacaagatggtggacaaac-3′; PARK2, 5′-actccctgatta
aagagctcc-3′; RFWD2, 5′-ctacaaggatgtctcgtatct-3′; RNF8, 5′-cgctctaatggaagaact
agc-3′; RNF8.2, 5′-cagagaagttacacggcaaat-3′; UBC13, 5′-cgcaggatcatcaaggaaacc-3′;
UBCH8, 5′-tggaagaacctgtgcgtttgg-3′; UBE3A, 5′-ctacctaactgaagagaaagt-3′.
Animals. Rodents were purchased or maintained under pathogen-free conditions.
All animal experiments were done according to protocols approved by the Animal
Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine and in accor-
dance with the National Institute of Health guidelines. UBC13loxP/loxP and
GABAα6-Cre have been described49, 68.
To generate RNF8loxP/loxP mice, a loxP/FRT Neo cassette was placed flanking
exons 6 and 7 of the RNF8 gene, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The targeting
construct was transfected by electroporation into BA1 (C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv)
hybrid embryonic stem (ES) cells. Targeted BA1 hybrid ES cells were microinjected
into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Resulting chimeras with a high percentage agouti coat
color were mated to C57BL/6 FLP mice to remove the Neo cassette. The gene
targeting and generation of RNF8loxP/loxP mice were performed by Ingenious
Targeting Laboratory. The RNF8loxP/loxP mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6
background. For the RNF8 conditional knockout granule neuron-specific mice
(within the cerebellar cortex), RNF8loxP/loxP mice were mated with transgenic mice
expressing Cre recombinase under the promoter of the Math1 gene (B6.Cg-Tg
(Atoh1-cre)1Bfri/J, Jackson Laboratory)41. Genotyping for the RNF8 flox allele was
performed with the following PCR primers: 5′-GGTTACCACTCCATAAC
CATCTGTACG-3′; 5′-CAGAAGGTAGCAACAGAACACGACG-3′.

A rabbit RNF8 antibody was raised against bacterially produced glutathione-S-
transferase fusion protein containing 100–250 aa of RNF8 and purified by affinity
chromatography.
Uncropped western blot images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.
Subcellular fractionation. P8 rat cerebella were dissected and homogenized 25
times using a Dounce tissue grinder with hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.9,
10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2). The homogenate was transferred to a falcon tube and
centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was
recovered. The remaining pellet was washed with the hypotonic buffer and cen-
trifuged at 13,600 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer
(20 mM HEPES pH7.9, 20% glycerol, 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
EDTA), homogenized 10 times and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with gentle
mixing. The nuclear fraction was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10
min. The supernatant was recovered as the nuclear fraction.
Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed using P8 rat cere-
bellar cytoplasmic lysates. The cerebellum was homogenized with hypotonic buffer
(10 mM HEPES pH7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2) to separate the cytoplasmic
fraction, and nuclear lysates were prepared with an extraction buffer (20 mM
HEPES pH7.9, 20% glycerol, 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA). The
RNF8 antibody, coupled to protein G beads (GE Healthcare), was incubated
overnight at 4 °C with cytoplasmic fractions of cerebella lysates and washed with
the following buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100),
and immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting analyses.
Lysates of Neuro2A cells constitutively expressing FLAG-RNF8 were prepared
with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100 and proteinase inhibitor cocktail), incubated on ice for 20 min, and
incubated with FlagM2 agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h. The beads were washed with
lysis buffer and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting
analyses.
Lysates of 293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HA-
HERC2 P6, Flag-NEURL4, GFP-RNF8 WT, or GFP-RNF8 R42A. 293T cells were
homogenized with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail), incubated on ice for 20 min, and
incubated with the HA antibody (3F10, Roche) and mixed with protein G beads
(GE Healthcare) or Flag M2 agarose beads for 2 h. The beads were washed with
lysis buffer four times, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to
immunoblotting analyses.
Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation was performed
in Neuro2A cells. Neuro2A cells constitutively expressing Flag-RNF8 were gener-
ated by single colony isolation and maintained in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of
G418. Lysate was prepared with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail) and incubated on ice for
20 min. Lysates were incubated with FlagM2 agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h. The
beads were washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Triton X-100), and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by 3×FLAG peptide
(Sigma), followed by TCA precipitation. Proteins were trypsinized (Sequencing-
Grade Trypsin, Promega) and washed (3M Empore C18 media), and tryptic
peptides were loaded onto an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo-
Finningan). Spectra were searched against target-decoy mouse tryptic peptide
databases. ComPASS analysis was done against dedicated Neuro2A (>60 bait-runs)
IP-MS databases.
Cerebellar granule neuron cultures. Granule neurons were prepared from the
cerebellum of P6 Long Evans rat pups as described69. High-efficiency transfection
of granule neurons (maximum efficiency 80%) was achieved using a nucleofection
method with Amaxa electroporation device as described38.
In vivo electroporation and immunohistochemistry. In vivo electroporation of
postnatal rat pups was performed as described35–37. P4 Sprague Dawley rat pups or
P6–P9 mouse pups were injected with the indicated plasmids, and subjected to five
electric pulses of 175 mV (rat) or 135 mV (mouse) with 950 ms intervals. Elec-
troporated pups were returned to moms and examined 4, 8, or 12 days later
following immunohistochemistry analyses. Rat or mouse pups were fixed with 4%
PFA and 4% sucrose and labeled with the relevant antibodies. Images were taken in
a blinded manner using a NIKON eclipse TE2000 epifluorescence microscope
using a digital CCD camera (DIAGNOSTIC instruments) and analyzed using the
SPOT imaging software. Images of the synaptic proteins Bassoon and GluR2 at
parallel fiber GFP-positive varicosities were taken using a Olympus FV1200
Confocal microscope.
Electron microscopy. P24–P25 mice were perfused with 2% formaldehyde and
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cerebellum
was collected, postfixed overnight, and stored in fixative solution, and embedded in
4% agar. Sections (0.9 mm) were cut sagittally, rinsed in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer 3
times for 10 min each, and subjected to a secondary fixation step for 1 h in 1%
osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer on ice. Sam-
ples were next washed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 min each and en bloc

 stained for 1 h with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. After staining was complete,
samples were briefly washed in ultrapure water, dehydrated in a graded acetone
series (50%, 70%, 90%, 100% × 2) for 10 min in each step, infiltrated with micro-
wave assistance (Pelco BioWave Pro, Redding, CA) into LX112 resin, and flat
embedded between two slides that had been coated with PTFE release agent
(Miller-Stephenson #MS-143XD, Danbury, CT) and clamped with binder clips.
Samples were cured in an oven at 60˚C for 48 h. Slides were separated and mounted
on a blank stub with epoxy. In total, 70 nm thin sections were then taken, coun-
terstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged on a TEM (JEOL JEM-
1400 Plus, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 KeV with an AMT XR111 camera.
Electrophysiology. Acute 300 μm sagittal and coronal slices were prepared from
the cerebellum of P20–P25 RNF8 cKO and control RNF8loxP/loxP or P23–P26
UBC13 cKO and control UBC13loxP/loxP mice. Slices were cut in dissecting solution
containing: 83 mM NaCl, 65 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM glucose, 6.8
mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 0.5 CaCl2. Slices were incubated at
35 °C for 1 h in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 125 mM NaCl, 26
mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and
25 mM glucose, and switched to room temperature prior to recording. Slice
solutions were constantly bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Electrophysiological
signals were acquired with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized at 10 kHz with a
Digidata 1440 A D-A converter, and Bessel filtered at 2 kHz.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in Purkinje cells were obtained with
electrodes (2–3 MΩ) filled with intracellular solution containing 130 mM Cs-
methanesulfonate, 5 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 2
mM Na2-ATP, and 0.5 mM Na2-GTP for mEPSC recordings, or with intracellular
solution containing 125 mM K-gluconate, 15 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM Mg-
ATP, 0.3 mM Na2-GTP, 10 mM Na2-phosphocreatine, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM
Qx-314 for evoked EPSC recordings. Purkinje neurons were voltage-clamped at
−70 mV. For mEPSC recordings, 1 μM tetrodotoxin and 20 μM picrotoxin was
added to ACSF. The parameters of mEPSC analyses in the MiniAnalysis software
used were: threshold: 6 pA; period to search a local maximum (μs): 10,000; time
before a peak for baseline (μs): 8000; period to search a decay time (μs): 20,000;
fraction of peak to find decay time: 0.37; period to average a baseline (μs): 1000;
area threshold: 15; number of points to average for peak: 1. For evoked EPSC
recordings, 20 μM picrotoxin was added to ACSF. mEPSC traces were additionally
low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. For evoked EPSC and presynaptic volley recordings, the
molecular layer was stimulated with a bipolar concentric electrode using brief (0.1
ms) current pulses. Evoked EPSCs were measured using the whole-cell recording
electrodes as described above. Extracellular presynaptic volley recordings using 1
MΩ electrodes filled with 3 M NaCl were made 400 μm away from the site of
stimulation70. The fiber volley amplitude was derived from the negative-going
phase of the extracellular field potential. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in
cerebellar granule neurons were obtained with electrodes (7–8 MΩ) filled with
intracellular solution containing 125 mM K-gluconate, 15 mM KCl, 10 mM
HEPES, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na2-GTP, 10 mM Na2-phosphocreatine and 0.2
mM EGTA. For electrophysiological properties of intrinsic excitability of cerebellar
granule neurons, a series of depolarizing current steps (10, 20, 30, 40 pA) of 500 ms
duration under current clamp were applied to the recorded cerebellar granule
neuron. The evoked AP patterns were recorded and the number and amplitude of
APs during the 500 ms depolarizing current injection step and the input resistance
were measured. For paired-pulse facilitation at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses,
a paired electrical stimulation with a 50 ms inter-pulse interval was applied to the
parallel fiber bundles and the evoked EPSCs were recorded in the Purkinje cells.
Paired-pulse facilitation was measured by calculating the ratio of the second EPSC
amplitude to the first EPSC amplitude.
qRT-PCR. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with Superscript III
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR reactions were
performed using Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). The following

Delayed eye-blink conditioning assay. The delayed eye-blink conditioning assay
was performed as described with modifications60. UBC13 conditional knockout,
RNF8 conditional knockout, or littermate control mice at 8-9 weeks of age were
used. Mice anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg) were
implanted with a head plate placed over the skull bregma and secured with screws
using Metabond cement (Parkell). Five days following recovery from surgery, head-
fixed mice were habituated on a cylindrical treadmill over two 2 h sessions. After
training, mice were tested with the head-fixed eye-blink conditioning apparatus.
Mice learned to blink in response to an initially neutral CS (blue LED) that is
paired with an eyeblink-eliciting US 20 psi periocular air puff through a flattened
25 gauge needle; CS–US interstimulus interval, 150 msec). 100 trials of CS and US
pairing were performed for each day, and learned eyelid CR was tracked over 7
consecutive days using a high-speed monochrome camera (Allied Vison). The
eyelid position was calculated on each frame by the “pixel area” method described
previously60, and quantified in units of fraction eyelid closure, ranging from 0 (fully
open) to 1 (fully closed). Eyelid closure >0.1 during the ISI period was defined as a
CR. The percentage of trials during each session containing CRs was used as the
index of motor learning.
Accelerating rotarod behavior assay. The accelerating rotarod assay was per-
formed using RNF8 conditional knockout or control littermate mice at 8–9 weeks
of age. On the first day, mice were habituated on the rotarod apparatus (IITC
RotaRod) rotating at a constant 5 rotations per minute (rpm). Mice were then
tested on the rotarod, which was accelerating from 5 to 40 rpm over a period of 3
min and the latency to which each mouse fell from the rod onto the sensing
platform below was recorded automatically. Each daily session consisted of three
trials with a 10 min intertrial interval, and each mouse was tested for five sessions
over sequential days.
Open-field assay. The open-field assay was performed using 6–8-week-old lit-
termate RNF8 conditional knockout or control littermate mice. Mice were placed
in the center of the open-field arena (45 × 23 cm) and allowed to move freely for 15
minutes. The position of mice was tracked by a video camera and analyzed using a
custom-written MATLAB script.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. Bar
graphs are presented as the mean ± SEM. For experiments in which only two
groups were analyzed, the t test was used. Pairwise comparisons within multiple
groups were done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher’s PLSD
post hoc test. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for analyses of the cumulative
distribution of EPSC amplitude and frequency.
