Abstract
Importance—It remains unclear whether telemonitoring approaches provide benefits for patients 
with heart failure (HF) after hospitalization.
Objective—To evaluate the effectiveness of a care transition intervention using remote patient 
monitoring in reducing 180-day all-cause readmissions among a broad population of older adults 
hospitalized with HF.
Design, Setting, and Participants—We randomized 1437 patients hospitalized for HF 
between October 12, 2011, and September 30, 2013, to the intervention arm (715 patients) or to 
the usual care arm (722 patients) of the Better Effectiveness After Transition–Heart Failure 
(BEAT-HF) study and observed them for 180 days. The dates of our study analysis were March 
30, 2014, to October 1, 2015. The setting was 6 academic medical centers in California. 
Participants were hospitalized individuals 50 years or older who received active treatment for 
decompensated HF.
Interventions—The intervention combined health coaching telephone calls and telemonitoring. 
Telemonitoring used electronic equipment that collected daily information about blood pressure, 
heart rate, symptoms, and weight. Centralized registered nurses conducted telemonitoring reviews, 
protocolized actions, and telephone calls.

 Main outcomes and measures—The primary outcome was readmission for any cause within 
180 days after discharge. Secondary outcomes were all-cause readmission within 30 days, all-
cause mortality at 30 and 180 days, and quality of life at 30 and 180 days.
Results—Among 1437 participants, the median age was 73 years. Overall, 46.2% (664 of 1437) 
were female, and 22.0% (316 of 1437) were African American. The intervention and usual care 
groups did not differ significantly in readmissions for any cause 180 days after discharge, which 
occurred in 50.8% (363 of 715) and 49.2% (355 of 722) of patients, respectively (adjusted hazard 
ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.20; P = .74). In secondary analyses, there were no significant 
differences in 30-day readmission or 180-day mortality, but there was a significant difference in 
180-day quality of life between the intervention and usual care groups. No adverse events were 
reported.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among patients hospitalized for HF, combined health coaching 
telephone calls and telemonitoring did not reduce 180-day readmissions.
Trial Registration—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01360203
Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent condition in the United States, affecting 5.8 million 
patients,1 and is associated with high hospitalization and readmission rates, mortality, and 
cost of care.1-6 For patients with HF, discontinuities and lack of post-acute care monitoring 
can increase overall health care resource use through readmissions or worsened morbidity.7,8 
Persistently high readmission rates for patients with HF suggest that further improvements to 
existing care transition approaches are needed,1,9 as evidenced by the readmission-related 
financial penalties of approximately $428 million affecting 2610 hospitals in the third year 
of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hospital Readmission Reduction 
Program.10
Interventions to improve the care transition process have been shown to reduce readmissions 
while potentially improving morbidity and mortality in randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs),11-14 particularly for patients with HF.15 However, many of these interventions were 
tested in single centers with limited numbers of patients. Moreover, sustainability of 
research-derived care transition approaches is difficult, with many requiring intensive in-
person interactions that are not always acceptable to patients16,17 and incurring costs to 
health professional organizations that may not be favorable under current health care 
financing arrangements.18 Telehealth technology, including mobile health and remote patient 
monitoring technologies, potentially provides more cost-effective solutions to the problems 
of financial viability and home visit acceptability by substituting for in-person interactions. 
However, its effectiveness to date (particularly in patients with HF) has been mixed. The 
largest RCT in the United States to date in this area, Telemonitoring to Improve Heart 
Failure Outcomes, did not show any significant benefit from its telehealth approach,19 
perhaps because of the type of technology used, low adherence rates, lack of patient 
engagement before discharge, or handling of values that exceeded threshold variables.19,20 
Another large RCT in Europe with high adherence rates and improved technology also 
showed no significant benefit.21 However, systematic reviews that include these studies 
continue to suggest significant reductions in mortality, morbidity, and HF-related 
hospitalizations.22-24

 The objective of the Better Effectiveness After Transition–Heart Failure (BEAT-HF) study 
was to evaluate the effectiveness of a care transition intervention using remote patient 
monitoring in reducing 180-day all-cause readmissions among a broad population of older 
adults hospitalized with HF. It was designed to address issues identified with the 
Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes RCT, including using newer remote 
monitoring approaches, engaging patients before discharge, and pairing remote monitoring 
with a telephone-based nurse care manager via scheduled contacts similar to in-person care 
transition programs.
Methods
Study Design
The BEAT-HF study was a prospective, 2-arm (with a 1:1 randomization) multicenter RCT 
conducted at 6 academic medical centers in California to compare usual care with a 
telehealth-based care transition intervention for older patients who are discharged home after 
inpatient treatment for decompensated HF.25 Five of the sites are part of the University of 
California system, including the University of California in Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San 
Diego, and San Francisco. The sixth location is Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, which has a mixed-model medical staff that includes full-time faculty, a 
multispecialty group practice, and many independent private physicians. Three of the sites 
are major heart transplant centers, and an additional 3 serve as safety-net hospitals for their 
respective regions. Block randomization was conducted within each site using random 
blocks of 4 to 8 individuals via a web-based, computerized, random number generator. The 
study was approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) institutional 
review board, and all other study institutions were subject to the UCLA institutional review 
board review. A data and safety monitoring board was convened for the study and reviewed 
data during the study enrollment period. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT01360203). The full study protocol can be found in the Supplement.
Patient Population
Individuals admitted as hospital inpatients or on observation status were eligible if they were 
50 years or older, were receiving active treatment for decompensated HF (defined as HF 
with the initiation of or an increase in diuretic treatment), were expected to be discharged to 
their home, and were capable of providing written informed consent in English, Spanish, 
Farsi, or Russian. Enrollment criteria were expanded in January 2012 to include all patients 
being actively treated for HF instead of just those having a principal diagnosis of HF. This 
change was made because patients deemed prospectively as not having a principal diagnosis 
of HF were being coded as patients with HF after their discharge because of patients with 
multiple active problems.
The study exclusions can be grouped into 3 main categories.25 First were patients who did 
not have the cognitive or physical ability (eg, dementia or weight >204 kg) or access to 
resources (eg, working telephone or usual source of care) required to participate fully in the 
BEAT-HF intervention. Second were patients already in a system of care providing more 
health professional contacts than the planned intervention (eg, living in a skilled nursing

 facility, receiving chronic hemodialysis, or awaiting or having received an organ transplant). 
Third were patients whose HF was due to acardiovascular condition that was expected to 
improve because of medical intervention (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention or 
interventional valve procedure during hospitalization).
Intervention
The intervention consisted of the following 3 components conducted by registered nurses: 
predischarge HF education, regularly scheduled telephone coaching, and home 
telemonitoring of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms.25 The predischarge 
health education was conducted by a study nurse who was not part of the usual care team. 
The nurse guided patients through a booklet developed for patients with low health literacy 
that covered an explanation of HF, medication adherence, salt avoidance, fluid monitoring, 
exercising with HF, and daily checkup of weight and edema, as well as when to call the HF 
treatment team.26 The study nurse used the “teach-back” method to ensure patient 
understanding.27,28 The predischarge education also included a demonstration of how to use 
the remote home telemonitoring equipment and an explanation of why monitoring 
physiological variables is important for patients.
The electronic equipment (Bluetooth enabled; Bluetooth SIG, Inc) consisted of a wireless 
transmission pod, a weight scale, and a blood pressure and heart rate monitor integrated with 
a device that could display text questions and send simple text responses. Devices 
automatically transmitted data back to central servers for telemonitoring review by telephone 
call center study nurses based at the primary study site.
Intervention patients were scheduled to receive 9 telephone coaching calls over a 6-month 
period, generally from the same call center nurse, who had access to patients' medical 
histories and medication records. The nurse first contacted each enrolled patient 2 or 3 days 
after discharge from the hospital to reinforce the predischarge health coaching topics. 
Subsequent telephone nurse coaching then occurred on a weekly basis during the first month 
after discharge. After the first month, nurse coaching telephone calls were made monthly 
until the end of the 6-month study period. All telephone calls covered content reinforcing the 
predischarge education materials. Intervention patients were asked to use the telemonitoring 
equipment daily to transmit their weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and responses to 3 
symptom questions, which were sent via cellular bandwidth to a secure server and were 
accessed daily by the telephone call center nurses. Readings that exceeded predetermined 
threshold variables generated a trigger for the telephone call center nurse to telephone the 
patient to investigate potential causes. When symptoms were concerning, patients were 
encouraged to contact their health professionals, although these individuals were also 
notified by the telephone call center nurses. If deemed necessary, the telephone call center 
nurses advised patients to call 911 or go to their nearest hospital emergency department. 
Telephone call center nurses also called patients who had stopped transmitting data to 
determine the reason and encourage the patient to resume daily monitoring.
Usual care at the sites included robust predischarge education and often a postdischarge 
follow-up telephone call.29 No additional surveillance was provided to control patients 
beyond whatever may have been requested as part of routine clinical practice, and the

 intervention did not substitute for usual care surveillance. Patients were not precluded from 
exposure to other readmission reduction or chronic disease management programs 
implemented by hospitals, physician groups, or health plans, such as education about HF, 
pharmacist consultation, and postdischarge telephone calls.
For all participants, enrollment nurses conducted baseline surveys via in-person interviews 
before randomization. On completion, patients were randomized via the web-based 
enrollment software, with randomization notification provided by the enrollment nurse. All 
participants were contacted for survey interviews at 7 days, 30 days, and 180 days after 
discharge by staff at the coordinating center who were unaware of the treatment 
randomizations. During these telephone interviews, information was collected about quality 
of life, satisfaction with care, and use of medications.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was 180-day all-cause readmission. Secondary outcomes 
reported herein include 30-day all-cause readmission, 30-day mortality, and 180-day 
mortality.25 Readmissions were identified from participating sites' hospitalization data, 
combined with California's inpatient discharge data for hospitalizations at nonstudy sites 
obtained from the California Department of Public Health Office of Statewide Health 
Planning and Development. Mortality was assessed using the Social Security and National 
Death Index, hospital data systems, contact with family members, and searches of 
obituaries.30 Quality of life was measured using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure 
Questionnaire conducted via computer-assisted telephone interview.30
Statistical Analysis
Our sample size provided 80% power to detect a relative reduction of 28% in the primary 
outcome of 180-day readmission with a type I error of 0.05 after adjusting for within-
hospital clustering. We conducted unadjusted intent-to-treat analyses. Individuals who had 
fully withdrawn consent were censored on the date of withdrawal in hazard models for the 
primary outcome and for secondary outcomes related to readmission and mortality. We 
conducted unadjusted analyses, followed by prespecified multivariable analyses to adjust for 
patient characteristics that may have been unequally distributed across treatment groups and 
may have influenced outcomes. These multivariable analyses include logistic regression 
models for readmission and mortality analyses. Models controlled for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, insurance, comorbidities based on the Health Care Utilization Project methods,6 
year and quarter of enrollment, social isolation as measured by the Lubben Social Network 
Scale score,31 and income level. Enrollment site was controlled for using random effects. 
Models also controlled for baseline quality-of-life scores in quality-of-life score analyses. 
Quality-of-life 30-day and 180-day analyses were only conducted for those individuals who 
reported quality-of-life data at the analyzed time point. After adjusting for days alive, 
adherence was measured in each measurement period separately for health coaching 
telephone calls (as the percentage of protocol-required calls that were completed) and for 
telemonitoring (as the percentage of days transmitting any type of data using 
telemonitoring).

 Results
We assessed 30 844 individuals between October 12, 2011, and September 30, 2013, for 
study eligibility (Figure 1). Of these individuals, 28 476 did not meet inclusion criteria, 
including 18 005 patients without decompensated HF, 1383 transplant patients or candidates, 
and 1122 hemodialysis patients. Another 550 individuals declined to participate, and 381 
individuals were discharged or died before they could be approached regarding the study. In 
total, 1437 patients were enrolled and randomized in the study, with 715 randomized to the 
intervention and 722 randomized to usual care. Thirty-three participants (20 intervention and 
13 usual care) completely withdrew from the study. No individuals withdrew because of 
adverse events. There were no significant differences in participant characteristics (Table 1 
and Table 2) between intervention and control participants. The median age of participants 
was 73 years. In total, 46.2% (664 of 1437) were female, 22.0% (316 of 1437) were African 
American, and 61.2% (880 of 1437) had a New York Heart Association classification of III 
or IV during their enrollment hospitalization.
Overall, 82.7% (591 of 715) of intervention participants used the telemonitoring equipment. 
Among intervention patients, telemonitoring adherence was documented in 55.4% (396 of 
715) of total days at 30 days and in 51.7% (370 of 715) of total days at 180 days, while 
telephone coaching adherence was 61.4% (439 of 715) of total telephone calls at 30 days 
and 68.0% (486 of 715) of total telephone calls at 180 days. There were 221 211 remote 
patient observations, including 18 531 observations that exceeded threshold variables, with a 
median of 22 (interquartile range [IQR], 8-48) per intervention patient. There were 3700 
scheduled health coaching telephone calls completed, with a median of 6 (IQR, 3-8) per 
intervention patient.
Primary Outcome
The overall proportion of study participants who experienced our primary outcome 
(unadjusted, 180-day all-cause readmission) was 50.0% (718 of 1437) (Table 3). There was 
no significant difference detected in unadjusted (P = .42) or adjusted (P = .39) analyses 
between the proportion of intervention participants (50.8% [363 of 715]) or usual care 
participants (49.2% [355 of 722]) with 180-day all-cause readmission. The unadjusted 
hazard ratio for 180-day all-cause readmission with receipt of the intervention was 1.03 
(95% CI, 0.89-1.19; P = .73). The adjusted hazard ratio for 180-day all-cause readmission 
with receipt of the intervention was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.88-1.20; P = .74) (Figure 2). Subgroup 
analyses for our primary outcome showed no significant differences for those 65 years or 
older, male or female sex, race/ethnicity categories, or New York Heart Association 
classification. None of the subgroups showed evidence of meaningful effect modification 
(Table 4).
Secondary Outcomes
Findings for 30-day readmission mirrored those for 180-day readmission. The overall 
proportion of study participants with 30-day all-cause readmission was 22.7% (162 of 715) 
(Table 2). There was no significant difference detected in unadjusted (P = .56) or adjusted (P 
= .63) analyses between the proportion of intervention participants (22.7% [162 of 715]) or 
Ong et al.

 usual care participants (21.6% [156 of 722]) with 30-day all-cause readmission. The 
unadjusted hazard ratio for 30-day all-cause readmission with receipt of the intervention was 
1.03 (95% CI, 0.83-1.29; P = .77). The adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day all-cause 
readmission with receipt of the intervention was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.80-1.28; P = .91) (Figure 
2).
The overall proportion of study participants with 30-day all-cause mortality was 4.4% (63 of 
1437) (Table 2). Nonsignificant differences were detected in unadjusted analysis (P = .06) 
and significant differences in adjusted analysis (P = .04) between the proportion of 
intervention participants (3.4% [24 of 715]) or usual care participants (5.4% [39 of 722]) 
with 30-day all-cause mortality. The unadjusted hazard ratio for 30-day all-cause mortality 
with receipt of the intervention was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02; P = .06), and the adjusted 
hazard ratio for 30-day all-cause mortality with receipt of the intervention was 0.53 (95% 
CI, 0.31-0.93; P = .03) (Figure 2). Review of the timing of deaths indicates that this finding 
was because of in-hospital death differences after randomization, which would make it less 
likely to be owing to the intervention.
The overall proportion of study participants with 180-day all-cause mortality was 14.9% 
(214 of 1437) (Table 2). There was no significant difference detected in unadjusted (P = .34) 
or adjusted (P = .30) analyses between the proportion of intervention participants (14.0% 
[100 of 715]) or usual care participants (15.8% [114 of 722]) with 180-day all-cause 
mortality. The hazard ratio for 180-day all-cause mortality with receipt of the intervention 
was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67-1.15; P = .32), and the adjusted hazard ratio for 180-day all-cause 
mortality with receipt of the intervention was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.64-1.13; P = .26) (Figure 2).
The overall mean, 30-day quality-of-life score was 31.23, and the overall mean, 180-day 
quality-of-life score was 30.49 (Table 3). There was a significant difference in 180-day 
quality-of-life scores between the intervention participants (mean, 28.50) and the control 
participants (mean, 32.63) in unadjusted (P = .02) and adjusted (P = .02) analyses.
Discussion
The BEAT-HF study is one of the largest RCTs of remote patient telemonitoring in an HF 
population. It was designed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention using a broad 
population of patients hospitalized with HF that would be consistent with actual practice. 
Similar to other large RCTs of telemonitoring, we did not find significant effects of the 
BEAT-HF intervention on all-cause readmission within the first 30 or 180 days. The 
physiological signals of changes in daily weights and increased symptoms may not provide 
adequate warning of impending decompensation in patients with HF.20,32 Trials of 
implanted hemodynamic monitoring systems in ambulatory patients with HF have shown 
that weight is a poor surrogate for filling pressures and is not a reliable signal for impendent 
decompensation.33 However, readmission is also increasingly recognized as a complex 
phenomenon, the cause of which is not solely limited to physiological variables.34 In 
addition, all participating sites were already focused on readmissions among patients with 
HF because of impending potential penalties from the Hospital Readmission Reduction 
Program and had implemented readmission reduction efforts.29 Similar types of

 interventions potentially could show effects among patients who have not previously been 
the focus of readmission reduction efforts.
Although the primary and secondary readmission outcome measures were not met, we found 
that the BEAT-HF intervention had significant effects on adjusted analyses of the 
prespecified secondary outcome measure of 30-day mortality. However, review of deaths 
suggests that this finding was a result of in-hospital death differences after randomization, 
which would make it less likely to be due to the intervention.
We also found that the BEAT-HF intervention had significant effects on quality of life 
among 180-day survey respondents. Findings for quality of life are limited by survey 
response rates. Although these rates were stable between 30 days and 180 days after 
accounting for mortality, survey nonrespondents differed in baseline characteristics from 
survey respondents and potentially could have different quality-of-life outcomes. Further 
study would be required to validate this finding because the BEAT-HF trial was not 
specifically designed or powered for this outcome.
The BEAT-HF study had several limitations. Because the major source of the BEAT-HF 
funding was derived from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds, we 
could not extend enrollment beyond September 30, 2013. Doing so may have strengthened 
the 30-day mortality findings because the study was not powered for this specific outcome. 
The study sites are all academic medical centers in California, which could limit 
generalizability. However, half of the sites included safety-net hospitals, and the broad 
patient eligibility criteria increase generalizability. The use of other types of personnel 
instead of registered nurses potentially could have affected study outcomes. The intervention 
was not directly integrated with the physician practices caring for the patients, which is 
increasingly possible with advances in electronic health records. The effectiveness of 
transition of care, disease management, and telemonitoring interventions may be highly 
dependent on how they are integrated and adhered to in practice.32 Adherence to the BEAT-
HF intervention appears to have been a critical factor. Despite deploying several strategies to 
promote patient engagement and foster adherence with the telemonitoring and telephone call 
center intervention, only 61.4% (439 of 715) and 55.4% (396 of 715) of patients randomized 
to the intervention were more than 50% adherent to telephone calls and telemonitoring, 
respectively, within the first 30 days. Remote patient monitoring has also experienced 
significant technological change, including increasing use of tablets and other remote 
sensors. Newer approaches, such as implantable devices, could increase adherence or 
provide better information to identify problems after discharge.
Conclusions
The BEAT-HF study found that a combination of remote patient monitoring with care 
transition management did not reduce 180-day all-cause readmission after hospitalization for 
HF. Hospitalizations in the first 30 days and 180-day mortality were also not reduced with 
the intervention. Individuals participating in this intervention may experience quality-of-life 
improvements at 180 days. However, further studies would be needed to confirm these 
findings.

 Figure 2. Hazard Ratios for Readmission and Mortality at 30 Days and 180 Days
Dashed lines are for the intervention, and solid lines are for usual care. Adjusted hazard 
ratios, 95% CIs, and P values are from multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression 
models for readmission and mortality analyses. Models controlled for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, insurance, income, social isolation, comorbidities, year, and quarter of enrollment, 
with enrollment site controlled for as random effects. A and B, The hazard ratio for 30-day 
readmission with the intervention is 1.03 (95% CI, 0.83-1.29; P = .77). The adjusted hazard 
ratio for 30-day readmission with the intervention is 1.01 (95% CI, 0.80-1.28; P = .91). The 
hazard ratio for 180-day readmission with the intervention is 1.03 (95% CI, 0.89-1.19; P = .
73). The adjusted hazard ratio for 180-day readmission with the intervention is 1.03 (95% 
CI, 0.88-1.20; P = .74). C and D, The hazard ratio for 30-day mortality with the intervention 
is 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02; P = .06). The adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality with the 
intervention is 0.53 (95% CI, 0.31-0.93; P = .03). The hazard ratio for 180-day mortality 
with the intervention is 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67-1.15; P = .32). The adjusted hazard ratio for 180-
day mortality with the intervention is 0.85 (95% CI, 0.64-1.13; P = .26).
