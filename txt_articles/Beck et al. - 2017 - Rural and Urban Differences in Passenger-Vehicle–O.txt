Abstract
Problem/Condition: Motor-vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States. Compared with urban residents, 
rural residents are at an increased risk for death from crashes and are less likely to wear seat belts. These differences have not been 
well described by levels of rurality.
Reporting Period: 2014.
Description of Systems: Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) were used to identify passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths from motor-vehicle crashes and estimate the prevalence of seat belt 
use. FARS, a census of U.S. motor-vehicle crashes involving one or more deaths, was used to identify passenger-vehicle–occupant 
deaths among adults aged ≥18 years. Passenger-vehicle occupants were defined as persons driving or riding in passenger cars, light 
trucks, vans, or sport utility vehicles. Death rates per 100,000 population, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population and the 
proportion of occupants who were unrestrained at the time of the fatal crash, were calculated. BRFSS, an annual, state-based, random-
digit–dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged ≥18 years, was used to estimate prevalence of 
seat belt use. FARS and BRFSS data were analyzed by a six-level rural-urban designation, based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
2013 rural-urban continuum codes, and stratified by census region and type of state seat belt enforcement law (primary or secondary).
Results: Within each census region, age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates per 100,000 population increased with 
increasing rurality, from the most urban to the most rural counties: South, 6.8 to 29.2; Midwest, 5.3 to 25.8; West, 3.9 to 40.0; 
and Northeast, 3.5 to 10.8. (For the Northeast, data for the most rural counties were not reported because of suppression criteria; 
comparison is for the most urban to the second-most rural counties.) Similarly, the proportion of occupants who were unrestrained 
at the time of the fatal crash increased as rurality increased. Self-reported seat belt use in the United States decreased with increasing 
rurality, ranging from 88.8% in the most urban counties to 74.7% in the most rural counties. Similar differences in age-adjusted 
death rates and seat belt use were observed in states with primary and secondary seat belt enforcement laws.
Interpretation: Rurality was associated with higher age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates, a higher proportion of 
unrestrained passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths, and lower seat belt use among adults in all census regions and regardless of state 
seat belt enforcement type.
Public Health Actions: Seat belt use decreases and age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates increase with increasing levels 
of rurality. Improving seat belt use remains a critical strategy to reduce crash-related deaths in the United States, especially in rural 
areas where seat belt use is lower and age-adjusted death rates are higher than in urban areas. States and communities can consider 
using evidence-based interventions to reduce rural-urban disparities in seat belt use and passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates.

Introduction
Motor-vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death 
nationwide, and persons traveling on rural roads or living 
in rural areas are at an increased risk for death from a 
motor-vehicle crash (1,2). In 2015, an estimated 19% of 
the U.S. population lived in rural areas, yet more than half 
(57%) of the 22,441 passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths 
occurred on rural roads (3,4). Although the total number 
of crashes is typically higher in urban areas, a much higher 
proportion of rural crashes result in death (5). Per 100 
million vehicle miles traveled, the rate of all traffic deaths 
on rural roads (1.8) is 2.6 times the rate of all traffic deaths 
on urban roads (0.7) (1).

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Multiple efforts in the United States are underway to reduce 
injuries and deaths from motor-vehicle crashes. In 2010, the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established 
the Healthy People 2020 objectives (https://www.healthypeople.
gov/2020/topics-objectives). Healthy People 2020 includes 
objectives to reduce all deaths related to motor-vehicle crashes 
to 12.4 deaths per 100,000 population and increase observed 
seat belt use to 92% by 2020. Also in 2010, CDC named 
prevention of motor-vehicle injuries a CDC winnable battle, 
a public health priority with a substantial impact on public 
health and with known effective strategies to address the issue 
(https://www.cdc.gov/winnablebattles/report/index.html). In 
October 2016, the National Safety Council, in partnership 
with the U.S. Department of Transportation, launched the 
Road to Zero initiative with the goal to eliminate road traffic 
deaths in the United States within 30 years (http://www.nsc.
org/learn/NSC-Initiatives/Pages/The-Road-to-Zero.aspx). 
Increasing seat belt use, which reduces the risk for severe injury 
and death in a crash by approximately 50% (6), will help to 
reach these goals.
Part of the disparity in crash deaths in urban and rural areas 
is likely because of differences in seat belt use among passenger-
vehicle occupants (7,8). Half (50%) of fatally injured occupants 
on rural roads were unrestrained in 2015, compared with 46% 
of fatally injured occupants on urban roads (1). Self-report 
surveys have documented lower levels of rural respondents who 
report always using a seat belt (7,8), even after adjusting for 
other factors associated with restraint use, such as body mass 
index (BMI), education, and household income (7).
One strategy states have used to increase seat belt use is 
to implement and enforce seat belt laws. Primary seat belt 
enforcement allows an officer to ticket drivers or passengers for 
not wearing a seat belt even if this is the only violation that has 
occurred. This differs from secondary seat belt enforcement, 
which only allows an officer to ticket a driver or passenger for 
failure to wear a seat belt when another violation (e.g., speeding 
or reckless driving) has also occurred. Primary enforcement, 
compared with secondary enforcement, has been associated 
with increased seat belt use (7,9) and reduced numbers of 
crash deaths (10,11).
Although rural-urban differences in risk behaviors and 
outcomes related to crash injuries are commonly reported 
using a dichotomous measure of rural versus urban (or 
nonmetropolitan versus metropolitan), other measures are 
available that allow examination of rural-urban differences in 
more detail (12,13). The purpose of this report is to examine 
differences in age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death 
rates, the proportion of passenger-vehicle occupants who were 
unrestrained at the time of the fatal crash, and self-reported seat 
belt use among adults in rural and urban counties, as measured 
on a six-level continuum and according to type of state seat 
belt enforcement. Alcohol-impaired driving and speeding 
among adults also were examined because these risk factors are 
related to lower rates of seat belt use (14). The findings in this 
report can be used by public health professionals, road safety 
professionals, and decision-makers to better understand and 
prevent rural-urban disparities in passenger-vehicle–occupant 
deaths and seat belt use to prevent injuries and deaths.
Methods
Data Sources and Analyses 
The prevalence of self-reported seat belt use and alcohol-
impaired driving was determined for the United States 
(50 states and the District of Columbia [DC]) using 2014 data 
(the most recent available) from CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS). BRFSS is an annual, random-
digit–dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized 
U.S. civilian population aged ≥18 years conducted annually 
in all 50 states, DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Detailed information regarding the survey is available 
online (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2014.
html). The median response rate for the 50 states and DC 
in 2014 was 47.0%; response rates ranged from 25.1% 
(California) to 60.1% (South Dakota) (https://www.cdc.gov/
brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/2014_dqr.pdf). The response rate 
is the number of respondents who completed the survey as a 
proportion of all eligible and likely eligible persons. Statistical 
software that accounts for the complex sampling design of 
BRFSS was used for the analyses. Prevalence estimates and 
their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), rate ratios (RRs) and their 
95% CIs, and p values comparing primary and secondary state 
enforcement types were calculated, and tests for trends in seat 
belt use across the rural-urban continuum were conducted by 
modeling the county classification as a continuous variable. 
Results with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
Estimates based on <20 respondents or with a relative 
standard error (RSE) ≥30% were deemed unreliable and were 
suppressed. Estimates based on 20–49 respondents and RSE 
<30% were reported but noted as potentially unreliable.
The age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates 
among adults aged ≥18 years and proportion of adult passenger-
vehicle occupants who were unrestrained at the time of the 
fatal crash were calculated for the United States (50 states and 
DC) using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System 
(FARS) 2014 Final FARS Report File (the most recent available) 
(15). FARS is a census of all U.S. crashes on public roadways 
involving one or more deaths (that occur within 30 days of the 
crash) that is maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
 Surveillance Summaries

Administration (NHTSA) through a cooperative agreement 
with all states, DC, and Puerto Rico (https://crashstats.nhtsa.
dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811992). 
Death rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard 
population. Age-adjusted rates are reported per 100,000 
population, and 95% CIs were constructed using a gamma 
distribution. To calculate age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–
occupant death rates, statistical software was used to aggregate 
data by age group, seat belt enforcement type, and county 
where the crash occurred. Next, 2014 bridged-race population 
estimates for the U.S. population aged ≥18 years were obtained 
from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) vintage 
2015 bridged-race postcensal population estimates (16). This 
data set provides single year-of-age population estimates at the 
county level by year. Aggregated death data from FARS were 
matched with census population data and county classification 
using Federal Information Processing Standards codes. Because 
motor-vehicle death rates have been previously shown to vary 
by census region, (17) and seat belt enforcement type also varies 
by census region, age-adjusted death rates were stratified by 
census region. Age-adjusted death rates also were calculated 
by whether the crash death was speeding related or involved 
an alcohol-impaired driver. 
To determine the proportion of passenger-vehicle occupants 
who were unrestrained at the time of the fatal crash, FARS 
data for all fatally injured passenger-vehicle occupants aged 
≥18 years were grouped by county classification and state seat 
belt enforcement type. Among the 19,528 deaths meeting the 
original study criteria, 1,542 (7.9%) were excluded because 
restraint use at the time of the crash was unknown. 
Age-adjusted death rate RRs and 95% CIs were used to 
assess whether death rates differed significantly by enforcement 
type. Age-adjusted death rates based on <20 deaths or with 
RSE ≥30% were deemed unreliable and suppressed. Age-
adjusted alcohol-impaired driving death rates were pooled 
and analyzed using the appropriate statistical procedures for 
multiply imputed data. Joinpoint regression was used to assess 
linear trends both in age-adjusted death rates and proportion 
of deaths among unrestrained passengers across the rural-urban 
continuum. Zero joinpoints were used to assess a general linear 
trend, and significance was assessed at the 0.05 level.
Rural-Urban Continuum and 
Metropolitan Status
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed 
the 2013 rural-urban continuum codes (RUCCs), which 
classify counties into one of nine levels (13). Counties are 
first identified as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan using 
Office of Management and Budget designations. Metropolitan 
counties are further classified according to the population 
size of the larger metropolitan area to which they belong. 
Nonmetropolitan counties are classified according to the urban 
population size within the county as well as their adjacency to 
a metropolitan county.
In this report, USDA’s nine RUCCs were collapsed into 
six levels, based on the population of the largest urban area 
and metropolitan or nonmetropolitan status: RUCC 1 
(metropolitan areas of ≥1,000,000 population), RUCC 2 
(metropolitan areas of 250,000–999,999 population), RUCC 3 
(metropolitan areas of <250,000 population), RUCCs 4 and 5 
(nonmetropolitan areas with an urban population of ≥20,000), 
RUCCs 6 and 7 (nonmetropolitan areas with an urban 
population of 2,500–19,999), and RUCCs 8 and 9 
(nonmetropolitan areas with an urban population of <2,500). 
In this report, the terms urban and rural are used to refer to 
counties along a continuum based on urban population size: 
more rural counties have a smaller urban population, and 
more urban counties have a larger urban population. The term 
metropolitan is used when referencing results for the three 
metropolitan areas combined, and the term nonmetropolitan 
is used when referencing results for the three nonmetropolitan 
areas combined. This terminology is consistent with the USDA 
RUCC definitions (13).
Seat Belt Enforcement
Seat belt enforcement type varies by state and can be 
primary or secondary. In states with primary enforcement 
laws, officers can ticket a driver or passenger for not wearing 
a seat belt, even if no other offense has occurred. In states with 
secondary laws, officers can only ticket drivers or passengers 
for not wearing a seat belt when another traffic offense has 
occurred. In 2014, a total of 33 states and DC had primary 
enforcement, 16 states had secondary enforcement, and one 
state (New Hampshire) had no requirement for seat belt use 
by adults (18). States with primary enforcement in 2014 
included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, 
Delaware, DC, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin. States with secondary enforcement 
in 2014 included Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, 
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and 
Wyoming. New Hampshire was grouped with secondary 
enforcement states for analysis purposes. Distribution of 
primary and secondary enforcement provisions differed by

census region (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) (19). In 
the South, 15 states and DC (94%) had primary enforcement, 
and only one state (Virginia) had secondary enforcement. In 
the Midwest, seven states (58%) had primary enforcement 
and five states had secondary enforcement. In the Northeast, 
five states (56%) had primary enforcement, three states had 
secondary enforcement, and one state (New Hampshire) had 
no enforcement. In the West, six states (46%) had primary 
enforcement, and seven states had secondary enforcement.
Passenger-Vehicle–Occupant Deaths 
FARS data for passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths among 
adults aged ≥18 years were included in this report. Passenger-
vehicle occupants are defined as persons driving or riding in 
passenger cars, light trucks, vans, or sport utility vehicles. 
Deaths were limited to those among passenger-vehicle 
occupants aged ≥18 years because certain commercial-
vehicle occupants might have been covered by different seat 
belt requirements and certain states have separate seat belt 
enforcement requirements for those aged <18 years (20). Of the 
32,744 motor vehicle crash deaths in 2014, a total of 19,528 
met criteria for inclusion in this report. Additional elements 
in FARS included county of the crash location, whether a 
fatal crash involved speeding (e.g., exceeding the posted speed 
limit or driving too fast for conditions) or an alcohol-impaired 
driver (driver with blood alcohol concentration ≥0.08 g/dL). 
FARS uses multiple imputation when blood alcohol test results 
are not reported. One death did not have a recorded county; 
the most likely county was determined using the latitude and 
longitude coordinates of the crash.
Self-Reported Seat Belt Use 
To assess seat belt use, BRFSS survey respondents were 
asked, “How often do you use seat belts when you drive or 
ride in a car?” Response options were “always,” “nearly always,” 
“sometimes,” “seldom,” or “never.” Seat belt use was defined as 
always wearing a seat belt. Survey respondents who said they 
did not drive or ride in a car (0.2%) or who were coded as “do 
not know,” “refused,” or “missing” (5.8%) were excluded. The 
BRFSS analyses compared seat belt use (i.e., always wears a 
seat belt) between primary and secondary state enforcement 
types across the six-level rural-urban designation (based on 
county of residence) and selected demographic, health-related, 
and behavioral characteristics. Each of the six rural-urban 
classifications were stratified by census region. Selected self-
reported characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, 
marital status, employment status, BMI, and alcohol-impaired 
driving) were categorized according to whether counties were 
metropolitan or nonmetropolitan. To assess alcohol-impaired 
driving, BRFSS survey respondents who reported that they had 
had at least one alcoholic drink in the past 30 days were asked, 
“During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven 
when you’ve had perhaps too much to drink?” Self-reported 
alcohol-impaired driving was categorized as driving after having 
too much to drink at least once in the past 30 days. Survey 
respondents were excluded from alcohol-impaired driving 
analyses if they were coded as “do not know,” “refused,” or 
“missing” (0.2%).
Results
Passenger-Vehicle–Occupant Deaths
Within each census region, age-adjusted passenger-
vehicle–occupant death rates were significantly higher in 
nonmetropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties 
(Table 1), both overall and in primary and secondary 
enforcement states. For example, in the Northeast, age-adjusted 
death rates per 100,000 population were 4.2 in metropolitan 
counties and 9.6 in nonmetropolitan counties. In northeastern 
states with primary enforcement, age-adjusted death rates per 
100,000 population were 3.5 in metropolitan counties and 
9.2 in nonmetropolitan counties. In northeastern states with 
secondary enforcement, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 
population were 5.4 in metropolitan counties and 10.0 in 
nonmetropolitan counties.
Also in each census region, age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–
occupant death rates generally increased with increasing rurality 
(Table 1). In the Northeast, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 
population increased from 3.5 in the most urban counties to 
10.8 in the second-most rural counties (joinpoint regression test 
for trend, p<0.001). Results for the most rural counties in the 
Northeast were suppressed because they had <20 respondents or 
RSE ≥30%. In the South, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 
population increased from 6.8 in the most urban counties to 
29.2 in the most rural counties (test for trend, p<0.001). In 
the Midwest, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 population 
increased from 5.3 in the most urban counties to 25.8 in the 
most rural counties (test for trend, p<0.01). In the West, age-
adjusted death rates per 100,000 population increased from 3.9 
in the most urban counties to 40.0 in the most rural counties 
(test for trend, p<0.01). Similarly, age-adjusted passenger-
vehicle–occupant death rates increased with increasing rurality 
among states with primary enforcement and among states with 
secondary enforcement (Table 1).
RRs were calculated to assess the association of enforcement 
type (primary or secondary) and age-adjusted passenger-
vehicle–occupant death rates. These relationships were not 
consistent across all census regions or county classifications

* In 2014, a total of 33 states and the District of Columbia (DC) had primary enforcement, 16 states had secondary enforcement, and one state (New Hampshire) had 
no requirement for seat belt use by adults. States with primary enforcement in 2014 included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, DC, 
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. States with secondary enforcement 
in 2014 included Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, 
Virginia, and Wyoming. New Hampshire was grouped with secondary enforcement states for analysis purposes.
† Census regions were determined using the U.S. Census Bureau definition (https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf). Rural and

(Table 1). Overall, age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant 
death rates in the Northeast, Midwest, and West were 
significantly higher in secondary enforcement states than in 
primary enforcement states (RR = 1.52, RR = 1.28, RR = 1.44, 
respectively). However, in the South, where only one of 17 states 
had secondary enforcement, age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–
occupant death rates were significantly higher in the primary 
enforcement states than in the one secondary enforcement state 
(RR = 0.64). Similar relationships within each census region 
were observed for many of the rural-urban levels, although not 
all associations were statistically significant (Table 1).
The proportions of passenger-vehicle occupants who were 
unrestrained at the time of the fatal crash also were examined 
by rurality and enforcement type (Figure 1). The proportion of 
passenger-vehicle occupants who were unrestrained at the time of 
the fatal crash increased as rurality increased, overall and in both 
primary and secondary enforcement states (joinpoint regression 
test for linear trend: overall, p<0.01; primary states, p<0.01; 
secondary states, p<0.05). In primary enforcement states, the 
proportion of unrestrained passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths 
was 41.3% in the most urban counties, compared with 59.5% 
in the most rural counties. In secondary enforcement states, 
these proportions were 56.7% in the most urban counties and 
64.7% in the most rural counties (Figure 1).
In the United States, the age-adjusted speeding-associated 
passenger-vehicle–occupant death rate per 100,000 population 
was 2.2 in metropolitan counties and 5.5 in nonmetropolitan 
counties (data not shown). Similarly, age-adjusted speeding-
associated passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates were 
2.3–3.1 times higher in nonmetropolitan counties compared 
with metropolitan counties across the four census regions. In 
most census regions, age-adjusted speeding-related passenger-
vehicle–occupant death rates were significantly higher in 
secondary enforcement states than in primary enforcement 
states. However, in the South, age-adjusted speeding-related 
passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates were significantly 
lower in the one secondary enforcement state than in primary 
enforcement states, both in metropolitan counties (RR = 0.38) 
and nonmetropolitan counties (RR = 0.49).
Age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates for 
crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving were higher in 
nonmetropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties in 
the United States overall (6.2 and 2.4 deaths per 100,000 
population, respectively; data not shown) and in each of the 
four census regions. Similar to the speeding-associated deaths, 
age-adjusted death rates that involved alcohol-impaired driving 
were higher in secondary enforcement states than in primary 
enforcement states in every census region except the South. 
In the South, age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death 
rates that involved alcohol-impaired driving were lower in 
the one secondary enforcement state (2.1 and 5.3 deaths per 
100,000 population in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan 
counties, respectively) than in primary enforcement states (3.5 
and 7.8 deaths per 100,000 population in metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan counties, respectively).
Self-Reported Seat Belt Use
In 2014, self-reported seat belt use (i.e., respondent always 
wears a seat belt) in the United States was 86.9% overall 
(Table 2). Seat belt use was highest in the most urban counties 
(88.8%) and lowest in the most rural counties (74.7%), and 
the trend of decreasing seat belt use with increasing rurality 
was significant (Figure 2). Similar patterns were observed in 
both the primary and secondary enforcement states. Seat belt 
use was highest in the West (90.1%), followed by the South 
(88.2%), the Northeast (84.0%), and the Midwest (83.7%) 
(Table 2). Within each region, seat belt use also decreased 
significantly with increasing rurality (Supplementary Table, 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/47557).
Overall, for all rural-urban designations and all census regions, 
seat belt use was significantly higher in primary enforcement 
states than in secondary enforcement states (Table 2). Similar 
rural-urban patterns in seat belt use by enforcement type were 
observed within each census region (Supplementary Table, 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/47557), with the exception 
of the South. Other than the South overall, the southern 
metropolitan area overall, and southern counties with an urban 
population of ≥20,000, no statistically significant differences 
were found in seat belt use between primary enforcement 
states and the one secondary enforcement state in the South.
Seat belt use also was examined by metropolitan status 
and selected demographic, health-related, and behavioral 
characteristics (Table 3). For almost all characteristics 
examined, seat belt use was significantly higher in metropolitan 
counties than in nonmetropolitan counties. For example, seat 
belt use was 84.9% among men and 91.1% among women in 
metropolitan counties, compared with 74.4% among men and 
86.4% among women in nonmetropolitan counties. Seat belt 
use among those who reported alcohol-impaired driving in the 
past 30 days was 73.7% in metropolitan counties, compared 
with 60.6% in nonmetropolitan counties.
For almost all demographic, health-related, and behavioral 
categories, seat belt use was significantly higher in primary 
enforcement states than in secondary enforcement 
states (Table 3). Seat belt use was 83.5% for residents of 
nonmetropolitan counties with primary enforcement, whereas 
seat belt use was significantly lower (72.5%) for residents 
of nonmetropolitan counties with secondary enforcement 
(RR = 1.15). In nonmetropolitan counties, some of the

strongest associations by enforcement type were among those 
who had less than a high school education (RR = 1.24), were

the past 30 days (RR = 1.43).
Discussion
Age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates 
increased with increasing rurality, with census region-specific 
age-adjusted death rates that were 3–10 times higher in the 
most rural counties than in the most urban counties. This trend 
also was found in the presence of both primary and secondary 
seat belt enforcement. This report provides additional 
information related to previously reported disparities in urban 
and rural crash deaths that have primarily used dichotomous 
measures to distinguish rural-urban areas (1,5,9). A single-state 
study that compared various measures of rurality, each with 
six levels on a rural-urban continuum, also found a consistent 
trend of higher death rates in increasingly rural counties (12).
A substantial predictor of a crash-related death among 
passenger vehicle occupants is lack of seat belt use (6). Lower 
use of seat belts in rural areas compared with urban areas is one 
factor that contributes to the increased risk for crash-related 
deaths in rural areas. This report indicates that self-reported 
seat belt use was highest in the most urban counties (88.8%) 
and lowest in the most rural counties (74.7%). This trend also 
was found in each of the four census regions of the United

† Rural and urban designations were determined using the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2013 rural-urban continuum codes (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-

§ RRs comparing seat belt use in primary enforcement states to seat belt use in secondary enforcement states are significantly different from 1 (p<0.05).
¶ Census regions were determined using the U.S. Census Bureau definition (https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf). 
States and among both primary and secondary enforcement 
states. In addition, for almost all demographic, health-related, 
and behavioral characteristics examined, seat belt use was 
higher in metropolitan counties than in nonmetropolitan 
counties. These findings confirm and provide an update of 
multiple previous reports on rural-urban differences in seat belt 
use (7,21,22); however, the most recent National Occupant 
Protection Use Survey (NOPUS) daytime observational survey 
of drivers and front-seat passengers reported similar rates of 
seat belt use in rural (89.5%) and urban (90.5%) areas in 2016 
(23). NOPUS methods exclude selected sites with very low 
traffic volume (24). Methodological factors, actual changes in 
the relationship between seat belt use and rural-urban status, 
or a combination of both might be responsible for the recent 
observational findings.
Seat belt use has been shown to prevent death from a motor-
vehicle crash, and groups that are most at risk for nonuse can 
be the focus of interventions to increase seat belt use. Although 
overall levels of seat belt use in the United States are relatively 
high (86.9% in 2014), the small percentage who do not always 
wear seat belts represent a large proportion of the passenger-
vehicle–occupant deaths. The 13% of adults who did not always 
wear seat belts represented 44.4% (in the most urban counties) 
to 61.3% (in the most rural counties) of adult passenger-
vehicle–occupant deaths in 2014. Although some crashes are 
not survivable because of factors such as high-impact speed (25), 
seat belt use is one of the best ways a person can prevent serious 
injury or death in a crash. NHTSA estimates that an additional 
2,814 deaths could have been prevented in 2014 if all passenger-
vehicle occupants had been restrained (26).
Overall, and for each level of rural-urban designation, 
primary seat belt enforcement was associated with higher 
levels of seat belt use than secondary enforcement, confirming 
previous reports on seat belt use and rurality (7,22). For 
example, in the most rural counties, seat belt use was 79.1% 
in primary enforcement states compared with 64.7% in 
secondary enforcement states. Primary seat belt enforcement 
laws and high-visibility enforcement of seat belt laws also

† Primary or secondary enforcement. In 2014, a total of 33 states and the District of Columbia (DC) had primary enforcement, 16 states had secondary enforcement, 
and one state (New Hampshire) had no requirement for seat belt use by adults. States with primary enforcement in 2014 included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, 
California, Connecticut, Delaware, DC, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
States with secondary enforcement in 2014 included Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming. New Hampshire was grouped with secondary enforcement states for analysis purposes.
have been associated with reduced numbers of crash deaths 
(10,11). A study that examined the effect of enforcement type 
on passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates during 2001–2010 
concluded that adjusted death rates were 17% lower in 
primary enforcement states than in secondary enforcement 
states (11). One study found no significant effect of seat belt 
enforcement type on passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates 
after controlling for secular trends and fixed state effects (27).
Of the four census regions examined in this report, the 
South had the highest age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant 
death rate overall (10.7 passenger-vehicle–occupant deaths 
per 100,000 population) and in both metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas. One study of police-reported crashes 
found that passenger-vehicle occupants who lived in the South 
were more likely to experience severe or fatal injuries than those 
who did not live in the South, even after controlling for factors 
such as restraint use, high vehicle speed, and rurality (28). In 
addition to high age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant 
death rates for the South overall, only one southern state 
(Virginia) had a secondary enforcement law, and Virginia has 
one of the lowest death rates from motor-vehicle crashes (8.4 
total crash-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2014) 
among all secondary enforcement states (range: 4.9 to 25.7 
deaths per 100,000 population) (29). The high age-adjusted 
passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates in the South and the 
relatively low overall death rate from motor-vehicle crashes in 
Virginia compared with other secondary enforcement states 
might explain the observed relationship between age-adjusted

passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates and enforcement type 
(primary or secondary) in the South. Age-adjusted passenger-
vehicle–occupant death rates were higher in secondary 
enforcement states than in primary enforcement states for each 
of the other three census regions.
Other factors contribute to the higher death rates in rural 
areas. For example, high speed (whether indicated by a high 
posted road speed limit or a high travel speed at the time of 
crash) is associated with increased risk for death in motor-
vehicle crashes and is more common in fatal crashes in rural 
areas (28,30). Rollover crashes are more common in rural 
areas (1). Roadway characteristics (e.g., lack of paved road 
shoulders) that are more common in rural areas might increase 
the likelihood and severity of crashes (31). A Nebraska study 
found increased odds of crash-related deaths in rural areas, 
even after controlling for injury severity, suggesting that 
rural-urban differences in medical care might affect risk for 
death (32). Prehospital and hospital care indicators, such as 
shorter transport times (from crash scene to hospital) and the 
presence of a trauma center (level I–IV), have been associated 
with lower rates of death following a motor-vehicle crash, and 
rural areas are less likely than urban areas to have such resources

* In 2014, a total of 33 states and the District of Columbia (DC) had primary enforcement, 16 states had secondary enforcement, and one state (New Hampshire) had 
no requirement for seat belt use by adults. States with primary enforcement in 2014 included Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, DC,

Virginia, and Wyoming. New Hampshire was grouped with secondary enforcement states for analysis purposes.
† RRs comparing seat belt use in primary enforcement states to seat belt use in secondary enforcement states are significantly different from 1 (p<0.05).
§ Estimates based on 20–49 respondents and RSE <30% for rarer outcome (not always wearing seat belt) might be unreliable and should be interpreted with caution.

(33). Rural areas also have higher proportions of older adults 
(≥65 years) (34), and older adults are at increased risk for severe 
injury and death after a crash because of various factors such 
as frailty (5,35,36).
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, although crash deaths were coded 
geographically by county of crash location, the population 
data used to calculate age-adjusted death rates were coded 
by county of residence. Bias in rates could occur in either 
direction to the extent that fatal crash and residence locations 
differ. A statewide survey found that approximately three 
fourths of trips were to locations of the same rural-urban 
designation (using a six-level rural-urban designation based on 
zip codes) as respondents’ place of residence (12). When travel 
crossed rural-urban designations, rural residents more likely 
traveled to urban areas than the opposite, suggesting that any 
bias would be to underestimate the rural-urban disparity in 
age-adjusted death rates (12). Second, Virginia was the only 
state in the southern region with a secondary enforcement

law and might not be a truly representative comparison group 
in the South. Among secondary enforcement states, Virginia 
had a relatively low age-adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant 
death rate (7.0 per 100,000), despite being in a census region 
with a high passenger-vehicle–occupant death rate. Third, 
other factors associated with crash-related deaths, seat belt 
use, or both (e.g., alcohol-impaired driving and speeding) 
were not controlled for in the analysis and could have affected 
the associations between state seat belt enforcement and age-
adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates or seat belt 
use. Fourth, BRFSS seat belt use data were self-reported by 
respondents and might be subject to social desirability bias. 
However, a comparison of self-reported and observational 
seat belt use in 2008 found minimal bias in self-reported 
estimates (37). Finally, the median response rate for the 2014 
BRFSS was 47%; nonresponses might have differed across 
rural-urban designations. 
Future Directions
Reducing crash-related deaths in rural areas requires 
a multifaceted approach. Implementation of effective 
interventions, including primary enforcement seat belt 
laws and high-visibility enforcement (i.e., increased police 
enforcement efforts coupled with highly publicized media 
campaigns), can increase seat belt use and reduce the likelihood 
of severe injuries and deaths (10). CDC has developed several 
resources and tools that states and communities can use to 
identify effective interventions that might help to address 
rural-urban disparities in seat belt use and passenger-vehicle–
occupant death rates. These include the Motor Vehicle 
Prioritizing Interventions and Cost Calculator for States 
(MV PICCS), which calculates the expected number and 
monetized value of injuries prevented and lives saved at the 
state level after implementation of up to 14 proven strategies 
(https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/calculator), and The 
Guide to Community Preventive Services (e.g., The Community 
Guide), a collection of systematic reviews of evidence-based 
findings of the Community Preventive Services Task Force 
that includes motor-vehicle injury prevention reviews (https://
www.thecommunityguide.org). In addition, NHTSA’s 
Countermeasures that Work is a reference to assist states in 
the selection of effective, evidence-based countermeasures 
for traffic safety (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/
files/812202-countermeasuresthatwork8th.pdf ). Finally, 
future studies using multivariate models could be conducted 
to adjust for effects confounding the association between 
seat belt enforcement type, rurality, and passenger-vehicle–
occupant deaths. This future research into the effects of rurality 
and census region on passenger vehicle occupant safety will 
continue to be used for efforts to reduce rural-urban disparities 
in crash-related risk behaviors, injuries, and deaths.
Conclusion
Seat belt use prevented an estimated 64,000 deaths in the 
United States during 2011–2015 (38). Although self-reported 
levels of seat belt use reached 86.9% in 2014, a marked increase 
in recent decades, the small percentage who still do not always 
use seat belts represent almost half of all occupant deaths in 
the United States, and rural residents are disproportionately 
affected. Despite differences in how rural and urban areas 
are defined in various studies, rurality is consistently shown 
to be associated with increased crash-related death rates and 
lower seat belt use. Improving seat belt use remains a critical 
strategy to reduce crash-related deaths in the United States, 
especially in rural areas where seat belt use is lower and age-
adjusted passenger-vehicle–occupant death rates are higher 
than in urban areas.
