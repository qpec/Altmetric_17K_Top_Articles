(SR)/Bupropion SR on Body Weight in Individuals
with Obesity

Objective: This study assessed the effects of 32 mg naltrexone sustained release (SR)/360 mg bupropion
SR (NB) on body weight in adults with obesity, with comprehensive lifestyle intervention (CLI), for 78 weeks.
Methods: In this phase 3b, randomized, open-label, controlled study, subjects received NB 1 CLI or
usual care (standard diet/exercise advice) for 26 weeks. NB subjects not achieving 5% weight loss at
week 16 were discontinued, as indicated by product labeling. After week 26, usual care subjects began
NB 1 CLI. Assessments continued through week 78. The primary end point was percent change in weight
from baseline to week 26 in the per protocol population. Other end points included percentage of sub-
jects achieving �5%, �10%, and �15% weight loss, percent change in weight at week 78, and adverse
events (AEs) necessitating study medication discontinuation.
Results: NB 1 CLI subjects lost significantly more weight than usual care subjects at week 26 (8.52% differ-
ence; P < 0.0001). Weight loss persisted through 78 weeks. In total, 20.7% of subjects discontinued medi-
cation for AEs, including 7.0% for nausea.
Conclusions: Treatment with NB, used as indicated by prescribing information and with CLI, significantly
improved weight loss over usual care alone. NB-facilitated weight loss was sustained for 78 weeks and
was deemed safe and well tolerated.

Introduction
Obesity is a public health epidemic affecting more than one third of
adults in the United States (U.S.); over two thirds of U.S. and half of
European adults are overweight or at risk of developing obesity (1-4).
Obesity-related complications such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease,
stroke, and certain cancers are associated with decreased life expect-
ancy and costs totaling up to $147 billion annually in the U.S. (5-7).
Despite these health and economic consequences, many individuals
are unable to combat obesity through diet and exercise alone, and few
effective drugs are available to assist weight loss (5,8).
Appetite and eating behavior are controlled by several neural path-
ways
in
the
brain
(9).
One
key
pathway
involves
pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus; activation
of these neurons is thought to reduce hunger and therefore food
intake. Bupropion has been demonstrated to increase POMC activa-
tion (10-13), while naltrexone lessens auto-inhibition of the POMC
pathway by endogenous opioids, leading to a synergistic activation
(14-16). Furthermore, both bupropion and naltrexone are thought to
influence the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway, which nor-
mally contributes to the reinforcement of behaviors, including feed-
ing (9,17); the combination of naltrexone and bupropion (NB) may
therefore also reduce reward-driven food intake.
Combination NB sustained release (SR), referred to as extended release
(ER) in the U.S. and South Korea and prolonged release (PR) in
Europe, has been evaluated for weight loss in four pivotal, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, randomized phase 3 clinical trials (18-21). In
each of these studies, NB was well tolerated and associated with sig-
nificant weight loss (approximately 4%-5% greater mean weight loss
compared with subjects receiving placebo and participating in the

 same lifestyle modification programs) and improvements in various
secondary measures of cardiovascular risk. NB therapy was approved
for the chronic treatment of obesity by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion in the U.S. in 2014 (ContraveV
R ), by the European Medicines
Agency in the European Union in 2015 (Mysimba
TM), and by the Min-
istry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea in 2016 (Contrave) as
an adjunct to lifestyle modification. Product labeling states that
patients are to be evaluated after 16 weeks of treatment to determine
whether they have lost at least 5% of initial body weight, and, if not,
medication use should be discontinued. The present effectiveness study
was designed to determine weight loss achieved when NB is used in a
manner consistent with labeling in a real-world setting, including the
use of a commercially available comprehensive lifestyle intervention
(CLI) program. As the weight loss efficacy of NB compared with pla-
cebo in addition to lifestyle intervention programs of differing inten-
sities was already demonstrated (19,21), in the current open-label
study the NB 1 CLI regimen was compared with general advice that
patients might receive from their physician (usual care). While this
design does not allow for individual assessment of the contribution of
NB and CLI to weight loss, it does reflect the overall outcome that
would be expected to occur when NB is prescribed according to prod-
uct labeling and allows for comparison of those outcomes with what
might be expected if a physician provides more general weight loss
advice and support. Finally, this study examined the effects of NB for
up to 78 weeks, longer than the previous phase 3 trials.
Methods
Study design
This was a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled
trial designed to assess the effects of 32 mg naltrexone SR/360 mg
bupropion SR (NB) in conjunction with a CLI program, compared
with usual care (diet and exercise education and recommendations
from the study site) on body weight for 26 weeks in subjects with
obesity or overweight and dyslipidemia and/or controlled hyperten-
sion. Following the first 26 weeks, subjects in the usual care group
received NB 1 CLI in a manner consistent with that of the subjects
originally randomized to that treatment group. The study had a total
treatment duration of up to 78 weeks. Ethical approval was provided
by Schulman Associates IRB, Cincinnati, OH.
Subjects and eligibility criteria
Adult male and female subjects, aged 18 to 60 years, had either obe-
sity (body mass index [BMI] 30-45 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI 27-
45 kg/m2) with dyslipidemia and/or controlled hypertension. Key
exclusion criteria included: type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus; myocardial
infarction within 6 months before screening; angina pectoris grade
III/IV (per the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading scheme);
clinical history of large vessel cortical strokes, including ischemic or
hemorrhagic strokes (i.e., transient ischemic attack was not exclu-
sionary); history (within 20 years before screening) of seizures,
cranial trauma, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, or other conditions that
predispose subjects to seizures; chronic use or positive screen for
opioids; psychiatric conditions including mania, psychosis, acute
depressive illness, or suicide risk; regular use of tobacco products.
Lifestyle intervention programs
CLI was a telephone- and Internet-based program that included a pro-
gressive nutrition and exercise program with individualized goal setting
and tracking tools. Subjects were to receive up to 11 structured tele-
phone calls from a coach/dietician during the first 26 weeks (controlled
treatment period), with up to 12 additional calls offered over the remain-
der of the 78 weeks (uncontrolled treatment period). Usual care was a
site-based lifestyle intervention program intended to mimic the weight
loss support that might typically be provided to patients in a primary
care setting. Usual care subjects were instructed at baseline and at week
10 to follow an exercise prescription and a hypocaloric diet, with a tar-
get daily caloric intake deficit of 500 kcal, and were given support tools
such as a nutrition tracker, pedometer, and healthy weight literature.
Controlled treatment period
(week 1-week 26)
Following a screening period, subjects were randomized in a 1.75:1
ratio to receive either open-label active study medication (NB) along
with CLI (NB 1 CLI) or usual care for 26 weeks (Figure 1). In
accordance with prescribing information, subjects randomized to
NB 1 CLI initiated treatment with NB at a daily dose of 8 mg
naltrexone/90 mg bupropion and escalated their dose over the subse-
quent 3 weeks. In addition, an evaluation of weight loss was per-
formed in the NB 1 CLI group at week 16, with subjects discontin-
ued from NB if they had not lost at least 5% of their baseline body
weight. Additionally, subjects were to discontinue NB if they experi-
enced increases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of �10 mm
Hg at both week 10 and week 16.
Uncontrolled treatment period
(week 26-week 78)
After the controlled treatment period of 26 weeks, subjects in the
NB 1 CLI group continued their open-label NB use and participation
in the CLI program. Subjects in the usual care group were switched
to open-label NB use and began participation in the CLI program.
These subjects also underwent a weight loss and blood pressure
evaluation 16 weeks after beginning NB use (at week 42), and treat-
ment was discontinued, if necessary, based on the same criteria used
for subjects originally assigned to NB 1 CLI.
Sample size determination
Based on the predicted difference in discontinuation rates and effect of
a week 16 weight assessment, a randomization ratio of 1.75:1 was
adopted. A total of 242 subjects were sufficient to provide �90% power
to detect a significant difference (a 5 0.05) between the treatment
groups at week 26 for the per protocol (PP) population using a two-
sample t-test assuming a true mean difference of 0.6 common standard
deviation (SD). The assumptions are based on data from the NB phase
3 trials and publications pertaining to usual care for obesity (18-23).
Study end points
The primary end point was the percent change in body weight from
baseline (day 1) to week 26, while the secondary end points were
percentage of subjects achieving a loss of at least 5%, 10%, or 15%
of baseline body weight at week 26. Additional study end points
included changes in body weight, vital signs, and obesity-related
risk factors from baseline to post-baseline visits (both before and
after week 26). Patient-reported outcomes concerning weight-related
quality of life, binge eating, and sexual function were assessed but
are not reported in this article.

 Statistical analysis
The primary analysis of the primary end point was based on the
adjusted least-squares (LS) means estimated using analysis of covar-
iance (ANCOVA), using the week 26 PP population (defined as
modified intent-to-treat [mITT] subjects in compliance with the pro-
tocol in the controlled treatment period), with no imputation of
missing data. As sensitivity analyses, the primary end point was also
analyzed for the mITT population (defined as randomized subjects
with at least one post-baseline body weight measurement while still
on treatment) using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) and
last observation carried forward (LOCF). The week 78 analysis of
percent change in body weight was conducted similarly with the pri-
mary analysis being ANCOVA in the week 78 PP population (sub-
jects in compliance with the protocol throughout the study) and
numerous sensitivity analyses.

 of baseline body weight at week 26 was assessed using a logistic
regression model with a factor for treatment group and baseline BMI
category with baseline body weight as a covariate. For treatment com-
parisons, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the odds
ratios, and P values are reported. Analyses were repeated at week 78
in the week 78 PP population. Other continuous variables were ana-
lyzed similarly to the primary end point. Data were only descriptively
summarized beyond the controlled treatment period.
All statistical tests were performed two-sided at the 0.05 level of
significance. Adverse events (AEs) were summarized in the ITT
population and vital signs were collected for the week 78 PP
population. All statistical analyses were performed using SASV
R soft-
ware (Version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline characteristics and subject disposition
A total of 242 subjects were randomized and treated (ITT): 153 sub-
jects to the NB 1 CLI group and 89 subjects to the usual care group
(Figure 1). Subject demographics are summarized in Table 1. Of the
242 randomized subjects, 153 subjects (71 in the NB 1 CLI group and
82 in the usual care group) completed the 26-week controlled treat-
ment period. The most common reason for discontinuation from the
NB 1 CLI treatment regimen within the first 26 weeks was AEs
(n 5 35 of 153, 22.9%), followed by discontinuation due to the week
16 assessment (n 5 32 of 153; 20.9% [n 5 29 did not satisfy the
weight criteria alone, n 5 1 had blood pressure elevations that met the
criteria for discontinuation alone, and n 5 2 were discontinued due to
both weight and blood pressure criteria]). The most common reason
for discontinuation of usual care treatment was lost to follow-up
(n 5 5, 5.6%).
During the uncontrolled treatment period, the most common reason
for discontinuation of the usual care/NB 1 CLI group was the week
42 assessment (n 5 26 of 89, 29.2%). Of subjects from the original
NB 1 CLI group, n 5 16 discontinued after week 26. No subjects
discontinued NB due to an AE with an onset after the first 26 weeks
of NB use.
Treatment with NB 1 CLI led to greater weight
loss than usual care
Subjects in the PP population treated with NB 1 CLI demonstrated a
significant decrease in body weight compared with those in the
usual care group after 26 weeks (9.46% reduction in the NB 1 CLI
group; 0.94% reduction in the usual care group; 8.52% difference,
P < 0.0001) (Figure 2A). When all NB 1 CLI subjects were
included in the analysis using MMRM or LOCF methodology,
including those who did not achieve weight loss of 5% at week 16,
the reduction in the NB 1 CLI group relative to usual care at 26
weeks was 5.17% (MMRM) and 4.15% (mITT-LOCF) (P < 0.0001
in both sensitivity analyses). Changes in weight over the first 16
weeks were analyzed in subjects who achieved 5% weight loss at
week 16 (responders) compared with those who did not achieve this
threshold (nonresponders, including those who discontinued study
medication before week 16) (Figure 2B). This figure demonstrates
that the weight loss curves of these two populations separated at the
first time point assessed (2 weeks).
Consistent with the greater percentage body weight reduction
observed in the NB 1 CLI group, significantly more NB 1 CLI sub-
jects achieved each weight loss threshold than usual care subjects at
week 26 (84.5% NB 1 CLI vs. 12.2% usual care had �5% weight
loss [P < 0.0001]; 42.3% NB 1 CLI vs. 3.7% usual care had �10%
weight loss [P < 0.0001]; 12.7% NB 1 CLI vs. 0% usual care had
�15% weight loss [P value cannot be determined]) (Table 2), indi-
cating that while there are some subjects who are able to achieve
these categorical weight loss values even with very basic advice, the
combination of pharmacotherapy and more consistent lifestyle
instruction dramatically increases a patient’s likelihood of success.

 After week 26, when the subjects in the usual care group began
treatment with NB 1 CLI, a similar pattern of weight loss was
observed as previously observed in those initially randomized to
NB 1 CLI (Figure 3A), with approximately 90% of the maximum
weight loss in each cohort observed over the first 6 months of NB
treatment. Changes in weight at week 78 were similar between those
who received 52 and 78 weeks of NB 1 CLI treatment. The change
in body weight from baseline to week 78 for each subject who
remained in the study is also presented graphically in Figure 3B,
highlighting the range of weight changes observed in the population,
even when the week 16 criteria was used to select for responders.
Obesity-related risk factors
In addition to the greater reductions in weight observed with
NB 1 CLI compared with usual care at week 26, subjects in the
NB 1 CLI group had significantly greater reductions in triglycerides,
waist circumference, glucose, insulin, and a measure of insulin
resistance, as well as a significantly greater increase in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (Table 3). At week 78, these changes were
generally maintained in subjects who received long-term treatment
with NB 1 CLI, as shown by the pooled data from all subjects.
Safety results
Safety and tolerability of NB was thoroughly studied in the phase 3
trials, therefore only AEs leading to discontinuation of study medi-
cation and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected. AEs leading to NB
discontinuation were similar between subjects who initially were
randomized to NB 1 CLI and to subjects originally randomized to
usual care who began treatment with NB after week 26; data are
therefore presented for the two groups combined in Table 4. Gastro-
intestinal and neuropsychiatric side effects, known to be associated
with NB pharmacology, contributed to 82% of AEs in both treat-
ment groups and tended to occur within the first 4 weeks of treat-
ment. The most frequent AEs that led to discontinuation of NB for
the two groups combined included nausea (7.0%), anxiety (2.1%),
headache (1.7%), dizziness (1.2%), and insomnia (1.2%). All AEs
leading to discontinuation from the NB 1 CLI group had onset dates
before week 26. Two subjects experienced SAEs that were deemed
not related to NB by the investigator (breast cancer, one case diag-
nosed 3 months into NB treatment and the other 1 year after NB
treatment had been discontinued).
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were collected
over time to further evaluate the safety of NB treatment. Mean
(standard error, SE) systolic blood pressure decreased by 2.2 (2.0)
and 2.7 (1.4) mm Hg from baselines of 120.9 and 126.0 mm Hg in
the usual care (N 5 28) and NB 1 CLI (N 5 55) groups, respectively,
at week 78. Mean (SE) diastolic blood pressure decreased by 0.3
(1.6) and 1.7 (1.0) mm Hg from baselines of 78.5 and 80.9 mm Hg,

Discussion
In this randomized, open-label study, treatment with 32 mg naltrex-
one SR/360 mg bupropion SR (NB 1 CLI) as indicated by its pre-
scribing information was shown to result in approximately 10%
weight loss from baseline over a 26-week period, which was approx-
imately 8.5% more than was observed with usual care, a diet and
exercise advice program designed to reflect what a patient might
receive in a primary care setting. In this study, subjects who did not
achieve at least 5% body weight reduction by 16 weeks of use (i.e.,
those who did not respond to treatment) or had a sustained elevation
in blood pressure were discontinued from study medication. In those
who remained on medication through 78 weeks, longer than the
observation periods of previous NB studies (56 weeks) (18-21), the
initial weight loss observed at 26 weeks was sustained.
This study, conducted to approximate the real-world experience, is
consistent with and builds on the results of the previous NB phase 3
trials, all of which demonstrated that NB used as an adjunct to life-
style modification is associated with weight loss of approximately
4% to 5% greater than seen with placebo subjects receiving the
same lifestyle intervention in subjects with overweight or obesity
(18-21). The previous studies did not prospectively utilize an effi-
cacy assessment at week 16 of NB treatment and were limited to a
56-week duration. This study assessed the effects of NB in the pop-
ulation of subjects who responded to the medication by losing at
least 5% of their initial body weight by 16 weeks, and demonstrated
that NB 1 CLI associated weight loss were maintained over 78
weeks. The safety profile was also consistent with previous studies:
most subjects tolerated NB well, and those who developed AEs did
so early in the treatment protocol. The most common AE leading to
NB discontinuation was nausea (7.0% of all subjects), which is con-
sistent with the rate in the phase 3 trials (6.3%). While the mecha-
nism by which NB causes nausea is unknown, it was demonstrated
in the phase 3 trials that nausea tends to occur early in treatment, is
primarily mild to moderate in severity, and is not a major contribu-
tor to weight loss (24). Only two AEs led to discontinuation in the
NB 1 CLI group after week 26 (both with AE onset before week
26), and no AEs necessitating discontinuation had an onset date dur-
ing the extended time period (weeks 52-78). These results strengthen
the body of evidence suggesting combination therapy of NB along
with lifestyle to promote weight loss is a promising approach to
lowering the prevalence of obesity.

 The evaluation for body weight reduction of 5% at week 16 (after
12 weeks at full dose NB) is in line with product labeling. The rec-
ommendation
to
discontinue
due
to
sustained
blood
pressure
increases of 10 mm Hg at week 16 in the present study was more
specific than product labeling, which recommends monitoring at reg-
ular intervals and discontinuing NB if concerns about increased
blood pressure are present. In this real-world setting, 67% (72 of
107) of NB 1 CLI subjects who received study medication for 16
weeks responded to the medication per the evaluation criteria used
in the present study. Similarly, 57% (37 of 65) of usual care/
NB 1 CLI subjects who received study medication for 16 weeks met
the early evaluation threshold. The overwhelming majority of dis-
continuations at week 16 were due to insufficient weight loss rela-
tive to baseline (more than 90% of the discontinuations in each
treatment group) rather than adverse blood pressure effects.
An advantage of various sensitivity analyses (MMRM and LOCF) is
to demonstrate the robustness of the conclusion from the primary
analysis in the PP population. In the present manuscript, the planned
sensitivity analyses confirmed the positive findings in efficacy,
while also allowing contribution of the earlier data from subjects
who were discontinued at the week 16 weight assessment.
A major caveat of this study is inherent to its design. In order to
test NB effects in a manner consistent with the label, continued
study participation in the NB treatment group was limited to those
who responded to the drug, whereas no such limitation applied to
the control group. Other limitations of the present study include its
open-label nature, the uncontrolled nature of the extension time
period, and the high number of dropouts. The NB phase 3 trials
were specifically designed to test the effects of NB, and thus utilized
a common lifestyle intervention program in both NB and placebo
groups. This study design compared lifestyle intervention that can
be considered standard in clinical care (i.e., encouragement to lose
weight, educational materials, and tools designed to enable weight
loss, but without regular, consistent reinforcement of the behavior
change), against a more supportive lifestyle intervention combined
with
NB
treatment
that
followed
the
prescribing
information
whereby treatment could only be continued if at least 5% weight
loss was observed after 12 weeks of treatment with the full dose (16
weeks after start of treatment). The lack of a CLI group without
study medication could be viewed as a limitation, as one cannot
estimate the contribution from each component of the weight loss
assistance provided (NB vs. CLI), but based on the phase 3 trials,
the effect of NB above that of a placebo plus lifestyle intervention
ranged from 3.68% (20) in patients with type 2 diabetes to 6.24% in
a more general obesity population (19).
Conclusion
Treatment with 32 mg naltrexone SR/360 mg bupropion SR (NB) as
indicated by the prescribing information and along with a CLI sig-
nificantly improved weight loss relative to usual care alone. The
efficacy was maintained for at least 78 weeks, a longer duration
than has been previously studied. The results of this study reflect
what may be expected to occur in real-world clinical practice.O
