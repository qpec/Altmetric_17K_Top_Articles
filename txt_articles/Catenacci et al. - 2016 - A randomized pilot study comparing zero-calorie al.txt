Abstract
Objective—To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alternate-day fasting (ADF) and to compare 
changes in weight, body composition, lipids, and insulin sensitivity index (Si) to those produced 
by a standard weight loss diet, moderate daily caloric restriction (CR).
Methods—Adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, age 18-55) were randomized to either zero-
calorie ADF (n=14) or CR (-400 kcal/day, n=12) for 8 weeks. Outcomes were measured at the end 
of the 8-week intervention and after 24 weeks of unsupervised follow-up.

 Results—No adverse effects were attributed to ADF and 93% completed the 8-week ADF 
protocol. At 8 weeks, ADF achieved a 376 kcal/day greater energy deficit, however there were no 
significant between-group differences in change in weight (mean±SE; ADF -8.2±0.9 kg, CR 
-7.1±1.0 kg), body composition, lipids, or Si. After 24 weeks of unsupervised follow-up, there 
were no significant differences in weight regain, however changes from baseline in % fat mass and 
lean mass were more favorable in ADF.
Conclusions—ADF is a safe and tolerable approach to weight loss. ADF produced similar 
changes in weight, body composition, lipids and Si at 8 weeks and did not appear to increase risk 
for weight regain 24 weeks after completing the intervention.

Introduction
Current guidelines for treatment of overweight and obesity recommend moderate caloric 
restriction (i.e. 20-30% energy deficit from daily weight maintenance requirements) along 
with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention [1]. This approach typically produces modest 
weight loss (5-10%) over a 6-month period [1, 2]. However, the recidivism rate is extremely 
high [3], and alternative therapeutic options for achieving and maintaining weight loss are 
needed.
Intermittent fasting (IMF) is an alternative method of reducing energy intake (EI) that is 
gaining attention as a strategy for weight loss and health benefits [4-9]. Alternate-day fasting 
(ADF) is a subclass of IMF, which consists of a “fast day” (0-25% of caloric needs) 
alternating with a “fed day” (ad libitum food consumption). Reviews suggest ADF may 
reduce diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk [10, 11] and may favorably impact 
hormones involved in regulation of hunger and satiety [9]. However, an important question 
that remains unresolved is whether ADF is an effective weight loss strategy.
Short-term studies suggest ADF produces 3-8% reductions in weight over 2-12 weeks in 
adults with overweight and obesity [12-18]. However, these studies either lacked a control 
group [12-17] or compared ADF to a no-intervention control [18]. While these studies lay 
foundation for ADF as a viable weight loss strategy, greater scientific rigor is needed from 
interventional trials than is found in the current literature [8]. In particular, randomized trials 
are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of ADF compared to moderate daily CR, the current 
standard for weight loss.
The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an 8-week 
zero-calorie ADF intervention. Secondary aims were to assess efficacy of ADF as compared 
to a standard dietary weight loss intervention (moderate daily caloric restriction, CR) in 
generating changes in weight, body composition, lipids, and Si as well as to compare risk for 
weight regain between groups after 24 weeks of unsupervised follow-up. We hypothesized 
ADF would be safe and tolerable, would produce greater weight loss and more favorable

 effects on body composition, lipids, and Si as compared to CR, and would not increase risk 
for weight regain. To explore potential mechanisms contributing to any observed differences, 
we also measured change in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and selected hormones implicated 
in the regulation of energy balance (leptin, ghrelin). Fasting has been suggested to improve 
cognitive function, possibly mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [19]; 
BDNF has also been implicated in the regulation of energy balance [20-22]. Thus, changes 
in BDNF were also assessed.
Methods
The study was conducted at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-
AMC) and approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB). 
Participants were studied between December 2006 and May 2010.
Participants
Volunteers were recruited from CU-AMC and the surrounding community. Respondents 
who met initial eligibility criteria (18-55 years, BMI ≥30 kg/m2, non-smoker, ≤4.5 kg weight 
change over past 6 months) were invited to a screening visit. After providing written 
informed consent, volunteers underwent a medical history and physical exam including 
blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), anthropometric measures (height, weight), 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function tests, compete blood 
count (CBC), uric acid, thyroid stimulating hormone, and lipid panel. Volunteers were 
excluded if they had diabetes, CVD, uncontrolled hypertension, severe dyslipidemia (or 
were on lipid lowering therapy), cancer, thyroid disease, seizures, migraines, significant 
renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders, binge eating disorder, current depression, history 
of bariatric surgery, or were taking medications known to affect appetite or energy 
metabolism. Women who were currently pregnant, planning pregnancy, or lactating were 
also excluded.
Volunteers who passed screening procedures completed a test fast day in the CU-AMC 
Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). Participants were admitted in the 
evening and remained fasted with ad libitum access to water, bouillon/stock cube soup, and 
non-caloric beverages for ∼36 hours. Safety measures (BMP, CBC, ECG) were performed 
on admission and following the fast. All participants tolerated the fast and were then 
randomized to either ADF or CR, stratified by sex.
Experimental Design
The study design was an 8-week intervention, followed by 24-weeks of unsupervised 
follow-up to assess risk for weight regain after completion of the intervention. Participants in 
both groups were admitted to the CTRC during the first week of the intervention to monitor 
safety; the subsequent 7 weeks were performed as an outpatient intervention. Participants 
were asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity (PA) during the 8-week 
intervention. Upon completion of the 8-week intervention, participants received standardized 
weight maintenance advice (maintain a low-fat diet, increase PA) but were free to choose 
whether to continue their respective dietary intervention strategies (CR or ADF). Participants

 had no contact with study staff during the follow-up period and dietary adherence was not 
assessed.
Study diets were not designed to produce comparable energy deficits but rather to compare 
ADF to a standard-of-care weight loss diet (moderate daily CR). It would not have been 
possible to design the diets to produce an equivalent energy deficit as it was not known what 
degree of compensation would occur in ADF on fed days (when allowed ad libitum intake). 
All food during the 8-week intervention was provided by the CTRC metabolic kitchen; 
participants collected pre-prepared research meals twice weekly. Participants were instructed 
to return any uneaten food for weigh-back and to report any foods eaten in addition to the 
research meals. Free-living weight maintenance energy requirements were estimated using 
baseline fat free mass (FFM) using the formula [(372 + 23.9 × FFM) × 1.5] [23]. Total 
macronutrient content in the provided diets was the same for both groups (55% 
carbohydrate, 15% protein and 30% fat). CR participants were provided a diet designed to 
produce a 400 kcal/day deficit from estimated energy requirements (considered a standard-
of-care weight loss diet at the time the study was designed). ADF participants were provided 
meals, but instructed to fast on alternate days. On fed days, ADF participants were provided 
a diet estimated to meet estimated energy requirements, which was supplemented with ad 
libitum access to 5-7 optional food modules (200 kcal each). ADF participants were 
permitted to eat as much as they wished on fed days, but were not encouraged to eat all food 
provided. The caloric distribution provided on fed days was the same as in CR (20% 
breakfast, 30% lunch, 40% dinner and 10% snack). On fast days, ADF participants were 
instructed to begin their fast after the evening meal the preceding day, and to consume only 
water, calorie-free beverages and bouillon/stock cube soup. Daily energy and macronutrient 
intakes were calculated based on food return using PROnutra software (Viocare 
Technologies Inc., Princeton NJ). Estimated energy deficits were calculated by subtracting 
estimated daily EI from estimated daily energy requirements.
Outcome Measures
Body weight was measured using a calibrated digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was 
measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body composition, 
including total and regional fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM), were measured using dual 
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Discovery–W version 12.6, Hologic Inc., Bedford, 
MA). RMR was measured between 0600 and 0630 hours, following an overnight stay at the 
CTRC with an overnight fast and 24 hour abstention from exercise, using standard indirect 
calorimetry with the ventilated hood technique (TrueOne® 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT) 
[24]. An insulin-augmented frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) 
was administered as previously described [25], and insulin sensitivity (Si) was determined 
using the MINMOD program (R Bergman, University of Southern California). Fasting blood 
samples were obtained for assessment of lipids, glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin and BDNF. 
Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL were measured with enzymatic reaction 
(Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and LDL was calculated by the Friedewald equation 
[26]. Serum glucose concentrations were measured by the glucose oxidase method 
(Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Serum insulin levels were measured by standard, 
double-antibody, radioimmunoassay techniques. Serum leptin and ghrelin were assayed

 using radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Linco Research, St Charles, MO). Serum BDNF levels 
were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a previously 
described protocol modified for the R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) BDNF ELISA [27].
Safety Assessments
BMP, CBC, HR, BP, ECG, Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns Revised (QEWP-R, 
assesses binge eating behaviors) [28, 29], and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale (CES-D) [30] were measured before and after the 36-hour test fast, at baseline prior to 
starting intervention, and at week 8. An ECG was also obtained 1 week after starting the 
intervention.
Statistical Analyses
Based on pilot weight loss data (W.T. Donahoo, unpublished data) from an 8-week CR 
protocol (-6.0±2.8 kg, n=11) and an 8-week ADF protocol (-11.25±3.3 kg, n=2) this study 
was planned to enroll 15 participants per arm to ensure 80% power at 5% significance level 
to detect a 3.1 kg (SD 2.89) between-group difference in weight loss at 8 weeks. SAS 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses. Randomized participants 
with at least one post-baseline efficacy observation were included in the analyses with the 
exception of one ADF participant who was intentionally non-compliant with the protocol (EI 
on fast days >500 kcals/day). Analyses of outcomes were repeated with and without this 
participant and there was no difference in statistical conclusions. The primary analysis used 
a linear mixed-effects model with unstructured covariance consisting of the baseline value 
and the post-intervention evaluations as outcome measures, as well as evaluation time 
(baseline, week 8, week 32), group (ADF or CR), and their interaction term as fixed effects. 
Estimate of the interaction was used to assess efficacy of ADF as compared to CR and to test 
for statistical significance. Data imputation was not utilized. To evaluate the feasibility and 
fidelity of the intervention, energy and macronutrient intake data were summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Independent-samples t-tests compared weekly and average (weeks 1-8) 
energy and macronutrient intake between groups. Among ADF participants, similar analyses 
were performed to compare average energy and macronutrient intake between fast and fed 
days. Sensitivity analyses were used in various ways to examine the strength of the 
conclusions. Considering the two groups were not balanced with respect to baseline body 
weight, results for changes in body weight and composition are reported in both absolute 
(kg) and relative (%) terms and analyses of energy intake data were repeated with the 
outcome variables normalized to weight. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean
±SE.
Results
Study Enrollment and Attrition (Figure 1)
Twenty–nine participants were randomized, however three withdrew post-randomization but

 Participant Characteristics (Table 1)
Participant BMI ranged from 30-52 kg/m2. CR and ADF were similar in age, sex, and 
ethnic/racial distributions. At baseline, mean±SD body weight (CR 114.0±20.0 kg, ADF 
94.7±10.6 kg, p<0.01), FM, trunk FM, fasting insulin, and RMR were significantly greater 
in CR than ADF.
Safety Assessments
There were no significant changes in safety measures over the 8-week intervention. One 
participant in the ADF group developed gallbladder dyskinesia and underwent 
cholecystectomy 1 month after completing the 8-week intervention. This event was 
determined to be unrelated to the intervention.
Energy and Macronutrient Intake (Tables 2 and 3)
Average daily energy and macronutrient intakes were significantly higher in CR compared to 
ADF over the 8-week intervention, even after adjusting for differences in baseline weight. EI 
on fed and fast days in ADF were 2565±148 kcal/day and 44±26 kcal/day, respectively. 
Estimated energy deficit from baseline weight maintenance energy requirements were 
-802±72 kcal/day in CR and -1178±51 kcal/day in ADF (p <0.001), which correspond to 
energy deficits of -28% and -47%, respectively.
Body Weight and Body Composition (Table 4)
At the end of the 8-week intervention, absolute weight change (CR -7.1±1.0 kg, 
ADF-8.2±0.9 kg) did not differ between groups. However, there was a marginally significant 
between-group difference in relative weight change (CR -6.2±0.9%, ADF -8.8±0.9%, 
p=0.056). There were no significant differences in change in absolute (kg) or relative (%) 
FM, trunk FM, and LM over the 8-week intervention. Between the end of the 8-week 
intervention and the end of the 24-week follow-up (week 8 to 32) there were no differences 
in weight regain, however, the composition of weight regain tended to differ between 
groups. CR gained 1.2±0.8 kg of FM and 1.1±0.5 kg of LM, conversely, ADF lost -0.4±0.8 
kg of FM (p=0.173 vs. CR) and gained 2.0±0.5 kg of LM (p=0.197 vs. CR). Between 
baseline and the end of the 24-week follow-up (baseline to week 32) there were no 
differences in absolute or relative weight change (Table 4) and differences in change in 
absolute FM (CR -2.5±1.1 kg, ADF -4.2±1.0 kg), trunk FM (CR -1.3±0.7 kg, ADF -2.7±0.6 
kg), or LM (CR -1.6±0.6 kg, ADF -1.2±0.6 kg) did not reach statistical significance. 
However, %FM (CR -0.7±0.5%, ADF -2.4±0.5%, p=0.035) and %trunk FM (CR -0.3±0.4%, 
ADF -1.8±0.3%, p=0.009) decreased more in ADF, and %LM (CR 0.5±0.5%, ADF 
2.2±0.5%, p=0.026) increased more in ADF.
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) (Table 5)
At week 8, RMR decreased significantly from baseline in both CR and ADF with no 
significant difference between groups. After 24 weeks of follow-up, RMR decreased 
significantly from baseline in CR but not in ADF; however, differences between groups were 
not significant. When adjusted for FM and FFM, RMR decreased significantly from baseline 
to week 8 in CR (-111.6±36.9 kcal/day, p=0.006) but not in ADF (-16.2±36.6 kcal/day,

 p=0.662) with a trend (p=0.076) for a between-group difference. Adjusted RMR also 
decreased significantly from baseline to week 32 in CR (-76.1±35.9 kcal/day, p=0.045) but 
not in ADF (-29.2±35.2 kcal/day, p=0.416); the between-group difference was not 
significant.
Lipids and Insulin Sensitivity (Table 6)
At week 8, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL decreased significantly in both groups and 
triglycerides decreased significantly in ADF; however there were no between-group 
differences in any lipid parameter changes. Fasting glucose decreased significantly at week 8 
in ADF; however, there were no other within- or between-group differences in changes in 
fasting insulin, glucose, or Si at week 8 or week 32.
Leptin, Ghrelin, and BDNF (Table 6)
There were no between-group differences in change in leptin or ghrelin at week 8 or week 
32. Change in BDNF from baseline to week 8 did not differ between groups. Between 
baseline and week 32, BDNF increased in ADF (4803±2480 pg/mL) but decreased in CR 
(-4234±2453 pg/mL), with a significant between-group difference in change in BDNF 
(p=0.016).
Discussion
This study is the first randomized trial comparing ADF to moderate daily CR. Results 
suggest zero-calorie ADF is safe and tolerable, and is equivalent to moderate CR in 
producing short-term weight loss and improving body composition and metabolic 
parameters. While relative (%) weight loss was greater in the ADF group at the end of the 8-
week intervention, this difference was only marginally significant (p=0.056) and may be 
driven by the differences in baseline body weight between groups. The estimated energy 
deficit from weight maintenance needs over the 8-week intervention was significantly higher 
in ADF compared to CR (by ∼376 kcal/day). This would be expected to result in several 
kilograms greater weight loss in the ADF group; however, weight loss was only 1.1 kg 
greater in ADF. Possible explanations include: 1) the ADF group under-reported food intake 
on fast and/or fed days or 2) fasting led to a reduction in some component of non-resting 
energy expenditure in the ADF group (e.g. PA energy expenditure, thermic effect of food). 
This should be explored in future studies with more accurate assessments of EI and a more 
detailed assessment of components of EE.
Importantly, ADF was not associated with an increased risk for weight regain after 24 weeks 
of unsupervised follow-up. However, composition of weight regain tended to differ. During 
the 24-week follow-up, ADF lost FM (-0.4±0.8 kg) and gained LM (2.0±0.5 kg) while CR 
gained both FM (1.2±0.8 kg) and LM (1.1±0.5 kg). As a result, changes in body 
composition at the end of 24 weeks of follow-up tended to be more favorable in ADF than in 
CR. Because this was a pilot study, we did not formally assess EI or PA during the follow-up 
period. However, some participants in the ADF group reported that they continued to fast 
intermittently (once or twice a week) and this may have contributed to the beneficial changes 
in body composition observed during the follow-up period. Alternatively, the 8-week ADF

 intervention may have induced metabolic or hormonal adaptations that led to this differential 
pattern of weight regain. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the 
difference in baseline body weights and the fact that our study was not powered to detect 
differences in body composition. Nonetheless, determining whether ADF leads to more 
favorable changes in body composition, and the mechanisms via which this may occur, is an 
area worthy of future investigation.
Another factor that may have contributed to the more favorable changes in body composition 
in ADF is RMR. When adjusted for FM and FFM, RMR decreased significantly in CR but 
not in ADF over the 8-week intervention with a trend (p =0.076) for a between-group 
difference. Other studies have found a decrease in RMR greater than expected due to 
changes in body composition alone with weight loss induced by CR [31, 32] consistent with 
what was observed in the CR group over the 8-week intervention. The apparent impact of 
ADF on preserving RMR during weight loss could have clinical significance in preventing 
weight regain after weight loss and should be explored in larger studies.
There were no significant between-group differences in changes in leptin or ghrelin at week 
8 or after 24 weeks of follow-up. Changes in serum BDNF levels were also not different 
between groups at week 8. Surprisingly, after 24 weeks of follow-up, BDNF increased in 
ADF, but decreased in CR (p=0.016). BDNF has been suggested to play a role in regulation 
of energy balance [20-22]. BDNF heterozygous knock-out mice are severely obese and 
exhibit hyperphagia, impaired thermogenesis, and reduced locomotor activity [22]. In 
humans, BDNF mutations are associated with hyperphagia and obesity [33], and a single 
nucleotide polymorphism is related to obesity in large-scale genome-wide association 
studies [34, 35]. Our results suggest ADF induces long-term changes in BDNF secretion, 
which may contribute to improved weight loss maintenance through effects on energy 
balance. This is supported by the more favorable changes in body composition at 24 weeks 
follow-up in the ADF group. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as 
changes in BDNF did not correlate with changes in weight or body composition (data not 
shown).
Total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL decreased significantly in both groups and fasting glucose 
and triglycerides decreased significantly in ADF at 8 weeks; however there were no 
between-group differences in change in metabolic parameters, suggesting the diets had 
similar effects on these metabolic disease risk indicators. These results are similar to those 
of prior studies, which suggest ADF produces improvements in fasting lipids [13-18].
Strengths of the current study include the randomized design, measurement of EI using 
analysis of returned food, and metabolic measurements obtained during a controlled 
inpatient setting. However, this study has several limitations. This was a pilot study 
primarily aimed at assessing safety and tolerability, and the small sample size may explain 
the lack of statistical significance in some outcomes between groups. For example, effect 
sizes for between-group differences in changes in weight at weeks 8 and 32 are small (-0.35 
and -0.12, respectively), confirming we would need a larger sample size to observe a 
significant between-group difference. Randomization was stratified by sex only and resulted 
in a significantly higher mean baseline body weight in CR. Because of the small number of

 males (n=3 per group), we could not determine if there were any sex effects. We did not 
obtain measurements of PA during the intervention or follow-up period, thus it is not 
possible to assess how changes in PA energy expenditure may impact weight loss in either 
group. We do not have measurements of EI or data on whether participants may have 
continued to employ ADF or CR during the follow-up period. Finally, generalizability of 
results is limited because participants were provided all food during the 8-week intervention. 
Food provision may have favored weight loss in CR as they were not burdened with the 
practical challenges of practicing daily CR (i.e. accurately counting calories, choosing 
appropriate portion sizes, making healthy food choices).
Conclusion
Our results suggest an 8-week zero-calorie ADF regimen was safe and tolerable. ADF 
appeared to produce a greater energy deficit from weight-maintenance requirements than 
moderate daily CR, though weight loss and changes in lipids and Si were similar at the end 
of the 8-week intervention. ADF was not associated with greater weight regain after 24 
weeks of unsupervised follow-up. ADF may represent a reasonable alternative dietary 
strategy for treatment of obesity (especially for those that find daily CR difficult) and should 
be explored in larger efficacy studies with a longer intervention period and more detailed 
measures of components of energy balance.

 Study Importance Questions
What is Known About This Topic?
•
Short-term studies (2-12 weeks) suggest alternate-day fasting (ADF) 
may produce 3-8% reductions in body weight, however randomized 
controlled trials comparing ADF to the standard moderate calorie-
restricted diets currently recommended for weight loss are lacking.
•
The safety and tolerability of a zero-calorie ADF regimen is not known.
•
The effects of ADF on body composition, lipids, and insulin sensitivity 
index (Si) have not been well-studied nor is it known whether risk for 
weight regain may be greater after ADF-induced weight loss.
What This Study Adds?
•
No adverse effects were associated with the zero-calorie ADF regimen, 
and most participants (93%) who started the intervention successfully 
completed the 8-week ADF protocol.
•
When compared to a standard moderate calorie-restricted diet (-400 
kcal/day), an ADF regimen produced similar changes in weight, fat 
mass, lean mass, lipids, and insulin sensitivity index (Si) at 8 weeks in 
adults with obesity.
•
Weight regain after 24 weeks of unsupervised follow-up was not 
different between groups, thus the 8-week ADF intervention did not 
appear to increase risk for weight regain.

aLinear Mixed Effects model analysis with unstructured covariance was used to assess the efficacy of intervention on each outcome variable. Test of time by group interaction used to test the efficacy of 
intervention (see p value for overall interaction). Results are mean (SE). Significant p values (p <0.05) are indicated in bold. Effect size (ES) is calculated as (2 × t value)/√DF, where degrees of freedom 
(DF). Hand calculations for between- and within-group differences may not be equal to data shown because all data were rounded to 0.1 decimal place. Weight changes from scale weight (kg) do not match 
weight changes from sum of DXA fat mass and lean mass due to the different methodologies used to measure these outcomes. For CR: n=12 for baseline and week 8; n=10 for week 32; For ADF: n=13 for 
baseline and week 8; n=11 for week 32; Non-missing observations: n = 71.
