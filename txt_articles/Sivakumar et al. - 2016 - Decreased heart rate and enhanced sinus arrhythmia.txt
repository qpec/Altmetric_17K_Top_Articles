Decreased heart rate and enhanced sinus arrhythmia during interictal
sleep demonstrate autonomic imbalance in generalized epilepsy. J
Neurophysiol 115: 1988–1999, 2016. First published February 17,
2016; doi:10.1152/jn.01120.2015.—We hypothesized that epilepsy
affects the activity of the autonomic nervous system even in the
absence of seizures, which should manifest as differences in heart rate
variability (HRV) and cardiac cycle. To test this hypothesis, we
investigated ECG traces of 91 children and adolescents with gener-
alized epilepsy and 25 neurologically normal controls during 30 min
of stage 2 sleep with interictal or normal EEG. Mean heart rate (HR)
and high-frequency HRV corresponding to respiratory sinus arrhyth-
mia (RSA) were quantified and compared. Blood pressure (BP)
measurements from physical exams of all subjects were also collected
and analyzed. RSA was on average significantly stronger in patients
with epilepsy, whereas their mean HR was significantly lower after
adjusting for age, body mass index, and sex, consistent with increased
parasympathetic tone in these patients. In contrast, diastolic (and
systolic) BP at rest was not significantly different, indicating that the
sympathetic tone is similar. Remarkably, five additional subjects,
initially diagnosed as neurologically normal but with enhanced RSA
and lower HR, eventually developed epilepsy, suggesting that in-
creased parasympathetic tone precedes the onset of epilepsy in chil-
dren. ECG waveforms in epilepsy also displayed significantly longer
TP intervals (ventricular diastole) relative to the RR interval. The
relative TP interval correlated positively with RSA and negatively
with HR, suggesting that these parameters are linked through a
common mechanism, which we discuss. Altogether, our results pro-
vide evidence for imbalanced autonomic function in generalized
epilepsy, which may be a key contributing factor to sudden unex-
pected death in epilepsy.
SUDEP; heart rate variability; cardiac cycle; parasympathetic tone;
children
EPILEPTIC SEIZURES ARE KNOWN to have profound effects on
autonomic function (Wyllie 2015). To quantify these effects,
many studies have focused on heart rate (HR) (Behbahani et al.
2016; Jeppesen et al. 2015; Varon et al. 2015a, b; Zijlmans et
al. 2002), cardiac abnormalities (Nei 2009; Smith and Delisle
2015; Varon et al. 2015a), respiration (Bulow and Ingvar 1963;
Nashef et al. 1996), arterial blood pressure (BP) (Oztas and
Turkel 2001), and oxygen saturation (Blum et al. 2000; Szurhaj
et al. 2015) all during ictal periods. Whereas these and other
numerous studies have helped us understand autonomic imbal-
ance associated with seizures, less is understood about auto-
nomic function during the considerably longer interictal peri-
ods, especially during sleep (Varon et al. 2015b). The closure
of this critical gap in understanding has been suggested by
researchers (Kothare and Singh 2014) as essential to obtaining
a complete picture of autonomic regulation in epilepsy. This, in
turn, would better inform us on the physiological mechanisms
of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (Bozorgi and
Lhatoo 2013; Lhatoo et al. 2015; Moghimi and Lhatoo 2013)
and improve the efficacy of risk factors used to provide clinical
prognoses for both epilepsy and SUDEP (Lhatoo et al. 2015;
Varon et al. 2015b).
Furthermore, although clinical observations have shown that
parasympathetic activity is often decreased during ictal periods
in refractory or medication-resistant epilepsy (Kolsal et al.
2014), there is conflicting evidence regarding parasympathetic
tone in interictal periods. For instance, studies on patients with
Rolandic epilepsy have shown that vagal tone is enhanced
compared with neurologically normal controls (Seri et al.
2012), whereas other studies have shown evidence of sympa-
thetic overdrive and parasympathetic depression (Behbahani et
al. 2016; Raju et al. 2012). In light of these opposing findings,
it has been suggested that a more systematic investigation of
sympathoparasympathetic balance in the absence of seizures is
necessary to develop current approaches to treating epilepsy
and preventing SUDEP (Sarkis et al. 2015).
A recent longitudinal study that followed children with
epilepsy undergoing pharmacologic treatment over several
years concluded that “SUDEP is not a rare event in children”
(Terra et al. 2009). As 1.4% of the subjects succumbed to
SUDEP during the study, the authors noted that premature
mortality rates associated with SUDEP could diminish if more
pediatric research were conducted. Researchers investigating
both focal and generalized epilepsy have commented that data

 on children and young adults are scarce (El-Sayed et al. 2007;
Seri et al. 2012), even though SUDEP makes up 14% of all
reported cases of sudden unexpected death in children (Hes-
dorffer et al. 2015). Similarly, a Canadian pediatric surveil-
lance study of children with epilepsy concluded that “risk
factors for SUDEP in children are not well established” and
citing the paucity of current research, called for more pediatric
studies (Donner 2014).
According to Mostacci et al. (2015), “Most cases of
SUDEP� � �occur while people are in bed, presumably sleeping.”
In a clinical study, 58% of all reported SUDEP cases were found
to have occurred during sleep; of these, 86% were unwitnessed
but confirmed through autopsies (Lamberts et al. 2012). System-
atic explorations of the linkages between sleep and SUDEP over
the years have yielded interesting results: significant findings
suggest that SUDEP most commonly occurs during the nonrapid
eye movement (NREM) portion of sleep (Herman et al. 2001)
and that epileptiform activity prone to triggering SUDEP is
prevalent in shallower sleep stages (e.g., stage 2) or the
transition to waking (Lamberts et al. 2012; Menezes Cordeiro
et al. 2015). It has also been observed that when stage 2 sleep
precedes REM sleep or wakefulness, it is accompanied by an
activation of the adrenocorticotropic system that enhances
sympathetic function; however, when stage 2 is followed by
slow-wave sleep (stage 3), sympathetic tone decreases, in
parallel with an activation of the renin-angiotensin system
(Brandenberger et al. 2005). Because of this autonomic-endo-
crine duality, stage 2 sleep is of particular interest in the
context of autonomic function in epilepsy, especially with
regard to SUDEP. In addition, sleep is a consistent resting state
and a good regime for study and comparison of autonomic
function (Kanda et al. 2016).
Investigation of autonomic balance has often been done
through the use of HR variability (HRV), via a set of well-
validated, noninvasive measures of baroreflex sensitivity and
vagal tone (Shaffer et al. 2014; Tobaldini et al. 2013). In
practice, the low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) spectral
power ratio of HRV, a relative measure of the amplitude of LF
(0.04–0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15–0.4 Hz) modulations of HR, is
routinely used in clinical contexts to estimate sympathopara-
sympathetic balance. These LF and HF ranges have been used
previously to examine HRV in children (Akinci et al. 1993;
Blood et al. 2015). However, recent studies have cast doubt on
the accuracy of the LF component of HRV in assessing
sympathetic tone (Goldstein et al. 2011) and, consequently, the
accuracy of the LF/HF ratio in measuring autonomic balance
(Billman 2013). In this study, we will instead consider the
non-normalized HF peak in the power spectral density (PSD)
of HR, widely regarded as the vagal effect of respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA) (Shaffer et al. 2014; Yasuma and Hayano
2004). Use of the raw power of RSA affords interindividual
comparisons of vagal activity in the natural, absolute units of
power density (Indic et al. 2008).
Vagal tone has also been effectively characterized using
time-domain measures of HRV, including mean HR (Meghana
et al. 2015) and the SD of normal beat-to-beat, i.e., R-to-R
(RR), intervals (Nayak et al. 2015). Decreased HR is often
interpreted as sympathetic depression (Abukonna et al. 2013),
but it may also be due to increased parasympathetic activity
and is closely linked with arterial BP and baroreflex sensitivity
(Taylor et al. 2015). Acute elevation of BP (unlike the chronic
condition of hypertension) is considered to be primarily medi-
ated by noradrenergic ganglionic pathways in the sympathetic
nervous system (Guyenet 2006), and diastolic resting BP is a
good measure of barosensitive sympathetic regulation (Joyner
et al. 2010). In children, HRV-related parameters have been
shown to correlate with age: specifically, systolic and diastolic
BPs increase with age in young children (Riley and Bluhm
2012), whereas resting HR decreases quickly after infancy and
continues to decline steadily through adolescence (Fleming et
al. 2011). Pediatric analyses of autonomic function using these
measures should account for age dependence and assess HR
and BP contributions to sympathetic tone independently due to
interdependent regulation involving the arterial baroreflex
(Swenne 2013).
To address the mentioned gaps in the understanding of
sympathoparasympathetic balance in children with epilepsy
and at risk of SUDEP, we analyzed and compared HRV and
ECG waveforms as noninvasive parameters of the autonomic
tone from patients with generalized pediatric epilepsy and
neurologically normal controls during interictal and normal
EEG periods in stage 2 sleep.
METHODS
Subject cohort. Data collection from the EEG/ECG database of the
Pediatric Epilepsy Unit in the Pediatric Neurology Department at
University Hospitals in Cleveland, Ohio, was approved and conducted
in accordance with the ethical standard guidelines and regulations set
by the Institutional Review Board of University Hospitals and Case
Western Reserve University. Subjects were selected based on avail-
ability of sleep ECG and EEG data as well as diagnosis of epilepsy
(either generalized or no epilepsy diagnosis) from all subjects who
had an overnight EEG conducted between January 1, 2008, and
November 1, 2014, at the unit. Records were reviewed retrospec-
tively. A total of 151 subjects was initially selected, 106 with gener-
alized epilepsy and 45 neurologically normal (control group), with
ages ranging from neonates to 22 yr. Monitoring reports from those
subjects included medical history, demographic information, and
results from routine clinical tests performed on children in the Epi-
lepsy Unit. Sex, height, weight, date of birth, date of physical exam,
EEG/ECG evaluation, as well as resting systolic and diastolic BPs
were obtained from these reports. The age of each subject was
determined as the difference between the date of data acquisition and
the date of birth.
Epochs of ECG and EEG data from overnight EEG sleep studies at
University Hospitals were obtained for each subject. These clips
contained 30 uninterrupted min of stage 2 sleep, as determined by a
hospital technician, who also verified, along with a pediatric neurol-
ogist, that the EEG activity recorded was normal (or interictal in
epilepsy). All subjects with epilepsy who were selected had general-
ized epilepsy, with the majority of seizures generalized as tonic-clonic
seizures. Other types of seizures included absence seizures, myoclonic
seizures, and spasms. Subjects were grouped according to final diag-
nosis at the time of discharge.
Subjects from the control group were children who had visited the
Epilepsy Unit due to sleeping problems, staring spells, or recent head
trauma and/or who had family members (particularly siblings or
parents) with epilepsy, which indicated a potential inherited risk for
developing epilepsy. It is common practice at the Epilepsy Unit that
children coming in for a sleep evaluation also receive a routine EEG
to confirm healthy brain activity. Subjects in the control group were
advised to be monitored for a sleep study to rule out epilepsy as a
diagnosis and were diagnosed by a pediatric neurologist specialized in
epilepsy not to have epilepsy, according to their overnight EEG
examination.

AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE IN GENERALIZED EPILEPSY

 All patients already diagnosed with epilepsy before the EEG/ECG
evaluation were on a version of the ketogenic diet and had been taking
anti-epileptic medications. For the overnight EEG/ECG evaluation
itself, patients were asked not to take their medications during this
period to minimize their effect on the recorded signals. Commonly
taken anti-epileptic medications included enhancers of GABAergic
signaling (clonazepam, tiagabine), modulators of sodium and calcium
channels (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, zonisamide), and antagonists
of glutamate receptors (clobazam, phenobarbital) and medications that
may decrease blood pH (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as
topiramate); more frequently, patients took combinations of these
medications. Specific details regarding dosages (amount, frequency,
timing, etc.) were not available to the data collection.
Exclusion criteria and group characteristics. Subjects with unus-
able ECG data due to movement artifacts, interruptions, or technical
issues were obviously excluded from the analyses. Subjects with
monitoring reports but without corresponding EEG or ECG record-
ings on or immediately after the date of admission into the Pediatric
Epileptic Unit were also excluded from the study. Subjects with
multiple dates of admission and multiple sleep evaluations were
identified, and only the most recently collected 30-min clip from each
of these patients was selected for analysis. Neither the nature of
anti-epileptic medications nor their possible combination or dose was
considered as an exclusion criterion.
While finding subjects based on our selection criteria, we discov-
ered five subjects who were initially diagnosed as neurologically
normal but developed epilepsy after the first sleep study. Of these five
subjects, two had not been taking any medications regularly by the
time of the overnight sleep study, and the other three were taking a
sleep aid (melatonin), medication for attention deficit disorder (am-
phetamine), asthma medications (albuterol, montekulast, budesonide),
and/or anxiety medications (risperidone, sertraline) but no anti-epi-
leptic medications. None of these five subjects had reported experi-
encing any kind of seizure before the time of data acquisition nor had
they been diagnosed previously with epilepsy; additionally, the EEG
data collected during the sleep study were deemed to be normal by a
pediatric neurologist. However, hospital records more recent than the
time frame of this retrospective study confirm that these subjects later
developed and were diagnosed with epilepsy. We also observed that
seven neurologically normal subjects, according to the EEG evalua-
tion, were taking anti-epileptic medication at the time of data acqui-
sition as a preventive measure to treat psychogenic, nonepileptic
seizures.
Both the group of five subjects who later developed epilepsy and
the group of seven nonepileptic patients taking anti-epileptic medica-
tion were excluded from the main cohort but were analyzed separately
to determine the potential of RSA and HR as prognostic biomarkers
for epilepsy (see RESULTS). The demographic composition of these two
groups did not appear to be essentially different from the rest of the
cohort.
After application of all of the exclusionary criteria, 25 control
subjects and 91 patients with generalized epilepsy remained in the
main cohort for analysis. Subjects in the control group had a mean age
of 7.5 yr, with an SD of 6.4 yr, whereas patients with epilepsy had a
mean age of 10.5 yr, with an SD of 5.0 yr. Of the control subjects, 5
(20%) were male, and 20 (80%) were female, whereas 64 patients
(70%) were male, and 27 (30%) were female in the epilepsy group. To
minimize the effect of these asymmetric proportions on our results, we
adjusted all measured parameters of interest for age, body mass index
(BMI), and sex (see below).
Analysis of HRV. ECG data were imported into MATLAB (version
2015a; MathWorks, Natick, MA) for analysis with custom-written
software (developed by S. S. Sivakumar and R. F. Galán). ECG spike
detection (R wave) was performed on ECG traces (with sampling
frequency 200 Hz) and their time derivatives with a double-threshold
set at the 98th percentile of the mean-subtracted rectified ECG and
98th percentile of the rectified time derivative of the ECG, over a
sliding time window of 10 s. Each signal fluctuation exceeding both
thresholds within a margin of 0.2 s was registered as a single beat,
marked at the maximum point of the ECG trace within that margin.
Histograms of the interbeat interval distribution were manually in-
spected for high variability and outliers due to missed or incorrectly
detected beats. Errors in the automatic beat detection algorithm
(�5%) were either due to sharp P or T waves that were erroneously
identified as beats or to blunt R waves that were not detected. These
errors were manually corrected and blinded to the subject’s identity
and diagnosis.
HR series were calculated as the reciprocal of each interbeat
interval and plotted against the time point of the initial beat in each
interval. Cubic-spline interpolation was then used to generate the
instantaneous HR at regular time intervals with a sampling rate of 200
Hz over the duration of the 30-min recording. For each subject, the
mean HR was calculated as the time average of the instantaneous HR.
A zero-phase, digital high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.1
Hz was applied to the instantaneous HR to eliminate LF variability
uniformly across subjects. MATLAB’s implementation of the multi-
taper PSD estimate (Thomson 1982) was then used to compute the
PSD of the HR for each subject. The height of the peak in the PSD and
its location were recorded for each subject, which correspond to the
power density and frequency of the RSA.
The power density unit of a signal measured in units of U is U2/Hz;
thus the instantaneous HR, measured in hertz, has power density
measured in units of Hz2/Hz � Hz, and therefore, both power density
and frequency of RSA were measured in units of hertz. When
assessing correlations between power density of RSA and other
parameters, power density was instead expressed in units of decibels
via the formula RSAdB � 10·log10 (RSAHz/1 Hz).
ECG waveform analysis. A cycle-triggered average ECG was
computed for each subject as follows: the mean-subtracted ECG
waveform during each RR interval was mapped onto a fixed interval
of 360 linearly spaced samples, such that one sample corresponds to
1° in the cardiac cycle. We then averaged these cycles degree by
degree to obtain the average ECG waveform over the RR interval.
Adjustment of measured parameters for age, BMI, and sex. When
comparing parameters of HRV and ECG waveforms between groups,
we investigated the covariation of these parameters with age, BMI,
and sex, with the intent to adjust for these correlations if present. BMI
was computed using the formula mass/height2, with mass measured in
units of kilograms and height measured in units of meters; height (in
centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) measurements were taken
during the clinical check-up at the time of ECG data acquisition. Sex
was coded as a binary variable, with zero representing male and one
representing female.
A linear model of the form y � �0 � �1x1 � �2x2 � �3x3 was then
computed for each parameter of interest, e.g., HR (y) as a function of
age (x1), BMI (x2), and sex (x3), using the MATLAB “fitlm” function.
The validity of the model was assessed with three sequential tests,
whose outputs are reported (see Tables 1–4). 1) An F-test is used for
the null hypothesis that the regression coefficients �1, �2, �3 are all
equal to zero or, equivalently, that the model is constant; i.e.,
y � �0. We report (see Tables 1–4) the F-statistic, its critical value for
significance (F#), and its P value. If F � F#, then parameter y does not
significantly covary with age, BMI, or sex and does not require further
adjustment. 2) If F � F#, then a t-test for each individual regression
coefficient determines if the covariation of its associated variable
with the parameter of interest (y) is significant. 3) The residuals of

adjustment of parameter y for age, BMI, and sex. If the adjustment is
meaningful, then the residuals must be distributed normally; other-
wise, the model does not capture relevant covariations in the dataset.
We tested the null hypothesis of normality of the residuals with the
Lilliefors test (Lilliefors 1967). We provide the D-statistic of this test,
its threshold value to reject the null hypothesis (D#), and its P value

 (see Tables 1–4). The null hypothesis was not rejected for any of the
parameters that required adjustment.
Statistical tests for group comparisons and correlation coefficients.
Statistical analyses for HRV and waveform measures between groups
were conducted using MATLAB’s implementation of Wilcoxon’s
rank sum test, a nonparametric test that compares the medians of two
one-dimensional distributions through a ranking process (Wilcoxon
1950). Correlation coefficients (r) were computed, according to Pear-
son’s formula (Press et al. 1992). The value of r was then transformed
as t � r ��N�2� ⁄ �1�r2� and compared with Student’s t-distribu-
tion with N � 2 degrees of freedom, where N is the number of
subjects, to determine the P value (Press et al. 1992).
In the figures and tables, lack of statistical significance is indicated
as not significant (n.s.), whereas statistical significance is indicated
with a single asterisk for P values between 0.05 and 0.01 (significant)
and with two asterisks for P values below 0.01 (highly significant).
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and receiver-operating
characteristic. Sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) measure the per-
formance of a binary classification test (i.e., whether or not the subject
has epilepsy). SE is defined as the proportion of positive cases that are
correctly classified as such (i.e., fraction of subjects with epilepsy that
are classified as epileptic). Similarly, SP is defined as the proportion
of negative cases that are correctly classified as such (i.e., fraction of
subjects who are not epileptic and are classified as controls). Accuracy
(AC) is a “compromise” between SE and SP, defined as the ratio of
correctly labeled cases out of the total number of cases. The
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) was obtained by plotting
the SE and SP at increasing values of the parameter for binary
classification (Florkowski 2008). The optimal discriminating
threshold was determined as the value of the parameter that
maximized the sum of SE and SP.
RESULTS
HRV in epilepsy. Clear differences in both mean HR and
HRV are readily observed in patients with epilepsy compared
with control subjects. Figure 1, A and B, shows two represen-
tative ECG traces during sleep in a control subject and a patient
with epilepsy, respectively. It is apparent that the mean HR is
lower in the patient with epilepsy, as evidenced by the in-
creased RR intervals. In addition, the instantaneous HR dis-
plays a stronger oscillation, corresponding to RSA over the
short 30-s window depicted (Fig. 1, C and D). The amplitude
of the oscillation is quantified by the HF peak in the power
spectrum of instantaneous HR computed over the 30-min
epoch; the amplitude is much higher in the subject with
epilepsy (Fig. 1, E and F). The combination of lower HR and
stronger RSA points to an enhancement of parasympathetic
activity in epilepsy during interictal periods in stage 2 sleep.
These observations are consistent across subjects. Figure 2A
demonstrates that the median power of RSA is increased by
97% in epilepsy (medians: 0.028 Hz for control, 0.055 Hz for
epilepsy; P � 3e-4, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test), whereas the
frequency of RSA, a measure of the respiratory frequency, is
not significantly different between groups (medians: 0.31 Hz
for control, 0.87 Hz for epilepsy; P � 0.06, Wilcoxon’s rank

 sum test; Fig. 2B). In contrast, Fig. 2C shows that the HR is
reduced by 21% (medians: 1.64 Hz for control, 1.29 Hz for
epilepsy; P � 4e-5, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) during interictal
periods in stage 2 sleep.
These three HRV parameters (power of RSA, frequency
of RSA, and HR) were regressed on age, BMI, and sex to
correct for possible effects of these variables, as described
in METHODS. Table 1 displays the F-test for the linear model,
the regression parameters, their significance based on t-tests,
and Lilliefors test values for the regression model for RSA
(see METHODS). The regression models for power of RSA
(F � 1.09, P � 0.355, F-test for nonconstant model) and
frequency of RSA (F � 1.87, P � 0.139, F-test for non-
constant model) were both not significant. However, the
model outlined in Table 2 reveals that HR significantly
covaries with age and sex (F � 28.8, P � 7e-14, F-test for
nonconstant model).
Importantly, the effect of decreased HR in epilepsy is still
highly significant after adjusting for age, BMI, and sex
(P � 2e-3, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test; Fig. 2D). Since these
covariates do not affect the significance of the difference in HR
between groups, we used the raw HR for most of the analyses.
In addition, we show that RSA power and adjusted mean HR
are negatively correlated (r � �0.50, P � 1e-8, Pearson’s
correlation; Fig. 2E), consistent with their being simultane-
ously modulated by parasympathetic activity. This correlation
is mostly accounted for by the subjects with epilepsy, as it
loses significance when considering the controls only (r �

 �0.11, P � 0.62, Pearson’s correlation). Finally, frequency of
RSA and HR share a significant positive correlation (r � 0.26,
P � 4e-3, Pearson’s correlation; Fig. 2F), a well-documented
trend (Fleming et al. 2011; Pitzalis et al. 1998; Song and Lehrer
2003).
HRV as biomarker for epilepsy. Can RSA power and mean
HR during interictal sleep serve as sensitive clinical metrics?
To test this possibility, we computed the SE, SP, and AC of
these measures (see METHODS) to identify individuals at risk for
developing epilepsy and potentially, experiencing SUDEP. To
this end, we plotted the ROC curves for each parameter (Fig.
3, A and B) and determined their optimal discriminating thresh-
olds (see METHODS). We note that the optimal threshold for RSA
power (0.05 Hz) labels more than one-half of the subjects with
epilepsy in our cohort as epileptic (SE � 57%) but correctly
labels all of the neurologically normal controls (SP � 100%).
The optimal threshold for mean HR (1.40 Hz) is more sensitive
(SE � 73%) but less specific (SP � 76%). Both measures have
a moderately high AC (AC � 66% for power of RSA; AC �
73% for mean HR). A combination of both RSA power and
mean HR appears even more promising in the context of
classification. In particular, we found the ratio of power of
RSA/mean HR (conveniently unitless) also to be significantly
different between groups (P � 2e-5, Wilcoxon’s rank sum
test), with ROC curve as shown in Fig. 3C. Its optimal
discriminating threshold (0.03) was 63% sensitive, 100% spe-
cific, and 71% accurate. Figure 3D displays for comparison the
SE, SP, and AC for RSA, HR, and RSA/HR.
To test the classification performance of RSA, HR, and their
ratio as prognostic biomarkers, we used the optimal thresholds
for the three parameters to attempt classification of two groups
of subjects previously excluded from analysis (see Exclusion
criteria and group characteristics in METHODS): 1) five subjects
that developed epilepsy at a later point and 2) seven subjects
that were taking anti-epileptic medication at the time of data
acquisition to prevent nonepileptic, psychogenic seizures,
along with other abnormalities, including tics, spells, and
fainting. We determined that the optimal thresholds for both
power of RSA and RSA/HR independently identified 10 out of
12 (83%) of these subjects as those with epilepsy, whereas the
optimal threshold for mean HR classified 7 out of 12 (58%) of
these subjects as those with epilepsy.
Normal BP and sympathetic tone at rest. Up to this point,
our results are consistent with an enhancement of parasympa-
thetic tone in generalized epilepsy, but the decrease in HR is
also consistent with withdrawal of sympathetic tone. To test
this, we analyzed the resting diastolic BP and for the sake of
completeness, the systolic BP. These measurements were taken
at rest before sleep trials but serve as a control for comparing
sympathetic tone in a nonsleep resting state, as is routinely
done in clinical settings (Joyner et al. 2010). We found that
neither systolic BP (medians: 112 mmHg for control, 109
mmHg for epilepsy; P � 0.97, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) nor
diastolic BP (medians: 60.5 mmHg for control, 65.5 mmHg for
epilepsy; P � 0.14, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) was signifi-
cantly different between groups (Fig. 3, E and F). In the
process of adjusting for natural covariates, both BP measures
were found to be positively correlated with age; systolic BP
was additionally correlated with BMI (F � 19.8, P � 2e-10,
F-test for nonconstant model), and diastolic BP was addition-
ally correlated with sex (F � 11.0, P � 2e-6, F-test for
nonconstant model). Neither adjusted systolic BP (P � 0.15,
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) nor adjusted diastolic BP (P � 0.75,
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) was found to be significantly dif-
ferent between groups. These results suggest that sympathetic
tone in pediatric epilepsy during interictal periods, at least
during wakefulness at rest, is comparable with normal sympa-
thetic tone.
Lengthened ventricular diastole relative to cardiac cycle.
All significant effects reported thus far are chronotropic; i.e.,
they refer to the cardiac rhythm. We then wanted to investigate
whether inotropic effects (related to cardiac contraction) and
dromotropic effects (related to conduction of electrical activity
in the heart) may be affected by epilepsy. To this end, we
analyzed canonical features of the ECG waveforms. Two
representative cycle-triggered ECG traces (Fig. 4A) show that
the relevant waves are similar in amplitude in epilepsy and
control but that cardiac intervals of interest seem to be differ-
ent. We thus analyzed these amplitudes and durations across
subjects.
We focused first on the QT interval, a measure of the
duration of ventricular systole, using standard methodology to
identify its start and end (van Noord et al. 2010) and normal-

 ized it relative to the RR interval (see METHODS). When com-
paring between groups, the percentage of the RR interval that
is QT appeared to be significantly shorter in epilepsy (medians:
39.4% for control, 36.7% for epilepsy; P � 3e-3, Wilcoxon’s
rank sum test; Fig. 4B). However, regression of the QT interval
on age, BMI, and sex revealed a negative correlation with age
and a strong correlation with sex (Table 3), both of which have
been reported previously in the literature (Rautaharju et al.
1992). After adjusting the QT/RR parameter (see METHODS), we
found that this shortening was no longer significant between
groups (P � 0.36, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test; Fig. 4C).
We also analyzed the percentage of the RR interval that is
PR or the duration of atrial systole. This interval was signifi-
cantly shorter in epilepsy (medians: 21% for control, 17% for
epilepsy; P � 6e-5, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test; Fig. 4D) and did
not produce a significant regression with age, BMI, or sex
(F � 2.4, P � 0.07, F-test for nonconstant model) and
consequently, does not appear to be due to covariations with
those three variables. This result indicates that in addition to
chronotropic affects, generalized epilepsy is associated with
dromotropic effects, at least during stage 2 sleep.
A shortening in atrial (PR) but not ventricular (QT) systole
relative to the whole cardiac cycle must occur at the expense of
lengthening the diastole. We thus investigated the ventricular
diastole via the relative duration of the TP interval, and indeed, the
TP/RR parameter was found to be significantly longer in epilepsy
(medians: 43% for control, 51% for epilepsy; P � 4e-6, Wilco-
xon’s rank sum test; Fig. 4E). After adjustment for significant
correlations with age and sex (Table 4), the relative TP interval
was still significantly longer in epilepsy (P � 5e-3, Wilcoxon’s
rank sum test; Fig. 4F). Importantly, the lengthening of the
relative TP interval was positively correlated with RSA power
(r � 0.41, P � 4e-4, Pearson’s correlation; Fig. 4G) and nega-
tively correlated with adjusted HR (r � �0.70, P � 1e-18,
Pearson’s correlation; Fig. 4H), suggesting that these three param-
eters are mechanistically linked.
Finally, we analyzed the relative amplitude between R and S
waves (the largest voltage difference between the two peaks)
and found that this quantity is not significantly different be-
tween groups (medians: 558 �V for control, 699 �V for
epilepsy; P � 0.49, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test; Fig. 4I). Other
relative amplitudes displayed similar nonsignificance and are
omitted for simplicity. These results were maintained after
adjusting for age, BMI, and sex, suggesting that inotropic
effects are negligible in generalized epilepsy.

 inconsistent results regarding epileptic parasympathetic activ-
ity during these periods (Behbahani et al. 2016; Raju et al.
2012; Seri et al. 2012), we analyzed HRV of children and
adolescents during sleep in the absence of seizures and found
two key indicators of increased vagal tone: enhanced RSA
and decreased HR. These results are consistent with previ-
ous findings (Seri et al. 2012) and extend them to pediatric
patients with generalized forms of epilepsy other than focal
benign Rolandic epilepsy. We also investigated parameters
of the ECG waveforms and found that the ventricular
diastole normalized by the RR interval was significantly
longer in generalized epilepsy at the expense of shorter
atrial systole, demonstrating abnormal conduction of elec-
trical activity in the heart. Other physiological parameters,
including frequency of RSA (corresponding to respiratory
frequency), systolic and diastolic BP, and the amplitudes of
the P, Q, R, S, and T waveforms of the ECG, were similar
between controls and patients with generalized epilepsy.

 Possible physiological mechanisms. The three main findings
of this paper—enhanced RSA, decreased HR, and lengthened
ventricular diastole—can be readily explained by increased
parasympathetic tone, leading to enhanced cholinergic neuro-
modulation of the cardiac cycle. The question of why the
parasympathetic tone is enhanced demands further and deeper
investigation. It may be due to a homeostatic mechanism,
secondary to the primary cause of epilepsy, or perhaps more
intriguingly, increased parasympathetic tone may be a leading
factor in the etiology and development of the disease. The fact
that enhanced RSA and lower HR preceded epilepsy in five
subjects in our cohort who were originally diagnosed as neu-
rologically normal lends support to the latter interpretation.
As for the homeostatic interpretation, we note that the
increased parasympathetic tone during sleep in the absence of
epileptiform activity contrasts with the sympathetic overex-
pression frequently observed during and after ictal events
(Behbahani et al. 2016; Kolsal et al. 2014; Nagai 2015; Poh et
al. 2012). These discrepant observations suggest that the func-
tion of the autonomic nervous system is fundamentally differ-
ent during ictal and interictal periods in children with gener-
alized epilepsy and that assessment of the risk of multifactorial
conditions, such as SUDEP, requires a more nuanced under-
standing of the mechanisms of autonomic activity both during
and in the absence of seizures.
Is abnormal HRV in epilepsy iatrogenic? An alternative
mechanistic interpretation of our results is that abnormal HRV
in generalized epilepsy is caused by the anti-epileptic medica-
tions themselves. We believe that this possibility is unlikely,
because patients with higher values of RSA power (�0.1 Hz,
i.e., greater than twice the optimal discriminating threshold)
took anti-epileptic medications that were also taken by patients
with RSA values comparable with the controls. In fact, there
were only three epileptic patients with high values of RSA
power who took medications (cefdinir, azithromycin, and
midazolam) that no other patient took (each patient took only
one of these medications, so there was no overlap); the first two
are nonpenicillin antibiotics, and the third is a sleep aid of the
benzodiazepine class, which is not used primarily to treat
epilepsy.
Perhaps the strongest argument against the interpretation
that our findings are iatrogenic is that the five subjects who
were neurologically normal at the time of the ECG recordings
and who did not take any anti-epileptic medications at that
time, already presented with abnormally higher RSA and lower
HR before developing epilepsy at a later point. Two of them
did not take any medications at all, and the other three took
medications for attention deficits (e.g., amphetamine), asthma
(e.g., albuterol), and anxiety (e.g., sertraline).
Cautionary remarks on vagal nerve stimulation. A more
detailed understanding of autonomic function in epilepsy is
crucial to administering therapies effectively for epilepsy, such
as vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), which has more recently
become an established method of treating drug-resistant epi-
lepsy (Connor et al. 2012). It is well known that VNS affects
chronotropic and inotropic regulation of cardiac activity and
that controlling specific parameters of vagal stimulation (such
as current and frequency) can elicit different changes to car-
diorespiratory function (Rousselet et al. 2014). However, nu-
merous authors have questioned whether VNS in its current
form is an appropriate treatment for epilepsy, as its mechanism
of action is still unclear, and it does not appear to lower the
mortality rate due to complications, including SUDEP (Gran-
bichler et al. 2015). In fact, VNS may even increase the risk of
SUDEP (Annegers et al. 1998). VNS has been shown to
regulate sympathetic activation of the sinoatrial node (Zhou et
al. 2016) and reduce resting HR (Mulders et al. 2015) and is
believed to enhance parasympathetic activity (Kampusch et al.
2015). Additionally, VNS is hypothesized to worsen sleep-
breathing disorders via altered laryngeal motility (Zambrelli et
al. 2016) and has been shown to trigger obstructive sleep
apnea, a condition often coupled with an overexpression of
parasympathetic activity (Ebben et al. 2008; Parhizgar et al.
2011; Vollono et al. 2015).
In the context of our findings, VNS may further increase the
abnormally enhanced vagal tone that we observe in patients
with epilepsy, thereby enhancing the respiratory modulation of
HR and incidence of apnea during sleep when VNS is often
activated (Ebben et al. 2008) and decreasing the HR, which
potentially increases the risk of SUDEP. Our results suggest
that a more thorough investigation into the autonomic effects
of vagal neurostimulation during sleep is needed, especially in
pediatric epilepsy, where consequences of autonomic pertur-
bation may be more severe and perhaps fatal (Annegers et al.
1998).

 Alternative therapeutic targets for epilepsy. With the con-
sideration of alternative treatments for epilepsy, the use of
parasympathetic modulators appears to have been over-
looked as well. Common anti-epileptic medications in use
are known to impact sympathetic regulation, but the short-
and long-term effects of these medications on parasympa-
thetic function are poorly understood. For instance, benzo-
diazepines are an often-prescribed family of drugs that
allosterically enhance GABAergic function to enhance in-
hibition and hence, manage epileptic conditions (Riss et al.
2008). They ostensibly inhibit sympathetic neuronal activ-
ity, but a mechanistic understanding remains elusive (Zah-
ner et al. 2007), and the discussion regarding the impact of
benzodiazepines on parasympathetic function is meager.
Further research into parasympathetic routes to control
seizures and prevent SUDEP may be fruitful, provided the
following: 1) that the mechanisms of action of drugs that
affect autonomic function are better understood and 2) that
care is taken to regulate the parasympathetic tone appropri-
ately in epilepsy during interictal periods.
HRV as a prognostic biomarker. The consideration of RSA
and HR as potential biomarkers for the development of
epilepsy is a natural ramification of the significant altera-
tions to autonomic balance observed in our study. We find
that the use of power of RSA and mean HR (either before or
after, correcting for age effects) as predictors for epilepsy is
moderately accurate, and the ratio of power of RSA/mean
HR is highly specific and as accurate as either parameter
independently. Most remarkably, all three measures classi-
fied more than one-half of subjects not diagnosed with
epilepsy but with a history of seizures as having epilepsy,
whereas power of RSA and the RSA/HR ratio both correctly
identified five subjects as having epilepsy before clinical
diagnosis. This demonstrates the potential of HRV as a
noninvasive, prognostic biomarker for epilepsy, which has
been overlooked previously.
Limitations. We analyzed data retrospectively from a sin-
gle pediatric unit. As is the case for any study with a
geographically/temporally constrained dataset, it will be
important for future studies to expand the analyses to an
even more diverse set of subjects, such as those with focal
epilepsy. Our study is also constrained to stage 2 sleep (the
only one systematically available for subjects in the data-
base) as the regime for comparison. Whereas studies have
shown that stage 2 sleep and its transition between slow-
wave sleep and REM or wakefulness are of high interest in
the context of autonomic function in SUDEP (Kanda et al.
2016; Menezes Cordeiro et al. 2015), we did not have
control either over the selected portion of stage 2 sleep
available for each subject or over which epoch of stage 2
sleep was selected over the course of the overnight obser-
vation period at the Pediatric Epilepsy Unit. Consequently,
we could not determine whether stage 2 sleep EEG and ECG
data were taken immediately following or preceding stage 1
sleep, stage 3 sleep, REM sleep, or awakening. This infor-
mation would be useful in light of a previous study demon-
strating autonomic-endocrine profiles in stage 2, depending
on its occurrence relative to contiguous stages of sleep
(Brandenberger et al. 2005). Further studies may address all
of these concerns by collecting and maintaining ECG and
EEG data throughout the sleep period and analyzing each
epoch of interest with respect to the total elapsed time of
sleep.
Conclusions. Our results provide novel evidence that para-
sympathetic tone is enhanced during interictal periods in
stage 2 NREM sleep in children with generalized epilepsy.
We show that certain measures of HRV during interictal
activity in sleep, including RSA and mean HR, may be
overlooked risk factors for epilepsy and that the RSA/HR
ratio may be a potential prognostic biomarker for epilepsy
itself. These results set the stage for developing a more
detailed understanding of autonomic dysfunction in patients
with epilepsy by highlighting the dissimilarity between
sympathovagal imbalance during ictal and interictal periods.
Our findings also shed light onto a possible autonomic
mechanism for SUDEP and promote investigation into para-
sympathetic modulators as potential treatments for epilepsy,
particularly in children and adolescents.
