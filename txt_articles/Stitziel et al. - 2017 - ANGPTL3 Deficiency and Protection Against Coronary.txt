Abstract
BACKGROUND—Familial combined hypolipidemia, a Mendelian condition characterized by 
substantial reductions in all 3 major lipid fractions, is caused by mutations that inactivate the gene 
angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3). Whether ANGPTL3 deficiency reduces risk of coronary artery 
disease (CAD) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES—The study goal was to leverage 3 distinct lines of evidence – a family that 
included individuals with complete (compound heterozygote) ANGPTL3 deficiency, a population 
based-study of humans with partial (heterozygote) ANGPTL3 deficiency, and biomarker levels in

 myocardial infarction (MI) patients – to test if ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with lower risk 
for CAD.
METHODS—We assessed coronary atherosclerotic burden in 3 individuals with complete 
ANGPTL3 deficiency and 3 wild-type first-degree relatives using computed tomography 
angiography. In the population, ANGPTL3 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were ascertained in 
up to 21,980 individuals with CAD and 158,200 controls. LOF mutations were defined as 
nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, along with missense variants resulting in <25% of 
wild-type ANGPTL3 activity in a mouse model. In a biomarker study, circulating ANGPTL3 
concentration was measured in 1,493 individuals presenting with MI and 3,232 controls.
RESULTS—The 3 individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency showed no evidence of 
coronary atherosclerotic plaque. ANGPTL3 gene sequencing demonstrated that approximately 1 
in 309 individuals was a heterozygous carrier for an LOF mutation. Compared to those without 
mutation, heterozygous carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF mutations demonstrated a 17% reduction in 
circulating triglycerides and a 12% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Carrier status 
was associated with a 34% reduction in odds of CAD (odds ratio: 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 
0.44 to 0.98; p = 0.04). Individuals in the lowest tertile of circulating ANGPTL3 concentrations, 
compared with the highest, had reduced odds of MI (adjusted odds ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.55 to 0.77; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS—ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with protection from CAD.

Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations leading to complete deficiency of angiopoietin-like 3 
(ANGPTL3) cause familial combined hypolipidemia, a Mendelian disorder characterized by 
low circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) (1). ANGPTL3 is a hepatically-
secreted protein first identified via positional cloning of a hypolipidemic mouse strain (2). 
ANGPTL3 acts as a potent inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the primary mechanism by 
which triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are cleared from the circulation (3). In addition, 
ANGPTL3 is an endogenous inhibitor of endothelial lipase (EL) (4). Loss of ANGPTL3 
function appears to decrease triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and HDL cholesterol 
concentrations through loss of LPL and EL inhibition, respectively. The mechanism by 
which ANGPTL3 regulates LDL cholesterol metabolism remains unclear (5). The seemingly 
favorable implications of ANGPTL3 deficiency in reducing TG concentrations and 
circulating LDL cholesterol catalyzed drug development programs aiming to inhibit 
ANGPTL3 using either a monoclonal antibody (5) or an antisense oligonucleotide (6).
Although decreased atherosclerotic burden was observed in Angptl3 knockout mice (7), the 
relationship of ANGPTL3 deficiency to coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans remains 
uncertain. Individuals who carry LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 have lifelong reductions of 
circulating ANGPTL3 (8); as such, the clinical phenotypes of these individuals may inform 
the potential therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological ANGPTL3 inhibition.

 Here, we tested the hypothesis that ANGPTL3 deficiency reduces risk of CAD in humans. 
We compared coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden in individuals who had complete 
ANGPTL3 deficiency (caused by compound heterozygous LOF mutations in ANGPTL3) 
with wild-type first-degree relatives. Next, we examined the coding regions of ANGPTL3 in 
up to 180,180 individuals, identified those who carried LOF mutations in this gene with the 
aid of mouse models, and determined whether those mutations were associated with a lower 
risk of CAD. Finally, we measured circulating ANGPTL3 concentrations in individuals 
presenting with a first-ever myocardial infarction (MI) and compared them to concentrations 
in individuals without MI.
METHODS
The original kindred used to map ANGPTL3 as a cause of familial combined hypolipidemia 
was recruited in the Lipid Research Clinic at the Washington University School of Medicine 
between 1994 and 1997. We recontacted all individuals from the kindred who inherited 
compound heterozygous LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 and invited them to participate in the 
current study. Three of the 4 compound heterozygous carriers (individuals II-1, II-2, and II-4 
in Online Figure 1) were available to participate and were matched to 3 first-degree relatives 
who did not carry any ANGPTL3 LOF mutation (individuals II-8, II-7, and II-10 in Online 
Figure 1, respectively). Fasting laboratory values, including plasma lipids, were measured in 
all participants using standard clinical assays. Coronary computed tomography angiography 
(CCTA) was used to quantify coronary artery calcification and atherosclerotic plaque 
burden. Details of the image acquisition and post-acquisition processing are included in the 
Online Appendix. The Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review 
Board approved all study protocols.
ASCERTAINMENT OF LOF MUTATIONS IN ANGPTL3
We identified carriers of an LOF mutation in ANGPTL3 using previously generated exome 
sequencing data from 9 case-control studies of the Myocardial Infarction Genetics 
Consortium. These included the ATVB (Italian Atherosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular 
Biology) study (9), the ESP-EOMI (Exome Sequencing Project Early-Onset Myocardial 
Infarction) study (10), the South German Myocardial Infarction study (11), OHS (Ottawa 
Heart Study) (12), PROCARDIS (Precocious Coronary Artery Disease Study) (13), 
PROMIS (Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study) (14), the Registre Gironi del COR 
(Gerona Heart Registry or REGICOR) study (15), the BHF-FHS (British Heart Foundation 
Family Heart Study) (16), and the Lubeck Myocardial Infarction study (16). Furthermore, 
we extracted ANGPTL3 sequence data from exome sequencing performed in the Jackson 
Heart Study (17), the BioImage study (18), and the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) population-based cohort study (19) in addition to targeted sequencing in the 
Duke CATHGEN case-control study (20). Loss-of-function mutations included those 
leading to truncation via a premature stop codon (nonsense), insertions or deletions that 
scramble protein translation beyond the variant site (frameshift), or point mutations at sites 
of pre-messenger ribonucleic acid splicing that alter the splicing process (splice-site). 
Additional data for rs372257803, an intronic splice region variant in ANGPTL3 previously 
linked to significantly reduced circulating triglyceride levels (21), was obtained using high-

 quality genotype imputation in the United Kingdom Biobank (22), the PennCath study (23), 
and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium Coronary Artery Disease study (24). All 
variant positions were based on the ANGPTL3 canonical transcript (ENST00000371129). 
Additional details on gene sequencing, the imputation of rs372257803, and study cohorts are 
included in the Online Appendix.
FUNCTIONAL VALIDATION OF MISSENSE VARIANTS IN ANGPTL3 LEADING TO LOF
Beyond the mutations that lead to LOF due to nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site disruption, 
studies based on evolutionary conservation suggested that about 20% of all missense 
mutations lead to severe decrements in protein function (25,26). We sought to 
experimentally define such variants in ANGPTL3 using a mouse model. Rare (minor allele 
frequency <1%) missense variants were prioritized if they were: 1) predicted to be damaging 
or possibly damaging by each of 5 in silico prediction algorithms (LRT score, 
MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, PolyPhen-2 HumVar, and Sorting Intolerant From 
Tolerant); and 2) present in at least 2 sequenced individuals of the Myocardial Infarction 
Genetics Consortium cohorts.
For the set of ANGPTL3 missense variants identified previously, the functional significance 
of each variant was determined using adenoviral vectors developed to reconstitute the 
expression of the human ANGPTL3 ortholog in the livers of Angptl3 knockout mice. 
Vectors were engineered to contain either the wild-type ANGPTL3 gene or the missense 
variant of interest. Missense variants were annotated as LOF if they conferred <25% of wild-
type activity as assessed by percent change in circulating TG levels and percent change in 
circulating cholesterol levels induced by expression. Additional details are described in the 
Online Appendix.
ANGPTL3 PLASMA CONCENTRATION
Using a previously validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biovendor, Prague, 
Czech Republic) (27), plasma ANGPTL3 concentrations were measured in individuals from 
PROMIS (14), a study that included cases presenting with a first-ever MI and controls free 
of MI.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
For changes in circulating triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the mouse models, 
normality of data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and equality of variance was 
assessed using the F-test; p values were calculated using 2-sided paired samples t tests. The 
association of ANGPTL3 LOF mutations, analyzed in aggregate, with total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and log-transformed TGs was assessed using linear regression 
with adjustment for the covariates of age, age squared, sex, study cohort, CAD status, and 
the first 5 principal components of ancestry. We accounted for the effect of lipid-lowering 
therapy in participants reporting such use at the time of lipid measurement by dividing the 
measured total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by 0.8 and 0.7, respectively (28,29); HDL 
cholesterol and triglyceride values were not adjusted. The association of ANGPTL3 
mutations with risk of CAD was determined via meta-analysis utilizing Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel statistics for stratified 2-by-2 tables as implemented previously (30). In calculating

 the study-specific odds ratio of disease, an adjustment of 0.5 was added to all counts in 
studies with zero mutation carriers in cases or controls. The association of circulating 
plasma ANGPTL3 concentration with MI was determined using multivariable logistic 
regression after stratification of the population into tertiles of ANGPTL3 concentration. 
Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 software (The R Project for 
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
From the original kindred used to map this gene as a cause of familial combined 
hypolipidemia (1), we studied 3 individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency due to 
compound heterozygous LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 and 3 matched first-degree relatives 
without an LOF ANGPTL3 mutation. As shown in Online Table 1, participants with 
complete ANGPTL3 deficiency continued to exhibit very low plasma lipid concentrations 
nearly 20 years after the initial report. An updated medical history was obtained. One 
participant with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency reported a history of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, and past tobacco use. Other characteristics and laboratory values are 
listed in Online Table 1. We performed CCTA in all 6 individuals. The coronary calcium 
score was 0 Agatston units (AU) for all participants with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency 
(Figure 1A). By contrast, 2 of the 3 matched controls had positive coronary calcium scores 
(6 AU for individual II-8 and 610 AU for individual II-7) (Figure 1B).
We next calculated total plaque burden (a combination of both calcified and noncalcified 
plaque) for each participant. The total plaque burden was lower in the participants with 
complete ANGPTL3 deficiency (mean = 0%) compared to controls (mean = 39%) (Figure 
1C, Online Table 1, and Online Figure 2). The small number of phenotyped individuals 
precluded robust statistical comparisons between groups.
ASCERTAINMENT OF ANGPTL3 LOF MUTATIONS
We next sought to characterize the clinical effects of ANGPTL3 LOF mutations in the 
population. Sequence data for ANGPTL3 were available in 13,914 individuals with CAD 
and 26,198 controls free of CAD. From these data, 21 LOF variants were identified, 
including 7 variants leading to premature stop codons, 2 variants predicted to disrupt 
splicing, and 12 frameshift indels (Online Table 2). Eleven rare missense variants underwent 
functional validation in a mouse model, of which 2 – p.Asp42Asn and p.Thr383Ser – were 
additionally included as validated LOF variants (Figure 2).
In aggregate across all sequencing studies, an ANGPTL3 LOF mutation was identified in 
130 of 40,112 participants (0.32%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27% to 0.39%). One 
homozygote was identified with a Gln192ArgfsTer5 frameshift mutation – a 56-year-old 
woman of African ancestry free of clinical CAD with LDL cholesterol of 112 mg/dl, HDL 
cholesterol of 44 mg/dl, and TGs of 56 mg/dl.
Among sequenced individuals of European ancestry, the most frequently observed 
inactivating variant was the intronic splice region variant rs372257803 (minor allele 
frequency = 0.17%). This variant was imputed in an additional 8,066 CAD cases and

 140,068 controls, identifying an additional 68 heterozygous carriers of an ANGPTL3 LOF 
mutation.
ASSOCIATION OF ANGPTL3 LOF MUTATIONS WITH CIRCULATING LIPID LEVELS AND 
CAD RISK
Plasma lipid levels were available in up to 20,092 individuals of the Myocardial Infarction 
Genetics Consortium studies, including 60 heterozygous carriers of an ANGPTL3 LOF 
mutation. We found that individuals carrying an LOF ANGPTL3 mutation, when compared 
with noncarriers, had 11% lower total cholesterol (p = 0.0008), 12% lower LDL cholesterol 
(p = 0.04), and 17% lower TGs (p = 0.01) (Table 1). HDL cholesterol was not significantly 
different between the groups (p = 0.17).
A cohort-based meta-analysis stratified by ancestry was performed to determine the 
relationship between LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 and risk of CAD (Figure 3 and Online 
Table 2). We observed a 34% reduced risk of CAD among carriers of an ANGPTL3 LOF 
mutation as compared to noncarriers (odds ratio [OR] of disease for carriers = 0.66; 95% CI: 
0.44 to 0.98; p = 0.04). This effect estimate was similar in a sensitivity analysis restricted to 
individuals in whom complete gene sequencing (as opposed to rs372257803 imputation) 
was performed (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.06; p = 0.09).
CIRCULATING PLASMA ANGPTL3 AND RISK OF MI
Protection from CAD among carriers of a rare, LOF mutation in ANGPTL3 led to the 
hypothesis that individuals with lower levels of circulating ANGPTL3 protein might 
similarly have reduced coronary risk. Plasma ANGPTL3 concentrations were measured in 
1,493 cases presenting with a first-ever MI and 3,231 controls free of CAD from the 
PROMIS study. Consistent with our expectations, individuals in the lowest tertile of 
ANGPTL3 concentrations had significantly reduced risk of MI compared to those in the 
highest tertile (adjusted OR: 0.65; p = 2.2 x 10−7) (Table 2). This finding was modestly 
attenuated after additional adjustment for observed plasma LDL cholesterol and TGs 
(adjusted OR: 0.71; p = 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
We provided multiple lines of evidence suggesting that ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated 
with protection from CAD (Central Illustration). Detailed atherosclerotic phenotyping 
demonstrated an absence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in individuals with complete 
ANGPTL3 deficiency. Genomic analysis of ANGPTL3 LOF variants, including functionally 
validated missense variants in up to 180,180 individuals, showed a 34% reduction in risk of 
CAD among heterozygous carriers. Finally, circulating ANGPTL3 concentrations were 
lower in healthy controls as compared to those presenting with MI.
These results permitted several conclusions. First, identifying families with extreme 
phenotypes of interest could facilitate both gene discovery as well as hypothesis-based 
phenotyping. Multiple independent groups have confirmed the impact of inactivating 
mutations in ANGPTL3 on decreasing lipid levels using family-based study designs (31–
34). Here, we extended these observations by demonstrating that individuals with complete

 deficiency due to 2 inactivating mutations in the gene – effectively ‘human knockouts’ for 
ANGPTL3 – tended to have less coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by CCTA. This 
apparent protection from coronary atherosclerosis extended to a middle-aged participant 
(Online Table 1, individual II-1) with significant cardiovascular risk factors of type 2 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cigarette smoking. Although suggestive, 
these results were based on a small number of family members. Large-scale gene sequencing 
in the population as presented here was used to confirm this observation.
Additionally, these findings lent support to ongoing drug development efforts focused on 
ANGPTL3 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Beyond a significant reduction in plasma 
LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, heterozygous ANGPTL3 LOF mutation 
carriers had a 34% decreased risk of CAD. Similar results were noted in a preliminary report 
from Dewey and colleagues (35). We also found that individuals with circulating plasma 
ANGPTL3 concentrations in the lowest tertile of the population (in a sense, mimicking the 
effect of pharmacological inhibition of ANGPTL3) had a 35% reduced risk of MI. This 
study adds ANGPTL3 to the list of therapeutic targets for coronary disease, which includes 
ANGPTL4 (16,36), APOC3 (11,37), LPA (38), NPC1L1 (30), and PCSK9 (39), that have 
been validated by finding LOF mutations that associate with protection from disease, 
highlighting the promise and potential of human genetic studies in identifying such targets 
(40).
Furthermore, these data added to a growing body of human genetics evidence linking 
regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity – the major mechanism by which circulating 
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are hydrolyzed – with atherosclerosis. Studies in both mice and 
humans have demonstrated ANGPTL3 to be a potent inhibitor of LPL, particularly in the 
post-prandial state (41). Consistent with effects of rare mutations in 3 additional endogenous 
regulators of LPL, APOA5 (10), APOC3 (11,37), and ANGPTL4 (16,36), loss of ANGPTL3 
function appears to result in gain of LPL activity, reduced triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and 
protection from coronary disease. Beyond effects on TGs and LDL cholesterol, ANGPTL3 
might affect glucose homeostasis as well as remodeling of HDL cholesterol particles by EL 
(4,42). The relative contributions of each of these mechanisms, as they relate to risk of CAD, 
warrant additional investigation.
Finally, we provided proof-of-concept for rare ANGPTL3 missense variant prioritization 
using a combination of bioinformatics tools and experimental characterization in vivo. Any 
given ANGPTL3 missense variant might perturb protein function via numerous potential 
mechanisms, including decreased expression, impaired hepatic secretion, or inability to bind 
and inhibit LPL. We developed an Angptl3 knockout mouse that exhibited a phenotype of 
very low triglycerides. We attempted to rescue this phenotype using adenoviral vectors 
producing either wild-type ANGPTL3 or a protein including the missense variant of interest. 
This proved useful in determining that only 2 of 11 screened missense variants led to near 
complete loss of ANGPTL3 protein function (i.e., <25% of wild-type activity). The ability 
to confidently annotate the functional consequences of rare missense variants in a gene of 
interest remains one of the biggest hurdles to rare variant gene discovery efforts (43). We 
present one approach to address this challenge.

 STUDY LIMITATIONS
Important limitations to the present study should be recognized. First, CCTA was performed 
in only a subset of the original family used to identify ANGPTL3 as the cause of familial 
combined hypolipidemia. Second, the functional characterization of missense variants was 
performed in only 11 variants and alternative thresholds for defining LOF are possible. 
Third, genotype imputation was used to identify carriers of an ANGPTL3 splice-site 
imputation in some cohorts. However, a sensitivity analysis restricted to those studies in 
which complete sequencing of ANGPTL3 yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS
Deep phenotyping in a family, gene sequencing in the population, and biomarker analysis in 
cases and controls showed ANGPTL3 deficiency to be associated with a reduced risk of 
CAD. Whether pharmacological inhibition of ANGPTL3 function will prove useful in the 
treatment or prevention of CAD remains to be determined.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Hereditary combined hypolipidemia is caused by mutations that inactivate the gene 
angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) and is characterized by low blood levels of all 3 major 
lipid fractions. Individuals with a loss-of-function ANGPTL3 mutation have reduced 
odds of CAD, suggesting that ANGPTL3 deficiency protects against CAD.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Interventions targeting ANGPTL3 should be considered for potential clinical application.

 FIGURE 2. Mouse Model to Functionally Annotate ANGPTL3 Missense Variants
(A) This schematic illustrates the design of the mouse study and circulating triglyceride 
(TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels of wild-type (WT) and Angptl3 knockout (KO) mice 
generated with CRISPR-Cas9, before and after treatment with adenovirus (AdV) expressing 
WT human ANGPTL3 (11 WT mice, 18 KO mice). (B) The effects of mutant ANGPTL3 
alleles expressed from AdV in KO mice (5 to 6 in each group) on TG levels are shown as 
percentages of the effect of AdV expressing the WT ANGPTL3 allele on TG. Mutant 
ANGPTL3 alleles that had <25% of the WT allele effect on TG levels were annotated as 
loss-of-function alleles. (For additional details, including TC levels of mice before and after 
AdV injection, see Online Figure 3.) Abbreviations as in Figure 1.

 FIGURE 3. Association of ANGPTL3 Loss-of-Function Mutations with Risk of CAD
The association of ANGPTL3 mutations with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) was 
determined via meta-analysis utilizing Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel statistics for ethnicity-
specific stratified 2-by-2 tables. A reduced risk of CAD was noted among carriers of an 
ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variant (odds ratio of disease for carriers: 0.66; 95% confidence

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION. ANGPTL3 Deficiency and Protection From Coronary Artery 
Disease
Multiple lines of evidence suggesting that angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) deficiency is 
associated with protection from coronary artery disease (CAD). (A) A genotype-guided 
callback study of human “knockouts” for ANGPTL3, which used detailed atherosclerotic 
phenotyping, demonstrated an absence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in individuals with 
complete ANGPTL3 deficiency. (B) Genomic analysis of ANGPTL3 loss-of-function 
variants, including missense variants that were experimentally found to disrupt ANGPTL3 
function, found in up to 180,180 individuals showed a 34% reduction in risk of CAD among 
loss-of-function variant carriers. (C) Circulating ANGPTL3 protein concentrations were 
lower in healthy controls as compared to those presenting with a myocardial infarction.
