 IMPORTANCE—Patients with breast cancer (BrCa) brain metastases (BrM) have limited 
therapeutic options. A better understanding of molecular alterations acquired in BrM could 
identify clinically actionable metastatic dependencies.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether there are intrinsic subtype differences between primary 
tumors and matched BrM and to uncover BrM-acquired alterations that are clinically actionable.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICPANTS—In total, 20 cases of primary breast cancer tissue 
and resected BrM (10 estrogen receptor [ER]-negative and 10 ER-positive) from 2 academic 
institutions were included. Eligible cases in the discovery cohort harbored patient-matched 
primary breast cancer tissue and resected BrM. Given the rarity of patient-matched samples, no 
exclusion criteria were enacted. Two validation sequencing cohorts were used—a published data 
set of 17 patient-matched cases of BrM and a cohort of 7884 BrCa tumors enriched for metastatic 
samples.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Brain metastases expression changes in 127 genes 
within BrCa signatures, PAM50 assignments, and ERBB2/HER2 DNA-level gains.
RESULTS—Overall, 17 of 20 BrM retained the PAM50 subtype of the primary BrCa. Despite 
this concordance, 17 of 20 BrM harbored expression changes (<2-fold or >2-fold) in clinically 
actionable genes including gains of FGFR4 (n = 6 [30%]), FLT1 (n = 4 [20%]), AURKA (n = 2 
[10%]) and loss of ESR1 expression (n = 9 [45%]). The most recurrent expression gain was 
ERBB2/HER2, which showed a greater than 2-fold expression increase in 7 of 20 BrM (35%). 
Three of these 7 cases were ERBB2/HER2-negative out of 13 ERBB2/HER2-negative in the 
primary BrCa cohort and became immunohistochemical positive (3+) in the paired BrM with 
metastasis-specific amplification of the ERBB2/HER2 locus. In an independent data set, 2 of 9 
(22.2%) ERBB2/HER2-negative BrCa switched to ERBB2/HER2-positive with 1 BrM acquiring 
ERBB2/HER2 amplification and the other showing metastatic enrichment of the activating V777L 
ERBB2/HER2 mutation. An expanded cohort revealed that ERBB2/HER2 amplification and/or 
mutation frequency was unchanged between local disease and metastases across all sites; however, 
a significant enrichment was appreciated for BrM (13% local vs 24% BrM; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Breast cancer BrM commonly acquire alterations in 
clinically actionable genes, with metastasis-acquired ERBB2/HER2 alterations in approximately 
20% of ERBB2/HER2-negative cases. These observations have immediate clinical implications 
for patients with ERBB2/HER2–negative breast cancer and support comprehensive profiling of 
metastases to inform clinical care.

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases (BrM) occur in 10% to 15% of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
(BrCa) and present a major clinical challenge, highlighted by a poor 8.5-month median 
overall survival.1 Limited therapeutic options exist for patients with BrM and current 
management consists of surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. ERBB2/

 HER2-positive BrM have demonstrated encouraging responses to ERBB2/HER2-targeted 
therapies in recent clinical trials.2 Unfortunately, in patients with ERBB2/HER2-negative 
BrM, no targeted therapies have shown even modest benefits.3
In this study, we performed targeted expression profiling on a molecularly diverse cohort of 
20 primary breast tumors and their patient-matched BrM to determine transcriptional 
differences between primary cancers and BrM and to define metastasis-acquired alterations 
that may be clinically actionable.
METHODS
Eligible BrCa cases harbored paired formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from primary 
BrCa and resected BrM (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Two independent data sets reinforced 
findings—17 patient-matched BrCa cases of whole-exome sequencing data4 and targeted 
sequencing from 7884 BrCa tumors enriched for metastases. This study was approved by the 
institutional review boards of both participating institutions.
NanoString expression counts for target genes were generated from tumor RNA extracts. 
Hierarchical clusters, PAM50/Oncotype DX assignments,5 and fold-change expression 
values between patient-matched tumors (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) were called using 
normalized expression counts.
Standard clinical ERBB2/HER2 and estrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
analyses were performed. DNA from case Pitt_62 was extracted and analyzed for ERBB2 
gains using a single-nucleotide polymorphism–based microarray. Metastasis-specific 
ERBB2/HER2 copy number alteration and single-nucleotide variation (SNV) gains in 
whole-exome sequencing were interrogated with CNVkit and GATK.6,7 To test for site-
specific enrichment of ERBB2/HER2 amplifications and SNVs in metastases, we analyzed 
FoundationOne (Foundation Medicine) targeted sequencing data.
More detailed methods can be found in Supplement 1, and more detailed results, including 
unprocessed raw count data, can be found in Supplement 2.
RESULTS
To determine the transcriptional similarity between primary tumors and patient-matched 
BrM, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on normalized gene expression 
values. This produced 3 major clades broadly classified as ER-positive, ERBB2/HER2-
positive, and ER-negative (Figure 1A). Overall, 12 of 20 (65%) patient-matched pairs 
clustered within a single doublet clade. PAM50 assignments were concordant in 17 of 20 
pairs (Figure 1B). OncotypeDX (Genomic Health) scores were also largely unchanged 
between primary and metastatic tumors, retaining their clinical risk score in 15 of 20 cases 
(eTable 2 in Supplement 1)
Despite a large degree of similarity between patient-matched pairs, 100 genes were 
recurrently altered (eFigure 2A in Supplement 1); 55 genes harbored 2-fold expression gains 
and/or losses in at least 25% of cases (Figure 2A). The most recurrently down-regulated

 genes were cytokeratins—KRT17 in 14 of 20 pairs, KRT5 and KRT14 in 15 pairs (eFigure 
2B in Supplement 1). The most recurrently up-regulated genes were RAB6B and GRB7 
(eFigure 2B in Supplement 1).
Ten genes in the panel are defined as clinically actionable,8 and all but 3 cases had at least 1 
gene with a BrM-specific change (Figure 2B). ERBB2/HER2 was the most recurrent 
alteration showing at least a 2-fold expression increase in 35% of BrM. Notably, 3 cases 
were classified as ERBB2/HER2-negative in the primary tumor. FGFR4 showed increased 
expression in 30% of BrM, with 3 cases showing a greater than 4-fold increase. Other 
recurrent gains included FLT1, AURKA, and EGFR. The most recurrently down-regulated 
gene was ESR1, showing a 2-fold expression decrease in 4 samples and a greater than 4-fold 
decrease in 5 samples. Two samples with the greatest fold-change in ESR1 switched 
expression from ER-positive to ER-negative levels, with 1 case showing substantial protein 
level changes (eFigure 3A and B in Supplement 1).
ERBB2/HER2 IHC was performed in 3 ERBB2/HER2-negative samples with the greatest 
mRNA gains in ERBB2/HER2 (Figure 3A). All 3 tumors showed clinical ERBB2/HER2-
status switching via IHC scores—RCS_4 and RCS_6; 1+ in primary, 3+ in BrM (data not 
shown), Pitt_62; 0 in primary, 3+ in BrM (eFigure 4A in Supplement 1). Single-nucleotide 
polymorphism array copy number alteration analysis revealed that ERBB2/HER2 status 
switching is driven by canonical amplification of the ERBB2/HER2 locus (eFigure 4B in 
Supplement 1).
Given that 3 of 13 ERBB2/HER2-negative tumors showed ERBB2/HER2 gains, we then 
examined ERBB2/HER2 amplification and SNVs in an independent whole-exome 
sequencing cohort (n = 17; 9 ERBB2/HER2-negative and 8 ERBB2/HER2-positive) of 
patient-matched cases (dbGaP phs000730.v1.p).9 One ERBB2/HER2-negative case 
(Broad_PB0150) showed a metastasis-specific copy number gain in ERBB2/HER2, which 
was consistent with the case switching to ERBB2/HER2-positive clinically in the BrM 
(eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Another case (Broad_PB0049) switched from ERBB2/HER2-
negative to ERBB2/HER2-positive clinically, but no metastasis-specific copy number 
alteration gain was appreciated within ERBB2/HER2; however, an enrichment—from an 
allele frequency of 39% to 69%—of a somatic V777L activating mutation in the metastasis 
was identified (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1).
To generalize these observations and test whether ERBB2/HER2 gains are enriched in BrM, 
we analyzed a cohort of 7884 breast cancers (7265 with unambiguous tissue site 
information) representing 3135 cases of local disease and 4130 cases of metastases for 
amplifications and/or SNV in ERBB2/HER2. Comparing all local and metastatic tumors 
from all sites (Figure 3B) showed no significant difference; however, there was a strong and 
significant enrichment of ERBB2/HER2 alterations specifically in brain metastases (24%) 
compared with local disease (13%) (Fisher exact P < .001) (Figure 3B)

 DISCUSSION
The brain is a common and catastrophic site of metastasis for patients with breast cancer and 
an understanding of metastasis-acquired alterations is limited. In this study, we found that 
patient-matched primary BrCa and BrM have similar intrinsic subtypes; however, when 
examining on a gene level, clinically actionable alterations were identified in all but 3 pairs.
The most recurrent gain in BrM was ERBB2/HER2, which showed expression increases in 7 
of 20 (35%) of BrM and changes from ERBB2/HER2-negative to ERBB2/HER2-positive 
levels. Duchnowska et al10 and Thomson et al11 reported ERBB2/HER2-negative to 
ERBB2/HER2-positive switching frequencies of 16% and 18% respectively in BrM via IHC. 
Gutierrez et al12 reported an ERBB2/HER2-switching frequency of 11% in tamoxifen-
resistant tumors, and notably, 6 of 7 cases with ERBB2/HER2 expression gains were ER-
positive.12 Our analysis of ERBB2/HER2-switching samples reinforces these observations 
and shows expression gains are partially driven by classical amplification of the ERBB2 
locus. Interestingly, the ERBB2/HER2-switching Broad_PB0049 case showed no copy 
number gains specific to the BrM, yet harbored an enrichment of the activating V777L 
ERBB2/HER2 mutation,13 suggesting another DNA-level mechanism of ERBB2/HER2 gain 
in BrM.
Novel recurrent targetable alterations beyond ERBB2/HER2 were also discovered, including 
expression increases in FGFR4 (30% of pairs), FLT2 (20%), AURKA (10%) and EGFR 
(10%). Each one of these targets have clinical trials ongoing and our results suggest that trial 
eligibility requiring expression of these markers (NCT02325739) should assess metastatic 
tumors if available, especially given greater than 4-fold mRNA expression gains over 
primary tumors in patient-matched metastases. A limitation of this study, however, is the 
small number of patient-matched pairs.
Significant loss of gene expression from the primary to metastatic lesions was also observed. 
The most recurrent expression losses involved cytokeratins. Cytokeratins have shown a 
complex role in oncogenesis and breast cancer metastasis, with loss of cytokeratin 
expression being a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.14,15 
Intermediate steps of metastasis—such as processes taking place within circulating tumor 
cells—may be masked in our paired analyses. The most recurrently lost clinically actionable 
gene was ESR1. Importantly, loss of ER expression is an established mediator of therapy 
resistance.16
CONCLUSIONS
Breast cancer BrM are remarkably similar transcriptionally to patient-matched primary 
tumors; yet, recurrent expression changes in clinically actionable genes are common. Given 
this evolution, metastasis-acquired features should inform targeted therapy selection and trial 
eligibilities in advanced cancer settings. Furthermore, approximately 20% of ERBB2/HER2-
negative patients with BrCa show copy number alteration and/or SNV gains in ERBB2/
HER2 across multiple cohorts, which warrants immediate clinical attention as many of these 
patients will not be provided ERBB2/HER2-targeted therapies.

 KEY POINTS
Question
Do brain metastases gain clinically actionable molecular alterations when compared with 
patient-matched primary breast cancers?
Findings
Overall, 17 of 20 brain metastases in this study retained the PAM50 subtype of the 
primary tumor; yet, clinically actionable gains are common, with approximately 20% of 
ERBB2/HER2-negative primary tumors switching to ERBB2/HER2-positive.
Meaning
Breast cancer brain metastases commonly acquire alterations in clinically actionable 
genes, which has immediate clinical implications and supports comprehensive profiling 
of metastases to inform clinical care.
