Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, 
hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with 
post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
WOMAN Trial Collaborators*
Summary
Background Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Early administration of 
tranexamic acid reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to assess the effects of early administration 
of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage.
Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women aged 16 years and older with a 
clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage after a vaginal birth or caesarean section from 193 hospitals in 21 countries. 
We randomly assigned women to receive either 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo in addition to usual 
care. If bleeding continued after 30 min, or stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a second dose of 1 g of 
tranexamic acid or placebo could be given. Patients were assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack from a box 
containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those 
assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. We originally planned to enrol 15 000 women with a composite primary 
endpoint of death from all-causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth. However, during the trial it became 
apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although 
tranexamic acid could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. We therefore 
increased the sample size from 15 000 to 20 000 women in order to estimate the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of 
death from post-partum haemorrhage. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with 
ISRCTN76912190 (Dec 8, 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00872469; and PACTR201007000192283.
Findings Between March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20 060 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 
tranexamic acid (n=10 051) or placebo (n=10 009), of whom 10 036 and 9985, respectively, were included in the analysis. 
Death due to bleeding was significantly reduced in women given tranexamic acid (155 [1·5%] of 10 036 patients vs 191 
[1·9%] of 9985 in the placebo group, risk ratio [RR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·65–1·00; p=0·045), especially in women given 
treatment within 3 h of giving birth (89 [1·2%] in the tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1·7%] in the placebo group, 
RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·52–0·91; p=0·008). All other causes of death did not differ significantly by group. Hysterectomy 
was not reduced with tranexamic acid (358 [3·6%] patients in the tranexamic acid group vs 351 [3·5%] in the placebo 
group, RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·88–1·07; p=0·84). The composite primary endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy 
was not reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5·3%] deaths or hysterectomies in the tranexamic acid group vs 546 [5·5%] 
in the placebo group, RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·87-1·09; p=0·65). Adverse events (including thromboembolic events) did 
not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid versus placebo group.
Interpretation Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no 
adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as 
possible after bleeding onset.

Introduction
Primary post-partum haemorrhage, usually defined as a 
blood loss of more than 500 mL within 24 h of giving 
birth, is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide, 
responsible for about 100 000 deaths every year.1–3 Most of 
the deaths occur soon after giving birth and almost 
all (99%) occur in low-income and middle-income 
countries.4,5
Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the 
enzymatic breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin by 
plasmin.6 Findings of a systematic review of clinical trials 
of tranexamic acid in surgery showed that the drug

reduces blood loss by about one third.7,8 Tranexamic acid 
reduces death due to bleeding in patients with trauma. 
The CRASH-2 trial,9 which recruited 20 211 adults with 
acute traumatic bleeding, showed that tranexamic acid 
reduced death due to bleeding, with no apparent increase 
in vascular occlusive events. Planned subgroup analysis 
of the effect of tranexamic acid by time from injury to the 
start of treatment showed that early treatment is 
essential. In patients given treatment within 3 h of injury, 
tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding by nearly 
one third. However, when given after 3 h, there was no 
benefit.10 Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after 
trauma and is associated with increased mortality.11 
Trauma triggers the release of tissue plasminogen 
activator, the enzyme that converts plasminogen to the 
fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin.12,13
Early activation of fibrinolysis is also recorded after 
childbirth. Within 1 h of giving birth, the serum 
concentration of tissue plasminogen activator doubles, 
possibly because of tissue damage during childbirth;14 
thereafter, the concentration falls.14 On the basis of 
results of clinical trials in surgery and trauma, 
tranexamic acid is recommended for the treatment of 
primary post-partum haemorrhage if uterotonics fail to 
control the bleeding or if the bleeding is thought to be 
due to trauma.1 However, further trials of tranexamic 
acid in primary post-partum haemorrhage are needed.1 
Here we aimed to address this research gap and assess 
the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on 
death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in 
women with post-partum haemorrhage.
Methods
Study design and participants
The WOMAN (World Maternal Antifibrinolytic) trial is 
an international, randomised, double-blind placebo-
controlled trial of women aged 16 years and older with a 
clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage after a 
vaginal birth or caesarean section done in 193 hospitals 
in 21 countries. Although the diagnosis was clinical, we 
specified that diagnosis of primary post-partum 
haemorrhage could be based on clinically estimated 
blood loss of more than 500 mL after vaginal birth or 
1000 mL after caesarean section or any blood loss 
sufficient to compromise haemodynamic stability. The 
fundamental eligibility criterion was the clinician’s 
uncertainty about whether to use tranexamic acid in a 
particular woman with post-partum haemorrhage. 
Patients received all usual care but were also randomly 
allocated to receive tranexamic acid or placebo.
The trial was done in accordance with the good clinical 
practice guidelines by the International Conference on 
Harmonisation.15 The consent procedures are described 
in detail in the protocol.16 The procedure at each site was 
approved by the relevant ethics committee and regulatory 
agencies. In summary, consent was obtained from 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the WOMAN trial, there was evidence that 
antifibrinolytics reduced surgical blood loss and re-operation to 
control bleeding. To assess the effects of anti-fibrinolytics in 
post-partum haemorrhage, we did a systematic review of 
randomised trials published in any language. We searched the 
following databases up to November, 2008: MEDLINE, 
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, 
Web of Science, metaRegister of controlled trials, LILACS, 
Reproductive Health Library, African Health-line, POPLINE, 
MedCarib, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the reference lists of 
eligible trials. Search terms have been published previously 
(Ferrer P, 2009). We found no trials of antifibrinolytics in post-
partum haemorrhage. In 2010, while the WOMAN trial was 
underway, findings of an international multicentre randomised 
trial of 20 211 bleeding trauma patients (the CRASH-2 trial) 
showed that tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding 
with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive events. 
Subgroup analyses showed that tranexamic acid was only 
effective when given within 3 h of injury. In 2012, WHO 
guidelines recommended that tranexamic acid should be used 
for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage when 
uterotonics fail to control the bleeding or when the bleeding is 
thought to be due to trauma. The evidence for this 
recommendation was extrapolated from trials in surgery and 
trauma showing that tranexamic acid was a safe option for the 
treatment of trauma-related bleeding.
Added value of this study
The WOMAN trial results show that the effect of tranexamic 
acid in post-partum haemorrhage is consistent with the effects 
recorded in surgery and trauma. There was a significant 
reduction in death due to bleeding and laparotomy to control 
bleeding with tranexamic acid and no evidence of any increased 
risk of thromboembolic events. With regards to time to 
treatment, when set in the context of results from trauma, early 
treatment also seems to be more effective. There is no evidence 
that the effect of tranexamic acid varies by cause of bleeding or 
type of birth. Tranexamic acid did not prevent hysterectomy 
possibly because this is done so soon after the onset of primary 
post-partum haemorrhage that there is little time for 
tranexamic acid to have an effect.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results support the inclusion of tranexamic acid in WHO 
treatment guidelines for primary post-partum haemorrhage 
but suggest that treatment should be given as soon as possible 
after onset. Future research should assess the bioavailability of 
tranexamic acid after alternative (non-intravenous) routes of 
administration because this might facilitate its use in primary 
health-care settings.

women if their physical and mental capacity allowed (as 
judged by the treating clinician). If a woman was unable 
to give consent, proxy consent was obtained from a 
relative or representative. If a proxy was unavailable, then 
if permitted by local regulation, consent was deferred or 
waived. When consent was deferred or given by a proxy, 
the woman was informed about the trial as soon as 
possible, and consent was obtained for ongoing data 
collection, if needed.
Randomisation and masking
After eligibility was confirmed and consent procedures 
completed, baseline information was collected on the 
entry form. Patients were then randomly allocated to 
receive tranexamic acid or placebo by selection of the 
lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing 
eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the 
pack number. The randomisation codes were generated 
and held by an independent statistical consultant from 
Sealed Envelope Ltd (UK). The codes were given to the 
drug packers so that treatment packs could be prepared 
in accordance with the randomisation list. Once the 
treatment pack was opened and the ampoules were 
confirmed as intact, the patient was considered to be 
randomly assigned. After randomisation, outcome data 
were obtained for every participant even if the treatment 
was not given. Participants, caregivers, and study staff
 
(site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) 
were masked to treatment allocation. An emergency un-
blinding service was available via Sealed Envelope Ltd.
The tranexamic acid (cyklokapron injection) used in 
the trial was manufactured by Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, UK. 
The matching placebo (sodium chloride 0·9%) was 
prepared by South Devon Healthcare NHS Trust, Devon, 
UK. Ampoules and packaging were identical in 
appearance. The masking was done by Brecon 
Pharmaceuticals Limited, Hereford, UK and involved the 
removal of the original manufacturer’s label and 
replacement with the clinical trial label bearing the 
randomisation number, which was used as the pack 
identification. Apart from the randomisation number, all 
pack label texts were identical for tranexamic acid and 
placebo. Correct masking and coding of ampoules was 
checked by independent random testing of each batch by 
high-performance liquid chromatography to confirm the 
contents of the ampoules.
Procedures
Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 g tranexamic 
acid 
or 
placebo 
by 
slow 
intravenous 
injection. 
Investigators were advised to give 1 g (100 mg/mL) of 
tranexamic acid intravenously at an approximate rate of 
1 mL per min. If bleeding continued after 30 min or 
stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a 
second dose of 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo could be 
given. Every patient was assigned a uniquely numbered 
treatment pack, containing four ampoules of 500 mg 
tranexamic acid or placebo, two syringes and needles, 
stickers with the trial details and randomisation number 
(for attaching to data forms and medical records) and 
instructions. Every box had information leaflets for 
participants and their representatives, consent forms, and 
data collection forms. The stickers, instructions, leaflets, 
and forms were translated into local languages. Outcome 
data were collected at death, discharge or 6 weeks (42 days) 
after randomisation (whichever occurred first). Adverse 
events were reported up to day 42.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death from all 
causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of randomisation. 
Death was also assessed separately. Participating clinicians 
were requested to record the immediate cause of death 
(the final pathophysiological process leading to death) 
rather than the underlying cause of death and were trained 
accordingly. In the event that there was more than one 
cause, clinicians were asked to record the main cause. 
Because there was no reason to believe that tranexamic 
acid can reduce deaths from causes unrelated to bleeding, 
we planned to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on 
cause-specific mortality with death due to bleeding as the 
key secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes 
were thromboembolic events (deep-vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke), 
surgical interventions (intrauterine tamponade, emboli-
sation, brace sutures, arterial ligation, hysterectomy, and 
laparotomies done after randomisation to control bleeding 
and achieve haemostasis), complications (renal failure, 
cardiac failure, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, sepsis, 
and seizures), other untoward medical events (adverse 
events), quality of life measured using the EQ5D and 
status of any thromboembolic events in breastfed babies 
(assessed as per normal clinical practice with no special 
tests done). Outcomes were measured at hospital 
discharge or on day 42 if still in hospital. Data were sent to 
the trial coordinating centre by direct entry into an 
electronic database or by using encrypted data forms 
(which were sent by fax, email, or uploaded to a secure 
server). We monitored data quality using a combination of 
centralised consent monitoring, statistical data checking, 
and site visits at which patient data forms were compared 
with clinical case notes.
Statistical analysis
We published a statistical analysis plan before the 
allocation was unblinded.18 This plan included details of a 
protocol amendment to increase the sample size. Before 
the trial started, we anticipated a baseline event rate 
of 2·5% for death and 2·5% for hysterectomy. Assuming 
a control group event rate of 2·5% for death and 2·5% for 
hysterectomy and that 1% of women die after hysterectomy, 
we originally estimated that a trial with 15 000 women 
would have 90% power to detect a 25% reduction 
(from 4–3%) in the composite primary endpoint death or

hysterectomy at the 5% significance level. However, 
during the trial it became apparent that the decision to 
conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time 
as randomisation. For example, in response to life-
threatening bleeding during caesarean section, a clinician 
might decide to do a hysterectomy, and while the 
hysterectomy is underway, the woman is enrolled into the 
trial. Although tranexamic acid could affect the risk of 
death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of 
hysterectomy. To protect against the possibility that the 
effect of tranexamic acid on death and hysterectomy was 
different, the sample size was increased from 15 000 to 
20 000 women. We estimated that a trial with 20 000 women 
should have sufficient power to detect a 25% reduction in 
mortality at the 5% significance level (3–2·25%). We 
hoped that the increased sample size might compensate 
for the dilution of the treatment effect from hysterectomies 
that were done at the same time as randomisation. We 
also refined the study hypothesis in view of new evidence 
that had become available since the trial was initiated. In 
particular, findings of the CRASH-2 trial10 had shown that 
tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in trauma 
patients and that early treatment was more effective, with 
strong evidence of an interaction by time to treatment. In 
response, we pre-specified an analysis of cause-specific 
mortality with death due to bleeding as the main outcome. 
We also pre-specified subgroup analyses by time to 
treatment. These changes were made before un-blinding 
and without any knowledge of the trial results.
All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. 
For each binary outcome, we calculated risk ratios and 
95% CIs and two-sided p values. We did a complete case 
analysis with no imputation for missing data. To mitigate 
the risk that a chance imbalance in prognostic factors 
could affect the results, for the primary endpoint (death 
or hysterectomy) and the most important secondary 
endpoint (death due to bleeding), we pre-specified an 
analysis adjusted for baseline risk. The safety of trial 
participants was overseen by an independent data safety 
and monitoring committee, which reviewed seven un-
blinded interim analyses.

We planned to report the effects of treatment on the 
primary 
outcome 
subdivided 
by 
three 
baseline 
characteristics: hours from giving birth to randomisation 
(<1, 1–3, >3 h); type of birth (vaginal or caesarean section); 
and primary cause of haemorrhage (uterine atony vs all 
others). To examine the hypothesis that tranexamic acid 
would be most effective when given soon after birth and 
less effective (possibly even harmful) when given several 
hours after giving birth, we pre-specified a subgroup 
analysis of the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to 
bleeding according to the time interval between giving 
birth and tranexamic acid treatment. The main analysis for 
the pre-specified subgroups was an unadjusted test of 
interaction in a logistic regression model to assess evidence 
for whether the effect of treatment differs across subgroup 
categories. Unless there was strong evidence against the 
null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (ie, p<0·001), the 
overall relative risk was regarded as the most reliable guide 
to the approximate relative risks in all subgroups. However, 
because there was strong prior evidence to expect a time to 
treatment interaction, we pre-specified that we would set 
the results of this analysis in the context of all available 
data on the time to treatment interaction.18
After publication of the planned primary and secondary 
analyses, the trial data will be made available via our data 
sharing portal, The Free Bank of Injury and Emergency 
Research Data (freeBIRD) website. This will allow for 
maximum utilisation of the data to improve patient care 
and advance medical knowledge.

Results
Between March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20 060 women 
were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 
tranexamic acid (n=10 051) or placebo (n=10 009), of 
whom 20 002 (99·7%) received the first dose of the 
allocated treatment (10 037 received tranexamic acid and 
9975 received placebo; figure 1). Seven women withdrew 
their consent after randomisation and we excluded their 
data from the analyses (four in the tranexamic acid group 
and three in the placebo group). We were unable to 
obtain primary outcome data for 32 women and 
12 patients did not fulfil the trial eligibility criteria. One 
patient in the tranexamic acid group was randomly 
assigned twice. The primary analysis includes data for 
20 021 (99·8%) women. The baseline characteristics were 
similar between the treatment groups (table 1).
There were 483 maternal deaths of which 374 (77%) 
were within 24 h of randomisation and 43 (9%) were 
within 1 h of randomisation (figure 2). The appendix 
shows the distribution of deaths from hours since 
childbirth (appendix p 1). 346 (72%) deaths were due to 
bleeding. Table 2 shows the effect of tranexamic acid on 
maternal death. The risk of death due to bleeding was 
significantly 
reduced 
in 
patients 
who 
received 
tranexamic acid (155 [1·5%] of 10 036 vs 191 [1·9%] in 
the placebo group; risk ratio [RR] 0·81, 95% CI 
0·65–1·00; p=0·045). After adjusting for baseline risk, 
the risk ratio for death due to bleeding with tranexamic 
acid was 0·78 (95% CI 0·62–0·98; p=0·03). Deaths 
from pulmonary embolism, organ failure, sepsis, 
eclampsia and other causes did not differ significantly 
between the tranexamic acid and the placebo group 
(table 2). We recorded fewer deaths from all causes with 
tranexamic acid but the reduction was not significant

(227 [2·3%] in the tranexamic acid group vs 256 [2·6%] 
in the placebo group; RR 0·88, 95% CI 0·74–1·05; 
p=0·16).
In women given tranexamic acid within 3 h of giving 
birth, tranexamic acid substantially reduced the risk of 
death due to bleeding (89 [1·2%] women died in the 
tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1·7%] in the placebo group, 
RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·52–0·91; p=0·008). There was no 
apparent reduction when tranexamic acid was given after 
3 h (66 [2·6%] tranexamic acid group vs 63 [2·5%] placebo 
group, RR 1·07, 95% CI 0·76–1·51; p=0·70).There was 
no heterogeneity in the effect by type of birth or cause of 
bleeding (figure 3).
709 women had hysterectomies of which 608 (86%) 
were on the day of randomisation and 191 (27%) were 
within 1 h of randomisation (figure 2). The appendix 
shows the distribution of hysterectomy from hours since 
childbirth (appendix p 1). 578 (81%) of 709 hysterectomies 
were done to control bleeding. The risk of hysterectomy 
was not reduced with tranexamic acid (358 [3·6%] done in 
the tranexamic acid group vs 351 [3·5%] in the placebo 
group, RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·88–1·07; p=0·84). The risk of 
hysterectomy to control bleeding was not significantly 
reduced with tranexamic acid (283 [2·8%] tranexamic acid 
group vs 295 [3·0%] placebo group, RR 0·95, 95% CI 
0·81–1·12; p=0·57).
The primary endpoint of death from all causes or 
hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth occurred in 
1080 women. Of these, 371 (34%) women died without 
undergoing a hysterectomy, 112 (10%) died after 
hysterectomy, and 597 (55%) survived after hysterectomy. 
The risk of death from all causes or hysterectomy was not 
reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5·3%] tranexamic acid 
group vs 546 [5·6%] placebo group, RR 0·97, 95% CI 
0·87–1·09; p=0·65). After adjusting for baseline risk, the 
risk ratio for death from all causes or hysterectomy was 
0·98 (95% CI 0·87–1·10; p=0·75). There was no significant 
heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid by time to 
treatment, type of birth or cause of bleeding (table 3).
The use of intrauterine tamponade, embolisation, 
manual removal of the placenta, and arterial ligation did 
not differ significantly between the tranexamic acid and 
the placebo group (table 4). Brace sutures were used 
more often in the tranexamic group (300 [3·0%] 
tranexamic acid group vs 250 [2·5%] placebo group; 
RR 1·19, 95% CI 1·01–1·41; p=0·035). 209 laparotomies 
were done after randomisation to control bleeding and 
achieve haemostasis of which 114 (55%) followed 
caesarean section births and 95 (45%) followed vaginal

births. There was a significant reduction in laparotomy 
to control bleeding with tranexamic acid (82 [0·8%] 
tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1·3%] placebo group; 
RR 0·64, 95% CI 0·49-0·85; p=0·002). We recorded no 
significant heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid 
on laparotomy to control bleeding by time since giving 
birth, type of birth, or cause of bleeding (figure 4). Blood 
product transfusions were given to 5461 (54%) of 10 036 
patients allocated to tranexamic acid and 5426 (54%) of 
9985 women allocated to placebo. Among women who 
were transfused, the mean number of blood units 
received did not differ significantly between patients in 
the tranexamic acid and placebo groups. Of the women 
who died, 37 (7·7%) did not receive any blood products. 
Of these, 18 (48·7%) were in the tranexamic acid group 
and 19 (51·4%) were in the placebo group. 
The incidence of thromboembolic events (pulmonary 
embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial in-
farction, and stroke) did not differ significantly in the 
tranexamic acid versus the placebo group (table 5). The 
risk of organ failure (renal, cardiac, respiratory, and 
hepatic) and sepsis did not differ significantly between 
the tranexamic acid and the placebo group. 33 (0·33%) 
women in the tranexamic acid group had a seizure 
versus 43 (0·43%) in the placebo group. Eight women 
in the tranexamic acid group suffered the death of a 
breast-fed baby compared with seven women in the 
placebo group. No thromboembolic events were 
reported in breast-fed babies in either group. Of 
women who survived, there were no significant 
differences in quality of life measures. Of the women 
who survived, four (<1%) did not have a quality of life

Discussion
The administration of tranexamic acid to women with 
post-partum haemorrhage reduces deaths due to 
bleeding and laparotomy to control bleeding with no 
evidence of any adverse effects or complications. When 
given soon after delivery, tranexamic acid reduces death 
due to bleeding by nearly one third. 
Our study had several strengths but also some 
limitations. The randomisation method ensured that 
participating doctors had no foreknowledge of the 
treatment allocation. Baseline prognostic factors were 
well balanced and results adjusted for baseline risk were 
similar to the unadjusted analyses. Because almost all 
randomly assigned patients were followed up there is 
little potential for bias. We originally planned to enrol 
15 000 women to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on 
a composite primary endpoint of death from all-causes 
or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth. However, 
during the trial it became apparent that the decision to 
conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same 
time as the decision to enrol a women into the trial. 
Although we excluded hysterectomies done before 
randomisation, we could not exclude those in which the 
decision to conduct a hysterectomy was made at the 
same time as the decision to randomise or before the 
trial treatment had been received. We predicted that this 
would dilute the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of 
hysterectomy. There would also be dilution from 
hysterectomies done several days after birth for reasons 
other than to prevent life-threatening bleeding. With 
these concerns in mind, we increased the sample size 
from 15 000 to 20 000 patients in the hope that the trial 
would have enough power to detect a reduction in post-
partum haemorrhage death.17
There was a statistically significant reduction in death 
due to bleeding with tranexamic acid with no significant 
increase or decrease in any other cause of death. Because 
more than one quarter of deaths were not due to bleeding, 
the reduction in all-cause mortality with tranexamic acid, 
which is a weighted average of its effect on bleeding and 
non-bleeding deaths, was not statistically significant. 
Indeed, considering that one quarter of deaths after post-
partum haemorrhage are not bleeding related, it would 
require trials many times larger than ours to show a 
statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality.18 
Nevertheless, because the relative contributions of 
bleeding and non-bleeding (eg, sepsis) deaths to all-cause 
mortality will vary by region or between hospitals, the 
effect on all-cause mortality is not generalisable. For 
example, tranexamic acid will have a larger effect on all-
cause mortality in hospitals where sepsis death is rare 
than in hospitals where sepsis death is common. The 
effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding is the 
generalisable measure. 
Although tranexamic acid did not prevent hysterectomy, 
it substantially reduced the number of laparotomies to 
control bleeding. While hysterectomy might be a last 
resort to control bleeding in high-income settings, in 
Africa and Asia where many women are anaemic and 
blood supplies are limited,19–21 hysterectomy is often an 
early intervention to prevent death from exsanguination. 
Furthermore, there would probably have been a delay 
between randomisation and the administration of the 
trial treatment, so that even though the decision to 
randomise might have preceded the decision to do a 
hysterectomy, in some cases the trial treatment would 
not have been received when the hysterectomy decision 
was made. On the other hand, laparotomies which often 
involve re-operation to control bleeding following 
caesarean section, are more commonly done after other 
interventions including the trial treatment have been 
given. This might have allowed sufficient time for 
tranexamic acid to affect the risk of laparotomy. 
Randomised trials in elective surgery also show large 
reductions in the need for re-operation to control 
bleeding with tranexamic acid.22

The dilution of the effect of tranexamic acid arising 
from interventions that were initiated prior to receipt of 
the trial treatment is likely to apply to other surgical 
interventions and blood transfusion. Considering that 
there may only be a few hours from onset of primary 
post-partum haemorrhage to maternal death, it is not 
surprising 
that 
other 
interventions 
were 
given 
concurrently with the trial treatment. Given the urgency, 
clinicians cannot wait and see if the trial treatment has 
an effect before giving other treatments, not least because 
half of the women received placebo. The only outcome 
that invariably follows randomisation is death. This may 
explain why in this trial, and in the CRASH-2 trial of 
tranexamic acid in significant traumatic bleeding, there 
was a reduction in death due to bleeding with tranexamic 
acid despite no reduction in transfusion.9
The WOMAN trial began before the results of the 
CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma 
patients were available. The CRASH-2 trial recruited 
20 211 adults with traumatic bleeding and showed that 
tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding and all-
cause mortality with no increase in vascular occlusive 
events. There was strong evidence of a time to treatment 
interaction. In patients treated within 3 h of injury, 
tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding by around 
one third, but when given after 3 h, it seemed to increase 
the risk.9,10 Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after 
trauma and is associated with increased mortality.11 
Because similar temporal changes in fibrinolysis have 
been observed after childbirth,23 we expected that early 
treatment with tranexamic acid would also be more 
effective after post-partum haemorrhage and planned to 
set the WOMAN trial results in the context of all available 
clinical data on the time to treatment interaction. Bearing 
in mind that even a large trial such as ours would have 
limited power to detect a time to treatment interaction 
for death due to bleeding, setting the trial results in the 
context of the totality of the available evidence seemed to 
be the most sensible approach. Although there are on-
going trials of tranexamic acid in life threatening 
bleeding, the CRASH-2 trial is the only trial to date that 
provides such evidence.24,25 Figure 5 shows the results of 
the WOMAN trial in the context of the CRASH-2 results. 
There is a strong suggestion that early treatment is most 
effective and late treatment is unlikely to be beneficial.
On the basis of clinical trials of tranexamic acid in 
surgery and trauma, WHO guidelines recommended 
tranexamic acid in post-partum haemorrhage if 
uterotonics fail to stop the bleeding or if it is thought that 
the bleeding may be due to trauma.1 Our results suggest 
that if tranexamic acid is used in the treatment of post-
partum haemorrhage it should be given soon after the 
onset of post-partum haemorrhage alongside uterotonics. 
First, our findings show that a significant proportion of 
mothers die within hours of post-partum haemorrhage 
onset. In such circumstances, waiting to see if uterotonics 
fail to stop the bleeding could put some mothers’ lives at 
risk. We found no evidence of adverse effects with 
tranexamic acid and it has also been shown to be safe 
and effective in trauma and surgery. Second, our data 
suggest that early administration is most effective. 
Treatment within 3 h of birth significantly reduced death 
due to bleeding and the need for laparotomy to control 
bleeding, an observation consistent with results of trials 
of tranexamic acid in traumatic bleeding. Although we 
did not see a monotonic decrease in the risk of death due 
to bleeding with decreasing time to treatment, as seen in 
trauma, this is more likely to reflect the imprecision of 
the estimates rather than the underlying biological 
relationship. We did observe such a monotonic decrease 
in the risk of laparotomy to control bleeding as time to 
treatment decreased. Finally, the temporal changes in 
fibrinolytic activation after childbirth are similar to those 
in trauma with an early (within one hour) increase in 
levels of tissue plasminogen activator.14 However, in the 
light of our results, further research into the timecourse 
of the changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis after 
childbirth are needed.
In the WOMAN trial, tranexamic acid was given by 
intravenous injection. However, in low-income and 
middle-income countries, many deaths from post-
partum bleeding occur at home or settings where

bioavailability of tranexamic acid after non-intravenous
