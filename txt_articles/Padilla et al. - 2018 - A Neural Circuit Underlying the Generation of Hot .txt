In Brief
The underlying cause of hot flushes is
poorly understood. Padilla et al. provide
evidence that a subpopulation of
hypothalamic neurons can generate hot
flush symptoms in mice. Establishing the
mechanism of hot flush generation may
allow for the development of therapies.

SUMMARY
Hot
flushes
are
a
sudden
feeling
of
warmth
commonly associated with the decline of gonadal
hormones at menopause. Neurons in the arcuate nu-
cleus of the hypothalamus that express kisspeptin
and neurokinin B (Kiss1ARH neurons) are candidates
for mediating hot flushes because they are negatively
regulated by sex hormones. We used a combination
of genetic and viral technologies in mice to demon-
strate that artificial activation of Kiss1ARH neurons
evokes a heat-dissipation response resulting in
vasodilation (flushing) and a corresponding reduc-
tion of core-body temperature in both females and
males. This response is sensitized by ovariectomy.
Brief activation of Kiss1ARH axon terminals in the pre-
optic area of the hypothalamus recapitulates this
response, while pharmacological blockade of neuro-
kinin B (NkB) receptors in the same brain region
abolishes it. We conclude that transient activation
of Kiss1ARH neurons following sex-hormone with-
drawal contributes to the occurrence of hot flushes
via NkB release in the rostral preoptic area.
INTRODUCTION
Hot flushes, also described in the literature as hot flashes or
menopausal vasomotor symptoms, are a periodic and often
overwhelming sensation of heat, sweating, and flushing that
affect millions of individuals (Freeman and Sherif, 2007). Hot-
flush symptoms negatively impact quality of life and are the pre-
dominant reason women seek medical intervention during
menopause (Hess et al., 2012). Hot flushes are generally thought
to be an inappropriate recruitment of thermoregulatory heat-
effector responses to a perceived warmth; namely, an acute
episode of vasodilation and a resultant drop in core body tem-
perature as heat is lost to the environment through convection.
Decades of research into mammalian thermoregulation has pro-
vided a map of brain regions involved in the maintenance of core
body temperature, with the preoptic area of the hypothalamus
(POA) emerging as the central hub of integration and control
(Morrison and Nakamura, 2011). The median POA receives envi-
ronmental temperature information from peripheral sensory neu-
rons via the parabrachial nucleus, and it is sufficient to modulate
vasomotor responses such as those underlying hot flushes (Mor-
rison and Nakamura, 2011; Nakamura and Morrison, 2010).
However, the mechanism by which sex-hormone status is
relayed to POA has not been elucidated.
Hot flushes are often coincident with a burst of luteinizing
hormone (LH) release, which peaks immediately following an
acute rise in skin temperature (Casper et al., 1979). When
circulating estrogen is low, the pulsatile activity of GnRH neu-
rons (expressing gonadotrophin regulatory hormone) and cor-
responding release of LH is thought to be determined by kiss-
peptin (Kiss1)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of
the hypothalamus (Kiss1ARH) (Clarkson et al., 2017; Navarro
et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2016). A growing body of evidence
from Rance and colleagues (Rance et al., 2013) suggests
that Kiss1ARH neurons may be a link between sex hormone
fluctuations and hot flushes. Importantly, Kiss1ARH neurons
project some of their axons to the median POA, and they
co-express neurokinin B (NkB) (Goodman et al., 2007; Krajew-
ski et al., 2010; Navarro et al., 2009; Yeo and Herbison, 2011).
Systemic injection of an NkB receptor agonist (senktide), or
microinfusion of senktide directly into the POA, is sufficient
to evoke hypothermia in rodents (Dacks et al., 2011; Krull
et al., 2017), and pharmacological blockade of NkB receptors
markedly reduces hot-flush frequency in menopausal women
(Prague et al., 2017).
Kiss1ARH neurons are negatively regulated by estrogen as part
of a normal feedback mechanism that is necessary to sustain
fertility (Goubillon et al., 2000; Han et al., 2015; Mittelman-Smith
et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2005). The drop in estrogen levels during
menopause leads to the hypertrophy of Kiss1ARH neurons and
significant increases in Kiss1 and NkB expression levels in hu-
mans (Rance and Young, 1991; Rometo et al., 2007; Sheehan
and Kova
´ cs, 1966) or following ovariectomy in mice (Smith
et al., 2005), rats (Roa et al., 2006), sheep (Goodman et al.,
2007), and primates (Rometo et al., 2007). Altered activity of
Kiss1ARH neurons during states of estrogen withdrawal has,
therefore, been proposed as a mechanism that predisposes
women to hot-flush generation, specifically via disrupted
communication to the median POA (Rance et al., 2013). While
this is an attractive hypothesis, hot flushes are an episodic

 phenomenon, and there has been no direct evidence that tran-
sient activation of Kiss1 neurons can elicit hot flush-like activity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Contemporary technologies provide a means to functionally
manipulate genetically defined neurons and circuits in mice.
These tools allowed us to directly test the impact of Kiss1ARH
neuron activity and circuitry on vasomotor thermoregulation.
We generated a new mouse line that expresses Cre recombi-
nase from the Kiss1 gene locus (Kiss1Cre mice) to allow for
selective manipulation of Kiss1-expressing neurons (Figure S1).
We verified that Cre expression in the Kiss1Cre mouse line is
consistent with published literature on the central expression
of Kiss1, particularly in the arcuate hypothalamus (ARH) and in
the rostral periventricular area of the hypothalamus, two of the
most studied populations of Kiss1-expressing neurons (Figures
S1 and S2). Kiss1Cre homozygous mice are infertile (Figure S2),
similar to previous Kiss1 knockout mice (d’Anglemont de
Tassigny et al., 2007).
We co-injected adeno-associated virus, serotype 1 (AAV1) vi-
ruses containing fluorescently tagged Cre-dependent versions
of the excitatory channelrhodopsin (DIO-ChR2:YFP) and the
excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer
drugs (DREADD), hM3Dq (DIO-hM3Dq:mCherry), into the ARH
of female Kiss1Cre mice and implanted a fiber-optic cannula
above the ARH to allow artificial activation of Kiss1ARH neurons
(Figures 1A and 1B). We hypothesized that activating Kiss1ARH
neurons would initiate a hot-flush-like vasodilation, resulting in
increased skin temperature and consequent drop in core
body temperature, consistent with the clinical presentation of
hot flushes (Freedman, 1998). Indeed, we found that chemoge-
netic activation of Kiss1ARH neurons with clozapine N-oxide
(CNO, the ligand for hM3Dq) produced hot-flush-like symptoms
in experimental female mice compared to controls. Figure 1C
shows the fluctuation in core body temperature of a typical
mouse over 5 days, while Figure 1D shows the average of all
the mice for 24 hr with CNO injection indicated by the arrow.
Figure 1E shows the decrease in core body temperature
compared to controls during the first 2 hr after CNO administra-
tion, while Figure 1F reveals the rise in tail-skin temperature of
the same female mice. Artificial stimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons
also suppressed home-cage locomotor activity, a response
similar to that observed when activating warm-sensitive POA
neurons (Yu et al., 2016) (Figure 1G). Optogenetic activation
of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing Kiss1ARH cell bodies
for 1 hr similarly evoked a pronounced increase in tail-skin tem-
perature (Figure 1H).

 While the vast majority of patients who suffer from hot flushes
are menopausal women, hot flushes can affect both sexes in
response to rapid decreases in sex hormone levels, such as
that which occurs in men undergoing androgen deprivation ther-
apy for prostate cancer or after castration (Karling et al., 1994;
Kumar et al., 2005). To examine whether Kiss1ARH neurons
may underlie hot-flush-like symptoms in general, we co-injected
AAV1 viruses containing Cre-dependent hM3Dq and ChR2 into
the ARH of male Kiss1Cre mice. We found that activation of
Kiss1ARH neurons using either CNO administration or light deliv-
ery in male mice increased tail-skin temperature to the same
extent as that in female mice (Figures 1I and 1J).
To confirm that our viral strategy was efficiently transducing
Kiss1ARH neurons, we verified the presence of hM3Dq:mCherry-
expressing neurons in the ARH (Figures 2A and 2B). Because
Kiss1ARH neuronal signaling can be excitatory via co-release of
Kiss1, NkB, and glutamate, we then asked whether artificial acti-
vation of Kiss1ARH neurons is sufficient to stimulate downstream
neurons in and around the predicted temperature-effector region
in the POA. We examined Fos, an immediate-early gene used as a
marker of activity, throughout the POA following stimulation of
Kiss1ARH neurons compared to controls (Figures 2C–2E). Stimula-
tion of Kiss1ARH neurons significantly increased Fos expression in
the POA (Figure 2F).
Based on the hypothesis that Kiss1ARH neurons relay infor-
mation to warm-sensing neurons in the POA (Rance et al.,
2013), we predicted that selective activation of Kiss1ARH
neuron terminals in the POA would recapitulate the hot-
flush-like response seen after cell-body stimulation. To test
this idea, we injected an AAV1 virus containing Cre-dependent
ChR2 into the ARH of Kiss1Cre mice as before, but we im-
planted a fiber-optic cannula over the Kiss1ARH fibers in the
rostral POA (Figure 3A). Figures 3B and 3C show the typical
6-day and average 24-hr fluctuations of core body tempera-
ture, with the photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons shown as
a vertical blue bar. There was a significant decrease in core
body temperature during the 2 hr after photoactivation of the
Kiss1 axon terminals in the POA (Figure 3D). Activation of
ChR2 in Kiss1ARH-neuron fibers in the POA also increased
tail-skin temperature (Figure 3E) and decreased home-cage
locomotor activity (Figure 3F), as was observed following
cell-body stimulation. The POA contains neurons that are
intrinsically temperature sensitive (Nakayama et al., 1961).
To test whether our laser stimulation paradigm alone (2 Hz,
10 mW) was sufficient to induce hot-flush-like symptoms, a
conditional mCherry virus (AAV1-DIO-mCherry) was injected
into the ARH of Kiss1Cre female mice and the fiber-optic can-
nula implanted above the rostral POA. Laser exposure in the
POA of these mice failed to evoke physiological responses,
confirming that the responses obtained with ChR2 photoacti-
vation were not induced by heating temperature-sensitive
neurons within the POA (Figure S3).

 Hot flushes in humans are typically brief, lasting anywhere
from seconds to 10 min (Freedman, 1998). To examine a more
physiologically relevant time course, we optogenetically stimu-
lated ChR2 in Kiss1ARH-neuron fibers in the POA for only
2 min. Tail-skin temperature rose significantly above baseline
for over 45 min before dropping back down to baseline (Fig-
ure 3G). These data confirm that even brief activation of this cir-
cuit is sufficient to engage a prolonged, thermoregulatory heat-
effector response.
Because clinical hot flushes typically present after acute sex
hormone withdrawal, we next examined the influence of sex-hor-
mone status on Kiss1ARH-mediated flushing. It has been shown
that Kiss1ARH neurons are more sensitive to artificial activation
following gonadectomy (Han et al., 2015), so we predicted that
the vasomotor response to Kiss1ARH stimulation would be sensi-
tized. To test this hypothesis, we first established a graded tail-
skin temperature response to activation of hM3Dq-expressing
Kiss1ARH neurons by administering a range of CNO concentra-
tions from 0.05 to 1 mg/kg. Intact females demonstrated a
dose-dependent increase of tail-skin temperature in response
to increasing concentrations of CNO, with a partial effect at
0.3 mg/kg and a full effect at 1 mg/kg (Figure 4A). Based on these
data, we then ovariectomized the mice and re-tested them with a
dose of 0.3 mg/kg. After ovariectomy, this lower dose of CNO
was now sufficient to induce a significant increase in tail-skin
temperature (Figure 4A), a result consistent with the hypothesis
that altered properties of Kiss1ARH neurons after sex-hormone
withdrawal could contribute to hot-flush susceptibility.
It has been proposed that NkB signaling from Kiss1ARH neu-
rons may mediate hot-flush responses (Rance et al., 2013),
because NkB-receptor-expressing neurons are in the median
POA (Shughrue et al., 1996), and engaging those receptors
through injection of a NkB receptor agonist into the median
POA induces hypothermia in rats (Dacks et al., 2011). To test
this hypothesis directly, we infused neurokinin receptor antago-
nists into the POA before chemogenetically activating Kiss1ARH
neurons (Figure 4B). Because there are three neurokinin recep-
tors (NK1R, NK2R, and NK3R), and NkB has some affinity for
all of them, we infused a cocktail of antagonists for all three (de
Croft et al., 2013). Infusion of this antagonist cocktail 30 min prior

 to chemogenetic activation of Kiss1ARH neurons prevented the
increase in tail-skin temperature (Figures 4C and 4D).
These data are consistent with the idea that Kiss1ARH neu-
rons contribute directly to the initiation of hot-flush-like symp-
toms, specifically via NkB signaling to the POA. Complete abol-
ishment of this effect by infusion of neurokinin receptor
antagonists into the POA suggests that NkB release from this
projection of Kiss1 neurons is the most relevant for generating
hot-flush-like activity (Yeo and Herbison, 2011). The functional
relevance of Kiss1ARH innervation of the POA for normal ther-
moregulation has not been elucidated, although cyclic changes
in core body temperature that correlate with fertility and stages
of menstrual cycles in women are implicated (Sanchez-Alavez
et al., 2011). The process of implantation and carrying offspring
to term may require an ability to modulate core body tempera-
ture that is related to, but separate from, circadian body tem-
perature fluctuations (Smarr et al., 2016). Whether this circuit
represents an independent pathway linking core body temper-
ature to the reproductive axis or is one facet of a larger network
of thermoregulatory circuits remains to be established. Alterna-
tively, the POA is involved in a number of homeostatic mecha-
nisms beyond thermoregulation (McKinley et al., 2015), and it
is possible that the hypertrophic state of Kiss1ARH neurons
when sex-hormone levels fall activates NkB receptors in the
POA without having functional significance under normal
conditions.
Hot flushes are sporadic with an irregular frequency, and some
women do not experience vasomotor symptoms during meno-
pause. Both Kiss1 expression and NkB expression are elevated
in

(Goodman et al., 2007; Rance and Young, 1991; Roa et al.,
2006; Rometo et al., 2007; Sheehan and Kova
´ cs, 1966; Smith
et al., 2005), priming these neurons to evoke GnRH-mediated
LH release as well as NkB-mediated hot flushes. Kiss1ARH
neuron activity is synchronized by local autoregulation mecha-
nisms (Qiu et al., 2016), and following gonadectomy in mice,
Kiss1ARH neurons demonstrate a pulsatile activity pattern with
a fixed period that is correlated with peaks of LH release (Clark-
son et al., 2017). This pulsatile activity pattern, however, is not
sufficient to explain the sporadic, episodic nature of hot flushes.
Epidemiological data indicate that numerous sensory and inter-
oceptive cues can evoke flushing in menopausal women,
including: higher ambient temperature, consumption of spicy
foods, anxiety, altitude, and acute physiological stressors (Fed-
erici et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2013; Swartzman et al., 1990).
Thus, we hypothesize that flushes occur when excitatory
external cues converge on Kiss1ARH neurons during an episode
of endogenous activity. Our experiments demonstrate that tran-
sient activation of Kiss1ARH neurons by either chemogenetic or
optogenetic means is sufficient to elicit hot-flush-like vasomotor
responses in mice and that this effect is enhanced by
ovariectomy.
The most prevalent current therapy for hot flushes in the
United States is estrogen replacement, the long-term safety of
which has been questioned (Rossouw et al., 2013). The identity
and function of POA neurons innervated by Kiss1ARH neurons,
specifically those containing the NkB receptor, may provide
additional targets, e.g., receptors, for the development of drugs
that can treat hot-flush symptoms. Additionally, the identification

 mediate heat-effector responses is an area of growing interest
(Song et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016), and how neu-
rons expressing NkB receptors fit into this larger picture remains
to be seen.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Additional information and resources are included in the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Study Approval
All experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with approval from the University
of Washington’s Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult mice (ages
2–8 months) had ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water and
were housed under a 12-hr:12-hr light:dark cycle at 21.51 ± 0.09�C. Zeitgeber
time (ZT) of 0:00 indicates the onset of the light cycle each day.
Data Analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed with GraphPad’s Prism software and
are reported in detail in the figure legends. A p value of 0.05 was the threshold
for significance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001), and all error bars repre-
sent SEM. The ns represent either individual mice or histological sections, as
indicated in the text.
