Keywords atrial fibrillation, middle-aged population, nationwide population-based study, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
AIMS
It remains inconclusive whether the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases the risk of atrial fibrillation
(AF), especially in middle-aged Asian populations. In this study, we evaluated the association between NSAID use and the risk of AF
in a nationwide population-based study of middle-aged individuals in Taiwan.
METHODS
A nested case–control study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. We
identified the cases with a diagnosis of AF (ICD-9-CM codes: 427.31) and the matched controls from three independent Longi-
tudinal Health Insurance Databases (LHIDs) derived from the NHIRD from data collected from 2001 to 2013. Conditional logistic
regression models with covariate adjustment were performed to evaluate the association between NSAID use and the risk of AF.
RESULTS
A total of 57 058 participants (28 529 AF cases and 28 529 matched controls) were included. Participants with NSAID use had an
elevated risk of AF compared to non-users [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14–1.23]. When
further assessing the effects of different classes of NSAIDs on the risk of AF, the results showed that participants who used non-
selective NSAIDs had a significantly elevated risk of AF (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.13–1.23), as did participants with a combined use
of selective and non-selective NSAIDs (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21–1.39).
CONCLUSIONS
NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of AF occurrence among the participants included in our study cohort. Closely
monitoring the adverse effects of NSAID treatment on the risk of AF will be important, particularly among individuals at high risk.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects approximately 0.5% of the general population, but more than 6% of the elderly population,
and the prevalence of AF has been rising during the past decades.
• It remains inconclusive whether the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases risk of AF, especially
in middle-aged Asian populations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• We found that NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurrence among our study
participants from an Asian population.
• Based on these findings, it will be important to closely monitor the adverse effects of NSAID treatment on the risk of AF,
particularly among individuals at high risk.
• The underlying mechanisms associated with our findings deserve further investigation.
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects
approximately 0.5% of the general population, but more
than 6% of the elderly population [1, 2]. It is noteworthy that
the prevalence of AF has been rising during the past decades
[3]. Several studies have reported that AF is associated with
an elevated risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases
and death [4–6]. The underlying mechanisms that lead to
the development of AF remain unclear, but recent studies
have suggested that inflammation may precede the patho-
genesis of AF [7, 8].
Previous studies have documented a positive association
between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and the risk of AF, but limited studies have been
conducted in Asian populations [9–13]. NSAIDs are cyclooxy-
genase (COXs)-mediated inhibitors, and NSAID mechanisms
are related to the inhibition of the formation of prostaglan-
dins, prostacyclins and thromboxanes [14, 15]. For these
reasons, at present, NSAIDs are widely prescribed as symp-
tomatic treatment for various clinical conditions, e.g., acute
pain, chronic inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases,
etc. Looking more closely, in consideration of the clinical
and public health implications and their widespread use, it
is important to confirm the previously observed association
between NSAID use and AF [16].
Although previous studies have investigated the role of
NSAIDs on AF, most were conducted in general populations.
Limited studies have evaluated the adverse effects of NSAIDs
on AF in a middle-aged population, especially Asian popula-
tions. To extend our understanding of this issue, this study
presents
the
findings
of
a
nested
case–control
study
designed to elucidate the effects of NSAID use on AF occur-
rence in a middle-aged population using a large nationwide
population-based cohort in Taiwan.
Methods
Data source
This study used data derived from three different Longitudi-
nal Health Insurance Databases (LHIDs) comprised of medi-
cal claims data, which are part of the National Health
Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. In detail,
the NHIRD includes demographic characteristics, outpatient
visits and inpatient claims data, prescription records and
disease diagnoses for approximately 99% of the entire popu-
lation of 23 million people in Taiwan [17]. The LHIDs were
generated by randomly selecting one million enrolees from
the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme in 2000
(LHID 2000), 2005 (LHID 2005) and 2010 (LHID 2010), sepa-
rately. As a result, data from a total of three million enrolees
were investigated in this study. All medical claims data in
the LHIDs from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2013 were
included, accordingly. The study protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the National Health Re-
search Institutes, Taiwan.
Cases of atrial fibrillation and matched
controls
The incident cases of AF were defined as individuals aged 45
years and older in 2001 with medical claims (either a one-
time hospitalization or at least two or more outpatient visits
within one year) for AF (ICD-9-CM codes: 427.31) during
the study period. The date of the first medical claim record
for AF was identified as the index date. We applied three dif-
ferent matching algorithms: (1) matching by index year, age
and gender; (2) matching by index year, age, gender and four
related diseases; and (3) matching by disease risk score (DRS)
at the fourth decimal point by accounting for potential con-
founding factors (Table S1). In detail, the DRS, which in this
case was a patient’s predicted probability of developing AF,
was estimated using logistic regression [18] and calculated
based on the individual covariate values multiplied by the re-
gression coefficients. All of the considered covariates (as
shown in Table S1) in the year prior to the index date were in-
cluded in the logistic regression model without variable selec-
tion. We selected
the second
matching
algorithm for
subsequent analyses in this study. Specifically, for each case,
we randomly selected one control who did not have any AF
diagnosis at the time that the matched case was first diag-
nosed with AF. The controls were matched with the case by
age (the same birth year), sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), osteo-
arthritis, and index year. Matched controls were assigned the
same index date as their matched cases. Of note, among
cases, participants were excluded if they were ever diagnosed
as having AF or valvular heart disease (VHD) prior to 2004.
For both cases and controls, we excluded participants taking
part in the NHI programme for less than one year before the
index date.

 Utilization of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs)
A list of NSAIDs was identified from prescription records in the
LHIDs, including: the different medication components, time
of prescription, and duration of drug supply and dosage,
individually. Specifically, NSAIDs were classified as follows: (1)
selective COX-2 inhibitors: celecoxib, etoricoxib and rofecoxib;
and (2) non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors: aceclofenac,
acemetacin, alclofenac, alminoprofen, diclofenac, diflunisal,
etodolac, fenbufen, fenoprofen, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen,
ibuprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefenamic acid, meloxicam,
nabumetone, naproxen, niflumic acid, nimesulide, piroxicam,
sulindac, tenoxicam, and indomethacin. We also grouped
NSAIDs into: high COX-2 selectivity: celecoxib, etoricoxib,
rofecoxib;
intermediate
COX-2
selectivity:
aceclofenac,
etodolac, nabumetone, nimesulide, meloxicam, diclofenac,
diflunisal, piroxicam, sulindac; and more selective for COX-1:
acemetacin, alclofenac, alminoprofen, fenbufen, fenoprofen,
flufenamic
acid,
flurbiprofen,
ibuprofen,
indomethacin,
ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefenamic acid, naproxen, niflumic
acid,
tenoxicam.
In
addition,
acetaminophen
was
also
examined in this study.
NSAID exposure
We investigated the effect of long-term NSAID use on the
development of AF. The definition of exposure to NSAID
use in this study was as follows. First, participants exposed
to NSAIDs were defined as ‘users’ if they had at least one
day of an NSAID supply within 365 days prior to the index
date. Next, among the users, we defined participants as ‘cur-
rent users’ if they were exposed to NSAIDs within 30 days
prior to the index date, or as ‘past users’ if they were exposed
to NSAIDs within 31–365 days (but not within 30 days) prior
to the index date. Furthermore, current users were defined as
‘new users’ if they were first exposed to NSAIDs during 30
days prior to the index date, but not exposed to NSAIDs
between 31 and 365 days prior to the index date, or ‘contin-
uous users’ if NSAIDs were started between 31–365 days
prior to the index date. Participants were defined as ‘non-
users’ if no NSAID was prescribed within 365 days prior to
the index date [1, 11].
Adjustment of potential confounding factors
The list of potential confounders considered in this study in-
cluded medical comorbid disorders (anaemia, coronary heart
disease, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, cerebrovas-
cular disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel disease, ma-
lignant neoplasm, peripheral vascular disease, Parkinson’s
disease, rheumatoid arthritis and renal failure), concomitant
medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants,
antihypertensives, bisphosphonates, benzodiazepines, in-
haled glucocorticosteroids, oral glucocorticosteroids, hor-
mone
replacement
therapy),
and
healthcare
utilization
within one year prior to the index date (both outpatient visits
and hospitalizations) [11, 19].
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics of the AF cases and matched controls
(e.g., demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbid
medical
disorders,
concomitant
medication
use,
and
healthcare utilization) were summarized as counts and
percentages, or as mean and standard deviation (SD). To com-
pare the distribution of demographic and clinical characteris-
tics between the AF cases and matched controls, a chi-square
test was used for testing discrete variables and the Student’s
t-test was used for testing continuous variables. Conditional
logistic regression analyses (with and without covariate
adjustment) were performed to determine the association of
NSAID use (overall, selective and non-selective NSAIDs, indi-
vidually), defined daily dose (DDD) of NSAIDs, which was
defined as ‘the assumed maintenance dose per day for a drug
used for its main indication’, and number of prescriptions,
respectively, with AF. We further examined the various expo-
sure statuses, different classes, and each individual drug effect
of the NSAIDs. If participants took two or more classes of
NSAIDs at the same time, we defined those participants as
combined users. The covariates that were adjusted for in the
models are listed above.
We declared P-values less than 0.05 as statistically signifi-
cant. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 for
Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
A total of 57 058 participants (28 529 AF cases and 28 529
matched controls) were included in the study. Among them,
there were 21 416 participants from LHID 2000 (10 708 AF
cases and 10 708 matched controls), 22 014 participants from
LHID 2005 (11 007 AF cases and 11 007 matched controls),
and 17 808 participants from LHID 2010 (8904 AF cases and
8904 matched controls), respectively. Figure 1 depicts the
detailed flow chart for identifying participants included in
the study cohort. Of note, we excluded participants who
were in two out of the three LHID datasets (n = 2090). The
distributions of demographic and clinical characteristics,
concomitant medication use, and healthcare utilization in
LHID2000, LHID2005, LHID2010 and the three LHID com-
bined datasets are presented in Table S2 and Table 1,
respectively.
In addition, we applied three matching algorithms as pre-
sented in Table S1. The results were comparable across the dif-
ferent matching algorithms. Given this finding, we used the
dataset that was created from individual disease matching;
that is, the controls were matched with each AF case by age
(the same birth year), sex, T2DM, hypertension, CHF, osteo-
arthritis, and index year, to perform the subsequent analyses,
and reported the results.
Table 2 presents the association between NSAID use on
the risk of AF. Compared to non-users, participants with
NSAID use had a positive association with AF in the LHID
combined dataset [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.18, 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.14–1.23]. When further classify-
ing NSAID use into new users, continuous users and past
users, similar associations between NSAID use and increased
risk of AF were found (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.95–2.43 for
new users; AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.36–1.52 for continuous
users; AOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.10 for past users). Addi-
tionally, similar results were observed in each LHID dataset

1292

 (LHID 2000, LHID 2005 and LHID 2010) (Table 2). In addi-
tion, when we treated 3 months prior to the index date as
the latent period in this study and repeated the analyses ac-
cordingly, similar results were observed (Table S3).
When further assessing the effects of different classes of
NSAIDs on the risk of AF (Table 3), we found that participants
taking non-selective NSAIDs had a significantly elevated risk
of AF (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.13–1.23) as did participants with
a combined use of selective and non-selective NSAIDs (AOR =
1.30, 95% CI: 1.21–1.39) in the LHID combined dataset, but
this was not true for participants taking selective NSAIDs
only. We also examined the effects of each individual NSAID
on AF among participants in LHID 2000, LHID 2005 and
LHID 2010, separately. The results suggest that various indi-
vidual NSAIDs might have a different degree of adverse effect
on the risk of AF (Tables S2–S4). Instead of comparing non-
selective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors, we further
grouped the drugs by more selective for COX-1, intermediate
COX-2 selectivity, and high COX-2 selectivity, separately.
Similar results were found as shown in Table 3. When
investigating defined daily dose (DDD) and number of pre-
scriptions, respectively, no dose–response effects were found
for the use of NSAIDs (Table 4).
Figures 2 and S1–S3 present the results of the subgroup
analyses, stratified by age, sex, index year and various comor-
bid conditions [including T2DM, chronic kidney disease
(CKD), hypertension, MI, CHF, sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis,
gout and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), separately]. No
interactive effect among those examined factors was ob-
served (all p-values > 0.05).
Discussion
In this nationwide population-based case–control study, our
results provide supportive evidence that NSAID use is associ-
ated with increasing incidence of AF in a middle-aged
Taiwanese population. Importantly, positive associations be-
tween NSAID use and AF were found in each of the three inde-
pendent LHID datasets and in the combined LHID dataset.

 When classifying NSAIDs as non-selective NSAIDs, selective
NSAIDs and combined NSAIDs, similar adverse effects of
NSAID use on AF were observed among non-selective NSAID
and combined NSAID users.
Findings from this study are in line with results reported
in previous studies [1, 20, 21]. For instance, Schmidt et al.
have suggested that NSAID use is positively associated with
the risk of AF in a Danish population-based study [11]. Their

 study showed that increased risk of AF occurs during the ini-
tial period of NSAID use but may decrease over time. In addi-
tion, Krijthe et al., using data from the Rotterdam Study, have
demonstrated that NSAID use is associated with an elevated
risk of AF, especially among current users of NSAIDs [2]. Con-
sistently, Chao et al. have reported significant adverse effects
of new NSAID use on AF in a Taiwanese population, particu-
larly among patients at high risk, such as those with CKD or
COPD [12].
It is known that NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase isozymes
(e.g.,
COX-1
and
COX-2)
and
block
biosynthesis
of
prostanoid (PG). As such, NSAIDs decrease total renal per-
fusion and redistribute renal blood flow, which may in-
crease the risk of AF through adverse renal effects via
fluid retention, electrolyte disturbances, and blood pressure
destabilization. Furthermore, these changes may induce
blood pressure elevation due to expansion of plasma vol-
ume, then increased left atrial (LA) pressure, LA stretch,
consequently increased peripheral resistance, [22, 23] and
fluctuation of serum potassium as a result of decreased po-
tassium excretion in the distal nephron, which then trig-
gers AF [24].

 The strengths of this study include, first, the use of three
independent datasets, specifically, LHID 2000, LHID 2005
and LHID 2010, to investigate the association between
NSAID use and AF, in each of which we found similar results.
These findings indicate the robustness of the observed ad-
verse effects of NSAIDs on AF. Second, most studies have

characteristics. a Adjusted variables included: medical comorbid disorders (chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, sleep apnoea, hyperthy-
roidism, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease), and

mone replacement therapy)

 examined the associations between NSAID use and AF in gen-
eral populations. While the majority of these previous studies
have investigated the adverse effects of NSAID use on AF in
European general populations, limited studies have reported
its adverse effects on AF in Asian populations. This study is
one of only a limited number of studies to evaluate the ad-
verse effect on AF in Asian populations, especially in a
middle-aged Asian population. Third, we applied three differ-
ent matching algorithms and repeated the analyses using
LHID 2000, which could serve as a sensitivity analysis. Of
note,
similar
results
were
observed
no
matter
which
matching algorithms were employed, which provided sup-
portive confirmatory evidence in a single study.
Several limitations should be noted. First, we were not
able to estimate the effect of over-the-counter NSAID use.
However, this misclassification is likely to be non-differential
and lead to bias towards the null and an underestimation of
risk. Second, we only examined the adverse effects of NSAID
use on AF in Taiwanese study participants. It would be inter-
esting to confirm these results in other ethnic populations,
particularly in other Asian populations. Third, information
on potential confounding factors such as smoking, alcohol
and obesity are not available in the NHIRD. Therefore, we
employed clinical proxy surrogates, for example, T2DM and
hypertension for obesity, to adjust for those unmeasured con-
founding risk factors. However, it was likely that residual con-
founding effects could still exist due to those unmeasured
variables. Fourth, the underlying pathophysiology of adverse
effects of NSAID use on AF is still not well understood and
merits further investigation. Fifth, the definition of NSAID
use was somewhat limited, even though we defined NSAID
use based on previous publications [1, 11]. For instance, sub-
jects with only one day of use were classified as users. How-
ever, the influence of this on our results should be limited as
the percentage of subjects with only one day of NSAID use
was small in this study.
In summary, the findings from this study indicate that
NSAID use increases the risk of AF among middle-aged
adults in an Asian population. Based on these findings, it
will certainly be important for physicians who prescribe
NSAIDs to do so cautiously, especially among those at high
risk for AF. Benefits and risks of NSAID use should be care-
fully evaluated when delivered in clinical practice. The un-
derlying mechanisms associated with our findings deserve
further investigation.
