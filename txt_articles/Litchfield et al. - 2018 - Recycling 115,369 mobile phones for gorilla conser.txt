Abstract
More than seven billion mobile phones are estimated to be in service globally, with more
than a billion older phones likely to be retired. A major barrier to a sustainable circular econ-
omy for mobile phones is people’s hoarding of their retired phones. Old mobile phones may
be refurbished for re-use or ultimately dismantled for possible extraction of elements, includ-
ing ‘conflict’ metals such as coltan (containing elements tantalum and niobium), mined in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and threatening wild populations of eastern Grauer’s
gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). Zoos Victoria cares for western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla
gorilla) who served as ambassadors for their Grauer’s gorilla counterparts in this commu-
nity-based social marketing initiative. Through tracking of barcodes on satchels of recycled
mobile phones, efficiency of ten different points of influence could be calculated for the
‘They’re Calling on You’ mobile phone recycling community campaign at Zoos Victoria in
Australia. Over a six-year period (2009–2014), a total of 115,369 mobile phones were
donated. The Courier Collect initiative resulted in 50,883 mobile phone donations (44% of
total), followed by the Static Display at Melbourne Zoo, resulting in 29,778 mobile phone
donations (26% of total). The number of phones collected for Keeper Talks (at Melbourne
Zoo and Werribee Open Range Zoo) was 12,684 (11% of total), and in terms of fostering
close connections between visitors and the conservation campaign, keeper talks were effec-
tive as one phone was donated for every four people attending a keeper talk at Werribee
Open Range Zoo and one phone was donated for every 28 people who attended a keeper
talk at Melbourne Zoo. We provide suggestions for future campaigns, so that accurate data
capture can allow cost-benefit analyses to be conducted. Our results demonstrate that a
conservation-based organisation, in partnership with corporate sponsors and community
groups can effectively influenced people’s mobile phone recycling behavior, paving the way
for international collaborations to maximize scale and impact.

 Introduction
One of the biggest challenges for conservation remains in how to translate people’s intention
to act or pledges to act into actual behavior, and necessity for ongoing campaigns to ensure
people continue engaging in the desired behavior. Indeed, many conservation problems are
‘wicked problems’, with climate change as a ‘super wicked problem’ [1]. As with many conser-
vation programs, it is difficult to measure the success of a program and always somewhat sub-
jective. For mobile phone recycling, the behavior of upgrading or replacing a mobile phone
and the donation of the unwanted mobile phone by individuals occurs relatively infrequently,
sometimes yearly [2], but globally such upgrades amount to an estimated 400 million
unwanted mobile phones every year [3]. Linking mobile phone recycling behaviour directly to
conservation outcomes for gorillas and other species impacted by mining for materials con-
tained in mobile phones has not yet been attempted. Systematic analyses and evaluations of
conservation program successes or failures in the field are uncommon, especially in regions
where it is politically or logistically difficult to conduct scientific or community-based studies
[4].
About 7.3 billion mobile phones were in service globally at the end of 2014, with sales
reportedly [5]: 125 million for Apple (2009–2013), 364 million for Samsung (2006–2014), and
1 billion for Nokia (2003–2009). An estimated 1.32 billion mobile phones are in use in China
[6]. Barriers to sustainable global supply chains of mobile phones (circular economy) include
secrecy surrounding ingredients or material composition [7], and lack of recycling of more
than one billion ‘retired’ mobile phones [8, 9]. E-waste recycling facilities do not exist in many
countries [8], but when available (e.g. take-back schemes, recycling for refurbishment and re-
use), most people ‘hoard’ or ‘hibernate’ their unwanted phones [10, 11]. Understanding why
people do not recycle their mobile phones is essential, and we will return to this issue
subsequently.
Annual sales of mobile phones and computers account for about 4% of gold and silver, and
about 20% of cobalt and palladium mined globally [12]. Some materials used in mobile phones
are known as ‘conflict metals’ as profits gleaned from mining them illegally support armed
conflict and human rights abuses [13, 14], and include: coltan (containing elements tantalum
& niobium), cassiterite (containing element tin), wolfram (containing element tungsten), and
gold, sometimes known collectively as 3TG (Tantalum, Tungsten, Tin & Gold). Mining for
coltan in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) takes place in protected areas (e.g.
Kahuzi-Biega National Park), outside regulatory frameworks, and threatens endangered spe-
cies, such as eastern lowland gorillas, and their habitats [15, 16]. In 2009, an estimated 300
gorillas were killed for bushmeat in southern DRC, with hunting and illegal wildlife trade tak-
ing place in and around mining sites [16]. In eastern DRC, recent population estimates of
Grauer’s gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) show a dramatic 77–93% decline, as they also do for
the eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) with a 22–45% decline [17]. As a
result, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN) has classified Grauer’s gorillas as Crit-
ically Endangered, with an estimated 3,800 remaining in the wild [18]. However, small popula-
tions of gorillas at the periphery of their range in DRC are isolated in forest fragments, with as
few as six gorillas remaining in Mt, Tshiaberimu, and just over 200 gorillas left in the high-alti-
tude sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park [19].
The United Nations, governments and mobile phone manufacturers are working to estab-
lish certified ‘DRC conflict free’ trading chains [7, 20, 21]. After recycling, if mobile phones are
unable to be refurbished or reused, elements including ‘conflict metals’ can be recovered,
thereby potentially decreasing mining in gorilla habitats in DRC. Gold and silver content in a
single mobile phone may be as high as US$1.83, but recovery, processing and refining of

 metals to achieve high levels of purity (>99%) is costly and may be harmful to the environment
[22]. Nevertheless, the high value of gold, platinum, silver and palladium is the prime eco-
nomic incentive for materials recovery from mobile phones [22]. For every 30–40 mobile
phones that are recycled, on average 1 gram of gold can be recovered (e.g. from the printed cir-
cuit board), which equates to a whole ton of alluvial ore being mined and processed from natu-
ral sources [23]. Just as mobile phone sales are soaring, and gold content is increasing in some
smartphones (e.g. iPhone 6 contains 30mg of gold), natural sources of gold are expected to
‘run out’ by 2030 [24].
For extraction of elements from old mobile phones to occur, people must recycle their
unwanted phones. That is, behavior of individual mobile phone consumers is essentially the
key to successful mobile phone donation campaigns or programs. Tourists use their mobile
phones to record gorilla encounters in DRC, near illegal mines, sometimes traveling around
the world to catch a glimpse of silverback Chimanuka and his family (Fig 1).
Hoarding or storage of unwanted mobile phones at home
Globally, most people do not recycle their unwanted mobile phones, instead disposing of them
incorrectly with their household waste, or most often, ‘hibernating’ [25] or ‘hoarding’ these

 mobile phones in a drawer or cupboard at home [26]. This hoarding behaviour is problematic,
as it hinders recycling efforts, and occurs across regions, irrespective of the wealth of a country
and its citizens (e.g. United Kingdom, [11]; Kenya, [27]; Sri Lanka, [28]; Australia, [29]; Philip-
pines, [30]; Norway, [31]; Japan, [10]; Switzerland & Liechtenstein [25]; Spain [32]; Austria
[33]; Nepal [34]). Mobile phones are also hoarded by people in China [3], with higher rates
reported for smartphones [35]. Despite an increase in variety of mobile phone recycling
options available in China, including reverse vending machines in subway stations and shop-
ping malls, where people can return a mobile phone in exchange for an agreed upon discount
coupon for future purchase [6], almost 80% of people store their unwanted mobile phones at
home [35].
Results from surveys and interviews of mobile phone consumers have reported reasons for
hoarding mobile phones as: future use or spare parts, data storage, toys for children, nostalgia
[25], emotional attachment [32], and for smartphones, concerns over data security (theft of per-
sonal/private information) after recycling [35]. Recently, the concept of a secondary phone has
emerged, with some people keeping a retired but still functioning phone as a ‘sacrificial device’
for occasions when their new phone might become lost or damaged (e.g. holidays, nights out),
or as a ‘time capsule’ of memories or ‘life narratives’ (e.g. data stored as photos, texts) [36].
Psychological motivations for replacing (e.g. perceived technological or aesthetic obsoles-
cence, social pressure, desire for novelty [33]) and hoarding (e.g. emotional attachment [32];
fear of access to personal data [6]) mobile phones may differ and studies to date tend to include
questions that focus on either one or the other, without use of standardised psychological
scales or measures to allow exploration of psychological differences between individuals.
Hoarding as a broader psychological concept of accumulating objects, including mobile
phones, and becoming emotionally attached to them when they are essentially worthless may
in extreme cases indicate psycho-pathology (e.g. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) [36], while
attachment anxiety has been reported in cases where people anthropormophize their smart-
phone, believing it to have emotions and consciousness [37]. People with a stronger tendency
to hoard objects may not replace their mobile phones as often [36]. Hoarding is problematic
since precious (including conflict) metals in unrecycled old mobile phones are not extracted
and potentially returned to the supply loop, thereby reducing the need for mining in wilder-
ness areas. In Germany, by 2035 it is predicted that more than 8,000 tonnes of precious
(including conflict) metals will lie ‘in unrecycled mobile and smartphones [38], and in China,
by 2025 an estimated nine tonnes of gold, 15 tonnes of silver and 3,107 tonnes of copper will
also be out of the supply loop in 0.35 billion unrecycled mobile and smartphones [6]. Many
people are likely to be unaware of the environmental/health risks associated with hoarding
mobile phones, or the effect on conservation of habitats, species and even mineral resources
[35]. Incorrect disposal of mobile phones is hazardous to humans, other animals and environ-
mental health as mobile phones (comprised of components such as plastic, battery, liquid crys-
tal display, printed circuit board) sent to landfill leach toxic metals or metalloids, and if burnt
produce toxic dioxins and furans [39]. Even when awareness of environmental problems asso-
ciated with waste/unrecycled mobile phones is high, this does not seem to translate into recy-
cling behaviour [6].
Zoos as facilitators of pro-conservation behaviors
Zoos Victoria is comprised of three properties: Melbourne Zoo, Healesville Sanctuary and
Werribee Open Range Zoo, with a combined total of over 2.3 million annual visitors [40].
Parks and zoos as provide opportunities for interacting with nature, with effects on human
well-being, social interactions and relationships with nature [41]. Conservation campaigns

 delivered within a zoo setting, may facilitate social change, since more than 600 million people
globally are estimated to visit zoos every year [42]. There is a growing body of evidence that
zoos can influence human behavior change [43, 44]. Since there is strong evidence to link the
rise of electronic telecommunication devices to the dramatic decline of the Eastern Lowland
Gorilla species within the Democratic Republic of Congo [15, 18], a global effort to recycle and
refurbish electronic devices such as mobile phones is required [45].
Changing human behavior is challenging, since no single technique or behavior change
tool works in all situations [46]. Information-intensive approaches or awareness-raising cam-
paigns are often ineffective on their own in changing unsustainable human behavior [47]. In
Australia, Zoos Victoria runs environmental education programs at its three properties (inside
zoo) as well as community conservation campaigns (outside zoo and online) to tackle human-
induced threats to wildlife [43]. In 2005, post-visit teacher calls were placed to almost 50
schools whose students had taken part in environmental education programs at Werribee
Open Range Zoo, and it was discovered that not a single school had installed a nest-box or
planted native grasses, and only one school had installed a frog bog incorrectly. As a result, to
facilitate uptake of pro-conservation behaviors, Zoos Victoria developed the Connect-Under-
stand-Act (CUA) conservation education model [48], provided as Supporting Information (S3
Appendix), which is based on principles of psychology (e.g. contemporary learning theories)
and utilizes behavior change tools from Community-Based Social Marketing [49]. The CUA
model [48] guided the design and development of the They’re Calling On You (TCOY) cam-
paign to facilitate donation of retired mobile phones (target behavior) by mobile phone users
over 12 years of age (target audience).
Gorillas were chosen as the species for this community-based social marketing initiative
since Zoos Victoria cares for Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) who serve as ambassadors
for their Grauer’s gorilla counterparts, impacted significantly by coltan mining. By focusing on
gorillas, and the link between mining in DRC, and the importance of mobile phone recycling,
the campaign was able to highlight both the topic of gorilla conservation and welfare.
A barriers versus benefits analysis [50] was conducted by Rachel Lowry prior to implemen-
tation through a workshop with the education, visitor experience and Melbourne Zoo primate
keeper team. Since cost and inconvenience of ‘postage and packaging’ was identified as a
potential barrier to people donating phones, pre-paid 50% recycled plastic satchels with a
printed image of resident Melbourne Zoo gorilla, Yakini, were produced (Fig 2). These visually
appealing bright green satchels acted as ‘prompts’ or reminders to recycle their phone, and
satchels were recycled along with returned mobile phones. Partnering with Aussie Recycling
Program (ARP) allowed funds from donated phones to be directed towards primate conserva-
tion, serving as an additional incentive for people to recycle their phones.
Aims of case study and research questions
Our main aim was to evaluate the first six-years (2009–2014) of the ongoing ‘They’re Calling
on You’ (TCOY) community mobile phone recycling campaign developed and run by Zoos
Victoria. Separate barcodes printed on recycling satchels allowed us to track different methods
of connecting with the target audience (Points of Influence or POI), with number of mobile
phones returned providing a basis for assessing efficiency of these POI.
In this paper we address the following research questions:
Q1: What was the total number of mobile phones donated to each POI?
Q2: Research Question 2: What was the potential participant exposure to each POI, costs
associated with each POI, and estimated recoverable elements (including conflict elements)
and landfill space saved?

 A further aim was to use our findings to provide recommendations for accurate data cap-
ture, so that organisations can conduct cost-benefit analyses before they undertake or imple-
ment a similar campaign, similar to a Return on Investment [49]. For example, provision of
pre-paid mobile phone recycling satchels has budgetary implications and may raise potential
environmental concerns (e.g. waste of plastic). At the very least, organisations need to antici-
pate how many satchels (or other packaging) to produce and distribute. Widely disseminating
these findings is important, as our data provide a way of measuring actual behavior (number
of phones donated) rather than self-reported behavioral intention (questionnaire item), with
people’s intention to act often not translated into action [51].
Materials and methods
We collected data for ten Points of Influence (POI), inside the zoo and outside the zoo (wider
community), made possible because each POI was allocated a separate barcode, printed on the
recycling satchels, which were returned to Aussie Recycling Program (ARP) at Moorabbin in
Victoria, Australia. ARP kept records for each barcode, and numbers of phones collected by
courier. Monthly updates of mobile phone donations, according to separate barcodes, were
provided by ARP to the General manager Community Conservation (Rachel Lowry) from
October 2008 until December 2014, who maintained a central database at Zoos Victoria.

 In 2008, Zoos Victoria trialled the mobile phone recycling program over three months
(October- December), with 2,376 mobile phones successfully returned to Melbourne Zoo (329
through Keeper Talks at MZ, 502 through Static Display at MZ, 1,375 by Courier Collect &
171 by website reply label; see procedure for details of each POI). The total number of visitors
to MZ during the trial period was 256,622, The Australasian Regional Association of Zoologi-
cal Parks and Aquaria (renamed Zoo and Aquarium Association), adopted the program as a
regional campaign throughout the Year of the Gorilla (2009) along with 13 other zoological
institutions. Zoos Victoria considered this a successful pilot phase and committed to running
the campaign on an ongoing basis.
Initially, four POI were developed, with others added as capacity became available, and fur-
ther images are provided as Supporting Information (S4 Appendix). Throughout the first year
of the campaign, all staff working at Melbourne Zoo wore badges as part of their uniform (Fig
3). The monthly number of visitors to Melbourne Zoo and Werribee Open Range Zoo were
recorded at the entrances as part of Zoos Victoria normal operating procedure and are pro-
vided as Supporting Information (S1 Appendix).
Inside zoo points of influence
Keeper talks at MZ and WORZ.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of visitors who attended daily scheduled talk
about gorillas, given by zoo keepers in the public viewing area outside the gorilla enclosure at
MZ from January 2009 and at WORZ from August 2011. Although number of visitors at these
talks was not recorded systematically, Zoos Victoria estimate that on average there were three
daily talks attended by 35 people per talk (105 people per day) at MZ and one daily talk
attended by 15 people at WORZ.
Procedure: Keeper(s) giving the talk about gorillas included information about the cam-
paign and offered satchels (MZ satchel barcode S012MZFF; WORZ barcode S012WORZFF)
to any person interested in recycling a mobile phone. Data are available for six years (January
2009- end December 2014) for MZ and three years and five months for WORZ (August 2011-
end December 2014).
Associated costs: The cost of recyclable plastic satchels was covered by the Aussie Recycling
Program, with batches of 20,000 printed at a time, at a cost of AUD $2000 (AUD 10 cents per
satchel). Since keeper talks are a daily occurrence, no additional costs were incurred by Zoos
Victoria.
Static display at MZ.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any visitor to MZ from January 2009, who
walked past and noticed one of the static satchel displays.
Procedure: Zoo visitors could collect satchels from three dispensers, which were accompa-
nied by signage about the campaign, located at the front and back exits at MZ (barcode
S012MZPU). Data are available for six years (January 2009- end December 2014).
Associated costs: The cost of satchels was again covered by the Aussie Recycling Program,
with batches of 20,000 printed at a time, at a cost of AUD $2000 (AUD 10 cents per satchel).
The total cost to Zoos Victoria of three satchel dispensers was AUD $216. The dispensers were
restocked daily, and minimal staff time was required to check and reorder another batch
whenever satchel numbers in storage fell below 6000.
Other activities at MZ and WORZ.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any visitor attending special zoo events at
WORZ from December 2012 and at MZ from March 2013.

 Procedure: Zoo staff and volunteers present at special zoo events offered satchels to any
person interested in recycling a mobile phone (WORZ barcodes S012WZOFF, S012WZON, &
S012WZRR; MZ barcodes S012MZEVT, S012MZMEM, S012MZRR, & S012MZYATZ). Data
are available for one year and ten months (March 2013- end December 2014) for MZ and two
years and one month (December 2012- end December 2014) for WORZ.
Associated costs: The cost of satchels was again covered by the Aussie Recycling Program,
with batches of 20,000 printed at a time, at a cost of AUD $2000 (AUD 10 cents per satchel).

 These events were run as part of Zoos Victoria’s business as usual operations and therefore no
additional costs were incurred by Zoos Victoria.
Outside zoo points of influence
Courier Collect.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any school, organisation or community
group in the state of Victoria, Australia, which registered its interest with Zoos Victoria after
hearing about the campaign from January 2009.
Procedure: As part of its promotion of the TCOY campaign, Zoos Victoria staff targeted
local schools and community/corporate groups through keeper talks, email ‘news blasts’ to
Zoos Victoria members, brochures, internal business newsletters, media articles, school dis-
covery and learning programs and the Zoos Victoria website. When any participating group
collected more than 10 mobile phones, they could ring either MZ (barcode MELZ001) from
January 2009 or WORZ (barcode S012WORZPU) from September 2011 to arrange for a cou-
rier to collect the mobile phones. Satchels were not used. Instead, people were instructed to
pack mobile phones into a box, print out a shipping label from the campaign website, fix it to
the box, and a courier collected them later that day. Occasionally, school groups returned
donated phones to MZ administration office, who then organised courier transfer to ARP. The
number of courier collections was not recorded systematically, just the total number of mobile
phones returned. By the end of 2013, the list of registered groups was 276 schools and 466
organisations, which provides a total figure of 742 community groups for the six-year period
(2009–2014). Data are available for six years (January 2009- end December 2014) for MZ and
two years and four months (September 2011- end December 2014) for WORZ.
Associated costs: For promotion of the campaign, Zoos Victoria staff contributed time and
effort as part of their typical workload, particularly keeping staff, education staff, and members
of the Corporate Sponsorship and Philanthropy team and Wildlife Conservation and Science
team. The Aussie Recycling Program covered the costs of the courier collections (no figure for
this cost is available).
Website reply paid labels.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any visitor to the Zoos Victoria TCOY
campaign webpage from January 2009.
Procedure: After visiting the campaign webpage, participants could print off a label (bar-
code S012MZRPL), stick it onto an envelope/parcel containing the mobile phone to be
returned, and post it to the Aussie Recycling Program at no cost to the participant. Zoos Victo-
ria does not have access to data about monthly website visits for this period.
Associated costs: The cost of postage was covered by the Aussie Recycling Program (no fig-
ure for this cost is available), and the person donating the mobile phone bore the cost of print-
ing the label and purchasing the envelope/parcel themselves.
Bendigo bank branches.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any client visiting one of the 235 Bendigo
Bank branches in Victoria, Australia, from January 2009.
Procedure: Bendigo Bank offered its assistance after hearing about the TCOY program
during discussions with the Zoos Victoria Corporate Sponsorship and Philanthropy team. Par-
ticipants returned their mobile phones to Bendigo Bank branches (barcode S012MZBB), who
then rang a courier to collect them, when more than 10 phones were returned. A few branches
requested satchels (<1000 satchels; costs covered by Aussie Recycling Program) which were
handed to any customer who requested one after seeing the sign promoting the campaign at
the bank.

 Associated costs: The cost of satchels was again covered by the Aussie Recycling Program
(AUD 10 cents per satchel), as was cost of courier collection. For promotion of the campaign,
Zoos Victoria and Bendigo Bank staff contributed time and effort as part of their typical workload.
Herald Sun newspaper.
Participants: Potential participants consisted of any person who obtained a copy of the
Herald Sun newspaper published on the 11th June 2011.
Procedure: The Herald Sun is the official print media partner of Zoos Victoria and promoted
the TCOY campaign as part of its partnership commitment after being approached by the Zoos
Victoria Corporate Sponsorship team. On the 11th June 2011, 539,000 satchels (barcode
S012MZHWT) were distributed as inserts in the Herald Sun delivered across Victoria, Australia.
Associated costs: The cost of satchels was covered by the Aussie Recycling Program, at a
cost of about AUD $53,900 (AUD 10 cents per satchel). For promotion of the campaign, Zoos
Victoria and Herald Sun staff contributed time and effort as part of their typical workload.
Results
Research Question 1: What was the total number of mobile phones donated
to each POI?
The total number of phones donated from 2009–2014, as a number distributed to each point-
of-influence, is provided in Fig 4 and the information as a table is provided as Supporting
Information (S2 Appendix).
The total number of phones donated was 115,369. The largest proportion of these phones
came from the Courier Collect initiative (50,883), accounting for 44% of the total, followed by
the Static Display MZ (26%), with the remaining POI accounting for between 3% and 7% each
(Fig 4). If the number of phones collected for Keeper Talks at MZ and WORZ are combined,
then this POI accounts for more than 12,684 mobile phones (11% of total) being donated. The
inset in Fig 4 shows that the number of phones collected peaked in 2011 with 24,574 phones,
coincident with the addition of the Herald Sun POI.
Research Question 2: What was the potential participant exposure to each
POI, costs associated with each POI, and estimated recoverable elements
(including conflict elements) and landfill space saved?
There were 7,003,488 visitors to MZ during the six-year period (January 2009- end December
2014) and 1,667,834 to WORZ during the same period, with monthly figures provided as Sup-
porting Information (S1 Appendix). Table 1 summarizes, for each POI, the potential partici-
pant pool (number of people likely to have had exposure to each POI), satchel costs, other
additional costs (arising over and above those incurred during normal operations), and the
number of phones returned, with estimated recoverable elements and landfill space saved. Not
all details are available for all POI. In particular, the Website POI is not included in the table
due to lack of information. Of note, while the satchels were associated with cost, they were also
associated with waste. In particular, in the Herald Sun campaign, the 539,000 satchels distrib-
uted yielded only a 1.3% return rate, wasting AUD $53,195 worth of satchels. In total, 3663kg
of elements were recovered (182kg of conflict elements) [22], and returned phones were con-
servatively estimated to account for between 12 and 20 cubic metres. Further information
related to our calculations of element recovery and landfill space saved are provided in Sup-
porting Information (S5 Appendix).
Fig 5 provides an illustration of several techniques that could be used to compare the rela-
tive efficiencies of each POI for those with sufficient data (Table 1). Relative to the Static

 Display, with an estimated 235 people exposed for one phone returned, the Herald Sun
required an estimated 76 people, and the Keeper Talks an estimated 28 (MZ) or 4 (WORZ)
people per phone returned. These relative efficiencies can be expressed in terms of estimated
kilograms of recovered elements, and cubic metres of landfill saved (Fig 5, Upper Panel). Rela-
tive to the Herald Sun POI, with an estimated extra cost of AUD $7.64 per phone, the Static
Display was associated with an estimated $1.12, and the Keeper Talk (MZ) with an estimated
AUD 37 cents per phone (Fig 5, Middle Panel). The Courier Collect POI yielded 69 phones for
every group/organisation and the Bendigo Bank POI yielded 14 phones per branch (Fig 5,
Lower Panel).
Therefore, while the Courier Collect and Static Display POI yielded the greatest number of
phones, the Keeper Talks are relatively strong in terms of efficiency when considering the
number of phones returned relative to the number of potential participants exposed, and the
smaller additional cost for every phone returned.
Discussion
In terms of efficiencies, Keeper talks are a cost-effective way of encouraging mobile phone
donations, since they are given every day as part of the standard operating procedure. They are
Fig 4. The total number of phones donated to each point-of-influence for the six-year period (2009–2014). The stacked column chart presents bar height as
total number of phones for each POI and colored sections within each bar indicate the relative proportion of phones collected in each calendar year. POI is
arranged from least (left) to most (right) phones collected. It should be noted that Melbourne Zoo Keeper Talks MZ, Static Display MZ, the Website, and
Bendigo Bank POI were conducted throughout (from January 2014), the other POIs were conducted for only part of the 6-year period (as described in the
procedure section). The grey inset shows total phones collected (y-axis) for each calendar year (x-axis).

 particularly effective for smaller groups of visitors (15 people) typically attending a keeper talk
at WORZ, since one phone was donated for every four people. This means that more than a
third of people attending a WORZ Keeper talk are inspired to act, suggesting that there is a
connection to the conservation message and keeper as the source of information. Not surpris-
ingly, at a busier urban zoo like MZ, where keeper talks are attended by twice as many people,
and there are three per day, there is less potential to interact as closely with a keeper or perhaps
even to hear the message clearly. The use of couriers to collect bulk numbers of mobile phones
was clearly effective, did not require printing or potential waste of satchels, and potentially fos-
tered close ties with the community outside the zoos, particularly with school groups. The
static displays also required little effort in terms of staff support, and although not interactive
in any way, they were efficient in influencing mobile phone donations.
Recommendations for future data capture to allow accurate cost-benefit
analyses
Cost/benefit comparison calculations in this paper were limited by the data collected for each
POI. In order to facilitate a more complete comparison, Table 2 summarizes examples of informa-
tion that would be required. This is not an exhaustive list but is provided to spur consideration for
future research. Overall, time should be taken to design and implement data capture methods for
the total number of potential participants who are exposed to each point of influence, any embed-
ded and additional costs, and details of returns. Of note, research in this area would benefit from

 standardized techniques for quantifying the value of returned materials, especially element
weights, and the associated monetary and environmental costs (or recovery).
Moreover, embedding mechanisms for feedback from participants, as well as staff at zoos
(and other participating organizations) would allow for continuous improvement to maximize
the efficacy of any POI. This could involve quantitative surveys, but would ideally involve col-
lection of qualitative data, to allow for novel and potentially unexpected suggestions for
improvement. Taken together, this case study highlights the critical gains that could be
afforded by zoo and community group partnerships with researchers, where evaluation meth-
ods can be discussed and co-designed prior to POI implementation.
Conclusions
The results of this case study show that it is possible to move beyond awareness-raising cam-
paigns about mobile phone recycling, or surveys reporting intention to donate unwanted

 phones, to collection of donated mobile phones through a conservation-based organisation.
Although it may never be possible to show a direct effect of mobile phone donations on gorilla
conservation in Africa, there have been improvements in gorilla and habitat protection at
Kahuzi-Biega National Park, in the sector visited by tourists (highland Tshivanga Sector) [18].
Future improvements may indirectly be attributed to the pressure of international govern-
ments and organisations to regulate supply chains, such as the source of Coltan in the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo [52], although due diligence processes in supply chain management
are hampered by illegal conflict minerals becoming mixed-in with legally exported and mined
minerals early on in the supply chain, and once refined into metals at smelters, it is almost
impossible to determine an accurate source of origin [53].
Based on the outcomes of this campaign, the international zoo community can help facili-
tate mobile phone recycling behavior for the benefit of gorilla conservation if a global cam-
paign is strategically activated across zoos (e.g. through the World Association of Zoos and
Aquariums, WAZA). Recycling mobile phones and the process of extracting minerals from
end-of-life mobile phones remains complex [45, 54], as scientists explore more environmen-
tally-friendly (since some hydrometallurgical processes use toxic reagents like cyanide or thio-
sulphate) and efficient chemical and biological methods for mineral extraction [55]. Can the
first six-years of the ongoing TCOY program be considered a success? The 117,745 mobile
phones donated (including three-month trial period donations) may seem a ‘drop in the
ocean’, representing 0.01% of the one billion phones that may be retired globally. However, for
the State of Victoria in Australia, with an estimated population of under six million people
[56], this figure is more impressive, and shows that a conservation-based organisation can
effectively influence people to recycle their phones for gorilla conservation, paving the way for
international collaborations to maximize scale and impact.
