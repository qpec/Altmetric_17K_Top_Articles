Abstract
Objective—Alterations in the normal developmental trajectory of amygdala resting state-
functional connectivity (rs-FC) have been associated with atypical emotional processes and 
psychopathology. Little is known, however, regarding amygdala rs-FC at birth or its relevance to 
outcomes. This study examined amygdala rs-FC in healthy, full-term (FT) infants and in very 
preterm (VPT) infants and tested whether variability of neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted 
internalizing symptoms at age 2 years.
Method—Resting state-fMRI data were obtained shortly after birth from 65 FT infants 
(gestational age [GA] ≥36 weeks) and 57 VPT infants (GA <30 weeks) at term-equivalent. Voxel-

 wise correlation analyses were performed using individual-specific bilateral amygdala regions of 
interest. Total internalizing symptoms and the behavioral inhibition, depression/withdrawal, 
general anxiety, and separation distress subdomains were assessed in a subset (n=44) at age 2 
years using the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment.
Results—In FT and VPT infants, the amygdala demonstrated positive correlations with 
subcortical and limbic structures and negative correlations with cortical regions, though 
magnitudes were decreased in VPT infants. Neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing 
symptoms at age 2 with regional specificity consistent with known pathophysiology in older 
populations: connectivity with the anterior insula related to depressive symptoms, with the dorsal 
anterior cingulate related to generalized anxiety, and with the medial prefrontal cortex related to 
behavioral inhibition.
Conclusion—Amygdala rs-FC is well-established in neonates. Variability in regional neonatal 
amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing symptoms at 2 years, suggesting that risk for internalizing 
symptoms may be established in neonatal amygdala functional connectivity patterns.

INTRODUCTION
The amygdala plays a critical role in the expression and processing of emotion and in 
determining stimuli’s emotional significance.1–3 Amygdala activity increases in response to 
emotional stimuli in healthy children and adults,4,5 and variations in activation are 
associated with affective disorders at both ages.6,7 Amygdala activation is putatively 
regulated through connections with numerous subcortical and cortical structures,2,8,9 and 
amygdala structural connections undergo substantial modification during the first years of 
life.10–13 Critical unresolved issues addressed in this study include defining the normative 
patterns of neonatal amygdala functional connectivity and the relationship between neonatal 
amygdala functional connectivity and risk for development of early childhood affective 
symptoms.
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been utilized to 
investigate functional connectivity (rs-FC) in the developing brain.14,15 Infants and children 
demonstrate rs-FC patterns, including those involving the amygdala,14,16,17 that evolve with 
age towards those of adults.18 One relationship that has been well-characterized during early 
development is between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).19,20 The mPFC 
is an important regulator of amygdala activation, 2,8,9 and variation in rs-FC measures 
between these regions in older children and adults has been linked to anxiety,21–23 
behavioral inhibition,24 and harm avoidance.25 Additionally, altered rs-FC between the 
amygdala and other cortical and subcortical regions was reported in 6-month-old infants at 
high risk for developing internalizing symptoms17 and is associated with infant fear at age 6 
months,26 atypical childhood emotional and cognitive processes,16,27 and adult psychiatric 
disorders.28,29

 While some preliminary evidence exists linking amygdala rs-FC to internalizing symptoms 
even in infancy, there is almost no information about factors that might moderate the nature 
of such relationships. One potential modifying factor is prematurity. Core features of the 
“preterm behavioral phenotype” include social difficulties and internalizing symptoms,30 
and very preterm children (VPT; gestational age [GA] <32 weeks) have increased rates of 
behavioral inhibition and introversion.31,32 Premature infants provide a unique opportunity 
to study variability in amygdala rs-FC relative to both typical development and emergence of 
affective symptoms given prior evidence of altered rs-FC in preterm infants in other 
regions.14 Prior studies have linked prematurity-associated neonatal brain abnormalities to 
subsequent social-emotional development.33–35 However, it is unclear if the etiology of 
internalizing symptoms for preterm children differs from that leading to internalizing 
symptoms in full-term (FT) children.
We investigated patterns of amygdala rs-FC in healthy, FT infants and VPT infants at term-
equivalent postmenstrual age (PMA) and determined whether variations in neonatal 
connectivity predicted internalizing symptoms at age 2 years. The goals of this study were 
three-fold: (1) characterize regions demonstrating synchronous, spontaneous neuronal 
activity with the amygdala during infancy (i.e., rs-FC); (2) assess whether variation in 
amygdala rs-FC relates to development of early-onset internalizing symptoms; and (3) 
evaluate whether prematurity alters amygdala rs-FC and/or modifies relationships between 
amygdala rs-FC and early-onset internalizing symptoms.
METHOD
Participants
VPT infants were recruited from St. Louis Children’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 
FT infants (GA ≥36 weeks) were recruited from the adjoining mother-baby unit at Barnes-
Jewish Hospital from a contemporaneous, companion prospective study evaluating the 
association between electronic fetal heart rate recordings and neonatal brain development.36 
FT infants had no recorded history of in utero illicit substance exposure nor evidence of 
acidosis (pH <7.20) on cord blood gas. Infants with chromosomal abnormalities or 
suspected/proven congenital infection were excluded. Parental written informed consent was 
obtained prior to participation. The study was approved by the Washington University 
Human Studies Committee.
Anatomic MR images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist (J.S.S.) and pediatric neurologist 
(C.D.S.). Exclusion criteria included: grade III–IV intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic 
periventricular leukomalacia, moderate–severe cerebellar hemorrhage, and/or cortical/deep 
nuclear gray matter lesions.37
Data Acquisition
FT infants underwent MRI within the first four days of life and were scanned at a mean 
PMA of 39.4 weeks (±1.2 weeks). VPT infants underwent MRI at term equivalent PMA 
(38.0 weeks, ±1.5 weeks). All infants were imaged without sedation during sleep or while 
resting quietly38 when clinically stable to travel to the MRI scanner. Identical scanning

 procedures were used for all infants. All imaging was performed on a Siemens Trio 3T 
scanner (Erlangen, Germany) utilizing an infant-specific, quadrature head coil (Advanced 
Imaging Research, Cleveland, OH). Structural images were collected using a T2-weighted 
sequence (TR 8600ms; TE 161ms; voxel size 1×1×1mm). rs-fMRI data were collected 
utilizing a gradient echo, echo-planar-image (EPI) sequence sensitized to T2* blood oxygen 
level dependent (BOLD) contrast (TR 2910ms; TE 28ms; voxel size 2.4×2.4×2.4mm; flip 
angle 90°; FOV 151 mm; and matrix size was of 64 x 64). Each fMRI run included 200 
volumes (frames). A minimum of one run (9.6 minutes) was obtained in each infant, with 
additional runs acquired in a subset of participants depending upon tolerance.
Data Analysis
rs-fMRI Preprocessing—rs-fMRI data were preprocessed as previously described 
utilizing in-house software (ftp://imaging.wustl.edu/pub/raichlab/4dfp_tools/).39 
Magnetization inhomogeneity-related distortions were corrected using a mean field map 
technique.40 Atlas transformation was computed using infant templates. Volumetric time 
series in adult Talairach atlas space (3×3×3 mm voxels) were generated, combining motion 
correction and atlas transformation in a single resampling step. Additional preprocessing 
included regression of nuisance waveforms derived from rigid body motion correction, 
cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter regions, plus whole brain global signal. The data were 
low-pass filtered and spatially smoothed (see Supplementary Methods, available online).
Frames affected by sudden change in head position (volume-to-volume head displacement 
≥0.5 mm) or root-mean-squared BOLD signal intensity change (DVARS ≥0.5%) were 
excluded from the rs-fMRI computations (“scrubbing”).41 Data passing more rigorous 
censoring criteria (volume-to-volume head displacement ≥0.25 mm or DVARS ≥0.3%) were 
also analyzed (see Figure S1, available online). A minimum of 5 minutes of rs-fMRI data, 
excluding censored frames, was required for inclusion in the analysis. FT (n=65) infants 
provided an average of 156 frames (±42, range 100–357 frames, ~7.8 minutes, mean FD .
17mm), with 36% of acquired frames censored. VPT infants (n=57) provided an average of 
182 frames (±53, range 102–381 frames, ~9.1 min, mean FD .15), with 24% of acquired 
frames censored.
Amygdala Regions of Interest
Individualized bilateral amygdala regions of interest (ROIs) were created for each 
participant (Figure 1A). T2-weighted images were loaded into ANALYZE version 10.0 
(Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN). The amygdala was identified in the coronal plane using 
adjacent landmarks, including the temporal horn and hippocampus. The ROI was then 
manually drawn in 1×1×1 mm voxel space; ROIs were cross-checked in sagittal and axial 
orientations. These ROIs were reviewed and manually adjusted as needed by a 
neuroradiologist (J.S.S.) and resampled to 3×3×3 mm voxel atlas space for extraction of the 
BOLD timeseries by averaging over all included voxels. There were no significant 
differences in ROI sizes between groups (left amygdala ROI: term 5.6 voxels and preterm 
5.9 voxels, p=.60; right amygdala ROI: term 5.7 voxels and preterm 6.8 voxels, p=.14). Peak 
coordinates were extracted (Talairach x, y, z: left amygdala −23, −7, −18; right amygdala 24, 
−8, −14).

 Functional Connectivity Analyses
Amygdala rs-FC was investigated using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. Using 
individual-specific bilateral amygdala ROIs for each participant, correlation maps were 
computed using Pearson correlations. Correlation coefficients were Fisher z-transformed 
(generating z[r] correlation maps).
Internalizing Symptoms
Forty-one of the 57 VPT participants were enrolled in our longitudinal study, which included 
age 2 neurodevelopmental follow-up. Of the 41, 9 were lost to follow-up, four had 
incomplete data, and one died. Twenty-five FT children with high-quality imaging data were 
selected from the companion study for age 2 assessments to closely match the VPT cohort in 
sex and socioeconomic status (SES). Those with low motion rs-fMRI data were included in 
this analysis (VPT n=27; FT n=17). Age 2 assessments included the Bayley Scales of Infant 
and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III)43 to assess cognitive, language, and 
motor skills and the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)44, a 166-item 
parent-report measure assessing four social-emotional domains (internalizing, externalizing, 
dysregulation, and competence). The ITSEA has good psychometric properties44,45 and has 
been shown to predict anxiety symptoms in later childhood in FT and VPT children.46,47 
This analysis focused on the internalizing domain, which contains subscales assessing 
behavioral inhibition, depression/withdrawal, general anxiety, and separation distress.
Maternal Factors
Maternal factors with reported associations with offspring internalizing symptoms, including 
social disadvantage48 and a maternal history of affective symptoms,49 were examined as 
potential confounds. Maternal social risk was defined by a composite index modeled after 
prior studies.50,51 At 2-year follow-up, the following five characteristics were coded as 1 
(present) or 0 (absent) and summed to yield an index: 1) Not a high school graduate, 2) 
African-American, 3) public insurance at birth, 4) gave birth at age ≤18, and 5) single-parent 
household. When data were missing, the mean of the remaining components was substituted 
for the missing one(s) in calculating the sum as done previously.51 Maternal anxiety and 
depressive symptoms were assessed concurrently at the age 2 evaluation via the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) anxiety subscale52 and the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI)-II, respectively. HADS and BDI scores were dichotomized into none/mild 
or moderate/severe based on published cutoffs. Maternal report of history of depression and 
anxiety disorders was assessed via the Family History Assessment Module.53 Mothers who 
reported a past history of depression or anxiety symptoms (n=5) and/or scored in the 
moderate/severe range (n=20) on the HADS or BDI were classified as having a history of 
affective symptoms.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in demographic and outcome factors were analyzed using t-tests for continuous 
variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Relationships between maternal 
HADS and BDI scores and infant internalizing symptoms were tested via correlations. 
Analyses were conducted with SPSS version 23 (Armonk, NY, USA). Whole-brain voxel-

 wise analyses were performed using in-house software (www.nil.wustl.edu/labs/fidl/). 
Voxel-wise one sample t-tests evaluated amygdala rs-FC across the entire brain. We focused 
on the left amygdala, because left and right amygdala rs-FC is similar18, and left amygdala-
mPFC rs-FC has been more consistently related to affective symptoms in young 
children.17,23 Left amygdala rs-FC results were compared between FT and VPT participants 
using voxel-wise two-tailed two-sample t-tests (assuming unequal variance). All whole-brain 
analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons to achieve a whole-brain false positive rate 
of .05 (see Supplementary Methods, available online).
To examine the relationship between neonatal amygdala rs-FC and outcome at age 2 years, 
we first computed whole-brain correlation maps between rs-FC with the left amygdala and 
the ITSEA internalizing domain. Subsequent whole brain regression models evaluated the 
potential impact of moderating and confounding factors on the link between amygdala rs-FC 
and internalizing symptoms by adding prematurity, child sex, social risk, and maternal 
history of affective symptoms along with their interaction with internalizing symptoms to 
separate models. Whole brain regression models between left amygdala rs-FC and each 
ITSEA internalizing domain subscale were computed. Initially, correlations were computed 
separately for each subscale to minimize over-modeling. To test specificity, a post hoc 
analysis examined the relationships between left amygdala rs-FC and all four internalizing 
subscales in a single linear model to confirm unique relationships to particular subscales.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Demographic characteristics of the FT and VPT infants are presented in Table 1. As 
expected, FT and VPT infants differed in GA and birth weight, but not other demographics 
or maternal variables. Likewise, there were no differences between children with and 
without outcome data at 2 years in sex, GA, birth weight, or PMA at MRI scan. However, a 
higher proportion of Caucasians had outcome data at 2 years relative to African-Americans 
(chi-square=11.1, p=.01). Because Caucasians and African-Americans did not differ in 
outcomes of interest (amygdala rs-FC and ITSEA scores), subsequent analyses were not 
adjusted for race. No differences were detected in internalizing symptoms based upon 
prematurity. There were also no significant associations between child ITSEA internalizing 
scores and maternal HADS scores (r=.16, p=.3) or BDI scores (r=0.05, p=.77).
Amygdala Functional Connectivity in FT and VPT Infants
The left amygdala demonstrated widespread positive correlations with subcortical and 
temporal regions and negative correlations with prefrontal, parietal, and occipital regions 
(Figure 1B and Table S1, available online). Similar patterns in amygdala rs-FC were 
obtained using even more stringent motion correction procedures (see Figure S1, available 
online), using an identical amount of data for each participant (see Figure S2, available 
online) or when using a right amygdala seed (see Figure S3, available online). VPT infants 
displayed largely similar topography of amygdala rs-FC to FT infants, though FT infants 
displayed significantly greater positive correlations between the amygdala and subcortical

 regions (see Table S2, available online) and more negative correlations in dorsal frontal and 
medial prefrontal regions (Figure 1D).
Neonatal Amygdala rs-FC and Age 2 Child Internalizing Symptoms
Whole-brain voxel-wise maps in which neonatal left amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing 
symptoms at age 2 years, as assessed by the ITSEA internalizing domain, are depicted for all 
children in Figure 2A and for VPT children separately in Figure S4, available online. 
Neonatal rs-FC between the left amygdala and several regions was positively associated with 
age 2 internalizing domain scores (Table S3, available online), including the medial 
prefrontal cortex, right anterior insula, superior frontal cortex, caudate, and cerebellum. 
Neonatal rs-FC between the left amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex and pre- and 
postcentral gyri was negatively associated with internalizing domain scores at age 2. These 
relationships were largely maintained when prematurity and the interaction between 
prematurity and internalizing symptoms were added to the model (Figure 2B). The (1) 
regions in which amygdala rs-FC differed between FT and VPT infants and (2) regions in 
which amygdala rs-FC was predictive of age 2 internalizing domain scores were largely non-
overlapping (Figure S5, available online). Further, there were few regions that differentially 
predicted internalizing symptoms in the VPT vs. FT groups (i.e., significant interactions), 
and these regions were almost entirely non-overlapping with the regions related to 
internalizing symptoms in the entire group (Figure S6 and Table S4, available online). Post 
hoc analyses on ROIs detected in these analyses revealed that amygdala rs-FC with these 
ROIs was similar for both FT and VPT infants (Figure S7, available online). Similarly, 
relationships remained significant after adjusting for the potential confounding effects of 
sex, maternal social risk, and history of maternal affective in separate models (Figure S8, 
available online). Similar relationships were not detected between right amygdala rs-FC and 
internalizing symptoms when correcting for multiple comparisons (Figure S9, available 
online).
Follow-up analyses examined associations between neonatal left amygdala rs-FC and each 
of the subscales within the ITSEA internalizing domain at age 2 years. These subscales were 
only weakly or modestly correlated with each other (Table 2). Consistent with known 
pathophysiology in older age groups, neonatal left amygdala rs-FC with the following 
regions was positively related to specific age 2 ITSEA subscale scores (Figure 3): mPFC and 
higher inhibition to novelty; right anterior insula and higher depression/withdrawal and 
general anxiety; and dorsal anterior cingulate and higher general anxiety. Neonatal left 
amygdala rs-FC with the bilateral posterior cingulate cortices was negatively related to 
depression/withdrawal and separation distress; and with the anterior temporal lobe was 
negatively related to depression/withdrawal and general anxiety. A follow-up analysis 
including all four ITSEA internalizing subscale domains in a single model recapitulated the 
results in Figure 3, consistent with subscale specificity (Figure S10, available online).

 DISCUSSION
Summary of Findings
In healthy FT infants, amygdala rs-FC patterns were similar to those of older children and 
adults – positive correlations with subcortical and limbic regions and negative correlations 
with many cortical regions. VPT infants demonstrated similar results but with decreased 
magnitude. Neonatal amygdala rs-FC with regions implicated in the pathophysiology of 
internalizing disorders such as the mPFC, posterior cinculate cortex (PCC), and anterior 
insula predicted internalizing symptoms at age 2 years in all infants. Additionally, there was 
regional specificity of amygdala rs-FC with specific internalizing subscales in a manner 
consistent with pathophysiology in older age groups. Overall, results demonstrate that 
amygdala rs-FC is well-established in neonates, diminished in VPT infants, and predictive of 
internalizing symptoms in the first years of life.
Comparison to Older Populations
Amygdala functional connections in FT neonates were similar to those reported in older 
infants, children, and adults. Specifically, the amygdala was positively correlated with the 
insula, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum,17–20 regions that assign emotional salience to 
stimuli;1,54,55 and negatively correlated with areas across the frontal and parietal cortices, 
regions involved in effortful control of affective states.18,20
Role of Neonatal Amygdala Functional Connectivity in Internalizing Symptoms
Most intriguingly, the current study found that variability in neonatal rs-FC between the left 
amygdala and the mPFC, PCC, and right anterior insula predicted greater internalizing 
symptoms at age 2 years. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and these regions 
has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and depression in older 
children and adults.16,17,21,22 This study critically extends these prior findings to neonates. 
The regional specificity of neonatal left amygdala rs-FC with specific symptom domains at 2 
years is strikingly similar to associations detected in older populations, suggesting rs-FC 
patterns during infancy are relevant to later development of psychopathology. For example, 
left amygdala-right anterior insula rs-FC predicted depression/withdrawal and general 
anxiety symptoms at age 2 years, consistent with rs-FC/symptom relationships detected in 
older infants, children, and adults.16,17,22,23,56,57 Similarly, age 2 depression/withdrawal 
symptoms related to neonatal left amygdala-PCC rs-FC, consistent with prior work in older 
samples.58 The relationship between amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate connectivity and 
later general anxiety symptoms parallels similar findings in older adolescents with 
generalized anxiety disorder.22 Finally, left amygdala-mPFC rs-FC was associated with 
behavioral inhibition. The mPFC is frequently implicated in anxiety disorders,22,59 and 
behavioral inhibition is one of the most potent known risk factors for development of anxiety 
disorders.60,61
Prematurity and Amygdala Functional Connectivity
FT and VPT infants had similar patterns of amygdala rs-FC, though correlations were 
decreased in magnitude in VPT participants, consistent with prior investigations.14,62

 Decreased correlation strength between the amygdala and thalamus (Figure S3, available 
online) may play a role in the decreased rs-FC between the amygdala and cortex through the 
amygdala’s relationship with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, which has widespread 
cortical projections.2 Nevertheless, the cortical regions where the VPT infants had decreased 
magnitude in left amygdala rs-FC were generally not the regions where left amygdala rs-FC 
predicted internalizing symptoms. Thus, our results suggest that variability in regional 
amygdala rs-FC underlies the variability in early childhood internalizing symptoms for both 
FT and VPT children. Further study is needed to determine if neonatal differences in 
amygdala rs-FC relate to internalizing symptoms at older ages or to other domains of social-
emotional development for which VPT children are at increased risk.
The sample size of 122 infants for the amygdala rs-FC analysis is somewhat modest 
compared to investigations in older populations, but larger than most neonatal 
investigations.14,15,62,63 Our sample size was reduced in part due to implementation of strict 
criteria regarding participant motion during MRI data acquisition. Nevertheless, this method 
of motion correction is considered best practice in the field to ensure reliable and robust 
results and reduce spurious findings. Additionally, the small size of the neonatal amygdala 
limits the ability to assess distinct amygdala subdivisions that may demonstrate differing 
patterns,1,2 though there is evidence these amygdala subregions have similar cortical 
connectivity20 and greater regional overlap in rs-FC at younger ages.19 We also cannot fully 
evaluate the impact of sleep on amygdala rs-FC in studied participants.64 Additionally, the 
interpretation of negative connectivity in resting state fMRI analyses remains an active area 
of investigation. Further, the ITSEA relies solely on parental report for identification of 
internalizing symptoms, rather than direct behavioral observation. Finally, while evidence 
suggests that children with early internalizing symptoms remain symptomatic as they 
age,47,65 extending the findings of amygdala rs-FC to evaluations of anxiety symptoms 
during later childhood is required. Future work in this cohort will allow these investigations 
as they are being evaluated longitudinally for psychopathology.
Contrary to a prior report,66 VPT and FT children did not differ on internalizing symptoms 
at age 2 years, and thus prematurity did not mediate relationships between amygdala 
connectivity and internalizing symptoms. Direct comparison reveals that our FT children 
had higher internalizing scores than the FT cohort from this prior work, while scores for 
VPT infants were equivalent across studies. Notably, FT and VPT infants in the prior study 
differed significantly in social risk factors, whereas groups in the current study did not. Both 
our FT and VPT cohorts had a large proportion with children with 3 or more maternal social 
risk factors (41% and 30%, respectively) and had a large proportion of children on Medicaid 
(65% and 48%, respectively). We suggest that our groups did not differ in outcome because 
of the high risk of our comparison (FT) group.
This study demonstrates that patterns of neonatal amygdala rs-FC are similar to those in 
older children and adults. VPT infants have decreased magnitude of amygdala rs-FC, which 
could relate to differential risk profiles in term versus preterm children. Finally, rs-FC of the 
amygdala during the neonatal period predicts internalizing symptoms at age 2 years, with 
regional specificity for specific symptom domains consistent with pathophysiology detected

 at older ages. These results suggest the seeds of future anxious and depressive symptoms for 
some individuals may be detectable at birth using amygdala connectivity patterns.

 Figure 1. 
Amygdala functional connectivity in full-term and preterm neonates. Note: A) Bilateral 
amygdala regions of interest (ROIs) in representative subject, overlaid on subject-specific 
T2-weighted image. B) Group mean amygdala resting state-functional connectivity (rs-FC) 
correlation maps for full-term infants. C) Group mean amygdala rs-FC correlation maps for 
very preterm infants. Both results obtained using left amygdala ROI. Group-level 
significance estimated using individual Fisher z transformed correlation maps and 
computing voxelwise one-sample t-test (comparing z[r] against zero across the group), 
corrected for multiple comparisons. Results overlaid on neonatal atlas target. D) Z scores 
demonstrating group differences in left amygdala rs-FC obtained from voxelwise t-test. Blue 
voxels denote areas with greater negative correlations, and orange voxels denote areas with 
greater positive correlations in term infants. Results thresholded using |Z|>2.25 and 53 
contiguous voxels achieving whole-brain false positive rate of .05.

Relationship between internalizing scores and functional connectivity of left amygdala. 
Note: Whole-brain analyses correlating internalizing domain with left amygdala resting 
state-functional connectivity (rs-FC). A) Unadjusted model demonstrating higher total 
internalizing domain scores were positively correlated with rs-FC between the left amygdala 
and the medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior insula, and superior frontal cortex. B) Model 
adjusted for prematurity and interaction between prematurity and internalizing scores. Note 
that covariate inclusion had limited impact on results. Results thresholded using |Z|>2.25 
and 53 contiguous voxels, achieving whole-brain false positive rate of .05.
