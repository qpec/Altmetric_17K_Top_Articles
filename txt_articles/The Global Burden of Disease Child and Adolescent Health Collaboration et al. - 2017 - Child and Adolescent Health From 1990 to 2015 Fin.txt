 Child and Adolescent Health From 1990 to 2015
Findings From the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries,
and Risk Factors 2015 Study
The Global Burden of Disease Child and Adolescent Health Collaboration
IMPORTANCE Comprehensive and timely monitoring of disease burden in all age groups,
including children and adolescents, is essential for improving population health.
OBJECTIVE To quantify and describe levels and trends of mortality and nonfatal health
outcomes among children and adolescents from 1990 to 2015 to provide a framework for
policy discussion.
EVIDENCE REVIEW Cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes were analyzed for
195 countries and territories by age group, sex, and year from 1990 to 2015 using
standardized approaches for data processing and statistical modeling, with subsequent
analysis of the findings to describe levels and trends across geography and time among
children and adolescents 19 years or younger. A composite indicator of income, education,
and fertility was developed (Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) for each geographic unit and
year, which evaluates the historical association between SDI and health loss.
FINDINGS Global child and adolescent mortality decreased from 14.18 million (95%
uncertainty interval [UI], 14.09 million to 14.28 million) deaths in 1990 to 7.26 million (95%
UI, 7.14 million to 7.39 million) deaths in 2015, but progress has been unevenly distributed.
Countries with a lower SDI had a larger proportion of mortality burden (75%) in 2015 than
was the case in 1990 (61%). Most deaths in 2015 occurred in South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa. Global trends were driven by reductions in mortality owing to infectious, nutritional,
and neonatal disorders, which in the aggregate led to a relative increase in the importance of
noncommunicable diseases and injuries in explaining global disease burden. The absolute
burden of disability in children and adolescents increased 4.3% (95% UI, 3.1%-5.6%) from
1990 to 2015, with much of the increase owing to population growth and improved survival
for children and adolescents to older ages. Other than infectious conditions, many top causes
of disability are associated with long-term sequelae of conditions present at birth (eg,
neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, and hemoglobinopathies) and complications of a
variety of infections and nutritional deficiencies. Anemia, developmental intellectual
disability, hearing loss, epilepsy, and vision loss are important contributors to childhood
disability that can arise from multiple causes. Maternal and reproductive health remains a key
cause of disease burden in adolescent females, especially in lower-SDI countries. In low-SDI
countries, mortality is the primary driver of health loss for children and adolescents, whereas
disability predominates in higher-SDI locations; the specific pattern of epidemiological
transition varies across diseases and injuries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Consistent international attention and investment have led to
sustained improvements in causes of health loss among children and adolescents in many
countries, although progress has been uneven. The persistence of infectious diseases in some
countries, coupled with ongoing epidemiologic transition to injuries and noncommunicable
diseases, require all countries to carefully evaluate and implement appropriate strategies to
maximize the health of their children and adolescents and for the international community to
carefully consider which elements of child and adolescent health should be monitored.

educing mortality among children younger than 5 years
has been a focus of significant international attention
for several decades, beginning with the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, accelerating during the Millennium
Development Goal era, and continuing with the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).1-3 Global progress in reducing
death in children younger than 5 years has been substantial,4
but much less attention has been focused on quantifying and
minimizing mortality burden among older children and
adolescents.5 Likewise, nonfatal health outcomes have
received comparatively little attention despite the fact
that injuries, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), and
acquired chronic conditions with childhood onset pro-
foundly affect long-term health trajectories, future health care
needs, intellectual development, and economic and produc-
tivity prospects.6-8
High return on investment is expected when evidence-
basedinterventionsareimplementedtoaddressthehealthand
well-being of children and adolescents.9 During the past de-
cades, the world experienced rapid economic changes along
with declines in fertility and greater longevity in many coun-
tries, collectively leading to marked changes in global
demographics.10,11 The identification of successes, unmet
needs, and emerging challenges must therefore consider so-
ciodemographicinformationtocontextualizelevelsandtrends
of disease burden.5,12 This information can guide prevention
and intervention efforts, tracking and allocation of resources
forhealthandotheryouth-centricservices(eg,education),and
monitoring progress for countries at all points on the spec-
trum of economic development.
Two comprehensive reports on the burden of diseases and
injuries in young persons were published following the Global
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2013
Study.13,14 The first report covered children and adolescents
19 years or younger; the second described disease burden in
young persons aged 10 to 24 years.15 In the present study—an
extension of GBD 2015—we again focus on children and ado-
lescents 19 years or younger, extending the data to 2015 and
to 195 countries and territories. We present results separately
bysex,describetheepidemiologicfactorsofseveralhighlydis-
abling conditions that arise from multiple GBD causes, report
levels and trends in pregnancy complications among adoles-
cents, and evaluate the association between metrics of dis-
ease burden and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a com-
positeindicatorofdevelopmentstatusgeneratedforGBD2015.
Methods
Detailed methods for each analytic step in GBD 2015 are de-
scribed elsewhere and are compliant with the Guidelines for
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting
(GATHER).4,16-21 Data are available online at the Global Health
Data Exchange (http://ghdx.healthdata.org).
Briefly, we quantified an extensive set of health loss
metrics—with corresponding uncertainty intervals (UIs)—
from 1990 to 2015 for 20 age groups and both sexes in 195
countries and territories. For the present study, we further
analyzed levels and trends for children and adolescents 19
years or younger, which includes the first 7 age groups of
the GBD 2015 analyses. Health loss metrics in this analysis
include all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality (deaths
and years of life lost [YLLs]), nonfatal health outcomes
(prevalence and years lived with disability [YLDs]), and total
disease burden (disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]).
Countries and territories were hierarchically organized into
21 regions and 7 super-regions, which are aggregates of the
21 regions in the GBD location hierarchy. The GBD cause list
organizes all diseases and injuries into a 4-level hierarchy.
The first level has 3 categories: (1) communicable, maternal,
neonatal, and nutritional disorders (group I conditions);
(2) NCDs; and (3) injuries. Level 2 of the hierarchy has 21
cause groups, while levels 3 (166 causes) and 4 (261 causes)
contain more disaggregated causes and cause groups. The
full GBD cause list with corresponding International Classi-
fication of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes is available in
previous publications on cause-specific mortality and non-
fatal health outcomes.16,17
Our all-cause and cause-specific mortality analyses
used systematic approaches to address data challenges such
as variation in both death certification practices and coding
schemes, inconsistent age group reporting, and misclassifi-
cation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS.
Each death was assigned to a single underlying cause.
Cause-of-death ensemble modeling was the most widely
used statistical tool for estimating cause-specific mortality
across GBD 2015. Cause-of-death ensemble modeling uses a
train-test-test approach to evaluate a wide range of families
of statistical models, maximizing out-of-sample predictive
validity of final models. Years of life lost were calculated by
multiplying counts of age-specific death and normative life
expectancy at the age of death.16
Analyses of nonfatal health outcomes used detailed epi-
demiologic data from systematic reviews of the literature,
hospital and claims databases, health surveys, case notifica-
tion systems, cohort studies, and disease-specific registries.
DisMod-MR 2.1, a statistical modeling method developed
in-house, was the most widely used statistical method in
GBD 2015; it is a Bayesian meta-regression tool that synthe-
sizes all available data, adjusting for different case defini-
tions or sampling strategies, to generate internally consis-
Key Points
Question What are the levels and trends of mortality and nonfatal
health loss among children and adolescents from 1990 to 2015?
Findings This study found significant global decreases in all-cause
child and adolescent mortality from 1990 to 2015, but with
increasing global inequality. In countries with a low
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), mortality is the primary driver of
health loss in children and adolescents, largely owing to infectious,
nutritional, maternal, and neonatal causes, while nonfatal health
loss prevails in locations with a higher SDI.
Meaning Nations should evaluate drivers of disease burden
among children and adolescents to aid implementation of
appropriate strategies to maximize the health of populations.

 tent results for prevalence, incidence, remission, and excess
mortality in each population.22 Each most-specific cause
was paired with a variable number of mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive sequelae, which quantify the main
outcomes (including asymptomatic states) of diseases and
injuries and are the units of analysis for nonfatal health out-
comes. Years lived with disability were calculated as the
product of sequela-specific prevalence and corresponding
GBD disability weights derived from population surveys
with more than 60 000 respondents.23,24 Disability weights
were assumed to be invariant by geography, but the distribu-
tion of sequelae—and therefore cumulative disability per
case—varies by geography, year, sex, and age. Finally, we
adjusted for comorbid illness using a microsimulation
framework within each population and proportionally
adjusting YLDs for each comorbid condition. Disability-
adjusted life years are the sum of YLLs and YLDs.17
We developed the SDI for GBD 2015, as described previ-
ously, to characterize epidemiologic transitions more
robustly than is possible with analyses based only on
income.4,16-19 The SDI is a composite measure of develop-
mental status as it is associated with health, calculated as
the geometric mean of the following 3 indicators: total rate
of fertility, log income per capita, and mean years of educa-
tion among those 15 years or older. Socio-demographic
Index scores were scaled from 0 (highest fertility, lowest
income, and lowest education) to 1 (highest income, highest
education, and lowest fertility), and each geographical unit
was assigned an SDI score for each year. We analyzed the
average association between SDI score and all-ages rates of
YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs for all level 2 and level 3 causes. For
comparisons across SDI quintiles, each geographical unit
was assigned to a single quintile according to its SDI in 2015
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
For all results, 95% UIs were derived from 1000 draws
of the posterior distribution at each analytic step and repre-
sent the ordinal 25th and 975th draws. Unlike confidence
intervals, which capture only sampling error, UIs provide a
means of also capturing other sources of uncertainty owing
to model specification (eg, parameter selection) and estima-
tion (eg, data adjustments from nonreference categories and
β values for covariates). Cumulative and annualized rates of
change were calculated on point estimates, and correspond-
ing UIs were derived from the same calculations performed
at the draw level.
We present results as both total numbers to illustrate
the absolute magnitude of burden, and all-age rates, to com-
pare across geographical areas with differently sized popu-
lations. We completed age standardization for ages 19 years
or younger for the 10 highest-ranked global causes of death
and disability to help compare across populations with dif-
ferent age structures; all other results are presented as total
number and all-ages rates only. Results for the global level,
along with SDI quintile and region in order of decreasing
SDI, are presented in the main article. Results for each coun-
try and territory are contained in the Supplement and are
available online at http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-

Results
All-Cause Mortality and Cause-Specific Mortality
in Children and Adolescents
Total deaths and the age-standardized mortality rate (per
100 000 population) for all causes combined, as well as the 10
largest level 3 causes of death globally, are shown for children
andadolescents19yearsoryoungerin1990and2015inTable1.
Corresponding country-level results, with uncertainty and cu-
mulative percent change, are in eTable 1 in the Supplement for
children and adolescents 19 years or younger and eTable 2 in
the Supplement for children and adolescents 5 years or
younger. In 2015, there were 7.26 million (95% UI, 7.14 mil-
lion to 7.39 million) deaths among children and adolescents
globally,ofwhich5.82million(95%UI,5.69millionto5.95mil-
lion) occurred among children younger than 5 years, 463 000
(95% UI, 453 000-473 000) among those aged 5 to 9 years,
391 000 (95% UI, 383 000-402 000) among children aged 10
to 14 years, and 588 000 (95% UI, 567 000-610 000) among
those aged 15 to 19 years.
As can be seen in Table 1, mortality in children and ado-
lescents 19 years or younger decreased in all SDI quintiles, but
inequality increased. Nearly 75% of all deaths among chil-
drenandadolescentsin2015occurredinthe2lowestSDIquin-
tiles (compared with 61% in 1990), while only 1.6% occurred
in the highest SDI quintile (compared with 2.1% in 2015). Age-
standardized rates of death declined from 1990 to 2015 at simi-
lar rates of 55% and 56% in the 2 lowest and highest SDI quin-
tiles, respectively, while they declined by 63% in middle and
high-middle SDI quintiles. South Asia accounted for 2.21 mil-
lion (95% UI, 2.15 million to 2.27 million) child and adoles-
cent deaths, 30.4% of the global total and the most of any re-
gion. Next were Western sub-Saharan Africa (1.68 million; 95%
UI, 1.61 million to 1.76 million [23.1%]), Eastern sub-Saharan
Africa (1.11 million; 95% UI, 1.07 million to 1.14 million [15.3%]),
North Africa and the Middle East (529 000; 95% UI, 499 000-
562 000[7.3%]),andcentralsub-SaharanAfrica(463 000;95%
UI, 408 000-524 000 [6.4%]). Geographical patterns of mor-
tality in children younger than 5 years were similar to those
in children and adolescents 19 years or younger but with a
slightly greater concentration of mortality burden in the 2 low-
est SDI quintiles (77% of total). Mortality rates (per 100 000
population) varied from a low of 26.0 (95% UI, 25.1-26.8) in
the high-income Asia Pacific region to a high of 666 (95% UI,
638-696)inWesternsub-SaharanAfricaamongallchildrenand
adolescents 19 years or younger and from 58.8 (95% UI, 55.8-
61.8) in the high-income Asia Pacific region to 2133 (95% UI,
2029-2245) in Western sub-Saharan Africa for children 5 years
or younger in 2015.
Cause-Specific Mortality
As seen in Table 1 across the entire age range, rankings were
dominated by those affecting the youngest children. Glob-
ally, the most common causes of death were neonatal pre-
term birth complications (mortality rate, 31.4 per 100 000
population; 95% UI, 29.1-34.2 deaths per 100 000 popula-
tion), lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) (31.1; 95% UI,

and trauma (28.8; 95% UI, 26.5-31.5), diarrheal diseases (22.4;
95% UI, 20.5-24.2), congenital anomalies (21.3; 95% UI, 19.7-
23.1), malaria (21.0; 95% UI, 16.2-25.6), neonatal sepsis (13.7;
95% UI, 10.7-16.7), other neonatal disorders (8.6; 95% UI, 7.4-
10.3), meningitis (8.7; 95% UI, 6.8-10.4), and HIV and AIDS (8.1;
95% UI, 7.8-8.3). With the exception of the infectious causes
(malaria, diarrheal diseases, and meningitis) each cause was
highly ranked in all regions.
Rankings of the 25 leading level 3 causes of death among
children and adolescents 19 years or younger, disaggregated
by sex, are shown in Figure 1. Besides the causes listed above,
others ranking in the top 10 in specific regions included he-
moglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias (in Western sub-
Saharan Africa, where sickle cell disease is the largest level 4
cause of hemoglobinopathies), as well as selected infections
(measles, HIV and AIDS, whooping cough, intestinal infec-
tious disease, sexually transmitted infections excluding HIV
[ie, congenital syphilis], and encephalitis) and injuries (drown-
ing, road injuries, direct effects of war [ie, collective vio-
lence] and natural disasters, exposure to mechanical forces,
aspiration of a foreign body, and fire).
Differences in Causes of Death by Geography, Age, and Sex
We found important differences in mortality patterns for each
of the 7 component age groups 19 years or younger in 2015
(eFigure 2A-G in the Supplement). During the neonatal pe-
riod (ie, 6 days or less and 7-27 days), rankings across SDI quin-
tiles and regions were broadly similar; mortality was domi-
nated by neonatal complications, congenital anomalies, and
LRIs. Divergence began to appear during the postneonatal pe-
riod (ie, 28-364 days), when acquired infections such as LRIs,
diarrhea, malaria, and meningitis predominated in lower-SDI
geographical areas and congenital anomalies and sudden
infantdeathsyndromepredominatedinhigher-SDIgeographi-
cal areas. Protein-energy malnutrition also emerged as an
important cause of death in the postneonatal period in sev-
eral regions, especially in males, a trend that continued into
children aged 1 to 4 years, where it ranked fourth globally in
both sexes. Malaria, LRIs, and diarrhea were the 3 highest-
ranked causes of death in children aged 1 to 4 years; because
protein-energy malnutrition and other forms of malnutrition
raise the mortality risk for each, the effect of malnutrition is
even higher than that reflected in results for protein-energy
malnutrition alone. Geographic heterogeneity was also ob-
served in other causes of death in children aged 1 to 4 years
for both females and males at the global level, including
measles (concentrated in the lowest 3 SDI quintiles, particu-
larly Oceania and Southeast Asia), leukemia, road injuries, and
drowning (all concentrated in the 3 highest SDI quintiles).
Geographical differences in causes of death in 2015 were
morepronouncedwithincreasingage(ie,5-9years,10-14years,
and 15-19 years). Congenital anomalies and cancers (leuke-
mia, brain cancer, and other neoplasms [eg, sarcomas]) were
highly ranked in high-SDI regions in all age groups, simulta-
neously reflecting continued risk of mortality beyond the time
of initial diagnosis and lower overall risk of mortality in the
population. Intestinal infectious disease was highly ranked
globally (second in children aged 5-9 years for both males and
females), driven primarily by very large mortality numbers in
South Asia and Southeast Asia. Human immunodeficiency vi-
rus and AIDS rose to be ranked first globally among children
aged 10 to 14 years, driven almost entirely by epidemics in the
Caribbeanandsub-SaharanAfrica.Diarrhea,LRIs,malaria,and
protein-energy malnutrition remained important causes of
death throughout all age groups but were largely limited ex-
cept in geographical areas with lower SDIs. Five level 3 causes
of maternal mortality—hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders,
indirect causes, other direct causes, and the combined cat-
egory of abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and miscarriage—were
in the top 25 causes of maternal mortality globally in females
aged 15 to 19 years, reflecting the high burden of maternal mor-
tality among adolescents in the 2 lowest SDI quintiles.
The ranking of injuries as causes of death increased con-
sistently with age and with increasing SDI; all injuries except
self-harm ranked higher in males than females. Road injuries
were the leading injury-associated cause of death in all age
groups, rising to first globally among all causes for both sexes
in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. Drowning was the next high-
est-ranked cause of injury-associated death in children aged
5 to 9 years (ninth overall among females and sixth among
males) and 10 to 14 years (eighth overall in females and third
in males), while self-harm (second overall in females and third
in males) and interpersonal violence (14th overall in females
and second in males) were the next most common injury-
associated causes of death among adolescents aged 15 to 19
years. The direct mortality burden of war was extremely large
in North Africa and the Middle East, where it ranked second
for each sex among children aged 1 to 4 years and first in all
subsequent age groups in 2015.
Leading Causes of Nonfatal Health Outcomes
in Children and Adolescents
Totalprevalentcasesandtheage-standardizedprevalencerate
(per 100 000 population) for all causes combined, as well as
the 10 leading level 3 causes with the most YLDs globally, are
shown for children and adolescents 19 years or younger in
Table2.Correspondingcountry-levelresultsfor1990and2015,
with uncertainty and mean annualized rates of change, are in
eTable 3 in the Supplement for children and adolescents 19
years or younger and eTable 4 in the Supplement for children
5 years or younger. In 2015, nonfatal health outcomes caused
154 million (95% UI, 117 million to 196 million) YLDs among
children and adolescents, of which 33.3 million (95% UI, 23.5
millionto45.3million)wereinchildren5yearsoryounger,35.0
million (95% UI, 24.9 million to 47.4 million) in those aged 5
to 9 years, 40.9 million (95% UI, 29.8 million to 54.9 million)
in those aged 10 to 14 years, and 44.4 million (95% UI,
32.9 million to 58.0 million) in those aged 15 to 19 years.
Iron-deficiency anemia was the highest-ranking level 3
cause of YLDs in children and adolescents, followed by skin
and subcutaneous diseases, asthma, hemoglobinopathies and
hemolytic anemias, diarrheal diseases, congenital anoma-
lies, protein-energy malnutrition, epilepsy, malaria, and neo-
natal complications of preterm birth. Among children 5 years
or younger, there was higher relative importance of disability

Ranking of causes of death in females and males. Global causes, SDI quintiles,
and GBD regions appear in columns, sorted in order of decreasing SDI status.
The causes are sorted according to their ranking at the global level. The color
coding indicates the relative ranking of each cause, with red the highest and
green the lowest. The numbers appearing in each column indicate the
geography-specific ranking of that cause in 2015. Blanks indicate causes that
were not contracted in that geographical area. HIV indicates human
immunodeficiency virus.

cal areas.
Disability Burden From Conditions With Multiple Causes
Many clinical conditions cause significant disease burden in
childrenandadolescents,butbecausetheycanarisefrommul-
tiple causes, their effect is not obvious when examining causes
of GBD. Examples that would be in the top 10 global causes of
YLDs if considered alone are anemia, developmental intellec-
tual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss, and vision loss. For ex-
ample, while iron-deficiency anemia was the leading level 3
cause of disability, it accounted for only about two-thirds of
total anemia in children and adolescents 19 years or younger
in 2015 (eTable 5 in the Supplement), and each case tended to
be less severe than other etiologic causes of anemia. Infec-
tious diseases, hemoglobinopathies, malaria, hookworm, gy-
necologic conditions, and gastritis and duodenitis were other
important causes of anemia in children and adolescents. Neo-
natal disorders were the most common nonidiopathic cause
of both developmental intellectual disability (eTable 6 in the
Supplement) and epilepsy (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Autism, iodine deficiency, and congenital disorders were im-
portant causes of intellectual disability, while much of the rest
of intellectual disability and much of nonidiopathic epilepsy
were secondary to infectious causes, especially malaria and
meningitis. Hearing and vision loss also contributed to the dis-
ease burden within children and adolescents 19 years or
younger, with age-associated and other hearing loss account-
ing for most hearing loss burden (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). For vision loss, a range of causes contributed to the bur-
den among children and adolescents 19 years or younger,
including neonatal disorders and nutritional deficiencies
(eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Pregnancy Complications in Adolescents
Mortality was the primary driver of health loss owing to mater-
nal disorders in adolescents. The global maternal mortality ra-
tio per 100 000 live births was 278 (95% UI, 229-339) and 142
(95% UI, 123-166) in 2015 for children and adolescents aged 10
to14and15to19years,respectively,causing1343(95%UI,1105-
1640) and 26 855 (95% UI, 23 254-31 521) maternal deaths. Both
agegroupshadamaternalmortalityratiohigherthantheglobal
aggregate of 132 (95% UI, 117-153) seen in women aged 25 to 29
years(eTable10intheSupplementandGBD2015maternalmor-
tality publication18). The mean annualized decline in the ma-
ternalmortalityratioamongadolescentsaged10to19yearswas
only 1.4% (95% UI, 0.8%-2.0%), which was slower than the
global improvement rate of 2.6% for overall maternal mortal-
ity. Maternal hemorrhage was the highest-ranked level 3 cause
of maternal mortality globally, driven largely by its promi-
nence in low-SDI geographical areas where teenage pregnancy
and the burden of maternal mortality are the highest (eFigures
3 and 4 in the Supplement). Other top-ranked causes of mater-
nal mortality included maternal hypertensive disorders, other
directmaternaldisorders(eg,pulmonaryembolism,cardiomy-
opathy,andsurgicalandanestheticcomplications),andthecom-
bined category of abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and/or miscar-
riage. The risk of nonfatal complications during pregnancy is
also higher in adolescents than in women in their 20s (eFigure
5 in the Supplement). Abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and/or mis-
carriage is the most common disabling outcome of pregnancy
among adolescents, followed by maternal hemorrhage, mater-
nal hypertensive disorders, maternal sepsis and other mater-
nal infections, and obstructed labor.
Ranking and Trends of DALYs in Children and Adolescents
Rankingofthe25leadinglevel3causesofDALYsin1990,2005,
and 2015, along with the changes in total number, all-ages rate,
and age-standardized rate, are shown in Figure 2 for children
andadolescents19yearsoryounger.CorrespondingDALYrank-
ings disaggregated by SDI quintile are in eFigure 6A-E in the
Supplement. Between 1990 and 2005, more than 40% de-
clines in DALYs in children and adolescents 19 years or younger
wereseenforLRIs,diarrhealdiseases,measles,tetanus,drown-
ing, and neonatal hemolytic disease and other neonatal jaun-
dice; similar declines between 2005 and 2015 were seen for
malaria, measles, tetanus, and neonatal hemolytic disease and
other neonatal jaundice. The most significant increase was for
HIV and AIDS, which increased by close to 600% to rank 11th
globally in 2005, a ranking that stayed largely static through
2015 despite a nearly 30% drop in DALYs from 2005 to 2015.
Malariaandiron-deficiencyanemiaweretheothergroupIcon-
ditions with significantly increased DALYs between 1990 and
2005; DALYs for both conditions also subsequently de-
creased significantly by 2015. Several NCDs increased in rank-
ing from 1990 to 2015 for children and adolescents 19 years or
younger. Some diseases—including congenital anomalies,
asthma, and hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias—
increased in ranking despite registering decreased age-
standardizedDALYratesforeachtimeperiod.Incontrast,other
causes—including sense organ diseases, skin diseases, and
mentalandsubstanceabusedisorderssuchasdepression,anxi-
ety, and conduct disorder—increased in ranking with largely
unchanged or slightly increased global age-standardized DALY
rates from 1990 to 2015. Road injuries and drowning were the
2 highest-ranking injuries in terms of DALYs despite signifi-
cant decreases from 1990 to 2015.
SDI and Epidemiologic Transition
in Children and Adolescents
Figure 3A shows the mean association between SDI and cause-
specific YLLs and YLDs from 1990 to 2015 for all level 2 causes.
Nonlinearity of associations at times followed the nonlinear-
ity of the SDI itself. There is a clear and substantial downward
gradientinchildandadolescenthealthlosswithincreasingSDI.
Years of life lost are the dominant component of DALYs in the
geographical areas with the lowest SDI, a trend that contin-
ues until an SDI of roughly 0.80, after which YLDs become re-
sponsible for a larger proportion of DALYs. There is also a clear
increase in the all-ages rate of YLDs in the geographical areas
withthehighestSDItothepointwhere,atthehighestSDI,67%
of all DALYs are owing to nonfatal health outcomes. Figure 3B

 shows the corresponding information displayed as a propor-
tion of total rates of YLL and YLD owing to each level 2 cause
at each SDI level. For most level 2 causes, the proportion of all
YLLs owing to group I causes decreases with increasing SDI.
The exceptions are neonatal disorders and HIV and AIDS and
tuberculosis, which increased in relative importance with in-
creasing SDI. In the geographical areas with the highest SDI,
self-harm and interpersonal violence, other NCDs, and
neoplasms were responsible for an increasing proportion of
YLLs. The proportion of YLDs owing to group I causes simi-
larly decreased with increasing SDI, while the proportion ow-
ing to NCDs generally increased. Most level 3 causes followed
this same pattern, with 2 notable exceptions among the top
causes of child and adolescent DALYs: congenital anomalies

This figure shows the rankings for the top 25 causes of global disability-adjusted
life years among children and adolescents 19 years or younger at the global level
in 1990, 2005, and 2015. Lines connecting the boxes illustrate changes in
ranking. Any cause that appears in the top 25 in any year is listed, along with its
ranking during each year. Group I causes (infectious, neonatal, nutritional, and
maternal) are shown in gray, noncommunicable diseases in red, and injuries in
green. Changes in total DALYs are in the first column next to 2005, followed by
changes in all-ages rates of DALYs, and age-standardized rates of DALYs.
Statistically significant differences appear in bold. HIV indicates human
immunodeficiency virus, and STI, sexually transmitted infection.

 (eFigure 7A in the Supplement) and neonatal disorders (eFig-
ure7BintheSupplement).Forcongenitalanomalies,therewas
a consistent decrease in the rate of YLLs, with increasing SDI
for all causes, but increases in the rate of YLDs for most level
3 congenital anomalies, especially congenital heart anoma-
lies and other congenital anomalies. For neonatal disorders,
increasing SDI was associated with consistent improvements

neonatal disorders but not for preterm birth complications.
Rates of DALYs for preterm birth complications increased ini-
tially, and there was little suggestion of further improvement
beyondanSDIof0.85foranyneonataldisorder,especiallypre-
term birth complications.

(eFigure 8A-V in the Supplement). Exceptions were the level 3
causes that consistently increased with increasing SDI—
musculoskeletal and mental and substance abuse disor-
ders—as well as those that either peaked in high-middle and
middle SDI or improved only marginally until the highest SDI
levels—asthma, epilepsy, migraine, road injuries, self-harm,
interpersonal violence, and neoplasms such as leukemia, lym-
phoma, brain cancer, and other neoplasms. Sex differences
were notable in that some conditions, such as neonatal disor-
ders, neoplasms, nutritional deficiencies, hemoglobinopa-
thies and hemolytic anemias, epilepsy, and all categories of in-
juries,hadhigherall-agesratesofDALYsinmales,whileothers,
such as migraine, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal

Discussion
Wefoundwidespreadreductionsintotaldiseaseburdenamong
children and adolescents, but progress has been unequal. In
2015,anevengreatershareofglobalmortalityburdenwascon-
centrated in the lowest-SDI countries than it was in 1990, and
there has been a significant increase in the global proportion
of nonfatal disease burden. Global reductions in disease bur-
den from infectious, neonatal, maternal, and nutrition-
associated causes have been accompanied by a growing im-
portance of NCDs and injuries. Neonatal disorders and
congenital anomalies remain large and, in some cases, grow-
ingproblemsinmanycountries.Nutritionaldeficiencies,along
with infections such as HIV and AIDS, diarrhea, LRIs, ma-
laria, intestinal infectious diseases, and vaccine-preventable
diseases, also still cause enormous health loss in some coun-
tries. Some populations of children and adolescents have been
struck by the massive effect of war on health, while others are
struggling with the detrimental effects of road injuries, drown-
ing,self-harm,andinterpersonalviolence,andthegrowingim-

bound targets for improving health, the environment, and so-
cietal development. By design, the SDG agenda is broader than
the Millennium Development Goal framework, in which there
was only one child target (Millennium Development Goal 4:
reduce mortality by two-thirds in children younger than 5
years). By broadening the agenda and shifting to absolute tar-
gets,theSDGsprovideanexcellentstartingpointtojudgeprog-
ress at the country level and should rightfully focus attention
onthecountrieswiththemostprogressyettoachieve.25Track-
ing the entire spectrum of disease in children and adoles-
cents facilitates monitoring of the SDGs but can also high-
light non-SDG health challenges, and it should be used to
inform final decision making with respect to SDG indicators.
Besides neonatal mortality and mortality in children
younger than 5 years,3 other health-associated SDGs are im-
portant for understanding disease burden in children and ado-
lescents given the age pattern of these conditions. Examples
include infection-associated SDG targets addressing malaria,
HIV and tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, severe mal-
nutrition,andaccesstosafewater,sanitation,andhygiene.Our
analysisshowsthattheseSDGindicatorsareimprovingforchil-
dren and adolescents in most geographical areas. Sustainable
Development Goals focusing on reproductive health targets
such as maternal mortality, adolescent fertility, universal ac-
cess to modern contraception, skilled birth attendance, and
neonatal support services are also an important part of the dis-
cussion about child and adolescent health loss given the con-
tinued importance of teenage pregnancy, pregnancy-
associatedcomplications,andmaternaldeathinmanysettings
aswellastheintricatelinksbetweenmaternalandchildhealth.
Many of the injury-associated SDG targets also are relevant to
tracking child health progress, including those on disaster pre-
paredness, road injuries, poisoning, self-harm, interpersonal
violence, and war.
Most of the SDG targets addressing NCDs, such as those
associated with mental health conditions and cardiovascular
diseases, not only focus on NCDs that are primarily problems
in adults but also specifically exclude children and adoles-
cents. This exclusion is problematic, especially because of the
growing importance found in our study of mental health, sub-
stance abuse, and self-harm among children and adoles-
cents. Half of all mental illnesses begin by age 14 years and
three-quarters begin by the mid-20s. If untreated, these con-
ditionscanpredisposetoself-harmandseverelyinfluencechil-

fulfillmentandeconomicpotential.26OtherSDGs,suchasthose
addressing education and sex equality, are not specifically as-
sociated with health but can have a significant effect on the
health of children and adolescents.
One possible explanation for growing inequality in dis-
ease burden among children and adolescents is that many of
the geographical areas with the lowest SDIs have not histori-
cally been significant recipients of development assistance
for health (DAH).27,28 Although development assistance for
child and newborn health has been among the fastest-
growing focus areas of DAH since 1990 and is one of the few
areas in which funding has continued to increase since 2010,
it has been uneven. For example, most countries in Central and
Western sub-Saharan Africa received less than half the DAH

 per all-cause DALY in 2010 to 2012 received by countries in
Southern sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and
Central Latin America.29 Many DAH programs have concen-
trated on funding widespread delivery of proven preventive
measures, including vaccines; nutritional support; maternal
education; improved water, sanitation, and hygiene; and treat-
ment of diarrhea, LRIs, and HIV and AIDS. Synergistic mater-
nal health programs have also enjoyed strong support during
this period. These programs must continue and be ex-
panded,especiallyinlow-SDIsettingsinwhichprogressinchild
and adolescent health has been comparatively slow, but fo-
cus must also be turned to strengthening health systems,
especially in geographical areas in which such systems are un-
derdeveloped or have been weakened by conflict.
Thisfindingleadstoanotherpossibleexplanationforgrow-
ing inequality; namely, that there has been inadequate focus
on increasing local health system capacity and capabilities.
High-SDI settings have seen improved prevention and better
outcomes for many childhood illnesses, such as neonatal dis-
orders, as well as many congenital birth defects, injuries, and
cancers, such as leukemia. Improved treatment has led to in-
creasingnumbersofchildrennowreachingadulthoodwithon-
going medical needs.30-34 These medical advances have not
been as readily realized in geographical areas with lower SDIs
or in older children and adolescents.35,36 Sustained invest-
ment is needed to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treat-
ment for causes not traditionally targeted by DAH, including
strengthening of workforces and facilities,37-39 cooperation
between health centers in the same region,40 clinician
specialization,41-44 improved surgical and anesthetic care,34
evidence-based case management for life-threatening
complications,45,46 injury prevention, and active screening to
identify and treat high-risk children (eg, those with congeni-
tal heart disease47-49 and hemoglobinopathies50,51). Integra-
tion of health care services across facilities and specialties to
meet the varied needs of children and adolescents is para-
mount to successful intervention programs, especially in geo-
graphical areas with middle SDIs where there is a high likeli-
hood of comorbid NCDs, injuries, and group I conditions.
Indeed, the World Health Organization Global Strategy for
Women’
s, Children’
s, and Adolescents’Health (2016-2030)9
addresses both explanations for growing inequality. In addi-
tion to advocating for programs supported by DAH, it recom-
mends specific actions to address the interplay between en-
vironment, economics, and health through multisector action
including investments and policy implementation, leader-
ship engagement at regional and country levels, and building
resilience of health systems through workforce develop-
ment, human capital investment, sex equality, and youth em-
powerment.
One aspect of child and adolescent health that is not com-
prehensively addressed by the World Health Organization
Global Strategy for Women’
s, Children’
s, and Adolescents’
Health (2016-2030)9 is injuries. Minimizing the burden of in-
juries in children and adolescents requires the implementa-
tion of specific prevention policies where they do not exist and
support for treatment and rehabilitation of injured youth. First
and foremost, this implementation necessitates strict limita-
tions on child labor and elimination of child slavery.52 To re-
duce suicide, Sri Lanka and South Korea have both restricted
the availability of pesticides with good effect,53,54 while Aus-
tralia has taken the step of implementing comprehensive
mental health screening and treatment.55 Along with suicide,
interpersonal violence may be partially addressed via imple-
mentation of more stringent gun regulations,56 although many
other social, demographic, and societal factors, such as pov-
erty, education, and drug use, also must be addressed in poli-
cies aimed at reducing homicide.57,58 Road injuries, falls, and
interpersonal violence are common etiologic causes of trau-
matic brain injury, a condition that can have significant mor-
tality and morbidity.59,60 Policies requiring seat belts, appro-
priate use of car seats, and helmets for cyclists can greatly
reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury following road
injuries.61 Timely hospital care and ongoing rehabilitation ser-
vices are necessary to minimize the long-term health burden
of traumatic brain injury,62,63 although optimal approaches are
still in development.64
In addition to effective medical programs, comprehen-
sivecommunity-basedapproachesareneededtomaximizethe
development and empowerment of children and adolescents
at the population level. One approach that could serve as a
model—andmaybepossibleinmanyhigh-SDIcountries—isthe
HealthyChild,HealthyFuturecampaigninNorthernIreland.65
The central tenet of the program is to promote a shift from an
approach to child health that relies on medical screening to
identify children with treatable conditions to an approach that
also emphasizes promotion of general health, primary pre-
vention of diseases and injuries, and active intervention for
children at risk. Involving parents, schools, and communities
in this effort is seen as a crucial part because they are the en-
tities who have the most influence on the physical and social
environment of children, and their own personal behaviors are
likely to have a direct effect on children in their care.
Limitations
This analysis has several limitations. First, it is based on the
GBD 2015 study results and is therefore subject to the same
potential problems as the overall study, including variations
in availability and quality of data, variations in coding prac-
tices, delays in release of data after their collection, paucity of
data following conflict and natural disasters, and incomplete
informationorpotentialunderreportingonnonfatalhealthout-
comes in many geographical areas. Despite potential limita-
tions, drawing conclusions on levels of and trends in child and
adolescent health loss from this central study at least ensures
that comparisons are all internally consistent with one an-
other. Second, in this study we concentrated on only the lead-
ing global causes of fatal and nonfatal health loss in the ag-
gregate age groups of children and adolescents 19 years or
younger. This approach allows reporting on general patterns
of health loss in children and adolescents, but given that child-
hood is a period of rapid development and change, it does not
highlight less common conditions and may obscure some age-
specificandgeography-specificsubtletiesofepidemiologicfac-
tors of disease and injury. Third, data availability for children
aged 5 to 14 years is not as robust as that for those 5 years or

 younger and individuals aged 15 to 19 years. Estimates of all-
cause mortality were thus based primarily on extensive data
sources in children 5 years or younger and individuals aged 15
to 19 years, with estimates for intervening age groups derived
from a large collection of empirical life tables and use of sur-
vivalhistorydatafromsurveysandcensuses.16Wefoundbroad
agreement between our all-cause mortality estimates and pri-
mary data sources from the Sample Registration System and
Demographic and Health Surveys in India, which supports the
GBD findings. Hill and colleagues66 have argued against this
approach on the basis that it could underestimate mortality in
populations in which interventions targeted at children 5 years
or younger have not also led to improved survival in children
aged 5 to 14 years. The implication is that such underestima-
tion would dilute the perceived importance of causes that dis-
proportionately affect children older than 5 years (eg, inju-
ries, NCDs, and maternal disorders), but even if that were the
case, it should have minimal effect on the interpretation of lev-
els and trends within each age group or country. Fourth, given
the geography-centric approach to GBD analyses, we have lim-
ited ability to evaluate disease burden in subpopulations that
are not geographically based, such as refugees and many in-
digenous peoples. Fifth, while GBD 2015 has analyzed the total
burden and underlying etiologic causes of several broad con-
ditions, such as anemia and developmental intellectual dis-
ability, there are others that may be particularly important in
children and adolescents that have not received the same level
of scrutiny, including, for example, traumatic brain injury, hy-
drocephalus, and sepsis. Sixth, our quantification of disease

Conclusions
Timely, robust, and comprehensive assessment of disease bur-
denamongchildrenandadolescentsprovidesinformationthat
is essential to health policy decision making in countries at all
points along the spectrum of economic development. Under-
standing the burden of disease and how it is changing helps
identify context-specific successes, unmet needs, and future
challenges. Child and adolescent health has dramatically im-
proved from 1990 to 2015 throughout the world. Interna-
tional attention and investment have led to improvements in
manyinfectiousandnutritionaldiseases,butprogresshasbeen
uneven. The burden of disease during childhood and adoles-
cence is now even more concentrated in lower-SDI countries
and territories than it was a generation ago, and there is an on-
going epidemiologic transition with a growing relative bur-
den of NCDs and injuries. If we are going to continue the cur-
rent pace of improvement in child and adolescent health, we
