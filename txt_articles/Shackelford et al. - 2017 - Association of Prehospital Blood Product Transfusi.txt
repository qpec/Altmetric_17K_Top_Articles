IMPORTANCE Prehospital blood product transfusion in trauma care remains controversial due
to poor-quality evidence and cost. Sequential expansion of blood transfusion capability after
2012 to deployed military medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) units enabled a concurrent cohort
study to focus on the timing as well as the location of the initial transfusion.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of prehospital transfusion and time to initial
transfusion with injury survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of US military combat
casualties in Afghanistan between April 1, 2012, and August 7, 2015. Eligible patients were
rescued alive by MEDEVAC from point of injury with either (1) a traumatic limb amputation at
or above the knee or elbow or (2) shock defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90
mm Hg or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute.
EXPOSURES Initiation of prehospital transfusion and time from MEDEVAC rescue to first
transfusion, regardless of location (ie, prior to or during hospitalization). Transfusion recipients
were compared with nonrecipients (unexposed) for whom transfusion was delayed or not given.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality at 24 hours and 30 days after MEDEVAC rescue
were coprimary outcomes. To balance injury severity, nonrecipients of prehospital
transfusion were frequency matched to recipients by mechanism of injury, prehospital shock,
severity of limb amputation, head injury, and torso hemorrhage. Cox regression was stratified
by matched groups and also adjusted for age, injury year, transport team, tourniquet use, and
time to MEDEVAC rescue.
RESULTS Of 502 patients (median age, 25 years [interquartile range, 22 to 29 years]; 98%
male), 3 of 55 prehospital transfusion recipients (5%) and 85 of 447 nonrecipients (19%) died
within 24 hours of MEDEVAC rescue (between-group difference, −14% [95% CI, −21% to
−6%]; P = .01). By day 30, 6 recipients (11%) and 102 nonrecipients (23%) died
(between-group difference, −12% [95% CI, −21% to −2%]; P = .04). For the 386 patients
without missing covariate data among the 400 patients within the matched groups, the
adjusted hazard ratio for mortality associated with prehospital transfusion was 0.26 (95% CI,
0.08 to 0.84, P = .02) over 24 hours (3 deaths among 54 recipients vs 67 deaths among 332
matched nonrecipients) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.92, P = .03) over 30 days (6 vs 76
deaths, respectively). Time to initial transfusion, regardless of location (prehospital or during
hospitalization), was associated with reduced 24-hour mortality only up to 15 minutes after
MEDEVAC rescue (median, 36 minutes after injury; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.04
to 0.73], P = .02; there were 2 deaths among 62 recipients vs 68 deaths among 324 delayed
transfusion recipients or nonrecipients).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among medically evacuated US military combat causalities in
Afghanistan, blood product transfusion prehospital or within minutes of injury was associated
with greater 24-hour and 30-day survival than delayed transfusion or no transfusion. The
findings support prehospital transfusion in this setting.

was to evaluate US military experience with prehospital blood
product transfusion on MEDEVAC aircraft in Afghanistan, di-
rectly addressing the deficiencies in the literature.
Methods
Design and Study Setting
In 2012, prehospital transfusion capability for combat casu-
altiesinAfghanistanexpandedinstages,startingwiththehigh-
est-volume MEDEVAC site and gradually extending to serve all
casualties in Afghanistan,13 allowing for the opportunity to ret-
rospectively study concurrent cohorts. The study was deemed
exempt from institutional review board approval by the De-
partment of Defense Joint Trauma System.
Data Sources
Patients were identified from the Department of Defense
traumaregistry,theprehospitaltraumaregistry,andtheArmed
Forces Medical Examiner System Database. Missing or ques-
tionable data values unresolved by electronic resources were
supplemented or verified with data abstracted from original
medical records.
Study Population
Casualties in Afghanistan between April 1, 2012, and August
7, 2015, were included if all of the following criteria were met:
individual was a member of the US military, survived at least
until MEDEVAC rescue from point of injury, and had at least 1
established criterion for prehospital transfusion for severe
trauma (≥1 traumatic limb amputation with at least 1 located
above the knee or elbow, or shock defined as a systolic blood
pressure <90 mm Hg or a heart rate >120 beats per minute)
documented on initial transport from point of injury.
Exposure
The exposures of interest were defined as (1) initiation of pre-
hospital transfusion (red blood cells [RBCs], plasma, or both)
en route from point of injury to a surgical hospital and
(2) minutes from MEDEVAC rescue to first transfusion
(regardless of location; ie, prior to or during hospitalization).
Transfusion recipients were compared with nonrecipients
for whom transfusion was delayed or not given. During the
study period, prehospital transfusion-capable MEDEVAC
teams carried at least 2 U of RBCs or 1 U each of RBCs
and plasma.
Outcomes and Other Variables
Prespecified coprimary outcomes were 24-hour and 30-day
survival after MEDEVAC rescue. Conditional 30-day survival
among patients surviving the first 24 hours14 was a prespeci-
fied secondary analysis. The prevalence of shock (defined as
a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, a heart rate >120 beats
per minute, or a shock index >0.9 [calculated as heart
rate ÷ systolic blood pressure]) measured at hospital admis-
sion was the prespecified secondary end point.
Even though prehospital transfusion was well docu-
mented, the capability to transfuse was not known with cer-
tainty for transport teams serving nonrecipients. To balance
the study groups based on injury severity, nonrecipients of
prehospital transfusion were frequency matched on 5 docu-
mented factors likely to have been visible to the transport
teams: (1) mechanism of injury (gunshot vs explosion),
(2) positive indicator of prehospital shock defined as above,
but measured prior to hospital admission (yes or no),
(3) type and severity of traumatic limb amputation in 4 cat-
egories (none, 1 below knee or elbow, ≥2 below knee or
elbow or 1 above knee or elbow, ≥2 above knee or elbow),
(4) hemorrhagic torso injury assessed by Abbreviated Injury
Scale (AIS) diagnostic code (yes or no),16 and (5) severity of
Key Points
Question Is prehospital blood product transfusion among military
combat casualties associated with improved acute and 30-day
survival?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 502 US military
combat casualties undergoing medical evacuation, prehospital
transfusion was associated with improved survival at 24 hours
(adjusted hazard ratio for mortality, 0.26) and at 30 days (adjusted
hazard ratio for mortality, 0.39).
Meaning Prehospital transfusion of blood products in a military
combat setting was associated with greater likelihood of survival.

 head injury assessed by maximum head AIS score in 3 cat-
egories (0-1, 2, ≥3) (Figure 1). The AIS score designates
severity of injury by body region (head, face, chest, abdo-
men, extremities, and external), ranging from 0 (no injury)
to 6 (not survivable). Prehospital transfusion recipients
were classified into 26 strata, each with a unique matching-
factor profile. Nonrecipients of prehospital transfusion with
a profile matching that of 1 or more recipients were selected
into each stratum, allowing the ratio of nonrecipients to
recipients to vary across strata.
Additional covariates for adjustment were age and
minutes from injury occurrence to MEDEVAC rescue (con-
tinuous), injury year in 4 categories (for each calendar year
during which the study took place), transport team (in 2 cat-
egories), and prehospital tourniquet use (yes or no). The
varying matching ratios and additional covariates necessi-
tated regression modeling to balance the study groups for
potential confounders.17
To examine the balance achieved by the matching and
covariate-adjusted modeling, patient characteristics after
hospital arrival were compared across study groups including
elapsed time from injury occurrence to hospital arrival,
MEDEVAC transport time, receipt of tranexamic acid, level of
care available at the first surgical hospital, initial laboratory
values, total units of RBCs or whole blood received from the
time of MEDEVAC rescue to 24 hours after hospital admis-
sion, total hospital days among 30-day survivors, maximum
AIS score, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). To compute ISS,
the AIS scores for the 3 most severely injured body regions
are each squared and then summed, or if any AIS score
equals 6, the maximum ISS of 75 is assigned.
Statistical Analysis
Unadjusted associations were assessed using the χ2 test,
the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Fisher exact test. One
transfusion recipient and 13 nonrecipients (from various
other strata) had missing data for the time from injury
occurrence to MEDEVAC rescue; however, there were no
missing data for the 4 other covariates included in the mod-
eling, the 5 matching factors, or the prespecified outcomes.
Adjusted analyses were performed only for complete cases
without missing data. Balance across matched study groups
was evaluated with median and multiple logistic regression
adjusted for all 10 covariates simultaneously (including
matching factors).
Initial Cox proportional hazards models were stratified by
the matched groups and adjusted for the 5 other covariates.
To generate survival curves, equivalent Cox models adjusted
for all 10 covariates simultaneously17 and set each covariate
at its median value. The delayed-entry approach18-21 ad-
justed all Cox models for left truncation (a source of potential
immortal time bias22) among transfusion recipients who were
selected for analysis because they survived long enough to re-
ceive prehospital transfusions. Follow-up of matched and co-
variate-balancednonrecipientswasthusalignedtobeginatthe
same minute after the MEDEVAC rescue that the prehospital
transfusion started in the corresponding transfusion recipi-
ent with the shortest delay. Any matched and covariate-
balanced nonrecipient who died on or before the earliest trans-
fusion start time among corresponding transfusion recipients
was not counted.18-21
Time to initiation of transfusion (in minutes after
MEDEVAC rescue), regardless of location (prior to or during
hospitalization), was included in adjusted Cox models as a
categorical variable. The times to the initial transfusion that
overlapped between the prehospital transfusion recipients
and nonrecipients who survived long enough to begin trans-
fusion during hospitalization (≤25 minutes after MEDEVAC
rescue) were examined in quartiles (Figure 2) and compared
with longer delays. For a valid analysis consistent with
Cox modeling for prehospital transfusion, a transfusion initi-
ated during hospitalization (≤25 minutes after MEDEVAC
rescue) among those who did not receive a prehospital trans-
fusion was modeled as a time-dependent covariate, and the
delayed-entry approach accounted for left truncation among
prehospital transfusion recipients.
The sensitivity analysis omitted nonrecipients for whom
prehospital transfusion may have been considered futile (loss
of vital signs without response to cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion en route, vital signs remained undetectable after hospi-
tal arrival, and classified by Armed Forces Medical Examiner
System as prehospital death). The final Cox models met the
proportional hazards assumption based on Schoenfeld resid-
uals and log-log plots.

Results
Characteristics of Entire Study Population
Between April 1, 2012, and August 7, 2015, there were 502
US casualties (median age, 25 years [interquartile range,
22-29 years]; 98% male) that met the selection criteria
(Figure 1) with 55 recipients of prehospital transfusion and
447 nonrecipients. Transfusion recipients had more severe
injuries than nonrecipients (Table 1). Among prehospital
transfusion recipients, 38 received only RBCs (1 patient
received 2 U), 7 received only 1 U of plasma, and 10 received
1 U of RBCs and 1 U of plasma. All 7 prehospital transfusion
recipients who received only 1 U of prehospital plasma went
on to receive 1 U or more of RBCs during hospitalization.
Within 24 hours of MEDEVAC rescue, 3 of 55 prehospital
transfusion recipients (5%) and 85 of 447 nonrecipients
(19%) died (between-group difference, −14% [95% CI, −21%
to −6%]; P = .01). By day 30, 6 prehospital transfusion
recipients (11%) and 102 nonrecipients (23%) died (between-
group difference, −12% [95% CI, −21% to −2%]; P = .04).
Characteristics of Matched Study Cohorts
The 5 matching factors classified the 55 recipients of pre-
hospital transfusion into 26 unique strata, each containing
from 1 to 7 patients (median, 2 patients). There were 345
matching nonrecipients identified, with the number of
matched nonrecipients per stratum ranging from 2 to 62
(median, 6 patients) (Table 1). The ratio of matched nonre-
cipients to recipients per stratum ranged from 0.67 to 62.0
(median, 6 patients). Matching alone did not balance the
study groups17 in aggregate because of the variable numbers
of transfusion recipients and matched nonrecipients within
each stratum.
By hour 24, 3 prehospital transfusion recipients died
(5%) compared with 69 matched nonrecipients (20%)
(between-group difference, −15% [95% CI, −22% to −7%];
P = .007). By day 30, 6 prehospital transfusion recipients
died (11%) compared with 78 matched nonrecipients (23%)
(between-group difference, −12% [95% CI, −21% to −2%];
P = .05). Regression modeling adjusted for frequency
matching and additional covariates balanced the study
groups with respect to evacuation and transport times, ini-
tial laboratory pH values, total hospital days among 30-day
survivors, maximum AIS score, and ISS (Table 2). More pre-
hospital transfusion recipients than nonrecipients received
tranexamic acid (48/55 [87%] vs an estimated 45% of nonre-
cipients; P < .001). Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic
medication and potential confounder of the prehospital
transfusion effects on survival.8,25 However, this medica-
tion was initiated during hospitalization for 150 (88%) of the
170 actual patients who received it; only 4 prehospital trans-
fusion recipients (7%) received the initial dose before or
concurrently with their initial transfusion.
A greater percentage of prehospital transfusion
recipients arrived alive at a role 3 vs a role 2 hospital (48/55
[87%] vs an adjusted 63% of surviving nonrecipients;
P = .004). A role 3 hospital provides definitive theater
support and advanced capabilities compared with a role 2
hospital, which provides forward resuscitative care with
limited resources. Prehospital transfusion recipients also
had higher international normalized ratios (1.40 vs 1.26 for
matched nonrecipients; P = .008), suggesting a higher
prevalence of coagulopathy, and more RBC or whole blood
transfusions by hour 24 after hospital admission (15 U
vs 11 U, respectively; P = .002).

 Primary Survival Analysis
Exposure Defined as Prehospital Transfusion
In adjusted survival analyses among the 386 matched study
patients with complete covariate data (97%), the association
of survival with prehospital transfusion remained signifi-
cant at both 24 hours and 30 days (Figure 3A, B). The
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.26 (95% CI,
0.08-0.84; P = .02) over 24 hours (3 deaths among 54 pre-
hospital transfusion recipients vs 67 deaths among 332

bNonrecipients were matched to transfusion recipients by 5 matching
factors that when taken together defined 26 unique strata for the 55
prehospital transfusion recipients and identified 345 matching nonrecipients.
Each stratum contained 1 to 7 prehospital transfusion recipients (median,

of nonrecipients to recipients varied from 0.67 to 62.0 (median, 6 patients)
per stratum. Matching did not balance the study groups in aggregate due to
variation in the ratio of nonrecipients to recipients across strata, so the

 P = .03) over 30 days (6 deaths among 54 prehospital
transfusion recipients vs 76 deaths among 332 matched
nonrecipients). In adjusted Cox models that also included
interaction terms to assess whether selected covariates
modified the association of prehospital transfusion with
survival, there were no significant variations across 24
hours (P = .14) or 30 days (P = .44) of follow-up, calendar
year of injury occurrence (P = .93 at 24 hours and P = .77 at
30 days), or type of transport team (P = .53 at 24 hours and
P = .76 at 30 days).
Among all patients in the matched groups who died
within 30 days, 59 of the 84 deaths (70%) occurred within
the first hour after MEDEVAC rescue or prior to hospital
arrival, including 58 of 78 deaths (74%) among nonrecipi-
ents and 1 of 6 deaths (17%) among prehospital trans-
fusion recipients. Deaths among nonrecipients early after
MEDEVAC rescue contributed the most to the between-
group difference in survival (Figure 3A, B). In adjusted Cox
analyses focused on survival to 30 days conditional on
24-hour survival, the association with prehospital transfu-
sion was not statistically significant (adjusted HR, 0.84
[95% CI, 0.18-4.00], P = .83; there were 3 deaths among 51
transfusion recipients vs 9 deaths among 265 nonrecipients;

recipients of transfusion within 15 minutes of MEDEVAC res-
cue vs 68 deaths among 324 matched patients with delayed

tion with survival at 24 hours (adjusted HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.41-

hospital deaths occurred only among nonrecipients, and af-
ter removing 21 of the total 41 in the sensitivity analysis to al-
low for possible transfusion futility, a reduced 24-hour
mortality rate persisted for transfusions started within 15 min-
utes of MEDEVAC rescue (adjusted HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.06-
0.96],P = .04;therewere2deathsamong62recipientsoftrans-

Secondary End Point Analysis
Of the 55 prehospital transfusion recipients, 42 (76%) had
documented shock measured at arrival to the first surgical
hospital compared with an estimated 206 of the 299 surviv-
ing matched nonrecipients (69%) (adjusted for all 10 co-
variates including documented prehospital shock measured
during transport). Adjusting also for competing risk of pre-
hospital death,23,24 prehospital transfusion had no statisti-
cally significant association with shock at hospital admission
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.86-1.18]; P = .94).
Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study of US military casualties
transported on MEDEVAC helicopters in Afghanistan, prehos-
pital transfusion within minutes of injury was associated
with significantly reduced 24-hour and 30-day mortality.
Concurrent cohorts in this retrospective study minimized the

 potential confounding inherent to historical comparisons
of preintervention vs postintervention outcomes.26,27 Find-
ings were consistent regardless of whether they were de-
rived from (1) the unadjusted analyses of all 502 casualties;
(2) the survival analysis adjusted for matching, other covari-
ates, and immortal time bias; or (3) the sensitivity analysis for
possible transfusion futility, which removed more than half
(21) of the 41 prehospital deaths among nonrecipients of pre-
hospital transfusion.
The results of this study must be interpreted within
the context of the military trauma system in which the
transfusions were given. First, during the time frame of this
study, the “golden hour rule” was in effect, which had been
mandated by the US Secretary of Defense.5 This policy pre-
scribed that injured service members designated as urgent
evacuation casualties arrive at a location equipped with
surgical capability within 1 hour from the time of initial
MEDEVAC request. The golden hour rule fueled expansion
of the MEDEVAC service and forward-deployed surgical re-
sources, resulting in the median total evacuation time of 47
minutes for patients in this study population.
Second,militarycasualtiesreceivepromptlife-savingtreat-
ment at the point of injury from trained medical and nonmedi-
cal first responders with an initial emphasis on control of mas-
sive external hemorrhage. This is an advantage not currently
available to most civilian trauma patients.
Third, all deaths in this military population were cap-
tured with complete autopsy examinations, including pre-
hospital deaths. Early hemorrhagic deaths constitute a large
proportion of patients predicted to benefit from prehospital
transfusion.28 Thus, to fully understand the effect of prehos-
pital transfusion, inclusion of prehospital deaths is critical.
Civilian trauma centers have been reported to vary signifi-
cantly in their detection of early deaths, especially prehos-
pital deaths.29 In addition, unlike previous studies,14 the US
military study population allowed capture of complete
30-day follow-up.
The increase in survival observed in this study is signifi-
cant, consistent with a UK study of military casualties,27 but
distinct from civilian studies.14,15 The conditional 30-day sur-
vival analysis among 24-hour survivors revealed how an ap-
proach used in some previous studies14 may be flawed. Ex-
cludingprehospitalandearlydeathswithin24hoursofhospital
admission, which are primarily due to hemorrhage,28,30 may
introduce survival bias, rendering the true association be-
tween injury mortality and early transfusion undetectable.31
Because the time to initiate transfusion during hospital-
ization may in some cases be shorter than the time to prehos-
pital transfusion, it is important to evaluate time to first trans-
fusion without regard to location.32 Transfusion is a critical
intervention in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, how-
ever, the exact length of time to hemorrhagic death will vary
for each individual patient depending on injury pattern and
available hemorrhage-control capabilities. It may be challeng-
ing for civilian and immature military trauma systems to de-
liver transfusion resources in time to prevent exsanguina-
tion, especially with a tolerance margin as narrow as these
results suggest.
Four recent prospective studies of prehospital transfu-
sion in civilian trauma settings15,33-35 may be able to further
address the issues of transfusion timing, inclusion of early
deaths,andotherlimitationsofpreviousstudies.14Twoofthese
4 studies were designed to evaluate prehospital RBC and
plasma transfusion, including the first randomized trial un-
der way33 and another that reported inconclusive findings.15
The remaining 2 studies were designed to examine prehos-
pital transfusion of plasma only; one is under way,34 and the
other was terminated for futility.35
Limitations
This study has several limitations. Retrospective studies can-
not overcome unmeasured confounding. Although receipt of
prehospital transfusion was well documented in medical rec-
ords,theprehospitaltransfusioncapabilityofMEDEVACteams
transporting nonrecipients was not. To enhance between-
group comparability, nonrecipients were matched to prehos-
pital transfusion recipients. Because stratification on post-
treatment surrogates for severity (eg, massive transfusion, ISS)
has introduced bias into both randomized and observational
studies of prehospital trauma care,36 the current study used
only matching and additional covariate adjustment based on
documented injury characteristics that prehospital transport
teams would likely observe.
Compared with nonrecipients, prehospital transfusion re-
cipients had more casualties transported by the US Air Force
Pararescue (call sign Pedro) and the UK Medical Emergency
Response Teams, which are aircraft platforms equipped with
higher levels of care that could confer survival advantages
vs the more common US Army MEDEVAC (call sign DUSTOFF)
aircraft platforms.37,38 However, the potential for varying
MEDEVAC capabilities to modify or confound results was sys-
tematically evaluated. Regardless of different patient selec-
tion, matching, or statistical adjustment strategies, the asso-
ciation of prehospital transfusion with reduced mortality
was consistent without significant variation for follow-up
time, injury year, or transport team capabilities. Moreover, in-
hospital care (regardless of complexity or intensity) had little
opportunity to influence the observed associations because
transfusioninitiatedwithin15minutesanddeathspriortohos-
pital arrival or within 1 hour of MEDEVAC rescue contributed
most to the observed between-group differences in mortality.
A sensitivity analysis was applied as a mitigation strategy
for potential transfusion futility among nonrecipients
reported as unresponsive to resuscitation efforts after the
loss of vital signs en route. Because prehospital transfusion
may have been considered futile for at least some moribund
casualties, the sensitivity analysis omitted all of them to re-
duce mortality to the lowest extreme among nonrecipients.
Despite removing more than 50% of prehospital deaths,
24-hour mortality was still significantly decreased for re-
cipients of transfusions started within about 36 minutes after
injury. In addition, although all of the 55 prehospital transfu-
sion recipients received at least 1 U of additional blood prod-
uct after hospital arrival, 112 matched nonrecipients (32%) sur-
vived longer than 24 hours without receiving any transfusion,
which could cast doubt on their eligibility for prehospital

 transfusion. If these casualties were excluded, a higher mor-
tality rate among the nonrecipients would further strengthen
the association of prehospital transfusion with survival, but
would also further reduce statistical power and precision.
Alongside consistently favorable and statistically significant
associations of prehospital and early transfusion with sur-
vival, the study’
s modest sample size of only 55 prehospital
transfusion recipients generated broad 95% CIs with upper
bounds close to null, especially for 30-day survival.
Early deaths prior to MEDEVAC arrival were excluded from
the study to focus on casualties who could possibly have re-
ceived transfusions. During this study, capability for transfu-
sion prior to MEDEVAC arrival was nominal and no recipients
were identified. It is possible that even earlier transfusion
(ie, prior to the estimated 36 minutes shown in this study) may
be associated with a greater likelihood of survival. More re-
search in this area is needed.
Conclusions
Among medically evacuated US military combat causalities in
Afghanistan, blood product transfusion prehospital or within
minutes of injury was associated with greater 24-hour and
30-day survival than delayed transfusion or no transfusion.
The findings support prehospital transfusion in this setting.
