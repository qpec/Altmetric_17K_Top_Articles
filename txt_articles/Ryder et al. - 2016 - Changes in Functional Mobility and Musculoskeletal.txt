IMPORTANCE Severe obesity is associated with mobility limitations and higher incidence of
multijoint musculoskeletal pain. It is unknown whether substantial weight loss improves
these important outcomes in adolescents with severe obesity.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of bariatric surgery with functional mobility and
musculoskeletal pain in adolescents with severe obesity up to 2 years after surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Teen–Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery
Study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study, which enrolled 242 adolescents
(�19 years of age) who were undergoing bariatric surgery from March 2007 through
February 2012 at 5 US adolescent bariatric surgery centers. This analysis was conducted in
November 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 161), sleeve gastrectomy (n = 67), or
laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (n = 14).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants completed a 400-m walk test prior to bariatric
surgery (n = 206) and at 6 months (n = 195), 12 months (n = 176), and 24 months (n = 149)
after surgery. Time to completion, resting heart rate (HR), immediate posttest HR, and HR
difference (resting HR minus posttest HR) were measured and musculoskeletal pain
concerns, during and after the test, were documented. Data were adjusted for age, sex,
race/ethnicity, baseline body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared), and surgical center (posttest HR and HR difference were further adjusted
for changes in time to completion).
RESULTS Of the 206 adolescents with severe obesity included in the study, 156 were female
(75.7%), the mean (SD) age was 17.1 (1.6) years, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 51.7
(8.5). Compared with baseline, significant improvements were observed at 6 months for the
walk test time to completion (mean, 376 seconds; 95% CI, 365-388 to 347 seconds; 95% CI,
340-358; P < .01), resting HR (mean, 84 beats per minute [bpm]; 95% CI, 82-86 to 74 bpm;
95% CI, 72-76), posttest HR (mean, 128 bpm; 95% CI, 125-131 to 113 bpm; 95% CI, 110-116),
and HR difference (mean, 40 bpm; 95% CI, 36-42 to 34 bpm; 95% CI, 31-37). These changes
in time to completion, resting HR, and HR difference persisted at 12 months and 24 months.
Posttest HR further improved from 6 months to 12 months (mean, 113 bpm; 95% CI, 110-116
to 108 bpm; 95% CI, 105-111). There were statistically significant reductions in
musculoskeletal pain concerns at all points.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data provide evidence that bariatric surgery in
adolescents with severe obesity is associated with significant improvement in functional
mobility and in the reduction of walking-related musculoskeletal pain up to 2 years after
surgery.

A
dolescent severe obesity (body mass index [BMI, cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared] ≥1.2 times the 95th BMI percentile) is
characterized by a number of chronic comorbid conditions in-
cluding functional mobility limitations and musculoskeletal
pain.1-7 In adults, limitations in functional mobility, assessed
using walking tests, are associated with lower quality of life,8
chronic pain,9 and early mortality.10,11 Importantly, the de-
gree of adiposity appears to play a pivotal role in exacerbat-
ing functional mobility limitations.12-14 Youth with obesity are
not immune to these consequences, often experiencing mus-
culoskeletal pain,15 which can lead to declines in physical ac-
tivity patterns and impaired functional mobility.16,17 Improv-
ing and preserving functional mobility while subsequently
reducing musculoskeletal pain in adolescents with severe obe-
sity might encourage more physical activity, thereby improv-
ing many important long-term health outcomes.
Lifestyle modification interventions in youth with severe
obesity who have incorporated physical activity have shown
significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness18 and walk-
ing distance.19 However, these structured programs are usu-
ally offered for a relatively short period and the long-term chal-
lenges of adherence to lifestyle changes for youth with severe
obesity are well documented.20,21 Thus, there is a need to in-
vestigate whether alternative treatments offer sustained im-
provements in functional mobility and musculoskeletal pain
outcomes in youth with severe obesity. For adults who have
undergone bariatric surgery, significant improvements in stan-
dardized walk test time, mobility tasks, and cardiovascular fit-
ness along with reductions in musculoskeletal pain have been
documented.22-26 However, to our knowledge, the extent to
which similar benefits accrue after bariatric surgery in ado-
lescents is unknown.
The overall goal of this study was to examine the effect of
bariatric surgery on functional mobility and musculoskeletal
pain in adolescents enrolled in the Teen–Longitudinal Assess-
ment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) Study up to 2 years
after surgery. We used a standardized 400-m walk test with
assessments of time to test completion, resting heart rate (HR),
immediateposttestHR,HRrecovery,andwalking-relatedmus-
culoskeletal pain to examine changes over time.
Methods
Study Cohort and Measurement Points
Participants from the Teen-LABS Study were included in this
analysisconductedinNovember2015.27TheTeen-LABSStudy
is an ongoing National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases–funded, prospective, longitudinal, multi-
center observational study that enrolled consecutive adoles-
cents (≤19 years of age) undergoing bariatric surgery at 5 clini-
calcenters.Writtenparentalpermission,participantassent(<18
years old), and consent from older adolescents (≥18 years old)
wereobtained.Datacollectionpointsusedforthisanalysiswere
baseline (preoperative) and 6-month, 12-month, and 24-
month postoperative assessments. At each assessment, height
was measured on a wall-mounted stadiometer and weight on
an electronic scale (Scale-Tronix 5200, Scale Tronix, or Tanita
TBF310) and BMI was calculated.
The protocol and data and safety monitoring plans were
approved by the institutional review board at each institu-
tion and by a data and safety monitoring board for the study
as a whole.
Assessment of Functional Mobility
Participantscompleteda400-mwalktestpriortoplannedbar-
iatricsurgeryandagainat6months,12months,and24months
after surgery. Time to completion, resting HR, immediate post-
test HR, 2-minute HR recovery (posttest HR minus 2-minute
postcompletion HR), and HR difference (resting HR minus im-
mediate posttest HR) were measured. Heart rate was mea-
sured by a Polar HR monitor (Polar Electro Inc), while comple-
tion time was measured by stopwatch. We have previously
reported the accuracy and validity of physical activity mea-
surement during a 400-m walk test in youth with severe
obesity.28 Musculoskeletal pain concerns were documented
during and after the completion of the 400-m walk tests and
consisted of knee, hip, calf, foot, and back pain, along with
numbness or tingling and leg cramps. Any of these indica-

Statistical Analysis
Standard descriptive statistics summarized participant char-
acteristics at baseline. Categorical variables were calculated as
frequenciesandpercentages.Aquantile-quantileplotwasused
to determine whether response variables (time to comple-
tion, resting HR, posttest HR, 2-minute HR recovery, and HR
difference) were normally distributed. On the basis of the ob-
served plot, log transformations were used to normalize the
time-to-completiondistributionforsubsequentmodeling.Lin-
ear mixed-effects models were used to determine the changes
over time in functional mobility parameters from baseline. Ini-
tially,bothrandominterceptandslopewereusedtofitthedata,
but random slope was dropped from the final model because
it was not statistically significant. The unstructured covari-
ance was used in order for each variance and covariance to be
freely estimated. Generalized estimating equations were used
to estimate the relative risk associated with musculoskeletal
Key Points
Question Does bariatric surgery improve functional mobility and
reduce musculoskeletal pain in adolescents with severe obesity?
Findings Within the context of a longitudinal multicenter study of
adolescent bariatric surgery, time to completion of a 400-m walk
test, resting heart rate, and heart rate difference were improved
compared with baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.
There were statistically significant reductions in musculoskeletal
pain concerns at all times.
Meaning Bariatric surgery is associated with improved functional
mobility and reduction in musculoskeletal pain in adolescents with
severe obesity up to 2 years after surgery.

pain concerns (with vs without pain) following surgery. An un-
structuredcorrelationwithrobustvarianceestimatorswasused
for model estimates. All models were adjusted for age, race/
ethnicity, sex, baseline BMI, and surgical center. Surgery type
was also entered in the initial models but was not statistically
significant in any models, and so it was removed from the fi-
nal models. Data using postsurgery (6-month, 12-month, and
24-month) follow-up visits for immediate posttest HR, 2-min-
ute HR recovery, and HR difference were further adjusted for
changes in time to completion. Multiple imputation was used
for missing covariates for all models. Data are presented as
means with 95% CIs. The estimates presented in the figures
represent marginally adjusted means and associated 95% CIs
from the models. The statistical significance level was set at
α = .05. Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing was used
for all post hoc comparisons between time points within
each hypothesis considered in this study. All analyses were
conducted with SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Preoperative demographic, anthropometric, and clinical
characteristics of the sample are displayed in the Table.
Most patients were female (n = 156, 75.7%) and white
(n = 149, 72.3%). Of the 3 surgical procedures performed,
most were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 139, 67.5%) fol-
lowed by vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 56, 27.2%) and
laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 11, 5.3%).
Owing to the relatively small number of patients who
received laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and the
well-described differences in BMI outcome compared with
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy,
this group was excluded from the analysis. The BMI per-
centage change from baseline to 6 months was a decrease of
32.5%; from 6 months to 12 months, an additional decrease
of 7.8% (40.3% cumulative BMI percentage reduction); and
from 12 months to 24 months, an additional decrease of
0.2% (40.4% cumulative BMI percentage reduction). A total
of 109 patients (53%) had measurements for all 4 visits, and
67 (33%) had 3 measurements of 4 visits. A total of 22 (11%)
and 8 (4%) completed 2 measurements and 1 measurement,
respectively, of all 4 visits.
At baseline, BMI was significantly positively associated
(P < .05) with posttest HR (r = 0.33; P < .01), time to comple-
tion (r = 0.16; P = .02), and 2-minute HR recovery (r = 0.18;
P = .01) and was significantly inversely associated with HR
difference (r = 0.17; P = .01) after adjusting for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity (eTable in the Supplement). Changes in time
to completion and resting HR, adjusted for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, baseline BMI, and surgical center at baseline, 6
months, 12 months, and 24 months are displayed in
Figure 1. At 6 months after surgery, significant improve-
ments were observed in time to completion (mean [SD], 376
[1] seconds; 95% CI, 365-388 to 347 [1] seconds; 95% CI,
340-358; P < .01) and resting HR (mean [SD], 84 [1] beats per
minute [bpm]; 95% CI, 82-86 to 74 [1] bpm; 95% CI, 72-76;
P < .01). The changes in time to completion and resting HR
persisted at 12 months and 24 months, with no additional
statistically significant improvements observed.
Changes in posttest HR, HR difference, and 2-minute
HR recovery, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline
BMI, surgical center, and change in time to completion at
baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months are dis-
played in Figure 2. At 6 months after surgery, significant
improvements were observed in posttest HR (mean [SD],
128 [2] bpm; 95% CI, 125-131 to 113 [2] bpm; 95% CI, 110-116;
P < .01), and HR difference (mean [SD], 40 [2] bpm; 95% CI,
36-42 to 34 [2] bpm; 95% CI, 31-37; P < .01). There was a sig-
nificant improvement in 2-minute HR recovery from base-
line to 12 months (mean [SD], −31 [1] bpm; 95% CI −33 to −28
to −25 [1] bpm; 95% CI, −28 to −23; P < .01) but no other sta-
tistically significant differences were observed between
time points. There was no additional statistically significant
improvement in HR difference at 12 months and 24 months.
Posttest HR further improved from 6 months to 12 months
(mean [SD], 113 [2] bpm; 95% CI, 110-116 to 108 [2] bpm;
95% CI, 105-111; P = .01) with no additional improvements
observed at 24 months.
At 6 months, no association between percentage change
in BMI and any measure of functional mobility or musculo-
skeletal pain was observed. At 12 months (β = 1.08) and
24 months (β = 1.01) only, change in time to completion
was associated with percentage change in BMI (P < .01).
Additionally, no consistent associations between changes in
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or mean
arterial pressure with changes in HR responses were
observed.
The cumulative number of participants reporting walking-
related musculoskeletal pain concerns is displayed in Figure 3.

Discussion
The findings from this prospective observational study of bar-
iatric surgery in adolescents with severe obesity suggest that
meaningful and durable improvements in functional mobil-
ity and reductions in musculoskeletal pain occur in the post-
surgical setting. Most improvements were observed at 6
months after surgery, which is concurrent with the greatest
weight loss achieved. However, the changes at 6 months were
not associated with the magnitude of reduction in BMI. Im-
portantly, all measures of functional mobility and musculo-
skeletal pain, which improved at 6 months, were maintained
up to the 2-year follow-up point.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct
standardized 400-m walk tests in adolescents with severe
obesity prior to and following bariatric surgical intervention
(ie, up to 2 years). Our findings are in line with several adult
studies, which observed significant improvements in rest-
ing HR, posttest HR, exercise capacity, and reductions in
musculoskeletal pain after bariatric surgery.22-26 Direct com-
parison between adult studies and the present study are
challenging because most adult studies used a time-based
assessment (6-minute walk test) rather than a distance-
based assessment (400-m walk test) as was measured in our
study. However, the mean completion time for the walk test
among participants in our study was only slightly longer
than 6 minutes (6 minutes and 17 seconds) and the distance
covered in most adult studies was around 400 m (381-
489 m), suggesting that it might be reasonable to make
comparisons.24,26,29 De Souza et al26 observed improve-
ments in resting HR and immediate posttest HR in adults 7
to 12 months following bariatric surgery along with greater
distance achieved. Similarly, Maniscalco and colleagues29
reported improvements in resting HR, immediate posttest
HR, and changes in respiratory function 1 year after bariatric
surgery. The magnitude of change in HR response prior to
and after testing was comparable between the present study
and those reported in adults. Taken together, the body of lit-
erature suggests that functional mobility in both adults and
adolescents with severe obesity can be improved in a rela-
tively short period following bariatric surgery.
The mechanism(s) responsible for reductions in HR
response at rest and after testing are unknown and may not
be entirely weight loss dependent. Others have shown that
adults 3 months following bariatric surgery exhibited
significantly reduced resting HR and, during a 6-minute
walk test, had significantly improved HR responses
during and immediately following the test as well as
demonstrated improved HR recovery.24 Interestingly, these
changes in HR were accompanied by peripheral muscular
metaboreflex responses, which are indicative of enhanced
muscle profusion. Studies in adults30,31 and adolescents32,33
have shown beneficial adaptations in cardiac structure and
function following bariatric surgery, which when coupled
with improvements in systemic vascular function,34,35 may
play an important role in regulating HR responses during
rest and after exercise. Although physiologically plausible,
this theory is somewhat speculative, and we observed no
association between changes in HR response and changes in
blood pressure at any point. However, the mechanism(s) of
beneficial adaptation in resting and exercise HR response
following bariatric surgery warrants further evaluation.
We also observed meaningful reductions in musculo-
skeletal pain concerns both during and after the 400-m
walk test. The reduction in pain following bariatric surgery

could translate to increased physical activity patterns in
adolescents with severe obesity because joint pain can
influence willingness to engage in activity.36 Correspond-
ingly, increasing physical activity could yield many impor-
tant improvements in cardiometabolic health without the
necessity for further weight loss.37 Therefore, by reducing
musculoskeletal pain, bariatric surgery may make many
activities of daily life less burdensome for youth with severe
obesity and could contribute to reducing factors that affect
long-term health risks.
This study had several strengths including a large sample
size, strong longitudinal follow-up, and use of a clinically rel-
evant measure of functional mobility, which was consis-
tently delivered across enrollment sites. Moreover, our adjust-
ments for specific confounding variables (eg, baseline BMI and
changes in time to completion), which might influence HR re-
sponse, aid in the interpretation of the results as differing lev-
els of adiposity and completion time may influence energy de-
mands during movement.38 Our study was limited by the lack
of a nonsurgical control group with which to compare out-
comes over time. We were underpowered to determine
whether any differences were present in changes in func-
tional mobility or musculoskeletal pain between surgery types
(Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs vertical sleeve gastrectomy), but
this comparison is scientifically relevant given the likely dif-
ferences in mechanisms of metabolic change with these op-
erations. Despite measuring musculoskeletal pain concerns
during and after testing, the limited number of concerns, spe-
cifically after surgery, limited our ability to determine joint-
specific changes. We do not present data on day-to-day varia-
tion in musculoskeletal pain,39 which could have aided in the
interpretation of our research findings. Finally, despite being
a clinically translatable measure of functional mobility, the
400-m walk test is not a gold-standard measure of physical fit-
ness as compared with a graded exercise test; therefore, these
results may or may not be indicative of true changes in car-
diorespiratory fitness.

Conclusions
Bariatric surgery in adolescents with severe obesity is asso-
ciated with significant improvement in resting HR, com-
pletion time of a standardized 400-m walk test, and imme-
diate posttest HR response; it is also associated with a re-
duction in walking-related musculoskeletal pain concerns
at 6 months after surgery. These meaningful improve-
ments were maintained up to 2 years after surgery. Whether
these positive changes in functional mobility and mus-
culoskeletal pain persist over the long-term and lead to
further improvements in cardiometabolic risk requires
evaluation.
