 Believing in Food Addiction: Helpful or
Counterproductive for Eating Behavior?

Objective: Obesity is often attributed to an addiction to food, and many people believe themselves to be
“food addicts.” However, little is known about how such beliefs may affect dietary control and weight
management. The current research examined the impact of experimentally manipulating participants’ per-
sonal food addiction beliefs on eating behavior.
Methods: In two studies, female participants (study 1: N 5 64; study 2: N 5 90) completed food-related
computerized tasks and were given bogus feedback on their performance which indicated that they had
high, low, or average food addiction tendencies. Food intake was then assessed in an ad libitum taste
test. Dietary concern and time taken to complete the taste test were recorded in study 2.
Results: In study 1, participants in the high-addiction condition consumed fewer calories than those in
the low-addiction condition, F(1,60) 5 7.61, P 5 0.008, gp
2 5 0.11. Study 2 replicated and extended this
finding, showing that the effect of the high-addiction condition on food intake was mediated by increased
dietary concern, which reduced the amount of time participants willingly spent exposed to the foods dur-
ing the taste test, b 5 20.06 (0.03), 95% confidence interval 5 20.13 to 20.01.
Conclusions: Believing oneself to be a food addict is associated with short-term dietary restriction. The
longer-term effects on weight management now warrant attention.

Introduction
Obesity continues to increase, with more than half of adults world-
wide now having overweight or obesity (1). Overeating and obesity
are frequently attributed to a food-based addiction though this notion
has been the source of considerable controversy within the scientific
community (2-4). However, scientific understanding has not kept pace
with the lay public’s enthusiasm for the concept of “food addiction”
(5-8). Indeed, in a recent study, almost three quarters of participants
believed that obesity is caused by an addiction to certain foods (7).
Furthermore, as many as 50% of people believe themselves to be
food addicts (9,10). To date, little is known about the potential impact
of believing oneself to be a food addict on eating behavior.
An addiction-based explanation implies that excessive eating is out-
side of personal control and, in this way, may help to remove indi-
vidual responsibility for overconsumption (11). However, there may
be
counterproductive
effects
on
eating
behavior.
It
is
well-
established that feeling in control of one’s behavior is important for
health and predicts engagement in a variety of health-promoting die-
tary behaviors (12-14). Conversely, public health messages which
imply a lack of personal control over behavior (e.g., “obesity is a
disease”) have been associated with unhealthy food choices and
greater food intake (15,16).
An opposing idea is that food addiction may be helpful for the initiation
of healthy dietary behaviors. Notably, members of Overeaters Anony-
mous reported an increased sense of responsibility after acknowledging
their “addiction” to food (17,18). Furthermore, diminished self-control
beliefs may lead people to avoid putting themselves in tempting situa-
tions in the first place. In one study, smokers who were told that they
had a low capacity for self-control subsequently exposed themselves to
fewer tempting smoking scenarios, and were thus less likely to smoke,
than participants who were told they had a high capacity for self-control
(19). Consistently, participants who were told that they had low self-
control consumed less alcohol in a subsequent “taste test” than those
who believed that they had high self-control (20).
To test these possibilities, the current research aimed to experimentally
manipulate participants’ personal beliefs about food addiction—that is,

 the extent to which they believed themselves to be food addicts. In a pre-
vious study, beliefs about the existence of food addiction (e.g., “food
addiction is real”) were found to be malleable though there was no clear
effect of this belief manipulation on food consumption (9). However, in
this study, we reasoned that leading people to believe that they are per-
sonally affected by food addiction would be more likely to influence
subsequent eating behavior. This is supported by evidence that personal-
ized feedback is highly effective at invoking dietary behavior change
(21). In a two-tailed hypothesis, we predicted that believing oneself to
be a food addict would either promote overconsumption due to reduced
personal responsibility for eating or cause a person to be concerned
about their eating behavior and consume less snack food.
Study 1 Methods
Participants and design
Female university staff and students (N 5 64) were recruited to take
part in a study into the effect of mood on taste preferences. As this
study was the first to examine the effect of personal food addiction
beliefs on food intake, we restricted the sample to female partici-
pants in order to minimize differences between-subjects. Indeed,
gender differences in dietary beliefs and the prioritization of healthy
eating behaviors have previously been demonstrated (22). In a
between-subjects design, participants were randomly allocated to
either high-addiction or low-addiction conditions. As there were no
previous studies upon which to base an a priori power analysis, we
selected a target sample size of 60, with 30 participants per cell,
which would give 86% power to detect a large effect (f 5 0.4) at an
a level of P 5 0.05 (GPOWER 3.1 (23)). We slightly over-recruited
to account for any participants guessing the aims of the study. Par-
ticipants were asked not to eat or consume any calorie-containing
drinks for 3 h before the study and all indicated compliance with
this instruction. Ethical approval was granted by the University
Research
Ethics
Committee
and
all
participants
gave
written
informed consent before participation.
Measures and procedure
We adapted the methodology used by Jones et al. (20) in order to
manipulate personal food addiction beliefs. Participants first com-
pleted modified, food-related versions of the valence implicit associ-
ation task (IAT) (24,25) and a standard stop-signal task (SST) (26),
which they were told would assess their addictive tendencies
towards food. Following each task, a bogus score was displayed on
the computer screen. The experimenter explained that the score
reflected either a high (in the high-addiction condition) or low (in
the low-addiction condition) tendency towards food addiction. To
further enforce believability, participants were shown a bogus histo-
gram which ostensibly illustrated the distribution of food addiction
scores within the general population. Those in the low-addiction
condition were informed that they had scored within the bottom-
quartile of the distribution, while those in the high-addiction condi-
tion were told that they scored within the top-quartile. Participants
then completed one of two versions of a leading questionnaire to
reinforce beliefs about their own level of food addiction. In the
high-addiction condition, the questionnaire consisted of five items
that were congruent with addictive-like eating behavior which par-
ticipants would be likely to agree with (e.g., “I sometimes crave
sweet, salty, or fatty foods”). In the low-addiction condition, the
questionnaire consisted of five items that were congruent with non-
addictive-like eating (e.g., “I usually feel in control of what and
how much I eat”). In response to each question, participants could
tick either “yes” or “no.”
Participants were then asked “Do you believe that some people are
addicted to food?”, to which they could tick either “yes” or “no.”
This question was included to ensure that all participants believed in
the concept of food addiction and thus were potentially susceptible to
the manipulation. Next, to ensure that the manipulation had been suc-
cessful, participants completed a measure of self-perceived food
addiction (i.e., “I believe myself to be a food addict”). Responses
were provided on a 5-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly
agree. They then rated their levels of hunger and fullness, and com-
pleted a set of 21 mood ratings (e.g., nervous, miserable; these were
included to provide consistency with the cover story that the study
was exploring the effects of mood on taste). A complete list of mood
ratings is provided in the Supporting Information. All ratings used
100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS) that were anchored by “not at
all” on the left and “extremely” on the right. Next, participants com-
pleted the taste task in which they were provided with a 50 g bowl of
crisps (Tesco Ready salted crisps: 454 kcal/100 g, 33.2 g fat/100 g)
and a 100 g bowl of chocolate (Cadbury Dairy Milk Giant Buttons:
530 kcal/100 g, 30 g fat/100 g). Before tasting each food, participants
completed 100 mm VAS ratings of “expected liking,” “desire to eat,”
“craving,” and “difficulty to resist.” Participants were then instructed
to consume as much of the food as they wished, and to rate each
food on seven taste scales (e.g., salty, sweet). A complete list of taste
ratings is provided in the Supporting Information. Participants ended
the taste task whenever they wished. Following the taste task, partici-
pants rated their hunger and fullness again, as well as how much they
enjoyed eating each food, using 100 mm VAS.
To monitor demand characteristics, participants were asked to write
down what they believed to be the aims of the study. They then
completed the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) (27), and the
restraint and disinhibition subscales of the Three-Factor Eating
Questionnaire (TFEQ-R and TFEQ-D, respectively) (28). The YFAS
uses the diagnostic statistical manual (DSM-IV) criteria for sub-
stance dependence to measure and diagnose dependence on high-fat
and high-sugar foods. The TFEQ-R and TFEQ-D assess individual
tendencies to restrict food intake, and to overeat, respectively.
Finally, measures of height (in m) and weight (in kg) were taken
and used to calculate body mass index (BMI). At the end of the
study, participants were fully debriefed and informed that the food
addiction feedback was bogus.
Study 1 Results
Two participants did not believe in the concept of food addiction,
one of whom also guessed the aims of the study. These two partici-
pants were removed from subsequent analysesa. The remaining sam-
ple consisted of n 5 30 in the low-addiction condition, and n 5 32 in
the high-addiction condition. Independent samples t-tests conducted
on the remaining sample did not uncover any between-condition dif-
ferences with regard to BMI, age, or performance on the computer-
ized tasks (Ps > 0.262).
aThe analyses were rerun to include the two participants who did not believe in food
addiction and guessed the aims of the study, and the results did not change.

 Participants in the high-addiction condition believed more strongly
that they were food addicts (M 5 3.84 6 0.69)b than those in the
low-addiction condition (M 5 2.77 6 0.88), t(60) 5 5.29, P < 0.001,
d 5 1.35, thus indicating that the manipulation was successful.
A 2 3 2 mixed design ANOVA was conducted with food (choco-
late, crisps) as the within-subjects factor, and condition (high addic-
tion and low addiction) as the between-subjects factor. There was a
main effect of condition on calorie intake, F(1,60) 5 7.61, P 5 0.008,
gp(2) 5 0.11,
such
that
those
in
the
high-addiction
condition
(M 5 163.20 6 129.47) consumed significantly fewer calories than
those in the low-addiction condition (M 5 260.50 6 147.62). There
was also a significant condition by food interaction, F(1,60) 5 4.52,
P 5 0.038, gp(2) 5 0.07, see Figure 1. Subsequent independent t-tests
revealed that those in the high-addiction condition consumed fewer
calories from chocolate than those in the low-addiction condition,
t(54) 5 22.88, P 5 0.006, d 5 0.73. Participants also tended to eat
fewer calories from crisps in the high-addiction condition relative to
the low-addiction condition though this difference was not statisti-
cally significant, t(60) 5 21.61, P 5 0.113, d 5 0.41.
There were no differences between conditions with regards to hun-
ger ratings obtained before the taste task (high-addiction condi-
tion: M 5 63.26 6 20.91 mm; low-addiction condition: M 5 60.13 6
20.86 mm), t(60) 5 0.590, P 5 0.558, d 5 0.15. Similarly, there were
no between condition differences on appetite, mood, and taste rat-
ings (see Supporting Information). Finally, YFAS symptom countc,
and scores on the TFEQ-R and TFEQ-D did not differ between con-
ditions (Ps > 0.352), indicating that these measures were unaffected
by the bogus feedback. No participants fulfilled the YFAS diagnos-
tic criteria for food addiction.
Interim Discussion
Participants who were led to believe that they had scored highly on
an ostensible measure of food addiction consumed less snack food
than those who were led to believe that they had a low score. This
is consistent with the notion that believing in food addiction may
help people to limit their food intake. However, it is not possible to
determine the direction of the results; calorie intake may have
decreased in the high-addiction condition, increased in the low-
addiction condition, or both. Accordingly, study 2 included a control
condition in which participants were led to believe that they had
“average” food addiction tendencies. Study 2 also included a direct
test of the hypothesis that believing oneself to be a food addict
would decrease eating because it generates concern about one’s eat-
ing behavior. Specifically, it was predicted that those in the high-
addiction condition would demonstrate higher levels of dietary con-
cern than those in the low-addiction condition, and that this in turn
would lead them to reduce the amount of time that they exposed
themselves to the snack foods in the taste test. Finally, study 2
examined whether the food addiction manipulation influenced partic-
ipants’ more general beliefs about food-related self-control and their
future intentions to diet.
Study 2 Methods
Participants and design
Ninety female participants were recruited using the same procedure
as in study 1. In a between-subjects design, participants were ran-
domly allocated to high-, low-, or average-addiction conditions. We
powered the study (80% power) using GPOWER 3.1 to detect a
medium-large effect size (f 5 0.35, on the basis of study 1) at an a
level of P 5 0.05 and recruited slightly above the required sample
(N 5 84) to account for any participants guessing the study aims.
Measures and procedure
As in study 1, participants completed the computerized SST and
IAT tasks and received bogus feedback about their food addiction
tendencies. Those in the high- and low-addiction conditions received
the same feedback, and completed the same leading questionnaires
as in study 1. Participants in the average-addiction condition were
provided with bogus scores following each task which they were led
to believe represented average food addiction tendencies. This was
further enforced by the bogus histogram on which their scores corre-
sponded to the 50th percentile. Furthermore, those in the average-
addiction condition completed a version of the leading questionnaire
that consisted of two questions from the high-addiction condition,
and two questions from the low-addiction condition. In the interest
of maintaining consistency between conditions, those in the high-
and low-addiction conditions completed four leading questions,
rather than the five used in study 1.
The procedure was then identical to study 1, but with the following
additions: firstly, following the manipulation check, participants were
asked to indicate the extent to which they felt able to control their food
intake. Responses were provided on an 8-point scale ranging from
“extremely poor” to “extremely good.” Secondly, the amount of time
(in seconds) that participants took to complete the ad libitum taste test
was covertly recorded by the experimenter (consistent with study 1,
participants ended the taste task whenever they wished). Thirdly, after
completing the ad libitum taste task and subsequent hunger, fullness,
and enjoyment rating scales, participants indicated their level of die-
tary concern. Responses were provided on a 100 mm VAS which

dition. **Significant between-condition difference at P < 0.01. Error bars represent

cAnalysis using continuous YFAS sum scores (see Ref. (29)) also revealed no signifi-
cant difference between conditions, t(59) 5 1.11, P 5 0.270.

 ranged from “not at all concerned” to “extremely concerned.” Finally,
before completing the TFEQ-D, TFEQ-R, and YFAS, participants
completed the Dieting Intention Scale (30).
Study 2 Results
Participants who guessed the aims of the study (n 5 2), or who did not
believe in the concept of food addiction (n 5 3), were excluded from
analysesd. The remaining sample consisted of n 5 28 in the high-
addiction condition, n 5 29 in the low-addiction condition, and n 5 28
in the average-addiction condition. One-way ANOVAs revealed no
differences between conditions with regard to performance on the
computerized IAT and SST tasks, age, or BMI (Ps > 0.106).
A univariate ANOVA revealed a main effect of condition on self-
perceived food addiction, F(2,82)5 7.33, P5 0.001, gp
25 0.15. Specifi-
cally, those in the low-addiction condition believed less strongly that they
were food addicts (M5 2.106 0.72) compared with those in the high-
addiction condition (M5 3.006 1.05), P< 0.001, d 5 1.00, and the
average-addiction condition (M5 2.646 0.87), P5 0.025, d5 0.68.
Self-perceived food addiction did not differ significantly between the
high- and average-addiction conditions, P5 0.138, d5 0.37.
A 2 3 3 mixed ANOVA was conducted with food (crisps, choco-
late) as a within-subjects factor, and condition (high, average, low
addiction) as a between-subjects factor. There was a main effect of
condition on calorie intake, F(2,82) 5 3.82, P 5 0.026, gp
2 5 0.09 (see
Figure 2). Specifically, those in the high-addiction condition con-
sumed significantly fewer total calories than those in the low-,
P 5 0.024, d 5 0.58, and average-addiction conditions, P 5 0.015,
d 5 0.81. Total calorie intake did not differ significantly between
those in the low- and average-addiction conditions, P 5 0.837, d 5
0.05. The condition 3 food type interaction was not significant,
F(2,82) 5 1.30, P 5 0.278, gp(2) 5 0.031.
Univariate ANOVAs revealed main effects of condition on dietary
concern, F(2,82) 5 27.18, P < 0.001, gp
2 5 0.40, and time taken to
complete the taste task F(2,82) 5 5.23, P 5 0.007, gp
2 5 0.11. With
regard to dietary concern, those in the high-addiction condition had
significantly greater levels of concern (M 5 53.61 6 29.68 mm) than
those in the average-addiction condition (M 5 24.25 6 22.66 mm;
P < 0.001, d 5 1.11) and low-addiction condition (M 5 10.17 6
12.50 mm; P < 0.001, d 5 1.91). Those in the average-addiction con-
dition demonstrated significantly more concern than those in the
low-addiction condition, P 5 0.021, d 5 0.77. With regard to time-
taken, those in the high-addiction condition took less time to com-
plete the taste test (M 5 243.04 6 109.72 s) than those in the low-
addiction condition (M 5 369.90 6 199.80 s; P 5 0.007, d 5 0.79)
and average-addiction condition (M 5 373.32 6 192.12 s; P 5 0.006,
d 5 0.83). Time taken to complete the taste test did not differ
between those in the low- and average-addiction conditions, P 5
0.940, d 5 0.02.
We predicted that the effect of condition on calorie intake would be
mediated by levels of dietary concern which, in turn, would affect
the amount of time participants willingly spent exposed to the food
during the taste test. To test this hypothesis, a serial multiple media-
tion analysis was conducted using PROCESS (Model 6) (31,32). As
we had three experimental conditions, conditions were dummy
coded using the average-addiction condition as the reference cate-
gory against which high- and low-addiction conditions were com-
pared (see Supporting Information). There was a significant total
effect (Figure 3), and total indirect effect (Supporting Information
Table S1), of the high- versus average-addiction condition on calorie
intake. The high- versus average-addiction condition affected calorie
intake serially through dietary concern and time-taken, b 5 20.06
(0.03), 95% confidence interval 5 20.13 to 20.01. Specifically, the
reduced calorie intake observed in the high-, relative to average-,
addiction condition, was due to increased levels of dietary concern,
which were subsequently associated with reduced time taken to
complete the taste task. There was also a simple indirect effect of
the high- versus average-addiction condition on calorie intake
through
time-taken,

 calorie intake was no longer significant (Figure 3). There was no
total effect, b 5 20.12(0.09), P 5 0.216, or total indirect effect of
the low- versus average-addiction condition on calorie intake, and
none of the direct or indirect pathways in this model were signifi-
cant (Supporting Information Table S1).
There was no main effect of condition on self-control ratings or
Dieting Intention Scale scores (see Supporting Information). Further-
more, there were no differences between conditions with regards to
hunger

Notably, hunger ratings were similar across studies 1 and 2. Finally,
scores on the TFEQ-R and TFEQ-D, and YFAS symptom counte did
not differ between conditions (Ps > 0.264). A v2 analysis confirmed
that the number of people who fulfilled the YFAS diagnostic criteria
for food addiction (n 5 7) did not differ between conditions,

General Discussion
In study 1, participants who were led to believe that they scored
high in food addiction consumed fewer calories than participants
who were led to believe that they had scored low. Study 2 replicated
and extended this finding by showing that the effect of the high-
addiction condition on food intake was mediated by increased levels
of dietary concern, which subsequently reduced the amount of time
participants spent tasting and consuming the foods during the taste
test.
Hoyt et al. (16) recently demonstrated that an “obesity is a disease”
message was associated with reduced concern for body weight and
higher-calorie food choice in individuals who have obesity. This
public health message would appear to have similar connotations to
the food addiction perspective in that both imply diminished perso-
nal control over eating behavior and weight status. However, con-
trastingly, we found that leading people to believe themselves to be
food addicts increased concern about eating and, in turn, reduced
food intake. This may reflect differences between giving people gen-
eral versus personalized information about health (21). There may
also be different underlying conceptualizations of food addiction and
disease. The notion that obesity is a disease implies that it is a phys-
iological inevitability and therefore beyond personal control (33). In
contrast, in a recent survey, food addiction was regarded to be more
a matter of personal choice, and less of a disease, than other addic-
tions such as alcoholism (34). Self-reported food addicts may there-
fore retain some sense of control over their “addiction.” Indeed, in
this study, participants’ perceptions of their ability to control food
intake were not significantly influenced by the food addiction feed-
back. As such, believing oneself to be a food addict may not evoke
the same deleterious effects on self-regulation as holding disease-
based beliefs about one’s weight.
The inclusion of a control group in study 2 clarified that food intake
decreased in the high-addiction condition and did not increase in the
low-addiction condition. Such findings offer an alternative explanation
to that provided by Nordgren et al.’s (19) restraint bias theory, in
which it is proposed that an overconfidence in one’s ability for self-
control may cause people to overexpose themselves to tempting situa-
tions. Specifically, our findings showed that leading people to believe
that they are food addicts reduced exposure to and intake of snack
foods, as opposed to a counterproductive effect of overconfidence in
the group who were told they scored low in food addiction.
Few participants correctly guessed the aims of the research, suggest-
ing that the food addiction feedback was a plausible manipulation.
However, a potential limitation is that our findings may have been
driven by participants’ desire to prove the experimenter wrong. Spe-
cifically, upon receiving feedback that they had scored highly in
food addiction, participants may have refrained from eating large
amounts of food in an attempt to contradict their diagnosis as a
“food addict.” However, while such factors may have played a role,
findings from study 2 suggest that the effect of the feedback on
food intake was primarily driven by increased dietary concern.
Exposure to a food addiction explanation of obesity has recently
been shown to reduce weight stigma and blame towards individuals
who have obesity (35). This suggests that there may be beneficial
effects of believing in food addiction. To our knowledge, this study
is the first to provide insight into the causal influence of personal
food addiction beliefs on eating behavior. Notably, we tested a non-
clinical sample of female participants, and it is now important to
apply this approach to males and populations who have obesity.
Indeed, our belief manipulation may have an opposite effect on cal-
orie intake in individuals who have obesity, particularly if the feed-
back is congruent with pre-existing personal beliefs about eating
behavior. Future research should also consider the longevity of the
effect. Notably, in study 2 we did not uncover any significant effect
of personal food addiction beliefs on longer-term dieting intentions.
Previous research has shown that attempts to restrict food intake
over longer time periods can be futile by exacerbating cravings and
promoting disinhibited eating patterns (11,36,37). On this basis,
believing oneself to be a food addict might not be conducive to suc-
cessful longer-term dietary control and weight management.
In conclusion, we found that believing oneself to be a food addict
was associated with a subsequent reduction in calorie intake. By caus-
ing individuals to become more concerned about their eating behav-
ior, personal food addiction beliefs may help minimize the extent to
which people expose themselves to food. Further research should
establish the longer-term effects of personal food addiction beliefs
and the potential implications for dietary control and obesity.O
