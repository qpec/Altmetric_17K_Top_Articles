The peptidergic control circuit for sighing
Peng Li1*, Wiktor a. Janczewski2*, Kevin yackle1*, Kaiwen Kam2†, Silvia Pagliardini2†, Mark a. Krasnow1§ & Jack L. Feldman2§
A sigh is a long, deep breath often associated with sadness, yearning, 
exhaustion or relief. Sighs also occur spontaneously, from several per 
hour in humans to dozens per hour in rodents1,2. Their recurrence 
during normal breathing enhances gas exchange and may preserve 
lung integrity by reinflating collapsed alveoli2–4. Sighing increases in 
response to emotional and physiological stresses, including hypoxia 
and hypercapnia, and in anxiety disorders and other psychiatric 
 
conditions where it can become debilitating5,6.
The core of the breathing rhythm generator is the preBötC, a clus-
ter of several thousand neurons in ventrolateral medulla. preBötC is 
required for inspiration and generates respiratory rhythms in explanted 
brain slices7–10. Each rhythmic burst activates premotoneurons and 
motoneurons that contract the diaphragm and other inspiratory mus-
cles, generating a normal (‘eupneic’) breath10. Occasionally, a second 
preBötC burst immediately follows the first, and this ‘double burst’ 
leads to the augmented inspiration of a sigh11–13, typically about twice 
the volume of a normal breath14. Thus, the command for normal 
breaths and sighs both appear to emanate from preBötC.
A variety of neuromodulators and neuropeptides15,16, including frog 
bombesin15, can influence sighing in rodents. However, the endoge-
nous sigh control pathways have not been identified. We tested the 
effect of injecting bombesin into preBötC17, and we screened for genes 
selectively expressed in breathing control centres (K.Y. and M.A.K., 
in preparation). These parallel approaches led to identification of two 
bombesin-like neuropeptide pathways connecting the RTN/pFRG, 
another medullary breathing control centre18,19, to preBötC. We pro-
vide genetic, pharmacologic and neural ablation evidence that these 
pathways are critical endogenous regulators of sighing, and define the 
core of a dedicated sigh control circuit.
Neuromedin B links two breathing control centres
To identify breathing control genes, we screened > 
19,000 gene expres-
sion patterns in embryonic day 14.5 mouse hindbrain20 (K.Y. and 
M.A.K., in preparation). The most specific pattern was Nmb, one of 
two genes encoding bombesin-like neuropeptides in mammals. Nmb 
is expressed in the medulla surrounding the lateral half of the facial 
nucleus, in or near RTN/pFRG in mouse (Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data 
Fig. 1a) and rat (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Nmb mRNA was also detected 
in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).
Nmb expression was further characterized using an Nmb-GFP 
BAC transgene with the Nmb promotor driving GFP expression, 
which reproduced the endogenous Nmb pattern (Fig. 1b, c). Nmb-
GFP expressed in 206 ± 
 21 (mean ± 
 standard deviation (s.d.), n = 
 4) 
RTN/pFRG neurons per side, most of which (92%, n = 
 53 cells scored) 
co-expressed Nmb mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 1e–h). In CLARITY-
processed21 brainstems, GFP-labelled cells surrounded the lateral half of 
the facial nucleus, with the highest density ventral and dorsal (Fig. 1d, e 
 
and Supplementary Video 1). This ventral parafacial region is the 
RTN, an important sensory integration centre for breathing18,22,23. 
Nearly all Nmb-GFP-positive cells (96%; n = 
 202 cells from 2 animals) 
co-expressed canonical RTN marker PHOX2B24 (Fig. 1f), comprising 
one-quarter of the ~ 
800 PHOX2B-positive RTN neurons25.
Nmb-expressing neurons projected to preBötC (Fig. 1g, j). Punctate 
NMB staining was detected along the projections (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 2), with some puncta abutting somatostatin (SST)-positive preBötC 
 
neurons (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2). Approximately 90 preBötC 
neurons expressed Nmbr, the G-protein-coupled receptor specific for 
NMB (Fig. 1i, see later). Thus, Nmb-expressing RTN/pFRG neurons 
may directly modulate preBötC neurons.
NMB injection into preBötC induces sighing
To investigate the function of this NMB pathway, the peptide was micro-
injected into preBötC of urethane-anaesthetized adult rats. Before injec-
tion, and after control (saline) injections (data not shown), airflow and 
diaphragmatic activity (DIAEMG) showed the normal (eupneic) breath-
ing pattern, with diaphragm activity bursts during inspiration (Fig. 2a, b 
 
and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Every minute or two, we observed a sigh 
(44 ± 
 10 h−1, n = 
 24; unaffected by saline injection, Extended Data 
 
Fig. 3b), a biphasic double-sized breath coincident with a biphasic 
DIAEMG event (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a, c–f). Amplitude 
Sighs are long, deep breaths expressing sadness, relief or exhaustion. Sighs also occur spontaneously every few minutes to 
reinflate alveoli, and sighing increases under hypoxia, stress, and certain psychiatric conditions. Here we use molecular, 
genetic, and pharmacologic approaches to identify a peptidergic sigh control circuit in murine brain. Small neural 
subpopulations in a key breathing control centre, the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG), 
express bombesin-like neuropeptide genes neuromedin B (Nmb) or gastrin-releasing peptide (Grp). These project to 
the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the respiratory rhythm generator, which expresses NMB and GRP receptors in 
overlapping subsets of ~200 neurons. Introducing either neuropeptide into preBötC or onto preBötC slices, induced 
sighing or in vitro sigh activity, whereas elimination or inhibition of either receptor reduced basal sighing, and inhibition 
of both abolished it. Ablating receptor-expressing neurons eliminated basal and hypoxia-induced sighing, but left 
breathing otherwise intact initially. We propose that these overlapping peptidergic pathways comprise the core of a 
sigh control circuit that integrates physiological and perhaps emotional input to transform normal breaths into sighs.

and timescale of the first component of a sigh was indistinguishable 
from eupneic breaths, like human sighs26. Following bilateral NMB 
microinjection (100 nl, 3 μ 
M) into preBötC, sighing increased 6–17-fold 
(n = 
 5; Fig. 2a, c, d and Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). The effect peaked 
several minutes after injection and persisted for 10–15 min afterwards.
We also tested NMB on explanted preBötC brain slices of neona-
tal mice, where inspiratory activity is detected as rhythmic bursts of 
preBötC neurons and hypoglossal (cranial nerve XII) motoneuron 
output (Fig. 2e). Occasionally, a burst with two peaks (‘doublet’) 
was observed (Fig. 2e)11, a proposed in vitro signature of a sigh (see 
Methods). Addition of 10 nM and 30 nM NMB increased doublet 
frequency by 1.7-fold (P = 
 0.005; n = 
 7) and twofold, respectively 
(P = 
 0.003; n = 
 7) (Fig. 2e, f). The overall frequency of bursts and 
 
doublets together was unchanged (P = 
 0.2; n = 
 7), implying NMB con-
verts inspiratory bursts into sighs; indeed, in some preparations every 
inspiratory burst was converted to a doublet (Extended Data Fig. 5). 
We conclude that NMB acts directly on preBötC to increase sighing.
NMBR signalling maintains basal sighing
To determine if NMB signalling is required for sighing, we monitored 
breathing of awake, unrestrained Nmbr−/− knockout mice. Wild-type 
controls (C57BL/6) sighed 40 ± 
 11 h−1, whereas Nmbr−/− mutants 
sighed 29 ± 
 10 h−1 (n = 
 4; P < 
 0.001) (Fig. 2g). Sighing was also tran-
siently reduced ~ 
50% in anaesthetized rats by NMBR inhibition 
 
following bilateral preBötC injection of the antagonist BIM23042 
(100 nl, 6 μ 
M) (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 6a–d and 7a). The antag-
onist effect was selective for sighing as it did not significantly alter 
respiratory rate (117 ± 
 14 vs 109 ± 
 6 breaths per minute with antag-
onist, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.14) or tidal volume (2.1 ± 
 0.1 vs 2.0 ± 
 0.3 ml, n = 
 4, 
P = 
 0.46), and similar selectivity was observed for the Nmbr mutant 
(respiratory rate 218 ± 
 22 vs 254 ± 
 22 in Nmbr−/− mice, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.06; 
tidal volume 0.30 ± 
 0.03 vs 0.31 ± 
 0.04 ml, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.88). Thus NMBR 
signalling in preBötC maintains basal sighing.
A related neuropeptide pathway modulates sighing
Nmbr mutations and inhibition reduced but did not abolish sigh-
ing, suggesting involvement of other pathways. Grp, the only other 
bombesin-like neuropeptide gene in mammals27, was expressed in 
several dozen cells in the dorsal RTN/pFRG in mouse (Fig. 3a) and rat 
(Extended Data Fig. 8e), plus scattered cells in nucleus tractus solitarius 
(NTS) and parabrachial nucleus (PBN), two other breathing circuit 
nuclei10,28 (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). GRP-positive projections were 
traced from RTN/pFRG to preBötC, with some GRP puncta abutting 
SST-positive preBötC neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8f–i). GRP signals 
through GRPR, the receptor most similar to NMBR. Grpr mRNA was 
detected in ~ 
160 mouse preBötC neurons (Fig. 3b and see later), sug-
gesting GRP can also directly modulate preBötC function.
To determine if GRP regulates sighing, the neuropeptide (100 nl, 
 
3 μ 
M) was injected bilaterally into preBötC of anaesthetized rats. 
Sighing increased 8–16-fold (n = 
 5; Fig. 3c and Extended Data 
 
Fig. 4f–j). GRP (3 nM) application to mouse preBötC brain slices also 
increased sighing, producing 1.7-fold more doublets (P = 
 0.003; n = 
 9; 
Fig. 3d). Thus, GRP can induce sighing through direct modulation of 
preBötC neurons, like NMB.
To determine if GRPR signalling is required for sighing, we 
 
monitored breathing in Grpr−/− knockout mice. Their basal sigh rate 
(22 ± 
 9 per hour, n = 
 4) was half that of control wild-type mice (Fig. 3e), 
whereas eupneic breathing appeared normal (respiratory rate 218 ± 
 22 
vs 210 ± 
 16 in Grpr−/−, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.57; tidal volume 0.30 ± 
 0.03 vs 
0.28 ± 
 0.01 ml, n = 4, P = 
 0.23). GRPR inhibition by bilateral preBötC 
injection of antagonist RC3095 (100 nl, 6 μ 
M) in anaesthetized rats 
also transiently decreased sighing by ~ 
50% (n = 4), followed by rapid 
rebound and overshoot (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6e–h). There 
was no significant change in other respiratory parameters (respiratory 
rate 117 ± 
 12 vs 111 ± 
 11 with antagonist, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.34; tidal volume 
2.0 ± 
 0.2 vs 1.9 ± 
 0.1 ml, n = 
 4, P = 
 0.11). Thus, GRPR signalling in 
preBötC also maintains basal sighing.
Expression patterns, loss-of-function phenotypes and localized 
pharmacological manipulations of NMBR and GRPR signalling in 
preBötC suggest that NMB–NMBR and GRP–GRPR pathways can 
independently modulate sighing.
NMBR and GRPR are the critical pathways in sighing
To explore the relationship between NMB and GRP pathways, we 
compared expression patterns of the neuropeptides and receptors 
within mouse RTN/pFRG and preBötC. Nmb and Grp were detected 
in non-overlapping neuronal subpopulations, with Nmb neurons dis-
tributed throughout RTN/pFRG and Grp neurons restricted to the 
dorsal domain (Fig. 4a–d). In contrast, receptor expression patterns 
in preBötC overlapped (Fig. 4e–h), with 40 ± 
 16 neurons expressing 
Nmbr, 113 ± 45 expressing Grpr, and 49 ± 9 expressing both (n = 3).
To explore functional interactions, we injected both neuropeptides 
into preBötC of anaesthetized rats. Sigh rate increased 12–24-fold, 
which was similar or slightly beyond that of either neuropeptide alone 
(Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 4k–o). When NMBR and GRPR path-
ways were simultaneously inhibited by bilateral injection of both antag-
onists, BIM23042 (100 nl, 6 μ 
M) and RC3095 (100 nl, 6 μ 
M), sighing was

 6; Fig. 4j, Extended Data Fig. 6i–n). 
Thus, NMBR and GRPR pathways can independently modulate 
 
sighing, and together are required for basal sighing in vivo.
Effect of NMBR and GRPR neuron ablation
To determine if preBötC NMBR- and GRPR-expressing neurons 
function specifically in sigh control, we ablated them using bombesin 
 
(BBN), which binds both receptors27, conjugated to saporin 
(BBN–SAP), a ribosomal toxin that induces neuronal death when 
 
internalized8. Three days after bilateral BBN–SAP injection (200 nl, 
6.15 ng per side) into preBötC of rats, sighing was reduced ~ 
80%, 
from 24 ± 3 h−1 before injection to 5 ± 4 h−1 three days after injection 
(P = 5 × 10−6; n = 7) (Fig. 5a). The effect was selective as other aspects 
of breathing and behaviour appeared normal. Five days after injection, 
 
sighing was almost completely (~ 
95%) abolished, decreasing to 
0.6 ± 0.6 h−1 (P = 10−8; n = 6; Fig. 5a). Other aspects of breathing and

behaviour again appeared generally intact (Extended Data Fig. 9a, b). 
However, after 5 days we noted increasing episodes of apneas or dis-
ordered breathing, possibly a consequence of the loss of sighing (see 
Discussion). Ablation prevented sigh induction by exogenous BBN 
infusion into the cisterna magna, confirming preBötC Nmbr- and Grpr-
expressing neurons were eliminated (Extended Data Fig. 9c). However, 
BBN infusion still triggered intense scratching and licking, demonstrating 
 
that the Grpr and Nmbr neurons outside the preBötC required for these 
behaviours29 remained intact. We conclude that preBötC Nmbr and 
Grpr-expressing neurons have a critical and selective function in basal 
sighing.
NMBR and GRPR neurons are critical for induced sighs
To determine if the Nmbr and Grpr-expressing neurons are also impor-
tant for physiologically-induced sighs, we examined BBN–SAP rats 
exposed to hypoxia (8% O2). In control rats injected with unconju-
gated SAP, sighing increased from 24 ± 
 5 to 140 ± 
 14 h−1 under hypoxia 
(n = 
 3, P = 
 0.01). In contrast, five days after BBN–SAP injection, sigh 
rate under hypoxia was 5.1 ± 
 7.9 h−1 (n = 
 6, P = 
 0.2, hypoxia vs room air 
at day 5; Fig. 5b); three of these rats did not sigh in room air (21% O2) 
 
and no sighs were triggered by hypoxia. In BBN–SAP rats, hypoxia 
increased respiratory rate from 150 ± 
 5 to 230 ± 
 19 breaths per min, 
demonstrating ventilatory response to hypoxia was intact. Thus, Nmbr-
expressing and Grpr-expressing neurons are also critical for hypoxia- 
induced sighing, but not other respiratory responses to hypoxia.
Discussion
Our results show sighing is controlled by two largely parallel 
 
bombesin-like neuropeptide pathways, NMB and GRP, which 
mediate signalling between key medullary breathing control 
 
centres. Approximately 200 Nmb-expressing and ~ 
30 Grp-expressing 
 
neurons in neighbouring domains of RTN/pFRG, a region impli-
cated in integrating respiratory sensory cues and generation of active 
 
expiration23,28,30, project to preBötC, the respiratory rhythm generator. 
 
A total of 7% (~ 
200) of preBötC neurons express Nmbr (~ 
40 neurons), 
Grpr (~ 
110) or both receptors (~ 
50), activation of which increased 
sighing 6-fold to 24-fold, whereas sighing was effectively abolished 
by inhibition or deletion of the receptors, or ablation of the receptor- 
expressing neurons.
We propose the above neurons, perhaps with Grp-expressing NTS 
and PBN neurons, comprise the core of a peptidergic sigh control 
 
circuit, with the neuropeptide-expressing neurons integrating inputs 
from sites monitoring physiological and perhaps emotional state 
(Fig. 5c). Excitation of these neurons and secretion of either neuropeptide 
 
activates the cognate receptor-expressing preBötC neurons, which 
initiate sighs by altering activity of other preBötC neurons to convert 
normal breaths to sighs. This might occur by a burst of NMB and/or 
GRP secretion triggering a second inspiratory signal in the preBötC 
during or immediately after the first, resulting in a single, double-sized 
breath. Alternatively, NMB and GRP secretion might be more gradu-
ally modulated, causing concentration-dependent bursts in activity of 
receptor-expressing neurons or a shift in preBötC properties towards 
states favouring more frequent doublet bursts.
A priority will be to elucidate the full circuit and properties of the 
constituent neurons, including its integration with other peptides and 
neurotransmitters that influence sighing15,16 and with normal breathing 
and other behaviours. A curious aspect of the circuit already apparent 
is the central role of two partially overlapping and closely related neu-
ropeptide pathways. Do NMB- and GRP-expressing neurons receive 
different inputs and have distinct sensing functions, and do the three

Figure 5 | Effect on sighing of ablating preBötC NMBR-expressing 
and GRPR-expressing neurons. a, b, Basal (a) and hypoxia-induced 
(b) sigh rates before (control) and 3 or 5 days after preBötC injections of 
bombesin–saporin (200 nl, 6.2 ng; BBN–SAP ablation) to ablate NMBR- 
and GRPR-expressing neurons, or 5 days after saporin alone (200 nl, 6.2 ng; 
Blank–SAP). Data as mean ± s.d.; P < 0.05 (BBN–SAP ablation vs control 
rats at day 3 or 5 for both room air (a) and hypoxia (b)). Sample size n = 6 
(control), 3 (Blank–SAP), 7 (day 3), 6 (day 5). c, Model of peptidergic sigh 
control circuit. NMB- and GRP-expressing neurons in RTN/pFRG  
(and perhaps GRP-expressing neurons in NTS and PBN) receive 
physiological and perhaps emotional input from other brain regions, 
stimulating neuropeptide secretion. This activates receptor-expressing 
preBötC neurons expressing their receptors, which transform the normal 
preBötC rhythm to sighs. (Because neuropeptides induce sighs separated 
by normal breaths (Fig. 2a), there must be some refractory mechanism in 
or downstream of receptor-expressing neurons that temporarily prevents a 
second sigh.)

sets of receptor-expressing neurons (NMBR, GRPR, NMBR + GRPR) 
converge on the same preBötC neurons to effect a sigh, or signal to 
different preBötC neurons producing distinct types of sighs?
A striking aspect of our results is the selectivity of the circuit for sighing. 
 
Inhibition of the pathways, and even ablation of receptor-expressing 
 
neurons, had little effect on other aspects of breathing, at least in the 
short term. This can now be exploited to test the classical hypothesis 
for the physiological function of sighing—re-expansion of alveoli that 
collapse during breathing and maintenance of lung integrity2–4, and 
to investigate psychological benefits. Identification of the key neuro-
peptide pathways suggests pharmacologic approaches for controlling 
excessive sighing and inducing sighs in patients that cannot breathe 
deeply on their own. Dozens of molecularly distinct preBötC neuronal 
types have been identified recently (K.Y. and M.A.K., in preparation); 
perhaps they serve similarly specific roles in other respiratory-related 
behaviours like yawning, sniffing, crying, and laughing.

Animals. All procedures were carried out in accordance with animal care standards 
in National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, and approved by the University 
of California, Los Angeles Animal Research Committee, or Stanford Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee. All mouse strains used were in the C57BL/6 
genetic background. Nmb-GFP BAC transgenic mice (Tg(Nmb-EGFP)IT50Gsat/
Mmucd), carrying EGFP coding sequence inserted upstream of the Nmb start 
codon in the BAC, were from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers 
 
(catalogue number 030425-UCD, https://www.mmrrc.org). Nmbr−/− and 
Grpr−/− null mutant mice, in which exon 2 of the endogenous gene was replaced 
by a neomycin-resistance cassette using homologous recombination, have been 
described31,32. Male Sprague Dawley rats were from Charles River.
In situ hybridization, immunostaining and reporter expression. For in situ 
hybridization, mouse brains were harvested and fixed overnight in 4% paraform-
aldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), cryopreserved in 30% sucrose and 
embedded in optical cutting temperature compound (OCT). Transverse sections 
were cut at 16–20 μ 
m and stored at − 
80 °C until use. Sections were post-fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde before treatment with hydrochloric acid, proteinase K, 
and then triethanolamine/acetic anhydride. Hybridization was carried out with 
in vitro transcribed and digoxygenin-labelled riboprobes at 58 °C overnight. Signal 
was detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin (DIG) primary 
antibody (Roche) and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and bromochloroindolyl 
phosphate (NBT/BCIP) Reagent Kit (Roche) or using Horse Radish Peroxidase-
coupled anti-DIG primary antibody (Roche) and Tyramide Signal Amplification 
plus Fluorescent Substrate Kit (PerkinElmer).
For double fluorescent in situ hybridization, tissue was harvested, embedded in 
OCT and then sectioned. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated 
and treated with pretreatment reagent (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Double fluo-
rescent in situ assay was then performed using proprietary RNAscope technology 
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics) with cyanine 3 labelled Nmbr probes and fluorescein 
isothiocyanate labelled Grpr probes.
For Nmb-GFP reporter expression analysis, the brains of Nmb-GFP mice 
were harvested and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then cryopre-
served at 4 °C in 30% sucrose overnight. Tissue was embedded in OCT and sec-
tioned at 10–40 μ 
m. Tissue sections were rinsed with PBT (PBS + 
 0.1% Tween), 
blocked with 3% bovine serum (BSA) in PBT for 1 h, and incubated with primary 
antibody overnight at 4 °C. Sections were rinsed in PBT and incubated for 1 h 
at room temperature with species-specific secondary antibodies. Primary anti-
bodies were: chicken anti-GFP (Abcam 13970; used at 1:1,000 dilution), goat anti-
PHOX2B (Santa Cruz, sc-13224; 1:200 dilution), rabbit anti-NMB (Sigma-Aldrich, 
SAB1301059; 1:100 dilution), rabbit anti-GRP (Immunostar 20073; 1:4,000 dilu-
tion), and rat anti-SST (Millipore, MAB354; 1:50 dilution). Secondary antibodies 
 
included donkey anti-chicken (Jackson Immuno Research; 1:400 dilution), don-
key anti-rat (Jackson Immuno Research; 1:400 dilution), donkey anti-rabbit 
(Jackson Immuno Research; 1:400 dilution) and donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen; 
 
1:500 dilution).
For Nmb-GFP expression analysis in samples prepared by CLARITY21, Nmb-
GFP mice were perfused with PBS and formaldehyde-acrylamide hydrogel, and 
brain tissue was harvested and incubated in hydrogel monomer solution at 4 °C for 
3 days. Tissue was then embedded in polymerized hydrogel by raising the temper-
ature to 37 °C for 3 h. Blocks of 1 mm thickness were cut and washed in 4% sodium 
dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in sodium borate buffer at 37 °C for 2 to 3 weeks. Samples 
were washed with PBST for 2 days and incubated in FocusClear (CelExplorer), and 
GFP fluorescence was imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.
Sigh monitoring and analysis. For awake animals, individual animals were placed 
in a whole body plethysmography chamber (Buxco) at room temperature (22 °C) 
in 21% O2 (for normoxia) or 8% O2 (for hypoxic challenge) balanced with N2. 
Sighs were identified in plethysmography traces by the characteristic biphasic 
ramp, the augmented flow in the second phase of the inspiratory effort and the 
prolongation of expiratory time following the event. Sighs were also confirmed by 
visual monitoring of breathing behaviour. Given the high amplitude and distinctive 
waveform of sighs relative to standard eupneic breaths, sighs were unambiguously 
identified by both visual and computer-assisted scoring; no difference was detected 
in direct comparisons between methods or observers, so visual scoring was used. 
Female 8-week-old mice (Nmbr−/−, Grpr−/−, or C57BL/6 as wild-type control) 
were acclimated to the chamber for 10 min, and then the first fifteen recorded 
sighs were used to calculate the sigh rate. Similar sigh rates were observed for each 
animal when assayed on different days. Rats were acclimated to the chamber for 
 
~ 
1 h, and then baseline sigh rate and respiratory frequency were calculated for the 
next 2 h. For hypoxic (8% O2) challenge, analysis was continued for 30 min under 
the hypoxic condition.
For anaesthetized rats, the trachea was cannulated and connected to a 
 
pneumotachograph (GM Instruments) to record airflow. A flow calibration was 
performed after every experiment along with a calculation of tidal volume (VT) 
by digital integration. To monitor diaphragm activity, wire electrodes (Cooner 
Wire) were implanted into the diaphragm and electromyogram (EMG) signal 
 
sampled at 2 kHz (Powerlab 16SP; AD Instruments). Signal was rectified and digitally 
 
integrated (time constant of 0.1) to obtain a moving average using LabChart Pro 
8 (AD Instruments) and Igor Pro 6 (Data Matrix) software. Sighs were identified 
in the airflow measurements as above and validated by double peaks in the EMG 
recordings.
preBötC injection of NMB and GRP agonists and antagonists. Male Sprague 
Dawley rats (n = 
 24) weighing 320–470 g were anaesthetized with urethane 
 
(1.5 g per kg), isoflurane (0.3–0.7 vol%), and ketamine (20 mg per kg per hour) 
and injected i.p. with atropine (0.3 mg per kg), then placed in a supine position 
in a stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments). A tracheostomy tube was 
placed in the trachea through the larynx, and the basal aspect of the occipital bone 
was removed to expose the ventral medulla. Injections were placed 750 μ 
m caudal 
from the most rostral root of the hypoglossal nerve (RRXII), 2 mm lateral to the 
midline, and 700 μ 
m dorsal to the ventral medullary surface. Small corrections 
were made to avoid puncturing blood vessels on the medulla. Microinjection was 
done using a series of pressure pulses (Picospritzer; Parker-Hannifin) applied to 
the open end of micropipettes, with air pressure set so that each pulse ejected ~ 
5 nl 
and a total volume of 0.1 μ 
l was injected on each side. The concentration of injected 
neuropeptides and antagonists were: NMB, 3 μ 
M; GRP, 3 μ 
M; NMB and GRP, 3 μ 
M 
each; BIM23042 (ref. 33), 6 μ 
M; RC3095 (ref. 34), 6 μ 
M; BIM23042 and RC3095, 
6 μ 
M each. To verify the accuracy of the injections, fluorescent polystyrene beads 
(0.2 μ 
m FluoSpheres (Invitrogen; catalogue #F8811, #F8763 or #F8807); 2–5% vol) 
were added to the injected solutions, and following injection and physiological 
measurements the location of the fluorescent beads was visualized in wet tissue 
double stained for reelin and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) to identify the 
 
preBötC.
Ablation of NMBR and GRPR-expressing preBötC neurons. Bilateral preBötC 
injections of saporin conjugated with either bombesin (BBN–SAP; Advanced 
Targeting System; 200 nl, 6.2 ng) or a non-targeted peptide (blank SAP; Advanced 
Targeting System; 200 nl, 6.2 ng) were performed in 300–350 g rats under 
 
anaesthesia (ketamine (90 mg per kg), and xylazine (10 mg per kg), administered 
i.p) using standard aseptic procedures. Rats were positioned on a stereotaxic frame 
with bregma 5 mm below lambda. The occipital bone was exposed and a small 
window was opened to perform BBN–SAP injections with a 40 μ 
m diameter tip 
glass pipette inserted into the preBötC. Coordinates were (in mm): 0.9 rostral, 
 
2.0 lateral, and 2.8 ventral to the obex. The electrode was left in place for 5 min after 
injection to minimize backflow of solution up the electrode track. After injection, 
a fine polyethylene cannula was implanted and cemented to the occipital bone to 
deliver BBN into the fourth ventricle. Neck muscles and skin were sutured back 
at the end of the surgery and rats were allowed to recover with pain medication, 
food and water ad libitum. Blank–SAP and BBN–SAP treated rats were tested 
for hypoxia (8% O2 balanced with nitrogen, 30 min challenge) five days after 
 
surgery. Blank–SAP and BBN–SAP treated rats were also tested for response to 
BBN infusion in the cistern magna six days after surgery. The cannula implanted in 
the fourth ventricle was connected to a fine polyethylene tubing under isoflurane 
anaesthesia, and after recovery and placement of rats in a plethysmographic cham-
ber, 10 μ 
g of BBN diluted in 20 μ 
l sterile saline was delivered followed by a 20 μ 
l 
 
saline washout. Sigh rate and respiratory rate were calculated for 30 min following 
infusion and compared to pre-infusion values.
In vitro slice preparation, recording, and analysis. Rhythmic 550-μ 
m-thick 
transverse medullary slices containing the preBötC and XII nerve from neonatal 
C57BL/6 mice (P0–5) were prepared as described previously11. The medullary 
slice was cut in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 
 
3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, and 30 d-glucose, equili-
brated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (4 °C, pH = 7.4). For recording, extracellular K+ 
was raised to 9 mM to replace excitatory afferent drive lost in the cutting process. 
Slices were perfused at 27 °C and 4 ml min−1 and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. 
Respiratory activity reflecting suprathreshold action potential (AP) firing from 
populations of neurons was recorded as XII bursts from either XII nerve roots 
and as population activity directly from the preBötC using suction electrodes and 
a MultiClamp 700A or 700B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), filtered at 
2–4 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Digitized data were analysed off-line using custom 
procedures written for IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR, USA). Activity was 
full-wave rectified and digitally integrated with a Paynter filter with a time con-
stant of 20 ms with either custom built electronics or using custom procedures in 
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).

Burst detection and analysis of respiratory-related activity recorded in full-wave 
rectified XII output or preBötC population recordings were performed using cus-
tom software written in IgorPro. Burst parameters were normalized to the mode of 
the data in the baseline condition. Although there are several proposed definitions 
of sighs in slice preparations12,13, here we used ‘doublets’ (double-peaked bursts) as 
the in vitro signature of sighs because, in our preparations, doublets detected both 
in preBötC neural population activity measurements and cranial nerve XII output 
recordings shared the increased inspiratory and expiratory duration of sighs11. 
Furthermore, as demonstrated here, doublet rate increased following application 
of NMB or GRP to preBötC slice preparations (Figs 2 and 3 and Extended Data 
Fig. 5), as did sigh rate in vivo following preBötC injection of the same neuropep-
tides (Figs 2 and 3). The frequency and waveform of doublets in slice preparations 
does not closely match those of sighs in intact animals, presumably due to the 
absence in vitro of important inputs modulating burst shape; indeed, the doublets 
more closely resemble sighs in vagotomized animals, where they appear as equal 
amplitude double-peaked breaths11,17. We scored a burst as a doublet if the burst 
displayed a second peak that reached 20% or more of the amplitude of the first 
burst, and this second peak occurred after more than twice the time from start to 
peak or if the burst had a duration longer than eight times the time from start to 
peak. All doublets were verified by visual inspection to exclude multipeaked bursts 
and two bursts that were too far apart. Measured doublet intervals were converted 
to a calculated per hour doublet rate.
Statistics. Data are represented as mean ± 
 standard deviation (s.d.). Statistical 
significance was uniformly set at a minimum of P < 
 0.05. For comparisons 
of two groups, the assumption for normal distribution was determined by the 
 
Shapiro–Wilk test with the critical W value set at 5% significance level. The t-tests 
were conducted, with the exception in Fig. 3e, in which a Mann–Whitney U-test 
was used. For statistical comparisons of more than two groups, an ANOVA was 
first performed. In most cases, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used for 
comparisons of various parameters in different conditions and for making com-
parisons across different events. If the null hypothesis (equal means) was rejected, 
 
post-hoc paired t-tests were then used for pairwise comparisons of interest. Individual 
 
P values are reported, but Holm–Bonferroni analysis for multiple comparisons was 
conducted to correct for interactions between the multiple groups. Histograms 
were normalized by the total sample size to generate plots of the relative frequency 
of each value where the y value of each bin represents the fraction of the total 
 
number of samples for that experiment. Randomization and blinding were not 
used. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size.

Extended Data Figure 2 | Serial confocal preBötC sections showing 
Nmb-GFP projections contain puncta of NMB. a–d, Serial confocal 
optical sections (0.6 μ 
m apart) through preBötC brain region of Nmb-GFP 
mouse immunostained for GFP (green), NMB (red), preBötC marker SST 
(white), and DAPI (blue) as in Fig. 2h. Note the GFP-positive projection 
with a puncta of NMB (yellow, open arrows in b, c) directly abutting an 
SST positive neuron (asterisk). Most NMB puncta (open arrowheads) were 
detected within GFP-positive projections as expected, and only a small 
fraction of NMB puncta (closed arrowhead) were detected outside them; 
NMB outside Nmb-GFP projections could be secreted protein or the rare 
Nmb-expressing cells that do not co-express the Nmb-GFP transgene  
(see Extended Data Fig. 1e–h). Scale bar, 20 μ

preBötC slice. a, Neuronal activity trace(∫XII, black; ∫preBötC population 
activity, grey) of preBötC slice containing 30 nM NMB, as in Fig. 2e. Note 
the extreme effect of NMB in which every burst (‘breath’) in the trace is a 
doublet (‘sigh’
, asterisk). Bar, 5 s. b, c, NMB increases the doublet rate by 
increasing the fraction of total events that are doublets (b) and decreasing 
the interval following a doublet (c). Data are mean ± s.d., * 
P < 0.05 by 
paired t-test, n = 7. d, e, GRP also increases the doublet rate by increasing 
the fraction of total events that are doublets (d) and decreasing the interval 
following a doublet (e). Data are mean ± s.d., * 
P < 0.05 by paired t-test, 
n = 9. Note that post-doublet intervals are significantly longer than  
post-burst intervals under all conditions, consistent with longer post-sigh 
apneas in vivo.
