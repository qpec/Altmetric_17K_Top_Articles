The emergence of immuno-oncology as the first broadly 
successful strategy for metastatic cancer will require clinicians  
to integrate this new pillar of medicine with chemotherapy, 
radiation, and targeted small-molecule compounds. Of equal 
importance is gaining an understanding of the limitations 
and toxicities of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy was initially 
perceived to be a relatively less toxic approach to cancer treatment 
than other available therapies—and surely it is, when compared 
to those. However, as the use of immunotherapy becomes 
more common, especially as first- and second-line treatments, 
immunotoxicity and autoimmunity are emerging as the Achilles’ 
heel of immunotherapy. In this Perspective, we discuss evidence 
that the occurrence of immunotoxicity bodes well for the 
patient, and describe mechanisms that might be related to the 
induction of autoimmunity. We then explore approaches to limit 
immunotoxicity, and discuss the future directions of research and 
reporting that are needed to diminish it. 
Immuno-oncology drug development presently encompasses a broad 
range of agents, including antibodies, peptides, proteins, small mol-
ecules, adjuvants, cytokines, oncolytic viruses, bispecific molecules, 
and cellular therapies1. A survey of recent literature indicates that 
adverse events affecting nearly every organ system have been reported 
in association with cancer immunotherapy (Fig. 1). However, one 
baseline assumption is that, at present, the frequency of autoimmune 
complications following cancer immunotherapy is probably underes-
timated, in part because most cancer trials follow patients for only a 
brief time after enrollment (typically 6 months), and some symptoms, 
such as lethargy, might have an unclear etiology. The true incidence 
is probably further underestimated still, because the numerator does 
not include patients who died from their cancer. Related to this, the 
incidence of certain immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is corre-
lated with an increased probability of prolonged survival2. However, 
these associations might be related to lead-time bias, because patients 
whose tumors progress succumb to their disease, whereas those who 
respond to immunotherapies have longer treatment duration and 
more time to develop autoimmune toxicities. In addition, immuno-
toxicity, as presently defined3, can have a delayed onset. For instance, 
some cases of graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic stem cell 
 
transplantation (HSCT) can take more than a year to manifest4. Onset 
of thyroiditis has been reported as late as 3 years after the initiation of 
therapy with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) 
 
antagonist ipilimumab5. Adding more complexity, the natural his-
tory of certain autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), is 
unpredictable; the onset of clinical disease manifestations can vary from 
weeks to decades after the appearance of islet autoantibodies6.
The existence of paraneoplastic syndromes in oncology has 
long been known to clinicians, antedating immune-checkpoint 
blockade, and it provides the clearest example of naturally occur-
ring tumor immunity and autoimmunity in humans. Patients with 
occult or advanced tumors may develop a wide variety of syndromes, 
 
varying from myasthenia gravis to cerebellar degeneration, owing 
to acquired cellular and/or humoral immunity to antigens expressed 
by the tumor7. In small-cell lung cancer, the occurrence of paraneo-
plastic syndromes can portend prolonged survival8. These observa-
tions raise the question of whether deliberate attempts to provoke 
paraneoplastic syndrome should be attempted, and, on a related note, 
whether the occurrence of these syndromes will increase with increas-
ing numbers of cancer patients exposed to immune-checkpoint- 
blockade administration.
Previous studies have described the evolving spectrum of immu-
notherapy-associated irAEs3,9,10. Here we provide further perspective 
on the emerging clinical syndromes of immunotoxicity and autoim-
munity in cancer therapy.
Barriers to immune recognition of tumors
Immune tolerance is crucial for preventing autoimmunity, and now, 
we suspect that it might also be highly relevant to cancer immunity. 
Immune tolerance is defined as a lack of lymphocyte reactivity to self-
antigens or foreign-tissue antigens in an organ graft, achieved with-
out the need for long-term immunosuppression and while retaining 
immune competence and reactivity to all other foreign antigens11. 
Immune tolerance starts in the thymus, where the diverse T cell recep-
tor (TCR) repertoire is created through random somatic recombination 
events. Autoreactive T cell progenitors expressing TCRs that bind with 
high affinity to self-peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
complexes are deleted through a process called negative selection. The 
transcription factor autoimmune regulator (AIRE), which is selectively 
expressed by a subset of CD80-expressing medullary thymic epithelial 
cells (TECs), drives the expression of tissue-specific self-antigens to 
ensure selective removal of thymocytes bearing TCRs that recognize 
these antigens12. Thymocytes that have low affinity for self-peptide-
MHC complexes are positively selected to progress to the periphery. In 
addition, some thymocytes expressing TCRs that bind with high affin-
ity to self-antigen peptide–MHC complexes differentiate into Forkhead 
box protein 3 (FOXP3)-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells13.

As T cells exit the thymus, additional peripheral tolerance mecha-
nisms prevent autoreactive T cells that escaped negative selection 
from reacting to or attacking self-antigen-expressing healthy cells. 
These include T cell–intrinsic mechanisms, such as immunological 
ignorance, anergy, exhaustion, phenotypic skewing, and apoptosis, as 
well as extrinsic-cell-based mechanisms14. Among the latter, Treg cells 
stand out as unique because they are comprised both of ‘central’ Treg 
cells—formed from high-affinity interactions with self-peptide–MHC 
complexes in the thymus, as mentioned above—and ‘peripheral’ Treg 
cells, formed from T cells that engage in prolonged interactions with 
low-affinity self-antigens and non-self-antigens, such as allergens, 
food and commensal microbiota. Together, these pathways help to 
maintain peripheral tolerance to self-antigens and certain foreign 
antigens13,15. Therefore, although tumors express tumor-specific 
neoantigens and overexpress self-antigens that can potentially initiate 
 
a potent anti-tumor immune response16, the immune system has 
developed a complex, redundant, and robust combination of cells 
and molecules all designed to keep the immune system in check and 
avoid unwanted inflammation and tissue damage17.
Several specific cases exemplify the degree to which tumors can take 
advantage of immune-tolerance mechanisms to disrupt anti-tumor 
immunity. Some tumor-associated  antigens, such as tyrosinase-related 
protein 1 (TYRP1, also known as TRP1), are expressed in medullary 
thymic epithelial cells18. In addition, tumors can escape anti-tumor 
T cell responses by decreasing their expression of tumor-associated 
antigens and/or MHC molecules; by secreting immunosuppres-
sive soluble factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, stromal- 
cell-derived factor, interleukin 10, interleukin 6, transforming 
growth factor-β, adenosine, and prostaglandins); and/or by engaging 
immune checkpoints (CTLA-4, PD-1, Tim-3, and LAG-3) that sup-
press anti-tumor activity. Immunosuppressive cells, including mye-
loid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), Treg cells, tumor-associated 
macrophages, regulatory B cells, and regulatory dendritic cells19,20, 
present within the tumor microenvironment can also suppress 
 
anti-tumor responses21.
Therapeutic induction of anti-tumor responses
Clinical development and approval of immunomodulators, also 
known as immune-checkpoint inhibitors, have transformed the 
treatment of certain tumors, such as melanoma, non-small-cell lung 
cancer, and bladder cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors act by blocking 
interactions that normally suppress T cell responses. The binding 
of CTLA-4 on naive T cells in the lymph nodes to B7 on antigen-
presenting cells (APCs) produces an inhibitory signal during the 
primary phase of T cell activation (Fig. 2). CTLA-4 can also strip B7 
molecules—which are ligands for CD28 costimulatory molecules on 
T cells—from the APCs through a process of transendocytosis, which 
further impairs T cell activation22. Thus, the blockade of CTLA-4 
leads to a more robust costimulatory signal, and this boosted signal 
may enable otherwise naive T cells with weak affinity to respond to 
overexpressed and mutant tumor antigens. CTLA-4 is also expressed 
on CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+ Treg cells, and its engagement leads to 
enhanced IL-35, IL-10, TGF-β, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO) production, Treg cell proliferation, and decreased effector 
 
T cell activation and proliferation23.
By contrast, PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 regulates those 
already activated T cells later in the immune response in the periph-
eral tissues. PD-1 engagement inhibits T cell proliferation, IFN-γ, 
TNF-α, and IL-2 production24, although some data suggest that it 
may also be involved in early T cell activation25, central tolerance, 
and regulation of negative selection26. In addition to the direct 
effect of checkpoints on effector T cells, blockade of the molecular 
interactions can also affect the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
For example, altering IDO expression and CTLA-4 engagement on 
APCs, and decreasing Treg cells in the TME through mechanisms 
such as STING/IFN-αβ signaling and myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells improves cancer immunity27.
Autoimmune consequences
Considering their diverse mechanisms of action, it is perhaps not 
surprising that these immunomodulators induce multiple immune-
mediated adverse events that lead to antigen-specific autoimmune 
manifestations. In humans, autoimmune manifestations caused by 
drugs targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways seem to be dependent 
on the pathway(s) targeted5,10,28,29. For example, the most commonly 
reported endocrine irAE following therapy with the CTLA-4-blocking 
antibody ipilimumab is hypophysitis, an event that is rarely observed 
after PD-1-antibody therapy. Ectopic expression of CTLA-4 in the 
pituitary gland may be responsible for this effect30, and antibody-
dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) with activation of 
complement might be involved in the destruction of the hypophy-
sis. By contrast, the most commonly reported endocrine-related 
 
toxicity after PD-1-antibody therapy is hypothyroidism, a syndrome 
that is rarely observed in patients treated with ipilimumab. These 
 
autoimmune syndromes could be a consequence of revealing pre-
existing conditions in these patients. However, with one excep-
tion31, analysis of pre-existing autoantibodies and single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with autoimmune disease has not 
proved useful in the identification of patients at risk for irAE.
Given that the function of CTLA-4 is to primarily affect CD4+ 
T cells at an early stage in lymphatic tissue, its blockade might be 
expected to have broader and more nonspecific consequences than

the blockade of PD-1, which interacts with its ligand primarily within 
the peripheral tissue and tumor microenvironment32. Moreover, 
CTLA-4 inhibition lowers the threshold required for T cell activa-
tion, which results in increased expansion and diversification of 
circulating, low-avidity T cells33; it also causes an Fc-γR-mediated 
depletion of Treg cells34. In agreement with this, treatment with ipili-
mumab was found to broaden the TCR repertoire more robustly, 
within 2 weeks, in those experiencing irAEs than in those without 
irAEs, and treatment response improved along with the increase in 
TCR diversity. This further underscores cancer immunotherapy as a 
double-edged sword in which patients and clinicians must weigh the 
risk of immunotoxicity against the benefit of tumor destruction35. 
By comparison, PD-1 blockade is likely to reinvigorate a previously 
overactive immune system32; studies of T cell exhaustion in chronic 
infection show that PD-1 functions to limit effector T cell–mediated 
inflammatory injury36. Studies of individuals with cancer have not 
yet compared T cell exhaustion profiles from patients treated with 
PD-1 with those from patients receiving CTLA-4 blockade as treat-
ment. Some effects, however, might be common to CTLA-4 and PD-1 
blockade. For example, local Treg cells in the TME of human tumors 
also show upregulated expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 (ref. 37), and 
therefore, might be affected by PD-1 blockade; if this is the case, then 
alterations in Treg cell activity might contribute to both PD-1- and 
CTLA-4-induced autoimmunity.
An anti-tumor immune response can kill tumor cells, and host 
APCs can then pick up the antigens, which, in a form of antigen 
presentation referred to as cross-presentation, leads to the priming 
of secondary immune responses. There is increasing evidence that 
cross-presentation of neoantigens or shared antigens might induce 
a loss of tolerance and subsequent autoimmunity in patients treated 
with checkpoint blockade. In two patients with fulminant myocarditis 
resulting from a combination treatment of ipilimumab and nivolumab, 
an analysis of T cells infiltrating the skeletal muscle, myocardium, and 
tumor revealed an increase in the most abundant TCR type in one 
of the patients; tumors in both patients expressed abundant muscle- 
specific antigens, including desmin and troponin38. This led to 
the suggestion that an epitope shared by tumor and healthy tissue 
 
contributed to the myocarditis, but it is also possible that this find-
ing was coincidental, because no predominant TCR clonotype was 
detected in the other patient38.
Indeed, autoimmune manifestations may be indirect and due to 
epitope spreading (ES) caused by immunotherapy-induced inflam-
mation and tumor lysis. ES refers to the recruitment of additional 
 
T cells and the development of an immune response to epitopes dis-
tinct from and non-cross-reactive with the primary epitope recognized 
by the original effector T cells39. Recognition of multiple epitopes 
might enhance anti-tumor responses, for example, by promoting addi-
tional help from CD4-mediated T cells; through linked recognition; 
or through direct tumor destruction, if it is a CD8 T cell–activating 
epitope. Linked recognition is a process of CTL priming whereby CD4 
helper cells recognize antigens on the same APC that cross-presents 
the CTL epitope40. ES might result through unknown mechanisms 
during the initiation of T cell responses that target self-antigens (Fig. 3) 
shared by normal tissue, which thereby leads to loss of tolerance and 
autoimmunity. ES has been documented in patients receiving tumor 
vaccines41 and in patients who have undergone adoptive transfer 
 
(Box 1) of CTLs and CAR T cells42,43. Checkpoint therapy with ipili-
mumab can induce ES44, and it is likely that neoantigen-directed 
immune responses against tumors, when followed by ES, can trigger 
autoimmunity against nonmalignant tissues in which the neoantigens 
are absent. Although many efforts are under way to exploit ES using 
several immune and nonimmune (for example, radiation and chemo-
therapy) treatment modalities, in certain circumstances, the conse-
quences of ES might need to be curtailed through the development 
and administration of selective inhibitors of cross-presentation45, 
perhaps by manipulating proteasome activity or regulatory T cell 
function (Fig. 3).
Another mechanism that might influence autoimmune side effects 
is T cell functional flexibility and plasticity. Changes in epigenetic-
control mechanisms may allow for switching between exhausted 
and activated T cell states. In addition, Treg cells can be converted 
into TH17 cells in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-β46,47, which might 
underlie certain forms of autoimmunity, such as autoimmune hepa-
titis and psoriasis48,49, and CXCL11 promotes Treg cell differentia-
tion into CXCR3+CD4+ effector T cells, suggesting that it might be 
involved in the development of autoimmune encephalitis50. Control 
of Treg cell plasticity is further regulated by EZH2, a target for mul-
tiple small-molecule inhibitors in cancer trials51. EZH2 is a histone 
modifier that functions as the catalytic component of the polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2). As a lysine methyltransferase, EZH2 
promotes the addition of the repressive mark histone H3K27me3 to 
target chromatin, which thereby induces chromatin compaction and 
transcriptional repression by restricting access to transcriptional reg-
ulators such as RNA polymerase II and other transcription-associated 
 
factors. Hyperactivation of or mutations in EZH2 are found in a 
variety of malignancies52. However, EZH2 activity in tumor cells can 
shape the immune microenvironment of tumors by controlling the 
expression of chemokines53. Thus, in cancer, small molecules targeting 
proteins that are mutated in tumor cells could have dual effects: they

Figure 2 CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint blockade affects T cells at 
different stages of differentiation and at different anatomical locations.  
In lymphoid tissues, CTLA-4 expression is induced in naive T cells.  
After the TCR is triggered by an antigen–MHC encounter, CTLA-4 is 
expressed on the cell surface. CTLA-4-blocking therapies suppress 
negative signals delivered by CTLA-4, which permits sustained T cell 
activation and proliferation. The major role of the PD-1 pathway is at a 
later stage of T cell activation. In peripheral tissues (including tumors), 
activated T cells upregulate PD-1 expression. Inflammatory signals in 
the tissues induce the expression of PD-1 ligands, which downregulate 
the activity of T cells through binding to PD-1 and CD80, a feedback 
mechanism to limit collateral tissue damage. T cell exhaustion, a state of 
terminal T differentiation, is induced by prolonged exposure to high levels 
of antigen. Anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapies prevent this negative regulation 
and may reinvigorate exhausted T cells or delay T cell exhaustion in 
response to chronic antigen exposure. Alternative new therapies with 
CAR T cells that are highly specific for tumor antigens cause destruction 
directly within the tumor microenvironment.

might directly suppress proliferation or survival of cancer cells, and at 
the same time, they might modulate the anti-tumor immune response 
at the level of Treg cells. Understanding the complex network of tran-
scription factors involved in the regulation of T cell plasticity will be 
crucial to the development of targeted therapies that can effectively 
treat cancer without also introducing autoimmune risk.
Efforts to predict and understand toxicity
Understanding and manipulating the mechanisms and factors that 
determine a patient’s risk of developing immune toxicity during or 
after checkpoint blockade will require basic and preclinical research, 
as well as changes in current clinical-reporting practice. With regard 
to the latter, although existing observations of immune-related toxicity 
are helpful, most literature reporting autoimmune-associated disease 
consists of case reports54,55, in which, for example, autoantibodies are 
often not described. Moreover, frequently, autoantibodies are negative 
when reported and autoimmune disease presents rapidly, as seen with 
diabetic ketoacidosis and T1D; because subsequent longitudinal data 
are often not reported, scientists have generally been unable to assess 
whether autoantibodies, such as GAD-65, ICA-512, and ZnT8, become 
detectable over time. At present, it remains unclear whether the autoim-
mune manifestations seen after immunotherapy are clearly connected 
to the ‘classical’ autoimmune diseases that they symptomatically repre-
sent, because simple correlations with factors such as MHC haplotypes, 
autoantibodies, and antigen-specific T cell identification are mostly 
absent from current analyses. Moreover, organ involvement in an 
autoimmune response is unpredictable from patient to patient, perhaps 
owing to different genetics, epigenetics, or microbiota environment, 
and/or because of polymorphisms in the checkpoints themselves56. 
For example, in terms of genetic associations, CTLA4 polymor-
phisms have been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune diseases 
 
such as T1D, and preclinical models have shown that anti-CTLA-4 
 
can increase the risk of autoimmune diabetes57. In summary, large 
patient databases containing more metadata will be required to deter-
mine whether similar genetic predispositions and biologic pathways 
are shared between classic autoimmune diseases and the autoimmune 
syndromes induced by various cancer immunotherapies.
Patients with a history of or ongoing autoimmune disease are 
currently excluded from clinical trials, but whether this is justified 
remains unclear, given that the underlying mechanisms of immu-
notoxicity from checkpoint inhibition may be distinct and have no 
substantial impact on a patient’s existing autoimmune disease. Crucial 
to clinicians’ understanding of and ability to predict immunotoxicity 
from these drugs will be enhanced pharmacovigilance. The estab-
lishment of a national database to track long-term outcome would 
enable a deeper understanding of irAEs. One effort in this area is an 
initiative by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that used the High-
Performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) to establish a 
database on the safety of engineered T cells. Other efforts, such as 
the Cancer Moonshot launched as part of the 21st Century Cures 
Act, also highlight the need for a more complete understanding of 
the consequences of these new therapies as well as the importance 
of collating large data sets and maintaining robust clinical and basic 
research efforts. Together, these academic, industry, philanthropic, 
and government efforts will help us to shape and take advantage of 
these exciting new therapeutic opportunities.
Some insights into the mechanisms by which cancer immuno-
therapy promulgates autoimmunity might be gained by analysis of 
 
T cell responses in other settings. For instance, CD8+ T cell exhaustion 
is frequently observed in chronic viral infections58. Moreover, PD-1 
blockade seems to reactivate effector T cells through the targeting of 
certain transcriptional factors (i.e., nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-
enhancer of activated B cells, interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2, 
orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1, and B-lymphocyte-induced matura-
tion protein 1) that cause a reengagement of the effector mechanisms 
in the epigenome of exhausted T cells59. CTLA-4 has also been found 
to have a clear role in multiple chronic infections, including HBV, HCV, 
and HIV, and its inhibition can increase the function of pathogen-spe-
cific T cells60,61. Epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms determine 
the functional plasticity of T cells to switch between their exhausted 
and effector states62, and so altering the transcriptional landscape—for 
example, by manipulating transcription-factor and gene-enhancer 
expression—and epigenetic landscape—for example, by manipulat-
ing the activity of histone-modifying methylation or demethylation 
enzymes, histone acetylases, and DNA demethylases—of adoptively 
transferred T cells may yield a more specific anti-tumor response than 
generalized PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. Genomic editing of chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to render them resistant to exhaustion 
has been proposed63,64, and Sen and colleagues suggested that map-
ping state-specific enhancers in exhausted T cells could enable more 
precise genome editing for adoptive T cell therapy62.
Improved clinical reporting and new basic and preclinical research 
is especially important because more and more patients are receiving 
checkpoint-blockade treatment. Indeed, the emerging standard of care 
for patients with many forms of disseminated cancer is therapy with 
a checkpoint antagonist. Moreover, for patients in clinical trials, the 
trend is to combine one or several of the increasing ‘toolbox of thera-
pies,’ including vaccines, CAR T cells, oncolytic viruses, radiation,

autoimmunity. Top, T cells recognizing antigens (for example, neoantigens 
or antigens overexpressed on tumor cells) on tumor cells induce  
cytokine secretion and/or cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. This can  
also result in the death of nontransformed bystander cells. The antigens 
released by all cells in the environment are ingested by APCs  
(for example, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells), which migrate  
to the lymph nodes. Bottom, in the lymph nodes, these activated  
APCs can present tumor antigens as well as antigens from bystander cells, 
thereby priming a second wave of T cells that can re-enter the tissue and 
cause additional tumor destruction and off-target destruction of normal 
tissue. This, in turn, leads to autoimmunity. AutoAbs, autoantibodies.

chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, with a checkpoint blocker65. 
We expect the incidence of inflammatory and autoimmune toxicity to 
increase with the complexity and duration of combination therapies, 
as has been observed with ipilimumab and PD-1 antagonist combi-
nations66. The toxicity that emerges after combination therapy can 
be unexpected, as illustrated when ipilimumab was combined with 
vemurafenib67; in this case, neither agent, when given as a single agent, 
resulted in unacceptable liver toxicity; the combination, however, 
 
elicited severe liver toxicity that resulted in termination of the trial.
Biomarker studies of tumor biopsies have identified tumor and 
immune markers predictive of beneficial anti-tumor responses to 
checkpoint therapy68, including PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and 
CD8+ T cell infiltration of the TME. The occurrence of autoimmune 
skin depigmentation (vitiligo) after immunotherapy with a variety of 
modalities is associated with improved long-term survival69. In addi-
tion, the typical kinetics of the onset of immunotoxicity have been 
described for some therapies, including ipilimumab, in which skin 
conditions are typically seen as the first manifestation, followed by col-
itis, and later, hepatitis and polyendocrinopathies70. As was mentioned 
above, the occurrence of certain immune-mediated paraneoplastic 
syndromes might portend prolonged survival. By contrast, biomarker 
studies are just beginning to identify patients who are at increased 
risk for immunotoxicity71. A recent SNP analysis of high-risk loci 
for T1D in a human case of fulminant T1D treated with combination 
ipilimumab and nivolumab failed to reveal a high-risk genetic profile, 
and so the role of genetic predisposition is unclear with regard to 
identifying those who might develop autoimmunity when treated with 
checkpoint blockade54. More accurate predictions of irAEs require 
the development of better insights into the genetics, epigenetics, and 
environmental elements that control immunity in both animal models 
and humans72. For example, it is not yet clear whether reductions in 
T cell exhaustion as a result of checkpoint inhibition may explain the 
mechanisms of autoimmunity observed in mice and patients, because 
epigenetic transcriptional-control factors and enhancers that deter-
mine the plasticity between exhausted and effector T cells have not as 
yet been compared in different immune settings.
Emerging strategies to limit toxicity
One main rationale for immunotherapy is that it is a ‘living drug;’ 
the adaptive immune response might persist for years, as opposed 
to targeted therapies and chemotherapy, in which the active agent is 
rapidly metabolized. A fundamental question to address is whether 
patients are ‘cured’ after cancer immunotherapy, and if so, is the 
remission a ‘sterile cure’ or the induction of some form of tumor 
dormancy? In mice, tumor dormancy is maintained by adaptive 
immunity as immune equilibrium73. Clinical data suggest that sub-
clinical melanoma may persist for more than a decade after therapy 
in patients who remain in remission74, which points to the existence 
of prolonged tumor dormancy, likely related to cancer stem cells and 
adaptive immunity. Given the development of sensitive assays that can 
determine the absence of residual dormant tumor, it is conceivable 
that methods could be implemented to terminate cancer immuno-
therapy and thereby limit the incidence and severity of autoimmu-
nity. In the case of adoptive cell transfer, various suicide systems 
have been deployed successfully to rapidly and specifically terminate 
 
immunotherapy75. As discussed above, checkpoint blockade may 
spontaneously abate by exhaustion, but methods to terminate ‘at will’ 
by physician control are not presently available, other than through 
the administration of systemic immunosuppression.
The manipulation of immune-cell cytokine effects and/or systemic 
host metabolism also has the potential to modulate immunotoxicity. 
 
For example, cancer immunotherapy with IL-2 and agonistic CD40 
Box 1 Adoptive T cell therapy 
Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered with defined specificity is another ongoing approach to limit autoimmunity while preserving 
anti-tumor efficacy. The TCR must be chosen to target tumor-specific antigens, such as cancer-testis antigens or neoantigens, because 
infusions of T cells with transgenic TCRs that recognize antigens shared by normal tissue induce an unacceptable degree of toxicity92. 
Experiments with a panel of TCRs with varied affinity and targeting self-antigens show that the induction of anti-tumor activity and  
autoimmunity are closely coupled93. Furthermore, autoimmune syndromes might occur following the adoptive transfer of transgenic  
T cells that retain the endogenous TCR94, presumably owing to the formation of heterodimers that create self-reactive specificities.
The adoptive transfer of TCR transgenic T cells and CAR T cells can cause severe immunotoxicity owing to cytokine release upon  
target recognition95,96. Cytokine-release syndrome can be effectively managed with cytokine blockade29. The propensity of adoptive 
transfer to cause autoimmunity seems to be low, although there is not as much experience with adoptive transfer as with checkpoint 
therapy. Consistent with a reduced propensity for autoimmunity, infusions of allogeneic CAR T cells might cause diminished GVHD97–99.
The potential for autoimmunity with adoptive transfer can be abrogated by reducing or eliminating the endogenous TCR. Genome  
editing to create CAR T cells or TCR transgenic T cells devoid of the endogenous TCR in order to prevent GVHD and enhance the  
function of the transgenic TCR has been reported64,100,101.
An increasing number of efforts are taking place to combine therapeutic T cells with checkpoint inhibitors, either as combination thera-
pies or directly, by altering the checkpoint targets (such as PD-1) within the cell through genome-editing technologies. These attempts 
to create checkpoint-resistant T cells are likely to increase both their general efficacy and autoantigen-mediated effects63,64,102. Thus, 
controlling potential off-target effects of CAR and TCR-transduced T cells will depend on choosing an appropriate tumor-specific antigen, 
eliminating the endogenous TCR, engineering CAR T cells reliant on multiple tumor-associated antigens for activation103, and inserting 
suicide genes, such as iCaspase-9 or other regulated receptors75, that allow for quick inactivation in the event of off-target effects.
Finally, future approaches combining synthetic biology with adoptive transfer may solve many problems with immunotoxicity and  
autoimmunity. CAR T cells can be engineered with Boolean logic gates—for example, ON-switch CARs, so that activity of the CAR  
T cell can be rapidly titrated and reversed, allowing, in principle, for a high level of physician-enabled remote control104. AND-gate  
engineered T cells can express two or more receptors of desired specificity to increase tumor killing and discrimination from normal  
tissue. For example, AND-gated chimeric receptors can recognize a target surface antigen but, upon engagement, activate transcription  
and the expression of a second receptor (i.e., CAR or TCR) that mediates cell killing105. Only when both antigens are present does  
sustained T cell priming and activation occur.

antibody is more toxic in aged mice and mice with obesity76. Treatment 
with etanercept to block TNF in young, obese mice receiving the same 
immunotherapy prevented the toxic effects of cytokine storm77.
Many epidemiologic studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency is 
associated with an increased risk of cancer incidence and mortal-
ity78. There is an increased incidence of GVHD in patients who have 
vitamin D deficiency before undergoing allogeneic HSCT79. Both 
macrophages and Treg cells are implicated in the above studies. PD-L1 
expression on dendritic cells (DCs) is required for the induction of 
Treg cells by vitamin D3, perhaps through reverse signaling by PD-L1 
to DCs80. It is possible that the regulation of PD-1–PD-L1 signaling at 
discrete stages during the immune response could diminish immuno-
toxicity in individuals with cancer. Thus, vitamin D3 supplementation 
might reduce the risk of several autoimmune disorders in those who 
are deficient81, but this has yet to be documented in patients because 
the human data available are primarily observational82.
It is possible that manipulation of the microbiome could enhance 
or diminish immunotoxicity. In mice, Vétizou et al.83 found that 
optimal responses to CTLA-4 blockade required the presence of spe-
cific Bacteroides spp. Similarly, it was reported that Bifidobacterium 
spp. enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy84. It is possible 
that interindividual differences in the microbiome account for 
substantial heterogeneity in therapeutic efficacy and the immun-
opathology that is invoked after checkpoint blockade85. Fecal stool 
transplants can ameliorate colitis associated with GVHD86, and it 
is likely that this approach may reduce toxicity from checkpoint- 
blockade therapy.
Targeting tumor-specific antigens, such as cancer-testis antigens, 
and mutation-specific neoantigens are attractive strategies for miti-
gating the risk of autoimmunity. Several approaches are currently 
testing this idea, including vaccines that target neoantigens derived 
from nonsynonymous mutations that occur during cellular transfor-
mation; adoptive transfer with TCR transgenic or CAR T cells; and 
targeted radiotherapy to induce abscopal effects87. The rationale for 
vaccines targeting neoantigens is that the functional avidity of TCRs 
is improved as compared to that of T cells that target shared anti-
gens, because neoantigen-specific T cells are not subjected to thymic- 
tolerance mechanisms, and so off-tumor toxicity should not occur in 
the absence of epitope spreading88. But if epitope spreading were to 
occur, these strategies would also risk inducing autoimmunity.
CONCluSIONS
Given the recent success of immunotherapy, the incidence of immu-
notoxicity will likely continue to rise as these therapies become more 
widely used. For instance, lung cancer, classically thought to be non-
immunogenic, has now shown substantial response to checkpoint 
inhibitors; this suggests that we might only be at the tip of the iceberg 
with regard to their oncologic treatment potential89,90. Furthermore, 
CAR T cells are being tested in a variety of solid-tumor settings, either 
alone or in combination with drugs that alter the TME and inherent 
immune response. Moreover, current use has been limited prima-
rily to patients with advanced or unresectable disease, but use in less 
advanced disease has begun to show promise, and many clinical trials 
are pending. In these settings, the immune system is likely to be more 
intact, given that it has not been exposed to immune-suppressive 
chemotherapies and radiation. It will be important to monitor the 
field for an increasing incidence of immunotoxicity as patients with 
more vigorous and diverse immune systems are exposed to immu-
nomodulation. Finally, the incidence of autoimmunity in the general 
population, particularly in developed nations, has been rising—and 
this begs the question of whether autoimmunity with cancer immu-
notherapy will also increase91.
