Abstract
Background—It has been observed that married cancer patients have lower mortality rates than 
unmarried patients, but data for different racial/ethnic groups are scarce. The authors examined the 
risk of overall mortality associated with marital status across racial/ethnic groups and sex in data 
from the California Cancer Registry.
Methods—California Cancer Registry data for all first primary invasive cancers diagnosed from 
2000 through 2009 for the 10 most common sites of cancer-related death for non-Hispanic whites 
(NHWs), blacks, Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs), and Hispanics were used to estimate 
multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for marital status in relation 
to overall mortality by race/ethnicity and sex. The study cohort included 393,470 male and 
389,697 female cancer patients and 204,007 and 182,600 deaths from all causes, respectively, 
through December 31, 2012.
Results—All-cause mortality was higher in unmarried patients than in married patients, but there 
was significant variation by race/ethnicity. Adjusted HRs (95% CIs) ranged from 1.24 (95% CI, 
1.23-1.26) in NHWs to 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) in APIs among males and from 1.17 (95% CI, 
1.15-1.18) in NHWs to 1.07 (95% CI, 1.04-1.11) in APIs among females. All-cause mortality 
associated with unmarried status compared with married status was higher in US-born API and 
Hispanic men and women relative to their foreign-born counterparts.

 Conclusions—For patients who have the cancers that contribute most to mortality, being 
unmarried is associated with worse overall survival compared with being married, with up to 24% 
higher mortality among NHW males but only 6% higher mortality among foreign-born Hispanic 
and API females. Future research should pursue the identification of factors underlying these 
associations to inform targeted interventions for unmarried cancer patients.

Introduction
Results from several studies have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality among married 
cancer patients compared with their unmarried counterparts. A large meta-analysis and a 
recent population-based study of data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program indicate that never-married, 
divorced/separated, and widowed cancer patients had higher mortality than married patients, 
with relative risks ranging from 1.10 to 1.23.1,2 Being married is also associated with earlier 
cancer stage at diagnosis and receipt of definitive treatment.1,3-7 Proposed reasons for the 
beneficial effects of being married include having stronger social support and social 
networks, resulting in higher psychological well being and help with navigating the health 
care system ; having medical insurance8 ; and economic well being9 as well as improved 
behavioral and psychological function.1-4,7
Despite the considerable literature on marital status and cancer outcome and the well 
recognized racial/ethnic differences in cancer mortality and survival, 10,11 data on whether 
the impact of marriage varies across racial/ethnic groups are lacking. It is noteworthy that, in 
the United States, the proportion of adults who have never been married has risen from 10% 
in 1960 to 23% in 2012 among men and from 8% to 17% among women.12 urthermore, 
wide variations by race/ethnicity exist, with 36% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics, 19% of 
Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs), and 16% of whites reporting never being married in 2012.
To address the lack of data on racial/ethnic differences in the association of marital status 
with mortality among patients with cancer, we assessed the risk of overall mortality 
associated with marital status across race/ethnicity and sex in data from the demographically 
diverse, population-based California Cancer Registry (CCR).
Materials and Methods
Case Selection
Data on all first primary invasive cancers for each patient from the 10 most common sites of 
cancer deaths for each sex were obtained from the CCR, which also comprises 4 NCI SEER 
program regions. For males, the sites were prostate, lung and bronchus (“lung”), colon, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), urinary bladder (“bladder”), liver and intrahepatic bile duct 
(“liver and IBD”), leukemia, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus. Additional sites for females 
included breast; corpus and uterus, not otherwise specified (NOS) (“uterus”); ovary; and

 brain and other nervous system (“brain”). We included cases diagnosed at ages ≥ 18 years 
from 2000 through 2009; and we excluded those diagnosed at autopsy or from death 
certificates (n = 9286) and those with invalid or unknown follow-up time (n = 4347), with 
unknown marital status (n = 36,937), and/or with unknown treatment status (n = 11,087).
CCR data on race, ethnicity, birthplace, and marital status at diagnosis are determined from 
medical records of reporting facilities and are primarily based on self-report. We also 
obtained CCR data on age and year of diagnosis, sex, disease stage at diagnosis, histology, 
primary and secondary sources of payment to the reporting hospital, and first course of 
treatment (surgery, radiation, and systemic hormone agents). Nativity is based on birthplace 
coded to as US or foreign born. Previous research indicates that birthplace is differentially 
missing in the cancer registry data between US and foreign born for Hispanics and 
APIs13,14; thus, we developed and validated a method to impute nativity using patients' 
Social Security numbers for the 23% of Hispanics and the 21% of APIs with missing 
registry birthplace. This imputation method assigns a foreign birthplace to Hispanic patients 
who received their Social Security numbers after age 24 years and to APIs after age 20 
years.15,16 Patient residential address at diagnosis was geocoded and assigned to a census 
block group, then linked to a neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) index that 
incorporated data on education, occupation, employment, household income, poverty, rent 
and house values from the Census 2000 Summary File (for cases diagnosed 2000-2005) and 
from American Community Survey data from 2007 to 2011 (for cases diagnosed 
2006-2009).17,18
Follow-Up and Vital Status
Follow-up for overall mortality was computed as the number of days between the date of 
diagnosis and the first occurrence of the following: date of death, date of last known contact, 
or end date of follow-up (December 31, 2012). We also considered cancer-specific deaths 
based on the underlying causes of death (coded to the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision), and follow-up was censored at the date of death for those who died 
from an underlying cause other than the primary cancer.
Statistical Analysis
Prior analyses of these data19 indicated significant differences in mortality by sex; therefore, 
all analyses presented here were conducted separately for males and females. Consistent 
with a recent review of mortality and marital status indicating that mortality risks did not 
vary across subcategories of unmarried status,20 we conducted analyses using marital status 
coded as married and unmarried (never married, separated, divorced, and widowed). We 
used chi-square tests to compare demographic and clinical characteristics by marital status 
and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard rate ratios9 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)21 for overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality, by 
sex and race/ethnicity. The proportional hazards assumption was tested for marital status and 
for each covariate using correlation tests of time versus scaled Schoenfeld residuals. The 
assumption of proportional hazards was violated for SEER summary stage and age at 
diagnosis. Thus, we computed stage-stratified and age-stratified Cox regression models, 
which allowed the baseline hazards to vary by both disease stage and age at diagnosis. The

 models were adjusted for cancer site, surgery, radiation, systemic hormone agents, nSES, 
and sources of medical payment. We modeled the top 10 cancer sites combined for each sex 
as well as each cancer site separately. Models that included all of the cancer sites combined 
excluded cases with leukemia, because stage and surgery were not applicable. We also 
conducted separate analyses by nativity among His-panics and APIs and for the 6 largest 
API ethnic groups: Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, South Asian, and Vietnamese. 
Greater than 40% of Hispanics had Spanish origin coded as “Hispanic, NOS,” so we did not 
analyze data for specific Hispanic origin. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical tests were 2-sided with an a value .05. We 
did not obtain informed consent from the patients, because we analyzed deidentified cancer 
registry data.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population
Among the 393,470 male patients included in our analyses, 204,007 deaths were observed 
during a total of 1,801,907 person-years of follow-up; and, among the 389,697 female 
patients, 182,600 deaths were observed during 1,903,874 person-years of follow-up. The 
proportion of unmarried males at the time of diagnosis was 46% for blacks, 29.8% for 
Hispanics, 29.7% for NHWs, and 19.1% for APIs; the corresponding proportions of 
unmarried females were 68%, 47.3%, 49.4%, and 37.8%, respectively. Table 1 indicates that 
unmarried males were more likely to live in lower SES neighborhoods, have public 
insurance, present with distant-stage disease, and receive less surgery and radiation than 
married males overall and within racial/ethnic groups. Among Hispanic and API males, 
there was a higher proportion of US-born than foreign-born unmarried patients than married 
patients. Similar to males, differences in socioeconomic factors, stage distribution, and 
treatment were observed for married compared with unmarried females overall and by race/
ethnicity (Table 2). Unlike males, however, unmarried and married Hispanic and API 
females were similar in their distribution of nativity.
Marital Status and All-Cause Mortality by Race/Ethnicity and Nativity
Among males, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in unmarried patients compared 
with married patients (Table 3). However, the magnitude of the association varied across 
racial/ethnic groups (P < 6.2 × 10−9), with the largest adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) observed 
in NHWs (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.23-1.26) and the smallest observed in APIs (HR, 1.11; 95% 
CI, 1.07-1.15). The association was significantly stronger in US-born versus foreign-born 
API males (P = .0024), whereas no significant difference by nativity was observed for 
Hispanic males. The association of marital status with all-cause mortality for females also 
varied across racial/ethnic groups (P < .0001) and was highest in NHWs (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 
1.15-1.18) and lowest in APIs (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11). The HR for marital status and 
all-cause mortality was significantly higher in US-born versus foreign-born Hispanic women 
and in API men and women. For all racial/ethnic groups except APIs, the risk of all-cause 
mortality associated with marital status was statistically significantly lower in females than it 
was in males (based on nonoverlapping CIs). Given the appreciable attenuation that occurred 
between the crude and adjusted HRs, we built a series of nested models to assess which

 factors or set of factors contributed to the attenuation in the HRs for each racial/ethnic and 
sex group. These data indicated that, regardless of the racial/ethnic or sex group, attenuation 
was greatest with the inclusion of age and disease stage at diagnosis and cancer site and was 
less marked when we included nSES, insurance, or treatment (data not shown). For both 
sexes, although the CIs became quite broad for some racial/ethnic groups, we observed 
similar patterns of relative risk estimates for each of the 10 common cancers by racial/ethnic 
group (Supporting Figure 1; see online Supporting Information). Results for cancer-specific 
mortality were similar to those observed for all-cause mortality (data not shown). 
Furthermore, when patients with unknown marital status were included in models, the HR 
for unmarried status did not change (data not shown).
Associations Among Api Ethnic Groups
Next, we assessed the association between marital status and all-cause mortality by API 
ethnic subgroup (Table 4). Among males, the association was strongest for Japanese 
(adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31) and was lowest and imprecise for Vietnamese. 
Among females, Koreans had the highest risk of overall mortality associated with being 
unmarried (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44), whereas no association was observed for 
South Asian or Japanese women.
Discussion
Studies of cancer patients in various settings have reported beneficial effects of marriage on 
cancer-specific and overall mortality,1-4 but data are lacking on differences by race/ethnicity. 
Our results indicate that unmarried patients experience a higher risk of all-cause mortality 
than married patients, with significant variation across racial/ethnic groups. We also 
observed stronger associations for US-born versus foreign-born Hispanic and API patients. 
Our results further support the well recognized heterogeneity within the aggregated API race 
group,22 demonstrating variation in the association of marital status and all-cause mortality 
within API ethnic subgroups for both sexes. Although the adjusted HRs are generally 
modest, it is important to note that the proportion of unmarried individuals is high, ranging 
from 19.1% for API males to 68% for black females. Thus, the public health implications 
are not trivial given these percentages of unmarried patients as well as the rising rates of 
never married individuals in the United States.12
Differences in the association of marital status with mortality by race/ethnicity and nativity 
may be attributable to differences in the relative contributions of the hypothesized marital 
status pathways, including social support and help with navigating the health care system,2 
economic well being,9 and medical insurance coverage,8 among others. The results from our 
analyses demonstrate that only a modest attenuation of HRs resulted from the inclusion of 
insurance coverage and nSES in the multivariate models. Larger attenuation occurred with 
the inclusion of age and disease stage in the models.
In the context of cancer survival, various levels of acculturation and English language 
proficiency also are likely important factors influencing the associations we observed. We 
observed that the association between marital status and overall mortality was stronger in

 US-born versus foreign-born APIs and Hispanics, although the HR was imprecise for 
Hispanic males. These results suggest that factors responsible for the adverse effects of not 
being married tend to have a greater effect on overall mortality as immigrant groups 
acculturate to the United States. It is plausible that social support outside of marriage 
diminishes as individuals acculturate to the United States. Conceptually, acculturation and 
English language proficiency should be factors relevant among foreign born but less so 
among US born, suggesting that there are different contributing factors in the marital status-
survival association between US-born and foreign-born patients. Further research to identify 
factors underlying these associations would help to inform interventions targeted toward 
ensuring that unmarried cancer patients have the same opportunity for survival after cancer 
diagnosis as their married counterparts.
The strengths of this study include racial/ethnic diversity and a large and representative 
study population. However, limitations to our data also must be considered. Cancer registry-
recorded race, ethnicity, and birthplace may be subject to some misclassification; although, 
because this information is usually based on self-report (extracted from patient medical 
records),23 it is generally accurate for most racial/ethnic groups.13,14,24-26 However, because 
registry birthplace data are incomplete in a biased manner, we used a validated approach to 
impute nativity. Although marital status was assessed at the time of diagnosis, we lack data 
on changes in marital status after cancer diagnosis and on cohabitation without marriage, 
which may differ by race/ethnicity. In addition, information is not available on 
comorbidities, specific treatment modalities, and other factors that are potential mediators or 
con-founders in the marital status relationship with survival (ie, psychological and cultural 
factors, social networks and support, health behaviors, etc). Consequently, our study does 
not provide specific information regarding why patients from different racial/ethnic groups 
who are not married at the time of diagnosis have lower survival than married individuals, 
although it provides patterns of association that can be further evaluated in future studies. 
There is the possibility of self-selection, as reported in the literature, whereby individuals 
who are physically, emotionally, or psychologically healthier and/or of higher SES may be 
more likely to marry than those who are not.20,21,27
Conclusions
Not being married at the time of cancer diagnosis was associated with higher mortality 
compared with being married, but the association varied by race/ethnicity, sex, and nativity, 
with up to 24% higher mortality among NHW males but only 6% higher mortality among 
foreign-born Hispanic and API females. Given the rising proportion of unmarried 
individuals in the United States and the variation by race/ethnicity,12 the contribution of 
marital status to the overall burden of cancer mortality will likely continue to rise. Future 
research should focus on identifying the factors underlying these associations to inform 
targeted interventions for unmarried cancer patients.

aAdjusted HRs were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models stratified by stage (localized, regional, distant, unknown) and age at diagnosis (in years) and were adjusted for: cancer site (prostate, 
lung, colon, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bladder, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus), race/ethnicity (NHW, black, Hispanic, API, other/unknown for the all races model only), 
first course of treatment (yes or no for surgery, radiation, hormone therapy), insurance status (no insurance, private insurance only, Medicare only/Medicare and private insurance, any public/Medicaid/
military insurance, unknown), and neighborhood socioeconomic status (quintiles). The analysis excluded 15,538 leukemia cases in males.
bThe likelihood ratio test for interaction was computed based on cross-product terms.
cModels for females include sites in the breast, lung, colon, uterus, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, brain, and liver and intrahepatic bile duct. The analysis excluded 11,250 leukemia cases in 
females.
