ABSTRACT
Objectives: Social prescribing is a way of linking
patients in primary care with sources of support within
the community to help improve their health and well-
being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely
promoted and adopted in the UK National Health
Service and so we conducted a systematic review to
assess the evidence for their effectiveness.
Setting/data sources: Nine databases were searched
from 2000 to January 2016 for studies conducted in
the UK. Relevant reports and guidelines, websites and
reference lists of retrieved articles were scanned to
identify additional studies. All the searches were
restricted to English language only.
Participants: Systematic reviews and any published
evaluation of programmes where patient referral was
made from a primary care setting to a link worker or
facilitator of social prescribing were eligible for
inclusion. Risk of bias for included studies was
undertaken independently by two reviewers and a
narrative synthesis was performed.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
Primary outcomes of interest were any measures of
health and well-being and/or usage of health services.
Results: We included a total of 15 evaluations of
social prescribing programmes. Most were small scale
and limited by poor design and reporting. All were
rated as a having a high risk of bias. Common design
issues included a lack of comparative controls, short
follow-up durations, a lack of standardised and
validated measuring tools, missing data and a failure to
consider potential confounding factors. Despite clear
methodological shortcomings, most evaluations
presented positive conclusions.
Conclusions: Social prescribing is being widely
advocated and implemented but current evidence fails
to provide sufficient detail to judge either success or
value for money. If social prescribing is to realise its
potential, future evaluations must be comparative by
design and consider when, by whom, for whom, how
well and at what cost.

BACKGROUND
With estimates of a £30 billion funding gap
by 2020, a radical rethink of the way health
services are currently delivered remains high
on the policy agenda. The Five Year Forward
View has stressed that developing innovative
approaches to delivering healthcare are inte-
gral to the long-term future of the National
Health Service (NHS).1
Social prescribing is one such model and is
being widely promoted as a way of making
general
practice
(GP)
more
sustainable.
Social prescribing is a way of linking patients
in primary care with sources of support
within the community. It provides GPs with a
non-medical referral option that can operate
alongside
existing
treatments
to
improve
health and well-being. There is no widely
agreed definition of social prescribing but
the Social Prescribing Network defines it as
‘enabling healthcare professionals to refer
patients to a link worker, to co-design a non-
clinical social prescription to improve their
health and wellbeing.’2 Schemes commonly
use services provided by the voluntary and
community sector and can include an exten-
sive
range
of
practical
information
and
advice, community activity, physical activities,
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ Social prescribing is a way of linking patients in
primary care with sources of support within the
community. It is being widely promoted and
adopted as means of dealing with some of the
pressures on general practice.
▪ This systematic review assesses the effectiveness
of social prescribing programmes relevant to the
UK National Health Service setting. We have
searched for full publications and grey literature
since 2000 and identified 15 evaluations. It is
possible that some local evaluations have not
been identified, but it is unlikely that any uniden-
tified evaluations would do little to alter the
overall picture of a low-quality evidence base
with a high risk of bias.
▪ If social prescribing is to realise its potential,
future
evaluations
must
be
comparative
by
design and consider when, for whom, how well
and at what cost.

 befriending and enabling services. The types of activities
offered as part of a social prescribing service can aim to
help address the psychological problems and low levels
of well-being often manifest in frequent attenders in GP
.
By addressing these, it is often hoped that there will be a
subsequent positive impact on frequency of attendance.3
As early as 1999, the white paper Saving Lives: Our
Healthier Nation was advocating that the NHS should
make better use of community support structures and
voluntary organisations.4 However, it was in 2006 that
the Department of Health advocated the introduction of
social prescriptions for those with long-term conditions,5
and NHS England has since announced the appoint-
ment of a national clinical champion for social prescrib-
ing.6 With the current Secretary of State for Health also
promoting access to non-clinical interventions that take
a more ‘holistic view’,1 7 support for social prescribing is
significant at the policy level.
Many localities are now offering or considering imple-
menting social prescribing programmes, but is the appar-
ent enthusiasm justified? As part of a study which aimed
to help NHS commissioners make better use of research
in their decision-making,8 we examined the evidence for
social prescribing. This systematic review summarises the
evidence for the effectiveness of social prescribing pro-
grammes relevant to the UK NHS setting.
METHODS
The
protocol
and
amendments
were
registered
in
PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42015023501).
Data sources and searches
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE),
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and NHS
Economic
Evaluation
Database
(NHS
EED)
were
searched for relevant systematic reviews and economic
evaluations (24 June 2015; no new records added to
DARE and NHS EED databases from January 2015 so we
did not run updated searches).
We searched the following databases (initial search 26
June 2015; updated search 5 February 2016): Applied
Social
Sciences
Index
and
Abstracts
(ASSIA),
Cumulative
Index
to
Nursing
and
Allied
Health
Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, Social Care Online
and Social Policy and Practice.
As our focus was on identifying evidence relevant to
the UK NHS setting, we also searched for eligible studies
in key UK knowledge repositories for health and social
care. The websites of National Institute for Health and
Care
Excellence
(NICE),
Social
Care
Institute
for
Excellence (SCIE) and NHS Evidence were searched for
reviews,
guidance,
evidence
briefings
or any other
papers describing or evaluating social prescribing pro-
grammes. Additional searches of the websites of key
policy think tanks the Kings Fund, Health Foundation,
Nuffield Trust and NESTA were also undertaken. We
searched Google to identify grey literature reports of
relevant evaluations in UK settings (5 January 2016).
Reference lists of retrieved articles were scanned to iden-
tify additional studies.
All the searches were restricted to English language
only and published between 2000 to January 2016. The
search strategies are available in online supplementary
appendix 1.
Study selection
Systematic reviews and any published evaluation of pro-
grammes where healthcare professionals refer patients
from a primary care setting to a link worker or facilitator
for any form of social prescription were eligible for
inclusion. Studies were eligible regardless of whether a
comparison group was included.
As per the Social Prescribing Network definition, we
included only studies where referral was made from a
primary care setting to a coordinator, link worker or
facilitator of social prescribing (this type of role will be
referred to as ‘link workers’ throughout this review).
Any activities or interventions being specifically deliv-
ered as part of a social prescribing programme were
included in the review.
We excluded studies where referral was made from
outside of a primary care setting9 and or where primary
care health professionals refer patients to services deliv-
ered as part of mental health or counselling services
such as an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
programme. We also excluded evaluations of activities
that could be socially prescribed (eg, physical activity
programmes or community arts projects) but did not
involve referral to a link worker in the first instance.10–13
The primary outcomes of interest were any measures
of health and well-being, including self-reported mea-
sures (eg, levels of physical activity or depression scores)
and/or measure of usage of health services. We also con-
sidered any other outcomes (eg, health service usage)
reported in the included evaluations.
Study selection was performed by one researcher and
checked by a second, with any discrepancies resolved by
discussion or with recourse to a third researcher.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Details of the setting, participants, the intervention
(type, delivery mode and length of time), type of evalu-
ation and outcomes of evaluation were extracted and
quality assessed by one researcher and checked by a
second. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by
recourse to a third researcher.
We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the
quality of the randomised controlled trial (RCT).14 To
assess the quality of the before and after evaluations, we
applied the quality assessment tool developed by the US
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for before–
after (pre–post) studies with no control group.15 Our
primary focus was on effects. As per our protocol, we
have not made a formal quality assessment of studies of
a qualitative or descriptive nature.

 Data synthesis and analysis
We performed a narrative synthesis of the evidence.
There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis
for any of the outcomes of interest. No subgroup ana-
lyses were planned. The narrative synthesis was intended
to move beyond a preliminary summary of study findings
and quality to investigate similarities and differences
between studies as well as exploring any patterns in the
data.
RESULTS
We identified a total of 431 records through database
searching and a further 14 records through other
sources. After deduplication, 341 titles and abstracts
were screened and 70 full-text papers were assessed for
inclusion (see figure 1: Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow
diagram).
Excluded studies
We excluded 45 studies on eligibility grounds and were
unable to access the full text for seven identified
records. We also identified two non-systematic reviews of
social prescribing schemes.16 17 These were excluded as
they did not critically appraise included studies and were
limited
in
their
synthesis
of
findings;
one
review
included a number of evaluations that did not meet our
inclusion criteria.17 We checked the reference lists of
both reviews to ensure we had identified and included
all relevant evaluations.
Included studies
We included a total of 15 evaluations (reported in 16
papers) of social prescribing programmes where some
form of link worker role was used.3 18–32 The designs
included one RCT,18 one non-RCT,19 two qualitative
studies,23
28
four
uncontrolled
before
and
after
studies3 20–22 and eight descriptive reports of six evalua-
tions, of which, five included some analysis of qualitative
data.24–27 29–32 Details of the included evaluations are
presented in table 1.
In each of the included studies, the link worker ( job
title variously named) met with the patient to discuss
their needs and directed them to appropriate commu-
nity/voluntary sector sources of support in their locality.
The training and knowledge of people fulfilling these
types of link worker role varied between projects. In
some services this was a paid role, in others these roles
were fulfilled by volunteers. Some link workers had good
knowledge and existing networks with local services in
place28–30 and in others they received some basic train-
ing and made use of a directory of resources.22
Patients were referred to a range of activities provided
by local or national voluntary and community sector
organisations. Interventions received included exercise
and other physical activities, signposting to housing,

The number of referrals made to social prescribing
programmes ranged from 30–1607. Referrals were made
by a range of health professionals but primarily GPs.
Three of the studies reported that feedback was given to
the referrer about the actions taken and the partici-
pants’
progress
in
the
social
prescribing
programme.22 28 30
Quality of the evidence
Quality assessment and risk of bias for the evaluative
designs is presented in table 2. In the RCT, only
sequence generation was adjudged to be of low risk of
bias; all other criteria were rated as unclear or high
risk.18 The authors reported that the randomisation
process was misunderstood in two of the participating
practices but random allocation appeared to be main-
tained. A key inclusion criterion for the Cochrane
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review
Group is that a controlled before and after study must
have at least two interventions and two control groups to
guard
against
confounding.33
Here,
the
controlled
before and after study includes one intervention and
one control group, drawn from the same GP
. As such,
we rated the study as having a high risk of bias and
made
no
further
assessment
of
quality
with
the
Cochrane risk of bias tool. Uncontrolled before and
after studies are inherently weak evaluative designs and
no included study fulfilled all of the specified quality cri-
teria. In general, evaluations had small sample sizes
(<100 participants), significant loss to follow-up (>20%),
were lacking in completeness of outcome data and had
unclear selection criteria for the study population.
Follow-up periods were generally short (immediately
post intervention, up to 4 months post intervention).
There is therefore a high risk of bias.
Uptake and attendance
Seven included studies reported the number of people
attending an initial appointment with a link worker.
Where reported, attendance at this initial appointment
with a link worker ranged from 50% to 79%.18 21–23 25–27
Participants’ attendance at activities to which they were
subsequently referred or recommended by a link worker
was reported in only two studies and varied from 58%22
to 100%.21
Health and well-being outcomes
The
RCT,18
two
uncontrolled
before
and
after
studies21 22 and three descriptive reports26 27 32 mea-
sured health and well-being outcomes at baseline and
again at up to 6 months after referral to a social pre-
scribing programme; one study reported outcomes at
up to 12 months. The measures used were Warwick-
Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS;21 26 32),
Hospital
Anxiety
and
Depression
Scale
(HADS;18),
General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7;27), Patient Health
Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9;27),
Clinical
Outcomes
in
Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM;22),
Work
and
Social
Adjustment
Scale
(WSAS;21
22),
General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12;22) and COOP/
WONCA.18 Table 3 presents findings for studies using
validated measures; all report some improvements in
health and well-being. However, it is difficult to quantify
the size of the observed improvements due to a lack of
reported detail, a lack of sufficient control group data
and differences in reporting between studies. It is not
possible to determine whether any observed improve-
ments were clinically significant. Studies reported short-
term outcomes only; there is no evidence about the
effect social prescribing has on health and well-being
outcomes beyond 6 months.
One uncontrolled before and after study used a bespoke
measure,
the
Wellspring
Well-being
Questionnaire,
comprising PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tools, and items from
Office of National Statistics (ONS’s) Well-being Index/
Integrated Household Survey and International Physical
Activity Questionnaires.3 A second also used a bespoke
measure which used a 5-point scale across eight domains
associated with different aspects of self-management such
as ‘looking after yourself’ and ‘managing symptoms’.20
Two further descriptive reports also indicated they used
the WEMWBS to measure changes in health and well-
being but are poor reported and involve what appear to be
very small numbers of respondents.24 25 In the two studies
using non-validated measures, some positive improve-
ments in outcomes such as depression and anxiety at 3–
4 months’ follow-up were reported.3 20
Healthcare usage outcomes
Both comparative evaluations18
19 and three uncon-
trolled before and after studies3 20 22 reported some
measure of healthcare usage. This included comparing
hospital episode statistics and/or GP record data from 6
to 12 months before intervention with data up to
18 months
post
intervention.
Reported
outcomes
included frequency of GP consultations, referrals to sec-
ondary care, inpatient admissions and accident and
emergency (A&E) attendances. Findings were mixed.
The RCT reported that the number of primary care con-
tacts were similar between intervention and control
groups and that there were fewer referrals to secondary
care and more prescription drugs for those in the inter-
vention group compared with the control group.18 The
non-randomised
trial
reported
statistically
non-
significant
reductions
in
primary
care
contacts
(face-to-face and/or telephone) and referrals to second-
ary care.19 The before and after studies reported reduc-
tions in secondary care referrals, inpatient admissions
and A&E attendances20 in primary care contact22 and in
face-to-face GP contact but an increase in telephone
contact.3

32 reported on patient experience.
Studies used semistructured interviews or survey ques-
tionnaires specifically designed for the project evalu-
ation to assess participant experience.
In six of the studies, participants reported overall satis-
faction with social prescribing programmes.20–22 26 28 30
General improvements in feelings of loneliness and
social isolation,21 30 32 and improved mental and phys-
ical health were also observed.21 Issues that may impact
the willingness of patients to participate in socially pre-
scribed activities included confidence,21 30 interest in/
appropriateness of activities on offer21 30 and literacy or
travel issues.30
32 One qualitative study reported that
patients had poor knowledge of the service prior to
attending their appointment with the link worker result-
ing in some feeling that the service did not meet their
expectations.23 Another evaluation identified a similar
issue regarding a lack of understanding of the service
among participants.32
Referrer experience and lessons learnt
A small number of studies conducted semistructured
interviews with primary care practitioners referring parti-
cipants to social prescribing programmes and/or link
workers.21 26 28–32 GPs in general found that being able
to make a social prescription was a useful additional
tool.21 28 29 31 Key issues identified for successful imple-
mentation of social prescribing programmes were central
coordination of referrals,26 resources and training to
support coordinators and enabling networking with the
voluntary and community sector,26 29 and good communi-
cation between GPs, participants and link workers: social
prescribing is unfamiliar to many GPs and requires good
clear explanation to engage participants;21 23 26 32 deliver-
ing feedback on participants’ progress encourages GP
support for social prescribing.28 30 31
Costs
The two comparative evaluations reported costs. One
found total mean costs were greater in the intervention
group
(£153)
compared
with
the
control
group
(£133).18 The other reported no statistically significant
differences between the financial and environmental
costs of healthcare use between the intervention and
control groups.19
One before and after study undertook a cost-benefit
analysis using estimated input costs and benefits derived
from 12-month outcome data obtained for 108 patients
referred to social prescribing (42 of whom were referred
to funded voluntary and community service providers).
A total NHS cost reduction of £552 189 was generated
by multiplying the estimated per-patient cost reduction
by the total number of referrals (n=1118) to funded vol-
untary and community service providers over the 2-year
course of the pilot programme. This estimate was com-
pared with total estimated input costs of £1.1 million.20

DISCUSSION
This systematic review has examined the evidence to
inform
the
commissioning
of
social
prescribing
schemes. Overall, we identified 15 evaluations con-
ducted in UK settings but have found little convincing
evidence for either effectiveness or value for money.
Most of the evaluations of social prescribing activity
are small scale and limited by poor design and report-
ing. Missing information has made it difficult to assess
who received what, for what duration, with what effect
and at what cost. Common design weaknesses include a
lack of comparators (increasing the risk of bias), loss to
follow-up, short follow-up durations and a lack of stan-
dardised and validated measuring tools. There is also a
distinct failure to either consider and/or adjust for
potential confounding factors, undermining the ability
to attribute any reported positive outcomes to the inter-
vention (or indeed interventions) received. This is par-
ticularly important as most referred patients appear to
have been receiving other interventions and so we have
no way of assessing the relative contributions of the
interventions to the outcomes reported. Despite these
methodological shortcomings, most evaluations have
presented positive conclusions, generating a momentum
for social prescribing that does not appear to be
warranted.
Strengths and limitations
Our systematic review appears to be the first to assess the
effectiveness of social prescribing programmes relevant
to the UK NHS setting. We have searched for full publi-
cations and grey literature since 2000 but it is possible
that we have not identified some local evaluations.
Publication bias occurs when the results of published
studies are systematically different from results of unpub-
lished studies. However, we think it unlikely that any
unidentified evaluations will be more robust than those
included in the review.
Many of the evaluations presenting positive conclu-
sions were written as descriptive reports with limited or
no supporting data presented. As such, they did not
adhere to formal reporting standards that would be
expected in reports to funding agencies or in academic
journal articles. This made extracting any relevant data
difficult and it is possible information relevant to out-
comes is missed. Even if this shortcoming of data com-
pleteness were to be addressed, we believe that it would
do little to alter the overall picture of a low-quality evi-
dence base with a high risk of bias.
Implications
Our systematic review has not established that there is
clear evidence that social prescribing is ineffective.
Rather, we are not yet able to reliably judge which, if
any,
social
prescribing
programmes
demonstrate
a
degree of promise and so could be considered further.
The use of a link worker is the key feature of social pre-
scribing. How this link worker role was fulfilled varied
significantly between projects. So here again, we are not
able to reliably judge the type of skills set or level of
training and knowledge people require to effectively
fulfil this role. For those seeking to commission new or
extend existing schemes, this evidence gap is a hin-
drance rather than a help, especially so given the wide-
spread support and advocacy for social prescribing at
the policy level.
While the tension between rigour and ‘good enough’
evidence
has
long
been
recognised,34
even
‘good
enough’ is severely lacking from the social prescribing
literature be that in the design or in the conduct of the
evaluations themselves. This may in part reflect the way
schemes have ‘emerged’ rather than being systematically
planned
with
evaluation
built
in
from
the
outset.
Nevertheless, if social prescribing is to realise its poten-
tial, then there is an urgent need to improve the ways by
which schemes are evaluated.
Prospective
pathways
for
undertaking
rigorous
planned experimental evaluation are well defined,35 but
the opportunity, time and resources needed to employ
these in a service context can be limited. However, this
does not serve as an excuse for inaction and in the
current financial climate we should of course only be
investing in those services where we can demonstrate
real benefit over existing ways of working. What this
should mean for future evaluation of social prescribing
is that a more coordinated approach to the planning,
implementation and evaluation of new and existing
schemes is undertaken. This could and should involve
the adoption of a common analytical framework which
in turn will facilitate standardised metrics, cross-site com-
parison and shared learning. The IDEAL framework
offers one such pathway to navigate the evaluation con-
tinuum that would allow for the iterative development
and evaluation of whether social prescribing is likely to
succeed in a particular setting and allow for adaptation,
refinement and system integration without losing sight
of the need for more rigorous testing before wider
spread.36 Whatever analytical framework is adopted,
Lamont and colleagues37 have proposed five essential
questions for evaluation which those planning to under-
take evaluations of social prescribing programmes would
do well to heed. These are:
▸ Why—clarify aims and establish what we already
know from evidence.
▸ Who—identify and engage stakeholders and likely
users of research at outset.
▸ How—think about study design, using an appropri-
ate mix of methods, and adjust for bias where pos-
sible (or at least acknowledge).
▸ What—consider what to measure (activity, costs and
outcomes)
and
combine
data
from
different
sources.

 ▸ When—pay attention to timing of results to maxi-

Alongside these, we would also emphasise that rigor-
ous conduct and transparent reporting (regardless of
‘success’ or ‘failure’) are essential. Reporting guidelines
such as Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting
Excellence (SQUIRE)38 with its focus on explaining
‘Why did you start?’, ‘What did you do?’, ‘What did you
find?’ and ‘What does it mean?’ could readily be applied
to ensure that learning is systematically captured in a
generalisable format. This in turn would serve to ensure
that any future decisions relating to the continuation or
wider spread of social prescribing schemes are transpar-
ent and evidence informed.
CONCLUSIONS
Social prescribing is being widely advocated and imple-
mented but current evidence fails to provide sufficient
detail to judge either success or value for money. If
social prescribing is to realise its potential, future evalua-
tions must be comparative by design and consider when,
by whom, for whom, how well and at what cost.
