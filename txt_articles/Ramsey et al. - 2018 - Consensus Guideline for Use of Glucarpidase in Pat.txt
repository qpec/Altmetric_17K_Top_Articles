ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury due to high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is
a serious, life-threatening toxicity that can occur in pediatric
and adult patients. Glucarpidase is a treatment approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for high methotrexate
concentrations in the context of kidney dysfunction, but the
guidelines for when to use it are unclear. An expert panel was
convened to provide specific, expert consensus guidelines for
the use of glucarpidase in patients who develop HDMTX-
induced nephrotoxicity and delayed methotrexate excretion.
The guideline provides recommendations to identify the popu-
lation of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase rescue
by more precisely defining the absolute methotrexate concen-
trations associated with risk for severe or life-threatening
toxicity at several time points after the start of an HDMTX infu-
sion. For an HDMTX infusion �24 hours, if the 36-hour concen-
tration is above 30 mM, 42-hour concentration is above 10 mM,
or 48-hour concentration is above 5 mM and the serum creati-
nine is significantly elevated relative to the baseline measure-
ment (indicative of HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury),
glucarpidase may be indicated. After a 36- to 42-hour HDMTX
infusion, glucarpidase may be indicated when the 48-hour
methotrexate concentration is above 5 mM. Administration of
glucarpidase should optimally occur within 48–60 hours from
the start of the HDMTX infusion, because life-threatening
toxicities may not be preventable beyond this time point. The

Implications for Practice: Glucarpidase is a rarely used medication that is less effective when given after more than 60 hours of
exposure to high-dose methotrexate, so predicting early which patients will need it is imperative. There are no currently available
consensus guidelines for the use of this medication. The indication on the label does not give specific methotrexate concentrations
above which it should be used. An international group of experts was convened to develop a consensus guideline that was specific
and evidence-based to identify the population of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase.
INTRODUCTION
Nephrotoxicity induced by high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is
a medical emergency because the renal excretion of metho-
trexate (MTX) is subsequently delayed, and the resulting
prolonged exposure to high concentrations of the drug can
cause severe and life-threatening toxicity.The recombinant bac-
terial enzyme glucarpidase, which is approved by the Food and

 Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with delayed
MTX excretion, is a rescue agent that cleaves MTX into inactive
metabolites, providing an alternative route of elimination for
the drug in patients with nephrotoxicity [1–6]. A task force was
assembled to develop specific, evidence-based guidelines for
the use of glucarpidase in patients who develop HDMTX-
induced nephrotoxicity and delayed MTX excretion, and the
recommendations of this working group are reported herein.
HIGH-DOSE METHOTREXATE PHARMACOLOGY
Methotrexate is an antifolate that can be administered over a
broad dose range (from 20 to 33,600 mg/m2) [7] but is only
tolerable at higher doses when followed by the rescue agent
leucovorin (5-formyltetrahydrofolate). HDMTX is commonly
regarded as doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 infused over 2–36
hours, requiring supportive care (e.g., hyperhydration) and
leucovorin rescue. Doses and infusion times vary by indication
(Table 1).
MTX is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR; Fig. 1) and blocks the conversion of dihydro-
folate to its active, chemically reduced tetrahydrofolate form,
thus depleting the intracellular pool of tetrahydrofolates, which
are required cofactors (single-carbon donors) for the synthesis
of methionine, thymidine, and purines. MTX is polyglutamated
intracellularly, and in this form (MTXPG) can also directly
inhibit enzymes in the purine/pyrimidine synthetic pathways.
Thymidylate synthase is the only folate-requiring enzyme that
oxidizes its tetrahydrofolate cofactor to dihydrofolate, and
active synthesis of thymidine is necessary for MTX to deplete
intracellular tetrahydrofolates.
The anticancer and toxic effects of MTX are highly
schedule-dependent and are determined by the duration of
exposure to a threshold concentration of the drug. The thresh-
old concentration is tissue- and tumor-specific. Prolonged con-
tinuous exposure to low concentrations of MTX can cause
severe myelosuppression and other severe toxicities. Leucovo-
rin, the HDMTX rescue agent, provides an alternative source of
tetrahydrofolate and counteracts MTX toxicity if administered,
preferably within 42 hours of the start of the HDMTX infusion.
Leucovorin must compete with MTX for cell entry and polyglu-
tamation (Fig. 1), so it is less effective as a rescue agent at high
MTX concentrations if it is not also present at an equipotent
concentration.
Renal excretion of the parent drug is the primary route of
elimination
for
HDMTX,
accounting
for
approximately
70%–90% of MTX clearance [8]. MTX is a weak acid with limited
solubility in acidic conditions (2 mM maximum solubility at pH
5). Alkalinization of the urine has a greater impact on MTX solu-
bility in urine than fluid hydration [9]. MTX solubility increases
10-fold by increasing the pH from 6 to 7 [10]. MTX is secreted
and not reabsorbed by renal tubules, but tubular secretion is
saturated at higher plasma concentrations and only plays a
minor role in MTX elimination during and immediately after
the HDMTX infusion [11]. MTX is 60% protein-bound, and glo-
merular filtration is limited to free drug. Therefore, MTX clear-
ance at high concentrations is less than the glomerular
filtration rate (GFR). MTX is also metabolized in the liver by
aldehyde oxidase to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, which accounts
for 5%–10% of MTX elimination [8].There is substantial interpa-
tient and intrapatient variability in the clearance of MTX, which
ranges 10-fold (depending on dose, age, and infusion time) in
patients with normal renal function after an HDMTX infusion
[12–15].
HDMTX-INDUCED ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY AND
DELAYED MTX CLEARANCE
HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs during or
shortly after the end of the infusion near the end of the steady-
state plasma concentration (Fig. 2) [16]. The AKI is manifested
as a rise in serum creatinine (decrease in GFR), but urine output
is usually maintained (nonoliguric) [17]. MTX clearance declines
in proportion to the decrease in GFR, resulting in prolonged
exposure to high MTX concentrations that may exceed the
capacity of standard doses of leucovorin to rescue from the tox-
icity of MTX. HDMTX-induced AKI that is associated with sub-
stantial reductions in MTX clearance occurs in 0.5%–1.0% of
courses of 5 g/m2 over 24 hours in children with acute lympho-
blastic leukemia (ALL) [18, 19] and 1.8% of courses of 12 g/m2
over 4 hours in children, adolescents, and young adults with
osteosarcoma [20]. Approximately 2%–12% of adults treated
with HDMTX develop nephrotoxicity [21]. HDMTX-induced AKI
is reversible, and nearly all patients fully recover renal function.
The GFR of most patients with HDMTX-induced AKI returns to
baseline values after AKI, although this can take weeks [22, 23].
The long-term consequences of HDMTX-induced AKI have not
been fully investigated, but it is possible that nephron loss
occurs after such injury, resulting in subsequent chronic kidney
disease, as has been shown in other models of AKI [24].
Possible mechanisms of HDMTX-induced AKI include pH-
dependent precipitation of MTX in urine in the renal tubules
[25–27], reduced renal perfusion from afferent arteriolar
vasoconstriction, or uptake of MTX into the renal tubules with
direct tubular toxicity [5, 9, 16]. The osteosarcoma HDMTX
regimen (8–12 g/m2 over 4 hours), which has a higher
incidence of HDMTX-induced AKI, as noted above, yields an
end-of-infusion plasma MTX concentration of approximately
1,000 mM (1 mM) [15, 28, 29], and the simultaneous urine MTX
concentration is approximately 10,000 mM (10 mM) [8], which

 approximates the solubility limit of MTX at pH 7. The timing of
HDMTX-induced AKI and the effectiveness of alkalinization
and volume expansion (fluid hydration) administered prior to,
during, and after a HDMTX infusion at preventing HDMTX-
induced AKI supports the view that MTX precipitation plays a
role in this toxicity.
Documenting normal renal function prior to administering
HDMTX and serial monitoring of serum creatinine before and
at the end of HDMTX infusion are mandatory to detect
HDMTX-induced AKI as early as possible. An increase in serum
creatinine of more than 50% within 24–36 hours from the
pre-HDMTX baseline value has a sensitivity of 0.32 and a spec-
ificity of 0.99 for predicting delayed MTX elimination [16].
However, serum creatinine is a suboptimal biomarker of AKI,
as creatinine rise may lag significantly from the time of the
renal insult. Elevated plasma MTX concentration may indicate
HDMTX-induced AKI prior to a significant change in creatinine.
Thus, clinicians administering HDMTX should be familiar with
the expected plasma MTX concentration at the various time
points after infusion (supplemental online Tables 1 and 2).
After recovery of renal function (normal GFR), HDMTX therapy
can generally be safely administered at full dose in pediatric
and adult patients who previously experienced HDMTX-
induced AKI or received glucarpidase [18, 19, 30].
STRATEGIES TO PREVENT HDMTX-INDUCED AKI
In early studies of HDMTX, severe toxicity occurred in approxi-
mately 10% of patients with a 6% toxic mortality rate [31]. The
incidence of severe, life-threatening toxicity after HDMTX ther-
apy has been reduced to less than 1% by the implementation
of supportive care measures to prevent HDMTX-induced AKI,
Figure 1. The cellular entry of MTX is mediated primarily by the
ubiquitously expressed RFC, encoded by the human solute carrier
family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) gene on chromosome 21. Other
influx and efflux mechanisms include ABC transporters (specifically
ABCC1–4) and breast cancer resistance protein [79], but their role
in MTX clearance and efficacy is less well documented. Passive
diffusion plays a significant role during high-dose MTX (HDMTX)
therapy. Most of the MTX that enters the liver re-enters the blood
circulation by enterohepatic circulation via the ABCC transporters,
and only a small portion is excreted into the bile. MTX interferes with
the natural folate-homocysteine cycle and inhibits folate-dependent
enzymes and pathways, including DHFR, TYMS, 5,10-methylene-
tetrahydrofolate reductase, and purine de novo synthesis. This leads
to a lack of reduced folate, inhibition of DNA synthesis, increased
homocysteine and adenosine concentrations, and potentially life-
threatening toxicities [32, 80, 81]. Leucovorin (folinic acid) is essential
for cellular rescue after HDMTX, and insufficient intracellular concen-
trations of leucovorin after HDMTX may cause life-threatening toxic-
ities. Intracellularly, the enzyme FPGS polyglutamates MTX by adding
2–6 glutamate residues, creating MTXPG, which increases intracellu-
lar retention as well as affinity for its target enzymes proportional to
glutamyl chain lengths [82–86].

 including alkalinization of urine, fluid hydration with frequent
monitoring of serum creatinine, and serial monitoring of
plasma MTX concentrations to determine the dose and dura-
tion of leucovorin rescue [19, 32–34]. Urine pH should be docu-
mented to be above 7 prior to the start of a HDMTX infusion
and should be maintained at this level until the plasma MTX
concentration drops below the solubility threshold. Urinary
flow prior to, during, and after a HDMTX infusion should be
maintained at least at 2,500 mL/m2 per day (supplemental
online Table 3) [35]. If urinary flow drops below 2,000 mL/m2
per day, there is a higher risk for delayed MTX clearance [36].
The purpose of alkalinization of the urine and fluid hydra-
tion is to maximize the solubility of MTX in urine. These meas-
ures do not enhance MTX clearance, which is largely
dependent on glomerular filtration at high plasma MTX con-
centrations. Once the plasma MTX concentration drops below
10 mM after infusion, the urine concentration is estimated to
be an order of magnitude below the drug’s solubility limit at
pH 6; thus, alkalinization and hydration are less important as
the plasma MTX concentration continues to decrease to the
target level (typically �0.1 or 0.2 mM) at which leucovorin
rescue can be stopped in patients with normal renal function.
LEUCOVORIN RESCUE
Leucovorin and its primary circulating metabolite, 5-methyl-
tetrahydrofolate, prevent the potentially severe and life-
threatening toxicities from HDMTX by providing a source of
intracellular tetrahydrofolates that enter the folate cycle down-
stream of DHFR, which is inhibited by MTX. However, these
exogenous tetrahydrofolates must compete with MTX for cellu-
lar uptake via the reduced folate carrier and, once in the cell,
for polyglutamylation, which enhances intracellular retention
of folates and affinity for the target enzymes (Fig. 1).Therefore,
leucovorin rescue is less effective at high MTX concentrations,
especially when the MTX concentration exceeds 10 mM for 48
hours or longer. The leucovorin dose must be increased in
proportion to the MTX concentration when MTX clearance is
delayed due to HDMTX-induced AKI.
Timing of MTX measurements and the dose and initiation
of leucovorin rescue vary across different treatment regimens
(Table 1) [9]. Leucovorin rescue usually starts 24–42 hours after
the start of the HDMTX infusion and must not be delayed
beyond 42–48 hours, even if the HDMTX infusion does not fin-
ish at the planned time. Delaying the start of leucovorin rescue
beyond 48 hours after the start of the HDMTX infusion signifi-
cantly increases the risk for severe MTX toxicity [37]. Standard
doses of leucovorin can be administered orally, but higher
doses used when the MTX concentration is elevated must be
administered intravenously because the absorption of leucovo-
rin and other folates from the intestinal tract is carrier-mediated
and saturable at doses above 40 mg.
GLUCARPIDASE BACKGROUND
Glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase G2 or Voraxaze, BTG plc, Lon-
don, UK, www.btgplc.com) is a recombinant bacterial enzyme
that inactivates MTX and folates by hydrolyzing the glutamate
moiety (Fig. 3). Carboxypeptidase G1 (CPG1) was isolated from
Pseudomonas stutzeri in the 1970s. Studies in mice and in a
small number of patients revealed that administration of CPG1
after MTX dosing prevented subsequent toxicity [38]; however,
the bacterial source was subsequently lost [39]. In the 1980s,
carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) was isolated and purified from the
Pseudomonas strain RS-16 and cloned into Escherichia coli [40,
41]. Glucarpidase rapidly lowers the MTX concentration by
cleaving MTX into two noncytotoxic metabolites, 4-deoxy-4-
amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) and glutamate, which
are eliminated primarily by the liver (through the bile) and not
by the kidney [4, 42].
Glucarpidase is provided as a lyophilized powder in vials
containing 1,000 units and is administered in a single intrave-
nous dose of 50 units/kg. Dose-finding studies of glucarpidase
were not conducted in humans, but this recommended dose
has been shown to be safe and effective [43]. Glucarpidase
may not be routinely stocked in pharmacies because of its high
cost and infrequent use, so the drug should be ordered as soon
as the need for its use is anticipated (https://www.btgplc.com/
products/specialty-pharmaceuticals/voraxaze-glucarpidase/).
Adverse reactions related to glucarpidase, including nausea/
vomiting, hypotension, paresthesia, flushing, and headache
(mostly grade �2, according to the NCI Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3), were recorded each in
less than 3% of patients [6]. Despite the potential immunoge-
nicity related to the bacterial source of glucarpidase, hypersen-
sitivity reactions were reported in <1% of patients, but 17% of
patients receiving one or two doses of glucarpidase developed
antiglucarpidase antibodies [6, 18, 44, 45].
GLUCARPIDASE PHARMACOLOGY
The pharmacokinetics of glucarpidase, which is an 83 kDa pro-
tein, were studied in the absence of MTX in eight healthy volun-
teers and in four subjects with severe renal dysfunction [46].The
molecular weight exceeds the threshold for glomerular filtration,
so renal excretion is not likely to play a role in drug elimination.
In normal volunteers, the clearance was 7.5 mL/min; the volume
of distribution was 3.6 L, which is comparable to plasma volume;
and the half-life was 6 or 9 hours (depending on the drug assay
method) and was not substantially different in patients with
renal dysfunction [43]. Due to the large molecular size of glucar-
pidase, it does not enter cells or cross the blood-brain barrier.

 Because of the limited distribution volume of glucarpidase,
metabolism of tissue and intracellular MTX is reliant on diffusion
of the drug back into circulation. Glucarpidase cannot directly
rescue the intracellular effects of MTXPG, although it can limit
further kidney damage.Thus, leucovorin is still required after glu-
carpidase to protect normal cells from MTX toxicity [47].
Glucarpidase rapidly metabolizes circulating MTX and
reduces plasma MTX concentrations by >95% within 15
minutes of administration [18, 42, 45]. This catalytic effect on
circulating MTX persists for 48 hours, but there can be a
rebound of plasma MTX concentration as the activity of glucar-
pidase wanes and MTX redistributes to circulation from tissues
[21] (Fig. 4). However, the rebound plasma MTX concentration
is typically substantially lower than the preglucarpidase MTX
level [23]. Glucarpidase has a higher affinity for MTX (Km 8 mM)
than for leucovorin (Km 120 mM) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(Km 35 mM), but in vivo the AUC0–3h of 5-MeTHF drops by
>90% after administration of glucarpidase [40, 41].
Intravenously administered glucarpidase mediates rapid
degradation of MTX and, as such, may have a role in limiting
further nephrotoxicity; however, by itself, glucarpidase does
not impact the normalization of kidney dysfunction [23]. Suc-
cessful intrathecal administration of glucarpidase has been
reported in a limited number of patients who experienced an
accidental intrathecal MTX overdose [44, 48]; in contrast, in
this emergency scenario, intrathecal administration of leucovo-
rin should strictly be avoided [49].
INDICATIONS FOR GLUCARPIDASE THERAPY
Treatment with glucarpidase is indicated for patients with
HDMTX-induced AKI and delayed MTX elimination leading to
potentially toxic plasma MTX concentrations. The FDA has
approved a dose of 50 units/kg for the treatment of toxic
plasma methotrexate concentrations (>1 micromole per liter)
in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to
impaired renal function. But the limitations of use indicate that
it should not be used in patients who exhibit the expected
clearance of methotrexate (plasma methotrexate concentra-
tions within two standard deviations of the mean methotrexate
excretion curve specific for the dose of methotrexate adminis-
tered) or those with normal or mildly impaired renal function
because of the potential risk of subtherapeutic exposure to
MTX [6].
The goal of this task force was to identify the population of
patients who would benefit from glucarpidase rescue by more
precisely defining the absolute MTX concentrations that put
patients at risk for severe or life-threatening toxicity at specific
time points after the start of the HDMTX infusion based on
reported experience with HDMTX infusions. The duration of
time above the threshold MTX concentration for various tissues
was considered when determining the concentration cutoffs at
each time point. We provide guidance for many of the time
points that are routinely monitored in clinical practice (Fig. 5).
Consulting with an experienced oncologist, nephrologist, or
clinical pharmacist who is familiar with managing patients
treated with HDMTX infusions is recommended if the patient
has prior HDMTX-induced AKI or a GFR <75 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Administration of glucarpidase should optimally occur within
48–60 hours from the start of the HDMTX infusion, because
life-threatening toxicities may not be preventable beyond this
time point.
1–8 g/m2 MTX Infused over 24–42 Hours
For a 24-hour infusion, a plasma MTX concentration >120 mM
(54.5 mg/mL) at the end of the infusion or a creatinine increase
�50% over baseline warrants additional monitoring at 36
hours. If the 36-hour MTX concentration is above 30 mM (13.6
mg/mL), the 42-hour MTX concentration is above 10 mM (4.54
mg/mL), or the 48-hour concentration is above 5 mM (2.27 mg/
mL) and the serum creatinine is elevated relative to the base-
line measurement (indicative of HDMTX-induced AKI), glucarpi-
dase may be indicated. After a 36–42 hour HDMTX infusion,
administration of glucarpidase may be indicated when the
48-hour MTX concentration is above 5 mM.
8–12 g/m2 MTX Infused over �6 Hours
A plasma MTX concentration >1500 mM (681 mg/mL) at the
end of the infusion warrants additional monitoring at 24 hours.
If the 24-hour concentration is above 50 mM (22.7 mg/mL), the
36-hour concentration is above 30 mM (13.6 mg/mL), the
42-hour MTX concentration is above 10 mM (4.54 mg/mL), or
the 48-hour concentration is above 5 mM (2.27 mg/mL) and
the serum creatinine is elevated relative to the baseline
measurement (indicative of HDMTX-induced AKI), administra-
tion of glucarpidase may be indicated.
There is a potential for falsely elevated plasma MTX concen-
tration during or shortly after the end of the HDMTX infusion
due to contamination if the specimen is drawn from the same
lumen of the central venous catheter through which the drug
was infused. If the plasma MTX concentration is elevated, but

tion (mM) 3 body weight (kg). If glucarpidase is administered
within 2 hours of the last dose of leucovorin, it will cleave the
leucovorin as well as the MTX. Leucovorin should not be
administered until 2 hours after a dose of glucarpidase because
it may interfere with glucarpidase-mediated metabolism of
MTX.
Leucovorin and MTX are racemic mixtures of two stereoiso-
mers, and only the levo (L) enantiomer is recognized by most

 folate carriers and enzymes that utilize folates as a cofactor or
are inhibited by MTX or MTXPG. The active levo enantiomer of
leucovorin (levoleucovorin calcium) is FDA-approved for use as
a MTX rescue agent. Glucarpidase cleavage of MTX and tetrahy-
drofolates is less stereo-specific because the cleavage site does
not involve the chiral carbon. Glucarpidase should be adminis-
tered according to the package insert. If less than the full dose
of 50 units/kg is all that is available, any amount that is avail-
able should be given, as lower doses may be effective [22]. Leu-
covorin rescue should be reinitiated no sooner than 2 hours
after glucarpidase administration. Repeat administration of glu-
carpidase within 48 hours of the first dose during the same
MTX course is not recommended due to decreased efficacy.
MEASUREMENT OF MTX AFTER GLUCARPIDASE THERAPY
Most clinical laboratories measure plasma MTX with an immu-
noassay method and not by a more specific high pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) method [50]. Immunoassay methods
detect MTX and its metabolites DAMPA and, to a varying
extent, 7-hydroxymethotrexate. After glucarpidase administra-
tion, essentially all circulating MTX is converted into the non-
toxic metabolite DAMPA and other metabolites [4] (Fig. 3), but
an immunoassay method that does not distinguish between
MTX and DAMPA overestimates the true MTX concentration.
With an HPLC method that chromatographically separates MTX
from DAMPA, the plasma MTX concentration usually drops by
>95% by 15 minutes after glucarpidase.The half-life of DAMPA
is approximately 9–10 hours, resulting in immunoassay interfer-
ence and an inability to accurately quantify the MTX concentra-
tion for approximately 48 hours after glucarpidase. This
limitation of the MTX immunoassay methods after glucarpidase
therapy should be recognized and communicated between clin-
ical and laboratory personnel. Another factor to consider is the
potential rebound of MTX concentrations more than 48 hours
after glucarpidase administration (Fig. 4) due to release of MTX
from tissue stores; therefore, continued monitoring of MTX
concentrations and administration of leucovorin is very impor-
tant in these patients [23, 42, 51, 52].
GUIDELINES FOR LEUCOVORIN USE AFTER GLUCARPIDASE
THERAPY
Due to the large quantities of calcium, the infusion time of leu-
covorin at doses >200–500 mg (or the patient’s body surface
area (BSA) 3 50) should be over 1–2 hours. To avoid excessive
calcium concentrations, leucovorin can be substituted with cal-
cium levofolinate or disodium levofolinate, which contain the
active L-form of leucovorin, allowing the dose of leucovorin to
be reduced by 50% compared with the racemic form. Disodium
levofolinate can be given as a bolus dose and thus gives a faster
clinical effect. Treatment with leucovorin should be continued
until the plasma MTX concentration is below the threshold pre-
scribed by the treatment protocol (e.g., below 0.1–0.2 mM).
The minimal single dose of leucovorin is 15 mg/m2 per dose.
The minimal single dose of calcium or disodium levofolinate is
7.5 mg/m2 per dose.
Leucovorin rescue should be restarted 2 hours after the
administration of glucarpidase at the dose based on the MTX
level prior to glucarpidase therapy. Because most institutions
do not use an HPLC assay to specifically quantify MTX levels
after glucarpidase administration, leucovorin rescue will be
based on the MTX plasma concentration measured with the
clinical immunoassay method, which measures MTX and its
metabolites. Leucovorin should be administered for at least 48
hours after glucarpidase because of the MTX reentering the
bloodstream from the tissues (Fig. 4).

 DISCUSSION
Alternatives to Glucarpidase Therapy
There are scant data to directly compare the efficacy of glucar-
pidase with other modalities of lowering MTX plasma concen-
trations
[53],
including
intermittent
and
continuous
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, and
increasing elimination via enterohepatic circulation using
enteral binding agents like oral cholestyramine. Hemodialysis
and hemodiafiltration can clear MTX that is free in the plasma.
Given the relatively high volume of distribution and protein
binding of MTX, a rebound of free MTX occurs when dialysis is
stopped [54–56]. In situations in which glucarpidase is not avail-
able, when patients have very high MTX concentrations, the
risks of hemodialysis and/or high dose continuous veno-venous
hemodiafiltration are low compared with the potential benefit
of providing enhanced MTX clearance. Thymidine, which coun-
teracts the effects of MTX through the restoration of DNA syn-
thesis, did show promising results in clinical trials in a small
number of patients but has been discontinued and is unavail-
able for investigational use [5].
High-dose leucovorin rescue has over the years been used
for delayed MTX clearance when CPG1 and CPG2 were not eas-
ily available [57]. It is still the best option when glucarpidase is
not available within 60 hours from the start of the HDMTX infu-
sion. However, unnecessarily high doses of leucovorin should
be avoided, as treatment failures in association with higher leu-
covorin doses or “over-rescue” have been reported in pediatric
patients with ALL and osteosarcoma [58, 59]. Leucovorin is a
storage vitamin, and excessive rescue could thus interfere with
the MTX efficacy at the next HDMTX course [60]. Therefore,
glucarpidase has increasingly come to the fore in the manage-
ment and prevention of HDMTX-induced AKI.
Effect of Age on MTX-Induced Nephrotoxicity
Adults generally do not tolerate HDMTX as well as children,
and MTX pharmacokinetic parameters are dependent on age
[12, 61, 62]. The available pharmacokinetic data in adults are
not as abundant as in children. One protocol reduces the MTX
dose based on the GFR in elderly patients with central nervous
system lymphoma, which resulted in similar toxicities com-
pared with patients with normal renal function [63]. However,
in most contemporary adult ALL protocols, there is no dose
reduction. In a retrospective analysis including 649 HDMTX
treatment cycles in 194 adult patients, advanced age was signif-
icantly associated with delayed MTX elimination and grade 2–4
renal toxicity [64]. In addition, elderly cancer patients are more
likely to have some degree of baseline renal dysfunction that
can be exacerbated by MTX [65]. Of 749 patients aged 1–45
years old treated by the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematol-
ogy and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2008 protocol, the 61 adult
standard- or intermediate-risk patients who received 8 courses
of HDMTX each and the 31 high-risk patients who received 6
courses demonstrated similar toxicities to the children treated
on the same protocol [19].
Concomitant Medications
As MTX-induced nephrotoxicity is closely tied to MTX clearance,
reducing the risk of AKI from other nephrotoxic medications is
imperative. Each potential nephrotoxic medication should be
carefully evaluated, and the risk and benefits of stopping this
medication should be individualized. Studies in pediatrics have
clearly shown that the AKI can nearly be prevented with judi-
cious use of nephrotoxic medications [66]. In addition,
increased exposure to 7-hydroxymethotrexate has been
reported in association with pantoprazole [67]. Concomitant
use of medications that can interfere with MTX elimination,
such as proton pump inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, should be avoided [5, 68–75]. Even food
(e.g., licorice [76]) and beverages (soft drinks, often sweetened
with licorice extract) with low pH have been suspected to affect
the MTX clearance. Since the introduction of 5-hydroxytrypta-
mine (5HT3) receptor antagonists, emesis is not a problem dur-
ing HDMTX and nowadays unlikely to be linked to AKI.
Trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole is generally used as Pneu-
mocystis jiroveci prophylaxis during ALL therapy [77], and there
has been a worry that it could interfere with MTX pharmacoki-
netics and/or efficacy. However, it does not seem to interfere
with HDMTX pharmacokinetics [78].
FURTHER RESEARCH NECESSARY
Given the paucity of published pharmacokinetic data in adults,
it is difficult to determine whether the present recommenda-
tions, which are primarily based on pediatric experiences,
adequately apply to adult patients. Thus, pharmacokinetic
data in adult patients should be prospectively collected and
analyzed and include patients with HDMTX-induced AKI and
patients receiving glucarpidase treatment. These data are
being collected in adults in Denmark (personal communica-
tion with Nina Toft, Adult NOPHO ALL-2008 coordinator).
Additional studies on the effect of comedications on HDMTX
pharmacokinetics are also needed, because existing data are
based mostly on single case reports.
CONCLUSION
The expert panel was able to come to consensus, providing
specific MTX concentrations above which glucarpidase is
strongly recommended. Implementation of the recommenda-
tions in this guideline may help reduce the incidence of life-
threatening HDMTX-induced toxicities.
