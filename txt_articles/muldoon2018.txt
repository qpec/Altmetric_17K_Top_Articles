background Achieving just outcomes in sexual assault 
cases is one of the most serious and complex problems 
facing the healthcare and justice systems. This study was 
designed to determine the prevalence and correlates 
of Sexual Assault Evidence Kit (SAEK) completion and 
release to police among sexual assault cases presenting 
to the ED.
Methods Data for this retrospective study come from 
the Sexual Assault and Partner Abuse Care Programme 
(SAPACP) case registry (1 January to 31 December, 2015) 
at The Ottawa Hospital, a unique medical-forensic access 
point and the only facility offering SAEK collection in 
Ottawa. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression 
models were conducted using ORs, adjusted ORs (AORs) 
and 95% CIs.
results In 2015, 406 patients were seen by the 
SAPACP and 202 (77.1%) were eligible for a SAEK. 
Among eligible cases, 129 (63.9%) completed a 
SAEK and 60 (29.7%) released the SAEK to police for 
investigation. Youth cases (≤24 years) had the highest 
odds of completing a SAEK (AOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.18 to 
4.23). Cases who were uncertain of the assailant (AOR 
3.62, 95% CI 1.23 to 10.67) and assaults that occurred 
outdoors (AOR 3.14, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.09) were most 
likely to release the SAEK to police.
Conclusion Even with access to specialised forensic 
evidence collection, many sexual assault survivors do not 
complete a SAEK, and even fewer release the evidence 
to police for investigation. The ED is a common entry 
points into the healthcare system, and this study has 
highlighted the need to strengthen services and reduce 
attrition along the health-justice continuum.
InTrOduCTIOn
Achieving just outcomes in sexual assault cases is 
one of the most serious and complex problems 
facing the emergency healthcare and justice systems. 
Unlike most accidental or unintentional injuries, 
sexual assault survivors are regularly subjected to 
victim blaming and stigmatisation when seeking 
health services.1 2 As a result, many sexual assault 
survivors never access care and their injuries go 
undocumented and untreated. Among the frac-
tion of survivors who do seek medical care, the ED 
is one of the most common entry points into the 
healthcare system.1 3 4 It is primarily the respon-
sibility of the ED to provide medical and forensic 
evidence collection that is submitted to police for 
legal investigation.
Specialised 
sexual 
assault 
and 
domestic 
violence programmes in EDs are best practices for 
comprehensive patient care, ED flow and collec-
tion of forensic evidence.5 Sexual Assault Nurse 
Examiners (SANE) programmes have been specif-
ically designed to support survivors by offering 
both forensic evidence collection and specialised 
clinical care.6 7 SANEs are primarily responsible 
for administering the Sexual Assault Examination 
Kit (SAEK).8 9 The SAEK, also termed the ‘rape 
kit’, collects forensic evidence from bodily fluids 
(eg, semen, blood, saliva), finger nail scrapings 
or samples from clothing that can be analysed 
for DNA.10 Toxicology screening may also be 
conducted when there is an indication of drug-fa-
cilitated sexual assault (DFSA) associated with loss 
of consciousness, memory loss, sedation, confusion 
or impaired speech.11 Completing a SAEK can be 
an invasive and potentially psychologically retrau-
matising event,12 and ensuring that the SAEK is 
collected carefully and correctly is critical for use 
in trial. Low-quality or insufficient medical and 
forensic evidence has been found to be a common 
barrier to prosecuting sexual assault cases.13
Key messages
What is already known on this subject
 
► Out of every 1000 sexual assault cases, only 
33 are reported to police, 6 lead to prosecution 
and 3 lead to conviction.
 
► Forensic evidence collection is a critical 
component of the legal prosecution of 
perpetrators of sexual assault, yet many 
barriers exist to accessing care and completing 
a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit (SAEK).
 
► Little is known about the completion and 
release of forensic evidence among hospital-
based sexual assault cases, especially in 
Canada.
What this study adds
 
► Two-thirds of sexual assault cases seen in the 
ED completed a SAEK and less than one-third 
released the kit to police.
 
► Youth cases (56.0%) and drug-facilitated sexual 
assaults were very common (54.5%) and both 
factors that increased the odds of completing 
a SAEK.
 
► Sexual assault cases where the patient was 
uncertain of the identity of the assailant 
(18.32%) were more likely to release the 
SAEK to police, highlighting the challenges of 
memory loss during sexual assault

Original article
Survivors of sexual violence face tremendous barriers when 
interfacing with the justice system. A review of attrition studies 
in five countries (Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Scot-
land and the USA) conducted between 1990 and 2005, found 
that only 14% of all sexual assault victims chose to enter into 
the criminal justice process by reporting to police.14 In Canada 
specifically, it was estimated that out of every 1000 sexual assault 
cases, only 33 are reported to police, 6 lead to prosecution and 
3 lead to conviction.15 Other studies have identified the wide-
spread problem of untested SAEKs. It has been estimated that 
between 41% and 62% of SAEKs collected at the hospital and 
submitted to police are not submitted for DNA testing.16 A 
current gap in the literature is knowledge on the proportion of 
kits that are completed in hospitals but never released to police. 
This highlights an interventionable hospital-based attrition point 
that EDs can evaluate.
It is imperative that all patients that present at EDs receive 
the best possible care; however, research to date has shown that 
sexual assault survivors continue to face substantial care barriers 
that limit their ability to seek justice. Currently, there is very little 
research surrounding patterns of forensic evidence collection in 
EDs among survivors of sexual assault, especially in Canada. The 
objectives of these analyses were to: 1) determine the volume of 
sexual assault cases presenting to EDs and 2) establish the prev-
alence and correlates of SAEK completion and release to police 
among sexual assault survivors.
MeThOds
setting
The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) is a large multicentre tertiary care 
facility with a population catchment of 980 
000 people. The 
Sexual Assault and Partner Abuse Care Programme (SAPACP) 
located in the ED at TOH, is the only facility in Ottawa that 
performs forensic evidence collection. It is a multidisciplinary 
team of specialised health professionals, physicians, nurse prac-
titioners, SANEs and social workers, who provide private, safe 
and confidential trauma services (24/7) to any person 16 years 
of age and older who has experienced sexual or partner-based 
violence.
design
This study is a retrospective analysis of SAPACP patient charts 
to determine the number of sexual assault cases that present at 
the SAPACP
, the prevalence of SAEK completion, and the prev-
alence of SAEK release to police. Cases were included in this 
analysis if the patients were aged 16 years and older, and eligible 
for SAEK collection (ie, presenting 12 days following a vaginal/
penile assault, 7 days following a digital-vaginal assault, 3 days 
following a penile/digital anal assault and 24 
hours following a 
penile-oral assault). Patients who presented exclusively for an 
assault that did not involve sexual violence were excluded.
Data were extracted from the SAPACP Case Registry 
(1 January to 31 December, 2015). This database combines 
standardised discrete fields from the hospital electronic health 
records and detailed clinic charting within the SAPACP
. Clinic 
notes include discrete fields, text fields and diagrams for injury 
documentation. A medical student research assistant (AD) was 
carefully trained to review all charts and extract clinical and 
assault-related data from the SAPACP patient charts. For data 
quality assurance, 10% of the patient charts were randomly 
selected and double-checked by the Medical Director (KS) and 
the SANE (TL). The inter-rater reliability was strong, and the 
kappa statistic was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.97).
Measures
The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients 
that completed a SAEK. The secondary outcome of interest was 
the number of patients that subsequently released the SAEK to 
police.
Key demographic factors included sex/gender and age. The 
majority of sexual assault cases occur among female patients; 
however, there are a growing number of trans people and male 
patients presenting for sexual assault. Due to small cell sizes, 
male and trans cases were grouped together and compared with 
female cases. Age was measured both continuously and categor-
ically to identify youth cases. We used the WHO standardised 
indicator and defined youth as anyone between the ages of 
15 and 24 years. As SAPACP patients must be 16 years and older, 
the youth variable was categorised as 16–24 years.
Key admissions information included method of arrival (ambu-
lance vs walk-in) and arrival within 24 
hours from the time of 
assault. Injury severity was assessed through the Canadian Triage 
Acuity Score (CTAS), a 5-point score assigned at admission 
to enable EDs to prioritise patients according to the type and 
severity of presenting signs and symptoms.17 A derived variable 
was used to compare level 1 and 2 cases (resuscitation/emergent) 
to level 3, 4 and 5 cases (urgent/semi-urgent/non-urgent).
Assault-related information included concurrent physical or 
verbal assaults. DFSA was either self-reported by the patient 
or detected through toxicology. DFSA included both ‘proactive 
DFSA’, where someone is either covertly or with force adminis-
tered a disinhibiting substance for the purposes of sexual assault 
(eg, date rape drug), or ‘opportunistic DFSA’, where a perpe-
trator engages in sexual activity with a person who is intoxicated 
and incapable of providing informed consent.18 Assailant infor-
mation included known assailant (yes/no/uncertain) and multiple 
assailants (yes/no/uncertain). Injury information included stran-
gulation during the assault (yes vs no), use of a weapon (yes 
vs no) and loss of consciousness (yes vs no). A series of binary 
variables were used to record geographic location of assault, 
including the patients home, assailants home, friends home, 
outdoors or in a dorm.
Cases were reviewed to see if there was police involvement 
(ie, arriving at the hospital with police accompaniment or cases 
involving police investigation). Additional forensic information 
included photo documentation or forensic photography. This is 
only indicated with detectable or visual injuries including cuts, 
bruises, swelling, lacerations and abrasions. All legal interven-
tions involve the patient’s explicit consent.
Information on hospital-based services included pelvic exams, 
urine samples, blood samples and testing for sexually transmitted 
infections. Emergency contraceptives were offered to eligible 
patients (ie, presenting 5 days following forced or unprotected 
vaginal intercourse) and the frequency of uptake was recorded. 
HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) eligibility and uptake was 
recorded.
statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, 
V
.9.3.19 Descriptive statistics included totals and percentages for 
categorical variables, and median and IQR for continuous vari-
ables. Fisher's exact test and Χ2 test were used to detect statistical 
differences between the independent and outcome variables.
Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were 
run to investigate factors associated with completing a SAEK. 
Among the subsample of cases that completed a SAEK, a 
secondary analysis was conducted to identify factors associated

with releasing the SAEK to police. Estimates included ORs and 
95% CIs for bivariable logistic regression modelling. Multivari-
able analyses included variables that were statistically significant 
at the bivariable level and presented with adjusted OR (AORs) 
and 95% 
CIs.
resulTs
In 2015, 406 patients were seen by the SAPACP
. There were 262 
(64.5%) sexual assault cases, and 202 (77.1%) were eligible for a 
SAEK. Out of the 202 eligible sexual assault cases, 129 (63.86%) 
completed a SAEK and 60 (29.70%) subsequently released the 
SAEK to police for investigation.
Patient characteristics are presented in table 1. The majority 
(91.6%) of sexual assault cases seen were among female patients. 
The median age was 24.1 (IQR 20.3–32.4), with 113 (55.9%) 
youth cases. There were 33 (16.3%) patients who arrived by 
ambulance and 144 (71.3%) cases who arrived within 24 
hours 
of the assault. Over half of the sample (53.5%) had experienced 
a DFSA, 110 (54.5%) were assaulted by a known assailant and 16 
(7.9%) assaults involved multiple assailants. The most common 
location of the sexual assault was at the assailants’ home (28.7%) 
and patients' home (23.3%). There were 10 (5.0%) cases that 
occurred in university or college dorm rooms.
At the bivariable level (table 2), the factors most strongly asso-
ciated with completing a SAEK included youth cases (OR 2.83, 
95% 
CI 1.57 to 5.12), those presenting within 24 
hours (OR 1.86, 
95% 
CI 1.00 to 3.46) and DFSAs (OR 2.01, 95% 
CI 1.12 to 
3.59). Cases with concurrent physical assault (OR 0.35, 95% 
CI 
0.14 to 0.86) had significantly lower odds of completing a SAEK. 
Of note, almost all sexual assaults occurring in dorms completed 
a SAEK (9/10); however, due to small cell sizes the presented 
estimates should be interpreted with caution. In the final multi-
variable model, youth cases (AOR 2.23, 95% 
CI 1.18 to 4.23) 
had the highest odds of completing a SAEK. Those presenting 
within 24 
hours had marginally higher odds of completing a 
SAEK (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.40).
Among the subsample of 129 cases that completed a SAEK 
(table 3), the odds of releasing the kit to police were highest 
among patients uncertain of the assailant (OR 4.07, 95% 
CI 1.41 
to 11.77) and assaults that occurred outdoors (OR 3.50, 
95% 
CI 1.26 to 9.71). Of note, almost all cases admitted via 
ambulance also released the SAEK to police (15/17); however, the 
cell sizes are small, and the presented estimates should be inter-
preted with caution. In the final multivariable model, patients 
uncertain of the assailant (AOR 3.62, 95% 
CI 1.23 to 10.67) 
and assaults that occurred outdoors (AOR 3.14, 95% 
CI 1.08 to 
9.09) were the cases most likely to release the SAEK to police.
dIsCussIOn
These findings highlight a high case volume of sexual assault 
patients and describe hospital-based attrition points before 
entering the justice system. Ensuring that EDs are adequately 
equipped to provide comprehensive care to sexual assault 
survivors is a clinical imperative. While only a fraction of 
sexual assault cases present at EDs, over 400 cases of sexual and 
domestic assault were seen in a calendar year at The Ottawa 
Hospital. Approximately two-thirds (63.8%) of eligible cases 
completed a SAEK, and less than one-third (29.7%) released 
it to police for legal investigation. In this sample, the odds 
of completing a SAEK were highest among youth cases, those 
who presented within 24 hours from the time of the assault 
and DFSAs. Releasing the SAEK to police was most common 
among cases where the survivor was uncertain of the identity 
of the assailant, and cases where the sexual assault occurred 
outdoors.
There are several factors that may contribute to the decision 
to complete a SAEK. At The Ottawa Hospital, explicit consent is 
required to complete and release the SAEK, and particular atten-
tion is given to ensure that patients are fully informed to make 
their decision free from coercion. Many complete the SAEK to 
have legal evidence to convict an assailant; others may complete 
a SAEK to bring validation to their experience, regardless of if 
they move forward legally. However, many survivors do not 
complete the SAEK due to unfamiliarity or fear, either of the

actual clinical SAEK collection process or of the legal prosecu-
tion process.20
There are several important practices that hospitals can adopt 
for improved clinical services for survivors of sexual and domestic 
assault. Having a sexual assault and domestic violence team and 
SANEs in EDs are best practices that can help support survi-
vors and reduce fear of the SAEK process and improve uptake. 
In cases where a hospital is not equipped to complete SAEKs, 
an established referral service is needed to ensure that survivors 
have full access to forensic documentation. From a hospital 
perspective, the decision to complete a SAEK does not affect the 
quality of care a patient receives; however, the survivor should 
be fully informed and supported by the hospital to complete a 
SAEK and move forward with all necessary medical resources 
if they proceed into the justice system. One initiative that some 
EDs are adopting is the establishment of a secure and confiden-
tial room within the hospital where survivors can give their offi-
cial legal testimony through video capture technology without 
having to present at the police station. The Ottawa Hospital has 
established this room in collaboration with the Ottawa Police 
Service, called a Domestic Abuse Sexual Assault (DASA) room, 
in the SAPACP clinic, and we are currently evaluating the effect 
that has on the uptake and release of SAEKs.
Over half (55.9%) of sexual assault cases happened among 
patients 24 years and younger. Youth sexual assault cases also had 
over twice the odds of completing a SAEK. Youth are a particu-
larly vulnerable population affected by sexual violence and it is 
encouraging to see that this population is overcoming barriers 
to seek care at the hospital.21 However, a cautious interpreta-
tion could also be that youth are completing SAEKs at a higher 
level because they are more impressionable and vulnerable to the 
social pressure to complete the SAEK, especially in the presence 
of police.22 An optimistic interpretation could be an age cohort 
effect, where younger survivors are becoming more empow-
ered to take action. Sexual violence education programmes 
and public campaigns challenging the normalisation of sexual 
violence are becoming a social and political priority. In 2017, 
the federal government released ‘It’s Time: Canada’s Strategy to 
Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence’ specifically calling 
on experts, advocates, survivors and researchers to help build 
comprehensive data collection systems on sexual and gender-
based violence and evidence-based resources for policy makers 
and services providers.23 There has also recently been a large 
social movement (eg, #MeToo) to publicly disclose experiences 
of sexual violence through social and traditional media, resulting 
in millions of people coming forward with their experiences of 
sexual assault and harassment.
DFSA was commonly observed in this study (53.5%). A recent 
systematic review identified eight studies reporting on the toxi-
cological findings associated with DFSA from the USA, the UK, 
Canada, France and Australia. It concluded that the prevalence 
of DFSA among sexual assault cases averaged approximately 
36%, but ranged between 9% and 77% depending on the clin-
ical setting.18 One of the most common side effects of DFSA is 
memory loss or an uncertain memory of events. This aligns with 
the current findings that several survivors reported being uncer-
tain of the identity of the assailant (54.5% knew the assailant, 
27.3% did not know the assailant and 18.3% were uncertain). 
This same pattern was also identified with the number of assail-
ants (7.9% reported multiple assailants, 77.7% had a single 
assailant and 14.4% were uncertain). A three-level categorisa-
tion was used for both variables to demonstrate the common 
patterns of uncertainty. Memory loss is commonly conceptu-
alised as reasonable doubt and can be used to undermine the 
credibility of the survivor during the prosecution process.20 Key 
practices for EDs include heightened vigilance among ED staff to 
be aware of this phenomenon and to screen for DFSA in patients 
presenting with intoxication or memory loss.
The prevalence of releasing the SAEK to police in this study 
is similar to studies documented in the USA.10 16 Half of the 
collected SAEK were released to the police, the remainders are 
held at the hospital and are destroyed within a year. Once the 
SAEK is submitted to police the hospital is no longer involved 
in the case. It remains unknown if the case was investigated or if 
SAEK was submitted for DNA testing. However, care providers 
are often called as expert witnesses in cases that proceed to trial. 
A recent country-wide investigation found that one in five sexual 
assault claims in Canada are coded as ‘unfounded’, meaning that 
the police deemed that no crime occurred or was attempted and 
the case is dismissed.24 This lead to a national outcry and the 
development and implementation of an innovative case review 
process entitled the ‘Philadelphia Model’. The ‘Philadelphia 
Model’ allows a panel of outside experts access to a sample of 
unfounded sexual assault cases from police files to determine 
if there were any missteps in the investigation of sexual assault 
cases.25 Led by the Ottawa Rape Crisis Centre, Ottawa is one of 
the first cities in Canada to implement this model. This investi-
gation focuses specifically on police reporting; however, there 
remains very little hospital-based information on the patterns of 
SAEK completion and release. Further investigation into SAEK 
completion patterns in other hospital settings and other regions 
is a critical area for continued research.
lIMITATIOns
This study uses a retrospective cross-sectional study design, 
introducing the bias that the variables associated with SAEK 
collection and release can only conservatively be conceptualised 
as correlates and not causative factors. Many assault variables 
are self-reported (eg, number of assailants, location of assault, 
etc), which may introduce measurement bias. As this study is 
hospital-based, selection bias limits our sample to those who 
are either so severely injured that they require hospital care or 
those who are willing to present at the ED. This substantially 
underestimates the frequency of sexual assaults in the larger 
population, but does not influence the generalisability of the 
proportional collection and release of SAEK among hospital 
patient populations.
COnClusIOn
The hospital aims to provide the best possible care for survivors 
of sexual and domestic violence by providing a safe environment 
with trauma informed services. Our study has shown that even 
among those with access to specialised forensic evidence collec-
tion, many do not complete a SAEK and even fewer release the 
evidence to police for legal investigation. DFSAs were common 
and, due to memory loss, can contribute to disengagement in 
the legal process. Improving the continuum of care from the 
hospital to justice system is a complex process where many survi-
vors are lost along the way. However, achieving just outcomes is 
of critical importance and the evidence from this study will go 
to support advocacy and inform best practices for survivors of 
sexual and gender-based violence.
