Abstract
The healthy lung maintains a steady state of immune readiness to rapidly respond to injury
from invaders. Integrins are important for setting the parameters of this resting state, partic-
ularly the epithelial-restricted αVβ6 integrin, which is upregulated during injury. Once
expressed, αVβ6 moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through as yet undefined molecular
mechanisms. We show that the upregulation of β6 during influenza infection is involved in
disease pathogenesis. β6-deficient mice (β6 KO) have increased survival during influenza
infection likely due to the limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces leading to reduced
ALI. Although the β6 KO have morphologically normal lungs, they harbor constitutively acti-
vated lung CD11b+ alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I IFN signaling activity,
which we traced to the loss of β6-activated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Adminis-
tration of exogenous TGF-β to β6 KO mice leads to reduced numbers of CD11b+ AMs,
decreased type I IFN signaling activity and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza
infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bac-
terial pneumonia. Our studies demonstrate that the loss of one epithelial protein, αVβ6
integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infec-
tion leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival.

 Author Summary
The lung undergoes daily assault by microbes and other inhaled particulates and must
maintain the balance between clearance of harmful microorganisms while protecting the
delicate lung structure to avoid acute lung injury. Not surprisingly, this is a complex pro-
cess requiring communication between the lung epithelial cells (first site of attack by
invaders) and the cells of the intrinsic immune response. We demonstrate the αVβ6 integ-
rin is an important player in this interface. Loss of αVβ6 during influenza infection, and
other respiratory infections, leads to bolstered protection against severe lung disease and
improved survival in mice. Even in the absence of infection, β6 KO animals have a distinct
anti-microbial lung microenvironment as evidenced by increased type I IFN activity and
activated alveolar macrophages that appear “poised to defend”. These studies explore how
the epithelial-specific αVβ6 integrin regulates the lung microenvironment to alter alveolar
macrophage activity through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism, leading to changes in both
the homeostatic lung and responses to respiratory infections as a way of balancing micro-
bial clearance with protection of the lung from excessive damage.
Introduction
At each breath, the lung is challenged by a large number and diversity of microbes and other
foreign material such as pollen and dust. Many inhaled microbes cause lethal infections if not
contained by the lung immune system, which has evolved to balance rapid and efficient micro-
bial clearance with protection of the delicate lung structure from excessive damage. Lung dam-
age caused by microbial pathogens is the cause of acute lung injury (ALI), which leads to
increased edema, alveolar permeability, and impaired oxygen exchange. In severe cases, ALI
can result in impaired gas exchange function and ultimately death (acute respiratory distress
syndrome or ARDS) [1]. To mitigate lung damage after infection, inflammation resolves,
returning to homeostasis that restores normal lung function [2,3]. The air-interface structure
of the lung involves a complex immune cell population including resident interstitial macro-
phages and dendritic cells, and GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophages [4–7]. A key ques-
tion in understanding pulmonary immunity concerns how the balance between effective
immune surveillance and maintenance of lung anatomy and physiology is achieved through
life.
Integrins are heterodimers composed of α and β subunits that regulate a plethora of cellular
functions including cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, cell activation, and the recognition and
post-translational processing of molecules [8]. In the lung microenvironment, β6 (encoded by
Itgb6) exclusively pairs with the αV subunit and expression of the αVβ6 heterodimer is limited
to epithelial cells. In this context, αVβ6 plays a key role in controlling several steps in lung
homeostasis. Mice lacking the β6 subunit (β6 KO) have highlighted the central role αVβ6
integrin plays in balancing the pulmonary environment during injury [9,10]. For example, in
both bleomycin-induced and PAR1-mediated ventilator-associated lung injury and airway
hyper-responsiveness models, β6 KO mice were protected from ALI [11–13]. β6 KO mice also
had reduced IL-1β-mediated lung injury in a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to
decreased inflammation and cellular infiltrate to the lung [14]. Alveolar macrophages isolated
from β6 KO are characterized as large and foamy and express high amounts of MMP12
[15,16].
Severe respiratory infections are often associated with ALI/ARDS [17–19], and the patho-
physiology is similar for a variety of infectious pathogens. For example, patients with SARS

 and MERS-CoV were found to have increased infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, accu-
mulation of debris in the lung, and diffuse alveolar damage [20,21]. Similarly, elderly patients
suffering from RSV sustained widespread alveolar damage [22]. Bacterial pneumonia can result
in increased formation of hyaline membranes [23]. Deposition of collagen and fibrin, while
necessary for lung repair, can also build up and block gas exchange [24]. In the case of influ-
enza, the major complication leading to ALI/ARDS is pulmonary edema and impaired fluid
clearance due to dysregulation of transporters that clear fluid from the alveolus such as ENaC
and Na+K+ATPase [23,25,26]. The virus itself can also directly kill epithelial cells [27]. ALI/
ARDS has a mortality rate of 30–50%, therefore it is critical from a public health perspective to
understand the mechanisms at play [28,29].
Given the role of the β6 integrin in modulating ALI, we hypothesized that its upregulation
during respiratory infections such as influenza would be important for viral pathogenesis. To
test this, β6 KO mice were infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. β6-deficient
mice were protected from influenza virus-induced disease as well as a broad range of respira-
tory pathogens, in most cases independent of effects on overall microbial numbers. Mechanisti-
cally, we found that epithelial β6 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. In the
absence of β6, type I interferon signaling is constitutive, causing the host to have an advantage
over the spread of the virus. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-β1 or
elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that αVβ6 controls a communication
system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism.
These studies have important implications as transient inhibition of αVβ6 may represent a
potential therapy for the management of acute lung injury.
Results
β6 KO mice are protected from diverse respiratory infections
β6 expression is induced upon mechanical or inflammatory injury and is an important media-
tor of ALI [10,12,14,30]. Thus, we hypothesized that upregulation of the β6 integrin during
respiratory infections would be involved in viral pathogenesis. To test this, we measured β6
expression by quantitative RT-PCR at different times post-influenza infection. Consistent with
lung injury models, β6 mRNA was significantly upregulated in whole lung homogenates by 3
days post-infection (dpi) and expression remained elevated through 5 dpi (p < 0.0001) corre-
lating with the appearance of ALI (Fig 1A). We then intranasally infected WT and Itgb6-defi-
cient mice (β6 KO mice) with A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus and monitored
morbidity for 12 dpi. Compared to WT controls, β6 KO mice lost significantly less weight (4, 6,
and 8 dpi p < 0.0001) and began to recover by 10 dpi, while WT mice lost weight and either
succumbed to infection or were euthanized due to morbidity between 6–10 dpi (Fig 1B and
1C). The dose of CA/09 virus used (104 TCID50) was lethal to all WT mice, while 70% β6 KO
mice survived the infection (p = 0.0090). Mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD50) studies demonstrated
the resistance of the β6 KO to influenza infection, with WT mice having an MLD50 of 102.5 ver-
sus 105.3 for the KO to the CA/09 virus. Protection was not limited to H1N1 infection; β6 KO
mice were also protected from an emerging strain of avian influenza virus associated with
severe and even fatal human respiratory disease [17], A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus
(p = 0.0326, Fig 1D). β6 KO mice were also significantly protected from a lethal challenge of
Sendai virus (p = 0.006, Fig 1E) and Streptococcus pneumonia (p = 0.0082, Fig 1F).
A major risk factor for influenza infection is secondary bacterial pneumonia [31]. As β6 KO
mice were protected from individual influenza and S. pneumoniae challenges, we tested the β6
KO mice with a secondary bacterial challenge model. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a
sublethal dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 influenza virus, and 7 dpi administered a low dose

 of S. pneumoniae (D39X strain) [32]. This dual infection model is generally lethal in WT mice,
although neither challenge alone causes death [33]. Survival of WT mice after secondary chal-
lenge was ~30%, while β6 KO mice were significantly protected (p = 0.0226) with 70% survival
(Fig 1G) highlighting the importance of β6 integrin in the pathogenesis of respiratory
infections.
β6 KO mice have decreased ALI and influenza spread within the lungs
To determine if the enhanced survival seen in the β6 KO mice was associated with decreased
ALI, we examined histological sections for evidence of tissue injury, alterations of the alveolar
capillary barrier, and inflammatory responses [1]. Although groups were histologically similar
at 3 dpi, at 7 dpi inflammation and thickened septa involving extensive areas of alveolar paren-
chyma was seen in WT lungs. In marked contrast, evidence of inflammation and tissue damage
in the β6 KO lungs was generally limited to terminal bronchioles and small numbers of adja-
cent alveoli (Fig 2A). Infected WT mice had increased TNF-α and IL-6 throughout the dura-
tion of infection, while the inflammatory cytokine response in β6 KO mice was less robust (Fig
2B). Evidence of alterations to the alveolar capillary barrier was found in infected WT mice
beginning at 5 dpi as compared to KO mice (Fig 2C–2F) including heavier lungs as determined
by wet/dry weight ratios (5 dpi p = 0.0077, 7 dpi p = 0.0063) indicating increased edema (Fig
2C), accompanied by increased total protein (p < 0.0001, Fig 2D) and albumin in the bronch-
oalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (7 dpi p < 0.0001, Fig 2E) and accumulation of Evans blue dye in
the lungs of WT mice (p = 0.0071, Fig 2F). Overall, β6 KO had decreased inflammation, acute
lung injury, and improved survival during influenza infection.
The most likely mechanism of protection in influenza infected β6 KO mice was decreased
viral titers. However, tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) and quantitative real-time PCR
showed no significant differences in viral titers, although RT-PCR suggested a trend towards
lower titers in β6 KO mice (Fig 3A and 3B). We therefore spatially monitored viral spread in
the lungs by immunohistochemistry for viral nucleoprotein (NP) and use of a reporter virus
[34,35]. Viral spread into the alveolar spaces was reduced in β6 KO mice in comparison to WT
mice, which had extensive NP staining of type II pneumocytes and macrophages in the alveolar
spaces by 5 dpi. In contrast, NP staining in β6 KO mice was largely restricted to the terminal
bronchiolar epithelium and adjacent alveoli (Fig 3C). This is even more evident using our
NLuc CA/09 reporter virus, which clearly demonstrates decreased virus in β6 KO ([34,35], S1
Fig). Finally, WT lungs had a higher percentage of sites of active infection at 5 and 7 dpi as well
as more viral antigen detected in the alveolar spaces (Fig 3D and 3E). Collectively, viral spread
in KO lungs was limited compared to WT mice, with less extensive involvement of alveolar epi-
thelial cells possibly explaining the improved lung function relative to controls. These findings
are consistent with studies suggesting that increased survival during influenza infection can be
independent of changes in viral titers [36–40].

 Loss of the β6 integrin leads to a modified lung microenvironment
To understand the underlying mechanism(s) for the decreased viral spread within the lungs of
β6 KO mice, we performed flow cytometry on BALF and lungs at different times post-infec-
tion. No significant differences were noted in numbers of TNF-α/iNOS-producing (tip)DCs,
neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or influenza PB1-specific CD8+ T cells in either BALF
(Fig 4A–4E) or whole lung (Fig 4F–4J). However, we noted substantial differences in the resi-
dent lung F480+ CD11c+ CD11b+ populations (macrophages and dendritic cells), namely that
β6 KO mice lacked a conventional CD11c+ alveolar macrophage (AM) population (Fig 5A).
AMs have characteristic flow cytometry properties as compared to dendritic cells (DCs) or
incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes including autofluoresence
in the FITC channel, high constitutive expression of CD11c, F4/80 and SiglecF and low expres-
sion of CD11b [4,41,42]. By contrast, incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory
monocytes express CD11b, providing a means to distinguish between resident AM, inflamma-
tory bone marrow-derived monocytes and DCs [4,43]. When we examined the lung macro-
phage/DC populations in uninfected β6 KO mice we found they had higher numbers of
autofluorescent cells indicating AMs (Fig 5B) but instead of the normal CD11chi CD11b- phe-
notype, the vast majority of the β6 KO AM were MerTK+, CD64+, CD11c+, and uniformly
CD11b+ (Fig 5C; See S2 and S3 Figs for gating strategies). These cells maintained expression of
F4/80 and SiglecF, suggesting they are AMs with altered properties. They were also phenotypi-
cally distinct from those of WT mice, with a ‘foamy’ appearance typical of activated macro-
phages (Fig 5D). Importantly, the β6 KO CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were present at the earliest
times tested (d3 after birth), continued to be present at all points of adulthood (S4A Fig), and
were not affected by reducing neonatal exposure to airborne particulate matter by using
HEPA-filtered cages or low dust cage bedding (S4B Fig). Even throughout the course of influ-
enza infection very few CD11chi CD11b- cells were present in the lungs of β6 KO mice (Fig
5E). As the lungs from β6 KO were overtly normal, we concluded the CD11c+ CD11b+ cells
were sufficient to perform the normal activities of lung homeostasis [12,14,16,30].
Most pulmonary AM originate from embryonic erythro-myeloid progenitors whose
replacement by blood monocytes under steady state is extremely slow [42,44]. To test whether
the β6 KO CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were predominantly derived from embryonic progenitors, we
created mice where the blood monocyte pool was severely depleted by loss of the chemokine
receptor CCR2, which is the predominant mediator for monocyte egress from the bone mar-
row. In the lungs of β6/CCR2 doubly-deficient mice, CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were present in
identical amounts compared with those of β6 KO mice, arguing these cells are unlikely to be
derived from peripheral blood monocytes (S4C Fig). Although other unknown pathways to
recruit monocytes to the lung cannot be discounted, they are not as well characterized or
understood as the CCR2 pathway. Taken together, we concluded loss of an epithelial integrin
alters the phenotype of lung AMs.
Next we tested whether the β6 KO CD11c+ CD11b+ AM were a consequence of exposure to
an altered lung microenvironment caused by loss of β6, or were caused by a cell-intrinsic
for 96 h before obtaining dry weights. Wet weight was normalized to dry weight of each individual lung before calculating fold increase over mice
inoculated with PBS (uninfected). Data are pooled from 2 independent experiments with n = 2–3 mice per group. Error bars indicate SEM.

 mechanism. Adoptive transfer of congenically marked WT AM into β6 KO animals led to the
CD11c+ CD11b+ AM phenotype after 7 days while transfer of β6 KO AMs into WT animals
results in a WT CD11chi CD11b- phenotype (Fig 6A–6C). Importantly, the effect of the β6 KO
lung microenvironment was not unique to transferred AM. Adoptive transfer of peritoneal res-
ident macrophages into β6 KO animals resulted in conversion into the CD11c+ CD11b+ AM
phenotype (Fig 6D and 6E) highlighting that it is the altered lung microenvironment of the
β6 KO that controls AM phenotype. Donor cell recovery was consistent for all experiments
(S5 Fig).
What could be different about the β6 KO lung microenvironment? β6 integrin is the pri-
mary way to endogenously activate transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the lung, which is
known to restrain AM activity [16,45]. Thus, we next asked if the altered macrophage pheno-
type in the β6 KO mice was TGF-β1 dependent. As expected, endogenous lung TGF-β1 activity
was reduced in β6 KO mice as compared to WT (Fig 7A). To test the hypothesis that reduced
TGF-β1 activity contributed to the altered lung microenvironment of β6 KO mice, we intrana-
sally administered exogenous TGF-β1 to WT and β6 KO mice every other day for 3 weeks (Fig
7B) as described [46]. β6 KO mice treated with TGF-β1 had increased numbers of CD11c+-
CD11b- macrophages (Fig 7C, quantification Fig 7D), partially reversing the CD11c+CD11b+
phenotype, and were no longer protected from influenza infection (Fig 7E) suggesting that the
loss of β6-mediated TGF-β1activation is important for both protection and the ‘activated’ mac-
rophage phenotype.
β6 KO mice have increased Type I IFN signaling
β6 KO mice had an altered lung environment resulting in decreased viral spread. Type I IFNs
are amongst the most potent cytokines limiting viral spread. Thus, we tested the hypothesis
that β6 KO mice had increased type I IFN than WT. We used phosphorylated STAT1 levels
(pSTAT1) as a marker for type I IFN signaling. Increased pSTAT1 along with increased type I
IFN gene expression and unchanged expression of type II IFN-dependent targets such as IDO1
are indicative of a type I IFN dominated environment. Further, STAT1 is a robust marker of
type I IFN signaling due to its weak activation by other cytokines such as IL-6 [47]. Immuno-
blot analysis of whole lung homogenates showed the β6 KO mice had robust type I IFN signal-
ing at baseline that increased 3–5 dpi (Fig 8A). We sought to determine the source of type I
IFNs and how epithelial-expressed β6 regulated the IFN response. We noted that type I IFN
mRNAs were not substantially altered in uninfected β6 KO mice (S6A–S6D Figs). Further-
more, ELISA measurements for type I IFNs did not show substantial differences between WT
and β6 KO mice within whole lung homogenates. Therefore, we generated β6 KO mice crossed
to an IFN-β-YFP reporter strain. In these mice, YFP expression in the whole lung was predom-
inantly found in CD45+ cells and increased in the absence of β6 (Fig 8B); although

 immunofluorescent microscopy of frozen lung sections from WT and β6 KO YFP reporter
mice showed increased YFP+ cells scattered throughout the lung; including in the epithelia (Fig
8C and 8D). Further delineation of the exact cell types in this system expressing YFP is pre-
cluded by the strong autofluorescence in the FITC channel in lung macrophages [4]. Thus, we
examined isolated AMs and primary epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface from β6
KO and WT mice for increased type I IFN signaling.
Sorting autofluorescent CD11c+CD11b- AM from uninfected WT mice and comparing
them by microarray to autofluorescent CD11c+CD11b+ ‘AM’ from β6 KO demonstrated that
β6 KO AM showed a striking enrichment of gene ontogeny and pathway terms linked to
immune responses (S7 Fig), particularly genes associated with type I IFN responses (Fig 8E,
Table 1). There was no difference in IDO1 expression, a cardinal IFN-γ regulated gene [48]
(Table 1). These data suggest lung macrophages in the absence of β6 had increased IFN signal-
ing. To test this further, we measured phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT1, hallmarks of the
type I IFN response, in the alveolar macrophage populations from WT and β6 KO mice.
CD11c+ CD11b+ macrophages from uninfected β6 KO mice had increased phospho-IRF3 and
phospho-STAT1 relative to WT CD11c+CD11b- AM (Fig 8F).
To determine if type I IFN signaling was also increased in epithelial cells, primary broncho-
tracheal epithelial cells (mTEC) from WT and β6 KO mice were isolated, differentiated and
grown at the air-liquid interface prior to infection with CA/09 virus (MOI 0.1). Phosphorylated
and total levels of STAT1 and IRF3 were quantitated at 24 hours post-infection by immunoblot
(Fig 8H). β6 KO mTEC exhibited significant increases in total STAT1 and IRF3 levels as com-
pared to WT mTEC after infection as well as at baseline, although differences in phosphory-
lated STAT1 and IRF3 were minimal (Fig 8H and S6E Fig). Based on these data, we concluded
that regulation of type I IFNs was dysregulated in the lungs of β6 KO mice at baseline, and that
hematopoietic cells as well as epithelial cells may be involved.
Finally, to determine if this is regulated by TGF-β1, lung homogenates from mice adminis-
tered exogenous TGF-β1 were monitored for total and phosphorylated STAT1. Treatment
decreased phospho-STAT1 in whole lung homogenate (Fig 8I). Macrophages isolated from
TGF-β1-treated β6 KO mice also displayed significantly decreased mRNA encoding levels of
the IFN associated transcripts Irf7, Ifit1, and Oas1g that were comparable to levels in WT mac-
rophages (Fig 8G) highlighting that the loss of β6 activated TGF-β results in an altered lung
macrophage population and increased type I IFN activation. We question whether this was the
reason for the enhanced protection from influenza infection.
Increased survival in β6 KO mice is dependent on type I IFN activity
To determine if the increased type I IFN signaling in β6 KO mice was responsible for the
enhanced protection, we crossed β6 KO with Ifnar-/- mice (β6/IFNAR double KO), which lack
the type I IFN receptor and all type I IFN signaling, then challenged these mice and their cog-
nate controls created from the same heterozygote crosses with 104 TCID50 of CA/09 virus.
Mice were monitored for morbidity and mortality for 12 days. β6/IFNAR double KO mice did
not survive infection (p = 0.0039 compared to β6 KO, Fig 9A) and exhibited similar mortality
to WT mice. Further, imaging WT, β6 KO, IFNAR KO, and β6/IFNAR double KO mice

 viral spread in β6/IFNAR double KO mice was comparable to WT and IFNAR KO mice,
highlighting the importance of type I IFN signaling in limiting viral spread during infection.
However, the ‘activated’ CD11c+CD11b+ macrophage phenotype of the β6 KO crosses
remained the same as β6/IFNAR double KO (Fig 9B) suggesting the protective anti-viral phe-
notype of the β6 KO is type I IFNAR-dependent, but another pathway regulates the phenotype
of the resident macrophages in the β6 KO independent of type I IFNs.
Discussion
We propose a model where during pulmonary homeostasis, β6 integrin, possibly by activation
of endogenous TGF-β1, suppresses CD11b expression on alveolar macrophages and type I IFN
signaling within the lung microenvironment. However, in the absence of β6 integrin, CD11b
expression is increased as is type I IFN signaling inducing a ‘primed’ antiviral state in the
absence of infection (Fig 10). Through the use of TGF-β1 ‘rescue’ experiments and β6 KO mice
lacking type I IFN signaling, we were able to demonstrate the resistance of β6 KO mice to influ-
enza depended on the loss of TGF-β1 and this elevated type I IFN signaling, while the pheno-
typic changes in lung macrophages were independent of the type I IFN pathway at least at the
level of type I IFN signaling as shown in the β6/IFNAR double KO mice.
Overall, our data argue β6 expression leads to changes in the lung microenvironment that
are mediated immediately after birth and include alterations in the AM population, and
repressed type I IFN signaling in the lung most likely through a major contribution from TGF-
β1. This pathway might lead to selective regulation of pathogen colonization or spread,
depending on the pathogen’s sensitivity to the pre-existing interferon milieu. Two caveats to
the model proposed in Fig 10 include (i) the fact that β6 may regulate factors other than TGF-
β1 that cause the downstream effects, and (ii) that we cannot yet definitively distinguish
whether β6 negatively regulates type I IFN signaling, type I IFN production or both pathways.
In our hands, assays quantitating type I IFN amounts by ELISA or bead-based assays are vari-
able, lacking sensitivity or reproducibility. Furthermore, the potential increase in type I recep-
tor expression on β6 KO macrophages (Table 1) could cause increased uptake of type I IFNs
and not accurately reflect the soluble amounts present in the lung at a given time in homeosta-
sis. Thus, the identification of the point at which β6 (with or without TGF-β1) negatively regu-
lates IFN signaling will require new tools and approaches investigating regulation in both
macrophages and epithelial cells.
Mice lacking the β6 integrin are protected from disease caused by influenza infection. Com-
pared to WT controls, β6 KO mice develop less severe ALI, as characterized by edema, inflam-
matory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability of the lung epithelium. β6 KO mice also
have altered baseline homeostasis possessing high baseline CD11b+ CD11c+ macrophages as

 opposed to CD11b- CD11c+ alveolar macrophages. A reasonable interpretation of these data is
that β6 KO mice are ‘primed’ for a more efficient response to respiratory pathogens, due to
constitutively increased type I IFN signaling at baseline. Importantly, protection extended
beyond pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain to include other influenza virus strains, Sendai
virus, and S. pneumoniae infection. However, protection did not extend to all infections tested.
We challenged β6 KO mice with Francisella tularensis Schu4 strain using 25 live organisms via
the intranasal route. Schu4-infected β6 KO mice had no differences in survival compared to
controls consistent with experiments performed in the Ifnar-/- mice [49] (CB, personal com-
munication) (S8A Fig). Although β6 KO mice were significantly protected from disease caused
by H7N9 virus (Fig 1D) they were not protected from the highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) A/Hong Kong/483/1997 H5N1 infection (HK/483, S8B Fig). HPAI H5N1 viruses are
unique in their ability to rapidly spread beyond the respiratory tract and cause systemic,
including neurological, disease [18] and productively replicate in alveolar macrophages [50]. It
is possible that HPAI H5N1 viruses are more resistant to type I IFN, that mice succumb due to
direct viral cytopathic effect, or complications of systemic infection. Further studies are needed
to understand why β6 KO mice are not protected against HPAI H5N1 infection. Taken
together, these data suggest β6-mediated modulation of IFN responses affects responses to
multiple respiratory pathogens whereas protective responses depend on IFN signaling.
The airway epithelium is a complex barrier comprised of multiple cell types that acts as an
interface between the external environment and the internal lung milieu. It serves three main
functions in a healthy lung; providing a tight mechanical barrier that rapidly repairs upon
insult, mediating innate immune activity to limit foreign antigen invasion, and initiating an
inflammatory response through production of cytokines and chemokines [51]. A variety of
experimental models and human studies demonstrate the host response to respiratory infec-
tion involves initiation, resolution, and restoration phases, all of which must be tightly regu-
lated to prevent disease [52]. However, little is known about how interactions between
epithelial cells, which are often the primary targets of respiratory pathogens, and alveolar mac-
rophages, which play a critical role in controlling infections, and the regulation of these
responses. Our data identify a pathway by which alveolar epithelial cells normally suppress the
anti-microbial activity of alveolar macrophages through a pathway that may involve local

 activation of TGF-β and subsequent suppression of IFN signaling. In terms of homeostasis, lit-
tle is known about how type I IFNs control the status of tissue microenvironments. Most work
on type I IFN signaling has been associated with anti-viral responses and the regulation of
inflammation over the first 18–24 months of life [16]. The implication of our findings is that
the lung can tolerate a homeostatic increase in IFN signaling, which provides an advantage
against viral spread, but likely comes with ‘costs’ that are not yet clear. We note a recent study
has shown homeostatic IFN-β and IFNAR signaling in the brain has an essential role in sup-
pressing neurodegeneration [53]. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the hith-
erto unknown tissue-specific homeostatic roles of type I IFN signaling is warranted. During
infection, although it would seem that upregulation of β6 would only have a negative impact
on the host by limiting the anti-viral response, it could also be important for balancing the
inflammatory response by suppressing activated macrophages through a TGF-β-dependent
process [2,5,15,45], initiating wound repair, or by recruiting macrophages to the site of infec-
tion. Attempts to address the role of TGF-β in influenza pathogenesis by systemic inhibition
resulted in lethal infection [54]. Thus, future studies will focus on inhibiting the β6 integrin at
different times post-infection to understand its precise role in viral infection and its potential
as a therapeutic target.
Why is the lung macrophage population different in the β6 KO mice? The αVβ6 integrin is
expressed at low amounts in healthy adult tissue but is rapidly upregulated during development
and in response to injury and inflammation [30]. Once expressed, β6 activates latent TGF-β1
by binding to the RGD motif in the latency-associated peptide (LAP) [10,55]. Upon activation,
TGF-β1 regulates a variety of genes associated with the immune response and pulmonary
fibrosis and is thought to negatively restrict inflammation in macrophages through an
unknown mechanism [45]. However, systemic inhibition of all TGF-β isoforms by a broadly
neutralizing antibody led to lethal influenza infection [54] suggesting that the role of TGF-β
during infection may be complex and depend on both the cellular milieu and TGF-β isoform.
Recent work has shown that the pulmonary microenvironment dictates the behavior of alveo-
lar macrophages to a greater extent than the origin of the macrophages [42]. Based on our stud-
ies we propose that in the lung microenvironment, upregulation of the β6 integrin leads to
localized activation of TGF-β1 that negatively regulates alveolar macrophages leading to
decreased type I IFN activity in the microenvironment through an as yet undefined mechanism
that will require further molecular investigation. An important extension of this model is that
influenza viruses themselves activate latent TGF-β during infection [56] and global inhibition
of TGF-β during infection is lethal, suggesting an important role in protection from influenza
[54]. Therefore, it will be important to be able to experimentally segregate the host- versus
virus-specific TGF-β processing events in mice expressing or lacking β6 integrin.
Overall, loss of the β6 integrin resulted in protection from a variety of respiratory infections
including influenza and Sendai viruses, bacterial pneumonia, and viral-bacterial co-infections.
β6 KO mice had significantly reduced extent and severity of lung injury and inflammation,
reduced collagen deposition despite no difference in viral titer, consistent with studies using β6
integrin function blocking antibodies [57], with virus infection being more restricted to airways
instead of infiltrating the deep-lung alveolar spaces. β6 function blocking antibodies have been
successfully used to improve outcome in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and currently recruiting
for phase II human clinical trials [58,59]. While the β6 integrin represents an attractive
Fig 10. Model for β6 integrin modulation of pulmonary microenvironment. Shown is a depiction of a model whereby TGF-β1, processed by the αVβ6
integrin, directly regulates macrophage cell surface CD11b and the type I IFN response. Other pathways may cooperate with TGF-β1. The exact
relationship between the suppression of type I signaling versus the production of type I IFNs through αVβ6 remains to be established.

 therapeutic target to combat pulmonary disease, it does play a role in lung homeostasis. While
transient inhibition of β6 in the lung results in resistance to infection, complete lack of β6 func-
tion for long periods of time could be detrimental. Over long periods of time, β6 KO mice over
produce macrophage-derived matrix metalloprotease MMP12, leading to emphysema and
destruction of pulmonary tissue [16]. However, for short-term protection against the adverse
consequences of potentially lethal pulmonary viral infections, our work identifies the αVβ6
integrin as a potentially attractive therapeutic target for transient intervention in lung viral
infection.

onto the C57BL/6 background, were obtained from Dean Sheppard (UCSF) then bred at St
Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Littermate controls from heterozygous crosses were used as
controls. IFNAR KO mice were obtained from Dr. Laura Knoll (University of Wisconsin).
Knockouts were confirmed by PCR using primer sets (CCR2, IFNAR) reported on the Jackson
Laboratories website, or as previously described (β6) [16].
Viruses, bacteria and cells
A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1, A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 and
A/Hong Kong/483/1991 H5N1 influenza viruses were propagated in 10-day old specific-patho-
gen-free embroynated chicken eggs and viral titers determined by tissue culture infectious dose
50 (TCID50) on Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK; ATCC CCL-34, Manassas, VA)
cells as described [50] and quantitated [60]. Enders strain Sendai virus was propagated as
described [61]. D39X S. pneumoniae was grown in C + Y medium to log phase (O.D. 0.4), pel-
leted, and diluted to the appropriate concentration in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 and
stored on ice until infection. MDCK cells were cultured in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM)
(Corning, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) at 37°C, 5% CO2.
mTEC culture. Primary murine tracheal epithelial cells (mTEC) were isolated as previ-
ously described [62]. Briefly, tracheas were collected from euthanized mice and epithelial cells
collected by scraping. Cells were cultured on transwell inserts pre-coated with 5 μg/cm2 of both
rat-tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and human fibronectin (BD Biosci-
ences). When cells reached 100% confluency, they were cultured at air-liquid interface for 3–4
weeks until fully differentiated (defined as trans-epithelial resistance > 300 O cm2).

 Infections
Influenza virus.
Four- to nine-week-old male and female C57BL/6 (WT) mice and β6 KO
mice were lightly anesthetized by isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with PBS (control),
CA/09 H1N1 (104 TCID50), or H7N9 and H5N1 (102 TCID50) influenza viruses. Mice were
monitored at least daily for morbidity, weights recorded every 48 hours and tissues/BALF col-
lected at different times post-infection. Mice were euthanized if they lost more than 30% of
starting weight and exhibited any symptoms of paralysis. H7N9 and H5N1 experiments were
performed in a USDA-certified biosafety level 3 enhanced containment laboratory [63].
Sendai virus.
Mice were deeply anesthetized with Avertin then intranasally inoculated
with 2.0x104 plaque forming units (PFU) of Sendai virus (Enders strain), monitored daily for
weight loss and morbidity. Separate groups of animals were sacrificed at 3d post-infection to
collect nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs for virus titrations.
Bacterial challenge.
Mice were intranasally inoculated with 4 x 107 colony forming units
(CFU) of D39X S. pneumoniae and monitored daily for morbidity.
Secondary bacterial challenge.
Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and intranasally
inoculated with 80 TCID50 units of PR8 influenza virus, followed by 100 CFU of labeled D39X
Streptococcus pneumoniae at 7 dpi [32]. Mice were monitored for morbidity, lungs collected at
various times post-infection to quantify viral titers, and bled at 48 h post-bacterial challenge (9
d post-influenza infection) for determination of bacterial blood titers.
Fransicella tularensis challenge.
F. tularensis SchuS4 was propagated as previously
described [64] and grown in Mueller Hinton (MMH) broth overnight, aliquoted into 1 ml sam-
ples and frozen at -80°C. Immediately prior to use aliquots were thawed and serially diluted to
the desired concentration in pharmaceutical grade saline. Inoculum doses were confirmed by
plating diluted bacteria on MMH agar and enumerating colonies after 48 hours incubation at
37°C. Mice were anesthetized by a single intraperitoneal injection of 12.5 mg/ml ketamine
+ 3.8 mg/ml xylazine and immediately inoculated intranasally with 25 CFU F. tularensis
SchuS4. All mice were monitored daily for signs of illness.
Bioluminescent influenza infection.
WT, IFNAR KO, β6 KO, or β6/IFNAR DKO mice
were infected with 105 TCID50 of A/California/04/09 (H1N1) encoding the bioluminescent
NLuc reporter on the influenza PA gene (CA/09-NLuc) [34,35]. Briefly, mice were deeply anes-
thetized with isoflurane before retro-orbital injection of 5 μl of NanoGlo substrate (Promega,
Madison, WI) diluted in 95 μl of sterile PBS. Mice were immediately imaged for 3 min using a
Xenogen IVIS200 system with LivingImage software (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Luminescent
flux was quantified as photons per second.
Histopathology and immunofluorescent staining
Deeply anesthetized mice were perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin, tissues collected
at the indicated time post-infection, and embedded in paraffin. H&E and immunohistochemi-
cal slides were blinded and scored by PV. Influenza NP staining was performed with anti-NP
antibodies (05G, US Biological, Massachusetts, MA) and five separate lung sections quantitated
using Aperio ePathology software (Buffalo Grove, IL).
YFP staining.
Fixed lung tissue from uninfected WT or β6 KO mice containing the Ifnb1-
YFP reporter was cryoprotected with 20% sucrose prior to embedding. 20 μm thick sections
were air dried and subsequently treated with cold acetone for 5 min. Following rehydration in
PBS, sections were incubated with Alexa555-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (1μg/ml; Ther-
moFisher, W32464) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were
washed in PBS, mounted with hardset media (Vector laboratories), and imaged using a Maria-
nis spinning disk confocal microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) equipped with a 63X

 1.2NA objective and EMCCD camera, and analyzed using Slidebook software (Intelligent
Imaging Innovations). Ten separate fields were imaged per mouse.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA from whole lung homogenates was isolated using a Trizol (Invitrogen) per manufactur-
er’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitro-
gen) and the following parameters: 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 1 hour, and 85°C for 5 min. PCR
was run using 2 μl of cDNA to detect Itgb6, Irf7, Ifit1, and Oas1g mRNA using the Quantitect
primer/probe assay system (Qiagen) per manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were normalized to
GAPDH mRNA as the internal control.
Immunoblotting
Whole lungs were collected at different times post-infection and homogenized in RIPA buffer
(50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% TritonX-
100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL). After
centrifugation at 15000 rpm at 4°C, protein concentration was determined using the Bradford
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and equivalent amounts loaded onto 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE
gels (Lonza, Allendale, NJ). After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were probed for integ-
rin β6 (0.236 μg/ml, ch2A1 antibody, a kind gift from Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA), anti-
STAT1 (E-23, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-346) (0.1 μg/ml), anti-pSTAT1 (D4A7, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, 7649S) (1:1000 dilution), anti-IRF3 (D83B9, Cell Signaling, 4947S) (1:1000 dilu-
tion), or anti-pIRF3 (4D4G, Cell Signaling, 4302S) (1:1000 dilution) and detected using HRP
conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (0.1–0.2 μg/ml, Jackson)
and visualized with ECL. Anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma, St Louis, MO, A5441) (1 μg/ml) or anti-
GAPDH (mAbcam 9484, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, ab9484) (1 μg/ml) served as loading
controls.
Lung permeability assays
Wet lung weight. Lungs were harvested and weighed to determine wet lung weight. Lungs
were dried for 96 h at 65°C and weighed again to determine dry lung weight. Lung weight was
calculated as (wet lung weight–dry lung weight) to determine weight of liquid in the tissue.
Vascular permeability assays. BALF was collected and total protein content quantified by
BCA assay (Pierce), and albumin concentration measured by ELISA (Bethyl, Montgomery,
TX).
Endothelial permeability assay.
At 8 dpi, mice were administered 20 mg/kg Evans blue
dye (Sigma) by retro-orbital injection. The dye was allowed to circulate for 2 h before mice
were sacrificed and perfused with 10 ml PBS. Lungs were harvested and incubated in formam-
ide (Sigma) at 37°C. After 48 h, lungs were removed from formamide and dried at 65°C for an
additional 96 h before being weighed. Evans blue dye absorbance was measured by spectropho-
tometry at 620 nm. The lung permeability index [65] was calculated using the following for-
mula: [absorbance / dry lung weight (g)].
Analysis of immune cell populations
BALF or whole lung homogenate was collected from PBS control and influenza inoculated
mice at 2, 5, 6, or 7 dpi.
BALF preparation.
Total cell infiltrate into the BALF was counted by Trypan blue exclu-
sion staining.

 Lung preparation. Lungs were finely minced with a surgical blade and digested in Neuro-
basal medium (Gibco) containing 1 mg/ml DNaseI (Worthington), 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase P
(Roche), 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase/Dispase (Roche), and 1x B27 and N2 supplements (Gibco) at
37°C for 30 min. The digest was dissociated though a 1 ml pipette tip and passed through a
70 μM nylon mesh to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells were treated with Red Blood Cell
Lysis buffer (Sigma) prior to further analysis.
Staining.
Equivalent cell numbers were treated with Fc block (BD Biosciences) and surface
stained with combinations of anti-MHC II (M5/114.15.2), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD11b
(M1/70), and anti-Ly6c (HK1.4) antibodies (eBiosciences) (neutrophils) or anti-Ly6g (1A8),
anti-MHC class II (AF6–120.1), anti-CD11c (N418; eBioscience), anti-Ly6c (ER-MP20; AbD
Serotech), anti-CD11b (M1/70; BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 (RM4.5; BD Biosciences), anti-
NK1.1 (PK136; BD Biosciences), αβT cell receptor (H57–597; BD), anti-CD8 (53–6.7;
eBioscience), anti-iNOS (M-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-TNF-α (MP6-XT22; BD
Biosciences) (tipDCs, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells) as previously described [37,66]. CD8+ T cells
were stained with tetramers specific for the DbPB1-F262–70 epitope for 1 h at room temperature
prior to surface staining with the monoclonal antibodies as previously described [66].
Macrophage population analysis
Lung digestion. Mouse lungs were finely minced with a surgical blade and digested in
Neurobasal medium (Gibco) containing 1 mg/ml DNase I (Worthington), 2.5 mg/ml Collage-
nase P (Roche), 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase/Dispase (Roche), and 1x B27 and N2 media supple-
ments (Gibco) at 37°C for 30 min. The digest was dissociated though a 1 ml pipette tip and
passed through a 70 μM nylon mesh to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells were treated with
Red Blood Cell Lysis buffer (Sigma) prior to further analysis.
Flow cytometry. Lung cells were treated with Fc block and surface stained with anti-
CD11b (M1/70, BioLegend) (1 μg/ml), anti-CD11c (HL3, BD Pharmigen) (1 μg/ml), and anti-
F4/80 (BM8, BioLegend) (1 μg/ml) antibodies. The alveolar macrophage population was gated
on autofluorescence in the FL-1 channel and high F4/80 expression relative to single color con-
trols. In some experiments further gating with SiglecF (E50-2440, BD Pharmagen, 552126)
(1 μg/ml), MerTK (DS5MMER, eBioscience, 12-5751-82) (1:100 dilution), CD64 (X54-5/7.1,
BioLegend, 139306) (1:100 dilution), was performed.
Microarray analysis.
RNA was collected from sorted populations using Trizol (Invitro-
gen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (100 ng) was converted to biotin-
labeled cDNA (Ambion WTA protocol) and hybridized to a Mouse Gene 2.0 array (Affyme-
trix) according to the manufacturer’s protocol by the Hartwell Center of St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital. Probe signals from scanned arrays were summarized by the RMA method
[67] and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) performed as described [68] using curated
pathways from MolSigDB (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA).
Adoptive transfers
Sorted populations of macrophages were administered intratracheally to WT or β6 KO mice.
For the AM adoptive transfer, autofluorescent FITC+ F4/80+ lung cells were sorted from donor
mice. 200,000 cells were transferred into each recipient mouse in 100 μl PBS.
For transfer of naive PDM, the mouse peritoneal cavity was washed/flushed with 10 ml of
PBS, and the F4/80+ population sorted. 500,000 cells were transferred into each recipient
mouse in 100 μl PBS. After 7 days, mice were sacrificed and AM populations assessed. Donors
and recipients were distinguished by CD45.1 and CD45.2 markers.

 Cytokine analysis
BALF or whole lung homogenate was collected from PBS control and influenza inoculated
mice at the indicated time post-infection. TNF-α and IL-6 protein expression was determined
using the Milliplex Mouse 25-plex Cytokine Detection System mouse cytokine kit (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) on a Luminex100 109 reader (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Cytokine concentration was calculated using a calibration curve obtained
in each experiment using the respective recombinant proteins.
TGF-β ELISA
Active TGF-β1 protein levels were quantified by ELISA assay (BioLegend) on whole lung
homogenates according to manufacturer’s protocol.
TGF-β experiments
Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally administered 1 μg of recombi-
nant TGF-β1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or PBS as previously described [46]. After 18 h, mice
were lightly anesthetized and intranasally inoculated with 104 TCID50 CA/09 virus. At 2 dpi,
mice were given an additional dose of rTGF-β1 or PBS and monitored for morbidity as
described. For homeostasis studies, 1 μg of TGF-β1 was administered every 48 hours for 3
weeks.
Quantitative RT-PCR (IFNs)
RNA from whole lung homogenates was isolated using a Trizol (Invitrogen) per manufactur-
er’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitro-
gen) and the following parameters: 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 1 hour, and 85°C for 5 min. PCR
was run using 2 μl of diluted cDNA (1:5 in dH2O) to detect IFNa2/IFNa11 or IFNb mRNA
using the Taqman primer/probe assay system (Life Technologies) per manufacturer’s protocol.
Samples were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression as the internal control.
Type I IFN ELISA
IFN-α (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway Township, NJ) and IFN-β (BioLegend, San Diego, CA)
protein levels were quantified by ELISA assay on whole lung homogenates according to manu-
facturer’s protocol.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA) as described in the
Fig legends. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
