ABSTRACT: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a lifesaving technique for 
victims of sudden cardiac arrest. Despite advances in resuscitation science, 
basic life support remains a critical factor in determining outcomes. The 
American Heart Association recommendations for adult basic life support 
incorporate the most recently published evidence and serve as the basis 
for education and training for laypeople and healthcare providers who 
perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
I
n 2015, the American Heart Association (AHA) published the “2015 AHA Guide-
lines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular 
Care” including recommendations for adult basic life support (BLS) and cardiopul-
monary resuscitation (CPR) quality.1 That guidelines update was based on the “2015 
International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardio-
vascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations” (CoSTR) developed by the 
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR).2 As planned, ILCOR is now 
transitioning to a process of continuous evidence evaluation, with the intent to issue 
updated systematic reviews and CoSTR statements when prompted by the publica-
tion of new evidence. A description of the evidence review process and a glossary of 
terms are available in the 2017 BLS CoSTR summary.3 When indicated, the AHA 
will publish focused updates for guidelines related to the areas reviewed by ILCOR.
The first topics selected by ILCOR as part of the continuous evidence evaluation 
process are related to BLS, including dispatch-assisted CPR, the use of continuous 
versus interrupted chest compressions by emergency medical services (EMS) provid-
ers, and the use of chest compression–only (hands-only) CPR versus CPR using chest 
compressions with ventilation in both the in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. 
The evidence evaluated included studies used to support the 2015 CoSTR2 and new 
literature published since 2015.
It is important to note that this focused update covers only those topics ad-
dressed by ILCOR’s new continuous evidence evaluation process as of 2017. The 
ILCOR systematic reviews use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment, and Evaluation methodology and its associated nomenclature for strength 
of recommendation and level of evidence. The expert writing group for this adult 
BLS–focused update reviewed the studies cited in the 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 
and carefully considered the ILCOR consensus recommendations in light of the 
structure and resources of the out-of-hospital and in-hospital resuscitation systems 
that use AHA guidelines. In addition, the writing group determined classes of rec-
ommendation and levels of evidence according to the most recent report by the 
American College of Cardiology/AHA on clinical practice guidelines (Table)4 by using 
the process detailed in part 2 of the 2015 guidelines update.5 All other recommen-
dations and algorithms published in the 2015 guidelines update1 and the “2010

Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science Subcommittee 
and writing groups.
Recommendations for each topic addressed in this 
adult BLS–focused update are classified as follows:
1. Unchanged recommendations
2. Updated recommendations (may be updated in 
wording, class, level of evidence, or any combina-

At the request of the AHA Training Network, we 
have also clarified the descriptions of lay rescuers as 
follows:
1. Untrained
2. Trained in chest compression–only CPR

AND GUIDELINES
3. Trained in CPR using chest compressions and ven-
tilation (rescue breaths)
DISPATCH-ASSISTED CPR
The 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 and systematic review 
considered instructions for dispatch-assisted chest com-
pression–only CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
(OHCA).
2017 Summary of Evidence
No new studies were reviewed for this topic.
2017 Recommendation—Updated
1. We recommend that when dispatchers’ 
instructions are needed, dispatchers should 
provide chest compression–only CPR instruc-
tions to callers for adults with suspected 
OHCA (Class I; Level of Evidence C-LD).
BYSTANDER CPR
The 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 and systematic review 
compared bystander use of chest compression–only 
CPR with CPR using chest compressions and ventilation 
(rescue breaths).
2017 Summary of Evidence
Iwami et al7 examined the influence of Japan’s nation-
wide dissemination of recommendations for continu-
ous chest compression CPR for lay rescuers, including 
dispatcher-assisted CPR, at a time when CPR guidelines 
recommended compressions plus ventilation (rescue 
breaths) at a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths. The 
unadjusted analysis showed that nationwide the inter-
vention was associated with improved bystander CPR 
rates and increased survival. However, in an unadjusted 
analysis of crude data, patients receiving continuous 
chest compressions had a lower rate of return of spon-
taneous circulation (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.78–0.82), worse 1-month survival (odds 
ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.78), and worse 1-month 
survival with good neurological outcome (odds ratio, 
0.72; 95% CI, 0.69–0.76) compared with those receiv-
ing CPR using a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths.
2017 Recommendations—Updated
1. For adults in OHCA, untrained lay rescuers 
should provide chest compression–only CPR 
with or without dispatcher assistance (Class 
I; Level of Evidence C-LD).
2. For lay rescuers trained in chest compres-
sion–only CPR, we recommend they provide 
chest compression–only CPR for adults in 
OHCA (Class I; Level of Evidence C-LD).
3. For lay rescuers trained in CPR using chest 
compressions and ventilation (rescue breaths), 
it is reasonable to provide ventilation (res-
cue breaths) in addition to chest compres-
sions for the adult in OHCA (Class IIa; Level 
of Evidence C-LD).
EMS-DELIVERED CPR
The 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 and systematic review 
considered the use of interrupted versus continuous 
chest compressions when EMS providers performed 
CPR using chest compressions and ventilation before 
placement of an advanced airway.
2017 Summary of Evidence
The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium conducted 
a cluster-randomized crossover trial of adults with 
EMS-treated nontraumatic, nonasphyxial cardiac ar-
rest.8 All patients received positive-pressure ventilation 
during CPR before placement of an advanced airway 
(supraglottic airway or tracheal tube). In the interven-
tion group, chest compressions were provided continu-
ously and ventilation was delivered asynchronously at 
a rate of 10 breaths per minute without pausing chest 
compressions. In the control group, chest compres-
sions were interrupted for ventilation at a ratio of 30 
compressions to 2 breaths. The study analyzed 23 711 
adults with cardiac arrest using a primary outcome of 
survival to hospital discharge. Overall, there was no 
significant difference in outcome between patients 
in the intervention group and those in the control 
group, with survival to discharge of 9.0% and 9.7%, 
respectively (adjusted difference, −0.7; 95% CI, −1.5 
to 0.1; P=0.07). Likewise, there was no difference in 
survival with good neurological outcome (7.0% versus 
7.7%; adjusted difference, −0.6; 95% CI, −1.4 to 0.1; 
P=0.09).
2017 Recommendations—Updated
1. It is reasonable that before placement of an 
advanced airway (supraglottic airway or tra-
cheal tube), EMS providers perform CPR with 
cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths (Class 
IIa; Level of Evidence B-R). It may be reason-
able for EMS providers to use a rate of 10 
breaths per minute (1 breath every 6 sec-
onds) to provide asynchronous ventilation 
during continuous chest compressions before

placement of an advanced airway (Class IIb; 
Level of Evidence B-R).
2. These updated recommendations do not 
preclude the 2015 recommendation that a 
reasonable alternative for EMS systems that 
have adopted bundles of care is the initial 
use of minimally interrupted chest compres-
sions (ie, delayed ventilation) for witnessed 
shockable OHCA (Class IIb; Level of Evidence 
C-LD).
CPR FOR CARDIAC ARREST
The 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 and systematic review 
considered the use of continuous versus interrupted 
chest compressions after placement of an advanced 
airway in the hospital setting.
2017 Summary of Evidence
No new studies were reviewed for this topic.
2017 Recommendations—Updated
1. Whenever an advanced airway (tracheal 
tube or supraglottic device) is inserted dur-
ing CPR, it may be reasonable for providers to 
perform continuous compressions with pos-
itive-pressure ventilation delivered without 
pausing chest compressions (Class IIb; Level 
of Evidence C-LD). It may be reasonable for 
the provider to deliver 1 breath every 6 sec-
onds (10 breaths per minute) while continu-
ous chest compressions are being performed 
(Class IIb; Level of Evidence C-LD).
CHEST COMPRESSION–TO–
VENTILATION RATIO
The 2017 BLS CoSTR summary3 and systematic review 
considered the compression-to-ventilation ratio for 
adult BLS.
2017 Summary of Evidence
No new studies were reviewed for this topic.
2017 Recommendation—Updated
1. It is reasonable for rescuers trained in CPR 
using chest compressions and ventilation 
(rescue breaths) to provide a compression- 
to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for adults in car-
diac arrest (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C-LD).
