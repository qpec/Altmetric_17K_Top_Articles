Epidemiological surveys conducted in general populations have found that the prevalence of depression is about
9% in the United States. World Health Organization has projected that depression will be leading cause of
disease burden by the year 2030. Growing evidence suggests that sedentary lifestyle is an important risk factor of
depression among adults. The relationship between television watching/computer use and depression in US
adults is still unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between television watching/
computer use and depression. This is a cross-sectional study that used the secondary data from the National
Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011/2012). Participants were 3201 US adults who
were 20 years or more. Self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] was used to classify depression
level; self-reported hours of watching TV and use of computer/day, and demographic information were obtained
from NHANES data set. SAS®9.4was used to perform all statistical analyses and final model selection procedure.
Depression was found to be significantly higher among female. Results showed that moderate or severe de-
pression level was associated with higher time spent on TV watching and use of computer (> 6 h/day) (adjusted
odds ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.602–3.442). Duration of screen time was significantly associated when all covariates
were adjusted. TV watching and computer use can predict the depression level among adults. Prospective studies
and measurement of factors such as: work place sitting, social relationship, and family history of depression are
warranted.
1. Introduction
Depression is one of the most common mental disorders and it is
estimated that 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression
globally (Marcus et al., 2016). World Health Organization predicts that
depression will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide by the
year 2030 (World Health Organization, 2011). Data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012 has indicated
that about 7.6% of people aged 12 and over had moderate or severe
depression (Pratt and Brody, 2014). Studies have found that females are
more likely to experience depressive symptoms than male (de Wit et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2016). Several researches have been conducted to
seek the association between depression and individual characteristics
such as: physical activity, socio-economic status and existing disease
conditions, and reported that these factors are associated with depres-
sion (Freeman et al., 2016; Ma and Xiao, 2010; Vallance et al., 2011;
Zhao et al., 2011). Research in sedentary behavior and health risk
suggests that engaging in sedentary behavior is associated with de-
pression and several chronic diseases such as: type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases (de Wit et al., 2011; Megan et al., 2014;
Teychenne et al., 2010).
Sedentary behavior can be defined as behavior characterized by a
seated or reclining posture and low energy expenditure (≤1.5
Metabolic Equivalent Task) (Teychenne et al., 2010). TV watching and
computer use are common sedentary activities in United States and
elsewhere. People who spend > 4 h of screen time such as: TV
watching and computer use, are at higher risk of developing depression
(de Wit et al., 2011; Hamer et al., 2013). While, it is also reported that
people with depressive symptoms spend significantly more hours in a
day, watching TV and using computer (de Wit et al., 2011).
Most of the studies have focused towards the relation of physical
activity with mental health. The role of physical activity in mental
health is well established in several studies and it is proven that phy-
sically active individuals are less likely to suffer from depressive
symptoms (Hamer et al., 2010). However, there are a limited number of
studies done to assess screen time (TV watching and computer use) and
depression, controlling major demographic and socio-economic factors.
This study aims to assess the relationship between screen time and

 depression risk among U.S. adults and select the best model to predict
depression.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study design and sample
This is a cross-sectional study, done using the 2011–2012 cycle of
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data
(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). NHANES is a cross-
sectional survey, representing the no institutionalized civilian resident
population of the United States. Individuals who were 20 years or more
were included in this study (Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
2014). Participants who did not respond to the depression screener
questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were excluded from the
study (Loprinzi and Cardinal, 2012). Similarly, those who did not have
complete data for demographic information and TV watching/com-
puter use were also excluded. A total of 3201 adults from the United
States were included in this study (Loprinzi and Cardinal, 2012).
2.2. Diagnosis and classification of depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were determined based on participant's re-
sponses to the PHQ-9 questionnaire in the NHANES 2011–2012 cycle.
PHQ-9 is the 9-item self-report depression scale that asks questions
about the frequency of symptoms of depression over the past 2 weeks
(Kroenke et al., 2001; Moschos et al., 2016). Each item can be scored
from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) (Kroenke et al., 2001). The
PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27 and thus, classified in two cate-
gories. Individual having PHQ-score < 9 were classified as “no or mild
depression” and those with PHQ-score of 10 or more, were classified as
“moderate to severe depression” (Rethorst et al., 2014; Wittayanukorn
et al., 2014).
2.3. Screen time
Self-reported total hours per day spent on watching TV and use of
computer, was calculated based on the responses on two questions: 1).
“Over the past 30 days, on average how many hours per day did you sit
and watch TV or video”, 2). “Over the past 30 days, on average how
many hours per day did you use a computer or play computer games
outside of work or school”. “Average number of hours per day watching
TV or video” and “average number of hours per day using computer or
playing computer games outside of work” were summed and called as
“screen time”. Participants screen time was classified into two cate-
gories (Breland et al., 2013; Grontved et al., 2015). Those with > 4 h
per day of screen time are categorized as high screen time and those
with < 4 h per day of screen time are categorized as low screen time
(Duncan et al., 2012; Shiue, 2015).
2.4. Body mass index (BMI)
Self-reported body weight and height of participants were used to
determine Body Mass Index (BMI) and classified into 4 categories: 1)
Underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), 2) Normal weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2),
3) Overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2) and 4) Obese (> 30 kg/m2) (Duncan
et al., 2012).
2.5. Covariates
Based on existing literatures on screen time and depression; age,
gender, sex, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black,
Hispanic and Other race) and education were included in this study as
confounding variables (Gardner et al., 2014; Owens et al., 2014;
Weaver et al., 2015). Education was categorized into 2 levels: 1) Less
than high school/general education development (GED) and 2) High
school graduate/GED or equivalent or more. Similarly, age was cate-
gorized into four groups: 1) 20 to 35 years, 2) 36 to 50 years, 3) 51 to
65 years, and 4) > 65 years. Since depression is more common in adult
group (≥20 years), participants who were < 20 years were excluded
for this study.
Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined based on income to
poverty ratio, which was obtained from NHANES data set. Income-to-
poverty ratios represent the ratio of family or unrelated individual in-
come to their appropriate poverty threshold (Loprinzi et al., 2013). In
this study, a ratio below 1.00 was categorized as below poverty
threshold, while a ratio 1.00 or greater was categorized as income
above the poverty threshold.
2.6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed in SAS®9.4 software (SAS
Institute Inc., 2013). Frequency and percentage of study variables were
calculated. In order to observe the relationship between dependent
(depression level) and independent variables (screen time including
age, sex, gender, race, poverty level, education level) univariate and
multivariate modeling were used.
All potential covariates were identified a priori, and a backward
elimination (p < 0.05 for variable retention in model) procedure was
performed, which removed the interaction term (BMI*screen time) and
age category in step 1. Multiple logistic regression models were used to
examine the associations between screen time and depression level
adjusting potential confounders. Four different models were developed
between screen time and depression. Model 1 was adjusted for all po-
tential confounders: age, education, race, gender, BMI, and poverty,
Model 2 was adjusted for race, gender, BMI, and poverty, and Model 3
was adjusted for gender, education, BMI, and poverty. Finally, Model 4
was adjusted for minimal set of covariates including: gender, education
and poverty. Model 4 was selected to assess and predict the relationship
between screen time and depression.
The model fit (covariate p-values) was tested using manual back-
ward elimination regression methods, where all potentially con-
founding covariates were removed one at a time by analyzing the model
fit criteria. Covariates with p-value > 0.05 were removed one by one
when value of Akaike Information Criteria (Tomaic et al., 2013) and
Schwarz Criterion (SC) was significantly smaller than the values as
compared to the previous model. This procedure was repeated until the
most parsimonious regression model was reached. Furthermore, the
likelihood-ratio statistic was performed, ΔG2 = (−2 log L from re-
duced model) − (−2 log L from current model). Smaller value of ΔG2
(−2 Log L) of the model with p > 0.005, which shows the insignif-
icant result against the full model was also used as criteria for model
selection.
Interaction between BMI and screen time was included in the sa-
turated model; however, it was not significant. Thus, interaction term
was deleted from the backward elimination. Statistical significance was
set at p < 0.05 for the main effects and for the interaction term.
3. Results
The results of this study are based on the responses of 3201 US
adults who participated in NHANES 2011–2012. Descriptive analyses of
main exposure and study co-variates were performed.
3.1. Demographic characteristics of study population
The frequency and percentage of main exposure of interest i.e.
screen time and co-variates by outcome status are presented in Table 1.
Of the total respondents male and female participants were equally
distributed gender wise. Majority of respondents were non-Hispanic
white (42.17%), whereas Hispanic respondents were accounted for
14.50% of total respondents. About 87% of respondent had completed

Preventive Medicine Reports 8 (2017) 67–71
68
 at least high school/GED and majority (34.5%) of them were between
20 and 35 years old. Based on the self-reported height and weight of the
study participants, it was found that about 64.38% of total population
was overweight or obese.
About 8% of total study participants had moderate or severe de-
pression (PHQ-9 score ≥10). Significantly higher proportion of women
had experienced moderate or severe depression. Similarly, the pro-
portion of moderate or severe depression was also higher in Non-
Hispanic white and among those who spent > 4 h per day in watching
TV and use computer outside of work or school.
3.2. Association between screen time and depression: univariate analyses
The purpose of this study was to assess whether there is an asso-
ciation between screen time and depression in people who spent > 4 h
of screen time. To test that we conducted univariate analysis between
screen time and depression in people spending > 4 h of screen time.
The univariate analyses between screen time and depression indicated
that individuals, who spent > 4 h per day in watching TV and using
computer, are more likely to be diagnosed with moderate or severe
depression than those who spent < 4 h per day in watching TV and
using computer (Table 2). It was observed that the odds ratio of de-
veloping moderate or severe depression among people who spent 4 to
6 h in screen (watching TV and using computers) was 1.798 (95%
CI = 1.34–1.572); whereas the odds ratio of developing moderate or
severe depression among people who spent > 6 h/day was 2.250 (95%
CI: 1.572–3.221).
From the univariate logistic regression analyses, it was found that
people who were > 65 years old, were at reduced risk of developing
moderate
and
severe
depression
(OR = 0.600
CI = 0.374–0.963,
p > 0.0001) than those, who are 20 to 35 years old (Table 2). Simi-
larly, non-Hispanic Asians have lower odds of developing symptoms of
depression than those who are non-Hispanic white (OR = 0.478
CI = 0.312–0.734, p > 0.0001). The odds ratio of developing de-
pression among female was 1.983 (CI = 1.518–2.590, p > 0.0001). It
was also observed that people who were at below poverty threshold had
higher odds of developing moderate or severe depression (OR = 2.250
CI = 1.57–3.221, p > 0.0001).
3.3. Association between screen time and depression: multivariate adjusted
model
Adjusted model was performed to observe the association between
the screen time and depression by keeping all other study variables
constant (Table 3). Like in univariate logistic regression model, screen
time was found to be significantly associated with depression in ad-
justed model (adjusted for all potential confounder), OR = 1.943
(1.415–2.669, p < 0.0001) among those who spent 4–6 h in screen

among
those

spent > 6 h/day in screen. The interaction term of BMI and screen time
in the adjusted model was found to be insignificant. Adjusting age,
gender race, BMI, and poverty level there was lower odds of depression
symptoms among people other than non-Hispanic white.
The adjusted OR (adjusted for race, gender, education, BMI, and
socioeconomic status) of developing depression among people 36 to
50 years of age was 1.234 (CI: 0.867–1.757, p = 0.2432), 1.110 (CI:
0.767–1.607, p = 0.5807), and 0.538 (CI: 0.318–0.910, p = 0.0209)
among 51–65 years and > 65 years age group respectively. The ad-
justed odds ratio among people with less than high school/GED of
educational
qualification
was
1.970
(95%
CI:
1.382–2.807,
p = 0.0002). Unlike the univariate model, the adjusted model indicated
that underweight and overweight were not significantly associated with
depressions. Among underweight people the odds ratio was 1.50 (95%
CI: 0.501–4.504, p = 0.4675), whereas the odds ratio was 1.343 (95%
CI: 0.912–1.97,
p = 0.1352)
among
those who are
overweight.
However, obese people were found to be significantly associated with
depression OR = 1.920 (95% CI: 1.337–2.756, p = 0.0004).
3.4. Model selection
After using backward elimination procedure for best model selec-
tion; gender, education, poverty level and screen time, were found to be
significantly associated with depression level at the significance level of
0.05 (Table 4). All other variables from the full model were removed in
the final reduced model. In the final model, the odds ratio of developing
depression was 1.958 (95% CI = 1.433–2.677, p < 0.0001) among
those who spent 4–6 h/day on screen and the odds of developing de-
pression were 2.348 (95% CI = 1.602–3.442, p < 0.0001) among
those who spent > 6 h/day. Higher odds of developing depression
among female than male: 2.055 (CI = 1.547–2.729, p < 0.0001) was
observed in the final model. The OR among people with less than high
school education was 1.982 (CI = 1.547–2.729, p < 0.0001). Simi-
larly, people who are living below the poverty threshold have higher
OR of developing depression: 2.456 (95% CI: 1.844–3.272, < 0.0001).
4. Discussion
In this large population based cross-sectional study of US adult
population, it was found that there was significant association between
the TV watching/computer uses with moderate or severe level of de-
pression after controlling all potential confounders. There were higher
odds of developing depressive symptoms among people who spend >
6 h per day in TV watching and computer use. Like the results of
previous study on depression, this study also found that, female were at
higher risk of developing depression along with less educated and
people below poverty level (Lepine and Briley, 2011). The higher odds
of developing depression among female was may be due to the preg-
nancy related anxiety. Several studies conducted in pregnancy and
maternal depression has found that pregnancy reduces the physical
activity and that leads towards the depression. During the period of
depression, women are more likely to stay at home and spend max-
imum amount of time watching TV and using computer (Nordhagen
and Sundgot-Borgen, 2002; Padmapriya et al., 2016; Tendais et al.,
2011). The findings of this study are consisted with study conducted by
Hamer et al. which indicates that spending > 4 h/day in watching TV
and using computer, leads to moderate to severe level of depression
(Hamer et al., 2010; Maras et al., 2015). Similarly, the results of this
study are in accordance with previous studies on sedentary behavior
and mental disorders that found the significant association (Primack
et al., 2009).
There is a lack of research assessing the relationships between
specific types of screen behavior and depression level among adults.
The role of screen time in depression in individual varies with type of
screen behavior and duration. In contrast to the findings of this study,
the study conducted by Maras et al. on screen time and depression,
found the insignificant association between TV watching and depres-
sion level. This discrepant in findings could be due to methodological
differences in study and study co-variates. Study conducted on BMI and
depression found that BMI was significantly associated with severity of
depression (Opel et al., 2015). However, BMI was not significantly as-
sociated in this study. Another study found that people who spend more
time in front of electronic screens have more sleeping problems which
could compromise their ability to cope with stress, resulting in in-
creased feelings of depression or anxiety study (Nelson and Gordon-
Larsen, 2006; Van den Bulck, 2004).
This is a cross-sectional study and secondary data was used. Since
cross-sectional study observes the situation at a given time period,
causal relationship cannot be established between the exposure and
outcome variable. The data on exposure variables were self-reported by
the study participants that may introduce recall bias in the study.
Furthermore, the data does not tell about the history of depression and
medication, which may again influence the result. Some of the im-
portant variables such as physical activity, stress coping strategies and
sleep duration were not analyzed in this study, which could have sig-
nificant effect in predicting the outcome variable.
In summary, after controlling for all covariates, screen time (TV
watching and computer using outside work or school) was associated
with moderate or severe depression among US adults. The findings of
this study suggest that duration of screen time was significantly asso-
ciated when all covariates were adjusted, however, only gender, edu-
cation, poverty levels were picked in the final model to predict the
depression level. The finding of this study suggests that screen time is a
significant risk factor or a marker of mental disorders among US adults.
Since, mental health is predicted to be leading cause of disease burden
by 2030; the intervention should be targeted towards the prevention of
these kinds of risk factors. The finding from this study could inform
individuals and policy makers to reduce the time limit of screen time.
Further prospective studies measuring all other important risk fac-
tors associated with depression such as: work place sitting, social re-
lationship, and family history of depression are warranted to confirm
causal pathways and to examine whether these common sedentary
behaviors are associated to poorer mental health outcomes.
