Background
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that heat a liquid into an aerosol for inhalation. The liquid usually comprises propylene
glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, and stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir. Since ECs
appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some
healthcare organizations, tobacco control advocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to
ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices
can help smokers quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review is an update of a review first published in 2014.
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and effect of using ECs to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group’s Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records from 2004 to January 2016, together with reference checking and
contact with study authors.
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to
EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also
included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials, RCTs and cohort
follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events (AEs).
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking
after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest
follow-up). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each
study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses.

 Main results
Our searches identified over 1700 records, from which we include 24 completed studies (three RCTs, two of which were eligible for
our cessation meta-analysis, and 21 cohort studies). Eleven of these studies are new for this version of the review. We identified 27
ongoing studies. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One
trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low
nicotine content and poor battery life. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system we rated the overall
quality of the evidence for our outcomes as ‘low’ or ‘very low’, because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A ‘low’ grade
means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change
the estimate. A ‘very low’ grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have
abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo
4% versus EC 9%; 2 studies; 662 participants. GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant
difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95%
CI 0.68 to 2.34; 584 participants. GRADE: very low).
Of the includedstudies,none reportedseriousadverse eventsconsideredrelatedtoECuse.The mostfrequentlyreportedAEswere mouth
and throat irritation, most commonly dissipating over time. One RCT provided data on the proportion of participants experiencing
any adverse events. The proportion of participants in the study arms experiencing adverse events was similar (ECs vs placebo EC: RR
0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34 (298 participants); ECs vs patch: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22 (456 participants)). The second RCT
reported no statistically significant difference in the frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the EC and placebo EC
groups, and showed that in all groups the frequency of AEs (with the exception of throat irritation) decreased significantly over time.
Authors’ conclusions
There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo ECs. However, the
small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is
rated ’low’ by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial
is uncertain for similar reasons. None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years) detected serious adverse events
considered possibly related to EC use. The most commonly reported adverse effects were irritation of the mouth and throat. The long-
term safety of ECs is unknown. In this update, we found a further 15 ongoing RCTs which appear eligible for this review.

Can electronic cigarettes help people stop smoking, and are they safe to use for this purpose?
Background
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that produce an aerosol (commonly referred to as vapour) that the user inhales. This
vapour typically contains nicotine without most of the toxins smokers inhale with cigarette smoke. ECs have become popular with
smokers who want to reduce the risks of smoking. This review aimed to find out whether ECs help smokers stop smoking, and whether
it is safe to use ECs to do this.
Study characteristics
This is an update of a previous review. The first review was published in 2014 and included 13 studies. For this update, we searched
for studies published up to January 2016 and found 11 new studies. Only two of the included studies are randomized controlled trials
and followed participants for at least six months. These provide the best evidence. The remaining 22 studies either did not follow
participants for very long or did not put people into treatment groups so could not directly compare ECs with something else. These
studies can tell us less about how ECs might help with quitting smoking but can tell us about short-term safety. The two randomized
trials, conducted in New Zealand and Italy, compared ECs with and without nicotine. We judged these studies to be at low risk of bias.
In one study, people wanted to quit smoking, while in the other study they did not. The trial in people who wanted to quit smoking
also compared ECs to nicotine patches.
Key results
Combined results from two studies, involving 662 people, showed that using an EC containing nicotine increased the chances of
stopping smoking in the long term compared to using an EC without nicotine. We could not determine if EC was better than a nicotine

 patch in helping people stop smoking, because the number of participants in the study was low. More studies are needed to evaluate
this effect. The other studies were of lower quality, but they supported these findings. None of the studies found that smokers who
used EC short- to mid-term (for two years or less) had an increased health risk compared to smokers who did not use ECs.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence overall is low because it is based on only a small number of studies, although these studies were well
conducted. More studies of ECs are needed. Some are already underway.

Throughout this review, we discuss two types of cigarettes: elec-
tronic and conventional tobacco cigarettes. To avoid confusion,
all mention of smoking, smoking cessation, cigarette use, smoke
intake, etc., concern conventional cigarettes. When the text con-
cerns electronic cigarettes we use the abbreviation ’ECs’. EC users
are sometimes described as vapers, and EC use as vaping. We refer
to ECs that do not contain nicotine as placebo ECs.
Description of the condition
Stopping smoking is associated with large health benefits. Despite
most smokers wanting to quit, many find it difficult to succeed in
the long term. Almost half who try to quit without support will
not manage to stop for even a week, and fewer than five per cent
remain abstinent at one year after quitting (Hughes 2004).
Behavioural support and medications such as nicotine patches or
gum increase the chances of quitting, but even with this additional
support long-term quit rates remain low (Cahill 2016; Hughes
2014; Lancaster 2005; Stead 2005; Stead 2006; Stead 2012). One
of the limitations of current treatments is that none adequately
addresses the sensory and behavioural aspects of smoking that
smokers miss when they stop smoking (e.g. holding a cigarette in
their hands, taking a puff, enjoyment of smoking, etc.). ECs may
offer a way to overcome this limitation.
There is no doubt that people become dependent on tobacco, and
find it difficult to stop smoking, primarily because of nicotine and
its actions on the brain’s reward system (Balfour 2004). However,
other factors also contribute to tobacco dependence (Rose 2006).
Sensory and behavioural cues provide additional reinforcement of
smoking behaviour (Rose 1993; Rose 2000) and over time be-
come almost as rewarding as nicotine. There are several lines of
evidence to support this. Firstly, smokers appear to have a pref-
erence for cigarette smoke compared to other forms of nicotine
delivery. This is partly related to its speed of nicotine delivery.
However, even when nicotine is administered intravenously it does
not provide the same level of satisfaction or reward as smoking
(Rose 2000; Westman 1996). Secondly, the local sensory effects
of smoking (e.g. the ‘scratch’ in the back of the throat) may be
important for enjoyment and reward. Numbing the sensations of
cigarette smoke by anaesthetizing the upper and lower respiratory
tract leads to less enjoyment of smoking (Rose 1985). Conversely,
products that mimic the sensory effects of smoking on the mouth
and throat (such as citric acid, black pepper, and ascorbic acid)
reduce craving and some withdrawal symptoms, at least in the
short term (Levin 1993; Rose 1994; Westman 1995). Thirdly,
de-nicotinized cigarettes (DNCs), which have a very low content
of nicotine (e.g. 0.08 mg instead of the normal 1 mg) and so have
negligible or no central effects, have also been investigated for
their role in aiding smoking cessation (Przulj 2013). Despite not
delivering nicotine, DNCs are satisfying over the initial few days
of abstinence from nicotine (Donny 2007; Pickworth 1999; Rose
2000). They also reduce tobacco withdrawal symptoms, includ-
ing urges to smoke and low mood (Barrett 2010; Donny 2009;
McRobbie 2016; Perkins 2010; Rose 2000), and have been shown
to improve long-term continuous abstinence rates in one study
(Walker 2012).
Considering the other factors that contribute to tobacco depen-
dence, there is interest in developing smoking cessation products
that would not only help relieve the unpleasant effects of nico-
tine withdrawal but would also act as an effective substitute for
smoking behaviour and the rituals and sensations that accompany
smoking, without the health risks associated with the inhalation of
tobacco smoke. The only pharmaceutical treatment available that
has some of these characteristics is the nicotine inhalator. How-
ever, the inhalator does not have greater cessation efficacy than the
other nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products (Hajek 1999;
Stead 2012). This may in part be due to the considerable effort
(e.g. 20 minutes of continuous puffing) needed to provide nico-
tine blood concentrations consistent with other NRTs (Schneider
2001). Adherence to correct use of the inhalator is low compared
to other NRTs (Hajek 1999). It is therefore possible that any ad-
vantage of sensorimotor replacement is diminished by low nico-
tine delivery and limited similarities between inhalator use and
sensations of smoking (Bullen 2010).
Description of the intervention
ECs are electronic vaporizing devices that have in common the
ability to heat a liquid, usually comprising propylene glycol and
glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, and stored in dis-
posable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir, into an aerosol for
inhalation. The commonly-used term for this aerosol is vapour,
which we use throughout the review. ECs are currently being pro-
moted by retailers to use instead of cigarettes when in smoke-free
environments, and to replace conventional cigarettes with a safer
alternative.
ECs provide sensations similar to smoking a cigarette. They pro-
vide taste and throat sensations that are closer to smoking than
those provided by the nicotine inhalator (Barbeau 2013). The
vapour that looks like tobacco smoke is only visible when the user
exhales after drawing on the mouthpiece, not when the device is
being held.
There are hundreds of different brands and models of EC avail-
able. There is also wide variation in the composition of the fluid
in the cartridge or in the EC reservoir (nicotine content, flavours
and other components) (Goniewicz 2012; Goniewicz 2014). This
makes a blanket assessment of cessation efficacy difficult. Con-
clusions should relate to the particular type of EC tested and the
composition of the liquid being aerosolized.
Initial studies showed that the brands of EC tested delivered very
low amounts of nicotine to naïve users (Bullen 2010; Eissenberg
2010; Vansickel 2010). However, the studies suggested that even
6

 in the absence of good nicotine delivery, these brands of EC could
alleviate urges to smoke. One study allowed a comparison of EC
andinhalator, although itsmainobjective wasa comparisonof ECs
with and without nicotine. Puffing for 20 minutes on the inhalator
and puffing for five minutes on the EC had similar effects on desire
to smoke after overnight abstinence (Bullen 2010). Later studies
thathave measurednicotine pharmacokineticsinboth experienced
(Vansickel 2013) and naïve (Vansickel 2012) EC users have found
that some EC users can achieve blood nicotine levels similar to
those achieved with smoking, albeit more slowly, and that their
ability to do so often improves over time (Hajek 2015b).
At the time of writing, the most popular types of EC include ’ci-
galike’ products that look like cigarettes and are easier to operate
(they are disposable or use cartridges that are just screwed on) and
’tank’ products that include a larger battery and a transparent con-
tainer that users fill with an e-liquid of their choice. The tank ECs
provide better nicotine delivery, allow a wider choice of flavours
and nicotine concentrations, and are typically used by experienced
vapers who managed to switch to vaping altogether (ASH 2016;
Dawkins 2013b; Farsalinos 2014; McNeill 2015). Observational
evidence suggests smokers are more likely to successfully quit us-
ing tank models than with cigalikes, perhaps because of improved
nicotine delivery in these models (Chen 2016; Hitchman 2015).
EC types are also often grouped by ’generation’: first-generation
devices are typically cigalikes; second-generation devices are usu-
ally tank models; and third-generation devices are tank models
which, unlike second generation devices, allow users to adjust the
voltage level of the product (see NCSCT EC briefing for further
information and images of different product types).
Throughout this review we refer to a nicotine-containing EC as
‘nicotine EC’ and to a nicotine-free EC as ‘placebo EC’. The
’placebo’ comparison is a test just of the nicotine effect and not of
the potential sensorimotor replacement that the EC may provide.
Why it is important to do this review
Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady
growth in sales, with some commentators reporting that ECs are a
threat to the sales of cigarettes (Herzog 2013). This growth in sales
is reflected in population survey data from high-income countries
that show an increased awareness and use of ECs over time (ASH
2016; Agaku 2014; Ayers 2011; Gallus 2014; West 2016). Data
from lower-income countries also suggest high levels of EC use
and awareness (Jiang 2016; Palipudi 2016). ECs are used almost
exclusively by smokers or ex-smokers (ASH 2016; Douptcheva
2013; West 2016). A small proportion of never-smokers have re-
ported trying or experimenting with ECs but they do not seem
to progress to daily or even regular use (ASH 2016; CDC 2013;
West 2016). Of smokers who try ECs, fewer than 15% become
daily users (Douptcheva 2013; Kralikova 2012), which suggests
that ECs are still not an entirely satisfying replacement for smok-
ing.
Regulatory approaches being used for ECs currently vary widely,
from no regulation to complete bans in countries including Sin-
gapore and Brazil. The US Food and Drug Administration has
classified them as tobacco products and is preparing to implement
a regulation that will restrict their sale and use (FDA 2016). The
European Union has included ECs in their Tobacco Products Di-
rective, except where therapeutic claims are made or in instances
where they contain over 20 mg/nl of nicotine, when they will re-
quire medicines authorization (European Parliament 2014).There
is now general agreement that EC use exposes the user to fewer
toxicants than smoking tobacco cigarettes (McNeill 2015; RCP
2016). However, those calling for ECs to be stringently regu-
lated (e.g. Grana 2014a; McKee 2016; WHO 2014) cite the lack
of quality control measures, possible harms of second-hand EC
vapour inhalation, concerns that the products may be a gateway to
smoking initiation, concerns that ECs may undermine smoke-free
legislation if used in smoke-free spaces, and concerns regarding
the involvement of the tobacco industry. However, other reviews
of available data do not support these concerns or suggest that po-
tential benefits outweigh potential disadvantages (Farsalinos 2014;
Hajek 2014; McNeill 2015; RCP 2016).
Regarding safety, categorical statements about the toxicity of ECs
are not possible because of the large number of devices and fluids
available and the frequent addition of new products to the market.
However, amongthose brandsof ECthathave beentested, levelsof
toxins have been found to be substantially lower than in cigarettes,
and are present at levels that are unlikely to represent a significant
risk to health to either the user or to bystanders (Hajek 2014;
McNeill 2015). Short- to medium-term use of ECs is associated
with few adverse events (Bullen 2013; Caponnetto 2013a). Long-
term effects beyond 12 months are unknown, although based on
what is known about liquid and vapour constituents and patterns
of use, a recent report from the UK’s Royal College of Physicians
has concluded that using an EC is likely to be considerably safer
than smoking (RCP 2016).
Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to
know if these devices can help smokers quit and if it is safe to use
them to do so. In particular, healthcare providers have an urgent
need to know what advice they should give to people who smoke.
The largest health gains are achieved from stopping smoking com-
pletely, as opposed to reducing cigarette consumption, and as such
this review focuses on the effectiveness of ECs in aiding smoking
cessation. There is also an opportunity to investigate if the EC
has potential to aid reduction in cigarette consumption in those
smokers who cannot or do not want to stop smoking altogether;
this was covered in the previous version of this review (McRobbie
2014), but is now covered in a separate review (Stead 2007, update
forthcoming).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which smokers are ran-
domized to ECs or to a control condition, and which measure
abstinence rates at six months or longer, to determine the efficacy
of ECs in aiding smoking cessation and reduction. We anticipated
that the search would return few RCTs and so we also consid-
ered the results from cohort follow-up studies with six months’ or
longer follow-up. In this and the previous version of the review, we
include those observational cohort studies which survey existing
smokers at baseline, some of whom are already dual users of EC
and cigarettes. As discussed in further detail below, these studies
are heavily confounded due to the nature of their design. In antic-
ipation of further high-quality studies becoming available, we will
exclude this study design for efficacy outcomes in the next update
of this review, and will only include those observational studies
where an intervention has been provided.
For adverse events and biomarkers, we included randomized cross-
over trials and cohort follow-up studies with follow-up of greater
than a week.
We included studies regardless of their publication status or lan-
guage of publication.
Types of participants
People defined as current smokers at enrolment into the studies.
Participants can be motivated or unmotivated to quit.
Types of interventions
We compare ECs with placebo ECs, ECs versus alternative smok-
ing cessation aids, including NRT or no intervention, and ECs
added to standard smoking cessation treatment (behavioural or
pharmacological or both) with standard treatment alone. As rel-
atively few controlled trials are currently available (some are un-
derway), we also include uncontrolled studies which evaluate ECs
(see Types of studies).
Types of outcome measures
Cessation at the longest follow-up point, which was at least six
months from the start of the intervention, measured on an in-
tention-to-treat basis using the strictest definition of abstinence,
preferring biochemically-validated results where reported. We col-
lected any data on adverse events at one week or longer, serious
and non-serious, from the included studies, including changes in
relevant biomarkers.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases in January 2016:
• Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 1)
• MEDLINE (OVID SP) (2004 to 2016 January week 2, &
MEDLINE in process/In data review Feb 1 2016)
• Embase (OVID SP) (2004 to 2016 week 5)
• PsycINFO (OVID SP) (2004 to 2016 January week 4)
For the first version of the review we also searched CINAHL (EB-
SCO Host) (2004 to July 2014). We did not search this database
for this review update as it did not contribute additional search
results to the first version of the review.
The search terms were broad and included e-cig$ OR elect$ cigar$
OR electronic nicotine. The search for the 2016 update added the
terms vape or vaper or vapers or vaping. The search strategy for
MEDLINE (Ovid SP) is shown in Appendix 1.
The search date parameters are limited to 2004 to the present, due
to the fact that ECs were not available before 2004.
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of studies found in the litera-
ture search and the metaRegister of controlled trials database (
www.isrctn.com/page/mrct). We also contacted authors of known
trials and other published EC studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (from JHB, HM, LS or RB) independently
prescreened all titles and abstracts obtained from the search, using
a screening checklist. Where there was disagreement, we obtained
the full-text version and resolved the disagreement by discussion
or by referral to a third review author (PH).
Two review authors (from JHB, HM and RB) obtained and in-
dependently screened full-text versions of the potentially relevant
papers for inclusion. We resolved any disagreements by discussion
or with a third review author (PH).

 Data extraction and management
Two review authors (from JHB, HM or LS) extracted data from
the included studies, and checked them against each other. A third
review author (PH) was available to review and resolve any dis-
crepancies. We extracted data on:
• Author
• Date and place of publication
• Study design
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria
• Setting
• Summary of study participant characteristics
• Summary of intervention and control conditions
• Number of participants in each arm
• Smoking cessation outcomes
• Type of biochemical validation (if any)
• Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and
relevant biomarkers
• Assessment time points
• Risk of bias in the domains specified below
• Additional comments
We adopted a broad focus to detect a variety of adverse events.
One review author then entered the data into Review Manager 5
software for analyses, and another checked them.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (JHB and HM or LS) independently assessed
the risk of bias for each included study, following the approach
recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011). This approach uses a domain-based
evaluation that addresses seven different areas: random sequence
generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and
providers; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome
data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of
bias. We assigned a grade (low, high, or unclear) for risk of bias
for each domain. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by
consulting a third author (PH).
Measures of treatment effect
We analyzed dichotomous data by calculating the risk ratio (RR),
using the longest follow-up data reported. For cessation, we cal-
culated the RR as ((number of events in intervention condition/
intervention denominator) / (number of events in control condi-
tion/control denominator)) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
We analyzed continuous data (other measures of tobacco expo-
sure) by comparing the difference between the mean change from
baseline to the longest follow-up point in the intervention and
control groups.
Unit of analysis issues
We extracted data on smoking outcomes only from RCTs in which
individuals were the unit of randomization. In the case of trials
with multiple arms, we combined all relevant experimental inter-
vention groups of the study into a single group, and combined all
relevant control intervention groups into a single control group.
We offer a narrative synthesis of data from cohort studies.
Dealing with missing data
For smoking cessation, we used a conservative approach as is stan-
dard for the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, treating partic-
ipants with missing data as still smoking. We based the propor-
tion of people affected by adverse events on the number of people
available for follow-up, and not the number randomized.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed the clinical and methodological diversity between
studies to guide our decision as to whether data should be pooled.
We were also guided by the degree of statistical heterogeneity, as-
sessed by calculating the I² statistic (Higgins 2003); we considered
a value greater than 50% as evidence of substantial heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Reporting bias is best assessed using funnel plots, where 10 or
more RCTscontribute toanoutcome.However, there are currently
insufficient studies to support this approach.
Data synthesis
We provide a narrative summary of the included studies. Where
appropriate, we have pooled data from these studies in meta-analy-
ses. For dichotomous data, we used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel
model to calculate the risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval,
in accord with the standard methods of the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group for cessation studies.
We hadplannedtocalculate the summaryestimatesforcontinuous
outcomes (e.g. biomarkers of tobacco exposure) using the inverse
variance approach (also with a 95% CI). However, there were
insufficient data with which to do so.
For adverse events, we originally planned to enter the most com-
monly-reported adverse events into meta-analyses to determine if
there were any significant differences between the EC and control
groups. We also originally planned to include data from cross-over
trials in a meta-analysis using paired data obtained from reports.
However, there were again insufficient data with which to do so,
and hence we have summarized adverse event data narratively.

 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We had planned to undertake subgroup analyses to investigate
differences between studies, such as:
• Intensity of behavioural support used;
• Type of control group (e.g. placebo EC, NRT);
• Type of participants (e.g. experience of EC use).
However, there were too few studies to conduct such analyses.
Should further studies become available in future, we will follow
this approach.
Sensitivity analysis
We hadplannedtoundertake sensitivityanalysestoassessthe effect
of removing studies judged to be at high risk of bias. However,
there were too few studies to conduct such analyses. Should further
studies become available in subsequent updates, we will adopt this
approach.
Summary of findings table
Following standard Cochrane methodology, we created a ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table for both outcomes. For cessation, the ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table only includes data from randomized con-
trolled trials. Also following standard Cochrane methodology, we
used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consis-
tency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to
assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome, and
to draw conclusions about the quality of evidence within the text
of the review.

Description of studies
Results of the search
Our bibliographic database searches identified 1704 non-dupli-
cate records. We found a further six records through screening ref-
erences in the papers identified through electronic searches, and
one further record through author contact. We screened all records
and retrieved the full-text papers of 117 potentially relevant stud-
ies. After screening and checking the full text of 117 papers, we
identified 24 eligible completed studies (11 of which were new for
this update) and eight ongoing studies. Searches of trials registers
for this update identified a further 19 potentially relevant ongo-
ing studies, making a total of 27 ongoing studies (Characteristics
of ongoing studies). We excluded 46 studies after checking full-
text papers (Excluded studies). Secondary study reports, commen-
taries, and correspondence relating to included studies are linked
to studies in the reference section. Figure 1 and Figure 2 present
PRISMA flow charts for the update and the original review, re-
spectively.

 The completed studies include three RCTs and 21 prospective co-
hort studies that describe abstinence at six months or longer or
adverse events (AEs), or both. In one of the included studies (Choi
2014), the data come from the authors’ response to a criticism of
their paper; the data had not been included in the original study
report. One retrospective cohort study (Polosa 2014a) provided
data on changes in respiratory parameters and symptoms in people
with asthma that were using ECs. Although this used a retrospec-
tive design it used data from different time points and used rou-
tine clinical records that we deemed adequate for capturing data
concerning adverse events.
In this update, we also collected information on systematic reviews
(defined as having run a systematic search of at least one database)
published within the update search period. Appendix 2 lists key
features of the 14 reviews which met these criteria; we discuss these
further in Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews.
Included studies
The key features of the included studies are summarized by study
type below. Further details on each included study can be found
in the Characteristics of included studies tables.
Randomized controlled trials
We identified only two completed randomized controlled trials
(Bullen 2013; Caponnetto 2013a) which contribute data on ces-
sation at six months or longer.
The ASCEND trial (Bullen 2013) randomized 657 smokers (mid-
dle-aged, highly dependent, with one-third being of New Zealand
Maori origin) who wanted to quit to use either an Elusion brand
EC (first-generation technology) with cartridges containing 16 mg
nicotine, or 21 mg/24-hour nicotine patches, or an EC with car-
tridges without nicotine (placebo EC), for 12 weeks following a
target quit date (TQD). The ECs were couriered to participants,
and those allocated to the patch arm were mailed a voucher to
exchange for NRT at a pharmacy, which is standard practice in
New Zealand, but also received a voucher to cover the dispensing
costs. All participants received an invitation to access phone- or
text-based support, although this was accessed by fewer than 10%.
The EC used in this study delivered only low levels of nicotine.
This was determined in a subsample of four participants, who had
used the EC for at least one week, volunteered to give a baseline
blood sample, and then use their EC, taking one puff every minute
over 10 minutes. They then provided five further blood samples at
approximately 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes after the start of EC use.
Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that plasma nicotine concentra-
tions peaked (a median increase of 2.1 ng/ml from baseline) at 10
minutes after the start of EC use. Participants were followed up at
six months post-TQD and self-reported abstinence was validated
by carbon monoxide (CO) in expired breath, in line with the Rus-
sell Standard (West 2005). Participants who were still smoking at
follow-up were asked to report their daily cigarette consumption,
and a change from baseline consumption was measured.
In the three-arm ECLAT trial (Caponnetto 2013a), 300 smok-
ers (again middle-aged and highly dependent), who were not in-
tending to quit smoking in the next 30 days, were randomized to
use a ’Categoria’ brand EC (model 401, which is no longer pro-
duced) with disposable cartridges containing 7.2 mg nicotine or 0
mg nicotine (placebo EC) for 12 weeks. The third arm used car-
tridges containing 7.2 mg nicotine for six weeks followed by 5.2
mg nicotine for another six weeks. The EC was presented simply as
a healthier alternative to tobacco smoke, and could be freely used
ad libitum (up to four cartridges per day) as a tobacco substitute.
Participants were seen on eight occasions over 12 months, once
at baseline and at seven follow-up visits where they received more
cartridges, handed in smoking diaries, and had CO and vital signs
measured. Abstinence at 12 months was defined as complete self-
reported abstinence from tobacco smoking since the previous visit
at six months, confirmed with CO less than 7 parts per million
(ppm) at six and 12 months. Participants who were still smoking at
follow-up were asked to report their daily cigarette consumption,
and a change from baseline consumption was measured.
New for this update is a further randomized controlled trial,
Adriaens 2014. This three-armed trial randomized 51 smokers not
intending to quit in the near future to either the Joyetech e-GO-C
second-generation EC, the Kanger T2-CC second-generation EC,
or to no treatment at baseline. EC groups were provided guidance
on EC use and instructed to use the assigned EC ad libitum. Both
groups were also provided with bottles of tobacco-flavoured e-
liquid containing 18 mg/mL nicotine. At eight weeks, the control
group was given the same EC provisions, but without instructions.
Participants were followed up at three lab sessions over two months
in which biomarkers, mood, adverse events and cessation were
measured, as well as craving, withdrawal, and EC usage. Further
data collection occurred at five and eight months from baseline.
As all groups were provided with nicotine-containing EC by six
months, this study is not included in our meta-analysis of smoking
cessation outcomes and we report results narratively only.
Cohort studies
Six prospective intervention studies (three new for this update)
described abstinence at six months or longer in smokers provided
with ECs and/or instructions on EC use to reduce or stop smok-
ing. Eight further studies (five new for this update) described ab-
stinence in smokers who had tried or used ECs in the past at six
months or longer from baseline (note, we will exclude this group
13

 of studies from the next version of this review, as higher-quality
data become available). Finally, seven studies (two new for this
update) provide information on adverse events only.
Intervention studies
The first of the intervention studies recruited 14 smokers with
schizophrenia from among inpatients at a psychiatric institution
in Italy (Caponnetto 2013b). All had been smoking at least 20
cigarettes a day for at least the past 10 years and were not in-
tending to quit. Participants were seen at baseline and provided
with an EC (’Categoria’ brand) with an initial four-week supply
of 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges. They were instructed to use their
EC ad libitum (up to four cartridges a day), but no instruction
on cessation or reduction was provided. Follow-up was completed
at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months when cigarette consumption, CO,
AEs and positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were
measured. Further EC cartridges were supplied at one, two, and
three months.
Another similarly designed study examined the effects of EC use
over an extended period of time in 40 highly dependent middle-
aged smokers not wanting to quit smoking at any time in the next
30 days, recruited from among staff working in an Italian hospi-
tal (Polosa 2011). At baseline they were given an EC (’Catego-
ria’ brand) with a four-week supply of 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges
and instructed to use ad libitum (up to four cartridges a day). No
instruction on cessation or reduction was provided. Participants
were followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 18 and 24 months, when cigarette
consumption, CO, and AEs were recorded. Additional EC car-
tridges could be requested at months one, two, and three.
The third study (Ely 2013) recruited 48 smokers, who wanted to
quit or switch from cigarettes to ECs, from among 640 patients
of a single family medical practice in Colorado (USA) who were
recorded as current smokers. The intervention was based on the ’5
As’ and the transtheoretical model, and participants were informed
of the range of treatment options at the start of the programme.
They were provided with written information on ’blu cig’ and
’smoke tip’ ECs, regarding cost, availability, and nicotine dosage
options. All participants used an EC, with 16 using bupropion
and two using varenicline as well. Follow-up was undertaken by
telephone at two weeks, one, three and six months after the start
of the intervention. No definition of abstinence was provided, nor
were self-reports biochemically verified.
The fourth study (Pacifici 2015), new for this update, recruited
34 adult smokers who had never received stop-smoking support
and were unmotivated to quit from a hospital-based smoking ces-
sation clinic in Italy. Participants were naïve to EC use at base-
line and were provided with a commercially available EC over a
period of four weeks, starting with a nicotine-free e-liquid before
moving to a personally-tailored nicotine dosage. Participants were
offered a multicomponent medically-assisted training programme
for EC use, and were followed up at one, four and eight months
where cessation, cigarettes per day, adverse events, exhaled CO,
and nicotine concentration were measured.
The fifth study (Polosa 2014b), also new for this update and also
based in a smoking cessation clinic in Italy, recruited 50 smokers
unwilling to quit who had been smoking at least 15 cigarettes a
day at baseline for at least 10 years. Participants were provided
with second-generation ECs with 9 mg/ml nicotine e-liquid, and
instructed to use the products ad libitum. No encouragement to
quit smoking was provided, but participants were supported in
charging, filling, activating and using the EC, with phone numbers
provided for assistance. Thirty-day, biochemically-verified point
prevalence abstinence, adverse events, cigarettes per day, exhaled
CO and data on product usage and opinions of the product were
collected at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks.
The final study (Polosa 2015), also new for this update, recruited
71 adult smokers making their first EC purchase from vape shops
across Catania province in Italy. Participants were not provided
with ECs but, upon purchasing an EC product of their choice,
were instructed on how to set up and use the device and were
given troubleshooting advice and a phone number for technical
support. Participants were encouraged to use the EC in antici-
pation of reducing their daily cigarette consumption. Thirty-day
self-reported point prevalence abstinence, details of product pur-
chase, and cigarettes smoked per day were collected at six and 12
months.
Non-intervention studies
We include three longitudinal web-based surveys in this review.
The first (Etter 2014) followed up smokers and EC users access-
ing websites selling or informing users about ECs and online EC
forums. The survey was open to all nationalities, with 34% of re-
spondents from the USA, 24% from France, 8% from the UK, 6%
from Switzerland, and 28% from other countries. Three hundred
and sixty-seven participants who had completed a baseline ques-
tionnaire also completed a follow-up survey one year later when
they were asked to provide follow-up data on EC use and smok-
ing behaviour. Of these participants, 35 (10%) were occasional or
daily smokers and daily EC users at baseline.
In the second web-based survey, Grana 2014b recruited 949 cur-
rent cigarette smokers (59% smoked within 30 minutes of waking
and 69% never expected to quit or did not intend to quit in the
next six months), who completed surveys at both baseline and one-
year follow-up. At baseline 9% (n = 88) were using ECs (defined
as use in the past 30 days). Self-reported abstinence (not defined)
was measured at one-year follow-up.
In the final web-based survey, Brose 2015 recruited 4064 UK res-
idents who had smoked in the past year, with 1769 followed up at
12 months. Twenty-three per cent of participants were EC users at
baseline, the majority of whom indicated they were using first-gen-
eration ECs. At follow-up, data were collected on quit attempts,
reduction in cigarettes per day, and whether the participant con-

 sidered him- or herself to be an ’ex-smoker.’
Two longitudinal telephone-based surveys are included in this re-
view. In the first (Al-Delaimy 2015), which is new for this update,
California residents (USA) were recruited, who had smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked cigarettes ’at least
some days’ at baseline. At baseline, 83.6% were daily smokers,
236 had used ECs, and 306 indicated they would never use ECs.
Self-reported prolonged abstinence for one month or longer, quit
attempts, and reduction were assessed at 12 months.
In the second study (Choi 2014), authors presented new data from
a prospective cohort study of young adults recruited from Mid-
western states of the USA in a response to a letter criticizing their
main paper, which did not provide data on EC users and smok-
ing outcomes. The letter reports on smoking cessation outcomes
(not defined) in a sample of smokers who used ECs for one or
more days in the last 30 days at baseline (no N given), comparing
these to a sample of baseline smokers who had never used ECs at
baseline. The main paper included 1379 participants (mean age
24) who had never used ECs, 17.8% of whom were reported to
be current smokers.
A final three prospective studiesusedarange of follow-upmethods;
all are new for this update. Borderud 2014 recruited 1074 patients
presenting with cancer at a large US cancer centre who were re-
ferred to and completed intake assessment for the centre’s tobacco
cessation programme. All participants were offered multicompo-
nent, evidence-based behavioural and pharmacological treatment
for tobacco dependence. At baseline, 26.5% of participants had
used an EC within the last 30 days. Seven hundred and eighty-
one participants were followed up at six to 12 months from base-
line, where self-reported seven-day point prevalence abstinence,
cigarettes per day, and information on whether a participant had
gone a day without smoking since baseline were collected.
In Manzoli 2015, which took place in community settings in
Abruzzo, Italy, 491 tobacco smokers and 232 dual EC and to-
bacco smokers were followed up at 12 months, with further fol-
low-ups planned at 24, 36 and 60 months. At baseline, the mean
EC nicotine dosage was 9.8 mg/ml, and the mean months of EC
use amongst dual users was 8.6. Follow-up measures included 30-
day sustained abstinence with CO verified in a subsample, and
30-day abstinence from tobacco and EC.
Finally, Prochaska 2014 reports a secondary analysis of data from
a randomized controlled trial in an inpatient psychiatric hospital
in California, USA. Nine hundred and fifty-six smokers of at least
five cigarettes a day were recruited and randomized to different
levels of behavioural support. At baseline, 11% of participants
used an EC. This paper reports cessation measures (not defined)
in EC and non-EC users at the longest available follow-up (not
defined, but study length was 18 months).
Adverse event data only
We include seven short-term cohort studies that report on adverse
events. These studies are not included in smoking analyses due
to short follow-up. Again, further details can be found in the
Characteristics of included studies tables.
Hajek 2015a offered an EC to 100 smokers joining a stop-smok-
ing service in London, UK. Participants were offered a choice of a
‘cigalike’ product (Gamucci, 1.6% or 2.2% nicotine per ml) or a
tank model (EVOD, 1.8%; later replaced with Aspire product due
to leakage issues), and 69% took up the offer. The ECs were pro-
vided alongside standard stop-smoking service provisions, includ-
ing an offer of stop-smoking medications and weekly behavioural
support. Adverse events were collected throughout. The study also
measured abstinence at four weeks, cost, and client feedback.
Humair 2014 describes a prospective cohort study involving 17
participants (all highly dependent smokers, 82% with a mental
illness), recruited from a university hospital outpatient clinic in
Switzerland, who chose to use an EC to help them stop or reduce
smoking. NRT or varenicline were used at some stage by 59%
of participants in addition to EC. This study was available as an
abstract only and thus we have limited detail on the methods and
measures used to record adverse events.
McRobbie 2015 recruited 40 daily smokers who wanted to quit,
from advertisements placed in free London newspapers. Partici-
pants attended a baseline session one week prior to their target quit
date (TQD). On the TQD, participants were provided with ECs
(’Green Smoke’, first-generation device, 2.4% nicotine cartridges).
Two cartridges a day were supplied initially, with the supply later
adjusted to actual usage. Participants attended weekly follow-up
sessions for four weeks, and received standard behavioural sup-
port. Cigarette consumption and CO readings collected at each
session and urine samples for cotinine and 3-hydroxypropylmer-
capturic acid (3-HPMA) analysis were collected at baseline and at
four weeks post-TQD.
Nides 2014 recruited 29 smokers in good health and not intend-
ing to reduce or quit smoking in the next 30 days. The aim of
this study was to investigate nicotine delivery and potential for
smoking reduction or cessation. Participants were provided with a
10-day supply of disposable ECs (’NJOY King Bold’ brand con-
taining 26 mg of nicotine) and instructed to use them ad libitum
for a week. At the end of the week, 25 participants returned to the
clinic, after abstaining from smoking and EC use for 12 hours.
They undertook two series, an hour apart, of 10 puffs on their
EC, and changes in plasma nicotine, heart rate and CO, and with-
drawal symptoms were measured. Adverse events that occurred
during the period of ad libitum use were also collected.
Oncken 2015 describes a randomized cross-over study involving
27 non-treatment-seeking smokers of at least 10 cigarettes a day
who were willing to try ECs for two weeks. Participants were pre-
scribed Joye e-GO C with 18 mg/ml nicotine, and crossed over
at one week between menthol flavour and non-menthol tobacco-
flavoured ECs. Participants were requested not to smoke during
the study, but 60% reported intermittently using their normal
cigarettes. At one and two weeks, blood pressure, heart rate, body
15

 plethysmography, static lung volumes, airways resistance (Raw)
and specific conductance (sGaw) were measured after abstaining
from EC for two hours and, subsequently, five minutes after inhal-
ing an EC. Data on adverse events, nicotine concentrations and
rates of cigarette and EC use were also collected.
Although not a prospective cohort study, Polosa 2014a allowed for
extraction of data regarding adverse events. This study identified
18 participants with mild-to-moderate asthma who had previously
smoked an average of 22 cigarettes a day, who reported regular EC
use on at least two consecutive follow-up visits, approximately six
months apart, using a retrospective audit of clinical records from a
respiratory outpatient clinic in Italy. Ten were using ECs only, and
eight used ECs and smoked up to five cigarettes a day. The dura-
tion of EC use ranged from 10 to 14 months, and all started on
first-generation ECs, though the ’majority’ switched to a “personal
vaporiser” (second- or third-generation). The authors collected
data from four clinic visits: pre-baseline (6 to 12 months prior
to baseline); baseline visit (pre-EC use), which occurred approxi-
mately six months prior to the first follow-up visit; six-month fol-
low-up; and 12-month follow-up. At each visit, participants were
assessed by clinical history and examination, and by re-evaluation
of treatment adherence and efficacy. Information was gathered on
asthma control, the number of exacerbations from the previous
follow-up visit, spirometry measurements, forced expiratory flow,
and bronchial provocation tests assessing Airway Hyper Respon-
siveness (AHR) with methacholine (some participants only).
Van Staden 2013 recruited 15 healthy smokers of at least 10
cigarettes a day from a military hospital in South Africa. They
were each provided with an EC (’Twisp eGo’ 18 mg/ml nicotine)
and asked to use this and to stop smoking for two weeks. Blood
pressure, pulse, arterial and venous carboxyhaemoglobin satura-
tion (COHb) and blood oxygen saturation were measured at base-
line and two-week follow-up in 13 participants that attended both
sessions.
Excluded studies
The reasons for exclusion of the 46 studies that we reviewed are
briefly summarized below, but further detail can be found in the
Characteristics of excluded studies table.
We ruled out the majority of excluded studies because the partici-
pants used ECs for less than a week, or the study report contained
no information on cessation or adverse events. In these cases we
were unable to determine if the excluded studies intended to mea-
sure these outcomes. In line with our protocol, we excluded cross-
sectional studies with data collected at one time point only, for rea-
sons including inability to control for confounding variables and
recall bias (see Agreements and disagreements with other studies
or reviews for further discussion of potential biases).
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias in the two RCTs which contribute to the ces-
sation meta-analysis (Bullen 2013; Caponnetto 2013a) was low
across all domains. The only exception was in the reporting bias
in Caponnetto 2013a, as it was unclear if the original intention
was to combine the two nicotine-containing EC groups or not.
In the sample size calculation the authors compared the nicotine
EC group with the placebo EC, but results are not reported in
this way. In both studies the randomization procedures were ade-
quate, biochemical validation of abstinence was used, and an in-
tention-to-treat analysis was undertaken where all participants lost
to follow-up (LTFU) were considered to be smoking. The lost-
to-follow-up rate in Bullen 2013 was 22%. Although the patch
grouphadhigherLTFUandwithdrawal thanthe ECgroup(patch:
27%; nicotine-EC: 16%; placebo EC: 22%), there was minimal
difference between the per-protocol and ITT analyses and so we
deemed attrition bias to be at low risk. LTFU rates were similar
among the three arms at 12 months in Caponnetto 2013a (35%
in 7.2 mg nicotine group; 37% in 5.4 mg nicotine group; 45% in
no-nicotine group). In the randomized cross-over trial (Oncken
2015), we judged the risk of selection, performance and detection
bias to be unclear, due to the limited amount of detail provided.
We rated attrition and selection bias as low, with 20 out of 27
participants followed up and all expected outcomes reported. In
Adriaens 2014, a further RCT not included in the cessation meta-
analysis, we judged allocation concealment and attrition bias to be
unclear, due to limited detail available; we rated all other domains
as low risk of bias.
We categorized all other included studies, by nature of their design,
as being at high risk of selection bias. Ten of these did not blind
participantsorpersonnel and,giventhe nature of the study, follow-
up measures and contact with researchers, we judged them to be at
risk of selection or performance bias or both. In the other studies,
the lack of intervention or contact with researchers means that
there is unlikely to be significant performance or detection bias.
Rates of follow-up were mixed in the non-randomized studies,
with four judged to be at risk of attrition bias because of high or
differential levels of follow-up. For many of the cohort studies we
were unable to determine prespecified outcomes and hence rated
these as being at unclear risk of reporting bias. One cohort study
stated they collected data on adverse events, but did not provide
any results for this outcome measure, and we judged it to be at
high risk of reporting bias (Pacifici 2015). Finally, Ely 2013 did
not provide a definition of abstinence and it was unclear if the
completion of the programme was at six months after enrolment,
or at an earlier time point. We therefore judged this study to be at
high risk of other bias.
Details of ’Risk of bias’ judgements for each domain of each
included study can be found in the Characteristics of included
studies table. Figure 3 illustrates judgements for each included
study.

 Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Electronic
cigarettes for smoking cessation
In this section we have summarized the effects of ECs on smoking
cessation and adverse events.
Cessation
Randomized controlled trials
In the trial comparing EC to patch (Bullen 2013) there was no
significant difference in six-month CO-validated continuous ab-
stinence between the treatment arms (7.3%, 5.8% and 4.1%, in
the nicotine EC, patch and placebo EC arms respectively). We
made two comparisons. The first compares abstinence rates be-
tween nicotine and placebo EC (7.3% versus 4.1%, risk ratio (RR)
1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 5.77; 362 participants;
Analysis 1.1). The second compares abstinence rates between the
nicotine EC and patch arms (7.3% versus 5.8%, RR 1.26, 95% CI
0.68 to 2.34; 584 participants; Analysis 1.2). Fewer than half of
all participants across all groups accessed support (39.8%, 35.9%,
and 35.6% in the nicotine EC, patch and placebo EC arms re-
spectively).
In the other RCT (Caponnetto 2013a) one-year abstinence rates
(at least six months of not smoking and CO-validated) were higher
in the two nicotine EC arms (13% and 9%) compared with the
placebo EC group (4%). In our analysis we combined the two
nicotine EC arms and compared these with the placebo group.
The difference was not statistically significant (11% versus 4%,
RR 2.75, 95% CI 0.97 to 7.76; 300 participants; Analysis 1.1).
We combined data from the two studies comparing abstinence
rates in nicotine versus placebo EC groups. There was no signif-
icant statistical heterogeneity between the studies (Chi² = 0.30,
P = 0.58; I² = 0%) and pooled results showed use of a nicotine-
containing EC was associated with higher abstinence rates than
placebo EC use (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96, 662 participants;
Analysis 1.1).
Cohort studies
The abstinence rates from each cohort study are summarized in
Table 1.
Intervention studies
Among the intervention cohort studies that enrolled smokers un-
motivated to quit, Polosa 2011 reported abstinence rates (30-
day point prevalence, CO-validated abstinence) of 22.5% at six
months and 12.5% at two years. Pacifici 2015 reported cessation
rates of 52.9% at 12 months, but did not define how cessation was
measured. Polosa 2014b reported 36% (18/50) seven-day point
prevalence abstinence rates at 6 months, which were CO-vali-
dated. In the study of highly-dependent smokers with schizophre-
nia, 14% (2/14) achieved abstinence (CO-validated) at one year
(Caponnetto 2013b). In Ely 2013, 43.8% (21/48) of participants
were abstinent from smoking at the completion of the six-month
programme. Of those that exclusively used ECs (n = 26), 50% (13)
were abstinent, compared with 37.5% (6/16) of those who used
both ECs and bupropion, and 100% (2/2) who used ECs with
varenicline. In the one intervention cohort study in which moti-
vation to quit was not defined (Polosa 2015), 42.2% of partici-
pants (30/71) were abstinent at six months, with similar numbers
at 12 months (40.8%, 29/71; 30-day, self-reported point preva-
lence abstinence). In Adriaens 2014, a randomized controlled trial
in which all participants were provided with nicotine-containing
ECs at eight weeks, and which we hence treat as a cohort study for
cessation purposes, 19.6% of participants were abstinent at eight
months (10/51) using CO validation.
Longitudinal surveys
The longitudinal surveys from the first version of this review con-
tained relatively few smokers who were using ECs at baseline. Etter
2014 showedone-yearself-reportedabstinence ratesof 45.7%(16/
35) among the responders who used ECs at baseline. In Grana
2014b the one-year abstinence rate was 10% (9/88) in smokers
who had used ECs (at least once in the last 30 days) at baseline,
compared with 13.8% (119/861) in non-EC users. The difference
between EC and non-EC users was not statistically significant. No
information was provided on whether people were using ECs for
the purpose of cessation or reduction prior to baseline, or whether
they used any EC at all during the follow-up period. Choi 2014
only reported that 11% of smokers who had used ECs for one day
or more in the last 30 days at baseline had quit smoking at one-
year follow-up, compared with 17% of smokers who had never
used ECs. After adjusting for demographics and baseline cigarette
consumption, the odds of quitting were not significantly different
between EC users and people who had never used ECs (odds ratio
(OR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.63). Again, no information was
provided on whether the participants used ECs during the follow-
up period.
Reflecting the increase in EC usage, some of the longitudinal sur-
veys added during this review update had a higher baseline preva-
lence of EC use than those included previously. Al-Delaimy 2015
found one-year self-reported prolonged abstinence (one month or
longer) rates of 5% (12/236) in people who reported ever using
EC at baseline, compared to 10.5% (32/306) in participants who
indicated they would never use EC at both baseline and follow-up;
the authors report that ever use of EC predicted a lower likelihood
18

 of cessation in a multivariable analysis (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18
to 0.93). In Borderud 2014, 14.5% (denominator unknown) of
participants who reported EC use in the past 30 days at baseline
were abstinent at 12 months (self-reported seven-day point preva-
lence abstinence), compared with 30% of non-EC users. In an
ITT analysis correcting for a range of predictors, non-EC users
were found to be more likely to quit than EC users (OR 2.00, 95%
CI 1.23 to 3.26), although there was no significant difference in
a complete-case analysis. It was not possible to calculate ITT data
for Brose 2015; at one year, 8.1% of people who reported daily
EC use at baseline (7/86) reported being ex-smokers, compared
to 9.5% (25/263) of people who reported non-daily EC use at
baseline and 12.9% (168/1307) of non-EC users. Compared with
non-use, daily EC use at baseline was not significantly associated
with cessation at follow-up (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.37), nor
was non-daily EC use. In Manzoli 2015, sustained (30-day) smok-
ing abstinence was reported at 12 months, with CO validation in
a subsample of participants. The authors report there was no sig-
nificant difference in abstinence between EC users and non-users
(summary statistic not provided), with 16% (51/319) of those
who reported baseline EC use abstinent at 12 months compared
with 15% (101/693) of people who did not use EC at baseline.
Finally, Prochaska 2014 also did not find a significant difference
in cessation (definition not provided) between those using EC and
non-users; at the longest available follow-up point, 21% of people
reporting EC use at baseline were abstinent, compared to 19% of
those not reporting EC use at baseline (P = 0.726).
Crucially, this group of studies (the longitudinal surveys) share a
serious limitation. As these studies only recruited current smokers,
they excluded those people from the same population who tried
ECs and stopped smoking (e.g. if 100 smokers tried ECs and 50
stopped smoking, these studies would only recruit the 50 who
continued to smoke). Following up ‘treatment failures’ is likely to
show a low treatment effect, even for treatments that are highly
effective. To asses the effects of ECs on smoking, participants need
to be recruited prior to initiating EC use. In future versions of this
review, as higher-quality data become available, we will no longer
include this group of studies.
Adverse events
None of the RCTs or cohort studies reported any serious adverse
events (SAEs) that were considered to be plausibly related to EC
use.
Of the people available for six-month follow-up in the ASCEND
trial (Bullen 2013), 44.4% of participants in the nicotine EC arm
reported any AEs, compared with 44.7% and 45.6% in the patch
and placebo EC arms respectively. Differences were not statistically
significant (nicotine versus placebo EC: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71
to 1.34; 298 participants; Analysis 2.1; nicotine EC versus patch;
RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.122; 456 participants; Analysis 2.2).
The ECLAT trial (Caponnetto 2013a) found no difference in
frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the
three groups. AEs were also measured at baseline, with the five
most frequently reported being cough (26%), dry mouth (22%),
shortness of breath (20%), throat irritation (17%), and headache
(17%). In all groups the frequency of AEs decreased significantly
over time, with the exception of throat irritation.
The cohort studies show a similar picture, with mouth and throat
irritation being the most frequently reported AEs in EC users,
most commonly dissipating over time. In Nides 2014, where par-
ticipants used ECs for one week, 12 participants experienced 15
AEs and all but one (throat irritation) were classified as mild. Af-
ter two weeks of use, Van Staden 2013 documented that 54%
of participants (7/13) reported reduction in phlegm compared
with baseline, whilst 31% (4/13) reported an increase. Changes
in phlegm production could also be secondary to stopping smok-
ing (the majority also reported an improved sense of taste, smell
and an increase in appetite). There was one dropout due to illness
(headache and fever), but it is unclear if this was deemed to be
related to EC use or not. In Oncken 2015, where participants used
ECs for two weeks with cross-over at one week between menthol
and non-menthol tobacco-flavoured e-liquid, AEs included cough
in 19% of participants (5/27) , mouth/throat irritation in 15%
(4/27), nausea in 4% (1/27), headache in 4% (1/27), and “other”
in 4% (1/27) (irritability, stomach cramps). This study reported
one severe adverse event (itchy throat and cough) in a partici-
pant with a history of childhood asthma; the participant was dis-
continued from EC use and symptoms resolved. In Polosa 2011,
which reported longer-term follow-up, the most commonly re-
ported AEs were throat irritation (8.7%), mouth irritation (8.7%),
dry cough (13.1%), dry mouth (4.3%), and headache (4.3%),
which were stable throughout the study (percentages represent 24-
month data). Dizziness and nausea had been reported at the start of
the study but disappeared by 24 months. In Polosa 2014b, where
AEs were measured over six months of EC use, throat/mouth ir-
ritation (35.6%), dry throat/mouth (28.9%), headache (26.7%)
and dry cough (22.2%) were frequently reported at study start
but all decreased in frequency over time. In Hajek 2015a, where
AEs were collected over four weeks, throat irritation and minor
coughing were reported (incidence not quantified). The authors
report one incident of a leak from the EVOD system which re-
sulted in mouth irritation; medical treatment was not sought and
the incident was resolved by washing the lip with water. Adriaens
2014 did not systematically collect data on AEs but did collect
’complaints’ through online diaries; across all groups; these in-
cluded bad taste, dry mouth/throat, irritated mouth/throat, dizzi-
ness, headache, nausea, and increased heart rate/palpitations, al-
though rates were not provided. The authors note no significant
change in Beck Depression Inventory scores (from 5.79 (stan-
dard deviation (SD) 8.35) at baseline to 4.94 (SD 8.76) at eight
months). Humair 2014 reports only that participants did not ex-
perience any AEs. Pacifici 2015 reports measuring AEs but does
not report the resulting data.

 Effects on specific parameters
Eight studies report the effects of at least one week of EC use on
more specific parameters.
In Adriaens 2014, which randomized participants to EC or control
at baseline and then provided all participants with EC at eight
weeks, authors report changes over time within groups but do not
report direct between-group comparisons. The EC groups showed
an overall significant decrease in expired CO from the first lab
session at week one to the second lab session at 4 weeks (P <
0.001), but not the control group (P = 0.10). At eight months
(by which time all groups had received EC) there was a significant
decrease in CO for all groups combined compared with baseline
(P < 0.01, mean baseline CO 17.58 ppm (SD 7.17), mean CO at
eight months 11.56 ppm (10.41)).
McRobbie 2015, a prospective cohort study in which all partici-
pants were provided with an EC, assessed the change in 3-HPMA,
the main metabolite of acrolein, excreted in urine after four weeks
of EC use. Acrolein is a carcinogen and is present in cigarette
smoke and some EC vapour (Bein 2011). There is a concern that
people that use EC and smoke may be exposed to higher levels
of acrolein than smoking alone. Of the 33 people that completed
four-week follow-up, 16 were EC users only, and 17 were dual
users. Both groups showed a significant decrease in 3-HMPA in
ng/mg creatinine (EC users: 1623 (SD 850) to 343 (SD 178), P <
0.001; Dual users: 2443 (SD 1105) to 969 (SD 807), P < 0.001).
CO levels (ppm) also showed a significant decrease over time in
both groups (EC users: 15 (SD 8) to 3 (SD 2), P < 0.001; Dual
users: 23 (SD 11) to 11 (SD 8), P = 0.001).
Pacifici 2015 tested exhaled CO at one, four and eight months
in an uncontrolled pre-post pilot study. At one month, EC users
showed a significant decline in exhaled CO; there was no signif-
icant change in non-EC users (people who had opted not to use
the EC provided). At four and eight months, exhaled CO had de-
clined in EC and non-EC users. Polosa 2011, a prospective cohort
study in which all participants were provided with EC, measured
exhaled CO and found a significant reduction in the average across
the whole cohort of 23.5 to 8 ppm at 24 months (P = 0.011).
Polosa 2014b, a further prospective cohort study in which all par-
ticipants were provided with EC, also measured exhaled CO but
report results graphically by group; at 24 weeks, CO appears to
have significantly reduced amongst quitters and people reducing
cigarette consumption by at least 50%, and appears to have re-
mained stable in people who continued smoking at least half as
many cigarettes as they had at baseline.
In the randomized cross-over trial of menthol versus non-menthol
tobacco-flavoured e-liquid (Oncken 2015), the authors found no
significant differences in airway function (Raw or sGaw) over the
course of the two weeks compared to baseline (P > 0.09), or five
minutes after inhalation of either type of EC (P > 0.1). There were
also no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure in either
group at any time point.
In the retrospective study of smokers with asthma who had be-
come regular EC users (Polosa 2014a), there was no evidence of
harm. On the contrary, there were significant improvements in
asthma control, measures of lung function, and airways hyper-
responsiveness both in EC users only (n = 10) and in dual users
(n = 8) over the 12-month follow-up period. There was a slight
decrease in the number of asthma exacerbations, but this was not
statistically significant (1.17 to 0.78, P = 0.153).
Van Staden 2013, a short-term pre-post study which measured
outcomes after two weeks of EC use, showed that smokers who
switched to ECs had significant improvement in blood oxygen
saturation (96.15% (SD 1.76) to 97.49% (SD 1.34); 1.34% in-
crease, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.08; P = 0.002) and reduction in arterial
(1.95%, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.44; P = 0.01) and venous (1.87%, 95%
CI 0.38 to 3.36; P = 0.02) carboxyhaemoglobin levels.

Summary of main results
This update includes a further 11 studies. However, no new ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating smoking cessation at
six months or longer were available, and the conclusions of this
review have not substantively changed. As with the previous ver-
sion of this review, a meta-analysis that pooled the results of two
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), covering 662 participants,
showed that smokers who used nicotine electronic cigarettes (ECs)
were significantly more likely to stop smoking than smokers using
placebo ECs. The effect size (5%) is small, but not unusual given
the low level of behavioural support provided. There was no evi-
dence of statistical heterogeneity, despite the differences in study
designs. In the one trial that evaluated it, a first-generation EC
with low nicotine delivery was as effective as nicotine patches in
helping smokers to quit long-term, but confidence intervals were
wide.
Although the two RCTs were well conducted and judged to be at
low risk of bias, we categorize the quality of the evidence overall
as low, because of the small number of trials on which it is based
(see Summary of findings for the main comparison). We would be
more confident in the findings were there more studies available,
and are encouraged by the increase in ongoing studies collected as
part of this review update.
None of the included studies reported serious adverse events con-
sidered possibly related to EC use. One of the included studies
detected a severe adverse event considered possibly related to EC
use, which was the advent of itchy throat and cough in a par-
ticipant with a history of childhood asthma. This resolved once
EC use was discontinued (Oncken 2015). No studies detected a
significant increase in adverse events in people using ECs. The
most commonly reported AEs were local irritation of the throat
and mouth. One of the RCTs (Caponnetto 2013a) measured AEs

 at baseline and then across the study duration, and showed that
the frequency of respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough and shortness
of breath) decreased over time, which is likely to be secondary to
changes in cigarette smoking. This finding was supported by data
from observational cohort studies.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This is a new and rapidly evolving field of research. The search for
the first version of this review captured almost 600 publications;
for this update, our searches returned a further 1117 references.
While we are confident that this represents the full range of data
for the time period searched (to January 2016), there may be
unpublishedstudiesthatwe didnotfind.Despite the large number
of publications returned, there were relatively few that contain
empirical data and meet our inclusion criteria. The increase in
ongoing studies suggests the evidence base will be strengthened in
coming years.
We relied predominantly on RCTs for smoking cessation. Only
two met our inclusion criteria. This limits the strength of our
conclusions. We were unable to do many of the planned analyses
because of insufficient data.
The designs of the two included RCTs limit the interpretation of
the findings. The ECLAT study (Caponnetto 2013a) used only a
placebo EC control, which does not allow comparison with stan-
dard smoking cessation treatments. The ASCEND trial (Bullen
2013) was more pragmatic, but also has some limitations. For
example, few people accepted the offer of telephone-based be-
havioural support. This is a likely reason for low absolute absti-
nence rates across all arms. The pragmatic nature of the study also
resulted in some differences in the way that participants received
their allocated product (EC was couriered directly to participants,
whereas nicotine patches were supplied via a voucher that partic-
ipants had to take to a community pharmacist). This approach
has been criticized, as this difference may have influenced the out-
comes (Grana 2014a). However, the trial was trying to replicate
standard practice, and sensitivity analyses did not suggest that this
was a mediator.
Both studies used first-generation cartridge ‘cigalike’ ECs that were
widely available at the time but that have now been surpassed by
newer models. The EC used in the ASCEND trial (Bullen 2013)
delivered little nicotine and not particularly quickly (Cmax of 1.3
ng/ml was achieved after 10 minutes of use). The EC used in
the ECLAT trial (Caponnetto 2013a) also performed poorly and
was discontinued before the trial was published. This may have
yielded a more conservative estimate than would be seen with
newer models. If these poorly-performing EC products can assist
smokers, products with better nicotine delivery may have better
effects.
This update includes additional data on cessation from nine fur-
ther studies. The newly-added intervention cohort studies show
a similar response to EC (with quit rates ranging from 14% in
smokers with mental illness to 53% in a population of smokers
unwilling to quit at the outset). This update also includes newly-
added longitudinal surveys. These studies share a serious limita-
tion, as they include only continuing smokers at baseline, mean-
ing people who have successfully used EC to quit prior to baseline
are not included in the study populations; as higher-quality data
become available, we will not include this study type in future
updates of this review. Of the seven longitudinal surveys which
analyzed cessation at follow-up based on EC use at baseline, five
detected no significant difference based on baseline EC use, and
two found that EC use at baseline was significantly associated with
decreased rates of abstinence at follow-up.
The adverse effects described in both the RCT and cohort studies
are similar, regardless of the brand of EC used or nicotine con-
tent, with placebo and nicotine-containing ECs showing similar
numbers and types of adverse events in direct comparisons. They
also reflect what is reported in survey data (Dawkins 2013b; Etter
2011), so we believe that they are broadly applicable to most EC
brands. The common adverse effects, i.e. mouth and throat irrita-
tion, are likely to be caused by the propylene glycol (a humectant)
and nicotine, which has a distinctive hot/peppery taste.
There has been concern raised that dual use may expose people
to greater health risks, including higher nicotine levels. However,
given that people who smoke like to maintain relatively stable
blood nicotine levels (Russell 1990), receiving nicotine from an
alternative source (i.e. EC) is likely to reduce nicotine intake from
cigarettes, which should be accompanied by a reduction in smoke
and toxin intake (Fagerström 2004). In a study assessing biochem-
ical changes exclusively in dual users, there was a significant de-
crease in cotinine, exhaled carbon monoxide levels, and urinary 3-
HMPA (McRobbie 2015). These results are supported by longer-
term studies in smokers provided with ECs, which found decreases
in exhaled carbon monoxide among dual users, and no significant
increases in cotinine levels across the study populations (Adriaens
2014; Pacifici 2015; Polosa 2011; Polosa 2014b).
Quality of the evidence
The RCTs from which we extracted data for this review were con-
ducted to a high standard, with adequate randomization, treat-
ment allocation and blinding, and the abstinence data are reported
in line with accepted standards, including biochemical validation
of self-reported smoking status. We consider these studies to be
at an overall low risk of bias. However, as there were only two of
them, the body of evidence is limited and we consider it to be low
or very low quality by GRADE standards, because of the small
number of trials. These GRADE ratings reflect low levels of con-
fidence in the effect estimates presented in this review. This low
level of certainty in the findings does not reflect issues with the
quality of the individual studies, but rather reflects imprecision
arising from low event rates and wide confidence intervals around
21

 the estimated effects, and some indirectness due to poor nicotine
delivery in one of the devices tested.
It was unclear if the ECLAT trial (Caponnetto 2013a) intended
to combine the two EC arms in the analysis or not. In sample size
calculation they compared ECs with placebo ECs, but results are
not reported in this way. The rationale for examining two very
similar EC arms is not obvious to the review authors.
Both RCTs were underpowered. The sample for the ASCEND
trial (Bullen 2013) was based on absolute six month quit rates of
20% and 30% for the patch and nicotine EC groups respectively.
The effect size was estimated from the meta-analysis of NRT trials,
but the estimated patch group 20% quit rate, which was estimated
from previous research undertaken in New Zealand where partic-
ipants were recruited from among callers to the national Quitline,
was clearly too optimistic. The ASCEND study recruited directly
from the community and this population may not have been as
committed to quitting, or the national Quitline data were based
on a less rigorous standard (e.g. unvalidated self-reported absti-
nence rate). The ECLAT trial (Caponnetto 2013a) also overesti-
mated expected abstinence rates and the subsequent sample size
(n = 300) was insufficient to detect significant differences.
The cohort studies that we included were all deemed to have high
risksof bias, which isinherentinthe studydesign. Some studiesdid
not define abstinence outcomes or validated self-reported smoking
status, which further lowers our confidence in the findings. Data
presented from these studies therefore needs to be interpreted with
caution.
A major limitation common to several cohort studies (e.g. Choi
2014; Dutra 2014; Lee 2014; Popova 2013) is the definition of
EC use, which is generally categorized as ‘ever use’ (e.g. ever tried,
even just once) and ‘current’ use (used on at least one day in the last
30 days). ’Ever use’ identifies experimentation, but oddly exper-
imentation within the last 30 days would be captured as current
use. Most of these studies were also unclear on the reasons for EC
use (e.g. as part of a quit attempt, trying the new product out of
curiosity, or to use when they cannot smoke) and failed to take
into account other relevant factors (e.g. level of dependence) in
their analyses. Perhaps most importantly, these studies excluded
EC users who stopped smoking and so only followed up ‘treat-
ment failures’. As such, causation cannot be inferred. As higher-
quality data become available, we will drop these studies from fu-
ture versions of this review.
Potential biases in the review process
We consider the review process used to be robust, and do not be-
lieve we have introduced any biases. For outcome assessment, we
followed the standard methods used for Cochrane Tobacco Ad-
diction Review Group cessation reviews. Our search strategy in-
cluded the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Reg-
ister and we were able to capture a number of ongoing studies.
However, there may be unpublished data that our searches did
not uncover. We also considered participants lost to follow-up as
smokers, which is best practice in this field of work.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
When this review was initially published (McRobbie 2014), it was
the first review of ECs to pool data and conduct a meta-analysis.
Since then, 14 systematic reviews of EC safety and/or efficacy for
smoking cessation have been conducted (see Appendix 2). Three
of these present meta-analyses for smoking cessation, and of these,
two included the same studies that we include: Rahman 2015a,
which had virtually identical results to ours (RR 2.29. 95% CI
1.05 to 4.97), and Khoudigian 2016, which had similar results
but marginally missed statistical significance as they included six-
as opposed to 12-month data from Caponnetto 2013a, in which
the quit rate was slightly higher in the control group at six months
than at 12 months (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.22). The third
meta-analysis, conducted by Kalkhoren and Glantz (Kalkhoran
2016), has significantly different results from ours, concluding
that, as currently being used, ECs are associated with significantly
less quitting among smokers (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91).
This review has generated considerable media attention and con-
troversy within the academic community (Hajek 2016). The cru-
cial difference between Kalkhoran’s meta-analysis and the other
three meta-analyses is that, rather than restricting the analysis to
include RCTs only, the authors have included a range of study
types, including cohort studies and cross-sectional studies, as well
as the two RCTs included in the other meta-analyses. Kalkhoran
and Glantz argue that the range of study types included in their
meta-analysis does not affect the validity of the result, as a sensi-
tivity analysis by study type did not reveal a significant difference.
However, given the paucity of RCTs (the sensitivity analysis com-
pared 19 non-randomized studies to two RCTs), there is very low
power to detect any reasonable difference. This very low power
explains why, despite the fact that the ORs for the RCTs and other
trials were in opposite directions (0.67 versus 1.38), the compari-
son was not statistically significant.
There are various reasons why RCTs provide different answers
from many observational studies in this area. These include varia-
tions in the effectiveness of ECs depending on the level of support
provided, issues around definitions of baseline EC usage, and un-
explored confounders. This is not an issue specific to ECs: cohort
studies of NRT show clear evidence that failure to adjust for con-
founders leads to estimates that suggest NRT is ineffective, while
including adjustment for variables related to tobacco dependence
supports its effectiveness (West 2007). In addition, those studies
which analyze results in smokers based on EC use at baseline have
by the nature of their design already excluded people who have
successfully quit using EC, and therefore only retain participants
who, at entrance to the study, would be classed as ’treatment fail-
ures’ or are in the midst of a cessation attempt involving cutting
22

 down to quit. Following the standard methods of the Cochrane
Tobacco Addiction Group and the protocol for this review, we
focused on evidence from randomized controlled trials for cessa-
tion outcomes, although we also analyzed cohort studies which
provided interpretable data.
Despite their differences, the one area in which all systematic re-
views of ECs for smoking cessation agree is that more evidence
is needed. The majority of recent systematic reviews in this area
sound a note of cautious optimism when it comes to the use of EC
as a smoking cessation aid, but the evidence base is limited, par-
ticularly in comparison with smoking cessation treatments with
established efficacy, such as traditional forms of nicotine replace-
ment therapy, varenicline and bupropion (Cahill 2016). Uncer-
tainty remains as to the long-term safety profile of ECs, given their
relatively new position in the market. Expert consensus broadly
holds that, based on all available evidence, ECs are considerably
safer than traditional cigarettes (McNeill 2015; RCP 2016), but
furtherstudies are needed to establish their safety profile compared
with established smoking cessation aids.

Implications for practice
A limited number of randomized trials have been reported, so cer-
tainty about the effects is low. More data are needed to strengthen
confidence in the estimates. There is evidence from the pooled
results of two trials that electronic cigarettes (ECs) with nicotine,
compared with placebo ECs, helped smokers to stop smoking
long-term. This corresponds to findings from placebo-controlled
trials of NRT (Stead 2012).
There is evidence from one trial that ECs may lead to six-month
quit rates similar to those achieved with NRT, but the confidence
interval is wide. ECs are an evolving technology and the effects of
newer devices with better nicotine delivery are unknown.
None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years)
detected serious adverse events considered possibly related to EC
use. The most commonly reported adverse effects were irritation of
the mouth and throat. The long-term safety of ECs is unknown. In
some studies, reductions in biomarkers were observed in smokers

Implications for research
Although the gold standard in examining the efficacy of medicines,
including those used to help people stop smoking, is to com-
pare active treatment with placebo, testing ECs containing nico-
tine against ECs without nicotine presents a rather conservative
paradigm. This is because ECs provide nicotine replacement as
well as behavioural and sensory replacement for cigarettes. As both
of these elements are likely to be active ingredients of EC effects,
‘placebo-controlled’ trials are in effect subtracting the sensorimo-
tor element from EC efficacy. Although these sensorimotor effects
may be important to many smokers, we do not know how much
they might enhance quit rates. Existing evidence suggests that this
may be only small (Bullen 2013; Przulj 2013). Although placebo
ECs were important in testing ECs with metrics used in evalu-
ating NRT products, future studies should focus on comparing
ECs with ‘usual care’ or minimal treatment, and with alternative
pharmacological and behavioural treatments. In this update, we
found 15 ongoing RCTs with follow-up of six months or longer,
which include comparisons with pharmacological and behavioural
treatments and ’usual care.’
Data are also needed on the proportions of smokers who success-
fully quit smoking with the help of ECs and who continue to use
ECs long-term, and the proportion who eventually become nico-
tine-free. To assess the effects of ECs on smokers at the popula-
tion level, data are needed on relationships between trajectories of
vaping and smoking rates in countries where both products are
available.
Given the variety of EC products on the market and the product
evolution, future studies need to select ECs with good nicotine
deliverythatare representative of the bestcurrentstandardinterms
of reliability and user satisfaction.
Further RCTs also need to be adequately powered, and to consider
providing ECs in a way that would be used in real-world settings
(e.g. taking into account individual preferences for strengths and
flavours of e-liquids and even EC devices).

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Adriaens 2014
Methods
Design: 3-armed RCT (but for abstinence outcomes, treated as cohort in this review)
Recruitment: Advertisement on university website, flyers on university campuses, emails
to personnel and advertisement in local newspaper
Setting: Community and laboratory, Belgium
Inclusion criteria: Smoker for at least 3 years, smoking at least 10 factory-made cpd, not
intending to quit in the near future but willing to try a less unhealthy alternative
Exclusion criteria: Diabetes, severe allergies, asthma or other respiratory diseases, psychi-
atric problems, dependence on chemicals other than nicotine, pregnancy, breast feeding,
hypertension, CV disease, currently using any kind of smoking cessation therapy, prior
use of EC
Participants
Total N: 48 provided data (51 consented, 50 attended any lab sessions, 2 further with-
drawals) Randomized to: EC1 16, EC2 17, control 17
56% women, mean age 44, mean cpd 19, mean FTCD 5.79, all unwilling to quit with
no baseline EC use
Interventions
Intervention: 2 intervention groups (EC1 and EC2) provided with 2nd-generation EC
and instructed to use EC or smoke ad libitum (EC1 group provided with Joyetech eGO-
C, EC2 group provided with Kanger T2-CC) and provided guidance on EC use. For
both types, provided 30 mL bottles of tobacco-flavoured e-liquid (Dekang “Turkish
Blend”), containing 18 mg/mL of nicotine. 4 bottles at baseline replenished at 4 weeks,
keep any remaining after 8 weeks
Control: 6 bottles for 2 months at week 8 (half offered EC1, half offered EC2); no
guidance on use
Outcomes
3 lab sessions over 2 months (weeks 1, 4 and 8), plus online questionnaires, further
follow-up at 3 and 6m after last lab session
Cessation: measured but definition not provided, validated with eCO 5 ppm or less
Adverse events and biomarkers: eCO, salivary cotinine measured during lab sessions.
Also collected “complaints” via online diaries, not EC-specific
Also collected craving and withdrawal symptoms via lab sessions, “benefits and com-
plaints”, mood, EC usage
Notes
Not included in cessation meta-analysis or interpreted as RCTs as does not meet our
inclusion criteria for RCTs (6m comparison with non-users/placebo). Reported narra-
tively alongside cohort studies. At 2 months, before the control group received EC, CO-
validated quit rates were 34% vs 0%

Methods
Design: Prospective cohort study
Recruitment: Members of California Smokers Cohort (longitudinal survey), recruited
proactively 2011 - 2013 via telephone
Setting: California, USA
Inclusion criteria: state residents aged 18 - 59 who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes
during their lifetime and smoked cigarettes “at least some days” at baseline
Exclusion criteria: Not stated
Participants
Total N: 1000 adult smokers (for this review, only include 236 ever EC users and 306
’will never use EC’ respondents)
52.2% women; 30% 18 - 44 years old, 70% 45 - 59; 10% Hispanic, 73% non-Hispanic
white, 18% other; 83.6% daily smoker, 43% intended to quit smoking in next 6m
Interventions
Observational, no specific intervention. At baseline asked to indicate if they had used,
might use, or would never use EC. Defined EC as “devices that look like cigarettes and
contain nicotine but do not produce tobacco smoke; some brands are The Safe Cig,
Green Smoke, and Blu.”

age 51 - 60), 57% had a high school education or less
Interventions
The 6-month smoking cessation programme was based on The ’5 A’s’ model and trans-
theoretical model. Options for treatment were discussed with each participant at the start
of the programme. All used an EC, with 16 using bupropion and 2 using varenicline as
well
Participants were provided with written information on “blu cig” and “smoke tip” ECs,
regarding cost, availability, nicotine dosage options

Hajek 2015a
Methods
Design: Prospective cohort, intervention provided
Recruitment: Smokers attending stop-smoking service
Setting: Stop-smoking service, London, UK
Inclusion criteria: All smokers joining stop-smoking service
Participants
Total N: 100 (69 of whom accepted offer of EC)
38% women (those who accepted) 55% women (those who declined), mean age 41,
mean cpd 14, all motivated to quit. EC use at baseline not specified but some who
declined EC offer had used EC in the past
Interventions
EC: offered to all smokers joining service; offered choice of ‘cigalike’ (Gamucci, 1.6% or
2.2% nicotine per ml) product or tank model (EVOD, 1.8%; later replaced with Aspire
product due to leakage issues). 69% of those offered received an EC on TQD
Medication: Offered stop-smoking medications including NRT and varenicline as in
standard protocol. Of EC users 33% opted to also use NRT, 29% varenicline, 38%
nothing
Support: weekly, as in standard protocol
Outcomes
Adverse events collected throughout, method for collection unclear
Also collected: 4-week biochemically-validated abstinence, client feedback, cost
Notes
Study allows a comparison between users and non-users of EC but follow-up only 4
weeks so does not contribute to abstinence results

Methods
Design: Prospective observational study using data from a 3-group randomized RCT
Recruitment: 2009 - 2013, recruited as part of clinical trial of smokers with serious
mental illness
Setting: Inpatient psychiatric hospital, California, USA
Inclusion criteria: Daily smokers of 5+ cpd, patient at 100% smoke-free acute care unit
at psychiatric hospitals
Exclusion criteria: non-English speaking; medical contraindications to NRT use (preg-
nancy, recent myocardial infarction); and lack of capacity to consent as determined by a
3-item screener of study purpose, risks, and benefits
Participants
Total N: 956
• UC 134
• Brief treatment 414
• Extended treatment 408
50% women; mean age 39; 15% Hispanic, 57% white, 24% African-American, 5%
Asian/Pacific Islander; 14% multiracial/other; mean cpd 17; 11% used EC at baseline,

Psychiatric diagnoses were 27% unipolar depression, 32% bipolar depression, and 27%
nonaffective psychotic disorder; other (14%). 68% met criteria for alcohol or illicit drug
abuse or dependence
Interventions
RCT tested levels of behavioural support:
Usual care; brief treatment; extended treatment. Treatment groups received tailored com-
puter-assisted intervention or on-unit counselling. Extended group offered 10 sessions
of CBT
No significant differences in EC use by treatment group. All participants were provided
NRT following hospitalization (3 months brief arm, 6 months extended arm)

Van Staden 2013
Methods
Design: Single-group within-subject design
Recruitment: Participants from a military hospital in South Africa
Inclusion criteria: Adult daily smokers of at least 10 cpd
Exclusion criteria: History of lung disease
Participants
Total N: 15, mean age 38 years, smoked 20 cpd (range 10 - 30), for an average of 17
years (range 5 - 27)
Total N: 13 completed the study (5 women)
Interventions
Participants were asked to use an EC only for 2 weeks (i.e. no cigarettes)
EC: ’Twisp eGo’ cartridge 0.8 ml containing 0.0144 mg of nicotine
Outcomes
The following measurements were taken at baseline and 2-week follow-up:
1. Blood pressure and pulse
2. Arterial and venous COHb and blood oxygen saturation
Notes
Dropouts (N = 2) were due to illness (headache and fever) and undertaking a military
course associated with high stress and exposure to others smoking, making it difficult to
abstain from cigarettes
The paper states that the EC cartridge contained 0.8 ml of solution with 0.0144 mg
of nicotine. This would be an unusually low concentration of nicotine and we have
assumed an error in units where milligrams should have been grams (0.0144 grams of
nicotine would make the concentration 18 mg/ml)

Within the last three years HM has received honoraria for speaking at research symposia and received benefits in kind and travel support
from, and has provided consultancy to, the manufacturers of smoking cessation medications.
Within the last three years PH has provided consultancy for and received research funding from GSK, Pfizer, Novartis and other
manufacturers of smoking cessation medications.
Two authors (HM, CB) have additional declarations:
CB and HM were investigators on a study of ECs from an EC manufacturer (Ruyan Group, Beijing and Hong Kong). Ruyan supplied
the ECs used in the trial and contracted with Health NZ Ltd. to undertake the study. Health New Zealand Ltd funded The University
of Auckland to conduct the trial, independently of Ruyan Group (Holdings) Ltd. The trial design conduct, analysis and interpretation
of results were conducted independently of the sponsors.
CB and HM were investigators on the ASCEND EC trial funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand that used product
supplied at no charge from PGM international, a retailer of ECs.
JHB, RB and LS have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Originally, the protocol did not specify a minimum follow-up period for data on adverse events. The Methods section has been changed
to clarify that we will exclude follow-up data at less than a week.
The original version of this review included reduction as a secondary outcome. The 2016 update removed reduction as an outcome,
to bring the review into line with other reviews of cessation treatments produced by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group and to
prevent substantial overlap with the update of the group’s review of interventions for harm reduction (Stead 2007, update forthcoming).
