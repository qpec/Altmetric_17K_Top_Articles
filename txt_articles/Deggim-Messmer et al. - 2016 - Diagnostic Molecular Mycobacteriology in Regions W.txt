Molecular assays have not yet been able to replace time-consuming culture-based methods in clinical
mycobacteriology.
Using 6875 clinical samples and a study period of 35 months we evaluated the use of PCR-based assays to estab-
lish a diagnostic workflow with a fast time-to-result of 1–2 days, for 1. detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex (MTB), 2. detection and identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and 3. identification of
drug susceptible MTB.
MTB molecular-based detection and culture gave concordant results for 97.7% of the specimens. NTM PCR-based
detection and culture gave concordant results for 97.0% of the specimens. Defining specimens on the basis of
combined laboratory data as true positives or negatives with discrepant results resolved by clinical chart reviews,
we calculated sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for PCR-based MTB detection as 84.7%, 100%, 100%, and 98.7%;
the corresponding values for culture-based MTB detection were 86.3%, 100%, 100%, and 98.8%. PCR-based detec-
tion of NTM had a sensitivity of 84.7% compared to 78.0% of that of culture-based NTM detection. Molecular drug
susceptibility testing (DST) by line-probe assay was found to predict phenotypic DST results in MTB with excel-
lent accuracy.
Our findings suggest a diagnostic algorithm to largely replace lengthy culture-based techniques by rapid molec-
ular-based methods.

1. Introduction
The genus Mycobacterium is separated into the pathogenic species
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium leprae, and Myco-
bacterium ulcerans, and various nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
(Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 2015).
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the causative agent of tubercu-
losis. Global priorities for tuberculosis (TB) care and control are to im-
prove case-detection and to enhance rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis
disease (WHO, 2014). Directly observed standardized short-course che-
motherapy (DOTS) is an effective treatment for drug-susceptible tuber-
culosis disease, with cure rates N95.0% (Hopewell et al., 2006).
However, the current situation is characterized by increasing numbers
of drug-resistant tuberculosis disease. The treatment of multidrug-re-
sistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB requires the use
of second-line drugs, which are less effective, more expensive, and
more toxic than first-line drugs (WHO, 2014; Hopewell et al., 2006).
NTM are ubiquitously present in the environment. Their pathogenic
potential is variable and infections predominantly occur in patients
with underlying disorders or immunocompromising conditions, al-
though individuals without predisposing risk factors can also be affect-
ed (Griffith et al., 2007; Aksamit et al., 2014). Diseases caused by NTM
include lung disease (e.g. Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium

 kansasii), cutaneous ulcers (e.g. Mycobacterium marinum, M. ulcerans),
disseminated infections (e.g. Mycobacterium genavense), lymphadenitis
(e.g. Mycobacterium avium), and joint infections (e.g. Mycobacterium
haemophilum) (Tortoli, 2009; Tortoli, 2014). The variety of diseases
caused by NTM, the association of NTM infections with underlying dis-
orders such as bronchiectasis and severe immunosuppressive condi-
tions, and the difficulty to distinguish NTM pulmonary infections from
MTB pulmonary infections on the basis of clinical symptoms and imag-
ing alone, all of these underline the need for detection and proper iden-
tification of NTM in addition to that of MTB in clinical specimens
(Griffith et al., 2007).
Laboratory diagnosis of mycobacterial infections is done in designated
and specialized laboratories not the least due to the need for biosafety
conditions, and the same isolation procedures and cultural techniques
are used for recovery of M. tuberculosis and all of the NTM pathogens. Tra-
ditionally, detection of mycobacteria and drug susceptibility testing (DST)
is based on culture, which is a time consuming, complicated, resource
costly and lengthy process. Recovery of mycobacteria by culture and iden-
tification takes about 2–4 weeks, followed by an additional 1–2 weeks for
drug susceptibility testing (Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 2015).
PCR-based diagnostic procedures for direct detection of MTB in clin-
ical specimens have been introduced N20 years ago (Boddinghaus et al.,
1990; Thierry et al., 1990). A number of genetic assays for detection of
MTB DNA in clinical specimens are commercially available, e.g. AMTD
Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (Gen-Probe Inc.,
San Diego, USA), COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB test (Roche, Basel, Switzer-
land), BD ProbeTec ET system (Becton Dickinson, Baltimore, USA), Ab-
bott LCx M. tuberculosis assay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA), and
Fluorotype MTB (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany), as are nu-
merous studies comparing molecular and culture-based methods for
detection of MTB (Reischl et al., 1998; Goessens et al., 2005; Kim et al.,
2011; Tortoli et al., 2012; Bloemberg et al., 2013; Hofmann-Thiel and
Hoffmann, 2014). In contrast to MTB, molecular genetic assays for de-
tection of NTM are only infrequently implemented in routine diagnos-
tics, although various in-house assays have been described (Kirschner
et al., 1996; Del Portillo et al., 1996; Stauffer et al., 1998; Shrestha et
al., 2003; Peter-Getzlaff et al., 2010).
Different formats have been developed for detection of resistance
conferring mutations in MTB. Compared to the GeneXpert MTB/RIF
assay (Boehme et al., 2010) which is limited to the detection of rifampi-
cin resistance, line probe assays are particularly attractive due to their
unmatched versatility, i.e., their ability to detect multiple mutations in
different chromosomal targets, and their low cost (Hillemann et al.,
2005; Hillemann et al., 2009; Barnard et al., 2012; Jacobson et al.,
2013; Ritter et al., 2014; Domínguez et al., 2016). Several line probe as-
says are commercially available, e.g. GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain
Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany), AID TB Resistance (AID
Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany), and INNO-LiPA Rif TB
(Fujirebio Europe N.V., Gent, Belgium).
More recently, WHO recommended the implementation of mo-
lecular-based tests for diagnosis of infections with MTB and to rapid-
ly detect drug resistant tuberculosis (WHO, 2008; WHO, 2011; WHO,
2013). In regions with low M. tuberculosis endemicity the nearly ex-
clusive focus of commercially available assays on MTB with largely
neglecting NTM has slowed down the implementation of molecu-
lar-based diagnostics for replacement of culture in diagnostic
mycobacteriology. Any strategy to replace culture by molecular de-
tection assays in countries with low Mycobacterium tuberculosis en-
demicity has to address both MTB and NTM and to include
screening for susceptibility to first-line TB drugs. Switzerland, the
country where this study was conducted, is a low prevalence region,
with TB case rates of 6.6/100.000 in 2012 and b2% MDR/XDR
(Somoskövi et al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to compare
the performance of a combination of molecular assays for detection
of MTB, NTM and mutations associated with drug resistance in MTB
with that of culture-based methods.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Clinical Samples
All samples submitted to the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Uni-
versity of Zurich, for molecular detection of MTB or NTM were included
in this study. The study went over a period of 35 months and consisted
of 6875 clinical specimens (4928 respiratory and 1947 non-respiratory
specimens) originating from 3384 patients (Fig. 1). The 4928 respirato-
ry specimens consisted of sputum, n = 2917; tracheal bronchial aspi-
rate, n = 1145; bronchial alveolar lavage fluid, n = 724; bronchial
aspirate, n = 110; and others, n = 32. The 1947 non-respiratory speci-
mens consisted of aspirate, n = 663; tissue, n = 420; urine, n = 212;
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), n = 192; biopsy n = 82; wound swab, n =
75; lymph node, n = 83; gastric fluid, n = 34; bone marrow, n = 43;
ascites, n = 36; abscess, n = 20; stool n = 20; blood n = 29; non-spec-
ified, n = 10; bone, n = 9; ejaculate, n = 2; and others, n = 17. Consis-
tently, all samples were analyzed in parallel using culture-based
procedures and a modified COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB test (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) for direct detection of MTB and NTM. MTB PCR pos-
itive specimens were screened for mutations associated with resistance
to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) using the AID TB resistance line
probe assay module 1 (AID Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). If
resistance mutations were detected by LPA module 1, LPA modules 2
(streptomycin, amikacin, capreomycin) and 3 (fluoroquinolones, eth-
ambutol) were used for screening for mutations associated with resis-
tance to second-line drugs. At the time, this study was conducted, no
ethical approval was required to conduct a non-interventional laborato-
ry-based study.
2.2. Decontamination of Specimens, Microscopy, Culture, and Phenotypic
Drug Susceptibility Testing
Clinical specimens, with the exception of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and bone marrow were decontaminated using the N-acetyl-L-cyste-
ine-sodium
hydroxide
method.
CSF
and
bone
marrow
were
decontaminated using the SDS-NaOH method (Manual of Clinical
Microbiology, 2015). The resuspended sediment was used to prepare
auramine-rhodamine stained smears and to inoculate MGIT 960 liquid
broth medium (Becton Dickinson, Towson, MD) and Middlebrook
7H11 plate media for growth detection by incubation at 37 °C for a max-
imum of 7 weeks. Positive auramine-rhodamine microscopy results
were confirmed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Positive cultures were iden-
tified to species level by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as described
previously (see below). Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing to first-
line TB agents (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) was
done for all MTB isolates by using the MGIT 960 system as recommend-
ed by the manufacturer (Becton Dickinson, East Rutherford, NJ, USA).
Drug resistant MTB isolates were subsequently analyzed in detail by
quantitative drug susceptibility testing (QDST) using the MGIT 960 sys-
tem and the EpiCenter™ software equipped with the TBeXiST™ module
as described previously (Springer et al., 2009; Cambau et al., 2015).
2.3. Detection of Mycobacterial DNA
DNA was extracted from decontaminated samples using the respira-
tory specimen kit (Roche Diagnostics). The COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB
test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A
sample was categorized as positive when a PCR crossing point
(CP) b 45 was registered (Diagnostics, 2010). When no other MTB pos-
itive sample was recorded of a patient, a second DNA extract of the orig-
inal specimen was tested for confirmation. In case the second extract
was tested negative, culture was negative, smear was negative and no
further clinical information of the patient was available, the specimen
was reclassified as PCR negative. In our study only one such PCR positive
specimen (a sputum) was reclassified as negative.

 Based on previous studies we developed a Mycobacterium genus
probe for detection of NTM DNA in clinical specimens using
the COBAS™ TaqMan™ platform (Peter-Getzlaff et al., 2010). A Myco-
bacterium
genus
TaqMan™
probe
was
designed
(5′-Cy5-
CGACAAACCACCTACGAGCTCTTTACGC-BBQ-3′) and added (1 μl of a
10 μM stock solution) to the reaction mixture. The genus probe was de-
signed from a multiple sequence alignment of all known mycobacterial
16S rRNA gene sequences deposited with NCBI Genbank using
Lasergene DNAstar MegAlign software version 7. For the detection of
genus probe hybridization we used the open channel mode of the
COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB assay. For samples positive in the Mycobacteri-
um genus assay (CP b 45) the PCR amplicon was sequenced for species
identification. The Mycobacterium genus probe did not affect the sensi-
tivity of the MTB probe and was able to detect a wide range of fast-
and slow-growing mycobacteria (Tables S1, S2 and S3 in Supplemental
Materials).
2.4. Amplification, DNA Purification, and DNA Sequencing of Positive Sam-
ples and Cultures
Amplicons with a CP ≥ 45 or a maximum curve value b 0.5 in the
COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB assay and samples that scored positive in the
Mycobacterium genus assay (CP b 45) were purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and subject-
ed to 16S rRNA gene sequencing using primer Mbakt-14 (5′-GRG RTA
CTCGAG TGG CGA AC-3′) (Bosshard et al., 2006). SmartGene IDNS soft-
ware and databases (SmartGene GmbH, Zug, Switzerland) were used
for sequence analysis. Homology analysis and species identification
were carried out as described previously (Springer et al., 1996).
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from cultured isolates was done
using primers 283 and 264 for PCR amplification and primer Mbakt-
14 for sequencing. For cultured isolates, further sequence analysis of
the rpoB gene was used to distinguish between closely related species
within the Mycobacterium chelonae/abscessus complex or within the
Mycobacterium fortuitum complex (Adékambi et al., 2003); sequence
analysis of hsp65 was used for M. kansasii/gastri differentiation, and se-
quence analysis of the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA gene was used to differen-
tiate M. marinum from M. ulcerans (Hofer et al., 1993).
2.5. Molecular Detection of MTB Resistance Mutations
DNA extracts of samples positive in the COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB
assay were subjected to further analyses to identify mutations in the
rpoB, inhA and katG genes conferring resistance to isoniazid and rifampi-
cin, respectively. The AID TB reverse hybridization line probe assay (AID
Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany) was performed according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Ritter et al., 2014). This LPA assay de-
tects specific mutations in inhA promoter (positions −16, −15, −8),
in katG (codon 315) and in rpoB (codons 516, 526, 531). The absence
of hybridization of a wild-type probe and/or the presence of

 hybridization of a mutated gene probe suggests the presence of a geno-
typic resistance mutation. When any mutation in rpoB, inhA, and/or katG
was detected, the specimen was subsequently tested with AID TB resis-
tance LPAs module 2 (streptomycin, amikacin, capreomycin) and mod-
ule 3 (fluoroquinolones, ethambutol) (Ritter et al., 2014).
LPA module 2 contains probes for detection of streptomycin resis-
tance (rpsL mutations K43R, K88R, K88Q) and rrs mutations C513T,
A514C, G515C, and C517T (corresponding to Escherichia coli rrs posi-
tions 523, 524, 525, and 527, respectively), and for detection of amikacin
or capreomycin resistance (rrs mutations A1401G, C1402T, and
G1484C/T, corresponding to E. coli rrs positions 1408, 1409, and 1491,
respectively). LPA module 3 contains probes for detection of fluoroquin-
olone resistance (gyrA A90V, S91P, D94A, D94N, D94Y, and D94G) and
for detection of ethambutol resistance (embB M306V and M306I).
Each line probe module contained a M. tuberculosis probe as positive
control and a human GAPDH probe as amplification control. Results of
the line probe assay were scored as uninterpretable when the positive
MTB control did not show up or when high background signals were
observed.
2.6. Analysis of Molecular Results
The results of the genetic assays were compared to culture and phe-
notypic DST. In case of discrepancy, clinical data as well as laboratory
data from additional patient specimens were taken into consideration.
For discrepant results in module 1 versus phenotypic DST (isoniazid
and rifampicin) the target genes inhA promoter, inhA structural gene,
katG and rpoB were sequenced.
2.7. Case Definitions
For the purpose of the study the definitions are as follows:
1. Patients were defined as MTB positive when MTB culture and MTB
PCR were positive. Patients were scored MTB negative when all spec-
imens were negative by culture and PCR. In case of discrepant cul-
ture/PCR results patients' clinical data were reviewed to reach a
firm diagnosis. On basis of this definition sensitivity, specificity, pos-
itive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated.
2. NTM infections were identified by a positive NTM culture and/or My-
cobacterium genus positive/MTB negative PCR, if DNA sequence anal-
ysis revealed a pathogenic NTM. Clinical data were reviewed and
together with laboratory results from additional specimens were
used to resolve discrepant culture/PCR results and to establish the di-
agnosis of NTM infection supported by criteria as defined by the ATS
guidelines (Griffith et al., 2007). As inherent to a genus probe, this
probe also detects non-pathogenic NTM and species of closely relat-
ed genera, such as Corynebacterium (Peter-Getzlaff et al., 2010). Pa-
tients
were
scored
NTM
negative
when
culture
and
the
Mycobacterium genus PCR were negative or sequence analysis failed
to identify a pathogenic NTM. We used broadly cited literature to
classify NTM as pathogenic and non-pathogenic (Table 1) (Manual
of Clinical Microbiology, 2015).
3. DNA extracts of MTB PCR positive specimens were tested for the pres-
ence of mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid and rifampi-
cin using the AID TB resistance LPA module 1. When any mutation was
detected, the specimen was categorized as drug resistant. When only
wild-type probes were detected the isolate was categorized as drug
susceptible. For phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, susceptibility
was defined by the critical concentration (Springer et al., 2009).
2.8. Statistics
The 2 × 2 contingency table was used to calculate sensitivity, speci-
ficity, positive and negative predictive value. Cohen's kappa and chi-
squared tests were applied for calculating agreement and significance
in differences between results of different methods (Pagano and
Gavreau, 2000). The required study sample size to reach a confidence
level of 95% and a confidence interval of 0.5 was calculated to be 5921
samples using Survey Software (Creative Research Systems, Sebastopol,
CA, USA).
2.9. Role of the Funding Source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection,
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corre-
sponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final re-
sponsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
3. Results
During the 35-months period a total of 6875 respiratory and non-re-
spiratory specimens from 3384 patients were submitted to the
mycobacteriology laboratory for mycobacterial culture and PCR (Fig.

3.1. Detection of MTB by the COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB Assay and Compari-
son to Culture
The COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB PCR was inhibited in 333/6875 (4.8%)
specimens, negative in 6103/6875 (88.8%) specimens, and positive in
439/6875 (6.4%) specimens. Overall, MTB PCR and culture showed
97.7% concordant results (Fig. 1).
For the purpose of overall analysis we defined a patient as MTB posi-
tive when MTB culture and MTB PCR were positive. Patients were scored
MTB negative when all specimens were negative by PCR and culture. In
the case of discrepant culture/PCR results, patients' clinical data were
reviewed and test results from additional samples considered to reach a
firm diagnosis. Discrepant test results were observed for 150 samples
(71 PCR MTB pos., culture MTB neg., 25/71 specimens originated from pa-
tients without prior or ongoing TB therapy; 79 PCR MTB neg., culture MTB
pos.) corresponding to a total of 109 patients (Fig. 1). On the basis of the
results of parallel samples and clinical chart reviews (Tables S4 and S5 in
Supplemental Materials) none of the positive PCR or positive culture re-
sults was judged as false positive. Overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
NPV calculated for culture-based MTB detection were 86.3%, 100%,
100%, 98.8%, and for PCR-based MTB detection 84.7%, 100%, 100%, and
98.7%, respectively. Comparison of culture and PCR results showed that
for pulmonary TB, 5 patients would have been missed by culture and 9 pa-
tients would have been missed by PCR. For extrapulmonary TB, 9 patients
would have been missed by culture and 24 by PCR. Statistical analysis
using the chi-square test showed that these differences were not signifi-
cant [for pulmonary TB, χ2 (1, N = 34) = 1.964, p = 0.161, for extra pul-
monary TB, χ2 (1, N = 49) = 0.1351, p = 0.245].
3.2. Detection of NTM DNA by the Modified COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB Assay
and Comparison to Culture
Using the modified COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB assay, 1221/6875
(17.8%) clinical specimens tested positive with the Mycobacterium
genus probe (Fig. 2). A total of 782/1221 (64.0%) specimens tested pos-
itive with the Mycobacterium genus probe but were negative with the
MTB probe, pointing to the presence of NTM DNA. 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequence analysis was performed on all 782 Mycobacterium
genus positive/MTB negative PCRs. For 99/782 (12.7%) samples, DNA se-
quencing revealed species of closely related genera, such as Corynebac-
terium, for 72/782 (9.2%) samples no readable sequence was obtained.
All of these 171 samples were negative for NTM by culture.
In 611/782 (78.1%) specimens NTM was identified to species level.
For 218/611 (35.7%) specimens at least one NTM species was also recov-
ered by culture. In 191/218 (87.6%) specimens (107 smear positive) the
16S rRNA gene sequence of the NTM recovered by culture was identical
to the DNA sequence of the PCR amplicon obtained from the clinical
specimens (Table 1). 160 of the 191 NTM specimens (corresponding
to 67 patients) were considered to be clinically significant. In 27/218
NTM culture positive specimens, the NTM recovered by culture was dif-
ferent from the NTM identified by PCR (Fig. 2). Evaluation of the pa-
tients' clinical history showed that for 11/27 specimens (8 patients) a
clinical relevant NTM was identified by PCR and/or culture (Table S6
in Supplemental materials).
For 393/611 Mycobacterium genus PCR positive specimens with
proper NTM sequence identification, culture was negative for NTM
(Fig. 2). For 253/393 (64.6%) specimens the NTM sequence identified
corresponded either to a fast growing NTM considered an environmen-
tal contamination or to a species with no clinical relevance (Mycobacte-
rium gordonae). 130/253 16S rRNA sequences were assigned to a
defined NTM species (Table 1), 123/253 sequences could only be
assigned to the phylogenetic branch of rapidly growing NTMs with no
further species identification possible as a corresponding sequence
was not found in the database (Springer et al., 1996). Presumably,
these sequences represent environmental contaminants reflecting un-
known rapid growing mycobacteria. In 139/393 (35.4%) PCR NTM pos-
itive and culture negative specimens, the identified NTM sequence
corresponded to what was considered a pathogenic NTM (Table 1).
For 5/139 specimens, analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence allowed an as-
signment to the branch of slow growing mycobacterial species, but
could not be further differentiated and presumably correspond to

 potentially novel species (Tortoli, 2014). After review of the patients'
clinical charts, we conclude that 48/139 samples, obtained from 21 pa-
tients (19 respiratory diseases, 2 nonrespiratory disease) with a patho-
genic NTM species identified by NTM PCR but a negative culture, were
suggestive of a mycobacterial infection and clinically significant (Table
S7 in Supplemental materials). In 5/22 patients no other specimen
from the same patient recovered the respective pathogen by culture.
For 4/5 patients with negative cultures, 3 or more specimens had been
submitted for culture (Table S7 in Supplemental materials).
A total of 5321 specimens tested negative in the COBAS™ TaqMan™
Mycobacterium genus assay. 98/5321 (1.8%) specimens obtained from
78 patients were NTM culture positive with one or two NTMs (Table
1), no species assignment could be made for one NTM isolate on basis
of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Analysis of the patients' clinical history
indicated that 29/98 NTM isolates recovered were of clinical signifi-
cance; the 29 samples correspond to 18 patients (14 respiratory disease,
4 non respiratory disease), 2 of which were smear microscopy positive
(Table S8 in Supplemental Materials). For 5/18 patients the cultured
NTM was not detected by PCR in any equivalent specimen analyzed.
Overall, NTM PCR and culture showed 97.0% concordant results for
(potential) clinically relevant NTM (Fig. 2). Statistical analysis using
the chi-square test showed that the number of missed NTM patients
by culture (n = 5) or PCR (n = 5) were not significantly different [χ2
(1, N = 40) = 0.135, p = 0.714].
3.3. Direct Detection of Mutations Associated With Drug Resistance Using
the AID TB Resistance Line Probe Assay and Comparison to Phenotypic DST
In total, 438/439 PCR MTB positive specimens were analyzed by AID
TB resistance LPA (Table 2). The specimens consisted of 324 (73.9%) re-
spiratory and 114 (26.0%) non-respiratory specimens. 311/438 speci-
mens (71.0%) showed an interpretable result. Overall, 78.7% of the
respiratory and 49.1% of the non-respiratory specimens showed an in-
terpretable result. Of the 127 specimens with an uninterpretable result,
104 (81.9%) were smear-negative (58 respiratory specimen, 46 non-re-
spiratory specimens) and 23 (18.1%) were smear-positive (11 respira-
tory specimens, 12 non-respiratory specimens). 91.7% of the smear
positive samples gave an interpretable line probe result, as compared
to only 35.0% for smear negative samples.
The 438 specimens analyzed by the AID TB resistance LPA assay
were obtained from 253 patients (Table 3). For 195/253 (77.1%)
patients at least one specimen showed an interpretable result. For 58/
253 (22.9%) patients only uninterpretable LPA results were obtained
(Table 3). Calculating the percentage of uninterpretable results at pa-
tient level revealed this to be clearly dependent on the number of sam-
ples analyzed. 39/58 (67.2%) patients with an uninterpretable LPA
corresponded to patients for which only one specimen was tested, 14/
58 (24.1%) patients with an uninterpretable LPA originated from pa-
tients for which a total of 2 specimens were analyzed and only for 5/
58 (8.6%) patients with an uninterpretable LPA ≥ 3 clinical specimens
were tested.
For 239/253 (94.5%) patients at least one culture grew MTB allowing
phenotypic DST to be done. For the 58/253 patients with no interpret-
able LPA result, cultured DST was available for 56/58 patients – 54 pa-
tients had fully drug susceptible TB, 2 patients had monoresistance to
isoniazid (1 low-level INH resistance associated with an inhA-15 pro-
moter mutation, 1 high-level resistance associated with a katG S315T
mutation). Phenotypic DST was available for 183/195 (93.8%) patients
with an interpretable LPA result, allowing for a comparison of LPA
from clinical specimens and phenotypic DST from culture. 174/183
(95.1%) patients had wild-type test results for inhA, katG and rpoB in
the LPA assay indicating fully drug susceptible tuberculosis. This was
corroborated by phenotypic DST for 172/174 (98.9%) cultured isolates
(Table 4). 2/174 (1.1%) patients with wild-type pattern LPA showed
low-level resistance to INH (resistant at 0.1 mg/l, susceptible at
1.0 mg/l; Table S9 in Supplemental Materials). Sequencing of katG,
inhA structural gene and inhA promoter from the corresponding isolates
did not reveal any mutation. 9/183 (4.9%) patients had a mutation in
one or several of the target genes: 5 patients had a mutation in inhA
(n = 1) or katG (n = 4), 4 patients showed mutations in rpoB and
katG, indicating MDR. The phenotypic DST results were in full concor-
dance with the mutational analysis, including one specimen with a mu-
tation at rpoB codon 526 as indicated by failing hybridisation of the
wild-type probe in the LPA assay. Subsequent sequence analysis of the
corresponding cultural isolate revealed a His526Leu alteration
(Table S10 in Supplemental Materials). In one case, LPA missed
RMP resistance. However, as per the algorithm, this resistant isolate
would not have been missed due to the simultaneous presence of a
katG S315 T mutation. The strain showed a 9 base pair deletion at co-
dons 509–511 by rpoB gene sequencing (Table S9 in Supplemental
Materials). Overall, LPA and phenotypic DST results for INH and
RMP were congruent for 180/183 (98.4%) patients (Table 4). Com-
parison of RIF and INH molecular screening results with phenotypic
DST results shows a high Cohen's kappa of agreement, i.e., κ 0.886
and κ 0.894, respectively.
AID TB resistance LPA modules 2 or 3 were done on all clinical spec-
imens which showed a mutation in LPA module 1 (n = 9). As per the
genetic analysis 0/9 specimens was pre-XDR or XDR (gyrA probe was
wild-type, rrs probes 1401, 1402 and 1484 were wild-type). Mutations
associated with streptomycin resistance were detected in 5/9 speci-
mens, 3/9 specimens showed mutations associated with ethambutol re-
sistance. One isolate showed a mutation in embB (codon M306 V) but
was susceptible to ethambutol at the critical concentration of 5 mg/l.
Two isolates were resistant to streptomycin at the critical concentration
of 1 mg/l, but by LPA had no identifiable mutation in the rpsL or rrs tar-
get gene. For a complete overview of the LPA results and QDST on these
isolates see Table S10 in the Supplemental materials.

 4. Discussion
Conventional methods for detection of mycobacteria include smear
microscopy (AFB) and isolation by culture followed by phenotypic
DST. However, smear microscopy lacks both sensitivity and specificity,
and culture-based detection methods are time-consuming with a turn-
around time of 2–4 weeks for initial culture and an additional 1–
2 weeks for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing of first-line TB
drugs (Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 2015). Nucleic acid-based de-
tection of mycobacteria and identification of resistance mutations by
PCR based assays significantly shorten overall time-to-result to 1–
2 days. Although molecular based methods are associated with substan-
tial costs per test, these methods may in principle reduce the need for
costly high-safety laboratories. In addition, the shortening of time-to-
result has major implications in patient management, thereby reducing
health care-associated costs.
In the first part of our study we evaluated the performance of PCR
based detection of M. tuberculosis in patients' specimens in comparison
to culture (Fig. 1). Discrepant culture/PCR results were resolved by eval-
uating clinical data, the patients' clinical history and the availability of
additional patient specimens that were analyzed by culture and PCR.
The final outcome of these analyses shows that for pulmonary TB dis-
ease 5 patients would have been missed by culture alone and 9 patients
would have been missed by PCR alone. Statistical analysis showed that
this difference is not significant (p N 0.05), testifying that PCR and cul-
ture have a similar sensitivity in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis
in patients with pulmonary TB. For extrapulmonary TB, 9 patients
were missed by culture and 24 patients were missed by PCR. Detection
of extrapulmonary TB is often limited by the availability of b3 speci-
mens per patient. Using the chi-square test the difference between
PCR and culture-based detection of NTM was shown not to be signifi-
cant, indicating a similar sensitivity of PCR and culture for diagnosing
extrapulmonary TB. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV at
specimen level (including respiratory and non-respiratory specimens)
were calculated for culture-based MTB detection as 86.3%, 100%, 100%,
and 98.8%; the corresponding values for PCR-based MTB detection
were 84.7%, 100%, 100%, and 98.7%.
The second part of this study evaluated the detection of NTM in clin-
ical specimens by PCR in comparison to culture (Fig. 2). Here we used
the Roche COBAS™ MTB assay supplemented with an additional pan
Mycobacterium genus probe. The Mycobacterium genus probe is highly
sensitive but compromised by limited specificity requiring subsequent
confirmation testing, i.e., sequence analysis of the PCR amplicon. Due
to its high sensitivity, the Mycobacterium genus probe readily detects
contaminating DNA from environmental NTM present in laboratory
chemicals and/or non-sterile specimens (especially sputum). The large
number of NTM PCR positive specimens which were negative by culture
(n = 393, of which n = 139 represent pathogenic NTM) is in part ex-
plained by the optimization of established cultural procedures towards
recovery of MTB rather than NTM (Manual of Clinical Microbiology,
2015).
As is true for any environmental or opportunistic pathogen the mere
finding of an NTM does not establish disease. For NTM, pathogenicity is
largely a species-specific trait (Tortoli, 2014). Many of the environmen-
tal contaminants are readily identified by species assignment as unlike
pathogens, e.g. M. gordonae and most of the rapid growers (Table 1).
Guidelines issued by ATS/IDSA have summarized the criteria which es-
tablish the clinical significance of an NTM (Griffith et al., 2007). These
criteria include: (i) species identified, (ii) positive smear microscopy,
(iii) detection in multiple patients' specimens, and (iv) clinical history.
Discordant results between culture and PCR results in our study were
resolved by evaluation of the patients' clinical history and the availabil-
ity of additional patients' specimens analyzed (Tables S6, S7 and S8 in
Supplemental materials). The results show that diagnosis of NTM by
culture would have missed 5 patients and that PCR would have missed
5 patients (Fig. 2), which was shown as a non-significant difference by
statistical analysis. These results testify that PCR and culture exhibit
comparable sensitivity in detecting clinically relevant NTM disease.
The significant workload associated with the interpretation of positive
genus PCR results – not the least DNA sequence analysis of the amplicon
– is compensated by the faster time-to-result (approximately 2 days in-
cluding decontamination of the sample) in comparison with culture (1–
3 weeks, especially for slow growing NTM) and by the prospects to pos-
sibly replace resource-costly cultural detection methods in diagnostic
mycobacteriology by molecular screening.
In the third part of this study we evaluated the performance of the
AID TB resistance line probe assay (LPA) to rapidly identify drug suscep-
tible MTB in clinical samples that were MTB PCR positive. Our results
show an excellent performance of the AID TB resistance line probe
assay for smear positive samples (respiratory and non-respiratory spec-
imens, Tables 2 and 3). Inherently, the line probe assay as a multiplex
PCR is less sensitive than the COBAS™ TaqMan™ MTB PCR. Consequent-
ly, of the 438 specimens positive in the MTB PCR assay, only 311 (71.0%)
gave an interpretable LPA result. Increasing the number of MTB PCR
positive samples subjected to LPA analysis increases the likelihood of
an interpretable result. This is possible as the specificity of the LPA is ex-
ceptionally high (N99%). The results of molecular DST of clinical speci-
mens and phenotypic DST on isolates recovered by culture showed an
excellent concordance of 98.5%. Overall the data indicate that treatment
of drug-susceptible TB can be initiated based on genotypic resistance
results.
We observed a number of minor discrepancies when comparing mo-
lecular with phenotypic DST (Table 4; Table S10 in Supplemental mate-
rials). 2 isolates showed an isolated low-level INH resistance and no
mutation in inhA or katG – neither by LPA nor by gene sequencing.
One isolate had a wild-type rpoB LPA result but was resistant to rifampi-
cin at 1.0 mg/l, the corresponding deletion of 9 bps in rpoB was not de-
tected by the LPA. Given the current limitations of molecular DST and
the in part controversial discussions on genotype – phenotype relation-
ships, resistant LPA results should be confirmed phenotypically to iden-
tify possible discrepancies, e.g. some mutations are missed in MGIT
critical concentration testing, nonsynonymous mutation in LPA targets
may result in a false resistance result (Van Deun et al., 2009; Plinke et
al., 2011; Sirgel et al., 2012a; Sirgel et al., 2012b; Sirgel et al., 2013;
Böttger, 2011; Kaswa et al., 2014). We deliberately decided to use
screening for mutations in inhA, katG, and rpoB by LPA as a surrogate
marker of any type of drug resistance. Any isolate with a mutation
found in inhA, katG, or rpoB is categorized as drug resistant and is

 suspect of MDR/XDR until ruled out. Based on this interpretation of LPA
results, LPA readily separated drug-susceptible wild-type MTB from
drug-resistant MTB isolates.
In principle, the screening for any type of drug resistance by
searching for mutations in inhA, katG, and rpoB would allow to limit
phenotypic DST to isolates with a mutation identified in inhA, katG,
and rpoB. Limiting phenotypic DST to isolates with a mutation identified
in inhA, katG, or rpoB would miss PZA and EMB monoresistance and INH
and RIF resistance mutations not covered by LPA. Available evidence
suggests that monoresistance to PZA, EMB, or INH has little, if any, effect
on treatment outcome (Cattamanchi et al., 2009; Singla et al., 2002; Yee
et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2016). In contrast, resistance to RIF is a major rea-
son for treatment failure and poor clinical outcome (Mitchison and
Nunn, 1986; Winston and Mitruka, 2012). We retrospectively analyzed
all M. tuberculosis isolates from 2007 to 2015 (n = 2616) which are kept
in a curated strain collection at the Institute of Medical Microbiology,
University of Zurich. For all of these isolates the results of first-line
agent critical concentration testing are available as are the results of
quantitative drug susceptibility testing for isolates tested resistant at
the critical concentration (Springer et al., 2009; Cambau et al., 2015).
In addition, all isolates tested as resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, eth-
ambutol, or pyrazinamide were subjected to LPA. During this period,
LPA would have missed 2 cases of isolated PZA resistance, 1 case of iso-
lated EMB resistance, and 7/76 cases of isolated INH resistance (50/76
isolates were high-level isoniazid resistant with MICs N 1.0 mg/l, 26/
76 isolates were low-level isoniazid resistant with MICs b 1.0 mg/l;
the 7/76 missed cases of isoniazid resistance were all low-level resistant
with no mutation detected by LPA in inhA or katG). None of the 12 cases
of isolated RIF resistance and none of the MDR/XDR cases (n = 84)
would have been missed.
In summary, by consequently analyzing all clinical samples submit-
ted to our diagnostic mycobacteriology laboratory over a three year pe-
riod this study demonstrates that molecular diagnostics may largely
replace culture for screening of mycobacterial infections and for rapid
recognition of drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis disease. Based on the re-
sults of this study we propose an algorithm to implement high-through-
put diagnostic molecular screenings in countries with a low prevalence
of M. tuberculosis infections (Fig. 3). Samples submitted to the clinical
laboratory for the detection of mycobacterial infections, including MTB
and NTM, are screened on the basis of 16S rRNA gene amplification. Dif-
ferentiation between MTB and NTM is made by using two probes, one
MTB specific probe and one pan mycobacterial (genus) probe. A positive
MTB PCR assay is subsequently complemented by an LPA to detect mu-
tations associated with resistance against first-line drugs (katG, inhA,
rpoB). When any mutation is found in inhA, katG or rpoB the specimen
is subjected to a full work-up for proper characterization of the isolate's
resistance profile, including further LPA, DNA sequencing of target
genes, and culture for phenotypic QDST. When identifying a putative
novel resistance mutation by DNA sequencing, it is essential to assess
the phenotypic QDST results to clarify the role of the mutation – care
must be taken not to mix up genetic polymorphisms with resistance
mutations (Feuerriegel et al., 2010). A positive NTM screening assay as
per the genus probe is followed by sequencing of the PCR amplicon
(this study), or alternatively an NTM LPA, to separate clinically relevant
NTM from environmental contaminations and NTM with no clinical rel-
evance or closely related genera such as Corynebacterium.
As per the diagnostic algorithm, culture is a must for 1. any MTB PCR
positive specimen with a resistance mutation identified in inhA, katG or
rpoB to allow for full phenotypic QDST and additional epidemiological
investigations, 2. any MTB patient where no interpretable LPA has
been obtained, 3. any specimen with a clinical relevant NTM to allow
for phenotypic DST. Besides this, the algorithm is flexible and the re-
quirements for culture can be adapted as per the laboratories' experi-
ence and needs, e.g. defined samples (e.g. biopsies, samples from
retreatment cases) or samples with known limited sensitivity for mo-
lecular-based tests (e.g. CSF, bone marrow) can be subjected to culture.

 Culture of MTB PCR positive samples with a susceptible LPA result may
not be required when a PCR for differentiation within the M. tuberculosis
complex is implemented – Mycobacterium bovis is naturally resistant to
pyrazinamide (Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 2015). A limitation of
our study is the little numbers of resistant MTB encountered in the
35 months period. In addition, detection of heteroresistance is a chal-
lenge for genetics-based tests (Streicher et al., 2012; Folkvardsen et
al., 2013). Compared to MDR TB which is mostly transmitted (N95%),
de-novo acquisition of resistance during treatment is more frequent
for second-line drugs (Streicher et al., 2012).
As long as the discrepancies between phenotypic and molecular DST
exist (see above), phenotypic QDST is a mainstay in proper characteri-
zation of an isolates' drug susceptibility profile. As is, the speed and eas-
iness of LPAs to screen for a molecular indication of any type of
resistance combined with the possibility for a preliminary determina-
tion of an isolate's resistance profile where required, is hard to match
by any other available technique. Clearly, molecular DST would profit
from development of assays as specific and versatile as LPA but as sen-
sitive as single target PCRs, eliminating the need to analyse more than
one MTB PCR sample for reliable molecular DST results.
