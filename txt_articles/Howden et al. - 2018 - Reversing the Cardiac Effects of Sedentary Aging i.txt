BACKGROUND: Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart 
failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The 
development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely 
mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence 
of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized 
controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-
intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.
METHODS: Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged 
participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of 
exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart 
catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed 
with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume 
relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by 
curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake  
(Vo
.
2max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.
RESULTS: Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to 
prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo
.
2max increased by 18% 
(exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 
to post 28.7±5.4, group×time P<0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced 
(right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; 
preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise 
training 0.051±0.0268, P=0.0018), whereas there was no change in 
controls (group×time P<0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to 
post 0.062±0.031, P=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume 
(group×time P<0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 
unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure 
(loading×group×time P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 
2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and 
decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide 
protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved 
ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness 
attributable to sedentary aging.

S
edentary aging is strongly associated with delete-
rious changes in cardiovascular function, including 
an increase in left ventricular (LV) stiffness.1 Seden-
tary seniors have small stiff LVs, which are comparable 
to patients with heart failure with a preserved ejec-
tion fraction (HFpEF).2 In contrast, competitive Masters 
athletes have large, compliant LVs equivalent to much 
younger individuals,3 suggesting that exercise train-
ing, performed at a very high level over a lifetime, may 
counteract the detrimental effects of aging and inactiv-
ity on the LV.
Although competitive Masters athletes are a useful 
model for characterizing the upper limits of cardiovas-
cular protection from prolonged exercise training, the 
volume of training performed by these individuals (≥6 
days/wk plus competitions) is not feasible for the gen-
eral population. Although it appears that 4 to 5 days of 
committed exercise training over decades is adequate 
to achieve most of this benefit,4 it is unclear whether 
exercise training can restore or improve LV compliance 
in previously sedentary individuals, and if so, when is 
the optimal stage of life to intervene.
Epidemiological studies show that a measurement 
of fitness in middle age is the strongest predictor of 
future heart failure.5–7 Moreover, in observational stud-
ies, the dose of exercise associated with reduced heart 
failure incidence is much higher than that associated 
with reduced mortality.8 However, if exercise is started 
too late in life (ie, after 65 years) in sedentary individu-
als, there is little effect on LV stiffness.9,10 Thus, a life-
time of sedentary aging is associated with a reduction 
of cardiac plasticity, which cannot be overcome with 
a year of moderate-intensity exercise training. We re-
cently documented that this LV stiffening begins to be 
identifiable during middle age with a leftward shift in 
the LV end-diastolic pressure volume curve.11 We hy-
pothesize that middle-aged hearts retain some degree 
of cardiac plasticity and may represent a more optimal 
time to intervene with aggressive lifestyle modification 
aimed at improving cardiac stiffness.
Based on these observations and the growing body 
of literature on the benefits of high-intensity interval 
training,12,13 we hypothesized that an optimized exer-
cise prescription (≥4 days/wk including high-intensity 
interval training) initiated in middle age may be an ef-
fective strategy to prevent LV stiffening, a key patho-
physiologic characteristic of HFpEF. Therefore, we 
sought to determine the effects of 2 years of supervised 
exercise training on LV compliance and distensibility in 
previously sedentary, middle-aged individuals.
METHODS
Participant Population and Study Design 
This study was a prospective, parallel group, randomized con-
trolled 2-year exercise training study. Sixty-one healthy, sed-
entary middle-aged (45–64 years) participants were recruited 
from the Dallas Heart Study,14 employees at Texas Health 
Resources and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center, and through local media. For the latter, emails and 
electronic newsletters were distributed to staff at Texas 
Health Resources and the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center. In brief, Texas Health Resources has ≈20 
500 
employees. Emails were sent to all employees in a staggered 
fashion (ie, the first half or the alphabet followed by the sec-
ond half of the alphabet ≈1 month later). Three rounds of 
emails were sent between September 2012 and February 
2014. Employees from the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center responded to a call for participants posted in 
a weekly institute-wide email circulated to all staff and stu-
dents. In addition, local newspapers and online media pub-
lished articles on the benefits of exercise that referred to the 
trial and included contact information for interested readers. 
Two hundred sixty-two individuals expressed interest in partic-
ipating in the study and underwent screening (Figure 1). After 
obtaining informed consent, all participants were rigorously 
screened for comorbidities, and were excluded if any of the 
following conditions were present: hypertension (use of anti-
hypertensive medication or ambulatory systolic blood pres-
sure >135 mm 
Hg), body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, untreated 
hypo- or hyperthyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, tobacco use during past 10 
years, coronary artery disease, or structural heart disease. 
Participants were also excluded if they reported a consistent 
exercise history that involved exercising for >30 minutes, 3 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Poor fitness in middle age is a strong predictor of 
future risk of heart failure and is associated with 
increased cardiac stiffness, a potential precursor to 
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
• However, waiting until heart failure develops or 
older age cements the effects of a sedentary life-
style may be too late.
• This study demonstrates that prolonged (2 years) 
exercise training, initiated in middle age, can fore-
stall the deleterious effects of sedentary aging by 
reducing cardiac stiffness and increasing fitness.
• These results provide a mechanistic underpinning 
and substantial evidence in support of physical 
activity guidelines.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Lifestyle modification with an optimized exercise 
program including high-intensity and moderate-
intensity exercise training is an effective strategy to 
reverse the effects of sedentary aging on the heart.
• Findings support the need for future prospective 
studies to evaluate the role of exercise training in 
specific populations at risk of developing heart fail-
ure with a preserved ejection fraction.

times/wk or more. A detailed medical history, physical exami-
nation, echocardiogram, and exercise stress test for detection 
of ischemia were performed before participants were enrolled 
in the study. Eligible participants were randomly assigned 
by using block randomization by a statistician (B.A.-H.), to 
either exercise training (ExT) or a balance and flexibility (yoga) 
control group (control). The ratio was 1.2 ExT to 1 control, 
because of an expected higher attrition in the ExT group 
(see sample size calculation below), and groups were strati-
fied by sex. The experimental procedures were explained to 
all participants, with informed consent obtained as approved 
by the institutional review boards of the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian 
Hospital Dallas. All procedures conformed to the standards 
set by the Declaration of Helsinki. This trial was registered 
on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02039154) and was overseen by 
an independent data safety and monitoring board. The data, 
analytic methods, and study materials will not be made avail-
able to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the 
results or replicating the procedure.
Sample Size Calculation 
The primary outcome variable was the change in ventricular 
chamber stiffness after 2 years of exercise training. Sample 
size calculations were based on the difference between indi-
vidually calculated mean stiffness constants of our previous 
work, which characterized the effects of aging on LV stiff-
ness.11 Based on these findings, we assumed a significant 
difference in stiffness constant of 24 U with a standard devia-
tion of 30 U, and a within-participant correlation of ρ=0.6 
in a 2-factor (intervention and evaluation time) mixed-model 
repeated-measures design (intervention is the between-
group factor, time is repeated) from before to after 2 years 
of training. Based on the required between-groups difference 
and assuming that there would be no change in LV stiffness 
in controls, with an α-error of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we 
required 21 participants per group to be adequately powered 
to address our hypothesis.
Intervention
Exercise Training 
The ExT program followed a periodized approach, where 
increases in training frequency, duration, and intensity pro-
gressed over time. Each participant was provided with an 
individualized training plan. Exercise physiologists met with 
participants monthly throughout the intervention. The major-
ity of monthly meetings were conducted in person; however, 
if this was not logistically possible, meetings were conducted 
electronically. During the initial training phase, exercise physiol-
ogists directly supervised many exercise sessions with the goal 
of educating participants about the different type of sessions 
and providing support and guidance to build self-confidence, 
develop self-efficacy to facilitate the independent completion 
of the exercise program. During monthly consults, exercise 
physiologists discussed the individual’s progress, reviewed 
adherence to the intervention, and noted any issues (eg, mus-
culoskeletal injuries, acute illness). The majority of exercise ses-
sions throughout the training program were not supervised, 
although every session was carefully tracked using heart rate 
(HR) monitors. To individualize training intensity, the maximal 
steady state (MSS) zone was first determined from the ven-
tilatory and lactate thresholds measured during the maximal 
exercise test as previously described.15 Based on the MSS HR 
and peak HR (HRpeak), 4 training zones were established for 
each participant: (1) MSS; (2) base pace (1–20 beats below

ization, and retention of study

MSS); (3) interval (>95% HR peak); and recovery (<base pace). 
The early training phase (month 1–2) focused on establishing 
an endurance base and regular exercise routine with partici-
pants performing 3, 30-minute base pace sessions per week. 
As participants acclimated to the training, MSS sessions were 
added starting with 2 sessions per month during the second 
month and increasing to 3 sessions in month 3. In the third 
month, aerobic intervals consisting 4×4 interval sessions (4 
minutes of exercise at 95% peak HR followed by 3 minutes of 
active recovery at 60%–75% peak HR, repeated 4 times) were 
incorporated.16 A recovery day consisting of 20 to 30 minutes 
of walking or light aerobic activity followed each interval day. 
By the sixth month, participants were training 5 to 6 hours 
per week, including 2 interval sessions, and 1 long (at least an 
hour) and one 30-minute base pace session each week. This 
training load was maintained for 4 months. After completion 
of the 10-month progression, exercise capacity was retested 
and then participants began the maintenance training phase. 
Training zones were adjusted to reflect the results of the most 
recent exercise test. During this period, participants performed 
only 1 interval session per week plus continuous training. 
Participants were encouraged to use a variety of exercise 
equipment (eg, stationary cycle ergometer, treadmill, elliptical 
trainer) or perform exercise sessions outdoors (eg, running on 
trails, cycling, swimming) to ensure participant enjoyment and 
to avoid overuse injuries. To supplement the endurance train-
ing, 2 weekly strength training sessions were prescribed. These 
sessions were designed to focus on whole body functional and 
core strength to complement the endurance training.
Balance and Flexibility Training (Control) 
The balance and flexibility group was prescribed a combi-
nation of yoga, balance, and strength training 3 times per 
week for 2 years. Participants attended group yoga or stretch-
ing classes, or completed online or video classes at home. 
Participants were asked to refrain from attending hot yoga 
classes or completing prolonged endurance activities. This 
prescription allowed for a similar level of interaction with 
research staff between both groups.
To that end, each participant (ExT group and control 
group) was assigned an exercise physiologist who monitored 
their training compliance throughout the 2-year intervention. 
An exercise log and heart rate monitor (Polar) were used to 
monitor training compliance. Training load was quantified by 
the training impulse.17 Specific training impulse calculations 
for continuous and interval training were used.18 The mean 
monthly training load is presented in Figure I in the online-
only Data Supplement.
Measurements
Exercise Testing 
Measurements of maximal oxygen uptake were performed 
with a modified Astrand-Saltin protocol involving incremental 
exercise on a treadmill, at baseline, 10 months (after the peak 
training phase), and at 2 years by using the Douglas bag tech-
nique; gas fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and 
ventilatory volumes were analyzed by a Tissot spirometer, as 
previously reported.3 Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo
.
2max) was 
defined as the highest oxygen uptake measured from at least 
a 30-second Douglas bag.
Echocardiography 
LV images were obtained by 3-dimensional echocardiography 
(iE33; Phillips Medical System) at all loading conditions during 
the invasive study. LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) was ana-
lyzed offline (Qlab 9.0; Phillips) by an experienced cardiologist 
who was blinded to filling pressures. LVEDV was scaled to 
body size (LVEDV index). The typical error of the LV volume 
measurement in our laboratory, expressed as a coefficient of 
variation, was 10% (95% confidence interval, 8%–12%).
Total Blood Volume 
Total blood volume was measured using the carbon monoxide 
rebreathing method, modified from that described by Burge 
and Skinner,19 and has been reported in detail previously.20
Body Composition 
Body density and composition were determined by underwa-
ter weighing with correction for residual lung volume.21
Right Heart Catheterization 
Right heart catheterization was performed before and after 
the 2-year intervention. A 6F Swan-Ganz catheter was placed 
under fluoroscopic guidance through an antecubital vein and 
advanced into the pulmonary artery. The wedge position of 
the catheter was confirmed by both fluoroscopy and the pres-
ence of typical waveforms. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressure (PCWP) and right atrial pressure were determined 
visually at end expiration using an electronic data measure-
ment system (BIOPAC Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA).
Hemodynamics 
Cardiac output (Qc) was determined by the rebreathing tech-
nique with acetylene as the soluble gas and helium as the 
insoluble gas22 as the primary measure of Qc; in a few sub-
jects who experienced technical difficulty with the rebreathing 
maneuver, Qc was calculated from thermodilution. Stroke vol-
ume (SV) was calculated from Qc and HR. Total arterial com-
pliance was determined by the ratio of SV and pulse pressure 
to evaluate central aortic function. Effective arterial elastance 
was defined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure over SV23 
with end-systolic pressure estimated by use of the single-beat 
method as previously described and validated.24
Experimental Protocol
After 20 minutes of quiet rest, serial hemodynamic mea-
surements (eg, Qc, blood pressure, and HR) were performed 
to establish a stable baseline. Lower body negative pres-
sure was then used to decrease cardiac filling as previously 
reported.3,9,25 Measurements including HR, PCWP
, right atrial 
pressure, blood pressure, LVEDV, and Qc were performed 
after 5 minutes each of –15 mm 
Hg and –30 mm 
Hg lower 
body negative pressure. The lower body negative pressure 
was then released. Thereafter, baseline measurements were 
repeated, and the cardiac filling pressure was measured after 
rapid infusion (≈200 mL/min) of warm (37°C) isotonic saline. 
Measurements were repeated after 10 to 15 mL/kg and 20 to 
30 mL/kg of saline infusion had been infused.
Assessment of Cardiac Catheterization Data 
In each participant, a LV end-diastolic pressure-volume rela-
tionship was constructed by using the PCWP and scaled LVEDV 
index obtained at each stage of the preload manipulation,

as previously reported.4,10 A constant for LV chamber stiff-
ness (stiffness being the inverse of compliance) was modeled 
using commercially available software (SigmaPlot version 13.0,

the following exponential equation26: =

where P is PCWP
, P∞ is pressure asymptote of the curve, V is 
LVEDV, V0 is the equilibrium volume at which P is assumed to

Hg, and a is the constant that characterizes chamber 
stiffness. Modeling was performed for each individual partici-
pant, at baseline and repeated after 2 years. The averages of 
the individual LV chamber stiffness constants for all the par-
ticipants within each group are reported and denoted as indi-
vidual stiffness. To characterize the overall groups in terms of 
pressure-volume curves prior to initiating either intervention 
and after completion of 2 years follow-up–post intervention, 
a single curve was also fit to the data that were derived from 
the means of each loading condition, which are referred to as 
group curves. Because external constraint influences ventricu-
lar volumes and pressure, LV end-diastolic transmural pres-
sure-volume relationships were constructed using estimated 
transmural pressure (PCWP-right atrial pressure).27 Transmural 
stiffness constants were modeled as described above. PCWP 
and SV data were used to construct Frank-Starling relation-
ships. The SV, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and 3-dimensional 
LVEDV data were used to construct preload recruitable stroke 
work relationships (PRSW=[SV×MAP]/LVEDV). The slope of this 
relationship was used as an index of global systolic function.28
Statistical Analysis 
Continuous variables are expressed as mean, 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs), and categorical variables are expressed 
as n (%). The primary analysis included all participants who 
completed the 2-year follow-up. Continuous end points were 
compared between groups by using mixed-effects model 
repeated-measures analysis. The repeated-measures models 
included the intervention group factor (control versus ExT), 
a repeated factor for study visits, and a group×visit interac-
tion term; the study participant was modeled as a random 
effect. The difference in response between control and ExT 
groups was assessed via the interaction effect. Pairwise com-
parisons were made using the least square contrasts derived 
from these mixed-effects models. Based on prior observations 
of sex differences in response to exercise training,15 we per-
formed a post hoc analysis to explore the impact of sex on 
exercise capacity (Vo

2max), LVEDV, and LV stiffness. Random-
effects linear regression models with quadratic terms were 
used to model the relationships in the PCWP and transmu-
ral pressure–volume curves and Frank-Starling curves and to 
compare group responses with tests of interactions between 
group and independent variables. The covariance structure 
for mixed-effects models was selected based on Akaike 
Information Criteria and model parsimony. A 2-sided P value 
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analysis 
was performed using SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Two-hundred sixty-two participants were screened 
and assessed for eligibility to participate in this study 
between August 2012 and February 2014. Of these, 
61 participants were randomly assigned (see Figure 1 
for Consort diagram and a detailed description in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The participant charac-
teristics are summarized in Table 1. The 2 groups ex-
hibited similar clinical characteristics including age, sex, 
ambulatory blood pressure, BMI, and maximal oxygen 
uptake. In total, 53 participants completed the 2-year 
study, 28 in the ExT group and 25 in the control group.
The primary reason for withdrawal from the study was 
related to either work or family commitments (n=3) 
 
or personal reasons (n=4). One participant withdrew 
immediately after completion of the pretesting before 
initiating any intervention.
Compliance With Prescribed ExT
Participants in the ExT group maintained excellent com-
pliance with the 2-year exercise intervention (mean 
88±11%). Six participants maintained almost perfect 
compliance to the prescribed training (completing 
≥97% of prescribed sessions).
Effect of Exercise Intervention
We observed a classic training response in the ExT 
group. Maximal oxygen uptake increased in response 
to the progressive exercise load from month 1 to 9, 
before remaining stable during the maintenance train-
ing phase. Overall, the intervention resulted in a signif-
icant increase in Vo

Resting Supine Hemodynamics
The effect of the exercise intervention on resting he-
modynamic variables is summarized in Table 2. ExT in-
creased supine resting SV, causing a decrease in HR and 
maintenance of Qc. Blood pressure was unchanged in 
either group. There was an increase in arterial compli-
ance and reduction in arterial elastance in both groups, 
which was statistically significant in the ExT group.
LV Pressure-Volume Curves
Individual stiffness constants and group mean LV 
pressure-volume relationships are shown in Figure 4A 
through 4D for all participants who completed the 
follow-up visit. Two-years of exercise training signifi-
cantly reduced individual LV and myocardial stiffness 
constants, with no change observed in the control par-
ticipants (Figure 4A, group×time P=0.040, control, time 
P=0.83, ExT, time P=0.0018; Figure 4B, group × time 
P=0.0247; control, time P=0.41; ExT, time P=0.0158). 
There was a significant group×time interaction for the 
PCWP and TMP pressure-volume curves (P<0.0001, 
P=0.004, respectively; Figure 4C and 4D). The PCWP 
and TMP pressure-volume curves were not significantly 
altered in the control group (P=0.933, P=0.602, re-
spectively). In contrast, in the ExT group, PCWP and 
TMP pressure-volume curves were shifted to the right 
and downward (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, respectively). 
ExT increased LVEDV (ExT 7.1 (95% CI, 5.6–8.6) mL/
m2 versus control group, –1.0 [95% CI, –3.0 to 1.0]), 
whereas PCWP was unchanged (group×time P<0.001), 
allowing for greater SV for any given filling pressure

in the ExT group (pre/post ExT, P=0.001 and control, 
P=0.644; loading condition×group×time P=0.0075; 
Figure 5A and 5B). Thus, 2 years of training resulted in 
an upward shift in the Starling curves, driven primar-
ily by an increase in heart size. Furthermore, heart rate 
was lower in the ExT group, across the range of filling 
pressure following training (4–6 beats lower; loading 
condition×group×time P=0.064; Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement). Neither ExT nor sedentary ag-
ing changed global systolic function, measured as the 
slope of preload recruitable stroke work (group×time 
P=0.68, time P=0.90; Figures 5C and 5D).
Sex Differences
Post hoc analysis suggests that in contrast to prior ob-
servations, the response to ExT was not modified by 
sex for Vo
.
2max (sex×group×time P=0.74), LVEDV in-
dex (sex×group×time P=0.50), or LV stiffness constant 
(sex×group×time P=0.10). These observations should 
be interpreted with caution because our study was not 
adequately powered to make distinctions by sex.
DISCUSSION
This study is the longest, prospective randomized con-
trolled trial that has documented the physiological ef-
fects of supervised, structured ExT in a group of seden-
tary but healthy middle-aged adults. The key finding is 
that 2 years of exercise training performed for at least 
30 minutes, 4 to 5 days per week, and including at 
least 1 high-intensity interval session per week results 
in a significant reduction in LV chamber and myocardial 
stiffness. The use of high-resolution, invasively mea-
sured LV pressure-volume curves and comparison with 
an attention control group enhances the confidence in 
this conclusion. This study also demonstrated that ExT 
can be adhered to by middle-aged adults over a pro-
longed period, suggesting that this may be an effective 
strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of sedentary 
aging on the heart and forestall the development of 
HFpEF.
Optimized ExT Program Enhances 
Maximal Exercise Capacity and LV 
Structure and Function
We used a periodized ExT program that incorporated 
a progressive increase in training load (preparatory pe-
riod), followed by a peak and maintenance training peri-
ods. This training approach is routinely used by competi-
tive athletes,29,30 but has not been used in exercise-naïve 
participants in a controlled manner. Consistent with 
current physical activity guidelines,31 participants were

prescribed a combination of high-, moderate-, and low-
intensity aerobic exercise equating to ≈150 to 180 min-
utes per week. In response to this training stimulus, we 
observed a classical physiological response, where maxi-
mal oxygen uptake was markedly increased, resting HR 
was reduced, and LVEDV was expanded. Epidemiologi-
cal evidence suggests that each 1–metabolic equivalent 
increase in exercise capacity is associated with a 13% 
and 15% reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality.32 Furthermore, higher fitness levels in 
middle age are associated with a reduced risk of heart 
failure.5–7,33 Lower resting HR is also associated with re-
ductions in mortality, independent of objectively mea-
sured fitness levels.34 Thus, 2 years of exercise training 
at a frequency of 4 to 5 days per week had considerable 
cardiovascular benefits and may improve longevity and 
prevent the development of heart failure.
We used a mixture of continuous moderate-intensity 
ExT combined with high-intensity training, which has 
been demonstrated to have superior cardiovascular 
benefit in comparison with moderate- intensity exer-
cise alone.35 The possible enhanced efficacy of high-
intensity interval training and threshold training is likely 
attributable to the complex integrative physiological 
response required to perform high-intensity work. The 
high intensity interval training protocol used in this 
study required participants to exercise at 90% to 95% 
of HR maximum for 4 minutes, followed by a 3-minute 
active recovery period, repeated 4 times, termed the 
4×4 by the Norwegian group.35 During the 4 minutes of 
intense exercise, there is a large increase in Qc to meet 
the increased demand for oxygen delivery and utiliza-
tion within the skeletal muscle. The near-maximal Qc 
and repeated exposure to this intense stimulus are the 
likely drivers of the ventricular remodeling and resultant 
increase in Vo
.
2max. Our study provides compelling evi-
dence of the powerful cardiovascular benefits of high-
intensity training in humans and provides a rationale 
that the improvements are in part attributable to en-
hanced diastolic function.
Interindividual Variability in the Training 
Response
In the present study, we observed a phasic increase inVo
.
2 
and ventricular volume adaptation, such that the major-
ity of Vo
.
2max increase occurred after completion of the 
progressive and peak phase of training (when training 
volume continued to increase). When training volume 
was maintained from month 10 to 24, the additional 
change in Vo
.
2max was negligible, –0.18 (range, –4.5 
to 4.4) mL·kg–1·min–1. With the use of our repeated-mea-
sures, parallel control design, we can address several re-
cent concerns that have arisen regarding interindividual 
variability in the exercise training response.36 For exam-
ple, many of the studies reporting on training variability 
lack a comparative control group, calling into question 
the reported wide variability in the response to train-
ing and the concept of the nonresponder.37 In our pres-
ent study, we observed a very small change in Vo
.
2max 
in the control group at 9 months (–0.11 [range, –6.5 to 
5.4] mL·kg–1·min–1), with an additional reduction from 
month 10 to 24 (–0.58 [range, –3.4 to 7.0] mL·kg–1·min–1). 
 
In contrast to this clear lack of change in controls, we 
observed virtually no nonresponders in our ExT group. 
This near-universal response to ExT in these middle-
aged subjects may have been attributable to the high 
levels of adherence, the long duration of the interven-
tion, or the intensity of the training stimulus. Although, 
of course, there was some individual variability in the 
ultimate responses, our data support other recent ob-
servations that, given an adequate training stimulus, 
the vast majority of individuals will have a clear physi-
ological response to exercise training.38
Exercise Commenced in Middle Age 
Alters Cardiac Compliance and Is a 
Reasonable Target to Prevent HFpEF
At present, spironolactone is the only treatment strat-
egy recommended (class II recommendation) to coun-
teract the debilitating effects of HFpEF.39 Thus, estab-
lishing additional effective prevention strategies is key, 
especially in light of the aging population and growing 
levels of sedentary behavior, 2 leading risk factors for 
the development of HFpEF.40 Exercise training has been 
demonstrated to improve fitness and quality of life in 
patients with HFpEF41 and in those at risk of develop-
ing HFpEF.42 Yet, the effects of training on LV function 
when assessed noninvasively via echocardiography indi-
ces are less clear; with 1 study demonstrating improved 
E/eʹ and reduced left atrial volume,43 whereas others 
report no change in mitral inflow or early deceleration 
time.44 It is important to note that 2 key characteristics 
of patients with HFpEF are abnormal active relaxation 
and markedly elevated passive LV stiffness in compari-
son with controls,45 such that increases in ventricular 
filling pressure result in very few changes in ventricular 
volume,46 demonstrating reduced cardiac compliance. 
This reduction in compliance limits the capacity of the 
heart to distend during increases in venous return and 
thus limits exercise tolerance in patients with impaired 
diastolic function.47
We have previously shown that 1 year of exercise 
training in patients with HFpEF and sedentary seniors 
has little effect on LV stiffness,9,48 suggesting an in-
adequate exercise training stimulus or that older se-
niors and patients with HFpEF may have limited car-
diac plasticity, which inhibits their capacity to respond 
to exercise training. Previous work from our group 
demonstrated a proportional relationship between

cardiac compliance and sedentary aging that rapidly 
accelerated after age 65.11 Subjects who were middle 
aged, between 45 and 64 years, had cardiac compli-
ance scores between those of younger (<35 years) 
and senior (>65 years) controls, suggesting a transi-
tion phase, or sweet spot in which potential plasticity 
to reverse age-related stiffening may still be present. 
Follow-up work from our group showed healthy se-
niors who exercised habitually for >25 years had car-
diac compliance similar to young controls, essentially 
forestalling age-related changes.
We demonstrate for the first time that exercise 
training, predominantly endurance in nature, improves 
LV and myocardial stiffness in sedentary, but otherwise 
healthy middle-aged adults. Our findings suggest that 
intervening earlier in the aging process is necessary to 
preserve and possibly enhance ventricular compliance. 
ExT improved both global cardiac compliance in ad-
dition to myocardial compliance estimated from the 
end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship derived from 
transmural pressure. Improvements in cardiac compli-
ance were thus likely driven by 2 independent but cu-
mulative processes, namely attenuated pericardial con-
straint in addition to myocardial remodeling.
Exercise Is Medicine
Studies investigating the chronic effects of exercise 
training have been limited by study design, where ret-
rospective cross-sectional studies typically characterize 
exercise history over years to differentiate between 
trained and untrained individuals,4,49 or supervised 
training studies are performed for relatively short pe-
riods of time, typically 12 to 16 weeks.12 These study 
designs limit the ability to provide specific exercise pre-
scriptions for particular outcomes, because the effects 
of intensity are typically difficult to quantify in cross-sec-
tional studies and the long-term effects are unclear in 
short training studies. Our exercise prescription, which 
was evidence based, proved to be highly effective in 
enhancing cardiovascular structure and function. The 
periodized design of the training program permitted 
participants to become accustomed to the frequency of 
training gradually. In addition, by varying the duration, 
intensity, and type of training over the course of the 
week, the training was not onerous and was feasible 
with excellent adherence to prescribed sessions. The 
exercise prescription used in this study closely reflects 
the current population-based exercise/physical activity 
recommendations of 150 minutes per week of physi-
cal activity,31 albeit with the addition of high intensity 
interval training. Moreover, a growing body of epide-
miological evidence supports the beneficial impact of 
regularly exercising 4 days per week.50,51 We provide 
contemporary, prospective evidence for the efficacy of 
this type of exercise training.
Limitations
A limitation of our study is that we evaluated LV pres-
sure curves by using mean PCWP as a surrogate for LV 
end-diastolic pressure. However, we performed rigor-
ous screening for cardiovascular disease and excluded 
participants who had valvular abnormalities such as 
mitral valve regurgitation or pulmonary disease, which 
might alter the relationship between PCWP and LV end-
diastolic pressure. We selected volunteers who were 
willing and able to participate in an intensive exercise 
regimen; therefore, these results may not necessarily 
apply to the general adult population. Moreover, our 
subjects were predominantly white, which may limit the 
generalizability of our findings to other racial groups. 
Indeed, the effects of race on the response to ExT are 
controversial, with some studies demonstrating racial 
differences,52 whereas others do not.53 The long-term 
goal is to establish whether this model of ExT is effec-
tive in preventing the development of HFpEF and reduc-
ing mortality in this population. This goal is especially 
relevant in at-risk populations, including women who 
are disproportionately affected by HFpEF, because the 
present study was not adequately powered to address 
this distinction. Future studies will also need to address 
whether this intervention is efficacious in other popula-
tions at increased risk of developing heart failure; for 
example, those who are sedentary plus have evidence 
of LV hypertrophy or abnormal cardiac biomarkers (tro-
ponin and N-terminal fragment of the prohormone of 
B-type natriuretic peptide).54
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we demonstrate that 2 years of intensive ExT, 
at levels consistent with current public health recommen-
dations, increases maximal oxygen uptake and decreases 
cardiac stiffness in previously sedentary but otherwise 
healthy middle-aged adults. Regular ExT may provide pro-
tection against the future risk of HFpEF by preventing the 
increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.
