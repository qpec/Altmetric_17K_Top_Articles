Using a test-negative design, we assessed interim 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2017/18 epidemic 
of co-circulating influenza A(H3N2) and B(Yamagata) 
viruses. Adjusted VE for influenza A(H3N2), driven by 
a predominant subgroup of clade 3C.2a viruses with 
T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions, was low at 17% 
(95% confidence interval (CI): −14 to 40). Adjusted VE 
for influenza B was higher at 55% (95% CI: 38 to 68) 
despite prominent use of trivalent vaccine containing 
lineage-mismatched influenza B(Victoria) antigen, 
suggesting cross-lineage protection.
The 2017/18 influenza season in Canada has been 
characterised by co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) 
and B(Yamagata) viruses, the latter unusual so early 
in the season [1]. Most European countries are also 
experiencing simultaneous influenza A and B epidem-
ics, with B(Yamagata) predominating [2], whereas the 
United States (US) has experienced a substantial epi-
demic due predominantly to influenza A(H3N2) [3].
The 2017/18 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) includes 
influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)-like (clade 
3C.2a) 
and 
B/Brisbane/60/2008(Victoria-lineage)-
like (clade 1A) antigens. The quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine (QIV) contains an additional influenza B/
Phuket/3073/2013(Yamagata-lineage)-like (clade 3) 
antigen. The same components were included in the 
2016/17 northern and 2017 southern hemisphere vac-
cines [4].
Low vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2017/18 season 
has been anticipated following the interim report from 
Australia indicating VE of just 10% during its 2017 influ-
enza A(H3N2) epidemic [5]. In the context of exclusive 
QIV use, Australia reported higher VE of 57% against 
co-circulating influenza B viruses [5]. Here we report 
interim 2017/18 VE estimates for influenza A(H3N2) 
and influenza B from participating provinces of the 
Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network 
(SPSN), where QIV comprised less than one third of 
vaccine doses distributed overall through the publicly 
funded campaign.
Vaccine effectiveness evaluation 
VE was derived using a test-negative design [6-9]. 
Nasal/nasopharyngeal specimens and epidemiological 
data were collected from patients presenting within 7 
days of onset of influenza-like illness (ILI) to commu-
nity-based sentinel practitioners in Alberta, British 
Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. ILI was defined as 
acute onset of fever and cough and at least one other 
symptom including sore throat, myalgia, arthralgia or 
prostration. Fever was not a requirement for elderly 
adults 65 years of age and older. Vaccination status 
was based on patient and/or practitioner reporting of 
2017/18 vaccination at least 2 weeks before symptom 
onset; patients vaccinated less than 2 weeks before 
onset or with unknown vaccination status/timing were

excluded. Institutional review boards in each province 
provided ethical approval for the study.
Specimens collected from week 45 (starting 5 November 
2017) to week 3 (ending 20 January 2018) were tested 
for influenza type/subtype by real-time RT-PCR at pro-
vincial public health reference laboratories. Sanger 
sequencing of the viral haemagglutinin gene was 
undertaken on a subset of original patient specimens 
collected up to 13 January 2018 to assess the contribu-
tion of genetic clades to VE estimates.
Odds ratios (OR) comparing test-positivity for influenza 
A(H3N2) or B between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
participants who were at least 1-year-old were calcu-
lated using logistic regression, adjusted for relevant 
covariates. VE was derived as (1 − OR) × 100%.
Virological findings 
Among 1,408 eligible specimens, 689 (49%) tested 
positive for influenza, including 338 (49%) influenza A 
and 351 (51%) influenza B (Figure 1). Among the 330 
(98%) subtyped influenza A viruses, 302 (92%) were 
A(H3N2) and 28 (8%) were A(H1N1)pdm09.
Most sequenced influenza A(H3N2) viruses belonged to 
genetic clade 3C.2a (213/229; 93%) and of these most 
(204/213; 96%) belonged to a single genetic subgroup 
of 3C.2a (denoted subgroup 3 by nextflu.org [10]), bear-
ing antigenic site A substitutions T131K and R142K and 
antigenic site E substitution R261Q (Table 1). Overall 
89% of influenza A(H3N2) viruses belonged to clade 
3C.2a subgroup 3, which is similar to other surveil-
lance observations from Canada (83%) (Figure 2) and 
to recent reports from Europe [11]. However, this profile 
for the 2017/18 season is different from that found by 
the Canadian SPSN during 2016/17 or by Australia dur-
ing its 2017 epidemic, when a greater mix of genetic 
variants contributed to interim analyses and only 14% 
and 7%, respectively, of influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
belonged to subgroup 3 (Figure 2).
Virtually all sequenced influenza B viruses were 
B(Yamagata) clade 3 (227/233; 97%) and all but one 
had L172Q + M251V non-antigenic site substitutions, 
the dominant genetic variant circulating globally since 
2015 [11]; one virus had M251V without L172Q. Six 
viruses were influenza B(Victoria) clade 1A (five with a 
deletion at position 162–163) [11].
Epidemiological findings 
Most (64%) participants were adults 20–64-years-old. 
More influenza B cases (20%) than controls (11%) were 
children 9–19-years-old (p < 0.01) (Table 2). More cases 
of influenza A(H3N2) (25%; p = 0.07) and influenza B 
(27%; p < 0.01) were 50–64-years-old compared with 
controls (18%).
Adjusted VE against influenza A(H3N2) was 17% (95% 
confidence interval (CI): −14 to 40) overall and 10%

(95% CI: −31 to 39) in adults 20–64-years-old (Table 3). 
The corresponding VE against influenza B was higher 
at 55% (95% CI: 38 to 68) and 40% (95% CI: 10 to 60), 
respectively. With adjustment by calendar month 
(rather than 2-week interval) and the same covariates 
otherwise, VE with restriction to influenza B viruses 
of known Yamagata lineage (239/351; 68%) was 58% 
(95% CI: 38 to 71) overall and 47% (95% CI: 16 to 67) in 
adults 20–64-years-old. Adjusted VE against any influ-
enza A and B combined was 42% (95% CI: 25 to 55) over-
all and 31% (95% CI: 6 to 49) in adults 20–64-years-old.
Discussion 
In most other interim analyses by the Canadian SPSN, 
type B viruses comprised less than 10% of influenza 
detections, whereas in 2017/18, they were identi-
fied in an equal proportion with influenza A(H3N2) 
[7-9]. Although the reasons for an earlier influenza B 
onset are unclear, Canada experienced a substantial 
influenza A(H3N2) epidemic in 2016/17 that may have 
altered population immunity and the overall 2017/18 
influenza A(H3N2) contribution [9].
Nearly all (93%) characterised influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses were clade 3C.2a, a change from 2016/17 when 
most (80%) of the A(H3N2) viruses instead belonged 
to clade 3C.2a1 [9]. Furthermore, a single subgroup of 
clade 3C.2a with T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions 
(i.e. nextflu subgroup 3 [10]) is currently predominating 
(89% of influenza A(H3N2) viruses), whereas a more 
heterogeneous mix of genetic variants contributed in 
Canada during 2016/17 [9] and in Australia during their 
2017 epidemic [5]. Changes in the proportionate con-
tribution and emerging predominance of clade 3C.2a 
variants among circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
are important to monitor globally. The World Health 
Organization will decide in February 2018 whether to 
update the current clade 3C.2a vaccine antigen for the 
2018/19 northern hemisphere vaccine, having already 
chosen a clade 3C.2a1 strain for the southern hemi-
sphere’s 2018 vaccine [4].
Our 2017/18 interim VE estimate of 17% (95% CI: −14 
to 40) is less than half that reported for the same 
A(H3N2) vaccine in 2016/17, including interim analyses 
by the Canadian SPSN (42%; 95% CI: 18 to 59) [9], the 
US Flu VE Network (43%; 95% CI: 29 to 54) [12] and the 
European I-MOVE Network (38%; 95% CI: 21 to 51) [13]. 
Our estimate is also lower than end-of-season esti-
mates from Canada (37%; 95% CI: 20 to 51) [14] and the 
US (34%; 95% CI: 24 to 42) for 2016/17 [15], and lower 
than is expected generally for influenza A(H3N2) vac-
cines (33%; 95% CI: 26 to 39) [16].
Our 2017/18 interim VE for influenza A(H3N2) is more 
comparable to the 2017 southern hemisphere interim 
VE of 10% (95% CI: −16 to 31) reported from Australia 
[5]. Differences in virological and participant profiles, 
as well as the stage of the epidemic, have to be taken 
into account when comparing VE estimates across 
studies. Working-age adults comprised the majority of

a Sequencing of the haemagglutinin gene was attempted on a 
subset of available influenza-positive original patient specimens 
from the Canadian SPSN contributing to interim 2017/18 vaccine 
effectiveness evaluation. Sequencing was successful for 229 of 
236 (97%) influenza A(H3N2) specimens attempted (collection 
dates: 5 November 2017 to 13 January 2018).
b Sequencing based on 228 cultured isolates from inpatient and 
outpatient specimens submitted to Canada’s NML by provincial 
public health laboratories (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario, Quebec, Nunavut) as at 26 January 2018 (collection 
dates: 1 November 2017 to 10 January 2018). Sequences were 
publicly available from the Global Initiative on Sharing All 
Influenza Data (GISAID) as acknowledged in Supplement 1. Of 
these 228 A(H3N2) viruses, 199 (87%) belonged to clade 3C.2a, 
and 189 (83%) overall belonged to the clade 3C.2a subgroup 
bearing T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions (nextflu subgroup 
3).
c Sequencing based on 221 Canadian SPSN specimens included in 
the 2016/17 interim VE analysis (collection dates: 1 November 
2016 to 16 January 2017) [9]. Among Canadian 2016/17 A(H3N2) 
viruses, 43 (19%) belonged to clade 3C.2a and 32 (14%) of 
A(H3N2) viruses overall belonged to the clade 3C.2a subgroup 
bearing T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions (nextflu subgroup 
3).
d Sequencing based on 206 Australian specimens included in the 
2017 interim VE analysis (collection dates: 1 May 2017 to 24 
September 2017) [5]. Among Australian 2017 A(H3N2) viruses, 
128 (62%) belonged to clade 3C.2a and 15 (7%) of A(H3N2) 
viruses overall belonged to the clade 3C.2a subgroup bearing 
T131K + R142K + R261Q substitutions (nextflu subgroup 3).

participants in both studies and the 2017/18 interim 
VE against influenza A(H3N2) among Canadian SPSN 
participants 20–64-years-old (10%; 95% CI: −31 to 
39) is also comparable to the 2017 estimate reported 
from Australia for 15–64-year-olds (16%; 95% CI: −11 
to 36). Sample size for other age groups (e.g. children, 
elderly adults) was too limited to derive reliable interim 
estimates or to inform protection in specific high-risk 
groups.
All influenza vaccine manufacturing in Canada is egg-
based. Mutations that arise from egg adaptation of the 
vaccine strain may affect VE, an issue also identified 
for the current season’s A(H3N2) vaccine component 
[17,18]. In Canada this season, antigenic characterisa-
tion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses has only been pre-
sented in relation to a cell-propagated version of the 
vaccine reference strain; characterisation against an 
egg-based version has not been reported [1]. Among 
the small subset of Canadian viruses that could be suc-
cessfully characterised, all were considered antigeni-
cally similar to the cell-propagated vaccine strain [1]. 
Conversely, where relatedness to the egg-propagated 
version of the vaccine strain has been specifically 
explored elsewhere, more variability has been identi-
fied, with a greater proportion of viruses considered 
antigenically distinct from the egg-propagated version 
[5,11,19].
We found higher VE of 55% (95% CI: 38 to 68) against 
influenza B despite prominent use of TIV containing 
a B(Victoria) antigen that was lineage-mismatched to 
almost exclusively B(Yamagata) viruses. Approximately 
70% of vaccine doses distributed in SPSN provinces 
during the 2017/18 season were TIV, albeit with regional 
variation that will be explored in end-of-season analy-
ses. Substantial cross-lineage VE for influenza B has 
been observed previously [20], including during the 
prior 2016/17 season in Canada when VE against line-
age-mismatched influenza B using the same B(Victoria) 
TIV component was 73% (95% CI: 52 to 84) [14] and QIV 
comprised an even smaller proportion (< 25%) of vac-
cine doses distributed. Our estimate for the current 
season is comparable to the interim VE of 57% (95% 
CI: 41 to 69) for influenza B reported from Australia, 
despite exclusive use of QIV in that country [5].

ILI: influenza-like illness; NA: not applicable.
The number of participants with unknown sex or comorbidity are shown in table but excluded from the denominator for calculating 
percentages.
a Vaccination status based on patient and/or practitioner report; defined as receipt of 2017/18 seasonal influenza vaccine ≥ 2 weeks before 
symptom onset. Patients vaccinated < 2 weeks before onset or with unknown vaccination status/timing were excluded.
b p value for comparison of influenza A(H3N2) cases to negative controls. Differences were compared using the chi-squared test or Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test.
c p value for comparison of influenza B cases to negative controls. Differences were compared using the chi-squared test or Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test.
d p value for comparison of vaccinated participants to unvaccinated participants. Differences were compared using the chi-squared test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
e Includes chronic co-morbidities that place individuals at higher risk of serious complications from influenza as defined by Canada’s National 
Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), including: heart, pulmonary (including asthma), renal, metabolic (such as diabetes), blood, 
cancer or immunocompromising conditions, conditions that compromise management of respiratory secretions and increase risk of 
aspiration, or morbid obesity (body mass index ≥ 40).
f Missing specimen collection dates were imputed as the laboratory accession date minus 2 days, the average time between specimen 
collection and accession dates among specimens with complete information for both values.
g Participants who received seasonal 2017/18 influenza vaccine < 2 weeks before ILI onset or for whom vaccination timing was unknown were 
excluded from the primary analysis. They are included here for assessing vaccination regardless of timing for comparison to other sources 
of vaccination coverage.

Other agent–host and immuno–epidemiological inter-
actions, including birth cohort effects induced by dif-
ferential prime–boost exposures, may also play a role 
in VE [21]. The effect of prior vaccination history was 
not assessed here owing to sample size limitations, but 
will be explored as part of the end-of-season analyses.
Conclusions 
As reported from Australia for the 2017 southern hemi-
sphere vaccine, interim estimates from Canada for the 
2017/18 northern hemisphere vaccine indicate low 
VE of less than 20% against influenza A(H3N2), nota-
bly among working-age adults. While the influenza 
A(H3N2) epidemic continues, adjunct protective meas-
ures should be reinforced to minimise the associated 
disease burden in high-risk individuals [22]. Interim 
2017/18 VE estimates against influenza B are higher 
at 55% despite prominent TIV use, suggesting cross-
lineage protection.
*Authors’ correction
In Table 1, row label ‘Victoria lineage clade 1A’, column label 
‘Overall %’, the cell value mistakenly stated ‘33%’ instead of 
‘3%’. The mistake was corrected on 20 July 2018, as request-
ed by the authors.
**Addendum
The GenBank accession numbers were added as note to 
Table 1 on 20 July 2018.

Conflict of interest
GDS has received grants unrelated to influenza from GSK 
and Pfizer and travel reimbursement to attend an ad hoc ad-
visory board meeting of GSK also unrelated to influenza; he 
has provided paid expert testimony in a grievance against 
a vaccinate-or-mask healthcare worker influenza vaccination 
policy for the Ontario Nurses Association. JBG has received 
research grants from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. and Hoffman-
La Roche Ltd to study antiviral resistance in influenza, and 
from Pfizer Inc. to conduct microbiological surveillance 
of Streptococcus pneumoniae. MK has received research 
grants from Roche, Merck, Siemens, Hologic, and Boerhinger 
Ingelheim for unrelated studies. Other authors have no con-
flicts of interest to declare.
