BACKGROUND
Most guidelines recommend either a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) plus an in-
haled glucocorticoid or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) as the first-
choice treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
who have a high risk of exacerbations. The role of treatment with a LABA–LAMA 
regimen in these patients is unclear.
METHODS
We conducted a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferior-
ity trial. Patients who had COPD with a history of at least one exacerbation during 
the previous year were randomly assigned to receive, by inhalation, either the 
LABA indacaterol (110 μg) plus the LAMA glycopyrronium (50 μg) once daily or 
the LABA salmeterol (50 μg) plus the inhaled glucocorticoid fluticasone (500 μg) 
twice daily. The primary outcome was the annual rate of all COPD exacerbations.
RESULTS
A total of 1680 patients were assigned to the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group, 
and 1682 to the salmeterol–fluticasone group. Indacaterol–glycopyrronium showed 
not only noninferiority but also superiority to salmeterol–fluticasone in reducing the 
annual rate of all COPD exacerbations; the rate was 11% lower in the indacaterol–
glycopyrronium group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (3.59 vs. 4.03; rate 
ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.003). The indacaterol–
glycopyrronium group had a longer time to the first exacerbation than did the 
salmeterol–fluticasone group (71 days [95% CI, 60 to 82] vs. 51 days [95% CI, 46 to 
57]; hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.91], representing a 16% lower risk; P<0.001). 
The annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was lower in the indacaterol–gly-
copyrronium group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (0.98 vs. 1.19; rate 
ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.91; P<0.001), and the time to the first moderate or 
severe exacerbation was longer in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group than in 
the salmeterol–fluticasone group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.86; P<0.001), 
as was the time to the first severe exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 
to 1.00; P 
= 
0.046). The effect of indacaterol–glycopyrronium versus salmeterol–
fluticasone on the rate of COPD exacerbations was independent of the baseline 
blood eosinophil count. The incidence of adverse events and deaths was similar in 
the two groups. The incidence of pneumonia was 3.2% in the indacaterol–glycopyr-
ronium group and 4.8% in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (P 
= 
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS
Indacaterol–glycopyrronium was more effective than salmeterol–fluticasone in pre-
venting COPD exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbation during the 
previous year. (Funded by Novartis; FLAME ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01782326.)

E
xacerbations of chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associ-
ated with an accelerated decline in lung 
function,1-3 impaired quality of life,4 hospitaliza-
tion,5 and increased mortality.6 COPD exacerba-
tions are costly to health care systems.7 Thus, 
prevention of exacerbations is a key goal in the 
management of COPD.8
Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators not only 
control symptoms but also prevent COPD exac-
erbations.9-12 Inhaled glucocorticoids are also 
known to reduce the frequency of exacerbations 
and have been studied in combination with in-
haled long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs).11,13,14 In 
one trial, the combination of a LABA plus an 
inhaled glucocorticoid (salmeterol–fluticasone) 
in fixed doses and the inhaled long-acting musca-
rinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium had similar 
effects on the rate of COPD exacerbations among 
patients with a history of exacerbation.15 Conse-
quently, treatment guidelines have recommended 
that either a LABA plus an inhaled glucocorticoid 
or a LAMA can be used to prevent COPD exacer-
bations in high-risk patients.8
Long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated 
with a small but important risk of pneumonia16,17 
and other adverse effects.18 An alternative to the 
combination of a LABA and an inhaled glucocor-
ticoid for the prevention of COPD exacerbations 
in patients with a history of exacerbation is a dual 
bronchodilator regimen of a LABA and a LAMA.19
In the FLAME trial, we investigated whether 
the LABA indacaterol (110 μg) plus the LAMA 
glycopyrronium (50 μg) once daily would be at 
least as effective as the LABA salmeterol (50 μg) 
plus the inhaled glucocorticoid fluticasone (500 μg) 
twice daily in preventing COPD exacerbations. 
Because recent studies have indicated that pre-
vention of COPD exacerbations with inhaled 
glucocorticoids may be related to the blood eo-
sinophil count,20-22 the relationship between the 
baseline blood eosinophil count and the rate of 
exacerbations associated with each intervention 
was examined prospectively.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The FLAME trial was a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, non-
inferiority trial (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org). From July 2013 through Sep-
tember 2015, patients were enrolled at 356 centers 
in 43 countries. A 1-week screening period was 
followed by a 4-week run-in period, during which 
all patients were treated with inhaled tiotropium 
at a dose of 18 μg once daily. After the run-in pe-
riod, tiotropium was discontinued, and the pa-
tients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 
receive either indacaterol (110 μg) plus glycopyr-
ronium (50 μg) once daily or salmeterol (50 μg) 
plus fluticasone (500 μg) twice daily for 52 weeks; 
patients were followed for an additional 30 days 
after discontinuation of the study regimen. Open-
label salbutamol (100 μg) was provided as rescue 
medication. Additional details are provided in 
Section 3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The sponsor (Novartis) developed the protocol, 
with guidance from the first author and advice 
from the other academic authors. The first draft 
of the manuscript was written by the first and 
second authors. Editorial and technical support 
in the preparation of the manuscript was provided 
by a professional medical writer at CircleScience 
(an Ashfield company, part of UDG Healthcare); 
the medical writing support was funded by Novar-
tis. All the authors reviewed and edited the manu-
script and made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. All the authors con-
tributed to the interpretation of the data and had 
access to the full data (nondisclosure agree-
ments were in place). The trial was approved by 
the ethics committee at each trial center, and all 
the patients provided written informed consent. 
All the authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). Sta-
tistical analyses were performed by a statistician 
at DataMap. Novartis funded the trial and its 
analyses, performed trial monitoring and report-
ing, provided oversight, verified key results pro-
vided by DataMap, and had no other role in the 
trial.
Patients
We enrolled patients 40 years of age or older who 
had COPD with a grade of 2 or higher on the 
modified Medical Research Council scale (which 
ranges from 0 to 4, with higher grades indicat-
ing more severe dyspnea; a minimum clinically 
important difference has not been determined23), 
a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume 
in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 25% to less than

60% of the predicted value, and a post-broncho-
dilator ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity 
(FVC) of less than 0.70. Patients were required to 
have a documented history of at least one COPD 
exacerbation during the previous year for which 
they received treatment with systemic glucocor-
ticoids, antibiotic agents, or both. Additional de-
tails are provided in Section 2 and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Outcome Measures
The primary objective of this trial was to show 
whether indacaterol–glycopyrronium would be 
noninferior to salmeterol–fluticasone in reducing 
the rate of COPD exacerbations. The primary 
outcome was the annual rate of all COPD exac-
erbations (mild, moderate, or severe). An impor-
tant secondary objective, if noninferiority could 
be established, was to show whether indacater-
ol–glycopyrronium would be superior to salme-
terol–fluticasone in reducing the annual rate of 
all COPD exacerbations.
The protocol includes a list of 27 secondary 
outcome measures; we report data for 19 of 
these outcomes here and in Sections 4 and 5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix. The outcomes for 
which data are not reported herein can be found 
at ClinicalTrials.gov (https:/ 
/ 
clinicaltrials 
. 
gov/ 
 
ct2/ 
show/ 
results/ 
NCT01782326). Secondary out-
comes included the times to the first COPD ex-
acerbation of any severity, the first moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbation, and the first severe 
COPD exacerbation and the annual rates of mod-
erate or severe exacerbations and of severe exac-
erbations. We also assessed trough FEV1, the 
standardized area under the curve for FEV1 from 
0 to 12 hours (in a subgroup of patients), health 
status (measured by the total score on the St. 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD 
[SGRQ-C], on which scores range from 0 to 100, 
with higher scores indicating worse health sta-
tus, and the minimum clinically important dif-
ference is 4 points, as compared with the score 
with placebo24), and the use of rescue medication.
COPD exacerbations, which were defined ac-
cording to the criteria of Anthonisen et al.,25 were 
categorized as mild (involving worsening of symp-
toms for >2 consecutive days but not leading to 
treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or anti-
biotics), moderate (leading to treatment with sys-
temic glucocorticoids, antibiotics, or both), or se-
vere (leading to hospital admission or a visit to 
the emergency department that lasted >24 hours 
in addition to treatment with systemic glucocor-
ticoids, antibiotics, or both). Patients recorded 
daily symptoms and the use of rescue medication 
in an electronic diary (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). When worsening of symptoms 
met the prespecified criteria for exacerbation, 
alerts were triggered in the electronic diary, and 
patients were advised to contact their trial site.
The safety of indacaterol–glycopyrronium and 
salmeterol–fluticasone was also assessed. An in-
dependent adjudication committee assessed blind-
ed safety data. Radiographic imaging was re-
quired to confirm the presence of pneumonia. 
Additional details are provided in Section 3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
The noninferiority margin of 15% (correspond-
ing to a rate ratio for exacerbations with inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium versus salmeterol–fluti-
casone of 1.15) was based on a previous study,11 
in which the rate ratio for moderate or severe 
exacerbations with salmeterol–fluticasone ver-
sus placebo was 0.75. If the FLAME trial could 
rule out a 15% higher rate of exacerbations with 
indacaterol–glycopyrronium than with salmeterol–
fluticasone, the rate ratio for exacerbations with 
indacaterol–glycopyrronium versus placebo would 
be 0.8625, thus leading to a meaningfully lower 
rate of exacerbations with indacaterol–glycopyr-
ronium than with placebo of more than 13.75%.
We calculated that a sample of approximately 
3332 patients would be required to give the trial 
more than 95% power to rule out a 15% higher 
rate of COPD exacerbations of any severity with 
indacaterol–glycopyrronium than with salmeter-
ol–fluticasone, at a one-sided error rate of 0.025, 
assuming a rate of dropouts or major protocol 
deviations of 30%. The modified intention-to-
treat population included all patients who under-
went randomization, received at least one dose 
of a drug during the treatment period, and did 
not have major violations of compliance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines before unblinding oc-
curred. The per-protocol population included all 
patients in the modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation who did not have any major protocol de-
viations (definitions of major protocol deviations 
were specified before unblinding occurred). The 
main analysis of the primary outcome was per-
formed in the per-protocol population; a support-

Indacaterol–Glycopyrronium vs. Salmeterol–Fluticasone for COPD
ive analysis of that outcome was performed in 
the modified intention-to-treat population. Analy-
ses of all other efficacy outcomes were performed 
in the modified intention-to-treat population. All 
efficacy analyses, unless stated otherwise, were 
based on on-treatment data (i.e., for participants 
who discontinued treatment early, only the data 
obtained while they were receiving treatment 
were used).
The number of exacerbations that occurred 
during the treatment period was analyzed with 
the use of a negative binomial model that in-
cluded terms for treatment, baseline smoking 
status, use of inhaled glucocorticoids at the time 
of screening, severity of airflow limitation, and 
geographic region as fixed effects and baseline 
total symptom score (on a scale ranging from 0 to 
18, with higher total scores indicating worse 
symptoms) and 1-year history of COPD exacerba-
tions as covariates. The overall two-sided type I 
error rate for the noninferiority and subsequent 
superiority analyses was controlled at 0.05. Non-
inferiority of indacaterol–glycopyrronium to sal-
meterol–fluticasone in reducing the annual rate 
of COPD exacerbations could be claimed if the 
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the 
rate ratio for exacerbations with indacaterol–gly-
copyrronium versus salmeterol–fluticasone was 
less than 1.15; if noninferiority was established, 
superiority of indacaterol–glycopyrronium to sal-
meterol–fluticasone in reducing the annual rate 
of COPD exacerbations could be claimed if the 
upper limit of the same 95% confidence interval 
was less than 1.
Although the per-protocol analysis was pre-
specified as the main analysis of the primary out-
come and the modified intention-to-treat analysis 
as the supportive analysis, it was important to 
achieve consistent results in the two analyses in 
order to draw convincing conclusions regarding 
noninferiority and superiority.26,27 No adjustments 
for multiple testing were performed for the other 
outcomes.
Rates of exacerbations were also analyzed in 
19 prespecified subgroup analyses, defined ac-
cording to 15 baseline characteristics, including 
baseline blood eosinophil count, to assess the 
consistency of the treatment effect. All exacerba-
tion outcomes were analyzed with the use of the 
negative binomial model. The outcomes for the 
time to the first event were analyzed with the use 
of a Cox regression model, which included the 
same terms as the negative binomial model. Ad-
ditional details are provided in Section 3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
During the run-in period, 3.6% of the patients 
discontinued treatment because of an exacerba-
tion. A total of 3362 patients underwent ran-
domization; 1680 were assigned to the inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium group, and 1682 to the 
salmeterol–fluticasone group. Of the 3362 pa-
tients, 4 were excluded from all analyses because 
they did not receive any trial drugs (additional 
details are provided in Section 4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The per-protocol population 
included 3084 patients, and the modified inten-
tion-to-treat population included 3354 (Fig. 1). 
The rates of treatment discontinuation were 
16.6% in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group 
and 19.0% in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
(Fig. 1, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The reasons for discontinuation during 
the screening, run-in, and treatment periods are 
shown in Figure 1, and in Figure S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The demographic characteristics and disease 
history were well balanced between the two 
treatment groups (Table 1). A total of 19.3% of 
the patients had a history of two or more moder-
ate or severe exacerbations during the previous 
year, and 56.3% were using inhaled glucocorti-
coids at the time of screening. The rate of adher-
ence to the treatment regimens was higher than 
Figure 1 (facing page). Screening, Randomization, 
Treatment, and Analysis.
Of the patients who entered the run-in period, 179 
(3.6%) discontinued because of an exacerbation; this 
number is derived from the case report forms for ex-
acerbation and inclusion and exclusion, because there 
was no option for exacerbation as a reason for discon-
tinuation on the case report forms. Patients were in-
cluded in the safety analysis for the treatment they re-
ceived; one patient who had been assigned to the 
salmeterol–fluticasone group had mistakenly received 
indacaterol–glycopyrronium before discontinuing 
treatment. Patients who discontinued during the treat-
ment period because of technical problems were from 
one site that was closed prematurely. Patients who 
were excluded from the per-protocol analysis may be 
counted for more than one reason for exclusion.

and S3 and Section 4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Primary Outcome
In the per-protocol population, the annual rate of 
all COPD exacerbations was 3.59 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 3.28 to 3.94) in the indacaterol–gly-
copyrronium group and 4.03 (95% CI, 3.68 to 
4.41) in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (rate 
ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.96], representing 
an 11% lower rate; P 
= 
0.003) (Fig. 2A, and Fig. S5A 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The upper limit 
of the 95% confidence interval for the rate ratio 
was less than the noninferiority margin of 1.15, 
and therefore, indacaterol–glycopyrronium showed 
noninferiority to salmeterol–fluticasone with re-
gard to the annual rate of all COPD exacerba-
tions. Noninferiority was also established in the 
modified intention-to-treat population (rate of all 
COPD exacerbations, 3.59 [95% CI, 3.29 to 3.92] 
in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group vs. 4.09 
[95% CI, 3.75 to 4.46] in the salmeterol–flutica-
sone group; rate ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.94; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed 
in additional sensitivity analyses performed with 
the addition of data on exacerbations and follow-
up time from patients who discontinued treat-
ment early (further details are provided in Table 
S4 and Section 4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In a secondary analysis of the primary out-
come that was adjusted for multiple testing, in-
dacaterol–glycopyrronium showed superiority to 
salmeterol–fluticasone in reducing the annual rate 
of all COPD exacerbations. In both the per-pro-
tocol and modified intention-to-treat populations, 
the upper limits of the same 95% confidence in-
tervals for the rate ratio were less than 1 (Fig. 2A).

Indacaterol–Glycopyrronium vs. Salmeterol–Fluticasone for COPD
Figure 2. Trial Outcomes.
Panel A shows the rate ratio for all exacerbations (mild, moderate, and severe) in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium 
group versus the salmeterol–fluticasone group. The bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The modified intention-
to-treat population included all patients who underwent randomization, received at least one dose of a trial drug 
during the treatment period, and did not have major violations of compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines 
before unblinding occurred. The per-protocol population included all patients in the modified intention-to-treat 
population who did not have any major protocol deviations (definitions of major protocol deviations were specified 
before unblinding occurred). Panel B shows the time to the first exacerbation of any severity, the time to the first 
moderate or severe exacerbation, and the time to the first severe exacerbation in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium 
group and the salmeterol–fluticasone group. The analyses were performed in the modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation. Patients at risk are patients who were still receiving treatment and had not had an event.

Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of all other efficacy outcomes were per-
formed in the modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation. The indacaterol–glycopyrronium group 
had a longer time to first exacerbation than did 
the salmeterol–fluticasone group (median, 71 days 
[95% CI, 60 to 82] vs. 51 days [95% CI, 46 to 57]; 
hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.91], repre-
senting a 16% lower risk; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). The 
annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacer-
bations (i.e., exacerbations that required the use 
of health care services) was 17% lower in the 
indacaterol–glycopyrronium group than in the 
salmeterol–fluticasone group (0.98 [95% CI, 
0.88 to 1.10] vs. 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.32]; rate 
ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.91; P<0.001) (Fig. 
S5B in the Supplementary Appendix). The inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium group had a longer time 
to the first moderate or severe exacerbation than 
did the salmeterol–fluticasone group (127 days 
[95% CI, 107 to 149] vs. 87 days [95% CI, 81 to 
103]; hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.86], 
representing a 22% lower risk; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B); 
because less than 50% of patients in the inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium group had an exacerba-
tion, the time by which at least 25% of patients 
had a first moderate or severe exacerbation was 
calculated instead of the median time. In addi-
tion, the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group had 
a significantly longer time to the first severe 
exacerbation than did the salmeterol–flutica-
sone group, with a 19% lower risk (hazard ratio, 
0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.00; P 
= 
0.046) (Fig. 2B). 
The annual rate of severe COPD exacerbations 
was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.19) in the inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium group and 0.17 (95% CI, 
0.13 to 0.22) in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
(rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.09; P 
= 
0.23). 
The number of exacerbation events according to 
severity is provided in Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The annual rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations was analyzed according to base-
line blood eosinophil count (<2% vs. ≥2%). Among 
patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts 
lower than 2%, the rate was significantly lower 
in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group than 
in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (0.99 [95% 
CI, 0.86 to 1.14] vs. 1.24 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.43]; 
rate ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.004); 
among patients with baseline blood eosinophil 
counts of 2% or higher, the rate was also sig-
nificantly lower in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium 
group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
(0.98 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.11] vs. 1.15 [95% CI, 
1.02 to 1.30]; rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96; 
P 
= 
0.01). Three other analyses in subgroups de-
fined according to different cutoffs of baseline 
blood eosinophil counts provided similar results 
(data not shown). No meaningful interaction 
was seen between the rate of all COPD exacerba-
tions or moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
and previous therapy or other baseline character-
istics (Fig. 3, and Fig. S6A and S6B in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Additional details are pro-
vided in Section 4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 
significantly greater in the indacaterol–glycopyr-
ronium group than in the salmeterol–flutica-
sone group, with a between-group difference of 
62 ml at week 52 (P<0.001). The standardized 
area under the curve for FEV1 from 0 to 12 hours 
was measured in a subgroup of 556 patients; the 
change from baseline was significantly greater 
in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group than 
in the salmeterol–fluticasone group, with a be-
tween-group difference of 110 ml at week 52 
(P<0.001). The improvement (decrease in score) 
over time in the total score on the SGRQ-C was 
greater in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group 
than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group, with 
differences between the indacaterol–glycopyrro-
nium group and the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
ranging from −1.2 points at week 12 to −1.8 points 
at week 52 (P<0.01 for both comparisons). At 
week 52, the percentage of patients who had a 
clinically important decrease of at least 4 points 
in the total score on the SGRQ-C was signifi-
cantly higher in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium 
group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
(49.2% vs. 43.7%; odds ratio, 1.30; P<0.001). The 
decrease over time in the use of rescue medication 
was also greater in the indacaterol–glycopyrro-
nium group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone 
group. (For additional details on these second-
ary outcomes, see Fig. S7, Tables S6 and S7, and 
Section 4 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Safety
The incidence of adverse events, including serious 
adverse events, was similar in the two treatment 
groups (Table 2). A total of 24 participants in each 
group (1.4%) died; the most common causes of 
death were respiratory and cardiovascular causes

Indacaterol–Glycopyrronium vs. Salmeterol–Fluticasone for COPD
(Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The incidence of pneumonia was 3.2% in 
the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group and 4.8% 
in the salmeterol–fluticasone group (P 
= 
0.02). In 
a subgroup of 535 patients, the median percent-
age change over a period of 52 weeks in the ratio 
of 24-hour urinary cortisol to creatinine was 
5.62% in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium group 
and –10.39% in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
(Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Figure 3. Subgroup Analysis of the Rate of All Exacerbations.
The analysis was performed in the modified intention-to-treat population. Race was self-reported. The severity of airflow limitation was 
determined on the basis of the 2011 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging system, in which moderate 
disease is indicated by a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 50 to 79% of the predicted value, severe disease by an FEV1 of 
30 to 49% of the predicted value, and very severe disease by an FEV1 of less than 30% of the predicted value. The severity of chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (COPD) was determined on the basis of the 2015 GOLD staging system, in which group A indicates low risk 
and low symptom burden, group B low risk and high symptom burden, group C high risk and low symptom burden, and group D high 
risk and high symptom burden. COPD denotes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, LABA long-acting beta-agonist, and LAMA long-
acting muscarinic antagonist.

Discussion
This clinical trial was powered for a noninferior-
ity analysis to determine whether the combination 
of a LABA (indacaterol) and a LAMA (glycopyrro-
nium) would be as effective as the combination of 
a LABA (salmeterol) and an inhaled glucocorti-
coid (fluticasone) for the prevention of COPD ex-
acerbations. The LABA–LAMA regimen showed 
not only noninferiority but also, on a subsequent 
superiority analysis, consistent superiority to the 
LABA–inhaled glucocorticoid regimen for all 
outcomes related to exacerbations, lung function, 
and health status.
Clinical guidelines and strategy documents 
for COPD8,28 have recommended that, in patients 
at risk for exacerbations, first-line therapy should 
be either a LABA plus an inhaled glucocorticoid 
or a LAMA. One previous trial showed no differ-
ence between the use of a LABA–inhaled gluco-
corticoid regimen and the use of LAMA mono-
therapy with regard to exacerbation rates.15 
However, a recent study showed that combined 
bronchodilator therapy with a LABA and a LAMA 
had greater efficacy in the reduction of exacerba-
tion rates than did LAMA monotherapy.19 Among 
patients who had been receiving combined treat-
ment with a LABA, an inhaled glucocorticoid, 
and a LAMA, withdrawal from the inhaled glu-
cocorticoid did not increase the exacerbation 
rate significantly,29 a finding that further sup-
ports the hypothesis that inhaled glucocorti-
coids may not be essential for the prevention of 
COPD exacerbations in patients receiving therapy 
with a LABA and a LAMA.

Indacaterol–Glycopyrronium vs. Salmeterol–Fluticasone for COPD
consistent effects with regard to COPD exacerba-
tions of all severities, including exacerbations re-
quiring the use of health care services. Exacerba-
tions were carefully monitored with daily symptom 
recordings in electronic diaries,4 which allowed us 
to document all exacerbations, including those 
requiring the use of health care services. Studies 
have shown underreporting of exacerbation events 
(mild exacerbations), yet these unreported events 
have an effect on patients’ health status.30-32 
Therefore, in this trial, exacerbations of all se-
verities were assessed for the primary outcome 
to reflect the importance of preventing every ex-
acerbation. Capturing all exacerbations is a major 
strength of this trial, and we have found a very 
consistent benefit of dual bronchodilation therapy 
in reducing exacerbations of all severities.
Post hoc analyses of data from trials of 
LABA–inhaled glucocorticoid regimens for COPD 
have suggested that these regimens are more 
beneficial in reducing the rate of exacerbations 
among patients with elevated blood eosinophil 
counts (e.g., ≥2%) than among patients with lower 
eosinophil counts.20-22 This suggests that a high-
er eosinophil count may be associated with a 
greater response to inhaled glucocorticoids. There-
fore, the FLAME trial prospectively examined the 
relationship between blood eosinophil counts 
and exacerbation outcomes. In both the subgroup 
of patients with blood eosinophil counts lower 
than 2% and the subgroup of patients with 
counts of 2% or higher, the rates of moderate or 
severe exacerbations and of all exacerbations were 
significantly lower in the indacaterol–glycopyr-
ronium group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone 
group, a finding that suggests that the LABA–
LAMA regimen is more effective in reducing the 
rate of exacerbations than the LABA–inhaled 
glucocorticoid regimen in both eosinophil sub-
groups.
The superiority of indacaterol–glycopyrroni-
um with respect to lung function was expected, 
since a combination of two bronchodilators 
improves lung function to a greater degree than 
does a combination of a LABA and an inhaled 
glucocorticoid.33-35 Further evidence of a benefit 
with respect to symptoms was seen with the 
greater decrease in the use of rescue medication 
and the greater improvement in health status 
(decrease in SGRQ-C score) in the indacaterol–
glycopyrronium group than in the salmeterol–
fluticasone group.
A potential limitation of the study is that some 
patients who were treated with a LABA–inhaled 
glucocorticoid regimen before enrollment and 
were then assigned to the indacaterol–glycopyr-
ronium group may have had withdrawal effects 
from the long-term use of their previous regi-
men, which could have resulted in an increase in 
exacerbations. There was no evidence that patients 
who had been receiving inhaled glucocorticoids 
before the trial withdrew from the trial during the 
run-in period at higher rates than did patients 
who had not been receiving inhaled glucocorti-
coids, and exacerbation rates during the run-in 
period were low. In addition, analyses of exacer-
bation rates according to previous therapy showed 
no meaningful interaction between the treatment 
and the type of maintenance therapy the patient 
had previously received.
It may also be argued that our trial design 
favored LABA–LAMA therapy over LABA–inhaled 
glucocorticoid therapy because the LABA–LAMA 
regimen was administered once daily, whereas 
the LABA–inhaled glucocorticoid regimen was 
administered twice daily. However, there is evi-
dence that once-daily administration of a LABA–
inhaled glucocorticoid regimen is no more effec-
tive than twice-daily administration with respect 
to lung function.36 The once-daily dose of inda-
caterol–glycopyrronium is approved worldwide, 
except in the United States, where a lower, twice-
daily dose of indacaterol–glycopyrronium is ap-
proved. Trials have shown that the twice-daily 
regimen has effects on lung function that are 
similar to those observed with a once-daily dos-
ing regimen, but no direct comparison has been 
performed.37,38
Our trial used electronic diaries to flag exac-
erbations, and thus higher rates of all exacerba-
tions were reported in this trial than in most 
trials assessing exacerbations, although this dif-
ference is unlikely to bias treatment compari-
sons. Because mild exacerbations were the most 
common events seen in this trial, it is possible 
that inclusion of such events could have made it 
more likely for us to conclude noninferiority, as-
suming a lack of difference between treatments 
with respect to the mild exacerbations; however, 
the fact that the rates of mild exacerbations and 
of moderate and severe exacerbations combined 
were lower in the indacaterol–glycopyrronium 
group than in the salmeterol–fluticasone group 
is reassuring.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
The consistent exacerbation outcomes have 
major implications for COPD management, es-
pecially among patients with a history of exacer-
bation. Confirmation of these findings with the 
use of other combinations of long-acting bron-
chodilators would provide additional evidence to 
support the first-line use of a LABA–LAMA regi-
men in this patient population. However, we 
cannot exclude the possibility that some patients 
may benefit from the addition of inhaled gluco-
corticoids.
In conclusion, we found that among patients 
with COPD who had a history of exacerbation 
during the previous year, indacaterol–glycopyrro-
nium was consistently more effective than salme-
terol–fluticasone in preventing exacerbations 
and was associated with no detectable increase 
in adverse events.
