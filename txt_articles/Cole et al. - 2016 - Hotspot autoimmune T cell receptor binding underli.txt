Introduction
T cells perform an essential role in adaptive immunity by inter-
rogating the host proteome for anomalies, classically by recog-
nizing peptides bound in major histocompatibility (MHC) mol-
ecules at the cell surface. Recent data (1–3) supports the notion 
that, to perform this role, the highly variable αβ T cell antigen 
receptor (TCR) must be able to recognize thousands, if not mil-
lions, of different peptide ligands (4, 5). This ability is required 
to enable the estimated 25 million distinct TCRs expressed in 
humans (6) to provide effective immune coverage against all 
possible foreign peptide antigens (5). Although essential to avoid 
blind spots during pathogen recognition, T cell cross-reactivity 
has also been implicated as a pathway to autoimmunity, possi-
bly mediated by highly reactive pathogen-specific T cells weakly 
recognizing self-ligands (7–10).
Several mechanisms, by which TCRs could bind to a large 
number of different peptide-MHC (pMHC), have been proposed 
(5). Structures of unligated and ligated TCRs have shown that the 
TCR complementarity determining region (CDR) loops can be 
flexible, perhaps enabling peptide binding using different loop 
conformations (11, 12). Both MHC and peptide have also been 
shown to undergo structural changes upon TCR binding, medi-
ating an induced fit between the TCR and pMHC (13–16). Other 
studies, mainly in the murine system, have demonstrated that 
the same TCR can interact with different pMHCs using a com-
mon (1, 11, 14, 17–20) or divergent modality (21). Recent studies 
in model murine systems demonstrate that TCR cross-reactivity 
can be governed by recognition of a conserved region in the pep-
tide that allows tolerance of peptide sequence variation outside 
of this hotspot (1, 22).
We recently reported that the 1E6 human CD8+ T cell clone — 
which mediates the destruction of β cells through the recognition 
of a major, HLA-A*0201–restricted, preproinsulin signal peptide 
(ALWGPDPAAA15–24) (23–25) — can recognize upwards of 1 million 
different peptides (3). CD8+ T cells that recognize HLA-A*0201–
ALWGPDPAAA have been shown to populate insulitic lesions in 
patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (26). We demonstrated that 
the TCR from the 1E6 T cell clone bound to HLA-A*0201–ALWG-
PDPAAA using a limited footprint and very weak binding affinity 
(23). This first experimental evidence of a high level of CD8+ T cell 
The cross-reactivity of T cells with pathogen- and self-derived peptides has been implicated as a pathway involved in the 
development of autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms that allow the clonal T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to functionally 
engage multiple peptide–major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) are unclear. Here, we studied multiligand discrimination 
by a human, preproinsulin reactive, MHC class-I–restricted CD8+ T cell clone (1E6) that can recognize over 1 million different 
peptides. We generated high-resolution structures of the 1E6 TCR bound to 7 altered peptide ligands, including a pathogen-
derived peptide that was an order of magnitude more potent than the natural self-peptide. Evaluation of these structures 
demonstrated that binding was stabilized through a conserved lock-and-key–like minimal binding footprint that enables 
1E6 TCR to tolerate vast numbers of substitutions outside of this so-called hotspot. Highly potent antigens of the 1E6 TCR 
engaged with a strong antipathogen-like binding affinity; this engagement was governed though an energetic switch from an 
enthalpically to entropically driven interaction compared with the natural autoimmune ligand. Together, these data highlight 
how T cell cross-reactivity with pathogen-derived antigens might break self-tolerance to induce autoimmune disease.

GPDFPTI tetramer stained 1E6 with the greatest MFI, gradually 
decreasing to the weakest tetramers: A2-MVWGPDPLYV and 
-YLGGPDFPTI. To parallel the functional analysis, we also per-
formed thermal melt (Tm) experiments using synchrotron radia-
tion circular dichroism (SRCD) to investigate the stability of each 
APL (Figure 1D). The range of Tm was between 49.4°C (RQFGP-
DWIVA) and 60.3°C (YQFGPDFPIA), with an average approx-
imately 55°C, similar to our previous findings (27). This pattern 
of stability did not correlate with the T cell activation or tetramer 
staining experiments, indicating that peptide binding to the MHC 
do not explain ligand potency.
The 1E6 TCR can bind peptides with strong antipathogen-like 
affinities. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that anti-
pathogenic TCRs tend to bind with stronger affinity compared 
with self-reactive TCRs (28), likely a consequence of the dele-
tion of T cells with high-affinity self-reactive TCR during thymic 
selection. In accordance with this trend, the 1E6 TCR bound the 
natural preproinsulin peptide, ALWGPDPAAA, with the weakest 
affinity currently published for a human CD8+ T cell–derived TCR 
with a biologically relevant ligand (KD > 200 μM; KD, equilibrium 
binding constant)  (23). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis 
of the 1E6 TCR–pMHC interaction for all 7 APLs (Figure 2, A–H) 
demonstrated that stronger binding affinity (represented as ΔG°, 
kcal/mol) correlated well with the EC50 values (peptide concen-
tration required to reach half-maximal 1E6 T cell killing) for each 
ligand, demonstrated by a Pearson’s correlation analysis value of 
0.8 (P = 0.01) (Figure 2I). It should be noted that this correlation, 
although consistent with the T cell killing experiments, uses only 
approximate affinities calculated for the 2 weakest ligands. These 
experiments revealed 4 important findings. First, the 1E6 T cell 
could still functionally respond to peptide when the TCR binding 
affinity was extremely weak, e.g., the 1E6 TCR binding affinity for 
the A2-MVWGPDPLYV peptide was KD = ~600 μM. Second, the 
1E6 TCR bound to A2-RQFGPDFPTI with KD = 0.5 μM, equiv-
alent to the binding affinity of the very strongest antipathogen 
TCRs (29). Third, the 1E6 TCR bound to A2-RQFGPDWIVA pep-
tide, within the C. asparagiforme proteome, with approximately 
4-fold stronger affinity than A2-ALWGPDPAAA, demonstrating 
the potential for a pathogen-derived antigen to initiate a response 
to the self-derived sequence. Finally, these data demonstrate the 
largest range of binding affinities reported for a natural, endoge-
nous human TCR of more than 3 logs of magnitude (A2-MVWG-
PDPLYV vs. A2-RQFGPDFPTI). To confirm the affinity spread 
detected by SPR, and to evaluate whether experiments performed 
using soluble molecules were biologically relevant to events at the 
T cell surface, we determined the effective 2D affinity of each APL 
using an adhesion frequency assay in which a human rbc coated 
in pMHC acted as an adhesion sensor (30, 31). In agreement with 
SPR experiments, the range of 2D affinities we detected differed 
by around 3 logs, with the A2-MVWGPDPLYV generating the 
weakest 2D affinity (2.6 × 10–5 AcKa μm4) and A2-RQFGPDFPTI 
the strongest (4.5 × 10–2 AcKa μm4) (Figure 2J). As with the 3D affin-
ity measurements, the 2D affinity measurements correlated well 
with the EC50 values for each ligand (Figure 2K) demonstrating a 
strong correlation (Pearson’s correlation = 0.8, P = 0.01) between 
T cell antigen sensitivity and TCR binding affinity. Of note, these 
data demonstrate a close agreement between the 3D affinity val-
cross-reactivity in a human autoimmune disease system hinted 
toward molecular mimicry by a more potent pathogenic peptide 
as a potential mechanism leading to β cell destruction (8, 24). 
Here, we solved the structure of the 1E6 TCR with 7 altered pep-
tide ligands (APLs) determined by our previously published com-
binatorial peptide library (CPL) screening (3), 2 of which mapped 
within human pathogens. These APLs differed from the natural 
preproinsulin peptide by up to 7 of 10 residues. We also solved the 
structure of each unligated APL to investigate whether structural 
changes occurred before or after binding — which, combined with 
an in-depth cellular and biophysical analysis of the 1E6 interaction 
with each APL, demonstrated the molecular mechanism mediat-
ing the high level of cross-reactivity exhibited by this preproinsu-
lin-reactive human CD8+ T cell clone.
Results
The 1E6 T cell clone recognizes APLs across a large dynamic range. We 
have previously demonstrated that the 1E6 T cell clone can recog-
nize over 1 million different peptides with a potency comparable 
with, or better than, the cognate preproinsulin peptide ALWGP-
DPAAA (3). From this large functional scan, we selected 7 differ-
ent APLs that activated the 1E6 T cell clone across a wide (4-log) 
functional range (Table 1). Two of these peptides, MVWGP-
DPLYV and RQFGPDWIVA (bold text signifies amino acids that 
are different from the index preproinsulin–derived sequence), are 
contained within the proteomes of the human pathogens Bacte-
roides fragilis/thetaiotaomicron and Clostridium asparagiforme, 
respectively. Competitive functional testing revealed that the pre-
proinsulin-derived sequence ALWGPDPAAA was one of the least 
potent targets for 1E6, with only the MVWGPDPLYV and YLGG-
PDFPTI demonstrating a similar low-activity profile in MIP-1β 
secretion and target killing assays (Figure 1, A and B). The RQF-
GPDWIVA sequence (present in C. asparagiforme) activated the 
1E6 T cell with around 1 log–greater potency compared with ALW-
GPDPAAA. At the other end of the spectrum, the RQFGPDFPTI 
peptide stimulated MIP-1β release and killing by 1E6 at an exoge-
nous peptide concentration 2–3 logs lower compared with ALWG-
PDPAAA. The pattern of peptide potency was closely mirrored by 
pMHC tetramer staining experiments (Figure 1C and plots shown 
in Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI85679DS1). Here, the A2-RQF-

faces were apparent (discussed below) and resulted in altered 
binding affinities of the respective complexes.
Interactions between the 1E6 TCR and different APLs are focused 
around a conserved GPD peptide motif. We next performed an 
in-depth atomic analysis of the contacts between the 1E6 TCR 
and each APL to determine the structural basis for the altered T 
cell peptide sensitivities and TCR binding affinities (Table 2). 
Concomitant with our global analysis of 1E6 TCR binding to the 
APLs, we observed a common interaction element, consistent 
with our previous findings (23), that utilized TCR residues Tyr97α 
and Trp97β, forming an aromatic cap over a central GPD motif 
that was present in all of the APLs (Figure 4). Interactions between 
these 2 TCR and 3 peptide residues accounted for 41%–50% of 
the total contacts across all complexes (Table 2), demonstrating 
the conserved peptide centric binding mode utilized by the 1E6 
TCR. This fixed anchoring between the 2 molecules was impor-
tant for stabilization of the TCR-pMHC complex, as — although 
other peptides without the ‘GDP’ motif were tested and shown 
to activate the 1E6 T cell clone (3) — we were unable to measure 
robust affinities using SPR (data not shown). These data support 
the requirement for a conserved interaction between the 1E6 TCR 
and the GPD motif, as we observed in our previously published 
1E6-A2-ALWGPDPAAA structure (23).
Focused hotspot binding around a conserved GPD motif enables 
the 1E6 TCR to tolerate peptide degeneracy. Although the 1E6 TCR 
formed a similar overall interaction with each APL, the stabiliza-
tion between the TCR and the GPD motif enabled fine differences 
in the contact network with both the peptide and MHC surface 
that allowed discrimination between each ligand (Figure 5). For 
example, the 1E6 TCR made only 47 peptide contacts with A2- 
MVWGPDPLYV (KD = ~600 μM) compared with 63 and 57 con-
ues generated using SPR and 2D affinity values generated using 
adhesion frequency assays.
The 1E6 TCR uses a consensus binding mode to engage multiple 
APLs. Our previous structure of the 1E6-A2-ALWGPDPAAA com-
plex demonstrated a limited binding footprint between the TCR 
and pMHC (23). The low number of contacts between the 2 mol-
ecules most likely contributed to the weak binding affinity of the 
interaction. In order to examine the mechanism by which the 1E6 
TCR engaged a wide range of peptides with divergent binding 
affinities, we solved the structure of the 1E6 TCR in complex with 
all 7 APLs used in Figure 2. All structures were solved in space 
group P1 to 2–3 Å resolution with crystallographic Rwork/Rfree ratios 
within accepted limits as shown in the theoretically expected dis-
tribution (ref. 32 and Supplemental Table 1). The 1E6 TCR used 
a very similar overall binding modality to engage all of the APLs, 
with root mean square deviation ranging between 0.81 and 1.12 
Å2 (compared with 1E6-A2-ALWGPDPAAA). The relatively broad 
range of buried surface areas (1,670–1,920 Å2) did not correlate 
well with TCR binding affinity (Pearson’s correlation = 0.45, 
 
P = 0.2). The surface complementarity values (0.52–0.7) cor-
related slightly with affinity (Pearson’s correlation = 0.7, P = 0.05) 
but could not explain all differences in binding (Figure 3A and 
Table 2). The TCR CDR loops were in a very similar position in all 
complexes, apart from some slight deviations in the TCR β-chain 
(Figure 3B); the peptides were all presented in a similar confor-
mation (Figure 3C); and there was minimal variation in crossing 
angles of the TCR (42.3°–45.6°) (Figure 3D). Overall, the 1E6 TCR 
used a canonical binding mode to engage each APL with the TCR 
α-chain positioned over the MHC class I (MHCI) α2-helix and 
the TCR β-chain over the MHCI α-1 helix, straddling the peptide 
cargo (29). However, subtle differences in the respective inter-

complex structure. For example, the 1E6 TCR made 64 peptide 
contacts with A2-YLGGPDFPTI (KD = ~400 μM) compared with 
43 contacts with A2-RQWGPDPAAV (KD = 7.8 μM).
The most important peptide modification in terms of generat-
ing new contacts was peptide position 1. The stronger ligands all 
tacts with A2-YQFGPDFPIA (KD = 7.4 μM) and A2-RQFGPDFPTI 
(KD = 0.5 μM), respectively. Although the number of peptide con-
tacts was a good predictor of TCR binding affinity for some of the 
APLs, for others, the correlation was poor (Pearson’s correlation = 
0.045, P = 0.92), possibly because of different resolutions for each

(KD = 44.4 μM) structures (Figure 6, B, C, and E). The unligated 
structures of A2-AQWGPDAAA, A2-RQWGPDPAAV, A2-YQF-
GPDFPIA, and A2-RQFGPDFPTI were virtually identical when 
in complex with 1E6 (Figure 6, D and F–H). Apart from the case 
of A2-AQWGPDAAA (KD = 61.9 μM), these observations support 
the conclusion that the higher-affinity ligands required less con-
formational melding during binding, which could be energetically 
beneficial (lower entopic cost) during ligation with the 1E6 TCR.
Peptide modifications alter the interaction between the 1E6 TCR 
and the MHC surface. In addition to changes between the TCR and 
peptide component, we also observed that different APLs had dif-
ferent knock-on effects between the TCR and MHC. MHC residue 
Arg65 that forms part of the MHC restriction triad (Arg65, Ala69, 
and Gln155) (15, 33) played a central role in TCR-MHC contacts, 
with Gln155 playing a less important role and Ala69 playing no 
role in binding at the interface (Figure 7). Generally, the weaker- 
affinity APLs made fewer contacts with the MHC surface (27–29 
interactions) compared with the stronger-affinity APLs (29–35 
contacts), consistent with a better Pearson’s correlation value 
(0.55) compared with TCR-peptide interactions versus affinity 
(0.045). For instance, contacts were made between TCR residue 
Val53β and MHC residue Gln72 in all APLs except for in the weak-
encoded larger side chains (Arg or Tyr) at peptide position 1 (Figure 
5, E–H), enabling interactions with 1E6 that were not present in the 
weaker APLs that lacked large side chains in this position (Figure 
5, A, C, and D). We have previously shown that the 1E6 TCR uses 
a rigid lock-and-key mechanism during binding to A2-ALWGP-
DPAAA (23). These data demonstrated that the unligated struc-
ture of the 1E6 TCR was virtually identical to its ligated counter-
parts. In order to determine whether any of the APLs required an 
induced fit mechanism during binding that could explain the dif-
ference in free binding energy (ΔG) between each complex (Table 
2), we solved the unligated structures of all 7 APLs (the A2-ALWG-
PDPAAA structure has been previously published and was used in 
this comparison, ref. 23) (Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 2). The 
unligated A2-MVWGPDPLYV (KD = ~600 μM) structure revealed 
that the side chain Tyr9 swung around 8 Å in the complex struc-
ture, subsequently making contacts with TCR residues Asp30β 
and Asn51β (Figure 6A and Figure 5A, respectively). This move-
ment could result in an entropic penalty contributing to the weak 
TCR binding affinity we observed for this ligand. Additional small 
movements in the Cα backbone of the peptide around peptide 
residue Asp6 were apparent in the A2-YLGGPDFPTI (KD = ~400 
μM), A2-ALWGPDPAAA (KD = ~208 μM), and A2-RQFGPDWIVA

est affinity ligand pair, 1E6-A2-MVWGPDPLYV, in which a sub-
tle change in TCR conformation — probably mediated by different 
peptide contacts — abrogated this interaction (Figure 7A).
An energetic switch from unfavorable to favorable entropy 
(order-to-disorder) correlates with antigen potency. Our analysis 
of the contact network provided some clues that could explain 
the different antigen potencies and binding affinities between 
the 1E6 TCR and the different APLs. However, there were clear 
outliers in which the number of contacts did not match with the 
strength/potency of the interaction. For example, the 1E6 TCR 
bound to A2-RQWGPDPAAV with the third strongest affinity 
(KD = 7.8 μM) but made fewer contacts than with A2-ALWGPD-
PAAA (KD = ~208 μM) (Table 2). However, it is not necessarily the 
quantity of contacts that determines the 
strength of an interaction, but the quality 
of the contacts. Thus, we performed an 
in-depth thermodynamic analysis of 6 of 
the ligands under investigation (Figure 
8 and Supplemental Table 3). The weak 
binding affinity between 1E6 and A2- 
MVWGPDPLYV and A2-YLGGPDFPTI 
generated thermodynamic data that were 
not robust enough to gain insight into 
the enthalpic (ΔH°) and entropic (TΔS°) 
changes that contributed to the different 
binding affinities/potencies for each APL. 
The overall free binding energies (ΔG°) 
were between –4.4 and –8.6 kcal/mol, 
reflecting the wide range of TCR binding 
affinities we observed for the different 
APLs. The enthalpic contribution in each 
complex did not follow a clear trend with 
affinity, with all but the 1E6-A2-RQFG-
PDFPTI interaction (ΔH° = 6.3 kcal/mol) 
generating an energetically favorable 
enthalpy value (ΔH° = –3.7 to –11.4 kcal/
mol); this indicated a net gain in electro-
static interactions during complex forma-
tion. However, there was a clear switch 
in entropy between the weaker-affinity 
and stronger-affinity ligands, indicated 
by a strong Pearson’s correlation val-
ue between entropy and affinity (Pear-
son’s correlation value 0.93, P =0.007). 
For instance, the A2-ALWGPDPAAA, 
A2-AQWGPDAAA, and A2-RQFGPD-
WIVA (KD = ~208 μM, KD = 61.9 μM, 
and KD = 44.4 μM, respectively) were all 
entropically unfavorable (TΔS° = –2.9 to 
–5.6 kcal/mol), indicating a net change 
from disorder to order. Conversely, the 
stronger-affinity ligands A2-RQWGP-
DPAAV (KD = 7.8 μM), A2-YQFGPDF-
PIA (KD = 7.4 μM), and A2-RQFGPD-
FPTI (KD = 0.5 μM) exhibited favorable 
entropy (TΔS° = 2.2 to 14.9 kcal/mol), 
indicating an order-to-disorder change 
during binding, possibly through the expulsion of ordered water 
molecules. Furthermore, the structures of the unligated pMHCs 
demonstrated that, for these stronger-affinity ligands, there was 
less conformational difference between the TCR ligated pMHCs 
compared with the weaker-affinity ligands (Figure 6). The poten-
tial requirement for a larger degree of induced fit during binding to 
these weaker-affinity ligands is consistent with the larger entropic 
penalties observed for these interactions.
Potential epitopes for 1E6 TCR occur commonly in the viral pro-
teome. We searched a database of over 1,924,572 unique decamer 
peptides from the proteome of viral pathogens that are known, or 
strongly suspected, to infect humans. Three hundred forty-two of 
these decamers conformed to the motif xxxGPDxxxx. Of these,

53 peptides contained the motif xOxGPDxxxO, where O is one 
of the hydrophobic amino acid residues A,V, I, L, M, Y, F, and W 
that might allow binding to HLA-A*0201 (Supplemental Table 4). 
Thus, there are many pathogen-encoded peptides that could act 
as agonists for the 1E6 T cell beyond the MVWGPDPLYV and 
RQFGPDWIVA sequences studied here. Extension of these anal-
yses to include the larger genomes of bacterial pathogens would 
be expected to considerably increase these numbers. The binding 
affinity of the 1E6 TCR interaction with A2-RQFGPDWIVA is 
considerably higher than with the disease-implicated A2-ALWG-
PDPAAA sequence (KD = 44.4 μM and KD > 200 μM, respectively), 
highlighting how a pathogen-derived sequence might be capable 
of priming a 1E6-like T cell.
Discussion
T cell antigen discrimination is governed by an interaction between 
the clonally expressed TCR and pMHC, mediated by the chemical 
characteristics of the interacting molecules. It has recently become 
clear that TCR cross-reactivity with large numbers of different 
pMHC ligands is essential to plug holes in T cell immune coverage 
that pathogens could exploit (5). Flexibility at the interface between 
the TCR and pMHC, demonstrated in various studies (29), has been 
suggested as a mechanism mediating T cell cross-reactivity with 
multiple distinct epitopes. This notion is attractive because the CDR 
loops, which form the TCR antigen-binding site, are usually the 
most flexible part of the TCR and have the ability to mold around 
differently shaped ligands. Focused binding around a minimal pep-
tide motif has also been implicated as an alternative mechanism 
enabling TCR cross-reactivity (1, 11–14, 16, 22, 34). Notably among 
these studies, Garcia and colleagues recently used the alloreactive 
murine TCR-MHC pair of the 42F3 TCR and H2-Ld to demonstrate 
recognition of a large number of different peptides via conserved 
hotspot contacts with prominent up-facing peptide residues (22).
Sethi and colleagues recently demonstrated that the MHCII- 
restricted Hy.1B11 TCR, which was isolated from a patient with 
multiple sclerosis, could anchor into a deep pocket formed from 
peptide residues 2, 3, and 5 (from MBP85–99 bound to HLA-DQ1) 
(19). This motif was conserved in at least 2 potential foreign pep-
tides, originating from Herpes simplex virus and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, enabling TCR recognition of foreign epitopes (19). 
Although these data provided some clues into the molecular 
mechanism of T cell recognition, there still remain several gaps 
in our understanding. First, we currently know nothing about how 
human MHCI–restricted TCRs mediate cross-reactivity in the 
context of a clinically relevant model of autoimmunity, thought 
to be a major pathway of disease initiation in several autoimmune 
diseases (35). Second, molecular studies have not yet revealed a 
broad set of rules that determine TCR cross-reactivity because, 
with the exception of the allo–TCR-MHC pair of the 42F3 TCR 
and H2-Ld that did not encounter each other during T cell devel-
opment (22), studies have been limited to structures of a TCR with 
only 2 or 3 different ligands (10, 14, 21, 36–40). Finally, no stud-
ies have included characterization of pathogen-derived ligands 
recognized by self-reactive T cells with greater potency than the 
autoantigen, a potentially important facet to break self-tolerance.
Here, we investigated a highly cross-reactive MHCI-re-
stricted TCR isolated from a patient with T1D that recognizes 
an HLA-A*0201–restricted preproinsulin signal peptide (ALW-
GPDPAAA15–24) (3, 23, 25). Human CD8+ T cell clones expressing 
TCRs with this specificity mediate the destruction of β cells, have 
been found in islets early in infection, and are proposed to be a 
major driver of disease (8, 26). We solved the structure of the 1E6 
TCR with 7 APLs to enable a comprehensive analysis of the molec-
ular basis of TCR degeneracy. The epitopes we selected exhibited 
a broad range of potencies and could activate the 1E6 T cell clone 
at exogenously supplied concentrations more than 4 logs apart. 
Overall, the difference in antigen potency correlated well with the 
binding energy (ΔG° kcal/mol) of the 1E6 TCR for the different 
epitopes, which ranged from values of ΔG° = ~–4.4 to –8.6 kcal/mol 
(calculated from 3D affinity data) or 2D affinity values of AcKa = 2.5 
× 10–5 to 4.4 × 10–2 μm4. The weaker end of this spectrum extends 
our understanding of the limits in which T cells can functionally 
operate in terms of TCR 3D binding affinity and is in line with the 
types of very low affinity, yet fully functional self-reactive CD8+ T 
cells we have observed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (41–43). 
Previous studies of autoreactive TCRs have shown that their bind-
ing mode is generally atypical, either due to an unusual binding 
manner (19, 44–47), weak TCR binding affinity (23, 36), an unsta-
ble pMHC (48, 49), or a combination of these factors. Our data 
demonstrate the potential for an autoreactive TCR to bind with a 
conventional binding mode to a stable pMHC with antipathogen-
like affinity (KD = 0.5 μM) depending on the peptide sequence. Our 
structural analysis revealed that the 1E6 TCR bound with a con-
served conformation across all APLs investigated. This binding 
orientation was mediated through a focused interaction with TCR 
residues Tyr97α and Trp97β that formed an aromatic cap over a 
central ‘GDP’ motif that was common to all APLs. We have previ-
ously demonstrated the importance of the GPD motif using a pep-
tide library scan (23), as well as a CPL scan approach (3). Although 
the 1E6 T cell was able to activate weakly with peptides that lacked

TCR interaction with the APLs. Interaction between 1E6 TCR (gray illustra-

tide motif (the position of these side chains in all 7 APLs and A2-ALWGP-
DPAAA in complex with the 1E6 TCR is shown in multicolored sticks). The

Despite some weak statistical correlation between the sur-
face complementarity (SC) and affinity, closer inspection of the 
interface revealed no obvious structural signature that could 
definitively explain the differences in antigen potency and TCR 
binding strength between the different ligands. However, similar 
to our findings in other systems (57–59), modifications to residues 
outside of the canonical central peptide bulge were important for 
generating new interactions. For example, all of the stronger lig-
ands encoded larger side chains (Arg or Tyr) at peptide position 1 
that enabled new interactions with 1E6 not present with the Ala at 
this position in the natural preproinsulin peptide. These data also 
explain our previous findings that alteration of the anchor residue 
at peptide position 2 (Leu-Gln) has a direct effect on 1E6 TCR bind-
ing affinity (60) because our structural analysis demonstrated that 
1E6 made 3 additional bonds with A2-AQWGPDPAAA compared 
with A2-ALWGPDPAAA, consistent with the >3-fold stronger 
binding affinity. We have recently demonstrated how a suboptimal 
position 2 anchor in a melanoma-derived antigen can improve TCR 
binding through a similar mechanism (58). These results challenge 
the notion that the most potent peptide antigens exhibit the great-
est pMHC stability and have implications for the design of anchor 
residue–modified heteroclitic peptides for vaccination.
Early thermodynamic analysis of TCR-pMHC interactions 
suggested a common energetic signature, driven by favorable 
enthalpy (generally mediated through an increase in electrostatic 
interactions) and unfavorable entropy (changes from disorder 
to order) (61, 62). These parameters aligned well with structural 
data, demonstrating that TCRs engaged pMHC using an induced 
fit binding mode (63). However, more recent data have shown 
that TCRs can utilize a range of energetic strategies during pMHC 
this motif, we were unable to robustly measure binding affinities 
or generate complex structures with these ligands, highlighting 
the central role of this interaction during 1E6 T cell antigen rec-
ognition. This hotspot binding, defined as a localized cluster of 
interactions that dominate binding energy during protein-protein 
interactions (50), has been previously shown to contribute to TCR 
recognition of MHC as a mechanism that tunes T cell cross-reac-
tivity by providing fixed anchor points that enable TCRs to toler-
ate a variable peptide cargo (1, 51–53). Alternatively, interactions 
between the TCR and peptide have been shown to dominate the 
energetic landscape during ligand engagement, ensuring that T 
cells retain peptide specificity (54, 55). The binding mechanism 
utilized by the 1E6 TCR during pMHC recognition is consistent 
with both of these models. Ligand engagement is dominated by 
peptide interactions, but hotspot-like interactions with the central 
GPD motif enable the 1E6 TCR to tolerate peptide residues that 
vary outside of this region, explaining how T cells expressing this 
TCR may cross-react with a large number of different peptides (3). 
These findings are also analogous to the observed binding mode 
of the Hy.1B11 TCR, in which one aromatic residue of the TCR 
CDR3α loop anchored into a pocket created by a conserved peptide 
motif (19). In both of these examples, self-recognition is mediated 
by TCR residues with aromatic side chains. These large, generally 
hydrophobic amino acids can form strong interactions with other 
residues through π-π stacking. Combined with evidence demon-
strating that aromatic side chains are conserved in the CDR2 loops 
of TCRs from many species (56), we speculate that these aromatic 
residues could impart a level of “stickiness” to TCRs, which might 
be enriched in an autoimmune setting when the TCR often binds 
in a nonoptimal fashion.

T cell and a foreign peptide with a more potent ligand that might 
then break self-tolerance. Indeed, we found over 50 decamer pep-
tides from the proteome of likely, or known, human viral pathogens 
alone that contained both the conserved central GPD motif and 
anchor residues at positions 2 and 10 that would enable binding 
to HLA-A*02:01. Further experiments will be required to deter-
mine whether any naturally presented, human pathogen–derived 
peptides act as active ligands for 1E6, but our work presented here 
demonstrates that it is at least feasible for an autoimmune TCR 
to bind to a different peptide sequence that could be present in a 
pathogen proteome with substantially higher affinity and potency 
than the interaction it might use to attack self-tissue.
In summary, this investigation into the molecular basis of 
T cell cross-reactivity using a clinically relevant cytotoxic CD8+ 
T cell clone that kills human pancreatic β cells (24, 25) provides 
answers to a number of previously outstanding questions. First, 
our data shows that a single TCR has the potential to functionally 
(assessed through T cell activation) bind to different ligands with 
affinities ranging across 3 orders of magnitude. Second, this is the 
first example in which ligands have been identified and charac-
terized for a human autoreactive TCR that are substantially more 
potent than the natural self-ligand, demonstrating the potential for 
a pathogenic ligand to break self-tolerance and prime self-reactive 
 
T cells. Third, this first structural analysis of a cross-reactive human 
MHCI–restricted autoimmune TCR showed that degeneracy was 
mediated through TCR-pMHC anchoring by a conserved mini-
mal binding peptide motif. Finally, TCR ligand discrimination was 
binding, currently with no obvious pattern in terms of TCR affin-
ity, binding mechanism, or specificity (pathogen, cancer, or self- 
ligands) (12, 57, 64, 65). Although no energetic signature appears 
to exist for different TCRs, we used thermodynamic analysis here 
to explore whether changes in energetics could help explain lig-
and discrimination by a single TCR. This analysis demonstrated 
a strong relationship (according to the Pearson’s correlation 
analysis) between the energetic signature used by the 1E6 TCR 
and the sensitivity of the 1E6 T cell clone to different APLs. The 
weaker APL ligands were characterized by favorable enthalpy 
and unfavorable entropy, whereas the stronger ligands progres-
sively shifted to favorable entropy. These differences were con-
sistent with a greater degree of movement between the unligated 
and ligated pMHCs for the weaker ligands, suggesting a greater 
requirement for disorder-to-order changes during TCR binding 
(54, 66, 67). Thus, the enhanced antigen potency was probably 
mediated through a shift from an induced fit to a lock-and-key 
interaction between the stronger ligands (less requirement for 
energetically unfavorable disorder-to-order changes), resulting in 
a more energetically favorable ΔG value.
Importantly, the preproinsulin-derived epitope was one of 
the least potent peptides, demonstrating that the 1E6 T cell clone 
had the ability to respond to different peptide sequences with far 
greater potency. The RQFGPDWIVA peptide, which was substan-
tially more potent than the preproinsulin peptide, is within the pro-
teome of a common human pathogen (C. asparagiforme), demon-
strating the potential for an encounter between a naive 1E6-like

was transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates (3 × 106 to 4 × 106 per 
well in 2 ml) at day 7, and the IL-2 increased to 200 IU/ml. For the pur-
pose of this study, the clone was passaged 3 times and used between 
weeks 2 and 4 after expansion.
T cell activation assays and tetramer staining. The [51Cr] release cyto-
toxicity assay was performed as previously described (43). Target A2 
CIR cells were labeled for 1 hour at 37°C with 30 μCi chromium (sodium 
chromate in normal saline, PerkinElmer) per 1 × 106 cells, washed with 
R10, and allowed to leach for a further hour at 37°C in R10 to remove 
any excess chromium from the cells. After chromium labeling, target 
cells were washed and plated at 1,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue cul-
ture plates and pulsed with peptide at the indicated concentrations for 
2 hours at 37°C. T cells were added to give the desired T cell/target 
cell (5:1) ratio and a final volume of 150 μl R10. Target cells were also 
incubated alone or with 1% Triton X-100 detergent (Sigma-Aldrich) 
to give the spontaneous and total chromium released from the target 
cells, respectively. After overnight incubation, at 37°C and 5% CO2, 
the supernatants were both (i) assayed for MIP1β by ELISA (R&D Sys-
tems) and (ii) harvested (10% of total volume), mixed with 150 μl Opti-
pahse supermix scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer) in 96-well poly-
ethylene terephthalate plates (PerkinElmer), and sealed; the amount 
characterized by an energetic shift from an enthalpically to entrop-
ically driven interaction. Our demonstration of the molecular 
mechanism governing cross-reactivity by this preproinsulin reac-
tive human CD8+ T cell clone supports the notion first put forward 
by Wucherpfennig and Strominger that molecular mimicry could 
mediate autoimmunity (7–9) and has far-reaching implications for 
the complex nature of T cell antigen discrimination.
Methods
T cell maintenance and culture. The 1E6 T cell clone was generated as 
previously described (25) and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen in 
freezing buffer (90% FCS and 10% DMSO). Cells were defrosted rap-
idly in a 37°C water bath until a small amount of frozen cells were left 
and then immediately washed in 15–20 ml of R10 media (RPMI 1640 
with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM 
l-glutamine) by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 minutes. Defrosted cells 
were cultured in T cell media: R10 with 1× nonessential amino acids, 
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer (all from Invitrogen), 
20 IU/ml of IL-2 (aldesleukin, brand name Proleukin, Prometheus) 
and 25 ng/ml IL-15 (PeproTech), for 24 hours; then, 0.75 × 106 to  1.5 
× 106 cells expanded by coculture with 15 × 106 irradiated (3,100 cGy)

buffered saline, pH 7.4, and concentrated to ~10 mM. Spectra were 
measured every 5°C over a temperature range between 5°C and 90°C 
with 5 minutes of equilibration time for each temperature. Four scans 
were acquired using an integration time of 1 second, a path length of 
0.02 cm, and a slit width of 0.5 mm equivalent to a 1.2-nm bandwidth. 
Reversibility was monitored by measuring the spectrum at 20°C after 
cooling from 90°C with 30 minutes of incubation. Melting curves were 
analyzed assuming a 2-state trimer-to-monomer transition from the 
native (N) to unfolded (U) conformation N3 ↔ 3U with an equilibrium 
constant K = (U)3/(N3) = F
/(3c2[1-F]3), where F and c are the degree of 
folding and protein concentration, respectively. Data were fitted as 
described (70). Fitted parameters were the melting temperature Tm, 
van’t Hoff’s enthalpy ΔHvH, and the slope and intercept of the native 
baseline. As all protein complexes aggregated to various degrees upon 
unfolding, the ellipticity of the unfolded state was set as a constant of 
–4,500 deg cm2/dmol (71, 72).
SPR analysis. Binding analysis was performed using a BIAcore 
T200 equipped with a CM5 sensor chip as previously described (73). 
Binding analysis was performed 3× in independent experiments using 
pMHC monomers generated in-house. Approximately 200–500 RU 
of each HLA-A*0201–peptide complex was attached to the CM5 sen-
sor chip at a slow flow rate of 10 μl/min to ensure uniform distribution 
on the chip surface. The 1E6 TCR was purified and concentrated to 
approximately 40–350 μM on the same day of SPR analysis to reduce 
the likelihood of TCR aggregation. For equilibrium analysis, 10 serial 
dilutions were prepared in triplicate for each sample and injected 
over the relevant sensor chips at 25°C. TCR was injected over the 
chip surface using kinetic injections at a flow rate of 45 μl/min using 
HLA-A*0201–ELAGIGILTV as a negative control surface on flow cell 1. 
 
of released chromium was measured indirectly on a 1450 Microbeta 
counter (PerkinElmer). The percentage of specific target cell lysis by T 
cells was calculated according to the following formula: (experimental 
release [with T cells and target cells] − spontaneous release from target 
cells)/(total release from target cells − spontaneous release from tar-
get cells) × 100. Experiments were independently completed in trip-
licate. Tetrameric pMHCI reagents (tetramers) were constructed by 
the addition of PE-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) at a pMHCI/
streptavidin molar ratio of 4:1. A total of 50,000 T cells were stained 
with PE-conjugated tetramer (25 μg/ml) folded around the indicated 
peptides for 30 minutes on ice and washed with PBS before staining 
with 2 μl (1:40 dilution of the DMSO stock in PBS) of the violet LIVE/
DEAD fixable dead cell stain Vivid (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at room 
temperature before direct addition of 2 μl of anti–CD8-APC antibody 
(clone BW135/80, Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated for a further 20 min-
utes on ice before being washed in FACS buffer (2% FCS in PBS). Data 
were acquired using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) 
and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
Protein expression, refolding, and purification. The 1E6 TCR, 
HLA-A*0201, and human β2m chain were generated as described 
previously (23). The 1E6 TCR and HLA-A*0201 peptide variants were 
refolded and purified as described previously (23). Biotinylated pMHCI 
and pMHC tetramer were prepared as previously described (68).
pMHC stability assays. Thermal stability of the HLA-A*0201–pep-
tide complexes was assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy 
monitoring the change in ellipticities at 218 nm. Data were collected, 
in duplicate, using a nitrogen-flushed Module B end-station spectro-
photometer at the B23 Synchrotron Radiation CD Beamline at the Dia-
mond Light Source (DLS) (69). Samples were prepared in phosphate 
Figure 8. Thermodynamic analysis of the 1E6 TCR with A2-ALWGPDPAAA and the APLs. Eight serial dilutions of the 1E6 TCR were injected, in duplicate, 
over each immobilized APL and A2-ALW at 5°C, 13°C, 18°C, 25°C, 30°C, and 37°C. The equilibrium binding constant (KD) values were calculated using a 
nonlinear curve fit (y = [P1x]/[P2 + X]), and thermodynamic parameters were calculated according to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (ΔG° = ΔH − TΔS°). The 
binding free energies, ΔG° (ΔG° = RTlnKD), were plotted against temperature (K) using nonlinear regression to fit the 3-parameters van’t Hoff equation (RT 
ln KD = ΔH° – TΔS° + ΔCp°[T-T0] – TΔCp° ln [T/T0] with T0 = 298 K). (A) 1E6-A2-ALWGPDPAAA; (B) 1E6-A2-AQWGPDPAAA; (C) 1E6-A2-RQFGPDWIVA; (D)

an Art-Robbins Phoenix dispensing robot (Alpha Biotech Ltd.), and 
data were collected at 100 K at the DLS at a wavelength of 0.98 Å 
using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. Reflection intensities were esti-
mated using XIA2 (75), and the data were analyzed with Scala and the 
CCP4 package (76). Structures were solved with molecular replace-
ment using Phaser (77). Sequences were adjusted with Coot (78), and 
the models were refined with REFMAC5. Graphical representations 
were prepared with PyMOL (79). The reflection data and final model 
coordinates were deposited with the PDB database (A2-MVW PDB: 
5C0H; A2-YLG PDB: 5C0G; A2-AQW PDB: 5C0D; A2-RQF[A] PDB:

Peptide motif predictions. Peptide motif predictions were per-
formed by searching a viral database compiled using publicly avail-
able protein sequences of over 1,924,572 unique decamer peptides 
from the proteome of viral pathogens (80). The motif xOxGPDxxxO 
— where O is anyone of the hydrophobic amino acid residues A,V, I, L, 
M, Y, F, and W that might allow binding to HLA-A*0201 — was used as 
the search parameter.
Statistics. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to determine 
the relationship between TCR binding affinity and antigen potency, 
structural correlates, or thermodynamics using Origin Lab 9.0 pro.

For the thermodynamics experiments, this method was repeated at 
the following temperatures: 5°C, 13°C, 18°C, 25°C, 30°C, and 37°C. 
Results were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.1, Excel, and Origin 6.0 
software. The KD values were calculated assuming a 1:1 interaction by 
plotting specific equilibrium-binding responses against protein con-
centrations, followed by nonlinear least squares fitting of the Lang-
muir binding equation. The thermodynamic parameters were calcu-
lated using the nonlinear van’t Hoff equation (RT ln KD = ΔH° –TΔS° + 
ΔCp°[T-T0] – TΔCp° ln [T/T0]) with T0=298 K.
Adhesion frequency assay. We used an adhesion frequency assay to 
measure the 2D affinity of TCR-pMHC interactions at the cell mem-
brane as previously described (30). Briefly, human 1E6 T cells were 
mounted onto 1 micropipette, and, on the other pipette, human rbcs 
coated with pMHC by biotin-streptavidin coupling served as both a 
surrogate APC and an adhesion sensor for detecting the TCR-pMHC 
interaction. Site densities of TCR and pMHC were measured by flow 
cytometry as previously described (74). All assays were performed using 
at least 5 cell pairs and calculated as an average of 100 cell-cell contacts.
Crystal structure determination. All protein crystals were grown 
at 18°C by vapor diffusion via the sitting drop technique. Each pMH-
CI (200 nl, 10 mg/ml) in crystallization buffer (10 mM TRIS [pH 
8.1] and 10 mM NaCl) was added to 200 nl of reservoir solution.
