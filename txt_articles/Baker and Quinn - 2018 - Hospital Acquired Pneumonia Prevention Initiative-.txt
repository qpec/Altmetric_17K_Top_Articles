Background: Because nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) is understudied, our purpose
was to determine the incidence, overall burden, and level of documented pneumonia preventive inter-
ventions of NV-HAP in 24 U.S. hospitals.
Methods: This retrospective chart review extracted NV-HAP cases as per the 2014 ICD-9-CM codes for
pneumonia not present on admission and the 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case def-
inition. Patient demographic data, outcomes, and documented preventive interventions were also collected.
Results: We found 1,300 NV-HAP patients who acquired NV-HAP (rate, 0.12-2.28 per 1,000 patient days)
across the 21 hospitals that completed the data collection. Most NV-HAP infections (70.8%) were ac-
quired outside of intensive care units (ICUs); 18.8% required transfer into the ICU. In the 24 hours prior
to diagnosis, most of the patients did not have fundamental hospital care associated with pneumonia
prevention.
Conclusions: This multicenter, nationwide study highlights the significant burden of NV-HAP in the U.S.
acute care hospital setting. We found that NV-HAP occurred on every hospital unit, including in younger,
healthy patients. This indicates that although some patients are clearly at higher risk, all patients carry
some NV-HAP risk. Therapeutic interventions aimed at NV-HAP prevention are frequently not provided
for patients in acute care hospitals.

In the last decade, reducing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
and other hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) has been a focus in
the United States for both the Medicare payment policy and the Na-
tional Healthcare Safety Network. Since 2008, monitoring and
prevention for device-associated infections, including ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract
infections, and central line–associated bloodstream infections, have
resulted in significant decreases in both the incidence and cost of
device-associated infections. Currently, only 25% of HAIs result from
the 3 most common device-associated infections, and VAP is re-
sponsible for only 38% of all HAP cases.1,2
Among HAIs, nonventilator HAP (NV-HAP) is emerging as a major
patient safety concern that is associated with higher costs than VAP
and is equally as dangerous.3-5 According to the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample, there are 35-38 million
total annual U.S. hospital discharges6; of these, 83% are from medical-
surgical units and not critical care. Even for patients in the intensive
care unit (ICU), only 39.5% receive mechanical ventilation.7 Using
these figures, 32.6-35.4 million U.S. patients are at risk for NV-
HAP annually, whereas only 3.6-3.9 million are at risk for VAP.6
A 3-year study of HAP in Pennsylvania from 2009-2011 found
that NV-HAP affects more people than VAP (5,597 vs 2,299), has a
comparable mortality rate (18.7% vs 18.9%), and has higher total costs
($156 million vs $86 million), respectively.4 Furthermore, a recent

 case-control study found that patients who developed NV-HAP were
8.4 times more likely to die during hospitalization, more likely to
require intensive care, 8.0 times more likely to require mechanical
ventilation, and had a longer median hospital length of stay (LOS)
than patients who did not develop NV-HAP (15.9 vs 4.4 days,
respectively).8 In a further study of a convenience sample of 8 hos-
pitals in Pennsylvania, most health care–associated pneumonia cases
were reported outside of a critical care setting (74.1%), the mortal-
ity rate of pneumonia patients reached 30.9%, and a quarter of health
care–associated pneumonia cases were attributed to aspiration, a
cause which could be minimized through nursing activities tar-
geted at aspiration prevention.9
Our previous report from the Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia Pre-
vention Initiative (HAPPI-1) highlighted a significant number of
unreported NV-HAP cases (1.2-8.9 per 1,000 hospital days) in a con-
venience sample of 3 U.S. hospitals.3 After implementation of an
evidence-based, oral care protocol aimed at NV-HAP prevention for
all acute care patients in 1 hospital, the rate of NV-HAP per 100
patient discharges decreased by 38.8% from 0.5 to 0.3. The overall
number of NV-HAP cases was also reduced by 37% during the 12-
month intervention period. The avoidance of NV-HAP cases resulted
in an estimated 8 lives saved, $1.72 million in costs avoided, and
500 extra hospital days averted during the study time frame.3 This
initiative began in 2012, and we continue to monitor the rates of
NV-HAP. As of 2014, a 70% overall reduction in NV-HAP has been
achieved hospital-wide, a reduction in NV-HAP of 164 cases, 31 fewer
patient deaths, and $5.9 million cost avoidance (Quinn and Baker,
2016, unpublished quality improvement data).
There are several therapeutic interventions associated with the
prevention of HAP, most of which are components of hospital care
that patients should receive during their stay. These include (1) oral
care,10-13 (2) head of the bed elevation to 30°-45°,14 (3) patient
mobility,15 (4) use of incentive spirometry,16 and (5) deep breath-
ing and coughing exercises.16 However, several studies have
demonstrated that basic hospital care associated with pneumonia
prevention may be missing from care that patients receive during
their hospital stay. The inability to provide all aspects of required
hospital care is a concept known as missed care (ie, standard care
that is not completed).17 Missed care is also be referred to as un-
derused care, omitted care, rationed care, failure to maintain, and
unfinished care.18,19 Data from some studies support that a large
amount of fundamental care is being missed in U.S. acute care
hospitals.17,19-25 Furthermore, missed hospital care in both U.S. and
international studies has been linked to numerous harmful out-
comes for patients and increased cost for hospitals.17 Two recent
systematic reviews of these therapeutic interventions to prevent
pneumonia found that the use of oral care was associated with the
most evidence of benefit. Unfortunately, oral care is among the most
frequent type of missed care.26,27
The HAPPI-2 study continued our HAPPI program of research,
adding to the current body of knowledge of NV-HAP incidence
and the essential aspects of therapeutic interventions for pneumo-
nia prevention. Specifically, we sought to look at the incidence
and impact of NV-HAP in a group of 24 U.S. hospitals, and in-
cluded a measurement of the frequency of care associated with
pneumonia prevention. We included oral care as a fundamental
aspect of pneumonia prevention care because it is (1) well recog-
nized as a strategy for the prevention of VAP, (2) has the largest
body of knowledge of all the currently known interventions for
NV-HAP prevention, and (3) is consistent with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’
s (CDC) perspective on modifiable
risk factors.28 In addition, it is the only modifiable risk factor that
applies to 100% of patients.
It is our hope that the findings from this study will provide a
foundation for future research in this critical area of patient safety,
and lead to specific clinical measures and refinement of success-
ful pneumonia prevention strategies that can be widely deployed.
Our specific aims included the following: (1) What is the inci-
dence of NV-HAP in a sample of 24 U.S. hospitals as defined by the
CDC?; and (2) What is the amount of missed hospital care associ-
ated with pneumonia prevention in the 24 hours prior to the
diagnosis of NV-HAP in the same sample of 24 U.S. hospitals, spe-
cifically frequency of oral care; head of the bed elevation to 30°-
45°; if allowed, out of bed ≥2 times; incentive spirometry use; and
deep breathing and coughing exercises?
METHODS
Study oversight and hospital selection
Oversight was provided by the National Patient Safety Found-
ation’
s (NPSF) National Study Advisory Board for the HAPPI research
project. The NPSF distributed a Web-based request for application;
responding hospitals were selected through convenience sampling
and approved by the NPSF’
s HAPPI Advisory Council. We elected to
engage the NPSF oversight board to maximize transparency and ex-
ternal validity of results and to avoid bias. Hospital selection aimed
to provide a representative sample of U.S. geographic regions, hos-
pital size, and hospital type (community, private, profit or nonprofit,
and university hospitals). Central institutional review board ap-
proval was provided by the Western Institutional Review Board
(approval no. 20150684). Study approval was also granted by the
Sutter Institute for Medical Research. Each participating hospital had
the option of using the Western Institutional Review Board or to
obtain institutional review board approval at their own institution.
Inclusion criteria
Hospitals meeting the following inclusion criteria were eligible
to participate: (1) no previous hospital-wide NV-HAP monitoring,
(2) no specific NV-HAP prevention interventions within the last 5
years, (3) no implemented change in systematic oral care in the last
5 years, and (4) provision of a letter of support from nursing ad-
ministration. Hospitals were required to have the ability to extract
the required electronic medical records data. All adult discharges
from all units in the hospitals between January 1, 2014, and De-
cember 31, 2014 were reviewed.
Data collection and electronic medical record review
All data were collected through retrospective chart review. Prior
to any data collection, all site investigators received webinar train-
ing by the coprincipal investigators on the data extraction process.
NV-HAP cases were determined using a 2-step process: (1) all cases
coded with the 2014 ICD-9-CM codes for pneumonia and not present
on admission were extracted; and (2) reported NV-HAP cases were
then verified by the site investigators using the 2013 CDC’
s case def-
inition of pneumonia (eg, positive chest imaging, clinical signs and
symptoms, laboratory evidence).28 Case report forms, developed by
content experts and tested in the pilot study,3 were used to gather
patient demographic data, NV-HAP diagnosis, clinical unit of NV-
HAP acquisition, patient outcomes, mortality, LOS, 30-day
readmission rate, admission and discharge location disposition, and
documented nursing care. Individual sites entered their data into
REDCap (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), a secure HIPAA, 21
CFT Part 11-compliant Web application for building and manag-
ing online surveys and databases.29 REDCap data collection and
analysis was managed by Researcher’
s Institute for Medical Re-
search. All data were deidentified before entry into REDCap. Each
3

 electronic medical record data set was known and coded only by
the individual site investigators.
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were used to address both research aims.
Descriptive data were imported into IBM SPSS 24 (Armonk, NY; IBM
Corp.) for statistical analysis. A randomization process for accura-
cy of data coding was completed. Each hospital, based on randomized
generators, validated a minimum of 10% of cases for accuracy in re-
porting. Error rates were 1.2% at all sites and within acceptable limits
for data accuracy.

RESULTS
Hospitals
Twenty-four hospitals applied to participate in the study, rep-
resenting a range of geographic U.S. locations and service types. All
24 hospitals were invited into the study on approval from NPSF’
s
HAPPI Advisory Council. Three hospitals either did not complete the
entire application process, did not provide all required data, or did
not complete the data validation process. Therefore, 21 hospitals
were included in the final sample (Table 1).
NV-HAP cases and impact
Retrieval of electronic medical records based on identification
of ICD-9-CM codes revealed 4,455 cases of NV-HAP; 1,314 cases, 14
patients had 2 separate pneumonia diagnoses, leaving 1,300 indi-
vidual patient with NV-HAP that met the CDC case definition for
NV-HAP. Fourteen patients had >1 ICD-9-CM–coded pneumonia
episode while hospitalized. The NV-HAP rate ranged from 0.12-
2.28 per 1,000 patient days across the hospitals.
Most NV-HAP infections (70.8%; n = 920) were acquired outside
of ICUs. Patients acquired NV-HAP predominantly in medical-
surgical departments (43.1%; n = 560), followed by telemetry (8.5%;
n = 111) and progressive care units (7.2%; n = 93), and oncology (4.9%;
n = 64), orthopedic (2.8%; n = 37), neurology (1.5%; n = 19), and ob-
stetric departments (0.2%; n = 3). Location of NV-HAP acquisition
was not specific for 33 patients (2.5%; reported as other depart-
ment) and for 25 patients (1.9%) was unavailable. Of the patients
who acquired NV-HAP on floor wards, 245 (18.8%) were trans-
ferred to ICUs.
LOS was defined by 5 categories: 2-7, 8-10, 11-14, 15-20, and
>20 days. For approximately one-third (37.3%; n = 485) of pa-
tients, LOS was >20 days, and for over half (57.7%; n = 749), LOS was
≥15 days. Of those NV-HAP patients transferred to the ICU, 40.8%
had LOS >20 days.
Most patients were admitted from home or assisted living
(n = 964), followed by other health care facilities or specialized
nursing facilities (SNFs). Of the 964 patients admitted from home
or assisted living, 40.6% (n = 391) returned to home or assisted living,
with the remainder discharged into a health care facility. Of the 245
patients transferred to an ICU after pneumonia diagnosis, 26.1%
(n = 64) were discharged to home or assisted living. Of the 1,094 sur-
viving patients, 19.3% were readmitted to hospital within 30 days.
Documentation of fundamental hospital care
Figure 1 shows the proportion of patients with documented hos-
pital care performed in the 24 hours before NV-HAP diagnosis. Oral
care ≥2 times was not documented for 58.6% of patients. Most pa-
tients (64.5%) had documented head of bed elevation to 30°-45°,
whereas 35.5% did not. If permitted, 28.7% of patients were out of
bed twice in a 24-hour period, (55.4%) were out of bed <2 times
(15.9% were not allowed mobility intervention), incentive spirom-
etry was not documented for 81.8%, nor cough and deep breathing
exercises (67.4%) in the 24-hour period before pneumonia diagno-
sis. There was variation between hospital settings, with some
hospitals providing more preventive care in some areas than others,
especially among oral care. The variations in provision of funda-
mental care may be because of differences in work force and nursing
practices between the hospitals.
DISCUSSION
We identified the NV-HAP incidence rate in 21 hospitals as 0.12-
2.28 cases per 1,000 patient days. This is similar to rates reported
in other studies: in the HAPPI-1 study,3 the rate of unreported NV-
HAP was 1.25 cases per 1,000 patient days before intervention, and
in 1 study on non-ICU HAP, 3 ± 1.4 cases per 1,000 hospital admis-
sions were reported.30 Although previous studies indicate that most
NV-HAP cases occur in older patients,31 we found that over half of
NV-HAP cases (50.9%) were in patients <66 years of age. Although
increased age is a known independent risk factor for NV-HAP,31 our
findings support that younger patients are also at some risk and do
acquire pneumonia while hospitalized.
Our findings also indicate that patients in all types of hospital
units are at some risk for NV-HAP. Surgery is an established pneu-
monia risk factor32,33; however, the risk for patients on the medical
services is not widely appreciated outside of specialty units such
as oncology. We found that 63% of cases originated from nonsur-
gical departments; however, this figure should be interpreted with
caution given that not all hospital sites had the same medical-
surgical bed balance. Surprisingly, there were some cases—although
few of them (n = 10)—that originated from the women’
s health
service/obstetrics and gynecology.
The department previously identified as most at risk for pneu-
monia, and with protocols in place to prevent ventilator-associated
pneumonia, is the ICU.34-36 However, in our study we found that 27.3%
of NV-HAP cases were identified among ICU patients. That is, pa-
tients in the ICU, not on the ventilator, are acquiring HAP despite
the preventive emphasis for patients who are on a ventilator.
Seventy-three percent of NV-HAP cases originated outside the ICU.
This demonstrates there is a risk on general floors and in the
nonventilated ICU patients.4,31,37

 There is a direct impact on ICU utilization from NV-HAP both
from nonventilated ICU patients and from patients transferred to
the ICU. In our study, 27.3% of NV-HAP cases was acquired in the
ICU, and an additional 18.8% patients with NV-HAP were trans-
ferred to the ICU from the medical-surgical units: that means a
total of 46.1% of NV-HAP patients spent bed days in the ICU for a
preventable illness. Patients transferred to the ICU remain in hos-
pital for longer. Our data show that transfer to the ICU was associated
with increased LOS: 65.7% of patients transferred to the ICU had a
LOS ≥15 days, compared with 57.6% of all patients. NV-HAP has
been associated with increased mortality38,39; the in-house mor-
tality rate for NV-HAP cases in our study was 15.8%, which was
similar to that reported by Micek et al (15.5%),8 but less than See
et al (30.9%).9 In addition, hospital stays with ICU involvement are
2.5 times costlier than hospital stays with no ICU stay.40 There-
fore, patients in the ICU with NV-HAP contribute to increased
LOS, mortality, and cost.40-42
The societal impact of NV-HAP on the patient can be seen by
comparing discharge disposition with patient location prior to
admission; patients admitted in a hospital should be able to return
to their previous level of function, and require the same level of
care. Regarding discharge to SNFs, the national average among
Medicare patients is 9%43; however, for patients who acquire NV-
HAP, there is an associated 4.13-fold increased risk of discharge to
SNFs.33 Although only 25% of patients were admitted from another
health care facility, 47.2% were discharged to higher-level care
facilities (SNF, acute rehabilitation, or hospice or comfort care). Of
the patients admitted from home, only 40.6% were discharged
back to home. The societal impact for patients not returning to
home adds substantially to the overall cost of NV-HAP, results in a
decreased quality of life in previously independent individuals,
and likely places significant emotional and financial burdens on
both patients and families.38 In addition, the harm from NV-HAP
does not stop after hospital discharge; Kopp et al found that in
patients with spinal injury, 45% suffered consequences of HAP.
Patients who developed NV-HAP showed lower gains in function-
al mobility up to 5 years later, and a higher mortality risk up to 10
years later.44
Based on estimates reported in the literature ($28,000-$40,000
additional costs per case), the cases identified in our study would
generate $36.4 -$52.56 million in extra costs,45,46 and an addition-
al 9,198-11,826 inpatient days.46 There is a further economic impact
to be considered. In U.S. hospitals 30-day readmissions for pneu-
monia, as the admit diagnosis are reported to affect 1 in 5 patients.47
We found a similar readmission rate of 19.3% for NV-HAP. These rates
are comparable with 30-day readmission rates for diseases that
require reporting, such as congestive heart failure,48 which may result
in nonpayment or penalties as part of the U.S. Hospitals Readmis-
sion Reduction Program.
HAP risk factors have been well reported,34-37 and in HAP pre-
vention, the CDC recommends a focus on modifiable risk factors for
prevention.28 However, our study suggested that a narrow focus on
patient-specific risk factors for NV-HAP prevention would limit the
full potential impact of NV-HAP prevention. Previous studies support
that the impact of NV-HAP goes beyond specific patient risk groups
and occurs on all types of hospital units and departments.4,34,37 Our
data provide further support for the findings from these previous
studies. We found that NV-HAP occurs both within and outside of
the ICU in a wide age range of patients, not just older adults. It is
likely that some of these patients were not subjected to active pneu-
monia prevention programs nor routine monitoring for pneumonia;
indeed, current hospital practices’are primarily focused on pre-
vention of VAP and other device-related HAIs that are routinely
monitored.4 The documented care interventions measured in this
study were specifically chosen for their relevance in the preven-
tion of all HAP, both VAP and NV-HAP, and belonged to the VAP
preventive care bundle. Our results found multiple missed care op-
portunities in the 24 hours before diagnosis of pneumonia. Numerous
previous studies have reported that missed fundamental hospital
care is linked to poorer patient outcomes,17,19-25 a finding that is also
supported by our data.
Strengths and limitations
The hospitals in our study were selected through convenience
sampling, a methodology that is prone to selection bias and a high
level of sampling error.49 The use of the CDC criteria to verify each
NV-HAP case was a strength of the study. The retrospective nature
of the study prevents us from identifying the exact reasons for missed
fundamental hospital care; however, reasons from other research

 include labor, material resources, and poor communication.17,21 Fur-
thermore, the ICD-9-CM codes may underestimate the actual
number of NV-HAP cases because a point-prevalence observation
was not conducted. Because we required CDC criteria, cases in
immunocompromised patients may have been missed if cultures
for pneumonia were not obtained, which is often the case. Docu-
mentation of oral care was obtained from the nursing care records,
and because the hospitals included in the study may have a variety
of standards and definition of oral care, the provided oral care may
have included less effective measures for removal of oral plaque,
such as swabbing or foam sponges.
CONCLUSIONS
Pneumonia prevention presents several challenges. A primary
challenge is that NV-HAP remains a hidden harm in hospitals because
there are no requirements in the United States to track hospital-
wide rates of pneumonia. To overcome this challenge, hospitals
should consider the growing body of evidence which supports NV-
HAP as a common HAI, and—as demonstrated in our study—it occurs
in all types and sizes of hospitals and on all types of units. There-
fore, these findings support the use of universally applied NV-
HAP prevention strategies.
There are well-known methods to prevent NV-HAP and most are
related to processes that should be in place in hospitals as part of
fundamental hospital care.50-52 Hospitals can apply a public health
approach and use surveillance and monitoring to follow trends in
NV-HAP rates. Scaling up interventional studies across all units of
a hospital can be daunting. However, all patients, even those who
appear quite healthy, are at some risk. Previous HAP prevention
studies were aimed at specific patient populations; outside of ven-
tilated patients, most intervention studies targeted residents in SNFs
and postoperative settings. These studies demonstrated promis-
ing results that may be adapted for acute care hospitals.50
Furthermore, there are at least 2 interventional studies that suc-
cessfully reduced pneumonia hospital-wide.3,51 Most pneumonia
prevention research relies on therapeutic interventions delivered
with high reliability. These studies also noted that missed care was
associated with cases of NV-HAP; however, no randomized con-
trolled trials in acute care hospitals are currently available in the
literature.
Further surveillance and assessment of NV-HAP incidence is
required to determine the full extent and impact of NV-HAP. NV-
HAP prevention standards should be developed and studied. If a
U.S. national effort was made to address NV-HAP, we predict that
with appropriate intervention to prevent NV-HAP by even 50%,
we could save approximately 9,886 lives, 487,622 extra hospital
days, and $2.43 billion annually.53 When the morality rate from a
preventable hospital harm is as high as 14%-31%, it is time for a
call to action. NV-HAP should be elevated to the same level of
concern, attention, and effort as prevention for other types of
HAIs. We agree with Klompas that NV-HAP is surely “the next
frontier” in HAP prevention.39
