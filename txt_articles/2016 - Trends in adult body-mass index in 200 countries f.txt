Trends in adult body-mass index in 200 countries from 
1975 to 2014: a pooled analysis of 1698 population-based 
measurement studies with 19·2 million participants
NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)*
Summary
Background Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health 
outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and 
in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries.
Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and 
weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends 
from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories (<18·5 kg/m² [underweight], 18·5 kg/m² to 
<20 kg/m², 20 kg/m² to <25 kg/m², 25 kg/m² to <30 kg/m², 30 kg/m² to <35 kg/m², 35 kg/m² to <40 kg/m², ≥40 kg/m² 
[morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior 
probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue.
Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19·2 million adult participants (9·9 million men 
and 9·3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI 
increased from 21·7 kg/m² (95% credible interval 21·3–22·1) in 1975 to 24·2 kg/m² (24·0–24·4) in 2014 in men, and 
from 22·1 kg/m² (21·7–22·5) in 1975 to 24·4 kg/m² (24·2–24·6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men 
ranged from 21·4 kg/m² in central Africa and south Asia to 29·2 kg/m² (28·6–29·8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for 
women the range was from 21·8 kg/m² (21·4–22·3) in south Asia to 32·2 kg/m² (31·5–32·8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. 
Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13·8% (10·5–17·4) to 8·8% 
(7·4–10·3) in men and from 14·6% (11·6–17·9) to 9·7% (8·3–11·1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of 
underweight in 2014, 23·4% (17·8–29·2) in men and 24·0% (18·9–29·3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of 
obesity increased from 3·2% (2·4–4·1) in 1975 to 10·8% (9·7–12·0) in 2014 in men, and from 6·4% (5·1–7·8) to 14·9% 
(13·6–16·1) in women. 2·3% (2·0–2·7) of the world’s men and 5·0% (4·4–5·6) of women were severely obese (ie, have 
BMI ≥35 kg/m²). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0·64% (0·46–0·86) in men and 1·6% (1·3–1·9) in women.
Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, 
if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18% in men and surpass 21% in women; severe 
obesity will surpass 6% in men and 9% in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world’s poorest 
regions, especially in south Asia.

Introduction
High body-mass index (BMI) is an important risk factor 
for cardiovascular and kidney diseases, diabetes, some 
cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders.1–7 Concerns about 
the health and economic burden of increasing BMI have 
led to adiposity being included among the global 
non-communicable disease (NCD) targets, with a target 
of halting, by 2025, the rise in the prevalence of obesity at 
its 2010 level.8,9 Information on whether countries are on 
track to achieve this target is needed to support 
accountability towards the global NCD commitments.10
Two previous studies11–13 estimated global trends in the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity. However, the largest 
health benefi
 ts of weight management are achieved by 
shifting the population distribution of BMI. The only global 
report on mean BMI, which characterises distributional 
shifts, estimated trends to 2008,11 before the global target 
was 
agreed. 
Epidemiological 
studies 
have 
shown 
substantial risks in people with very high BMI—eg, severe 
(≥35 kg/m²) or morbid (≥40 kg/m²) obesity.14 Being 
underweight is also associated with increased risk of 
morbidity and mortality (ie, a so-called J-shaped association) 
and with adverse pregnancy outcomes.4,6,15,16 Very few 
analyses of trends in underweight,17 especially for men, and 
in severe and morbid obesity have been done. Finally, no 
information is available on the likelihood of individual 
countries or the world as a whole achieving the global 
obesity target.
We pooled population-based data to estimate trends 
from 1975 to 2014 in both mean BMI and in prevalence of

BMI categories ranging from underweight to morbid 
obesity. We also estimated the probability of achieving 
the global obesity target.
Methods
Study design
We analysed population-based studies that had measured 
height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older with 
use of a consistent protocol. We estimated trends in mean 
BMI and prevalence of BMI categories (<18·5 kg/m² 
[underweight], 18·5 kg/m² to <20 kg/m², 20 kg/m² to 
<25 kg/m², 25 kg/m² to <30 kg/m², 30 kg/m² to 
<35 kg/m², 35 kg/m² to <40 kg/m², and ≥40 kg/m² 
[morbid obesity]) from 1975 to 2014, in 200 countries and 
territories. We report results for these categories, and for 
total obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) and severe obesity 
(BMI ≥35 kg/m²). Countries and territories were 
organised into 21 regions, mostly on the basis of 
geography and national income (appendix pp 10, 11). The 
exception was a region consisting of high-income 
English-speaking countries because BMI and other 
cardiometabolic risk factors have similar trends in these 
countries, which can be distinct from other countries in 
their geographical region. Our analysis covered men and 
women aged 18 years and older, consistent with the 
Global Monitoring Framework for NCDs.8
Our study had two steps: fi
 rst, we identifi
 ed, accessed, 
and reanalysed population-based studies that had 
measured height and weight; then, we used a statistical 
model to estimate mean BMI and prevalences of BMI 
categories for all countries and years.
Data sources
We used multiple routes for identifying and accessing 
data, including from publicly available sources and 
through requests to various national and international 
organisations, as described in the appendix (pp 2–5). 
We used data sources that were representative of a 
national, sub 
national, or community population and had 
measured height and weight. We did not use self-
reported height and weight because they are subject to 
biases that vary by geography, time, age, sex, and 
socioeconomic characteristics.18–20 Because of these 
variations, present approaches to correcting self-reported 
data leave residual bias and error. Our data inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were designed to ensure population 
representativeness (appendix pp 2–5).
Statistical analysis
The statistical method is described in a statistical paper21 
and in the appendix of a previous paper.22 In summary, the 
model had a hierarchical structure in which estimates for 
each country and year were informed by the country and 
year’s own data, if available, and by data from other years 
in the same country and in other countries, especially 
those in the same region with data for similar time 
periods. The hierarchical structure shares information to 
a greater degree when data are non-existent or weakly 
informative (eg, have a small sample size or are not 
national), and to a lesser extent in data-rich countries 
and regions.
The model incorporated non-linear time trends and age 
patterns; national versus subnational and community 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) for manuscripts published 
in any language between Jan 1, 1950, and March 12, 2013, 
using the search terms “body size”[mh:noexp] OR “body 
height”[mh:noexp] OR “body weight”[mh:noexp] OR “birth 
weight”[mh:noexp] OR “overweight”[mh:noexp] OR 
“obesity”[mh] OR “thinness”[mh:noexp] OR “Waist-Hip 
Ratio”[mh:noexp] or “Waist Circumference”[mh:noexp] or 
“body mass index” [mh:noexp]) AND (“Humans”[mh]) 
AND(“1950”[PDAT] : “2013”[PDAT]) AND (“Health 
Surveys”[mh] OR “Epidemiological Monitoring”[mh] OR 
“Prevalence”[mh]) NOT Comment[ptyp] NOT Case 
Reports[ptyp]. Articles were screened according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria described in the appendix (pp 2–5).
The only global study on trends in mean body-mass index 
(BMI), which characterises shifts in the population distribution 
of BMI, reported trends to 2008 (before the global target on 
obesity was agreed) and no recent data are available. Two 
previous studies estimated global trends in the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity. Neither study reported trends in 
underweight, which is associated with increased risk of 
morbidity, mortality, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, or in 
high levels of BMI (eg, ≥35 or ≥40 kg/m²), which are associated 
with substantial risks of many non-communicable diseases.
Added value of this study
This study provides the longest and most complete picture of 
trends in adult BMI, including, for the fi
 rst time, in underweight 
and severe and morbid obesity, which are of enormous clinical and 
public health interest. We were able to robustly depict this rich 
picture by reanalysing and pooling hundreds of population-based 
sources with measurements of height and weight according to a 
common protocol. We also systematically projected recent trends 
into the future, and assessed the probability of the global obesity 
target being achieved.
Implications of all the available evidence
The world has transitioned from an era when underweight 
prevalence was more than double that of obesity, to one in 
which more people are obese than underweight. However, 
underweight remains a public health problem in the world’s 
poorest regions—namely south Asia and central and east Africa. 
If present trends continue, not only will the world not meet the 
global obesity target, but severe obesity will also surpass 
underweight in women by 2025.

representativeness; and whether data covered both rural 
and urban areas versus only one of them. The model also 
included covariates that help predict BMI, including 
national income (natural logarithm of per-person gross 
domestic product adjusted for infl
 ation and purchasing 
power), proportion of population living in urban areas, 
mean number of years of education, and summary 
measures of availability of diff
 erent food types for human 
consumption as described elsewhere.23,24 We also did an 
analysis without the use of covariates and compared the 
estimates with and without covariates. Estimates with and 
without covariates were virtually identical in most countries 
(appendix pp 147,148) with the exception of a few countries 
that had no data and whose covariates (eg, national income) 
diff
 ered from those of their region (eg, Brunei, Bermuda, 
and North Korea). We report estimates for the model with 
covariates because it had better fi
 t to data, as measured by 
the deviance information criterion.
We analysed mean BMI and each prevalence of a BMI 
category separately. We rescaled the estimated prevalence 
of diff
 erent categories so that their sum was 1·0 in each 
age, sex, country, and year. The mean scaling factor 
across draws was 1·05 for men and 1·07 for women—ie, 
the sum of each separately estimated prevalence was 
close to 1·0. Estimates for regions and the world were 
calculated as population-weighted means of the 
constituent country estimates by age group and sex. For 
presentation, we age-standardised each estimated mean 
and prevalence to the WHO standard population,25 by 
taking weighted means of age–sex-specifi
 c estimates, 
with use of age weights from the standard population. 
We tested how well our statistical model predicted mean 
BMI and the prevalence of each BMI category when a 
country-year did not have data as described in the 
appendix (pp 8,9), which showed that it performed very 
well in terms of its prediction validity.
We estimated mean change in BMI (absolute change for 
mean BMI and relative change for prevalence of BMI 
categories) over the 40 years of analysis, which we report as 
change per decade. We also report the posterior probability 
that an estimated increase or decrease in mean BMI or 
prevalence of a BMI category represented a truly increasing 
or decreasing trend. Additionally, we made separate 
estimates of change for pre-2000 and post-2000 years to 
assess whether the increasing recognition of adiposity as an 
“epidemic” in the 1990s,26 and the subsequent public health 
attention and response,27,28 might have slowed down its rise. 
Finally, we calculated the posterior probability of meeting 
the global obesity target if post-2000 trends continue.

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

Group members had full access to the data in the study 
and the corresponding author had fi

the decision to submit for publication.
Results
We accessed and used 1698 population-based data 
sources, with more than 19·2 million participants 
(9·9 million men and 9·3 million women) aged 18 years 
or older whose height and weight had been measured, in 
186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made 
(appendix pp 143, 144); these 186 countries covered 99% 
of the world’s population. 159 countries had at least 
two data sources, which allowed more reliable trend 
estimates. 827 sources (49%) were national, 236 (14%) 
were subnational, and the remaining 635 (37%) were 
community-based (appendix pp 145, 146). The mean 
number of data sources per country varied between 
regions from 2·8 data sources in Polynesia and 
Micronesia to 34·7 data sources in high-income Asia 
Pacifi
 c. 525 data sources (31%) were from years before 
1995 and another 1173 (69%) data sources from 1995 and 
later. 1314 (77%) sources had data on men and women, 
144 (8%) only on men, and 240 (14%) only on women.
Global age-standardised mean BMI in men increased 
from 21·7 kg/m² (95% CrI 21·3–22·1) in 1975 to 
24·2 kg/m² (24·0–24·4) in 2014, and in women from 
22·1 kg/m² (21·7–22·5) in 1975 to 24·4 kg/m² (24·2–24·6) 
in 2014 (fi
 gure 1); the posterior probability that the 
observed trends were true increases was greater than 
0·9999 for both sexes. The mean increases of 0·63 kg/m² 
per decade (0·53–0·73) for men and 0·59 kg/m² per 
decade (0·49–0·70) for women are equivalent to the 
world’s population having become on average more than 
1·5 kg heavier each decade.
Regional mean BMI in 2014 in men ranged from 
21·4 kg/m² in central Africa and south Asia to 
29·2 kg/m² (95% CrI 28·6–29·8) in Polynesia and 
Micronesia (fi
 gure 1). In women, the range was from 
21·8 kg/m² (21·4–22·3) in south Asia to 32·2 kg/m² 
(31·5–32·8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Mean BMI 
was also high in men and women in high-income 
English-speaking countries, and in women in southern 
Africa and in the Middle East and north Africa.
The largest increase in men’s mean BMI occurred in 
high-income English-speaking countries (1·00 kg/m² per 
decade; posterior probability >0·9999) and in women in 
central Latin America (1·27 kg/m² per decade; posterior 
probability >0·9999). The increase in women’s mean BMI 
was also more than 1·00 kg/m² per decade in Melanesia, 
Polynesia and Micronesia, high-income English-speaking 
countries, southeast Asia, Andean Latin America, and the 
Caribbean. Because of these trends, men and women in 
high-income English-speaking countries in 2014 had 
substantially higher BMIs than those in continental 
Europe, whereas in 1975 their BMI had been similar or 
lower, especially for women (fi
 gure 1). By contrast with 
these large increases, the rise in women’s mean BMI was 
less than 0·2 kg/m² per decade in central Europe, 
southwestern Europe, and high-income Asia Pacifi
 c.
In 1975, age-standardised mean BMI was less than 
19 kg/m² in men in Timor-Leste, Burundi, India,

34·8 kg/m² (33·2–36·3) for women, with mean BMI 
also more than 30 kg/m² in both sexes in some other 
islands in Polynesia and Micronesia, and in women in 
some countries in the Middle East and north Africa 
(eg, Egypt and Kuwait) and the Caribbean.
From 1975 to 2014, trends in men’s BMI ranged from 
virtually fl
 at in Nauru (albeit at a very high level), 
North Korea, and several countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa, to an increase of more than 1·5 kg/m² per decade. 
Similarly, women’s BMI did not change in Bahrain and 
Nauru (both starting at high BMIs), Singapore, Japan, 
North Korea, and several European countries, but 
increased by more than 1·5 kg/m² per decade in some 
countries. BMI increased more slowly after the year 2000 
than in the preceding 25 years in Oceania and in most 
high-income countries for both sexes, and for women in 
most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean 
(fi
 gure 4). By contrast, the post-2000 increase was steeper 
than pre-2000 in men in central and eastern Europe, east 
and southeast Asia, and most countries in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. In other regions, increases in BMI 
before and after 2000 were similar or they had a mixture 
of slow-down and acceleration. The standard deviation of 
BMI also increased from 1975 to 2014 (appendix 
pp 149, 150), which contributed to an increase in the 
prevalence of people at either or both extremes of BMI.
Mean BMI in 2014 varied more across countries in 
women than it did in men. For example, the diff
 erence 
in women’s mean BMI between American Samoa 
(the country with the highest mean BMI) and 
Timor-Leste (the country with the lowest mean BMI) 
was 14·1 kg/m² in 2014, which is equivalent to about a 
35 kg diff
 erence in the mean weight per person, whereas 
in men, the diff
 erence in mean BMI was 12·1 kg/m², 
which is also equivalent to about a 35 kg diff
 erence in 
the mean weight per person (because men tend to be 
taller). Although male and female BMIs were correlated 
across countries, women on average had higher BMI 
than did men in 141 countries in 2014 (appendix 
pp 151, 152). The main exceptions from this sex pattern 
were countries in Europe and in high-income Asia 
Pacifi
 c and English-speaking countries. Changes in 
male and female BMI were weakly correlated across 
countries.
From 1975 to 2014, global age-standardised prevalence 
of underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m²) decreased from 
13·8% (95% CrI 10·5–17·4) to 8·8% (7·4–10·3) in men 
(fi
 gure 5) and from 14·6% (11·6–17·9) to 9·7% (8·3–11·1) 
in women (fi
 gure 6). Compared with the fall in 
underweight, prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) 
increased by a larger amount—from 3·2% (2·4–4·1) in 
1975 to 10·8% (9·7–12·0) in 2014 in men, and from 6·4%

(5·1–7·8) to 14·9% (13·6–16·1) in women. Prevalence of 
obesity surpassed that of underweight in 2004 in women 
and in 2011 in men. 2·3% (2·0–2·7) of the world’s men 
and 5·0% (4·4–5·6) of women were severely obese in 
2014. The global prevalence of morbid obesity 
(BMI ≥40 kg/m²) was 0·64% (0·46–0·86) in men and 
1·6% (1·3–1·9) in women in 2014.
Age-standardised underweight prevalence in south 
Asia, where it is most common, decreased from more 
than 35% in both sexes in 1975 to 23·4% (95% CrI

some reductions. At the other extreme, more than 38% of 
men and more than 50% of women in Polynesia and

Age-standardised prevalence of underweight in 2014 
was less than 1% in men in 68 countries and in women 
in 11 countries (fi
 gure 7). At the other extreme, more 
than 20% of men in India, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, 
Afghanistan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, and a quarter or more 
of women in Bangladesh and India are still underweight. 
In 1975, the proportion had been as high as 37% in 
Indian and Bangladeshi women.
In 2014, more men were obese than underweight in 
136 (68%) of 200 countries; in 113 of these countries, 
more men were severely obese than underweight. For 
women, 
obesity 
surpassed 
underweight 
in 
165 (83%) countries and severe obesity surpassed 
underweight in 135 countries. Obesity prevalence was 
less than 1% in men in Burundi and Timor-Leste and 
1–2% in another 15 countries in central, east, and west 
Africa and in south and southeast Asia. The lowest 
prevalences in women were in Timor-Leste, Japan,

Vietnam, North Korea, Cambodia, Laos, and Bangladesh, 
all less than 5%. At the other extreme, more than 45% of 
men in six island nations in Polynesia and Micronesia, 
and more than 50% of women in 11 such island nations 
were obese. The prevalence of obesity in women in 
several Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries was 
40–50%. Severe obesity surpassed 20% in men and 30% 
in women in some Polynesian and Micronesian islands, 
reaching 33·4% (95% CrI 23·6–43·5) in American 
Samoa in 2014. More than 15% of women in Nauru and 
American Samoa were morbidly obese.
In 
2014, 
about 
266 
million 
men 
(95% 
CrI 
240–295 million) and 375 million women (344–407 million) 
were obese in the world, compared with 34 million men 
(26–44 million) and 71 million women (57–87 million) in 
1975 (fi
 gure 8). 58 million (49–68 million) of these men 
and 126 million (112–141 million) of these women were 
severely obese in 2014. 18·4% of the world’s obese adults 
(118 million) lived in high-income English-speaking 
countries and these countries contained an even larger 
share of the world’s severely obese people (27·1%; 
50 million), followed by 13·9% (26 million) in the Middle 
East and north Africa.
Countries where large numbers of underweight 
people lived in 1975 and in 2014 were mostly large 
countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with an 
increasing share of underweight people living in south 
Asia over time (fi
 gure 9). By contrast with this stability 
of underweight geography, countries with the largest 
number of obese and severely obese people changed 
over these four decades, with more middle-income 
countries joining the USA, especially for women. 
In 2014, slightly more obese men and women lived in 
China than in the USA, and even for severe obesity, 
China moved from 60th place for men and 41st place for 
women in 1975, to 2nd rank for both men and women in 
2014. Nonetheless, more than one in four severely obese 
men and almost one in fi
 ve severely obese women in 
the world still live in the USA.
If post-2000 trends continue, every country has a less 
than 50% probability of meeting the global obesity target, 
with Nauru having the highest probability of about 45% 
(appendix pp 153, 154). The probability of achieving the 
target is less than 10% for men in 194 countries, and for 
women in 174 countries. At the global level, the probability 
of meeting the target is virtually zero. Rather, if present 
trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will 
reach 18% in men and surpass 21% in women; severe 
obesity will surpass 9% in women and 6% in men, and 
will be larger than the projected prevalence of underweight 
in women.
Discussion
Over the past four decades, we have transitioned from a 
world in which underweight prevalence was more than 
double that of obesity, to one in which more people are 
obese than underweight, both globally and in all regions 
except parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The rate of 
increase in BMI since 2000 has been slower than in the 
preceding decades in high-income countries, where 
adiposity became an explicit public health concern 
around this time,27,28 and in some middle-income 
countries. However, because the rate of BMI increase has 
accelerated in some other regions, the global increase in 
BMI has not slowed down. If post-2000 trends continue, 
not only will the world not meet the global target for 
halting the increase in obesity, but also severe obesity will 
surpass underweight in women by 2025. Nonetheless, 
underweight remains a public health problem in south 
Asia and central and east Africa.
We estimated a slightly larger increase in mean BMI 
since 1980 than Finucane and colleagues did,11 especially 
in men, because our estimates for 1980 were lower, 
globally and in most regions; this diff
 erence might be 
because our study included substantially more data, from 
a larger number of countries. Our global estimates of 
overweight prevalence are similar to those reported by 
Stevens and colleagues13 for 2008, and by Ng and 
colleagues for 2013.12 Our estimates for obesity for the 
same years are slightly lower than those of Stevens and 
colleagues and slightly higher than those of Ng and 
colleagues. Furthermore, we estimated a lower prevalence 
of obesity for 1980 than Ng and colleagues had, which 
means we have attributed a larger role to the rise over the 
past few decades for the present extent of obesity. 
Diff
 erences between our study and that of Ng and 
colleagues were greater at the regional level; for example, 
our estimates for obesity prevalence in men in south Asia 
and central, east, and west Africa were less than half of 
those by Ng and colleagues. None of these previous works 
had estimated underweight or severe and morbid obesity, 
which are important clinical and public health outcomes.
The strengths of our study include its unique scope 
of making consistent estimates of mean BMI and the 
prevalence of all BMI categories with clinical and 
public health relevance, including the fi
 rst-ever 
estimates of underweight and severe and morbid 
obesity. These estimates helped reveal the details of the 
transition from underweight to overweight and obesity 
throughout the world. We also reported on the 
probability of each country meeting the global obesity 
target. We put great emphasis on data quality and used 
only population-based data sources that had measured 
height and weight to avoid the bias in self-reported 
data. Characteristics and quality of data sources were 
verifi
 ed by Collaborating Group members (appendix 
pp 2–5). Data were analysed according to a common 
protocol to obtain the required mean and prevalence by 
age and sex, which in turn minimised reliance on

models for fi
 lling such gaps, as done in previous 
studies.11–13 Finally, we pooled data using a statistical 
model designed to take into account the epidemiological 
features of outcomes such as BMI, and one that used 
all available data while giving more weight to national 
data than subnational and community studies.
Despite our eff
 orts in identifying and accessing country-
level data, some countries had few data sources, especially 
those in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Caribbean, and 
central Asia. Additionally, only 42% of sources included 
people older than 70 years. In view of ageing trends 
throughout the world, older people should be included in 
health and nutrition surveys, which have traditionally 
focused on childbearing ages. Even measured height and 
weight data can have error depending on how closely 
measurement protocols are followed. Although data held 
by Collaborating Group members were analysed to 
provide all needed details by sex and age group and BMI 
level, individual participant data could not be accessed for 
19·4% of data used in our analysis, hence conversions 
across categories were still needed; nonetheless, the 
conversion regressions had high predictive accuracy 
(appendix pp 41–55). A novel component of our study is 
that we estimated the prevalences of a complete set of 
BMI categories, but the uncertainty intervals for BMIs of 
30 kg/m² or more and 35 kg/m² or more, prevalences 
that span more than one of the analysed categories, could 
be aff
 ected by the fact that we combined posterior 
distributions across Bayesian models. We did not estimate 
trends in measures of adiposity other than BMI, such as 
waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, because these 
were measured in less than half of all the data sources 
and their measurement became more common after the 
1980s. A systematic review31 of epidemiological studies 
reported that, taken together, studies that had measured 
BMI and either waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio 
do not show that any of the measures of adiposity have 
“superior 
discriminatory 
capability” 
of 
adverse 
cardiometabolic outcomes; any reported diff
 erence was 
“too small to be of any clinical relevance”. We did not 
analyse children and adolescents for two reasons. First, 
because childhood and adolescence is a period of rapid 
growth, BMI cutoff
 s used to defi
 ne underweight, 
overweight, and obesity for children and adolescents are 
diff
 erent from those for adults, and vary by age and sex.32 
Second, time trends in children’s and adolescents’ obesity 
are diff
 erent from those of adults.33
Our results have several implications. First, the global 
focus on the obesity epidemic has largely overshadowed 
the persistence of underweight in some countries. 
Our results show the need to address the remaining 
underweight problem and by doing so reduce risks to 
pregnant women and their newborn infants,15 mortality 
from tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases,34 and 
possibly all-cause mortality, which has a J-shaped 
association.2,3 To address this problem will require social 
and food policies that enhance food security in poor 
households, but also avoid overconsumption of processed 
carbohydrates and other unhealthy foods. Second, although 
adiposity has been consistently shown to be an 
independent risk factor for several NCDs in individual-
level epidemiological studies, at the population level, the 
eff
 ect of rising BMI on the course of mortality reduction 
has so far been somewhat small in high-income 
countries,35,36 possibly because pharma 
cological treatment 
has helped reduce blood pressure and serum cholesterol 
and manage diabetes com 
plications, which are mediators 
of the eff
 ects of BMI on cardiovascular diseases. In low-
income countries, where health systems might not have 
the capacity to identify and treat hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, and diabetes, adiposity might have a larger 
eff
 ect on population health. Furthermore, we have shown 
that some high-income and middle-income regions are 
now facing an epidemic of severe obesity. Even anti-
hypertensive drugs, statins, and glucose lowering drugs 
will not be able to fully address the hazards of such high 
BMI levels,7 and bariatric surgery might be the most 
eff
 ective intervention for weight loss and disease 
prevention and remission.37 However, long-term health 
outcomes of bariatric surgery are largely unknown and it 
is not accessible to most people in low-income and 
middle-income countries because of fi
 nancial and health 
system barriers.
Present interventions and policies have not been able 
to stop the rise in BMI in most countries.38–40 The global 
NCD target on obesity, although ambitious in view of 
past trends, has engendered a new look at policies that 
could slow down and stop the worldwide increase in 
BMI.40–42 To avoid an epidemic of severe obesity, the next 
step must be to implement these policies, and to 
systematically assess their eff
 ect.43
