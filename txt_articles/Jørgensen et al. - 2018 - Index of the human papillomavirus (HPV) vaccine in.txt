Abstract
Background: Unabridged access to drug industry and regulatory trial registers and data reduces reporting bias in
systematic reviews and may provide a complete index of a drug’s clinical study programme. Currently, there is no
public index of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine industry study programmes or a public index of non-
industry funded studies.
Methods: By cross-verification via study programme enquiries to the HPV vaccine manufacturers and regulators
and searches of trial registers and journal publication databases, we indexed clinical HPV vaccine studies as a basis
to address reporting bias in a systematic review of clinical study reports.
Results: We indexed 206 clinical studies: 145 industry and 61 non-industry funded studies. One of the four HPV
vaccine manufacturers (GlaxoSmithKline) provided information on its study programme. Most studies were cross-
verified from two or more sources (160/206, 78%) and listed on regulatory or industry trial registers or journal
publication databases (195/206, 95%)—in particular, on ClinicalTrials.gov (176/195, 90%). However, study results
were only posted for about half of the completed studies on ClinicalTrials.gov (71/147, 48%). Two thirds of the
industry studies had a study programme ID, manufacturer specific ID, and national clinical trial (NCT) ID (91/145,
63%). Journal publications were available in journal publication databases (the Cochrane Collaboration’s Central
Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar and PubMed) for two thirds of the completed studies (92/149, 62%).
Conclusion: We believe we came close to indexing complete HPV vaccine study programmes, but only one of
the four manufacturers provided information for our index and a fifth of the index could not be cross-verified.
However, we indexed larger study programmes than those listed by major regulators (i.e., the EMA and FDA that
based their HPV vaccine approvals on only half of the available trials). To reduce reporting bias in systematic
reviews, we advocate the registration and publication of all studies and data in the public domain.

 Background
Healthcare guidelines often rely on drug manufacturers’
studies,
regulators’
assessments
and
independent
researchers’ systematic reviews of these studies. Drug man-
ufacturers usually conduct study programmes in agreement
with the drug regulators’ pre-approval requirements. How-
ever, more than half of all studies are never published [1, 2]
and the published studies’ intervention effects are often ex-
aggerated in comparison to the unpublished studies [3–5].
This introduces reporting bias that undermines the validity
of systematic reviews. To address reporting bias in system-
atic reviews, it is necessary to use industry and regulatory
trial registers and trial data—in particular, the drug manu-
facturers’ complete study programmes with their corre-
sponding clinical study reports.
A clinical study report of over a thousand pages in length
may be condensed into a ten-page journal publication, i.e.,
a compression factor of 100 [6, 7]. The criteria used to se-
lect the resulting fraction of available data in journal publi-
cations are unknown and journal publications are often
misleading, especially in relation to the reporting of harms
of drug interventions [7–14]. Consequently, some re-
searchers now rely on study programmes and clinical study
reports as their primary or only source of information for
their systematic reviews [7, 13, 15]. The first systematic re-
view of influenza antivirals showed the feasibility of this ap-
proach [15]. The review demonstrated the importance of
using clinical study reports and the shortcomings of relying
only on journal publication database searches (for example,
in PubMed). Although the use of clinical study reports re-
duces the risk of reporting bias, clinical study reports
themselves may still be subject to significant reporting bias
when compared to their underlying data [6, 12, 16].
Currently, there is no easily accessible source to access
study programmes. However, drug manufacturers’ common
technical documents (CTDs) contain lists of the studies in
a study programme that support marketing authorization
applications (MAAs) to regulatory authorities (such as the
European Medicines Agency, EMA, or the Food and Drug
Administration, FDA). Since 2010 and 2015, it has been
possible for researchers to obtain common technical docu-
ments and marketing authorization applications from the
EMA via policies 0043 and 0070, respectively.
Nonetheless, accessing study programmes and unpub-
lished studies and obtaining clinical study reports from
the industry and regulators can prove difficult [13, 17–20].
Therefore, it is not surprising that only a minority of sys-
tematic reviews include unpublished studies (10–20%)
[21, 22] or searches of trial registers (10–50%) [23–26].
Searches of trial registers may lead to the identification of
additional eligible studies in about 20–60% of systematic
reviews [23–26]. To identify unpublished studies and ad-
dress reporting bias, we present here a method for index-
ing the study programmes of the human papillomavirus
(HPV) vaccines as a basis for a systematic review of clin-
ical study reports (see our protocol at PROSPERO:
CRD42017056093 [27]).
Methods
Our study involved indexing the HPV vaccine industry
study programmes and non-industry funded clinical stud-
ies using a six-step process that focuses on identifying un-
published studies (see Additional file 1 for a detailed
description of steps 1 to 6 and Additional file 2 for the e-
mail correspondence with the HPV vaccine manufacturers
in step 6).
In step 1, we corresponded with the EMA and obtained a
list of their holdings of clinical study reports and Module
2.5 of the common technical document (CTD) for one
HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) that listed all studies in the Garda-
sil 9 study programme. This gave us a basic study list with
industry study identifiers that usually consist of a prefix that
identifies the HPV vaccine being tested (for example, HPV-
xxx for Cervarix and V50x-xxx for Gardasil studies). In
mid-2017, we were granted access to EMA’s holdings of
Modules 2.5 of two other HPV vaccines (Cervarix and Gar-
dasil), but we have not received the modules yet.
In step 2, we expanded the basic list by searching 45 trial
registers: eight industry trial registers (where the manufac-
turers had been involved or possibly involved in one or
more HPV vaccine studies), 32 international and regional
trial registers chosen according to their level of impact
(e.g., https://clinicaltrials.gov and http://apps.who.int/trial-
search/ are used globally and were considered high im-
pact) or where one or more HPV vaccine studies had been
conducted (e.g., we searched the Chinese Clinical Trial
Registry: http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx, since several
HPV vaccine studies had been conducted in China) and
five regulatory registers (where the regulators had been in-
volved or possibly involved with the assessment or ap-
proval of one or more HPV vaccines, e.g., EMA and FDA).
In step 3, we searched the HPV vaccines’ regulatory drug
approval packages (DAPs) from FDA and the HPV vac-
cines’ European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) from
EMA to identify studies possibly not listed in the 45 trial
registers.
In step 4, we conducted searches of three journal publica-
tion databases (the Cochrane Collaboration’s Central Regis-
ter of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and PubMed) to
identify studies possibly not listed in the 45 trial registers.
We also searched WikiLeaks for HPV vaccine studies (or
related information). When possible, we matched indexed
studies to their corresponding journal publications.
In step 5, we added studies listed in recent HPV vaccine
regulatory and independent reviews to verify the studies’
existence and add any studies that we had not identified.
In step 6, we sent the assembled indexes to the corre-
sponding HPV vaccine manufacturers and requested them
Jørgensen et al. Systematic Reviews  (2018) 7:8 
Page 2 of 10
 to verify the indexed studies’ existence and add any studies
that we had not identified. We gave the manufacturers a
1-month deadline to respond and sent a reminder if the
manufacturer had not responded within 1 to 2 weeks.
We indexed interventional prospective preventive (not
therapeutic) comparative (with two or more intervention
arms) HPV vaccine clinical studies (and their follow-up
studies) in humans. We classified studies by cross-
verification as follows:
1) “Definitely exists” (cross-verification of a study’s
existence from two or more sources)
2) “Probably exists” (verification of a study’s existence
from one source)
3) “Probably does not exist” (no manufacturer or
regulatory verification but with a passing reference
identified from another source)
We indexed studies from the first two categories. No
language restriction was applied, and Google Translate
was used for non-familiar languages. By comparing all
gathered study IDs, we deleted duplicate entries.
One author (LJ) conducted steps 1 to 6 of the indexing
and extracted data. The steps were conducted from Octo-
ber 2016 to July 2017. A second author (TJ) checked the
indexing and data extraction. Any disagreements were
solved by discussion or by consulting the third author
(PCG). One author (LJ) classified the studies according to
the likelihood of their existence (e.g., “definitely exists”)
and assessed the degree of manufacturer involvement (i.e.,
studies that were funded or partly funded by the manufac-
turers were classified as industry studies). A second author
(TJ) checked the classifications.
For each study, one author (LJ) extracted the following
study information: type, phase (I-IV), intervention type,
completion status (completed or on-going), centre status
(single or multicentre), participant characteristics (age,
gender and number of participants), programme ID, manu-
facturer ID, trial register ID, results availability, and modes
of identification.
Results
We excluded 79 non-comparative prospective clinical
studies and indexed 206 studies: 145 industry and 61 non-
industry funded studies with a total of 623,005 participants.
One of the four HPV vaccine manufacturers (GlaxoS-
mithKline) provided us with an index of 81 GlaxoSmithK-
line studies and four MedImmune studies (MedImmune
and GlaxoSmithKline collaborated in the early develop-
ment of GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix HPV vaccine) (see
Fig. 1, Table 1 and Additional files 1, 2, 3; and our study’s
PRISMA statement, Additional file 4).
Two thirds of the indexed studies were randomized
clinical trials (136/206, 66%) and about half were phase
III studies (89/206, 43%). The remaining studies were ei-
ther follow-ups (23 industry and three non-industry),
non-randomized (24 and 18), or of unclear design (two
industry studies). Most randomized clinical trials had ei-
ther another vaccine (for example, the hepatitis A vac-
cine, Havrix) or the HPV vaccine aluminum adjuvants as
comparators (111/136, 82%); only 17 studies used a “pla-
cebo” (13%; note that if a study reported that it used a
“placebo” comparator, but the study did not describe the
“placebo”, i.e., as saline, we noted the study’s comparator
as “placebo”). A third of the industry studies and no
non-industry study used adjuvant comparisons (36/96
vs. 0/40, P < 0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). More industry
studies were phase III (79/145 vs. 10/61, P < 0.0001)
while more non-industry studies used a “placebo” com-
parison (12/40 vs. 5/96, P = 0.0002) and were phase IV
studies (22/61 vs. 9/145, P < 0.0001) (see Table 1).
GlaxoSmithKline’s study programme primarily used
its Cervarix HPV vaccine (65/69, 94%) and included
more follow-up studies than the Merck Sharp &
Dohme’s study programme (18/69 vs. 5/66, P = 0.006)
that mainly used its Gardasil or Gardasil 9 HPV vac-
cines (55/66, 83%, see Table 1).
Most industry studies were solely industry funded
(128/145, 88%), but Merck Sharp and Dohme co-funded
more studies than GlaxoSmithKline (17/66 vs. 0/69, P <
0.0001; ten Merck studies were co-funded with univer-
sities, four with hospitals and three with governmental
healthcare institutions) (see Table 1).
Most studies were completed (149/206, 72%). In com-
parison to industry studies, non-industry studies were
on average of a longer duration (42.2 vs. 36.9 months),
while industry studies were more often multicentre (79/
106 vs. 13/53, P < 0.0001) (see Table 1).
Most studies included only females (151/206, 73%)
and had participants younger than 18 years (105/206,
51%). More non-industry studies included both sexes
(19/61 vs. 22/145, P = 0.013), but Merck Sharp and
Dohme funded more studies on both sexes than GlaxoS-
mithKline (16/66 vs. 4/69, P = 0.003). Industry studies
had on average twice as many participants enrolled com-
pared to non-industry studies (3602 vs. 1767). For multi-
centre studies, the mean number of participants was
similar for industry and non-industry studies (2388 vs.
2745), but non-industry studies enrolled twice as many
participants per study centre compared to industry stud-
ies (128 vs. 66, see Table 1).
Most indexed studies were cross-verified from two
or
more
sources
(i.e.,
“definitely
exists”,
160/206,
78%).
Merck
Sharp
and
Dohme’s
Gardasil
and
Gardasil 9 programme had more studies with a single
verification than GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix programme
(i.e., “probably exists”, 16/66 vs. 0/69, P < 0.0001, see
Table 2).

Page 3 of 10
 Most industry studies had a study programme spe-
cific ID (125/145, 86%), manufacturer specific ID (98/
145, 68%) and the US national clinical trial (NCT)
ID, which was also used by most non-industry studies
(132/145 vs. 44/61, P = 0.0009). About two thirds of
the industry studies used all three ID types (91/145,
63%, see Table 2).
Most of the included studies were listed in industry,
public or regulatory registers or databases (195/206,
95%)—in
particular,
on
ClinicalTrials.gov
(176/195,
90%). However, study results were only posted for
about half of the completed studies on ClinicalTrials.-
gov (71/147, 48%), but more completed industry stud-
ies posted results on ClinicalTrials.gov compared to
non-industry studies (65/110 vs. 6/37, P < 0.0001, see
Table 2).
We reconciled the index with journal publications, but
did not run all-inclusive journal publication database
searches as recommended for systematic reviews, since
clinical study reports (not journal publications) were our
focus. Journal publications were available for two thirds
of the completed studies (92/149, 62%, see Table 2).
Discussion
Our index showed serious deficiencies and variability in
the availability of HPV vaccine studies and data. For ex-
ample, only half of the completed studies listed on Clini-
calTrials.gov posted their results. The clinical study
reports we obtained via our index process confirmed
that the amount of information and data are vastly
greater than that in journal publications. For example,
the journal publication for one GlaxoSmithKline Cer-
varix study (HPV-008) is 14 pages long [28] while its
publicly available corresponding clinical study report is
more than 7000 pages long [29], even though it is a
shortened interim report.
Identification of some studies involved a considerable
amount of work and a fifth of the index could not be
cross-verified. We indexed studies that we would not
have been able to index if we only relied on the journal
publication databases. For example, one Cervarix ran-
domized clinical trial (HPV-002) was only listed on
GlaxoSmithKline’s trial register. The index that GlaxoS-
mithKline provided us with contained three Cervarix
meta-analyses that were only identifiable by their GSK

 ID (i.e., 205206, 207644, and 205639), and the index did
not include three randomized clinical trials (HPV-009
and HPV-016 and the prematurely terminated HPV-078)
that were listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. One Cervarix trial
(HPV-049)
and
three
Gardasil
studies
(V501–001,
V501–002, and V501–004) were only identified via
regulatory registers or correspondence. One Gardasil
follow-up study (for V501–005) only had a journal pub-
lication listed in PubMed without any manufacturer-
specific ID or registration. Four non-industry studies
were published in journal publications but were not
registered in any of the 45 trial registers. Three non-
industry studies were only listed on regional trial regis-
ters (Australia: https://www.anzctr.org.au/; Germany:
https://www.drks.de/; and India: http://ctri.nic.in/) (see
Additional files 2 and 3).
We also indexed more studies than those listed in the
holdings of major regulators. For example, EMA con-
ducted a review (of the relation between HPV vaccination
and two syndromes: postural orthostatic tachycardia syn-
drome, POTS and complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS)
[30] that EMA believed was based on the manufacturers’
complete HPV vaccine study programmes (“GSK [GlaxoS-
mithKline] has conducted a review of all available data
from clinical studies…with Cervarix”; and “The MAH
[Market Authorisation Holder, i.e., Merck Sharp and
Dohme] has reviewed data from all clinical studies of the
qHPV vaccine [Gardasil]” (30,31)). However, when we

bAdjuvant comparisons contained, for example, the aluminum adjuvants used in Cervarix and Gardasil/Gardasil 9, i.e., aluminum hydroxide (Al[OH]3) and
amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAHS), respectively

 compared the manufacturers’ study programmes (submit-
ted to EMA, see Additional file 1) with our index (see
Table 1 and Additional file 3), we found that only half (38/
79, 48%) of the manufacturers’ randomized clinical trials
and follow-ups of Cervarix and Gardasil completed before
the submission dates in July 2015 were included (EMA’s re-
view did not assess Gardasil 9) [30, 31]. Similarly, the FDA’s
Drug Approval Packages (DAPs) only mentioned half (32/
60, 53%) of the randomized clinical trials and follow-ups
that were completed before the vaccines’ date of the Drug
Approval Packages (Cervarix: 17/36, 47%; Gardasil: 6/11,
54%; and Gardasil 9: 9/13, 69%). We find this very
disturbing.
To our knowledge, our study is the first with the aim
of indexing a complete study programme. We do not
know if the considerable reporting bias we found is
generalizable to all drugs and vaccines, but similar in-
dustry examples exist for oseltamivir [15], rofecoxib
[32], and rosiglitazone where 83% (35/42) of the study
programme
was
unpublished

aFor “definitely exists” studies we demanded cross-verification of a studies existence from two or more sources. For ‘probably exists’ studies we demanded verifica-

bThe HPV vaccine manufacturers usually identified their HPV vaccine study programmes with specific identifiers, for example, “HPV-xxx” for Cervarix and “V50x-
xxx” Gardasil and Gardasil 9
cThe HPV vaccine manufacturers usually identified their HPV vaccine studies with manufacturer specific identifiers, for example, GlaxoSmithKline used a six-digit
identifier (e.g., 104,896) and Merck Sharp & Dohme used a seven-digit identifier (e.g., 2004_081)
dSee Additional file 1 for a complete list of the trial registers and databases that we searched
e110 of the 145 industry studies and 39 of the 61 non-industry studies were completed and assessed for publication status
f”Probably not published” studies were categorized as such if they were not identified as journal publications in the searches we performed (see Methods and
Additional files 1 and 3)

 important when there is high risk of reporting bias,
which often is the case for industry funded drug trials.
Our approach should therefore be considered for sys-
tematic reviews of drugs and vaccines. Steps 2 and 4
contributed quantitatively the most to the identification
and cross-verification of studies—in particular, searches
on ClinicalTrials.gov and the HPV vaccine manufac-
turers’ trial registers. Searches of regulatory registers and
journal publication databases contributed to a lesser ex-
tent. Steps 1, 3, 5 and 6 contributed mainly to the verifi-
cation of some studies (see Additional files 1 and 3).
Our six-step process is reproducible, the step sequence
is interchangeable and most steps could be performed
simultaneously. For example, we started by correspond-
ing with EMA, since we are familiar with EMA’s hand-
ling of study programmes and clinical study reports [27].
This correspondence helped us get started (but EMA re-
sponse times may prove very slow and EMA often de-
nies data requests (18)). The index took approximately
3 months to assemble. Researchers may save time if they
perform the steps simultaneously and focus on steps 2
and 6. For example, researchers could start requesting
the drug manufacturers’ study programmes and subse-
quently make an independent index and compare the
two. However, correspondence with manufacturers may
prove challenging and slow. Only one of the four HPV
vaccine manufacturers (GlaxoSmithKline) provided us
with study programme information, which we received
9 months after our initial request. Merck Sharp and
Dohme responded to our enquiry, but did not provide
study programme information. Shanghai Zerun Biotech-
nology and Xiamen Innovax Biotech did not respond to
our inquiries (Additional files 1, 2, 3, and 5).
Compared to industry studies, non-industry funded
studies were registered less often (for example, on Clinical-
Trials.gov) and posted less study results. Non-industry re-
searchers are not legally required to register their studies,
adhere to industry reporting guidelines (the International
Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements
for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, ICH:
http://www.ich.org/) or produce clinical study reports un-
less their results are used to support a drug’s marketing
authorization application. This involves a high risk of
reporting bias. Therefore, we recommend that non-
industry funders require researchers to register their stud-
ies and commit to reporting guidelines similar to the ICH.
Finally, although study programme and clinical study re-
port access from the industry and regulators have im-
proved since 2010 [17], access is often slow and inefficient
[18]. In May 2014, one of us (TJ) requested the HPV vac-
cine clinical study reports from EMA. The request was
initially declined by EMA because, “disclosure would
undermine the protection of commercial interests”. TJ
successfully appealed, but EMA has only released 18
incomplete clinical study reports more than 3 years after
the initial request (as of 1 July 2017), which is only half of
the clinical study reports included in the EMA review (18/
38) [30] and a fifth of our indexed randomized clinical in-
dustry trials (18/96).
Conclusion
Authors of systematic reviews may recognize and reduce
reporting bias if they adopt our index process of study
programmes. We believe we came close to indexing
complete HPV vaccine study programmes, but only one
of the four HPV vaccine manufacturers provided infor-
mation for our index and a fifth of the index could not
be cross-verified. However, we indexed larger study pro-
grammes than those listed by major regulators (i.e., the
EMA and FDA that based their HPV vaccine approvals
on only half of the available trials). To reduce reporting
bias in systematic reviews, we advocate the registration
and publication of all studies and data in the public do-
main and that non-industry studies register and adhere
to reporting guidelines similar to the ICH.
