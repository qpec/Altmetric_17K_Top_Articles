Abstract
Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) affect 2.5 million Americans per year and survivors of TBI can 
develop long-term impairments in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functions. Currently, there 
are no treatments available to stop the long-term effects of TBI. Although the primary injury can 
only be prevented, there is an opportunity for intervention during the secondary injury, which 
persists over the course of hours to years after the initial injury. One promising strategy is to 
modulate destructive pathways using nucleic acid therapeutics, which can downregulate 
“undruggable” targets considered difficult to inhibit with small molecules; however, the delivery of 
these materials to the central nervous system is challenging. We engineered a neuron-targeting 
nanoparticle which can mediate intracellular trafficking of siRNA cargo and achieve silencing of 
mRNA and protein levels in cultured cells. We hypothesized that soon after an injury, 
nanoparticles in the bloodstream may be able to infiltrate brain tissue in the vicinity of areas with a 
compromised blood brain barrier (BBB). We find that, when administered systemically into 
animals with brain injuries, neuron-targeted nanoparticles can accumulate into the tissue adjacent 
to the injured site and downregulate a therapeutic candidate.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability for young people and 
it is estimated that 5.3 million people in the US live with a TBI-related disability.1 Survivors 
of TBI can develop life-long impairment in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functions. 
Currently, clinical care of TBI patients is palliative due to the lack of therapeutics available 
to prevent long-term effects, indicating there is a need to develop new technology. In the 
sequence of events after an injury, the primary injury can only be prevented however there is 
an opportunity for intervention during the secondary injury. Secondary injuries can develop 
over the course of hours to years after the initial insult, during which a cascade of destructive 
pathways (e.g. glutamate excitotoxicity and inflammation) ultimately leads to cell death of 
neurons and glia, either as a direct result of the injury or as collateral damage.2–3 These 
destructive pathways can be chronically activated leading to long-term deterioration of cell 
populations in the brain4. As more molecular responses to dysregulated homeostasis in the 
brain are uncovered, one promising strategy is to mitigate destructive pathways or promote 
protective pathways using nucleic acid therapeutics. In particular, delivery of siRNA can 
downregulate gene candidates which do not have small molecule antagonists in order to 
exert neuroprotective properties, or as a tool to screen for potential therapeutic targets in 
animal models before time- and cost-intensive small molecule development is initiated. In 
addition to the delivery of siRNA, an increasing number of therapeutic microRNAs have 
been identified for intervention in brain injuries.5–7
Traversing the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) in a healthy brain remains a significant 
hurdle for macromolecule interventions designed to function in the central nervous system.8 
Beyond entry into the tissue, siRNA cargos in particular must also navigate into cell types of 
interest, and escape from intracellular vesicles into the cytoplasm where they can engage the 
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) machinery. Nanoparticles offer a solution to 
achieve trafficking of systemically-administered nucleic acids, as they can protect the 
sensitive cargo in the vasculature and encode functions to overcome bottlenecks in both the 
extracellular and intracellular transport pathway. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus9 and 
rabies virus10 have evolved mechanisms to bypass the tightly regulated layer of endothelial 
cells that separates the brain from the vasculature, by hijacking retrograde transport 
machinery to infiltrate the brain. Even without this BBB-bypassing activity, in the context of 
traumatic brain injury, resulting physical breaches in vasculature may offer a window during 
which small molecule drugs can diffuse through the otherwise difficult-to-traverse BBB11. 
This strategy can also apply to the transport of nanoparticulate materials.12–13 Our group has 
previously engineered a peptide-based nanoparticle system for siRNA delivery that is both 
targeted and can mediate endosomal escape after cellular internalization using components 
inspired by biological systems such as viruses.14–15 This nanoparticle system was built by 
complexing siRNA with a peptide that incorporates in tandem two components: a 
membrane-interactive peptide and a targeting peptide. The application of a tumor-targeting 
version of this technology decreased tumor burden when applied to a model of orthotopic 
disseminated ovarian cancer.14 We hypothesized that these tandem peptide nanoparticles

 could be adapted for use in delivery of nucleic acid cargos to impact secondary cellular 
damage that arises in areas surrounded by compromised vasculature following TBIs.
After a TBI, neurons are a particularly vulnerable population, and their loss is thought to be 
responsible for the many negative repercussions found in TBI survivors.16 Nanoparticles can 
be encoded with the ability to target specific cell types,17–20 and once in these cells, to traffic 
cargo to the cytosol, which is an important consideration for siRNA delivery to engage the 
RISC silencing machinery. In order to target therapeutic nucleic acid cargoes to neurons, we 
re-engineered our tumor-targeted peptide-based delivery system to include a neuron-
targeting peptide that was taken from the coat protein of rabies virus.21–22 Our re-engineered 
tandem peptide nanoparticle system was targeted to neurons in a modular design, and 
retained its ability to form sub-100 nm particles while attaining the ability to downregulate 
genes in neuronal cells in culture. In a mouse model of penetrating TBI, we delineated the 
transient time window during which nanoparticles administered intravenously are able to 
infiltrate into the injury site and translocate into neurons. Furthermore, nanoparticles 
carrying a potential therapeutic, siRNA against caspase 3, achieved downregulation of 
protein levels in the injured brain.
Results and Discussion
Our goal was to build a nanoparticle system that could infiltrate brain tissue by leveraging 
the transient access to the brain tissue that arises after a TBI23 to deliver siRNA cargo into 
neurons (Figure 1A). In order to target neuronal populations, a tandem peptide nanoparticle 
system developed in our lab was re-engineered to incorporate the targeting peptide from 
rabies virus, RVG.21 The optimal configuration between targeting peptide and an 
intracellular trafficking peptide, transportan (TP), was investigated by synthesizing either an 
N-terminal transportan (TP-RVG) or an N-terminal targeting peptide (RVG-TP; Figure 1A). 
These cationic peptides were used to determine amounts of peptide required to complex 
siRNA into nanoparticles. The hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticles were measured after 
formulation at 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 peptide:siRNA ratios (charge ratios of 2.86, 1.43, and 
0.71, respectively). Regardless of which peptide was at the N-terminus of the tandem 
peptide, particles formed at the same ratio resulted in the same hydrodynamic diameters 
(Figure 1B), which was expected because the physicochemical properties of the peptides 
remain the same in both orientations. Particles increased in size at a peptide:siRNA ratio of 
10:1, likely due to the phenomenon of colloid aggregation that occurs with neutral surface 
charges.24 Next, the particles were evaluated for their ability to mediate gene silencing of a 
model endogenous gene, peptidylprolyl isomerase B (Ppib), in the mouse neuroblastoma cell 
line, Neuro-2a (Figure 1C). Despite the two peptides forming particles at the same ratio, the 
formulation that incorporated transportan at the N-terminus had significantly improved gene 
silencing activity compared to when this peptide was located at the C-terminus.
A series of experiments were designed to determine why peptide with N-terminally located 
transportan and C-terminally located targeting peptide was more efficient at delivering 
siRNA. We first tested the hypothesis that this configuration of transportan and targeting 
peptide led to a greater binding and uptake of material by cells. Cells were incubated with 
the designated concentrations of nanocomplexes to determine the amount of material

 associated with cells when internalization pathways are active (37 °C, binding and uptake; 
Figure 2A) or not active (4 °C, binding only; Figure 2B). The amount of nanoparticle 
association was measured using flow cytometry by detecting the fluorescence of 5-
carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled peptide. We observed elevated cell association of 
nanocomplexes with N-terminal targeting peptides at both temperatures, indicating that 
increased particle binding and uptake was not likely to be responsible for the improved 
silencing efficiency mediated by N-terminal transportan conformation. Next, we tested 
whether the orientation of transportan influences nanoparticle escape from intracellular 
vesicles after internalization, by performing the assay in the presence or absence of the small 
molecule chloroquine. It is known that chloroquine disrupts endosomal acidification and can 
therefore aid in escape of nanoparticles trapped in endocytic vesicles after internalization.25 
The addition of chloroquine resulted in similar levels of gene silencing for both peptide 
configurations with no statistical difference between the two formulations at matched 
peptide:siRNA ratios, as determined by one-way ANOVA analysis (Figure 2C), indicating 
that the N-terminal position of transportan plays a role in cytosolic delivery. The importance 
of N- or C-terminal orientation has been observed for other membrane-active peptides, such 
as melittin,26 presumably because membrane interaction is dictated by certain residues, and 
naturally-occurring peptides are found in specific orientations of the native protein. We also 
noted that in previous work, RVG was located on the N-terminus,21 but the activity of the 
intracellular trafficking peptide was the driving factor that dictated ~50% of the gene 
silencing activity in our targeted delivery system, as estimated based on our chloroquine 
transfection study.
Using the optimal configuration of transportan and targeting peptide, the importance of the 
targeting ligand was evaluated in a neuronal cell line, Neuro-2a. Neuro-2a cells express the 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Figure 3A), a receptor that is thought to be primarily 
responsible for rabies virus glycoprotein binding.27 Nanoparticles were targeted with either 
RVG or a control peptide (MAT), a sequence taken from a different portion of the same 
rabies virus glycoprotein as RVG, and applied to Neuro-2a cells. MAT-targeted 
nanoparticles mediated significantly less knockdown of Pbib, compared with RVG-targeted 
nanoparticles (Figure 3B). When uptake of nanoparticles was evaluated using fluorescence 
microscopy by tracking FAM labeled peptides and Dylight-647 labeled siRNA, significantly 
less uptake of both peptide and siRNA was seen when particles were targeted with MAT 
compared with RVG (Figure 3C).
The optimized targeted nanoparticle formulation was then applied to deliver siRNA against a 
potential therapeutic gene. In TBIs, the secondary injuries that arise in response to the 
primary event include dysregulation of the BBB, edema, ectopic release of excitatory 
neurotransmitters, and inflammation.4 These indirect effects can occur chronically and cause 
widespread death of neurons in the brain over the course of hours to years after the initial 
injury. To prevent the apoptosis of neurons caused by the secondary injury, we delivered 
siRNA against caspase 3. Caspase 3 is known to be a main player in apoptosis after TBIs28 
and small molecule and peptide therapies targeted to caspase 3 have been explored29–30. We 
first validated siRNA sequences against caspase 3 and found that levels of mRNA after 
caspase 3 knockdown were decreased to approximately 50% after 48 hours (Figure 4A). 
Since the mediator of damage is CASP3 protein, we then evaluated the ability of our

 targeted nanocomplex to suppress CASP3 protein levels by Western blot (Figure 4B). We 
found a more extensive decrease in protein levels compared with mRNA levels, with over 
90% of the CASP3 protein levels decreased after siRNA treatment. To simulate neurons in 
apoptotic states, we probed the levels of CASP3 protein in the presence of the 
chemotherapeutic staurosporine, a well-documented inducer of apoptosis. Activation of the 
apoptotic cascade can be inferred based on the presence of the activated fragments of 
cleaved CASP3 (17KDa and 19KDa) in Neuro-2a cells treated with staurosporine (Figure 
4B). When siCasp3 was delivered, both the zymogen and activated forms of CASP3 were 
significantly decreased.
In the presented platform, neuron-targeted nanoparticles were designed to leverage the 
transiently compromised vasculature after a traumatic brain injury to gain access to brain 
tissue. Because this breach in the BBB offers only temporary access to the brain tissue, a 
nanoparticle treatment would be best administered within 24 hours after injury. To enable a 
formulation that could be deployable in the field, or wherever patients experience trauma, 
we tested the stability of our RVG targeted nanoparticles when stored in ambient conditions. 
Nanoparticles were able to maintain their size (Figure 4C) and their knockdown activity 
(Figure 4D) after 24 hours of storage at room temperature. Furthermore, nanoparticles stored 
for up to 7 days maintain their size, and likely their activity since the cargo should be 
protected in nanoparticle form (SI Figure 1).
With the basic criteria of our platform credentialed in vitro, we applied our siRNA delivery 
carrier to an animal model of TBI. We modeled the TBI to mimic penetrating injuries using 
a series of needle stick wounds applied in a controlled manner via a stereotaxic apparatus 
(Figure 5A). The wounds were inflicted on the cortex and hippocampus of mice on only one 
hemisphere of the brain, whereas the contralateral hemisphere of the brain was not directly 
injured to serve as a control. One important caveat is that the uninjured contralateral tissue 
may be indirectly affected by signaling pathways that are activated in response to injury; for 
example changes in vascular permeability at the whole brain level have been observed in 
response to injury, although the mechanisms are currently unknown.12, 23 The siRNA/
peptide nanocomplexes were labeled with a far-red dye, VivoTag 750, to enable sensitive 
detection of material in animal tissue. Sham injuries were performed by removing the skull 
but not inducing shear injuries in the brain tissue, in order to discriminate surgery-mediated 
particle accumulation from that attributable to the deeper shear injuries (SI Figure 2). When 
nanoparticles were administered into the circulation 5 minutes after the sham injury, we 
observed a modest signal increase concentrated in a ring where the skull was removed, likely 
caused by damaged vasculature on the dura made by the drill. There was no evidence of 
peptide accumulation in the deeper brain tissue in sham injured animals. In order to 
quantitatively observe the kinetics of vascular permeability to nanoparticles, nanoparticles 
were delivered intravenously 5 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours after injury, 
and brains were collected 1 hour after each delivery to assess nanoparticle infiltration 
(Figure 5B, 5C). Notably, the contralateral side of the injured brain displayed similar levels 
of nanoparticle accumulation to that observed in completely uninjured mice, supporting the 
interpretation that material uptake is largely driven by the conditions at the immediate injury 
site at least in the early response. We do note a slight increase in accumulation on the 
contralateral side of the brain at 1 hour after injury. Although this result was not statistically

 significant, it may be that the biological response to injury increases vascular permeability 
beyond the local site of the damaged tissue.12 We also noted that free siRNA accumulated 
into injured tissue to greater levels than observed with complexed siRNA, likely due to the 
small size and negative charge of free siRNA which prevents binding and sequestration into 
off-target tissue (SI Figure 3). However, free unmodified siRNA has negligible silencing 
activity (SI Figure 4) and is vulnerable to degradation when unprotected in the vasculature. 
The differential distribution between free siRNA and siRNA-nanoparticles also suggests that 
the nanoparticles are stable in vivo, such that the majority of siRNA remains complexed with 
peptide in the vasculature. On the injured hemisphere of the brain, we observed nanoparticle 
accumulation at the injury site up to 6 hours, followed by a significant decrease at 24 hours. 
This observation is consistent with other models of brain injury, where infiltration of 
macromolecules into the brain tissue from the blood is maximal at 6 hours after the injury, 
likely mitigated by progression of edema that increases local pressure.31
To more specifically localize the delivered material within the brain tissue, brains were 
sectioned and stained for peptide using an anti-fluorescein antibody combined with staining 
for glia using the marker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; Figure 5D), microglia using the 
marker ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; Figure 5E), or neurons using the 
marker NeuN (Figure 5F). There was no detectable peptide material observed in glia and 
microglia (Figure 5D–E). In contrast, inspecting the neuronal population in the cortex near 
sites of the injury revealed that although not all neurons at the injured site are associated 
with detectable levels of peptide, the majority of peptide signal localized with neurons 
(Figure 5F). The reputed receptor for rabies virus, and presumably RVG peptide, is the 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor27. We stained sections with a fluorophore-labeled α-
bungarotoxin, a high affinity ligand for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and found that 
while some co-localization of peptide with α-bungarotoxin positive cells was evident, we 
also observed examples of peptide localized in cells not positive for α-bungarotoxin (SI 
Figure 5). Possible explanations for this observation are: alternative protein complexes are 
thought to have a role in rabies virus binding and entry32, and the peptide from the rabies 
virus used in our particles may not be sufficient to confer the same specificity as the full 
protein. In order to quantitatively support the microscopy images, we counted GFAP+, 
Iba1+, and NeuN+ cells that co-stained peptide+ cells observed in several fields of view from 
brain sections of three different mice (Figure 5G). The peptide+NeuN+ double positive cells 
were 80% of the total peptide+ population, whereas peptide+GFAP+ and peptide+Iba1+ 
double positive cells were less than 2% each of the total peptide+ population, supporting that 
the majority of material was trafficked to neuronal cells.
Based on the observations that neuron-targeted nanocomplexes accumulated at the site of 
injury and delivered material was taken up by neurons, we administered nanocomplexes 
carrying a therapeutic gene and evaluated their ability to mediate protein knockdown in 
regions proximal to the injury site. We employed the same penetrating injury model of TBI 
used above, and nanoparticles carrying either control siRNA or siRNA against CASP3 were 
delivered intravenously 5 minutes after the injury. Three days post-injury, brains were 
dissected to isolate the injured area of the cortex, as well as the corresponding tissue region 
on the contralateral uninjured hemisphere. The resulting tissue samples were processed for 
analysis of protein expression by Western blotting. A decrease in CASP3 protein levels was

 observed in the injured hemisphere when siCasp3 was administered, relative to the delivery 
of siCtrl (Figure 6A). Quantification of these results showed ~80% knockdown of CASP3 in 
the damaged region of the injured hemisphere (Figure 6B). By contrast, in the contralateral 
hemisphere, no knockdown was observed following either nanoparticle treatment (Figure 
6C, D). Lack of silencing in the contralateral hemisphere was consistent with the limited 
particle accumulation observed in this side of the brain (Figure 5C).
Conclusions
TBI remains a major cause of disability with no therapeutic treatments available. The 
delivery of nanoparticles into the central nervous system for nucleic acid delivery has 
remained a challenge due to the poor permeability of the BBB to nanoparticles and the 
requirement to localize nucleic acid cargoes to the cytosol or nucleus of cells. Existing 
approaches have focused on local delivery of material, either into the cerebrospinal fluid 
reservoirs33–34 or direct administration into the brain tissue.35–36 Other approaches include 
the use of small molecules37 or ultrasound38–39 to alter the BBB to induce transient 
permeabilization of the BBB for nanoparticle transport. In the presented work, we 
envisioned a therapeutic that could take advantage of the BBB breach arising immediately 
after a penetrating injury and therefore could be administered in the field via an intravenous 
delivery route. We designed a targeted nanoparticle inspired by previous technology from 
our lab developed for cancer therapeutics which utilizes an intracellular trafficking peptide 
and a targeting peptide joined in tandem to self-assemble with siRNA into nanometer-sized 
structures. Re-engineering these nanoparticles to target neurons using a peptide ligand 
produced a system capable of mediating silencing in cultured cells that express the proposed 
target receptor. Intravenous application of these nanoparticles to an in vivo model of TBI 
transiently allows significant accumulation of nanoparticles if administered within a 6 hour 
window after the onset of injury. Observations in the literature suggest that this window is 
limited in the short-term by biological cascades that are produced by the injury such as 
intravascular coagulation and edema.31, 40 Furthermore, targeted nanoparticles were found to 
accumulate in neurons and were able to silence a candidate therapeutic gene in the region 
proximal to the injury. The RVG targeting ligand has been used previously to mediate 
transport of nanostructured materials across an intact BBB when decorated on electrostatic 
complexed nanoparticles21, 37 and exosomes22, 41. Another aspect of CNS delivery that is 
being explored is the delivery of targeted materials in disease states,42–43 where there may 
be altered BBB permeability. In this work we sought to characterize nanoparticle infiltration 
from the systemic vasculature when administered in the context of a TBI and furthermore, 
the ability to deliver nucleic acid cargo to targeted cell populations. We observed that there 
was significantly increased accumulation of nanoparticles in injured brain tissue compared 
to uninjured brains after intravenous delivery (Figure 5C), and in this context, a targeting 
ligand could achieve neuron-specific uptake. Future studies could explore long-term effects 
of therapeutic siRNA delivery in animals, such as looking at retention of neuronal 
populations and performance in behavioral tasks. Altering vascularization to coordinate 
nanoparticle accumulation has been harnessed in the context of tumor delivery in our lab and 
others,43–45 but this strategy has not been explored extensively in the context of the central 
nervous system, to date. Because our tandem peptide system is modular, siRNA against new

 targets can be rapidly synthesized and incorporated into nanoparticles to mitigate long-term 
effects of TBI.
Methods

Neuro-2a cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained 
in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
Nanoparticle complexation
The appropriate molar ratio of peptide:siRNA were formulated into nanoparticles by adding 
peptide solutions to equivolume of siRNA in water and mixing rapidly. TP-RVG 
(GGWTLNSAGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKILGGK(FAM)GGYTIWMPENPRPGTPCDIF

(GGWTLNSAGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKILGGK (FAM) 
GGMNLLRKIVKNRRDEDTQKSSPASAPLDDG) were synthesized by CPC Scientific 
with N-terminal myristic acid. siRNA were synthesized by Dharmacon (siCtrl =

Dynamic Light Scattering and Transmission Electron Microscopy
Nanoparticle solutions were incubated for 10 minutes after formulation. Hydrodynamic 
diameters were measured in a Malvern Zetasizer in water. Particles were deposited on a 200 
mesh Formvar/Carbon mesh (Ted Pella Inc.) and dried. Particles were imaged on a JEOL 
2100 FEG TEM.
Transfection
Neuro-2a cells were plated at 80K cells per well in 24-well plates coated with 10 ug/mL 
Poly-D-Lysine 24 hours before transfection. Nanocomplexes were added to cells in 
OptiMEM at a final concentration of 100 nM and four hours after addition, the media was 
replaced with full culture medium. Cells were collected for downstream RT-qPCR or 
western blot analysis 48 hours after transfection. For relative protein quantification of 
western blots, films were analyzed using the Gels tool in ImageJ by calculating the area 
under the curve of sample lanes converted to 2D plots. For transfections done in the presence 
of chloroquine, nanoparticles were co-incubated with 100 nM chloroquine for 4 hours before 
the media was changed.
Cell association studies
Cells were co-incubated with nanoparticles with the designated final peptide concentrations 
as described in the transfection. For 4 °C association studies, plates were incubated on ice 
for 30 minutes before the addition of nanoparticles. Cells were harvested using trypsin and 
analyzed for positive FAM fluorescence on the peptides. For microscopic examination,

 Dylight-647 siRNA was used to make complexes. After 4 hours of incubation, cells were 
fixed, counterstained with Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse Ti.
Injury model
All animal protocols were done in accordance with the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice 
were obtained from Taconic and were fitted into a stereotaxic device. A 5 mm diameter 
portion of the skull was removed and a 19G needle was used to make a series of shear 
injuries 3 mm deep and 1 mm apart. For biodistribution, 1 nmole of siRNA labeled with 
VivoTag750 on the 5’ end of the sense strand was used. At the times designated, mice were 
anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 10% formalin and the brains were imaged on 
a LI-COR Odyssey using the 800 channel. For knockdown studies, 2 nmoles of siRNA were 
administered via the tail-vein after the injury in a solution of 5% dextrose 5 minutes 
following the injury. Mice were sacrificed via CO2 asphyxiation 72 hours after 
administration of particles, and fresh tissue was collected and immediately frozen for protein 
analysis. The injured cortex was dissected along with the uninjured contralateral tissue for 
western blotting. Western blots were probed with antibodies against caspase 3 (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:500), cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), and 
alpha-tubulin (Invitrogen; 1:1000).
Staining of brain sections and quantification
Mice were perfused with fixative and brains were fixed for an additional 16 hours. Brains 
were equilibrated into 30% sucrose solution, embedded into Optimum Cutting Temperature 
compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen on dry ice, and cut into 10 µm sections. Sections were 
blocked in 10% goat serum, 2% BSA, 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS and probed with anti-NeuN 
(Millipore; 1:800), anti-GFAP (Abcam, 1:500), anti-Iba1 (Abcam, 1:500), and anti-
fluorescein (Thermo Fisher; 1:200) antibodies. Appropriate fluorophore-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunolabs) were used to visualize primary antibodies. 
Several fields of view were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and counting of NeuN, 
Iba1, and GFAP and peptide double positive populations was done in ImageJ.
