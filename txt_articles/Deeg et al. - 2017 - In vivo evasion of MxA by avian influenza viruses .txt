IntroductIon
Influenza A viruses pose a constant threat to humans because 
zoonotic viral transmissions can cause severe disease and give 
rise to devastating pandemics (Watanabe et al., 2014; Y
oon 
et al., 2014; Neumann and Kawaoka, 2015). Innate restric-
tion factors represent effective species barriers that need to 
be overcome by viruses to invade the human host (Cauldwell 
et al., 2014; Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014). In mice, innate immune 
control of influenza viruses is mediated by the IFN-regulated 
Mx1 gene (Haller et al., 2015). In man, the MX1 ortholog 
(encoding MxA protein) may play a similar role, as it pro-
vides broad resistance to influenza and other viruses in cell 
culture systems (Pavlovic et al., 1990; Haller et al., 2015). 
However, formal genetic proof that MxA helps protect hu-
mans from influenza virus–induced disease has so far been 
missing, as none of the known minor MX1 gene variants has 
to date been linked to enhanced influenza virus susceptibility 
(Ciancanelli et al., 2016).
MxA belongs to the dynamin superfamily of multi- 
domain large GTPases, and the MxA coding sequence is 
highly conserved in humans and other primates (Mitchell et 
al., 2013; Haller et al., 2015). Sequence comparison revealed 
that loop L4 is the most divergent part of the otherwise con-
served molecule, and mutational analysis showed that the L4 
domain acts as an autonomous antiviral module that determines 
the antiviral specificities in different species (Mitchell et al., 2012; 
Patzina et al., 2014). L4 binds to the influenza viral nucleo 
protein 
(Patzina et al., 2014), which leads to viral inhibition by a yet to 
be defined mechanism that requires GTP hydrolysis and oligo-
merization of MxA (Mitchell et al., 2013; Haller et al., 2015; 
Nigg and Pavlovic, 2015).
When major restriction factors are at work, viruses usu-
ally evolve to acquire mutations that help them to evade such 
host defense strategies (Simon et al., 2015). Recent studies sug-
gest that MxA is targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza A 
viruses which encapsidates the viral genome, a process that is 
pivotal to virus replication (Dittmann et al., 2008; Zimmer-
mann et al., 2011). Indeed, more recent studies indicate that 
influenza A viruses that successfully established stable lineages 
in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the nucleoprotein 
that allow partial MxA escape (Mänz et al., 2013; Götz et al., 
2016). It remained unclear, however, whether these cell culture 
experiments accurately reflect the in vivo situation.
A suitable animal model is required to answer this ques-
tion. Early attempts to constitutively express MxA cDNA 
in mice yielded disappointing results, as the transgene was 
not expressed well in the lungs (Pavlovic et al., 1995). We 
now generated a new mouse line that carries the complete 
Zoonotic transmission of influenza A viruses can give rise to devastating pandemics, but currently it is impossible to predict 
the pandemic potential of circulating avian influenza viruses. Here, we describe a new mouse model suitable for such risk as-
sessment, based on the observation that the innate restriction factor MxA represents an effective species barrier that must be 
overcome by zoonotic viruses. our mouse lacks functional endogenous Mx genes but instead carries the human MX1 locus as 
a transgene. Such transgenic mice were largely resistant to highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses, but were 
almost as susceptible to infection with influenza viruses of human origin as nontransgenic littermates. Influenza A viruses that 
successfully established stable lineages in humans have acquired adaptive mutations which allow partial MxA escape. Accord-
ingly, an engineered avian H7n7 influenza virus carrying a nucleoprotein with signature mutations typically found in human 
virus isolates was more virulent in transgenic mice than parental virus, demonstrating that a few amino acid changes in the 
viral target protein can mediate escape from MxA restriction in vivo. Similar mutations probably need to be acquired by 
emerging influenza A viruses before they can spread in the human population.
In vivo evasion of MxA by avian influenza viruses requires 
human signature in the viral nucleoprotein

human MX1 locus as a transgene and readily expresses MxA 
in response to IFN exposure in all major organs. Using this 
mouse model, we provide first in vivo evidence that a few 
surface-exposed amino acids on the nucleoprotein are in-
deed responsible for MxA evasion and play a key role in 
the adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to humans, as 
previously indicated by biochemical and cell culture exper-
iments (Mänz et al., 2013; Götz et al., 2016). These results 
indicate that MxA is a decisive factor that confers influ-
enza virus resistance in humans. They provide strong evi-
dence that newly emerging influenza viruses need to acquire 
the ability to evade MxA restriction to spread efficiently 
in the human population.

cells from transgenic mice carrying the human Mx locus 
exhibit IFn-dependent resistance to influenza A virus
T
o assess the role of MxA in vivo, we developed a transgenic 
mouse that carries a bacterial artificial chromosome that 
includes the entire human MX locus (Fig. 1 A). Repeated 
backcrossing of founder animals to C57BL/6 mice lacking 
 
functional endogenous Mx genes (Staeheli et al., 1988) yielded 
a new transgenic mouse line, designated hMx-tg. cDNA se-
quencing revealed that the MX2 gene is defective in hMx-tg 
mice as a result of an accidental deletion that includes exon 
4 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, MX1 is the only intact human gene in 
our hMx-tg mouse strain.

matic drawing showing the fragment of human chromosome 21 present in BAC clone Rp11-120c17 (top) and transgenic mice (bottom). Note that the 
MX2 gene is defective in our transgenic mice as a result of a deletion that includes coding exon 4. (B and C) MEFs prepared from transgenic (hMx-tg+/−) 
or nontransgenic (non-tg) littermates were treated with 10 ng per ml of IFN-α for 18 h (+) or were left untreated (–) before analysis of the cellular MxA 
content by RT-qPCR (B) or Western blot (C). IFN-treated human A549 cells served as positive control. ISG15 served as IFN treatment control in MEFs. 
Western blots were simultaneously probed with an antibody recognizing β-tubulin to demonstrate similar loading of the gel. RT-qPCR ΔCT values were 
calculated relative to actin gene expression from technical triplicates; SEM is shown. (D) MEFs from hMx-tg+/− mice were treated with 10 ng per ml of 
IFN-α for 18 h before visualization of MxA expression (red) by indirect immunofluorescence. Untreated cells served as controls. Nuclei were stained with 
DAPI (blue). Bars, 10 µm. (E) MEFs from hMx-tg+/− and non-tg littermates were treated for 18 h with plain medium (0) or medium containing 1 or 10 ng per 
ml of IFN-α before infection (MOI, 0.01) with H7N7 avian influenza A virus strain FPV-B. Culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h after infection and 
virus titers were determined. Cells from mouse embryos carrying one functional allele of the endogenous Mx1 gene (Mx1+/−) were used as controls. Mean 
values with standard error of means of three independent experiments are shown. (F and G) MEFs from hMx-tg+/− and non-tg littermates were treated for 
18 h with plain medium (0) or medium containing 1 or 10 ng per ml of IFN-α before infection (MOI = 0.1) with THOV (F) or VSV (G). Culture supernatants 
were harvested at 24 h (VSV) or 72 h (THOV) after infection and virus titers were determined. Mx1+/− MEFs were used as controls. Mean values with SEM 
of three independent experiments are shown.

Cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared 
from hMx-tg mice expressed the transgene when stimulated 
with IFN-α, but not under standard culture conditions, and 
maintained normal regulation of other IFN-stimulated genes 
such as ISG15 (Fig. 1 B). MxA protein levels in IFN-treated 
transgenic MEFs were slightly lower than in IFN-treated 
human A549 cells (Fig. 1 C). MxA accumulated in the cyto-
plasm of IFN-treated hMx-tg MEFs (Fig. 1 D) as expected 
from earlier studies of human cells (Staeheli and Haller, 1985). 
When pretreated with IFN-α and challenged with a mouse-
adapted H7N7 influenza A virus (Israël, 1979), MEFs from 
hMx-tg mice but not from nontransgenic littermates exhib-
ited a high degree of resistance that was comparable to cells 
from mice carrying one functional copy of the endogenous 
Mx1 resistance gene (Fig. 1 E). Furthermore, IFN-treated 
MEFs from hMx-tg but not from nontransgenic mice were 
highly resistant to Thogoto virus (THOV) known to be ex-
tremely sensitive to MxA (Kochs and Haller, 1999; Fig. 1 F). 
In contrast, IFN-induced resistance to vesicular stomatitis 
virus (VSV) was independent of either endogenous Mx1 or 
transgenically expressed MxA (Fig. 1 G), confirming other 
studies that additional IFN-induced restriction factors con-
tribute to inhibition of 
VSV (Sadler and Williams, 2008).
hMx-tg mice are highly resistant to infection with avian 
influenza A viruses and tHoV
The transgene was expressed in all organs tested when the 
animals were treated with IFN-α by either the i.n. or the i.p. 
route (Fig. 2). Detectable levels of MxA were also induced by 
IFN-λ in lungs and small intestine, whereas transgene expres-
sion was not detected in organs of untreated mice (Fig. 2 A). 
We additionally checked MxA expression in the upper re-
spiratory tract (trachea and snout) for relevance to influenza 
virus infection. As expected, MxA was induced upon IFN-α 
treatment in the upper respiratory tract (Fig. 2 B). These re-
sults demonstrated that our transgenic mice carry a copy of 
the human MX1 gene that is functional and expressed in re-
sponse to type I and type III IFN, similar to the authentic 
gene in human tissue (Holzinger et al., 2007).
T
o assess influenza virus susceptibility, transgenic mice 
were challenged with 10–30 median lethal doses 50 (LD50) of 
highly pathogenic H5 and H7 influenza A viruses of avian or-
igin. All transgenic mice survived such infections, whereas the 
nontransgenic littermates developed severe disease and most 
of them had to be sacrificed for animal welfare reasons before 
day 9 after infection (Fig. 3, A–D). Resistance of hMx-tg mice 
to these avian viruses was remarkably robust: all transgenic

animals exhibited only very mild body weight losses and sur-
vived challenge infections with >104 LD50 (Table 1) of the 
highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus strains A/KAN-1 
(Fig. 3 A) and A/R65 (Fig. 3 B). Resistance of hMx-tg mice 
toward the H7N9 strain A/SH/1 (Fig. 3 C) and the H7N7 
strain A/SC35M (Fig. 3 D) was similarly pronounced, and the 
LD50 values of these viruses in hMx-tg mice were ∼30-fold 
higher than in nontransgenic controls (Table 1). Enhanced 
survival of transgenic mice infected with SH/1 and SC35M 
correlated with strongly reduced virus titers in the lungs com-
pared with nontransgenic controls (Fig. 3, E and F). Earlier 
work indicated that avian H7N9 influenza A viruses, which 
recently emerged in China, can partially evade restriction by 
MxA in cell culture (Riegger et al., 2015). In contrast, our 
infection studies with transgenic mice clearly demonstrated 
that MxA is able to control the A/SH1 human H7N9 isolate 
very efficiently in the context of the whole organism. Thus, 
the MxA restriction factor is protective against a broad range 
of avian influenza viruses and represents a veritable barrier 
that limits zoonotic virus transmissions.
The Mx1 protein of mice confers a high degree of resis-
tance to infection by members of the Thogotoviridae family, 
such as THOV and Dhori virus (DHOV), whereas human 
MxA selectively inhibits THOV (Frese et al., 1995; Haller et 
al., 1995). Our hMxA-tg mice exhibited robust resistance to 
challenges with 
THOV (Fig. 4 A), but were highly susceptible

each), (B) R65 (2 × 102 pfu; seven animals each), (C) SH/1 (104 pfu; five hMx-tg+/− and eleven non-tg), or (D) SC35M (5 × 103 pfu; five hMx-tg+/− and four 
non-tg). Weight loss was monitored daily; animals were sacrificed and scored dead when weight loss reached 25% of the initial weight on the day of 
infection. (E and F) Other groups of transgenic and nontransgenic mice were challenged through the i.n. route with (E) SH/1 (104 pfu; five animals each)

to DHOV (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that the antiviral specific-
ity of MxA is maintained in our transgenic mice. These find-
ings are in agreement with earlier findings from studies with a 
transgenic mouse line that constitutively expressed low levels 
of MxA and confirmed that these two related viruses dif-
fer drastically with regard to MxA sensitivity (Thimme et al., 
1995). Collectively, these results demonstrated that our trans-
genic mice behaved as predicted from previous studies with 
cultured human cells (Haller et al., 2015), and that they repro-
duced the innate anti-influenza immune response of humans.
hMx-tg mice exhibit only moderate resistance to influenza 
A viruses of human origin
When challenged with ∼10 LD50 of mouse-adapted A/WSN 
(H1N1), A/PR8 (H1N1), or A/HK68 (H3N2), most of the 
transgenic mice developed severe disease symptoms with 
only slightly delayed kinetics compared with nontransgenic 
littermates (Fig. 5 A). These challenge conditions were not 
particularly stringent as control mice carrying a functional 
endogenous Mx1 gene survived such virus doses (Table 1) 
without developing severe disease symptoms. Nevertheless, 
the transgene conferred some protection which became 
obvious only when viral titers in the lungs were measured 
(Fig. 5 C) or when the challenge virus dose was reduced 
to ∼3 LD50 (Fig. 5 B). Under such nonstringent conditions, 
most of the transgenic mice lost <25% of their initial body 
weight and survived the infection, whereas >50% of non-
transgenic littermates had to be sacrificed.
A similar picture emerged when influenza virus strains 
with no passage history in mice, such as A/Udorn/72 and 
A/HH/2009, were used for challenge experiments. These 
nonadapted viruses, which do not induce disease in mice 
replicated to significantly higher titer in the lungs of non-
transgenic mice compared with transgenic animals, but the 
differences were moderate, as in the case of mouse-adapted 
WSN (Fig. 5 C), indicating that mouse adaptation does not 
alter the MxA resistance phenotype of human influenza virus 
isolates. It should be noted that influenza viruses of both avian 
and human origin were all restricted very well in mice that 
express endogenous Mx1 genes (Table 1), indicating that 
human influenza viruses evolved to specifically evade re-
striction by human MxA but not mouse Mx1. This finding 
is most likely caused by the fact that the mouse does not 
serve as a natural host for influenza viruses, and mouse Mx1 
does therefore not exert any selective pressure on influenza 
virus evolution. In contrast, human MX1 and influenza virus 
genes are apparently genes in conflict in an evolutionary arms 
race (Mitchell et al., 2013). Accordingly, our in vivo findings 
clearly demonstrate that influenza A viruses of human origin 
are rather poorly restricted by MxA, confirming and extend-
ing previous results from experiments with human cell cul-
ture systems (Dittmann et al., 2008). Collectively, the present 
animal experiments provide first solid in vivo evidence that 
MxA is indeed a major influenza restriction factor in humans.
Avian influenza virus with adaptive mutations in the 
nucleoprotein gains virulence in hMx-tg mice
Partial escape of human influenza A viruses from restriction 
by MxA in a cell culture system was recently linked to three 
signature mutations in the viral nucleoprotein (Mänz et al., 
2013). The vast majority of avian influenza viruses possess 
nucleoproteins with arginine at position 100, leucine at po-
sition 283, and phenylalanine at position 313, whereas most 
influenza A viruses of human origin possess nucleoproteins 
with isoleucine or valine at position 100, proline at position 
283, and tyrosine or valine at position 313. Avian influenza 
A viruses with engineered nucleoproteins carrying all three 
human signature mutations are genetically instable (Mänz et 
al., 2013), suggesting that MxA escape has a substantial fitness 
cost. Due to this technical difficulty, conclusive experimen-
tal proof that these adaptive mutations play a decisive role in 
MxA evasion during viral infections was not available.
Recently, a variant of the avian H7N7 influenza A virus 
strain SC35M was described that carries all three human

with (A) 103 pfu of THOV (four animals each) or (B) 102 pfu of DHOV (five hMx-tg+/− and four non-tg). Survival was monitored for 14 d. Mice carrying one 
functional allele of the endogenous Mx1 gene (Mx1+/−, five animals) served as positive control for the DHOV challenge experiment. Animals were sacrificed 
and scored dead when weight loss reached the 25% limit.

signature mutations (100V
, 283P and 313Y) along with one 
additional glycine to aspartic acid mutation at position 16 
in the nucleoprotein (Götz et al., 2016). This SC35M vari-
ant carrying four mutations in the nucleoprotein, designated 
SC35M-4x, was genetically stable and showed no detectable 
growth retardation in MDCK cells. Importantly, SC35M-4x 
replicated to higher titers than parental SC35M in human 
A549 cells constitutively expressing MxA (Götz et al., 2016),

indicating that SC35M-4x may represent a suitable tool for 
testing the hypothesis that viruses carrying nucleoproteins 
with a human signature are far more virulent in the face of a 
functional MxA-driven innate immune response than viruses 
carrying nucleoproteins with avian signature.
In hMx-tg mice, SC35M-4x induced slightly more 
weight loss and replicated to significantly higher titers in the 
lungs of such animals than parental SC35M (Fig. 6 A). 
The dif-
ference in viral lung titers was most pronounced on day 5 after 
infection, indicating that SC35M-4x continued to replicate 
even when the transgene is expected to be expressed well in 
the infected lungs as a result of virus-induced IFN synthesis. 
T
o 
verify this exceptional property of SC35M-4x more directly 
and to exclude the possibility that SC35M-4x had simply 
outpaced the innate immune response, we preactivated MxA 
transgene expression by treating the animals with IFN-α one 
day before virus challenge. Under such experimental condi-
tions, which are expected to result in high levels of MxA in the 
lung tissue within 18 h (Fig. 2), high doses of parental SC35M 
no longer caused detectable weight loss in our transgenic mice 
(Figs. 6, B and C). In contrast, SC35M-4x still induced pro-
nounced weight loss (Fig. 6 B), and six of seven IFN-treated 
transgenic animals that received 106 pfu of SC35M-4x had to 
be sacrificed (Fig. 6 C). Titers of SC35M-4x in the lungs of 
IFN-treated transgenic mice were ∼10-fold higher than paren-
tal SC35M on day 3 after infection (Fig. 6 B). Of note, in IFN-
treated mice lacking the MxA transgene, lung titers of SC35M 
and SC35M-4x did not differ significantly at day 3 after in-
fection (Fig. 6 D), demonstrating that the IFN-mediated re-
sistance in transgenic mice is strongly dependent on MxA and 
that enhanced virulence of SC35M-4x is caused bysuccessful 
evasion of MxA-mediated growth restriction by this virus.
Collectively, our new transgenic mouse shows fine-
tuned expression of the human influenza virus restriction 
factor MxA in all major organs, including the upper and the 
lower respiratory tract. These mice thus represent the first 
small animal model that accurately mimics one important as-
pect of the innate immune response of humans toward influ-
enza virus. Unlike all other currently available mouse models, 
our MxA-transgenic mouse can readily distinguish between 
MxA-sensitive influenza virus strains and virus strains which 
can evade MxA restriction and, consequently, possess a high 
pandemic potential in humans. Our MxA-transgenic mice 
will facilitate future basic research aimed at understanding the 
molecular details of influenza virus restriction by the innate 
immune system. For example, our current work revealed that 
H5N1 viruses are inhibited far more strongly by MxA than 
the H7 avian influenza viruses. We suspect that the high MxA 
susceptibility of H5 viruses is multifactorial, but further work 
is required to understand the molecular basis of this phenome-
non. Our MxA-transgenic mouse might also be used to rapidly 
assess the pathogenic potential and overall fitness of emerging 
influenza A viruses in humans. Such functional analysis could 
complement current risk assessment strategies of emerging in-
fluenza viruses, including viral genome sequencing and screen-
ing for alterations in known viral virulence genes. Moreover, 
our transgenic mice might be useful in assessing the in vivo 
relevance of polymorphic MxA mutations that occur naturally 
in the human population. Such mutations could easily be in-
troduced into the transgene of our mouse by CRI 
SPR/Cas9 
technology. Further, our transgenic mice might be used to an-
alyze the in vivo importance of MxA cofactors.

Founder animals harboring the transgene were repeatedly 
backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous males and fe-
males from backcrosses 5–12 (designated hMx-tg) were used 
for the experiments described in this study. Nontransgenic 
littermates served as controls.
Sequencing the MX gene transcripts
MEFs of hMx-tg and nontransgenic littermates were stimu-
lated with human chimeric IFN-αB/D (10 ng/ml; Horisberger 
and de Staritzky, 1987) for 18 h. RNA was isolated using the 
Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol and reverse transcribed into cDNA 
with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (QIA

Viruses
For infection of mice, the following influenza A virus strains 
were used: A/Swan/Germany/R65/2006 (H5N1) designated 
 
R65, 
A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (H5N1) designated KAN-1, 
 
A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) designated SH/1, A/Seal/ 
Massachusetts/1/1980 (H7N7) designated SC35M, A/PR/ 
8/1934 (H1N1) designated PR8, A/WSN/1933 (H1N1)

designated WSN, A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) designated 
HK68, A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) designated Udorn, and A/
HH/05/2009 (H1N1) designated HH. R65 and SH/1 are 
avian isolates with no passage history in mammals. The avian 
influenza virus strain KAN-1 was isolated from a diseased boy 
and has since been passaged in MDCK cells. SC35M rep-
resents a mouse-adapted variant of an avian H7N7 virus that 
was originally isolated from a diseased seal. PR8, WSN, and 
HK68 are mouse-adapted viruses of human origin, whereas 
the human virus isolates Udorn and HH have no passage his-
tory in mice. SC35M-4x differs from parental SC35M by four 
amino acid substitutions in the nucleoprotein, namely G16D, 
R100V
, L293P
, and F313Y (Götz et al., 2016). T
wo differ-
ent THOVs were used for infection studies in mice: Thogoto

hMx-tg+/− mice were infected with 4 × 103 
pfu of either parental SC35M-wt or SC35M-4x 
(six and five animals, respectively). Body 
weight changes with SEM and lung titers on 
days 3 and 5 after infection are shown. (B

SC35M-4x). Kinetics of body weight changes, 
survival, and lung titers at day 3 (six animals 
SC35M-wt and five animals SC35M-4x) after 
infection are depicted. Weight loss was mon-
itored daily and SEM depicted; animals were 
sacrificed and scored dead when body weight 
loss reached the 25% limit. (D) Groups (n = 5) 
of nontransgenic mice were infected with 103 
pfu either parental SC35M-wt or SC35M-4x, 
and viral lung titers were determined on days 3 
and 5 after infection. *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.0001.

virus strain SiAr126 lacking a functional ML gene (designated 
THOV; Albanese et al., 1972) and DHOV strain India1313/61 
(designated DHOV; Anderson and Casals, 1973). The L cell–
adapted variant of A/Fowl plague virus/Dobson (H7N7), 
designated FPV-B (Israël, 1979), and vesicular stomatitis virus 
serotype New Jersey (VSV) were used for infection of MEFs.
cells
T
o generate MEFs, 14 d post coitum embryos of hMx-tg and 
nontransgenic littermates were mechanically and enzymatically 
homogenized before released cells were collected by centrifu-
gation and resuspended in cell culture medium. Madin-Darby 
canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK), human lung epithelial 
cells (A549), and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) were 
originally obtained from the ATCC. All cells were cultivated 
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 526 
mg/liter glutamine, 20,000 U/liter penicillin and 40 mg/liter 
streptomycin at 37°C, 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
MEFs were stimulated with human chimeric IFN-αB/D 
(Horisberger and de Staritzky, 1987; 10 ng per ml for 18 h) or 
were mock treated before fixing with 3% formaldehyde. Cells 
were permeabilized for 10 min using PBS containing 5% nor-
mal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 before they were 
incubated with a rabbit anti-Mx serum (Meier et al., 1990) 
in PBS containing 3% normal donkey serum at 4°C over-
night. Goat α-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-
tories) served as a secondary antibody. Slides were mounted in 
 
DAPI-containing IS Mounting Medium (Dianova). Digital 
images were taken with an ApoT
ome fluorescence micro-
scope (ZEI 
SS) using AxioVision software.
Virus infection of cell cultures
MEFs were seeded, stimulated the next day with different doses 
of human chimeric IFN-αB/D (Horisberger and de Staritzky, 
1987) for 18 h, and subsequently infected with a MOI of 0.1 
of VSV or THOV for 24 and 72 h, respectively. Infections 
with the influenza A virus strain FPV-B were performed at a 
MOI of 0.01, and supernatants were harvested at 24 h after 
infection. 
Viral titers were determined by plaque assay.
IFn treatment of mice
Human chimeric IFN-αB/D (Horisberger and de Staritzky, 
1987) or mouse IFN-λ (IL-28A; PeproT
ech) were applied i.n. 
in a volume of 40 µl to ketamin/xylazine-anesthetized ani-
mals. 
Where indicated, IFN was administered in 100 µl into the 
peritoneal cavity or in 120 µl s.c. on the back of the animals.
rt-qPcr
Reverse transcription was performed using the Revert Aid 
First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas) as recom-
mended by the manufacturer. QuantiTect SYBR Green 
PCR kit and commercially available primer pairs (QIA 
GEN) 
were used for comparative analysis. ΔCT values were used 
to characterize expression of target genes compared with 
housekeeping genes.
Western blot
Protein samples from homogenized cells or tissues were in-
cubated at 95°C in Lämmli buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE 
gels. Proteins were blotted on a methanol-activated PVDF 
membrane (PerfectBlue Semi-Dry electro blotter; PEQ 
LAB). 
Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 1% milk powder 
before incubation with primary antibodies (mouse anti-MxA; 
Flohr et al., 1999) and mouse anti–tubulin-β (Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 1 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
coupled secondary antibody (goat anti–mouse IgG; Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. Bound antibodies 
were visualized using Super Signal West Pico Chemilumines-
cent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Mouse infection experiments
All mice used in the study were bred locally in our facility and 
handled in accordance with guidelines of the Federation for 
Laboratory Animal Science Associations and the national ani-
mal welfare body. Animal experiments were performed in com-
pliance with the German animal protection law and approved 
by the local animal welfare committee (Regierungspräsidium 
Freiburg; permit G-12/46). 
Virus stocks were diluted in PBS. In-
fection of ketamin/xylazine-anesthetized animals with influenza 
viruses was performed i.n. with 40 µl inoculum. For infection 
with THOVs, 100 µl of the virus dilutions were administered 
into the peritoneal cavity. Mice were monitored daily. If severe 
illness or weight loss of >25% occurred, mice were sacrificed by 
cervical dislocation. If required, organs were flash frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing.
Plaque assay
Serial dilutions of cell culture supernatants or homogenized 
organ samples were placed on MDCK cells for 1 h at room 
temperature. After inoculum removal, cells were incubated 
with medium containing 1.5% Avicel for three days at 37°C. 
Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and plaques were 
stained using crystal violet.
ld50 determination
The 50% median lethal dose (LD50) values were calculated as 
described previously (Riegger et al., 2015) by using three to 
five animals for each virus dilution.
Statistical analysis
Virus titration data of cell culture supernatants are from at 
least three independent experiments with three technical rep-
licates. Geometric mean values of virus titers in lungs of at 
least four individual mice were determined. Where indicated, 
two tailed Student’s t test was used to determine if a difference 
in virus titers between two groups was significant. Values of 
 
P < 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. 
Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism v6.2.
