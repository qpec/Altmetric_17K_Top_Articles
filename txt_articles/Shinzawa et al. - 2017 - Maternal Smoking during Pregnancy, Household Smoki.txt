Abstract
Background and objectives Smoking is a well known risk factor of proteinuria in adults; however, clinical studies
in children are limited. The purpose of this study is to clarify the associations of maternal smoking during
pregnancy and household smoking after the child’s birth with the risk of proteinuria at age 3 years old.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We performed a population–based retrospective cohort study on
44,595 children using data on prenatal health checkups, home visit neonatal health checkups, and health checkups at 4, 9,
and 18 months and 3 years of age in Kobe City, Japan. Maternal smoking status (nonsmoker, past smoker, or current
smoker) was collected with standardized questionnaires. The outcome of interest was the presence of proteinuria at
3 years of age defined as urinary protein $1+. To evaluate the association between child proteinuria and smoking status,
we performed multivariate logistic regression model analyses adjusted for confounding factors.
Results The prevalence rates of children in the maternal smoking groups (none, past, and current) were 78.9%,
4.4%, and 16.7%, respectively. The frequencies of child proteinuria defined as $1+ urinary protein were 1.7% in
the current smoking group, 1.6% in the past smoking group, and 1.3% in the nonsmoking group. Maternal
smoking during pregnancy was associated with child proteinuria (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.00
to 1.52; P=0.05) in the multiple logistic regression model, although nonmaternal family smoking during preg-
nancy was not significantly associated with child proteinuria (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to
1.19; P=0.77). We also found a similar association with household smoking after the child’s birth (odds ratio, 1.23;
95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.54; P=0.06), although this observation was not significant.
Conclusions Maternal smoking during pregnancy was one of the risk factors of childhood proteinuria. We also found a
similar association with household smoking after the child’s birth, although this observation was not significant.

Introduction
Household smoking remains a continuing public health
issue, and 40% of children in the world are estimated to
be exposed to household smoking. Among neonates
and children, exposure to household smoking is asso-
ciated with childhood asthma, chronic lung disease, can-
cer, and dental caries (1–3). As to the fetus, maternal
smoking during pregnancy or maternal exposure to
household smoking is associated with neonatal as-
phyxia (4), preterm birth, and low birth weight (5,6).
These exposures also probably affect the child’s health
in later life as childhood behavioral difficulties (7) and
cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus in adult life
(8–10). The prevalence of women smokers is higher
among those of childbearing age than those at other
life stages (11). The prevalence of maternal smoking
during the third trimester of pregnancy in the United
States was approximately 10% in 2010 (12).
Smoking is also associated with proteinuria and CKD
in healthy adults and patients with IgA nephropathy
or lupus nephritis (13–17). In addition to effects on renal
function, smoking indirectly affects endothelial func-
tion and BP, and such indirect effects could cause pro-
teinuria and CKD among children. However, clinical
studies in children are limited to a recent report on
an association of secondhand smoke exposure with
nephrotic-range proteinuria among children with
CKD (18). The effects of household smoking on the
developing kidney have not been studied. In the pro-
cess of nephrogenesis, kidneys mainly develop from 9
to 36 weeks of gestation, and no new nephrons are
formed after birth (19,20). Because the number of
nephrons has been determined by birth, maternal
smoking during pregnancy, one of the most influen-
tial factors among intrauterine conditions, may be a
risk factor for proteinuria in children, although little
has been reported on the effects of maternal smoking
on nephrogenesis.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify the
associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy

 and household smoking after the child’s birth with the risk
of proteinuria at age 3 years old in a population–based
retrospective cohort study in Japan, where urinary tests
at age 3 years old are mandatory according to the Maternal
and Child Health Act.
Materials and Methods
Design and Settings
The Kobe Offspring Study was designed as a population–
based retrospective cohort study using records from mu-
nicipal health checkups in Kobe City, Japan (3). In Japan,
prenatal and neonatal health checkups, prenatal care for
women with the potential for childbearing, home visit neo-
natal health checkups for 1- to 3-month-old infants by a nurse
or midwife, and home visit health checkups for 18-month-old
and 3-year-old children are mandatory according to the Ma-
ternal and Child Health Act (21,22). The authors had access
to deidentified data on health checkups from March 31, 2004
to April 1, 2014 after approval by the Planning and Coordi-
nation Bureau of Kobe. The authors managed the data on the
basis of the Act of Personal Information Protection in Kobe
City and take responsibility for their integrity. Because the data
had been completely deidentified before being provided to
us, this study was exempt from obtaining individual in-
formed consent on the basis of the Ethical Guidelines for
Epidemiologic Research by the Ministry of Health, Labor
and Welfare. This study protocol was approved by the
ethics committees of Kyoto University Graduate School
and Faculty of Medicine (E2068).
Kobe City is the sixth largest city in Japan, with a
population of about 1.5 million, and it is the capital city of
Hyogo Prefecture on the southern side of the main island of
Japan. According to the 2013 Vital Statistics, there were 90,216
births in Kobe between 2004 and 2010. All women of
childbearing age and children ages 0–3 years old residing
in Kobe City participated in the health checkup program.
The selection criteria for this study were children who were
born between April of 2004 and March of 2011 for whom
information on maternal and household smoking status and
dipstick test results for urinary protein were available.
Measurements
Baseline characteristics at birth included information gath-
ered during the home visit neonatal health checkup, including
sex, gestational week, birth weight and height, and the presence
of an abnormality during pregnancy or at delivery. Maternal
information was taken from the pregnancy notification form
used to obtain prenatal care and included maternal age,
maternal alcohol intake, trouble during pregnancy, and mater-
nal and nonmaternal family smoking status during pregnancy.
Maternal smoking status and nonmaternal family smoking
status (i.e., maternal exposure to household smoking during
pregnancy) were identified with the standardized question-
naire in the pregnancy notification form. Smoking status of
mothers, fathers, and other family members after the child’s
birth was also assessed by standardized questionnaires pro-
vided at every health checkup for children 4, 9, and 18
months and 3 years of age. In this study, maternal smoking
status during pregnancy was classified into three categories:
none, past, and current maternal smoking during pregnancy,
and nonmaternal family smoking status during pregnancy
and household smoking status after the child’s birth were
divided into two categories: yes or no. To assess the effect
of exposure to household smoking after birth on childhood
proteinuria, we defined household smoking after birth of the
child as at least one yes response to smoking by parents and
family members at a health checkup during the period when
the infant was 4–18 months of age. Missing data on smoking
status after the child’s birth were imputed by carrying the last
observation forward, and 14 (0.03%) children had completely
missing data from the age of 4–18 months old. Missing data
other than smoking status (i.e., history of preeclampsia, ma-
ternal alcohol intake, and history of neonatal asphyxia) were
assumed to be the absence of the disease or exposure. We
used Birth Size Standards by Gestational Age for Japanese in
2010 as the standards of body size (23,24). Extreme outliers
for birth weight and height were those participants with ex-
tremely small (less than one half of the third percentile) or
large (more than 1.5 times the 97th percentile) birth weight
and height for gestational age (3).
The 3-year health checkup included tests for urinary protein
(2, 6, 1+, 2+, or 3+), and urinary blood (2, 6, 1+, 2+, or 3+).
The outcome in this study was the presence of proteinuria at
3 years old defined as urinary protein of 1+, 2+, or 3+.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were described as mean6SD or me-
dian (interquartile range), and categorical variables were de-
scribed as frequency and proportion. Differences between
children who were followed for 3 years and had result of
urinary protein (n=44,595) and children who were not fol-
lowed for 3 years or were followed for 3 years without result
of urinary protein (n=19,770) were evaluated by the Wilcoxon
rank sum test for continuous variables and the chi-squared
test for categorical variables. After excluding the children
(n=19,811) who were not followed for 3 years (n=17,167) or
were followed for 3 years without result of urinary protein
(n=2644), we compared baseline characteristics using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test for trends for continuous variables
and the Cochran–Armitage trend test for categorical variables.
To evaluate the associations of maternal and nonmaternal
family smoking during pregnancy and household smoking
after the child’s birth with the risk of childhood proteinuria,
we performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models and reported odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence in-
terval (95% CIs), and P values by Wald tests. Multivariate
logistic models were adjusted for sex, gestational week, birth
weight, neonatal asphyxia, maternal age, history of pre-
eclampsia, and maternal alcohol intake as confounders. To
avoid a potential multicollinearity problem, we initially ex-
amined the main effects of maternal and nonmaternal family
smoking during pregnancy and household smoking after the
child’s birth separately (multivariate models 1 and 2 in Table
5) and then, explored interactions between them in a logistic
regression model (multivariate model 3 in Table 5).
All P values are two tailed, and statistical significance
was set at P,0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted
using STATA, version 12.1 (STATA Corp., College Station,
TX; http://www.stata.com) and JMP 10.0.0 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC; http://www.jmp.com).
Results
The database of the health checkup program in Kobe
City consisted of records on 145,318 participants in that
254
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 program between 2004 and 2014. We initially identified
72,265 children who were born in Kobe City between April
of 2004 and March of 2011 for whom their mother’s preg-
nancy notification forms were available. Records of the
home visit neonatal health checkup that included infor-
mation on maternal and nonmaternal family smoking
status were available for 68,385 (94.6%) of the children.
Subsequently, 47,239 (65.4%) children further underwent
the 3-year-old health checkup. After excluding children
without results of the urinary protein dipstick test (2644;
3.7%), 44,595 (61.7%) children were included in this study
(Figure 1).

Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Proteinuria, Shinzawa et al.
255
 The baseline characteristics of children who were fol-
lowed for 3 years with result of urinary protein (n=44,595)
and children who were not followed for 3 years or were
followed for 3 years without result of urinary protein
(n=19,811) are listed in Table 1. Statistically significant differ-
ences were observed in maternal smoking status during
pregnancy, nonmaternal family smoking status during preg-
nancy, and household smoking status after the child’s birth.
Children who were followed for 3 years with result of uri-
nary protein had higher prevalence of nonmaternal family
smoking during pregnancy (46.5% versus 41.3%; P,0.001)
and higher prevalence of household smoking status after
the child’s birth (61.2% versus 55.4%; P,0.001). However,
the difference in maternal smoking status during pregnancy
did not reach a clinically meaningful level.
After excluding the children (n=19,811) who were not
followed for 3 years (n=17,167) or were followed for 3
years without result of urinary protein (n=2644), there
were 35,178 (78.9%), 1957 (4.4%), and 7460 (16.7%) chil-
dren in the nonsmoking, past smoking, and current smok-
ing groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics of all
participants are provided in Table 2. Mothers in the cur-
rent smoking group were 2 years younger (Ptrend,0.001)
and had higher prevalence of nonmaternal family smoking
during pregnancy (Ptrend,0.001). Moreover, mothers in
current smoking group were more likely to have a history
of preeclampsia (Ptrend,0.001) and maternal alcohol intake
(Ptrend,0.001), and children in the current smoking group
had higher prevalence of neonatal asphyxia (Ptrend,0.001).
Because of the large sample size, gestational week was
statistically significant, but the size of the difference was
not clinically relevant.
The prevalence of household smoking in the presence of
infants 4, 9, and 18 months old was significantly higher in
the current smoking group (Ptrend,0.001) (Table 3). Similar
trends were found in the questionnaires obtained for
3-year-old children: 4697 (62.9%) in the current smoking
group, 1672 (85.5%) in the past smoking group, and 10,802
(30.7%) in the nonsmoking group.
The frequencies of childhood proteinuria defined as $1+
urinary protein by a dipstick test were 1.7% (n=125) in the
current smoking group, 1.6% (n=31) in the past smoking
group, and 1.3% (n=452) in the nonsmoking group (Table
4). Most of the childhood proteinuria was 1+ by the dip-
stick test; these values were found in 1.3% (n=96) of the
current smoking group, 1.1% (n=21) of the past smoking
group, and 0.9% (n=331) of the nonsmoking group. There
was a significant trend of childhood proteinuria with ma-
ternal smoking during pregnancy (Ptrend,0.001).
In univariate logistic regression models, current maternal
smoking during pregnancy (versus nonsmoking; OR, 1.31;
95% CI, 1.07 to 1.60; P,0.01) and birth weight (per 500 g;
OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97; P,0.01) were significantly
associated with childhood proteinuria at 3 years (Table 5).
Even after adjusting for maternal age, history of pre-
eclampsia, maternal alcohol intake, gestational week, birth
weight, and neonatal asphyxia, current maternal smoking
during pregnancy was still one of the significant predictors
of childhood proteinuria (versus nonsmoking; OR, 1.26;
95% CI, 1.03 to 1.56; P=0.03) as well as birth weight (per
500 g; OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99; P=0.04) (Table 5, mul-
tivariate model 1). Past smoking during pregnancy (versus
nonsmoking; OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.67; P=0.47) and
nonmaternal family smoking during pregnancy (OR, 1.09;

 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.30; P=0.30) were not significantly associ-
ated with childhood proteinuria. There were no significant
interactions between maternal smoking status during preg-
nancy and covariates.
Table 4 also shows that the frequency of childhood pro-
teinuria at 3 years was significantly higher in children with
household smoking after the child’s birth: 1.5% (n=406) with
household smoking after the child’s birth and 1.2% (n=202)
without household smoking after the child’s birth (P,0.01).
There was a significant trend across maternal smoking status
among children without household smoking after the child’s
birth (Ptrend=0.02): 1.9% in the current smoking group, 1.7%
in the past smoking group, and 1.1% in the nonsmoking
group (Table 4). In contrast, the association with maternal
smoking during pregnancy was not monotonic among chil-
dren exposed to household smoking after the child’s birth:
1.6% in the current smoking group, 1.6% in the past smoking
group, and 1.4% in the nonsmoking group. Household smok-
ing after the child’s birth was significantly associated with
childhood proteinuria at 3 years in the univariate model (OR,
1.28; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.51; P,0.01) and multivariate model 2
(OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.50; P=0.001).
To evaluate the associations with maternal and non-
maternal family smoking during pregnancy and household
smoking after the child’s birth, we performed a multivar-
iate logistic regression model. After adjustment for all con-
founders, maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR, 1.24;
95% CI, 1.00 to 1.52; P=0.05) and birth weight (per 500 g;
OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99; P=0.04) were associated
with childhood proteinuria, although statistical signifi-
cance for household smoking after the child’s birth was
not observed (Table 5, multivariate model 3).
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the association
between proteinuria at the age of 3 years old and maternal
smoking during pregnancy. In this cohort of 44,595 chil-
dren, the prevalence rates of maternal smoking during
pregnancy and household smoking after the child’s birth
were .20% and 60%, respectively. Nonmaternal family
smoking during pregnancy was not statistically signifi-
cantly associated with childhood proteinuria (OR, 0.97;
95% CI, 0.79 to 1.19; P=0.77), but maternal smoking during
pregnancy was associated with childhood proteinuria (OR,
1.24; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.54; P=0.05). We also found a similar
association with household smoking after the child’s birth
(OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.54; P=0.06), although this ob-
servation was not significant.

Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Childhood Proteinuria, Shinzawa et al.
257
 Along with the prevalence of maternal smoking during
pregnancy, this study clarified that maternal cigarette
smoking during pregnancy was a significant risk factor
for childhood proteinuria at the age of 3 years old. Few
studies of childhood proteinuria have found an association
with secondhand smoking. The association between child-
hood proteinuria and secondhand smoking was identified
in a cross-sectional study using part of the CKD in Children
(CKiD) Study (18). In that study, 366 children ages 1–16
years old were assessed for the association between child-
hood renal outcomes and urine cotinine level. Results
showed that secondhand smoke was independently asso-
ciated with nephrotic-range proteinuria in children with
CKD. Our study using data from a population–based retro-
spective cohort study with 44,595 children did not evaluate
the urine cotinine level; nevertheless, our findings of an as-
sociation between childhood proteinuria and household
smoking after the child’s birth were compatible with those
of the CKiD Study. In addition, our study is the first large–
sample size study to evaluate the association between child-
hood proteinuria in young children and maternal smoking
during pregnancy resulting in passive smoking for the fetus.
Considering nephrogenesis and the mechanism of kidney
damage, cigarette smoking may affect the fetus and the child
differently; however, the effects of smoking on the kidney
and the interaction between secondhand smoking during
pregnancy and after the child’s birth are still unknown.
In adults, two mechanisms mainly underlie the association
between smoking and CKD onset and progression: endo-
thelial damage and oxidative stress (14) causing mesangial
proliferation, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fi-
brosis (25–27). These mechanisms may be extrapolated to
infants and young children (18). Moreover, maternal
smoking during pregnancy affected nephrogenesis. Ciga-
rette smoking releases nicotine and other harmful or po-
tentially harmful substances, such as nitrogen oxide,
polycarbonate, and carbon monoxide (28), some of which
cross the placenta. Indeed, the level of neonatal urine
cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, was higher in newborns
with mothers who smoked during the pregnancy than
newborns with nonsmoking mothers (29). These transpla-
cental substances may affect nephrogenesis, and they be
associated with epigenetic modification, which may ac-
count for the association between maternal smoking dur-
ing pregnancy and postnatal outcomes in children (30–35).
The number of nephrons was lower in the neonatal mice
exposed to maternal smoking than in the neonatal mice
that were born to nonsmoking mothers (36). Low nephron
number was a risk factor for proteinuria and onset and
progression of CKD. On the basis of our previous hypoth-
esis, maternal smoking might be associated with urinary
protein in young children.
This study has several limitations. First, the follow-up
rate was 61.7%, and our results may be subject to selection
bias. The relatively low participation rate in the 3-year
health checkup might be due to families moving during the
interval between the child’s birth and third year. Infant
and young child mortality would not be considered a ma-
jor reason, because mortality among infants and children in
Japan is low (37). Second, the outcome measurement was
conducted only once, because the purpose of urinalysis at
the 3-year health checkup is screening (38). Third, informa-
tion on smoking status was obtained by standardized ques-
tionnaires completed by mothers, and biomarkers, such as
serum cotinine levels, were not available in this study. In
particular, the prevalence of maternal smoking during preg-
nancy may be under-reported. Furthermore, the timing of
smoking during pregnancy is unknown, although it is im-
portant in nephrogenesis. Fourth, in the process of nephro-
genesis, gestational week and birth weight were important
factors; however, proteinuria was not associated with gesta-
tional week, but it was associated with birth weight in the
univariate model and multivariate models. To clarify the as-
sociation between proteinuria, gestational week, and birth
weight, additional study is needed.
In conclusion, our population–based retrospective cohort
study on the basis of child health checkups showed that the
odds of childhood proteinuria at 3 years of age was increased
by 1.2-fold among those exposed to maternal smoking dur-
ing pregnancy and household smoking after the child’s birth,
although the association with household smoking after the
child’s birth was not statistically significant. Additional re-
search is necessary to determine the long-term effects of sec-
ondhand smoke on CKD in adulthood.
