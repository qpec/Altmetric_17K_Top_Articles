Abstract: Interventions targeting portion size and energy density of food and beverage products have
been identified as a promising approach for obesity prevention. This study modelled the potential
cost-effectiveness of: a package size cap on single-serve sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) >375 mL
(package size cap), and product reformulation to reduce energy content of packaged SSBs (energy
reduction). The cost-effectiveness of each intervention was modelled for the 2010 Australia population
using a multi-state life table Markov model with a lifetime time horizon. Long-term health outcomes
were modelled from calculated changes in body mass index to their impact on Health-Adjusted
Life Years (HALYs). Intervention costs were estimated from a limited societal perspective. Cost and
health outcomes were discounted at 3%. Total intervention costs estimated in AUD 2010 were AUD
210 million. Both interventions resulted in reduced mean body weight (package size cap: 0.12 kg;
energy reduction: 0.23 kg); and HALYs gained (package size cap: 73,883; energy reduction: 144,621). Cost
offsets were estimated at AUD 750.8 million (package size cap) and AUD 1.4 billion (energy reduction).
Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that both interventions were “dominant”, and likely to result in
long term cost savings and health benefits. A package size cap and kJ reduction of SSBs are likely to
offer excellent “value for money” as obesity prevention measures in Australia.

1. Introduction
Over the past 30–40 years, the portion-size of many packaged food and beverage products has
increased significantly [1–6]. Package and portion size are known to influence the quantity of food an
individual selects and consumes [5–7]. When offered larger packages or portions of food or beverages,
individuals are known to consume more and are unlikely to compensate by increasing their physical
activity or reducing the quantity of other foods and beverages eaten at the same sitting or later in
the day [6,8–12]. The sustained provision of large portion sizes of nutrient poor but energy dense
foods and beverages may be an important contributor to obesity and non-communicable diseases
(NCD) [8,11].
Initiatives targeting portion and package size (henceforth referred to as portion size) have been
identified as a promising approach to reduce obesity and obesity-related NCDs [13–15]. To-date, the
majority of initiatives targeting portion size have been voluntary, with uptake at the discretion of the
food industry [15]. These interventions have targeted portion size in two main ways: (i) through a
reduction in the quantity of the product provided, predominantly through a change in package size;
or (ii) by reducing the energy density per serve of the food or beverage product (reformulation) [15].
The proposed New York City (NYC) ban of very large servings of sugar-sweetened beverages
(SSBs) is the most high profile example of the first approach, although its implementation was
unsuccessful [16]. The pledge by sugary drink companies to reduce the sugar content and energy
density of their beverages as a part of the UK’s Public Health Responsibility Deal [17], is an example
of the second approach.
In 2011–2012, in Australia, 63% of adults and 25% of children were classified as overweight or
obese, with overweight and obesity deemed the second highest contributor to the burden of disease
in Australia [18]. Similar to other countries, many Australians currently consume poor quality diets
with nearly a third of energy coming from discretionary foods [19]. The latest dietary survey results
showed that 34% of Australians consume SSBs, which contributed to 4% of total energy consumed
and 17% of total sugars consumed for individuals aged two years and older [19]. Furthermore, the
survey highlighted that consumption of SSBs was higher for children aged 2–18 years than adults (47%
and 31%, respectively) [19]. The Australian government has identified tackling obesity as a priority
action [20,21], and changes in portion size as a key target [21]. Despite strong interest by government
and the food industry, the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing such strategies
to reduce obesity at a population level has not been investigated. We therefore estimated the potential
cost-effectiveness of implementing: (i) a package size cap on single-serve products (package size cap);
and (ii) product reformulation to lower energy density (energy reduction) on packaged SSBs available
for sale in Australia.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Overview
This evaluation is one of several that have been undertaken using standardised methods as part
of an obesity prevention priority setting study in Australia. A proportional multi-state, multiple cohort
life table model (Obesity model) was used to estimate lifetime health benefits (Health-Adjusted Life
Years (HALYs)) and costs of changes in body mass index (BMI) arising from changes in kilojoule (kJ)
consumption due to each intervention. Interventions were assumed to operate at their full effectiveness
potential and were compared against a “no intervention” scenario where the distribution of BMI in the
2010 Australian population remains unchanged. We present the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
a series of scenarios, in which key parameters influencing the intervention effect were varied to test
the validity of assumptions.

2.2. Specification of the Interventions
2.2.1. A Package Size Cap on all Packaged Single-Serve SSBs (Package Size Cap)
The first intervention modelled was specified as a package size cap of 375 mL on packaged
single-serve SSBs sold in Australia. This applied to all pre-packaged single-serve SSBs, but excluded
SSBs produced on-site, such as post-mix typically sold in restaurants. A product was deemed
a single-serve product if: (i) the package size was equal to the serving size, as per the nutrition
information panel of the product; or (ii) the servings per pack was indicated as “1” on the product label.
These single-serve or individual portion pack products are commonly consumed in one sitting [22].
The cap size was selected based on recommendations in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG)
which specify that a serving of discretionary food, such as SSB, should provide about 600 kJ which
translates to approximately 375 mL (1 can) [23].
2.2.2. Reformulation of SSBs to a Reduced Energy Density (Energy Reduction)
This intervention was specified as the reformulation of all SSBs available for sale in Australia to a
reduced energy density. A 5% kJ reduction and 30% kJ reduction were modelled as this aligned with
current reformulation examples in the United Kingdom under the Public Health Responsibility Deal
Calorie Reduction Pledge [17]. We did not specify the nutrient composition changes that would be
required to achieve this reduction in energy density; however, it is likely that sugar would be reduced,
as sugar is the primary contributor to the energy content of SSBs. It has also been documented by food
manufacturers that have pledged to the UK’s Public Health Responsibility Deal Calorie Reduction
Pledge that they have reduced sugar in SSBs in order to reduce overall energy content [17,24]. We
did not specify a particular package size or focus on single-serve beverages, as it was unlikely that
manufacturers would reformulate for one pack size only.
2.3. Estimation of Effect Size
Past randomised controlled trials conducted in experimental settings have demonstrated that
changing portion size is an effective strategy to reduce weight gain and obesity; however, to our
knowledge there is no robust evidence regarding the effectiveness of policies targeting portion size
interventions directed as SSB at the population level. Therefore, a range of different scenarios and
associated assumptions were used to determine the likely range of possible effects for each intervention,
using a logic pathway of the likely intervention effect (Figure 1) and based on the best available
evidence. A summary of these scenarios can be found in Table 1 and the assumptions and rationale for
these scenarios can be found in Table 2. For both interventions, the latest available food consumption
data for the Australian population from the 2011–2012 Australian Health Survey (AHS) [25] were used
as a starting point to model how each intervention would alter mean daily energy intake (by age and
sex groups) through a change in consumption. Energy intake changes were assumed to be sustained
over the lifetime of the population since both interventions target a macro-environmental change to
the food system [26–29].

2.4. Package Size Cap Intervention 
Evidence suggests that the package size of a product influences the total quantity of food or 
beverage an individual consumes, especially in the case of single-serve or individual portion packaging 
[6,7]. Experimental studies indicate that providing smaller portion or package sizes results in 
individuals consuming less food and beverages overall; however, these studies were in highly 
controlled experimental settings [6,8,32]. In the absence of effectiveness data on the proposed portion 
size cap implemented at a country level, various theoretical scenarios were developed and evaluated. 
Mean daily consumption (mL/day and kJ/day) of SSBs was derived from the 2011–2012 AHS [25] 
for all ages and sex groups, based on the following food categories: sugar-sweetened carbonated 
beverages, sugar-sweetened flavoured waters, sugar sweetened flavoured iced teas, sugar-sweetened 
sports/electrolyte drinks and sugar-sweetened cordials. Fruit drinks and fruit juices were not included 
as we were unable to distinguish consumption of fruit juice with no added sugars (considered as “core” 
food by the ADGs) to fruit drinks and fruit juice with added sugars. Consumption data in relation to 
specific package sizes were not available from the AHS. Therefore, we estimated the total consumption 
of single-serve SSBs and single-serve SSBs >375 mL using customer purchase data from a recent 
Australian Food Labelling Trial (FLT) [37,38]. These data included self-recorded purchases (from till 
receipts) of each category of SSBs from a non-representative sample (n = 1578) of Australians, over a 
period of 4 weeks [37,38]. Consumption (purchase) data were only available at the household level, not 
the individual level. Consequently, we used volume (mL) of SSBs sold to determine the proportion of 
SSBs that are single-serve. Product data were sourced from the Australian FoodSwitch (FS) Database 
(further details: Dunford et al. 2014 [39]), which provided product name, category, pack(age) size, 
nutrition and serving size information. We matched products from the FLT dataset to the FS dataset 
using information from the product barcode. 
The combined FLT and FS dataset was used to calculate the proportion of units and volume (mL) 
of single-serve and non-single-serve SSBs sold by package size. For all package sizes of single-serve 
SSBs > 375 mL, we calculated the volume greater than 375 mL. We then multiplied this volume by the 
proportion of consumption related to each package size. The proportional reductions were summed 
and then applied uniformly across the AHS consumption data to determine the overall reduction in 
SSB consumption and, hence, the corresponding mean daily kJ reductions, by age and sex groups. 
The base case scenario assumed no compensatory drinking in relation to the reduced portion size. 
Additional analyses examined the following scenarios: (i) some compensatory drinking (25% of 
consumers continue to drink >375 mL of SSBs in different formats such as 3 × 200 mL package sizes); 
and (ii) 10% of consumers substitute their usual SSB to the same package size of a sugar-free (0 kJ) 
alternative. 
Scenarios were modelled under two modes of implementation of the intervention: (i) mandatory 
implementation of the intervention, whereby the Australian government imposed a legislative ban, and 
100% of manufacturers adhered to the package size cap; and (ii) voluntary implementation, whereby 
manufacturers would pledge to adhere to the package size cap (see Table 1 for details of the different 
scenarios examined). Based upon initial data from the implementation of another voluntary initiative 
in Australia, the Health Star Rating front of pack labelling system, we assumed that only 20% of eligible 
products would adopt the voluntary package size cap [30,40].

Government-implemented interventions
Government legislation and 100% adherence by food industry
The cost of legislation has been incorporated. Given that monitoring of
non-compliance is relatively simple, it is assumed that there is 100%
compliance by the food industry.
Voluntary interventions
Assumed 20% adherence by food industry
Based on the Health Star Rating System Cost Benefit Analysis report
[30]
Latest estimates indicate 14.4% uptake rate of the voluntary Health Star

[31]
Consumption patterns
All age groups consume single-serve SSB unit sizes in the
same proportion
Insufficient data to calculate differences in age and sex groups.
Compensatory eating a—package size cap
Assumed 25% of individuals would still consume the same portion
sizes (>375 mL) irrespective of the portion size cap
Assumed 10% of individuals would swap to sugar-free alternatives in
order to continue to consume the same portion sizes (>375 mL)
Consumer dietary recalls indicate that 27.3% of participants ate an
additional snack outside of the workplace cafeteria where there was
controlled portion restrictions
[32]
United States based modelling of the New York City ban on SSBs would
affect 80% of consumer consumption behaviour
[33]
The 2011–2012 Australian Health Survey found that approximately 10% of
individuals drink sugar-free (made with intense sweetener) beverages
[19]
No compensatory eating a—package size cap
Assumed that individuals that usually would consume >375 mL
would move on to the next largest available portion size
Based on estimates in other modelling studies and interventions in
controlled experimental settings
[32,33]
It is also assumed that individuals are unlikely to pay for multiple,
smaller (<375 mL) single serve pack sizes of SSBs to compensate for
their past consumption behaviour of >375 mL of SSBs
Single-serve portion sizes are typically consumed in the one setting
[34]
No compensatory eating a—kilojoule reduction
Assumed individuals would not purchase multiple or increased
volume of SSBs to compensate for kJ reduction
Research has indicated that it is unlikely people would consume more as
the total volume remains the same
[35]
Costs—passing legislation
Assumed this cost would only occur once, in the first year of
the intervention
[36]
Costs—industry and NGO (marketing
and promotion)
It is assumed these costs would only occur in the first 2 years during
the “implementation phase” of the intervention
Once industry and NGO have completed the implementation of the new
portion size, there is no further costs attributable to the intervention
[30]
Costs—government (promotion, education,
enforcement and oversight/monitoring)
It is assumed that these costs will occur for the first 5 years of the
intervention
Based on the Health Star Rating System Cost Benefit Analysis report
[30]
Kilojoule reduction
Assumed to be applied to all SSBs, not specific portion-sizes
If the food industry reformulated, they would reformulate the recipe for all
portion sizes, it would be too costly and inconvenient to reformulate for a
specific portion size only
Kilojoule reduction—5% and 30% reduction targets
Assumed that these are reasonable and achievable targets for food
industry to meet
Reductions in 5% and 30% of energy density across SSB have been
self-reported by food manufacturers as a part of the Public Health
Responsibility Deal’s Calorie Reduction Pledge
[17]
It is assumed that reduction in sugar content will be how food
industry would meet this target

2.4. Package Size Cap Intervention
Evidence suggests that the package size of a product influences the total quantity of food
or beverage an individual consumes, especially in the case of single-serve or individual portion
packaging [6,7]. Experimental studies indicate that providing smaller portion or package sizes results
in individuals consuming less food and beverages overall; however, these studies were in highly
controlled experimental settings [6,8,32]. In the absence of effectiveness data on the proposed portion
size cap implemented at a country level, various theoretical scenarios were developed and evaluated.
Mean daily consumption (mL/day and kJ/day) of SSBs was derived from the 2011–2012 AHS [25]
for all ages and sex groups, based on the following food categories: sugar-sweetened carbonated
beverages, sugar-sweetened flavoured waters, sugar sweetened flavoured iced teas, sugar-sweetened
sports/electrolyte drinks and sugar-sweetened cordials. Fruit drinks and fruit juices were not included
as we were unable to distinguish consumption of fruit juice with no added sugars (considered as
“core” food by the ADGs) to fruit drinks and fruit juice with added sugars. Consumption data in
relation to specific package sizes were not available from the AHS. Therefore, we estimated the total
consumption of single-serve SSBs and single-serve SSBs >375 mL using customer purchase data from
a recent Australian Food Labelling Trial (FLT) [37,38]. These data included self-recorded purchases
(from till receipts) of each category of SSBs from a non-representative sample (n = 1578) of Australians,
over a period of 4 weeks [37,38]. Consumption (purchase) data were only available at the household
level, not the individual level. Consequently, we used volume (mL) of SSBs sold to determine the
proportion of SSBs that are single-serve. Product data were sourced from the Australian FoodSwitch
(FS) Database (further details: Dunford et al. 2014 [39]), which provided product name, category,
pack(age) size, nutrition and serving size information. We matched products from the FLT dataset to
the FS dataset using information from the product barcode.
The combined FLT and FS dataset was used to calculate the proportion of units and volume (mL)
of single-serve and non-single-serve SSBs sold by package size. For all package sizes of single-serve
SSBs > 375 mL, we calculated the volume greater than 375 mL. We then multiplied this volume by the
proportion of consumption related to each package size. The proportional reductions were summed
and then applied uniformly across the AHS consumption data to determine the overall reduction in
SSB consumption and, hence, the corresponding mean daily kJ reductions, by age and sex groups.
The base case scenario assumed no compensatory drinking in relation to the reduced portion
size. Additional analyses examined the following scenarios: (i) some compensatory drinking (25%
of consumers continue to drink >375 mL of SSBs in different formats such as 3 × 200 mL package
sizes); and (ii) 10% of consumers substitute their usual SSB to the same package size of a sugar-free
(0 kJ) alternative.
Scenarios were modelled under two modes of implementation of the intervention: (i) mandatory
implementation of the intervention, whereby the Australian government imposed a legislative ban,
and 100% of manufacturers adhered to the package size cap; and (ii) voluntary implementation, whereby
manufacturers would pledge to adhere to the package size cap (see Table 1 for details of the different
scenarios examined). Based upon initial data from the implementation of another voluntary initiative
in Australia, the Health Star Rating front of pack labelling system, we assumed that only 20% of eligible
products would adopt the voluntary package size cap [30,40].
2.5. Energy Reduction Intervention
The effect size for this intervention was derived by applying a percentage reduction to the energy
intake related to SSBs, from AHS data for each age and sex group. The intervention effect was
calculated as the difference between mean daily energy intake before and after the intervention was
applied. Unlike the package size cap, the intervention effect applied to all SSBs, and was not limited to
single-serve products or those of a particular package size.
We modelled different levels of kJ reductions (5% and 30%) and degrees of implementation
(mandatory: all SSBs reformulated; voluntary: 20% of SSB reformulated, Table 1). It was assumed
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 983
7 of 17
that there was no compensatory drinking for SSBs that were reformulated, as supported by prior
experimental studies that consumers continue to consume the same quantity of foodstuff without
compensating for changes in kJ [41].
2.6. Intervention Costs
Intervention costs were assessed from a limited societal perspective. Costs directly related to the
intervention included: costs to the government, non-government organisations (NGOs), and costs to
the food industry (see Table 3). Specific costs to government included the costs of passing legislation
in the Australian Parliament (for relevant scenarios) [36]. Other cost considerations for governments
included estimates for promoting, educating, monitoring and overseeing the implementation and
upkeep of the interventions, which was consistently applied to all scenarios implemented on a
mandatory basis (refer to Table 1: package size cap intervention, scenarios A1–A3; energy reduction
intervention, scenarios B1 and B2). Costs to NGOs covered advocacy, marketing and promotion of the
interventions and was applied to all scenarios.
Costs to the food industry were derived based on previous analyses of expected costs of
implementation and maintenance of a public health-related intervention (Health Star Rating; HSR)
affecting packaged food in Australia, including costs for industry, government and non-government
organisations [30]. Estimates provided in this report leverage previous data prepared for Food
Standards Australian New Zealand (FSANZ) [42] which estimated the per unit price when undertaking
changes to food and beverage labelling through literature reviews and input from FSANZ and
industry stakeholders. Detailed estimates for costs to industry include costs for proofing, packaging
re-design (changes to package size and shape), labelling changes and labour, ingredients, overhead and
implementation costs (technical, scientific, executive and administrative) [30,42]. It is acknowledged
that costs to the food industry for the different interventions will differ, however it was assumed the
same based on the best evidence currently available. For voluntary implemented scenarios (refer to
Table 1: package size cap intervention, scenarios A4–A6; energy reduction intervention, scenarios B3 and
B4), costs were applied at a reduced rate (20% of costs instead of 100%), reflecting the lower level of
expected implementation.

3. Modelling Cost-Effectiveness
Changes in energy intake (kJ) at the population level (by age and sex) were converted to changes
in body weight (kg) using validated energy balance equations for children (aged 2–19) and adults
(aged ≥ 20) [43,44]. These changes in weight were converted to changes in BMI using average
Australian height and weight by sex, for single-year age groups (children) and five-year age groups
(adults) from the AHS 2011 [25].
The altered distribution of BMI as a result of the interventions was applied to the Obesity model to
estimate lifetime HALYs. The Obesity model quantifies changes in the total mortality and morbidity of
the 2010 Australian population resulting from changes in the epidemiology of obesity-related diseases
(i.e., incidence, prevalence and mortality) and the independent impact of non-disease obesity on quality
of life. Nine causally obesity-related diseases were included: ischaemic heart disease, hypertensive
heart disease, ischemic stroke, diabetes, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, endometrial
cancer and osteoarthritis [45]. Total cost offsets were the result of health care cost savings attributable
to the intervention as a result of reduced incidence of obesity related diseases. Total HALYs and costs
were estimated comparing: (i) a reference population that represents the current BMI distribution and
disease patterns of a cohort of the 2010 Australian population; and (ii) an intervention population
that is identical to the reference population but includes the impact of the intervention on the BMI
distribution of the population. The modelling was conducted for the Australian population aged
2–100 years, over their lifetime.
All costs and benefits were discounted at 3% and are expressed in 2010 values. The Health Price
Index from the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare (AIHW) [46] was used to adjust costs to
2010 AUD as required. The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the
incremental net costs by incremental health benefits of the intervention compared to current practice.
Further details on the model can be found elsewhere [47].
Uncertainty Analysis
The estimates for each cost element and the changes in weight, BMI and HALYs resulting from the
interventions were estimated as means with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Monte Carlo simulation
(2000 iterations) was used to estimate parameter uncertainty using Ersatz (version 1.35) software—an
Excel add-in [48]. ICERs are presented on a cost-effectiveness plane, which demonstrates the range of
plausible ICERs for each intervention and associated scenarios. Interventions that are both cost saving
and increase health benefits are considered “dominant”. If the intervention is more costly and more
effective than current practice, a willingness to pay threshold of AUD 50,000 per HALY gained [49] is

4.1. Changes in Consumption, Energy Intake and Body Weight
Estimates of the likely impact of the package size cap on single-serve beverages >375 mL on changes
in consumption and the resultant changes in energy intakes are presented in Table 4. Of the SSBs
currently sold in Australia, we estimated that 27% of all SSBs sold were single-serve. The intervention
would affect 16% of SSBs overall, with approximately two thirds of single-serve SSBs (59%) being
greater than 375 mL. The effect of the package size intervention differed across the population based on
current consumption of SSBs. The base case scenario would result in an average change in consumption
of SSBs from 564.4 kJ/day to 550 kJ/day across the entire population. This mean decrease in energy
intake of 14.4 kJ/day translates in to a 0.12 kg weight reduction and 0.05 BMI unit reduction. Effect
estimates were observed to have a larger impact on males across all age groups. Furthermore, teenagers
aged 13–19 years (both sex) and males aged ≥20 years were also observed to benefit most from the
intervention, with weight reductions of 0.15 kg and 0.17 kg, respectively. Details of the estimate of
effects by age and sex can be seen in Table 4.

Reformulation of all SSBs to a reduced energy density would affect 100% of SSBs sold in Australia
(n = 3226 stock keeping units; SKUs), and 71 known brands. The base case 5% kJ reduction of SSBs
resulted in a higher average change in consumption of SSBs than the package size cap intervention:
from 564.4 kJ/day to 536.8 kJ/day, across the entire population. This also attributed to higher weight
and BMI reductions across the population (0.23 kg, 0.10 BMI units; Table 4). As with the package
size cap, teenagers and males aged ≥20 years were seen to benefit most from the intervention. For
both interventions, estimated effects were observed to be substantially higher for scenarios that were
implemented on a mandatory basis (scenarios A1–A3; B1–B2; Supplementary Table S1). As expected,
the intervention involving a 30% kJ reduction (scenario B2) had the greatest effect on change in energy
consumption, weight and BMI, followed by scenario A3 and A6. The scenarios observed to have the
least estimated effect were those implemented on a voluntary basis (scenarios A5, A6 and B3).
4.2. Costs
Input cost parameters for each intervention are presented in Table 3. Estimated intervention
costs to achieve the modelled change in kJ consumption through a portion size cap or a kJ reduction
intervention vary between scenarios, but fall within a range of AUD 44.6 M (95% UI: 31.6 M–57.1 M)
to AUD 210.5 M (95% UI: 147.5 M–270.3 M). Government-imposed legislative scenarios for both
the package size cap and reformulation interventions had a higher intervention cost (AUD 209.7 M;
95% UI: 147.7 M–272.9 M) than the scenario modelling a voluntary change by manufacturers (AUD
44.5 M; 95% UI: 31.4 M–57.5 M) (Table 5). However, mandatory regulation also resulted in greater
health outcomes (total HALYs gained range: 55,581 to 822,835) compared to scenarios modelling
voluntary implementation (total HALYs gained range: 11,043 to 289,045). The bulk of the costs of both
interventions fall on industry (Table 3).
4.3. Cost-Effectiveness Results
Our results indicate that both interventions, in all respective scenarios, were dominant—i.e.,
they were both cost saving and resulted in additional HALYs gained (Table 3 and Figure 2). Over
the lifetime of the 2010 Australian population, the seemingly modest changes in weight as a result
of the base case package size cap intervention translated to substantial health gains and total net cost
savings (Table 3). This result was consistent across all scenarios for this intervention, with scenarios
implemented under a mandatory assumption (scenarios A1–A3) resulting in better cost-effectiveness
results than those modelled under a voluntary assumption (scenarios A4–A6). Scenarios with the SSB
substitution (scenarios A3 and A6) were estimated to have substantial increases in benefits than other
package size cap scenarios modelled.
For the base case kJ reduction intervention, the changes in weight across the population (all age
and sex groups) translated to a substantive change in HALYs gained and total net costs (Table 5). This
was also observed for all scenarios modelled in this intervention. As expected, scenarios modelled
under the assumption of a 30% kJ reduction (scenarios B2 and B4) demonstrated a five-fold increase
in benefits compared to scenarios modelled under a 5% kJ reduction (scenarios B1 and B3). When
compared to the package size cap, the kJ reduction intervention was observed to have larger benefits.
For both interventions, scenarios modelled based on a voluntary implementation (A3–A6, and
B3–B4) resulted in lower implementation costs. However, these interventions were also much less
cost-effective due to lower HALYs gained and lower cost savings. Both interventions were estimated
to have beneficial impacts on mortality rates across seven of the nine modelled obesity-related diseases.
The kJ reduction intervention was observed to have almost double the benefits with an average
26,420 lives saved in comparison to the 13,590 lives saved as a result of the package size cap. For both
interventions, the larger changes in mortality were projected for ischemic heart disease, followed by
diabetes, kidney cancer and stroke.

5. Discussion
This cost-effectiveness analysis showed that both the package size cap and energy reduction
interventions were likely to be “dominant” (both effective and cost saving) in the Australian context
under current modelling assumptions (Figure 2). This modelling exercise suggests that policy-based
population wide interventions such as these are likely to offer excellent “value for money” as obesity
prevention measures, especially if implemented on a mandatory basis.

and associated scenarios. 
Results from the modelled scenarios confirm the current consensus that population-level portion 
size interventions are a promising approach to addressing obesity and obesity-related NCDs [13–15] 
and therefore should be considered by policy makers. There is a lack of cost-effectiveness studies that 
investigate the impact of population-based interventions that change the food environment. Such 
studies are needed for policy makers to make informed decisions on how to spend limited resources 
[50]. To provide further context to policy makers as to whether these proposed interventions are a 
worthwhile investment, the results of these analyses should be interpreted in relation to other 
comparable cost-effectiveness studies in the Australian setting. To-date, only one other study has 
used a similar standardised methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of active transport on 
obesity-related health outcomes [47]. This study found that active transportation interventions result 
in fewer health benefits relative to their cost. It follows that interventions targeting positive change 
in the food environment may be more impactful than those seeking to increase levels of active 
transportation. Another cost-effectiveness study from the broader ACE-Prevention study [51], 
evaluated the implementation of traffic light labelling (TLL) and a junk food tax targeting at 
Australian adults [29]. This study and other interventions from ACE-Prevention which sought to 
implement changes to the food environment were found to be dominant compared to “program-
based” food interventions [51]. The results of our study were comparable to a more recent study 
which modelling the impact of a tax on SSBs on the 2010 Australian adult population [52]. 
The primary strength of this analysis is the policy relevance of the interventions chosen. In 
Australia in 2015, the Healthy Food Partnership (the Partnership) was established as the primary 
government-led initiative to address food reformulation in relation to NCD prevention. The 
Partnership consists of the Australian Government, food industry bodies and leading public health 
groups that have agreed to work cooperatively to tackle obesity, encourage health eating and 
empower food manufacturers to make positive changes to their products [21]. The interventions 
modelled in this research strongly align to two of the three core objectives of the Partnership (portion 
size and reformulation) [53]. Using multiple scenarios and varying realistic assumptions, this

In Australia in 2015, the Healthy Food Partnership (the Partnership) was established as the
primary government-led initiative to address food reformulation in relation to NCD prevention.
The Partnership consists of the Australian Government, food industry bodies and leading public
health groups that have agreed to work cooperatively to tackle obesity, encourage health eating and

size and reformulation) [53]. Using multiple scenarios and varying realistic assumptions, this research
has provided the opportunity to assess the potential impacts of such public health initiatives on the
Australian population.
The limitations of this study centre around the quality of evidence relating to intervention
effectiveness. Direct evidence supporting the likely impact of the interventions on consumer behaviour
is weak. To counter this uncertainty, we made conservative assumptions to estimates of change
in energy consumption; in addition to modelling multiple scenarios of intervention effectiveness.
Another limitation involved the estimation of consumption of single-serve SSBs. As data on SSB
consumption by package size were not available from nationally representative dietary surveys, we
had to use a calculated estimate using sales data from a relatively small intervention trial. This may
have underestimated the actual consumption of single-serve SSBs. As more evidence of these effects of
these types of interventions becomes available, these assumptions can be revisited.
Furthermore, as definitive data on the costs for changes in packaging and reformulation could
not be sourced, estimated costs to industry are not well substantiated. However, for the package size
cap intervention, as food manufacturers are reducing their products to a package size that already
exists (375 mL), we think the estimates are likely to be conservative. Additionally, although it is
acknowledged that implementing a package size cap or energy reduction may be more complex than
estimates of implementing changes to front of pack labelling (from which the cost estimates were
derived), we believe that if the food industry were given sufficient lead time, the costs to changing
packaging and reformulation would be significantly reduced because of changes in product packaging
and formulation that occur as a part of natural product-lifecycles. Our model did not take in to account
the potential loss of revenue to the food industry and its subsequence impact on consumers. It is
likely that these costs would be recovered from re-distribution of sales (e.g., sales lost from 600 mL
SSBs would be replaced from sales from 375 mL), however it is also possible that some costs may be
passed on to the consumer, especially for the small-to-medium sized manufacturers. Additionally,
as with all population-based models, our results represent a simplified version of reality. However,
input parameters included 95% uncertainty intervals determined by the Monte Carlo simulation
(2000 iterations) using Ersatz (version 1.35).
The implications of this study are that both a package size cap and energy reduction on SSBs are
likely to be highly cost-effective and have sizeable effects on population health. Despite the degree of
uncertainty around the size of benefits, both interventions should be considered for implementation in
Australia. Interventions chosen to be modelled were based on a global review of current literature and
policies [15], and reflected currently implemented Calorie Reduction Pledges as proposed in the United
Kingdom’s Responsibility Deal [17]. Furthermore, our chosen interventions also reflected portion size
related public health initiatives in the United States, such as the proposed New York City ban on 16oz
SSBs [54] and the Health Weight Commitment pledge. Comparisons of government implemented
legislative scenarios and voluntary scenarios highlighted the importance of food industry adherence
if these interventions were implemented in a real-world setting. Both HALYs gained and healthcare
system savings were higher in the government legislated scenarios, than the voluntary scenarios
(Supplementary Table S1). The role of government support is thus of great importance to the success
of these interventions [55].
Further research in this area could be undertaken to investigate other scenarios for the design and
implementation on both interventions modelled in this analyses. For example, this model could be
used to analyse the effects of a package size cap or energy reduction targeted at different food categories
such as confectionery, ready meals (including those sold at Quick Service Restaurants), snack foods
and foods specifically designed for school canteens. Furthermore, this model could be used to look
at the potential impact of pricing food items proportionate to package size. Many countries are
taking action around SSBs, including SSB taxes, and it would also be valuable to model the impact of
combined interventions targeting SSBs. Importantly, it would also be imperative to perform research
into consumer acceptability of portion size interventions, particularly because consumer acceptance
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 983

studies have indicated that such initiatives may be perceived by consumers to restrict their freedom of
choice [32,56].
6. Conclusions
This study provides an overview of the potential health benefits and cost-effectiveness of two
potential population-based, SSBs portion size interventions in Australia. Our estimates demonstrate
that both a package size cap and energy reduction in SSBs are likely to have significant health-related
benefits and the potential for healthcare system cost savings. Estimates further highlight the critical
role of food industry adherence to achieve the best outcomes from the interventions, and strongly
support the role of government to implement and oversee such initiatives. In the Australian context,
the current Healthy Food Partnership provides a potential vehicle for the government to demonstrate
such leadership in this area.
