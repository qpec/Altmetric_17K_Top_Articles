 Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs in 
one-third of patients who have Brugada 
syndrome (BS). It may be the first or 
second clinical finding. In patients 
with BS, SCA usually does not occur 
because of exercise. These arrhythmia 
cases are usually seen in children who 
have a high fever. In adults, it occurs 
depending on high alcohol consumption 
and, more frequently, during their night 
sleep. In some rare cases, an SCA may 
be seen in patients with BS because 
of eating a large bite of food.1, 
 
2 No 
co-occurrence has been reported in 
children until now.
This study presents the case of a 
patient who had a sudden cardiac 
attack while eating a large hot dog. 
After successful resuscitation, he was 
diagnosed with BS and implanted 
with an implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (ICD).
CASE REPORT
A 9-year-old male patient had 
syncope and cardiopulmonary 
arrest 1 month previously while 
he was eating a large hot dog at 
school. Ventricular fibrillation was 
seen during resuscitation. Then, 
the patient was defibrillated and 
resuscitated for 30 minutes. He was 
treated as an inpatient at another 
children’s intensive care service. He 
was sent to our clinic because of a 
suspicious ST elevation in V2 in his 
electrocardiograph (ECG) (Fig 1). No 
special disease was reported in his 
family history. His ECG, exercise stress 
test, and other biochemical analyses 
were normal. Any specific drug use 
was not reported. According to the 
result of the ajmaline test, a type 1 
Brugada pattern was observed in his 
ECG and he was diagnosed with BS 
(Fig 2). A further electrophysiologic 
study (EPS) also was applied to the 
patient. Using a complete ventricular 
stimulation protocol, no significant or 
sustained arrhythmias were induced. 
An ICD was implanted in the patient. 
The patient’s family was screened. 
The patient has no family history of

Patients who are diagnosed with Brugada syndrome (BS) usually 
experience sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and arrhythmia when they have 
a high fever, consume alcohol, and, more frequently, during their night 
sleep. In some rare cases, an SCA can be seen depending on a possible 
vagal stimulus, such as eating a large bite of food. We describe a 9-year-old 
patient who had a sudden cardiac attack while he was eating a large hot dog. 
After successful resuscitation, a suspicious ST elevation in V2 was seen in 
his electrocardiographic evaluation. He was diagnosed with BS after the 
ajmaline test and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. 
Vagal stimulus–dependent SCA after eating a large bite of food may be the 
first symptom of BS. For this reason, the electrocardiographic results of the 
children who had a cardiac arrest after eating a large meal with big bites 
should be evaluated in detail.

 BS. The ECG results of the patient’s 
parents were normal; however, 
his brother had a suspicious ST 
elevation in V1–V2 when it was high 
level (second intercostal space). 
An ajmaline test was applied to the 
brother and he was also diagnosed 
with BS. Treatment was not given 
because he was asymptomatic. 
The patient and his brother were 
advised to avoid high fever, alcohol 
consumption, larger-size food items, 
and the drugs that trigger BS. The 
result of the patient’s genetic study 
is awaited.
DISCUSSION
BS is a heritable, life-threatening 
cardiac channelopathy characterized 
by either a complete or an incomplete 
right bundle branch block and 
ST-segment elevation in V1–V3 on 
an ECG.1 This study showed that 26 
of 30 patients who had ventricular 
fibrillation had vagal stimulus–
dependent arrhythmia during their 
sleep. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that vagal stimulus plays an important 
role in arrhythmia pathogenesis.3  
A study also showed that the possibility 
of having a cardiac arrest was 7.7% in 
patients with BS who had already had 
a cardiac arrest, 1.9% in patients with 
syncope, and 0.5% in asymptomatic 
patients.4 It was assumed that the 
sensitivity of the drug provocation 
test was between 71% and 80% in the 
patients who had an SCN5A mutation. 
This percentage represented only 
20% of the patients who had BS. In the 
BS cases without an SCN5A mutation, 
the sodium channel blocking test was 
100% sensitive in the patients who 
survived SCA and had temporal type I 
ECG. High fever, alcohol, taking large

 bites from food, and drugs that trigger 
BS should be avoided when a typical BS 
ECG pattern is seen during the ajmaline 
test. The most important presymptoms 
are a spontaneous type I ECG pattern 
and inducible ventricular arrhythmia 
during evoked potentials in terms of 
prognosis and risk evaluation.1 Despite 
numerous studies, the role of EPS for 
reliable risk stratification in patients 
with BS still remains controversial.5, 
 
6  
This is illustrated by the finding of a 
negative EPS in our case.
The automatic modulation in BS 
plays an important role in the 
occurrence of tonus ventricular 
arrhythmia.2 Food intake may affect 
the vagal activity. Nogami et al7 
showed the ST elevation with glucose 
and insulin tests in patients with 
BS. They concluded that the serum 
concentrations of glucose and insulin 
increase after eating a large meal and 
this may cause an ST elevation. Ikeda 
et al2 showed that the characteristic 
ECG alterations increase in patients 
with BS after eating large bites of 
food. This study emphasized that 
eating large bites of food and the 
characteristic ECG alterations after 
SCA may be the causes of vagal 
stimulus–dependent SCA.
CONCLUSIONS
An SCA may be the first and most 
devastating clinical finding of BS, 
depending on a possible vagal 
stimulus after eating a large bite 
of food. It should be kept in mind 
that patients with BS may have 
characteristic ECG changes develop 
after eating a large bite of food and 
SCA. To be able to make a correct 
diagnosis, it is important to make an 
ECG evaluation in patients who had 
a cardiac attack. ICD implantation is 
important as a secondary protection 
for patients with BS who had a 
cardiac attack.
