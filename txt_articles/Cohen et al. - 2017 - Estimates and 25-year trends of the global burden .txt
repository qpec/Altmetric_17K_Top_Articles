Summary
Background Exposure to ambient air pollution increases morbidity and mortality, and is a leading contributor to 
global disease burden. We explored spatial and temporal trends in mortality and burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels.
Methods We estimated global population-weighted mean concentrations of particle mass with aerodynamic 
diameter less than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) and ozone at an approximate 11 km × 11 km resolution with satellite-based 
estimates, chemical transport models, and ground-level measurements. Using integrated exposure–response 
functions for each cause of death, we estimated the relative risk of mortality from ischaemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infections 
from epidemiological studies using non-linear exposure–response functions spanning the global range 
of exposure.
Findings Ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranking mortality risk factor in 2015. Exposure to PM2·5 caused 4·2 million 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·7 million to 4·8 million) deaths and 103·1 million (90·8 million 115·1 million) 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015, representing 7·6% of total global deaths and 4·2% of global DALYs, 
59% of these in east and south Asia. Deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 increased from 3·5 million (95% UI 
3·0 million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 4·2 million (3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 2015. Exposure to ozone caused an 
additional 254 000 (95% UI 97 000–422 000) deaths and a loss of 4·1 million (1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2015.
Interpretation Ambient air pollution contributed substantially to the global burden of disease in 2015, which increased 
over the past 25 years, due to population ageing, changes in non-communicable disease rates, and increasing air 
pollution in low-income and middle-income countries. Modest reductions in burden will occur in the most polluted 
countries un 
less PM2·5 values are decreased substantially, but there is potential for substantial health benefits from 
exposure reduction.

Introduction
Exposure to ambient air pollution increases mortality 
and morbidity and shortens life expectancy.1,2 The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2015 (GBD 2015) estimated the burden of disease 
attributable to 79 risk factors in 195 countries from 
1990 to 2015. GBD 2015 identified air pollution as a 
leading cause of global disease burden, especially in low-
income and middle-income countries.3 In view of the 
important role of public policy in mitigating this risk and 
the potential for substantial health benefits related to 
efforts to reduce emissions of climate-forcing agents, we 
explored spatial and temporal trends in mortality and 
burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution 
from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels.
Methods
Overview
Attributing deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) to ambient air pollution requires spatially and 
temporally resolved estimates of population-weighted 
exposure, specification of a theoretical minimum risk 
exposure level (TMREL), estimation of relative risks across 
the exposure distribution, and estimates of the deaths and 
DALYs for diseases linked causally to air pollution. We 
combined estimates of exposure and relative risk to 
estimate the population-attributable fraction (PAF), the 
proportion of deaths and DALYs attributable to exposure 
above the TMREL. The numbers of deaths and DALYs for 
specific diseases were multiplied by the PAF to estimate 
the burden attributable to exposure. A more general

description of the methods used to estimate the PAF and 
attributable burdens in GBD 2015 has been reported 
previously;3 here, we present details specific to air pollution.
GBD 2015 extended the methods and datasets used in 
GBD 2013 to estimate the burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution for 1990–2015.4,5 Estimates of 
exposure to ambient air pollution were updated with 
additional air pollution measurements and improved 
estimation methods,3,6 relative risk estimates were updated 
using more recent epidemiological studies and refined 
statistical estimation techniques,3 and new methods were 
developed and applied to identify key drivers of global 
trends in the burden of disease attributable to ambient air 
pollution. The GBD 2015 estimates update the entire time 
series beginning in 1990, so the changes in methodology 
affect the estimates for each year in the 1990–2015 interval 
and supersede estimates previously released.
Estimation of exposure
Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particles 
whose sources and composition vary spatially and 
temporally. Population-weighted annual mean concen-
trations of particle mass with aerodynamic diameter less 
than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) and tropospheric ozone are the 
two indicators used to quantify exposure to air pollution. 
PM2·5 is the most consistent and robust predictor of 
mortality in studies of long-term exposure.7,8 Ozone, a 
gas produced via atmospheric reactions of precursor 
emissions, is associated with respiratory disease 
independent of PM2·5 exposure.9,10 We estimated exposure 
to PM2·5 and ozone for the global population at spatial 
scales relevant to human exposure (appendix pp 2–4).3,6 
Global annual mean exposure to PM2·5 was estimated 
in 5-year intervals from 1990 to 2015, at 0·1 × 0·1° 
(~11 km × 11 km at the equator) resolution using estimates 
from satellites combined with a chemical transport 
model, surface measure 
ments, and geographical data. 
We aggregated gridded exposure concentrations to 
national-level population-weighted means using the 
corresponding grid cell population value.11 National-level 
population-weighted mean concentrations and the 
95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) around this mean 
were estimated by sampling 1000 draws of each grid cell 
value and its uncertainty distribution.
As in previous assessments,4,5 we used a chemical 
transport model to calculate a running 3-month mean 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Literature reviews done by the US Environmental Protection 
Agency, WHO, and others have shown that long-term exposure 
to ambient air pollution increases mortality and morbidity from 
cardiovascular and respiratory disease and lung cancer and 
shortens life expectancy. Based on this evidence, the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
estimated the burden of disease attributable to 79 risk factors, 
including ambient air pollution, in 195 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2015. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2015 identified air pollution as a leading 
cause of global disease burden, especially in low-income and 
middle-income countries.
Added value of this study
In this Article, we show the crucial part played by broad 
demographic and epidemiological trends. We estimated that 
long-term exposure to ambient fine particle air pollution (PM2·5) 
caused 4·2 million deaths and 103·1 million lost years of healthy 
life in 2015, representing 7·6% of total global mortality, making it 
the fifth-ranked global risk factor in 2015. Exposure to ozone was 
responsible for an additional 254 000 deaths. Although global 
rates of mortality due to PM2·5 exposure decreased from 1990 to 
2015, the absolute numbers of attributable deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years increased because of rising levels of 
pollution and increasing numbers of deaths from 
non-communicable diseases in the largest low-income and 
middle-income countries in east and south Asia, where 
populations are growing and ageing. This research places the 
burden of disease as a result of ambient air pollution within the 
context of other common potentially modifiable risk factors at a 
national level, helping to prioritise air pollution from a population 
health perspective. In the analysis of trends in the burden of 
disease caused by ambient air pollution, we show where, and the 
extent to which, ambient air pollution is changing as a contributor 
to disease burden, and the extent to which the trends in the 
attributable burden reflect progress, or absence of it, in reducing 
exposure versus changes in demographic factors. In so doing, we 
were able to elucidate the challenges that must be overcome to 
reduce the public health effects of exposure to air pollution.
Implications of all the available evidence
Ambient air pollution was a leading risk factor for the global 
burden of disease in 2015 and has remained stable, and its 
contribution to the global burden of disease has remained 
relatively stable, from 1990 to 2015. Trends in attributable 
deaths reflect both demographic and epidemiological trends 
and increasing levels of air pollution in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Should these trends continue, they 
will lead to increasing burdens if major reductions are not made 
in pollution levels. Non-linear exposure–response functions 
suggest modest reductions in burden in the most polluted 
countries unless PM2·5 levels markedly decline. As a result, the 
challenges for future reductions in the burden of disease 
attributable to air pollution are substantial. International 
experience has shown that exposure to ambient air pollution 
and its associated burden of disease can be lowered for entire 
populations via policy action at the national and subnational 
levels via aggressive air quality management programmes, 
focused on major sources of air pollution.

(of daily 1 h maximum values) ozone concentration for each 
grid cell over 1 year, from which we selected the maximum 
of these values, consistent with epidemio 
logical studies 
that use a seasonal (summer) mean, while accounting for 
global variation in the timing of the ozone (summer) 
season. We estimated population-weighted mean ozone 
concentrations and 95% UIs for each country as described 
for PM2·5, assuming a normal distribution with a 95% UI 
within 6% either side of the estimated mean concentration.
Theoretical minimum risk exposure level
TMREL was assigned a uniform distribution of 
2·4–5·9 µg/m³ for PM2·5 and 33·3–41·9 parts per billion 
for ozone, bounded by the minimum and fifth percentiles 
of exposure distributions from outdoor air pollution 
cohort studies (appendix pp 7, 11–14). The uniform 
distribution represents the uncertainty regarding adverse 
effects of low-level exposure.3,12,13
Risk estimation
We estimated the burden attributable to PM2·5 for 
ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease 
(ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke), lung cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 
lower respiratory infections (LRI), and the burden 
attributable to ozone for COPD.3,14 Evidence linking these 
diseases with exposure to ambient air pollution was 
judged to be consistent with a causal relationship on 
the basis of criteria specified for GBD risk factors.3
We developed integrated exposure–response functions 
(IERs) for each cause of death to estimate the relative risk 
of mortality over the entire global range of ambient 
annual mean PM2·5 concentrations using risk estimates 
from studies of ambient air pollution, household air 
pollution, and second-hand smoke exposure and active 
smoking (appendix pp 8–14).12,14 IERs assign con-
centrations of PM2·5 to each type of exposure on an 
equivalent µg/m³ basis assuming that risk is determined 
by the 24-h PM2·5 inhaled dose regardless of the exposure 
source, consistent with previous findings.15,16 We updated 
IERs from those used in GBD 2013 by adding additional 
risk estimates for air pollution (appendix pp 11–14) 
and active smoking.17 An alternative method to estimate 
exposure to second-hand smoke was used that incor-
porated estimates of PM2·5 attributable to exposure per 
cigarette, breathing rate, and number of cigarettes 
smoked in the country where each study was done. 
Further details are provided in the appendix (pp 8–14).

Curves show the central estimate of the integrated exposure–response (solid lines) and their 95% uncertainty intervals (shaded areas). The relative risk equals 1 for 
PM2·5 concentrations of 0–2·4 µg/m³ (ie, lower bound of the theoretical minimum risk exposure level uncertainty distribution). Additional details are provided in the

The IER has the mathematical form: 
where z is the level of PM2·5 and zcf is the TMREL, below 
which no additional risk is assumed, with
if z is greater than zcf and zero otherwise. Here, 1 + α is 
the maximum risk, β is the ratio of the IER at low to high 
concentrations, and γ is the power of PM2·5 concentration.
Epidemiological evidence suggests that the relative risks 
for IHD and stroke decline with age.18 We modified the 
particulate matter source-specific relative risk for both 
IHD and stroke mortality as described by Burnett and 
colleagues12 and applied this age modification to the relative 
risks, fitting the IER model for each age group separately. 
Observed relative risks were related to the IER within a 
Bayesian framework using the STAN fitting algorithm, 
as described in the appendix (pp 15–17). Given the true 
values of the four parameters (α, β, γ, zcf), we assumed 
that the logarithm of each study’s observed relative risk 
was normally distributed, with mean defined by the IER 
and variance given by the square of the observed SE of 
the study-specific log-relative risk estimate plus an 
additional variance term for each of the four sources on 
PM2·5 exposure (outdoor air pollution, second-hand 
smoke, household air pollution, and active smoking). 
Details regarding model fitting and code are provided in 
the appendix (pp 15–17).
We calculated 1000 predicted values of the IER for each 
PM2·5 concentration based on the posterior distributions 
of (α, β, γ) and the prespecified uniform distribution of 
TMREL to characterise uncertainty in the estimates of 
the IER. The mean of the 1000 IER predictions at each 
concentration was used as the central estimate, with 
uncertainty defined by 95% UIs.
We estimated the relative risk of COPD mortality from 
ozone exposure using a linear exposure–response function 
for respiratory mortality from Jerrett and colleagues.10 
Additional details are provided in the appendix (p 14).
Estimation of PAF and burden
We calculated DALYs and deaths attributable to ambient 
air pollution by applying the year-specific, location-
specific, age-specific, and sex-specific PAF to the 
numbers of DALYs and deaths, as described in detail 
elsewhere.19,20 PAF estimation methods are summarised 
in the appendix (pp 20–21).

higher values. We fit age-specific functions for IHD 
and cerebrovascular disease, and estimated decreasing 
relative risks as age increased from 25 years to 80 years.
Global population-weighted PM2·5 increased by 11·2% 
from 1990 (39·7 µg/m³) to 2015 (44·2 µg/m³), increasing 
most rapidly from 2010 to 2015 (figure 2). Among the 
world’s ten most populous countries, exposures since 2010 
increased in Bangladesh and India and were stable but 
remained high in Pakistan and China. Exposures decreased 
substantially in Nigeria and were low and slightly decreased 
in the USA, Brazil, and Russia. Population-weighted 
concentrations were low and stable in Japan and Indonesia.
The highest estimated population-weighted mean con-
centrations in 2015 were for Qatar (107·3 µg/m³), 
Saudi Arabia (106·2 µg/m³), and Egypt (104·7 µg/m³), 
followed by Bangladesh (89·4 µg/m³), Mauritania 
(85·1 µg/m³), Libya (79·2 µg/m³), Nepal (75·0 µg/m³), 
and India (74·3 µg/m³). The population-weighted mean 
PM2·5 in China was 58·4 µg/m³, with provincial 
population-weighted means ranging from 19·1 µg/m³ to 
79·3 µg/m³. The lowest estimated population-weighted 
means were in several Pacific island nations and 
territories (Kiribati, American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, 
Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Guam), Brunei, Sweden, 
Greenland, New Zealand, Australia, Finland, Iceland, 
Liberia, and Canada (all ≤8·0 µg/m³).
Population-weighted ozone levels increased by 7·2% 
globally from 1990 (56·8 parts per billion [ppb]) to 2015 
(60·9 ppb). Within the world’s ten most populous 
countries, increases of 14–25% were noted in China, 
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Brazil, with smaller 
increases in Japan and negligible changes in Russia and 
Nigeria (data not shown). Decreases in population-
weighted concentrations were noted in the USA (5·2%; 
from 70·2 ppb to 66·5 ppb) and Indonesia (12·9%; from 
50·2 ppb to 43·7 ppb).
Long-term exposure to PM2·5 contributed to 4·2 million 
(95% UI 3·7 million to 4·8 million) deaths and to a loss 
of 103·1 million (90·8 million to 115·1 million) DALYs in 
2015, representing 7·6% of total global deaths and 4·2% 
of global DALYs, which is an increase from 1990. In 2015, 
ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranked risk factor for global 
deaths and sixth-ranked risk factor for DALYs among the 
risk factors included in GBD 2015 (figure 3). DALYs 
attributable to long-term exposure to PM2·5 consisted of 
99·2 million (95% UI 87·7 million to 111·0 million) years 
of life lost and 3·9 million (2·6 million to 5·2 million) 
years lived with disability in 2015.
Household air pollution from solid fuel use was 
responsible for 2·8 million (95% UI 2·2 million to 
3·6 million) deaths and 85·6 million (66·7 million to

106·1 million) DALYs in 2015. Together, ambient and 
household air pollution were estimated to have caused 
6·4 million (5·7 million to 7·3 million) deaths in 2015. 
Mortality from cardiovascular disease (IHD and 
cerebrovascular disease) accounted for most deaths and 
DALYs attributable to ambient PM2·5 air pollution 
(figure 4; table 1). Ambient PM2·5 air pollution contributed 
to 17·1% of IHD, 14·2% of cerebrovascular disease, 
16·5% of lung cancer, 24·7% of LRI, and 27·1% of COPD 
mortality in 2015 according to GBD compare.21 
Age-standardised death and DALY rates due to 
exposure to PM2·5 were higher in males than females 
(table 1), as a result of higher all-cause mortality rates in 
males (1018·6 per 100 000 males vs 703·4 per 
100 000 females21). They were also higher in elderly 
people (age >70 years) than in children (age <5 years; 
table 1), mainly because of age-related differences in 
mortality from non-communicable diseases (41·4 per 
100 000 children aged 1–5 years vs 2914·4 per 
100 000 adults aged 70–74 years21). Ambient PM2·5 
contributed to 202 000 (95% UI 152 700–254 600) deaths 
and 17·4 million (13·1 million to 21·9 million) DALYs 
from LRI in children younger than 5 years. 
Deaths attributable to long-term exposure to PM2·5 in 
2015 varied substantially among countries (figure 5). 
South and east Asia contributed 59% of the 4·2 million 
global deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 in 2015 
(1·36 million deaths [95% UI 1·19 million to 1·56 million] 
in south Asia and 1·14 million deaths [0·97 million to 
1·31 million] in east Asia). In World Bank high-income 
countries, exposure to ambient PM2·5 contributed to 4·3% 
of total deaths in 2015 versus 9·0% in upper-middle-
income, 8·7% in lower-middle-income, and 4·9% in low-
income countries. These differences in attributable 
mortality mostly reflect the fraction of total deaths from 
cardiovascular disease among countries.3 The highest 
age-standardised rates of death due to PM2·5 exposure 
were in southern Asia (133·4 per 100 000 population, 
95% 
UI 
114·2–152·6), 
central 
Asia 
(85·2 
per 
100 000 population, 72·0–98·9), and eastern Asia 
(83·2 per 100 000 population, 70·4–95·6). Rates in high-
income North American (USA, Canada, and Greenland; 
17·8 per 100 000 people [95% UI 13·6–22·9]), Asian 
(18·7 per 100 000 people [14·6–23·7]), and western 
European countries (19·9 per 100 000 [15·9–24·8]) were 
four to eight times lower (appendix pp 26–1078).

attributable deaths and DALYs: 52% and 50% of the 
respective global totals. Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh 
had the highest age-adjusted mortality rates, more than 
seven times higher than those of Japan and the USA 
(table 2; appendix pp 26–1078).
Global mortality due to ambient PM2·5 increased from 
1990 to 2015. Attributable deaths rose from 3·5 million 
(95% UI 3·0 million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 3·8 million 
(3·3 million to 4·3 million) in 2000, and 4·2 million 
(3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 2015 (figure 4). However, 
age-standardised PM2·5 mortality rates decreased from 
65·6 per 100 000 people (95% UI 56·9–74·9) in 1990 to 
57·5 per 100 000 people (50·2–64·8) in 2015.
Trends in PM2·5-attributable mortality among countries 
largely reflect changes in PM2·5-attributable mortality from 
cardiovascular disease (appendix pp 24, 26–559). In World 
Bank high-income countries, the all-age proportion of 
PM2·5-attributable cardiovascular disease deaths decreased 
from 10·0% to 8·1% as a result of reductions in 
cardiovascular mortality and decreasing levels of PM2·5. By 
contrast, in World Bank low-income countries, it increased 
from 13·1% to 13·2%, and in lower-middle-income 
countries from 15·9% to 16·5%, between 1990 and 2015.
Trends in PM2·5-attributable mortality at the global and 
national levels reflect the influence not only of changing 
air quality, but also of demography and underlying 
mortality rates. We calculated the contribution of changes 
in each of four factors—population growth, population 
ageing, age-standardised rates of mortality (IHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, COPD, lung cancer, and LRI), 
and exposure to ambient PM2·5—to the net change in 
mortality attributable to ambient PM2·5 between 1990 and 
2015 globally and for the ten most populous countries 
(appendix pp 22–23). Figure 6 shows the changes in 
mortality attributable to ambient PM2·5 from 1990 to 2015 
according to the contributions of these four factors. Age-
standardised mortality decreased in all ten countries, with 
Nigeria, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the USA 
also experiencing decreases in exposure. These decreases 
were offset by increases in population growth and 
population ageing in most countries. Consequently, net 
increases in attributable mortality were noted in all 
countries except Nigeria and the USA. In China, India, 
Bangladesh, and Japan, increases in exposure combined 
with increases in population growth and ageing resulted 
in net increases in attributable mortality. In Brazil, 
Russia, Indonesia, and Pakistan, despite decreasing 
exposure, population growth (except in the case of Russia) 
and the ageing of the population led to a net increase in 
attributable mortality. In the USA, reductions in exposure 
offset increases in population and ageing, leading to a net 
decrease in attributable burden.

several other countries. When these data were combined 
with PM2·5 exposures estimated globally at fine (0·1 × 0·1°) 
resolution, we were able to estimate subnational burden 
attributable to PM2·5 exposure. In China, where ambient 
PM2·5 contributed to 1·1 million (95% UI 1·0 million 
to 1·8 million) deaths in 2015, the provincial-level 
PM2·5-attributable age-standardised rates varied by more 
than three times, from 132·1 deaths per 100 000 people 
(95% UI 97·6–172·0) in Qinghai to 40·6 deaths per 
100 000 people (30·2–50·4) in Hong Kong. In the USA, 
where ambient PM2·5 contributed to 88 400 (95% UI 
66 800–115 000) deaths in 2015, state-level PM2·5-attributable 
age-standardised death rates also varied by about three 
times, from 27·1 deaths per 100 000 (95% UI 21·2–34·1) 
in Mississippi to 8·1 deaths per 100 000 (5·1–11·7) 
in Hawaii.
Exposure to ozone contributed to 254 000 (95% UI 
97 000–422 000) deaths globally and a loss of 4·1 million 
(1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from COPD in 2015. 
In 2015, ambient ozone was the 34th-ranked risk factor 
for global deaths and 42nd-ranked risk factor for DALYs 
among the 79 risk factors assessed in GBD 2015. 
Exposure to ozone contributed to an estimated 8·0% 
(95% UI 3·0–13.3) of global COPD mortality in 2015, 
with China, India, and the USA experiencing some of the 
highest mortality rates (figure 7A; appendix pp 1079–1362). 
The ozone-attributable COPD mortality rate increased in 
many countries from 1990 to 2015. Global deaths and 
DALYs attributable to ozone exposure increased from 
1990 to 2015, as a result of increases in both levels of 
ozone and COPD mortality (figure 7B; appendix 
pp 1079–1362).
Discussion
In this Article, we present, to our knowledge, the most 
comprehensive assessment so far of the global status 
and trends in the burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution, highlighting the crucial part 
played by broad demographic and epidemiological 
trends. Estimation of spatially resolved trends over a 
25-year period and assessment of the contributions of 
exposure and epidemiological and demographic factors 
to the attributable disease burden provides important 
insights for the development of policies to reduce the 
health effects of air pollution. These estimates are made 
in the context of assessment of burden attributable to 
other risk factors, allowing for direct comparisons and 
priority setting.
We estimated that long-term exposure to ambient 
PM2·5 caused 4·2 million deaths and 103·1 million lost 
years of healthy life in 2015, and exposure to ozone 
caused an additional 254 000 deaths. PM2·5 caused an 
estimated 7·6% of total global mortality in 2015 and was 
the fifth-ranking global mortality risk factor. Although 
global rates of mortality due to PM2·5 exposure decreased

from 1990 to 2015 as a result of improved air quality in 
high-income countries and declining mortality rates for 
cardiovascular diseases, the absolute numbers of 
attributable deaths and DALYs increased as a result of 
increases in pollution and the absolute numbers 
of deaths from non-communicable diseases, especially 
in China and India, where populations are both growing 
and ageing. Household air pollution from the burning 
of solid fuels is also a major cause of mortality in low-
income and middle-income countries, and together 
with ambient air pollution poses a substantial public 
health challenge. 
Absolute numbers of attributable deaths and DALYs 
were higher in GBD 20153 than estimated in GBD 2013.4 
These differences are mainly a result of changes in the 
underlying disease burden estimates3 and to updates to 
the IER (appendix pp 8–14), which estimated higher 
relative risks in 2015 than in 2013 for IHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, LRI, COPD, and lung cancer. 
National-level population-weighted exposure estimates 
also increased between GBD 2013 and GBD 2015 
(appendix pp 2–6). Because of the updated data and 
methods described earlier, we consider the current 
estimates to be more accurate.
Our results assume that the toxicity of ambient PM2·5 
depends only on the magnitude of concentration, but 
not on the source, such as coal burning or vehicular 
emissions, or chemical composition, which vary among 
and within countries.22,23 However, despite substantial 
effort, neither epidemiological nor toxicological research 
has identified particular sources or components that 
uniquely determine the toxicity of the PM2·5 mixture, 
and therefore the evidence does not support the 
development and application of source-specific relative 
risk functions for burden estimation.15,16 This issue 
remains an active area of research and is a source of 
uncertainty in our estimates.
In the past few years, other researchers have estimated 
the burden of disease due to air pollution using different 
data and methods. Recent estimates from WHO24 of 
3·0 million deaths in 2012 used the same exposure 
estimates as presented here, but an earlier (GBD 2013) 
version of the IER and somewhat different baseline 
disease burden estimates. Lelieveld and colleagues25 
analysed source sector contributions to air pollution and 
the resulting disease burden in 2010 and estimated the 
burden in 2050. These estimates used an older (GBD 2010) 
IER. 
Furthermore, 
the 
coarse 
spatial 
resolution 
(~100 × 100 km) of the exposure estimates introduced 
errors via spatial misalignment between exposure and 
population density compared with our estimates.
As in any assessment of this scope, this study has 
limitations. Since the GBD will be regularly updated, we 
anticipate enhancements to the methodology in the 
future to address them. First, we have probably 
underestimated the complete burden of disease 
attributable to air pollution. Although the causes of 
mortality we included make up four of the five leading 
global causes of death in 2015,3 findings from systematic 
reviews in the past 10 years have shown that PM2·5 
exposure is also associated with low birthweight and 
preterm birth,26 asthma,9 and type 2 diabetes.27 Future 
updates of GBD estimates will consider these other 
causes of mortality and morbidity should they meet GBD 
inclusion criteria.
Second, our estimate of the importance of ambient 
PM2·5 assumes that exposure does not affect the 
prevalence of other mortality risk factors. However, if 
long-term exposure to PM2·5 causes high blood pressure, 
then some amount of the PM2·5 burden would be 
mediated by its effect on high blood pressure. Mediation 
analysis was used in GBD 2015 to more accurately 
apportion the burden attributable to other risk factors 
such as diet and high blood pressure, but an absence of 
longitudinal studies precludes such analyses for 
ambient PM2·5.3
Third, because large-scale cohort studies of PM2·5 and 
mortality are absent in the most polluted countries, the 
IERs were developed to estimate the effects of exposure 
at levels above those observed in air pollution cohort 
studies done in the USA, Canada, and western Europe, 
but the magnitude of the excess relative risk from PM2·5 
exposure at high levels of PM2·5 remains uncertain. In 
Chinese cohort studies from the past 5 years, other 
metrics were used, such as total suspended particles 
and PM10,28,29 and findings from a few analyses that 
converted these metrics to PM2·5 suggest that the IERs 
provide reasonable estimates of effects at high levels of 
ambient pollution.12,30
Fourth, although we included estimates of the effect of 
seasonal ozone exposure on COPD mortality, less 
evidence is available for this relationship than that 
linking PM2·5 with COPD or the other causes of mortality. 
However, a causal link between increased COPD 
mortality and long-term exposure to ozone is, in our 
view, supported by a large body of evidence linking ozone 
exposure mortality to adverse effects on the respiratory 
system, including chronic changes in lung structure and 
function in human beings and non-human primates, 
and increased morbidity and mortality from COPD due 
to short-term and long-term exposure, especially in the 
warmer seasons.10,31,32
In conclusion, ambient air pollution contributes 
substantially to the global burden of disease, which 
has increased over the past 25 years, as a result of 
both demographic and epidemiological trends and 
increasing levels of air pollution in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Should these trends continue, 
major reductions in pollution levels will be needed to 
avoid increases in disease burden. Moreover, the non-
linear IERs imply modest reductions in burden in the 
most polluted countries unless PM2·5 concentrations 
decline markedly.3,33,34 As a result, the challenges for 
future reductions in the burden of disease attributable to 
 Articles

1917
air pollution are substantial. For example, using earlier 
attributable burden estimates and future mortality 
predictions, Apte and colleagues33 estimated that air 
pollution levels in 2030 in China would need to decline 
by 29%, and those in India by 20%, to maintain 
per-person mortality at 2010 levels, although the 
economic35 and public health benefits of even 
incremental reductions would probably be substantial in 
view of the large populations affected.34 Exposure to 
ambient air pollution and its associated burden of 
disease can potentially be lowered for entire populations 
via policy action at the national and subnational levels. 
As the experience in the USA suggests,36 changes in 
ambient PM2·5 associated with aggressive air quality 
management programmes, focused on major sources23 
of air pollution including coal combustion, household 
burning of solid fuels, and road transport, can lead to 
increased life expectancy over short timeframes.
