Addiction to cocaine is commonly preceded by experiences with legal or decriminalized drugs, such as alcohol,
nicotine, and marijuana. The biological mechanisms by which these gateway drugs contribute to cocaine addiction
are only beginning to be understood. We report that in the rat, prior alcohol consumption results in enhanced
addiction-like behavior to cocaine, including continued cocaine use despite aversive consequences. Conversely,
prior cocaine use has no effect on alcohol preference. Long-term, but not short-term, alcohol consumption
promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of the nuclear histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the nucleus
accumbens, a brain region critical for reward-based memory. Decreased nuclear HDAC activity results in global
H3 acetylation, creating a permissive environment for cocaine-induced gene expression. We also find that selective
degradation of HDAC4 and HDAC5, facilitated by the class II–specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, enhances compulsive
cocaine self-administration. These results parallel our previously reported findings that the gateway drug nicotine
enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine via HDAC inhibition. Together, our findings suggest a shared mechanism
of action for the gateway drugs alcohol and nicotine, and reveal a novel mechanism by which environmental factors
may alter the epigenetic landscape of the reward system to increase vulnerability to cocaine addiction.
INTRODUCTION
Loss of control over drug use, typified by continued use despite aversive
consequences, is a hallmark characteristic of cocaine addiction (1). The
finding that only a small proportion (~21%) of cocaine users progress
to compulsive use (2) highlights the importance of both genetic and
environmental factors in conferring vulnerability to cocaine addiction.
Prior use of either alcohol or nicotine ranks high among the environmen-
tal factors known to influence subsequent use of cocaine. Thus, in
2015, 91% of cocaine users, 18 to 49 years old, had first used alcohol
before using cocaine and 5.1% had started both drugs at the same age;
85% had first used nicotine, and 5.8% had started both nicotine and
cocaine at the same age (3). These behavioral regularities in drug in-
volvement have given rise to the gateway hypothesis, which proposes
that certain drugs, such as alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana, increase
the risk of subsequently using other drugs, such as cocaine (4). How-
ever, the mechanisms by which these initial drug experiences increase
vulnerability to cocaine use have only recently begun to be under-
stood (5, 6).
Using a sequential drug administration paradigm that models the
stages of drug abuse seen in human populations, we previously found
that mice preexposed to nicotine show an enhanced response to the
rewarding properties of cocaine (5). Nicotine primes the brain to cocaine-
induced changes by modifying chromatin structure and enhancing
cocaine-induced gene expression and long-term synaptic depression
in the striatum. The reverse is not observed: Cocaine has no effect on
nicotine-induced behavior or gene expression, supporting the hypoth-
esis of a unidirectional progression of drug use (5). If the different
gateway drugsoperate through similar biologicalmechanismsin arodent
model, one would predict that alcohol, a gateway drug, would also
potentiate the effects of cocaine. We therefore asked: Does prior al-
cohol use enhance the behavioral effects of cocaine in a rodent model
of addiction and, if so, is the priming process of alcohol mediated by
cellular and molecular mechanisms that are similar to those for nic-
otine? Moreover, is the effect of alcohol on cocaine consumption also
unidirectional, as it is with nicotine?
To study the effectsof alcoholoncocaine-related behaviors, we again
used a sequential drug administration paradigm, with voluntary access
to bothalcoholand cocaine (Fig. 1A). In this paradigm, daily alcoholuse
(10% ethanol, 2 hours per day; see Fig. 1A and table S1) precedes the
start of daily cocaine self-administration by 10 days. Because most
drug users progress to illicit drug use by adding the illicit drug to
their preexisting drug regimen (as opposed to switching) (4), daily
alcohol use is continued throughout the duration of the cocaine self-
administration paradigm. To avoid acute behavioral, metabolic, or
pharmacokinetic interaction between alcohol and cocaine (7–11), we
restricted access to alcohol and cocaine to different time periods during
the dark (wake) cycle (Fig. 1A). We assessed the effect of prior alcohol
exposure on three key indices of cocaine addiction observed in humans:
(i)persistence of drugseekinginthe absenceof reward, (ii)motivationfor
drug use, and (iii) compulsivity. Conversely, we explored the direction-
ality of drug action by reversing the sequence of drug exposure and test-
ing the effect of prior cocaine self-administration on subsequent alcohol
preference. Furthermore, to determine whether alcohol creates a permis-
sive epigenetic environment for cocaine-induced gene expression, we
usedthe same alcoholexposure paradigm(10% alcohol, 2hoursperday)

to 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., respectively, to avoid metabolic interaction between the two drugs. (B) Alcohol self-administration. Animals in the alcohol-primed group
began drinking alcohol on day 1 of the paradigm; animals in the alcohol-concurrent group began drinking on day 11. All groups start cocaine self-administration (0.8 mg/kg per
infusion) on day 11. The average alcohol intake during the alcohol-priming period was 1 g/kg during the first 5 days, increasing to 1.2 g/kg during the second 5 days. Alcohol intake
was similar in the alcohol-primed versus alcohol-concurrent groups from days 11 to 32 [two-way repeated-measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA): Treatment group: F1,12 =

enhances compulsive cocaine self-administration. Successive increases of the footshock intensity resulted in a decrease in lever pressing for all groups. Alcohol pretreated animals

RESULTS
Prior alcohol use does not enhance acquisition or amount of
cocaine self-administration
To distinguish the effects of alcohol preexposure from alcohol co-
exposure, we compared the outcomes of cocaine self-administration
in the alcohol-primed group ( “AP”; Fig. 1A) with two control groups:
(i) an alcohol-naïve (AN) group that drank water instead of alcohol and
(ii) an alcohol-concurrent (AC) group that started using alcohol and co-
caine on the same day. Animals in the AP and AC groups did not differ
in their daily alcohol intake patterns (Fig. 1B). Prior exposure to alcohol
did not increase the daily intake of cocaine during the acquisition or
maintenance phase of the sequential paradigm (fig. S1). Prior exposure
to alcohol did not affect the acquisition rate [duration of time required
to learn to lever press for cocaine injection on a fixed ratio of 5 (FR5)].
We found that the animals learned to lever press on an FR5 schedule
after 5.9, 6.2, and 6.6 days in the alcohol-naïve, alcohol-primed, and
alcohol-concurrent groups, respectively (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the groups
did not differ in the average number of lever presses for cocaine during
a 7-day maintenance phase (Fig. 1D). Overall, our behavioral find-
ings on the effect of prior alcohol use on the early stages of cocaine
self-administration (days 11 to 21; Fig. 1A) are consistent with the
observations of Fredriksson et al. (12). Using a 12-day cocaine self-
administration protocol, they reported no change in acquisition of co-
caine self-administration in animals that had an extensive 7-week
history of prior alcohol use.
Prior alcohol use enhances cocaine addiction–like behaviors
Cocaine addiction is characterized not only by the choice to self-
administer cocaine but also by the complex behaviors that define ad-
diction, such as increased motivation for the drug, persistence of drug
seeking in the absence of reward, and continued drug use despite neg-
ative consequences. To determine whether animals with a history of
prior alcohol use have enhanced cocaine addiction–like behaviors, we
assayed these key behavioral indices using an approach modeled after
Deroche-Gamonet et al. (13) and Belin et al. (14). To examine the per-
sistence of cocaine seeking in the absence of reward, we measured the
number of lever presses during “no drug periods” of daily cocaine self-
administration (two 15-min intervals during which the levers are avail-
able but are not rewarded).Animals in the alcohol-naïve group averaged
18 lever presses during the time-out periods. Animals in the alcohol-
primed group had significantly enhanced persistence in comparison to
alcohol-naïve animals, averaging 58 lever presses. Animals in alcohol-
cocaine concurrent control averaged 38 lever presses during the time-
out period but were not significantly different from the alcohol-naïve
group (Fig. 1E).
We next measured motivation for cocaine self-administration on
a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, where the animal was
required to make increased number of lever presses to earn each sub-
sequent intravenous cocaine reward (0.8 mg/kg per injection), until
it reached the breakpoint where it ceased lever pressing (15). We
found that alcohol-naïve animals worked for cocaine until an average
breakpoint of 310 lever presses, whereas alcohol-primed animals
worked for cocaine until they reached an average breakpoint of 563 lever
presses. Animals in the alcohol-concurrent group had an average
breakpoint of 317 lever presses, similar to the alcohol-naïve group
(Fig. 1F).
One of the core characteristics of drug addiction in humans is com-
pulsivity, as reflected in continued drug use despite negative consequences
(13, 16). Prior studies have found that most rats stop self-administering
cocaine when challengedwithan aversive footshock 20 days afterinitiat-
ing cocaine self-administration (16). But when rats have had long-term
exposure to cocaine (~60 days of daily cocaine self-administration), a
subset of animals continue to seek and take cocaine despite an aversive
footshock (13, 17). We reasoned that exposure to alcohol before cocaine
would reveal a compulsive phenotype that would not otherwise occur in
the absence of priming by alcohol.
To test for compulsive drug use, we introduced an aversive 2-s foot
shock (0.1 to 0.3 mA) to the cocaine self-administration session, with
an increase in shock intensity occurring every 40 min. We found that
animals in the alcohol-naïve and alcohol-concurrent groups declined
similarly, earning 73 and 76% of baseline reward at 0.1 mA, 39 and
31% of baseline reward at 0.2 mA, and 16 and 14% of baseline reward
at 0.3 mA. By contrast, animals preexposed to alcohol were significantly
more resistant to punishment, earning 90, 68, and 29% of baseline
reward at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mA of footshock, respectively (Fig. 1G).
Alcohol is a nonspecific and potent neurotoxin, and could decrease
sensitivity to footshock by decreasing peripheral pain sensitivity or
fear memory. We found, however, that alcohol use did not enhance
compulsive lever pressing for sugar pellets in food-restricted animals
(Fig. 1H). Thus, the priming effects of alcohol on cocaine compulsivity
appear to be mediated by processes that do not generalize to natural
rewards. Together, our results indicate that voluntary alcohol use in-
creases vulnerability to cocaine by enhancing persistence of drug seeking,
motivation, and continued use despite negative consequences.
Prior cocaine use decreases preference for alcohol
To determine whether prior exposure to cocaine enhances alcohol
preference, we reversed the order of drug exposure so that cocaine self-
administration preceded the start of voluntary alcohol use by 10 days
(fig. S2A). Animals in the control group with no prior history of cocaine
showed increasing preference for alcohol in a two-bottle free choice
paradigm, whereas animals with a prior history of cocaine use actually
had decreased alcohol intake and decreased preference for alcohol (fig.
S2, B and C).
When we analyzed the daily alcohol intake of animals in our sequen-
tial alcohol-to-cocaine paradigm (Fig. 1B), we found that animals in
the alcohol-primed group had a transient but significant decline in daily
alcohol intake during the first 2 days of cocaine self-administration,
and after reaching a nadir of alcohol intake, the animals required 4 to
5 days before reaching the prior baseline of daily alcohol intake of 1 to
1.2 g/kg per day (fig. S3). Animals that started alcohol self-administration
concurrently with cocaine use also required 4 to 5 days before reach-
ing a daily alcohol intake of 1 to 1.2 g/kg. This is much slower than
cocaine-naïve animals that began drinking 1 g/kg by the second day
of alcohol use (alcohol-primed group, days 1 to 5). These results suggest
that cocaine use may decrease the preference for alcohol even without a
priming period.
Our findings are consistent with previous reports that prior cocaine
use does not enhance alcohol use in rats (18) and that, in mice, prior co-
caine useresultsin decreasedalcoholpreference (19). Together, ourfind-
ings are consistent with a unidirectional cross-sensitization as predicted
by the gateway hypothesis: from alcohol to cocaine, but not from co-
caine to alcohol.

 Alcohol use creates a permissive epigenetic environment for
cocaine-induced gene expression
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which prior alcohol
use potentiates the behavioral effects of cocaine self-administration, we
examined the epigenetic effects of alcohol use in the nucleus accumbens,
abrain region criticalforaddiction-related learning and memory. In our
previous studies with nicotine, we found that nicotine inhibits histone
deacetylase (HDAC) activity in the striatum. Inhibition of HDAC ac-
tivity resulted in global histone acetylation and a permissive epigenetic
environment for cocaine-induced gene expression (4). To determine
whether alcohol exposure similarly primes the transcriptional response
to cocaine, we allowed animals to drink alcohol for 10 daily 2-hour
sessions and followed this with a single injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) 18 hours after the last alcohol ingestion (Fig. 2A).
Accumulation of the DFOSB protein in the nucleus accumbens has
been found to have a key role in enhancing cocaine self-administration
(20), and is induced by cocaine under voluntary (self-administered)
conditions as well as experimenter-administered conditions (21). We
now asked: Does prior alcohol use enhance the cocaine-induced
transcription of this key marker? We carried out quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific to the DFosB splice variant
and found that alcohol preexposure significantly enhanced cocaine-
induced expression of DFosB in the nucleus accumbens compared to
alcohol-naïve animals that also received an injection of cocaine (Fig. 2B).
To determine whether alcohol facilitates acetylation locally at the
FosB gene locus, we next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) in lysates of the nucleus accumbens of alcohol-treated animals.
A search of the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) revealed
that acetylation of H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) in the first intronic region
of FosB (the gene giving rise to the splice variant DFosB) may be a
key epigenetic regulatory mark for this gene in several tissues, including
brain (fig. S4) (22). We found that alcohol facilitated robust acetylation
of H3K27 residues locally at the FosB gene—fourfold above the (water)
control group (Fig. 2C). Because the level of global H3 acetylation in the
nucleus accumbens has been found to be positively correlated with
motivation for cocaine self-administration in rats [although no such
effect has been observed for H4 acetylation (23)], we next immuno-
blotted total histone lysates and found that alcohol also increased global
acetylation of H3K27 in the nucleus accumbens (Fig. 2D).
Alcohol use promotes decreased nuclear HDAC activity in
the nucleus accumbens
To determine whether the local acetylation at the FosB locus and the
global acetylation in the nucleus accumbens are due to changes in
HDAC activity, we next tested the enzymatic HDAC activity in nuclear
lysates of the nucleus accumbens of animals exposed to 10 days of daily
alcohol use. Prior studies have found that the effects of alcohol on
HDAC activity are dynamic and highly sensitive to both the acute ex-
posure and abstinence stages of alcohol use (24). Therefore, we tested
HDAC activity in nucleus accumbens lysates of animals sacrificed at
sequential time points after the 10th daily 2-hour alcohol session (on
day 10) (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the effects are specific to
long-term alcohol exposure, we performed a similar analysis of nuclear
HDAC activity in the nucleus accumbens of animals after only 2 days of
alcohol exposure (Fig. 3B).
Ten days, but not 2 days, of alcohol use resulted in a significant de-
crease in HDAC activity in comparison to water control (Fig. 3, C and
D). Ten days of alcohol use caused a progressive decrease in HDAC
activity after the end of the alcohol drinking session (Fig. 3E). We
observed no significant change in HDAC activity at the time of acute
alcohol exposure (“time 0,” during which blood alcohol levels were
193 ± 43 mg/ml; see table S1) and a significant decrease in HDAC
activity at time points during which no serum alcohol was detectable
(18 and 22 hours; Fig. 3E and table S1).
In line with this decrease in HDAC activity, we also observed an in-
crease in global H3K27 acetylation in the nucleus accumbens, starting at
12 hours after the last alcohol intake (Fig. 3F). Two days of alcohol use
did not have a significant effect on H3K27 acetylation in the nucleus
accumbens (Fig. 3G). The finding that short-term alcohol use does
not affect HDAC activity or histone acetylation suggests that HDACs
behave quite differently under short-term versus long-term exposure
conditions, fostering a permissive epigenetic environment only after
long-term exposure. Together with the findings observed in our earlier
studies with nicotine, the present findings suggest that HDAC inhibi-
tion, global acetylation in the nucleus accumbens, and specific hypera-
cetylation of key genes in the nucleus accumbens may be general
mechanisms of action for gateway drugs (5).

induced gene expression. (A) Diagram of sequential drug administration paradigm.

 Alcohol use decreases nuclear HDAC4 and HDAC5 levels in
the nucleus accumbens
We next asked: Which specific HDACs are involved in alcohol-induced
acetylation, and how are these inhibited by alcohol? Eleven HDACs
have been identified in mammals. An extensive body of literature has
demonstrated key roles of these enzymes in integrating a diverse array
of molecular responses to stimulants such as cocaine (25, 26). We
focused on the class IIa HDACs HDAC4 and HDAC5 because they
have been previously implicated in regulating the behavioral effects of
cocaine, including cocaine self-administration (23, 27, 28). The class II
HDACs shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus in an activity-
dependent manner (29, 30), and are heavily regulated by post-
translational modifications such as phosphorylation, carbonylation,
SUMOylation, and ubiquitination (31). Although the class II HDACs
carry a mutation in their catalytic domains that render them inactive as
deacetylases (32, 33), genetic and pharmacological knockdown of
class II HDACs causes decreased HDAC activity (34) and global histone
hyperacetylation and enhanced neuronal plasticity (35–37). Class II
HDACs mediate histone acetylation by forming a multiprotein co-
repressorcomplexthatincludestheclassIHDAC,HDAC3(38).HDAC3
is a potent deacetylase. Focal deletion of HDAC3 has been found to en-
hance long-term memory (39) and to facilitate conditioned place pref-
erence to cocaine (40). The catalytically inactive C terminus of HDAC4
is crucial for the recruitment and deacetylase activity of the multiprotein
complex, which forms only in the nucleus of the cell. Thus, class II
HDACs may function as activity-dependent scaffolds that target

 the co-repressor complex to specific promoters (38). HDAC4 has
been found to be critical for activity-dependent regulation of H3K27
deacetylation in specific gene promoter regions such as BDNF (brain-
derived neurotrophic factor) (41).
Wefirstasked:DoeseitherHDAC4orHDAC5interactwiththe FosB
gene locus? To address this question, we performed ChIP experiments
in the rat striatum with antibodies against HDAC4 and HDAC5 and
found that HDAC4, but not HDAC5, interacted with the FosB locus
(fig. S5A). This finding is consistent with that of Wang et al. (23),
who reported that overexpression of HDAC4 in the nucleus accumbens
resulted in a decreased expression of FosB. Having found that HDAC4
is present at the FosB gene locus, we next examined the specific regula-
tion of HDAC4 by asking whether alcohol regulates acetylation at the
FosB promoter by altering the subcellular localization of HDAC4 in
the nucleus accumbens. Another class IIa HDAC, HDAC5, limits co-
caine reward by shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following
acute exposure to cocaine (28). Although purified class II HDACs have
weak deacetylase activity (32), Fischle et al. (38) found that, in vivo,
nuclear HDAC4 (but not cytoplasmic HDAC4) exists in an enzymat-
ically active multiprotein complex. To explore the effects of alcohol
use on subcellular localization of HDAC4, we performed immuno-
histochemistry on striatalslices of animals exposedto alcoholfor 10days
(fig. S5, B and C). We found that an acute exposure to alcohol (time 0)
did not result in a significant change in HDAC4 subcellular localization
compared to control animals. The HDAC4 stain completely and pre-
cisely overlaid the nuclear stain in 81% of nucleus accumbens cells in
both the water control group and the acutely exposed alcohol group
(time 0). By contrast, 18 hours after the last alcohol exposure on day 10
(when blood alcohol was not detectable; table S1), a significantly lower
number of cells had HDAC4-positive nuclei, suggesting that HDAC4
accumulated less in the nucleus during the alcohol abstinence interval
(fig. S5, B and C).
We next immunoblotted for HDAC4 in nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions of nucleus accumbens cells from animals sacrificed at four
successive time points after the last alcohol ingestion (0, 12, 18, and
22 hours). Similar to immunohistochemical stains, we found that
acute alcohol exposure (time 0) did not lead to a change in the nuclear
accumulation of HDAC4, whereas the lack of alcohol resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in the nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 at 18 and
22 hours after the last alcohol ingestion (Fig. 4A). In parallel, we also
performed immunoblotting studies of HDAC5 following a 10-day
alcohol exposure, which revealed a similar decrease in nuclear accumu-
lation 18 hours after the last alcohol ingestion (fig. S6B). Although
HDAC4 may be a specific regulator of FosB, it is possible that other
HDACs may be involved and may account for the changes that we ob-
served in nuclear HDAC activity and global histone acetylation.
Decrease of nuclear HDAC4 is facilitated by
proteasome-mediated degradation
Surprisingly, we found that alcohol-induced decrease of nuclear
HDAC4 accumulation was not paralleled by a comparable increased
accumulation in the cytoplasmic compartment, as might be expected
for an enzyme that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm
(Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, quantitative analysis of HDAC4 mRNA
revealed no change at the level of transcription in response to alcohol
exposure (Fig. 4C). These findings suggested that the observed decrease
in nuclear HDAC accumulation might be due to the degradation in the
nucleus, not to shuttling to the cytoplasm. Studies by Potthoff et al. (42)
have demonstrated that the activity-dependent differentiation of
mature skeletal muscle is mediated by selective proteasomal degrada-
tion of class IIa HDACs in the nucleus of muscle fibers. To test for this
possibility, we placed in-dwelling cannulae into the nucleus accumbens
of rats bilaterally and allowed the animals to drink either alcohol or
water for 10 days. Twelve hours after the last exposure to alcohol, we
injected a covalent inhibitor of the proteasome in one hemisphere
[one-time injection of 200 mM lactacystin, 0.4 ml into the nucleus ac-
cumbens, as described by Massaly et al. (43)] and injected dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle in the contralateral, control hemisphere.
Lactacystin rescued the decrease in nuclear HDAC activity (Fig. 4D)
and kept nuclear HDAC4 and HDAC5 protein levels at control levels,
with no change in the vehicle-treated contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 4E
and fig. S6B). Lactacystin infusion did not affect HDAC4 or HDAC5
accumulation in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the degradation of these
HDACs is occurring in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 4F and fig. S6C).
Proteasome-mediated degradation of HDAC4 in the nuclear com-
partment has been found to mediate growth factor–induced cell mo-
tility (44) and activity-dependent striatal muscle differentiation (42).
Our findings therefore suggest that, in addition to the well-described
phosphorylation-dependent shuttling of the class II HDAC (28),
other posttranslational modifications, such as SUMOylation (45)
and ubiquitinization (44), may have key mechanistic roles in the way
in which class II HDACs regulate vulnerability to drug addiction. More-
over, these data suggest that the class II HDACs, HDAC4 and HDAC5
may act as nodal regulators, integrating environmental stimuli (alcohol
use) with behavioral response (potentiated reward-based learning, re-
sulting in addiction-like behavior).
MC1568 promotes selective degradation of class II HDAC in
the nucleus accumbens and enhances compulsivity for
cocaine self-administration
To determine directly whether nuclear degradation of HDAC4 and
HDAC5 causes an increase in addiction-like behavior, similar to the
behaviors induced by alcohol (Fig. 1), we treated animals to the class
II–specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568 (46, 47). MC1568 selectively inhib-
its class II HDAC activity by promoting nuclear import and proteasome-
mediated degradation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the nucleus of the cell
(48). Several other HDAC inhibitors, including suberoylanilide hydrox-
amic acid, valproic acid, and quinidine, have been found to inhibit
HDAC activity by promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of
HDAC4, HDAC2, and HDAC1, respectively (48–50). Systemic admin-
istration of MC1568 is well tolerated by mice, and crosses the blood-
brain barrier, at doses of up to 6.5 mg/kg (51). In addition, MC1568
promotes global H3 hyperacetylation and enhances neurite outgrowth
in dopaminergic and sympathetic neurons in vitro (37).
Although the effects of MC1568 on class II HDACs have been well
characterized in cancerous and noncancerous tissue (34, 46, 48), the
effects of this drug on HDAC4 and HDAC5 have not been described
in the nucleus accumbens in vivo. Thus, we first characterized the effects
of MC1568 in the nucleus accumbens. We treated animals to 10 daily
injections of MC1568 (0.5 mg/kg) and tested for nuclear HDAC activity
in the nucleus accumbens 18 hours after the last treatment. We found
that MC1568 causes a 35% decrease in nuclear HDAC activity (Fig. 5B).
To determine whether MC1568 selectively decreases class II HDACs,
we immunoblotted nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the nucleus ac-
cumbens cells for class II HDACs, HDAC4 and HDAC5, and for class I
HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2. We found that 10 days of daily expo-
sure to MC1568 caused a significant decrease in nuclear HDAC4 and
HDAC5 in the nucleus accumbens, with no significant change in

 HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Fig. 5C). We also observed no changes in the
cytoplasmic accumulation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 (Fig. 5D). These
findings are consistent with previous studies showing that MC1568-
mediated inhibition of class II HDACs is facilitated by the degradation
of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the nucleus (48, 52).
To explore the effect of selective degradation of HDAC4 and
HDAC5 on cocaine addiction–like behaviors, we administered MC1568
(0.5 mg/kg), or vehicle, daily for 10 consecutive days before cocaine self-
administration (Fig. 5A). Drug treatments were continued concurrently
with cocaine self-administration but administered at a different time
during the dark cycle (Fig. 5A). Treatment with MC1568 did not in-
crease the daily intake of cocaine during the acquisition or maintenance
phase of the sequential paradigm (fig. S7). We tested motivation for
cocaine on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, at three co-
caine doses (0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/kg), on days 15, 17, and 19 of cocaine
self-administration, respectively. As expected, animals had fewer
cumulative lever presses for cocaine with each successive decrease in
cocaine concentration (23). Animals treated with the selective class
II HDAC inhibitor, however, had significantly higher motivation for
cocaine at a unit dose of 0.4 mg/kg and no significant difference in mo-
tivation at the lowest unit dose of 0.2 mg/kg (Fig. 5E). We measured
persistence of cocaine seeking in the absence of the drug and found that
animals exposed to MC1568 had significantly higher persistence than
the control group (Fig. 5F).

 To determine whether selective degradation of class II HDACs en-
hances compulsivity of cocaine use, we used the variable shock paradigm
described in Fig. 1, where we introduced an aversive 2-s footshock to
the standard self-administration session, with an increase in shock
intensity occurring every 40 min. Under mild aversive condition (0.1 mA
of footshock), control and MC1568-treated animals did not differ,
earning 83% of baseline reward. However, at 0.2 mA of punishment,
the MC1568 group earned almost twice as much reward (65% versus
37% of baseline for drug-treated and vehicle, respectively); at 0.3 mA of
footshock, the control animals earned no drug reward, whereas the
MC1568 group earned 35% of baseline reward (Fig. 5G). We found that
MC1568 did not enhance resistance to punishment in food-restricted
animals pressing for sugar pellets (Fig. 5H). These data indicate that
MC1568 does not disrupt fear circuits involved in decision-making,
and suggest that, like alcohol, the priming effect induced by the selec-
tive HDAC inhibitor does not generalize to natural rewards. Together,
these findings further substantiate our observationthat the degradation
of HDAC4 and HDAC5 increases vulnerability to cocaine addiction–
like behaviors.
DISCUSSION
Several risk factors for cocaine addiction have been identified. These in-
clude endogenous (presumably genetic) factors (such as trait impulsiv-
ity and novelty seeking), exogenous (environmental) factors (such as
prior use and dependence on nicotine, alcohol, or marijuana), and psy-
chiatric disorders (such as lifetime personality disorder or attention
deficit hyperactive disorder). Controlling for multiple predictors, alcohol
dependence, together with mood disorder, is second in importance—
after cannabis dependence—as predictors of cocaine dependence (2).
Although many rodent studies have tested cross-sensitization between
different drug classes, the significance of these studies to drug addiction
vulnerability is often confounded by behavioral models that focus on
the early stages of drug experimentation rather than on addiction. Here,
we have used a rodent model of compulsive cocaine use to test, on both
a behavioral and molecular level, the epidemiological hypothesis that
alcohol acts as a gateway drug to enhance cocaine addiction, and wheth-
er the priming effect is unidirectional or bidirectional.
Our data indicate that animals with a history of alcohol use have
increased vulnerability to developing key indices of cocaine addiction
found in humans: motivation for cocaine and continued cocaine use
despite aversive consequence. The reverse is not true: Cocaine use does
not enhance preference for alcohol. Our results are not completely in
accord with epidemiological evidence that, in humans, prior use of al-
cohol is a significant risk factor for subsequent use of cocaine, and
not only the addictive phenotypes (4). However they are consistent with
epidemiological evidence that alcohol use is a significant risk factor for
the transition from cocaine use to cocaine dependence (2).
Although the synergistic effects of simultaneous alcohol and cocaine
use have been well documented in human (10) and rodent studies (8),
our results indicate that alcohol use can enhance the addictive proper-
ties of cocaine independently of metabolic, pharmacokinetic, or acute
behavioral interaction of the two drugs. Our findings indicate that a
prior history of alcohol use is required for the enhancement of cocaine
addiction–like behavior, and that priming by alcohol is a metaplastic
effect, whereby exposure to this gateway drug initiates intracellular
events that alter the epigenome, creating a permissive environment
for cocaine-induced learning and memory, thereby enhancing the
addictive potential of cocaine. Cocaine can still be addictive without
prior alcohol exposure, although in human populations, as noted in
the introduction, very few individuals initiate cocaine use without
prior use of alcohol or tobacco.
Moreover, our findings suggest that the two gateway drugs, alcohol
and nicotine, act through similar molecular mechanisms to increase
vulnerability to cocaine. Both drugs inhibit nuclear HDAC activity,
resulting in increased histone acetylation in the nucleus accumbens and
the creation of a permissive environment for cocaine-induced DFosB
expression, and likely other genes. We have now also obtained the first
insights into the mechanism of this inhibition: HDAC inhibition and
the subsequent histone acetylation are promoted by proteasome-
mediated degradation of HDAC4 and HDAC5. The finding that
HDAC inhibition does not occur after short-term exposure to alcohol
may explain why individuals who drink more rarely and then use co-
caine do not go on to meet the criteria for cocaine dependence.
The repressive properties of class II HDACs on drug-related plastic-
ity and behavior have been well described: HDAC5 overexpression in
the nucleus accumbens has been found to inhibit cocaine reward in a
conditioned place preference paradigm (53), whereas overexpression of
HDAC4 in the nucleus accumbens inhibits conditioned place prefer-
ence and motivation for cocaine self-administration (23, 27). It has been
suggested that processes that alter these “brakes” on cocaine-induced
gene regulation may tip the balance from recreational to addictive drug
use (28). Upon entering the nucleus, HDAC4 forms a multiprotein
complex with SMART/n-COR and HDAC3. This complex has been
proposed to form a “molecular break pad” on molecular events
conferring learning; therefore, removal of essential components of the
complex represents a critical step to the formation of persistent mem-
ories (54). Here, we present evidence that a history of alcohol use—an
environmental risk factor strongly associated with subsequent illicit
drug use in the population—increases vulnerability to cocaine addiction–
like behavior in rodents by promoting proteasome-mediated degra-
dation of nuclear HDAC4 and HDAC5. It will therefore be of interest
to determine whether other drugs, such as marijuana, also act via nu-
clear HDAC regulation.
HDAC4 acts as a fulcrum between opposing processes in many
tissues: differentiation versus apoptosis, and cell growth and motility
versus cell cycle arrest (31). Not surprisingly, HDAC4 is heavily regu-
lated by posttranslational modifications. Our finding of markedly dif-
ferent nuclear accumulation profiles of HDAC4 following short-term
versus long-term alcohol use isconsistent withthe centralrole of HDAC4
as a biological switch for vastly different neuronal outcomes. It will be
important to determine which posttranslational modifications and
upstream modifying agents (that is, E3 ligases) mediate these changes
in the nucleus accumbens.
Ourresultshighlightakey role forHDAC4andHDAC5inincreasing
vulnerability to cocaine addiction. However, because we tested the link
between HDAC4 and cocaine compulsivity using systemic administra-
tion of the selective class II HDAC inhibitor, we cannot rule out the
possibility that brain regions other than the nucleus accumbens may
also be affected by MC1568, acting to facilitate the addictive phenotype.
Cocaine-induced changes in the dorsal striatum and the prefrontal cortex
have both been found to play a key role in the transition to addiction-
like behavior (55).
Together, our findings indicate that alcohol consumption increases
vulnerability to compulsive cocaine use by promoting proteasome-
mediateddegradationofHDAC4andHDAC5inthenucleusaccumbens.
This degradation results in increased histone acetylation and creates a
permissive epigenetic environment for cocaine-induced gene expression.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Sprague-Dawley rats (8 to 12 weeks, weighing 280 to 300 g at the
beginning of experiments) (Taconic Laboratories) were used for all
studies. Rats were single-housed on a reverse light/dark schedule (10 a.m.
lights off, 10 p.m. lights on). All experiments were conducted during the
dark cycle and in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Drugs
Cocaine HCl (provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse) was
dissolved in 0.9% NaCl to a concentration of 5 mg/ml and filtered
through 0.2-mm filters. Lactacystin (Sigma) was dissolved in 2%
DMSO to a final concentration of 200 mM, as described by Massaly
et al. (43). MC1568 (ApexBio) was dissolved in sterile saline/0.3%
Tween/5% DMSO.
Alcohol
Animals were acclimated to ad libitum water access in 100-ml
graduated feeding tubes (Dyets) for 4 days before initiation of alcohol
treatment protocol. Alcohol treatments occurred each day, 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
(approximately 5 hours after the start of the dark cycle). We used a
one-bottle, limited alcohol access paradigm, to obtain stable alcohol
intake between animals, with fast acquisition of alcohol drinking. In
the one-bottle paradigm, animals voluntarily drink from one bottle of
10% alcohol in their home cages, approximately 5 hours into the dark
cycle. Animals were water-restricted for 18 to 24 hours before the first
day of alcohol exposure to stimulate drinking. In all experiments, an
overnight water bottle was left with the animal after the 2-hour alcohol
treatment, to be removed the next morning at approximately 10:30 a.m.
No liquids of any kind were given to animals between the hours of
10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. to control for the animals that undergo behavioral
studies and do not drink during this time period due to cocaine self-
administration (11 a.m. to 2 p.m.).
Sequential paradigm
Serum alcohol, cocaine, and cocaethylene levels in the sequential drug
administration paradigm: When taken simultaneously, alcohol and
cocaine can have synergistic effects: (i) Alcohol ameliorates the anxio-
genic effects of cocaine, resulting in higher quantities of cocaine use dur-
ing coadministration (7, 8); (ii) alcohol and cocaine form a metabolic
by-product in the liver, cocaethylene, which by itself is euphorigenic
(9, 10); and (iii) alcohol can inhibit cocaine metabolism, resulting in
higher serum cocaine concentrations (9, 11). Access to the two drugs
was therefore restricted to different times during the dark cycle, thereby
limiting behavioral, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic interaction.
General behavioral methods
Catheter surgery
Underketamine(75to95mg/kgintraperitoneally)andxylazine(5mg/kg
intraperitoneally) anesthesia, the rat was prepared for surgery by
shaving the hair at the surgery site and prepping the skin with a three
times alternating scrub of dilute betadine and alcohol. A 2.5-cm incision
was made through the skin on the dorsal surface, 0.5 cm posterior to the
midscapular level and perpendicular to the rostral-caudal axis of the rat.
Another 2.5-cm incision was made ventrally on the area of the neck
overlying the right jugular vein parallel to the rostral-caudal axis. The
distalendof the catheter(Camcaths)was threadedsubcutaneously from
the dorsal incision to the ventral incision, and the tip of the catheter was
inserted into the right jugular vein and tied with suture. Animals received
carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously for analgesia at the end of surgery
and for 7 days after surgery. Animals received gentamicin (5 mg/kg) sub-
cutaneously for 7 days after surgery. All animals were allowed to recover
5 to 7 days before initiation of cocaine self-administration. The catheter
was flushed daily with 0.1 ml of heparinized saline immediately before
and after each self-administration session.
Self-administration apparatus
Cocaine self-administration studies were performed in Med Associates
Operant Chambers (St. Albans, VT), equipped with two retractable
levers (active and inactive) located 8 cm above the floor. A cue light
was placed above each lever, and a house light was placed on the back
wall.Chamberswerealsoequippedwithametalfloorattachedtoashock
generator. All test chambers were housed in sound-attenuating cham-
bers. The operant chambers were controlled using MED-PC software.
Acquisition of lever pressing
Food restriction. Rats were placed on a food-restricted diet immedi-
ately before (1 day) and during lever press training. Rats were fed a
restricted amount of food (20 g of chow per day) each day of lever press
training. Rats were weighed each day, and their weights were recorded
to ensure that no rat drops below 85% of their ad libitum feeding weight.
Animals are returned to ad libitum diet after lever press training and
before alcohol or cocaine self-administration studies.
Lever press training. Lever pressing wasshapedin daily 1-hoursessions
(11 a.m. to 12 p.m.), under an FR1, which resulted in the delivery of a
sucrose pellet (Dyets) and illumination of a cue light directly over the
lever. Sugar pellet delivery resulted in retraction of active and inactive
lever, a 20-s time-out period. Animals were trained on the FR1 schedule
until they earned more than 50 sugar pellets during the 1-hour session
(1 to 3 days).
Acquisition and maintenance of cocaine self-administration
The self-administration session (2.5 hours) was composed of three drug
components (40 min each) punctuated by two 15-min time-out (no
drug) periods. Drug sessions were signaled by illumination of the
house light and insertion of two levers, active and inactive. “No drug”
periods were signaled by house light turning off. During the no drug
periods, levers remained extended, but lever presses had no conse-
quence. During the drug period, one lever press turned on the cue
light located above it and then, 1 s later, switches on the infusion pump.
The cue light remains on for a totalof 4 s. The infusion volume was40 ml
(2-s infusion) and contained cocaine (0.8 mg/kg). Each infusion was
followed by a 20 s time-out period. Training began with FR1 (one lever
press results in an infusion of cocaine). Animals remained on FR1 for
2 to 4 days, followed by FR3 (1 to 3 days), and then FR5. Animals
were graduated from one fixed ratio to the next if they earned more
than 30 infusions per day. Animals were maintained on an FR5 sched-
ule for the duration of the experiment, 7 days per week, and interrupted
only for behavioral testing (progressive ratio and compulsivity; Fig. 1A).
All animals were given one to two sessions to re-baseline after a testing
procedure before proceeding to another test.
Progressive ratio schedule
After 7 days of stable maintenance cocaine self-administration, animals
were tested on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. The num-
ber of lever presses required for a cocaine infusion was increased after
each infusion according to the following progression: 10, 20, 30, 45, 65,
85, 115, 145, 185, 225, 275, 325, 385, 445, 515, 585, 665, 745, 835, 925,
1025, 1125, 1235, 1345, 1465, and 1585. The cumulative number of lever
presses that the rat performs before it ceases lever pressing is referred to
as the breaking point. The session was ended after 3 hours or when a
period of 30 min elapsed after the previously earned infusion.

 Persistence of lever pressing in the absence of reward
Persistence of lever pressing during the two 15-min time-out sessions
wasaveragedover the last 3daysof the maintenance period(days22, 23,
and 24 of sequential paradigm).
Resistance to punishment: Cocaine
Resistance to punishment was tested after 20 days of stable cocaine
self-administration. This test of compulsivity consisted of four 40-min
drug sessions, each separated by a 15-min time-out period. The first
40 min session proceeded as a maintenance FR5 session. During the
second 40-min drug session, the first lever press of the FR5 sequence
activated a blue warning light that remained on for 60 s. The fourth
lever press in the FR5 sequence resulted in a footshock of 0.1 mA for
2 s, whereas the fifth lever press resulted in the delivery of a drug
injection (0.4 mg/kg), followed by retraction of levers. After the first
lever press, an animal had 60 s to finish the FR5 sequence; failure to
do so caused the blue warning light to turn off, and the lever count to
reset back to 0. The third and fourth 40-min sessions proceeded as
the second, with the intensity of the footshock increasing to 0.2 and
0.3 mA, respectively.
Resistance to punishment: Sucrose pellets
Animals were acclimated to a restricted food schedule (free access to
food from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.) for 3 days before initiation of lever pressing
for natural reward. Lever pressing was shaped on an FR1 as described
above. Following acquisition of lever pressing, animals underwent
maintenance lever pressing for sucrose pellets on an FR1 schedule
of reinforcement using a 75-min paradigm composed of three sucrose
access intervals, 20 min each, separated by two 7.5-min “time-out”
periods. The schedule of reinforcement was increased over 7 days to
FR5. Testing for compulsivity occurred similar to cocaine compulsivity
tests: The first 20-min session was unpunished, during the second
20-min session, the first lever press of the FR5 sequence activated a
blue warning light that remained on for 60 s. The fourth lever press
in the FR5 sequence resulted in a footshock of 0.1 mA for 2 s. The third
and fourth sucrose access session proceeded as the second, with the
intensity of the footshock increasing to 0.2 and 0.3 mA, respectively.
mRNA expression by qRT-PCR
RNA preparation and complementary DNA synthesis
Following water, alcohol, and/or cocaine treatment, animals were sacri-
ficed and brains were flash-frozen in isopentane. Nucleus accumbens
punches (1 mm diameter) were obtained, and RNA was extracted using
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) with the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep,
as instructed by the manufacturer (Zymo Research). RNA was treated
with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) before complementary DNA
synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit, as
instructed (Invitrogen).
Primers
Rat PCR primers were ordered from Sigma. The following primers
were used: HDAC5, 5′-TTCTTCAACTCCGTAGCC-3′ (forward) and
5′-TCCCATTGTCGTAGCG-3′ (reverse); HDAC4, 5′-TGAGAGAC-
GGAGCAGCCCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTGCTACATGCG-
GAGT-3′ (reverse) (the annealing temperature used was 60°C); and
DFosB, 5′-AGGCAGAGCTGGAGTCGGAGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-
GCCGAGGACTTGAACTTCACTCG-3′ (reverse). The housekeeping
gene used was rat GAPDH (forward, 5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACG-
GATTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′).
Samples were run in triplicates using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR
Master Mix (Bio-Rad) on the Chromo4 Real-Time PCR Detection Sys-
tem (Bio-Rad).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP experiments were performed to study histone modifications (HM
ChIP) and DNAinteractions with HDACChIP at the FosB gene using a
ChIP assay kit (EMD Millipore). Briefly, for HM ChIP, nucleus accum-
bens punches were homogenized and cross-linked for 10 min at room
temperature in the presence of 1% formaldehyde. The cross-linking re-
action was quenched with an excess presence of glycine. Following
washes, the cell pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer and sonicated
to shear the DNA to approximately 1000 base pairs (bp). The sonicated
cell supernatant was diluted, precleared with protein A agarose/salmon
sperm DNA beads, and then incubated overnight at 4°C in the presence
of 5 mg of an anti-H3K27 acetylation antibody (Active Motif, #39133).
The antibody/histone complex was collected with protein A agarose/
salmon sperm DNA beads and washed five times according to the
assay’s protocol. The histone complex was then eluted from the anti-
body, histone-DNA cross-links were reversed overnight, and the eluate
wastreatedwith proteinase K. DNAwas recovered using the Chromatin
IP DNA Purification Kit (Active Motif), and the samples were analyzed
in triplicates using qRT-PCR as previously described. Data were
calculated as % input [100*2^(Adjusted input − Ct (IP)] and were then
transformed to fold change differences relative to the water group.
The primer pair used was targeting the first intron of the rat FosB
gene to capture the region showing elevated H3K27 acetylation levels
based on ENCODE’s mouse data (forward, 5′-ACGACGACCTT-
CAATTCCCC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTCTTGTCAGGATCCGGCG-3′)
(see fig. S4). Forthe HDACChIPanalyses, the same procedure wasused
as before with the following exceptions: Dorsal striatal punches (n = 8)
were homogenized and dual cross-linked with 5 mM disuccinimidyl
glutarate for 1 hour, followed by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room
temperature. Samples were sonicated to approximately 1000 bp, pooled,
and divided equally into four samples that were incubated with 5 mg
of either one of the following antibodies: HDAC4 (Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, sc-11418 X), HDAC5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-
133106), rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Cell Signaling Technology,
27295), and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2025). Both
HDAC antibodies were first confirmed to work in IP experiments to
not cross-react with each other. The eluted DNA was analyzed using
qRT-PCR using the same primers that capture the first intron of FosB,
which is the region showing elevated H3K27 acetylation levels. Be-
cause only the HDAC4 and input samples gave a detectable signal
(Ct values for HDAC5 and both IgGs were undetectable), the data
were visualized by running the samples on a 1% agarose gel.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting
Nucleus accumbens punches were processed using the NE-PER Nucle-
ar and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to extract
a cytoplasmic fraction and a nuclear fraction. The protocol was modi-
fied to also obtain a separate histone fraction: Following extraction of
the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, the pellet was resuspended in nu-
clear extraction reagent and incubated with 300 U of micrococcal nu-
clease, in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, for 15 min at 37°C. To confirm
efficient subcellular fractionation, Western/immunoblotting experi-
ment was performed for proteins known to be present in all fractions
(HDAC4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11418), present in the cyto-
plasm (mitochondrial HSP60; Abcam, ab45134), present in the nucleus
and cytoplasm (b-actin; Abcam, ab6276), and present in the histone
fraction (histone H3; Abcam, ab10799). The results of the subcellular
fractionation experiment are presented in fig. S8. For all Western
blotting experiments, equal amounts of nuclear, cytoplasmic, or histone

 extracts were run on 4 to 20% gradient TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad),
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immuno-
blotted with the antibodies of interest: acetyl-H3K27 (Active Motif,
#39133), HDAC1 (Abcam, ab7028), HDAC2 (Abcam, ab12169),
HDAC4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11418), and HDAC5 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, sc-133106). Total H3 (Abcam, ab10799) was used
as loading control for the histone fractions, and b-actin (Abcam,
ab6276) was used as loading control for the nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions.
HDAC activity assays
HDAC activity was measured using the Epigenase HDAC Activity
Assay, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (EpiGentek).
Immunohistochemistry
Perfusion and brain slicing
Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) after being anesthetized with ketamine. Anterior
to posterior coronal slices at 40 mm were obtained approximately be-
tween bregma 2.7 mm and 1.7 mm in frontal regions of the brain that
are within the span of the nucleus accumbens. Brain slices are then
suspended in a mixture of 30% glycerol and 30% ethylene glycol in
0.1 M tris buffer at pH 7.4 and stored at −20°C.
Immunohistochemistry
Brain slices were permeated with 1% Tween in PBS and blocked with
0.5% Tween and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Slices were incubated
with polyclonal HDAC4 primary antibody (Abcam, ab1437), anti-
rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (Invitrogen), and a nuclear
stain Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slices were mounted
on Superfrost Plus Micro Slides (VWR) with Vectashield HardSet
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The nucleus accumbens
regions of these slices were visualized by confocal microscopy. The
localization of HDAC4 was categorized as predominantly nuclear or
both nuclear and cytoplasmic for each visible in situ neuron under
experimenter-blind conditions.
Intracranial surgery and microinfusion
Stereotactic surgery
Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail and
head-fixed in a stereotactic device. The incision site was first cleaned
with betadine scrub, and ophthalmic ointment was placed on the eyes.
An incision was made along the midline to expose the skull. Bilateral
holes were drilled above the nucleus accumbens to allow insertion of
26-gauge cannulae 1 mm dorsal to the nucleus accumbens (anterior-
posterior, +1.6; medial-lateral, ± 1.2; dorsal-ventral, −6.5). Surgical
screws were implanted in the skull to aid the dental cement in securing
both cannulae in place. Animals were given carprofen (5 mg/kg) post-
operatively and allowed to recover for 3 to 5 days.
Microinfusion
Following the 10-day alcohol regimen, animals received infusions of the
proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Twelve to 15 hours after the last expo-
sure to alcohol, 33-gauge microinjectors were inserted into the guide
cannulae with 1 mm projection to deliver either lactacystin (200 mM)
or vehicle (2% DMSO in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) to each side of the
nucleus accumbens. Pharmacological agents (0.4 ml per hemisphere)
were infused at a rate of 0.4 ml/min. Microinjectors were kept in place
to allow diffusion of the drug for 10 min before retracting the microin-
jectors. Six hours later, animals were euthanized and brains were
prepared for tissue extraction.
Statistical analyses
For behavioral analyses with more than one time point, group compar-
isons were performed using RM ANOVA, followed by Tukey or Sidak
post hoc tests. For all remaining comparisons, Student’s t test was used
tocomparealcohol-treatedgroupstotheuntreated(water)controlgroup.
Student’s t test was also used to compare the alcohol + DMSO group
with the water and the alcohol + lactacystin groups, respectively.
Potential outliers were excluded from the statistical analyses. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, and a P value of
less than 0.05 was considered significant.
