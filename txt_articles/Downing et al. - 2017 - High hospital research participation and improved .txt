ABSTRACT
Objective In 2001, the National Institute for Health
Research Cancer Research Network (NCRN) was
established, leading to a rapid increase in clinical
research activity across the English NHS. Using colorectal
cancer (CRC) as an example, we test the hypothesis that
high, sustained hospital-level participation in
interventional clinical trials improves outcomes for all
patients with CRC managed in those research-intensive
hospitals.
Design Data for patients diagnosed with CRC in
England in 2001–2008 (n=209 968) were linked with
data on accrual to NCRN CRC studies (n=30 998).
Hospital Trusts were categorised by the proportion of
patients accrued to interventional studies annually.
Multivariable models investigated the relationship
between 30-day postoperative mortality and 5-year
survival and the level and duration of study participation.
Results Most of the Trusts achieving high participation
were district general hospitals and the effects were not
limited to cancer ‘centres of excellence’, although such
centres do make substantial contributions. Patients
treated in Trusts with high research participation (≥16%)
in their year of diagnosis had lower postoperative
mortality (p<0.001) and improved survival (p<0.001)
after adjustment for casemix and hospital-level variables.
The effects increased with sustained research
participation, with a reduction in postoperative mortality
of 1.5% (6.5%–5%, p<2.2×10−6) and an improvement
in survival (p<10−19; 5-year difference: 3.8% (41.0%–
44.8%)) comparing high participation for ≥4 years with
0 years.
Conclusions There is a strong independent association
between survival and participation in interventional
clinical studies for all patients with CRC treated in the
hospital study participants. Improvement precedes and
increases with the level and years of sustained
participation.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical research provides evidence to improve the
care of patients in the future. It has also been
asserted that patients who participate in clinical
research may achieve better outcomes as a result,
regardless of whether they are allocated novel or
standard
treatment
and
whether
the
trial
subsequently delivers a positive result.1 2 However,
unquantifiable
prognostic
differences
between
patients who are or are not offered research, and
do or do not consent to participate, have to date
made this claim impossible to substantiate.3–5
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Only a few studies have investigated whether a
hospital’s research activity for a specific disease
is associated with better survival for all of their
patients with that disease.
▸ Disease-specific studies in coronary artery
disease and ovarian cancer suggested improved
survival for patients treated at the more
research-active hospitals.
▸ Using colorectal cancer (CRC) as an example, in
>200 000 patients we test the hypothesis that
high, sustained hospital-level participation in
interventional clinical trials improves outcomes
for all patients with CRC managed in those
research-intensive hospitals.
▸ The ‘big dataset’ allows us to explore the
possible causal link.
What are the new findings?
▸ Patients treated in hospitals with high rates of
research participation (≥16%) in their year of
diagnosis had lower postoperative mortality
(p<0.001) and improved 5-year survival
(p<0.001) after adjustment for casemix and
hospital-level variables.
▸ The effects increased with sustained
participation in research, with a reduction in
postoperative mortality of 1.5% (6.5%–5%,
p<10−6) and an improvement in 5-year survival
of 3.8% (41.0%–44.8%, p<10−19) comparing
high participation for ≥4 years with 0 years
participation.
▸ Improvement precedes and increases with the
level and years of sustained participation.
▸ The effects are seen across all NHS hospitals
that care for patients with colorectal cancer
and is not restricted to academic centres or
hospitals with large practices.

 A related but different question, more feasible to address, is
whether the level of clinical research activity within a hospital
or multidisciplinary team (MDT) correlates with the outcomes
of all patients treated by that hospital or MDT
.2 6–8 If such a
correlation exists, such research activity could simply be a non-
causative surrogate marker of an institution’s quality. On the
other hand, can commitment to research participation, espe-
cially the uptake of research in previously research-inactive
teams, itself drive improvements in care? The processes of
adopting and participating in research might improve outcomes
through diverse mechanisms, stimulating teams to consider new
evidence, introduce new improved cancer treatments and equip-
ment, better quality assure their treatments and investigations
and rationalise decision-making. It is plausible that such effects,
which may be stimulated by research directly involving only a
minority of patients, have a bystander effect on non-research
patients cared for by the same team.
The impact of research activity on healthcare performance
has recently been thoroughly reviewed.7 8 It was concluded that
it is reasonable to suggest that when clinicians and hospitals
engage in research, there is a likelihood of improved perform-
ance but the evidence related mainly to improved processes of
care. However, a few studies have investigated whether a hospi-
tal’s research activity is associated with survival for all of their
patients. Population-level data for England 2005–2010 showed
a small but significant reduction in any-cause inpatient mortality
after acute admission among hospitals with higher research
recruitment.9 Disease-specific studies in coronary artery disease
in the USA10 and ovarian cancer in Germany11 12 also found
improved survival for patients treated at the more research-
active hospitals. However, there is a pressing need for further
large-scale research to confirm and evaluate the association and
to begin to consider evidence that may allow us to distinguish
between non-causative and causative links.
In 2001, the National Institute for Health Research Cancer
Research Network (NCRN) was established to provide the
English NHS with clinical infrastructure to improve the recruit-
ment, speed, quality and integration of clinical cancer research
in all parts of the NHS. An important goal of the NCRN was to
include all types of hospital Trust. Studies within the NCRN
portfolio were offered for participation across the Networks
through the trials units and network managers. Recruitment
centres were not selected by chief investigators alone. It rapidly
changed much of the NHS to be research-intensive and greatly
increased the number of studies in the national portfolio, the
number of patients recruited and the number of staff involved
in research.1 13 14 Over the same period, the National Cancer
Data Repository (NCDR) has collated and combined existing
datasets (such as cancer registrations and hospital admissions) to
create comprehensive individual-patient records of cancer diag-
noses, demographics, treatments and mortality.15–19
In this paper, we test the hypothesis that patients treated in
hospitals with high rates of interventional clinical research par-
ticipation have improved outcomes compared with patients
treated at otherwise similar but research-inactive institutions. W
e
focus on colorectal cancer (CRC): this is because the NHS
requires all patients with CRC to be managed in hospitals with
a CRC MDT
, and it is rare for patients to be transferred away
from their ‘home MDT’ for primary treatment. W
e further
hypothesise that the relationship between interventional clinical
research participation and outcomes is dependent upon the
degree and duration of research participation.
METHODS
Information was extracted on patients diagnosed with a first
primary CRC (ICD V
.1020 code C18–20) between 1 January
2001 and 31 December 2008. Dates of diagnosis and death (to
30 June 2010), age at diagnosis, sex, Dukes’ stage and tumour
site were obtained from the cancer registry component of the
NCDR. Postal code at diagnosis determined an individual’s
area-based measure of socioeconomic background using the
income domain of the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation
(IMD).21
A primary surgical procedure was sought for every individual
using the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset within the
NCDR. HES data do not fully capture information on those
treated in non-NHS hospitals (fewer than 8% of the population
in England). Procedures were categorised as: major resection;
minor resection; bypass; stoma formation; stent insertion (using
the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of
Interventions and Procedures V
.4)22 within 12 months of the
diagnosis. If no procedure could be identified, patients were
allocated to a ‘no surgical procedure’ group and the attendance
to a hospital with a CRC MDT closest to the date of diagnosis
(and within 30 days of diagnosis) was taken as their ‘index
admission’. Elective or emergency presentation and screening
status were identified.23 24
All 150 NHS Trusts (a single hospital or group of jointly
administered hospitals) with CRC MDTs were included in this
study. The annual Trust CRC workload was categorised as low
(≤150 cases), medium (151–250) or high (>250). The Trusts
which conduct the majority of biomedical and translational
cancer research in England are designated as Experimental
Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMCs)25 and these were flagged
(n=18).
Since 2001, the NCRN recorded patients in each trial in its
portfolio by hospital Trust. The portfolio includes all later phase
randomised
clinical
trials
and
other
well
designed,
peer
reviewed, studies funded by the UK Government and partners,
including, since 2005, certain commercially funded studies.26
The colorectal and anal cancer studies included in the portfolio
are listed in online supplementary table S1. Trust research par-
ticipation was described as a ratio or ‘rate’ calculated by dividing
the number of patients with CRC entering research studies
(NCRN data) by the number of new patients with CRC
managed (NCDR data) in each calendar year. The rate was cal-
culated for each Trust both for interventional (defined by the
NCRN on portfolio entry as studies which might result in a
change in patient management) and observational studies. These
rates were applied as the ‘research participation’ variable to all
individual patients treated in that Trust in each of the years.
Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ Our results allow investigators to show patients, healthcare
commissioners and policymakers that being treated in a
hospital active in clinical research is strongly associated with
better outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer. The data
provide an additional incentive to integrate research into
standard medical care.

 The relationship between research participation rates and
patient with CRC outcomes was explored in two ways. First,
the effect of research participation (as described above) on sur-
vival was examined using a Cox model, with follow-up time
censored at death, 5 years or 30 June 2010 (median follow-up
time: 5 years, range: 1.5–5 years). Research participation rates
were categorised as 0%, >0%–5%, >5%–10% or >10% and
adjusted for age group, sex, IMD quintile, Dukes’ stage, tumour
site, primary procedure, admission method, screening status,
year of diagnosis, annual Trust workload and ECMC status. A
second, more complex analysis was undertaken in an attempt to
incorporate the two concepts of level of research participation
as well as how long it was sustained (see online supplementary
files: statistical methods).27 28 Each possible rate of participation
in interventional clinical research (between 0% and 50%) was
used as a cut-off point and for each percentage (‘cut-off’) the
number of individual years that each T
rust achieved that cut-off
was calculated (this did not have be continuous). That gave the
required composite score of the percentage cut-off and how well
it was sustained, and this was then entered into the Cox model.
In addition to survival analyses, 30-day postoperative mortal-
ity was calculated in 142 663 patients who underwent a major
resection. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the
relationship between postoperative mortality and research par-
ticipation (using the two methods detailed above) with adjust-
ment as per the survival analyses (with the exception of primary
procedure). Missing data for Dukes’ stage (23.3%) and IMD
(1.5%) were imputed using the ‘ice’ command within Stata with
10 iterations (for both the survival and postoperative mortality
analyses). The imputation model included all variables used in
the analysis, all variables predictive of missing values and all
variables influencing the process causing the missing data.29
RESULTS
Between 2001 and 2008, 209 968 individuals were diagnosed
with CRC in England; their overall 5-year survival was 41.5%.
Of these, 142 663 individuals underwent major resection, of
whom 6.3% died within 30 days. The characteristics of the
population are shown in table 1. Over the same period, 30 998
individuals (14.8%) participated in any NCRN colorectal study
and 11 758 (5.6%) participated in an interventional trial.
Figure 1 shows the average rate of participation in interven-
tional trials by Trust (patients enrolled/number of new CRC
patients, %) over the whole 8-year period; however, this masks
the year-to-year variation in participation rates and our subse-
quent analyses have considered participation rates in each year
of the study.
The rates of participation in interventional studies by year
within each Trust (categorised as 0%, >0%–5%, >5%–10%,
>10%) showed a significant positive association with improved
survival and reduced postoperative mortality (summarised in
table 2 and with full results in online supplementary table S2).
Patients treated in a Trust with >10% of patients in intervention
trials had improved 5-year survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to
0.99 compared with 0% participation) and reduced 30-day post-
operative mortality (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96 compared
with 0% participation).
Figure 2 shows the results of the second, more complex, ana-
lysis using the full range of ‘cut-offs’ and incorporating the
number of years a Trust achieved that cut-off. The HRs and
associated p value for each cut-off (0%–50%) and the number
of years that each Trust achieved that cut-off, were derived from

 the Cox model. The HRs decrease with increasing cut-off points
used in the Cox model. While the cut-off with the largest
impact on survival was 25% participation, a second peak
occurred at 16% (figure 2A). As research participation increases,
the proportion of patients to which this applies reduces. It is of
most relevance to maximise this proportion of patients and look
at the lowest sensible threshold of research participation which
still results in a model fit that is close to the optimum. As such,
16% was used to define ‘high participation’. This analysis was
repeated, without the inclusion of ECMC status (figure 2B).
The impact of clinical research participation was still highly sig-
nificant and followed the same pattern, with similar peaks in the
p value.
Using the 16% threshold, no Trusts achieved this level of par-
ticipation in 2001. Between 2002 and 2008, 41 Trusts recruited
at this level for one or more years, with high research interven-
tional participation being greatest in 2003 (27 Trusts). Of the 18
ECMCs, 11 achieved the high participation rate in at least
1 year. However, most of the Trusts that achieved this high par-
ticipation threshold were not ECMCs (table 3). The breakdown
of the institutions achieving 3%, 7% or 16% participation by
the number of years above each threshold is given in table 3.
The 16% level of participation is only achieved by a minority of
Trusts and is difficult to sustain. However, 7% is achieved by
most Trusts and 3% by almost all.
Multivariable analysis showed that treatment in a Trust with
high
interventional
research
participation
(≥16%
in
any
individual year) was associated with an improvement in 5-year
survival (adjusted HR=0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) (summarised
in table 4 and full results in online supplementary table S3) for
all patients. Survival increased with the number of years a Trust
had high rates of participation (adjusted HR=0.90, 95% CI
0.88 to 0.93 ≥4 years compared with 0 years) (table 4 and
figure 3). This represents a 3.8% absolute difference in survival
(41.0% and 44.8% in the institutions with 0 and ≥4 years high
research participation, respectively) as can be seen graphically
(figure 3). The main improvement occurred over the first
6–8 months after diagnosis, reflecting the early management of
CRC including the reduction in postoperative mortality. All ana-
lyses were adjusted for year of diagnosis. The impact on survival
of being treated in a Trust with high (≥16%) interventional trial
participation was separately significant for patients diagnosed in
each of the years 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (see online sup-
plementary table S4).
Trusts with high rates of interventional research participation
(≥16% in any individual year) were also associated with a
reduction in the adjusted odds of death within 30 days of
surgery (adjusted OR=0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) (summarised
in table 4 and with full results in online supplementary table
S5). The odds of postoperative death decreased as the number
of years with high research participation increased, with indivi-
duals treated in Trusts with ≥4 years high participation having
the lowest mortality (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86 compared
with 0 years). This represents an absolute difference of 1.5% in

 30-day postoperative mortality (from 6.5% to 5.0% in the
Trusts with 0 years and ≥4 years, respectively).
For both 5-year survival and 30-day postoperative mortality, a
sensitivity analysis was performed including only patients with
no missing data, a ‘complete case analysis’. This was compared
with the analysis with missing data imputed and there were no
substantial differences (see online supplementary table S6). The
impact of interventional research participation on 1-year sur-
vival using the 16% cut-off was highly significant (see online
supplementary table S7).
It was not possible in the whole dataset to test the impact of
research participation upon processes of care other than
surgery.
A
regional
subset
of
the
NCDR
data
(30 701
patients),
for
which
chemotherapy
data
were
available,
showed increased uptake of chemotherapy in Trusts with
higher interventional research participation (≥16%) compared
with those with low participation (<16%) (OR 1.13, 95% CI
1.00 to 1.27).
High participation rates in ‘observational’ studies were not
associated with improved survival or postoperative mortality
(results not shown). Closer inspection of the data revealed that
most of the patients in the observational studies were recruited
several years after their original diagnosis, into genetics studies.
These data were not, therefore, studied further.
DISCUSSION
This large population-based study in a big national unselected
dataset, using CRC as an example, supports the prior hypothesis

survival. Cox multivariable analysis
was performed using the explanatory
variables listed in the text. The
additional variable was a composite
score derived from the number of years
for which the research participation
rate met and exceeded the % cut-off,
giving the number of years the rate of
participation was sustained above the
percentage shown. The HR shown is
for each year where the rate was
sustained above that percentage. The
associated p value is also shown,
plotted on a log scale. (A) Includes
adjustment for Experimental Cancer
Medicine Centre (ECMC) status while
(B) excludes adjustment for ECMC
status. Where 3% of patients
participate in clinical trials there is a
significant (p<0.01) impact on 5-year
survival. There is a rapid increase in
the p value as the percentage research
participation increases up to 7%
(p<1011) and then a slower increase to
a peak or peaks between 16% and
about 30%. After this the p value
decreases, as the number of Trusts
achieving such high levels of research
participation becomes smaller. The
same pattern is seen for both analyses
(with and without ECMC status).

 that being treated in Trusts with sustained high participation in
interventional clinical research is independently associated with
better outcomes. This effect is seen across all NHS Trusts that
care for patients with CRC and is not restricted to academic
centres or large institutions. Using an arbitrary cut-point of
>10% new cases to define high research participation, there
was an improvement in 5-year survival for patients treated in
high participation Trusts compared with those with no research
activity. Using a more sophisticated approach, higher rates of
participation and more years (of the eight studied) with high
participation each showed a ‘dose effect’ with, for example, an
estimated 3.8% improvement in survival for patients treated in
Trusts achieving ≥16% research participation for 4 years or
more. However, lower thresholds—for example, 7% participa-
tion—still produce highly significant benefits over no research
participation.
How does the impact of sustained high research participation
compare to other interventions? The maximum size of the
observed impact of research participation on survival is compar-
able to the whole patient population impact seen following a
highly positive intervention trial, where increments in survival
rarely exceed 5%, and the population impact is usually less than
the increment seen in the trial. Alternatively, the addition of
adjuvant chemotherapy to the treatment of patients with Duke’s
stage C CRC results broadly in a 10% increase in their long-
term survival—one of the substantial advances in the manage-
ment of this disease in recent decades. Duke’s C cases are some
30% of all cases. The benefits of this adjuvant chemotherapy
for the whole CRC population are thus comparable to the
potential benefits of high research participation.
Crucially, the effect of research activity is seen after adjust-
ment for medical and social factors such as casemix, hospital
case volume and ECMC status, which may be expected to affect
the performance of different institutions.30 Similarly, the effect
is independent of year of diagnosis, not simply a reflection of
the general improvement in CRC outcomes over time. The
increase in research participation precedes the onset of the
increase in survival with which it is independently associated.
This pattern is what would be expected if there were a causal
link.
It might be assumed that the highly research-active institu-
tions are limited to the large ‘centres of excellence’ but this is
not the case. Centres of excellence do perform well; 11 out of
18 ECMCs achieve high participation. However, their contribu-
tion is not the sole component of the impact on the whole NHS
and 30 high participation Trusts are not ECMCs.
The lower 30-day mortality in research-active Trusts could
reflect better diagnosis, staging or surgical and perioperative
care; the sustained improvement at 5 years reflects all aspects of
care. The impact of the novel treatments among trial partici-
pants cannot account for the observed effect on overall survival:
of the 35 intervention studies open during our study only six
produced significant positive effects on survival, and even in the
most research-intensive Trusts the novel arms of those trials

population.
Centres that are active in research are more likely to have
broader diagnostic and therapeutic arsenals. The development

Adjusted survival curves for patients treated in institutions
with high research participation. It shows the cumulative survival for
patients treated in institutions that have ≥16% participation in
interventional clinical trials for 0, 3 or ≥4 years. At the scale of this
graph the results for 1 and 2 years are superimposable over that for
0 years. The curves are highly significantly different and show that the
separation occurs principally in the first year of follow-up. Survival is
adjusted for primary procedure, index admission, Dukes’ stage, age,

 of this ‘arsenal’ could be a preceding condition that led to
greater trials participation. On the other hand, greater trials par-
ticipation might lead through to a stronger diagnostic and thera-
peutic
arsenal
which
would
be
one
component
of
the
mechanisms by which the trials resulted in improved outcomes.
Association studies alone cannot fully resolve this question.
This study has several limitations. Studies were categorised as
interventional or observational by NCRN, who classified some
studies of prevention and of follow-up regimens, as ‘interven-
tional’. W
e believe it is preferable to use the NCRN classifica-
tion rather than develop our own, but a narrower definition of
interventional may have given higher levels of significance. Anal
cancer trials were included in the NCRN CRC list as patients
with anal cancer are managed by the same MDTs who treat
CRC. The number of patients with anal cancer included in trials
is very small and exclusion of these is unlikely to have any
impact on the results.
Patients were allocated to Trusts according to where they
received their primary procedure. In the UK, patients rarely
travel far for primary treatment and confounding based on self-
referral will be minimal. Important care process data, such as
use of chemotherapy, was only available for a subset of the
whole sample. Full 5-year follow-up was not available for all
patients due to the time-lag associated with obtaining complete
cancer registration data, but most deaths occur within the early
follow-up period so any effect would be minimal. Analyses of
1-year survival with 100% follow-up showed similar results (see
online supplementary table S7).
Only 12 Trusts achieved an average of ≥16% recruitment to
trials across the study period and it could be argued that these
results are based on a limited subgroup of Trusts. However, the
analysis looked at recruitment within each year separately and,
as a result, a much higher number of Trusts were categorised as
having high research participation: 41 Trusts recruited ≥16% of
patients for one or more years. While this analysis identified
16% as an ‘optimum’ recruitment figure, in reality this may be
difficult to achieve and smaller increases in participation are still
associated with significant improvements in survival. Table 3
and figure 2 demonstrate that Trusts with participation rates of
3% or 7% also show highly significant associations with
improved outcomes.
Although we have shown an association between research par-
ticipation and survival in a very large unselected dataset, we
must be cautious when we seek to infer a causal contribution.
However, a randomised trial of ‘research versus no research’ is
not possible. This natural experiment, presented by the rapid
expansion of trial activity across a whole national health system,
is perhaps the best opportunity to address the subject through
outcomes research.31 It is reassuring that the association of
research participation with survival is independent of casemix,
case volumes and ECMC status, but we must acknowledge the
possibility of residual confounders. Our prior hypothesis and
analysis plan concerned the impact of interventional clinical
research, and we were unable to examine the impact of observa-
tional clinical studies in this dataset. Finally, CRC results in
England, although improving steadily, are less good than com-
parable countries,32 33 which may affect the applicability of our
findings in countries with the best outcomes.
Our results allow investigators to show patients, healthcare
commissioners and policymakers that being treated in a hospital
active in clinical research is strongly associated with better out-
comes. They provide an indication that increasing clinical
research may be an important tool for improving hospital per-
formance. The data support this general principle. They do not
indicate that all trials should be conducted across the whole
NHS—the best locations for a trial will be dependent on the
technologies involved and the capacity and capability of each
Trust. When considered alongside other studies and reviews
which suggest research participation improves processes of
care,6–12 34 our data provide an added incentive to integrate
research into standard medical care. The association between
research participation and outcomes is strong, grows steadily
with increasing and sustained participation, and that onset of
the improvements in outcomes follow the onset of increased
participation in a timely, plausible manner. However, this obser-
vation needs to be reproduced in other datasets and diseases.
Future research will test the generalisability and specificity of
our findings on other cancers and non-malignant diseases, and
will also study in more depth the nature of the relationship
between research participation and outcomes.
