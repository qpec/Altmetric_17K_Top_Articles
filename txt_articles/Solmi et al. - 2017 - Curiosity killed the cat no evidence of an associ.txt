Background. Congenital or early life infection with Toxoplasma gondii has been implicated in schizophrenia aetiology.
Childhood cat ownership has been hypothesized as an intermediary marker of T. gondii infection and, by proxy, as a
risk factor for later psychosis. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is, however, limited.
Method. We used birth cohort data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to investigate
whether cat ownership in pregnancy and childhood (ages 4 and 10 years) was associated with psychotic experiences
(PEs) in early (age 13, N = 6705) and late (age 18, N = 4676) adolescence, rated from semi-structured interviews. We
used logistic regression to examine associations between cat ownership and PEs, adjusting for several sociodemographic
and socioeconomic factors, household characteristics and dog ownership. Missing data were handled via multiple imput-
ation.
Results. Cat ownership during pregnancy was not associated with PEs at age 13 years [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.15,
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97–1.35] or 18 years (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86–1.35). Initial univariable evidence that cat own-
ership at ages 4 and 10 years was associated with PEs at age 13 years did not persist after multivariable adjustment
(4 years: OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94–1.48; 10 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92–1.36). There was no evidence that childhood cat own-
ership was associated with PEs at age 18 years.
Conclusions. While pregnant women should continue to avoid handling soiled cat litter, given possible T. gondii expos-
ure, our study strongly indicates that cat ownership in pregnancy or early childhood does not confer an increased risk of
later adolescent PEs.

Introduction
House cats are the primary hosts of Toxoplasma gondii,
a protozoan parasite that can infect various warm-
blooded animals, including humans (Tenter et al.
2000; Webster et al. 2013). Infection can occur in utero
or postnatally, via ingestion of either the parasite’s
oocysts – which might be present in soil, water, or
food – or tissue cysts from infected animals (e.g. in
raw or undercooked meat). In intermediate hosts (e.g.
humans or animals other than cats), the parasite
exploits lymphocytes to encroach in muscle tissues
and, importantly, the brain, where it can form tissue
cysts
in
neurons,
microglia,
and
astrocytes
(Carruthers & Suzuki, 2007).
Although the evidence is not unequivocal (Sugden
et al. 2016), data from several epidemiological, experi-
mental, and animal studies suggests that T. gondii
infection may be implicated in the aetiology of psych-
osis. For example, dopaminergic dysfunction and cog-
nitive impairments – similar to those observed in
people with schizophrenia – have been observed in
infected rodents (Gaskell et al. 2009; Prandovszky
et al. 2011; McConkey et al. 2013) and humans
(Kannan & Pletnikov, 2012); these people may also
experience hallucinations during acute infection with
the parasite (Sugden et al. 2016). A recent meta-analysis
of 38 studies found that compared with controls, peo-
ple with schizophrenia were nearly three times more
likely to be seropositive for T. gondii antibodies [odds
ratio (OR) 2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93–
3.80] (Torrey et al. 2012). Higher seroprevalence and
serointensity of T. gondii IgG (but not IgM, an indicator
of recent infection) in people with schizophrenia
(Cetinkaya et al. 2007) and their mothers (Brown et al.

 2005; Mortensen et al. 2007a) suggest that either early
life exposure to the parasite, congenital infection, or
transmission of maternal antibodies could alter neuro-
development of subsequent offspring.
Assuming a causal relationship between T. gondii
infection and later psychosis, some researchers have
hypothesized that cat ownership should confer an
increased
risk
of
psychotic
disorders
(Torrey
&
Yolken, 1995; Yuksel et al. 2010; Torrey et al. 2015).
Moreover, this theory has been proposed to explain
several epidemiological findings, including higher
rates of psychotic disorders in urban populations
(with higher cat densities and subsequent possibility
for infection) (Torrey & Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al.
2000, 2015). Nonetheless, robust empirical evidence
supporting this theory remains limited. Cat ownership
or contact during pregnancy (Kapperud et al. 1996;
Cook et al. 2000) and childhood (Taylor et al. 1997)
do not appear to be associated with T. gondii infection,
although handling soiled cat litter is known to be
associated with infection (Kapperud et al. 1996).
Epidemiological studies which have reported an asso-
ciation between cat ownership and psychosis (Torrey
& Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015; Yuksel et al.
2010), have generally been hindered by notable meth-
odological limitations (Wolf & Hamilton, 2015), includ-
ing reliance on case-control designs that are susceptible
to recall bias, small ad hoc samples and weak statistical
analyses, which have failed to adequately account for
confounding or missing data.
To overcome these issues, we sought to test whether
prenatal and childhood cat ownership were associated
with an increased risk of developing psychotic experi-
ences (PEs) in early and late adolescence, using longi-
tudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (ALSPAC). PEs in adolescence
are an established risk factor for later schizophrenia,
particularly
with
respect
to
psychotic
symptoms
which emerge or persist in late adolescence (Poulton
et al. 2000; Fisher et al. 2013). Since T. gondii infection
is proposed to increase psychosis risk by affecting
early life neurodevelopment (Mortensen et al. 2007b),
we restricted cat ownership to the prenatal and early
childhood period (at age 4 years), although we also
performed additional analyses using cat ownership at
age 10 years to better align with previous research
(Torrey & Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015;
Yuksel et al. 2010).
Method
Sample
The ALSPAC study invited 16 734 pregnant women
expected to deliver between 1 April 1991 and 31
April 1992 resident in the former county of Avon in
the Southwest of England to participate; of these, 14
541 (87%) enrolled resulting in 14 062 live births and
13 988 children alive at age 1 year. The sample was
supplemented with 713 additional children (whose
mothers were originally eligible for the study) during
follow-up between the ages of 7 and 18 years. More
details on recruitment, follow-up assessments and
time-points have been published elsewhere (Boyd
et al. 2012). All mothers gave informed written consent
prior to recruitment and the ALSPAC Ethics and Law
Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees
gave ethical approval for this study.
In this study we included children with complete
data on PEs at ages 13 (N = 6705) and 18 (N = 4676)
years. For twin pairs (N = 87, 2.6% of the sample at
age 12, and N = 42, 1.8% at age 18), we excluded one
sibling (sibling ‘B’) to avoid biasing estimates due to
shared genetic and environmental exposures; there is
no evidence that, in twins, birth order is related to
schizophrenia risk (Onstad et al. 1992; Kleinhaus et al.
2008).
Exposure variable
Information
on
pet
ownership
was
reported
by
mothers via postal questionnaires during pregnancy,
and subsequently when their child was aged 8, 21, 31
and 47 months. In addition to cat ownership, mothers
were asked about the number and type of other pets
owned, including: dogs, rabbits, rodents, birds (all
waves), and tortoises and fish (from 21 months).
From these questions we created two primary binary
exposure variables, indicating whether the mother
owned a cat (yes/no): (i) in pregnancy; and (ii) at
child’s age of 47 months (∼4 years). As a secondary
exposure, we employed cat ownership at 10 years
(122 months) in order to create an exposure variable
comparable with those used in previous studies
(Torrey & Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015). We
did not test whether a dose-response effect existed
between duration of cat ownership and psychotic
symptoms, since the majority (89%) of children who
reported cat ownership at age 4 years also owned
one at ages 8, 21, and 31 months, as reported by
their mothers.
Outcome variables
At approximately ages 13 and 18 years, children
attended clinic visits where they were administered
the psychotic-like symptoms interview (PLIKSi), a
semi-structured
interviewer-rated
screening
assess-
ment for PEs. The PLIKSi contains six questions on
unusual experiences (i.e. derealization, depersonaliza-
tion,
self-unfamiliarity,
dysmorphophobia,

 object perception, and other perceptual abnormalities)
followed by 12 questions adapted from the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children version IV (DISC-IV;
Shaffer et al. 2000) and the Schedule for Clinical
Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN; WHO, 1994).
These are aimed at assessing the presence of delusions
(being spied on, persecuted, having thoughts read, ref-
erence, control, grandiose ability, and other delusions),
hallucinations (visual and auditory), and intrusive
thoughts (thought broadcasting, insertion and with-
drawal) (Horwood et al. 2008). Total scores were
recoded into a binary variable indicating the absence,
or the suspected/definite presence of symptoms, con-
sistent
with
previous
investigations
of
PEs
in
ALSPAC (Horwood et al. 2008; Dorrington et al.
2014). Children whose psychotic symptoms could
have been attributed to fever or sleep problems were
coded as not having the outcome (Zammit et al. 2008,
2009; Dorrington et al. 2014).
Other variables
We employed causal diagrams, known as directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs; Textor & Liśkiewicz, 2011), to
identify variables which could confound the associ-
ation between cat ownership and psychotic symp-
toms.
We
modelled
hypothesized
associations
between a broad initial set of potential child- and
mother-based variables, cat ownership in either preg-
nancy or childhood and PEs using the DAGitty web-
based
software
(Textor
et
al.
2011).
Our
DAGs
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) suggested that it
was inappropriate to control for some of these vari-
ables, either because they did not meet criteria for con-
founding (e.g. child gender, stressful life events,
maternal
depression,
pet
ownership
other
than
dogs), or because adjustment for other variables (e.g.
paternal age, dog ownership in pregnancy) provided
sufficient control for any other causal paths (e.g.
maternal age, dog ownership at age 4 years). From
our DAGs we were able to identify the minimal suffi-
cient number of confounders of the relationship
between exposure to cat ownership in pregnancy
and childhood and PEs at ages 13 and 18 years.
These included: child ethnicity (white/non-white –
including
Black
African,
Black
Caribbean,
Other
Black, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other,
mixed); paternal age (at the time of mother’s preg-
nancy); maternal marital status in pregnancy (single,
separated, divorced, or widowed/married); highest
maternal academic education in pregnancy (vocational
course/secondary
schooling/university
degree
or
higher); maternal social class (manual v. non-manual
profession); number of house moves up to age 47
months (∼4 years); housing type (detached, semi-
detached, terraced/flat, other); household crowding
index (range 0–1); and dog ownership in pregnancy.
The ALSPAC website contains details of all the data
that is available through a fully searchable data dic-
tionary
(available
at:
http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/
researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
Statistical analyses
We employed cross-tabulations (with χ² tests) and
ANOVAs to (i) investigate the presence of selective
attrition in the sample, by comparing children with
and without missing outcome data on exposure and
confounding variables; (ii) describe the sample and
test for differences in the distribution of exposure
and confounding variables across outcome levels. We
then
fitted
univariable
and
multivariable
logistic
regression models adjusting for all variables identified
as relevant confounders using DAGs (Supplementary
Figs S1 and S2), i.e.: dog ownership in pregnancy;
housing type; household crowding; maternal educa-
tion, social class, and marital status; paternal age; num-
ber of house moves. When the studied exposure was
cat ownership in childhood, we further adjusted for
maternal cat ownership in pregnancy.
Since our primary hypothesis was a null association
between cat ownership and psychotic symptoms, we
conducted power calculations, assuming an alpha of
0.05 to determine the effect size we could reasonably
expect to detect, had it existed, given our sample
sizes. Our sample had over 90% power to detect an
OR of 1.25 based on the observed exposure distribu-
tion and sample sizes.
Missing data
Analyses were based on participants with complete
data at age 13 (N = 6705) and 18 (N = 4676) years.
Missing main exposures and covariate data varied
between 0.04% (pregnancy) to 34.08% (age 4 years),
and 0.02% (pregnancy) to 33.58% (age 4 years) at
each
time
point,
respectively
(Supplementary
Table S1).
We used multiple imputation with chained equa-
tions (MICE) and the Stata ice command (Royston &
White, 2011) to impute missing exposure and covariate
data, including all observed exposure, covariate and
outcome data into our multiple imputation (MI) rou-
tine, in addition to several auxiliary variables which
could provide information about missing values.
These included: gender; stressful life events; maternal
depression in pregnancy; other pet (rabbit, rodents,
turtles, birds, fish) ownership in pregnancy and age 4
years; two measures of depressive symptoms at ages
12 and 18 years assessed via self-reported with the
short
moods
and

income at child’s age of 33 months. We also included
a variable indicating maternal history of schizophrenia
at birth in light of the known genetic heritability of
psychosis (Lichtenstein et al. 2009). We imputed 100
datasets using linear, logistic, ordinal logistic, and
multinomial logistic models according to the nature
of the variables whose missing values had to be
imputed. As sensitivity analyses we examined the
association between cat ownership and adolescent
PEs in (i) a complete case analysis, to assess any pos-
sible bias introduced when failing to account for miss-
ing data, and (ii) using data on the full ALSPAC
sample
(N = 15 023)
with
multiple
imputation
on
those missing outcome data, to assess possible biases
introduced by our main choice of multiple imputation.
All analyses were performed using Stata v. 13
(StataCorp, 2013).
Results
Missing data
Children with missing outcome data at ages 13 and 18
years were more likely to be boys, from a non-white
ethnic background, to live in more crowded houses,
and have experienced a stressful life event by age 4
years. Children with missing data were also more
likely to have younger parents, and a mother who
had suffered from probable depression in pregnancy,
was less well educated, not married, from a manual
occupation, and who had moved house more fre-
quently. At ages 13 and 18 years, children whose
mother had owned a cat in pregnancy were less likely
to have missing data, although children whose mother
had owned a cat in their childhood were more likely to
have
missing
outcome
data
at
age
13
years.
Participants with missing outcome data at either age
were more likely to have a mother who owned a
dog, a bird, a rabbit, or rodent in pregnancy or during
childhood (Supplementary Table S1).
Sample characteristics
A total of 6705 and 4676 children had complete data on
psychotic symptoms at ages 13 and 18 years, respect-
ively, and were therefore included in the analyses. At
both ages, the majority of each sample was of female
gender, white ethnicity, had a mother who had com-
pleted at least A-levels, was married, non-manual pro-
fession, and had moved house <3 times during the 4
years prior to pregnancy and age 4 years of the child
(Table 1) In both samples, around one third of mothers
owned a cat during pregnancy, and at 4 and 10 years
(Table 1). Among children who owned a cat at age 4
years, between 79% and 89% also owned a cat at pre-
vious waves of data collection (i.e. at ages 8, 21, and
33 months). Among those who owned a cat at age 10
years, between 62% and 86% also owned a cat at a pre-
vious time point (data available from authors).
At age 13 years, a greater proportion of the sample
who reported suspected/definite psychotic symptoms
owned a cat in childhood, were girls, lived in flats
and in crowded home environments, had moved
homes more frequently, and had a mother who was
younger, less well educated, and of single marital sta-
tus (Table 1). Similar patterns were generally observed
for the sample at age 18 years (Table 1), although there
was no longer any apparent association between PEs
and number of house moves, while non-manual social
class and non-white ethnicity were associated with
experiencing suspected/definite PEs at this age.
Cat ownership and psychotic symptoms
Cat ownership in pregnancy was not associated with
psychotic symptoms at age 13 or 18 years in either uni-
variable (age 13: OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97–1.35; age 18; OR
1.08, 95% CI 0.86–1.35) or in multivariable (age 13:
adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97–1.36; age 18; OR 1.08,
95% CI 0.85–1.37) models, following multiple imput-
ation (Table 2). Owning a cat at age 4 years was asso-
ciated with higher odds of having PEs at age 13 years
in univariable models (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04–1.46), but
this effect was no longer significant after multivariable
adjustment (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94–1.48). There was no
evidence that cat ownership at age 4 years was asso-
ciated with PEs at age 18 years (univariable OR 1.11,
95% CI 0.88–1.40; adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71–
1.31). These patterns were similar with respect to cat
ownership at age 10 years, with no apparent associ-
ation with PEs at age 13 years (OR 1.12, 95% CI
0.92–1.36) or 18 years (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82–1.45)
after multivariable adjustment (Table 2).
Sensitivity analyses
In complete case analyses cat ownership in pregnancy
was associated with higher odds of PEs at age 13 years
in all models (univariable OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.65;
adjusted OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06–1.69), as was cat owner-
ship at age 4 years (univariable OR 1.44, 95% CI
1.13–1.83; adjusted OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.13). Cat
ownership at age 10 years was only associated with
PEs at age 13 years in univariable models (OR 1.30,
95% CI 1.02–1.66), but not in adjusted models. We
found no evidence of an association between cat own-
ership and PEs at age 18 years (Supplementary
Table S3).

 Next, we used the fully imputed dataset to examine
the association between cat ownership and adolescent
PEs on the whole ALSPAC cohort (N = 15 023). The
pattern of these results (Supplementary Table S4) was
very similar to the magnitude, direction and general
lack of association between cat ownership and adoles-
cent PEs reported in our main results based on imput-
ation of exposures and confounders (Table 2). Together
these sensitivity analyses suggested that complete case
analyses may lead to biased risk estimates, while our
choice of MI routine did not substantially bias our
results.
Discussion
We found no evidence that cat ownership in preg-
nancy or childhood was associated with PEs in early
and late adolescence using prospectively collected
data from a large population-based cohort, following
control for several confounders and methods that
investigate the likely impact of missing data.
Our findings in relation to PEs are not consistent
with the existing literature that has studied cat owner-
ship in people with schizophrenia (Torrey & Yolken,
1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015; Yuksel et al. 2010). We
suggest
that
several
methodological
differences
between our study and other investigations, including
previous reliance on small, retrospective, convenience
samples, may explain the discrepancy.
Our study was based on PEs in early and late adoles-
cence, unlike other studies which were based on a clin-
ical diagnosis of schizophrenia (Torrey & Yolken, 1995;
Torrey et al. 2000, 2015; Yuksel et al. 2010). One possible
explanation of our null findings is that cat ownership
does not affect the population expression of psychosis
(i.e. does not shift the continuum), but operates only to
increase risk of threshold symptoms for clinical dis-
order. We consider this explanation unlikely, given
Table 2. Univariable and multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between maternal cat ownership
in pregnancy and between the ages of 8 months and 4 years of the child and psychotic symptoms (suspected or definite v. none) at ages 13 and 18
years (N includes exposure and confounding variables imputed with multiple imputation with chained equations, N = 100 imputations)

 that: psychotic symptoms in late childhood and adoles-
cence predict onset of non-affective psychosis and
other psychopathology (Poulton et al. 2000; Laurens
et al. 2007; Kelleher et al. 2012; Fisher et al. 2013) and
psychotic symptoms in late adolescence are better pre-
dictors of future psychopathology. In line with other
literature (Kelleher et al. 2012), we observed a decline
in the prevalence of PEs between ages 13 and 18
years. If symptoms in later adolescence therefore pro-
vide a greater indication of later clinical disorder
(Poulton et al. 2000; Fisher et al. 2013) then our results
at age 18 (where there was no evidence of any associ-
ation between cat ownership and PEs) may have the
strongest implications for likely effects of early life
cat ownership on clinical disorder.
Unlike previous studies which investigated cat own-
ership up until ages 10 or 13 years (Torrey & Yolken,
1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015; Yuksel et al. 2010), we
restricted our main exposure variables to cat owner-
ship during potentially sensitive windows of neurode-
velopment, namely pregnancy and at age 4 years (47
months). We included cat ownership at age 10 years
as a secondary exposure, consistent with previous lit-
erature, but our results mirrored those found at age 4
years, generally indicating an absence of association.
Our study was sufficiently powered to detect effect
sizes previously observed in the schizophrenia litera-
ture with respect to cat ownership (ORs 51.25)
(Torrey & Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al. 2000, 2015;
Yuksel et al. 2010), as evidenced by the initial univari-
able associations we only observed between childhood
exposure and PEs at age 13 years. While our study
would have had less power to detect smaller ORs,
including those we observed between 1.04 and 1.15,
any such small effects, if true, would not warrant par-
ticular public mental health attention.
Previous reports of positive associations between cat
ownership and schizophrenia may therefore have been
attributable to Type I error, particularly given the
small sample sizes and lack of control for confounders
inherent to some studies. We adjusted for several, theor-
etically-informed
confounders,
including
ethnicity
(Westgarth et al. 2010; Kirkbride et al. 2012), maternal
academic achievement and social class (Mulvany et al.
2001; Werner et al. 2007; Westgarth et al. 2010), and par-
ental age (Sipos et al. 2004; Lopez-Castroman et al. 2010;
Westgarth et al. 2010; Petersen et al. 2011). We also
adjusted for number of house moves in light of evidence
of an association between residential mobility and PEs
(Singh et al. 2014), crowding index and housing type
as a proxies for both social class and greater possibility
of contact with T. gondii-contaminated litter, and dog
ownership as a possible confounder of the association
between T. gondii infection (given an increased likeli-
hood to contaminated soils outdoors) and psychosis risk.
Earlier studies also relied on retrospective recall, and
hence the potential of recall bias, of cat exposure and
did not distinguish between ownership in infancy v.
later childhood, making it impossible to attribute risk
to specific periods of cat ownership over the early
life-course.
Finally, we employed multiple imputation techni-
ques in order to account for missing data, which
could have otherwise biased our results. Consistent
with guidelines (Sterne et al. 2009), we included all
known exposure, outcome, covariate and auxiliary
variables in MI as well as additional variables which
had been previously found to be associated with PEs
in this sample. Comparing our results with those
from complete case analyses suggests that selective
participation
may
potentially
bias
estimates,
and
could therefore explain previous positive findings in
the literature (Torrey & Yolken, 1995; Torrey et al.
2000, 2015). This hypothesis is further supported by
our results using the fully-imputed sample, where no
significant associations were found in line with our
main findings.
In conclusion, there is good evidence to support an
association between T. gondii infection and later risk
of experiencing psychosis, and this research is consist-
ent with possible inflammatory causes of schizophre-
nia and other psychotic disorders. From a public
health perspective, however, it is perhaps reassuringly
that data from our prospective longitudinal study were
not consistent with the hypothesis that cat ownership
in pregnancy or early childhood is a risk factor for
later psychosis.
