Abstract
Using a Health Impact Assessment Framework, we estimated the population health effects arising 
from alternative land-use and transport policy initiatives in six cities. Land-use changes were 
modelled to reflect a compact city in which land-use density and diversity were increased and 
distances to public transport were reduced to produce low motorised mobility, namely a modal 
shift from private motor vehicles to walking, cycling, and public transport. The modelled compact 
city scenario resulted in health gains for all cities (for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and

 respiratory disease) with the overall health gains ranging from 420 disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) per 100 000 population to 826 DALYs per 100 000 population. However, for moderate to 
highly motorised cities, such as Melbourne, London, and Boston, the compact city scenario 
predicted a small increase in road trauma for cyclists and pedestrians (health loss of between 34 to 
41 DALYs per 100 000 population). The findings suggest that government policies need to 
actively pursue land-use elements (particularly a focus towards compact cities) that support a 
modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public 
transport. At the same time, these policies need to ensure the provision of safe walking and cycling 
infrastructure. The findings highlight the opportunities for policymakers to positively influence the 
overall health of city populations.
Introduction
Cities around the world are dealing with the consequences of changing population 
demographics and policies that have failed to effectively manage the relationships between 
land-use, mobility, and population health. Urban growth and the pressure it places on urban 
infrastructure is now a major international challenge. By 2050, the populations of Australia’s 
four largest cities will be similar to Australia’s current total population,1 while the United 
States, China, and India will see increases in their larger cities of 33%, 38% and 96%, 
respectively.2
Associated with continued population growth are ever-increasing demands on transport 
systems. Governments are increasingly emphasising the need to integrate transport and land-
use planning,3 acknowledging that land-use decisions significantly influence transport 
options and travel choices. Sprawling residential-only developments that dominate most 
suburban areas in North America, Australia, and New Zealand limit the ability of people to 
walk or cycle for their daily travel requirements.4 In these countries, low-density housing 
developments render public transport development costs prohibitive, producing a reliance on 
private motorised transport and increasing exposure to the risks associated with traffic speed, 
traffic volume, vehicle emissions, and physical inactivity.5 In response to economic growth, 
private car use is also dramatically increasing in many middle-income countries such as 
Brazil,6 China, and India.7 The resultant declines in physical activity and increases in air 
pollution, noise, and risk of motor vehicle crashes combine to produce increased rates of 
chronic disease and injury.8
For city planners and policy-makers with the power to influence the health of rapidly 
expanding cities and increasingly motorised populations, minimising health risk exposures 
while maintaining or enhancing the mobility of city residents needs to be a priority. Recent 
innovations in transportation have generated an expectation of a transportation revolution. 
With web connectivity, automated vehicles, and advanced software, a future is envisaged 
where road deaths, serious injury, and congestion are eliminated. Like an engineering fix for 
global warming, this vision is seductive and will eventually play some part in solving current 
transportation challenges. However, serious obstacles including software viruses, security 
risks, and fall-back options in the case of major connected system failures mean that 
technological solutions will be achieved, but only over the ensuing decades. Additionally,

 these solutions will not address the broader health and environmental consequences 
associated with land-use, the transport system and rapid motorisation identified in the first 
paper in this series,9 namely increased cardiovascular disease, diabetes,10 and respiratory 
disease11, 12 coupled with escalating road traffic injury13 and the ongoing challenges 
associated with infectious diseases in highly urbanised areas.14
Globally, deaths from road traffic injury have increased by 46% over the 20 years to 2012, 
making it the eighth leading cause of death.15 The United Nations General Assembly 
resolution on global road safety acknowledges the emerging challenges associated with 
reducing road injury,16 as do initiatives such as Sustainable Safety17 and Vision Zero.18 
These efforts are consistent with the United Nations Post-2015 Sustainable Development 
Agenda, which emphasises the risks associated with global trends towards urbanisation and 
disaster risk reduction and mitigation. However, these efforts have rarely acknowledged the 
impact of land-use issues (such as urban sprawl) on travel mode choice or travel distance, 
and the consequent effects on population and environmental health.
Indeed, the effects of land-use and transport modal choice on population health are not well 
described. In part, this is because they occur against a backdrop of complex, interacting, and 
dynamic environmental, technological, and population conditions that evolve over years. 
Building on elements of the first paper in this series,9 this paper investigates the population 
health outcomes associated with land-use policies that influence a city’s transport modal 
choice. We model urban design interventions to create a compact city and quantify the 
potential health gains that residents of compact cities would obtain by adopting low 
motorised mobility.
A model of land-use, transport mode choice, and population health
To assess the relationship between land-use, transport, and population health, we selected 
the key elements presented in the preceding paper (and highlighted in blue in figure 1) for 
which information and relationships have been demonstrated.19 We also conducted a review 
of the literature to identify measures of association for the key elements identified in the 
preceding paper. Having obtained estimates of the relationship between land-use and 
transport modal choice, we applied a Health Impact Assessment Framework20 to produce a 
model for which estimates of population health outcomes were derived.
To model the city-specific effect of land-use and urban design interventions on transport 
modal choice and population health, we took characteristics from six cities. We selected the 
cities based on a combination of the country’s stage of development, level of motorisation, 
geographic disparity, and the availability of reliable transport and health data. These cities 
were: Melbourne, Australia (a high-income and highly motorised city); Boston, United 
States (a high-income and moderately motorised city); London, United Kingdom (a high-
income and moderately motorised city); Copenhagen, Denmark (a high-income and 
moderately motorised city); São Paulo, Brazil (an upper- to middle-income and moderately 
motorised city); and Delhi, India (a low- to middle-income and rapidly motorising city).21 
We applied weighted average associations between urban design (density, distance, and 
diversity) and transport mode choice for each city that were derived from a meta-analysis 
undertaken by Ewing and Cervero.19 The associations ranged from 0·02 to 0·29 per unit

 change in the relationship between density, distance, and land-use diversity and the 
respective transport mode choice. Density refers to population density, residential unit or 
intersection density, distance refers to the average distance to public transport, and diversity 
refers to the land-use mix within a given precinct (eg, mix of commercial and residential 
land-use). These urban design elements are further illustrated in figure 2.
It is important to note that the estimates derived from the meta-analytic approach included 
studies with small samples that were predominantly from North American cities and 
included uncontrolled confounding factors. Therefore, an element of uncertainty is 
associated with these estimates.19
For each city, we assessed the influence of land-use, urban design interventions, and 
transport mode choices on population health outcomes, namely road trauma (road deaths and 
serious injury; ICD-AM V00-V89), cardiovascular disease (ICD-AM I00-I99), diabetes 
(ICD-AM E10-E14), and respiratory disease (ICD-AM J30-J98). For comparative purposes, 
road trauma and chronic disease health outcomes (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
respiratory disease) were reported as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which are a 
combination of the sum of the years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and 
years of productive life lost due to a disability.22
The key determinants of population health associated with transport mode choice as 
identified in the literature and applied within the model were:
•
risk of death or injury per kilometre travelled by mode23–25
•
level of physical activity (measured by metabolic equivalents (METS)26, 27) 
expended by mode choice per hour28–31 and its effect on cardiovascular disease 
and type 2 diabetes
•
chronic exposure (via inhalation) to fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2·5) 
associated with exhaust emissions and raised dust from transport.32
Baseline population, transport mode share, road trauma, levels of physical inactivity, and air 
quality data were input for each city using the most recent data sources available.
Modelled changes in road trauma—Travel-mode, road deaths and serious injury data 
were available from recent travel surveys and government agencies in Melbourne,33, 34 
Delhi,35 São Paulo,36 London,37 Boston,38 and Copenhagen.39, 40 These data included 
distance travelled per mode and per day and road fatalities and injuries by mode per year 
(injury data for Delhi were adjusted to account for historical under-reporting41). To estimate 
differences in road trauma as a result of changing mode share, we applied an approach that 
combined the probability of a crash between different road users given the changing 
proportions of transport modes within the transport system.23, 24, 42, 43 We based 
estimates of chronic disease burden associated with road trauma on country-level data from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 201344 converted to city-specific DALY estimates 
scaled to city population size.

 Modelled changes in chronic disease—Levels of transport-related physical inactivity 
and vehicle emissions were modelled for each city. Changes in physical activity were 
estimated by calculating changes in the average estimated distance travelled per person, per 
mode and per day. We then applied consistent average METS per hour associated with each 
form of travel for each city.26 Average time spent in each travel mode was calculated using a 
combination of average speed by mode and daily distance travelled for each city.
The effect of increased physical activity (in METS per week) on cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes was estimated using linear associations established in the literature of 0·25 and 0·20 
per 1000 kcal per week, respectively,45–50 with a benefit threshold restricted to activity in 
excess of 2·5 METS per hour.51 We considered this method to be appropriate for the small 
variations in overall physical activity that we modelled. However, it should be noted that 
associations between non-vigorous physical activity and disease risk has previously been 
shown to be non-linear in a meta-analysis of studies that incorporated greater proportional 
changes.52 As well, the modelling of physical activity did not take into account 
demographic differences (eg, age profiles and gender) in the likelihood of a modal shift 
between passive and active transport modes, the effects of exercise compensation,53, 54 or 
differences in average speeds or METS associated with different demographic groups. 
Although these differences have been explored elsewhere,55 we considered the levels of 
uncertainty associated with the estimates to be too great to be reliable at anything other than 
population levels.
To estimate total vehicle emissions in each city, we obtained the most recently available city-
specific particulate emissions (PM10 and PM2·5) data and estimates of the proportion of 
particulate matter generated by motor vehicles through combustion and suspended road dust 
in Melbourne, Delhi, São Paulo, and London.56–64 Data on the proportion of PM10 
produced by vehicles for Boston and Copenhagen were unavailable so an estimate of 30% 
was used, which approximated the median of the other cities. To reflect the clean fuel 
technology bus fleets implemented in Delhi64 and the urban bus renewal program in São 
Paulo,65 additional vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) by bus was assumed to be 
undertaken in fleets powered by compressed natural gas, which emits negligible additional 
fine particle emissions.66
We modelled DALYs attributable to respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease 
associated with coarse (<PM10) and fine (<PM2·5) particulate emissions. Particulate 
emissions associated with vehicles were assumed to change proportionately with kilometres 
travelled. The effect of PM2·5 reduction on long-term cardiovascular disease risk and the 
effect of PM10 reduction on respiratory disease risk were then estimated using associations 
gathered from a systematic search of the literature. The search identified an approximate 
20% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality risk per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2·567–71 
and an approximate 2·5% increase in respiratory disease risk per 10 μg/m3 increase in 
PM1072–77 (although estimates for this effect vary widely between studies). We assumed 
that air pollution affected mortality and incidence to the same degree,78 and we assumed 
that levels of PM10 and PM2·5 were closely correlated79, 80 and their effects on 
cardiovascular disease were not additive. Particulate emissions from private motorised 
transport modes per person and per kilometre travelled81, 82 were assumed to be equivalent.

 Applying this model involved co-ordination and linkage of multiple studies and effects 
across a wide variety of disciplines, each with their own inherent sources of error. We 
acknowledge these uncertainties and undertook Monte Carlo simulation using Analytica 4.4 
software83 for each of the city-specific models. The simulation provided confidence interval 
boundaries for the estimated DALYs associated with population health outcomes as well as 
sensitivity analyses to identify factors that were most influential in contributing to chronic 
disease and road trauma outcomes (see the Web Appendix for details). To reflect the 
uncertainty associated with both land-use changes on transport mode choice and transport 
mode choice on the risk of road death or injury, we allowed the estimates associated with 
these variables to vary according to normal distributions with standard deviations equal to 
20% of the mean.84 For example, the effect of land-use density change on VKT was 
allowed to vary according to a normal distribution, as was the effect of VKT change on the 
risk of exposure to death or injury per kilometre travelled. Other variables for each city that 
were allowed to vary due to acknowledged real-world uncertainty72 and likely skewed 
distributions were the proportion of active transport transferred from vehicles distributed 
between cycling and walking, total kilometres travelled per year (negatively skewed log-
normal distribution),51 METS associated with transport modes,85 average speed by mode, 
and total particulate matter. The relationship between levels of physical activity and chronic 
disease and between exposure to particulate matter and chronic disease reflected a normal 
distribution, as described above. Nonetheless, the breadth of findings for many effects of 
land-use on transport mode choice, or the effects of transport mode choice on the key 
outcomes (both road trauma and chronic disease) are likely to vary beyond the conservative 
estimates made here. The model and underlying assumptions are available in the Web 
Appendix.
City comparisons by land-use, transport and population health
The burden of disease and injury (with respect to road trauma, cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, and respiratory disease) associated with land-use and transport were estimated for 
each city. The proportion of VKT by travel mode and the risk of road death and serious 
injury per VKT for each city are reported in figure 3 and tables 1a and 1b, respectively. 
There are considerable differences between cities in relation to the proportion of VKT 
travelled using private motor vehicles compared with public transport, cycling, and walking. 
In part, differences in VKT by travel mode reflect cities with significant population size but 
low population densities.
Consequently, these cities have typically invested in road infrastructure and have high levels 
of private motorised transport (eg, Melbourne and Boston). Despite the contrast in transport 
modal choice within and between cities (see box 1), it is also important to highlight the 
considerable between-city differences in estimated risk of death or injury for similar 
transport modes. For example the estimated per kilometre risk of death if travelling as a 
driver in a private motorised vehicle in Delhi is 3·3 times greater than the risk in Melbourne 
or London. Similarly, the estimated risk of death as a cyclist in São Paulo is 25 times greater 
than the risk in Copenhagen (see tables 1a and 1b).

 Baseline DALYs for chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory 
disease) and road trauma (road deaths and serious injury) are summarised in tables 2a and 
2b.
DALYs associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, and road 
trauma vary widely between cities, reflecting observations in the recently released Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2013.44 For instance, there are four- to five-fold differences in 
DALYs for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and road trauma between the high-income city 
of Melbourne and the low- to middle-income city of Delhi. Estimated differences in 
respiratory disease between cities demonstrate smaller disparities, but the estimates for Delhi 
are almost twice those of Copenhagen. The disparity observed in cardiovascular disease 
between Delhi and the remaining cities may reflect the presence of risk factors that 
contribute to cardiovascular disease beyond those associated with the transport system; these 
include socioeconomic constraints, diet, exercise, tobacco use, and, potentially, a genetic 
predisposition to cardiovascular disease later in life.86
Opportunities for cities to enhance population health: a compact city model
Using the land-use and transport mode choice model illustrated in figure 1, we modelled a 
scenario designed to enhance population health in the six selected cities. In what we refer to 
as the compact cities model – a city of short distances that promotes higher residential 
density, mixed land-use, proximate and enhanced public transport, and an urban form that 
encourages cycling and walking87 – we provided an alternative to each city’s current land-
use configuration and estimated the overall differences in the burden of disease under a 
compact city scenario. Under the compact cities model we increased land-use density by 
30%, reduced the average distances to public transport options by 30%, and increased the 
diversity of land-use by 30%. We combined these changes with an additional transport 
policy initiative that supported a 10% modal shift away from private motor vehicle driver 
and passenger VKTs (excluding motorcycles) to either cycling (2/3 of the total shift) or 
walking (1/3 of the total shift). This modal shift is similar to the goals of transport policies 
currently being implemented in a number of European cities that impose barriers to private 
motor vehicle use.88 The percentages of land-use changes and transport modal shifts across 
each city were selected on the basis that these were pragmatic and could be implemented 
over a reasonable time frame. For example, in a city such as Melbourne, a 30% reduction in 
average distances to public transport means reducing a journey from an average of 2 km to 
1·6 km. That said, it is important to note that a 30% increase in land-use density in a city 
such as Delhi, which already has an estimated population density approaching 20 000 
persons per square kilometre,89 is unrealistic (and probably unnecessary) compared with 
achieving the same percentage increase in Melbourne or Copenhagen.
Figure 3 reports the estimated change in kilometres travelled per day by private vehicles, 
public transport, and walking and cycling (active transport) under the compact cities model. 
Table 3, outlines the change in travel-related METS and transport-related particulate 
emissions under the same model. Given the land-use changes imposed and the mode-shift 
from private motor vehicles, it is not surprising that an increase in public transport travel 
(trains, trams and buses) and walking and cycling is observed in each city. The largest

 changes in walking and cycling are seen in Melbourne, Boston, and London. However, much 
of the increase in walking and cycling in these cities comes from building upon very low 
existing VKT in these modes. This means that the overall proportion of kilometres travelled 
by walking and cycling remains low (< 10%), even after land-use changes are applied. 
Nonetheless, as a consequence of the modal shift to walking and cycling, increases in 
estimated travel-related physical activity (as measured by METS per week) are observed in 
these cities.
Changes in transport-related particulate emissions due to modal shifts away from private 
vehicles and towards low-emission public transport was observed for all cities. Although 
estimated emissions reduced most notably in the highly motorised cities of Melbourne 
(12%), Boston (12%), London (10%), and Copenhagen (11%), emissions also reduced (to a 
lesser extent) in Delhi (3%) and São Paulo (5%) where VKT transfer from private to public 
transport was proportionately lower.
Table 4 shows the estimated health gains produced by the compact cities model. Health 
gains were observed for all cities for cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and 
diabetes. In addition to the reductions in estimated emissions described above, these figures 
were associated with enhancements to land-use that brought about a modal shift towards 
walking and cycling that resulted in increased transport-related physical activity for all 
cities. The greatest gains in transport-related physical activity were in the highly motorised 
cities of Melbourne (72%) and Boston (56%), where baseline active transport levels were 
low. Transport-related physical activity increases were also observed, albeit to a lesser 
extent, in London (39%), Copenhagen (29%), São Paulo (24%), and Delhi (19%).
Table 4 also reports that road trauma associated with serious deaths and injuries (DALYs per 
100 000 people) was estimated to increase in Melbourne, Boston, and London under the 
compact city scenario. Differences in the other cities were estimated to be marginal or only 
slightly reduced (Delhi; see figure 4). Increases in road trauma DALYs were a direct 
consequence of the modal shift from private vehicles to walking and cycling, which carry a 
higher per kilometre risk of death or injury, even with the application of a safety in 
numbers90 effect estimate. This highlights that while safety in numbers may reduce per 
kilometre risk, it should not be relied upon as a strategy to reduce absolute road trauma.91, 
92
It is important to note that these road trauma estimates are limited to trauma associated with 
motor vehicle crashes. With the exception of São Paulo, the analysis does not include an 
estimate of the risk associated with cycle-only incidents. The inclusion of cycle-only crashes 
would likely add to the burden of road trauma associated with increases in cycle and 
pedestrian deaths and injuries.93 There is also evidence that road deaths and serious injury 
alter as a function of long-term economic growth (see box 2) or short-term economic cycles.
94 Consequently, elements of a city’s economy could attenuate (or amplify) the population 
health outcomes. We have not adjusted the estimates of road trauma for the potential 
economic fluctuations in each of the cities.

 While modal shift toward active transport options resulted in increased road trauma, a 
considerable proportion of the DALYs gained across the chronic diseases in the compact 
cities model was contributed to by policies that encouraged walking and cycling uptake 
rather than land-use changes alone. This was particularly evident in the highly motorised 
cities of Melbourne, Boston, and London and underscores the importance of providing 
additional transport policy, pricing, or regulatory incentives95 to encourage active transport 
if reductions in chronic disease are to be realised. In cities with existing high levels of 
walking and cycling, such as Copenhagen and Delhi, most benefit was gained from land-use 
changes that produced higher rates of walking and cycling rather than the promotion of 
public transport alone.
Understanding the complex relationship between land-use, transport and population 
health
Many countries concerned by costs associated with the mounting burden of lifestyle-related 
chronic disease96 have developed plans and public policy initiatives that encourage greater 
levels of physical activity.97–99 Although the extent to which these plans are successfully 
disseminated, enacted, and monitored varies,100–104 the findings we report here suggest 
that if government policies are going to influence the overall health of growing city 
populations, the policies need to actively pursue land-use planning and urban design 
interventions that encourage a modal shift toward walking, cycling, and low-emissions 
public transport. From rapidly motorising to highly motorised cities, enhancements to urban 
design (such as increased land-use density, increased diversity, and a decrease in average 
distance to low-emission public transport) along with a modal shift of motorised trips to 
active transport options (such as walking and cycling) are essential to limit the rising burden 
of chronic disease associated with transportation systems. However, a move towards a 
compact city to mitigate the growing burden of chronic disease needs to be explored in more 
detail in cities such as Delhi and São Paulo where population density per square kilometre is 
already high. For example, these cities may respond better to other interventions such as 
access to proximate public transport or a mix of local destinations. In this paper, we have 
limited the modelling to a small number of urban and transport planning and design 
interventions and we have limited the outcomes to chronic disease. Infectious disease and 
heat-related mortality and morbidity are also direct consequences of excessive urban 
densities,14, 105 and other interventions (eg, destination accessibility and demand 
management) will be important
Infrastructure investment for vulnerable road users—Despite the estimated health 
gains in chronic disease associated with the compact cities model, the modal shift towards a 
less private motorised transport and increased walking and cycling resulted in small to 
moderate increases in road trauma for Melbourne, London, and Boston. Given this, we 
estimated the extent of separated cycling and walking VKT that would be required to offset 
the estimated increase in DALYs associated with road deaths and serious injuries under the 
compact city scenario (see figure 5).
As shown in figure 5, the more highly motorised cities of Melbourne, Boston, and London 
would need the largest investments in separated pedestrian and cycling infrastructure

 (equivalent to approximately 40%, 30%, and 35% of total pedestrian and cycling VKT, 
respectively) to offset the likely increase in road deaths and serious injuries associated with 
the compact city scenario. In contrast, Delhi, Copenhagen, and São Paulo are estimated to 
require minimal additional infrastructure to see no net increase in injury burden. These 
between-city differences reflect the comparatively high proportion of existing walking and 
cycling in Copenhagen, Delhi, and São Paulo (16%, 13%, and 7%, respectively) and the 
comparatively low level of increased risk associated with the greater number of vulnerable 
road users, which is in part due to the significant proportion of VKT also undertaken using 
public transport (56%, 31%, and 60%, respectively). This is not to say that further reductions 
in road trauma could not be made in these cities with changes to infrastructure, and does not 
mean that increased pedestrian and cyclist deaths would not occur. Instead, increased injury 
among pedestrians and cyclists may be matched by reductions for other transport modes (eg, 
drivers and passengers).
The compact city model presented in this paper presents a macro-level observation of the 
relationships between a limited number of land-use and urban design interventions and 
transport mode choices. The compact city model provides limited insight with respect to the 
interactions between individuals in entire city populations and how these interactions might 
influence transportation patterns and a city resident’s health. While agent-based modelling 
has been used for some time in describing and studying simulated traffic flows in road and 
urban networks,106 expanding the an approach beyond the scope of traffic engineering to 
incorporate aspects of health, safety, and individual behaviour offers great potential for not 
only estimating the health and safety effects of various urban scenarios but also for 
understanding the mechanisms that lead to optimised urban policy and planning settings.
107, 108
We contend that a modal shift that reduces reliance on the private motor vehicle and an 
increased prevalence of walking and cycling (along with connected, accessible, and safe 
public transport) will lead to considerable population health benefits in relation to chronic 
disease. However, without the inclusion of adequate safe infrastructure, the introduction of 
additional cyclists and pedestrians within already highly motorised transport systems is 
likely to increase road trauma. Conversely, the introduction of additional cyclists and 
pedestrians may lead to decreased road trauma in cities with existing lower levels of 
motorization (eg, Delhi) or cities with existing high levels of infrastructure that ensures that 
walking and cycling can be undertaken in an environment of reduced risk (eg, Copenhagen). 
Policies that support walking and cycling within a safe urban environment are paramount to 
achieving gains in overall population health. Moreover, achieving these outcomes will 
require a comprehensive integrated approach, as the first paper in this series has highlighted.

Cars, cities and health: new urban mobility
New urban mobility in which transport policies encourage walking, cycling, and public 
transport while reducing subsidies for private motor vehicle use are being supported by cities 
across many high-income countries.109 Cities such as Helsinki, Finland and Zurich, 
Switzerland have seen modal shifts of significant magnitudes from private motor vehicle use 
Stevenson et al.

 to walking, cycling, and public transport. For example, 52% of Zurich’s daily VKTs are now 
undertaken by either walking or cycling, 19% are undertaken on public transport, and only 
29% are undertaken using a private motor vehicle. The city has achieved this by limiting car 
parking, prioritising trams on road space and deliberately creating congestion with traffic 
signals providing access to streets to only a few cars at a time.88
Cities embracing the new urban mobility are setting ambitious targets to achieve safe and 
sustainable transport over the ensuing years and are building infrastructure to the quality 
previously built for motor vehicles. For example, Helsinki (which is not typical of other 
European cities because it was designed during a period of considerable motorisation) has 
embraced sustainable mobility and is transforming its car-dependent suburbs into denser and 
more walkable mixed-use precincts that are linked to the city centre by rapid and frequent 
public transport.110
Figure 7 illustrates the extensive infrastructure that is being delivered for cycling in Helsinki 
to support its proactive transport policy of achieving a cycling mode share of 15% of VKT 
by 2020.111 Cities that are embracing new urban mobility are doing so knowing that it 
delivers benefits in terms of reduced overall congestion, greater opportunities for multimodal 
travel and greater efficiency. This paper also highlights the considerable health gains that 
residents of these cities may also obtain by adopting low levels of motorised transport.
Many countries concerned by the costs associated with the mounting burden of lifestyle-
related chronic disease96 have put in place plans and public policy initiatives that encourage 
greater levels of physical activity.97–99 Although the extent to which these plans are 
successfully disseminated, enacted, and monitored varies,100–104 the findings reported here 
suggest that government policies need to actively pursue integrated urban and transport 
planning and design interventions (particularly those focused towards achieving more 
compact cities) that support and encourage modal shifts away from private motor vehicles 
towards walking, cycling, and public transport (new urban mobility). This is required if city 
planners are to positively influence the overall health and sustainability of growing cities.

 Box 1
Variation in city plans. In the maps below, Melbourne and Boston (with populations of 
approximately 4·5 million residents each) demonstrate the most grid-like road networks 
designed around the predominant use of motorised transport. In contrast, older cities such 
as London and São Paulo (8 and 12 million residents, respectively) have medium levels 
of motorisation combined with a dense spaghetti-like road network. Copenhagen and 
Delhi (with 0·6 million and 17 million residents, respectively) have sparse road networks 
reflecting low levels of infrastructure dedicated to motorised transport.

 Box 2
The proportion of private motorised transport in cities demonstrates a relationship with 
gross domestic product per person. For cities with a high gross domestic product, uptake 
of private motorised transport is only offset by investment in public transport and active 
transport infrastructure (as in London and Copenhagen). In creating a future transport 
system that enhances both mobility and health, cities such as Delhi and São Paulo have 
the opportunity to invest in public and active transport to reduce reliance on private 
motorised transport and avoid the mobility and negative health consequences that are 
associated with highly motorised cities.
