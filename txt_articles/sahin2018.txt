Abstract
The oviduct/fallopian tube is a crucial organ in the mammalian reproductive tract; it plays a critical role in gamete transportation and
early embryo development. In women, torsion of the fallopian tubes can cause ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. In this study, we
tested the effect of this injury on recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells (BMDCs) to the oviducts of reproductive age female
mice. Bone marrow–derived cells were collected from ubiquitin–green fluorescent protein–positive male mice and transplanted into
wild-type female mice. Ischemia and reperfusion injury was performed in half of the mice, while controls received equivalent surgery
without oviduct injury. Two weeks following injury, recruitment of BMDCs to the oviducts was analyzed in both groups. Ischemia
and reperfusion injury caused a greater than 2-fold increase in BMDC recruitment to the injured oviducts compared to those
without injury. Specifically, the recruitment of BMDCs was localized to the stroma of the oviduct. We demonstrate that IR injury to
oviduct recruits BMDCs to this tissue and suggest that BMDCs have function in the healing process.

Introduction
The oviducts or fallopian tubes (human) are the long, slender,
narrow ducts lined with ciliated epithelia, connecting the ovar-
ies to the uterus via the uterotubal junction in the female repro-
ductive system in mammals. They have a crucial role in
reproductive function in transporting sperm, oocytes, and
embryos. Oocytes fertilize in this organ and the early embryo
is carried to the uterus by peristaltic movement of the fallopian
tube while undergoing the first stages of development. The
oviduct is not simply a transport organ, it also provides the
appropriate environment and nutrition for the embryo.
Injuries to the fallopian tubes in humans are common and
result in tubal dysfunction and infertility. Pelvic infections,
endometriosis, and ectopic pregnancies are the most common
causes of tubal damage and infertility.1 Adnexal torsion is less
common, however may also cause tubal dysfunction and
reduced fertility. In order to repair damaged fallopian tubes,
several regenerating processes occur to sustain the tubal func-
tion and tissue integrity. Resident stem cells found in the fal-
lopian tube are thought to have a role in the healing and
regeneration process. The oviduct/fallopian tube contains a
population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),2,3 and these
MSCs have been successfully used in the treatment of several
pathologies other than tubal injury because of their tissue
regenerative capacities.4,5
Bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs), including MSCs, have
been detected in several organs in the pathological conditions.
They mobilize from bone marrow to support resident reparative
cells where they contribute to tissue repair and regeneration in
these organs.6,7 These cells are found in the endometrium in both
human and animal studies.8,9 Uterine injury induces recruitment
of these cells in the process of tissue regeneration.10 Therefore,
we hypothesized that tissue damage to the oviducts would also
mobilize the BMDCs to aid in repair of tissue damage and play a
critical role in the regeneration of this tissue.

 (Wilmington, Massachusetts) and Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, Maine), respectively. All mice were housed with free
access to food and water and were maintained in a room (21�C
+ 1�C) with a regular 12-hour light/dark cycle (7:00 AM to 7:00
PM) in the Yale Animal Resources Center at Yale University
School of Medicine. All animals were treated under an approved
protocol by Institutional Animal Care and Used Committee.
Mice were acclimated at least 1 week before starting study.
Submyeloablation
Submyeloablation was performed in all animals (n ¼ 12) to
determine BMDC trafficking according to the method
described by Tal et al.11 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri). Briefly, 2 doses of
5-FU (125 mg/kg) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; Gibco, Grand Island, New York) were injected by intra-
peritoneal route. The second dose was injected 5 days after the
first dose. Additionally, stem cell factor (SCF; R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) was used for improving bone marrow
engraftment (150 mg/kg body weight in 2 divided doses).
These SCF doses were administered at 21 and 9 hours before
the second dose of 5-FU. The day after the second dose,
BMDCs obtained from GFP male mice were transplanted into
each 5-FU-treated mouse (25 � 106 cells/mice) by retro-orbital
injection. Due to the toxicity of 5-FU, lethality was assessed
by inspecting cages daily; however, all animals survived the
submyeloablation process.
Extraction of BMDCs and Transplantation
Bone marrow–derived cells were obtained from 3-month-old
male GFP mice as described previously.10 Briefly, bones
(femur, tibia, and humerus) were flushed by using cold PBS.
All bones were flushed until color of the bone turn to white and
collected cells were counted by using light microscope (BX41;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The 25 � 106 unfractionated GFP þ
BMDCs within 100 mL PBS were injected to 6- to 8-week-old
5-FU-treated C57BL/6J wild-type recipient female mice by
retro-orbital injection.
Blood Collection and Flow Cytometry Analysis
Peripheral blood was collected by retro-orbital venipuncture
from the mice 2 weeks after transplantation of BMDCs to deter-
mine the percentage of peripheral blood cells expressing GFP
and confirm the success of BMDC transplantation and engraft-
ment in recipient mice. Blood was collected into EDTA-coated
tubes on ice and diluted with PBS followed by centrifugation at
1500 rpm for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended and
incubated for 10 minutes in red blood cell lysis buffer as per the
manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). The samples were diluted by PBS to stop the reaction
and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellets were
resuspended in PBS and filtered through 70-mm mesh into
tubes specific for flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry
was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting Beck-
man Coulter MoFlo machine (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA)
using the corresponding excitation wavelength for GFP. Gates
were applied to forward/side scatter dot plots to exclude non-
viable cells and cell debris. Data were analyzed using the
software FlowJo V10 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR).
Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury Model in the
Fallopian Tube
Ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury was performed 3 weeks
following BMDC transplantation in the study group (n ¼ 7). A
midline abdominal incision was made under sterile conditions,
then both sides of the oviduct and mesosalpinx were clamped
by using a traumatic vascular clips for 60 minutes (Figure 1).
The oviduct was then reperfused by release of the clips. Both
oviducts were injured in each mouse in the study group. Con-
trol animals received an identical abdominal excision and the
oviducts were identified but not clamped.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Studies
In 2 mice, tissues were harvested 24 hours following IR injury
in order to determine the acute effect of injury. The remaining
mice in both groups (n ¼ 5, study group; n ¼ 5 control group)
were killed at 2 weeks from injury to evaluate the recruitment
of transplanted cells to the oviduct. The oviducts were rapidly
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then embedded
into paraffin. Five-micrometer tissue sections were mounted on
slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
general morphologic analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
was performed to detect GFP and caspase-3 expression. Sec-
tions for IHC were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
through a series of ethanol washes. Slides were boiled in pH
6 sodium citrate to antigen retrieval and incubated with 5%
rabbit serum for GFP and 5% goat serum for caspase-3

black appearance was seen after 60 minutes of ischemia.

 antibody to block nonspecific antigen expression for 30 min-
utes. Then, slides were incubated at 4�C overnight with 1:2000
dilution of goat anti-GFP primary antibody (ab5450; Abcam,
Cambridge, Massachusetts) to identify GFP-positive BMDCs
and 1:300 dilution of rabbit anti-caspase-3 primary antibody
(ab13847; Abcam) to exhibit oxidative damage. The day fol-
lowing, slides were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat
IgG and goat anti-rabbit (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, California) secondary antibodies for 60 minutes at
room temperature, respectively. ABC Vectastain Elite reagents
with DAB (3, 3’-diaminobenzidine) plus hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2; Vector Laboratories) was used for detection of antibody
binding. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Stained sections were captured using Nikon
(Shinagawa, Japan) Eclipse 80i microscope. Colocalization of
GFP and CD45 antibodies in BMDCs recruited to the fallopian
tube was detected by immunofluorescence studies. Tissue sec-
tions mounted on glass slides were incubated with goat anti-
GFP (1:1000 dilution, ab5450; Abcam) and rat anti-CD45
(1:200 dilution; ab25386; Abcam) as primary antibodies for
overnight at 4�C. Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-
goat IgG (1:200 dilution, A11057; Life Technologies, Carls-
bad, California) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey
anti-rat IgG (1:200 dilution, A21208; Life Technologies) were
used as secondary antibodies. Sections were covered with cov-
erslips using Vectashield fluorescent mounting media with
40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories).
Oviduct from GFP transgenic mice was used as a positive
control for the GFP antibody and wild-type spleen for CD45
antibody. Fluorescent images were captured with a laser scan-
ning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5) and analyzed with
Leica LAS-X software program (Buffalo Grove, IL).
Tissue Analysis and Cell Quantification
Bone marrow–derived GFP-positive cells from the donors loca-
lized in both epithelial and stromal regions of recipient’s ovi-
ducts were counted. Multiple high-power confocal microscopy
fields were assessed in each oviduct section, and 3 sections were
evaluated separately from each animal. For evaluation, the total
number of DAPI-positive cells with nuclei was counted in each
section. At least 500 to 1500 cells were counted. Both GFP-
positive and CD45-negative cells were also counted in the same
sections to calculate the proportion of these cells in each animal.
Two independent observes blinded to the treatment group
assessed slides from each animal.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed via GraphPad Prism 6 soft-
ware (GraphPad (La Jolla, CA)). The Shapiro-Wilk test was
used to determine normal distribution. The nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the percentage of
GFP-positive cells in recipient mice bloodstream as well as the
percentage of GFP-positive/CD45-negative cells in the ovi-
duct. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Engraftment of GFP-Positive Cells in the Oviduct
The percentage of GFP-positive cells in the circulation of reci-
pient mice was determined by flow cytometry analysis 2 weeks
after transplantation of BMDCs from male GFP mice. Flow
cytometry analysis evaluated the engraftment of donor cells
in recipient mice and assured adequate and equivalent engraft-
ment after bone marrow transplantation. Two mice were
excluded from the study because of transplantation failure
(<20% GFP-positive cells) after flow cytometry analysis. After
confirmation of successful GFP-positive BMDC transplanta-
tion, mice were randomly divided into 2 groups of equal num-
ber (n ¼ 5 per group). As shown in Figure 2, the number of
GFP-positive cells in the circulation of each group was com-
pared and there were no significant differences.
Tissues were harvested 2 weeks after IR surgery and sections
were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining for general mor-
phological changes in both the groups. Additionally, acute effect
of IR injury was evaluated after 24 hours. Increased vascular
congestion, parenchymal hemorrhages, and edema were detected
in acute tissue sections, but these findings were diminished by 2
weeks after IR injury. Increased inflammatory cell infiltration to
parenchyma was observed in epithelium after 2 weeks of IR
injury, as shown in Figure 3A to D. This injury also induced
apoptosis. Expression ofcaspase-3,a proteasethat mediates apop-
tosis, was increased at 24 hours after the ischemic insult and was
again decreased to normal levels comparable to the control group
by 2 weeks postinjury, as summarized in Figure 3E to H.
Recruitment of donor BMDCs to the oviduct was evaluated
by IHC. Both control and experimental groups were compared to
quantify recruitment of GFP-positive cells. We observed an
increase in GFP-positive cells recruited to oviduct in the IR
injury group compared to the control group. Further, the GFP-
positive cells were recruited specifically to the stromal region of
the oviduct, as shown in Figure 4A and B. Bone marrow–derived
cells contain both immune cells, expected to infiltrate any tissue
after injury, and MSCs. To identify the nonimmune MSCs, we
carried out immunostaining for the pan-leukocyte marker CD45
on these tissue sections. CD45 colocalization studies identified
GFP-positive cells that were CD45 negative. Both injury and
noninjury groups were compared for the number of GFP-posi-
tive/CD45-negative cells recruited to the oviduct. Greater than
2-fold more GFP-positive/CD45-negative cells were recruited to
and engrafted the injured oviduct compared to the noninjured
controls (P ¼ .02), as shown in Figure 4C and E.
Discussion
We describe a role of BMDCs in oviduct tissue repair, perhaps
contributing to healing after IR injury. These BMDCs likely
support tissue healing process. Bone marrow–derived cells
comprise 2 stem cell populations: hematopoietic stem cells,
which can differentiate into all mature blood cell lineages, and
MSCs, which have a high level of plasticity. Bone marrow–
derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSCs) can generate
Sahin et al
3
 mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal cells, including ske-
letal, cardiac muscle, lung, liver, and neuronal cells.12 These
cells circulate in the bloodstream and can be recruited to mul-
tiple organs. They play a role in the normal cell turnover of
many organs and are recruited in higher numbers in response to
disease. Evidence to support this comes from both animal mod-
els and humans transplanted with allogeneic bone marrow stem
cells. Donor cells have been identified in several organs after
male to female or HLA (human leukocyte antigen) mismatch
bone marrow stem cell transplantation.13-15 Our group was the
first to identify a the role of BMDSCs in uterine repair.8 How-
ever, BMDSCs likely have a role in the repair of multiple
organs. Amelioration of several diseases has been reported
after bone marrow transplantation.16 This therapeutic effect
of BMDCs arises from not only plasticity of these cells but
also stimulating the activity of endogenous progenitor cells
by secreting growth factors, immunomodulatory cytokines, and
exosomes.17,18 The healing process typically is immediately
triggered after tissue injury. Injury and blood clot formation
initially triggers platelet activation and the release of a variety
of cytokines and growth factors that in turn trigger the migra-
tion and infiltration of immune cells to the lesions.19 This
inflammatory process and released factors direct circulating
BMDCs to the injured tissues and increase mobilizing of
BMDCs from bone marrow.20 Tissue expression levels of
stromal-derived factor 1 (also termed as CXCL12) and C-X-
C chemokine receptor type 4, in injured tissue and in bone
marrow, respectively, are critical factors in the mobilization
and chemotaxis of BMDCs.21 Regulation of these factors by
injury, inflammation, chemotherapy, or clinical treatment mod-
alities such as G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor)
results in BMDC mobilization and homing.22,23
Studies investigating BMDC recruitment into the uterus
revealed that circulating BMDCs primarily engraft the stroma.
These cells are often initially located in close proximity to
blood vessels, but not in the vascular wall,24,25 in a manner

 similar to what was observed in our study. Donor BMDCs were
initially localized in oviductal stromal area, close to vascular
structures. Samples obtained at a longer time after tissue injury
also contained BMDCs localized in the epithelium, similar to
the long-term results of uterine studies.8,10 Bone marrow–
derived cells reaching the uterus or oviduct through the blood-
stream after injury increases these cells’ viability.26 A decrease
in cell engraftment and cell viability is seen after local injec-
tions in injured tissues.25 This route likely is needed to reach
the primary stem cell niche in these tissues, followed by differ-
entiation into mature or progenitor cells that survive outside of
that niche.
Fallopian tube torsion is a clinical condition that results in
ischemia and is often due to concomitant ovarian torsion and
ovarian pathology. Isolated fallopian tube torsion has been
reported.26 The blood supply to the fallopian tubes ceases after
torsion, resulting in ischemia as modeled here. Tubal detorsion
restores blood supply causing reperfusion damage. Reactive
oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O2
�), H2O2, hypo-
chlorous acid, nitric oxide–derived peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl
radical (OH) damage cell membrane proteins and phospholipids.
The damaged cells induce the activation of chemotaxis and
endothelial adhesion of leucocytes27 and BMDCs.28 Cell death
is inevitable after IR injury. This occurs through both cell necro-
sis and apoptosis. As necrosis in response to IR injury and the
role of stem cells have been previously characterized, here we
chose to evaluate the role of apoptosis and determined that IR
injury affects apoptosis in the oviduct. To exhibit cell damage of
IR injury, we used apoptotic pathway protease caspase-3. Apop-
tosis is induced after reperfusion damage,29 as modeled in our
study. We found that increased apoptosis and high levels of
caspase-3 expression after 24-hour ischemia; however, caspase
expression decreased within 2 weeks after ischemia. An inflam-
matory response was also clearly observed at 2 weeks after
ischemia in the parenchymal area of oviducts. This inflamma-
tory response is a major trigger for recruitment of BMDC.28
In cardiac IR studies, reduced ischemic area and improved
cardiac function were observed after BMDC transplantation.30
Similarly, the effect of the bone marrow–derived stem cells on
tubal healing was investigated by Almasry et al; they showed
improved healing in chemically injured tubal mucosa after
local injection of BMDSCs.31 This healing process was attrib-
uted to the role of BMDSCs in stimulation of resident stem
cells, increasing tissue vascular endothelial growth factor and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels and reducing apoptotic
activity. In addition, they demonstrated to reduce caspase-3
expression levels after BMDSC injection. Similar to our
results, these findings support the antiapoptotic activity of
BMDSCs. Bone marrow–derived cells recruitment to damaged
tubal tissue is part of the normal response to injury and likely
facilitates the healing process.
Conclusion
Ischemia and reperfusion injury increases the recruitment of
BMDCs in oviduct. These cells support tissue healing
processes and are associated with reduced apoptotic activity.
Stem cell treatment after ischemic injury may be useful in
restoring tubal function in women as well.
