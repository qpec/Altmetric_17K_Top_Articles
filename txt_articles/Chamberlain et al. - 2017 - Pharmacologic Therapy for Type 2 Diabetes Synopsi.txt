Description: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annu-
ally updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to pro-
vide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other inter-
ested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the
diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.
Methods: For the 2017 Standards, the ADA Professional Prac-
tice Committee updated previous MEDLINE searches performed
from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise
recommendations based on new evidence. The committee rates
the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of
evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The
Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Com-
mittee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care
professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the
larger clinical community informed revisions.
Recommendations: This synopsis focuses on recommenda-
tions from the 2017 Standards about pharmacologic ap-
proaches to glycemic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

T
he American Diabetes Association (ADA) first re-
leased its Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes for
health professionals in 1989. These practice guidelines
provide an extensive set of evidence-based recommen-
dations that are updated annually for the diagnosis and
management of patients with diabetes. The 2017 Stan-
dards cover all aspects of patient care (1); this guideline
synopsis focuses on pharmacologic approaches for pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND EVIDENCE
GRADING
To develop the 2017 Standards, the ADA Profes-
sional Practice Committee, which comprises physicians,
adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educa-
tors, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, and public
health experts, systematically searched MEDLINE from
1 January 2016 (date of last previous search) to Novem-
ber 2016. The committee revised recommendations
based on the new evidence or, in some cases, to clarify
prior ones or match the strength of the wording to the
strength of the evidence. It also solicited feedback from
the larger clinical community.
The recommendations are rated as A, B, C, or E.
Those with an A rating are based on large, well-
designed, multicenter clinical trials or high-quality
meta-analyses. Recommendations with lower-quality
evidence may be equally important and are based on
well-conducted cohort studies (B rating) or uncon-
trolled studies (C rating). Those assigned an E rating
are consensus recommendations for which there is no
evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may
be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence.
The ADA funds development of the Standards from
its general revenues with no industry support or in-
volvement. Details on the methodology, information
about the committee members and their conflict-
of-interest disclosures, and the complete Standards
can

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR TYPE 2
DIABETES: RECOMMENDATIONS
Metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is
the preferred initial pharmacologic agent for the treat-
ment of type 2 diabetes (A rating). Long-term use of
metformin may be associated with biochemical vitamin
B12 deficiency, and periodic measurement of vitamin
B12 levels should be considered in patients treated with
metformin, especially those with anemia or peripheral
neuropathy (B rating). Providers should consider initiat-
ing insulin therapy (with or without additional agents) in
patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are
symptomatic, have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of
10% or greater, or have a blood glucose level of 16.7
mmol/L (300 mg/dL) or greater (E rating). If noninsulin
monotherapy at the maximum tolerated dose does not
achieve or maintain the HbA1c target after 3 months,
adding a second oral agent, a glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1)–receptor agonist, or basal insulin should be
considered (A rating). For patients with type 2 diabetes
who are not achieving glycemic goals, insulin therapy
should be instituted without delay (B rating). A patient-
centered approach should be used to guide the choice
of pharmacologic agents (E rating).
INITIAL TREATMENT APPROACH: METFORMIN
Metformin monotherapy should be initiated at the
time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for most patients

 unless there are contraindications. It is effective, safe,
and inexpensive and may reduce the risk for cardiovas-
cular events and death (2). A large meta-analysis (3)
supports the use of metformin monotherapy as first-line
therapy. It may be safely used in patients with an esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate as low as 30 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (4); the U.S. label of metformin was recently
revised to reflect its safety in patients with an estimated
glomerular filtration rate of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or
greater (5).
Gastrointestinal side effects are common in pa-
tients receiving metformin. In the authors'experience,
these side effects can be reduced if metformin mono-
therapy is started at a dose of 500 mg once or twice
daily with food and titrated gradually to the maximum
effective dose (2 g/d). Patients should be advised to
stop taking their medication if they experience nausea,
vomiting, or dehydration.
The Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study
found that long-term users of metformin may develop
vitamin B12 deficiency. Periodic testing of vitamin B12
levels
should
be
considered
in
metformin
users,
especially those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy
(6).
USING PHARMACOTHERAPIES OTHER THAN OR
IN ADDITION TO METFORMIN
If the patient does not tolerate or has a contraindi-
cation to metformin, another option should be consid-
ered. The ADA/European Association for the Study of
Diabetes position statement (7) recommends a patient-
centered approach, including assessment of efficacy,
hypoglycemia risk, effect on weight, side effects, cost,
and patient preferences. A table detailing characteris-
tics of all available glucose-lowering agents in the
United States that may guide individualized treatment
choices is available in section 8 of the Standards (8).
Tables 1 and 2 depict the costs of antihyperglycemic
agents that were extracted from the Red Book (9). With
so many choices, patients and providers should be able
to find a mutually agreeable treatment option.
For patients with an HbA1c level of 9% or greater
who are not acutely symptomatic, initiation of dual
combination therapy (Figure 1) should be considered
to more quickly achieve the target HbA1c level. If the
patient has a random glucose level of 16.7 mmol/L (300
mg/dL) or greater or an HbA1c level of 10% or greater
and has acute symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, or

 weight loss, combination therapy that includes insulin
should be considered (Figure 2).
ASSESSING RESPONSE AND DECIDING TO
INTENSIFY THERAPY
Providers should assess whether the HbA1c target
has been achieved within approximately 3 months of
therapy initiation (Figure 1); if it has not, therapy
should be intensified (Figure 2). They should use
shared decision making and a patient-centered ap-
proach when selecting a second agent. Potential com-
bination therapies include a sulfonylurea, thiazolidin-
edione,
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(DPP-4)
inhibitor,
sodium–glucose contransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor,
GLP-1–receptor agonist, or basal insulin. Insulin should
also be considered as part of any combination regimen
for patients with severe hyperglycemia, especially if
symptoms or catabolic features (such as weight loss or
ketosis) are present. Patients should be reassessed
within 3 months for achievement of the HbA1c target.
RECENT EVIDENCE FROM CARDIOVASCULAR
OUTCOMES TRIALS
Major cardiovascular outcomes trials have studied
patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardio-
vascular disease, including EMPA-REG (Empagliflozin
Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus Patients) (10) and the LEADER (Liraglutide Ef-
fect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascu-
lar Outcome Results) trial (11). These 2 studies found
that, compared with placebo and standard treatment,
empagliflozin and liraglutide reduced composite out-
comes for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovas-
cular death in populations in which most, if not all, pa-
tients had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease. Whether other agents in the same class as em-
pagliflozin and liraglutide have similar benefits, and
whether the treatments benefit patients at lower risk for
cardiovascular disease, is unknown.
Cardiovascular outcomes trial data for the DPP-4
inhibitors sitagliptin (12), saxagliptin (13), and alogliptin
(14) showed no statistically significant differences in
rates of major cardiovascular events between treatment
and placebo groups.
RECENT WARNINGS ABOUT
PHARMACOTHERAPIES
In May 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) issued a warning that SGLT-2 inhibitors may
lead to ketoacidosis in the absence of significant hyper-
glycemia (termed “euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis”).
Patients who develop symptoms of ketoacidosis, which
may include dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and abdomi-
nal pain, should stop taking SGLT-2 inhibitors and im-
mediately seek medical attention (15).
In April 2016, the FDA also warned that the DPP-4
inhibitors saxagliptin and alogliptin may increase the
risk for heart failure, especially in patients with preexist-
ing heart failure or renal impairment (16).
INSULIN THERAPY
Diabetes is a progressive condition, and many pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes eventually require and ben-
efit from insulin therapy. Early patient education about
expected
disease
progression,
and
avoidance
of
threats of future insulin therapy (because it makes the
expected transition more difficult), is important. Com-
prehensive education about blood glucose monitoring,
nutrition, and hypoglycemia recognition and treatment
are critical to patients receiving insulin therapy. Em-
powering patients with self-titration algorithms based
on self-monitoring can improve glucose control in
those with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin therapy
(17).
A safe and simple approach is to prescribe 10
units, or 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg of body weight, of basal
insulin per day and advise to increase the dose by 10%
to 15%, or 2 to 4 units, once or twice weekly until the
fasting blood glucose target is met. Insulin is typically

 used with metformin and sometimes 1 additional non-
insulin agent. Cost considerations are important when
an insulin product is selected, particularly because
of substantial price increases over the past decade.
Although newer products cause less hypoglycemia,
intermediate-acting insulin (neutral protamine Hage-
dorn [NPH]) may be a more affordable option for some
patients (18).
Advancing insulin therapy for patients not achiev-
ing HbA1c goals on optimally titrated basal insulin
alone often requires premeal insulin dosing. The rapid-
acting insulin analogues are preferred because of their
quick onset of action. The recommended starting dose
of mealtime insulin is 4 U per meal, 0.1 U/kg per meal,
or 10% of the basal insulin dose per meal if the HbA1c
level is less than 8%. Providers should consider de-
creasing the basal insulin dose by the same amount of
the starting mealtime dose.
Premixed insulin products containing both basal
and bolus insulin are another option for patients who
may benefit from simpler dosing. These contain a fixed
proportion of basal and prandial insulin to target both
fasting and postprandial glycemia. The main disadvan-
tage is that this approach requires a relatively fixed
meal schedule and carbohydrate content per meal.
Concentrated Insulin Products
Several concentrated insulin preparations are avail-
able. The U-500 formulation of regular insulin is, by def-
inition, 5 times as concentrated as the U-100 formula-
Figure 1. Antihyperglycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes: general recommendations.
Start With Monotherapy Unless:
HbA1c level is ≥9%, consider dual therapy. 
HbA1c level is ≥10%, blood glucose level is ≥300 mg/dL, or patient is markedly symptomatic, consider combination injectable therapy.
If HbA1c target not achieved after approximately 3 mo of monotherapy, proceed to 2-drug combination (order not meant to denote any specific preference; choice dependent 
on a variety of patient- and disease-specific factors):
If HbA1c target not achieved after approximately 3 mo of dual therapy, proceed to 3-drug combination (order not meant to denote any specific preference; choice dependent
on a variety of patient- and disease-specific factors):
If HbA1c target not achieved after approximately 3 mo of triple therapy and patient on oral combination, move to basal insulin or GLP-1-RA; if the patient is on GLP-1-RA, 
add basal insulin; or if the patient is on optimally titrated basal insulin, add GLP-1-RA or mealtime insulin. Metformin therapy should be maintained, whereas other oral 
agents may be discontinued on an individual basis to avoid unnecessarily complex or costly regimens (i.e., adding a fourth antihyperglycemic agent).

 insulin being injected is significantly less than U-100
insulins. It may also improve adherence for those who
require large doses of insulin. However, concentrated
insulins may be more expensive than U-100 insulins.
Although U-500 regular insulin is available in both pre-
filled pens and vials, other concentrated insulins are
available only in prefilled pens to minimize the risk for
dosing errors. In July 2016, the FDA approved a dedi-
cated syringe for administering U-500 regular insulin
from vials to help mitigate the risk for dosing errors.
Inhaled Insulin
Inhaled insulin is available for prandial use with a
more limited dosing range. It is contraindicated in pa-
tients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not rec-
ommended for smokers or those who recently stopped
smoking. It requires spirometry to identify potential
lung disease in all patients before and after initiation of
therapy.
Combination Injectable Therapy
If basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable
fasting blood glucose level (or if the dose is >0.5 U/kg
per day) and the HbA1c level remains above target,
combination injectable therapy should be considered
(Figure 2) (6). When this therapy is initiated, metformin
therapy should be continued but other oral agents may
be discontinued on an individual basis to avoid un-
necessarily complex or costly regimens. Sulfonylureas,
DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1–receptor agonists may be
continued or added to basal insulin therapy but are
typically discontinued if a basal bolus or multiple-dose
premixed insulin regimen is used. In patients with sub-
optimal blood glucose control, especially those requir-
ing large doses of insulin, adjunctive use of a thiazoli-
dinedione or SGLT-2 inhibitor may improve control and
reduce the amount of insulin, although potential side
effects should be considered. Once an insulin regimen
is initiated, dose titration is important; dosing adjust-
ments may be necessary in both mealtime and basal
insulins, based on blood glucose level and an under-
standing of the pharmacodynamic profile of each for-
mulation (that is, pattern control).
Further options for treatment intensification in-
clude adding a single injection of rapid-acting insulin
analogue (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) before the largest
meal, adding a GLP-1–receptor agonist, or stopping
basal insulin and starting twice-daily premixed (or bi-
phasic) insulin (such as 70/30 NPH/regular insulin mix,
70/30 aspart mix, or a 75/25 or 50/50 lispro mix). Ad-
ministration is usually before breakfast and before din-
ner. A final option is once- or twice-daily 70/30 deglu-
dec/aspart mix taken before meals. Studies have shown
the noninferiority of basal insulin plus a single injection
of rapid-acting insulin administered at the largest meal
compared with basal insulin plus a GLP-1–receptor ag-
onist or 2 daily injections of premixed insulins (Figure
2). Basal insulin plus a GLP-1–receptor agonist is asso-
ciated with weight loss and less hypoglycemia but may
be more poorly tolerated and expensive than regimens
using insulin alone (19, 20). The FDA recently approved
2 once-daily, fixed-ratio combination products contain-
ing basal insulin plus a GLP-1–receptor agonist—lixisen-
atide plus insulin glargine, and liraglutide plus insulin
degludec. Both approaches have advantages and dis-
advantages. Providers can consider regimen flexibility
when devising a plan for the initiation and adjustment
of insulin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. For
example, rapid-acting insulin offers greater flexibility in
meal planning than premixed insulin. If one regimen
does not achieve HbA1c targets (for example, basal in-
sulin plus a GLP-1–receptor agonist), another regimen
should be considered (for example, basal insulin plus a
single injection of rapid-acting insulin or twice-daily
premixed insulin) (21, 22). Regular insulin and 70/30
NPH/regular insulin mix are less costly alternatives to
rapid-acting and premixed insulin analogues, respec-
tively, but their pharmacodynamic profiles may make
them suboptimal.
Figure 2 also outlines recommendations for further
intensification, if needed, to achieve glycemic goals. If
patients who receive basal insulin plus a single injection
of rapid-acting insulin before the largest meal still ex-
ceed their HbA1c target, they should advance to a
basal–bolus insulin regimen with 2 or more injections
of rapid-acting insulin before meals. Providers should
consider switching patients who receive twice-daily
premixed insulin and still exceed their HbA1c target to
thrice-daily premixed insulin analogues (70/30 aspart
mix or a 75/25 or 50/50 lispro mix). In general, these
analogues have been found to be noninferior to basal–
bolus insulin regimens with similar rates of hypoglyce-
mia (23). If the HbA1c targets are not being met or there
are other patient considerations, providers should con-
sider switching regimens (that is, from thrice-daily pre-
mixed insulin analogue to a basal–bolus insulin regi-
men or vice versa) (21, 22).
