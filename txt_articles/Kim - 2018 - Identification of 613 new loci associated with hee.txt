Abstract
Low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to osteoporosis, and is a risk factor for bone frac-
tures, including stress fractures. Using data from UK Biobank, a genome-wide association
study identified 1,362 independent SNPs that clustered into 899 loci of which 613 are new.
These data were used to train a genetic algorithm using 22,886 SNPs as predictors and
showing a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.415. Combining this genetic algo-
rithm with height, weight, age and sex resulted in a correlation with heel bone mineral den-
sity of 0.496. Individuals with low scores (2.2% of total) showed a change in BMD of -1.16 T-
score units, an increase in risk for osteoporosis of 17.4 fold and an increase in risk for frac-
ture of 1.87 fold. Genetic predictors could assist in the identification of individuals at risk for
osteoporosis or fractures.
Introduction
Low bone mineral density (BMD) is the major determinant for osteopenia and osteoporosis,
which increase the chances of fragility fracture especially for elderly women [1,2]. Low BMD is
also a risk factor for bone fractures, especially stress fracture [3,4]. For athletes and military
personnel undergoing harsh rigors of training, stress fractures, are common injuries that limit
playing time, military effectiveness and competitive success [3,5,6]. BMD can be assessed in
the lumbar spine or femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is a
non-invasive method to assess BMD that is not always widely available. Quantitative ultra-
sound of the calcaneus is a second method to measure BMD (estimated heel BMD, or eBMD).
Quantitative ultrasound is mobile, inexpensive, easy to perform and radiation-free, and can
predict fractures to the same extent as DXA.
Twin- and family-based studies have found that heel BMD has a strong genetic component
with estimates of heritability of 0.45 to 0.82 [7–11]. Previous studies have identified DNA
variants with genetic associations with BMD. Estrada et al. performed a meta-analysis of 17
genome-wide association studies for bone mineral density of the femoral neck or the lumbar

 spine, leading to the identification of 62 SNPs showing genome-wide significant associations
[12]. Maoyyeri et al. and Mullin et al. performed meta-analyses for genetic association with
heel BMD, and identified 9 and 13 SNPs with genome-wide significant associations, respec-
tively [13,14]. Finally, Kemp et al. performed a genome-wide association screen for association
with eBMD using data from an intermediate release from UK Biobank [15]. They identified
307 independent SNPs with genome-wide significant associations to heel BMD that were clus-
tered in 203 loci.
In this study, a genetic association analysis for eBMD was performed on the full release of
data from the UK Biobank. The analysis identified SNPs with independent genome-wide sig-
nificant associations with eBMD and also generated a risk score for low BMD, osteoporosis
and risk of fracture. Knowledge of one’s genetic risk for low BMD could be combined with
clinical risk factors to identify patients, athletes or military personnel at high risk for osteopo-
rosis and fracture, thereby permitting treatment or training protocols to reduce their risk
[16,17].
Results
Identification of DNA variants associated with eBMD
Phenotypic data on eBMD, height, weight, age and sex were obtained from UK Biobank
(Methods)(URLs). Genotypic data for each participant were obtained from UK Biobank [18].
Participants were restricted to those with European ancestry to reduce population stratifica-
tion, and then further filtered as described in Methods. The result was a cohort of 394,929 indi-
viduals with genotype and phenotype data (Table 1). The DNA variants were restricted to
those with a minor allele frequency > 0.001, resulting in a set of 20,259,828 genotyped and
imputed DNA variants from the autosomes and the X chromosome, 1,270 genotyped DNA
variants from the pseudo-autosomal region of the Y chromosome, 265 mitochondrial DNA
variants and 362 HLA loci. The DNA variants in each of these regions of the genome were ana-
lyzed for genetic associations with eBMD.
For the X and autosomal chromosomes, genetic association was determined using a linear
mixed model in order to account for population structure in the cohort (i.e. presence of related
individuals) using LMM-BOLT (Methods)[19]. The model included array batch, sex, age,
height, weight and the leading 10 genomic principal components as covariates. A Q-Q plot of
all tested DNA variants shows a large deviation from a random distribution, indicating that
many variants are likely to have an association with eBMD (Fig 1). There was substantial infla-
tion of the test statistics relative to the null (λGC = 1.59) and the linkage disequilibrium score
regression intercept was 1.21. These results indicate that the majority of inflation is due to
polygenicity rather than population stratification.
In total, 142,417 DNA variants from the autosomes and X chromosome were associated
with eBMD with genome-wide significance (p<6.6x10-9)(S1 Table). For DNA variants in the

 HLA region, the Y chromosome and the mitochondria, genetic associations were analyzed by
linear regression using PLINK2.0 [20]. The linear regression model included height, age, sex
and weight as covariates. None of the DNA variants from the HLA loci, the Y chromosome or
the mitochondria showed genome-wide significant associations with eBMD [20]. Fig 2 shows
a Manhattan plot of the tested SNPs.
Conditional and joint association analysis was used to identify 1,362 DNA variants showing
an independent genome-wide significant association with BMD, using GCTA COJO [21](S2
Table). Most of the independent DNA variants were spaced widely apart from each other, but
some were clustered together suggesting that they were alleles affecting the same genetic locus,
a phenomenon known as allelic heterogeneity. DNA variants were assigned to the same locus
if they were less than 100 kb apart, resulting in 899 genetic loci.
Fig 3 shows the four loci with the strongest associations with eBMD: loci 385, 324, 336 and
89. Locus 385 on chromosome 7 contains 20 independent SNPs with genome-wide significant
associations with eBMD. The sentinel SNP (rs2536196; p = 2.2x10-1653) lies within the WNT16
gene (encodes a WNT signal). Locus 324 is on chromosome 6 and contains six independent

 genome-wide significant SNPs. The SNP with the strongest association to eBMD (rs9482773;
p = 2.6x10-369) is located within the RSPO3 gene (encodes R-spondin 3). Locus 336 is on chro-
mosome 6 and contains 13 independent SNPs with genome-wide associations with eBMD.
The sentinel SNP (rs2982573; p = 1.9x10-354) is located between the CCDC170gene (encodes
Coiled-Coil Domain-Containing protein 170) and the ESR1 gene (encodes Estrogen receptor
alpha). Locus 89 on chromosome 2 contains 4 independent SNPs, with the strongest SNP
(rs11898505; p = 1.4x10-313) lying within the SPTBN gene (encodes Beta spectrin non-erythro-
cytic protein 1).
Since negative selection of alleles with deleterious effects would tend to lower their allele fre-
quency, the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency was examined for the
1362 SNPs with independent associations with eBMD (Fig 4). There was a trend for alleles
with low frequency to have stronger effect sizes, as had been observed previously by Kemp
et al. [15].
Candidate SNPs that may play a causal role in altering eBMD
To find candidate causal variants within each locus, the set of 142,417 genome-wide significant
SNPs were filtered to find DNA variants resulting in changes in either protein sequence or

 expression level. First, 581 DNA variants were identified resulting in alterations to protein
sequence using Annovar (Methods)[22]. From these, 52 were identified that were the sentinel
SNP for their locus and 393 had a p-value comparable to the sentinel SNP (Methods)(S3
Table). These 445 SNPs are candidates for being responsible for genetic association with
eBMD via alteration of the function of a specific protein.
Second, 2,124 SNPs were identified as candidates for mutations leading to changes in
expression of a gene involved in setting eBMD using regulomeDB (S4 Table; Methods)[23].
These SNPs were located within a transcription factor binding region, as defined by Chroma-
tin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing experiments performed by the ENCODE consortium
[24]. The SNPs were also associated with changes in expression of a nearby gene, referred to as
cis Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (cis-eQTLs). DNA variation within a transcription fac-
tor binding site could lead to changes in binding of that transcription factor, which could in
turn result in altered expression of a nearby gene, which could affect eBMD if the gene is
involved in bone density.
Although the 445 protein-altering SNPs and the 2,124 regulatory SNPs are good candidates
for being causal mutations for altering eBMD, it should be noted that these DNA variants

 might instead be passive bystanders that are correlated with eBMD but do not causally change
it. For instance, there might be a rare SNP that is currently undiscovered and tightly linked to
one of these candidate SNPs that is the true causal mutation; an example of this can be seen in
SNPs associated with human height where protein coding SNPs are linked to regulatory SNPs
[25].
Validation of previous associations with eBMD
The results from this study were compared to previous genome-wide association studies of
BMD. Estrada et al. performed a meta-analysis for genetic association to bone mineral density
of the femoral neck or the lumbar spine, and identified 62 SNPs showing genome-wide signifi-
cant associations [12]. Of these, 57 SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank data as they had
beta values in the same direction and p-values below p = 8x10-4, which is the cutoff for Bonfer-
roni significance (S5 Table). Maoyyeri et al. performed a meta-analysis for genetic association
with eBMD, and identified nine SNPs with genome-wide significant associations [13]. All nine
of the previously-identified SNPs were strongly replicated using the UK Biobank data, with
beta values in the same direction and p�5.9x10-71 in every case (S5 Table). Mullin et al. identi-
fied 13 SNPs with genome-wide significant associations to eBMD [14]. Of these, all 13 were
validated in this study; in 12 cases, the identical SNP was validated and in one case, the specific
SNP was missing but a nearby proxy SNP showed an association (S5 Table). Finally, Kemp
et al. performed a genome-wide association screen for association with eBMD using data from
an intermediate release from UK Biobank (142,487 individuals)[15]. Their study identified
307 independent SNPs with genome-wide significant associations to eBMD located in 203
loci. Since half of the data from this current study overlap the data from Kemp et al., the data
from this study are not an independent test but can be used to support the general trends from
Kemp et al. Using data from the current study, 274 of the 307 previously-identified SNPs had
beta values in the same direction and p-values below 1.6x10-4 (i.e. Bonferroni cutoff) for asso-
ciation with eBMD (S5 Table). For another 30 of the previously-identified SNPs, the specific
SNP was not included in the present study but there was a SNP within 100 kb that had a signif-
icant p-value and beta values in the same direction. In total, 304 of the 307 SNPs previously-
identified by Kemp et al. were supported by the data in this current study, either using the
direct SNP itself or a proxy SNP. Of the 899 loci identified in this work, 286 were identified in
one of the previous three studies and 613 are new.
Genetic association with bone fracture
Since low bone mineral density is a risk factor for bone fracture [26], a genetic association
analysis was performed for incidence of fracture. There were 59,378 participants in the UK
Biobank that had any type of bone fracture and 348,296 controls; the cases of fracture were
identified by self-reported responses to a questionnaire (47,494 individuals) or by inpatient
electronic health records (23,686 individuals)(S6 Table). Linear mixed modeling was used to
assess genetic association with bone fracture using the same covariates as was used for eBMD
(array batch, height, weight, age, sex and the first 10 principal components)(Methods). Of the
142,417 SNPs showing a genome-wide significant association to eBMD, 1,523 SNPs (1.1%)
showed a significant association to bone fracture (using p = 3.56x10-7 as a cutoff for Bonferroni
significance)(S1 Table).
Polygenic risk score for bone mineral density, osteoporosis and bone fracture
The genetic association data were used to construct risk scores to predict bone mineral density,
risk for osteoporosis or risk for fracture. Three methods were tried: 1) a polygenic risk score

 (PRS) using the beta values from genome-wide significant SNPs, similar to the method used in
Estrada et al. [12], 2) a Bayesian approach that estimates effect sizes for each variant based on
its summary statistics for association with eBMD (LDpred) and 3) a least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator method (LASSO) to select predictors and calculate their weights.
In the first method, the cohort was split into a training set (350,000 individuals) and a
validation set (44,924 individuals). Linear mixed modeling was used to identify 121,536 SNPs
with genome-wide significant associations with eBMD (i.e. p<6.6x10-9). From these SNPs,
conditional and joint association analysis was used to identify 1,182 SNPs with independent
genome-wide significant associations to eBMD (Methods). A polygenic risk score (termed the
GWS_PRS) was created where the score is the sum of the number of effect alleles weighted by
the beta coefficient for each of the 1,182 independent SNPs (Table 2).
For generating genetic risk scores for highly polygenic traits, prior studies have shown that
restricting predictor SNPs to those that have genome-wide significance is too restrictive, as
many SNPs with weaker p-values are still informative [21,27]. Regression analysis can be
used to select SNPs with p-values below the genome-wide significant cutoff, where the infor-
mation from the aggregate set of SNPs is informative even though the reliability of each
individual SNP is less than that of genome-wide significant SNPs. The second (LDpred) and
third (LASSO) methods both use a large number of predictor SNPs, including those with p-
values below genome-wide significance, in order to generate a PRS for bone mineral density
[19,28].
LDpred uses a Bayesian approach that estimates effect sizes for each variant based on its
summary statistics for association with eBMD, as modified by linkage disequilibrium between
it and other SNPs from a reference panel (Methods)[19]. The summary statistics were gener-
ated using linear mixed modeling from 350,000 participants, and then validated on the
remaining 44,924 individuals. The PRS generated by LDpred is dependent on a variable indi-
cating the fraction of SNPs showing a non-zero association with BMD. This variable is not
known, and so it was set to one of nine values between 10−4 and 1. This resulted in the genera-
tion of seven PRS’s for eBMD, each containing effect sizes for 1,497,447 SNPs (Table 2).
The third training method used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO) to select predictors and calculate their weights, using PLINK1.9 [20]. For this
method, the UK Biobank cohort was divided into three parts: discovery of candidate SNPs
(cohort A), training genetic algorithms (cohort B) and independent validation of PRS’s (cohort
C). Previous work on height prediction has shown that peak performance using LASSO
required ~100,000 candidate SNPs derived from cohort A and a training set including
>150,000 individuals from cohort B [29]. Hence, the UK Biobank cohort was divided into
cohort A (50,000 individuals), cohort B (300,000 individuals) and cohort C (remaining, 44,924
individuals).
In the first step (discovery), linear mixed modeling was used on cohort A to generate p-val-
ues for association with eBMD in a manner similar to before. A p-value threshold of 3x10-3
was selected as there were a total of 154,990 candidate SNPs with p-values at or below this
threshold, similar to the number of candidate SNPs used previously for height prediction [29].
From the set of candidate SNPs from the first step, LASSO was used to select a subset to use
as predictors; specifically, Affymetrix chip type, sex, age, weight, height and ten principal com-
ponents were used as covariates in the LASSO calculations using data from cohort B. Different
values of the lambda penalty variable for LASSO were used, each resulting in a PRS with a dif-
ferent number of predictors. The range of lambda penalties was determined by testing the
PRS’s for prediction of BMD on the validation set, and ensuring that the lambda values
spanned the maximum performance (see below). In all, eight lambda values were tested, result-
ing in PRS’s consisting of between 1,306 and 131,004 predictors (Table 2). The risk score for

predictor, and then summing over all of the predictor SNPs.
Prediction of ebone mineral density and osteoporosis by polygenic risk
scores
Osteopenia and osteoporosis are diagnosed when BMD T scores are below -1.0 and -2.5,
respectively. In the testing step, each of the polygenic risk scores was tested against BMD as
well as the risk for osteoporosis. For the PRS using 1,182 SNPs with independent genome-
wide significant associations with BMD (GWS_PRS), the correlation with eBMD was 0.370
(Table 2). The nine PRS’s generated using LDpred showed correlations with eBMD ranging
from 0.084 to 0.305 (Table 2).
Finally, the eight PRS’s generated using LASSO were compared to eBMD for individuals in
cohort C. The LASSO4 (22,886 predictors) PRS showed the highest correlation with eBMD
(R = 0.415). Polygenic risk scores with either more or less predictors showed lower correlations
(Table 2).
The PRS’s derived here were compared to the one used in work published previously [12].
The Estrada PRS is based on the beta values from 63 SNPs found to have a genome-wide sig-
nificant association with femoral neck or lumbar spine BMD. The Estrada PRS showed a cor-
relation of -0.143 with eBMD from cohort C, which is weaker than the correlations from the
PRS developed in this work (Table 2). The Estrada risk score has a negative correlation because
the beta coefficients were based on the effect for decreasing BMD, whereas the coefficients
used in this study were based on the effect for increasing BMD. The lower performance of the
Estrada PRS might be caused by the smaller number of SNPs used in the scoring algorithm (63
predictors versus 22,886 predictors used by LASSO4) or because the risk score from Estrada
et al. was based on SNPs associated with BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine, rather
than the heel.
LASSO4 had the highest correlation with eBMD of any of the PRS’s, and hence was
selected for further analysis. Fig 5A shows that the predictors used in LASSO4 contain many

weak predictors in the LASSO4 algorithm contributes to its performance even though some

 of the individual SNPs may be false positives. Fig 5B shows the cumulative contribution of
each predictor to the LASSO4 algorithm. The predictors were ranked according to their effect
size, and the cumulative effect was tallied. The algorithm shows a rapid rise in cumulative
score from the top predictors, with 50% of the total effect contributed by the top 21% of pre-
dictors (4,885/22,886). The cumulative score plateaus at approximately 20,000 predictors,
consistent with the result that adding additional predictors to the algorithm did not improve
its performance.
Individuals from cohort C were placed into bins according to their LASSO4 scores, and
then the average eBMD was determined (Fig 6A). There was a strong upward trend for eBMD
with increasing PRS. Individuals in the lowest bin (2.2% of the total) had eBMD measurements
with an average T-score of -1.37 (-0.94 to 2.81; 95% CI), which was 0.934 T-score units lower
than the middle bin (0. 927 to 0.942; 95% CI)(Fig 6A). Individuals in the highest bin had an
average eBMD score that was 0.73 T-score units higher (-1.49 to 2.96; 95% CI) than the
median.
A second approach to assess the LASSO4 PRS is to compare it to risk for osteoporosis, as
osteoporosis is diagnosed when BMD T-scores are less than -2.5. There was a sharply decreas-
ing trend for osteoporosis risk with increasing LASSO4 scores (Fig 6B). Specifically, individu-
als in the lowest bin for LASSO4 (2.2% of individuals) had a risk for osteoporosis that was 6.19
times higher than the middle bin (6.18 to 6.20; 95% CI). Individuals in the highest bin had a
risk for osteoporosis of 0.221 (0.218 to 0.224; 95% CI) relative to the median.
Besides genetic differences, eBMD is affected by height, weight, age, sex and ancestry. To
determine the effect of these factors on eBMD, a risk score using only these four covariates was
generated using data from cohort B. Specifically, linear regression for eBMD was used to deter-
mine significance and assign beta values to height, weight, age, sex and the first ten principal
components. The regression coefficients for height, weight, age and sex were all highly signifi-
cant (p<2x10-16) but none of the principal components for ancestry had a significant associa-
tion. A risk score using height, weight, age and sex (named Covar score) was calculated for
individuals in cohort C and compared to their eBMD. The correlation between the Covar risk

 score and eBMD was 0.251, which is lower than the correlation between the LASSO4 PRS and
eBMD (R = 0.415)(Table 2).
The LASSO4 PRS was combined with physiological covariates to determine if there was an
improvement in the ability to predict ebone mineral density. Specifically, the LASSO4 score
was added to Affymetrix chip type, height, age, weight, sex and 10 principal components in a
linear regression for ebone mineral density, using individuals from cohort B. This showed that
sex, age, height, weight and LASSO4 had significant associations with eBMD (each with
p < 2x10-16), and determined the beta values for each covariate. The combined algorithm
using LASSO4, height, weight, age and sex (termed the BOG risk score, for BMD Osteoporosis
Genetic risk score) was used to calculate scores for each person in cohort C, and the scores
were compared to their observed eBMD. The BOG score showed a correlation of 0.496 with
eBMD, which is higher than the correlation using either the LASSO4 or Covar risk scores
alone (Table 2). This result indicates that the BOG score explains about 24.6% of the variance
in eBMD.
Individuals from cohort C were placed into bins according to their BOG scores, and each
bin was compared to eBMD and risk for osteoporosis (Fig 7A and 7B). Individuals in the low-
est bin (2.2% of total) had an average eBMD measurement of -1.60 T-score units (-3.05 to 0.15;
95% CI), which is 1.16 T-score units lower than the middle bin (1.15 to 1.17; 95% CI). The low-
est bin had a risk for osteoporosis that was 17.37 times higher than the middle bin (17.35 to
17.38; 95% CI).
Prediction of risk for fractures by genetic risk scores
Since low bone mineral density is a risk factor for bone fracture [26,30,31], the risk scores for
eBMD were compared to incidence of fracture. There were 59,378 participants in the UK Bio-
bank that had bone fracture of any type; the cases of fracture were identified by self-reported
responses to a questionnaire (47,494 individuals) or by inpatient electronic health records
(23,686 individuals)(S6 Table). The incidence of fracture data was not used to either select
SNPs or to train the genetic risk scores, so the genetic risk scores were tested on the entire gen-
otyped UK Biobank population.

 Using the LASSO4 and BOG algorithms, the score for each genotyped individual in the UK
Biobank cohort was calculated. For LASSO4, individuals in the lowest bin had a 1.52 fold
increased risk for bone fracture relative to the middle bin (1.51–1.53; 95% CI)(Fig 6C). Indi-
viduals in the highest LASSO4 bin had a relative risk of fracture of 0.590 (0.584–0.596; 95%
CI). For BOG, individuals in the lowest bin had a 1.88 fold increased risk for bone fracture rel-
ative to the middle bin (1.87 to 1.88; 95% CI)(Fig 7C).
Although the BOG risk algorithm has a robust ability to identify a subset of individuals
with higher risk of osteoporosis and fracture, its overall ability to discriminate cases from con-
trols is modest. For instance, the first BOG bin has a risk of osteoporosis and fracture of 9.6%
and 21.8%, indicating that most are unaffected (i.e. false negatives). Fig 8 shows Receiver

 Operator curves and box plots for LASSO and BOG scores for osteoporosis. For BOG, the
area-under-the-curve for osteoporosis and fracture are 0.782 and 0.570, respectively (S7
Table). By comparison, the area-under-the-curve for fracture using eBMD as a predictor is
0.600. The box plots show that the BOG scores are higher for osteoporosis than controls. The
discrimination slope is the difference in mean BOG values between controls and cases; for
osteoporosis and fractures, the discrimination slope is -0.674 and -0.149, respectively (S7
Table). The discrimination slopes show that there is a statistically significant decrease in BOG
score in cases compared to controls for osteoporosis and fractures.
Discussion
A genetic association study was performed for eBMD using the full release of data from UK
Biobank including 394,929 individuals. A total of 1,362 independent SNPs were identified
with a genome-wide significant association to eBMD. These SNPs clustered into 899 loci, of
which 286 were previously identified and 613 are new. Consistent with previous results, this
study shows that part of the genetic basis for the eBMD phenotype is polygenic, with many
common variants contributing small effects [12,13,15]. Sequencing results have previously
shown that eBMD is also influenced by rare variants, such as rs11692564 near the EN1 gene
[32].
A high percentage of previously-identified SNPs were validated using the data from this
study. Specifically, Maoyyeri et al. and Mullin et al. collectively identified a total of 22 SNPs
with a genome-wide association to eBMD, and all were strongly validated in this study [13,14].
Estrada et al. performed a genetic association study for BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral
neck using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [12]. Of the 62 genome-wide significant
SNPs that were identified, 57 were validated in this study. The SNPs that were not validated
might be false positives, might reflect differences in bone structure measured by DXA versus
QUS, or might be specific for different anatomical sites (spine or hip vs the heel). Kemp et al.
identified SNPs with a genome-wide specific association with eBMD using UK Biobank data
that partially overlapped the data from this study, so the analyses are not independent [15].
Nevertheless, 304 of the 307 SNPs identified by Kemp et al. showed a significant association to
eBMD in this study. This observation shows that nearly all of the original associations were
maintained following the addition of new data.
The BOG risk score was developed to predict levels of eBMD, risk of osteoporosis and risk
of fracture. This algorithm includes genotype information from 22,886 DNA predictors along
with four physiological parameters (height, weight, age and sex). The correlation with eBMD
for the BOG algorithm was 0.496, which is higher than the correlations achieved using the
22,886 predictors (R = 0.415) or the four covariates (R = 0.251) alone. This result emphasizes
the importance of combining DNA information with physiological factors to predict risk for
low BMD or injury. The correlation of the BOG score with eBMD was also higher than the
correlation using 1,182 SNPs from this study (R = 0.370) or 63 SNPs from a prior study (R =
-0.143) that have genome-wide significant associations with BMD [12]. The BOG algorithm
explains about 24.6% of the variance in eBMD levels. By comparison, the algorithm developed
by Estrada et al. explained about 2.0% of the variance in BMD levels in this study, and 5.8% of
the variance in elderly women from a previous study [12].
Individuals with low BOG scores were found to have lower eBMD levels (-1.16 T-score
units) than the median BOG score. The identification of a group of individuals with low aver-
age eBMD may be clinically important as osteopenia is diagnosed with T-scores ranging from
-1.0 to -2.5 and osteoporosis is diagnosed with T-scores below -2.5. Specifically, individuals
with low BOG scores had a 17.4 fold increased risk for osteoporosis compared to the median

 BOG score. Finally, low BOG scores were associated with 1.88 fold higher risk for bone frac-
tures than the median BOG values. Using the algorithm developed by Estrada et al. and tested
on elderly women, individuals with the highest risk score had a decrease in BMD levels of 0.33
units, an increase in risk for osteoporosis of 1.56 fold and an increase in risk for fracture of
1.60 fold, compared to the median risk score [12].
Although the BOG algorithm identifies rare individuals at risk for low BMD, osteoporosis
and fracture (i.e. those in the lowest bin), its ability to discriminate cases from controls in the
overall population is modest. Using osteoporosis as an example, about 90% of individuals with
BOG scores in bin 1 (the high risk bin) are unaffected (false negatives) and about 0.1 to 0.5%
of individuals in bins 8–15 (lower risk bins) have osteoporosis (false positives). The area-
under-the-curve for predicting osteoporosis or fracture by the BOG algorithm is 0.78 and 0.57,
respectively.
BMD defines the cutoff for osteoporosis and is the strongest risk factor for fracture [33,34].
Having a prior fracture is also a strong risk factor for having an additional fracture [35,36].
These two factors and 7 additional clinical risk factors have been incorporated into the FRAX
index, which is widely used to predict risk of fracture [34,37,38]. The genetic markers identi-
fied in this study have greatest utility when BMD, prior fracture history and FRAX score are
not known. Genome-wide genotype information is becoming routinely available for large
numbers of people due to various precision medicine initiatives. In contrast to genotype infor-
mation, BMD and FRAX assessment are not routinely measured for the general population.
Hence, an algorithm such as the BOG risk score might be useful to screen the general popula-
tion in order to identify individuals that warrant closer examination, such as BMD measure-
ment via DXA.
The BOG risk score could be used to predict injury similar to the way that clinical genetics
is used to predict disease. With clinical genetics, individuals carrying a risk allele at the disease
locus are rare, but the effect of the risk allele is large. For instance, mutations in the BRCA2
gene occur in about 0.2% of women and result in about a seven-fold increase in the lifetime
risk of breast cancer [39]. Likewise, with the BOG algorithm, individuals with a low risk score
are rare (2.2%), but the effect of the score on risk for low BMD, osteoporosis and fracture can
be substantial (e.g. 17-fold increase of osteoporosis). Using the BOG score developed here, the
cumulative effects of 22,886 SNPs are summed, enabling the identification of rare individuals
with a high number of risk alleles. The effect of each individual SNP is inconsequential but the
cumulative effect from all of the SNPs can be large. In this fashion, the BOG risk score converts
common SNPs with weak effects to a rare genetic score with a large effect.
One limitation is that this study only included participants of European ancestry regardless
of their level of physical activity. The results of this study should be validated for other ancestry
groups. The results should also be validated in a cohort where all are physically active, such as
athletes and military personnel. Physical activity has a large effect on BMD and fracture.
Weight-bearing exercises increase one’s bone mineral density, but also increase one’s chance
of bone fractures (due to falls or collisions), including stress fractures due to repetitive training.
Athletes and military personnel have much higher risks of stress fractures than the overall UK
Biobank cohort due to the harsh demands of physical training [3,4].
The genetic association analysis for BMD was limited to the heel. The effects of the SNPs
identified in this study on BMD for other anatomical sites (such as the lumbar spine or femoral
neck) are unclear. From a previous study of genetic associations with the femoral neck and
lumbar spine BMD, most but not all of the SNPs were associated with BMD at diverse sites,
but a few were specific for BMD for either the lumbar spine or femoral neck [12].
Widespread genetic testing using the BOG risk score could identify individuals with
increased risk for low BMD, osteoporosis or fracture. This could identify individuals that

 should undergo further testing, especially tests to directly measure BMD. For elderly women,
this could identify individuals with osteoporosis, thereby enabling steps to be taken to prevent
fragility fractures before they occur. For athletes and military personnel, genetic testing could
be used to identify those at risk for bone fractures, including stress fractures. For elite athletes,
bone/stress fractures can interrupt training, cause important competitions to be missed and
can thus be a disadvantage against competitors. For elite military personnel, bone/stress frac-
tures can reduce military effectiveness, prevent completion of training, and increase the overall
cost of training. Hence, the impact of bone/stress fractures on competitive success for athletes
and physical performance for military personnel can have significant consequences beyond
their impact on health. Genetic testing could inform athletes and military personnel about
their risk of injury, enabling preventative diet, exercise and training regimens to be used before
injury occurs.
Methods
Phenotypes
Data on eBMD for 394,929 individuals were obtained from UK Biobank (URLs). Calcaneal
quantitative ultrasound data (QUS) were obtained from UK Biobank, as described in Kemp
et al. [15]. Heel bone mineral density (eBMD) was estimated based on an ultrasound measure-
ment of the calcaneus by UK Biobank. The T-score is the number of standard deviations for
bone mineral density relative to the mean. Consistent with the criteria established by Kemp
et al., individuals were excluded that exceeded the following thresholds for eBMD: males,
�0.18 or �1.06 g/cm2; females �0.12 or �1.025 g/cm2 [15]. Further details on these methods
are publicly available on the UK Biobank website (URLs).
The gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis is to measure BMD with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA). QUS gives results comparable to DXA and can also be used as a pre-
screening tool for cases of osteoporosis validated by DXA. In this study, osteoporosis cases
were identified as participants with BMD T-scores below -2.5 from cohort C using QUS.
There were 455 cases of osteoporosis and 28,819 controls.
Incidence of fracture was obtained from two sources. The first was from a questionnaire
regarding self-reported incidence of fracture in the past five years. Individuals were excluded if
they responded “Do not know” or “Prefer not to answer”. There were 47,494 individuals with
fracture and 451,457 controls identified from the questionnaire. The second source was from
in-patient electronic health records based on fracture diagnoses using the 10th revision of the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10)
code. The list of codes and number of individuals diagnosed with that code are shown in S5
Table. There were 23,686 individuals identified by their electronic health records. In total,
there were 59,378 participants in the UK Biobank that had any type of bone fracture.
Data on height, weight, age and sex were obtained from UK Biobank (URLs). Height,
weight and age refer to values at the time of enlistment. Age was calculated from the date of
enlistment and the participant’s birthday. Sex was determined by genotype.
Genotypes
Genotype data for 488,378 participants were obtained from the v3 release of UK Biobank [18].
The genotypes of the UK Biobank participants were assayed using either of two genotyping
arrays, the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom or Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array. Genotype
data were imputed centrally by UK Biobank with IMPUTE2 using the Haplotype Reference
Consortium and the UK10k+ 1000GP3 reference panels [40]. Metrics for quality control were
established and then used to filter DNA variants by UK Biobank [18]. HLA genotypes were

 determined by UK Biobank [18]. Bycroft et al. describe the full details regarding genotyping of
the UK Biobank participants [18]. Variants were excluded that failed UK Biobank quality con-
trol procedures in any of the genotyping batches, that showed a departure from Hardy-Wein-
berg of P<10−50, or that had a MAF < .001. The resulting list contained 20,259,828 genotyped
and imputed DNA variants.
Individuals were excluded who were identified by the UK Biobank as outliers based on
either genotyping missingness rate or heterogeneity, whose sex inferred from the genotypes
did not match their self-reported sex, who withdrew from participation or who were not of
European ancestry.
GWAS analysis
To search for genetic association with eBMD while taking into account population structure in
the UK Biobank cohort (e.g. presence of related individuals), LMM-BOLT was used to per-
form a Linear Mixed Model [19]. Specifically, the model takes the form
y ¼ X B þ g þ E
where y is the vector of eBMD, X is the matrix of fixed effects, and β is the effect size of these
fixed effects. Fixed effects included sex, array batch, age, height, weight, and the leading 10
genomic principal components as computed by UK Biobank. g is the polygenic effect that
captures the population structure. The Genomic Relationship Matrix (GRM) was computed
using common (MAF > 0.001) genotyped variants that passed quality control. E is a residual
effect not accounted for by the fixed and random effects. To account for the large number of
SNPs in the UK Biobank release, a threshold of 6.6x10-9 was used for genome-wide signifi-
cance, as established by Kemp et al. [15]. Upon acceptance, summary statistics for all SNPs
from the linear mixed model will be made available at NIH GRASP: https://grasp.nhlbi.nih.
gov/FullResults.aspx.
Genetic association with bone fracture was assessed by linear mixed modeling using LMM-
BOLT [19]. The fixed effects were the same as those used for eBMD. The Genomic Relation-
ship Matrix was computed similarly to the GRM for eBMD.
Linear regression was used to search genotyped DNA variants from the pseudo-autosomal
region of the Y chromosome, mitochondrial DNA variants and HLA loci for associations with
eBMD. Co-variates included sex, array batch, age, height, weight, and the leading 10 genomic
principal components as computed by UK Biobank. To prevent errors caused by relatedness
among the individuals in the UK Biobank cohort, the analysis was restricted to unrelated indi-
viduals, defined as those that were used to define the principal component values by UK Bio-
bank [18]. Linear regression was performed with PLINK2.0 [20].
Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) and Manhattan plots were generated in R using the qqman pack-
age [41]. The lambda genomic control and LD score regression intercept were calculated using
LMM-BOLT [19]. Locus plots were created using LocusZoom [42]. The chromosomal loca-
tions and annotation of SNPs were determined using Annovar [22]. The effects of missense
SNPs on protein function were analyzed using SIFT and POLYPHEN2 [43,44]. Missense SNPs
were included as potential causal variants if the log of their p-value was within 50% of the log
of the p-value for the sentinel SNP. Regulatory SNPs were identified using data from ENCODE
[24], as reported by RegulomeDB [23].
DNA variants showing an independent genome-wide-significant association with eBMD
were identified using GCTA COJO [21]. They were then assigned to a chromosomal locus,
defined as a region where the gap between independent genome-wide significant DNA vari-
ants was less than 100 kb.

 Polygenic risk scores for eBMD, osteoporosis and bone fracture
LDpred was used to calculate the posterior mean effect size for each variant based on summary
p-values from linear mixed modeling and subsequent shrinkage based on the extent to which
the variant was correlated with similarly associated variants in the UK Biobank population
[19]. The summary statistics for association with ebone mineral density were obtained using
linear mixed modeling on 350,000 individuals. SNPs with p-values less than 0.1 were selected
for analysis in order to reduce computational memory requirements. The linkage disequilib-
rium data were obtained from 50,000 European individuals. LDpred includes a variable indi-
cating the fraction of markers that have non-zero effect sizes. The default values included in
the LDpred package were used: 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, .0003 and .0001. The LDpred
package also removes SNPs with ambiguous strand or minor allele frequency less than 1%.
The resulting LDpred risk scores included effect sizes for 1,497,447 SNPs.
PLINK1.9 was used to perform the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
[20]. LASSO requires an estimate of heritability (h2) as input, which was calculated using BOL-
T-REML from cohort A [19]. Different values of the penalty parameter, lambda, were used
resulting in different numbers of predictors. The genetic algorithms contain a set of predictors
with the effect allele and a beta coefficient for the effect allele. Score is calculated by weighting
each effect allele by its beta coefficient, and then summing over all effect alleles. Effect alleles
associated with an increase in BMD have positive beta coefficients, and vice versa when the
effect allele has a negative association.
In the testing step, the genetic risk algorithms were used to calculate scores for individuals
in cohort C. The correlation between the genetic risk scores and observed eBMD was calcu-
lated using R.
LASSO4 was selected for further analysis to determine whether the algorithm could be
strengthened by combining it with height, weight, age and sex. The beta values for these factors
were used to generate a combined risk score termed the BOG (BMD Osteoporosis Genetic)
risk score. Individuals were placed into bins based on the risk scores. The 95% confidence
interval was calculated using the modified Wald method. The area-under-the-curve for each of
the risk scores was calculated using the pROC package in R (URLs).
