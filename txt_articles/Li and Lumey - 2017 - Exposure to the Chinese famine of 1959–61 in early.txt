Abstract
Background: Most Chinese people over 55 years old today have experienced the Great
Leap Forward Famine of 1959–61. Many reports suggested that the famine could have
profound long-term health effects for exposed birth cohorts. A systematic review and
meta-analysis was carried out to summarize reported famine effects on long-term health.
Methods: Relevant reports were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Chinese
Wanfang Data and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Long-term
health conditions were compared in exposed birth cohorts and unexposed controls.
Fixed-effects models and random-effects models were used to combine results on adult
overweight, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, the metabolic syn-
drome and schizophrenia. The heterogeneity across reports was assessed. Subgroup
analyses were carried out using reported famine severity, provincial mortality during
famine, sex and other report characteristics.
Results: In all, 36 reports were eligible for systematic review and 21 could be used for
meta-analysis. The number of events we analysed ranged from 1029 for hyperglycaemia
to 8973 for hypertension. As reported by others, overweight, type 2 diabetes, hypergly-
caemia, the metabolic syndrome, and schizophrenia were more common among adults
born during the famine compared with controls born after the famine. By contrast, there
were no increases in overweight [odds ratio (OR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27–
1.72], type 2 diabetes (OR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.73–1.28), hyperglycaemia (OR 0.99; 95% CI:
0.72–1.36) or the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00–1.22) comparing adults
born during the famine with controls born either after or before the famine. For schizo-
phrenia, the effect estimates (OR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.50–1.70, combining control groups)
were similar in the two scenarios.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that uncontrolled age differences between famine
and post-famine births could explain most effects commonly attributed to the famine.

 For more reliable estimates of long-term famine effects in China, other analyses will be
needed with age-appropriate controls and better information on the severity and timing
of the famine in the populations included.

Introduction
The rapidly increasing burden of chronic disease is a major
public health challenge for emerging economics across the
world, including China.1–3 Common factors contributing
to this problem, especially among the large number of
populations experiencing growing prosperity, are increases
in smoking, unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles, all
leading to adverse health outcomes.3,4 There may be add-
itional risk factors in China however, given its specific
history.
China experienced the Great Leap Forward Famine in
1959–61. With an estimated number of 15–43 million ex-
cess deaths, this is the worst famine in human history.5–9
Most Chinese over age 55 today have been exposed to the
famine at some point in their early life. Animal and human
studies suggest that the famine could have a substantial
long-term impact on the burden of chronic diseases,10,11
and some relationships between early-life undernutrition
and adverse health outcomes in later life have been well
documented.10 For type 2 diabetes, a 50% increase was
seen at the population level among Ukrainian men and
women born during the Holodomor famine in 1932–33.12
In recent years, a number of reports on the long-term
health impact of the Chinese famine have been published.
Because they differ in study design and analytical methods
and are not easily compared, we undertook a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of available reports to summarize
the data, generate estimates of homogeneity of reported
famine effects and consider possible implications for public
health.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA)
guidelines13
(Supplementary Text 1, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online) and used a predefined protocol (Supplementary
Text 2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
PubMed, Embase, Chinese Wanfang Data and Chinese

databases
were
searched for reports recorded until 15 December 2015.
Broad search terms in English and Chinese were designed
to capture all health reports related to the Chinese famine,
including journal articles, degree theses and conference
manuscripts. The following keywords were searched:
[(China OR Chinese) AND (famine OR undernutrition OR
starvation OR malnutrition)] OR great leap forward OR
great famine. Additionally, review articles and reference
lists were screened for relevant reports.
Reports meeting the following criteria were included:
(i) if the Chinese famine was defined as an exposure or risk
factor; (ii) if long-term health conditions or chronic dis-
eases were the major outcome of interest; (iii) if outcomes
had been assessed with comparable methods for different
birth groups with and without famine experience; and (iv)
if descriptions of the study population, study design and
analysis were provided. Reports of education outcomes or
economic achievement were not included. We did not fur-
ther consider three economic reports on the relation be-
tween prenatal famine and adult height14–16 because the
Key Messages
• This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of potential effects of prenatal exposure to the Chinese famine
of 1959–61 on long-term health conditions.
• Most relevant reports vary substantially in exposure definition, control selection and analytical methods.
• Most effects commonly attributed to the famine can be explained by uncontrolled age differences between exposed
and control groups.
• Systematic analyses of available survey data in China might provide more reliable estimates of long-term famine
effects.

 biological literature, although limited, shows no relation
between prenatal famine and adult height,17,18 and body
mass index (BMI) was already included.
Data extraction
The titles and abstracts from the English language data-
bases were reviewed independently by both authors. The
titles and abstracts from the Chinese language databases
were screened by one author (C.L.) and their relevance was
determined together with the other author (LH.L.). The
full texts of all relevant reports were examined separately
by both authors to determine if they met the inclusion cri-
teria. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus.
From reports meeting the inclusion criteria, the following
data were extracted: author and publication information,
report characteristics (data source, analytical methods,
study size, exposure definitions, control selections, out-
comes studied) and reported results. Tabular information
on the number of disease events and populations at risk
was abstracted by both authors independently. Discrepant
data were then resolved through consensus. For all reports,
the most current bibliographic information is provided.
Quality assessment
The Newcastle–Ottawa scale19 was modified to capture
relevant quality characteristics of included reports: sam-
pling representativeness, sample size, exposure definition,
famine severity assessment, confounding adjustment, out-
come assessment and statistical methods. The quality of
each characteristic was scored ‘good’, ‘fair’ or ‘poor’,
based on predefined criteria (Supplementary Text 3, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
Reports were categorized into four groups: (i) national sur-
veys; (ii) multi-province surveys covering at least two prov-
inces; (iii) regional surveys covering only one province or
specific regions within a province; and (iv) local studies
covering only specific sites. Report characteristics were
summarized and the monthly number of births during the
famine period was calculated as an indicator of effective
study size.
Subjects were classified into three birth periods based
on year of birth or year and month of birth: famine births
(born around 1959–61); and post-famine and/or pre-
famine births serving as unexposed controls. Some reports
used only post-famine births as controls. The original clas-
sification of each report was used.
Provincial death rates from 1954 to 19668 were used to
classify reports in provinces with ‘low mortality’ (all-cause
mortality of less than 15/1000 population during the most
severe famine year), ‘medium mortality’ (15/1000 to 20/
1000), ‘high mortality’ (20/1000 to 40/1000) and ‘extreme
mortality’ (over 40/1000) (Supplementary Figure 1, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online). Study popula-
tions were grouped by sex whenever possible.
The command metan in Stata 11 was used to perform the
meta-analysis to combine the results from health conditions
available from the included reports on overweight,20–22
obesity,21–23 type 2 diabetes,23–29 hyperglycaemia,22–24,30
hypertension,22,23,27,31–34 the metabolic syndrome,35–38 and
schizophrenia.39,40 For each report, odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for selected
health conditions, comparing famine births with pre-famine
births and/or post-famine births serving as controls. To ad-
dress specific questions on age effects, famine births were
also compared with pre-famine births alone serving as con-
trols. Fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) models and random-
effects (Dersimonian-Laird) models were used to obtain
summary estimates (OR and 95% CI) of selected health
conditions.41
The I2 statistic was used to estimate the percentage of
variability across reports. Subgroup analyses were per-
formed by reported famine severity, provincial mortality
during the famine, sex, analytical methods (difference-in-
difference vs others) and publication language (English vs
Chinese). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to compare
the impact of varying definitions of famine exposed and
control populations and by excluding reports with extreme
results. Meta-analyses were repeated assuming significant
fertility declines, losses to follow-up and increased mortal-
ity among famine births. Publication bias was assessed by
funnel plots.42
Results
Of 13 670 records identified, 71 full-text reports were as-
sessed in detail and 36 met our inclusion criteria; 25 in
English
20,21,24,26,27,31–34,36–40,43–53 and 11 in Chinese
22,23,25,28–30,35,54–57 (Figure 1).
Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the reports,
including: data source (column 1); study reference (column
2); analytical methods (column 3), with time controls used
most frequently; study size (column 4), ranging from 100
to over 1.4 million famine births; famine exposure time
studied (column 5), ranging from 24 to 96 months, with
36 months most commonly used; monthly number of fam-
ine births (column 6); and health conditions studied (col-
umn 7). The specific birth months defined as famine births,
pre-famine births and post-famine births for each report

 are shown in Figure 2. Additional information on data
sources, including recruitment methods, sample size and
provincial mortality during the famine is provided in
Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online. Over half of the provinces included in the re-
ported surveys and studies experienced low or medium
mortality during the famine (Supplementary Figure 2,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Most reports showed a 1–3-fold increase in the odds for
selected health conditions comparing famine births with
post-famine births, or pre-famine births to post-famine
births (Supplementary Table 2, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). Some reports showed larger famine ef-
fects among births in severe vs less severe famine areas and
in rural vs urban areas.24,32,33,36,40,43,47,56 Overweight and
obesity, type 2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia, hypertension
and the metabolic syndrome were generally more pro-
nounced
in
women
than
in
men
among
famine
births.20,21,26,28,30,31,35,37,38,44,46,47
The studied reports are listed by type of study (national,
multi-province, regional and local) and by classification of
famine exposure by year and month of birth, in Figure 2.
Data from 21 reports could be used for a meta-analyses of
overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia,
hypertension, the metabolic syndrome and schizophrenia.
Seventeen reports provided data on famine births, pre-
famine births and post-famine births;21–24,26,27,30–40 two
only on famine births and post-famine births;20,25 and two
(both for type 2 diabetes) on famine births and pre- and
post-famine births combined.28,29 Several reports pre-
sented data for more than one health condition.20–24,27–
29,32
Figure 3 shows effect estimates for health conditions
comparing famine births with post-famine births serving as
controls. The summary effect estimates from random-
effects models show increases in the odds of overweight
(OR 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02–1.17), type 2 diabetes (OR 1.36;
95% CI: 1.07–1.75), hyperglycaemia (OR 1.25; 95% CI:
0.93–1.67), the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.30; 95% CI:
1.12–1.52) and schizophrenia (OR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.29–
1.77).They show no relation for being obese (OR 1.03;
95% CI: 0.80–1.33) or hypertensive (OR 1.13; 95% CI:

 0.99–1.30). The estimates from fixed-effects and random-
effects models were comparable, although the 95% CIs of
random-effects models were wider, as expected, because of
between-study heterogeneity. Effect estimates of similar or
larger magnitude were observed when pre-famine births
were compared with post-famine births serving as controls
except for schizophrenia (Supplementary Figure 3, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online). ORs were gen-
erally less than unity when famine births were compared
with pre-famine births alone serving as controls, except for
schizophrenia
(Supplementary
Figure
4,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Figure 4 shows the effect estimates when comparing
famine births with pre- and post-famine births combined
as a single control group. For schizophrenia, the effect esti-
mate (OR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.50–1.70) is similar to Figure 3.
No famine effects are seen however for any of the other
health conditions including overweight, obesity, type 2 dia-
betes, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and the metabolic
syndrome. For these conditions, the OR estimates range
from 0.68 (95% CI: 0.27–1.72) for being overweight to
1.11 (95% CI: 1.00–1.22) for the metabolic syndrome. As
seen in Figure 4, the number of events for specific
morbidities (combining the cases among individuals born
during the famine with those born before or after the fam-
ine) ranges between 1029 for hyperglycaemia and 8973 for
hypertension.
Five out of 21 selected reports provided information on
famine severity.24,32,33,36,40 In these studies there was no
dose-response relation with health outcomes; neither was
provincial mortality during the famine related to the degree
of later morbidity. Further subgroup analyses of reports
grouped by analytical methods (difference-in-difference vs
others), by slight variations in the selected birth years for
famine and control groups, or by English vs Chinese publi-
cation language, showed that all study outcomes were
broadly comparable across these subgroups. Half of the
included reports provided information on individuals’
sex.20,21,26,28–32,37,38 Famine effects were generally more
pronounced among females, except for schizophrenia.
Two smaller reports showed extreme results for over-
weight, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia and
hypertension.22,23 Removing these reports from the meta-
analysis did not affect the overall findings. Although the
number of reports was limited, funnel plots for specific
health outcomes did not show specific patterns that suggest

Discussion
In 1999, Vaclav Smil called for an open examination and
discussion of the consequences of the Chinese famine of
1959–61.9 Subsequently, several reports suggested there
may indeed be a relationship between early life exposure to
the famine and adult health. If so, the famine might even
contribute to the rapidly growing burden of chronic dis-
ease in China today. We therefore conducted this system-
atic review and meta-analysis to estimate the long-term
impact among individuals potentially exposed to the fam-
ine during early life.
We found that overweight, type 2 diabetes, hypergly-
caemia, the metabolic syndrome and schizophrenia were
more common among adults born in the famine years than

 among controls born after the famine. By contrast, no
increased odds of diseases are seen among adults born in
the famine years compared with controls from pre-famine
and
post-famine
births,
except
for
schizophrenia.
Comparisons between famine births and pre-famine births
show that adverse health conditions were less common
among adults born in the famine years compared with con-
trols born before the famine, except for schizophrenia.
This meta-analysis demonstrates how sensitive the re-
ported estimates of long-term famine effects are to the
choice of study controls and outcomes. The question is
what factors could explain these differences.
The findings of increased health risks among individuals
born during the famine compared with post-famine births
can be explained by the highly increased prevalence of
overweight, type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions

 with increasing age. Results from national surveys in
China show that the overweight prevalence was 24% and
28%, respectively, among the age groups 35–44 and
45–54 years,58 the obesity prevalence 3% and 4%,58 the
hypertension prevalence 14% and 27%59 and the meta-
bolic syndrome prevalence 9% and 14%.60 The diabetes
prevalence was 11% and 18%, respectively, comparing
ages 40–49 and 50–59.61 We were not able to find national
prevalence estimates for 5-year age increments but expect
that the differences will be proportional. In our view,
uncontrolled age differences between famine births and
post-famine births could therefore have resulted in the sig-
nificant differences in disease prevalence that up to this
point have been erroneously attributed to long-term famine
effects. Very few studies have mentioned the potential for
age bias,27,62 and none have reported famine estimates
using different control groups.
In most published reports, comparisons of health condi-
tions are made between famine births and post-famine
births who on average are 3–5 years younger. It is not pos-
sible to make statistical adjustments for this age difference
because there is no overlap in the birth years of famine
births and post-famine births. The addition of pre-famine
births to the control group as shown in Figure 4 corrects
for the age imbalance, as the average age of pre- and post-
famine births combined is now close to the average age of
the famine births. With these controls, our meta-analysis
no longer shows systematic increases in adverse health out-
comes among famine births, except for schizophrenia
(Figure 4).
Because famine births are younger than pre-famine
births, we predicted that comparisons between famine
births and pre-famine births serving as controls will sug-
gest a protective effect of the famine on later health. This is
indeed the case, except for schizophrenia, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 4. The relation between prenatal
famine and later life schizophrenia holds, irrespective of
the choice of control groups, because the prevalence of
schizophrenia was similar in the pre-famine and post-
famine births.
If study reports use time controls, age-related biases can
be avoided by combining pre-famine and post-famine
controls as here demonstrated. Alternatively, difference-in-
difference methods can be used to avoid biased compari-
sons, as set out further below. It is possible that births
before and after the famine not only differ in age but also
in specific but unknown cohort characteristics relating to
health, for instance secular trends in general economic or
health conditions. Unfortunately, specific information to
control for any such characteristics is not available from
the reviewed studies. However, because of the overwhelm-
ing impact of age on the reported health outcomes, it is
unlikely that any such factors could distort the effects of
age; and secular trends are not likely to show abrupt
changes other than by specific impacts such as the famine.
As mentioned above, difference-in-difference approaches
could be used to avoid the problem of unadjusted age ef-
fects, as they compare changes over calendar time in
exposed
and
less
exposed
populations
of
the
same
age.24,27,32,33,36,43,44,46,47 This approach requires popula-
tions with well-defined differences in famine exposure at
the local level that are highly comparable in all other char-
acteristics. For such comparisons, differences of mortality
rates at the provincial level as used in most included reports
may not be specific enough. This is suggested by our sub-
group analysis that failed to show a relation with regional
mortality.
In all reports, famine exposure of study participants
was exclusively defined by their year of birth, ignoring re-
gional differences in the timing and severity of the famine.
In addition, definitions varied somewhat across studies as
to the exact year and month of selected study groups, al-
though the overall pattern across studies was broadly com-
parable. In one-third of the reviewed studies, individuals
born in early 1959 or in late 1961 had not been included
as exposed, or births in late 1958 or early 1962 had not
been included as controls. In some studies, this was done
to minimize possible misclassification (Figure 2). In separ-
ate analyses, we confirmed that these variations had no im-
pact on the reported outcomes. In future studies however,
a more exact date of birth rather than year of birth alone
should be sought for better timing of the gestation period
in relation to the famine environment, as shown else-
where.12 Date of birth can serve as a good approximation
of conception date, as Dutch Hunger Winter studies show
that famine effects on shortening gestation length are lim-
ited to 3–4 days.17
Although some studies reported larger famine effects
among adults born in severe vs less severe famine areas, we
did not find any systematic relationship with famine sever-
ity or provincial mortality. This suggests that such aggre-
gated
measures
need
improvement
to
reflect
local
conditions. It is known for instance that even within re-
gions, there can be large differences in the severity of the
famine. First, rural and urban areas were often treated dif-
ferently by a grain ration system that preferentially sup-
plied urban residents.32,38,63,64 Second, rural areas with
good transportation links to cities were at especially
increased famine risk because this facilitated the shipment
and removal of their resources to the cities.63
Within provinces, the severity of the famine also shows
considerable
variation
in
county-level
mortality
(Supplementary Figure 7, available as Supplementary data

 the local level and county level census counts should there-
fore be examined for changes in births and mortality
during the famine.65 At the regional level, high-risk and
low-risk areas might be defined by contemporary changes
in fertility and deficits in survivors from specific birth
years.12,63 This is especially important because reliable in-
formation on individual dietary intakes during the famine
is unlikely to be available. We found that schizophrenia ef-
fects were more pronounced in rural than urban popula-
tions, in line with our expectations. For other health
outcomes, specific residence information for reliable com-
parisons was not available.
Studies should not be used to estimate disease preva-
lence in the populations of interest unless specifically de-
signed for that purpose. Some reports show no deficit in
the number of participants born in famine years as would
be expected from reductions in fertility during severe fam-
ine periods.26,37,49 Although diagnoses were based on bio-
logical samples, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes as
reported in some studies24,25,30 is very low and could either
reflect the young age of study participants or point towards
the selection of only those individuals who were willing to
undergo blood testing.
At the national level, it has been reported that perhaps
half of type 2 diabetes cases in China are not recog-
nized.66–68 We do not think this could explain our study
findings, for several reasons. First, the diagnosis of diabetes
in our reviewed reports did not rely on potentially biased
self-reports. Second, the odds of clinically diagnosed dia-
betes in famine-exposed and non-exposed study groups
will provide an unbiased estimate of health effects as long
as the age distributions, self-selection patterns or diabetes
diagnostics are comparable between famine-exposed indi-
viduals and controls. Third, the exclusion of very low
prevalence studies did not change the results of our meta-
analysis.
Many
reports
combined
outcomes
for
men
and
women.20–25,27,29,33,36,39,40,45,49,51,53 In reports that did
not, relations between early famine and adverse health
conditions tended to be stronger in women compared with
men.20,21,26,28,31,35,37,38,44,46 It is possible that these find-
ings are biased and reflect an increase of premature deaths
among men with famine exposure.69 Sex-specific selection
effects are difficult to estimate from cross-sectional sur-
veys, but this question will need further exploration as a
potential source of study bias.
Some limitations of our approach need to be acknowl-
edged. First, meta-analyses can be subject to publication
bias. The likelihood of publication bias is highly depend-
ent, however, on the strength and the direction of the re-
search findings.70 Studies with statistically significant
results are more likely to get published than studies with
null or non-significant results.71,72 In our view, publication
bias therefore is an unlikely explanation for the null find-
ings of our meta-analysis. In addition, funnel plots showed
no specific patterns suggesting selective reporting, although
the number of studies for each outcome is limited
(Supplemental Figures 5A and 5B).
Second, the combined effects of early famine on
decreased fertility and increased premature deaths could
obscure the long-term impact of famine.27,73 If the weakest
among the famine-exposed individuals are less likely to be
alive at the time of follow-up, this may lead to biased re-
sults. To examine the question, we carried out a sensitivity
analysis based on extreme fertility and mortality assump-
tions, using the age-composition breakdown from the
China 2011 national census to estimate the combined age-
specific deficits from fertility declines during the famine
and from fetal and postnatal deaths. We first assumed a
38% deficit in the population of individuals born during
the famine, based on data from the nationally representa-
tive China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study
(CHARLS)74 [charls.ccer.edu.cn/en]. We then assumed
that famine survivors had a 50% increased risk of selected
health conditions, based on our previous estimates of
increased diabetes after prenatal famine as reported else-
where.12 We recalculated the odds ratios (ORs) associated
with famine exposure using these two assumptions for all
reports.
Results
from
our
sensitivity
analyses
(Supplementary Figure 8, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online) show that our original findings are hardly af-
fected by these recalculations. The recalculated ORs for
the associations between famine exposure and selected
health conditions generally shifted upwards by no more
than 10% (from null results with ORs� ¼ 1 to ORs
� ¼ 1.1, with wide 95% CIs). The largest change for meta-
bolic conditions was the shift in the summary estimate for
the metabolic syndrome, with an OR increase from 1.11
(95% CI: 1.00–1.22; Figure 4) to 1.34 (95% CI: 1.20–
1.49; Supplementary Figure 8). The ORs for schizophrenia
studies remained consistently positive and increased from
1.60 to 1.90.
Third, we considered the possible impact of selective
migrations on the study findings. Overall, internal migra-
tions in China before 1980 were rare (less than 2% of
population).75 Only after 1990 did migrations rapidly in-
crease, but the proportion of migrants was still no larger
than 10% nationwide.76 Migrants are not a random seg-
ment of the population: migration is work related, and mi-
grants tend to be single and young, with a mean age in the
mid 20s.44,77 The migrants in the 1990s will therefore on
average be at least 10 years younger than famine births.
Migrations were still rare among individuals born during
the famine and are unlikely to bias our study findings.

 In summary, our meta-analysis of all available reports
shows no clear relation between prenatal exposure to the
Chinese Famine of 1959–61 and type 2 diabetes and other
health conditions, except for schizophrenia. This is in con-
trast to studies on late life type 2 diabetes after prenatal ex-
posure to the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33,12 or the
Dutch famine of 1944–45,78,79 that used comparable pre-
famine and post-famine controls. Our study results are un-
expected and require further exploration.
Reliable estimates of the long-term impact of the
Chinese famine are important for several reasons. If the re-
ported positive associations from individual Chinese fam-
ine reports are indeed causal, the famine experience could
have substantially increased the risk of major chronic dis-
eases in later life among the Chinese population. This
needs further quantification, because over 35 million indi-
viduals born during 1959–61 may have been be affected
during the fetal period, and many more at different stages
in childhood.80 Any adverse long-term effects of the famine
are likely to become more evident in the next decade with
the ageing of the exposed populations.81
We think there is an opportunity to systematically ex-
plore several unanswered questions with the survey data
available in China.74,82 Although the ongoing national and
regional surveys were designed to monitor population
health and were not optimized to assess long-term famine
effects, some could nevertheless be used for a more system-
atic examination of relevant questions, by identifying for
instance specific sub-populations in regions representing a
wide range of famine exposures and comparisons with un-
exposed
controls.
Although
most
surveys
are
cross-
sectional, the follow-up over time that is ongoing in some
will also allow for prospective studies of disease develop-
ment in an ageing population exposed to different degrees
of famine in early life.
Additional analyses of available data should be carried
out with pre-specified hypotheses in mind, based on avail-
able data of post-famine effects in other settings.10,12
These analyses will most likely generate more reliable esti-
mates of long-term effects of early famine, establish pos-
sible dose-response relations between severity of famine
exposure and adverse health outcomes and evaluate sex-
specific effects. Additional information on famine mortal-
ity and fertility at the county level will help to better define
gradients of the level of famine exposure.
We suggest that these analyses initially focus on obesity,
type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia, in view of previously re-
ported positive associations20,21,24–26,28–31,33,34,39,40,44–47,56,57
and the findings of this review. Differences in human capital
outcomes in education and social economic achievement after
famine in early life are potentially important but are not fur-
ther discussed here.
Our systematic review and meta-analysis has raised
some fundamental questions about the possible impact of
the famine on the current and future burden of chronic dis-
ease in China. We expect that a more systematic analysis
of current survey data based on our observations and rec-
ommendations will be able to provide more reliable quan-
titative estimates of the potential health impact of the
famine on the current population in China and recommen-
dations for public health policy.
