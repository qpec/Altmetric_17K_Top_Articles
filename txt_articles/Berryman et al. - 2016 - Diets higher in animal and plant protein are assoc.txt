ABSTRACT
Background: Higher-protein diets are associated with decreased ad-
iposity and greater HDL cholesterol than lower protein diets. Whether
these benefits can be attributed to a specific protein source (i.e., non-
dairy animal, dairy, or plant) is unknown, and concerns remain re-
garding the impact of higher-protein diets on kidney function.
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate trends of
protein source on markers of cardiometabolic disease risk and kid-
ney function in US adults.
Design: Total, nondairy animal, dairy, and plant protein intake were
estimated with the use of 24-h recall data from NHANES 2007–2010
(n = 11,111; $19 y). Associations between source-specific protein
intake and health outcomes were determined with the use of models
that adjusted for sex, race and ethnicity, age, physical activity, poverty-
to-income ratio, individual intake (grams per kilogram) for each of the
other 2 protein sources, body mass index (BMI) (except for weight-
related variables), and macronutrient (carbohydrate, fiber, and total
and saturated fat) intake.
Results: Mean 6 SE total protein intake was 82.3 6 0.8 g/d (animal:
37.4 6 0.5 g/d; plant: 24.7 6 0.3 g/d; and dairy: 13.4 6 0.3 g/d). Both
BMI and waist circumference were inversely associated [regression
coefficient (95% CI)] with animal [20.199 (20.265, 20.134), P ,
0.0001; 20.505 (20.641, 20.370), P , 0.0001] and plant [20.346
(20.455, 20.237), P , 0.0001; 20.826 (21.114, 20.538), P ,
0.0001] protein intake. Blood urea nitrogen concentrations increased
across deciles for animal [0.313 (0.248, 0.379), P , 0.0001; decile
1–10: 11.6 6 0.2 to 14.9 6 0.3 mg/dL] and dairy [0.195 (0.139,
0.251), P , 0.0001; decile 1–10: 12.7 6 0.2 to 13.9 6 0.2 mg/dL]
but not plant protein intake. Glomerular filtration rate and blood
creatinine were not associated with intake of any protein source.
Conclusions: Diets higher in plant and animal protein, independent
of other dietary factors, are associated with cardiometabolic bene-
fits, particularly improved central adiposity, with no apparent im-
pairment of kidney function.

INTRODUCTION
Americans generally consume protein at amounts higher than the
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA6; 0.8 g/kg body weight),
but well within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range
for protein (10–35% of total calories) (1–3). The primary source of
dietary protein in the American adult diet is nondairy animal
sources (chicken and beef), followed by plant (yeast breads and rolls
or buns) and dairy (milk) sources (4). Recent cross-sectional data
suggest that Americans who habitually consume dietary protein at
amounts higher than the RDA have lower cardiometabolic disease
risk (2). In that study of w24,000 adults, individuals who consumed
higher-protein diets had a lower BMI and waist circumference
(WC) and an increased HDL cholesterol concentration compared
with individuals who consumed protein at amounts consistent with
the RDA (2). A cross-sectional analysis of Iranian nationals found
similar associations between higher-protein diets and measures of
central adiposity in women and HDL cholesterol in both sexes (5).
Contributions by specific protein source were not reported in either
study. As such, studies that stratify the effects of dietary protein on
cardiometabolic disease risk by protein source (i.e., nondairy ani-
mal, plant, and dairy) are necessary to distinguish the effects that are
likely to be attributable to protein, per se, compared with the con-
comitant nutritional components in whole foods.
Despite increasing evidence suggesting that higher-protein
diets may confer cardiometabolic benefits, there is a persisting
concern that maintaining a higher protein intake may contribute
to acute and long-term declines in kidney function (6, 7). The
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Nutrition Guidelines
(8) recommend a low-protein diet (0.6 g protein/kg) for non-
dialyzed individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD); within
this population, low protein intake (0.3–0.6 g/kg) has been
shown to reduce renal death and delay the onset of dialysis

 (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.84) compared with higher protein
intake ($0.8 g/kg) (9). In adults with no history of CKD, in-
creases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), and calcium excretion are normal adaptive responses
to shorter- and longer-term (1–104 wk) higher protein intake
(10). To our knowledge, conclusive evidence of the relation
between transient changes in kidney function and long-term
renal decline in individuals with normal kidney function does
not exist, particularly as it relates to protein source.
The objective of this study was to evaluate decile trends of
protein source on markers of cardiometabolic disease risk and
kidney function in a representative sample of free-living US
adults. We hypothesized that the beneficial relations between
protein and cardiometabolic disease risk outcomes, including
BMI, WC, and HDL cholesterol, would be consistent with our
previous report (2), regardless of source, and that higher-protein
diets would not be associated with impaired kidney function.
METHODS
Study overview and participants
The NHANES is a large ongoing dietary survey of a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population.
The data are collected and released by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the CDC every 2 y. Data from NHANES 2007–
2008 and 2009–2010 were combined for this analysis, which
included 11,111 adults (aged $19 y) who completed a 24-h di-
etary recall, excluding pregnant or lactating women, individuals
with a BMI (in kg/m2) #18.5, and those with incomplete dietary
records or missing data. All participants or proxies provided
written informed consent, and the Research Ethics Review Board
at the National Center for Health Statistics approved the survey
protocol. A detailed description of the survey design and the data
collection procedures are reported elsewhere (11).
Protein intake
USDA food composition databases, including the Food and
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, versions 4.1 and 5.0, and
the linked USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference,
releases 22 and 24, were used to determine the protein amount
and type from foods consumed by NHANES participants (12,
13), as described previously (4). In addition, the USDA list of 150
total food categories was used to define food sources by protein
type (14). More than 90% of all protein was categorized as
nondairy animal, dairy, or plant, with only 8% of protein intake
not able to be categorized (primarily in the mixed-food category).
All references to animal protein within the text, figure, and tables
denote nondairy animal protein, unless stated otherwise.
Outcome variables
Body weight, BMI, WC, blood pressure (diastolic and sys-
tolic), glycated hemoglobin, HDL cholesterol, BUN, blood
creatinine, GFR [Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col-
laboration creatinine equation (15)], fasting triglycerides, LDL
cholesterol, glucose, and insulin were obtained from examination
(16) and laboratory files (17). HOMA-IR was calculated as the
product of plasma insulin (picomoles per liter) and glucose
(millimoles per liter) divided by 22.5 (18).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with the use of SAS 9.2 and SUDAAN
release 11.0 (Research Triangle Institute). Appropriate weighting
factors were used to adjust for oversampling of selected groups,
survey nonresponses of some individuals, and for the day of the
week the interview was conducted (19). Means and percentages 6
SEs of total, animal, dairy, and plant protein were determined by
using PROC DESCRIPT in SUDAAN with the use of data from
the first 24-h recall. Deciles of total, animal, dairy, and plant
protein intake were developed by estimating individual usual in-
take with the use of the National Cancer Institute method (20), as
reported previously (4). Least-squares means and SEs of bio-
chemical outcome variables were determined for subjects in each
decile of total, animal, dairy, and plant protein intake (grams
per kilogram body weight) with use of PROC REGRESS in
SUDAAN after adjustment for covariates. In model 1, outcome
variables were adjusted for sex, race and ethnicity, age, physical
activity (categorized as sedentary, moderate, or vigorous on the
basis of responses to questions on activity), poverty-to-income
ratio, individual intake (grams per kilogram) for each of the other
2 protein sources (e.g., regression analysis for animal protein was
adjusted for individual intake of dairy and plant protein), and BMI
(except for weight related variables). In model 2, outcome vari-
ables were adjusted for all model 1 variables, in addition to
carbohydrate, fiber, total fat, and saturated fat intake (i.e., mac-
ronutrients). Trends across deciles of habitual dietary protein
intake were computed for the covariate-adjusted biochemical
variables. Subjects with missing data for a variable of interest
were eliminated from that particular analysis. Significance was set
at a Bonferroni-adjusted a of P , 0.0008 [P , 0.05 divided by
60 (4 protein source groups and 15 sets of variables analyzed)].
RESULTS
Protein intake
Mean 6 SE total protein intake was 82.3 6 0.8 g/d, of which
37.4 6 0.5 g/d (range: 2.9 6 0.1 to 98.0 6 1.7 g/d) was animal
protein, 13.4 6 0.3 g/d (range: 0.03 6 0.003 to 41.7 6 0.9 g/d)
was dairy protein, and 24.7 6 0.3 g/d (range: 7.6 6 0.2 to
52.1 6 0.6 g/d) was plant protein. Approximately 6.8 6
0.2 g/d protein could not be attributed to animal, dairy, or plant
food sources. Protein intake (grams per kilogram) of each source
more than doubled from deciles 1 to 10 (Figure 1).
Population demographics
The percentage of women consuming animal, plant, or dairy
protein decreased across increasing intake deciles. With in-
creasing deciles of animal protein intake, the percentage of the
Hispanic and non-Hispanic black populations increased, whereas
the percentage of the non-Hispanic white population decreased.
With increasing deciles of dairy protein intake, the percentage of
the non-Hispanic white population increased, whereas both
percentages of the Hispanic and non-Hispanic black populations
decreased. In the case of increasing plant protein deciles, the
percentage of the Hispanic population increased, the percentage
of the non-Hispanic black population decreased, and the per-
centage of the non-Hispanic white population remained un-
changed (Table 1).

 Weight-related markers
Body weight, BMI, and WC were inversely associated with
habitual intake of total, animal, dairy, and plant protein when
adjusted for model 1 covariates (Table 2). The associations re-
mained significant for total, animal, and plant protein, but not
dairy, in model 2.
Cardiometabolic disease risk factors
Deciles of animal protein intake were positively associated
with glucose in model 1. This association remained significant in
model 2. Deciles of plant protein intake were positively asso-
ciated with diastolic blood pressure in model 1, but not in model
2. In both models 1 and 2, there were no significant associations
between deciles of total or dairy protein and any cardiometabolic
disease risk factor (Table 3).
Markers of kidney function
In model 1, deciles of plant protein intake were positively
associated with GFR and inversely associated with BUN and
creatinine; these variables were no longer significant after model
2 adjustments. In both models 1 and 2, there was a positive
association between total, animal, and dairy protein intake and
BUN (Table 4). Total protein intake was associated with cre-
atinine in model 1, but not model 2, and had no relation with
GFR in either model. Deciles of animal and dairy protein intake
were not associated with creatinine or GFR (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The current cross-sectional study demonstrated the following:
1) animal and plant protein, but not dairy protein, are inversely
associated with WC, BMI, and body weight; 2) with the ex-
ception of a positive relation between animal protein and blood
glucose, plant, dairy, and animal protein are not associated with
any marker of increased cardiometabolic disease risk; 3) animal,
dairy, and plant protein are not associated with GFR or creati-
nine concentrations, but animal and dairy protein are positively
associated with BUN. These findings are consistent with our
previous work demonstrating a beneficial relation between
protein intake and weight-related outcomes (2), but further
suggest the relative contribution of specific protein sources.
Perhaps most importantly, our analysis shows that habitual

 consumption of higher-protein diets is not associated with im-
paired kidney function in adults with no history of renal disease.
Source-specific associations were examined with the use of
statistical models to limit residual nutritional confounders inherent
in foods containing the other 2 protein sources (model 1) and
independent of other macronutrients within the food itself and the
complete diet (model 2). Animal, dairy, and plant protein were
inversely associated with weight-related indicators when consid-
ered within their food matrix; however, when adjustments were
made for carbohydrate, fiber, total fat, and saturated fat, only
animal and plant protein intakewere related to WC, BMI, and body
weight. Sample size, corrections for multiple comparisons, the
relatively small contribution of dairy (16%) to total protein intake,
and less variation in intake across deciles likely are responsible for
the lack of an association with dairy protein (4). Nevertheless,
animal and plant protein intake were associated with lower body
weight and central adiposity, findings that may be attributed to the
metabolic efficiency (energy produced relative to energy cost of
metabolism) of protein (21, 22). Metabolic efficiency calculations
indicate that protein is the least efficient of the metabolic pathways,
suggesting that because more energy is needed to use protein as
a fuel, compared with carbohydrate and fat, higher-protein diets
may lower body weight (21).
Interestingly, animal protein was positively associated with
blood glucose with both statistical models, suggesting that animal
protein itself, more than the other nutrients in the foods and total
diet, may alter glycemic regulation. Although our study does not
allow us to distinguish the specific animal protein foods re-
sponsible for this effect, meta-analyses have found that consuming
high amounts of red and processed meat increases the risk of type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease–related and all-cause mor-
tality (23–32). Less evidence exists to evaluate the relation be-
tween white meat (poultry and fish) and cardiovascular disease
mortality; however, results predominantly indicate null or slightly
inverse associations (23, 32, 33). Furthermore, consumption of 1–
4 servings fish/wk provides protection from coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) mortality and stroke (34, 35). The wide variation in
types of animal protein suggests that investigating specific foods
may be more informative than grouped sources. However, a study
investigating the relation between protein intake (lowest quintile:
12.4% 6 1.7% compared with highest quintile: 22.8% 6 3.4% of
total intake) and CAD incidence in US adults found that CAD risk
was not associated with total, vegetable, or animal protein intake,
including dairy, nor was it associated with any major dietary food
source of protein (36). Additional prospective cohort studies have
differentiated by source and indicate that animal (nondairy and
dairy) and plant protein neither positively nor negatively affect
long-term CAD risk (37, 38).
Protein source associations, or lack thereof, with HDL cholesterol
and diastolic blood pressure were unexpected. Our previous finding
of an association between total protein intake and HDL cholesterol
was not replicated by the current analysis. This discrepancy may be
due to the smaller sample size (n = 11,111 compared with n =
23,876) or slight differences in statistical model adjustments (i.e.,
adjustment for saturated fat intake) between studies. In addition,
plant protein was associated with increased diastolic blood pressure
in model 1; however, this relation was no longer significant after
further adjustment for carbohydrate, fiber, total fat, and saturated
fat. This suggests that other nutrients in foods containing plant
protein may be driving the relation. The primary food sources of
plant protein are yeast breads and rolls or buns—comprising
w18% of all plant protein consumed—which commonly contrib-
ute meaningful amounts of sodium to the diet (4).
Our analysis of protein source and kidney function yielded
positive associations between animal and dairy protein intake
and BUN. These associations are expected, given that urea is

increased GFR and decreased BUN and creatinine in model 1, but

Again, this suggests that other nutrients in foods high in plant
protein may account for the relation, not the protein, per se. A

PROTEIN SOURCE AND HEALTH

 recent publication that also used NHANES data showed that
increasing quartiles of sodium were positively associated with GFR
(P , 0.0001) (39). Furthermore, a substudy of the OmniHeart Trial
used a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding design to in-
vestigate the effects of carbohydrate (15% protein and 27% fat),
unsaturated fat (15% protein and 37% fat), and protein (25%
protein and 27% fat) diets on kidney function (40). Similar to our
findings, the protein diet, which was 48% plant-based, increased
GFR and decreased creatinine compared with both the carbo-
hydrate and unsaturated fat diets (40).
It is important to note that the GFR, BUN, and creatinine con-
centrations reported for each decile were within the normal range
for healthy adults (normal ranges: $90 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22;
7–20 mg/dL; and men: 0.7–1.3 and women: 0.6–1.1 mg/dL,
respectively). A recent meta-analysis combined data from di-
etary intervention studies comparing higher-protein to normal-
or low-protein diets in subjects with no history of CKD and
found that GFR [mean difference: 7.18 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22
(4.45, 9.91 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22), P , 0.001] and urea [mean
difference: 1.75 mmol/L (1.13, 2.37 mmol/L), P , 0.001] were
increased with higher-protein diets, demonstrating normal
physiologic adaptations to increased protein intake in healthy
adults (10). The argument that higher-protein diets cause a strain
on the kidneys because of transient or sustained increases in
GFR has never been translated to long-term disease burden in
individuals with normal renal function (41). Thus, WHO and
Institute of Medicine recommendations recognize higher-protein
diets as safe in individuals without CKD (3, 42).
Limitations of the current study, as with any observational
investigation, include an inability to infer causation. In addition,
recent debate about the validity of self-reported dietary data
highlights the importance of acknowledging the inherent limita-
tions, such as over- and underreporting (43). However, the bi-
ological endpoints measured in this study, including BUN, were
greater with increasing protein intake, adding validity to the self-
reported measures. Although our study was observational, it may
provide the basis for controlled interventions to test the mecha-
nisms by which dietary protein from different sources affects
cardiometabolic and kidney health. The 2015 Scientific Report of
the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (44) makes recom-
mendations based on food groups, not specific macronutrients,
which is likely the best model for such future study designs that
will guide public health recommendations.
In conclusion, we showed that animal and plant protein intake is
inversely associated with WC, BMI, and body weight and that
plant and dairy protein consumption is not associated with any
biological marker of increased cardiometabolic disease risk. In
healthy adults with no history of renal disease, GFR, BUN, and
creatinine remain within normal physiologic ranges with in-
creasing consumption of animal, dairy, and plant protein. These
findings suggest that diets higher in plant and animal protein,
independent of other dietary factors, are associated with car-
diometabolic benefits, particularly improved central adiposity, but
not impaired kidney function in US adults.
The author’s responsibilities were as follows—SA and VLF: conducted the
research; SMP: had primary responsibility for the final content; and all authors:
designed the research, analyzed the data, wrote the manuscript, and read and
approved the final manuscript. SA performs consulting and technical services
for various food and beverage companies and related entities as President of
