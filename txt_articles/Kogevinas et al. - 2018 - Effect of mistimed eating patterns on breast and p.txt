Modern life involves mistimed sleeping and eating patterns that in experimental studies are associated with adverse health
effects. We assessed whether timing of meals is associated with breast and prostate cancer risk taking into account lifestyle
and chronotype, a characteristic correlating with preference for morning or evening activity. We conducted a population-based
case-control study in Spain, 2008–2013. In this analysis we included 621 cases of prostate and 1,205 of breast cancer and

 872 male and 1,321 female population controls who had never worked night shift. Subjects were interviewed on timing of
meals, sleep and chronotype and completed a Food Frequency Questionaire. Adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/
American Institute of Cancer Research recommendations for cancer prevention was examined. Compared with subjects sleep-
ing immediately after supper, those sleeping two or more hours after supper had a 20% reduction in cancer risk for breast
and prostate cancer combined (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR] 5 0.80, 95%CI 0.67–0.96) and in each cancer individually (prostate
cancer OR 5 0.74, 0.55–0.99; breast cancer OR 5 0.84, 0.67–1.06). A similar protection was observed in subjects having sup-
per before 9 pm compared with supper after 10 pm. The effect of longer supper-sleep interval was more pronounced among
subjects adhering to cancer prevention recommendations (OR both cancers5 0.65, 0.44–0.97) and in morning types (OR both
cancers 5 0.66, 0.49–0.90). Adherence to diurnal eating patterns and specifically a long interval between last meal and sleep
are associated with a lower cancer risk, stressing the importance of evaluating timing in studies on diet and cancer.
Introduction
Experimental and epidemiological evidence shows that long
term disruption of endogenous circadian rhythms, in particular
due to exposure to light at night, may be associated with a wide
range of common diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular dis-
eases, obesity and type 2 diabetes.1–4 Studies have shown pro-
found changes of the human transcriptome5 and metabolome6
associated with circadian disruption and sleep deprivation. The
prevalence of circadian disruption in human populations is high
and increasing due to the expanding human activities over the
24 hr period. In 2007 the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC/WHO) classified shift work involving circadian
disruption as probably carcinogenic to humans based mainly on
animal experimental evidence and evidence on mechanisms,
while the human evidence on shift work and breast cancer was
considered as limited.7,8 Following IARC’s evaluation, most new
studies supported an association of night work with breast and
prostate cancer9,10 although the largest cohort study on breast
cancer did not support an association.11 Shift work has also
been associated with cancer subphenotypes and specifically with
more advanced cancer at diagnosis.9 Individual chronotype is a
human attribute with genetic basis that correlates with diurnal
preference for activities in the morning or evening.12 Chrono-
type may affect adaptation to irregular work, sleep and diet
schedules and modify the effects of circadian disruption.13
Modern life involve erratic and mistimed eating patterns
such as late night eating that are associated with adverse
health endpoints in experimental studies.14 In humans there
is little evidence on the effect of eating patterns on health
and commonly quoted recommendations on “best” eating
times are frequently based on poor scientific evidence.15
From an evolutionary perspective, intermittent eating pat-
terns with periods of fasting were the norm in humans and
food was primarily consumed during daylight with long
hours of overnight fasting.16 In human experimental studies,
changes in meal timing were associated with acute effects in
leptin
levels,17
with
synchronizing
peripheral
circadian
rhythms such as glucose levels18 and with systemic inflamma-
tion.19 In experimental studies, circadian reprogramming of
tumor transcriptome with meal timing was associated with
cancer growth inhibition20 and intermittent periods of energy
restriction were found to prevent disease processes through a
variety of mechanisms.21
Studies on nutrition and cancer have focused on type (e.g.,
consumption of fruits and vegetables) and quantity of food
intake, rather than on timing of eating. Several components of
diet and dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet or
the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Can-
cer Research (WCRF/AICR), have been associated with breast
cancer22,23 while the causes of prostate cancer, including diet,
are poorly understood. In experimental animals14 timing of
eating has been shown to modify the effects of diet such as
obesity following a hypercaloric diet in mice when eating at
the “wrong” time (during the day in mice) compared with
eating during the night (normal eating time for mice).
We assessed in a large population-based study in Spain
whether timing of eating and sleep patterns are associated
with breast and prostate cancer risk, the two most common
night shift related cancers in humans. We also evaluated
whether circadian timing of meals modifies the effect of fac-
tors associated with cancer risk, such as adherence to cancer
prevention recommendations.
What’s new?
Evidence shows that long-term disruption of endogenous circadian rhythms may be associated with cancer. The effects of mis-
timed sleeping and eating patterns that come with modern life are however less clear. This large Spanish population-based
study examined whether meal timing and sleep patterns are associated with the two most common nightshift-related cancers.
Adherence to a more diurnal eating pattern, and specifically an early supper and a long interval between last meal and sleep
were associated with a lower breast and prostate cancer risk, stressing the importance of evaluating circadian rhythms in diet
and cancer studies and revisiting recommendations for prevention.

 Methods
Study population
MCC-Spain (http://www.mccspain.org) is a population-based
case-control study including cases from five tumors and popula-
tion controls conducted in 12 Spanish regions in 2008–2013.24
In this analysis we included 1,738 breast and 1,112 prostate inci-
dent cancer cases aged 20–85 who were histologically confirmed,
and who lived in the catchment area of the participating hospi-
tals for at least 6 months. Controls (1,910 women; 1,493 men)
were randomly selected from primary health centers and were
frequency matched by sex, geographical area and age. Response
rates varied by center and on average were 72% among cases
and 52% among controls. After excluding subjects who had
ever done night shift (partly or entirely working between 00:00
and 6:00 am at least 3 nights per month), 1205 breast cases,
621 prostate cases, 1,321 women controls and 872 men controls
with complete information on chronotype and timing of activi-
ties questionnaire were included. The study was approved by
the Ethics committees of the participating institutions. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Data collection
Face-to-face interviews included information on potential risk
factors for breast and/or prostate cancer such as age, educa-
tional level, family socioeconomic level, race, BMI, family his-
tory of cancer, smoking status and for women, age of
menarche, parity, age at the first birth, menopausal status,
oral contraceptive use and history of hormonal replacement
therapy. Information on leisure time physical activity (type,
frequency and duration) was requested for all activities held
over lifetime. Current sleep duration and sleep problems that
persisted for at least 1 year were also assessed. Diet habits
were reported through a self-administered validated food fre-
quency questionnaire including 140 food items.25 Nutrient
intake was estimated using food composition tables published
for Spain.26 Chronotype was assessed through a follow-up
phone interview and the use of the Munich Chronotype
Questionnaire
(MCTQ).27
Information
on
eating
habits
included number of meals, duration and timing. Information
was requested for patterns at age 40 (or current age for youn-
ger subjects) and at 1 year prior to diagnosis (cases) or inter-
view (controls), and also separately for working days and
weekends. Since results did not differ substantially between
reports on eating patterns at age 40 and at 1 year prior to
diagnosis (cases) or interview (controls), or of eating patterns
in work and weekend days, here we only report results for
patterns at age 40 and work days (to avoid missing values for
subjects not reporting weekend patterns). Clinical information
was collected from medical records including tumor hormonal
receptor status, differentiation grade and histological type.
A WCRF/AICR score was constructed, incorporating six
recommendations for cancer prevention (body fatness, physi-
cal activity, foods and drinks that promote weight gain, plant
foods, animal foods and alcoholic drinks).28 The total WCRF/
AICR score ranged from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating
greater adherence to the WCRF/AICR recommendations. The
score was further categorized into sex-specific tertiles accord-
ing to the distribution of the score in controls.
Chronotype (MSFcorr) was estimated as the mid-sleep time
on free days (MSF5 [sleep onset on free day 1 (sleep duration
on free day)/2)], corrected for oversleep on free days compared
with working days (MSFcorr 5 [MSF – (sleep duration on free
day-sleep duration on a working day)/2]. Chronotype was
assessed as a continuous score expressed in local time, and in
tertiles based on the sex-specific distribution of MSF among
controls (Females: morning type: MSFcorr< 03:55 hr, neither
type: MSFcorr5 03:55–04:45 hr, evening type: MSFcorr> 04:45
hr;
Males:
morning
type:
MSFcorr< 03:35,
neither
type:
MSFcorr5 03:35–04:20, evening type: MSFcorr > 04:20).
Statistical analysis
We used unconditional logistic regression analysis and calcu-
lated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
We adjusted for matching variables (age, center), socioeco-
nomic status (education: highest grade completed, less than
primary school, primary school, secondary school and univer-
sity) and, in women, menopausal status. Premenopausal status
was defined as presence of menstruation during the last year.
There is a lack of prior knowledge on the association of can-
cer risk factors with eating times and we therefore did not use
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to select potential confound-
ers. We empirically further adjusted for variables that could
be related either with the exposure or are a cause of the dis-
ease including family history of breast/prostate cancer in first
degree relatives; smoking; BMI (normal weight <25; over-
weight,
25–30;
obese
�30);
breast
feeding
and
parity
(women); WCRF/AICR score; chronotype; socioeconomic sta-
tus score (ranging from 0 to 7) based on a combination of
information on education of parents, occupation of the sub-
ject and education of the subject; and urban vulnerability to
measure socioeconomic status at area level coded from 0 to
1.29 Finally, we also adjusted for sleep (duration; reported
sleeping problems), indoor light when sleeping (reported
using a four digit Likert scale: (i) Total darkness; (ii) Almost
dark; (iii) Dim light and (iv) Quite illuminated), and (for sub-
jects in Barcelona and Madrid) also residence outdoor blue
light spectrum. The latter was evaluated using geocoded resi-
dence of the subjects, Geographic Information System and
modeling of light from digital photos taken by astronauts at
the International Space Station as described in Garcia-Saenz
et al..30 Further adjustment to the above mentioned variables
made minimal difference in risk estimates and these results
are fully presented in Supporting Information Tables.
We calculated joint effects for the combination of both can-
cers applying effects meta-analysis of adjusted ORs using fixed
or random effects based on I2 index to assess the degree of het-
erogeneity. We tested possible interactions between eating and
sleep time variables with chronotype and the WCRF/AICR score
using the likelihood ratio test. We evaluated the association

 <0.001). Around 27% of breast cancer cases adhered to a
healthy lifestyle (WCRF/AICR score above 4.5) compared
with 31% for controls and a similar difference was observed
for prostate cancer (score above 4.25 for prostate, Table 1).
There were no marked differences between cases and controls
for most other variables.
Nearly all subjects had breakfast, lunch and supper (Sup-
porting Information Table S1), about a third had an after-
noon snack and about 7% had an after supper snack.
Breakfast was on average around 8:30 am, lunch at 2 pm and
supper at 9 pm. Patterns were similar in cases and controls
and meal patterns were, generally, similar in weekdays and
weekends.
Timing of meals and time elapsed between supper and
sleep
The distribution among controls of potential risk factors for
breast and prostate cancer in relation to short or long time
elapsed between supper (main evening meal) and sleep are
shown in Table 2. In men and to a less extent in women,
never smokers tended to have shorter time elapsed, and the
same pattern was observed for morning types in both sexes,
nulliparous women and low educational level men. No differ-
ences were seen by BMI.
Cancer risk decreased with increasing time between supper
(main evening meal) and sleeping (Table 3). Compared with
subjects sleeping immediately after supper, those sleeping two or
more hours after supper had a 20% reduction in cancer risk for
breast and prostate cancer combined (adjusted OR5 0.80,
95%CI 0.67–0.96). This effect was slightly more pronounced for
prostate cancer (OR5 0.74, 95%CI 0.55–0.99, Table 3); risk
declined steadily and a test for departure from linearity was not
statistically significant (Fig. 1). A similar but less strong pattern
was observed for breast cancer (OR5 0.84, 95%CI 0.67–1.06),
also with a steady decline with time elapsed since supper (Fig.
1). Having an evening meal before 9 pm compared with having
supper after 10 pm (Table 3) was associated with decreased risk
for both cancers combined (OR5 0.82, 0.67–1.00) an effect that
was slightly more pronounced for prostate (OR5 0.75, 0.53–
1.07) than breast cancer (OR5 0.85, 0.66–1.09). We examined
cancer risk combining time of supper and time interval between
supper and sleep. Subjects having both earlier supper (before 9
pm) and long interval between supper and sleep (>2 hr) had
an
approximately
25%
decreased
combined
cancer
risk
(OR5 0.76, 0.57–1.0) compared with those having supper after
10 pm and short supper-sleep interval. This pattern was also
observed in each of the two cancers individually (Table 3).
Mutually adjusting time of supper and time interval
between supper and sleep, resulted to slightly less pro-
nounced ORs compared with those of models evaluating
each time variable separately shown in Table 3. For both can-
cers combined the OR for long time elapsed between supper
and sleep after adjusting for time of supper was 0.84 (0.69,
1.02) while the corresponding adjusted OR for early supper
was 0.88 (0.70, 1.10). Time from supper to breakfast was not
associated with risk in either cancer (data not shown).
Effect of supper-sleep timing by chronotype and WCRF/
AICR score
The association of chronotype with breast or prostate cancer
(Table 4) indicated a higher protection of time elapsed
between supper and sleep for morning types (OR both can-
cer 5 0.66,
0.49–0.90)
compared
with
intermediate
(OR 5 0.85, 0.62–1.16) or evening types (OR 5 0.86, 0.57–
1.30). This pattern was observed in both breast (OR morning
type 5 0.65, 0.44–0.97) and prostate cancer (OR morning
type 5 0.67, 0.41–1.10) (Table 4). An evaluation of more
extreme chronotype groups was based on small numbers and
estimates were unstable (not shown).
High adherence to cancer prevention policies (Table 5) was
associated with a protective effect for breast cancer (OR5 0.84,
0.67–1.04) compared with low adherence while a less pro-
nounced effect was observed for prostate cancer (OR5 0.90,
0.66–1.25). Effects of time elapsed between supper and sleep in
both cancers combined were more pronounced among subjects
adhering to cancer prevention recommendations as evaluated
through the WCRF/AICR score (OR5 0.65, 0.44–0.97; high
adherence)
compared
with
those
with

adherence
(OR5 0.90, 0.66–1.22) (Table 5). This pattern was observed for

Effects by tumor subtype
For breast cancer there were no consistent patterns observed
for time elapsed between supper and sleep and cancers with
estrogen or progesterone receptors positive tumors or Her21
tumors while analyses on triple negative tumors were based
on a small number of cases (Supporting Information Table
S2). The protective effect of the time elapsed between supper
and sleep observed for prostate cancer was more pronounced
for prostate cancer cases with a Gleason score >7 at diagno-
sis (RRR 5 0.62, 95%CI 0.43–0.89) compared with an RRR of
0.89 (95%CI 0.61–1.29) for those with a score of 7 or less
(test for heterogeneity p values 0.12) .
Further adjusted models
Regression models adjusting for basic variables (age, center,
education and menopausal status for women) gave similar
results with those including in addition variables related to
socioeconomic status (socioeconomic score and urban vulner-
ability index, Supporting Information Table S3). For breast
cancer ORs (95%CI) from models with additional socioeco-
nomic adjustment were 0.84 (0.65, 1.07) for >2 hr supper/
sleep interval vs. less than 1 hr, 0.83 (0.64, 1.09) for supper
before 9 pm vs. after 10 pm, and 0.68 (0.47, 1.00) for long

Discussion
In this study we found that meal timing was associated with
prostate and breast cancer risk and specifically that adherence
to diurnal eating patterns and particularly early suppers and
a longer supper-sleep time interval were associated with a

 lower cancer risk. This is, to our knowledge, the first epide-
miological study showing long term health effects associated
with mistimed eating patterns.
The present study suggests that changes in timing of cir-
cadian controlled activities in sleep or diet that are less
extreme than those observed in night shift work, are associ-
ated with long term health effects increasing the risk of the
most prevalent cancers worldwide. The plausibility of an
effect of mistimed eating activities on long term health effects
is supported mostly by experimental evidence with little
human
evidence
being
available.
Acute
circadian
misalignment of the sleep/wake and feeding cycle experimen-
tally induced in healthy, nonshift workers, was associated
with disrupted glucose, insulin, leptin and cortisol rhythms in
as few as three days.2 A recent study among shift workers
provided evidence of a direct link between night eating and
higher levels of markers of inflammation and cardiometabolic
risk.31 In our study we examined the effect of a wide spec-
trum of protective/risk factors estimated through the WCRF/
AICR score that have been shown to predict cancer occur-
rence, and showed that timing of eating and sleep may mod-
ify these effects. This is similar to the pattern observed in

 experimental animals where, for example, obesity was pro-
duced not only by the provision of a hyper-caloric diet but
rather by providing this diet at the “wrong” time.14 The
World Cancer Research Fund estimates that about a quarter
to a third of the commonest cancers are attributable to excess
body weight, physical inactivity and poor diet, making these
the most common causes of cancers after smoking.32 If tim-
ing is proven to be a significant modifier of these effects then
it would be important to also define eating and sleep time as
one of the recommendations.
We showed that individual preference for morning activities
tended to be associated with a higher protection of diurnal eat-
ing patterns in both cancers compared with the effect observed
in evening types. Individual chronotype is a human attribute
believed to have a genetic basis (although other factors like age
may also play a role) that reflects the circadian phase of entrain-
ment12 and that reflects personal preference for activities in the
morning or evening. It has been suggested that adaptation to
evening mistimed activities is more difficult in subjects whose
biological rhythms seem to function better during early hours
(morning types)13 while evening types (subjects with a later cir-
cadian phase) may adapt faster to night shift work or to night
time activities. The pattern we observed, although not very pro-
nounced, follows the expected pattern. This is, however, an
understudied area of research particularly regarding long term
effects of chronotype limiting the prediction of individual risk
and planning of prevention policies.
The main strengths of the study are the fairly large sample
size, the detailed questionnaire used that was specific on cir-
cadian patterns of diet and an internationally used and vali-
dated questionnaire on chronotype. Although the circadian
pattern questionnaire is extensive and requested information
for different time periods in life and separately for weekdays
and weekends, the retrospective assessment of eating patterns
is the main limitation of the study. The reliability of retro-
spective assessment of food consumption has well known
limitations. Even large cohort studies on food consumption
have provided markedly different results on diet and cancer.
Dietary data might be subject to measurement error; never-
theless, we used a previously validated FFQ for Spanish pop-
ulations, and aggregated food group data was corrected using
cross-check questions.33,34 Nonetheless, it could be expected
that questions on timing of eating, for example, “At what
time do you usually have supper?” are better recalled than
detailed retrospective data on specific foods. However, there
are limited population data on timing of eating patterns and
on validity of the questions on timing and to this extent the
degree of misclassification is unknown. It is unlikely that this
misclassification has affected differentially cases and controls
particularly since most cases were contacted and interviewed
shortly after diagnosis. A further limitation of the study is
that variability in meal timing in our population was fairly
small and although this does not bias effect estimates it may
affect precision. Finally, although the study is not small, con-
fidence intervals for some of the associations particularly in
stratified analyses are fairly wide. Findings should be repli-
cated if data are available, in cohort studies.
The implications of these findings refer both to research
and to public health. Research on nutrition has focused on
quantity, type of foods and also on patterns of diet. There
has been minimal research on timing of eating patterns and
this has mainly focused on the evaluation of eating restric-
tion during fasting. It is necessary to further evaluate in
humans the existing evidence from animal experiments
showing that timing of eating has profound implications on
metabolism of foods and on health. Public health implica-
tions are well recognized as is the lack of evidence based
research on several aspects of recommendations of diet,15
for example, the beneficial effect of having breakfast or of
having few or many meals during the day. If these findings
are confirmed they will have profound implications on rec-
ommendations for the timing of the last main meal, particu-
larly for cultures such as those in southern Europe were
supper is late.
In conclusion, this is the first study in humans showing
that adherence to a more diurnal eating pattern and specifi-
cally a long interval between last meal and sleep is associated
with a lower cancer risk. The hypothesis we tested is sup-
ported by experimental evidence and stresses the importance
of evaluating circadian rhythms in studies on diet and cancer.
