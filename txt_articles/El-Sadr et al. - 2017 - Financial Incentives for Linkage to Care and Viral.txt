IMPORTANCE Achieving linkage to care and viral suppression in human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-positive patients improves their well-being and prevents new infections. Current
gaps in the HIV care continuum substantially limit such benefits.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives on linkage to care and viral
suppression in HIV-positive patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A large community-based clinical trial that randomized
37 HIV test and 39 HIV care sites in the Bronx, New York, and Washington, DC, to financial
incentives or standard of care.
INTERVENTIONS Participants at financial incentive test sites who had positive test results for
HIV received coupons redeemable for $125 cash-equivalent gift cards upon linkage to care.
HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy at financial incentive care sites received
$70 gift cards quarterly, if virally suppressed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Linkage to care: proportion of HIV-positive persons at the
test site who linked to care within 3 months, as indicated by CD4+ and/or viral load test
results done at a care site. Viral suppression: proportion of established patients at HIV care
sites with suppressed viral load (<400 copies/mL), assessed at each calendar quarter.
Outcomes assessed through laboratory test results reported to the National HIV Surveillance
System.
RESULTS A total of 1061 coupons were dispensed for linkage to care at 18 financial incentive
test sites and 39 359 gift cards were dispensed to 9641 HIV-positive patients eligible for gift
cards at 17 financial incentive care sites. Financial incentives did not increase linkage to care
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73-1.67; P = .65). However, financial incentives
significantly increased viral suppression. The overall proportion of patients with viral
suppression was 3.8% higher (95% CI, 0.7%-6.8%; P = .01) at financial incentive sites
compared with standard of care sites. Among patients not previously consistently virally
suppressed, the proportion virally suppressed was 4.9% higher (95% CI, 1.4%-8.5%;
P = .007) at financial incentive sites. In addition, continuity in care was 8.7% higher (95% CI,
4.2%-13.2%; P < .001) at financial incentive sites.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Financial incentives, as used in this study (HPTN 065),
significantly increased viral suppression and regular clinic attendance among HIV-positive
patients in care. No effect was noted on linkage to care. Financial incentives offer promise for
improving adherence to treatment and viral suppression among HIV-positive patients.

ntiretroviral therapy resulting in viral suppression dra-
matically reduces human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-relatedmorbidityandriskofHIVtransmission.1-4
To realize these benefits, gaps in the HIV care continuum must
be minimized.5-8 In the United States, approximately 13% of
HIV-positiveindividualsareunawareoftheirHIVinfectionand
only 55% of patients diagnosed with HIV have achieved viral
suppression.9
Financial incentives (FI) can assist in achieving desirable
health behaviors.10-12 In a meta-analysis13 of clinical trials that
used cash transfers for health behaviors, 10 of 11 studies dem-
onstrated a positive effect, including 3 for medication adher-
ence. Other studies have shown their effectiveness in decreas-
ing risk for acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted
infections.14-17
The potential for FI to close the gaps in the HIV care con-
tinuum motivated the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN)
study, HPTN 065, which evaluated the effectiveness of FI for
improving linkage to care and viral suppression in the Bronx,
New York, and Washington, DC, 2 communities severely af-
fected by HIV.18
Methods
Study Setting
Bronx, New York, and Washington, DC, HIV test sites with
the highest number of newly HIV diagnosed individuals
and HIV care sites treating the largest number of HIV-
positive patients, determined based on 2008 to 2009 HIV
surveillance data, were approached for potential study
participation.18 The trial protocol is available in Supplement
1. The CONSORT diagram in Figure 1 shows the cascade of
site selection and randomization. HIV test and care sites
were separately randomized to FI or standard of care (SOC).
Test sites provided FI from April 2011 until December 2012,
and care sites from February 2011 through January 2013.
Data from US surveillance system for 2010 were considered
as baseline data.
Financial Incentive Interventions
Individuals who tested positive for HIV at an FI HIV test site
received a coupon redeemable within 3 months for 2 cash-
equivalent gift cards: $25 on getting blood drawn for HIV-
related tests and $100 on meeting with a clinician and devel-
oping a care plan. Few HIV test sites offered coupons to known
HIV-positive persons who had not been in care for at least 12
months.
HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy at FI
care sites were eligible for incentives only if they were al-
ready engaged in care at that site (ie, had at least 1 prior viral
load measurement there within the last 3 to 9 months). Such
patients could qualify for a $70 gift card if their plasma viral
load was suppressed (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL), for a maxi-
mum of once every 3 months for the duration of the FI com-
ponentofthestudy(fromFebruary2011throughJanuary2013).
Clinicians received information on prevailing HIV treatment
guidelines.19
Study Outcomes
The outcomes for linkage to care, viral suppression, and con-
tinuity in care were assessed using data routinely reported to
each jurisdiction’
s HIV surveillance system.18,20 All con-
firmed diagnoses of HIV from HIV test sites were reported by
providers and specific HIV-related test results (positive find-
ings on Western blot, HIV RNA viral load, and CD4+ cell count)
were reported by laboratories to the local surveillance sys-
tem. Site-aggregated data per calendar quarter from 2010
through2013weretransmittedtotheHPTNstatisticalanddata
management center for analysis.
For linkage to care, the primary outcome was the pro-
portion of individuals testing positive at each HIV test site
who linked to care within 3 months, as indicated by those
individuals’ record of CD4+ cell count or viral load test
result in the surveillance system. HIV-positive patients were
eligible if they were either newly diagnosed (based on no
previous report in the surveillance system of a positive
Western blot finding) or previously diagnosed but out of
care (evidenced by no reported CD4+ cell count or viral load
test result in the prior year).
For viral suppression, the primary outcome was the pro-
portion of established patients at each HIV care site with sup-
pressed viral load, assessed at each calendar quarter. For each
quarter, patients were considered established in care if HIV
laboratory test results were reported from that site in 2 differ-
ent calendar quarters over the prior 15 months. A patient was
considered virally suppressed if a viral load had been mea-
sured within 6 months and the most recent viral load was less
than 400 copies/mL. Patients with no viral load test results in
the past 6 months were assumed not suppressed. Viral sup-
pression was evaluated for each site based on all viral load test
results, regardless of whether these were from patients on an-
tiretroviraltherapy(treatmentstatusisnotcapturedinthesur-
veillance system). Consistent viral suppression at baseline was
defined as having a viral load of less than 400 copies/mL in
every quarter in 2010.
For continuity in care (among established patients), the
outcome was defined as the proportion of patients with CD4+
cell count or HIV viral load test results in the surveillance sys-
tem during at least 4 of the prior 5 calendar quarters.
Key Points
Question Can the use of financial incentives improve linkage to
care and viral suppression for human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-positive patients?
Findings In this community-based clinical trial, 37 HIV test and 39
HIV care sites in the Bronx, New York, and Washington, DC, were
site-randomized to financial incentives or standard of care.
Financial incentives significantly increased viral suppression and
regular clinic attendance among HIV-positive patients; however,
financial incentives did not have a significant effect on linking
HIV-positive individuals to care.
Meaning Use of financial incentives can lead to increased viral
suppression and regular clinic attendance among HIV-positive
patients in care.

 Statistical Methods and Analyses
Site randomization aimed to achieve balance between arms by
site size and preintervention endpoints, as measured by pre-
randomization (2008-2009) surveillance data: for test sites,
balance in both the number of HIV-positive individuals iden-
tified in the previous year and the proportion of those linked
to care within 3 months of HIV diagnosis; for care sites, bal-
ance in both the number of HIV-positive patients in care in the
previous year and the proportion with viral suppression.18,21
Sample Size
For the linkage to care intervention, a sample size of 40 HIV
test sites (20 per arm) was estimated to provide 80% power
to detect a 13% increase in linkage to care, assuming an aver-
age of 54 HIV diagnoses per site and an intraclass correlation
of 0.18. For the viral suppression intervention, a sample size
of 40 HIV care sites (20 per arm) was estimated to provide 90%
power to detect a 6% increase in viral suppression, assuming
an average of 220 patients per site and an intraclass correla-
tion of 0.10.
Statistical Analyses
The linkage to care intervention effect was estimated using lo-
gistic regression for a binary outcome of linkage to care ad-
justedforbaselinesiteproportionlinkedtocareandarm,using
ageneralizedestimatingequation(GEE)withexchangeablecor-
relation structure.
The intervention effect for viral suppression was esti-
mated using linear regression for the site-aggregated propor-
tionofvirallysuppressedpatientsineachofthe5quarterswith
arm as the primary covariate, adjusting for sites’baseline pro-
portion virally suppressed, weighted by the average number
of patients at each site during the assessment period, and using
a GEE approach with exchangeable correlation structure to ac-
count for 5 quarterly measures for each site. The same mod-
eling approach was used for continuity in care, but adjusted
for site’
s baseline proportion of continuity in care. Thus, the
model estimates an intervention effect corresponding to the
increase in probability of viral suppression for a patient in care
at a site implementing FI compared with SOC. Analysis of the
peak intervention quarter (fourth quarter of 2012) for viral sup-
pression, a prespecified sensitivity analysis, used simple
weighted linear regression.
Four prespecified subgroup site analyses were planned:
study community (Bronx vs Washington, DC), smaller vs larger
sites (≤/> median number of patients), hospital vs community-
based sites and lower vs higher percent with viral suppres-
sion at baseline (≤/> median percent). In addition, the effect
of FI on patients not consistently virally suppressed prior to
the intervention was assessed by excluding from the analysis
all patients who achieved viral suppression in every quarter
of 2010.
Ethical Review
The study involved minimal risk. Because outcomes were re-
ported using only quarterly site-aggregated data already re-
ported to surveillance, no additional individual data were col-
lectedfromsites.Eachsite’
saffiliatedinstitutionalreviewboard
approved the study with a waiver of patient informed con-
sent granted under 45 CFR 46.116 (d). The protocol is avail-
able in Supplement 1.
Results
Study Sites
Study site selection is shown in Figure 1 and baseline site char-
acteristics are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. A total of
37 test sites (18 in the Bronx and 19 in Washington, DC) par-
ticipated in the linkage to care component and 34 were in-
cluded in the analysis (3 were excluded because no HIV-
positive patients were identified). During the baseline year, the
mean (SD) number of HIV-positive cases was 35 (45), and sites’
mean (SD) linkage to care rate was 74% (29%). Characteristics
of HIV-positive patients at baseline by arm were not statisti-
cally different (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
A total of 39 HIV care sites participated in the viral sup-
pression component (20 in the Bronx and 19 in Washington,
DC), with 37 included in the analysis: 1 site was excluded
owing to viral load test results not reported electronically to
the surveillance system, and 2 sites within the same facility
randomized to the same arm were combined owing to the in-
ability to disaggregate their data in the surveillance system.
At baseline, the mean (SD) number of patients in care was 374
(478), with a mean (SD) of 62% (16%) of patients virally sup-
pressed.CharacteristicsofpatientsatHIVcaresitesbyarmwere
not statistically different (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Linkage to Care
A total of 1159 HIV-positive individuals were identified from
test sites during the assessment; 389 in the Bronx and 770 in
Washington, DC. The mean number of HIV-positive individu-
als diagnosed per site was 34. Among 914 patients identified
in2012(303intheBronxand611inWashington,DC),641(70%)
were men, 384 (42%) were men who have sex with men (99
[33%] in the Bronx and 285 [47%] in Washington, DC), 630
(69%) were black (151 [50%] in the Bronx and 479 [78%] in
Washington, DC), 198 (22%) were Hispanic (140 [46%] in the
Bronx and 58 [9%] in Washington, DC), and 150 (16%) were
younger than 25 years (43 [14%] in the Bronx and 107 [17%] in
Washington, DC). Characteristics were similar by study arm.
A total of 1061 coupons were dispensed, 238 in the Bronx
and 823 in Washington, DC, and 79% were redeemed for both
$25 and $100 gift cards (Table 1).
Financial incentives did not significantly increase link-
age to care compared with SOC with adjusted odds ratio 1.10
(95% CI, 0.73-1.67; P = .65), with no effects noted in pre-
defined subgroups (Table 2).
Viral Suppression
At baseline, 16 208 patients were established in care at the sites
(9703 in the Bronx and 6505 in Washington, DC). At baseline
in 2010, most (10 201, 63%) were men (5485 [57%] in the Bronx
and 4716 [72%] in Washington, DC), 4518 (28%) were men who
have sex with men (1631 [17%] in the Bronx and 2887 [44%] in
Washington, DC), 9355 (58%) were black (4434 [46%] in the

 (Table 3) (Figure 2). The effect of FI was statistically significant
at sites in Washington, DC (6.6% higher; 95% CI, 1.9%-11.3%;
P = .006), at hospital-based sites (4.9% higher; 95% CI, 1.4%-
8.5%; P = .007), as well as at sites with lower and higher base-
lineviralsuppression(5.6%higher;95%CI,0.0%-11.3%;P = .05
and3.6%higher;95%CI,0.3%-7.0%;P = .03,respectively),but
not in the Bronx community-based sites or by size of the site.
At the peak of the intervention, overall viral suppression was
significantlyhigherby4.6%(95%CI,0.4%-8.8%;P = .031)atFI
sites (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). Among the subpopulation of
patients with viral load not consistently suppressed at base-
line, viral suppression was significantly higher by 4.9% (95%
CI, 1.4%-8.5%; P = .007) at FI sites (Table 3).
Continuity in Care
The proportion of patients with continuity in care was higher
by 8.7% (95% CI, 4.2%-13.2%; P < .001) at FI compared with
SOC sites. This finding was consistent in both cities; at hospi-
talandcommunity-basedsites,atsmalleraswellaslargersites;
and sites with higher viral suppression at baseline (Table 3).

 Discussion
Thissite-randomized,community-basedstudyincludedalarge
number of sites that provide HIV testing and HIV care in the
Bronx and Washington, DC, and for a substantial proportion of
the HIV-positive patients in both communities. This study, the
largest to evaluate the effectiveness of FI on HIV care-related
behaviors,demonstratedthatFIsignificantlyincreasedby3.8%
the proportion of patients with viral suppression at FI com-
pared with SOC sites. The effects observed were stronger in pa-
tients not consistently suppressed prior to the intervention. Fi-
nancial incentives also substantially increased the proportion
of patients reporting regularly for quarterly clinic visits.
However, FI did not have a significant effect on linking HIV-
positive individuals to care when compared with linkage at
SOC sites.
Few studies have assessed the efficacy of FI on HIV care-
related behaviors.22-27 In 1 study22 conducted among people
who inject drugs (PWID) in India, the use of vouchers for food
or household goods was associated with enhanced linkage to
care. In 2 US studies23,24 of PWID, contingency management
combined with voucher prize drawings increased adherence
to antiretroviral therapy. In 2 other US studies, 1 found that cue
training with monetary reinforcement was associated with a
transient increase in adherence but had no effect on viral sup-
pression, whereas the other did not demonstrate benefit of FI
on viral suppression among substance users.25,28
In this study, while FI had a statistically significant over-
all effect on the proportion of patients virally suppressed, this
effect was larger in Washington, DC. This may be owing to the
fact that New York State was an earlier adopter of initiating an-
tiretroviral therapy, regardless of CD4+ cell count, which may
havemadeitmoredifficulttodetecttheeffectofFIattheBronx
sites. In addition, FI may have had a more pronounced influ-
enceingettingpatientstomakeregularclinicvisitsandachieve
viral suppression in Washington, DC, because a smaller pro-
portion of patients made regular clinic visits at baseline com-
pared with the Bronx. We also found a significant effect of FI
at hospital-based care sites, possibly because they provided
care for less financially secure patients for whom FI may be
more meaningful.
It should also be noted that, in this study, all patients on
treatment at a site randomized to FI were eligible to receive
them if virally suppressed, including those already virally sup-
pressed. Thus, the larger effect of FI observed in the subset of
patients not consistently suppressed at baseline, albeit an out-
comenotdefinedapriori,mayreflectthepotentialaddedvalue
of FI among such patients.29 In a study that assessed the ef-
fectofFIonadherencetowarfarin,asignificanteffectwasonly
noted in individuals with characteristics associated with
nonadherence rather than in all patients.30
In this study, FI also significantly increased the propor-
tion of patients regularly attending clinic visits. Poor reten-
tion in care has been associated with higher mortality.31 Regu-
lar clinical and laboratory monitoring is important to enable
provision of adherence support, prevention counseling, or
screening for other health conditions.32 However, care should
be taken to safeguard against overutilization of clinic ser-
vices motivated by FI.
Use of FI to motivate behaviors remains controversial.13,17
We took measures to prevent untoward consequences. Prior to
study initiation, we consulted with the study’
s community ad-
visorygrouptodeterminetheappropriatevalueoftheFI.Inad-
dition, we used a site- rather than individual-randomized de-
sign to avoid the potential disruption of services and perceived
inequities if only some patients within a site received FI. Last,
to discourage patients from transferring care to FI sites, we
required that patients be in care at a site for at least 3 months
before receiving a gift card.

 with a wide range of patient volumes. The outcome measure
was laboratory-reported viral suppression, a biological indica-
tor rather than self-reported adherence.33,34 A unique feature
wastheuseofdatafromtheUSHIVSurveillanceSystemtomea-
sureoutcomes,anapproachparticularlywell-suitedforassess-
ing a community-level intervention and one that avoided the
selection bias inherent in recruitment and follow-up of indi-
vidual participants.
The study also had several limitations. The effect of FI may
have been diluted because, while only patients receiving anti-
retroviral therapy were eligible for FI, all patients in care at an
HIV care site (including those not on treatment) were included
in the assessment of the viral suppression outcome because
treatmentstatusisnotavailableinthesurveillancesystem.Over-
alldatacompletenesswassuperiorintheBronxcomparedwith
Washington, DC; moreover, for some nonresident patients re-
ceivingcareatsitesinWashington,DC,CD4+andviralloaddata
were reported to their jurisdiction of residence rather than to
Washington DC, possibly hindering complete capture of data.
We also attempted to mitigate the potential of assessment bias
caused by increased frequency of viral load assessment owing
to FI by defining the viral load suppression outcome over a
6-month period consistent with recommendations in prevail-
ing guidelines32; however, we are unable to assess whether this
approach was fully successful. Finally, the study had limited
power to asses changes in linkage to care because linkage was
high at baseline, and the number of HIV-positive individuals
identified per site was substantially lower than anticipated.
Conclusions
HPTN 065, the largest study to date to our knowledge to evalu-
ate the effect of FI on HIV-related care outcomes, demon-
strated the overall effectiveness of FI for achieving viral sup-
pression and regular clinic attendance. While seemingly
modest, an increase of 4% in viral suppression with FI may po-
tentially have considerable clinical and preventive implica-
tions on a population level, particularly in settings and among
patients with less robust viral suppression. A recent study in-
dicated that one-third of HIV-positive patients in care in the
United States had detectable viral load for substantial dura-
tions of time, limiting their individual benefit and increasing
their risk for transmitting HIV to others.35 Our study also dem-
onstrated both the feasibility of using FI in a large community-
wide effort and the successful linkage of a large-scale re-
search endeavor with the established HIV surveillance
system.36 Further analyses are ongoing to determine the cost-
effectivenessofFIonviralsuppressionbasedonourstudyfind-
ings. In our study, we found that FI had no significant effect
on linkage to care, an area ripe for further research.
In conclusion, while our findings offer an innovative in-
tervention for achieving the treatment and prevention poten-
tial of antiretroviral therapy, a strategy that offers great prom-
ise for control of HIV in the United States and globally, more
research is needed to determine how such an intervention can
be implemented in programs and at scale.
