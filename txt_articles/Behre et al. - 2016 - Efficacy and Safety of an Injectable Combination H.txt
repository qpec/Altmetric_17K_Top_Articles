Context: The development of a safe and effective reversible method of male contraception is still
an unmet need.
Objective: Evaluation of suppression of spermatogenesis and contraceptive protection by coad-
ministered im injections of progestogen and testosterone.
Design: Prospective multicentre study.
Setting: Ten study centers.
Participants: Healthy men, aged 18–45 years, and their 18- to 38-year-old female partners, both
without known fertility problems.
Intervention: Intramuscular injections of 200-mg norethisterone enanthate combined with
1000-mg testosterone undecanoate, administered every 8 weeks.
Main Outcomes Measures: Suppression of spermatogenesis by ejaculate analysis, contraceptive
protection by pregnancy rate.
Results: Of the 320 participants, 95.9 of 100 continuing users (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.8–
97.9) suppressed to a sperm concentration less than or equal to 1 million/mL within 24 weeks
(Kaplan-Meier method). During the efficacy phase of up to 56 weeks, 4 pregnancies occurred
among the partners of the 266 male participants, with the rate of 1.57 per 100 continuing users
(95% CI, 0.59–4.14). The cumulative reversibility of suppression of spermatogenesis after 52 weeks
ofrecoverywas94.8per100continuingusers(95%CI,91.5–97.1).Themostcommonadverseevents
were acne, injection site pain, increased libido, and mood disorders. Following the recommenda-
tion of an external safety review committee the recruitment and hormone injections were termi-
nated early.
Conclusions: The study regimen led to near-complete and reversible suppression of spermatogen-
esis. The contraceptive efficacy was relatively good compared with other reversible methods avail-
able for men. The frequencies of mild to moderate mood disorders were relatively high. (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 101: 4779–4788, 2016)

half of the 20th century with the availability of reliable,
reversible, steroidal contraceptive methods for women. By
the 21st century, the number of methods for women had
expanded, whereas options for men to control their own
fertility remain limited to withdrawal, condoms, and ster-

 that reversible hormonal suppression of spermatogenesis
in men can prevent pregnancies in their female partners,
although commercial product development has stalled
(1–3).
In previous clinical studies, testosterone administration
to men demonstrated contraceptive efficacy comparable
with modern female methods (4–6). However, supra-
physiological doses of testosterone had to be adminis-
tered, with potential long-term adverse effects in healthy
men. The testosterone dose can be reduced by coadmin-
istration of a progestogen (7); however, only 2 small-scale
studies evaluated the contraceptive efficacy and safety of
such a combination (8, 9). The present multicenter study
was designed to test the contraceptive efficacy and safety
in men of a regimen of im injections of a long-acting pro-
gestogen, norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), when ad-
ministered with replacement doses of a long-acting an-
drogen, testosterone undecanoate (TU), that appeared to
be promising in smaller clinical trials for reversible sperm
suppression without raising safety concerns (10–13).
Materials and Methods
Primary and secondary objectives
The primary objectives of the study were: 1) the rate of sup-
pression of spermatogenesis below the threshold criterion for
contraception of sperm concentration less than or equal to 1
million/mL induced by a regimen of NET-EN and TU adminis-
tered every 8 weeks for up to 26 weeks (up to 4 injection visits)
(5,14);and2)thelevelofcontraceptiveprotectionforanefficacy
period of up to 56 weeks.
Secondary objectives were: 1) maintenance of suppression of
spermatogenesis; 2) reversibility of the regimen as determined by
the return of sperm concentrations to the lower reference limits
of a fertile population (�15 million/mL or total sperm count to
�39 million per ejaculate), as defined by the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO) (15, 16); 3) alterations in circulating concen-
trations of steroid hormones and gonadotropins; 4) safety, as
monitored by reports of adverse events (AEs); and 5) acceptabil-
ity of the regimen, as assessed by questionnaires.
Study design
A prospective, phase II, single arm, multicenter study design
was applied. The research was conducted in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Har-
monisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use Good Clinical Practice guideline, following ethics
committee, institutional, and national approvals, as required, at
each of the 10 study sites (2 sites in Australia, Germany, and
United Kingdom and 1 site in Chile, India, Indonesia, and Italy),
as well as the approval of the WHO Ethical Review Committee
which functioned as the trial’s central Institutional Review
Board.
The study protocol included a screening phase lasting up to 8
weeks, a suppression phase of up to 26 weeks (ie, injections at 0,
8, 16, and 24 wk), during which men received the intervention,
an efficacy phase of up to 56 weeks with continued injections,
during which eligible couples were exposed to the risk of preg-
nancy, and a recovery phase (beginning 8 wk after the final
injection) for up to 1 year. The planned sample size (227
couples completing the efficacy phase) was calculated, assum-
ing a 1% true failure probability and 25% dropout during the
efficacy phase, with a goal to rule out a 4% failure rate with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI, 1 sided) and with
90% power. The trial was registered with International Stan-
dard Randomized Clinical Trial Number 07760234.
Study population
Healthy men, aged 18–45 years, and their 18- to 38-year-old
female partners, in stable, monogamous relationships, were in-
vited to participate in the study. Both partners were informed
about the nature, aim, and objectives of the study and gave writ-
ten informed consent before the initiation of any study proce-
dures, including screening.
Male volunteers were required to have a normal reproductive
state as demonstrated by sperm concentration more than or
equal to 15 million/mL or total sperm count more than or equal
to 39 million/ejaculate in 2 semen samples, with no gross ab-
normalities of sperm motility and morphology; normal gonad-
otropin and testosterone levels; history and clinical examination
without pathological findings relevant to the study, including
serious organic or psychiatric diseases and symptoms or signs of
a sexually transmitted infection; normal digital rectal examina-
tion of the prostate and prostate-specific antigen level within
normal range; laboratory test results not suggesting the presence
of any illness; and body mass index 20–32 kg/m2.
Female partners were required to be healthy with normal
reproductive state, no contraindication to pregnancy, and not
pregnant at the time of entry to the suppression phase.
For the couple, a stable, mutually monogamous partnership
for at least 1 year was required, along with a coital frequency of
twice/week on average, an intent to remain in the relationship for
the course of the study, no desire for pregnancy within the next
2 years, and willingness to accept a low but unknown risk of
pregnancy.
Participant follow-up
After completing screening, eligible couples entered the sup-
pression phase. The male participants received 200-mg NET-EN
(200 mg/mL) � 1000-mg TU (250 mg/mL) by 2 separate gluteal
injections every 8 weeks for up to 4 injection visits. All injections

 wereadministeredbyhealthprofessionals.Duringthistime,cou-
ples were instructed to use alternative, nonhormonal contracep-
tion, and the male partner provided semen samples after 8 and 12
weeks in suppression phase and then every 2 weeks throughout
the remainder of the suppression phase until the criterion for
entry into the efficacy phase was met.
Couplesenteredintotheefficacyphasewhenthemalepartner
had produced 2 consecutive semen samples within 2 weeks dem-
onstrating sperm concentrations less than or equal to 1 million/
mL. In this phase, he continued to receive the study injections
every 8 weeks, for a maximum of 7 injection visits. Couples
enrolled in the efficacy phase were asked to rely only on these
injections for contraception. In efficacy phase, semen samples
were analyzed every 8 weeks at each injection visit.

centrations remained higher than required during suppression
phasetoenterefficacy,orwhenspermconcentrationsrebounded
in efficacy phase with concentrations more than 1 million/mL
confirmed by a repeated semen analysis within 2 weeks, and at
early termination of injections (see below), the male participants
were transitioned into the recovery phase and follow-up visits
including semen analysis were scheduled every 4 weeks until
spermnumbersreturnedtothenormalrange(�15million/mLor
39 million per ejaculate) (15). Alternative contraception was
resumed if required to avoid pregnancy. The final visit (FV) was
scheduled within 30 days after sperm recovery as defined above
but not later than 36 weeks of recovery. In case of nonrecovery
of spermatogenesis, follow-up visits for semen analysis and mon-
itoring of AEs were continued for up to 52 weeks of recovery.
Urine pregnancy tests were performed at the beginning of the
suppression, efficacy, and recovery phases.
The first study participant was enrolled on September 4,
2008, and the last participant completed the study on May 30,
2012.
Physical examinations and registration of AEs
Physical examinations were done at baseline and at 8-week
intervals in the suppression, efficacy and up to week 16 of re-
covery phase. Digital rectal examination of the prostate was per-
formed at baseline and FV. Participants were asked about AEs at
each study visit from the beginning of the suppression phase.
Laboratory analysis
Semen analysis was performed according to WHO recom-
mendations (16). Safety clinical chemistry and serum hormone
analysis (screening samples only) were performed at each study
center by that center’s standard procedures. Further serum sam-
ples for hormone analysis in the suppression, efficacy, and re-
covery phase were frozen and shipped to the central laboratory
at the Center of Reproductive Medicine and Andrology in Mün-
ster, Germany, for analysis after completion of the study. Serum
concentrations of LH and FSH were determined using highly
specific time-resolved chemiluminescent microparticle immuno-
assay (Architect i1000; Abbott Diagnostics). Mean intraassay
coefficients of variation (CVs) were below 2% and mean inter-
assay CVs below 5%. Concentrations of testosterone and estra-
diol were determined using a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chroma-
tography-mass spectrometry system. For testosterone, the lower
limit of detection was 0.034 nmol/L, the lower limit of quanti-
tation was 0.084 nmol/L. For estradiol, the lower limit of detec-
tion was 2.61 pmol/L, the lower limit of quantitation was 7.71
pmol/L. Precision calculated as CV was 8.36% for testosterone
and 13.2% for estradiol, respectively. No serum samples for
central hormone analysis could be received from the Indonesian
center.
Acceptability questionnaires
Acceptability questionnaires were provided to the male par-
ticipants 4 times and female partners 3 times throughout the
study: suppression week 8 (male only), beginning of the efficacy
and recovery phases, and at the FV.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was done by statisticians of the WHO
DepartmentofReproductiveHealthandResearch(WHO/RHR)
according to an intent-to-treat analysis using SAS/STAT soft-
ware (17). Survival graphics and box-and-whisker plots were
generated using R software (18).
The normality assumption was not fulfilled for the repeated
continuous hormonal variables, and hence median change and
corresponding interquartile range for the last individual visits in
suppression phase, efficacy phase, and recovery phase compared
with baseline were reported. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used
for comparison of ranked mean change from baseline for these
hormonal outcomes. For all other continuous outcomes, the nor-
mality assumption was assumed, and mean change from baseline
and corresponding 95% CI were reported. Z test P values were
used to determine statistical significance at the 5% level, of the
mean decline/increase in these continuous outcomes.
For time-to-event outcomes, cumulative hazard rate proba-
bilities were computed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method (19), with 95% CI based on the complementary log-log
transformation. Contraceptive failure Pearl incidence rate with
95% CI was determined using Poisson distribution, using SAS
Procedure Genmod.
Early termination of injections
An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee
(DSMC) was established by WHO/RHR and CONRAD before
the start of the trial. At the scheduled meeting on January 17,
2011, the committee reviewed the interim analysis data and de-
termined the study met all criteria for continuation. As part of
WHO/RHR’s continuing monitoring review of all its ongoing
studies, the department’s Research Project Review Panel (RP2),
an external peer-review committee, met in March 2011, re-
viewed the same data and determined that, for safety reasons,
recruitment should be stopped and enrolled participants should
discontinue receiving injections and be transitioned to the re-
coveryphase.Spermrecoveryandotherdatacollectionandanal-
yses were to continue. This decision was based on RP2’s review
of study AEs and conclusion that the risks to the study partici-
pants outweighed the potential benefits to the study participants
andtotheincreasedprecisionofthestudyoutcomefindingsfrom
having the full cohort contribute to the final analysis. The AEs of
concern to the RP2 were reports of mood changes, depression,
pain at the injection site, and increased libido. The study DSMC,
the investigators, and the study participants were informed of
this decision by the study sponsors.

 Results
Disposition and characteristics of subjects
Baseline characteristics of male participants and female
partners are given in Table 1. The study participant flow-
chart is provided in Figure 1.
Primary study objectives
Suppression of spermatogenesis
Of the 320 participants who received at least 1 injec-
tion, 274 suppressed to a sperm concentration less than or
equal to 1 million/mL by the end of 24 weeks, with the rate
of 95.9 per 100 continuing users (95% CI, 92.8–97.9)
(Kaplan-Meier method; Figure 2A). There were no signif-
icant differences of cumulative sperm suppression rates by
ethnic group at the end of suppression phase (Kaplan-
Meier analysis; data not shown).
Contraceptive efficacy
During the efficacy phase, 4 pregnancies (3 delivered
and 1 terminated) occurred among the partners of the 266
male participants, with the rate of 1.57 per 100 continuing
users (95% CI, 0.59–4.14). All pregnancies occurred be-
fore the 16th week of the efficacy phase (Figure 2B). Three
of the 4 participants had a sperm concentration less than
or equal to 1 million/mL, but none was azoospermic be-
fore or after the estimated date of conception; the fourth
had sperm concentration of 0.2 million/mL a few days
before and 1.6 million/mL a few days after the estimated
date of conception. The Pearl index was calculated as 2.18
pregnancies per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.82–5.80).
Secondary study objectives
Maintenance
of
suppression
and
recovery
of
spermatogenesis
Six men exhibited sperm rebound during the 56-week
efficacy phase. Three men had a sperm rebound with re-
peated sperm concentrations more than 1 million/mL at
the first injection visit in efficacy phase (E1), 2 men at the
second injection visit in efficacy phase (E2), and 1 men at
the third injection visit in efficacy phase (E3). Sperm con-
centrations at injection visits with sperm rebound ranged
from 2.0 up to 16.6 million/mL.
The cumulative rate of recovery of spermatogenesis in
recovery phase to a sperm concentration of more than or
equal to 15 million/mL or total sperm count of more than
orequalto39millionperejaculateforthe266participants
transitioned to the efficacy phase was 94.8 per 100 con-
tinuing users (95% CI, 91.5–97.1) by 52 weeks of recov-
ery phase (Kaplan-Meier method) (Figure 2C).
Eightparticipantshadnotrecoveredtomeetthecriteriaof
return to fertility after 52 weeks in recovery phase, the last
visitaccordingtothestudyprotocol.Theseparticipantswere
followed on a case by case basis until they regained normal
sperm counts (n � 5, up to 74 wk of recovery) or declined
further follow-up (n � 2). One volunteer did not recover
within 4 years since his last injections.
Combined method failure rate
The combined method failure rate (Kaplan-Meier
method) was defined by nonsuppression by the end of
suppression phase, or sperm rebound during efficacy
phase, or pregnancy during efficacy phase. Applying this
definition, the combined method failure rate was 7.5%.
Reproductive hormones
Serum concentrations of LH and FSH were signifi-
cantly suppressed compared with preinjection baseline at
the last visits of suppression and efficacy phase, respec-
tively (Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 3). Testosterone

 and estradiol levels were significantly lower compared
with baseline at the last visits of suppression phase. At the
lastvisitsofefficacyphase,testosteronewasslightly,albeit
significantly, elevated and estradiol unchanged compared
with baseline. Although LH and testosterone were still
significantly decreased at the last measurements in recov-
ery phase, estradiol and FSH levels were statistically in-
distinguishable from baseline levels.
Physical findings, prostate-specific antigen, serum
chemistries, and hematology tests
There were a number of parameters that changed sig-
nificantly from baseline throughout the study. One par-
ticipant was discontinued due to an increase in blood pres-
sure (BP). No other changes were considered clinically
significant requiring medical follow-
up. Detailed analysis is provided in
the Supplemental Tables 2 and 3.
AEs
and
discontinuation
of
injections
During the course of the trial,
1491 AEs were reported by the male
participants;38.8%ofthesewereas-
sessed as being not related to use of
the study products. Table 2 summa-
rizes the AEs that were assessed as
being possibly, probably, or defi-
nitely related to use of the study
products and that were reported at
least 5 times, the number of partici-
pants reporting these events, the re-
lation to study products as judged by
the investigators, and the severity.
Thirty-one percent of the AEs listed
were considered “possibly related,”
40% “probably related,” and 29%
“definitely related”; 91% of all these
AEs were classified as mild and 99%
were considered mild or moderate.
The AEs determined as “product
related” were not unexpected, had
been previously reported after prog-
estogen and/or testosterone admin-
istration, and were noted on the
study consent form as possible side
effects. Sixty-two of the 65 reported
emotionaldisorderswerereportedat
1 center (Indonesia), with all of these
AEs at this center rated “mild” (see
also Table 2). Similarly, reports of
increases in injection site pain and
myalgia were primarily reported by
men of the Indonesian center (69 of 103 for injection site
pain and 65 of 71 for myalgia). Increased libido reports
were also high at the Indonesian center (63 of 124) and the
Chilean center (34 of 124), with 100% (Indonesia) and
73.5% (Chile) classified as mild. The number of reports of
acne was high (147), but these were distributed among the
centers. The Indian center reported very few AEs.
There was 1 death by suicide in the efficacy phase that
was assessed as not related to the study regimen. The par-
ticipant received 3 injections and committed suicide 1
month after the last injection. The family indicated that he
could not cope with his academic pressure. Other nonfatal
serious AEs were 1 case of depression (assessed as prob-
ably related) and 1 case of intentional paracetamol over-
Figure 1. Study participant flowchart. For the transition between the main study phases
(suppression, efficacy, and recovery phase), participants who discontinued in the study followed
1 of 2 patterns. Those groups of participants who discontinued in that particular study phase but
transitioned to recovery phase (n � 168) are on the right side. Those groups of participants who
discontinued study participation (n � 24 during the suppression phase, and n � 17 during the
efficacy phase) and did not transition to recovery phase (ie, with no follow-up data) are indicated
by interrupted lines on the left side of the flowchart.

 dose (assessed as possibly related) during the suppression
phase, as well as 1 case of tachycardia with paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation (assessed as possibly related) during the
recovery phase. Ten other serious AEs were assessed as not
being related to the study regimen.
Twenty men discontinued the study
due to product-related side effects.
Of these 20, 6 men discontinued only
for changes in mood, and 6 men dis-
continued for the following single
reasons: acne, pain or panic at first
injection,
palpitations,
hyperten-
sion, and erectile dysfunction. Eight
men discontinued for more than 1
side effect, including multiple rea-
sons related to changes in mood.
Acceptability questionnaires
Responses to key acceptability
questions by male participants and
female partners demonstrated high
rates of satisfaction with the method
of contraception applied in this
study (Table 3). Most of the couples
would use a method of contracep-
tion like this with highest positive re-
sponse rates of 87.9% for male par-
ticipants and 87.5% for female
partners at the beginning of efficacy
phase of this trial (Table 3).
Discussion
The present multicenter study dem-
onstrates that repeat injections of the
progestogen NET-EN when admin-
istered along with injections of the
androgen TU at 8-week intervals
lead to a near-complete suppression
of spermatogenesis and effective
maintenance of suppression of sperm
concentrations less than or equal to 1
million/mL. The rate of recovery of
spermatogenesis at 1 year after ceas-
ing hormone injections is compara-
ble with the rate when using other
androgen or androgen-progestogen
combinations for suppression of sper-
matogenesis (20). The number of cou-
ples completing the efficacy phase was
lower than planned because of the
early termination of injections. Never-
theless, the contraceptive efficacy is high, especially when
compared with other reversible methods available for men,
and is comparable with the efficacy of female oral contra-
ceptive methods, as typically used (21, 22).

 Clinical examinations and laboratory analyses did not
reveal any unexpected untoward findings in this study.
However, the frequency of reported moderate and severe
mood disorders including depression heightens awareness
of the potential behavioral effects
that this combination regimen may
have on some individuals. It is well
knownfromothertrialsofhormonal
regimens in men (which tested sup-
pression of spermatogenesis but not
contraceptive efficacy) that AEs are
reported frequently in these long-
term studies, even in a placebo group
(23). That being said, 2 independent
safety committees, the DSMC estab-
lishedbythesponsorsandtheWHO/
RHR RP2, came to different conclu-
sions on the safety of the regimen,
which resulted in early termination
of the study injections. Contracep-
tive efficacy studies cannot involve
placebo groups for obvious ethical
reasons. Therefore, a definitive an-
swer as to whether the potential risks
of this hormonal combination for
male contraception outweigh the
potential benefits cannot be made
based on the present results.
As noted, there appeared to be
study site differences in the number
of AE reports, including those AEs
related to changes in mood, sexual
interest, and injection site pain. Al-
though these AEs were not unex-
pected, particularly injection site
pain with a multiple injection dosing
regimen, the frequency of the mood
disorders at the Indonesian center,
for example, was unusually high, as
compared with reports of similar
AEs from earlier studies (10–12).
These are considered real differ-
ences, given the uniformity of study
instruments (AE forms) and training
of all investigators.
It cannot be excluded that some of
the AE reported on mood could be
due to levels of serum testosterone
below the reference range for some
participants at least at the end of the
injection intervals after the first TU
plus NET-EN injections (see Figure
3C and Supplemental Table 1). How-
ever, the lack of a placebo-treated control group and the
different time points in the suppression phase for assess-
ment of AE and serum hormones, respectively, does not

 allow for the appropriate statistical analysis in this study.
The still low levels of LH and testosterone at the end of the
recovery phase might be due to the prolonged terminal
elimination half-life of the progestogen preparation used
in this study. Due to the complexity of pharmacokinetics
of testosterone and progestogen levels and their interac-
tion it might be that a modified injection schedule for TU
and NET-EN administration could lead to fewer AE, es-
pecially on mood, in future studies on hormonal male con-
traception (24).

 Despite the various AEs and clinically intensive study
regimen, male participants and their partners found this
combination to be highly acceptable at the end of the trial,
evenafterbeingmadeawareoftheearlyterminationofthe
study intervention. More than 75% reported being at least
satisfied with the method and willing to use this method if
available, which supports further development of this ap-
proach (25).
This multicenter clinical study, the first large-scale,
multicountry trial of a combination regimen of testoster-
one and progestogen to investigate contraceptive efficacy
in men, provides an important reference for future efficacy
and safety trials of male contraception. Such trials are
urgently required to enable full assessment of the potential
of this approach to new contraceptive product develop-
ment (26, 27).
