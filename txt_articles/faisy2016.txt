IMPORTANCE Acetazolamide has been used for decades as a respiratory stimulant for
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and metabolic alkalosis, but no
large randomized placebo-controlled trial is available to confirm this approach.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether acetazolamide reduces mechanical ventilation duration in
critically ill patients with COPD and metabolic alkalosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The DIABOLO study, a randomized, double-blind,
multicenter trial, was conducted from October 2011 through July 2014 in 15 intensive care
units (ICUs) in France. A total of 382 patients with COPD who were expected to receive
mechanical ventilation for more 24 hours were randomized to the acetazolamide or placebo
group and 380 were included in an intention-to treat analysis.
INTERVENTIONS Acetazolamide (500-1000 mg, twice daily) vs placebo administered
intravenously in cases of pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis, initiated within 48 hours of ICU
admission and continued during the ICU stay for a maximum of 28 days.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with COPD receiving invasive mechanical
ventilation, the use of acetazolamide, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically
significant reduction in the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. However, the
magnitude of the difference was clinically important, and it is possible that the study was
underpowered to establish statistical significance.

hronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fre-
quent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.1
Noninvasivemechanicalventilationhasalteredtheout-
comes of patients with acute COPD exacerbation by reducing
the need for intubation.2,3 Nevertheless, patients with COPD
may still require invasive mechanical ventilation when non-
invasive ventilation fails or for an unrelated pathology.
Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis are the prin-
cipal acid-base disturbances in patients with COPD receiving
mechanical ventilation. Metabolic alkalosis can be caused by
many conditions encountered during ICU stays, including di-
uretic or glucocorticoid use, vomiting or nasogastric suction-
ing, and permissive hypercapnia induced by lung-protective
strategies.4 Furthermore, the acid-base disorders most fre-
quently observed while weaning patients with COPD off me-
chanical ventilation are mixed (ie, chronic respiratory acido-
sis and metabolic alkalosis).5 Metabolic alkalosis may inhibit
the activity of the central nervous respiratory command cen-
terandcardiacoutputoralteroxyhemoglobindissociationand
favors the development of hypokalemia and hypophosphate-
mia, thereby prolonging the weaning period and mechanical
ventilation duration for critically ill patients.6-10
Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been
used for decades as a respiratory stimulant in patients with
COPD and metabolic alkalosis.11 The classic mechanism of
acetazolamide’
s action as a respiratory stimulant is based on
the inhibition of the renal carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which
in turn decreases serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, leading
to increased minute ventilation via stimulation of peripheral
and central chemoreceptors. However, data from uncon-
trolled clinical studies yielded inconsistent effects when
acetazolamide was administered at usual doses (250 to
500 mg once or twice daily).12 Recent pharmacodynamics
models indicated that patients with COPD breathing with the
aid of mechanical ventilation might benefit from its respira-
tory stimulant effect after administration of higher doses.13,14
In designing the DIABOLO trial, we hypothesized that higher
acetazolamide doses (≥1000 mg/d) would shorten the
mechanical ventilation duration in critically ill patients with
COPD (trial protocol in Supplement 1).
Methods
Study Design
This multicenter, double-blind (participants, caregivers, in-
vestigators, and outcome assessors), parallel-group, random-
ized clinical trial was approved for all centers by the Comité
deProtectiondesPersonnesParis–Ile-de-FranceVI(ethicscom-
mittee: No. 2011-000492-14). The French National Commit-
tee for Health Research funded the study and convened a trial
steering committee and independent data monitoring com-
mittee.Asafetymonitoringcommitteewasnotconsiderednec-
essary because the acetazolamide doses had adhered to the
marketing authorization and the study design included daily
patient evaluation for adverse events or temporary contrain-
dications. The European Georges Pompidou Hospital Clinical
Research Center managed the study, from October 2011 to July
2014. Patients were enrolled (day 0) at 15 adult ICUs in France.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or
from their next of kin for patients unconscious at inclusion.
Definitive post hoc written consent was ultimately obtained
from patients who survived but were initially unable to pro-
vide informed consent.
Participants
Patients older than 18 years with a history of COPD according
to the American Thoracic Society criteria15 (smoking, other en-
vironmental risk factors, chronic cough, acute chest ill-
nesses, dyspnea, physical examination, and laboratory inves-
tigations such as chest radiography, lung function tests, or
arterialbloodgases)wereenrollediftheyrequiredinvasiveven-
tilation via an intubation or tracheotomy tube and were evalu-
ated within 24 hours after its onset. Exclusion criteria were ju-
dicial guardianship, no affiliation with the French health care
system,pregnancy,cysticfibrosisordiffusebronchiectasis,pre-
viousallergytoacetazolamideorsulfonamides,permanentac-
etazolamide contraindication, recent participation in an-
other interventional study with mechanical ventilation
duration as the primary end point, or investigator’
s decision
not to resuscitate.
Randomization and Allocation
Within 24 hours of starting invasive ventilation, patients
were randomized via a computer-generated assignment
sequence in a centralized, blinded fashion (Figure 1). The ran-
domization sequence was programmed in advance and gen-
erated by a statistician independent of the study. One-for-
one randomization was carried out, with stratification for
centers, respiratory status of the patients before hospitaliza-
tion (no respiratory assistance at home vs respiratory assis-
tance at home, whatever its nature [oxygen supplementation,
noninvasive ventilation, tracheotomy + ventilation]), and
disease severity at inclusion assessed with Simplified Acute
Physiology Score (SAPS) II less than 50 or 50 or higher. The
list was balanced by blocks of different sizes alternated in a
random manner. Physicians assigned the treatment after ran-
domization, which was accessible through dedicated web-
based software. Investigators, patients, and research staff
were masked to the randomization list.
Intervention
Afterinclusion,patientswereassignedtoreceiveeither500mg
or 1000 mg (when loop diuretics were coprescribed) of acet-
azolamide twice daily or placebo (10 mL of saline) in case of
pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis (serum bicarbonate
>26 mEql/L and arterial pH ≥ 7.35), monitored according to ar-
terial blood gases determined on mechanical ventilation be-
tween 7 AM and 8 AM from day 1 to the day invasive ventila-
tion ended (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Physicians in charge
were different from the investigators who monitored and pre-
scribed the tested treatment. Tested treatment was prepared
and blinded in each local pharmacy. Acetazolamide was sup-
plied as a freeze-dried powder. The product was reconsti-
tuted with saline and then administered immediately in the
ICU, as a slow intravenous injection. The placebo was sup-

plied in the form of a solvent (saline) and was administered in
the same manner. If a contraindication for the test treatment
arose (for details, see Supplement 2), it was temporarily sus-
pended until the contraindication had resolved. Patients with
pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis received acetazolamide or
placebo intravenously twice daily for a maximum of 28 days.
Treatment doses were based on recent pharmacodynamics
models predicting that 500 mg twice daily (or double-dose
when loop diuretics were coprescribed) were required to sig-
nificantly lower serum bicarbonate and raise minute ventila-
tion in patients with COPD breathing with the aid of a venti-
lator, regardless of the ventilation mode (volume-assisted or
pressure-support ventilation) used.13,14 Other treatments were
left to the discretion of the treating physicians and had to be
inaccordancewithclassicguidelines.1Investigatorswereaware
of the need to correct hypokalemia.
Readiness to wean was defined according to the criteria
of the Sixth International Consensus Conference on Inten-
sive Care Medicine held in 2005.16 The weaning strategy con-
sisted of the progressive decrease of pressure-support or
volume-assisted ventilation with progressively longer times
on a T-piece and was tailored by treating physicians, accord-
ing to the difficulty of the weaning process.17 External posi-
tive end-expiratory pressure was applied to counterbalance in-
trinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, typically 4 to 6 cm of
H2O. Criteria for extubation and reintubation were standard-
ized in a written protocol (for details, see Supplement 1). Pa-
tients enrolled were extubated when they tolerated, for at least
1 hour, a spontaneous breathing trial via a T-piece oxygen-
ated with the same inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) used dur-
ing mechanical ventilation. Patients satisfying spontaneous
breathing-trial criteria were extubated in the presence of a
physiotherapist and received supplemental oxygen to achieve
arterial oxygen saturation of 90% or more. Prophylactic use
of noninvasive ventilation after extubation was permitted.
Weaning was considered successful when reintroduction of
invasive ventilation was not required within 48 hours after its
termination.17 Tracheotomy indication and modalities for pa-
tients with prolonged weaning failure were left to the discre-
tion of the treating physicians. Group assignments for pa-
tientswhodiedbeforebeingweanedoffmechanicalventilation
or those who received no test treatment during the study pe-
riod were not modified, and data analysis was conducted on
an intention-to-treat basis.
Study Outcomes
The primary end point was the duration of invasive ventila-
tion. Secondary outcomes were the changes of serum bicar-
bonate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood
(PaCO2), pH, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood
(PaO2):FIO2 ratio and respiratory parameters (tidal volume,
respiratory rate, and minute ventilation), weaning duration,
the numbers of spontaneous breathing trials, unplanned
extubations and ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes,
use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation, successful
weaning, the duration of ICU stay, and in-ICU mortality.
Adverse events were monitored for 28 days. All outcomes are
defined in Supplement 2.
Statistics
The sample size was calculated a priori based on the follow-
ing assumptions: placebo group with an estimated mean (SD)
duration of mechanical ventilation of 12 (5) days based of one
of our preliminary studies,5 and because we expected to in-
clude the most severely ill patients with COPD (ie, requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation); acetazolamide-group pa-
tients, compared with those in the placebo group, would have
a potential 15% relative risk reduction for the primary end
point5 to be clinically relevant. Based on those estimates, we
calculated that 380 patients had to be enrolled to achieve 80%
power to detect that difference for the acetazolamide group
with a 2-sided α level of .05.
The analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat
population, which was defined as all patients who had under-
gone randomization, excluding those erroneously included.
Analyses were then confirmed on per-protocol population,
which is defined as the set of patients, who did not perform
any protocol violation that may interfere with primary crite-
ria evaluation (ie, patients receiving the allocated treatment;
patients with all the inclusion criteria met). Missing data were
only imputed for the end of invasive mechanical ventilation.
We used the mean hour of the end of invasive mechanical
ventilationofthecenterbecauseplannedextubationswereper-
formed around the same time. To take censored data into ac-
count (patients who died before extubation), the Kaplan-
Meier method was used to calculate the probabilities of being
successfully weaned off invasive ventilation during the 28-
day observation period. The generated Kaplan-Meier curves
were compared with the log-rank test. Quantitative variables
areexpressedasmeansandstandarddeviationormediansand
interquartile ranges (IQRs), when appropriate. Data were com-
pared with t tests, when the sample size of each group was 30
ormore,orWilcoxonrank-sumtests,whenonegroup’
ssample
size was less than 30. All tests were 2-sided. Either χ2 or Fischer
exact tests, as appropriate, were used to compare qualitative
variables, expressed as percentages. All comparisons in-
cluded the entire sample stratification (as prespecified). Haz-
ard ratios were calculated using a Cox model and the centers
weretakenintoaccountasarandomeffectusinggammafrailty
model.18 Tests of proportionality were performed including
time-dependent covariates in the Cox model. Post hoc sub-
groups were defined according to the presence or absence
(yes/no) of acute prolonged mechanical ventilation (≥96
hours),19 the preferential use (>50% of the time) of pressure-
support ventilation or not during the weaning period, the pre-
scription or not of loop diuretics or glucocorticoids, and the
presence or absence (yes/no) of pure metabolic alkalosis
(pH>7.42 and serum bicarbonate >26 mEq/L) at baseline.
P < .05 defined statistical significance. All analyses were com-
puted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

quently withdrew from the study, resulting in an intention-
to-treat population of 380 patients: 187 randomized to the ac-
etazolamide group and 193 to receive the placebo (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics of the patients in the 2 study groups
were comparable (Table 1). All 187 patients had endotracheal
intubation (100%) in the acetazolamide group vs 192 (99.5%)
with endotracheal intubation and 1 (0.5%) with tracheotomy
in the placebo group.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Thetotaldurationsofinvasiveventilationwasamedianof136.5
hours (IQR, 68.7 to 234.7 hours) in the acetazolamide group vs
163.0 hours (IQR, 86.2 to 242.9 hours) in the placebo group, for
a between-group difference of −16.0 hours (95% CI, −36.5 to
4.0 hours), which did not differ significantly (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Acetazolamide lowered the median daily change of
serum bicarbonate (−0.3 mEq/L; IQR, −1 to 0.4 mEq/L vs
0.3 mEq/L; IQR, −0.2 to 1.3 mEq/L), for a between-group dif-
ference of −0.8 mEq/L (95% CI, −1.2 to −0.05 mEq/L) and in-
creased the median daily PaO2:FIO2 ratio (7.8 mm Hg; IQR,
−1.5 to 20.5 mm Hg vs 3.5 mm Hg; IQR, −5.2 to 13.9 mm Hg),
for a between-group difference of 4.6 mm Hg (95% CI,
0.6-8.6 mm Hg) more than the placebo, but had no respiratory
stimulant effect on the median changes of respiratory rate 0.1
cycles/min (IQR, −0.8 to 1.0 cycles/min) vs 0.3 cycles/min (IQR,
−0.3 to 1.4 cycles/min), for a between-group difference of −0.3
cycles/min (95% CI, −0.7 to 0.0 cycles/min); a tidal volume of
4.1 mL (IQR, −7.1 to 28.0 mL) vs 3.8 mL (IQR, −8.6 to 19.4 mL),
forabetween-groupdifferenceof1.3mL(95%CI,−4.2to7.5mL);
or median minute ventilation change of 0.2 L/min (IQR, −0.2
to 0.8 L/min ) vs 0.2 L/min (IQR, −0.1 to 0.6 L/min), for a
between-group difference of 0.0 L/min (95% CI, −0.2 to
0.2 L/min) (eTable 1 and eFigures 2 and 3 in Supplement 2).
Moreover, other secondary outcomes also did not differ
significantly: durations of weaning off invasive ventilation,
numbers of spontaneous breathing trials, use of tracheotomy
ornoninvasiveventilationafterextubation,successfulweaning
rates, unplanned extubations, ventilator-associated pneumo-
nia episodes, other laboratory-parameter values, ICU stays
or in-ICU mortality rates (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Per-
protocol analysis yielded results similar to those of the
intention-to-treat analysis with respect to significant find-
ings (eTables 1 and 3 in Supplement 2).
Metabolic Alkalosis and Treatment Administration
As expected, the numbers of days with metabolic alkalosis and
treatment doses were significantly lower for the acetazol-
amide than for the placebo group (Table 2). A total of 53

a Range was preferred over IQR because several of the latter were (0-0).
Between-group differences for quantitative variables are expressed as
medians with the 95% CI around the median difference.
bMedian daily changes of arterial blood gases or respiratory parameters
corresponded to the differences between 2 consecutive days from day 1 to the
end of invasive ventilation. Arterial blood gases and respiratory parameters on
mechanical ventilation were measured between 7 AM and 8 AM Other
laboratory-parameter changes are given in eTable 2 in Supplement 2.
c Weaning was considered successful when invasive ventilation reintroduction
was not required within 48 hours after its termination. Criteria for extubation
and reintubation are detailed in Supplement 2. Weaning-failure causes are
given in eTable 2 in Supplement 2.
dAdverse events were considered serious when they required intensive care
procedures (use of vasopressors, hemodialysis, central venous
catheterization, cardiac pacing, or tube thoracostomy) or surgery, and those
events prolonged hospitalization or resulted in persistent or major disability or
incapacity.
e Metabolic alkalosis was defined as serum bicarbonate of more than 26 mEql/L
and arterial pH of 7.35 or more.
f Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by transthoracic

termination. In the case of temporary
interruption of the weaning
procedure, the total duration
corresponded to the number of hours
of attempted withdrawal until
successful weaning minus
discontinued hours.

diuretic effect5,20 or the increased oxygen saturation of
hemoglobin.8,11 Taken together, these findings indicated that
the inhibition of the renal carbonic anhydrase enzyme and the
resulting serum bicarbonate reduction did not trigger a suffi-
cient respiratory-stimulating effect to effect outcomes of criti-
cally ill patients with COPD. Nevertheless, this overall conclu-
sionmustbeconsideredwithprudence.Indeed,thestudymay
have identified a clinically important benefit of acetazol-
amide for the primary end point that did not demonstrate sta-
tistical significance because of a possible lack of power.
The between-group difference in median durations of in-
vasive mechanical ventilation was clinically substantial
(16 hours) although it did not the reach statistical signifi-
cance. Our trial was prospectively powered to detect a 15% dif-
ference in the invasive ventilation duration, considered clini-
cally relevant in light of the usual duration of intubation in
these patients.5,21-23 However, the observed median dura-
tions of invasive mechanical ventilation in the placebo and ac-
etazolamide groups were lower than anticipated for statisti-
cal power, complicating the study interpretation. This means
that the 10% reduction of invasive mechanical ventilation by
acetazolamide could have reached statistical significance if the
study was designed to detect such a difference. Similar pro-
portions of patients in the 2 groups did not develop meta-
bolic alkalosis or have transient treatment contraindications,
and intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses findings con-
verged. Moreover, the decision to consider weaning duration
a secondary outcome was based on the fact that weaning may
be discontinuous, making it difficult to measure its total time
accurately. For the same reason, the test treatment was ad-
ministered from day 1 in case of metabolic alkalosis.
Pharmacological factors could contribute to the absence
of a stronger acetazolamide respiratory effect. First, inad-
equate dosing could limit the drug’
s effect on respiratory
parameters: the serum bicarbonate decline that would cause
a clinically relevant respiratory effect (ie, PaCO2 decrease
>5 mm Hg) should be at least 5 mEq/L.12,14 A recent case-
control study showed that the use of insufficient acetazol-
amide dosage (500 mg/d) had no significant effect on the
duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients
with COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.24
Herein, we administered a dose that lowered serum bicar-
bonate but the corresponding respiratory effect was not
observed. Tissue compartmentalization of carbonic anhy-
drase isozymes and low acetazolamide selectivity might
explain why this drug had no benefit in terms of improving
minute ventilation and PaCO2 in patients with COPD receiving
respiratory support. Indeed, only the inhibition of carbonic
anhydrase isozymes II, IV, and XIII should induce a
respiratory-stimulating effect by increasing the respiratory
rate and tidal volume, whereas blockage of isozymes I and II
can modulate erythrocyte functions.12,25,26 Hence, our find-
ings might support further investigations of more selective
molecules targeting isozymes I, II, IV and XII, rather than
relying on the traditional concept of renal isozyme inhibition.
It cannot be excluded that higher acetazolamide doses could
have a double-sided effect on respiratory parameters by
increasing the respiratory muscle workload and causing
respiratory muscle fatigue. Pertinently, we observed that, out
to approximately 360 hours, the acetazolamide group per-
formed worse than the placebo group. However, post hoc
analysis did not show significant difference between patients
with or without acute prolonged mechanical ventilation.
A limitation of this study is the presence of mixed meta-
bolic alkalosis in most patients. Indeed, the lack of acetazol-
amide respiratory effect may be because so many of the
patients had a degree of metabolic alkalosis too mild for the
intervention. But previous models used to evaluate the acet-
azolamide effect on respiratory parameters in the present
study were based on patients with COPD patients and with
mixed metabolic alkalosis.13,14 Moreover, our post hoc analy-
sis did not show that patients with COPD and pure metabolic
alkalosis at baseline responded better than others. Another
possible limitation could be the presence of factors more
strongly influencing the discontinuation of mechanical venti-
lation or ICU outcomes (eg, age, severely limited airflow,
long-term glucocorticoid use or diaphragm atrophy).13,27-29
However, our study groups had similar overall characteristics
and cotreatments, and acetazolamide did not seem to have
greater effect on patients with COPD mechanically ventilated
for fewer than 96 hours.
Conclusions
Among mechanically ventilated patients with COPD and pure
or mixed metabolic alkalosis, the use of effective acetazol-
amide doses, compared with placebo, did not result in a sta-
tistically significant reduction in the duration of invasive me-
chanicalventilation.However,themagnitudeofthedifference
(16 hours) was clinically important, and it is possible that the
study was underpowered to establish statistical significance.
