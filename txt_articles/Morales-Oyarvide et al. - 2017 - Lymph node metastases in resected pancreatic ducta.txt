Background: Few studies have simultaneously assessed the prognostic value of the multiple classification systems for lymph node (LN)
metastases in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Methods: In 600 patients with resected PDAC, we examined the association of LN parameters (AJCC 7th and 8th editions, LN ratio (LNR), and log
odds of metastatic LN (LODDS)) with pattern of recurrence and patient survival using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression,
respectively. Regression models adjusted for age, sex, margin status, tumour grade, and perioperative therapy.
Results: Lymph node metastases classified by AJCC 7th and 8th editions, LNR, and LODDS were associated with worse disease free-
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (all Ptrendo0.01). American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition effectively predicted DFS and OS,
while minimising model complexity. Lymph node metastases had weaker prognostic value in patients with positive margins and distal
resections (both Pinteractiono0.03). Lymph node metastases by AJCC 7th and 8th editions did not predict the likelihood of local disease as
the first site of recurrence.
Conclusions: American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition LN classification is an effective and practical tool to predict outcomes in
patients with resected PDAC. However, the prognostic value of LN metastases is attenuated in patients with positive resection margins and
distal pancreatectomies.

 Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the
United States (Siegel et al, 2016). Regional lymph node (LN)
involvement is an important predictor of survival in patients
undergoing resection for pancreatic cancer (Lim et al, 2003; Richter
et al, 2003; Schwarz and Smith, 2006; Winter et al, 2006). The
current standard for pancreatic cancer staging is the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition system that
classifies nodal involvement as pN0 if no regional LN metastases
are present or pN1 when regional LN metastases are identified
(Edge et al, 2010).
Recent studies have suggested that the number of metastatic LN
provide additional prognostic information (Murakami et al, 2007;
Basturk et al, 2015; Malleo et al, 2015; Strobel et al, 2015).
Therefore, the upcoming 8th edition of the AJCC system will
stratify LN-positive patients into pN1 (metastases in 1–3 regional
LN) and pN2 (metastases in X4 regional LN) (Allen et al, 2017).
Several studies in pancreatic cancer and other malignancies have
suggested that prognosis is associated with the relationship of
metastatic-to-examined LN, as assessed by the LN ratio (LNR) and
log of the odds of metastatic LN (LODDS) (Slidell et al, 2008;
Valsangkar et al, 2013; La Torre et al, 2014; Riediger et al, 2016).
Simultaneous investigations of these different LN parameters in
relation to patient outcomes are lacking, particularly in large,
multi-institutional patient cohorts. How these LN parameters
predict patterns of disease recurrence (e.g., local vs distant
recurrence) is not well understood, yet has important implications
for perioperative treatment programmes. Recent clinical practice
guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) recommend the use of adjuvant radiation in patients with
LN metastases at resection (Khorana et al, 2016). In contrast,
current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for
treatment of pancreatic cancer do not take LN status into
consideration when recommending for or against radiation
treatment in the adjuvant setting (National Comprehensive
Cancer Network). Moreover, the number of examined LN and
presence of lymphovascular invasion have been reported as
prognostic factors particularly in patients with LN-negative disease
(Hellan et al, 2008; Takahashi et al, 2012; Valsangkar et al, 2013),
raising the question of whether these factors influence outcomes
differently in patients with LN-negative and -positive tumours.
The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the ability
of different LN classification systems to predict disease recurrence
and survival in a large series of patients with resected pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) from multiple US centres. As a
secondary goal, we also sought to determine whether LN
involvement predicts pattern of disease recurrence following
resection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. The initial patient population consisted of 600
patients who underwent surgical resection for PDAC at academic
and community hospitals in the United States. Surgery was
performed at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center
(DF/BWCC, Boston, MA, USA; n ¼ 274) between October 2002
and June 2015, at 35 academic and community hospitals between
September 2000 and June 2015 referred to the DFCI/BWCC for a
second opinion (n ¼ 87; list of hospitals in Supplementary Table 1),
at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC, Rochester,
NY, USA; n ¼ 90) between 1 March 2006 and 1 November 2013,
and at Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI, Stanford, CA, USA; n ¼ 149)
between September 1995 and May 2013. Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approval was granted at DF/BWCC, URMC, and SCI.
Patients who received care at DF/BWCC signed informed consent
for participation in this study. For those receiving treatment at
URMC and SCI, informed consent was waived as patients were
identified retrospectively on Institutional Review Board exempt
protocols.
Assessment of LN parameters. The AJCC (7th edition) system
classifies LN involvement as pN0 (no regional LN metastases), pN1
(regional LN metastases), or pNx (regional LN cannot be assessed)
(Edge et al, 2010). The upcoming AJCC (8th edition) system
classifies LN involvement as pN0 (no regional LN metastases), pN1
(metastases in 1–3 regional LN), pN2 (metastases in X4 regional
LN), or pNx (regional LN cannot be assessed) (Allen et al, 2017).
lymph node ratio was calculated as (no. of positive LN/ no. of
examined LN) and classified into four categories: 0, 0.01–0.20,
0.21–0.40, and 40.40 (Malleo et al, 2015; Strobel et al, 2015). Log
odds of metastatic LN was calculated as ((no. of positive LN þ 0.5)/
( no. of negative LN þ 0.5)), where 0.5 is added in the numerator
and denominator to avoid null and undefined values, and then
transformed to natural logarithmic scale (La Torre et al, 2014;
Riediger et al, 2016). We explored the number of examined LN and
LVI in secondary analyses.
Assessment of covariates. We collected data from medical
records, operative notes, and pathology reports. We assessed sex,
age, type of pancreatectomy, perioperative systemic and radiation
treatment, tumour location, AJCC (7th and 8th editions) pT stage,
tumour grade, resection margin status, LVI, and perineural
invasion. Resection margins were classified as R0 (no tumour cells
within 1 mm of any pathologic margin), R1 (microscopic foci of
tumour cells within 1 mm of a pathologic margin), R2 (gross
residual disease), or Rx (margins not evaluable). For patients
referred to DF/BWCC after undergoing surgery at another
institution, slides were rereviewed by DF/BWCC gastrointestinal
pathologists. The above covariates were considered for multi-
variable-adjusted model building as detailed below.
Outcome measures. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as
time between date of surgery and date of disease recurrence. For
patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, follow-up started on
the date preoperative treatment was initiated. Patients who were
alive and free of disease at the end of follow-up and those who died
without definitive evidence of recurrence were censored for DFS
analysis on the date of last clinical contact. Overall survival (OS)
was defined as time between date of surgery (or date of start of
neoadjuvant treatment) and date of death from any cause. Pattern
of first recurrence was classified as ‘local only’ (recurrence in/or
adjacent to the pancreatic remnant, retroperitoneum and periad-
ventitial
tissues
near
the
resected
pancreas),
‘distant
only’
(recurrence only outside areas defined by local recurrence), or
‘synchronous local and distant’ (evidence of local and distant
disease).
Follow-up
continued
through
28
June
2016
for
DF/BWCC patients, 17 March 2016 for URMC, and 11 March
2016 for SCI.
Case selection. Supplementary Figure 1 illustrates the derivation
of the patient populations for outcome and recurrence analyses.
We excluded patients found to have metastatic spread at the time
of resection (n ¼ 10), pNx status (n ¼ 3), and patients who died
within 30 days after surgery or during initial hospitalisation
(n ¼ 13).
Statistical analysis. Associations between LN parameters, DFS,
and OS were evaluated using multivariable-adjusted Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models calculating hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To build the multivariable-
adjusted model, we used a training set consisting of subjects who
received
treatment
at
DF/BWCC
(n ¼ 361).
We
identified
covariates for inclusion in the final model by performing stepwise
selection with Cox proportional hazards regression using ‘entry’
and ‘keep’ thresholds of Pp0.2 and Pp0.1, respectively. With

 these parameters, we fitted a model that included six covariates: age
at the time of surgery, sex, tumour grade (well/moderately
differentiated, poorly differentiated/undifferentiated, unknown),
perioperative systemic chemotherapy (yes, no), perioperative
radiation treatment (yes, no), and resection margin status (R0,
R1, R2, Rx). Proportionality of hazards assumption was satisfied by
evaluating a time-dependent variable of the cross-product of the
exposure of interest and time.
Using the above model, we compared the LN classification
parameters by measuring model discrimination and calibration in
the validation set, which consisted of subjects who received care at
the URMC and SCI (n ¼ 239). We evaluated model discrimination
for each LN parameter using the overall C index – an extension of
the area under a receiver-operator curve to survival analysis – and
calculated its 95% CI (Pencina and D’Agostino, 2004). Model
calibration for each LN parameter was assessed using the
Greenwood–Nam–D’Agostino
goodness-of-fit
test,
where
Po0.05 indicates model miscalibration (Demler et al, 2015).
As neoadjuvant treatment may affect LN status and the number
of examined LN, we conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to
patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy in the training
set. We also performed stratified analyses by resection margin
status (R0 or R1) and type of pancreatectomy (pancreaticoduode-
nectomy or distal resection). Interaction was assessed by including
the cross-product term of the exposure and stratification variable
in the regression model. Given that sample sizes were reduced in
stratified analyses and similar associations were identified in the
training and validation sets, these analyses were conducted in the
entire study population (i.e., training and validation sets combined)
and were further adjusted for the institution where patients
received care (DF/BWCC, URMC, or SCI). Survival was also
shown and assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank tests
in the entire study population.
Associations between LN parameters and pattern of first
recurrence were analysed with logistic regression calculating odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% CI in the entire study population. Logistic
regression models included the same covariates as in the Cox
models described above. We also performed stratified analyses by
receipt of perioperative radiation treatment.
We conducted linear trend tests across categories of exposure
variables by assigning each subject the median value for the
exposure category and modelling it as a continuous variable in Cox
or logistic regressions. As we evaluated four LN classification
parameters in our main analyses, statistical significance was
adjusted for multiple comparisons and set at Po0.013. All
hypothesis tests were two sided and analyses were performed
using the SAS Software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the 600 patients in the initial study
population are shown in Table 1. At the end of follow-up, 173
(30.4%)
patients
were
alive
and
108
(19.4%)
were
alive
without recurrent disease. Median follow-up time among patients
who were alive at the end of follow-up was 26.4 months. In our
study population, median DFS and OS were 14.3 and 22.5
months, respectively, and 5-year DFS and OS were 14.1% and
15.4%, respectively, comparable to recent randomised trials of
pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant therapy (Supplementary
Table 2) (Oettle et al, 2007, 2013; Regine et al, 2008, 2011;
Neoptolemos et al, 2010, 2017). As noted in other contemporary
patient populations with resected PDAC (Oettle et al, 2007;
Neoptolemos et al, 2010), nearly two in three patients had LN
metastases.
We first examined the association of LN parameters with DFS
and OS in the training set (Table 2) and found that higher
categories of LN involvement were significantly associated with
worse outcomes. We next evaluated the LN parameters’ prognostic
performance in the validation set, noting similar associations to
those identified in the training set (Table 3). Lymph node
involvement as classified by the 7th and 8th editions of the AJCC
system was significantly associated with poor outcomes. Lymph
node ratio and LODDS were associated with a stepwise increase in
the hazards for recurrence (Ptrend ¼ 0.004 and 0.005, respectively).
The overall C index was similar for the four LN parameters,
indicating good discrimination without demonstrating superiority
of one parameter over the others. Likewise, the Greenwood–Nam–
D’Agostino goodness-of-fit test indicated adequate calibration for
all LN parameters (all P40.60). Kaplan–Meier survival curves of
DFS and OS for each LN parameter in the entire study population
are presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2. Associa-
tions were largely unchanged after excluding the 14% of patients
who
received
neoadjuvant
therapy
from
the
training
set
(Supplementary Table 3).
A recent validation study of AJCC (8th edition) classification
was restricted to patients with R0 resections (Allen et al, 2017).
Therefore, we assessed whether the relationship of LN parameters
with survival differed by resection margin status (Table 4). We
found that associations of AJCC (7th edition) and AJCC (8th
edition) pN status with DFS were seen primarily in patients who
underwent R0 resections, with less prognostic ability in patients
with R1 margins (Pinteractiono0.02).
Given
that
anatomical
differences
influence
surgical
LN
dissection, we also evaluated whether the association between LN
parameters and survival differed by resection type. Lymph node
metastases classified by AJCC (7th edition) and AJCC (8th edition)
were significantly associated with disease recurrence and mortality
among patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, but not
among patients who underwent
distal resection (Table 4).
Pancreaticoduodenectomy
specimens
had
higher
number
of
examined (median, 16 LN vs 12.5 LN, Po0.01) and positive LN
(median, 2 LN vs 0 LN, Po0.01) compared with distal resections.
We next assessed the number of examined LN and presence of
LVI as markers of disease recurrence and survival (Supplementary
Table 4). Fewer than 12 LN examined was not associated with DFS
or OS among LN-negative or -positive patients. In contrast, the
presence of LVI revealed a trend towards poor DFS in patients with
LN-negative (HR 1.50; 95% CI: 0.90–2.51) and LN-positive (HR
1.27; 95% CI: 0.96–1.67) disease (Pinteraction ¼ 0.783).
Recent ASCO clinical practice guidelines recommend con-
sideration of adjuvant chemoradiation for patients with R1
resections and/or LN-positive tumours (Khorana et al, 2016).
Since the primary aim of chemoradiation is achieving local
control, we assessed whether LN involvement predicts local
recurrence (Table 5). In our study population, AJCC (7th edition)
and AJCC (8th edition) LN status did not predict local recurrence
as first site of failure. Nevertheless, 41.8% of patients received
perioperative radiotherapy that could influence their patterns of
disease recurrence. Therefore, we conducted stratified analyses
based on receipt of perioperative
radiation (Supplementary
Table 5). Although somewhat limited by sample size, LN
metastases were not predictive for local disease as first site of
recurrence even among patients who received no perioperative
radiation.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we found that LN categorisation by AJCC
(7th edition), AJCC (8th edition), LNR, and LODDS all predicted

 DFS and OS in patients undergoing resection for PDAC. The
AJCC (8th edition) provided good model fit, while minimising
model
complexity
compared
with
LNR
and
LODDS.
The
prognostic value of LN metastases was stronger in patients with
R0 resections and those who underwent pancreaticoduodenect-
omy, with weaker prognostic ability in patients with microscopi-
cally positive or close margins (R1) or patients with distal
resections. Lymph node metastases did not predict local disease
recurrence as first site of failure, even among patients who received
no perioperative radiation. The presence of LVI was marginally
associated with adverse outcomes in patients with both LN-
negative and -positive tumours, while the number of LN examined
was not prognostic in either group. These findings are relevant to
prognostication for patients, while suggesting that positive LN
status may not be useful in selecting patients for adjuvant
radiotherapy.

Lymph node status in resected pancreas cancer

 Recent studies have suggested that the number of positive LN
may improve prognostication over the binary designation of
negative vs positive LN involvement (Murakami et al, 2007;
Basturk et al, 2015; Malleo et al, 2015; Strobel et al, 2015).
Consequently, the new AJCC (8th edition) staging of pancreatic
cancer will distinguish patients with 1–3 metastatic LN from those
with X4 metastatic LN (Allen et al, 2017). In this study, we
confirmed the additional prognostic benefit to this approach, with
median OS times of 35.1, 20.6, and 16.8 months in the entire study
population for patients with N0, N1, and N2 disease, respectively.
Importantly for clinicians, the value of either AJCC nodal
classification in predicting patient outcomes was stronger among
patients with margin-negative resections and those with proximal
tumours undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The prognostic

Lymph node status in resected pancreas cancer

 role of LN metastases in patients undergoing distal pancreatic
resections for PDAC is not well characterised (Basturk et al, 2015;
Malleo et al, 2015; Strobel et al, 2015). Our findings highlight the
need to evaluate the prognostic role of LN involvement in surgical
series with distal resections and margin-positive resections and
should be interpreted cautiously, given the potential for diminished
statistical power in stratified analyses.
We examined two other LN classification approaches, LNR and
LODDS, which incorporate the total number of LN examined.
Single-centre and population-based studies have found that LNR is
a significant predictor of survival in resected PDAC (Slidell et al,
2008; Valsangkar et al, 2013). In our data, we saw little evidence for
improved prognostication using LNR compared with AJCC (8th
edition); this may partly be due to a relatively high number of LN
harvested in our patient population. However, it has been unclear
whether the prognostic value of LNR is due to accounting for
misclassification, where fewer LN examined by the pathologist
leads to lower likelihood of finding involved LN and an
inappropriate pN stage, or better surgical technique, where more
LN are harvested leading to fewer involved LN remaining in the
patient.
The LODDS classification has also been recently evaluated in
PDAC (National Comprehensive Cancer Network; Riediger et al,
2016). A proposed advantage of this parameter is that it assigns a
value to LN-negative patients based on the number of examined
LN. Therefore, it is designed to risk stratify patients with both LN-
negative and -positive tumours. In the current study, no advantage
to this classification approach was evident when divided into four
exposure groups by quartiles. Overall, our data suggest that the
AJCC (8th edition) classification adds value to prognostication
while only modestly increasing complexity for practicing clinicians.
We observed that the presence of LVI was associated with a
trend towards poor recurrence and survival outcomes in both LN-
negative and -positive cases. As LVI has been associated with
higher risk of disease recurrence and mortality (Takahashi et al,
2012), these results suggest that LVI may be considered regardless
of LN status.
Recent ASCO clinical practice guidelines for potentially curable
pancreatic cancer recommended adjuvant chemoradiation for
patients with R1 resections or LN-positive disease (Khorana
et al, 2016). The primary aim of adjuvant radiation therapy is to
prevent local recurrence around the pancreatic resection bed,
ultimately aiming for reduced local symptoms and improved
survival. However, studies have been inconclusive regarding the
benefits of adjuvant radiation (Neoptolemos et al, 2004; Regine
et al, 2011), leaving clinicians and patients with a difficult choice
regarding inclusion of chemoradiation in adjuvant treatment
programmes. In our patient population, we found no evidence

 that nodal metastases increased the risk for local disease as first site
of recurrence. Although our sample sizes were reduced when
stratified by treatment, this finding was consistent in patients who
received perioperative radiation and those who did not. Therefore,
data from our population would not support selecting patients for
adjuvant chemoradiation based on nodal status, if the primary
objective is to reduce local recurrence rates. The ongoing RTOG
0848 study will provide valuable information regarding the benefits
of adjuvant chemoradiation.
The current study has several important strengths. Our patient
population was derived from three US academic institutions in
distinct geographic regions, as well as 35 other academic and
community centres across the country. Patients were sequentially
captured and selected based only on having undergone surgical
resection. Thus, the study population represents a diversity of
patient characteristics, surgical and pathological practices, and
treatment approaches. Moreover, we had direct access to medical
records and follow-up information, allowing for consistent and
detailed data abstraction, including patterns of disease recurrence.
These data also allowed for appropriate adjustment for confound-
ing covariates in multivariate models and stratified analyses by
other important characteristics, such as resection margin status.
Last, we used training and validation sets to evaluate the
performance of the different LN classification parameters and
compared them with model discrimination and calibration metrics.
Study limitations also deserve mention. We included patients
who received neoadjuvant therapy in our main analyses, and LN
status may have been affected by preoperative treatment. However,
sensitivity analyses confirmed highly similar results after excluding
patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. The study period was
not uniform across the contributing centres. However, adjuvant
therapy programmes have not changed significantly during the
follow-up time of the study, with most patients receiving adjuvant
5-fluorouracil or adjuvant gemcitabine. Notably, the ESPAC-3
study demonstrated that patient outcomes are nearly identical with
5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine delivered after surgical resection
(Neoptolemos et al, 2010). We did not centrally rereview
pathological specimens for resection margins and LVI, and
therefore, our findings represent the information that is available
for practicing clinicians in the real-world setting. Additional
studies to compare LVI and resection margins across centres and
pathologists would be of interest. Finally, follow-up of patients
after surgical resection was performed as per standard institutional
practice. If postoperative imaging was performed more frequently

 for patients with LN-positive disease, then this could accentuate
differences in DFS time between the LN-positive and -negative
groups. Nevertheless, no standard follow-up programme has been
defined to improve outcomes in patients with resected PDAC, and
imaging intervals would not be expected to alter overall survival
times, which were markedly different between the LN-positive and
-negative groups.
In conclusion, we confirmed the prognostic importance of
regional LN metastases after resection for PDAC in a large, multi-
institutional database including patients from across the United
States. In this patient population, the upcoming AJCC (8th edition)
staging system is an effective and practical classification of regional
LN involvement that incorporates the number of metastatic LN as
a prognostic factor in the prediction of disease recurrence and
survival. Nevertheless, its prognostic value may be weaker in
patients with positive resection margins and in patients with distal
resections. Notably, outcomes for patients with LN-positive disease
were extremely poor. Novel approaches to treatment of this disease
are
greatly
needed,
including
consideration
to
preoperative
treatment, multiagent chemotherapy programmes, and therapeutic
approaches based on an improved biologic understanding of this
highly lethal malignancy (Perez et al, 2016; Ying et al, 2016;
Neoptolemos et al, 2017).
