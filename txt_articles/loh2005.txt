This study prospectively evaluated perpetrator risk factors for sexual assault perpe-
tration, including peer influences, beliefs and attitudes about sexuality, alcohol use,
and token resistance. Perpetration of sexual assault was evaluated at three time peri-
ods: pretest, 3-month follow-up, and 7-month follow-up. Retrospective and prospec-
tive analyses yielded differential predictors of sexually aggressive behavior. How-
ever, perpetration of sexual assault at any particular assessment period was a
predictor of perpetration during the subsequent follow-up period. Furthermore, sev-
eral variables that have previously been demonstrated in the literature to be related
to the perpetration of sexual assault were not significant in regression analyses, indi-
cating that these variables may be rendered insignificant when accounting for past
perpetration in prospective analyses. These findings may have significant potential
impact on development of sexual assault prevention programming with men.

During the past two decades, research has consistently demonstrated the
alarming prevalence of acquaintance rape and other coerced sexual activity
on college campuses. Studies on the frequency of sexual assault have found
that the majority of college women have experienced some form of sexual
victimization, most often involving unwanted touching (Fisher, Cullen, &
Turner, 2000; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987; Muehlenhard & Linton,
1987). Almost 18 years ago, Koss and her colleagues (1987) estimated that

 approximately one fourth of college women are victims of attempted rape or
rape. The lifetimeprevalence of rape was found to be 20% for college women
(Brener, McMahon, Warren, & Douglas, 1999). Similarly, it has also been
estimated that one fourth of college men have engaged in some form of sexu-
ally coercive behavior from unwanted touching to rape, with approximately
8% reporting actions consistent with rape or attempted rape (Abbey,
McAuslan, & Ross, 1998; Koss et al., 1987).
Identification of variables that influence likelihood of sexual assault is
fundamental for prevention efforts. Research regarding risk factors for sex-
ual assault has largely focused on three general areas: characteristics of the
victim, characteristics of the perpetrator, and situational characteristics (for a
review, see Gidycz, Loh, & Lobo, in press). Although much of the research in
sexual assault has focused on the characteristics of victims that increase the
likelihood of an assault, it is likely that the most effective way to reduce sex-
ual assault is to focus on perpetrator characteristics that increase the likeli-
hood of perpetration. Specifically, these characteristics include differences
in socialization experiences, beliefs and attitudes about sexuality, personal-
ity, and alcohol use that have been empirically determined or hypothesized to
differentiate men who are sexually aggressive from their counterparts who
are sexually nonaggressive.
Individual perpetrator characteristics and rape supportive attitudes and
beliefs are widely considered to be a product of a general cultural context that
objectifies women and condones the use of force by men to obtain goals,
including sexual conquest (Berkowitz, 1992; Burt, 1980; Kanin, 1985).
More attention has been cast on the role of peer relationships and perceived
peer norms on sexually aggressive behavior. According to social norms the-
ory, individuals behave in a manner that they deem to be consistent with a
norm of behavior (Berkowitz, 2003). Men who believe their friends or rele-
vant peer groups are using coercive behavior to obtain sex are theorized to be
more likely to engage in similar behaviors. Therefore, men who belong to
groups that advocate male dominance may be more comfortable committing
acts of sexual aggression than men without peer support for such behavior
(Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, & Tanaka, 1991). For example, fraternities
have often been accused of fostering rape supportive attitudes by promoting
male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation has been found to
be a significant predictor of sexually aggressive behavior in retrospective
analyses (Lackie & de Man, 1997). Furthermore, perceived peer approval of
forced sex is also greater for perpetrators of sexual assault than nonperpe-
trators (Abbey, McAuslan, Zawacki, Clinton, & Buck, 2001).
Rape supportive attitudes and beliefs are believed to define situations in
which sexually aggressive behavior is considered justifiable (Berkowitz,
1326

 1992). For example, women wearing sexy clothes are seen by men and
women as being more vulnerable to victimizationand so-called more respon-
sible for sexual crimes committed against them, compared to women who
dress more conservatively (Edmonds & Cahoon, 1986). It has been sug-
gested that deeply ingrained rape supportive beliefs manifest through soci-
etal norms dictating appropriate behavior for women, providing occasions of
so-called justifiable rape (Burt, 1980). Moreover, these rape supportive atti-
tudes and beliefs are correlated with sexual assault perpetration. Overall, the
literature reveals that men who hold adversarial views about relationships
between men and women, condone violence against women, accept stereo-
typical rape myths, or hold traditional attitudes about sex roles are more tol-
erant of rape and more likely to perpetrate sexual aggression than men who
do not share these beliefs (Abbey et al., 2001; Burt, 1980; Koss, Leonard,
Beezley, & Oros, 1985; Lackie & de Man, 1997; Malamuth et al., 1991;
Muehlenhard & Linton, 1987; Rapaport & Burkhart, 1984). Perpetrator per-
sonality may play a role in determining which individuals act in accordance
with their rape supportive attitudes and beliefs (Berkowitz, 1992). When
compared to nonperpetrators, perpetrators of sexual assault have been found
to exhibit less understanding of the rules of social order, less acceptance of
personal responsibility, less internalization of prosocial beliefs, more imma-
turity, and more irresponsibility (Kosson, Kelly, & White, 1997; Rapaport &
Burkhart, 1984).
Research has consistently determined alcohol to be a major risk factor in
sexual assault (Abbey et al., 1998; Koss et al., 1987; Norris, Nurius, & Gra-
ham, 1999). In fact, preassault alcohol use by victims and perpetrators has
been associated with more severe sexual victimization (Ullman, Karabatsos,
& Koss, 1999). Abbey and her colleagues (1998) proposed thatsexual assault
perpetration may be influenced by alcohol expectancies; such that men who
believe alcohol enhances sexuality may drink alcohol when they want to feel
or be sexual. Alternatively, the effects of alcohol may also be associated with
decreased sensitivity to social cues, allowing for misperceptions of sexual
intent (Abbey et al., 1998; Muehlenhard & Linton, 1987). These mis-
perceptions may permit perpetrators of sexual assault to disregard refusals
for sexual activity, possibly dismissing them as token refusals (Krahe, 1999).
Token resistance has been defined as an individual refusing sexual contact
when she or he has intentions of engaging in sexual contact (i.e., saying no
when you mean yes; Muehlenhard & Hollabaugh, 1988). Muehlenhard and
Hollabaugh (1988) found that in a sample of college women, 40% reported
engaging in token resistance. Women who reported using token resistance
were more likely to endorse traditional sex-role stereotyping and accept
interpersonal violence to a greater degree than women who did not report

 using token resistance. Krahe (1999), in a sample of late adolescents, found
that 44% of men indicated that they perceived token resistance from a sexual
partner in the past. Furthermore, men who report perceiving token resistance
from a sexual partner, compared to men who do not, have also been found to
have longer reaction times in response to a rape scenario, indicating that the
man in the scenario should stop his sexual advances (Marx & Gross, 1995).
In addition, longer reaction times were also significantly related to a greater
degree of acceptance of rape myths (Marx & Gross, 1995).
Much of the research involving attributes of men who are sexually aggres-
sive have examined variables in isolation, although some previous investiga-
tions have examined some of these risk factors concurrently. For example,
investigations of multifactorial models of sexual assault perpetration have
found evidence for promiscuity and hostility (Malamuth, Linz, Heavey,
Barnes, & Acker, 1995; Malamuth et al., 1991), and adherence to rape myths,
alcohol use, and misperception of sexual cues (Abbey et al., 1998; Abbey
et al., 2001). However, the majority of studies examining more than one
attribute of men who are sexually aggressive have been conducted retrospec-
tively, making it difficult to account for the effects of recall biases in partici-
pants. Of note, there have been two longitudinal studies examining sexual
assault perpetration in college men. White and Smith (2004) conducted a 5-
year longitudinal evaluation of college men and found that childhood victim-
ization was associated with increased likelihood of perpetration of sexual
assault in adolescence, which in turn was associated with increased likeli-
hood of perpetrating sexually aggressive acts in college. However, when
these variables were considered collectively, only adolescent sexual perpe-
tration was predictive of perpetration during college. Although early victim-
ization and perpetration over time were assessed, other variables, such as
rape supportive beliefs, were not. Malamuth and his colleagues (1995) con-
ducted a 10-year longitudinal study to examine the confluence model of sex-
ual aggression, including early risk factors, rape supportive beliefs, and pro-
miscuity. The results indicated that sexually aggressive behavior at baseline
predicted conflict with women at follow-up, which included sexual and
nonsexual aggression, and relationship distress.
The primary purpose of the current study was to assess the relative predic-
tive value of perpetrator characteristics that contribute to the perpetration of
sexual assault, including the impact of perceived peer attitudes and beliefs.
The current study utilized a prospective and longitudinal design to assess the
relationships between these factors and sexual assault. At baseline assess-
ment, participants responded to questions regarding their attitudes and
beliefs about sexuality, alcohol use, personality characteristics, token resis-

 tance, and history of sexually aggressive behavior. Sexual perpetration was
then assessed at two follow-up periods, 3 months and 7 months after pretest,
which allowed for prospective analysis of risk factors for sexual perpetration.
The current study was exploratory and intended to identify the most salient
and robust predictors of sexual aggression. Secondary analyses were also
conducted to examine the relationships between perceived peer normative
rape supportive attitudes and beliefs and personal attitudes and beliefs. It was
hypothesized that perpetrators of sexual assault would perceive more support
for inappropriate attitudes and behaviors from their peers than nonperpe-
trators of sexual assault.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were 325 undergraduate men in the control group of a sexual
assault prevention program study at a large midwestern university (Lobo
et al., 2002). The vast majority of participants were heterosexual (96.6%),
White (91.7%), more than one half were enrolled in their first year of college
(64.3%), and between age 18 and 19 years (71.1%).
Attrition. Attrition rates were acceptable during the course of the study.
Seventy-eight percent (n = 253) of men who participated in the pretest
returned for the 3-month follow-up, and 72% (n = 234) returned for the 7-
month follow-up. Overall, 66% (n = 215) attended all three assessment peri-
ods. Men who withdrew from the current study during the 3-month follow-up
period were not significantly different from those who participated during
that interim period in terms of history of perpetration, χ2(2, N = 324) = 1.41,
p > .05; however, men who reported engaging in sexually aggressive behav-
iors that met the legal definition of rape prior to entering the study were more
likely to withdraw from the study during the 7-month follow-up period than
men without a history of perpetration or those with a moderate history of per-
petration, χ2(2, N = 324) = 6.91, p < .05. Specifically, more than one half
(58.3%) of men with a history of perpetrating rape did not return for the 7-
month follow-up period compared to 28.3% of men who did not have a his-
tory of perpetrating rape. Finally, men who withdrew from the current study
during the 7-month follow-up period were not significantly different from
those who participated during that interim period in terms of perpetration
during the 3-month follow-up period, χ2(2, N = 253) = 2.00, p > .05. There

 were no significant differences in attrition rates for any of the dependent
variables.
Measures
Attitudes and beliefs. The 19-item short form of the Hypergender Ideol-
ogy Scale (HGIS; Hamburger, Hogben, McGowan, & Dawson, 1996)
assesses extreme, stereotypical gender roles. Higher scores indicate a greater
degree of adherence to traditional gender-role ideology. The HGIS demon-
strates good reliability, and good concurrent validity when compared to the
Hypermasculinity Inventory, and Hyperfemininity Inventory (Hamburger
et al., 1996) Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was .91.
The Adversarial Heterosexual Beliefs Scale (AHBS; Lonsway & Fitzger-
ald, 1995) measures the degree to which respondents feel that the fundamen-
tal relationships between the sexes are adversarial in nature. Higher scores
indicate a greater degree of belief in the idea that relationships between
the sexes are adversarial. The AHBS has adequate reliability (Cronbach’s
alpha = .78) and demonstrates good concurrent validity with other measures
of adversarial sexual beliefs, such as the Adversarial Sexual Beliefs Scale
and Acceptance of Interpersonal Violence Scale (Lonsway & Fitzgerald,
1995) Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was .99.
The Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA; Payne, Lonsway, &
Fitzgerald, 1999) is a 20-item questionnaire developed to assess general
rape-myth acceptance. Higher scores indicate greater rape-myth acceptance.
Reliability and concurrent validity coefficients with the Sex Role Stereotyp-
ing Scale (Burt, 1980), Hostility Towards Women Scale (Burt, 1980), and
Acceptance of Interpersonal Violence Scale (Burt, 1980) are good (Payne
et al., 1999). Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was .62.
Social norms and/or peer influences. The Reactions to Offensive Lan-
guage and Behavior Scale (ROLB) is a 26-item self-report scale, adapted
from questions used by Kilmartin and his colleagues (1999), which mea-
sured men’s degree of discomfort with and willingness to confront the inap-
propriate behavior of other men, and their perceptions of other men’s dis-
comfort with and willingness to confront these behaviors (Kilmartin,
Conway, Friedberg, McQuoid, & Tschan, 1999) This questionnaire was
developed by the investigators to measure men’s perceptions of social norms.
Participants indicated their behavioral response and their comfort level to sit-
uations depicting degrading attitudes and comments toward women, as
themselves and how they feel the so-called average college man would
respond. The measure produces two domains (behavior and comfort) for two

 targets (self and other) yielding four subscales: self-behavior, self-comfort,
other-behavior, and other-comfort. Responses range from 1 (always) to 7
(never) for the behavioral subscale (e.g., When I hear a sexist comment I indi-
cate my displeasure), and 1 (very comfortable) to 7 (very uncomfortable) for
the comfort subscale (e.g., You walk into your room and your roommates are
watching porn). Lower scores on the behavioral subscale N indicated a
greater propensity to engage in behavior to intervene in situations where
women are being objectified, assaulted, or verbally degraded. Higher scores
on the comfort subscale indicated a greater degree of comfort in situations
where women are being objectified, assaulted, or verbally degraded. Reli-
ability coefficients were good for the ROLB. Internal consistency reliability,
assessed using the data from the current analysis, was high on all scales as
measured by Cronbach’s alphas: self-behavior (.79 to .99), self-comfort (.90
to .99), other-behavior (.90 to .99), and other-comfort (.98 to .99).
Participants also responded to the IRMA (Payne et al., 1999) as they
believed the average college man would respond, yielding a measure of per-
ceptions of rape-myth acceptance in peers.
Fraternity affiliation was assessed at baseline. Participants responded
either yes or no to the following question, “Are you a member of a social fra-
ternity?” Approximately one fourth (24%) identified themselves as belong-
ing to a fraternity at baseline.
Personality. The Socialization Scale of the California Personality Inven-
tory (CPI; Gough, 1987) assesses the degree of internalization of prosocial
values and beliefs. Higher scores indicate less sociability. The scale was con-
structed empirically and demonstrates good reliability and validity (Gough,
1987). Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was .81.
Alcohol use. The Drinking Habits Questionnaire (Cahalan, Cisin, &
Crossley, 1969) is a 13-item measure that assesses the type, amount, and fre-
quency of alcohol consumption. Participants were asked to estimate their
consumption of beer, liquor, and wine during a specified time period and the
amount they drank during a typical episode. From this information, a cross-
classification dimension of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption,
or volume-variability index (VV; Cahalan et al., 1969) was calculated for
each participant. Participants were classified as being non (VV = 1 to 2), light
(VV = 3 to 5), moderate (VV = 6 to 8), or heavy drinkers (VV = 9 to 11). For
example, heavy drinkers imbibe a minimum of 45 alcoholic drinks (beer,
wine, or hard liquor) per month, while light drinkers drink a maximum of
17.5 drinks, and moderate drinkers drink between 17.6 and 44.9 drinks per
month. In the current sample, almost two thirds (63.9%) were heavy drink-

 ers, 16.9% were moderate drinkers, 6.5% were light drinkers, and the
remaining 12.7% were nondrinkers. Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample
was .73.
Token resistance. Use of token resistance by participants and perceived
token resistance from partners was assessed. The token resistance question
was adapted from Marx and Gross (1995), “Have you ever been in a situation
where the person you were with wanted to have sexual contact with you, but
you said ‘no’ even though you had every intention to and were willing to
engage in sex with them?” The perceived token resistance question was
adapted from Muehlenhard and Hollabaugh (1988), “Have you ever had a
single sexual encounter in which the person you were with, at first, told or
demonstrated to you that they did not want to go any further, but then did pro-
ceed to engage in further sexual activity?” In the current sample, 40% of
respondents acknowledged their own use of token resistance, and one third
(33.1%) had perceived token resistance from a partner in the past.
Sexual aggression. The Sexual Experiences Survey (SES; Koss & Oros,
1982) was designed to identify the perpetrators of sexual assault through a
series of 10 sexually explicit questions, in which the respondent assesses his
past sexual behavior along a variety of behavioral dimensions since age 14
years. The SES was found to have good internal consistency reliability as
measured by a Cronbach alpha of .89 for men, and validity for SES has been
established by comparing men’s responses to the SES with those given to an
interviewer, yielding a reliability coefficient of .61. (Koss & Gidycz, 1985)
Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was .63. The SES was administered
at baseline and both follow-up periods. At each follow-up, only sexually
aggressive experiences during the interim period between assessments was
measured. The SES was used to classify individuals into categories reflecting
the level of their use of coercion or force. Participants were classified into one
of three levels of perpetration, according to the most severe type of assault
behavior they endorsed. The three levels of sexual assault, in order from least
to most severe, were defined as follows: individuals who reported that they
did not engage in sexually aggressive acts were labeled none; those who
engaged in unwanted sexual contact, sexual coercion, or attempted rape were
grouped into a category labeled moderate; and those who engaged in behav-
iors that met the legal definition of rape were labeled severe.

 Procedure
All assessment sessions were conducted with groups no larger than 20,
and given that participants may have been disclosing behavior that is poten-
tially criminal, measures were taken to protect their identities. Participants
were enrolled in psychology courses and had the choice of volunteering to
participate in psychology experiments or writing a brief summary of a jour-
nal article in exchange for credit applied toward course grades. Students vol-
unteered for participation through sign-up sheets posted on a sign-up board
in the Department of Psychology building. Initial recruitment was conducted
from fall 2000 through spring 2001. Each participant derived a unique num-
ber based on his social security number, birthdates, and mother’s first name.
Therefore, there were no means of connecting participants with individual
responses. All measures were self-report assessments. At baseline, partici-
pants responded to all assessment instruments. At each follow-up session,
participants completed the Sexual Experiences Scale, with respect to their
sexually aggressive activity during the interim period between assessments.
Telephone calls and e-mail messages were used to remind participants of
their follow-up assessment appointments. Participants received experimen-
tal credit or US $20 for their participation at each assessment session.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Sexual Aggression
Approximately one third (31.2%) of participants reported engaging in
sexually aggressive acts after age 14 years and prior to entering the study,
with 27.5% of the total sample reporting perpetrating a moderate act of sex-
ual aggression and 3.7% reporting a severe sexual perpetration after age 14
years and prior to entering the study. During the 3-month follow-up, 17.4%
of participants engaged in sexually aggressive behavior, with 13.8% of the
sample reporting moderate sexual aggression and 3.6% reporting severe sex-
ual aggression during the interim period. During the 7-month follow-up,
12.4% of participants engaged in sexually aggressive behavior, with 10.7%
of participants reporting moderate sexually aggressive experiences and 1.7%
reporting severe sexually aggressive experiences during the interim period.

 Retrospective Analyses
Significant relationships between predictors. Correlational analyses indi-
cated that the HGIS, AHBS, and IRMA-self were all significantly positively
correlated (see Table 1), indicating that men who adhere to traditional
gender-role ideology are also more likely to believe that the nature of rela-
tionships between the sexes is adversarial and more likely to be accepting of
rape myths. The HGIS was also significantly related to fraternity member-
ship, alcohol use at baseline, use of token resistance, and the ROLB (self-
comfort), implying that men who adhere to traditional gender-role ideology
were more likely to be in fraternities, use alcohol to a greater degree, use
token resistance with sexual partners, and feel more comfortable in situations
where women are being mistreated. Greater ease and comfort in situations
where women are being mistreated was also positively correlated with alco-
hol use and fraternity affiliation.
Perceived token resistance was significantly related to use of token resis-
tance, suggesting that men who use token resistance have also perceived
more token resistance from past sexual partners. It is interesting to note,
higher scores on the Socialization Scale of the CPI were related to less per-
ceived token resistance, and fewer adversarial heterosexual beliefs, indicat-
ing that less socialized men were less likely to perceive token resistance from
apartner in the past and had fewer adversarialbeliefsregarding relationships.
Assessment of personal versus perceived normative beliefs. Paired sample
t tests were used to assess differences between perceived norms and personal
responses on the IRMA, ROLB-behavior and ROLB-comfort scales. Com-
pared to themselves, participants believed that the average college man dem-
onstrated more rape-myth acceptance, t(277) = –12.84, p < .001, was less
likely to intervene in situations where a woman was being mistreated,
t(288) = –9.52, p < .001, and was more comfortable in situations where
women are being mistreated, t(288) = –6.45, p < .001. Moreover, perpetra-
tion history was not related to differences between perceived norms and per-
sonal responses on the IRMA, F(276) = .58, p > .05, ROLB-behavior,
F(276) = –.02, p > .05, or ROLB-comfort, F(276) = .59, p > .05.
Prediction of perpetration history. Logistic regression, using a forward
stepwise likelihood ratio model, was performed to investigate the retrospec-
tive relationship between history of perpetration and the predictor variables.
For the purposes of these analyses, perpetration was treated as a binary
dependent variable. All participants who reported committing an act of sex-

 ual aggression were grouped into one category (assault) and those who did
not report any act of sexual aggression during each period were grouped into
another category (no assault)
The following variables were included in the analysis as follows: frater-
nity membership status, IRMA (other), ROLB (other-behavior), and ROLB
(other-comfort) were entered to assess for peer influences, the HGIS, AHBS,
IRMA (self), ROLB (self-behavior), and ROLB (self-comfort) were entered
to assess for attitudes and beliefs, and the Socialization Scale of the CPI was
entered to assess for personality factors, the Drinking Habits Questionnaire
was used to assess for level of alcohol use, and the use of token resistance and
perceived token resistance.
Of the original 325 cases, 47 were deleted because of missing data yield-
ing a sample size of 278. A test of the full model with 13 variables against a
constant-only model was statistically reliable, χ2(2, N = 278) = 18.12, p <
.001. The final model consists of two variables, perceived token resistance
and hypergender ideology, which accounts for 8.9% of the variance (see
Table 2). Men who reported perceiving token resistance from a partner in the
past were almost 3 times more likely to have also perpetrated an act of sexual
aggression prior to entering the study (odds ratio [OR] = 2.90). Chi-square
analyses indicated that 48.3% of men with a history of sexual aggression
reported perceiving token resistance from a partner in the past, compared
with 24.6% of men without a history of sexual aggression, χ2(1, N = 278) =
15.39, p < .001. Although the HGIS entered the regression model, it was
not significant. Post hoc analysis indicated that the bivariate relationship
between history of perpetration and hypergender ideology was also not sig-
nificant, F(277) = 2.96, p > .05, suggesting that adherence to hypergender
ideology may not be a significant predictor of history of perpetration outside
the presence of perceived token resistance.

Perpetration during the 3-month follow-up. All the predictor variables
included in the first logistic regression were used, with the addition of history
of perpetration (none, moderate, or severe). Perpetration during the 3-month
follow-up was treated as a binary dependent variable (no assault vs. assault).
Data from participants who completed pretest and 3-month follow-up was
included. Of the 253 cases available, 33 were deleted because of missing data
yielding a sample size of 220. A test of the full model with 14 predictors
against a constant-only model was statistically reliable, χ2(4, N = 220) =
21.66, p < .001. The final model consists of three variables, history of perpe-
tration, fraternity membership status, and IRMA-other which account for
16.1% of the variance (see Table 3).
Men with a history of perpetrating acts who met the legal definition of
rape were more than 9 times more likely to perpetrate an act of sexual aggres-
sion during the 3-month follow-up period (OR = 9.63) than men without a
history of sexual aggression. Moreover, fraternity men were more than 3

 Men who reported perpetrating rape during the 3-month follow-up period
were approximately 15 times more likely to perpetrate an act of sexual
aggression during the 7-month follow-up (OR = 15.30) than men who did not
perpetrate during the 3-month follow-up period. Post hoc analyses indicated
that the bivariate relationship between perpetration of sexually aggressive
acts during the 7-month follow-up period and adversarial heterosexual
beliefs was significant F(183) = 6.40, p < .05, indicating that men perpetrated
acts of sexual aggression during the 7-month follow-up period were more
likely to endorse feelings that relationships between men and women are
adversarial in nature at baseline. However, greater ease or comfort in situations
where women are being demeaned or mistreated was not an independent pre-
dictor, despite entering the regression model. Post hoc analyses indicate that
the bivariate relationship between ROLB-self-comfort and perpetration dur-
ing the 7-month follow-up period was not significant,F(183) =.76, p >.05.
DISCUSSION
The majority of previous research on risk factors for sexual perpetration
has been conducted retrospectively and examined variables in isolation. The
current study was an exploratory investigation of the collective ability of
variables that have been demonstrated to be related to perpetration in retro-
spective analyses to prospectively predict sexually aggressive behavior.
Sexually aggressive behavior was assessed at baseline and during two
follow-up periods, at 3 months and 7 months. The proportion of participants
with a history of sexually aggressive behavior (31.2%) is comparable to other
studies, which have found that approximately 25% to 33% of college men
have engaged in some form of sexually coercive behavior since age 14 years
(Abbey et al., 1998; Abbey et al., 2001; Koss et al., 1987; Rapaport &
Burkhart, 1984). Compared to previous prospective studies, the number of
participants who perpetrated during the course of the 3-month follow-up
(17.4%) was substantially higher. Gidycz and her colleagues (1997) found
that approximately 8% of men in their sample reperpetrated during a period
of 9 weeks. The difference in rates is likely because of two methodological
differences between these studies. First, the extended follow-up time may
have allowed participants more opportunity to engage in sexually aggressive
acts. Second, participants for the current study were recruited throughout the
academic quarter, while the prior study recruited participants at the begin-
ning of the academic quarter (Gidycz et al., 1997). However, undergraduates
may participate at any time during the quarter to receive course credit. For
this reason, the men recruited for the prior study may have been more consci-

 entious than the average male undergraduate because they sought to com-
plete course requirements in the beginning of the academic quarter. Finally,
the percentage of participants who perpetrated acts of sexual aggression dur-
ing the 7-month follow-up period (12.4%) was somewhat lower than the per-
petration rates reported during the 3-month follow-up period. There was a
differential attrition rate during this follow-up period for men with a history
of perpetrating acts that are consistent with the legal definition of rape, such
that men with a rape history were less likely to return for the 7-month assess-
ment. Because more than one half (60%) of men with a history of rape perpe-
trated acts of sexual aggression during the subsequent time period, it is possi-
ble that this contributed to the decrease in perpetration rates during the 7-
month follow-up period.
In retrospective analyses, history of perpetration was related to two vari-
ables, perceived token resistance and hypergender ideology. Almost one half
(48.3%) of men with a history of sexually aggressive behavior reported that
they perceived use of token resistance from a partner in the past, which is
comparable to previous research findings, where approximately 44% of men
perceived token resistance from a partner in the past (Krahe, 1999). Men who
perceived token resistance from a partner in the past were almost 3 times
more likely to have a history of sexually aggressive behavior, compared to
men who did not perceive token resistance from a partner in the past. Consis-
tent with past findings (Krahe, 1999), use of token resistance was positively
correlated with perceived token resistance from a partner. There are several
possible explanations for these findings. First, men who are sexually aggres-
sive may discount refusals for sexual activity. It may be that men who are sex-
ually aggressive expect women to refuse sexual activity for reasons related to
social norms, such as not wanting to appear “easy.” In addition, this may also
be related how they view their own role in heterosexual relationships. Perpe-
trators may believe that their role consists of persuading women to engage in
sexual activity. Alternatively, it may be that men who are sexually aggressive
perceive the use of token resistance more than men who are sexually non-
aggressive, because of the fact that they continue to make sexual advances
after women have refused further sexual activity. Their past sexual partners
may have submitted following repeated advances, and as a result, men who
are sexually aggressive have had a greater number of experiences where they
perceived token resistance. Similarly, it is also possible that the partners of
men who are sexually aggressive do not concede but rather are forced into
further sexual activity. Consequently, men who are sexually aggressive are
able to justify their sexually aggressive behavior by labeling those experi-
ences as token resistance when, in fact, they are perpetrating sexually aggres-
sive acts. Finally, given the relationship between perceived token resistance
1342

Downloaded from 
 and use of token resistance, men who use token resistance may perceive
token resistance more often because they use the tactic themselves and have
an expectation that others act similarly. However, although these findings are
promising, more research is necessary to elucidate the impact of use of and
perceived token resistance on sexually aggressive behavior, as these vari-
ables were measured using a single question in the current study.
Although hypergender ideology was significant in the regression model,
it was not significantly related to history of perpetration in subsequent post
hoc analyses. Hypergender ideology was correlated with history of perpetra-
tion, such that men with a greater degree of adherence to traditional gender
roles were also more likely to have a history of sexually aggressive behavior.
However, the variables used to denote history of perpetration in the logistic
regression and correlational analyses were different with regards to the level
of detail. Specifically, in the logistic regression, a dichotomous variable was
used (assault vs. no assault), and in the correlational analysis, participants
were categorized into three groups, none, moderate, and severe. It is possible
that in collapsing these groups further, the relationship between hypergender
ideology and history of perpetration was rendered insignificant.
Prospectively, fraternity membership at baseline was a significant predic-
tor of perpetration during the 3-month follow-up period. Indeed, the current
findings are consistent with previous retrospective research that links frater-
nity affiliation and sexually aggressive behavior (Lackie & de Man, 1997).
Perceived rape-myth acceptance of peers also entered the predictive model
for perpetration during the 3-month follow-up period. Although it was not a
stable predictor, its presence in the model indicates that the level of perceived
acceptance of rape myths has some influence on perpetration within the con-
text of history of perpetration and fraternity membership. Berkowitz (2003)
proposed that men who believe their friends and relevant peer groups are
using coercive behavior to obtain sex are more likely to engage in similar
behaviors. Thus, fraternity men, within an environment that promotes stereo-
typical notions of masculinity, may be more likely to perpetrate acts of sexual
aggression (Kanin, 1985; Martin & Hummer, 1989). Indeed, fraternity affili-
ation was associated with a greater degree of adherence to traditional ideas
about gender roles. However, all participants believed that the average col-
lege man demonstrated more rape-myth acceptance and are less likely to
intervene and more comfortable in situations where women are being
demeaned or mistreated than themselves, regardless of perpetration history.
It is possible that this is a manifestation of self-enhancement bias, or the ten-
dency to describe oneself in more positive terms when compared to others
(Krueger, 1998; Kwan, John, Kenny, Bond, & Robins, 2004). However, an
alternative explanation is that there may be a universal understanding among

 college men that supports stereotypical ideas about their behavior and beliefs
regarding sexual relationships and women. In point of fact, Burt (1980) con-
tended that culturally transmitted assumptions about men, women, violence,
and sexuality establish rape supportive belief systems. Men who are non-
sexually aggressive who subscribe to the same norms as men who are sexu-
ally aggressive may be participating in the maintenance of a general social
environment that supports sexually aggressive behavior (Berkowitz, 2003).
These findings support the concept of a collective awareness regarding rape
supportive beliefs, including acceptable beliefs and attitudes of men with
regards to women.
With respect to attitudes about relationships, adherence to adversarial
beliefs about the nature of relationships between the sexes, measured at base-
line, was predictive of sexual aggression during the 7-month follow-up
period. Men who perpetrated acts of sexual aggression during the 7-month
follow-up period endorsed, at baseline, feeling that their relationships with
women are adversarial to a greater degree. Although retrospective studies
have demonstrated a relationship between adversarial sexual beliefs and per-
petration of sexual assault (Burt, 1980; Koss et al., 1985), the current findings
represent one of the few prospective studies that have established a link
between attitudes and subsequent sexual aggression.
Without doubt, rape perpetration emerged as the best predictor of sexual
aggression in subsequent time periods. Consistent with previous findings
from prospective studies (Gidycz et al., 1997; Loh, Gidycz, Marioni, Marx,
& Miranda, 1999; Malamuth et al., 1995; White & Smith, 2004), men with a
history of perpetrating rape were more likely to be sexually aggressive during
the 3-month follow-up period. Likewise, perpetration of rape during the 3-
month follow-up period was predictive of sexual aggression during the 7-
month follow-up period. However, as changes in the dependent variables
were not assessed over time, it is difficult to extrapolate whether perpetrating
sexual assault exerts influence on variables such as rape supportive beliefs
and fraternity membership.
It is interesting to note that several variables that have been demonstrated
in previous retrospective research to be related to sexual assault perpetration
were not prospectively or retrospectively related to a history of sexual assault
in the current sample. It is possible that the relationship between some factors
that have been found to be related to sexual assault in the literature in retro-
spective studies is nonexistent when examined prospectively, such that the
significance of the relationships between these variables and sexual assault
perpetration is an artifact related to retrospective methodology. In addition,
there may have been ceiling effects with some variables. For example, alco-
hol use was not found to be a significant predictor of sexual assault perpetra-
1344

Downloaded from 
 tion at any time period; however, the preponderance of previous research
indicates that alcohol use is a major contributing factor to sexual assault, in
college and community samples (Abbey et al., 1998; Koss et al., 1987;
Muehlenhard & Linton, 1987; Norris et al., 1999; Seifert, 1999). The major-
ity of participants in the current study were classified as heavy drinkers, and
differences in perpetration status may have been rendered insignificant
because of a lack of variability in alcohol use. However, with almost two
thirds of the sample reporting heavy drinking, these findings do illustrate the
considerable extent of alcohol use in college men.
As with other studies on sexual assault conducted with college popula-
tions, the generalizability of the current study is limited. The differential
attrition rates during the 7-month follow-up, and the time-limited nature also
present difficulties when discussing the generalizability of results. However,
the majority of the research on acquaintance rape is conducted with college
populations, as individuals in this age group are at considerably greater risk
for victimization and perpetration (Koss et al., 1987). The current study also
represents one of the few prospective analyses of sexual perpetration with a
large sample size and employs a longer follow-up period than previous pro-
spective studies. Moreover, it assessed a number of variables defined strin-
gently and employed the use of measures that demonstrate good reliability
and validity.
These findings may have significant potential impact on sexual assault
prevention programming with men. First, fraternities may be one of the most
salient campus organizations to target for sexual assault prevention pro-
grams. Although it is important to target the general college populations for
sexual assault programming, fraternities may be the most cost-effective
means of reducing the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses.
Moreover, men with a history of perpetrating acts that are consistent with the
legal definition of rape are more likely to perpetrate another act of sexual
aggression than men who do not have similar histories. It may be that these
groups require specialized prevention programming. Furthermore, inclusion
of material about token resistance in sexual assault prevention programming
with men is important. Ideas about token resistance may be integral in some
instances of sexual assault. Inclusion of what constitutes refusal for sexual
activity may be essential in preventing sexual assault perpetration in men. An
evaluation study involving a sexual assault prevention program for men that
assesses the influence of these variables in prevention programming has
recently been completed (Lobo et al., 2002). Given the preponderance of
research that demonstrates the associations between sexual assault perpetra-
tion and rape supportive attitudes and beliefs, it is important to include dis-
cussions about these topics in sexual assault programming. Few prospective

 studies have demonstrated a relationship between measures of rape support-
ive attitudes and beliefs and sexual assault perpetration. The current findings
support the notion that these beliefs and attitudes may predict sexual assault
prospectively, particularly for men who have a history of rape perpetration.
Future research should consider the role of cultural factors in sexual
assault perpetration. This may be accomplished through collaboration in
multisite investigations, which would also allow for greater sample sizes.
Moreover, follow-up periods that span greater lengths of time would allow
for better measurement of proportion of men that repeatedly commit acts of
sexual aggression. Finally, more attention should be directed at examining
the role of perceived social norms in prediction of sexual aggression. The
results presented here indicatethatfurther study and replicationiswarranted.
