Abstract
Background: Recently, the efficacy of dietary improvement as a therapeutic intervention for moderate to severe
depression was evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. The SMILES trial demonstrated a significant improvement
in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores favouring the dietary support group compared with a
control group over 12 weeks. We used data collected within the trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this novel
intervention.
Methods: In this prospective economic evaluation, sixty-seven adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for a major
depressive episode and reporting poor dietary quality were randomised to either seven sessions with a dietitian for
dietary support or to an intensity matched social support (befriending) control condition. The primary outcome was
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as measured by the AQoL-8D, completed at baseline and 12 week follow-up
(endpoint) assessment. Costs were evaluated from health sector and societal perspectives. The time required for
intervention delivery was costed using hourly wage rates applied to the time in counselling sessions. Food and
travel costs were also included in the societal perspective. Data on medications, medical services, workplace
absenteeism and presenteesim (paid and unpaid) were collected from study participants using a resource-use
questionnaire. Standard Australian unit costs for 2013/2014 were applied. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) were calculated as the difference in average costs between groups divided by the difference in average
QALYs. Confidence intervals were calculated using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure.
Results: Compared with the social support condition, average total health sector costs were $856 lower (95% CI
-1247 to − 160) and average societal costs were $2591 lower (95% CI -3591 to − 198) for those receiving dietary
support. These differences were driven by lower costs arising from fewer allied and other health professional visits
and lower costs of unpaid productivity. Significant differences in mean QALYs were not found between groups.
However, 68 and 69% of bootstrap iterations showed the dietary support intervention was dominant (additional
QALYs at less cost) from the health sector and societal perspectives.
Conclusions: This novel dietary support intervention was found to be likely cost-effective as an adjunctive
treatment for depression from both health sector and societal perspectives.

 Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) carries a significant
burden and cost to health care payers, employers and
society [1, 2]. Observational studies have revealed a rela-
tionship between diet quality and the risk of depression
[3]. However, until recently, this relationship had not
been evaluated in the context of a randomised clinical
trial (RCT) to allow causality to be elucidated. This led
to the creation of the Supporting the Modification of
lifestyle In Lowered Emotional States (SMILES) trial, the
first RCT to investigate the efficacy of a dietary interven-
tion as an adjunct to treatment of major depressive epi-
sodes [4]. The study hypothesized that prescriptive
individualised dietary support, focusing on improving
diet quality in participants with poor diet quality using a
modified Mediterranean diet model [5], would be super-
ior to a social support control condition (befriending) in
reducing the severity of depressive symptoms.
The primary results from the SMILES trial demon-
strated significant improvement in Montgomery–Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score for the dietary
support intervention group compared to the social sup-
port control group [6]. A significantly larger proportion
of participants in the dietary support group achieved re-
mission versus the control condition, based on MADRS
scores.
While the individual cost of providing a dietary support
intervention may be perceived as relatively small, indeed
there is an opportunity cost associated with any healthcare
intervention. This means there is an alternate use for the
resources to deliver the dietary support intervention that
could be directed toward some other purpose. It is there-
fore critical to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any
new interventions to ensure that government and society
allocate scarce healthcare dollars where they will have the
greatest value-for-money [7].
While
dietary
counselling
has
efficacy
and
cost-
effectiveness credentials in the management of obesity,
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it has not previously
been evaluated as an adjunctive therapy for the treat-
ment of depression [8]. Therefore, we conducted an eco-
nomic evaluation within the SMILES RCT to determine
whether dietary counselling for people with depression
would be cost-effective compared to the social support
control condition, where $50,000 per Quality Adjusted
Life Year (QALY) is taken as the benchmark for cost-
effectiveness in Australia. As recommended by the Second
Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine, both
health sector and societal perspectives are presented as
reference case analyses [9].
Methods
This economic evaluation utilised data collected as
part of the SMILES randomised trial. Details of the
SMILES trial protocol and main results have been
published elsewhere [4, 6]. In summary, adults meet-
ing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a major
depressive episode (MDE) and poor diet quality using
the Dietary Screening Tool were recruited. Exclusion
criteria comprised having a concurrent diagnosis of
bipolar (type I or II), personality or substance use dis-
orders, two or more failed trials of antidepressants,
an unstable medical comorbidity, pregnancy, or a
change in medications or psychotherapy in the pre-
ceding two weeks. Severe food allergies, intolerances,
aversions or socio-cultural reasons for dietary restric-
tions as well as current participation in an interven-
tion targeting diet or exercise also excluded potential
participants. People were recruited in Melbourne and
Geelong, Australia between October 2012 and No-
vember
2014
using
community-based
recruitment
strategies. Ethical approval was obtained from St.
Vincent’s Hospital, Barwon Health and Deakin University
Human Research Ethics Committees. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent after receiving a full de-
scription of the study.
Participants were randomly assigned to the dietary
support intervention (the modified Mediterranean diet)
[5] or the social support control condition. Personalised
dietary advice and nutrition counselling was provided by
an Accredited Practicing Dietitian (qualified clinical
dietitian) for up to seven individual face-to-face sessions
of approximately 60 min each. The social support condi-
tion comprised a manualised ‘befriending’ protocol,
which has been previously used in psychiatric trials and
aims to control for therapeutic effects in RCTs (i.e. time,
duration of therapy) [10]. The ‘befriending’ social sup-
port condition followed the same visit schedule and
length as the dietary support intervention, but consisted
of discussion of neutral topics of interest to the partici-
pant (i.e. sport, music, news), or in instances where par-
ticipants found conversation difficult, other activities
such as cards or board games. Befriending sessions were
guided by a trained research assistant, and the visits did
not engage in techniques specifically used in the major
therapeutic models of psychotherapy.
Costs
Australian health sector and societal perspectives were
used for the analyses to reflect different decision makers
and contexts as per current guidelines for reference
cases in economic evaluations [9]. The health sector
costs included in this evaluation were those required to
deliver the dietary support intervention or the social
support control condition, as well as the cost of health
care resources used by participants over the trial period.
Societal costs comprised the health sector costs in
Chatterton et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:599 
Page 2 of 11
 addition to the cost of patient transportation, food and
effects on productivity. The cost and outcomes included
in the analysis are reported in the Impact Inventory
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
The main resource required to deliver both the
dietary and the social support was the salary of
trained personnel. Detailed records of the number
and length of sessions for each participant were col-
lected by dietitians and befrienders. Hourly wage
rates with on-costs of 27% were applied to the total
time reported to provide the support for each par-
ticipant. For the dietary support group, the rate was
based on a grade two, year one dietitian from the
Victorian Hospitals’ Industrial Association salary cir-
cular [11]. The hourly wage rate to deliver the social
support condition was based on an entry level re-
search assistant salary (Level A, step1) at Deakin
University [12]. Since the dietary support interven-
tion aimed to modify the dietary intake of partici-
pants, the cost of food was also included in the
societal perspective. Food costs were estimated at
$112 per week for the dietary support group partici-
pants and $138 per week for the social support
group participants. This was based on the cost of
the first 20 study participants’ dietary intake at base-
line compared to the cost of the prescribed healthy
alternative, the modified Mediterranean diet [13].
The societal perspective also included transportation
costs to attend the dietary or social support sessions.
These were estimated by assuming a 30 km round
trip in a private vehicle per session, and then apply-
ing the cost/km typically used for tax reimbursement
in Australia [14].
Participants self-reported the use of prescription medi-
cations, over the counter medications and supplements,
the number of health professional visits (GPs, psychia-
trists, psychologists etc.), and hospitalisations with a
resource-use questionnaire administered at baseline and
the 12 week follow-up visit. The questionnaire asked for
all health care use and was not limited to the use of ser-
vices specifically for mental health concerns. The health-
care costs included in the analyses were those paid by
the government as a third-party payer and the out of
pocket costs borne by participants, such as co-payments
for prescription medications.
Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS) data was used
to calculate the government and patient out of pocket
costs for covered medications [15]. We assumed that all
participants would pay the general patient co-payment
($36.10). Online Australian retail pharmacy sites were
consulted to determine patient costs for other medica-
tions and supplements not covered by the PBS [16–18].
Health professional visits were costed using a weighted
average cost paid by the government, derived from the
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item reports [19].
Since a standard co-payment for health professional
visits is not in place under the MBS, participants were
asked to report the estimated out of pocket costs they
paid for these services.
Community mental health visits were costed using
data from the 2010 Australian Mental Health Report
[20] and the value then inflated to 2013/2014 dollars
using the total health price index calculated by the
Australian Institute for Health and Welfare [21].
Hospital stays were costed using public sector average
cost per separation, based on Australian Refined Diagno-
sis Related Groups (AR-DRGs) from the National Hos-
pital Cost Data Collection [22]. The specific AR-DRGs
were selected based on the reported reason and length
of stay.
The societal perspective incorporated patient transpor-
tation costs and effects on productivity. Transportation
costs for health professional visits were calculated from
the distance travelled in kilometres reported in the re-
source use questionnaire. We assumed a private vehicle
was used and therefore multiplied the distance by a
cost/km typically used for tax reimbursement [14].
Transport to hospital was estimated based on the cost
for a 15 km taxi ride in Melbourne [23].
The resource use questionnaire also asked participants
to self-report days off from paid and unpaid work (ab-
senteeism) as well as days worked while suffering health
problems as a proxy for presenteeism. To calculate the
hours of lost productivity due to presenteeism, we as-
sumed that 1.2 h of productivity was lost per day when a
person reported working while suffering health problems
[24]. The human capital approach [25] was used to value
lost paid productivity by using an average hourly wage
rate calculated from the average weekly earnings re-
ported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics plus 25%
overhead costs [26]. Time off from unpaid activities (i.e.
housework) was valued at 25% of the average wage rate
plus overhead costs to represent the value of partici-
pants’ lost leisure time [27].
All costs are presented in Australian dollars (AUD) for
the 2013/2014 financial reference year. Since the costs
and outcomes were collected over a 12 week period, dis-
counting was not applied.
Outcomes
The primary health outcome for the current study was
quality adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs are useful
outcome metrics since they can be applied across differ-
ent disease/disorder areas, thus allowing comparability
across a range of programs when evaluating economic
decisions. For example, in Australia $50,000/QALY has
been used as a rule of thumb to denote value-for-money
[28, 29]. QALYs are derived by “weighing” the length of
Chatterton et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:599

 life spent in a particular health state by the utility or
value of that health state. Utility values (or weights) are
constrained between 0 and 1 where 0 refers to death and
1 refers to perfect health and values in between denoting
less than perfect health states. To assess participants’
health-related quality of life and utility, the Assessment
of Quality of Life – Eight Dimension (AQoL-8D) [30]
was completed at each assessment. The AQoL-8D is a
multi-attribute utility instrument, with a separate utility
scoring algorithm associated with the instrument allow-
ing the calculation of utility values for each participant.
The utility algorithm used in the current study was de-
rived from the Australian general population [31]. The
QALYs for the 12 week follow-up period in the current
study were estimated using the area under the curve
method [32].
Statistical analyses
Data management and costing were completed using
Excel 2013, while statistical analyses were conducted
with Stata 14 (College Station, Texas, USA). SMILES
was originally powered to detect differences between
groups based on the primary clinical endpoint of
MADRS. Therefore, the sample sizes were not designed
to test the cost-effectiveness hypotheses. The reference
case analyses were undertaken as intention to treat. All
enrolled participants who completed a baseline assess-
ment were included; however, 33 % of participants did
not complete all of the health care resource use ques-
tions at the 12 week follow-up. The missing at random
assumption was tested through a series of logistic re-
gression analyses comparing participant characteristics
for those with and without missing endpoint data. To
account for missing utility values, health care, transpor-
tation, and lost productivity costs, the ICE multiple im-
putation technique in Stata was used [33]. Missing data
were imputed 33 times based on the percentage missing
from the health care utilisation variables [34]. General-
ised linear models (gamma family, log link), using the
mim command to combine the estimated coefficients
across the imputed datasets, were used to determine the
size and significance of differences between groups for
total costs (health sector and societal) and QALYs. For
each outcome, unadjusted models were developed along
with models incorporating the covariates of age, gender,
baseline utility and baseline cost.
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were
calculated as the difference in average cost between
the dietary support and social support groups, di-
vided by the difference in average QALYs. Confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for the incremental costs per
QALY gained were calculated using a nonparametric
bootstrap procedure, with 1000 iterations to reflect
the sampling uncertainty. The bootstrapped ICERs
and the CIs were graphically represented on cost-
effectiveness planes. A cost-effectiveness plane is a
plot of the 1000 bootstrapped incremental costs and
outcomes
across
four
quadrants.
The
north-east
quadrant represents the intervention costing more as
well as conferring greater benefits than the compara-
tor. The south-east quadrant shows the proportion
of iterations where the intervention costs less but in-
curs greater benefits than the comparator (i.e. a
“dominant” intervention), the north-west quadrant
shows the proportion of iterations where the inter-
vention incurs a cost but fewer benefits than the
comparator
(i.e.
a “dominated”
intervention)
and,
lastly, the south-west quadrant shows the proportion
of iterations whereby the intervention costs less and
has fewer benefits than the comparator group.
Sensitivity analyses
Imputation uncertainty was evaluated by comparing the
reference case results to the analysis of participants with
complete data. Generalised linear models (unadjusted
and adjusted) were used to evaluate the size and signifi-
cance
of
differences
between
groups,
and
non-
parametric bootstrapping was also employed concordant
with the reference case.
Additional sensitivity analysis was undertaken by vary-
ing the cost of the social support control condition to $0
to represent a scenario where the comparator would be
a ‘do nothing’ approach. The cost of the dietary support
intervention was also varied to assess the effect on the
incremental cost difference between groups. Assump-
tions regarding the food costs were explored by varying
the cost of food for the dietary intervention group.
Results
Demographic characteristics were well balanced between
the two study groups at baseline [6]. Additional baseline
statistics relevant to the economic evaluation are pre-
sented in Table 1. Mean baseline costs (health sector
and societal) were greater for the social support group,
although only the societal costs were significantly differ-
ent between groups. However, median values for costs
were comparable between the two groups.
Table 2 provides details of the intervention sessions
for both study groups and associated costs. The partici-
pants in the dietary support group attended significantly
more sessions and had a significantly greater number of
contact hours with a dietitian than the participants had
with a ‘befriender’. This led to the mean health sector
costs for the dietary support group being significantly
greater than the social support group. Conversely, the
intervention costs from the societal perspective were sig-
nificantly greater for the social support group due to the
additional cost of food.

 The reference case results using multiple imputation for
missing costs, and QALYs analysed with generalised linear
models, revealed no significant differences in QALYs be-
tween the dietary support and social support groups, even
when controlling for baseline age and gender (Table 3).
However, significant differences were found for total costs
(including the intervention and other costs) from both the
health sector and societal perspectives. When the results
were transformed from the log scale into dollars, total
health sector costs were $856 lower on average, and total
societal costs were $2591 lower, for the dietary support
group
than
the
social
support
group.
The
cost-
effectiveness plane in Fig. 1a) shows that 68% of boot-
strapped cost-effectiveness ratios using the health sector
perspective fell into the south-east quadrant, indicating
that the dietary intervention was dominant (lower total
costs and more QALYs). Thirty-two percent of iterations
fell into the lower left quadrant where the dietary inter-
vention was associated with lower total costs and fewer
QALYs. The bootstrapped results from the societal
perspective (Fig. 1b) were similar, with 69% of iterations
falling into the lower right quadrant, indicating domin-
ance of the dietary support intervention over the social
support group, and the remaining 31% falling into the
lower cost/fewer QALYs lower left quadrant.
Table 4 provides a breakdown of the cost categories
comprising total health sector and societal costs. These
values were the results of unadjusted generalised linear
models that were transformed to represent 2013/2014
Australian dollars, since the log link function produced re-
sults on a log scale. The dietary support intervention was
associated with significantly greater session delivery and
travel costs than the social support group. However, most
other cost categories were significantly lower for the dietary
support group with the exception of the transportation
costs for health care visits. The health care costs were an
average of $940 lower, and the cost of lost productivity was
$1589 lower, for the dietary support group than the social
support group. The social support group used significantly
more allied health professionals (occupational therapists,

 physiotherapists, osteopaths) and other health professionals
(dentists, podiatrists, orthodontists) as shown in Additional
file 1: Table S2. The results also show that the dietary inter-
vention appeared to reduce productivity costs: that is, par-
ticipants in the dietary support group missed fewer paid
and unpaid work days compared to those in the social sup-
port group (Table 4). This difference appears to be largely
driven by the significant difference in unpaid productivity
costs as demonstrated in Additional file 1: Table S3.
Sensitivity analyses
The analysis of complete cases, defined as participants with
complete cost and QALY data at the 12 week follow-up, in-
dicated similar results to the imputed ITT analysis as
shown in Table 3. The cost-effectiveness planes (Additional
file 1: Figures S1 and S2) show that the dietary intervention
was associated with a higher probability of reduced costs
and increased QALYS (81 and 80% respectively for health
sector and societal perspectives).
The results of the sensitivity analyses are presented
in the Additional file 1: Table S4 and S5. When the
cost to deliver the social support control condition
was adjusted to $0, total health sector costs were no
longer significantly different between groups for all
ITT results, as well as the complete cases in the ad-
justed model. The costs from the societal perspective
remained
significantly
different
between
the
study
groups, with the exception of the complete case ana-
lysis with the adjusted model, where food costs were
removed and the social support costs adjusted to $0.
When the cost of the dietary intervention increased
by a factor of 1.5, the difference in total health sector
costs between groups was no longer significant using
the adjusted glm (coefficient = − 0.491; p = 0.059). As
shown in Additional file 1: Table S5, the cost of food
for the dietary intervention group would need to in-
crease to $2325 for the dietary intervention to no
longer be significant using the results from the base
case ITT unadjusted glm model. Using the base case
ITT adjusted glm model the dietary intervention was
no longer significant when the cost of food increased
to $2600. The sensitivity results for the complete
cases showed that the results became non-significant
at smaller increases in food costs.
Discussion
This study provides a formal economic evaluation of the
first RCT to evaluate dietary improvement as a thera-
peutic approach for clinical depression. Our findings
suggest that a 12 week dietary support intervention had
significantly lower costs from both health sector and so-
cietal perspectives in the reference case analysis when
compared to a control condition. While sensitivity ana-
lyses showed this to be fairly robust, results were sensi-
tive to the cost of the comparator to the dietary support
intervention. For example, when the cost of the social
support intervention were removed, the total health sec-
tor costs of dietary support compared to social support
were not significantly different. However, the difference
remained significant from the societal perspective.
These results suggest that such an intervention has
the potential to provide value for money. Nutrition and
dietetic services have been shown to be cost-effective for
the reduction in LDL cholesterol levels in type 2 diabetes
patients [35], and provide a positive return on invest-
ment when used to treat patients with hypercholesterol-
emia [36], as well as other patient groups [37, 38].
Therefore, the current results are in line with the cost-
effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat other
health conditions. However, results of analyses of the
health care services used by participants demonstrated
that the social support group costs were significantly
higher for allied and other health professionals, such as
dentists, which may appear unrelated to depression. De-
pression impacts adherence and the therapeutic alliance,
and is an adverse prognostic marker across seemingly
disparate disorders. However, there is a strong, bidirec-
tional relationship between depression and multiple

 chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular dis-
ease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity
[39, 40]. Diet quality is an important determinant of all.
Fewer visits to non-mental health professionals suggests
that a dietary improvement strategy may have multiple
benefits that translate to wider health and wellbeing
outcomes.
While the utility values for both groups significantly
improved over the course of the trial, these values
and QALYs were not significantly different between
the study groups at 12 week follow-up. The average
utility values for this cohort, 0.47 at baseline, were
lower than the population norm of 0.83 [41], but
similar to the average for individuals with depression
from a representative survey of the Australian popula-
tion [42].
An alternate analytic approach to the current cost-
utility analysis would be to use clinical endpoints
such as the change in MADRS or symptom remission
as outcome measures. However, we did not undertake
these analyses since the primary study results demon-
strated significant improvement in MADRS scores
and a greater percentage of remission in the dietary
support intervention over the social support group
[6]. Combining these clinical endpoints with the find-
ing that the dietary support intervention was less
costly would indicate that the dietary intervention
would also be considered the “dominant” strategy
providing greater efficacy at a lower cost.
Strengths and limitations
A strength of the current study was the collection of
health care resource utilisation and health preference
data prospectively within the trial and the application of
conservative unit cost estimates to determine the cost/
QALY from a health sector perspective. This evaluation
also included a societal perspective as recommended by
the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and
Medicine [9]. The study design used the social support
condition as an active control, which was intended to
avoid a nocebo effect that a usual care comparator may
induce and to control for the non-specific benefits of
face to face interactions [43].
The results of this economic evaluation should, how-
ever, be viewed cautiously due to several limitations. The
sample size included in the trial was small (Dietary
Support group n = 33, Social Support group n = 34) and
limit feasibility and generalisability of the dietary support
intervention. Despite the high prevalence of depression
in Australia [44], and the presence of poor diet quality
[45], few individuals who were interested in participation
actually met the entry criteria for the trial. The small
sample size, combined with over one-third of missing
follow-up cost data and the typically skewed nature of
cost data, present additional statistical challenges. While
we have attempted to address these using methodologic-
ally rigorous methods and conservative assumptions,
these results require replication. Moreover, while the
outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation,
trial participants were not. It is unclear whether expect-
ation bias may have influenced the measured outcomes
of this analysis in some way. However, psychological
support has the greater face validity in the community
as an effective intervention.
It is important to note that while there were no signifi-
cant differences in resource use and costs between the
groups at baseline, there were trends toward greater
health sector and societal costs in the social support
group. However, the adjusted analyses incorporated
baseline cost values and showed that the findings were
reasonably robust.
Moreover, the resource use and lost productivity data
were reliant on participant recall; however, this was over
a relatively brief time period (12 weeks). While recall
may
introduce
additional
bias
into
the
results,
participant-reported data is frequently used in economic
evaluations conducted within clinical trials. The brief
12 week follow-up period aids participant recall, how-
ever it is unclear whether the cost savings found over
the brief time period of this trial would be maintained
over the longer term.
The 12 week follow –up may also be perceived as a
limitation due to diminishing rates of adherence to
diets over longer time periods. However, previous
studies evaluating Mediterranean diets for the preven-
tion of cardiovascular disease have shown high rates
of adherence to this dietary pattern over two to five
years [46–48]. Additionally, given that the cost to de-
liver the intervention would be incurred up-front (in
the first 12 weeks) a longer follow up period may in
fact
favour
the
dietary
intervention
in
the
cost-
effectiveness analysis.
Finally, the resource use questionnaire, while capturing
the bulk of service use, did not include questions on all
societal costs (e.g. criminal justice costs and community
care costs were not explicitly measured). This was
largely because brevity of questionnaires was required so
that subject recruitment would not be compromised.
While it is unlikely that this intervention would affect
such costs, we cannot be certain.
Conclusions
This analysis provides preliminary data to support the
cost-effectiveness of a dietary support intervention as an
adjunct to medication and psychological care for people
with MDE. Further research is needed to validate the re-
sults of this novel study.
