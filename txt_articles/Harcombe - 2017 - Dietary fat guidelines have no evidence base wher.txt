 Dietary fat guidelines have no evidence base:
where next for public health nutritional advice?
Zoë Harcombe
ABSTRACT
Introduction National dietary guidelines were
introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the US and UK
governments, with the aim of reducing coronary heart
disease (CHD) mortality. The 2 specific dietary fat
recommendations were to reduce total fat and saturated
fat consumption to 30% and 10% of total energy
intake, respectively.
Methods 4 systematic reviews (3 with meta-analysis)
were undertaken to examine the evidence for these
dietary fat guidelines: (1) randomised controlled trial
(RCT) and (2) prospective cohort (PC) evidence at the
time the guidelines were introduced; and (3) RCT and
(4) PC evidence currently available. This narrative review
examines all evidence collated.
Results The RCT and PC evidence available to the
dietary committees did not support the introduction of
the dietary fat guidelines. The RCT and PC evidence
currently available does not support the extant
recommendations. Furthermore, the quality of the
evidence is so poor that it could not be relied on had it
provided support.
Conclusions Dietary fat guidelines have prevailed for
almost 40 years. The evidence base at the time of their
introduction has been examined for the first time and
found lacking. Evidence currently available provides no
additional support. Public health opinion differed when
the guidelines were introduced. Opposition to the
guidelines is becoming more strident. Substantial
increases in diet-related illness over the past four
decades, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes,
indicate that a review of dietary advice is warranted.
“The urgency of finding means of prevention is
sharpest for men in middle age for it is in that
group that the social cost of CHD is greatest…
Starting
with
men
aged
40
through
59,
the
follow-up would show CHD causing close to 40%
of all deaths in five years. It is understandable,
then, that most work on the epidemiology of CHD
begins with men of those ages. Ancel Keys, The
Seven Countries Study (1970) (ref 1, p. I-1).”
INTRODUCTION
The first part of the diet–heart hypothesis, that
serum cholesterol was related to coronary heart
disease
(CHD),
originated
from
the
work
of
Russian pathologists in the early 20th century.
Having observed fatty deposits in arteries during
postmortems, a number of researchers sought to
understand if dietary cholesterol determined serum
cholesterol.2–9 The summary of findings from the
original animal studies was that: rabbits (herbi-
vores) fed animal foods developed fatty deposits/
changes in the aortas; rats (omnivores) fed animal
foods produced no observable changes in the
aortas; and rabbits fed cholesterol in plant food
showed no arterial damage.
In the 1950s, Keys undertook several experi-
ments with human subjects and concluded “that
the cholesterol content, per se, of all natural diets
has no significant effect on either the serum choles-
terol level or the development of atherosclerosis in
man” (ref. 10, p. 182).
The logic that only animal foods contain choles-
terol and thus, if animal foods consumed to admin-
ister dietary cholesterol had no impact on serum
cholesterol then animal foods per se had no impact
on serum cholesterol was overlooked. Attention
turned to dietary fat in food when non-animal
foods would have been more logical to examine.
The second part of the diet–heart hypothesis,
that dietary fat and serum cholesterol were related,
followed
observational
studies
of
men
in
Minnesota,
Naples,
Slough
and
Madrid.
Keys
et al11 concluded that the total fat content of the
diet (as a proportion of calories) exerted a power-
ful influence on the serum cholesterol level in man.
Age appeared to be a confounder, with cholesterol
rising to the age of 50–55 in Minnesotan and
Slough men and rich men in Madrid. Neopolitan
men and poor men in Madrid demonstrated stable
and falling cholesterol levels, respectively, between
the ages of 40 and 50, rising before these ages.
The third part of the diet–heart hypothesis, that
dietary fat and CHD were related, was first pre-
sented with the graph of deaths from heart disease
and calories from total fat in men aged 55–59, for
six countries, from the Mount Sinai presentation of
1953.12
The
response
of
Yerushalmy
and
Hilleboe13 demonstrated that data were available
for 22 countries.
Keys et al10 concluded that no other variable,
besides the fat calories in the diet, showed anything
like such a consistent relationship to the mortality
rate from CHD.
The first statement of the diet–heart hypothesis,
with the three component parts, appears to have
been made in a 1955 publication, which explored
the relationship between dietary fat, serum choles-
terol and CHD in different ethnic groups in Cape
T
own.14 This paper confirmed that total fat intake
and animal fat intake were the subjects of examin-
ation. Saturated fat was not mentioned.
This was the context for the start of the Seven
Countries
Study
in
1956–1958.
The
Seven
Countries Study concluded that there was no rela-
tionship with total fat and CHD, but that there was
a strong correlation between saturated fat intake
and CHD in cross country comparison.1

 In ideal research circumstances, epidemiological evidence
would have established clear and consistent associations and
then well designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would
have followed epidemiological findings and set out to test asso-
ciations found. This did not happen with the development of
the diet–heart hypothesis. Possibly the sense of urgency took
over. The epidemiology and RCTs were running in parallel from
the 1950s onwards.
The focus on men, and men who had already had a heart
attack in the case of the RCTs, was understandable in the
context of the Keys’ quotation opening this paper. This focus,
however, lacked generalisability for the population as a whole.
METHODS
Four systematic reviews and, where possible, meta-analysis were
undertaken to examine the evidence base for dietary fat guide-
lines. The first review examined RCT evidence available to the
dietary guideline committees in 1977 and 1983.15 The second
review examined epidemiological evidence available to the
dietary guideline committees.16 The third review examined
RCT evidence available today, to see if extant dietary guidelines
have been proven in retrospect.17 The fourth review examined
epidemiological evidence available today, to see if extant dietary
guidelines have been proven in retrospect.18
This paper summarises the findings of the four reviews under-
taken, to consider all evidence available at the time of the intro-
duction of dietary guidelines and that currently available, to
assess the evidence base for dietary advice. It summarises the
conclusions of other meta-analyses of RCTs and/or prospective
cohort studies, highlighting the predominance of non-significant
findings. It discusses population health trends since the intro-
duced dietary guidelines, and considers if a simple public health
message could offer a way forward.
RESULTS
The findings
Public health advice for all citizens should be informed by con-
clusive, consistent evidence from numerous robust studies of an
appropriate representative group of such citizens (large enough,
long enough, studies of healthy men and women of all ages).
This did not happen before the guidelines were set. It has not
happened since and it is unlikely to happen in the future, con-
sidering cost, ethical and confounding variable complications,
such as the prevalence of medication. There are two key issues
with the evidence in the four systematic reviews.15–18
The conclusions of the evidence
The evidence available to the dietary committees at the time the
guidelines were introduced did not support the recommenda-
tions made. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs
available in 1977/1983, where a dietary fat intervention had
been made, revealed identical all-cause mortality (30% in inter-
vention and control groups) and no statistically significant differ-
ence in deaths from CHD.15 A systematic review of prospective
cohort studies available in 1977/1983 found one study, the
Seven Countries Study, offering support for saturated, but not
total, fat to be a subject for further examination and five studies
with no significant findings in relation to total, or saturated,
dietary fat.16
The evidence currently available offers no additional support.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary fat RCTs cur-
rently available, where a dietary fat intervention had been made,
found no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality
or deaths from CHD.17 A systematic review and meta-analysis
of prospective cohort studies currently available found no statis-
tically significant results to implicate total or saturated fat in
CHD mortality.18
With one exception, the specific guidelines of 30% total fat
and 10% saturated fat have not been tested. The St Thomas’
Atherosclerosis Regression Study (STARS)19 was the only study
to examine targets approximating to those set by dietary guide-
lines, with a total fat consumption of 27% and an 8–10% satu-
rated fat intake. The Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART)20
tested a 30% total fat diet, although this was not a controlled
variable, as the intervention also tried to achieve a 1:1 polyun-
saturated to saturated fat ratio. T
wo RCTs studied an approxi-
mate 20% fat diet: the 1965 Research Committee Low-fat Diet;
and the W
omen’s Health Initiative (2006).21 22 W
oodhill et al23
and Frantz et al24 reviewed the consequence of a 10% saturated
fat diet, without the total fat dietary guideline restriction. The
prospective cohort studies examined grams of fat intake for
those who died from CHD versus those who did not, or fat
intake as a percentage of calories, sometimes in absolute
amounts, sometimes comparing lowest and highest tertiles, quar-
tiles or quintiles. They did not examine populations for out-
comes related to the two dietary fat guidelines. This is not a
criticism of the studies. Public health policy should follow evi-
dence, not the other way round.
The STARS RCT claimed that its findings supported the use
of a lipid-lowering diet in men with CHD.19 Three prospective
cohort studies reported strong evidence for an association
between dietary fat and CHD: the Seven Countries Study found
an association with saturated fat;25 Boniface and T
efft26 found
an association with both total and saturated fat, but for men
only, not women; Xu et al27 found associations for total fat,
saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid intake in
American Indians aged 47–59 years, but not older.
All other RCTs and prospective cohort studies reported no
significant findings for total or saturated dietary fat: four RCTs
issued cautions about the safety and/or efficacy of their interven-
tions.21 23 28 29 Rose et al28 reported that corn oil was most
unlikely to be beneficial, and was possibly harmful. The
Research Committee Low-fat Diet concluded that a low-fat diet
has no place in the treatment of myocardial infarction.21
Dayton et al29 noted the absence of any benefit for longevity
and expressed concern about toxicity of the intervention.
W
oodhill et al23 reported that survival was significantly better in
the control than the diet group.
Regarding the serum cholesterol part of the diet–heart
hypothesis, the RCTs at the time and currently available collect-
ively reported greater reductions in mean serum cholesterol
levels in the intervention groups, but this did not result in a
reduction in deaths, from CHD or all causes. These findings
raise questions about the mechanism of cholesterol-lowering
medications, such as statins. It has been assumed that statins
lower cholesterol and lowering cholesterol lowers death rates.
There may be another mechanism by which statins have an
effect, independent of cholesterol. Caution should be adopted
in using cholesterol as a surrogate end point: the new propro-
tein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9) are
being launched with surrogate end point evidence alone,
without evidence for CHD mortality.30
Plant sterols offer a plausible explanation for dietary interven-
tions lowering cholesterol, but not mortality. Phytosterols are
cholesterol-like molecules found in all plant foods, with the
highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. They are
absorbed only in trace amounts, but inhibit the absorption of
intestinal
cholesterol.31

 phytosterols in the human diet are β-sitosterol, campesterol and
stigmasterol, which account for ∼65%, 30% and 3% of diet
contents, respectively.32 The ability of phytosterols to inhibit the
absorption of cholesterol was first established in 1953.33
However, there is no evidence that plant sterols reduce the risk
of CHD and much evidence that they are detrimental.34
The quality of the evidence
Even if the evidence from prospective cohort studies and RCTs
had been overwhelming, the limitations of the studies were so
great that the evidence could not be relied on. Only one RCT
was a primary prevention study of men and women.24 Only one
prospective cohort study, with evidence for CHD mortality,
examined men and women, free from CHD at the baseline.35
All prospective cohort studies suffered the limitations of dietary
questionnaires.36–40 Other limitations of each study have been
documented in the systematic reviews.15–18
The Seven Countries Study
The strongest evidence presented, among 10 RCTs and 13 pro-
spective cohort studies, came from the Seven Countries Study
(1970).25 Keys noted in the introduction to the Seven Countries
Study publication that association did not mean causation, but
the strength of conclusions did not adopt this caution. The con-
clusions of this study defined the diet–heart hypothesis as the
tripartite association of saturated fat, serum cholesterol levels
and CHD, the impact of dietary cholesterol and total dietary fat
having been rejected.25
The correlations established by the Seven Countries Study
were strong. The correlation between median serum cholesterol
level and CHD deaths and infarctions (data for CHD deaths
alone
were
not
presented)
per
100
people
was
r=0.76
(p<0.05). The correlation between CHD deaths and infarctions
and saturated fat as a percentage of calories was r=0.84
(p<0.05).41 However, these correlations were for countries
versus each other, not for people in one country who died from
CHD versus those in the same country who did not.
The confounders were significant, including, but not limited
to: geography, lifestyle, gross domestic product, climate, politics,
other aspects of national diet, national health provision, etc.
When asked about the value of Keys’ work, a contemporary of
the time, Professor Peter Elwood, described intercountry studies
as ‘the lowest form of evidence’ (P Elwood, personal communi-
cation, 2015).
The Seven Countries Study suffered from further limitations
with the preselection of countries known to be associated: an
average of 3.4% of men sampled for dietary information; and
the inclusion of men with pre-existing CHD, with the finding
that the CHD death rate within 5 years was 20.9% for second-
ary males and 1.0% for primary males.
Without these limitations, the strong correlations established
by the Seven Countries Study were not unique. Equally strong
correlations had been established with animal protein, with
gross domestic product suggested as the confounder13 and tele-
vision sets and vehicle licenses.42 The strongest correlation was
established with latitude: the correlation coefficient for CHD
deaths and the latitude of the 16 cohorts in the Seven Countries
Study was 0.93; the correlation coefficient for CHD deaths and
the latitude of the seven countries was 0.96.16
A definitive assessment of the strength of associations found in
research was proposed by Bradford Hill with his nine criteria.43
In 2009, Mente et al reviewed RCTs and prospective cohort
studies against these criteria for numerous foods and nutrients.
They concluded: “Insufficient evidence of association is present
for intake of … saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; total
fat; linolenic acid; meat; eggs and milk” (ref. 44, p. 659).
Although the Seven Countries Study was not referenced by
the US committee February publication,45 it was referenced by
the UK committee46 and Keys and his research was referenced
40 times in the 869 supplemental pages to the dietary guide-
lines.47 The fact that Keys had appeared on the front cover of
Time Magazine attested to the regard with which he was held.48
There can be little doubt that the Seven Countries Study had a
significant impact on the introduction of dietary fat guidelines.
Other meta-analyses
A number of meta-analyses of RCTs, examining dietary fat and
mortality have been undertaken by other authors.49–51 One
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies has been undertaken
by
other
authors,
Siri-Tarino
et
al.52
T
wo
additional
meta-analyses reviewed both RCTs and prospective cohort
studies:53 54 Skeaff and Miller (2009) sought to summarise the
evidence from cohort studies and RCTs of the relation between
dietary fat and risk of CHD. Their conclusion was “Intake of
total fat was not significantly associated with CHD mortality.
Intake of total fat was also unrelated to CHD events” (ref. 53,
p. 175). Chowdhury et al (2014) set out to summarise evidence
between fatty acids and coronary disease. Their review exam-
ined saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans
fats, while also reviewing individual chain length fatty acids, pal-
mitic (C16:0) and margaric (C17:0) as examples. The conclu-
sion
was
“Current
evidence
does
not
clearly
support
cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of
polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total satu-
rated fats” (ref. 54, p. 398).
T
able 1 summarises the findings from other meta-analyses of
RCTs and/or prospective cohort studies. There were 39 reports
of risk ratios (RRs) from meta-analysis with 95% CIs. Of these,
4 reported significant findings; 35 reported no significant find-
ings. One of the significant findings, from Chowdhury et al,54
related to trans fats, not total or saturated fat. It found that
trans fat intake was positively associated with coronary disease.
Another of the significant findings came from the Mozaffarian
et al51 study of the impact of replacing saturated fat with poly-
unsaturated fat, which was criticised56 for excluding two studies
that would have moderated this conclusion23 28 and including a
favourable, but non-randomised crossover, trial excluded by all
other meta-analyses.57
The other two significant findings were related to cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) events and not mortality.50 55 In 2011,
including RCTs with a minimum of 6 months duration, Hooper
et al found 1 significant result and 11 non-significant results.
The one significant result was that, when all RCTs were exam-
ined together, the RR for CVD events from meta-analysis was
0.86 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.96). In 2015, including RCTs with a
minimum of 24 months duration, Hooper et al found one sig-
nificant result and seven non-significant results. The one signifi-
cant result was, when a reduction in saturated fat was examined,
the RR for CVD events from meta-analysis was 0.83 (95% CI
0.72 to 0.96).
As a result of this 2015 review, Hooper et al55 suggested that
there may be a small reduction in cardiovascular risk with
reduction of saturated fat intake. It was further suggested that
replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat
“appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohy-
drate appears less useful” (ref. 55, p. 2) and replacement with
monounsaturated fat unclear. Of the 11 interventions contribut-
ing to this conclusion, only 1 documented both saturated fat

 reduction and reported that this was mainly replaced with poly-
unsaturated fat.29
It is important to differentiate between polyunsaturated fats.
The DART provided early evidence for the benefit of omega-3
polyunsaturated fat, naturally abundant in fish.20 The only sig-
nificant finding from this RCT was that all-cause mortality was
lower for those following the fish advice, which was to increase
fatty fish intake to at least two portions (200–400 g) weekly.
The relative risk for fish advice versus no fish advice was 0.71
(0.54–0.92) (p<0.05) (table IV
, ref. 20, p. 759). This significant
finding was explored further by the research team, but not
found to be replicated.58 Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats have
proinflammatory properties, which can be mitigated by omega-3
intake,59 but any dietary advice on polyunsaturated fats needs to
be specific and evidence based.
The Hooper meta-analyses of 2011 and 2015 included four
small studies (646 people in total), not included in any other
meta-analysis, which were primarily studies of: diabetes,60 skin
cancer,61 hypercholesterolaemia,62 and glucose intolerance;63
but for which Hooper et al obtained CVD event information.
The most recent review55 included no study of healthy people
of both genders. The one primary, both-sex RCT available was
excluded by Hooper et al24 for not meeting the 24 month dur-
ation criteria. The one significant finding of small benefit for
CVD events, among numerous insignificant findings, thus also
lacked generalisability.
Dietary fat guidelines were introduced with the ambition of
reducing deaths from CHD. No meta-analysis of RCTs and/or
prospective cohort studies has found any significant difference
for dietary fat interventions and all-cause mortality or deaths
from
CHD,
or
associations
with
dietary
fat
and
CHD
mortality.15–18 49–55
DISCUSSION
Have there been consequences?
The proponents of the dietary guidelines foresaw no risks and
yet the coincident emergence of epidemics in obesity and dia-
betes suggests that this confidence may have been unjustified.
Both the US45 and UK46 documents, which introduced
national dietary guidelines, acknowledged that the evidence was

many people who will say we have not proven our point”
(ref. 45, p. 3).
Hegsted continued by asking “What are the risks associated
with eating less meat, less fat, less saturated fat, less cholesterol,
less sugar, less salt, and more fruits, vegetables, unsaturated fat
and cereal products—especially whole grain cereals. There are
none that can be identified” (ref. 45, p. 8).
Senators Percy, Schweiker and Zorinsky wrote a foreword to
the second edition of the guidelines noting the “lack of consen-
sus among nutritional scientists and other health professionals”
(ref. 64, p. vii). They recommended that it be stated in bold
print on the Goals and Food Selection pages “that the value of
dietary change remains controversial and that science cannot at
this time insure (sic) that an altered diet will improve protection
from certain killer diseases such as heart disease and cancer”
(ref. 64, p. ix).
The second edition of the US Dietary Goals was published at
the end of 1977.64 In between the first edition45 and the
second,
many
witnesses
appeared
before
the
committee.
Deliberations were reflected in a number of comments from the
second edition of the guidelines: “Some witnesses have claimed
that physical harm could result from the diet modifications
recommended in this report…However, after further review, the
Select Committee still finds that no physical or mental harm
could result from the dietary guidelines recommended for the
general public”(ref. 64, p. xxxiii). The view was, therefore, that
even if benefit were unproven, no harm could be done.
There are three macronutrients: carbohydrate, protein and
fat. Protein is found in all foods except pure fats (oils and lard)
and sucrose.65 The proportion of protein in a natural diet thus
tends to remain constant at ∼15–20% of energy intake.66 If fat
intake is reduced, as a proportion of energy intake, carbohy-
drate concomitantly rises. The consequences of increasing
carbohydrate content in human diets had not been investigated
before the dietary fat guidelines were introduced.
Until the introduction of dietary guidelines in 1977, the view
of
Tanner,
from
the
Practice
of
Medicine,
prevailed
“Farinaceous and vegetable foods are fattening, and saccharine
matters are especially so” (ref. 67, p. 213). In 1960, 13.3% of
US adults were obese; 44.8% were overweight. By 2007, 34.7%
of US adults were obese; 67.7% were overweight.68 In the UK,
in 1972, 2.7% of men and 2.7% of women were obese and
23.0% of men and 13.9% of women were overweight. By
1999, obesity rates had risen to 22.6% of men and 25.8% of
women, while 49.2% of men and 36.3% of women were over-
weight.69 (Health was devolved in the UK in 1999 to the
regions of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and W
ales and
thus UK statistics terminated).
The diabetes rate was 2.4% in 1976 in the USA.70 The intro-
duction to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reported
that 24 million Americans, almost 11% of the adult population,
were diabetic and 78 million Americans, 35% of the adults, were
pre-diabetic.71 This has recently been updated to 29 million dia-
betics and 86 million pre-diabetics.72 A recent review in the
Lancet estimated that the lifetime risk for developing diabetes
was 40.2% for American men and 39.6% for women.73 There
were 800 000 people with diabetes in the UK in 1980, from a
population of 56 million—an incident rate of 1.42%.74 The dia-
betes rate in the UK in 2015 was 6.1%.75 The incident rate of
diabetes, both in the USA and the UK, has increased more than
fourfold since the dietary fat guidelines were introduced.
The association between the introduction of the dietary fat
guidelines and concomitant increases in obesity and diabetes
deserves examination. A number of recent reviews have sug-
gested a causal connection: “The replacement of saturated fats
in the diet with carbohydrates, especially sugars, has resulted in
increased
obesity and
its
associated
health
complications”
(ref. 76, p. 294). In a BMJ Editorial, cardiologist Malhotra
closed with the statement: “It is time to bust the myth of the
role of saturated fat in heart disease and wind back the harms of
dietary advice that has contributed to obesity” (ref. 77, p. 1). In
2014, DiNicolantino questioned current dietary guidelines.
Having reviewed data trends for dietary fat and obesity in the
USA, he concluded: “These data provide a strong argument that
the increase in the consumption of refined carbohydrates was
the causative dietary factor for the diabetes and obesity epi-
demic in the USA” (ref. 78, p. 1). Following a Swedish system-
atic review of the literature, an article was published in the BMJ
entitled “Swedish health advisory body says too much carbohy-
drate, not fat, leads to obesity”.79 Feinman et al analysed US
dietary intake for the period 1974–2000 and concluded:
“During the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, caloric
increases have been due almost entirely to increased carbohy-
drate” (ref. 80, p. 6).
A way forward?
It seems simple and obvious to suggest that populations should
return to eating the natural, unprocessed food that was con-
sumed before obesity and diabetes reached epidemic propor-
tions; yet this is considered heresy by public health advisors.
Clarification of the distinction between processed food and satu-
rated fat could provide opportunity for agreement that pro-
cessed food is unhealthy, while saturated fat is a natural part of
most natural foods. It is worth noting that every food that con-
tains fat contains all three fats: saturated; monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated.65 The notion that saturated fat is harmful and
unsaturated fat is healthful is illogical given their coexistence in
foods required for human survival.
The
Dietary
Guidelines for
Americans
documented
the
sources of saturated fat in the American diet (figures 3–4,
ref. 71, p. 26). Pizza, desserts, candy, potato chips, pasta, tortil-
las, burritos and tacos accounted for 32.6% of saturated fat con-
sumed in the diets of US citizens aged 2 years and older. About
9.3% of dietary saturated fat came from sausages, frankfurters,
bacon, ribs and burgers. In total, 12.8% came from chicken and
mixed chicken dishes, beef and mixed beef dishes, and eggs and
mixed egg dishes. A further 24.5% was unaccounted for and
collated as ‘all other food categories’, most likely including, if
not predominantly being, processed foods. The natural foods
listed were cheese, milk, butter, nuts and seeds, which collect-
ively accounted for 20.8% of saturated fat intake. It would have
been ideal for unprocessed chicken, beef and eggs to have been
separated from processed meals containing these ingredients.
The diagram presented in the Dietary Guidelines is clear none-
theless. Processed foods account for the majority of saturated fat
intake in the diets of Americans.
The UK classification is similar. The Family Food Survey
(table 2.4, ref. 81, p. 18) documented sources of saturated fat in
the UK diet. Bread, cakes, buns, pastries, biscuits, cereals, con-
fectionery and other processed foods accounted for 33% of
saturated fat intake. Milk, cream and cheese accounted for 24%
of dietary saturated fat. Processed meat accounted for 16% of
saturated fat intake, while unprocessed (carcass) meat was 5%,
fish 1% and eggs 1% of saturated fat intake. Fats and oils made
up the remaining 19% (99% due to rounding errors). As with

 the USA, processed food accounted for the majority of the satu-
rated fat intake in the UK.
There is opportunity for strong agreement among health pro-
fessionals. If the public health message were revised to advise
citizens to eat natural food and not processed food, saturated fat
intake would fall accordingly, although the health benefit would
most likely be the concomitant reduction in sucrose, trans fats,
refined carbohydrates and other processed ingredients deleteri-
ous to human health. Human beings evolved to eat foods avail-
able from the natural environment.82 It does not seem logical to
advise populations away from carcass meat, dairy produce, eggs,
nuts and seeds, in the name of saturated fat, when the modern
processed foods, biscuits, cakes, pizza, desserts and ready meals
are more sensibly related to modern illness.65
Close
An exchange between Dr Robert Olson of St Louis University
and
Senator
George
McGovern,
chair
of
the
Dietary
Committee, was recorded in July 1977.83 Olson said “I pleaded
in my report and will plead again orally here for more research
on
the
problem
before we
make
announcements to
the
American public.” McGovern replied “Senators don’t have the
luxury that the research scientist does of waiting until every last
shred of evidence is in”.
The evidence is now in. Indeed, the evidence was available at
the time. The original problem was defined in middle-aged
men. Middle-aged men were the primary focus of RCTs and
epidemiological evidence at the time: secondary men for the
intervention trials and largely healthy men for the cohort
studies. Despite only one study finding associations,1 and many
others advising caution21 23 28 and despite a total lack of gener-
alisability, guidelines were introduced for whole populations
and have prevailed since.
An additional consequence of the guidelines is that, while it
has been assumed that total and saturated dietary fat and dietary
and serum cholesterol have been primary causes of CHD,
factors of genuine concern have not been investigated as fully as
they warrant.
Public health dietary fat guidelines need urgent review and
revision.
What are the findings?
▸ Dietary recommendations were introduced in the USA (1977)
and in the UK (1983) to (1) reduce overall fat consumption
to 30% of total energy intake and (2) reduce saturated fat
consumption to 10% of total energy intake. Four systematic
reviews have been undertaken of the randomised controlled
trial (RCT) and prospective cohort study evidence available
to the dietary committees and that currently available. This
paper presents the totality of the evidence, then and now,
to show that the extant dietary fat guidelines were and are
without evidence base.
▸ Even if the evidence had been overwhelming, the limitations
of the studies were so great that the evidence could not be
relied on.
▸ Other meta-analyses of RCTs and/or prospective cohort
studies have reported 39 risk ratios between them, 35 of
which were not significant. Not one of the four significant
results found any relationship between dietary fat (total or
saturated) and mortality.
How might this impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Public health advice on dietary fat has prevailed since 1977/
1983 in the absence of supporting evidence. Dietary advice
in both nations need re-examination.
▸ Dietary guidelines to restrict total fat intake to 30%
concomitantly established a carbohydrate intake of 55%.
Diabetes and obesity have increased dramatically since; this
association needs examination.
▸ Official listed sources of saturated fat are essentially lists of
processed foods: baked goods, confectionery, desserts,
snacks, and processed ready meals. A way forward in the
current dietary guideline ‘battle’ could be agreement that
processed food should be the subject of attack, not any
natural fat in natural food.
