abstract
The martial arts can provide children and adolescents with vigorous levels 
of physical exercise that can improve overall physical fi
 tness. The various 
types of martial arts encompass noncontact basic forms and techniques 
that may have a lower relative risk of injury. Contact-based sparring with 
competitive training and bouts have a higher risk of injury. This clinical 
report describes important techniques and movement patterns in several 
types of martial arts and reviews frequently reported injuries encountered 
in each discipline, with focused discussions of higher risk activities. Some 
of these higher risk activities include blows to the head and choking or 
submission movements that may cause concussions or signifi
 cant head 
injuries. The roles of rule changes, documented benefi
 ts of protective 
equipment, and changes in training recommendations in attempts to reduce 
injury are critically assessed. This information is intended to help pediatric 
health care providers counsel patients and families in encouraging safe 
participation in martial arts.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
The term martial arts is derived from the “arts of Mars” (Roman god 
of war) 
1 and presently encompasses formal combat traditions that 
can be practiced for self-defense, competition, physical fitness, motor 
development, and emotional growth. More than 6.5 million children 
participate in some form of martial arts in the United States. 
2 Martial 
arts can be effective tools for building muscle strength and balance and 
enhancing flexibility in children and adolescents, 
 
3, 
 
4 as well as positive 
interventions and activities in which to help build cognitive function, 
self-esteem, self-respect, and self-awareness.5 
– 
7
Various types of martial art disciplines can be categorized as striking 
(using blocks, kicks, punches, knees, and elbows to defend oneself while 
on one’s feet 
8), grappling (taking an opponent to the ground to achieve 
a dominant position or use a submission hold to end a fight), weapon-
based, or low-impact/meditative style with overriding philosophies that 
are oriented toward combat, health, or spirituality. Mixed martial arts

 (MMA) involves the combination of 
different types of martial arts in a 
competitive venue.
The practice of a particular martial 
art or MMA involves both training 
and possibly competitive activities. 
All martial artists execute forms, 
which are individualized repetitive 
practice of movements, striking/
blocking techniques, and potential 
use of weapons without any contact 
with objects or other performers. Not 
all martial arts practitioners progress 
to combat practice or competition.
For those martial arts disciplines 
that involve combat elements, a 
common training practice involves 
sparring. Sparring is defined as 
actual combat or fighting between 
2 individuals that uses particular 
techniques of blocking, kicking, 
striking, and takedowns (throws 
from the standing position 
8), as 
taught by each style of martial arts 
and overseen by instructors. Sparring 
may begin at any age, as directed by 
the martial arts instructor, and often 
after learning basic movements/
forms. Martial arts students are 
often categorized according to age 
and belt color, with advanced belt 
designations earned after proper 
execution of forms often combined 
with sparring.
Some martial arts styles require 
participants to use soft gear intended 
for head and body protection. Martial 
arts competitions are formal and 
ritualized time-measured events 
with referees often awarding points 
and supervising conduct of the 
performers.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PEDIATRIC AND 
ADOLESCENT MARTIAL ARTS INJURIES
Pediatric and adolescent martial 
arts injuries and injury risk are very 
difficult to quantify, stratify, and 
extrapolate because of:
 
• lack of pediatric and adolescent 
study populations;
 
• variations in injury definitions 
(eg, cessation of match, observed 
injury, reported injury, time loss 
injury);
 
• differences in study methods 
(competition injuries [more 
commonly studied] versus training 
injuries [less commonly studied]);
 
• accounting mostly for acute but not 
chronic injury;
 
• lack of consistency across studies 
in use of protective equipment; and
 
• lack of detailed, accurate, complete, 
or any reporting (recall bias, 
retrospective self-reporting, 
postmatch video recall). 
9, 
 
10
Most studies to date of martial arts 
comprise data largely from the 
adult population; however, when 
pediatric data were available, they 
were evaluated and are noted in this 
report.
In a cumulative epidemiologic study 
of pediatric martial arts, overall 
reported injury rates varied from 
41 to 133 injuries per 1000 athletic 
exposures. 
11 In a 2006 study, an 
estimated 128 400 children aged ≤17 
years (mean age, 12.1 years; 73% 
male) were treated in US emergency 
departments for martial arts–related 
injuries from 1990 to 2003, with 
most injuries attributable to karate 
(79.5%). 
2 Generally, martial arts 
injuries are not life-threatening 
(abrasions, contusion, sprains, 
and strains); however, fractures, 
neck injuries, dental injuries, and 
concussions do occur. 
2, 
 
11 Overall 
fracture rates of 10% and higher 
of all documented martial arts 
injuries have been described in 
multiple articles.2, 
 
11 
– 
13 Most reported 
pediatric martial arts injuries 
are acute. 
11 Free sparring during 
tournaments seems to cause many 
overall injuries in martial arts.14 The 
nature of the martial art (kicking, 
sparring, grappling, and takedowns) 
dictates the injury risk and rate. 
Very few catastrophic injuries are 
reported. 
11
Risk stratification in studies of 
martial arts does not show consistent 
results. Results are inconsistent as 
to whether age (younger versus 
older) and level (beginner versus 
professional/advanced) place an 
individual at increased or decreased 
risk for injury. 
11, 
 
14 
 
 
 
– 
20 A 2005 study 
spanning 5 martial arts disciplines 
(Shotokan karate, Aikido, taekwondo, 
kung fu, and tai chi) found that 
people 18 years or older were 4 
times more likely to sustain an injury 
compared with those younger than 
18 years and that competitors with 
at least 3 years of experience were 
2 times more likely to sustain injury 
compared with less experienced 
competitors. 
14 Participants younger 
than 18 years doubled their risk of 
injury with every 2 additional hours 
of training per week after the first 3 
hours, and those training for more 
than 3 hours per week had an overall 
increased injury risk.14, 
 
15 One study 
of children and adults participating 
in martial arts found that those 
younger than 10 years had an overall 
lower injury rate per 1000 athletic 
exposures compared with all other 
age groups; however, when adjusting 
for exposure time, the 10- to 14-year-
old age group had a higher injury risk 
per minute exposed compared with 
the open division. 
18 To what degree 
skill and age may help or harm 
athletes continues to be researched.
Sex stratification in studies 
also yields inconsistent 
results.

significant participation of female 
subjects in many of these studies, 
more research is needed.
Injuries specific to different martial 
art forms are detailed in the following 
sections. Not all disciplines are 
covered, because not all disciplines 
have been studied in detail, especially 
with children and adolescents. Of 
note, despite kicks to the head and 
takedowns naturally increasing 
the risk of head injury, concussion 
rates are not well accounted for 
in most martial arts studies. Using

 mostly tournament medical reports 
(no postinjury data or follow-up) 
and retrospective information, 
current studies may not accurately 
capture concussion injury rates. 
Many studies do not count technical 
knockouts (TKOs) as concussive head 
injuries. More research with better 
epidemiologic data and methods is 
necessary in this field.
KARATE
Defi
 nition
Karate is a stand-up and striking 
martial art that started in Okinawa, 
Japan. The basic goal is self-defense 
by using punches, kicks, knees, 
elbows, and open hands to block 
an opponent’s strikes and then to 
disable the opponent with quick 
strikes. 
8 When takedowns are 
executed, they tend to be used to set 
up finishing strikes. Weapons are 
used in most styles of karate.
Injury Risk
Because much karate practiced in 
the United States is noncontact in 
nature, injury rates are lower and 
usually less severe than in other 
martial art forms. In a study of 
karate participants younger than 18 
years, a reported injury risk over 
a 12-month time period of 5.6 per 
100 athletes was identified. 
15 One 
study reported a 30% rate of injury 
during 1 year of regular noncontact 
karate training. Karate focusing on 
technique just short of contact has 
been shown to have a lower injury 
risk compared with the contact kicks 
of taekwondo. 
14
The most common injuries 
sustained in karate include sprains/
strains, contusions/abrasions, 
and fractures. 
1, 
 
11, 
 
12, 
 
15 Karate 
injuries occur from being kicked 
(contusions), from falling (fractures), 
and from kicking (sprains).2, 
 
15 
Karate injuries commonly occur to 
the lower extremities from being 
kicked. Kicking injuries in less 
experienced individuals may occur 
when landing on bony prominences 
as a result of punches and kicks 
that miss their target. 
2 Free-style 
sparring (more common in younger 
athletes) accounts for fewer injuries 
than prearranged sparring. 
15 The 
head and face sustain injury resulting 
from kicking and punching, including 
epistaxis. 
11 Simultaneous executed 
punches are associated with karate 
injuries.
Other reported karate injuries to 
adolescents and adults include 
a blinding choroidal rupture, 
 
22 a 
unilateral adrenal gland hematoma, 
 
23 
a femoral osteochondral fracture, 
 
24 
and a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of 
the femoral artery.

TAEKWONDO
Defi
 nition
Taekwondo is a martial art and 
combat sport originating in Korea. 
The name taekwondo loosely 
translates into “the way of the 
hand and fist” and involves 80% 
kicks and 20% hand techniques. 
8 
Training involves a system of blocks, 
punches, and open-hand strikes 
and may include various takedowns 
or sweeps, throws, and joint locks, 
although it does not emphasize 
grappling. Sparring allows kicks to 
the head and requires use of soft 
head and body gear.
Injury Risk
Taekwondo uses contact aspects 
of punching and kicking, which is 
reflected in injury rates. Because of 
the various study methods, ages of 
study participants, and methods of 
reporting, as highlighted previously, 
reported injury rates for all ages 
range from 0.4 to 139.5 injures 
per 1000 athletic exposures, 
including light- and full-contact 
tournaments, 
 
2, 
 
11, 
 
16 spotlighting some 
of the variability, validation issues, 
and potential unreliability of various 
martial arts research. In 1 study, 
32% of taekwondo injuries (pediatric 
and adult) resulted in more than 1 
week of time lost from training. 
18 
Another study showed a threefold 
increased risk of injury and a higher 
risk of multiple injuries in taekwondo 
compared with karate.13 Of 5 martial 
arts disciplines (Shotokan karate, 
Aikido, taekwondo, kung fu, and 
tai chi), taekwondo had the highest 
number of injuries requiring time off 
from training (59%). 
14
Taekwondo has a high relative 
incidence of lower extremity injury 
compared with upper extremity 
injury because 80% of its competitive 
moves involve powerful, fast kicks. 
13 
Mechanisms for injury include being 
kicked, falling, and kicking. 
2 Kicks 
to the head and face are legal and 
serve as point-scoring techniques in 
full-contact taekwondo. 
10, 
 
18 Some 
protective equipment is used but not 
always hand or foot padding. Being 
kicked, specifically by roundhouse 
kicks, may cause the largest number 
of injuries.2, 
 
11, 
 
18
Common injuries sustained in 
taekwondo include sprains/
strains, fractures, and contusions/
abrasions. 
2, 
 
11, 
 
18, 
 
26 Lower extremity 
injuries, especially of the foot, occur 
frequently.2, 
 
11 
– 
13, 
 
18, 
27 Taekwondo 
participants had higher rates of 
bruising and soft tissue injury 
compared with karate athletes in 1 
study. 
13 Head injuries are commonly 
seen. 
11, 
 
26 One adult study found that 
82% of training injuries sustained 
in the preceding 12 months were 
mostly soft tissue injuries to the 
lower leg or foot; however, 1 in 20 
injuries were to the head, 
 
10 whereas 
another adult study supported the 
idea that more than 50% of adult 
injuries sustained in tournaments 
occurred to the head and neck area.26 
Although less frequent in overall 
number, upper extremity injuries 
in taekwondo may be more severe 
compared with lower extremity 
injuries. 
27
The incidence of concussion in 
adult taekwondo ranges from 4.6 to 
50.2 per 1000 athletic exposures, 
potentially up to 4 times higher than

27, 
 
28 One 
study of adult Olympic taekwondo 
kicks, measured by a simulated 
head target, reported that the 
most common kick impacts used 
in taekwondo had acceleration and 
recorded impacts equivalent to or 
greater than documented concussive 
injuries in American football. 
28 
Taekwondo rule changes have 
awarded more points for kicks aimed 
at the head, which may increase 
the risk of concussion. 
27 Ineffective 
blocking skills may be related to risk 
of severe head injuries.
Other reported taekwondo injuries 
include bilateral radial head 
fractures. 
29 Catastrophic taekwondo 
injuries have been reported, 
including deaths from kicks, cardiac 
issues, and unknown causes.

JUDO
Defi
 nition
Judo originated in Japan with 
an emphasis on throwing or 
taking opponents down by 
using their energy against them. 
8 
Although striking is allowed in 
form work, it is not allowed in 
sparring. Judo starts with a 
standing phase and then moves 
after a throw or takedown to the 
ground phase, in which opponents 
are immobilized and submission 
holds may be used.
Injury Risk
Judo uses takedowns, throws, and 
flips, which use more of the upper 
extremities than other martial arts, 
such as karate and taekwondo. 
Strains/sprains, contusions, and 
fractures are the most common 
injury. 
2, 
 
11, 
 
16 Upper extremity 
injuries to the shoulder, hand, wrist, 
and fingers are common. 
2, 
11 
Upper extremity injuries are more 
common in judo versus the lower 
extremity injuries seen more 
commonly in taekwondo and karate. 
2 
Hyperextension injury to joints 
may occur. 
11 Youth judo athletes 
sustained a higher proportion of 
shoulder/upper-arm injuries 
2, 
 
13 
and neck injuries compared with 
karate or taekwondo athletes.2 
Pediatric concussions were more 
prevalent in judo than karate. 
2 Judo 
choking techniques can cause loss of 
consciousness. 
30
In judo, athletes are more likely to 
be injured while being thrown or 
flipped versus karate and taekwondo, 
in which most injuries are sustained 
by being kicked. 
2, 
 
16 Improperly 
executed throws can injure both 
the attacker (if he or she drops the 
competitor onto himself or herself) 
or the defender (if he or she lands 
incorrectly). 
2 Falling is a common 
pediatric mechanism for injury 
leading to fractures. Joint-locking 
techniques, in which joints are locked 
in full extension and thus are less 
able to absorb stress during falls 
(raising the risk of dislocations, 
subluxation, and fractures), can cause 
injury. 
30 Other reported injuries 
sustained in judo include vertebral 
artery dissection, 
31 embolic stroke, 
 
32 
and Paget-Schroetter syndrome 
(effort thrombosis of upper 
extremity). 
33
MUAY THAI KICKBOXING
Defi
 nition
Muay Thai kickboxing originated in 
Thailand and is a close combat style 
of martial arts that uses kicking, 
punching (with boxing gloves), 
sparring, and kick blocks. 
2 Knee 
blows to the head or to the genital 
area are allowed in regular Muay 
Thai kickboxing, but modified 
competitive bouts prohibit any knee 
blows to the head.
Injury Risk
Muay Thai kickboxing, performed 
with different levels of protective 
equipment depending on the level, 
allows punches and kicks with 
knees and elbows specific for this 
discipline. 
20 Limited studies exist 
of this discipline. Injury rates tend 
to be higher in beginners compared 
with professionals (13.5 vs 2.79 
injuries per 1000 participants). 
19 
However, another study reported 
higher injury rates in heavier weight 
classes (except super heavyweight). 
20 
Commonly reported adult injuries 
include soft tissue trauma, fractures 
(higher in more experienced 
athletes), and sprains and strains 
(higher in less experienced 
athletes). 
19 Epistaxis (a nonprotected 
area) was the most frequent injury 
in 17- to 26-year-old competitors 
in 1 study.20 Vertebral artery 
dissection was reported in 
1 kickboxer. 
34
MIXED MARTIAL ARTS
Defi
 nition
MMA incorporates a variety of 
martial arts styles, from stand-up 
fighting, ground fighting, and 
throwing or takedowns, in which an 
opponent is forced from an upright 
or standing position into a grounded 
or more vulnerable position. 
Competitive bouts involve 3 to 5 
rounds of fighting, each lasting 3 to 
5 minutes. Contestants usually wear 
small gloves with exposed fingers 
and are barefoot. The goal of an MMA 
contestant is to defeat an opponent 
by:
 
• submission hold (joint lock or 
chokehold designed to make an 
opponent give up or risk injury/
become unconscious);
 
• frank submission, in which an 
opponent gives up either by 
tapping out (tapping hand or other 
body part on ground to signal 
intent not to continue) or verbal 
indication (opponent unable to 
continue or declares stoppage of 
match);
 
• knockout or TKO (referee stops 
match, judging that an opponent is 
unable to logically or safely defend 
himself or herself

36); or

match. 
36
Injury Risk
With no reported pediatric injury 
studies in the literature regarding 
MMA, all documented injury 
information is from professional 
adult matches. Overall risk of injury 
has been reported as 85.1 to 228.7 
per 1000 athletic exposures, 
 
37 
– 
39 
much higher than that reported in 
other contact sports, such as 
collegiate football (8.1 per 1000 
athletic exposures). 
40 In a 5-year 
review of sanctioned adult MMA 
fights, the injury risk over the 
reported 5 years was 23.6 per 100 
fight participants.38
Lacerations, abrasions, and altered 
mental state are reported as the 
most common injuries, 
 
21 but another 
study reported lacerations and 
upper-limb injuries (likely resulting 
from striking) as the most common 
injuries. 
38 One study reported 
injuries, in decreasing frequency, as 
head injuries, lacerations, fractures, 
and concussion. 
37
Because of the nature of MMA, head 
and neck injury is a concern. Many 
athletes who experience TKOs 
receive subsequent injuries from 
striking the floor with their head. 
36 
Definitions of what constitutes a 
concussion vary, and studies often 
miss trackable injuries, making 
extrapolation difficult. 
36
A recent study found that head 
injuries accounted for 67% to 78% 
of total injuries in MMA. 
37 In 1 study, 
the severe concussion rate was 
reported as 15.4 per 1000 athletic 
exposures (3% of all matches); 
however, only official ringside 
injuries documented by the ringside 
physician were reported, with no 
follow-up evaluations provided. 
38 In 
this study, 33.7% of matches ended 
by TKO, despite the small number 
of concussions reported. Blunt 
force to the head resulted in the 
highest number of match stoppages, 
suggesting a concussion rate of 48.3 
per 1000 athletic exposures in 1 
study. 
36 Video analysis reported that 
the rate of match-ending head trauma 
was 15.9 per 100 athletic exposures 
(31.9% of matches). 
41 All knockouts 
were attributable to direct head 
trauma, with 53.9% being strikes 
to the mandibular region. In the 30 
seconds before match stoppage, 
losers sustained an average of 18.5 
strikes, with 92.3% of them to the 
head. Cervical injury biomechanics 
from 4 common MMA takedown 
moves revealed biomechanics similar 
to being involved in a rear-end motor 
vehicle impact causing cervical spine 
injury.42
Age, weight, and fight experience did 
not statistically increase the injury 
risk in 1 study, 
 
38 but the rate of injury 
was 2 times higher in amateurs than 
professional fighters in another 
study. 
21 A losing fighter was 2.53 
times more likely to be injured than a 
winning fighter. 
38
Omohyoid muscle syndrome 
(insidious lateral neck protrusion) 
43 
and vertebral artery dissection 
44 
have been reported in athletes 
participating in MMA.
OTHER MARTIAL ARTS FORMS
Kung Fu
Developed in China, kung fu is 
primarily a striking form of martial 
arts that uses low stances and 
powerful blocks 
8 with both open 
and closed fists to defend against 
attackers. Some styles may allow 
throws and joint locks. Kung fu 
has both “hard” (meeting force 
with force) and “soft” (using an 
aggressor’s strength against him or 
her) techniques. Kung fu is widely 
known for its beautiful and flowing 
forms.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art 
based on a unique form of ground 
fighting in which participants are 
taught to fight from the supine 
position. Jiu-jitsu fighters look to take 
their opponents to the ground and 
then attempt to place submission 
holds, often using arm bars, throws, 
joint locks, and takedowns. 
8
Pankration
Pankration has origins in the ancient 
Olympic Games, and modern versions 
emphasize grappling as well as 
limited-contact and full-contact 
competitions. Class C (or grappling) 
competition can be performed by 
all age groups with takedowns, 
ground control, and submissions 
allowed, but matches cannot be won 
by brutality or deliberate intent to 
cause injury. Class B (or limited-
contact) competition also can be 
performed by all age groups and 
allows takedowns, ground control, 
submissions, and body strikes; 
strikes above the collarbone are 
not allowed. Participants wear soft 
gloves, helmets, and mouthguards. 
Head strikes are allowed in class A 
(full-contact) competition, which is 
limited to participants 18 years and 
older. 
45
INJURY-REDUCTION OR -PREVENTION 
TECHNIQUES
Headgear and Mouthguards
With many martial arts disciplines 
having participants deliberately 
target an opponent’s face with strikes 
and kicks, protective equipment such 
as mouthguards, eye/face protection, 
and soft headgear has been used 
to reduce the risk of head or facial 
trauma. There is a paucity of studies 
documenting injury risk reduction in 
martial arts that use these protective 
devices.
The use of soft or other protective 
headgear is intended to prevent 
or reduce the incidence of head 
injuries, such as facial/scalp trauma 
and activity-related concussions. 
Although the use of padded 
headgear probably helps to prevent 
minor abrasions, lacerations, and

 contusions, 
 
46 there is little evidence 
to support this contention. There 
is also a lack of data suggesting 
that the use of padded or other 
protective headgear can prevent or 
reduce the consequences of martial 
arts–related concussions. Sport-
related concussions are often the 
result of acceleration/deceleration 
and rotational forces placed on the 
head and neck region. 
47 Although 
unproven, there is also the potential 
that protective headgear in other 
sports may actually confer a higher 
risk of concussion because of a 
potentially perceived false sense of 
security for participants, parents, and 
instructors.
Mouthguards have been shown 
to reduce the incidence of dental 
trauma and other direct oral/facial 
injuries in other combat sports, 
such as boxing 
48; however, no solid 
evidence exists in the martial arts 
or in any other type of sport or 
activity that suggests a reduction in 
concussion incidence or severity with 
mouthguard use.
At the time of this writing, it cannot 
be recommended with any level 
of certainty that use of any type of 
protective headgear or mouthguard 
can reduce the risk of concussions 
during sparring or competitive 
martial arts participation. In addition, 
no protective device worn during 
MMA competitions can mitigate 
the potentially serious effects of 
chokeholds leading to near- or 
full suffocation, which could cause 
anoxic brain injury, cervical spine 
damage, or even vertebral artery 
injury, leading to cerebral vascular 
accidents. Additional research is 
needed to determine whether these 
theoretical concerns are encountered 
in young MMA participants and, if so, 
at what rates and levels of severity.
Many martial arts equipment 
companies manufacture clear 
plastic face guards or padded metal 
grilles that integrate into standard 
sparring headgear and do provide 
a significant level of eye and face 
protection. 
46 Currently, few martial 
arts participants wear this type of 
protection, and some may regard 
the equipment as a nuisance or 
impairment to their vision or 
breathing. There are no published 
studies evaluating the use of eye 
protection in the martial arts.
Body Padding
Several of the combat-oriented 
martial arts disciplines use soft 
padding for arms, chest, abdominal, 
groin, and leg regions. 
46 The padding 
worn by taekwondo athletes may 
offer some protection, but this 
protection may be of greatest benefit 
to the athlete executing the kick 
rather than to the recipient of the 
technique. 
14 Although, in theory, 
these devices may reduce skin 
trauma and muscle contusions, there 
are no data on their efficacy in the 
practice of martial arts.
Rule Changes
Although some studies have identified 
predisposing factors for injury that 
include male sex, exposure to sparring 
and competition, and less experience, 
rule changes that limit sparring in the 
latter group may have the greatest 
effect on injury reduction. 
49 However, 
other studies have found lower 
injury risks among less experienced 
youths, possibly because of less 
technical ability, lower body mass and 
strength, and an inability to generate 
the same level of force than older, 
more experienced martial artists. 
14 
Therefore, the exact role of rule 
changes limiting sparring remains 
uncertain.
Appropriate rule creation and 
enforcement have been shown to 
reduce injury risk. In 2000, the World 
Karate Federation adopted new 
rules regarding prohibited behavior, 
including excessive force used in 
dealing blows to permitted areas, to 
forbidden areas (throat, arms, legs, 
groin, joints, and instep), and to the 
face with open-hand techniques 
as well as dangerous or prohibited 
throwing techniques. Implementation 
of the new rules significantly 
lowered the relative risk of injury 
for competitors younger than 18 
years (male and female), as well as a 
significant overall decrease in head 
injuries; however, an increase in leg 
injuries was also established. 
17
Training Changes
One study involving video analysis of 
head blows leading to concussion in 
competitive taekwondo participants 
found that close proximity between 
athletes and reception of a single 
roundhouse kick were common 
mechanisms of injury. 
50 Another 
study found that young age and lack 
of blocking skills were risk factors 
for concussion in taekwondo. 
51 
Development of blocking skills, safety 
education, and rigorous enforcement 
of the competition rules were among 
the suggestions made to reduce 
risk of concussions in competitive 
taekwondo. 
50, 
 
51
Monitoring the number of martial 
arts training hours per week may 
play a role in reducing injuries. One 
study did not find multiple injuries 
or injuries requiring time away 
from activity in martial arts athletes 
younger than 18 years who trained 
less than 3 hours per week. Injury 
risk doubled with each additional 
2 hours of training after the first 3 
hours, although no major injuries 
were reported. 
14
Concussion Recognition and Safety
Although protective safety equipment 
may not protect against or prevent 
concussions, proper recognition, 
evaluation, management, and return 
to play of athletes with suspected and 
documented concussion injuries is 
important. All head injuries should 
be evaluated, clearly documented, 
and managed by a pediatrician or 
health care provider trained in 
the evaluation and management 
of pediatric concussions. Athletes 
recovering from a concussion should

MEDIA INFLUENCE, PERCEPTION, AND 
RELATION TO YOUTH PARTICIPATION 
IN MMA
Professional MMA has become a 
sports culture sensationalized by the 
media. Primetime, televised showcases 
promote MMA as spectator events, not 
unlike some other American sports, 
with financial incentives for both 
participants and sponsors. MMA draws 
attention as entertainment venues for 
many. Dreams of “making it big, 
” 
large paychecks, and future wealth 
appeal to many parents and children. 
In emulating what they see in the adult 
MMA culture, children are at risk for 
imitating professional MMA moves 
and techniques seen in mass media 
(eg, choking out, repetitive head blows 
to floor), even though these moves 
may not be sanctioned for their ages. 
Evidence also shows that exposure to 
media violence can increase aggressive 
behavior and desensitization to 
violence. 
53 Children may try to 
perform risky moves learned from 
mass media exposure in practice or 
in settings with minimal or no adult 
supervision. As advocates of young 
athletes, pediatricians and pediatric 
health care providers can educate 
parents, families, coaches, teachers, 
and community leaders with facts on 
the increased susceptibility to injury 
if children are imitating what they 
see from excessive media exposure of 
MMA contests.
PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS ON MARTIAL 
ARTS PARTICIPATION FOR THE 
PEDIATRIC PROVIDER
1. As a sport or activity, martial 
arts can provide children and 
adolescents with vigorous levels 
of physical exercise that can lead 
to better overall physical fitness.
2. Children and adolescents should 
only participate in martial 
arts classes or competitions 
supervised by instructors with 
appropriate training regarding 
proper teaching of the particular 
activity and understanding 
of a child’s limitations based 
on age, maturity, stature, 
and experience. Martial arts 
competition and contact-based 
training should be delayed until 
children and adolescents have 
demonstrated adequate physical 
and emotional maturity during 
noncontact preparation and have 
demonstrated competency with 
noncontact forms, movements, 
and techniques.
3. In discussing selection of various 
disciplines and subtypes of 
the martial arts, the pediatric 
health care provider can 
help to discriminate between 
noncontact forms, which have a 
relatively low risk of injury, and 
sparring or contact forms, which 
confer a higher risk of injury. 
4. For those martial arts 
disciplines that involve sparring, 
rigorous enforcement of 
rules prohibiting excessive 
force, dangerous movements, 
or blows to forbidden areas 
should be encouraged, with 
safety education promoted for 
all instructors, officials, and 
participants. Instructors and 
officials are encouraged to have 
an appropriate understanding 
of the rules and safety 
qualifications.
5. Although many martial arts 
disciplines require the use of 
soft protective headgear, there 
is no evidence that such devices 
reduce the risk of concussion. It 
is encouraged that participants 
and families also be counseled 
against engaging in more 
aggressive activities under the 
misconception that wearing 
headgear ensures increased 
protection against concussion.
6. Pediatric health care providers 
should encourage the teaching 
of improved defensive blocking 
techniques to reduce the risk of 
dangerous blows to the head.
7. Pediatric health care providers 
should support the institution 
of rule changes that eliminate 
blows to the head and conversely 
any points awarded for kicks or 
blows to the head to reduce the 
risk of concussions in martial 
arts.
8. Anticipatory guidance regarding 
injury risks of particular martial 
arts disciplines, along with 
proven and unproven benefits 
of protective equipment, 
are encouraged as part of a 
preparticipation evaluation 
by the pediatric health care 
provider.
9. Although some evidence exists 
that training >3 hours per week 
may increase injury risk, the 
relation of hours of training per 
week to particular martial arts 
injury risk requires more study.
10. The nature of MMA combat 
fighting, which includes rapid 
thrusts of the head to the floor 
and chokeholds to place an 
opponent into submission, 
confers a high risk of concussion, 
asphyxia, or other head and 
neck injury. As a result, child 
or adolescent participation in 
MMA bouts that involve these 
techniques should be strongly 
discouraged. As advocates of 
young athletes, pediatric health 
care providers can educate 
parents, families, coaches, 
teachers, and community leaders 
with facts on the increased 
susceptibility to injury if children 
are imitating what they see from 
excessive media exposure of 
MMA contests.
