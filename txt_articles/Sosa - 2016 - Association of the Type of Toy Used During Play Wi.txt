Association of the Type of Toy Used During Play With
the Quantity and Quality of Parent-Infant Communication
Anna V. Sosa, PhD
IMPORTANCE The early language environment of a child influences language outcome, which
in turn affects reading and academic success. It is unknown which types of everyday activities
promote the best language environment for children.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the type of toy used during play is associated with the
parent-infant communicative interaction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Controlled experiment in a natural environment of
parent-infant communication during play with 3 different toy sets. Participant recruitment
and data collection were conducted between February 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014. The
volunteer sample included 26 parent-infant (aged 10-16 months) dyads.
EXPOSURES Fifteen-minute in-home parent-infant play sessions with electronic toys,
traditional toys, and books.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Numbers of adult words, child vocalizations, conversational
turns, parent verbal responses to child utterances, and words produced by parents in
3 different semantic categories (content-specific words) per minute during play sessions.
RESULTS Among the 26 parent-infant dyads, toy type was associated with all outcome
measures. During play with electronic toys, there were fewer adult words (mean, 39.62;
95% CI, 33.36-45.65), fewer conversational turns (mean, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.12-2.19), fewer
parental responses (mean, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.87-1.77), and fewer productions of content-specific
words (mean, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.49-2.35) than during play with traditional toys or books.
Children vocalized less during play with electronic toys (mean per minute, 2.9; 95% CI,
2.16-3.69) than during play with books (mean per minute, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.09-4.68). Parents
produced fewer words during play with traditional toys (mean per minute, 55.56; 95% CI,
46.49-64.17) than during play with books (mean per minute, 66.89; 95% CI, 59.93-74.19) and
use of content-specific words was lower during play with traditional toys (mean per minute,
4.09; 95% CI, 3.26-4.99) than during play with books (mean per minute, 6.96; 95% CI,
6.07-7.97).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Play with electronic toys is associated with decreased
quantity and quality of language input compared with play with books or traditional toys. To
promote early language development, play with electronic toys should be discouraged.
Traditional toys may be a valuable alternative for parent-infant play time if book reading is not
a preferred activity.

V
ariation in early language development is in part de-
terminedbyachild’
slanguageenvironment.1Thequan-
tity of language input received from caregivers during
the first few years is positively associated with a child’
s lan-
guage accomplishments and this early advantage can have
long-lasting implications for overall academic success.2,3
Previous evidence suggests that in addition to the quantity of
language exposure, measures of interaction quality also influ-
ence language development.1 For example, maternal respon-
siveness and the number of adult-child conversations both
positively affect language development.4,5 Beyond family-
specificfactors,suchassocioeconomicstatusandparentaledu-
cation, little is known about everyday activities that may pro-
mote both the quantity and quality of communicative
interactions between parents and young children. Television
exposure, book reading, and independent and guided play are
activitiesthathavebeeninvestigated.Televisionexposurewas
found to be associated with decreased quantity and quality of
parental language input, and media viewing by children
younger than 2 years has been shown to negatively affect lan-
guage development, likely because media use displaces other
more beneficial language-promoting interactions.6-8 On the
otherhand,bookreadingandplayingtogetherwithyoungchil-
dren are often recommended as activities that boost lan-
guage development. Clinic-based programs, such as Reach Out
and Read, that distribute books to impoverished families have
been shown to improve language ability, and a variety of dif-
ferent play activities, including early symbolic play and block
play, have been linked to better language ability in toddlers.9-12
Based on these and other findings, the American Academy of
Pediatrics discourages media use by children younger than 2
yearsandemphasizestheimportanceofbookreadingandother
typesofparent-childplaytime.13However,therealityformany
families of young children is that opportunities for direct par-
ent-child play time is limited owing to financial, work, and
other familial factors. Thus, optimizing the quality of limited
parent-child play time is imperative.
At the same time that parents are being encouraged to read
to their young children and engage in direct parent-infant play,
they are also bombarded with advertisements for “educa-
tional” toys that claim to promote language development in
very young children, including infants. These toys are typi-
cally battery-operated electronic toys with buttons that pro-
duce lights, sounds, music, words, and phrases when acti-
vated. Other options parents have when selecting toys for their
very young children are traditional nonelectronic toys, includ-
ing blocks, puzzles, and stacking cups, as well as toys that en-
courage symbolic play such as dolls and tea sets. Primary care
professionals and pediatricians working with families of young
children may be called on to provide recommendations re-
garding selection of toys for infants and toddlers, particularly
for those children and parents for whom reading may not be a
preferred activity.
The purpose of this controlled experiment was to deter-
mine whether the type of toy used during parent-child play
time influences the quantity and quality of the communica-
tive interaction in ways that are known to be associated with
better language development.
Methods
My research team and I conducted a controlled experiment
using observational measures of a volunteer community
sample of parent-infant dyads recruited through posting of fly-
ers in public places frequented by parents of young children
inFlagstaff,Arizona,amidsizedcityinthesouthwesternUnited
States. Enrollment and data collection occurred over a 16-
month period between February 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014.
Allprocedureswereapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboard
at Northern Arizona University. Written informed consent was
obtained from parents.
Participants
Pairs of parents (mother or father) and infants (aged 10-16
months) were eligible. Parent-infant dyads were excluded if
the participating parent did not use English as the primary lan-
guage with the child. Because race/ethnicity and socioeco-
nomic status may affect parent-child communication, this in-
formation was collected via parent report using a written
questionnaire with set categories for race/ethnicity and ma-
ternal education level.
Data Collection
To maximize the ecological validity of study findings, partici-
pants engaged in study procedures in their own homes with-
out being directly observed by researchers. On enrollment in
the study, audio recording equipment, 3 sets of toys, and study
paperworkweredeliveredtoparticipants.Therecordingequip-
ment used was the LENA Pro System (Language Environ-
mentAnalysis;LENAFoundation).Thesystemincludesasmall
digital recording device called a digital language processor that
is placed in a pocket in a vest worn by the child. The proces-
sor records up to 16 hours of recorded sound and is worn con-
tinuously by the child for at least 10 hours. The accompany-
ing LENA software conducts automatic analyses of the
recordings and generates estimates of the amount of speech
produced by adults in the child’
s environment, the number of
child vocalizations, the number of adult-child conversational
turns, and the amount of exposure to electronic noise (eg, tele-
vision).Thealgorithmsusedtogeneratetheseautomaticanaly-
ses are designed to calculate estimates over an extended re-

At a Glance
• To promote language development, parents are encouraged to
read to their infants and spend time playing 1 on 1, but little is
known about how different types of play activities affect
parent-infant communication.
• In the present study, play with books and traditional toys was
superior to play with electronic toys in promoting high-quality
communication.
• Children vocalized less during play with electronic toys than
during play with books.
• Because play with electronic toys is associated with decreased
quantity and quality of language input, it should be discouraged
to promote early language development.

For that reason, the automatic analyses were used to obtain
general information about the language environment of each
child but were not used in data analysis for the main research
questions.
Each dyad engaged in 2 15-minute play sessions per toy set
over a 3-day period, resulting in 30 minutes of play per day.
Participants were given a daily log indicating which toy set to
play with each day and in which order. To minimize potential
order effects, 6 different daily logs were generated, each rep-
resenting a different presentation order. As participants were
enrolled, they were assigned a daily log-in sequential order
(from 1 to 6 and then starting again at 1). All but 1 participant
followed the order presented on their daily log; this partici-
pant did only 1 play session on the first day and 3 play ses-
sions on the second day. Participants were instructed to en-
gage in play sessions at their convenience during the day and
play sessions did not need to be back to back. Parents were in-
structed to play as they usually do with their child and were
not explicitly told to minimize distractions (eg, presence of sib-
lings, pets, and television). Start and stop times for each play
session were recorded by the parent on the daily log so that
they could be found easily on the audio recordings for coding
and analysis.
Toy Sets
All toys were selected based on their potential to elicit speech
centered on 3 semantic themes: animal names, colors, and
shapes. The electronic toy set consisted of 3 battery-operated
toyswithbuttonsandswitchesthatcanbemanipulatedtopro-
duce lights, words, phrases, and songs. The electronic toys in-
cluded a baby laptop, a talking farm, and a baby cell phone.
These 3 toys were selected because they are marketed as edu-
cational toys that promote language development for chil-
dren in this age range and are advertised as teaching animal
names, colors, and shapes. The traditional toy set consisted
of3nonelectronictoysthatalsohavethepotentialtoteachani-
mal names, colors, and shapes. These traditional toys in-
cluded a farm animal chunky wooden puzzle, a shape-sorter
with 10 pieces representing 5 different shapes and 5 different
colors, and a set of 10 small multicolored rubber blocks with
pictures of animals and common objects on each side. The
books toy set consisted of 5 board books: 2 with a farm ani-
mal theme, 2 with a shape theme, and 1 with a color theme.
Three of the books included lift-the-flap opportunities.
Outcome Variables
Each play session was transcribed by a research assistant and
coded for the variables of interest: (1) number of adult words,
(2) number of content-specific words, (3) number of child vo-
calizations, (4) number of conversational turns, and (5) num-
ber of parent responses per minute. These measures were op-
erationally defined as follows. An adult word was any word
produced by the parent during the play session. Words pro-
duced by other adults who may have been present in the in-
teractionwerenotincludedintheadultwordscount.Acontent-
specific word was a word produced by the parent that was in
1ofthe3semanticcategoriesthatthetoyswereselectedtoelicit
(ie, animal names, colors, and shapes). Child vocalization was
a speechlike utterance consisting of, at minimum, a voiced
vowel. Non-speechlike utterances, such as cries, grunts, and
laughs, were not coded as child vocalizations. A conversa-
tional turn was a speechlike utterance by either the parent or
the infant that occurred within 5 seconds of an immediately
preceding utterance by the other speaker. Parent response
was a speechlike response by the parent that occurred within
5 seconds of an immediately preceding child vocalization. A
parent utterance was only counted as a parent response if
it was determined to be a direct response to the preceding
child utterance; a parent utterance that occurred within the
5-second window but was judged to be unrelated to the pre-
vious child vocalization and not prompted by the child vocal-
ization (eg, speaking to a pet or other adult) was not counted
as a parent response. The conversational turn measure is a
purely quantitative measure of back-and-forth vocal interac-
tions between infant and parent while parent response mea-
sures direct parental verbal responsiveness to a child’
s vocal-
ization. Per-minute counts for each outcome variable were
averaged across the 2 play sessions with each toy set; this
average per-minute count was used for all analyses. Reliabil-
ity coding was conducted by a second research assistant for
all of the play sessions for 15 of the participants.
Statistical Analysis
Pearson-product moment correlations were calculated
between coder 1 and coder 2 results for each outcome vari-
able in each toy condition. Intercoder agreement was very
high for all outcome variables in all conditions (overall
r = 0.981; range, 0.925-0.999). Coders could not be blinded
to the condition because the toy set was identifiable by lis-
tening to the play session.
My research team and I analyzed the data using repeated
measures analysis of variance for each of the 5 outcome vari-
ables, with the toy set as the within-participants factor. This
design allows each dyad to serve as its own control, thereby
eliminating the influence of dyad-specific factors that may in-
fluence the general quality of the parent-infant communica-
tion interaction (eg, age of the child, developmental level of
the child, and socioeconomic status of the family). We used
post hoc analyses to explore differences in outcome mea-
sures between individual toy sets.
Results
Thirty-seven parent-infant dyads were enrolled in the study.
Seven participants were not home at the scheduled material
delivery time and 4 did not complete all study procedures, re-
sulting in useable data from 26 parent-infant dyads. Twenty-
five parent participants were biological mothers and 1 parent
participant was the biological father. Two children were born
prematurely and were identified with moderate developmen-
tal delay; parents of the other children reported no develop-
mental concerns. The sex of the child, age of the child, race/
ethnicity of the child, and maternal education are presented
in Table 1. Demographic data from the 7 families who were not
home at the delivery time are not available. Of the 4 families

Average per-minute counts with 95% CIs for each out-

portedinTable2alongwithrepeated-measuresanalysisofvari-
ance P values. Main effects of condition were statistically
significant for all outcome variables. My research team and I
conducted post hoc analyses for each outcome variable to ex-
amine significant differences for the 3 possible toy set con-
trasts (ie, electronic vs traditional, traditional vs books, and
books vs electronic); Bonferroni-adjusted P values for each
2-way contrast are reported in Table 3.
During play with electronic toys, there were fewer adult
words (mean, 39.62; 95% CI, 33.36-45.65), fewer conversa-
tional turns (mean, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.12-2.19), fewer parental re-

Children vocalized less during play with electronic toys (mean
per minute, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.16-3.69) than during play with books
(mean per minute, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.09-4.68). Parents pro-
duced fewer words during play with traditional toys (mean per

during play with books (mean per minute, 6.96; 95% CI,

Results showed that the largest and most consistent dif-
ferences were between electronic toys and books (with greater
valuesforallmeasureswithbooks),followedbyelectronictoys
and traditional toys (with larger values in the traditional toy
condition for all measures except child vocalization), and the

research team and I found that the type of toy used during
the play session was significantly associated with both the
quantity and quality of language use. For all outcome mea-
sures, play with books provided a better communication
interaction than play with electronic toys. The effect was
most pronounced for the quantitative measures of parental
language use, suggesting that parents tend to let the toys do
the talking for them when their child is interacting with elec-
tronic toys. This is particularly worrisome given that there
is no evidence that children this young are able to learn
vocabulary from media or other nonhuman interactions.14,15
For the 2 qualitative measures of parent-infant interaction,
conversational turns and parental responses, play with tradi-
tional toys was equivalent to book reading, yet both were
superior to play with electronic toys. While play with books
may provide a script that encourages parents to talk more
and produce more words associated with the themes in the
books, it was not superior to play with traditional toys in
promoting parent-child conversations and parental respon-
siveness. For parents who may not be inclined to read to
their preverbal infants or for parents whose children do not
prefer book reading activities, play with traditional toys,
such as blocks and shape sorters, may be an equally valuable
use of limited parent-infant play time. This is consistent
with and may help explain results of previous work that
found that distribution of blocks to families of young chil-
dren resulted in better child language ability.12
Whiletheresultsofthisstudyarerobustgiventhattheplay
sessionswereconductedintheparticipants’homesratherthan
in a controlled laboratory setting, there are important limita-
tions that should be taken into account. The most notable limi-
tations were the small sample size and the relative homoge-
neity of participants by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic
status. Given the robustness of the results despite the small
samplesize,however,itislikelythatthefindingswouldberep-
licated with a larger group of participants. The question of
whether results would differ for families from more diverse
demographic backgrounds is an important one that remains
to be answered. Given that cultural and socioeconomic fac-
tors are known to influence both the amount of time spent en-
gaged in parent-child play and the nature of the play interac-
tion, it is important to acknowledge that the effect of toy type
on parent-infant communication may be different for par-
ents from different cultural and economic backgrounds.16-18
Furthermore, the findings of this study are applicable to chil-
dren in a very limited age range of prelinguistic and very early
language development and effects may be different for older
toddlers and preschoolers. Another limitation is that investi-
gators did not have complete control over the timing of the
play sessions and it is possible that participants may have
chosen to play with certain toy sets when either the parent or
child was more tired, thereby impacting the communicative
interaction.
Despite these limitations, the results provide an empiri-
cal basis for primary care professionals and pediatricians for
making recommendations regarding the types of play activi-
ties that promote rich language interactions.
Conclusions
These results provide a basis for discouraging the purchase of
electronic toys that are promoted as educational and are of-
ten quite expensive. These results also add to the large body
of evidence supporting the potential benefits of book reading
with very young children. They also expand on this by dem-
onstrating that play with traditional toys may result in com-
municative interactions that are as rich as those that occur dur-
ingbookreading.Idonotclaimthatbookreadingandplaywith
traditionaltoysaredevelopmentallyequivalentactivities;book
reading provides numerous benefits that cannot be repli-
cated in other activities (eg, literacy socialization and expo-
suretonovelvocabularyandconcepts)andplaywithtoys,such
as blocks and puzzles, provides developmental and cognitive
benefits beyond the language domain.19-22 However, if the em-
phasis is on activities that promote a rich communicative in-
teraction between parents and infants, both play with tradi-
tional toys and book reading can be promoted as language-
facilitating activities while play with electronic toys should be
discouraged.
