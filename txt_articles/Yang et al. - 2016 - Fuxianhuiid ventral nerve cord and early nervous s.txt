Panarthropods are typified by disparate grades of neurological
organization reflecting a complex evolutionary history. The fossil
record offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct early character
evolution of the nervous system via exceptional preservation in
extinct representatives. Here we describe the neurological archi-
tecture of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the upper-stem group
euarthropod Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis from the early Cam-
brian Xiaoshiba Lagerstätte (South China). The VNC of C. kunmin-
gensis comprises a homonymous series of condensed ganglia that
extend throughout the body, each associated with a pair of bi-
ramous limbs. Submillimetric preservation reveals numerous seg-
mental and intersegmental nerve roots emerging from both sides
of the VNC, which correspond topologically to the peripheral
nerves of extant Priapulida and Onychophora. The fuxianhuiid
VNC indicates that ancestral neurological features of Ecdysozoa
persisted into derived members of stem-group Euarthropoda but
were later lost in crown-group representatives. These findings il-
luminate the VNC ground pattern in Panarthropoda and suggest
the independent secondary loss of cycloneuralian-like neurological
characters in Tardigrada and Euarthropoda.

T
he nervous system represents a critical source of phylogenetic
information and has been used extensively for exploring the
evolutionary relationships of extant Panarthropoda (i.e., Ony-
chophora, Tardigrada, Euarthropoda) (1–7). Identification of
fossilized nervous tissues has provided a unique perspective on
early euarthropod brain neuroanatomy and suggests that broad
patterns of extant neurological diversity were already in place by
the Cambrian (8–11). The ventral nerve cord (VNC) reflects
fundamental aspects of panarthropod body organization that
complement the organization of the brain and together illuminate
the evolution of the CNS (1–3, 5, 7, 12–16). The early evolutionary
history of the panarthropod postcephalic CNS, however, remains
obscure due to the exclusive preservation of brains in most available
fossils (8, 10, 11). Moreover, the unresolved phylogenetic relation-
ships within Panarthropoda complicate accurate reconstruction of
the CNS ground pattern (16–22). In this study, we demonstrate the
exceptional preservation of postcephalic neurological features in the
early Cambrian fuxianhuiid Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis, an up-
per stem-group euarthropod (17) from the Xiaoshiba Lagerstätte,
South China (23). These fossils clarify the neurological organization
of the VNC in early euarthropod ancestors, thereby polarizing the
evolution of the panarthropod CNS.
Results
Five individuals of C. kunmingensis display a narrow (maximum
width, ∼170 μm) and slightly convex rope-like structure with a
metameric pattern that extends medially throughout the body
(Figs. 1 and 2, Figs. S1 and S2, and Table S1); its segmental
organization and position at the ventral midline identifies this
feature as the VNC. This interpretation is supported by com-
parisons with other preserved components of the internal anat-
omy. For instance, the VNC can be readily distinguished from
the digestive tract of C. kunmingensis, which is expressed as a
comparatively larger (maximum width, ∼860 μm) but fully
compressed, linear structure running almost the entire length of
the animal (23, figure 1 d and e). The VNC extends from at least
the five anteriormost reduced trunk tergites (i.e., dorsal exo-
skeletal plates) to tergite T23 at the posterior end of the trunk
(Figs. 1 and 2 and Figs. S1, S2, and S3). Although the VNC
would have continued into the head region in life, our material
does not preserve any anterior neurological structures that have
been previously identified as the dorsal brain or nerves leading to
the antennae and specialized postantennal appendages (8). The
absence of fossilized brains in these otherwise exceptionally
preserved specimens can be attributed to the small sample size
and moderate postmortem disarticulation; likewise, other studies
addressing neurological structures in Cambrian fossils rarely
report the CNS preserved in its entirety (8–11). The VNC also
expresses a distinctive dark/light color banding throughout its
length, with the dark bands varying from black to reddish-brown
Significance
Understanding the evolution of the CNS is fundamental for
resolving the phylogenetic relationships within Panarthropoda
(Euarthropoda, Tardigrada, Onychophora). The ground pattern
of the panarthropod CNS remains elusive, however, as there is
uncertainty on which neurological characters can be regarded
as ancestral among extant phyla. Here we describe the ventral
nerve cord (VNC) in Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis, an early
Cambrian euarthropod from South China. The VNC reveals
extraordinary detail, including condensed ganglia and regu-
larly spaced nerve roots that correspond topologically to the
peripheral nerves of Priapulida and Onychophora. Our findings
demonstrate the persistence of ancestral neurological features
of Ecdysozoa in early euarthropods and help to reconstruct the
VNC ground pattern in Panarthropoda.

 between specimens (Figs. 1 and 2 and Figs. S1 and S2C); this
variability in color reflects differences in the extent of weathering
between individual specimens. Raman spectroscopy indicates the
presence of residual organic carbon associated with the dark-
colored bands (Fig. S4) but not in the light ones, likely mirroring
differences in their original histology and early diagenesis. In
addition to the carbonaceous films, the VNC is typified by
modest relief relative to adjacent exoskeletal features, attesting
to a degree of early diagenetic permineralization before com-
plete degradational collapse (24).
Neurologically, the C. kunmingensis VNC consists of an
interconnected series of separate metameric ganglia (dark col-
ored bands) (Figs. 1 and 2 and Figs. S1 and S3). Longitudinal
connectives are not morphologically discrete, but their presence
is strongly suggested by the alternating light colored bands be-
tween the condensed ganglia. The distinct preservation style of
these neurological structures likely stems from differences in
their original histology; whereas the condensed ganglia are
enriched in lipids due to the presence of abundant somata, the
connectives consist of neurites and lack cell bodies (1, 3–5). The
ganglia have an elongate subelliptic outline (maximum length,
∼600 μm; 3.5:1 length/width) and are roughly three times longer
than the connectives (maximum length, ∼206 μm). The ganglia
remain separate throughout the entire VNC, with no indication
of fusion or specialization. There is a progressive reduction in
the size of individual ganglia along the body, with the anterior-
most being ∼3 times longer and 1.5 times wider than the pos-
terior ones (Fig. 1 C and D). The preserved proximal portions of
the trunk endopods indicate that each ganglion was associated
with a single pair of biramous appendages (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2 A
and B), which, like the ganglia, become progressively smaller
posteriorly (Fig. 1D). As such, each of the five anteriormost
reduced tergites (Fig. 1A) correlates with an individual ganglion
and leg pair, whereas the comparatively larger tergites T6–T26
overlie up to four ganglia and their corresponding appendages
(Fig. 1D and Figs. S2 A and B and S3). This organization reflects
the notable dorsoventral segmental mismatch that typifies the
fuxianhuiid trunk (23, 25).
The unique disarticulation pattern of the head shield in the
Xiaoshiba fuxianhuiids (23)—aided by mechanical preparation—
reveals submillimetric neurological detail in C. kunmingensis.
In specimen YKLP 12026, the exposed VNC extends from the
oral region into tergite T6, comprising a total of seven ganglia
(Fig. 2 A–C and Fig. S1). Close inspection reveals the presence
of delicate nerve roots (maximum length, ∼209 μm; width, 9 μm)
emerging at both sides of the VNC. These nerve roots are

 regularly spaced (∼17–20 μm) and originate from both the
ganglia (i.e., segmental) and interganglia connectives (i.e., in-
tersegmental) at acute angles (∼40–60°) relative to the VNC
(Fig. 2 C–E and Figs. S1 B and C and S3). The emergent chev-
ron-like pattern most likely resulted from moderate postmortem
displacement of the distal portions of the peripheral nerves rel-
ative to the VNC. There are at least a dozen paired sets of roots
associated with each ganglion and four to six nerve roots asso-
ciated with the longitudinal connectives. Preferential preserva-
tion of the proximal bases of the nerve roots precludes the
identification of precise relationships between these structures
and the exoskeletal morphology, such as the walking legs. The
lack of distal neurological preservation suggests that, similarly to
3D guts in Burgess Shale fossils (24), the VNC and the proximal
nerve roots were permineralized during early diagenesis due to
the chemically reactive composition of adjacent lipid-rich ganglia
(8). Fluorescence microscopy corroborates the anatomical and
compositional continuity of the regularly spaced nerve roots and
VNC throughout the body (Fig. 2 C and E and Dataset S1).
Discussion
The Xiaoshiba fossils provide previously unidentified insights on
the neurological diversity of Cambrian euarthropods. Within the
context of extant representatives, the postcephalic CNS of
C. kunmingensis exhibits notable similarities with the thoracic
VNC of the notostracan Triops cancriformis, which consists of a
homonymous series of separate ganglia linked by short connec-
tives that become progressively smaller toward the posterior end
(1, 3). The overall morphology of T. cancriformis further re-
sembles C. kunmingensis—and generally other fuxianhuiids—in
the presence of dorsoventral trunk segmental mismatch
expressed as appendage polypody (23, 25, 26). A similarly un-
specialized VNC is also found in crustaceans typified by a trunk
region with undifferentiated limb-bearing segments, such as the
remipedes (5, 7) (Fig. S5C). Unlike C. kunmingensis and
T. cancriformis, however, the body organization of remipedes
does not evince any type of trunk segmental mismatch. Thus, the
paleoneurological data available indicate that the fuxianhuiid
CNS combines a relatively simple VNC without signs of func-
tional specialization (Figs. 1–3) with a tripartite brain bearing
both olfactory and optic lobes (8). Considering the position of
fuxianhuiids within upper-stem Euarthropoda (17), this char-
acter combination could suggest the evolutionary convergence of
either the VNC of Chengjiangocaris with Branchiopoda or the
complex brain of Fuxianhuia with Malacostraca. Alternatively,
the fuxianhuiid CNS may approximate the complex brain (sans

between peripheral and leg nerve roots, the presence of a single pair of leg nerves (lgn) in C. kunmingensis is hypothetical (dashed lines) and based on the

 optic lobes) and unspecialized VNC of remipedes (5, 7). If the
neurological organization of fuxianhuiids reflects an ancestral
condition as suggested by their phylogenetic position, it would
support the symplesiomorphic nature of a malacostracan-like
brain for Pancrustacea/Tetraconata (6, 8) and also imply an in-
dependent increase in VNC complexity among extant crustacean
lineages. However, the lack of consensus pertaining to the phylo-
genetic placement of Branchiopoda, Remipedia, and Malacostraca
relative to Hexapoda based on molecular and neuromophological
data (5–7, 27) complicates deciding between these hypotheses based
on the available paleoneurological information.
The neurological organization of the fuxianhuiid VNC leads to
more informative comparisons with other panarthropod groups.
Apart from Euarthropoda (1–5, 9), the presence of segmental
ganglia is also characteristic of the CNS in Tardigrada (18, 28)
(Fig. S5B) and has been used to advocate the sister-group re-
lationship between these clades (16, 17, 20). Thus, the presence
of segmental ganglia in C. kunmingensis provides a minimum
phylogenetic threshold for the evolution of this feature in total-
group Euarthropoda (SI Text).
At a broader phylogenetic level, the neurological organization
of C. kunmingensis also exhibits marked similarities with the
VNC of Onychophora (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5A), namely the pres-
ence of numerous regularly spaced peripheral nerve roots
(12–15, 29, 30). A major difference, however, is that the ony-
chophoran postcephalic CNS is lateralized and lacks morpho-
logically discrete segmental ganglia despite clearly having a
segmented organization (SI Text). Although the proximal preser-
vation of the peripheral nerves makes it uncertain whether the
C. kunmingensis VNC possessed complete ring commissures like
those in onychophorans (12–14), this feature could potentially add
morphological support for the sister-group relationship between
Euarthropoda and Onychophora suggested by molecular phylog-
enies (21, 22). Among crown-group euarthropods, there are only a
restricted number of intersegmental peripheral nerves emerging
from the longitudinal connectives in the VNC of some pan-
crustaceans (1, 4, 5) (SI Text, Fig. 3, and Fig. S5 C and D). Alter-
natively, it is possible that the presence of numerous peripheral
nerves in the VNC of C. kunmingensis and Onychophora is sym-
plesiomorphic, as comparable structures are also found in the or-
thogonal CNS of Priapulida (31) and other protostomes (12, 13, 15).
In any event, the postcephalic CNS of C. kunmingensis reveals a
unique combination of neurological characters otherwise unknown
in any extant group within Panarthropoda (Fig. S3).
To test these different hypotheses and to clarify the polarity of
neurological characters in extant and extinct groups, we per-
formed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis incorporating the
available fossil data on the postcephalic CNS of total-group
Panarthropoda (SI Text and Dataset S2). The results support the
sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda
(Fig. 3 and Figs. S6 and S7), corroborated by several unambig-
uous synapomorphies of the VNC. These synapomorphies in-
clude the presence of condensed segmental ganglia connected by
commissures, the anterior shift of the leg nerves following a
parasegmental organization, and the presence of a stomatogas-
tric ganglion associated with the tritocerebral segment (SI Text)
(14, 16, 18, 19, 28). In this context, the presence of numerous
segmental and intersegmental peripheral nerves in C. kunmin-
gensis (Fig. 2 B–E) is recognized as an ancestral condition that
persisted in derived members of upper stem-group Euar-
thropoda (SI Text). Among extant groups, homologs of the in-
tersegmental peripheral nerves are expressed in both Priapulida
(31) and Onychophora (12, 13, 15, 29) but are otherwise greatly
reduced in number or completely lost in crown-group Euar-
thropoda and Tardigrada, respectively (1, 5, 16, 28) (Fig. S5); the
secondary reduction/loss is recognized as a result of parallel
evolution between these lineages. The phylogenetic analysis also
indicates that several neurological characters shared between
Onychophora and Tardigrada are actually symplesiomorphic and
likely reflect the broader ground pattern of Panarthropoda (Fig. 3);
these include the median interpedal commissures, an orthogonal-
like organization, and paired segmental leg nerves (SI Text). A
lateralized VNC is resolved as synapomorphic for Onychophora
(SI Text). Taken together, these findings argue against the sec-
ondary loss of morphologically discrete segmental ganglia in the
VNC of Onychophora (30). By contrast, the evolution of the
VNC in crown-group Euarthropoda is the result of secondary
simplification relative to the CNS of cycloneuralians and other
panarthropods, as informed by the transitional neurological or-
ganization of C. kunmingensis (Fig. 3).
The integration of paleoneurological data with the present un-
derstanding of the developmental biology of extant groups illumi-
nates major issues pertaining the evolution of the nervous system
in Panarthropoda. Our results indicate that the ground pattern of
the panarthropod postcephalic CNS incorporates a paired, but not
lateralized, VNC with median interpedal commissures, an or-
thogonal organization with complete ring-commissures, paired leg
nerves, and intersegmental peripheral nerves (SI Text); in this
context, an orthogonal VNC with complete ring commissures is a
symplesiomorphy inherited from a cycloneuralian-like ancestor.
The presence of condensed segmental ganglia, a lateralized or-
ganization, anteriorly displaced leg nerves following the para-
segments, and a stomatogastric ganglion (SI Text) (Fig. 3), represent
derived features that were acquired later in the evolutionary
history of the different panarthropod phyla.
Methods
All of the described material is deposited at the Key Laboratory for Paleo-
biology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (YKLP).
Imaging. Fossils were photographed with a Nikon D3X fitted with a Nikon
AF-S Micro Nikkor 105-mm lens. For close-up images, a LEICA M205-C stereo-
microscope fitted with a Leica DFC 500 digital camera was used under di-
rectional illumination provided by a LEICA LED5000 MCITM. Geochemical
analyses were performed with an inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw).
Fluorescence photography was performed as described in ref. 32.
Phylogenetic Analysis. The data matrix includes 50 taxa and 95 characters
(Dataset S2 and SI Text). The analysis was run in TNT (33) under New Tech-
nology Search, using Driven Search with Sectorial Search, Ratchet, Drift, and
Tree fusing options activated in standard settings (34, 35). The analysis was
set to find the minimum tree length 100 times and to collapse trees after
each search. All characters were treated as unordered. For an initial analysis,
all characters were treated as equally weighted (Fig. S6A); subsequent rep-
etitions with variable concavity values (k) were used to explore the effect of
different degrees of homoplasy penalization to test the robustness of the
dataset (Fig. S6 B–D) (36).
