Summary
Background Global and regional prevalence estimates for blindness and vision impairment are important for the 
development of public health policies. We aimed to provide global estimates, trends, and projections of global 
blindness and vision impairment.
Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based datasets relevant to global vision 
impairment and blindness that were published between 1980 and 2015. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate the 
prevalence (by age, country, and sex), in 2015, of mild visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 to 
6/18 inclusive), moderate to severe visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive), 
blindness (presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60), and functional presbyopia (defined as presenting near vision 
worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm when best-corrected distance visual acuity was better than 6/12).
Findings Globally, of the 7·33 billion people alive in 2015, an estimated 36·0 million (80% uncertainty interval [UI] 
12·9–65·4) were blind (crude prevalence 0·48%; 80% UI 0·17–0·87; 56% female), 216·6 million (80% UI 
98·5–359·1) people had moderate to severe visual impairment (2·95%, 80% UI 1·34–4·89; 55% female), and 
188·5 million (80% UI 64·5–350·2) had mild visual impairment (2·57%, 80% UI 0·88–4·77; 54% female). 
Functional presbyopia affected an estimated 1094·7 million (80% UI 581·1–1686·5) people aged 35 years and 
older, with 666·7 million (80% UI 364·9–997·6) being aged 50 years or older. The estimated number of blind 
people increased by 17·6%, from 30·6 million (80% UI 9·9–57·3) in 1990 to 36·0 million (80% UI 12·9–65·4) 
in 2015. This change was attributable to three factors, namely an increase because of population growth (38·4%), 
population ageing after accounting for population growth (34·6%), and reduction in age-specific 
prevalence (–36·7%). The number of people with moderate and severe visual impairment also increased, from 
159·9 million (80% UI 68·3–270·0) in 1990 to 216·6 million (80% UI 98·5–359·1) in 2015.
Interpretation There is an ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and visual impairment, 
yet the growth and ageing of the world’s population is causing a substantial increase in number of people affected. 
These observations, plus a very large contribution from uncorrected presbyopia, highlight the need to scale up vision 
impairment alleviation efforts at all levels.

Introduction
Universal Eye Health: a Global Action Plan 2014–2019 
was adopted by WHO member states at the World Health 
Assembly in 2013.1 Its goals are to reduce vision 
impairment as a global public health problem and to 
secure access to rehabilitation for people with vision 
impairment. The initiative has the global target of 
reducing the prevalence of avoidable vision impairment 
by 25% from 2010 to 2019. One of the key objectives of 
the Global Action Plan is to generate evidence on the 
magnitude of vision impairment, which is required to 
evaluate the success of this and similar initiatives.
Previously, we reported the results of a systematic 
review of published literature and some unpublished 
data from population-based studies that reported the 
prevalence of blindness and vision impairment from 
1980, using a continuously updated database of 
population-based studies (the Global Vision Database). 
Globally, we estimated that 32·4 million people were 
blind in 2010, and that 191 million people had moderate 
and severe vision impairment. Additionally, the age-
standardised prevalence of blindness and moderate and 
severe vision impairment decreased between 1990 
and 2010.2 Country-specific data were made available 
online, searchable by level of vision impairment, age, 
and sex.

quality of life,4 and increase the risk of death.5,6 
Previously, we reported principally on blindness and 
moderate and severe vision impairment, with minimal 
detail beyond a global estimate for mild vision 
impairment because data were sparse for this vision 
impairment category, in which a person has a 
presenting (with usual optical correction) visual acuity 
less than 6/12 but 6/18 or better in the better eye.7 This 
degree of vision impairment, despite being classified as 
mild, has a substantial effect on quality of life. For 
example, in many countries, an individual with this 
level of vision would be barred from driving.8
Uncorrected presbyopia is the most common cause of 
vision impairment,9 hence WHO has recommended 
measurement of near vision in population-based surveys 
(eg, the Consultation on development of standards for 
characterization of vision loss and visual functioning in 
2003). In some contexts, impairment of near vision is at 
least as detrimental to quality of life as impairment of 
distance vision, regardless of the environment, lifestyle, 
or sociodemographic status of the affected individuals.10
Improvements to the Global Vision Database that 
broadened its capabilities enabled us to provide global 
estimates of the 2015 global burden of vision 
impairment, including functional presbyopia; to report 
trends in vision impairment from 1990 to 2015 by 
country, sex, and age; and to make projections to 2020 
and 2050 regarding the number of people with vision 
impairment.
Methods
Study design 
Using data from the Global Vision Database, we 
estimated trends in prevalence of vision impairment 
and their uncertainties, by sex, for 188 countries in the 
21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, from 1990 
to 2015 (appendix 1). Using definitions and an analytical 
framework similar to that of our previous publication2 
(appendix 1), we used statistical models to estimate the 
prevalence of two of the core categories of vision 
impairment: blindness (presenting visual acuity worse 
than 3/60) and a combined grouping called moderate 
and severe vision impairment (presenting visual acuity 
worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive; table 1).2 We did our 
analysis in seven steps: data identification and 
extraction; conversion of vision impairment data to two 
core levels (blindness and moderate and severe vision 
impairment); 
estimation 
of 
age-specific 
vision 
impairment prevalence when data were not reported by 
age; selection and use of a statistical model to estimate 
the prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe 
vision impairment by country, age, sex, and year; 
estimation of severe, moderate, and mild vision 
impairment based on crosswalk from our estimates of 
blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment; 
estimation of functional presbyopia prevalence; and 
forecasting of prevalence of blindness and vision 
impairment to 2020 and 2050.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The first systematic review of published literature (1980–2012) 
involved extraction of data on both presenting and 
best-corrected visual acuity from only population-based studies 
that reported prevalence of vision impairment and a definition 
of vision impairment for which we could develop a method for 
inclusion. These data formed the Global Vision Database from 
which estimates for global prevalence of vision impairment and 
blindness were calculated for 2010. This was the most 
comprehensive global meta-analysis of its kind, with important 
advances on previous WHO reports that had not investigated 
sex differences or age distributions in blindness and vision 
impairment. The study also permitted, for the first time, a 
temporal analysis from 1990 to 2010 that showed a decline in 
the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and vision 
impairment, but an increase in crude prevalence (due to 
population growth and ageing).
Added value of this study
This study updates the global, regional, and country-level 
blindness and vision impairment prevalence estimates to 2015, 
incorporating important developments since 2010, namely 
more data sources (61 new studies from 35 different countries) 
including more precise data (individual-level data for many 
studies), improved statistical analysis, the inclusion of 
estimates of functional presbyopia, and projections of 
blindness and vision impairment burden to 2020 and 2050.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study has shown that in 2015, an estimated 36 million 
people were blind, 217 million were moderately or severely 
vision impaired, and 188 million had mild vision impairment. 
1·09 billion people aged 35 years or older are affected by 
near-vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia. 
The interval improvement (in terms of a reduction in 
prevalence of distance vision impairment) since 1990 
and 2010, after accounting for population growth and ageing, 
suggests that investments made in the alleviation of vision 
impairment during this period have reaped considerable 
dividends. Such dividends would include improvements in 
quality of life, and large economic benefits as people work 
rather than living with unnecessary disability. Yet the growth 
and change in age structure of the world’s population is causing 
a substantial increase in the number of people with blindness 
and vision impairment, which appears to be accelerating. 
This finding highlights the need to scale up our current efforts 
at global, regional, and country level.

Data identification and extraction
We commissioned a systematic review of population-
based studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and July 8, 
2014, by York Health Economics Consortium and 
unpublished data identified by members of the Vision 
Loss Expert Group who convened for the 2010 GBD study, 
to find data on distance vision impairment.
Our systematic review used the same search terms of a 
previous systematic review,7 but we extended the review 
to include studies published up to July 8, 2014 
(appendix 1). The methods for this extended systematic 
review are described in appendix 1 as a PRISMA 
flowchart and checklist. 
Briefly, studies that were included in the Global Vision 
Database met the following requirement criteria. Reported 
prevalence of blindness, visual impairment, or both, was 
measured from random sample cross-sectional surveys of 
representative populations of any age of a country or area 
of a country. Studies using hospital or clinic case series, 
blindness registries, and interview studies with self-
reported vision status were not included. Definitions of 
visual impairment or blindness were clearly stated, used 
thresholds of visual acuity in the better eye that matched 
or could be later modelled to match the definitions given 
in appendix 1. Best-corrected or presenting visual acuity 
was stated. Procedures used for measurement of visual 
acuity were clearly stated. We extracted data on both 
presenting and best-corrected visual acuity. Appendix 1 
includes a full list of data sources for distance blindness, 
vision impairment, and presbyopia.
Conversion to core definitions of visual acuity
Similar to the strategy in our previous systematic review,2 
we standardised all prevalence data to the definitions of 
vision impairment selected for this study (appendix 1). 
We used four regressions to convert two commonly used 
definitions of blindness (visual acuity <6/60 and visual 
acuity ≤6/60) to our definition of blindness, and to 
convert two commonly reported definitions of vision 
impairment (visual acuity <6/18 and visual acuity <6/12) 
to our definition of moderate and severe vision 
impairment (appendix 1).
Estimation of age-specific data
Our statistical model is based on the age-specific prevalence 
of vision impairment for 5-year age intervals (eg, 20–24-year-
olds). In cases when studies reported the prevalence of 
vision impairment for a wider age group—such as all ages 
or adults older than 50 years—we converted these to 5-year 
age groups as follows. We fitted two universal age patterns, 
one for the prevalence of blindness and one for the 
prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment, 
meta-analysing from aggregated studies that reported 
prevalence for the narrower age groups. We then applied 
the fitted age patterns to the wide age group aggregated 
dataset, to calculate prevalence by 5-year age intervals. We 
ensured that the age-specific prevalence values summed to 
the reported wide age range prevalence when weighted by 
the country’s population by age. Further details are 
available in appendix 1.
Statistical analysis of vision impairment data
We fitted two hierarchical Bayesian logistic regressions 
to estimate vision impairment prevalence over time, by 
age group, sex, and country, with one model for the 
prevalence of blindness and one model for the prevalence 
of moderate and severe vision impairment. Using fully 
Bayesian statistical inference,11 our posterior estimates of 
vision impairment were able to flexibly borrow strength 
such that country-specific estimates were informed by 
study data from the same country, where available, and 
by study data from other countries in the same region or 
the same year. Variance parameters for the random and 
fixed effects in the model, which were themselves 
assigned prior values, enabled the model to flexibly learn 
the degree to which data were pooled between countries 
in the same region and over time.
We used a model in which vision impairment levels in 
countries were modelled hierarchically to be nested into 
each of the 21 GBD regions, which were in turn nested in 
the seven GBD world super-regions (appendix 1). We 
modelled hierarchical linear trends over time, allowing for 
region-specific trends in prevalence of vision impairment 
in the seven world super-regions. A sex effect was likewise 
modelled hierarchically by seven world super-regions, 
thus allowing for differences in sex disparities by region. 
We modelled age as a three-piece linear spline with knots 
at age 40 years and age 70 years.
To account for potential variability resulting from non-
homogeneous study designs and from some studies 
being only subnationally or locally representative, we 
included study-specific error terms, which we interacted 
with an indicator of whether the study was national or 
not. This approach permitted nationally representative 
studies to have a greater influence on estimates. We also 
included a fixed effect indicator for urban versus rural 
studies. We included a fixed effect indicator for whether 
the study measured prevalence on the basis of best-
corrected or presenting distance visual acuity, and we 
allowed this difference to vary in the south Asia region, 
for reasons we have previously described.2

To help with issues of data sparsity, we included two 
time-varying covariates: mean years of adult education by 
age group12 and an index of access to health care.13 Our 
model was developed on the basis of previous work and 
on the leave-one-out measure of model fit similar to 
cross-validation.14,15
We fitted our blindness and moderate and severe vision 
impairment models using Bayesian inference, sampling 
from the posterior distribution over the parameters 
using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a Markov chain 
Monte Carlo method, as implemented in the RStanArm 
package (version 2.11.1), which relies on Stan.16 We used a 
leave-one-out measure to assess model fit and compare 
various modelling specifications (appendix 1).
Each model was run with four chains for 1000 iterations 
each, with 500 warm-up iterations. After fitting the 
model, posterior predictions were made for each country–
year–age–sex group. Prevalence estimates are given in the 
context of 80% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Complete 
details of our model and a graphical representation of the 
model fits are provided in appendix 1.
Estimation of visual impairment
We fitted logistic regressions to convert the prevalence of 
blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment to 
mild, moderate, and severe vision impairment (appendix 
1), and applied the logistic regressions to each sampled 
prediction drawn from the Bayesian posterior, thus 
obtaining a set of samples of mild, moderate, and severe 
vision impairment by country–year–age–sex group. To 
obtain global and regional estimates, we calculated the 
means and the tenth and 90th percentiles of the posterior 
uncertainty intervals for each country prediction, age, and 
sex, then we combined these, weighting each country 
prediction by its population in the relevant age–sex 
category. We also reported age-standardised estimates 
using the WHO reference population,17 and the raw 
numbers of people with vision impairment by category. 
We calculated trends of age-standardised vision impair-
ment by world region, with UIs, by calculating the 
difference between the 1990 and 2015 age-standardised 
prevalence. The statistical code is available on request from 
the corresponding author. We investigated the attribution 
of change in age-standardised vision impairment to three 
factors, namely percentage change because of population 
growth, population ageing after accounting for population 
growth, and change in age-specific prevalence.
Estimation of functional presbyopia
To estimate the prevalence of near vision impairment 
due to uncorrected presbyopia (functional presbyopia), 
we included studies in which presbyopia was defined as 
presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm, 
regardless of distance refractive status. For broad 
estimates of vision impairment, including both distance 
and near presenting impairment, we only included data 
from people whose best-corrected visual acuity was 
6/12 (20/40) or better, to avoid double counting those 
with both distance and near vision impairment associated 
with non-refractive causes. For most of the studies, the 
prevalence of functional presbyopia was reported, as well 
as data regarding near spectacle correction, the latter of 
which we excluded. For other studies in which this 
approach was not possible, we used presenting near 
vision data if reported. For a multisite study that reported 
presenting visual acuity for which we had access to 
microdata,18,19 we included all participants with presenting 
visual acuity worse than 6/12 at near vision and subtracted 
the number of people with best-corrected visual acuity 
worse than 6/12. All included studies only included 
participants older than 35 years.
We developed a similar model to the main model used 
for blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment. 
We used a hierarchical generalised linear modelling 
framework with a negative binomial observation model 
and logistic link function. Because of data sparsity, we did 
not include country-level covariates or indicators. The 
model included an intercept term and random offsets for 
ten age categories, 21 GBD regions, seven world super-
regions, and each study, in which each set of random 
offsets was assigned a common Bayesian prior to enable 
partial pooling.20 The age categories were given by 5-year 
age bands, with an indicator variable for each age group 
starting with 35–39 years, and then continuing by 5-year 
age bands until a final age band of older than 80 years. 
Observations that covered wider age bands were 
incorporated by population-weighted averaging. For 
example, for a study reporting prevalence for ages 
35–44 years, the model’s predicted estimates for 
35–39 years and 40–44 years were averaged on the basis of 
the appropriate country-year population distribution, and 
this average was then linked to the observed prevalence.
Forecasting the prevalence of blindness and vision 
impairment
We applied our model to forecast prevalence of blindness 
and moderate and severe vision impairment. These 
forecasts projected possible scenarios rather than as fully 
probabilistic forecasts, so we have not reported UIs. Our 
model relies on health status and education as covariates. 
Since it is impossible to predict how these will evolve 
decades into the future, we extrapolated these covariates 
to the year 2020 (appendix 1) and then held them constant 
to 2050. Since our model gives estimates of crude 
prevalence for country-years, we relied on the UN 
Population Division’s forecasts to 2050 to derive crude 
numbers affected and age-standardised prevalence.21 
Thus, our estimates are also contingent on the 
assumptions regarding future fertility and mortality that 
underpin the UN Population Division’s estimates.

Results
In total, 61 new studies were added to the Global Vision 
Database and included in the meta-analysis, giving a total 
of 288 studies contributing data from 98 countries.2 The 
volume of new studies by region and reporting by 
blindness or vision impairment severity are illustrated in 
figure 1, with comparison to those in the original 
systematic review.7 Globally, of the 7·33 billion people 
alive in 2015, 36·0 million (80% UI 12·9–65·4) were blind 
(0·49%, 80% UI 0·18–0·89), of whom 20·1 million 
(80% UI 7·1–36·8) were female (56%; table 2).
The largest number of blind people resided in south 
Asia (11·7 million, 80% UI 4·1–21·7), followed by east 
Asia (6·2 million, 2·1–11·5) and southeast Asia 
(3·5 million, 1·3–6·3). The crude prevalence of blindness 
ranged from 0·24% (80% UI 0·10–0·42) in Australasia 
to 0·70% (0·24–1·29) in south Asia (appendix 1).
Moderate and severe vision impairment affected 
216·6 (80% UI 98·5–359·1) million people (2·95%, 
80% UI 1·34–4·89) of the global population, of whom 
118·9 million (55%) were female. The largest number of 
people with moderate to severe vision impairment also 
resided in south Asia (61·2 million, 80% UI 29·6–98·6), 
followed by east Asia (52·9 million, 23·2–89·6), and 
southeast Asia (20·8 million, 9·8–33·9). The prevalence 
of moderate and severe vision impairment varied 
from 1·57% (80% UI 0·67–2·66) in southern 
sub-Saharan Africa to 3·69% (1·62–6·25) in east Asia.
An estimated 188·5 (80% UI 64·5–350·2) million 
people had mild vision impairment (2·57%, 80% UI 
0·88–4·77), 101·4 million (54%) of whom were female.
Presenting functional presbyopia was estimated to 
affect 1094·7 (80% UI 581·1–1686·5) million people aged 
35 years and older, including 666·7 (364·9–997·6) million 
people aged 50 years and older. The crude prevalence of 
functional presbyopia was 35·6% (18·9–54·9) for people 
aged 35 years and older, and 40·3% (22·0–60·4) for 
people aged 50 years and older (appendix 1).
The burden of vision impairment was greatest in those 
aged 50 years and older: 31 million (86%) of 36 million 
blind people, 172·3 million (80%) of 216·6 million people 
with moderate and severe vision impairment, 140·3 (74%) 
of 188·5 million people with mild vision impairment, 
and 666·7 (61%) of 1094·7 million people with functional 
presbyopia were within this age category (table 2; 
appendix 1).
Given the strong association of vision impairment with 
age, prevalence of impairment varied by region because of

differences in regional age structures, as well as other 
differences. To compare patterns and trends in the 
prevalence of vision impairment without being confounded 
by the age structure, we calculated age-standardised 
prevalence, focusing on older adults (aged ≥50 years), who 
had the largest burden of vision impairment.
In 2015, the age-standardised prevalence of blindness 
and moderate and severe vision impairment and mild 
vision impairment among older adults was far higher in 
some developing regions than in high-income regions 
(figure 2; appendix 1). The prevalence of blindness in older 
adults was 4% or greater in three developing regions in 
2015: western sub-Saharan Africa (5·1%, 80% UI 2·0–8·9), 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa (4·3%, 1·7–7·4), and south 
Asia (4·0%, 1·5–7·3). By contrast, blindness prevalence 
was 0·5% or less in all high-income regions (figure 2; 
appendix 1). For moderate and severe vision impairment, 
the age-standardised prevalence was highest in south Asia 
(17·5%, 80% UI 9·1–27·2), North Africa and the Middle 
East (17·2%, 8·6–26·8), western sub-Saharan Africa 
(16·0%, 8·0–25·3), central sub-Saharan Africa (14·4%, 
6·3–24·5), and southeast Asia (14·1%, 6·9–22·3). 
Similarly, the prevalence of moderate and severe vision 
impairment was lowest (<5·1%; highest 80% UI upper 
bound 8·79%) in all four high-income regions, where it 
was one-third that of south Asia (figure 2; appendix 1). The 
age-standardised prevalence of mild vision impairment 
was highest in south Asia (12·2%, 80% UI 4·9–21·2), 
North Africa and the Middle East (11·9%, 4·7–20·5), 
western sub-Saharan Africa (11·2%, 4·4–19·4), and central 
sub-Saharan Africa (10·8%, 3·9–19·3). Mild vision 
impairment prevalence was 5% or less in all four high-
income regions and in central Europe (figure 2; appendix 1). 
Among the seven super-regions, the age-standardised 
prevalence of functional presbyopia was highest in older 
adults of south Asia (63·8%, 80% UI 50·9–76·6), sub-
Saharan Africa (58·5%, 42·6–73·8) and central Europe, 
eastern Europe, and central Asia (51·9%, 22·3–81·3), and 
lowest in the high-income super-region (12·2%, 3·6–24·8).
More women than men had vision impairment. When 
controlling for age, within the constraints of residual 
confounding due to longer survival of women and 
hence over-representation in very high age groups, female 
prevalence of blindness was greater than for men in all 
world regions. The world female-to-male age-standardised 
prevalence ratio among adults was 1·05 for blindness, 
1·07 for moderate and severe vision impairment, and 
1·05 for mild vision impairment.
The age-standardised prevalence of blindness in older 
adults was highest, exceeding 7% in Afghanistan, then 
Ethiopia, 
Yemen, 
Chad, 
Cameroon, 
and 
Niger 
(appendix 2). The highest age-standardised prevalence of 
moderate and severe vision impairment, which exceeded 
21% in the older adult population, was in Afghanistan, 
Nepal, Eritrea, Turkey, Laos, Pakistan, and Myanmar 
(appendix 2).
The global age-standardised all-age prevalence of 
blindness decreased from 0·75% (80% UI 0·25 to 1·41) 
in 1990 to 0·48% (0·17 to 0·87) in 2015, a decrease of 0·27 
(–0·61 to 0·00) percentage points in the age-specific 
burden of disease (90% posterior probability of a true 
decline). During the same time period, the global age-
standardised, all-age prevalence of moderate and severe 
vision impairment decreased from 3·83% (1·66 to 6·42) 
to 2·90% (1·31 to 4·80), a decrease of 0·93 (–2·29 to –0·43) 
percentage points (83% posterior probability of a true 
decline; appendix 1). The largest absolute decreases in 
blindness prevalence occurred in North Africa and the 
Middle East and south Asia (≥0·7 percentage points), and 
in the same two regions plus the GBD super-region of 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania for moderate and 
severe vision impairment (all experienced declines of at 
least 1·3 percentage points).
Between 1990 and 2015, the absolute number of blind 
people increased by 17·9%, from 30·6 million in 1990 to 
36·0 million in 2015. This increase was attributable to 
three factors, namely percentage change because of 
population growth (38·4%), population ageing after

accounting for population growth (34·6%), and change 
in age-specific prevalence (–36·7%). The number of 
people with moderate and severe vision impairment 
similarly 
increased, 
from 
159·9 
million 
to 
216·6 million (35·5%), and the proportion accounted for 
by each of these three factors were similar (38·4% increase 
due to population growth, 29·2% increase due to 
population ageing, and 24·2% decrease in age-specific 
prevalence). More detail about this global trend is given 
in table 3. We also examined the change between 2010 
and 2015 for each of these three factors for blindness 
(6·0%, 7·7%, and –7·3%, respectively) and moderate and 
severe vision impairment (6·1%, 6·7%, and –3·9%, 
respectively; data not shown).
We projected that an estimated 38·5 million people 
(80% UI 13·2–70·9; 0·50%, 80% UI 0·17–0·92) would be 
blind in 2020 (of a total global population of 7·75 billion) 
and 
114·6 
million 
people 
(23·39–229·0; 
1·18%, 
0·24–2·36) people would be blind in 2050 (of a total global 
population of 9·69 billion). For moderate and severe 
vision impairment, the estimates were 237·1 million 
people (101·5–399·0; 3·06%, 1·31–5·15) in 2020 and 
587·6 million people (155·9–1093·8; 6·06%, 1·61–11·29) 
in 2050. Global predictions of numbers of people who will 
be blind or moderately or severely vision impaired, for 
each decade between 2020–50, are shown in figure 3.
Discussion
In 2015, an estimated 36 million people were blind 
(visual acuity worse than 3/60), 217 million had moderate 
or severe vision impairment (worse than 6/18 but 3/60 or 
better), and 188 million had mild vision impairment 
(worse than 6/12 but 6/18 or better). Most people who 
were blind or who had moderate and severe vision 
impairment resided in south Asia, east Asia, and 
southeast Asia, whereas the age-standardised prevalence 
of blindness was highest in western sub-Saharan Africa, 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia. Although 
sparsity of data for presbyopia prevented a meaningful 
analysis of its prevalence in 2010, we could estimate that 
666·7 million people aged 50 years and older and 
1·09 billion people aged 35 years and older are affected 
by near vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia. 
Whereas we only presented a global estimate for mild 
vision impairment because of limited data sources 
in 2010, the advent of more recently published data for 
this category means we can now present more detailed 
regional estimates for this disability, which has an impact 
on quality of life.
The interval improvement (in terms of a reduction in 
age-standardised 
prevalence

impairment) since 1990 and since 2010, after accounting 
for population growth and ageing, suggests that modest

investments that were made in the alleviation of 
impairment during this period have reaped considerable 
dividends. Such dividends include improvements in 
quality of life and large economic benefits, because 
people work rather than living with or caring for those 
living with unnecessary vision impairment.22,23
Although this study does not directly assess the causes of 
vision impairment, the large disparities between regions—
as well as results from previous reports that directly 
addressed the question24—suggest that most cases of 
vision impairment in lesser-developed countries could be 
prevented or reversed. Although additional alleviation 
efforts will be needed everywhere, the regions with the 
largest prevalence and absolute burden of vision 
impairment should receive targeted attention. Given that a 
large proportion of blindness or vision impairment will 
require individual-level care by trained practitioners, areas 
such as those in sub-Saharan Africa with high age-
standardised prevalence of vision impairment and younger 
population age structures represent particularly important 
places in which to scale up training, in preparation for the 
predicted demographic expansion in older age groups.
The growth and change in age structure of the world’s 
population is causing a substantial increase in the 
number of people with blindness and vision impairment, 
which appears to be accelerating. Concurrently, the 
observed decline in crude prevalence appears to be 
becoming less marked, particularly with regard to severe, 
moderate, and mild vision impairment. Although there 
are limitations to the modelling projections, the projected 
increase in prevalence and the global numbers affected 
by blindness and vision impairment, for example the 
numbers of blind people increasing to 38·5 million 
by 2020 and 115 million by 2050, indicates the scale of the 
challenge. The observed reductions in age-standardised 
prevalence of visual impairment in areas that received 
modest investments in blindness alleviation suggest that 
further investment is likely to mitigate these trends.
The finding that women bear the majority of blindness 
and vision impairment in population-based studies has 
been widely reported. A review of inequity in vision loss25 
concluded that insufficient data for analysis of inequality 
remains a problem in eye care and highlights the need for 
equity-relevant goals, targets, and indicators for eye health-
care programmes. There are many other reasons for health 
inequality between population groups, between and within 
countries, which could include unfair distribution of 
power and resources and global governance dysfunction, 
these factors being judged as root causes in recent reports 
by the Commissions on Social Determinants of Health 
and the recent Global Governance for Health.26,27 Doubtless, 
some of these root causes would be responsible for the 
considerable variation in crude and age-standardised 
prevalence of blindness and vision impairment that we 
observed between countries, and the very high prevalence 
of older adult blindness in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen, 
Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.
Since 2010, we have added 61 new studies reporting 
distance vision impairment to the Global Vision Database, 
the dataset that underpins these analyses. Several principal 
investigators have contributed more disaggregated data 
than was available in their previous publications, which 
have been added to the Global Vision Database. 
Additionally, the expansion of Rapid Assessment of 
Avoidable Blindness population-based eye surveys and the 
recently created online repository for these data have been 
a valuable contribution and resource for the Global Vision 
Database. Most studies that were newly added originated 
from east Asia, south Asia, North Africa and the Middle 
East, and east sub-Saharan Africa, whereas only a few new 
studies came from high-income North America, Latin 
America, Europe, and Australasia. In view of all available 
data, gaps are still present for central and southern Sub-
Saharan Africa, eastern and central Europe, central Asia, 
and the Caribbean (figure 1).
Limitations of our study have to be taken into account. 
First, the availability of data sources varied between the

world regions, with major gaps as described previously. 
Second, the studies underlying our meta-analysis have 
varied definitions of blindness and vision impairment. 
Although we statistically corrected for differences 
between the studies, this difference increased the 
uncertainty of the estimates. We appeal for a worldwide 
reporting standardisation of definitions of blindness and 
vision impairment.28 For instance, under-corrected 
presbyopia, until recently, has mostly been neglected, 
even in major population-based studies in ophthalmology, 
with the result that precision of estimates is weaker. 
Specifically, in terms of studies involving uncorrected 
presbyopia, there are limitations that involve differences 
between studies in which some measure objective and 
others functional presbyopia, with differences in test 
distance and font size. Fourth, many studies were not 
done on a national level. Although we took into account 
the level of representativeness of the data in the statistical 
model, for many countries only regionally assessed data 
on blindness and vision impairment were available. 
Although the so-called national level is arbitrary, it is a 
natural level for ascertainment of vision impairment 
burden since policy is typically made at a national level. 
Fifth, most underlying population-based studies included 
only participants who could access the examination 
centre whereas institutionalised (often elderly) individuals 
usually did not fully participate in the studies. This 
dynamic could have biased blindness and vision 
impairment estimates downward, since many eye 
diseases are age-related.29,30 Sixth, caution must be 
exercised in the interpretation of the forecast of blindness 
and vision impairment. For example, it is assumed that 
the UN population projections for the future21 are correct 
and that the covariates that we used in our model for 
access to health care13 and literacy,12 which have not been 
modelled into the future, will remain unchanged after 
2015. Clearly, the level of provision of services will not 
remain the same, especially in areas such as cataract 
surgery and spectacles correction, but it is difficult to 
forecast what these changes will be.
By contrast with the previous modelling approach we 
took for 2010 estimates,2 we have taken a fully Bayesian 
inference approach to modelling and posterior inference 
in this analysis. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo 
methods to fit our model, thus obtaining full posterior 
distributions for all parameters and quantities of interest 
(eg, age-standardised prevalence in a given country-year 
and change in prevalence from 1990 to 2015). We sum-
marised these distributions by reporting 80% posterior 
uncertainty intervals surrounding the mean, rather than 
bootstrapped 
confidence 
intervals, 
as 
previously 
reported.2 In the Bayesian framework, these uncertainty 
intervals reflect our probabilistic belief (posterior 
credibility) in our posterior mean predictions. Our 
models also changed slightly from the previous 
publication because we followed the 2015 GBD’s slightly 
revised regional groupings.
Vision interventions provide some of the largest 
returns on investment31 and are some of the most feasibly 
implemented interventions in less developed areas 
because of limited needs for infrastructure, lower costs, 
and relatively high potential for cost recovery in certain 
subdomains (eg, cataract surgery), compared with other 
health interventions. Although this report substantiates 
the ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence 
of blindness and vision impairment noted in 2010, the 
growth and ageing of the world’s population is causing a 
substantial increase in the number of people with 
blindness and vision impairment, which appears to be 
accelerating. These observations highlight the need to 
respond to WHO’s Global Action Plan by scale-up of our 
current efforts at global, regional, and country levels, to 
eliminate the burden of unnecessary blindness and 
vision impairment.
