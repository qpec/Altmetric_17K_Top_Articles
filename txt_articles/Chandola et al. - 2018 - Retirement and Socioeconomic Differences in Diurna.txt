Abstract
Objectives: Early old age and the period around retirement are associated with a widening in socioeconomic inequalities in 
health. There are few studies that address the stress-biological factors related to this widening. This study examined whether 
retirement is associated with more advantageous (steeper) diurnal cortisol profiles, and differences in this association by 
occupational grade.
Method: Data from the 7th (2002–2004), 8th (2006), and 9th (2007–09) phases of the London-based Whitehall II civil 
servants study were analysed. Thousand hundred and forty three respondents who were employed at phase 8 (mean age 
59.9 years) and who had salivary cortisol measured from five samples collected across the day at phases 7 and 9 were 
analysed.
Results: Retirement was associated with steeper diurnal slopes compared to those who remained in work. Employees in the 
lowest grades had flatter diurnal cortisol slopes compared to those in the highest grades. Low-grade retirees in particular 
had flatter diurnal slopes compared to high-grade retirees.
Discussion: Socioeconomic differences in a biomarker associated with stress increase, rather than decrease, around the 
retirement period. These biological differences associated with transitions into retirement for different occupational groups 
may partly explain the pattern of widening social inequalities in health in early old age.
Keywords:  Inequalities—Later Life employment—Stress biomarkers
The socioeconomic gradient in health is well known, 
although the magnitude of the gradient varies over the life-
course (House et al., 1994). This socioeconomic-health gradi-
ent peaks around retirement in the United States (Deaton & 
 
Paxson, 1998; Elo & Preston, 1996; Smith & Kington, 1997) 
and a number of European countries (Majer, Nusselder, 
Mackenbach, & Kunst, 2011; van Kippersluis, Van Ourti, 
O’Donnell, & van Doorslaer, 2009; Van Ourti, 2003) with 
some evidence of widening even after retirement in the United 
Kingdom (Benzeval, Green, & Leyland, 2011; Chandola, 
Ferrie, Sacker, & Marmot, 2007). This widening in health 
inequalities could be a reflection of the accumulation of soci-
oeconomic disadvantages over the lifecourse with early life 
inequalities in health becoming magnified over the life cycle.
Retirement could potentially moderate this pattern of 
widening health inequalities with age if the health effects 
of retirement differ between socioeconomic groups.

 disadvantaged workers, is associated with poorer health, 
however, evidence for the effect of overall retirement on 
health is ambiguous (Banks, Chandola, & Matthews, 
2015). A systematic review on retirement and health sug-
gests retirement has a beneficial effect on mental health (van 
der Heide, van Rijn, Robroek, Burdorf, & Proper, 2013), 
although meta-analyses from the same review suggest that 
retirement has no overall effect on perceived general health 
and physical health.
There is also some evidence that the health benefits of 
retirement mainly occurs among employees working in low 
occupational grades and poor quality work (Westerlund 
et al., 2009), who report improved health on retirement, 
although the improvements were only observed for self-
reported and mental health measures and not for physical 
health (Westerlund et al., 2010). The improvement in men-
tal health shortly after retirement may be a consequence 
of a reduction in work-related stressors, particularly for 
those in the lowest occupational grades and poorest work-
ing conditions. There is evidence that chronic work stress-
ors are more prevalent in the lowest occupational grades 
(Wahrendorf, Dragano, & Siegrist, 2013), as well as evi-
dence that such chronic stressors affect physical (Chandola, 
Brunner, & Marmot, 2006) and mental health (Stansfeld 
& Candy, 2006). However, the retirement-related improve-
ment in health for employees in low occupational grades 
and poor quality work appears to contradict other observed 
patterns of widening social inequalities in health in early 
old age and retirement.
One of the limitations of existing studies on retirement 
and health is a lack of studies on related biological pro-
cesses stress is often inferred from mental health measures, 
but direct biophysiological measures associated with the 
stress response are often not measured. There is, as yet, 
no evidence on a reduction in physiological stress levels 
around retirement, particularly for those in low occupa-
tional grades and poor working conditions. It may be use-
ful to examine what happens to biophysiological measures 
associated with stress around the period of retirement, as 
self-reported measures of stress and mental health may 
be confounded by social status and perceptions of health. 
With retirement and pension age increasing in most coun-
tries, there is a need to examine whether such policies could 
impact on the wellbeing of employees in disadvantaged 
working conditions.
There is now considerable scientific evidence linking 
lower and more disadvantaged social positions to higher 
levels of biomarkers of stress (Dowd, Simanek, & Aiello, 
2009; Kumari et al., 2010a; Kunz-Ebrecht, Kirschbaum, 
& Steptoe, 2004; Matthews & Gallo, 2011; Steptoe et al., 
2003). Cortisol is a stress hormone that follows a diurnal 
profile, peaking around 30 minutes after awakening, and 
returning to very low levels by bedtime. Stress disrupts 
the diurnal profile of cortisol, resulting in elevated levels 
of cortisol and a flatter diurnal slope from the awaken-
ing response to bedtime. Flatter diurnal cortisol slopes 
are thus a key biomarker associated with stress, indicat-
ing dysregulation in the endocrine stress response system 
(Adam & Kumari, 2009). Flatter diurnal cortisol slopes 
are also associated with cardiovascular mortality—a 1 
SD increase in cortisol at bedtime was associated with a 
doubling of the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality 
within 6–8 years (Kumari, Shipley, Stafford, & Kivimaki, 
2011). Previous analyses of diurnal cortisol slopes in the 
same study found two distinct patterns of diurnal cortisol 
secretion—a “normative” versus a “raised” pattern with 
the latter characterized by higher diurnal cortisol and a 
flatter diurnal slope, which in turn was associated with 
older age, smoking status, stress on the day of sampling 
and shorter sleep duration (Kumari et al., 2010b).
However, a major limitation of previous studies on 
social position and cortisol is a lack of longitudinal analy-
ses, especially in relation to changes in social position and 
stress. There are different theories about how a change in 
social position affects stress and the associated biological 
response. The impact of social position on stress may dif-
fer by stability of social rank. The physiological and psy-
chological advantages of high social rank disappears when 
rank is unstable among baboons (Sapolsky, 1992). Among 
humans, the period around retirement could be particularly 
important as status based on occupation rankings could 
change during the transition to retirement. A steep upward 
career path in the life-history of Dutch retirees was asso-
ciated with more difficulties adjusting to the loss of sta-
tus following retirement (Damman, Henkens, & Kalmijn, 
2015). Furthermore, as work-related stressors are more 
prevalent among lower ranking occupations, retirement is 
likely to reduce stress among low-grade employees. Thus, 
the social gradient in stress may become less pronounced as 
employees transition into retirement because of a reduction 
in work-related stress among employees in lower ranking 
occupations.
A further limitation of existing cross-sectional research 
on socioeconomic differences in stress is the lack of con-
trols for previous levels of stress and health. Employees 
who are stressed or more unhealthy are also more likely 
to leave their jobs (Wahrendorf et al., 2013), resulting in 
a “survivor” workforce who are better able to cope with 
stressors or who are less stressed. It is thus difficult to com-
pare the cross-sectional stress levels of employees who sur-
vive in employment to their “retired” peers, as they may 
have been differentially exposed to work stressors, or those 
who remain in employment may be more resilient to stress-
ors and ill-health.
This study investigated whether a recent transition into 
retirement was associated with steeper (more advantageous) 
diurnal cortisol slopes compared to those in employment 
in later life. Furthermore, we examined whether retirement 
was associated with steeper diurnal slopes for those at the 
bottom of the occupational hierarchy who transitioned 
into retirement, compared to their peers who remained in 
employment.

 Methods
Study Participants
The data analysed were from the 7th (2002–2004), 8th 
(2006), and 9th (2007–09) phases of the Whitehall II cohort 
study. The cohort was initially recruited between 1985 
and 1988 (phase 1) from 20 London-based civil service 
departments. Eleven phases of the study have been com-
pleted, although only phases 7 and 9 have saliva sam-
ples for the assessment of cortisol. The initial cohort (of 
10,308 employees) was recruited between 1985 and 1988 
from 20 London-based civil service departments (Marmot 
& Brunner, 2005). Ethical approval for the Whitehall II 
study was obtained from the University College London 
Medical School committee on the ethics of human research. 
Informed consent was gained from every participant.
As the research questions focus on recent transitions 
from employment to retirement, transitions among those 
who were in employment at phase 8 (2006) and who were 
either still in work or self-reported as retired by phase 9 
(2007–09) were analysed (n = 2,598). Among them, only 
1,501 had cortisol measured at phase 7, and a further 1,190 
had cortisol measured at phase 9. The analytical sample 
further reduced (n = 1,143) with missing covariate data.
Cortisol Collection and Analysis
Respondents provided (by post) six saliva samples in 
salivettes over the course of a normal (working) weekday 
at waking, +30 mins, +2.5 hours, +8 hours, +12 hours, and 
bedtime at phases 7 and 9. Only a subsample of all phase 
7 respondents could participate because of a late start to 
the data collection for cortisol, but all phase 9 respondents 
were eligible for cortisol data collection. Participation rates 
in cortisol collection were around 90% at both phases. 
Respondents used a log book to record information on their 
waking time and the time each sample was taken; techni-
cal details are available here (Kumari, Shipley, Stafford, & 
Kivimaki, 2011). There was a right skewed distribution of 
cortisol values and cortisol data were transformed by natu-
ral logarithm for the regression analysis.
Exposures
Hours since awakening
This was based on respondents recording of waking time 
and time of sampling in the log book diary. Linear and 
quadratic terms of the time variable were used in the mod-
els to estimate nonlinear effects.
Employment grade
Civil service employment grade was used to categorize peo-
ple into high, middle, or low grades. Civil service jobs are 
predominantly nonmanual, although a few office support 
staff were messengers and porters (Marmot & Brunner, 
2005). About half of those still employed at phase 8 were 
still working in the civil service. Those employed elsewhere 
were classed according to their last civil service grade as 
that is a strong predictor of their health, and similar to the 
low prevalence of manual jobs in the civil service, very few 
of ex-civil servants (<5%) were working in partly skilled or 
unskilled manual jobs.
All participants were working at baseline (phase 
8). Employment status at follow up (phase 9) was self-
reported. Only those who remained in employment or 
had stated they had retired were included in the analysis. 
Those who were unemployed (n = 32), too sick to work 
(n = 4), or were looking after their family (n = 12) were 
not included in the analysis as these other labor market 
and economic inactivity statuses are likely to be associ-
ated with poorer health. Due to the healthy worker effect 
(Li & Sung, 1999), we tried to keep the control (still 
employed) and treatment (retired) groups as similar as 
possible by removing from the analysis those workers 
who had stopped working for any other reason apart 
from self-reporting as retired.
Covariates
Age, sex, and smoking status were assessed by question-
naire. Current smokers were defined as those who reported 
smoking cigarettes, cigars or a pipe, social or occasional 
smoking, or taking nicotine replacement products. Body 
mass index (BMI) groups (<20, 20–25, 25–30, and 30+) 
were derived from height and weight measurements by 
trained nurses at phases 7 and 9. Hours slept the night 
before day of saliva sample collection was based on the 
respondents recording in the log book diary of their time 
of falling asleep and their awakening time. Sleep duration 
was grouped into 5 categories (<5 hours, 5–6 hours, 6–7 
hours, 7–8 hours, and 8 hours+). Self-reported health was 
measured by a question on general health (5-point Likert 
scale going from excellent to poor) and the report of any 
long standing illness. Marital status was categorized into 
never married, currently married/cohabiting, and formerly 
married/cohabiting. All the continuous covariates (age, 
BMI, sleep hours, and awakening time) were categorized 
to facilitate the interpretation of the interactions with the 
continuous hours since awakening variable.
Statistical Methods
As the cortisol values are sampled across the day and clus-
tered within individual respondents, multilevel growth 
curve models were analysed. These models account for 
the clustering of sampled occasions of cortisol collection 
within individuals, as well as between-individual heteroge-
neity in the diurnal slopes, by estimating random slopes for 
the hours since awakening variable. Only a random slope 
for the linear hours since awakening variable was estimated 
as the random slope for the quadratic term resulted in very 
small estimates and negative variance estimates.

 In each of these models, the phase 9 log cortisol values 
on awakening, at 2.5, 8, and 12 hours later and at bedtime 
were regressed on hours since awakening, the employment 
grade/status variables and the other covariates. The second 
diurnal cortisol sample at 30 minutes after awakening was 
not included as the cortisol awakening response and the 
diurnal slope may have differing biological underpinnings 
(Adam & Kumari, 2009).
The interaction terms between the employment grade, 
employment status and hours since awakening were 
included in the models to test whether the diurnal corti-
sol slopes differed between employment grade and status 
categories. These interaction terms between these covari-
ates and hours since awakening were added to the model 
even if the main effects of the covariates were not statisti-
cally significant, as the nonsignificant average diurnal effect 
of the covariates could be masking significant differences 
between the diurnal slopes. This could occur due to “quali-
tative” or “crossover” interactions (VanderWeele & Knol, 
2014). Statistical significance at the 5% level was measured 
by the change in Deviance (−2 * Log Likelihood Ratio) of 
nested models. All the models controlled for key confound-
ers measured at phase 9, that have previously been shown 
to be associated with diurnal cortisol—age, sex, smoking 
status, BMI, sleep hours, and awakening time, as well as 
the significant interactions of each of these covariates with 
hours since awakening. We also controlled for the phase 7 
values of log cortisol and the interaction with hours since 
awakening, which results in the interpretation of regression 
coefficients as change in cortisol slopes (from phase 7 to 9). 
However, the addition of the Wave 7 diurnal cortisol vari-
ables to the models made very little difference to the other 
coefficients in the model, with the exception of the intercept 
(see Supplementary Appendix Table 2 for a comparison of 
final model coefficients from Table 2 with and without 
Wave 7 diurnal cortisol). Hence, rather than describing the 
coefficients in Table 2 in terms of change in diurnal cortisol 
slopes, we have ignored interpreting the effect of lagged 
cortisol, and instead interpreted the coefficients in terms of 
associations with the phase 9 diurnal cortisol slopes.
We additionally tested whether other potential con-
founders such as marital status (at phase 9), and other 
potential selection factors such as self-reported health 
and longstanding illness (measured at phase 7, as these 
are potential selection factors), and their interactions with 
hours since awakening were associated with diurnal corti-
sol and found no evidence for improvement in model fit, so 
these were removed from further analysis. All the multilevel 
analyses were carried out using MLwin software.
Results
Table 1 displays the mean cortisol on awakening and bed-
time at phases 7 and 9 of the Whitehall II study by key 
explanatory variables in the analysis. Employees working 
in the lowest grades had lower cortisol values on awakening 
but higher cortisol at bedtime in both periods. This suggests 
that the low-grade employees had flatter diurnal slopes at 
both phases. A similar pattern of flatter diurnal slopes was 
observed for the employed (compared to the retired) at both

 phases. At phase 9, flatter slopes were observed for partici-
pants reporting short sleep hours (<6 hours). The mean age 
of employees at phase 8 was 59.9 years (with a standard 
deviation of 4.2). By phase 9, the mean age of those who 
retired was 62.9, and among those still in employment was 
61.7 years.
Table 2 displays the results of the multilevel model with 
the log transformed salivary cortisol sampled throughout 
the day as the dependent variable. All the models were 
adjusted for age-group, employment status, gender, sleep 
hours, awakening time, smoking status, and Wave 7 diur-
nal cortisol levels, as well as their interactions with the 
hours since awakening variable. BMI, marital status, gen-
eral health, longstanding illness, and their interactions with 
hours since awakening did not improve model fit and so 
were excluded from further analysis. Similarly, the inter-
action of gender with hours since awakening was not sig-
nificant so gender was only a main effect in the displayed 
models. The additional covariates from all the models are 
displayed in Supplementary Appendix Table 1.
Table 2 displays coefficients that are the same for all 
individuals (“fixed”) and that differ between individuals 
(“random”) from the different multilevel models. As we are 
interested in comparing the diurnal cortisol slopes of differ-
ent individuals and groups, we first needed to describe the 
“growth curves” of diurnal cortisol (Model 1). A standard 
growth curve model has a (fixed) time coefficient that is the 
average increase or decrease in the dependent variable per 
unit of time. In addition, a random slope of the time coef-
ficient was estimated to allow for differing growth rates for 
individuals.
Model 1 examined the baseline model with the linear 
and quadratic terms for hours since awakening as the key 
explanatory variables, adjusted for all the covariates men-
tioned above. The negative linear hours since awakening 
coefficient (or “slope”) is the average diurnal decline in 
cortisol (measured in log nmol/l) per hour, which is moder-
ated by the positive quadratic hours term later in the day. 
An additional hour after awakening was associated with an 
average reduction of 0.1 of log cortisol, although there was 
some variation between individuals in these diurnal cortisol 
slopes (indicated by the random terms for the linear slope). 
Model 2 (not shown in the Table) added in employment 
grade, but the coefficients for middle and low grades over-
lapped zero and there was no improvement in model fit. 
Despite the lack of evidence of a main effect of employment 
grade, the interaction of grade with hours since awakening 
was entered into Model 3 (due to a potential “crossover 
interaction” as mentioned in the Methods section) and this 
resulted in an improvement in model fit. The coefficients 
for grade (which were close to zero in Model 2) became 
more negative, indicating that the lower grade employees 
tended to have lower cortisol on awakening. Furthermore, 
the interaction terms with hours since awakening were 
positive, indicating that the lower grade employees tended 
to have flatter diurnal cortisol slopes. Model 4 (not shown 
in the Table) added in employment status and Model 
5 (shown in Table 2) added in the interaction between 
employment status and hours since awakening. Employees 
still in employment at phase 9 had similar levels of cortisol 
when they woke up compared to their peers who retired. 
However, the diurnal decline in cortisol was flatter (+0.01 
log cortisol per hour) for those remaining in employment 
compared to those who retired, indicating that retirement 
was associated with steeper diurnal cortisol slopes. Model 
6 added in the interaction of employment grade and status, 
which further improved the fit of the model, although the 
three-way interaction between employment status, grade, 
and hours since awakening (Model 7) did not improve 
model fit.
As the coefficients for interaction terms in Model 6 are 
hard to interpret in isolation given the other interactions 
in the model, specific interaction effects are presented in 
Figures 1–4. The diurnal slopes for all three occupational 
groups are hard to distinguish when plotted in the same fig-
ure, so only the estimated diurnal slopes for the high- and 
low-grade employees are shown in the figures, although all 
three occupational groups (including middle-grade employ-
ees) were included in the interaction analyses (see Table 2, 
Models 4–7). Among respondents who had recently retired, 
(Figure 1), there was a clear occupational difference in the 
diurnal cortisol slope—employees who were formerly in the 
lowest grades have flatter slopes and higher diurnal cortisol 
levels by bedtime compared to those who were formerly 
employed in the high grades. The 95% confidence inter-
vals for the low-grade retirees overlapped with the cortisol 
estimates for the high-grade retirees on awakening. But as 
the day went on, the lower confidence intervals for the low-
grade retirees were distinctly higher than the cortisol esti-
mates for the high-grade retirees. Among participants still 
in employment at phase 9 (Figure 2), although the estimated 
slopes for low-grade employees were flatter than for high-
grade employees, they were not distinct from each other, 
especially toward evening and night time. Another way of 
examining the interaction is by looking at the employment 
status differences within occupational grades (Figures 3 
and 4). Among the high-grade employees, those who had 
retired had steeper estimated diurnal slopes compared to 
their peers who remained in employment (Figure 3). The 
lower 95% confidence intervals of higher cortisol later in 
the day for high-grade employees who were still working 
at phase 9 did not overlap with the estimated cortisol for 
their peers who had retired. Comparing the lowest grade 
employees, there was not much difference in the slopes of 
those who retired and those still in employment (Figure 4).
Discussion
This study has shown that British civil servants employed 
in the lowest occupational grades had flatter (more adverse) 
diurnal cortisol slopes compared to those in the highest 
grades. The occupational gradient in diurnal cortisol slopes

 was distinct among those who had recently retired, but less 
clear among those who were still working past standard 
retirement age (60 years for this cohort). Retirement was 
associated with steeper (more advantageous) diurnal slopes 
compared to those who remained in work; however, there 
was no difference in the retirement slope by occupational 
grade. Retirement was not associated with more advanta-
geous cortisol profiles for those formerly employed in the 
lowest grades in comparison to their peers who were still 
working.
This study thus appears to find some evidence that the 
occupational gradient in diurnal cortisol is different for 
retired compared to employed British civil servants work-
ing past standard retirement age. Rather than retirement 
being associated with lower levels of biomarkers of stress 
for those at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy, this 
period of the lifecourse appears to reinforce existing ine-
qualities and widen the gap between occupational groups. 
The hypotheses were based on previous evidence suggest-
ing that the period around retirement is associated with 
an improvement in self-rated health among employees in 
poor quality and low-grade jobs around retirement in the 
GAZEL study (Westerlund et al., 2009). This discrepancy 
in findings may be driven by the different populations 
in the two studies. The GAZEL study included blue col-
lar workers, with physically demanding jobs, with poten-
tially higher stress levels compared to British civil servants. 
Furthermore, the follow up period for this study (2–3 years) 
was longer than the 1-year measurement intervals of the 
15-year follow up in GAZEL. It is possible that any effects 
of retirement on improving the stress levels of employees in 
the lowest grades may only be temporary and not have an 
effect a year or more after retirement. Moreover, the meas-
ures of self-rated health used in the GAZEL study may not 
correspond to levels of cortisol used in this study.
Although this study did not directly examine the role of 
work stress on diurnal cortisol profiles, previous research 
from the Whitehall II study has shown that effort-reward 
imbalance was associated with flatter diurnal cortisol 
profiles (Liao, Brunner, & Kumari, 2013). Effort-reward 
imbalance was lower among higher grade occupations 
(Wahrendorf et al., 2013), so the removal of work stressors

 through retirement is unlikely to explain the improved 
cortisol profiles of those recently retired from the high-
est grades. A previous report from the Whitehall II study 
also found an improvement in mental health for employees 
working in the highest grades when they retire, with no cor-
responding improvement among employees working in the 
lowest grades (Mein, Martikainen, Hemingway, Stansfeld, 
& Marmot, 2003). Civil servants working in the highest 
grades would normally receive higher pensions and may be 
more able to enjoy the leisure and social participation and 
activities in retirement due to their higher levels of resources 
and better health than those retiring from low-grade occu-
pations. Qualitative interviews among lower grade civil 
servants suggest that they worry about their reduced income 
in retirement (Mein, Higgs, Ferrie, & Stansfeld, 1998).
Respondents self-reported their retirement status, which 
could lead to measurement bias as many “retired” peo-
ple still engage in paid employment (Banks, Chandola, & 
Matthews, 2015). We did not collect data on reasons for 
retirement for all participants, although early exit due to 
health reasons is unlikely to be a key reason as the mean 
age of participants at baseline was so close to retirement age 
and the health measures assessed at baseline did not pre-
dict the diurnal cortisol slopes. We relied on self-reports for 
the timing of cortisol sample collection as evidence suggests 
that people are usually accurate in reporting this informa-
tion (Dockray, Bhattacharyya, Molloy, & Steptoe, 2008).
The study did not look at within person change (fixed 
effects) because the aim was to examine the between per-
son differences (differences between occupational grades). 
As very few civil servants change employment grades at 
this age, a fixed-effects model would have deleted anyone 
with stable characteristics like employment grade, making 
it impossible to compare employees from different occupa-
tional grades. Therefore, we did not estimate a causal effect 
of transitioning from employment to retirement, although 
we tried to reduce selection bias by controlling for a num-
ber of relevant confounders, including previous levels of 
cortisol. Additionally, our sample of older workers was 
on average, aged just under standard retirement age (aged 
60 years) at baseline and was followed up for around 2 to 
3 years after. The healthy worker effect suggests that our 
baseline sample were a healthy cohort as they remained in 
employment close to retirement age. Furthermore, we tried 
to reduce health-selection effects from the follow up sam-
ple by removing from the analysis, those who had stopped 
working for any other reason apart from self-reporting as 
retired. This is because stopping working for reasons of 
limiting health, unemployment, or family issues is likely to 
be correlated with health and could confound the reported 
associations. Around 51% of employees were working in 
noncivil service jobs. Their last civil service grade (prior 
to leaving the civil service) may not accurately reflect their 
current occupational position, although very few (<5%) 
who were working outside the civil service were in partly 
skilled and unskilled manual work, which reflects the low 
prevalence of manual work in the civil service. A further 
limitation is the lack of generalizability of the results to 
working conditions outside the civil service. However, civil 
servants tend to have very good working conditions, com-
pared to the general working population. As this study 
found an association between low-grade work and stress 
among civil servants, it is likely that such an effect is under-
estimated, given that poor working conditions are more 
prevalent in the general working population compared to 
the civil service. Only respondents with diurnal cortisol data 
at phases 7 and 9 were included in the analysis, resulting in 
a loss of 56% of the respondents who were in employment 
at phase 8, with lower grade employees over-represented. 
Such a loss in sample size could have biased the results if 
there were occupational grade by employment status dif-
ferences in the missing versus nonmissing respondents. 
Further analysis (not shown) revealed that employees in 
the lowest civil service grade who were still in employment 
at phase 9 were most likely to have missing cortisol data. 
As low-grade employees have flatter diurnal cortisol slopes, 
the higher prevalence of missing cortisol data among low-
grade employees also suggests an underestimation of the 
reported associations between lower occupational grade 
and flatter diurnal slopes. The estimated cortisol slopes 
were based on data collected in 2007–09. Working and 
retirement conditions for current older employees in the 
civil service and elsewhere may be different nowadays with 
some groups of older workers having relatively stable jobs 
and pension arrangements, and other older workers having 
more unstable working and retirement conditions.
The analysis of biological markers of stress in relation to 
transitions into retirement has revealed new insights on the 
process of retirement, stress, and inequalities. Occupational 
grade differences in a biomarker of stress were larger among 
the retired compared to those currently employed. Employees 
in the highest grades appeared to benefit the most from retire-
ment in terms of steeper diurnal cortisol slopes, whereas there 
was no apparent benefit of retirement among those working 
in the lowest grades. These biological differences associated 
with transitions into retirement for different occupational 
groups may partly explain the pattern of widening social 
inequalities in health in early old age. Further research using 
more representative population samples on the biological 
processes underlying socioeconomic inequalities in health 
could help identify important older age lifecourse factors that 
generate widening health inequalities in early old age.
