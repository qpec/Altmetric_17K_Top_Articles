Background.
The safety and effectiveness studies of emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF) for human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) infection pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men and women showed that daily use reduced the risk of
HIV acquisition, but there still may concerns about safety.
Methods.
A narrative review was done in September 2015 comparing the 5 major studies on PrEP for HIV infection—Preex-
posure Prophylaxis Initiative (N = 2499; 3324 person-years), Partners Preexposure Prophylaxis (N = 4747; 7830 person-years), TDF2
(N = 1219; 1563 person-years), Preexposure Prophylaxis Trial for HIV Prevention among African Women (N = 2056; 1407 person-
years), and Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic (N = 4969; 5509 person-years)—and the 2 major studies on
aspirin safety—Physicians’ Health Study (N = 22 071; over 110 000 person-years) and the Women’s Health Study (N = 39 876; ap-
proximately 400 000 person-years). The numbers needed to harm (NNH) were calculated for FTC-TDF for HIV infection PrEP and
aspirin.
Results.
The NNH for FTC-TDF in men who have sex with men and transgender women was 114 for nausea and 96 for un-
intentional weight loss; in heterosexual couples, the NNH was 68 for moderate decreased absolute neutrophil count. For aspirin, the
NNH was 909 for major gastrointestinal bleeding, 123 for any gastrointestinal bleeding, and 15 for any bleeding problems in men. In
women, the NNH for easy bruising was 10.
Conclusions.
We conclude that FTC-TDF for PrEP for HIV infection favorably compares with aspirin in terms of user safety.
Although long-term studies are needed, providers should feel reassured about the safety of short- and medium-term PrEP for HIV
infection with FTC-TDF.

In July 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved a once-daily oral emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) tablet as combination therapy
(FTC-TDF) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition [1]. The
safety and effectiveness of FTC-TDF for HIV PrEP in men
and women was reported in several studies and showed that
daily use reduced the risk of HIV acquisition, a profound
achievement in HIV prevention [2–4]. For example, in the Pre-
exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx) trial, it was reported that
among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender
women (N = 2499; 3324 person-years), PrEP reduced the inci-
dence of HIV acquisition by 44% [3]. Although 44% might not
seem high, that analysis was done conservatively by intention-
to-treat, whereas an analysis restricted to those with adequate
blood levels of medication showed a 92% reduction in HIV ac-
quisition [3].
In another study, Partners Preexposure Prophylaxis (Partners
PrEP; N = 4747; 7830 person-years), Baeten et al [2]reported on
the effectiveness of antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV preven-
tion in heterosexual couples. When comparing the rate of ac-
quisition among HIV-1 serodiscordant, heterosexual couples
taking oral TDF and FTC-TDF with those taking a placebo, it
was found that oral TDF and FTC-TDF reduced the rate of HIV
acquisition by 67% and 75%, respectively [2]. Among women,
the effectiveness of TDF was 71% and 61% for FTC-TDF [2].
Furthermore, Thigpen et al [4] in the TDF2 study observed
1219 heterosexuals (1563 person-years) and found that FTC-
TDF conferred a 62% protective effect. Although other studies
of tenofovir-based PrEP for HIV infection in women did not
find reduced rates of HIV acquisition among those allocated
to the active medication, such as Van Damme et al’s [5]
study, Preexposure Prophylaxis Trial for HIV Prevention
among African Women (FEM-PrEP; N = 2056; 1407 person-
years), and Marrazzo et al’s [6] study, Vaginal and Oral Inter-
ventions to Control the Epidemic (VOICE; N = 4969; 5509

Is Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Safer Than Aspirin? • OFID • 1

 person-years), the low adherence to medications for PrEP likely
explains the lack of effectiveness seen in the trials mentioned.
With the potential increased use of FTC-TDF for prevention
of HIV infection, there is the potential that it could have a large
impact on the HIV epidemic if use were brought to scale. How-
ever, for scale-up of FTC-TDF for the prevention of HIV infec-
tion to have a public health impact, sustainable funding and
physician training are required in addition to physician and
public confidence in the safety of the medication.
Therefore, it seems prudent to consider the safety of FTC-
TDF for PrEP for HIV infection against a standard of chemo-
prophylaxis in medicine—aspirin. Aspirin is the mostly widely
prescribed and used primary and secondary chemoprophylactic
for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, including can-
cer [7]. Prophylactic aspirin (daily or once every 2 days) is used
by almost one fifth of all adults in the United States [8]. It is es-
timated that 52% of adults in the United States aged 45 to 75
years are on aspirin therapy [9]. Therefore, given the frequent
use of aspirin as a prophylactic drug in the United States, it in-
vites the question: Is FTC-TDF for PrEP for HIV infection safer
than aspirin?
METHODS
A narrative review was done in September 2015 comparing the
5 major studies on PrEP for HIV infection—iPrEx, Partners
PrEP, TDF2, FEM-PrEP, and VOICE—and the 2 major studies
on aspirin safety—the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS; N =
22 071; over 110 000 person-years) and the Women’s Health
Study (WHS; N = 39 876; approximately 400 000 person-
years). PubMed was used as the search platform for the litera-
ture review using the search words “Emtricitabine Tenofovir
Disoproxil Fumarate” OR “Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for
HIV” OR “Aspirin Safety” OR “Aspirin Physicians Health
Study” OR “Aspirin Women Health Study”. The studies on
PrEP for HIV infection were conducted in outpatient settings
globally, whereas aspirin was studied in outpatient settings in
the United States. The studies on PrEP for HIV infection
were conducted in patients over 18 years old at high risk of
HIV acquisition; studies in women limited ages to 18 to 35 or
18 to 45 years of age. The PHS recruited male physicians aged
40 to 84 years, and the WHS followed female health profession-
als aged 45 years or older. The numbers needed to harm (NNH)
and excess risk were calculated for FTC-TDF for PrEP for HIV
infection and aspirin. Numbers needed to harm is a common
method used in cost-benefit analyses to normalize harmful
events in studies with varying populations and study durations.
We restricted reporting the number of excess events to statisti-
cally significant associations found in the studies.
RESULTS
The published studies on the prophylactic use of FTC-TDF and
aspirin showed they were both associated with an excess risk of
a particular set of adverse events (Table 1) [2–6, 10, 11]. In the
iPrEx trial of FTC-TDF for HIV prevention, 0.8 excess events of
unintentional weight loss and 0.7 excess events of moderate
nausea per 100 FTC-TDF user-years were reported [3]. In the
Partners PrEP study, investigators observed 0.9 excess cases
per 100 FTC-TDF user-years of moderate decreased absolute
neutrophil counts [2]. The TDF2 study investigators reported
excess rates of nausea (8.9 excess events per 100 FTC-TDF
user-years), vomiting (3.3 per 100), and dizziness (3.1 per
100) among those taking FTC-TDF [4]. The FEM-PrEP study
observed excess rates of mildly elevated liver enzymes (4.1 ex-
cess events per 100 FTC-TDF), vomiting (3.6 per 100), and nau-
sea (2.6 per 100), whereas the VOICE study only observed 1.3
excess events per 100 FTC-TDF user-years of mildly elevated
serum creatinine levels [5, 6].
In both men and women, investigators of the iPrEx, Part-
ners PrEP, TDF2, FEM-PrEP, and VOICE studies reported
no serious irreversible events and no FTC-TDF-associated
hospitalizations or deaths [2–6]. Further reversible adverse ef-
fects included a mild decrease in creatinine clearance (a mark-
er for renal function) and a small decrease in bone mineral
density, both of which reversed after FTC-TDF discontinua-
tion [12, 13]. It should be noted that FTC-TDF prophylaxis
for HIV infection has not been associated with any bone frac-
tures, adverse pregnancy-related events, or permanent renal
failure [3, 14, 15].
Comparatively, aspirin was associated with bleeding disor-
ders in men and women (Table 1) [10, 11]. In the final report
on aspirin, the PHS, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
in men published in 1989, investigators reported excess rates of
bleeding problems (1.3 excess events per 100 aspirin user-
years), easy bruising (1.0 per 100), epistaxis (0.4 per 100),
other bleeding problems (0.2 per 100), melena (0.2 per 100),
other noninfectious disorders of the digestive tract (0.1 per
100), and duodenal ulcers (0.03 per 100) [10]. The WHS, pub-
lished on aspirin and the prevention of cardiovascular disease in
women, reported an excess number of cases of easy bruising
(1.0 excess events per 100 aspirin user-years), epistaxis (0.2
per 100), hematuria (0.1 per 100), peptic ulcers (0.1 per 100),
and gastrointestinal symptoms (0.1 per 100), with some bleed-
ing events requiring transfusion (0.02 per 100) [11].
How do physicians weigh the risks and benefits of prophylac-
tic medication? One key consideration is the NNH: the number
of treated patients per year needed to possibly result in a harm-
ful outcome. For FTC-TDF in the iPrEx study in MSM and
transgender women, the NNH was 114 for nausea and 96 for
unintentional weight loss (Table 1). In the Partners PrEP
Study, the NNH was 68 for moderate decreased absolute neu-
trophil count; for other adverse events, the NNH was 166 for
decreased creatinine clearance and 5 for a 1% average decrease
in bone density in the spine and approximately one half of 1%
in the hip over a period of 24 weeks; all of which were reversible

 [2, 12, 13]. More substantial changes in bone density were not
observed [12].
For aspirin, major gastrointestinal bleeding is expected once
per 909 person-years of prophylaxis; any gastrointestinal bleed-
ing is expected to occur once per 123 person-years [16]. The
NNH for aspirin was 15 for any bleeding problems in men
(Table 1) [10]. In women, the NNH for easy bruising was 10.
A meta-analysis of 16 aspirin and cardiovascular disease pre-
vention trials with a total of 55 462 participants estimated that
there would be 1 hemorrhagic stroke in every 833 persons treated
prophylactically [17]. A more recent study estimated that 1 hem-
orrhagic stroke was expected for every 5000 patients treated with
aspirin who were diagnosed with coronary heart disease [18].
Given the large number of people taking aspirin, the number
of potential aspirin-related adverse events is not inconsequential.
The other side of the balance of determining when to initiate
prophylaxis is the benefit and the severity of the condition being
prevented. Although HIV infection is currently treatable in
places where medication is available and the life expectancy of
treated HIV-infected patients approaches that of HIV-uninfected
patients [19], HIV infection remains highly stigmatized, treat-
ment is very costly and requires regular medical visits. HIV is
still potentially transmissible to others, and current treatments
have their own short- and long-term toxicities [20]. However,
PrEP for HIV infection also has associated financial costs, re-
quires regular medical visits, and may have stigma attached to
it in some communities [21].
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature life
lost in the United States, and an estimated 85.6 million persons
are living with some form of cardiovascular disease [22]. One
study found that the number needed to treat (NNT) with aspi-
rin to avoid 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction event was 27 per
year, and the NNT to avert 1 cardiovascular disease-related
event over the same period of time was 20 [23].
Using FTC-TDF for PrEP for HIV infection, it was demon-
strated that the NNT to avoid 1 HIV infection was 13 in the
PROUD study, a randomized trial conducted in England with
MSM who had reported having recent anal intercourse without

a The excess cases per 100 FTC-TDF user-years were calculated with the following equation: (((number of cases with adverse event in intervention group)/(total number of participants in the
intervention group × average numbers of years followed) × 100 users)) − ((number of cases with adverse event in control group)/(total number of participants in the control group × average
numbers of years followed) × 100 users))). The NNH was calculated with the following equation: NNH = 1/((number of cases with adverse event in intervention group)/(total number of
participants in the intervention group) − (number of cases with adverse event in control group)/(total number of participants in the control group)). The data were adapted from 4
randomized studies [3, 5, 6, 10, 11].

 a condom [24]. Using models, it was estimated that the NNT to
avoid 1 HIV infection in the typical man who has sex with men
in the United States was 64; however, with high adherence, the
NNT dropped to 30 [25]. In a high-risk area with a 35% prev-
alence of HIV infection, the estimated NNT was 35, and the
NNT dropped to 17 with high adherence [25].
DISCUSSION
Based on the current evidence, we conclude that FTC-TDF for
PrEP for HIV infection favorably compares with aspirin in
terms of user safety. By comparing the NNH—the number of
people given an intervention to observe 1 adverse outcome—
for PrEP for HIV infection versus aspirin for cardiovascular
disease, fewer numbers of individuals taking PrEP will have
adverse outcomes when compared with those taking aspirin.
The safety of FTC-TDF as a component of combination antire-
troviral therapy is well studied among people living with HIV
infection. Careful monitoring of renal function and bone
metabolism is recommended due to FTC-TDF-associated ef-
fects on kidney function and bone density [12, 13]. However,
given that the approval by the FDA of FTC-TDF for PrEP for
HIV infection was in 2012, the long-term safety of FTC-TDF
use is unknown among people who are not infected with HIV.
CONCLUSIONS
Although there is an increasing awareness and uptake of FTC-
TDF for PrEP for HIV infection among some persons in high-
risk groups, additional measures are needed to identify at-risk
individuals and ensure they are offered PrEP for the prevention
of HIV infection [26–28].There are still clear barriers to the up-
take of PrEP for HIV infection, such as access, cost, acceptabil-
ity, adherence, and acceptance among medical providers [21,29,
30].However, given (1) that in some areas the number of people
needed to treat to avoid 1 HIV infection can be as low as 13, (2)
the favorable cost- and risk-benefit analyses in high-risk popu-
lations, and (3) new efforts to implement PrEP programs for
HIV prevention, the future looks optimistic, at least in some
parts of the country [21, 29, 31]. In San Francisco, it was report-
ed that participants in the iPrEx trial had good adherence due to
client-centered counseling, education, and strong relationships
with healthcare staff [29]. Furthermore, after being educated
about the potential of PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection,
a large majority of high-risk MSM reported intending to use
PrEP to prevent HIV infection, if available [32, 33]. Soon,
newer pharmacologic formulations of PrEP for HIV infection
are expected, including those with even better tolerance, safer
metabolic profile, and longer duration of action [30, 34].
Given the observed safety and efficacy of FTC-TDF for PrEP
for HIV infection and intent of the majority of high-risk
MSM to use PrEP, physicians should now actively look for pa-
tients who may benefit from it [35]. A “duty to prevent” sug-
gests that physicians should identify patients in their practice
with behaviors that might put them at risk for HIV infection
and offer PrEP routinely.
