In Brief
A panel of Zika virus-specific monoclonal
antibodies are developed that can
neutralize infection of the African, Asian,
and American strains. Of these,
antibodies that target the lateral ridge
epitope in the DIII region of the viral E
protein can confer in vivo protection in an
animal model of infection and may
represent a path for development of
prophylactic or therapeutic
antibodies in pregnancy or vaccines
against Zika virus.

SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has
emerged
as
a
global
public
health
problem
because of its ability to cause severe congenital
disease. Here, we developed six mouse mono-
clonal antibodies (mAbs) against ZIKV including
four (ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) that were
ZIKV specific and neutralized infection of African,
Asian, and American strains to varying degrees.
X-ray crystallographic and competition binding an-
alyses of Fab fragments and scFvs defined three
spatially distinct epitopes in DIII of the envelope
protein corresponding to the lateral ridge (ZV-54
and ZV-67), C-C’ loop (ZV-48 and ZV-64), and
ABDE sheet (ZV-2) regions. In vivo passive transfer
studies revealed protective activity of DIII-lateral
ridge specific neutralizing mAbs in a mouse model
of ZIKV infection. Our results suggest that DIII is
targeted by multiple type-specific antibodies with
distinct
neutralizing
activity,
which
provides
a
path for developing prophylactic antibodies for
use in pregnancy or designing epitope-specific
vaccines against ZIKV.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes species
mosquitoes, was originally identified in 1947 from a sentinel
rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda (Dick, 1952; Dick
et al., 1952). It is closely related to the four serotypes of
dengue (DENV) as well as other globally relevant viruses
including yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese
encephalitis (JEV) viruses (Lazear and Diamond, 2016). Since
its identification almost 70 years ago, there were few studies
of ZIKV until this past year, when large epidemics in the
Americas were accompanied by unexpectedly severe clinical
manifestations. Although in most instances ZIKV infection
results in a mild febrile illness associated with rash and
conjunctivitis, severe
neurological phenotypes have
been
described including Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome and meningoen-
cephalitis (Carteaux et al., 2016; Oehler et al., 2014). Infection
in pregnant women (Brasil et al., 2016) and mice (Cugola et al.,
2016; Li et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016) is now linked causally
to fetal abnormalities including microcephaly, spontaneous
abortion, and intrauterine growth restriction due to placental
insufficiency.
Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is a positive-sense RNA virus
with an �11-kilobase open reading frame flanked by 50 and
30 non-coding regions. The genome encodes a single polypro-
tein that is post-translationally cleaved by host and viral prote-
ases into three structural proteins (capsid [C], pre-membrane
[prM], and envelope [E]) and seven non-structural proteins. C
forms a nucleocapsid when bound to viral RNA; prM com-
plexes with E shortly after synthesis to facilitate folding and
prevent premature fusion to host membranes; and E mediates
viral assembly, attachment, entry, and fusion. The ZIKV E pro-
tein is divided into three domains: a central b-barrel domain
(domain I [DI]), an extended dimerization domain (DII), and
an immunoglobulin-like segment (DIII) (Dai et al., 2016). The
distal end of DII contains the fusion loop (FL), a hydrophobic
sequence that inserts into the host cell endosomal membrane
during
pH-dependent
conformational
changes
that
drive
fusion. Two high-resolution cryoelectron microscopic struc-
tures show that, like other flaviviruses, mature ZIKV virions
are smooth particles that incorporate 180 copies each of the
E and cleaved M proteins (Kostyuchenko et al., 2016; Sirohi
et al., 2016). As in DENV (Kuhn et al., 2002), the E proteins
of ZIKV pack as antiparallel dimers in a herringbone pattern
that lie relatively flat against the lipid envelope.
Neutralizing antibodies have important roles in the protec-
tion against infection by many flaviviruses and are considered

 correlates of protection for licensed YFV and tick-borne enceph-
alitis virus (TBEV) vaccines (Belmusto-Worn et al., 2005; Heinz
et al., 2007). The E protein is a primary antigenic target of neutral-
izing antibodies, which bind epitopes in all three structural do-
mains, with many type-specific protective antibodies recog-
nizing determinants in DIII (Beasley and Barrett, 2002; Oliphant
et al., 2005; Shrestha et al., 2010; Sukupolvi-Petty et al., 2010).
Potently neutralizing anti-flavivirus antibodies also recognize
complex quaternary epitopes composed of more than one
domain or E protein (de Alwis et al., 2012; Kaufmann et al.,
2010; Rouvinski et al., 2015). In comparison, antibodies that
recognize the fusion loop in DII are more cross-reactive and
neutralize flaviviruses less efficiently, although they may still
have protective activity in vivo (Cherrier et al., 2009; Dai et al.,
2016; Vogt et al., 2011).
In this study, we developed six mouse monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) against ZIKV after immunizing with live virus and boost-
ing with infectious virus or recombinant E proteins. Four of the
mAbs (ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) neutralized infection
of African, Asian, and American strains of ZIKV to varying de-
grees, whereas two (ZV-2 and ZV-13) inhibited infection poorly.
High-resolution crystal structures were determined for three
Fabs and one single-chain variable fragment (scFv) bound to
DIII, defining three non-overlapping conformational epitopes:
the lateral ridge (LR) (ZV-54 and ZV-67), the C-C0 loop (ZV-48
and ZV-64), and the ABDE sheet (ZV-2). In vivo passive transfer
studies in a lethal mouse model of ZIKV infection revealed pro-
tective activity of neutralizing DIII LR mAbs. Overall, our results
suggest that DIII is targeted by several different type-specific an-
tibodies with distinct neutralizing activities.
RESULTS
Generation of mAbs against ZIKV E Protein
To generate a panel of antibodies against ZIKV, we serially in-
fected Irf3�/� mice 30 days apart with ZIKV MR-766 (Uganda,
1947) and ZIKV H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013). Irf3�/�
mice were used instead of wild-type (WT) mice, because ZIKV
strains are deficient in evading type I interferon-mediated immu-
nity (Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). 3 days before
myeloma-splenocyte fusion, mice were boosted intravenously
with ZIKV H/PF/2013 or recombinant DIII (amino acids 299 to
407 of the ZIKV E protein). After screening �2,000 hybridomas,
we isolated six mAbs that recognized ZIKV E protein by ELISA
(Table 1).
We tested the mAbs for their specificity by evaluating reactivity
with cells infected by ZIKV, DENV (all four serotypes), or JEV. Five
of the mAbs (ZV-2, ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) were ZIKV
specific and did not recognize DENV- or JEV-infected cells by
flow cytometry (Figure 1A; data not shown); these mAbs all bound
to recombinant ZIKV DIII in a direct ELISA (Figure 1B). In contrast,
ZV-13 was cross-reactive and bound to cells infected with all se-
rotypes of DENV (Figure 1A). Consistent with these data, only ZV-
13 bound to WNV E protein, as detected by ELISA (Figure 1B). ZV-
13 recognized the conserved FL in DII, as binding was lost to a
ZIKV E protein with mutations in highly conserved residues within
and immediately proximal to the FL (Figure 1B).
Neutralizing Activity against ZIKV In Vitro
We evaluated the mAbs for their ability to inhibit ZIKV H/PF/2013
infection. Four (ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) of the six mAbs

aTo generate mAbs, mice were infected and boosted with 103 FFU of ZIKV (MR-766 and H/PF/2013, respectively) and given a final intravenous boost
with live ZIKV (H/PF/2013) or purified DIII.
bmAb isotype was determined using a commercial ELISA kit.
cDomain localization and epitope was determined by binding to WT or mutant recombinant proteins or X-ray crystallography (Figures 1 and 3).

or controls (WNV E60 [flavivirus cross-reactive] and WNV E24 [WNV type-specific]). Binding was determined by ELISA and the results are representative of two
independent experiments performed in triplicate.

concentrations of mAbs for 1 hr at 37�C prior to infection of Vero cells. Subsequently, an FRNT assay was performed (Experimental Procedures). The results
reflect pooled data from two or more independent experiments performed in triplicate.

 had neutralizing activity, whereas two (ZV-2 and ZV-13) did not
inhibit infection appreciably (Figure 1C). To determine the
breadth of their activity, the mAbs were evaluated for inhibition
of infection by three other ZIKV isolates including two African
(MR-766, Uganda, 1947 and Dakar 41519, Senegal, 1982) and
an American (Paraiba, Brazil, 2015) strain. Whereas ZV-54 and
ZV-67 neutralized all four ZIKV strains, ZV-48 and ZV-64 had
reduced inhibitory activity against the other tested strains (Fig-
ure 1C; Table 1).
Binding Characteristics of Anti-ZIKV mAbs
We next assessed whether the variation in neutralizing activity
among our antibodies could be explained by differences in bind-
ing to the ZIKV E protein derived from H/PF/2013. Based on the
ELISA data (Figure 1B), we tested the mAbs for binding to a re-
combinant DIII produced in E. coli using biolayer interferometry
(BLI) (Figure 2A; Table 1) or, for the fusion-loop epitope binding
ZV-13, the monomeric form of the ectodomain of E expressed
in mammalian cells (Figure S1; Table 1). These biophysical ana-
lyses showed that mAbs with stronger neutralizing capacity had
greater binding affinities for recombinant proteins. The best
neutralizing antibodies, ZV-54 and ZV-67, had the highest affin-
ities with KD equilibrium values less than 10 nM. These two mAbs
also showed the slowest dissociation rates, with half-lives of
33 and 13.8 min, respectively. The mAbs with intermediate
neutralizing capacity, ZV-64 and ZV-48, had lower affinities,
with KD equilibrium values around 35 nM, and more rapid off
rates, having half-lives of 1 and 3.2 min, respectively. ZV-2 and
ZV-13, which do not inhibit infection appreciably, showed
weaker binding, with KD equilibrium values >250 nM.
Based on the interactions of individual mAbs with purified ZIKV
proteins, we speculated that differences in the stoichiometry of

(A) Quantitative analysis of DIII binding to anti-ZIKV mAbs by BLI. Shown in the top panel are binding curves obtained by passing different concentrations of DIII
over biotinylated anti-ZIKV antibody immobilized on a biosensor surface. The kinetic values were obtained by simultaneously fitting the association and
dissociation responses to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (KD, kinetic). The lower panels show the steady-state analysis results (KD, equilibrium). Plotted in the
bottom panels (open circles) is the binding response (nm) versus concentration of DIII offered. In each case, the binding was saturable. Bottom insets, Scatchard
plots suggest a single binding affinity for each interaction. The data are representative of two independent experiments per mAb.

experiment of two is shown. Error bars indicate the range of duplicate technical replicates.

 binding to the viral particle, which also is a function of epitope
accessibility (Pierson et al., 2007), might correlate with our neutral-
ization data. To test this idea, we captured purified ZIKV
subviral particles (SVPs, prM-E) on 96-well plates and analyzed
binding of biotinylated detection mAbs over a range of concen-
trations. There was an association between the functional
avidity of binding and the ability to neutralize infection: ZV-
67 and ZV-54 bound more avidly than did ZV-2 and ZV-13
(Figure 2B). These data also showed that even at the highest con-
centrations tested, ZV-2 and ZV-13 failed to saturate binding to
the SVPs.
We confirmed these results with pseudo-infectious reporter vi-
rus particles (RVPs) in a functional assay. Antibody-mediated
neutralization requires engagement of the virions by antibody
with a stoichiometry sufficient for neutralization. Antibody-
dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) occurs following
engagement of the virion by fewer antibody molecules and
thus represents a sensitive functional probe for antibody binding
to an infectious virion. We evaluated the antibody concentration
dependence and magnitude of ADE of ZIKV and DENV by our
anti-ZIKV mAbs using an established assay (Pierson et al.,
2007) in Fcg receptor II (FcgRII, CD32A) expressing human
K562 cells. While all ZIKV mAbs enhanced infection to varying
degrees, those which bound SVPs weakly (e.g., ZV-2) only sup-
ported FcgRII-mediated infection at high concentrations (Fig-
ure 2C). Reciprocally, as described previously for WNV anti-
bodies (Pierson et al., 2007), the most inhibitory anti-ZIKV
mAbs (ZV-54 and ZV-67) exhibited ADE, but this occurred only
at sub-neutralizing concentrations. These experiments also
corroborated the type-specificity of the mAbs, as only ZV-13
supported ADE of DENV. This latter observation suggests that
at least some ZIKV-specific antibodies generated during natural
infection can enhance DENV infection in vitro.
Structures of ZIKV Antibodies in Complex with DIII
To gain insight into the basis for differential binding and neutral-
ization of the ZIKV mAbs, we generated Fab fragments or scFvs
and undertook crystal screening using DIII of ZIKV H/PF/2013.
X-ray crystal structures were obtained for four antibody com-
plexes with DIII: ZV-2 Fab to 1.7-A
˚ resolution, ZV-48 scFv to
1.7-A
˚ resolution, ZV-64 Fab to 1.4-A
˚ resolution, and ZV-67 Fab
to 1.4-A
˚ resolution (Figure 3A; data collection and refinement
statistics in Table S1 and antibody-antigen structural analysis
in Tables S2, S3, and S4). In all four complexes, ZIKV DIII adopts
a conserved structure nearly identical to that observed in soluble
E dimers (Dai et al., 2016) as well as mature virions (Kostyu-
chenko et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016) with variation observed
primarily at the N- and C-terminal regions of the domain. Analysis
of antibody contact residues indicates that ZV-2 and ZV-67 bind-
ing is dominated by heavy chain complementarity determining
region (CDR) usage, whereas ZV-48 and ZV-64, which appear
to be siblings and engage DIII in a similar manner, primarily
use light-chain CDRs (Table S2, S3, and S4; Figure S2). Notably,
10 of 12 light chain CDR contact residues are identical in ZV-48
and ZV-64, whereas only 2 of 11 heavy-chain CDR residues are
the same, with the most significant difference in the short CDR-
H3 of ZV-48 that makes more contact with DIII than the long
CDR-H3 found in ZV-64 (Figures 3A and S2). Comparison of
the sequences of ZV-67 with ZV-54, for the latter of which we
lack structural data, suggests that they bind DIII very similarly,

DIII is colored dark blue with contact segments

(B) Docking of the ZV-2, ZV-48, and ZV-64 com-
plexes onto ZV-67-DIII. DIII is rendered as a mo-
lecular surface with each mAb contact surface
color coded. Simultaneous docking of ZV-2 and
ZV-67 with either ZV-48 or ZV-64 buries nearly half
of the solvent surface of DIII and creates no van
der Waal contacts between adjacent mAbs.
(C) Five mAbs were probed for competitive and
non-competitive binding against the DIII antigen
by BLI. In one experiment, biotin-labeled ZV-67
was captured on the streptavidin sensor, the
antibody was then loaded with ZIKV DIII followed
by either ZV-54 or ZV-64, and finally, ZV-2 was
added. In another experiment, ZV-48 was immo-
bilized and ZV-64 or ZV-67 was added after DIII
followed by ZV-2. Additional BLI signal indicates
an unoccupied epitope (non-competitor), whereas
no binding indicates epitope blocking (competition). In this experiment, ZV-48 competed with ZIKV-64 as expected given that they both bind nearly identical
epitopes, while ZV-67 competed with its presumed sibling clone ZV-54. A dash (-) represents that no 2nd or 3rd antibody was offered.

 as only two contact residues differ, CDR-L3 Tyr/PheL96 and
CDR-H1 Ser/ThrH31.
ZIKV mAbs Bind Three Spatially Distinct Epitopes on DIII
Analysis of the docking of our mAbs onto DIII indicates that ZV-2
and ZV-67 binding should not compete with ZV-48 or ZV-64
binding, whereas ZV-48 and ZV-64 should compete with each
other (Figure 3B). To evaluate this prediction experimentally,
we set up a competitive BLI assay (Figure 3C). When ZV-67
was immobilized, we observed that both ZV-64 and ZV-2 could
bind in a DIII-dependent manner. In contrast, ZV-54 binding was
excluded, supporting the idea that ZV-67 and ZV-54 recognize
the same DIII determinants. Analogously, immobilized ZV-48 al-
lowed for the binding of ZV-67 and ZV-2 after DIII capture, but
ZV-64 was blocked competitively. This analysis strongly sup-
ports our structural observations and defines three distinct
ZIKV type-specific epitopes on DIII.
ZIKV DIII Epitope Mapping
We examined the precise footprints of our mAbs on ZIKV DIII
(Figure 4A and 4B). ZV-2 binds to a large, fairly flat surface on
the exposed face of the ABDE b sheet of DIII (Table S2). The
ABDE sheet epitope is highly conserved among ZIKV sequences
but many of the primary contacts diverge in other flaviviruses.
Previous structural studies of the DENV cross-reactive mAb
2H12 revealed that it contacts six of the same residue positions,
especially near the A-B loop (Midgley et al., 2012). ZV-48 and ZV-
64 both engage the C- and C0-b strands and connecting loop,

residues are colored as in (A), with side chains drawn as sticks and labeled if they make eight or more van der Waals contacts.

 which project away from the b sandwich core of DIII. The C-C0
loop epitope recognized by ZV-48 and ZV-64 is remarkably
similar to that engaged by the DENV-1 type-specific antibody
E111 (Austin et al., 2012), with 9 structurally related positions
contacted (Figure 4A).
The epitope recognized by ZV-67 is created by four discrete
secondary structure elements: the A-strand, B-C loop, D-E
loop, and F-G loop. A total of 21 residues are contacted by
ZV-67, with only one difference between the two ZIKV immu-
nizing strains (EE393 in H/PF/2013, DE393 in MR-766). This epitope
region has been termed the LR and was described in relation to
the binding of the potently neutralizing E16 mAb to WNV DIII (Ny-
bakken et al., 2005). Notably, 13 contact positions of E16 and
WNV DIII are shared by ZV-67 (Figure 4A). DV1-E106 is another
mAb recognizing the LR-epitope (Edeling et al., 2014), and it
shares 10 contact positions with ZV-67, four of which are
conserved in the B-C loops of WNV and ZIKV. Another related
DIII epitope (termed the A-strand) has been described for two
DENV-complex-specific mAbs, 1A1D-2 (Lok et al., 2008) and
4E11 (Cockburn et al., 2012) (Figure 4A). These A-strand epitope
binding mAbs do not make significant contact with the B-C or
F-G loop residues engaged by LR-epitope mAbs. Collectively,
the three distinct ABDE sheet, C-C0 loop, and LR epitopes recog-
nized by our mAbs represent nearly one half of the total ZIKV DIII
surface area with no overlap in the contact residues.
Exposed and Cryptic ZIKV Epitopes
We docked our mAb-DIII structures onto the cryoelectron micro-
scopy (cryo-EM)-derived model of the mature ZIKV virion (Kos-
tyuchenko et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016). Whereas the LR
epitope for ZV-67 was accessible on the mature virion (Fig-
ure 5A), the C-C0 loop and ABDE sheet epitopes were occluded
almost completely in all three symmetry environments. We next
examined the exposure of the ABDE sheet epitope on the E ec-
todomain crystal structure (Dai et al., 2016) and found that Fab
binding is blocked sterically due to the adjacent positioning of
DI (Figure 5B). Furthermore, dimerization of E would preclude
ZV-2 mAb binding as its CDR loops contact several of the
same DIII residues that are contacted by DII residues in the
dimer. Examination of the binding of ZV-64 reveals that it likely
engages the cryptic C-C0 loop epitope in a manner similar to
the DENV-1 specific mAb DV1-E111 (Austin et al., 2012) (Figures
5C and 5D). Residues on the C-C0 loop are intimately involved in
lateral E protein contacts on the mature virion, so their exposure
would require substantial reorganization of the particle, which
perhaps could occur locally rather than globally. Our most potent
mAbs, ZV-67 and ZV-54, recognize the LR epitope in a manner
similar to WNV-E16, which can bind up to 120 of the 180 copies
of DIII on the mature virion (Kaufmann et al., 2006; Nybakken
et al., 2005) (Figures 5C and 5E). This is the same stoichiometry
observed for the binding of the A-strand-specific mAb 1A1D-2

The surface distribution of the ABDE sheet (green),
C-C0 loop (cyan), and LR (magenta) epitopes are
rendered on the three symmetrically unique E
proteins colored olive, wheat, and gray. While the
ABDE sheet and C-C0 loop epitopes are domi-
nantly buried in all three symmetry environments,
the LR epitope is solvent accessible on the mature
virion.
(B) Docking of the ZV-2-DIII complex onto the
crystal structure of dimeric ZIKV (5JHM) (Dai et al.,
2016). Shown above is the ZV-2 Fab docked to a
soluble E monomer, which indicates that the ABDE
sheet epitope is occluded by DI with clashes by the
VH domain. Below, the ZIKV dimer is depicted,
showing how it would sterically clash with the ZV-2
VL domain. ZV-2 CDR loops contact several of the
same DIII residues that are contacted by the DII
fusion loop in the dimer.
(C) Docking of the ZV-64-DIII and ZV-67-DIII
complexes onto the cryoelectron microscopy
model of the M-E dimer that forms the mature
virion. ZV-67 binding to the LR epitope allows for
the projection of the Fab away from the viral
membrane whereas ZV-64 binding to the C-C0 loop
epitope positions the Fab in the plane of the viral
envelope and membrane.
(D) Comparative docking of the DV1-E111 Fab-DIII
complex (Austin et al., 2012) onto the cryptic C-C0
loop epitope suggests similar steric clashes as
predicted for ZV-64.

 (Lok et al., 2008), which like 4E11 (Cockburn et al., 2012), can
broadly neutralize multiple DENV serotypes (Figure 5F). The
clustering of DIII LR epitopes around the 5-fold axis of symmetry
appears to preclude binding at this site (Figure 5A), although mi-
nor repacking of the interface could lead to possible binding
(Edeling et al., 2014).
In Vivo Protection Studies
Recently, we and others have generated in vivo models of ZIKV
pathogenesis in mice deficient in type I IFN signaling (Lazear
et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). To evaluate whether neutralizing
mAbs protected against ZIKV infection in vivo, we treated 4- to
5-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice at day �1 with anti-Ifnar (2 mg)
and anti-ZIKV or isotype control mAbs (250 mg) and then infected
animalsatday0withanAfricanZIKVstrainthatismorepathogenic
in mice than isolates from Asia or the Americas (Lazear et al.,
2016). Treatment of mice with anti-Ifnar mAb and a non-binding
isotype control mAb (CHIKV-166) resulted in high levels of ZIKV
RNA in serum at day 3 (Figure 6A) and significant weight loss
and mortality (Figures 6B and 6C). In comparison, treatment with
anti-Ifnar mAb and the DIII LR mAbs ZIKV-54 or ZIKV-67 resulted
in reduced viremia and complete clinical protection. Consistent
with a recent vaccine study that showed antibody-mediated pro-
tection against ZIKV viremia in BALB/c mice (Larocca et al., 2016),
our neutralizing anti-ZIKV mAbs can protect against lethal ZIKV
infection in IFN-deficient C57BL/6 mice. This model is a stringent
test of protection, since in humans, the overwhelming majority of
infections does not result in lethality.
DISCUSSION
We set out to develop a panel of mAbs against ZIKV that could
provide insight into epitopes that are recognized by neutralizing
antibodies. After inoculating mice with infectious ZIKV, we
generated and characterized a panel of ZIKV-specific mAbs at
both the functional and structural level. Four of the mAbs were
ZIKV specific, bound to sites within DIII, and neutralized infection
of a contemporary Asian strain of ZIKV. Whereas ZV-54 and ZV-
67 neutralized other ZIKV strains efficiently, ZV-48 and ZV-64
showed reduced inhibitory activity against American and African
ZIKV strains. Sequence analysis of the VL region of ZV-48 and
ZV-64 suggest they are sibling clones, although the VH domains
of the IgG heavy chains are distinct and make little contact with
DIII. In comparison, the functionally related ZV-54 and ZV-67
mAbs have highly similar VL and VH sequences (Figure S2).
From these analyses, we defined three spatially distinct type-
specific epitopes on ZIKV DIII (LR, C-C0 loop, and ABDE sheet)
with functionally different properties. Finally, in vivo passive
transfer studies revealed protective activity of ZV-54 and ZV-
67 against an African ZIKV strain in a lethal challenge model in
mice.
Type-specific protective and neutralizing mAbs in DIII have
been observed in studies with other flaviviruses. As no other
ZIKV-specific mAbs have been described to date, it remains un-
certain whether the DIII epitopes reported here are immunodo-
minant in humans. However, antibodies to DIII, which is promi-
nently displayed on the surface of flaviviruses (Pierson and
Diamond, 2013), appear less dominant in the human response
against other flaviviruses (Beltramello et al., 2010; Jarmer
et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2013). The structures of three other an-
tibodies with reactivity against ZIKV have been published
recently. Dai et al. (2016) described the 3.0-A
˚ structure of ZIKV
E protein in complex with a cross-reactive murine antibody,
2A10G6. This antibody bound the highly conserved FL in DII
and was poorly neutralizing (PRNT50 of 249 mg/mL) yet still pro-
tected mice against lethal ZIKV infection. ZV-13 had a similar
neutralizing profile in vitro and also bound to a DII-FL epitope.
Barba-Spaeth et al. (2016) reported 2.4-A
˚ and 2.6-A
˚ structures
of ZIKV E protein complexed with Fab fragments of C8 or A11 an-
tibodies, both of which recognize EDE dimer epitopes (Rouvinski
et al., 2015). Although these cross-reactive anti-DENV anti-
bodies inhibited ZIKV infection efficiently (FRNT50 of �14 and
135 ng/mL, respectively, against H/PF/2013), no protection ex-
periments with C8 or A11 and ZIKV were undertaken in animals.
Three of our mAbs recognized cryptic epitopes in the ABDE
sheet (ZV-2) and C-C0 loop (ZV-48 and ZV-64) on DIII, which
are not predicted to be accessible on the mature virion (Kostyu-
chenko et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016). So how were these anti-
bodies generated in vivo? ZV-48 and ZV-64 were the product
of serial infections with two different strains of ZIKV (MR-766
and H/PF/2013) and a final 3-day boost with purified DIII prior
to fusion and hybridoma generation. While it is possible that

mice for each treatment condition.

 ZV-48 and ZV-64 were selected against the recombinant protein
during the last boost, given the extensive somatic hypermutation
seen in the sequences (Figure S2), it seems more likely that viral
breathing (Dowd et al., 2011) allows exposure of the C-C0 loop,
as observed previously for a neutralizing DENV-1 mAb (Austin
et al., 2012). For ZV-2, it is more difficult to comprehend, as
this mAb was a product only of prime-boosts with infectious
ZIKV MR-766 and H/PF/2013. Other possible ways to generate
antibodies against cryptic epitopes include exposure of the
epitope on partially mature viruses, SVPs, ‘‘broken’’ viral parti-
cles, or cleaved soluble envelope proteins.
The two mAbs (ZV-48 and ZV-64) that bound to the C-C0 loop
showed reduced neutralizing activity against the American and
African strains. Sequence alignment of the C-C0 loop contact
residues in DIII of all four tested strains failed to reveal an expla-
nation for the loss of inhibitory activity relative to the Asian H/PF/
2013 ZIKV strain. Only a single amino acid change (A343V) in the
crystallographic footprint was identified in MR-766 and Dakar
41671, and this substitution was not present in the Paraiba,
2015 sequence. This phenotype is similar to a neutralizing mAb
(DV1-E111) that bound the C-C0 loop of DENV-1 DIII, in which
we observed a genotype-dependent pattern of neutralization
(Austin et al., 2012) that mapped to a single conservative amino
acid substitution in DII remote from the footprint of the epitope
(Dowd et al., 2015).
We observed protection in vivo by DIII LR neutralizing mAbs
(ZV-54 and ZV-67). This result is similar to that observed for other
DIII LR mAbs against flaviviruses that protected against lethal
infection by WNV (Oliphant et al., 2005), DENV-1 (Shrestha
et al., 2010), or DENV-2 (Sukupolvi-Petty et al., 2010). Although
mechanistic studies with ZV-54 and ZV-67 remain to be per-
formed, protective mAbs against WNV and DENV that bound
the DIII LR epitope inhibited infection at a post-attachment stage
including blocking viral fusion from the endosome (Thompson
et al., 2009).
A key question remains whether neutralizing antibodies will
protect pregnant women and their developing fetuses from
ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, including micro-
cephaly. Although we and others have developed models of
infection of pregnant mice with resultant injury to the fetus (Cu-
gola et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016), we chose not to perform
such protection studies because mice, in contrast to many other
mammalian species, lack expression of the neonatal Fc receptor
(FcRn) on their trophoblasts in the chorioallantoic placenta (Kim
et al., 2009). Rather, FcRn is expressed in the mouse yolk sac
endoderm, and thus, the transfer of IgG in mice is believed to
be predominantly postnatal (Pentsuk and van der Laan, 2009).
As reduced levels of transport of maternal or exogenous IgG
into the fetus occur in mice, protection by a given antibody
may be underestimated. Passive antibody transfer studies dur-
ing pregnancy may require experiments in mammals with more
similar placental anatomy that are susceptible to ZIKV infection
(e.g., nonhuman primates).
Our studies identify ZIKV DIII as a potential target of neutral-
izing antibodies and thus a possible immunogen for vaccines.
DIII has been used previously in the context of different flavivi-
rus vaccines (Martina et al., 2008; Schneeweiss et al., 2011).
Although neutralizing antibodies are generated in several ani-
mal species in response to soluble DIII immunogens, the titers
have been lower than expected, possibly because of immuno-
dominance of regions of DIII that normally are inaccessible on
the viral particle. Alternatively, the mouse VH-CDR3 regions
are shorter and vary in amino acid composition compared to
other species (Shi et al., 2014), which could impact immundo-
minance against DIII epitopes in a species-specific manner.
Our structural analysis provides a hierarchy of neutralization
efficacy associated with distinct epitopes on DIII. Masking of
epitopes that fail to elicit neutralizing antibodies could be
combined with epitope-focused vaccine design approaches
(Correia et al., 2014) to generate DIII variants that induce
more protective responses.
In summary, we identified a panel of type-specific ZIKV mAbs,
several of which bind to distinct regions on DIII and have dispa-
rate functional activities. Type-specific anti-ZIKV mAbs could be
useful for diagnostic assays that distinguish ZIKV antigens from
closely related flaviviruses, including DENV. Alternatively, their
characterization may provide a path forward for developing pro-
phylactic antibodies for use in pregnancy, for therapeutic anti-
bodies to potentially prevent viral persistence, or for the design
of domain and minimal epitope-specific vaccines against ZIKV
infection.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH. The protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
Washington University School of Medicine.
Viruses
ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013) was obtained from X. de Lam-
ballerie (Aix Marseille Universite
´ ). ZIKV Brazil Paraiba 2015 was provided by S.
Whitehead (Bethesda) and originally obtained from P.F.C. Vasconcelos
(Instituto Evandro Chagas). ZIKV MR-766 (Uganda, 1947) and Dakar 41519
(Senegal, 1982) were provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging Vi-
ruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh, University of Texas Medical Branch). Nicara-
guan DENV strains (DENV-1 1254-4, DENV-2 172-08, DENV-3 N2845-09, and
DENV-4 N703-99) were generously provided by E. Harris (University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley). Virus stocks were propagated in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells
(Lazear et al., 2016). ZIKV Dakar 41519 was passaged in vivo in Rag1�/� mice
(M.J.G. and M.S.D., unpublished data) and a brain homogenate was used. Vi-
rus stocks were titrated by focus-forming assay (FFA) on Vero cells as
described (Brien et al., 2013).
mAb Generation
Irf3�/� mice were infected and boosted with 103 FFU of ZIKV (MR-766 and H/
PF/2013, respectively) and given a final intravenous boost with infectious 106
FFU of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) or purified DIII 3 days prior to fusion with
P3X63.Ag.6.5.3 myeloma cells. Hybridomas secreting antibodies that reacted
with ZIKV-infected Vero cells were cloned by limiting dilution. All mAbs were
purified by protein A affinity chromatography. The VH and VL sequences of
mAbs were amplified from hybridoma cell RNA by a 50 RACE procedure.
ZIKV mAb Domain Mapping by ELISA
A MAXISORP 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 50 mL of 2 mg/mL of recom-
binant ZIKV E, ZIKV E-FL (fusion-loop mutant), ZIKV DIII, WNV-E, or DV4-E
overnight at 4�C. Plates were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% Tween
20 followed by incubation with PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.02% Tween 20 for 1 hr
at 37�C. MAbs (0.5 mg/mL) were added for 1 hr at room temperature.
Plates were washed again and then sequentially incubated with 2 mg/mL of
1024
Cell 166, 1016–1027, August 11, 2016
 HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The re-
action was stopped by the addition of 1 N H2SO4 to the medium, and emission
(450 nm) was read using an iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
Neutralization Assays
Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 100 FFU of different ZIKV for 1
hour at 37�C. mAb-virus complexes were added to Vero cell monolayers in
96-well plates. After 90 min, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose
in MEM supplemented with 4% FBS. Plates were harvested 40 hr later and
fixed with 1% PFA in PBS. The plates were incubated sequentially with
500 ng/mL of ZV-16 (E.F., unpublished data) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-
mouse IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% BSA. ZIKV-in-
fected foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and
quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 macroanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).
mAb Binding to Flavivirus-Infected Cells
Vero or C6/36 cells were inoculated with different flaviviruses in DMEM supple-
mented with 10 mM HEPES, penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% FBS. At
different time points after infection (ZIKV H/PF/2013, MOI of 5, 24 hr, Vero
cells; DENV strains, MOI of 0.01, 120 hr, C6/36 cells), cells were fixed with
4% PFA diluted in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized
with HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% saponin (Sigma), and 0.025% NaN3 for
10 min at room temperature. Fifty-thousand cells were transferred to a U-bot-
tom plate and incubated for 1 hr at 4�C with 5 mg/mL of anti-ZIKV mAbs or
isotype controls (negative, CHK-166 [Pal et al., 2013]; positive, WNV E53
[Oliphant et al., 2006]). After washing, cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor
647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), fixed in 1% PFA in PBS, pro-
cessed on a FACS Array (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using FlowJo soft-
ware (Tree Star).
Biolayer Interferometry Binding Assays
The binding affinity of purified ZIKV E or ZIKV DIII protein with ZIKV mAbs was
monitored by BLI using an Octet-Red96 device (Pall ForteBio). Briefly, 100 mg
of each antibody was mixed with biotin (EZ-Link-NHS-PEG4-Biotin, Thermo
Fisher) at a molar ratio of 20:1 biotin:protein and incubated at room tempera-
ture for 30 min. The unreacted biotin was removed by passage through a de-
salting column (5 mL Zeba Spin 7K MWCO, Thermo Fisher). The antibodies
were loaded onto streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio) until saturation, typically
2 mg/mL for 3 min, in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,
and 0.005% P20 surfactant with 3% BSA. Association and dissociation
were measured at 25�C for all mAbs. The real-time data were analyzed using
Biaevaluation 4.1 (GE Healthcare). Association and dissociation profiles, as
well as steady-state equilibrium concentration curves, were fitted using a
1:1 binding model.
SVP Production and Binding Assay
ZIKV SVPs were generated as described previously for WNV (Hanna et al.,
2005). Briefly, a plasmid encoding the prM-E gene of ZIKV H/PF/2013 was
transfected into HEK293T cells. SVPs were harvested every 24 hr and stored
aliquoted at �80�C. 96-well high-binding plates (Immulon 4HBX; Thermo Sci-
entific) were coated with 1 mg/mL of ZV-67 in coating buffer (15 mM sodium
carbonate, 35 mM sodium bicarbonate [pH 9.6]) overnight at 4�C. Plates
were blocked with PBS-T + 1.5% BSA, followed by capture of SVPs diluted
in blocking buffer for 1 hr at 37�C. Plates were incubated with the indicated
concentrations of biotin-conjugated mAbs for 30 min at 37�C, followed by in-
cubation with 30 ng/mL streptavidin-HRP for 30 min at 37�C. The plates were
developed with SureBlue TMB substrate (KPL) and stopped with 1 M HCl.
Plates were analyzed at 450 nm, with a 570 nm correction (BioTek).
ADE Studies
RVP production and ADE assays were performed using approaches detailed in
prior studies with WNV and DENV RVPs (Dowd et al., 2011; Pierson et al.,
2007) using plasmids expressing the C-prM-E genes of ZIKV H/PF/2013 or
DENV-2 16681 and a plasmid encoding a WNV replicon expressing GFP.
Infection of human K562 cells were carried out at 37�C and GFP-positive in-
fected cells were detected by flow cytometry 48 hr later.
Mouse Protection Experiments
C57BL/6 mice (4- to 5-week-old, Jackson Laboratories) were inoculated with
ZIKV by subcutaneous (footpad) route with 105 FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV Da-
kar in a volume of 50 mL. One day prior, mice were treated with 2 mg of an Ifnar-
blocking mAb (MAR1-5A3) by intraperitoneal injection (Lazear et al., 2016). ZIKV
mAbs were administered as a single 250 ug dose 1 day before infection via an
intraperitoneal route. Serum samples were obtained at day 3 after ZIKV infection
and extracted with the Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). ZIKV RNA levels were deter-
mined by TaqMan one-step qRT-PCR on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using
published primers and conditions (Lanciotti et al., 2008).
Statistical Analysis
All virological data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Kaplan-Meier
survival curves were analyzed by the log rank test, and weight losses and
viremia were compared using an ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test. A
p value of <0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. SVP ELISA data
were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis using a one-site binding model.
