Abstract
BACKGROUND—The up-regulation of P-selectin in endothelial cells and platelets contributes to 
the cell–cell interactions that are involved in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion and sickle cell–
related pain crises. The safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab, an antibody against the adhesion 
molecule P-selectin, were evaluated in patients with sickle cell disease.
METHODS—In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, we assigned 
patients to receive low-dose crizanlizumab (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight), high-dose 
crizanlizumab (5.0 mg per kilogram), or placebo, administered intravenously 14 times over a 
period of 52 weeks. Patients who were receiving concomitant hydroxyurea as well as those not 
receiving hydroxyurea were included in the study. The primary end point was the annual rate of 
sickle cell–related pain crises with high-dose crizanlizumab versus placebo. The annual rate of 
days hospitalized, the times to first and second crises, annual rates of uncomplicated crises 
(defined as crises other than the acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, 
or priapism) and the acute chest syndrome, and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed.
RESULTS—A total of 198 patients underwent randomization at 60 sites. The median rate of 
crises per year was 1.63 with high-dose crizanlizumab versus 2.98 with placebo (indicating a 
45.3% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab, P = 0.01). The median time to the first crisis was 
significantly longer with high-dose crizanlizumab than with placebo (4.07 vs. 1.38 months, P = 
0.001), as was the median time to the second crisis (10.32 vs. 5.09 months, P = 0.02). The median 
rate of uncomplicated crises per year was 1.08 with high-dose crizanlizumab, as compared with 
2.91 with placebo (indicating a 62.9% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab, P = 0.02). 
Adverse events that occurred in 10% or more of the patients in either active-treatment group and at 
a frequency that was at least twice as high as that in the placebo group were arthralgia, diarrhea, 
pruritus, vomiting, and chest pain.

 CONCLUSIONS—In patients with sickle cell disease, crizanlizumab therapy resulted in a 
significantly lower rate of sickle cell–related pain crises than placebo and was associated with a 
low incidence of adverse events. (Funded by Selexys Pharmaceuticals and others; SUSTAIN 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01895361.)
Sickle cell disease is characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS), chronic 
hemolysis, recurrent pain episodes (called sickle cell–related pain crises or vaso-occlusive 
crises), multiorgan dysfunction, and early death. Sickle cell–related pain crises are the 
primary cause of health care encounters in patients with sickle cell disease.1 These crises 
result in a decrease in quality of life2 and an increase in the risk of death.3 Crises are thought 
to be caused by vascular occlusion in the microcirculation, increased inflammation, and 
alterations in nociception.4 The prevention of crises could minimize or prevent tissue and 
organ damage and decrease the subsequent risk of death among patients with sickle cell 
disease.
Although polymerization of deoxygenated HbS is the primary event in the pathophysiology 
of sickle cell disease,5 the pathogenesis of vasoocclusion is complex. Vaso-occlusion is 
caused by the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes and leukocytes to the endothelium, which 
results in vascular obstruction and tissue ischemia.6 The degree of sickle erythrocyte 
adhesion correlates with vaso-occlusion and increased severity of disease.7 Activated and 
adherent leukocytes are the likely drivers of vaso-occlusion in collecting venules, whereas 
sickle erythrocytes may contribute to the occlusion of smaller vessels.8 In addition, platelets 
can bind to erythrocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils to form aggregates, 9,10 which 
contribute to abnormalities of blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease.11
Although the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation can involve 
multiple molecules, the process is initiated by P-selectin.12 P-selectin is found in storage 
granules of resting endothelial cells and platelets and is rapidly transferred to the cell 
membrane on activation of the cell during processes such as inflammation. P-selectin that is 
expressed on the surface of the endothelium mediates abnormal rolling and static adhesion 
of sickle erythrocytes to the vessel surface in vitro.13,14 Translocation of endothelial P-
selectin to the cell surface results in the prompt adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to vessels 
and the development of vascular occlusion in transgenic mice with sickle cell disease.15 
Furthermore, activated platelets bind to neutrophils to form aggregates in a P-selectin–
dependent manner in mice and humans with sickle cell disease.16
Transgenic mice with sickle cell disease that are deficient in P-selectin and E-selectin have 
defective leukocyte recruitment to the vessel wall and are protected from vaso-occlusion.17 
In addition, the adherence of sickle erythrocytes and leukocytes to the endothelium is 
substantially reduced when P-selectin is blocked in transgenic mice expressing human 
HbS.15,18 Furthermore, doses of heparin that are sufficient to block P-selectin increase 
microvascular blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease.19 These data support the 
concept that blockade of P-selectin could reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion, inflammation, 
and sickle cell–related pain crises.

 Crizanlizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin and blocks its 
interaction with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). Here we report the results of 
SUSTAIN (Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, 12-
Month Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Crizanlizumab (SelG1) with or without 
Hydroxyurea Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease Patients with Sickle Cell–Related Pain Crises), 
a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to assess the 
safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab, with or without hydroxyurea therapy, in patients with 
sickle cell disease. The primary goal of the trial was to determine the effect of crizanlizumab 
therapy on the rate of sickle cell–related crises during 52 weeks of treatment.
Methods
PATIENTS
Patients with sickle cell disease (homozygous hemoglobin S [HbSS], sickle hemoglobin C 
disease [HbSC], sickle β0-thalassemia [HbSβ0-thalassemia], sickle β+-thalassemia [HbSβ+-
thalassemia], or other genotypes) who were 16 to 65 years of age and who had had 2 to 10 
sickle cell–related pain crises in the 12 months before enrollment in the trial were eligible. 
Patients who were receiving hydroxyurea therapy were required to have been receiving the 
drug for at least 6 months, including taking a stable dose for at least the most recent 3 
months, and they were not allowed to have any dose alteration during the 52-week treatment 
phase of the study, except for safety reasons. If patients were not receiving hydroxyurea, it 
could not be initiated. Patients who were undergoing long-term red-cell transfusion therapy 
were excluded. The full list of eligibility criteria is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All the patients provided 
written informed consent before enrolling in the trial.
TRIAL DESIGN
The trial consisted of a 30-day screening phase, a 52-week treatment phase, and a 6-week 
follow-up evaluation phase. Randomization was performed centrally on the basis of a block 
design, with stratification according to the number of crises in the preceding year (2 to 4 or 5 
to 10) and concomitant hydroxyurea use (yes or no). Patients were assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 
by an interactive Web-or voice-response system to receive low-dose crizanlizumab (2.5 mg 
per kilogram of body weight), high-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg per kilogram), or placebo. 
The participants, care providers, and those assessing outcomes were unaware of the group 
assignments. Patients received two doses of crizanlizumab or placebo 2 weeks apart (loading 
doses) and then received a dose every 4 weeks (maintenance dosing) through week 50 for a 
total of 14 doses administered. Each dose was administered intravenously over a period of 
30 minutes.
During the treatment phase, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
assessments were completed for each patient on the day of receipt of the initial dose, 2 
weeks later, every 4 weeks through week 50, and at week 52, for a total of 15 visits. For the 
follow-up evaluation phase, patients returned for an assessment 6 weeks after the end of the 
treatment phase (8 weeks after receipt of the last dose) (see the protocol, available at 
NEJM.org).

 CLINICAL EFFICACY
The primary efficacy end point was the annual rate of sickle cell–related pain crises, which 
was calculated as follows: total number of crises × 365 ÷ (end date − date of randomization 
+ 1), with the end date defined as the date of the last dose plus 14 days. Annualized rates 
were used for the comparisons because they take into account the duration that a participant 
was in the trial.
Sickle cell–related pain crises were defined as acute episodes of pain, with no medically 
determined cause other than a vaso-occlusive event, that resulted in a medical facility visit 
and treatment with oral or parenteral narcotic agents or with a parenteral nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drug. The acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic 
sequestration, and priapism were also considered to be crisis events. All the crises that were 
identified by trial investigators were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent 
crisis-review committee.
Secondary efficacy assessments included the annual rate of days hospitalized, the times to 
first and second crises, the annual rate of uncomplicated crises (defined as crises other than 
the acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, or priapism), the 
annual rate of the acute chest syndrome, and the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire (Long-
Form with 1-Week Recall; see the protocol). All the efficacy analyses were performed on the 
data collected during the 52-week treatment phase. Serum concentrations of crizanlizumab 
(pharmacokinetics) and the percent inhibition of P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 
(pharmacodynamics) were assessed before dosing at baseline and at subsequent trial visits.
SAFETY
Safety assessments were performed during the screening phase, before and after the 
administration of crizanlizumab or placebo during the treatment phase, and during the 
follow-up evaluation phase. Safety assessments included physical examination, vital signs 
(blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and oral body temperature), 
clinical laboratory tests (chemistry panel, complete blood count with reticulocyte count, 
urinalysis, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, activated partial-
thromboplastin time, and pregnancy tests), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and assessment of 
immunogenicity. Reported adverse events were coded with the use of preferred terms from 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.1. An independent data and 
safety monitoring committee reviewed safety during the trial.

 with the sponsor regarding the data. The authors take responsibility for the veracity and 
completeness of the data reported and for adherence to the trial protocol. No one who is not 
an author contributed to the manuscript.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We calculated that a sample of at least 50 patients per group would provide the trial with a 
statistical power of greater than 90%, at an alpha level of 0.05, to detect a 40% lower annual 
rate of crises with crizanlizumab than with placebo, with the use of a stratified Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test, assuming a median rate of crises per year in the placebo group of 3.0 with a 
predicted standard deviation of 1.7. For the primary end point, the analysis included all 198 
patients who underwent randomization, according to the intention-to-treat principle.
The crisis rate for every patient was annualized to 12 months. The annual crisis rate was 
imputed for patients who did not complete the trial. The difference in the annual crisis rate 
between the high-dose crizanlizumab group and the placebo group was analyzed with the 
use of the stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with the use of categorized history of crises in 
the previous year (2 to 4 or 5 to 10 crises) and concomitant hydroxyurea use (yes or no) as 
strata. A hierarchical testing procedure was used (alpha level of 0.05 for high-dose 
crizanlizumab vs. placebo, and if significant, low-dose crizanlizumab vs. placebo).
The annual crisis rates in the per-protocol population (i.e., all the patients who underwent 
randomization, received at least 12 of the 14 planned doses of crizanlizumab or placebo, and 
had no major protocol violations that would affect the efficacy assessments), the crisis rates 
in all subgroups, the rates of uncomplicated crises and the acute chest syndrome, and the 
annual rates of days hospitalized were analyzed with the use of the same method as that for 
the primary end point. The log-rank test was used to compare the times to the first and 
second crises. The change from baseline in responses on the Brief Pain Inventory 
questionnaire was analyzed with the use of a mixed linear model with repeated measures.
RESULTS
PATIENTS
From August 2013 through January 2015, a total of 198 patients at 60 sites in the United 
States (151 patients), Brazil (40), and Jamaica (7) met the eligibility criteria and were 
randomly assigned to receive high-dose crizanlizumab (67 patients), low-dose crizanlizumab 
(66), or placebo (65) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the patients who 
underwent randomization, 129 completed the trial. The numbers of patients who 
discontinued early from the trial were balanced among the three groups (24 patients in the 
high-dose crizanlizumab group, 21 in the low-dose crizanlizumab group, and 24 in the 
placebo group). The characteristics and baseline values of the patients in the three groups 
were generally similar (Table 1). An expanded list of characteristics and baseline values is 
provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.

 CLINICAL EFFICACY
Primary End Point—At the end of the treatment phase, the median crisis rate per year in 
the intention-to-treat population was 1.63 in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, as 
compared with 2.98 in the placebo group (indicating a 45.3% lower rate with high-dose 
crizanlizumab, P = 0.01) (Table 2). The median crisis rate per year in the low-dose 
crizanlizumab group was 2.01 (indicating a 32.6% lower rate than in the placebo group, P = 
0.18). A total of 24 of 67 patients (36%) in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, 12 of 66 
(18%) in the low-dose crizanlizumab group, and 11 of 65 (17%) in the placebo group had a 
crisis rate of zero during the treatment phase.
The primary end-point findings were supported by a sensitivity analysis of the annual crisis 
rate among the 125 patients in the per-protocol population. The median crisis rate per year in 
the per-protocol population was 1.04 in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, as compared 
with 2.18 in the placebo group (indicating a 52.3% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab, 
P = 0.02). The median crisis rate per year in the low-dose crizanlizumab group was 2.00 
(indicating a 8.3% lower rate than in the placebo group, P = 0.13). The number of patients 
who had a crisis rate of zero was 15 of 40 patients (38%) in the high-dose crizanlizumab 
group, 7 of 44 (16%) in the low-dose crizanlizumab group, and 5 of 41 (12%) in the placebo 
group.
Analyses of the annual rates of sickle cell–related pain crises in the intention-to-treat 
population were performed in subgroups defined according to concomitant hydroxyurea use, 
categorized history of crisis frequency, and sickle cell disease genotype. The median crisis 
rate per year among patients receiving concomitant hydroxyurea therapy was 2.43 in the 
high-dose crizanlizumab group, as compared with 3.58 in the placebo group (indicating a 
32.1% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab). The median crisis rate per year among 
patients who were not receiving concomitant hydroxyurea therapy was 1.00 in the high-dose 
crizanlizumab group, as compared with 2.00 in the placebo group (indicating a 50.0% lower 
rate with high-dose crizanlizumab).
The median crisis rate per year among patients who had had 2 to 4 crises in the previous 12 
months was 1.14 in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, as compared with 2.00 in the 
placebo group (indicating a 43.0% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab). The median 
crisis rate per year among patients who had had 5 to 10 crises in the previous 12 months was 
1.97 in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, as compared with 5.32 in the placebo group 
(indicating a 63.0% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab).
The median crisis rate per year among patients with the HbSS genotype was 1.97 in the 
high-dose crizanlizumab group, as compared with 3.01 in the placebo group (indicating a 
34.6% lower rate with high-dose crizanlizumab). The median crisis rate per year among 
patients with genotypes other than HbSS (i.e., those with HbSC, HbSβ0-thalassemia, 
HbSβ+-thalassemia, and other genotypes) was 0.99 in the high-dose crizanlizumab group, as 
compared with 2.00 in the placebo group (indicating a 50.5% lower rate with high-dose 
crizanlizumab).

 Secondary End Points—The median rate of days hospitalized was 4.00 per year in the 
high-dose crizanlizumab group and 6.87 per year in the placebo group. This rate was 41.8% 
lower with high-dose crizanlizumab than with placebo, although the difference was not 
significant (P = 0.45) (Table 3).
The median time to the first crisis was significantly longer among patients receiving high-
dose crizanlizumab than among those receiving placebo (4.07 vs. 1.38 months, P = 0.001), 
as was the median time to the second crisis (10.32 vs. 5.09 months, P = 0.02) (Table 3). The 
lower crisis frequency with high-dose crizanlizumab was evident within 2 weeks after the 
start of the 52-week treatment phase and was maintained throughout this phase (Fig. 1A). 
The median times to the first and second crises among patients receiving low-dose 
crizanlizumab did not differ significantly from the times among patients receiving placebo 
(Fig. 1A and 1B and Table 3).
The rate of uncomplicated crises per year was 62.9% lower in the high-dose crizanlizumab 
group than in the placebo group (median rate, 1.08 vs. 2.91; P = 0.02). In this trial, the acute 
chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, and priapism were rare 
(median rate, 0.00 in all groups), and there were no significant differences between either of 
the active-treatment groups and the placebo group.
Assessment of quality of life was performed with the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. 
Changes in the pain-severity domain and the pain-interference domain of the Brief Pain 
Inventory over the course of the trial tended to be small. There were no significant changes 
from baseline in the least-squares means during the trial.
Measures of Hemolysis—To investigate whether crizanlizumab had an effect on 
hemolytic variables in patients with sickle cell disease, changes in hemoglobin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, number of reticulocytes, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin were assessed 
during the study. No significant differences were observed in any of these variables between 
patients receiving crizanlizumab and those receiving placebo (data not shown).
PHARMACOKINETICS, PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF 
CRIZANLIZUMAB
The serum concentrations of crizanlizumab reached steady-state levels after the loading 
doses, were maintained throughout the 52-week treatment period, and were dose-
proportional (Fig. S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean trough concentrations of 
crizanlizumab during the maintenance phase (weeks 6 to 50) ranged from 2.8 to 6.8 μg per 
milliliter with low-dose crizanlizumab and from 10.5 to 15.0 μg per milliliter with high-dose 
crizanlizumab. High-dose crizanlizumab effectively blocked P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 
throughout the treatment phase, whereas low-dose crizanlizumab was associated with only 
partial blockade (Fig. S2B in the Supplementary Appendix). Antibodies against 
crizanlizumab were not detected.
SAFETY
Serious adverse events were reported in 55 patients, including 17 patients in the high-dose 
crizanlizumab group, 21 in the low-dose crizanlizumab group, and 17 in the placebo group

 (Table 4). The serious adverse events that occurred in at least 2 patients in either active-
treatment group and at a higher frequency than in the placebo group were pyrexia and 
influenza. A total of 5 patients died during the trial, including 2 patients in the high-dose 
crizanlizumab group (1 patient from the acute chest syndrome, and 1 from endocarditis and 
sepsis), 1 in the low-dose crizanlizumab group (from the acute chest syndrome, aspiration, 
respiratory failure, and progressive vascular congestion), and 2 in the placebo group (1 from 
right ventricular failure, and 1 from vaso-occlusive crisis, ischemic stroke, coma, sepsis, and 
venous thrombosis of the right lower limb).
Three additional single-occurrence adverse events that were considered to be both serious 
and life-threatening but that did not result in death included sepsis (in the placebo group), 
anemia (in the low-dose crizanlizumab group), and intracranial hemorrhage (in the low-dose 
crizanlizumab group). The patient with intracranial hemorrhage was being treated with 
ketorolac, which is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke,20,21 at the time 
of the event. No other clinically significant bleeding events were observed in the trial. 
Adverse events that occurred in 10% or more of the patients in either active-treatment group 
were headache, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, pain in upper and lower limbs, urinary tract 
infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, 
vomiting, and chest pain.
DISCUSSION
Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease, the 
treatment options for disease-related complications, including sickle cell–related pain crises, 
remain limited. Hydroxyurea, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 
1998, is the only drug that has been shown to modify the natural history of sickle cell 
disease.22 However, many patients who receive hydroxyurea therapy continue to have crises, 
end-organ damage, and a decreased life expectancy.23 In addition, adherence to the 
hydroxyurea regimen remains a challenge. 24 Trials of new drugs for the prevention of crises 
have not shown significant or clinically meaningful results.25,26
In this randomized, phase 2 trial, we observed that treatment with high-dose crizanlizumab 
resulted in an annual rate of sickle cell–related pain crises that was 45.3% lower than the 
rate with placebo. In addition, the median times to the first and second crises were two to 
three times as long in patients receiving high-dose crizanlizumab as in those receiving 
placebo. These treatment effects were significant.
In this trial, we enrolled patients who were receiving concomitant hydroxyurea as well as 
those who were not receiving hydroxyurea. The annual crisis rate was 32.1% lower with 
high-dose crizanlizumab than with placebo among patients receiving hydroxyurea and 
50.0% lower among patients who were not receiving hydroxyurea.
Patients with all the common sickle cell disease genotypes were enrolled in this trial. 
Genotypes other than HbSS were observed in 29% of the patients who underwent 
randomization. The annual crisis rate was 34.6% lower with high-dose crizanlizumab than

 with placebo among patients with the HbSS genotype and 50.5% lower among those with a 
genotype other than HbSS.
No significant differences were observed in markers of hemolysis (hemoglobin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, haptoglobin levels, number of reticulocytes, and indirect bilirubin) between 
patients receiving crizanlizumab and those receiving placebo (data not shown). This finding 
suggests that the observed clinical benefit derived from P-selectin inhibition did not involve 
a reduction in hemolysis.
The overall incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events among the patients 
treated with crizanlizumab were similar to the incidences among patients who received 
placebo. A detectable antibody response against crizanlizumab did not develop in any 
patient during the trial. Longer follow-up and monitoring are necessary to ensure that late 
neutralizing antibodies do not emerge that might limit the ability to administer 
crizanlizumab on a long-term basis.
In conclusion, the P-selectin inhibitor crizanlizumab was associated with a significantly 
lower frequency of sickle cell–related pain crises than placebo among patients with sickle 
cell disease, and crizanlizumab appeared to be associated with a low rate of adverse effects. 
Clinically meaningful lower rates of crises were observed with high-dose crizanlizumab than 
with placebo, regardless of concomitant hydroxyurea use or sickle cell disease genotype.

*The primary end point was the annual rate of crises in the high-dose crizanlizumab group versus the placebo group. The intention-to-treat 
population included all patients who underwent randomization. The per-protocol population included all the patients who underwent 
randomization, received at least 12 of the 14 planned doses of crizanlizumab or placebo, and had no major protocol violations that would affect the 
efficacy assessments. P values are for the comparison between the active-treatment group and placebo and were calculated with the use of a 
stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test. IQR denotes interquartile range.
