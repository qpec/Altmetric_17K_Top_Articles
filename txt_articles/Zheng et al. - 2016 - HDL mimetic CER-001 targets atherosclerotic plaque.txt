Background and aims: Infusion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mimetics aimed at reducing athero-
sclerotic burden has led to equivocal results, which may relate in part to the inability of HDL mimetics to
adequately reach atherosclerotic lesions in humans. This study evaluated delivery of recombinant human
apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) containing HDL mimetic CER-001 in carotid plaques in patients.
Methods: CER-001 was radiolabeled with the long-lived positron emitter zirconium-89 (89Zr) to enable
positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. Eight patients with
atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (>50% stenosis) received a single infusion of unlabeled CER-001
(3 mg/kg), co-administered with 10 mg of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 (18 MBq). Serial PET/CT imaging and
contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were performed to evaluate targeted delivery
of CER-001.
Results: One hour after infusion, mean plasma apoA-I levels increased by 9.9 mg/dL (p ¼ 0.026), with a
concomitant relative increase in the plasma cholesterol efflux capacity of 13.8% (p < 0.001). Using serial
PET/CT imaging, we showed that arterial uptake of CER-001 expressed as target-to-background ratio
(TBRmax) increased significantly 24 h after infusion, and remained increased up to 48 h (TBRmax
t ¼ 10 min: 0.98; t ¼ 24 h: 1.14 (p ¼ 0.001); t ¼ 48 h: 1.12 (p ¼ 0.007)). TBRmax was higher in plaque
compared with non-plaque segments (1.18 vs. 1.05; p < 0.001). Plaque TBRmax correlated with local
plaque contrast enhancement (r ¼ 0.56; p ¼ 0.019) as assessed by CE-MRI.
Conclusions: Infusion of HDL mimetic CER-001 increases plasma apoA-I concentration and plasma
cholesterol efflux capacity. Our data support the concept that CER-001 targets plaque regions in patients,
which correlates with plaque contrast enhancement. These clinical findings may also guide future
nanomedicine development using HDL particles for drug delivery in atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis 251 (2016) 381e388
 1. Introduction
Despite the strong inverse relationship between high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk in epidemiological surveys [1], therapies
aimed
at
pharmacologically
raising
HDL
cholesterol
levels
consistently failed to reduce CVD [2e6]. It was subsequently
suggested that the cholesterol load carried by the HDL particle
may not be the best reflection of the atheroprotective effect of
the
apolipoproteinA-1/HDL
(apoA-I)
complex
[7].
The
best
documented, protective effect of HDL relates to its role in medi-
ating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues [8],
including lipid-laden macrophages in plaques, to the liver [9].
This process is predominantly mediated via the cholesterol efflux
channel ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) for which
lipid-poor apoA-I serves as the preferred cholesterol acceptor.
The clinical relevance of this route is underscored by a recent
study describing an independent predictive effect of ABCA1-
mediated cholesterol efflux capacity for future CVD risk [10]. In
support, preclinical animal models corroborated a beneficial ef-
fect of apoA-I gene therapy [11] and of infusion of apoA-I-
containing HDL mimetics [12,13] by inducing regression of
atherosclerotic plaques. Hence, increasing the number of apoA-I-
containing HDL particles constitutes a potentially attractive target
for CVD risk reduction [14].
In humans, early proof-of-concept studies reported lipid
removal from femoral atherosclerotic plaques in CVD patients
following a single infusion of reconstituted HDL-like particles
[15]. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials failed to
substantiate these findings in coronary atherosclerosis. Infusion
of the HDL mimetics ETC-216 (apoA-I Milano complex) [16],
CSL-111 [17], and CER-001 [18], in patients following an acute
coronary
syndrome
showed
reduction
of
plaque
atheroma
volume measured by intravascular ultrasound versus baseline,
but not compared with placebo. Conversely, CER-001 reduced
plaque atheroma volume assessed by intravascular ultrasound in
patients with plaque atheroma volume �30% at baseline [19].
Furthermore, CER-001 reduced carotid arterial wall area assessed
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with familial
hypoalphalipoproteinemia [20], as well as homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia [21]. The observed reductions coincided
with CER-001-induced increase in plasma cholesterol efflux ca-
pacity [20]. The discrepant responses may have several explana-
tions, such as insufficient dosing of apoA-I HDL mimetics, or the
induction of dysfunctional HDL particles in patients with athero-
sclerotic risk factors [22,23]. Another important factor may relate
to differences in the permeability of atherosclerotic plaques,
precluding
apoA-I
HDL
from
accessing
advanced
plaques.
Although localization of infused HDL particles in murine plaques
has been reported by earlier studies [24,25], their entry in human
atherosclerotic plaques has not been documented.
Here, we evaluated whether the intravenously infused apoA-I
containing HDL mimetic CER-001 accessed plaques in patients
with advanced carotid artery stenosis. We labeled the apoA-I
component of CER-001 with the radionuclide zirconium-89
(89Zr; t1/2 ¼ 78.4 h) and performed serial quantification of the
arterial
wall
using
positron
emission
tomography
with
computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. We also investigated
whether local accessibility of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 was related
to plaque contrast enhancement assessed by contrast enhanced
(CE)-MRI. Furthermore, the effect of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 on
cholesterol efflux capacity was measured in vitro in J774-
macrophages, and in vivo in C57Bl6/J mice, as well as in the
plasma of all patients.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This single-center observational study was conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with
current Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The
protocol was
approved by the local institutional review board, and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent. Each patient received a
single infusion of CER-001 (3 mg/kg bodyweight) which was co-
administered with 89Zr-labeled CER-001 (10 mge18 MBq), during
a timeframe of 1 h. To non-invasively and serially trace the 89Zr-
labeled CER-001 particles, a PET/CT scan was performed 10 min,
24 h, and 48 h after infusion. Subsequently, all patients underwent
a contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) scan of
the
carotid
arteries
to
assess
plaque
burden
and
contrast
enhancement. The study flowchart is shown in Fig. 1.
2.2. CER-001
CER-001 is an engineered lipoprotein complex mimicking nat-
ural pre-beta HDL, consisting of recombinant human apoA-I and
phospholipids. See Data Supplement for more details regarding
CER-001.
2.3. Study participants
The study population comprised male and female patients >50
years of age with documented carotid artery stenosis (�50%) on
ultrasonography. Exclusion criteria included contra-indications to
PET/CT or CE-MRI, a recent cardiovascular event (<3 months prior
to inclusion) and decreased renal function (creatinine clearance
<50 mL/min).
2.4. Production and stability of 89Zr-labeled CER-001
89Zr-labeled CER-001 was synthesized according to Good
Manufacturing Practice guidelines. The procedure for 89Zr-radio-
labeling has been described previously [26]. See Data Supplement
for details regarding 89Zr-labeling of CER-001.
2.5. Functionality of Zr-labeled CER-001
To assess whether the covalent coupling to the bifunctional
chelator
p-isothiocyanotobenzyl
desferrioxamine
(Df-Bz-NCS)
and subsequent labeling with Zr affected the functionality of CER-
001, the cholesterol mobilizing capacity of CER-001 labeled with
natural non-radioactive Zr (natZr) was compared with unmodified
CER-001 in vitro and in vivo. J774-macrophages were seeded on
24-well plates (300,000 cells/well) and loaded with [3H]-choles-
terol oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (18.5 kBq/well) in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/fetal calf serum (2.5%) for
24 h. After an overnight equilibration, [3H]-cholesterol release
was measured 6 h after incubation with CER-001 and natZr-labeled
CER-001 in ascending doses. Assays were performed in triplicate.
Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage of radioac-
tivity released from cells into the medium relative to the total
radioactivity in cells and medium. To investigate in vivo choles-
terol mobilization, C57Bl6/J mice received a 250 mg in 50 mL in-
jection of CER-001 or natZr-labeled CER-001 after being fasted
overnight. Blood was sampled from the caudal vein at different
timepoints. The plasma unesterified cholesterol concentration
was determined with the Biolabo Unesterified Cholesterol Kit
(Biolabo, Maizy, France).

 2.6. PET/CT imaging
Patients in fasting state received a single infusion of CER-001
(3
mg/kg
bodyweight)
together
with
89Zr-labeled
CER-001
(10 mge18 MBq). PET/CT scans (Philips Gemini, Philips, Best, The
Netherlands) of the carotid arteries were performed at 10 min, 24 h,
and 48 h after infusion. An ultralow-dose non-contrast CT scan was
performed for attenuation correction and co-registration. The ra-
diation exposure for this study was estimated to be 18 mSv for each
participant. Image analysis was performed as previously described
[20,27] on a dedicated commercially available workstation (OsiriX
6.0, Pixmeo, Bernex, Switzerland). In brief, arterial 89Zrelabeled
CER-001 uptake was assessed by drawing regions of interests by
delineating the arterial wall in a standardized segment of 5
sequential slices (25 mm) in the distal common carotid artery on
the co-registered CT. The maximal standardized uptake value was
calculated as the maximal pixel activity within each region of in-
terest. For each artery, the maximal target-to-background-ratio
(TBRmax) was calculated by correcting the mean maximal stan-
dardized uptake value of these regions for the mean background
blood activity in the venous blood pool. To investigate whether
89Zr-labeled CER-001 readily accessed plaques, MRI was used to
identify plaque and non-plaque areas, and to co-localize these
segments of the carotid arteries on PET/CT. Subsequently, regions of
interest were drawn in these regions, and plaque and non-plaque
TBRmax were calculated for each segment.
2.7. 3T MRI measurements
Carotid MRI was performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Philips
Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) using a dedicated bilateral 8-
channel carotid coil (Shanghai Chenguang Medical Technologies,
Shanghai, China). See Data Supplement for details regarding MRI
sequence parameters. Arterial wall dimensions were analyzed in
the standardized segment of the distal common carotid artery, the
25 mm directly proximal from the flow divider, corresponding to
the area analyzed on PET/CT. The same was performed for all
atherosclerotic plaques in the common and internal carotid artery,
identified as segments with a maximal wall thickness of >2.0 mm
that could be co-localized on PET/CT. For each plaque, a non-plaque
segment of >10 mm length starting within 25 mm distance of the
plaque in the same artery was identified. This non-plaque segment
had the lowest mean wall thickness in that area and did not exceed
a maximum wall thickness of 2.0 mm. Lumen and outer wall con-
tours were drawn manually using dedicated software (Vessel-Mass,
Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands), after
which the mean wall area, mean wall thickness, and maximal wall
thickness were calculated for the common carotid arteries, indi-
vidual plaques, and non-plaque segments.
To assess plaque contrast enhancement, three-dimensional
delayed enhancement MRI was performed at baseline and 15 min
after intravenous administration of Gadovist (0.1 mL/kg body-
weight, 1 mL/s). All atherosclerotic plaques with a maximal wall
thickness greater than 2.0 mm in the common and internal carotid
artery, and corresponding non-plaque segments were selected for
delayed
enhancement
analysis.
The
degree
of
contrast
enhancement was defined as the post-contrast/pre-contrast signal
intensity ratio. For this analysis, we ensured equal signal scaling
and negligible patient motion between pre- and post-contrast
scans.
2.8. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein profiles and cholesterol efflux
capacity
Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and tri-
glycerides were measured by standard enzymatic methods (Diag-
nostic Systems, Holzheim, Germany) on a SELECTRA automated
spectrophotometric analyzer (VitaLab, Dieren, The Netherlands).
ApoA-I was measured with a turbidimetric assay (Diagnostic Sys-
tems, Holtzheim, Germany) using the SELECTRA analyzer. Choles-
terol efflux capacity was quantified as described previously [28]
using serum samples collected from patients before and after
infusion of CER-001. See Data Supplement for details regarding the
cholesterol efflux assay.
2.9. Safety
See
Data
Supplement
for
more
details
regarding
safety
monitoring.
2.10. Statistical analyses
Data are represented as means with standard deviations or
medians with interquartile ranges. For evaluation of TBRmax change
over time, repeated measures analysis of variance was performed. If
significance was found, post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction
were performed to compare TBRmax at different timepoints. To
assess differences in apoA-I levels and cholesterol efflux capacity
after infusion, the paired Student T-test was performed. The Pear-
son correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship be-
tween plaque PET/CT signal and contrast uptake. Statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistics software (Version 22.0,
IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A p-value of <0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Stability of 89Zr-labeled CER-001
Sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) anal-
ysis of full blood samples showed >99% of the radioactivity in the
HDL protein band after 24 and 48 h of incubation, with a slightly
lower percentage for serum samples (Data Supplement Fig. 1B). On
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
89Zr-labeled
CER-001 resulted in a single peak with retention time of 24.4 min
(Data Supplement Fig. 1C). The same peak was observed upon in-
cubation of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 for 24 h in full blood. A second,
small peak arose when 89Zr-labeled CER-001 was incubated for 24
or 48 h in serum or for 48 h in full blood. Taking the SDS-PAGE data
into account, the second peak seems more indicative for altered
mobility of CER-001 on HPLC than for degradation as such. In
addition, incubation with 89Zr-labeled CER-001 in full blood for

 24 h demonstrated that, after centrifugation, <3% of total gamma
counts were in the cellular fraction.
3.2. Functionality of Zr-labeled CER-001
Prior to clinical evaluation of 89Zr-labeled CER-001, the choles-
terol mobilizing capacity of CER-001 was investigated as a quality
test to assess any functional changes after Zr-labeling of CER-001.
In vitro cholesterol efflux from J774 macrophages increased in a
similar fashion in response to high concentrations of both CER-001
and natZr-labeled CER-001, reaching a plateau above 50 mg/mL for
both formulations (Fig. 2A). In C57Bl6/J mice, injection of CER-001
and
natZr-labeled CER-001 resulted in similar kinetics for the
mobilization of unesterified cholesterol (Fig. 2B). These data indi-
cate that covalent coupling of CER-001 with the bifunctional
chelator Df-Bz-NCS and subsequent labeling with Zr does not affect
its cholesterol-mobilizing capacity.
3.3. Baseline characteristics
To evaluate delivery of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 to the carotid pla-
que, we included 8 patients, aged 66.8 ± 5.7 years, with carotid
artery stenosis of at least 50% in one or both carotid arteries, as
documented by ultrasound measurements. Clinical characteristics
are listed in Table 1. All patients received standard of care medi-
cation for CVD. At baseline, HDL-cholesterol was 42.0 ± 12.6 mg/dL
and mean apoA-I concentration was 157.9 ± 36.7 mg/dL.
3.4. ApoA-I and cholesterol efflux capacity
Following infusion of CER-001 and 89Zr-labeled CER-001, apoA-I
levels increased by 9.9 mg/dL after 1 h (p ¼ 0.026; Fig. 3A), with a
concomitant relative increase of 13.8% in plasma cholesterol efflux
capacity (p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). After 24 h, apoA-I levels and choles-
terol efflux capacity returned to pre-infusion values.
3.5. Multimodality imaging
To evaluate carotid artery uptake of 89Zr-labeled CER-001, PET/
CT imaging was performed 10 min, 24 h, and 48 h after infusion. All
scans were suitable for image analysis of both carotid arteries,
providing 48 carotid TBRmax values in total, representing both left
and right carotid arteries at 3 timepoints in 8 patients. Directly after
infusion (10 min), carotid TBRmax was 0.98 ± 0.12. Compared with
the 10-min scans, carotid TBRmax increased to 1.14 ± 0.10
(p ¼ 0.001) at 24 h and remained increased at 48 h post-infusion
(1.12 ± 0.11, p ¼ 0.007; Fig. 4A).
Next, arterial wall dimensions for each carotid artery, and for
plaque and non-plaque regions was determined using CE-MRI
(Fig. 4B; Data Supplement Fig. 2): 16 carotid arteries were scan-
ned, of which 14 were of sufficient quality for analysis. One patient
had a total occlusion of the common carotid artery on one side,
resulting in 13 analysable carotid artery segments. As presented in
Table 2, arterial wall dimensions of the carotids were thickened in
our patients and comparable with previously reported values for
CVD patients [29]. In addition, we identified 18 plaques in total: 13

 common carotid plaques in 8 patients, and 5 internal carotid pla-
ques in 5 patients. These plaques were clearly distinct from non-
plaque regions (mean wall area 35.43 ± 10.60 and 21.39 ± 4.37,
respectively; p < 0.001). The TBRmax value in plaques was signifi-
cantly higher compared with the value in non-plaque areas 24 h
after infusion (1.18 ± 0.14 vs. 1.05 ± 0.14; p < 0.001), with a similar
trend 48 h after infusion (Fig. 4C).
In addition to plaque dimensions, CE-MRI was performed to
gain insight into the contrast enhancement of the plaques: out of 18
plaques,17 were of sufficient quality for analysis. The plaque uptake
of CER-001 after 24 and 48 h as measured by PET/CTcorrelated with
the delayed enhancement ratio (POST/PRE) on CE-MRI (24 h:
r ¼ 0.56, p ¼ 0.019; 48 h: r ¼ 0.57, p ¼ 0.016; Fig. 4D).

 3.6. Safety results
Infusion of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 was well tolerated during the
study and did not induce changes in blood pressure or heart rate.
No adverse events were reported.
4. Discussion
In the present study, vessel wall imaging studies support the
concept that infused HDL mimetic particles localize to advanced
atherosclerotic plaques in patients. More specifically, the PET signal
elicited by 89Zr-labeled CER-001 was higher at sites of atheroscle-
rotic plaques compared with sites without plaque, within the same
patient. The extent of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 signal in the plaque also
correlated with the contrast enhancement of the plaque as
measured by MRI. Together, these data suggest that determinants
of plaque contrast enhancement may predict the extent of access of
apoA-I HDL mimetic particles into the plaque area. Furthermore,
we have shown that CER-001 enhances plasma cholesterol efflux
capacity in patients, and that the chelator conjugation and 89Zr-
labeling of CER-001 did not influence its cholesterol efflux capacity
either in vitro or in vivo.
4.1. Cardiovascular imaging with 89Zr-labeled CER-001
In the field of oncology, the need to quantify targeted delivery of
infused drugs has long been recognized, as the therapeutic
response directly relates to the local drug concentrations achieved
in tumours [30]. In patients with CVD, most therapeutic strategies
have focused on systemic risk factors, thereby precluding the ne-
cessity to assess uptake of drugs in atherosclerotic lesions. How-
ever, for apoA-I-containing HDL mimetics, targeted delivery into
the atherosclerotic plaque is considered to be a prerequisite to
achieve therapeutic response, since the atheroprotective effect is
driven by removal of cholesterol from lesional, lipid-laden macro-
phages [9]. To study localization of CER-001 to plaques, we used a
Good Manufacturing Practice approved method of 89Zr-labeling to
allow for non-invasive in vivo imaging [31]. We demonstrated the
feasibility of applying 89Zr-PET to assess targeted delivery of HDL
mimetics to atherosclerotic lesions in patients, as 89Zr-labeling of
CER-001 was safe, stable, and did not alter cholesterol mobilizing
functionality. After infusion in patients with atherosclerosis, we
found increased PET signal of 89Zr-labeled CER-001 in atheroscle-
rotic lesions, implying that infused unlabeled HDL mimetic parti-
cles access the intended target.
Although the passage of apoA-I through the endothelial barrier
has been documented previously in humans [32], these studies
were not able to differentiate between permeation of atheroscle-
rotic lesions versus healthy arterial walls. In the present study,
imaging studies point towards delivery of the apoA-I-containing
HDL mimetic CER-001 in the arterial wall of patients with athero-
sclerotic disease. In fact, by combining MRI and PET/CT, TBRmax in
plaques was found to be significantly higher than in non-plaque
areas, implying that CER-001 particles more readily access the
arterial wall at sites of atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, the cor-
relation between the 89Zr-labeled CER-001 signal on PET and the
delayed contrast enhancement signal on MRI also suggests that
plaque contrast enhancement, as a surrogate marker relating to
permeability, may be a determinant of delivery efficiency in
atherosclerotic lesions [33]. These data concur with previous
findings for permeation of liposomes across an endothelial mono-
layer, revealing liposomal extravasation predominantly at sites of
increased endothelial permeability [34]. Collectively, our findings
support the concept that apoA-I-containing HDL mimetics target
atherosclerotic plaques in patients, a prerequisite for the concept of
using HDL mimetic particles to enhance cholesterol efflux from
lipid-laden macrophages in plaques.
Compared with results from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET
studies to evaluate inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic lesions,
we observed only a modest increase in the carotid and plaque 89Zr-
signal, expressed as TBRmax, after 24 and 48 h. This reflects the
distinct behaviour of 18F-FDG compared with 89Zr-labeled CER-001.
Whereas the glucose analogue FDG is metabolically trapped after
cellular uptake in macrophages, the kinetics of apoA-I are much
more complex as it has been shown to recirculate via lymph after
passing the endothelial barrier [32] and has a longer blood half-life
[35]. Consequently, infused 89Zr-labeled CER-001 particles do not
accumulate, but instead reach a steady-state level in the plaque that
is determined by the in-versus outflow of the apoA-I-containing
HDL mimetics. The observed differences in 89Zr-signal between
plaque and non-plaque regions further support these findings.
Furthermore, the
89Zr-labeled CER-001 signal may have been
adversely affected by competition with the infused unlabeled CER-
001. Indeed, such interference has been described in 89Zr-antibody-
based tumor imaging studies, in which target saturation may occur
when the dose of the co-infused unlabeled monoclonal antibodies
is too high [31]. However, considering that the amount of infused
apoA-I containing CER-001 is less than 10% of endogenous plasma
apoA-I, it is less likely that plaque saturation by unlabeled CER-001
contributes to the modest CER-001 signal in plaques.
4.2. HDL particles as drug carrier
Considering the key role of macrophages in the development
and destabilization of atherosclerotic lesions, using nanomedicine
to target macrophages is increasingly being acknowledged as an
attractive approach for an effective anti-atherosclerotic therapeutic
modality [36]. It has been previously shown that reconstituted HDL
particles can be used as a nano-sized carrier for drug delivery into
lesions, as they are very effective at delivering their payload into
plaque macrophages [37,38]. Infusion of reconstituted HDL (nano)
particles loaded with statins was found to exert a potent anti-
atherosclerotic effect in mice, which clearly exceeded the effect
attainable with oral dosing of statins [37]. Our finding of the HDL

 mimetic CER-001 localizing to plaques in patients is the first clinical
study finding to support the promising concept of using HDL as a
nano-delivery vehicle loaded with anti-atherogenic compounds in
atherosclerosis [39].
4.3. Limitations
The present study has several limitations. First, this is a single-
center observational study with a small sample size. Second, we
did not include a control arm of healthy volunteers in view of the
radiation exposure (18 mSv). Instead, we compared plaque versus
non-plaque areas within each patient, allowing us to evaluate de-
livery efficiency in affected versus unaffected arterial segments.
Third, since high temporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced
imaging of the carotid artery remains technologically challenging,
we chose delayed enhancement imaging as a read-out of plaque
permeability. Therefore, we currently cannot assess the relative
contribution of different mechanisms leading to accumulation of
contrast in the atherosclerotic plaque, i.e. increased endothelial
permeability, plaque neovascularization, and increased extracel-
lular space. Nevertheless, all these mechanisms will contribute to
the vessel wall build-up of CER-001 and therefore do not preclude
the relevance of our findings.
5. Conclusions
Here, we provide evidence to show that the HDL mimetic CER-
001 enhances plasma cholesterol efflux capacity and accesses
advanced atherosclerotic plaques in patients after infusion. Using
non-invasive in vivo imaging, we observe that plaque contrast
enhancement is correlated to 89Zr-labeled CER-001 signal in the
plaque. These data provide valuable insights for HDL mimetic
infusion therapy, and may also help guide future plaque targeted
delivery strategies using HDL as a nano-carrier for both imaging
and therapeutic purposes in patients.
