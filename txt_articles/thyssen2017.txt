Abstract 
Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has been linked with psychiatric disease in adults. However, the 
exact relationship and its consequences have been insufficiently studied. Our aim in this study was to 
assess the association between depression, anxiety and AD in adults, and examine the risk of 
hospitalization and suicide. 
Methods: We utilized questionnaire data from a large general population study with data on social 
habits and psychiatric symptoms to compare prevalences of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and 
anxiety attacks, in adults with and without a history of AD. Additionally we used nationwide

hospital/clinic registry and prescription data to examine the risk of anxiety and depression in Danish 
adults with mild and moderate-severe AD, as well as the risk of hospitalization and suicide.  
 
Results: In the general population study, those with AD reported clinician-diagnosed depression and 
anxiety more often than non-AD subjects, and had an increased prevalence of suicidal ideation and 
depressive symptoms. In the health registry study, moderate-severe AD patients had increased risk of 
antidepressant and anxiolytic medication use, while patients with mild AD only had increased risk of 
anxiolytic medication use. There was no increased risk of hospitalization or outpatient contacts due to 
depression or anxiety, or risk of suicide in AD patients.  
 
Conclusions: Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are more common among AD individuals, 
but do not to lead to psychiatric consultations, hospitalization, or suicide. 
 
Keywords: anxiety; atopic dermatitis; depression; eczema; suicide  
 
Introduction 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic and remitting pruritic inflammatory skin condition of 
childhood, which may persist into adulthood.1, 2 Like many other dermatologic conditions, registry- 
and questionnaire-based studies have associated AD with poor quality of life, depression, and anxiety 
in children and adults.3-8 Notably, a large recent Taiwanese study found that adolescents with AD had 
a stronger risk of anxiety than depression, whereas the risk of depression was stronger compared to 
anxiety in adults.3 Moreover, a recent study of adolescents from Korea found slightly increased risks 
of suicidal ideation, planning and attempts in patients with AD.9 It is possible that a ‘psychiatric 
march’ exists in patients with AD, where chronic pruritus, sleep disturbance, and poor self-esteem, in 
turn may lead to anxiety, depression and possibly even suicide.10

The burden of skin diseases such as AD may have far-reaching consequences not only for patients and 
their relatives, but also for health-care providers, payers, and the society as a whole. Using large-scale 
observational data, we therefore assessed the psychiatric burden, i.e. depression, anxiety, suicidal 
ideation, suicide, and use of anxiolytics and antidepressants, respectively, in Danish adults with AD. 
 
Materials and methods 
DanFunD questionnaire study 
The Danish Study of Functional Disorders (DanFunD) is a general population study with data from 
9,656 adult Danish residents thought to be representative of the Danish population.11, 12 DanFunD data 
was collected in two discrete parts; in the first part, conducted in 2011 and 2012, participants were 
recruited from a five year follow-up reexamination of a population-based cohort as described 
previously.13 Participation rate was 67.8% (2,308/3,405). In the second part, conducted from 2012-
2015, participants were selected from the general population with a 29.5% participation rate 
(7,493/25,368).12 While all participants underwent general health examination, only questionnaire 
data were used for the present study, which included the question “Has a physician ever told you 
had/have depression/anxiety” as well as self-reported symptoms of AD, smoking, alcohol 
consumption, depression, and suicide. Participants were also asked questions regarding symptoms of 
anxiety, including “Do you frequently suffer from anxiety attacks?”  Participants were classified as 
having AD if they fulfilled at least 2 of 4 criteria of a modified UK working party classification for 
AD; a validated method that has been successfully utilized in other similar registries.14, 15 This method 
captures individuals who have or previously had symptoms suggestive of AD, but who may not have 
been given the diagnosis by a clinician. However, it does not provide any information about 
persistence or resolution of AD. We utilized an algorithm (Supplementary Table 1) based on the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for major 
depressive disorder to identify patients with symptoms suggestive of depression.16

Health registry study 
Every Danish resident is assigned a unique civil registration number at birth or on immigration to 
Denmark. This makes unambiguous linkage possible among all population-based Danish 
administrative and health registries.17 All patients admitted to Danish hospitals or seen in hospital-
based outpatient clinics have their information stored in the Danish National Patient Register (DNPR). 
Diagnoses in accordance with the Danish version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
are registered.18 The DNPR holds data on pharmacotherapy given to hospitalized patients and those 
from outpatient clinics. All pharmacy-dispensed prescriptions are recorded in the Register of 
Medicinal Product Statistics, and classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
Classification System.19 All deaths and causes of deaths are registered in the National Causes of Death 
Registry within 14 days after death.20 Information on tax-reported household income is recorded by 
Statistics Denmark.21  
 
The DNPR study included all Danish adults ≥18 years old on January 1, 1997. The study start was set 
to January 1, 1997, or the date where an individual first received an adult diagnosis of AD, whichever 
came last. Patients were categorized as having adult AD, if a diagnosis (inpatient or ambulatory) of 
AD (ICD-8: 691 and ICD-10: L20) had been registered by a dermatologist on or after their 18th 
birthday, as recorded in the DNPR. Individuals were followed from study start until December 31, 
2012, migration, death, or the occurrence of a psychiatric endpoint (see below). We classified patients 
with moderate-severe AD if they had received systemic therapy at any time before study start 
(azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, psoralen plus ultraviolet A 
[PUVA], or systemic corticosteroids), consistent with moderate-severe disease. Patients who had not 
been treated with these therapies were categorized as having mild AD. Qualitative proxy data for 
smoking and alcohol abuse were collected in accordance with previously described methods.22, 23 The 
primary study endpoints were diagnoses in the DNPR of depression (ICD-8: 296.09, 296.29, 296.99, 
298.09, 300.19, 300.49 and ICD-10: F32-33), anxiety (ICD-8: 300.0, 300.2 and ICD-10: F40-41), 
hospitalization for depression or anxiety, a recorded suicide in the National Causes of Death Registry

(ICD-10: X60–X84), or a claimed prescription for antidepressants (ATC N06A), or anxiolytic drugs 
(ATC N05B) recorded in the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, respectively. 
 
 
Statistical analysis 
For both datasets, we described baseline characteristics with means and standard deviations for 
continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Characteristics of 
participants in the DanFunD study were compared using the χ2 test. Logistic regression models were 
performed with depression and anxiety as dependent variables, respectively, and with sex, age, 
alcohol use, and self-reported educational level as explanatory variables. Associations were expressed 
as odds ratios (ORs). For the registry study, the baseline prevalence was determined as the percentage 
of individuals that had received one of the pre-specified diagnoses, or claimed an antidepressant or 
anxiolytic prescriptions within the five years prior to study start. SAS statistical software version 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) and STATA software version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX, USA) were used to summarize incidence rates per 1,000 person-years, and Cox regression 
models were performed to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Incidence during follow-up was 
calculated for all individuals regardless of whether they had previously had the condition or not. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed where those with prevalent disease were excluded, i.e. analyses 
of first-time outcome (no significant changes were observed in the sensitivity analyses compared with 
the primary analyses). Age- and sex-adjusted, and fully adjusted (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and 
healthcare consumption) HRs were calculated. To determine socioeconomic status, we calculated an 
index between 0 and 4 based on the average gross annual income during a 5-year period before study 
inclusion (standardized by age). Model assumptions including the proportional hazards assumption 
were tested and found to be valid. All statistical tests were conducted using a level of significance of 
0.05, and results were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where applicable.

Results 
DanFunD questionnaire study 
A total of 1,044 (13.8%) of the 9,656 participants in the DanFunD questionnaire cohort had a history 
of AD according to the UK working party scoring criteria. Baseline characteristics between AD and 
non-AD individuals were similar (Table 1). Significant associations between AD and clinician-
diagnosed depression (crude OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.62-2.27; fully-adjusted OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.48-2.08), 
and clinician-diagnosed anxiety (crude OR 1.74 95% CI 1.35-2.24; fully-adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 
1.24-2.08) were observed. According to the modified DSM-V criteria, 568 (5.9%) of all individuals 
had symptoms consistent with a major depressive disorder. Individuals with AD were significantly 
more likely to report these symptoms (crude OR 2.15 95% CI 1.73-2.67; fully-adjusted OR 1.92, 95% 
CI 1.54-2.40). While thoughts of suicide were more common among AD individuals compared to 
controls (3.4% vs. 1.7%), few reported suicidal ideation on a regular basis. Participants with AD also 
self-reported frequent anxiety attacks more often than controls (5.4% vs. 2.2%; crude OR 2.42 95% 
CI 2.10-2.78; fully-adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.70-3.16).  
 
Health registry study 
In our nationwide patient registry study, a total of 5,766 patients had mild AD and 4,272 had 
moderate-severe AD (Table 2). AD patients were younger, predominantly female, and had a higher 
prevalence of smoking and alcohol abuse. The prevalence of anxiety and hospitalization due to 
anxiety was comparable across the study groups, but the prevalence of depression and hospitalization 
due to depression was slightly increased in patients with moderate-severe AD. Use of antidepressants 
and anxiolytic drugs was higher in patients with moderate-severe, but not mild AD, at baseline.  
 
During follow-up, few AD patients were diagnosed with or hospitalized due to anxiety or depression 
(Table 3). In adjusted analyses, the risk of being diagnosed with or hospitalized due to depression or 
anxiety was similar among AD patients with moderate-severe disease and the general population (HR 
for hospitalization due to depression was 1.24 (95% CI 0.77-2.00); and due to anxiety 1.85 (95% CI

0.90-3.82) (Table 4). Notably, the number of anxiolytic events was very low. Similarly, the risk of 
suicide was comparable in patients with AD and controls, and again, suicides were rare (n=5 and n=4 
among patients with mild and moderate-severe AD, respectively). Analysis of prescription data 
showed that patients with moderate-severe AD had a significantly increased risk of anxiolytic (HR 
1.66, 95% CI 1.56-1.77) and antidepressant drug use (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.31) while those with 
mild AD only had a slightly increased risk of anxiolytic drug use (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16). 
 
Discussion 
Main Findings 
We found significant associations between self-reported AD and clinician-diagnosed depression and 
anxiety, respectively, among adults from a population-based survey. More patients with AD reported 
having suicidal ideation within the past week compared with non-AD subjects. Notably however, 
suicidal ideation remained rare and symptoms hereof were mild. In the health register study, 
prevalences of depression and anxiety leading to outpatient psychiatric consultations or 
hospitalization were comparable between AD patients and the general population, whereas 
antidepressant and anxiolytic drug use was markedly higher among AD patients. During follow-up, 
patients with moderate-severe AD had increased risk of treatment with antidepressants and 
anxiolytics, whereas only the risk of anxiolytic drug use was increased in mild AD patients. 
Importantly, risk of suicide was not increased in patients with AD, regardless of severity.  
 
Interpretation 
The present study expands current literature considerably by not only examining associations between 
AD and depression/anxiety, but also the occurrence of serious aspects of these conditions, i.e. suicidal 
ideation, psychiatric hospitalizations, and completed suicide. Our results suggest that while 
depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation occur more frequently in AD patients, this may be restricted 
to milder symptoms, since the risk of outpatient hospital consultations and hospitalizations due to

depression or anxiety was comparable between adults with AD and the general population. A previous 
Danish questionnaire-based study reported suicidal thoughts in 18.9% of patients with AD within past 
2 weeks; a number which is much higher than our 1-week prevalence of 3.4%.24 This difference is 
likely explained by disease severity since the former study examined both out-patient and hospitalized 
AD patients. While suicidal ideation obviously should be a cause for concern, especially in depressed 
patients with AD, it is reassuring that suicides rarely occurred in our study and at no higher risk than 
in the general population. Importantly, other previous studies have shown a lower prevalence of 
suicidal ideation in adults with AD compared to other dermatology patients reinforcing the impression 
from our study, i.e. that AD is associated with risk of certain psychiatric ailments, but not to a degree 
that leads to hospitalization or suicide.25 We acknowledge that these more severe outcomes of suicide 
and psychiatric hospitalization could be mitigated in AD patients due to their increased general 
healthcare and psychiatric healthcare utilization leading to e.g. earlier and more aggressive 
antidepressant therapy.4, 26 
 
Although marginally higher among patients with moderate-severe AD, the baseline prevalence of 
psychiatric disorders was generally comparable between mild and moderate-severe AD, and the 
general population. On the other hand, antidepressant and anxiolytic drug use was markedly higher 
among patients with moderate-severe AD. Previous studies have identified a similar severity-
dependent phenomenon. In one nationwide US questionnaire study, those children with severe AD 
had increased prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to those with moderate or mild AD.4 In 
another US study, AD individuals with self-reported severe AD reported bipolar disorder and 
depression, but not anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder more than those with mild or moderate 
AD.26 Similarly, in a recent South Korean study, adult males with moderate-to-severe AD were 
diagnosed with depression, but not anxiety, more often compared to patients with mild AD.27 In 
apparent disaccord with our findings, a US population based study found two- and five-fold increased 
risks of moderate and severe depression, respectively, in adults with AD.6 Moreover, a study of 
adolescents from Taiwan reported four- and five-fold increased risks of major depression and anxiety

disorders, respectively, associated with AD.3 While the reason for these discrepancies is unclear, it 
may reflect cultural differences as well as access to healthcare and medicines.  
 
Strengths and Limitations 
Several strengths and limitations apply to the interpretation of the present findings. The scale of the 
study cohorts, including the large number of adults with AD and the use of both a general population 
cohort and nationwide registries adds credibility to our findings. Yet, due to the observational nature 
of our study, we cannot determine causality, and whether the observed effects are due to cutaneous or 
pruritic manifestations of AD, or due to socioeconomic or environmental factors requires further 
study. We diagnosed AD according to the UK party working criteria, as well as by hospital 
dermatologists, thereby ensuring diagnostic accuracy. Nonetheless, the overall participation rate in the 
general population study was low in DanFunD, and we cannot refute that selection bias could have 
affected our results. However, since the focus of the study was on functional disorders, we have no 
reason to suspect that adults with a history of AD were pre-selected. In fact, the AD prevalence was 
lower than a recent large adult general population study from Denmark (14.3%).28 Moreover, our 
population-based analyses were restricted to patients seen in hospital (including ambulatory) clinics, 
and may comprise a more selected population of patients with more severe disease. However, this 
would arguably have led to higher risk estimates of depression and anxiety if a compelling association 
did in fact exist. Indeed, that we did not see an increased risk of depression or anxiety, or 
hospitalization thereof, therefore further supports the fact that AD patients have no higher risk of 
severe depressive or anxiety disorders, or suicide. Medication was not linked to diagnoses. We 
therefore lacked information on the reasons why patients were prescribed antidepressant and 
anxiolytic drugs, which is a limitation since these agents can be used to treat other conditions as well. 
Finally, we relied on use of systemic therapy as a marker for AD disease severity. This may have 
resulted in limited miscategorization of disease severity, e.g. patients with moderate disease activity 
who have not yet been put on systemic therapy would be categorized as having mild AD.

Conclusion 
Based on nationwide registry and population-based questionnaire data, Danish adults with AD appear 
to have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Importantly however, the 
psychiatric disease burden appears to be mild, and does not result in treatment by psychiatrists, 
psychiatric hospitalizations, or suicide.
