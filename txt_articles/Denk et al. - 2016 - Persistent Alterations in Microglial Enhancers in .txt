In Brief
Chronic pain is a devastating condition,
the longevity of which is not well
understood. Denk et al. examined cell-
type-specific microglial responses in a
model of chronic pain and propose that
some of the longer lasting changes from
pain inducing injury may be hidden in the
epigenome of these immune cells.

SUMMARY
Chronic pain is a common and devastating condition
that induces well-characterized changes in neurons
and microglia. One major unanswered question is
why these changes should persist long after the
precipitating injury has healed. Here, we suggest
that some of the longer-lasting consequences of
nerve injury may be hidden in the epigenome. Cell
sorting and sequencing techniques were used to
characterize the spinal cord immune response in a
mouse model of chronic neuropathic pain. Infiltration
of peripheral myeloid cells was found to be absent,
and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of central microglia
revealed transient gene expression changes in
response to nerve ligation. Conversely, examination
of microglial enhancers revealed persistent, post-
injury alterations in close proximity to transcription-
ally regulated genes. Enhancers are regions of open
chromatin that define a cell’s transcription factor
binding profile. We hypothesize that changes at en-
hancers may constitute a mechanism by which pain-
ful experiences are recorded at a molecular level.
INTRODUCTION
All of us are likely to know someone who is affected by chronic
pain: the incidence in our population is estimated to be up to
20%. With limited treatment options, many patients have long
resigned and suffer quietly with little hope of respite. The hours
of work and productivity they lose as a consequence turn their
private tragedy into a public burden, costing the United States
government an estimated $250 billion a year.
A great deal is known about the neurobiological mechanisms
associated with the development and maintenance of chronic
pain. One major characteristic is persistent hypersensitivity at
all levels of the nervous system, with inappropriate neuronal re-
sponses having been reported in peripheral sensory neurons,
spinal neurons, and top-down modulatory centers in the brain.
This maladaptive state is thought to be compounded by
abnormal immune cell function, both peripherally and centrally
(McMahon et al., 2015). Activation of microglia in particular,
the resident myeloid cells of the CNS, is known to be critical
for the emergence of spinal hypersensitivity in a wide range of
animal models, including those of neuropathic pain, chemo-
therapy-induced pain, and rheumatoid arthritis pain. Evidence
in humans has been harder to come by, but pioneering imaging
studies are suggesting that abnormal microglial responses also
have a prominent role in the CNS of chronic pain patients (Loggia
et al., 2015).
One mystery that remains is why many of these alterations
persist long-term, even when the initial injury or disease remits.
There are likely to be a number of explanations, for instance
post-translational modification of ion channels or wide-spread
transcriptional changes are often put forward. And yet, the vast
majority of proteins in the brain have a half-life of <14 days
(Chee and Dahl, 1978), making it difficult to appreciate how their
abnormal function should be sustained in the long run. Here, we
examine the possibility of epigenetic remodeling in CNS immune
cells, in particular the role of enhancer deposition.
Enhancers are cis-acting regulatory regions within the DNA
that allow the binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to in-
fluence gene expression over variable distances, sometimes up
to several hundred kilobases (kb) away. During development, the
binding of lineage-specific TFs to distinct enhancers is thought
to be vital for the establishment of cell-type-specific transcrip-
tion by allowing local remodeling of chromatin and permanent
accessibility to selective stretches of DNA. Enhancers, therefore,
ultimately determine which genes can be used in a given cell type
(Heinz et al., 2015). It is thought that the enhancer profile of a cell
remains largely unaltered once established. Yet recent seminal
papers suggest that a small, but significant, number of de novo
enhancers can appear as a result of external signals, even
once development is complete. Thus in macrophages, stimula-
tion with different inflammatory mediators or activation of toll-
like receptor 4 each result in the emergence of a distinct profile
of new, so-called latent, enhancer peaks (Kaikkonen et al.,
2013; Ostuni et al., 2013). Some of these latent enhancers persist
once the initial stimulation has been removed, in effect func-
tioning as a molecular footprint of prior events. It has been
posited that these latent enhancers could constitute a mecha-
nism by which an adaptive form of immunity can be established
in innate immune cells (Quintin et al., 2014).
We have tested this idea in context of persistent pain. We per-
formed detailed characterization of the spinal cord immune
response in a well-studied model of neuropathic pain using mi-
croglial-specific flow cytometry markers. We then isolated resi-
dent microglia for genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)

 and epigenetic profiling. Our data provide evidence that periph-
eral nerve injury changes the landscape of microglial en-
hancers—a process that could maintain these cells in an
abnormal, maladaptive state over long periods of time.
RESULTS
Characterization of Spinal Cord Immune Response after
Spinal Nerve Ligation
Enhancers are highly cell-type-specific, and their study requires
a firm understanding of the different cell populations present in a
given system. A long-standing debate in the study of chronic
pain is whether the spinal cord immune response is restricted
to resident microglia or also includes peripheral macrophages.
Hitherto, this question has been difficult to resolve, as common
flow cytometry markers are unable to clearly distinguish between
these two myeloid populations. We used a recently described
antibody to unequivocally stain and identify yolk-sack-derived
resident microglial populations (Butovsky et al., 2014). We also
studied the proportion of other immune cells in the spinal cord,
by examining Ly6G-, Ly6C-, CD3-, and CD19-positive popula-
tions to identify neutrophils, infiltrating macrophages, T cells,
and B cells, respectively. There was no significant infiltration of
any of these cell types into the spinal cord 7 days after partial
sciatic nerve ligation (SNL) (Figure 1). The vast majority of
Percoll-isolated cells were CD45-positive immune cells (92%–
99%), and 98%–99% of those were resident microglia (n = 3,
independent samples t test, n.s., non significant; Figure 1A).
Moreover, we only found very modest numbers of neutrophils,
T cells, and B cells, and their counts did not vary with injury (Fig-
ures 1B and 1C).
Enhancers can be detected via chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion (ChIP), a technique that currently requires at least tens of
thousands of cells. We therefore investigated whether Percoll
isolation, with its 98%–99% resident microglial yield, would be
sufficiently pure to allow for subsequent ChIP sequencing
(ChIP-seq) analysis. We used an antibody to probe for a specific
chromatin modification—the presence of a single methyl group
at lysine residue four of histone three (H3k4me1)—that can be
used as a proxy measure for enhancer location (Heintzman

 et al., 2007). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
and ChIP-qPCR, we found no significant signal derived from
the percentage of cells that are negative for CD45 and CD11b
or indeed the cellular debris also contained in the preparation
(Figure S1). This rules out the possibility that these factors signif-
icantly contaminate our ChIP analysis of microglia.
Genome-wide Transcriptional Profile of Isolated Spinal
Cord Microglia
RNA-seq was performed on spinal microglia after SNL or sham
surgery (n = 4, each n pooled from four lumbar cords). We found
high expression of known microglial genes, such as cathepsins
(e.g., Ctss), the fractalkine receptor (Cx3cr1), and many genes
highlighted as microglial by Butovsky et al. (2014) (e.g., Cst3,
P2ry12, Fcrls, Csfr1) (Figure 2A). Of the 88 microglial markers
reported by Butovsky et al. (2014), 71 ranked in the top 20% of
transcripts we identified by expression level (Table S1; 13,873
genes identified with cut-off set to more than three samples at
fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads
[FPKM] >0.3). Comparison of a larger list of 1,330 microglial
genes to previously published datasets (Lavin et al., 2014;
Butovsky et al., 2014) indicated a strong positive correlation
in expression profiles across all three studies (Spearman’s
r = 0.61 and 0.66, p < 0.001; Figure S2).
Next, we analyzed differential gene expression between SNL
and sham microglia. Using Deseq2, we identified 17 individual
genes that were significantly upregulated in SNL samples at
adjusted p < 0.05 (Figure 2B; Table S2). A network analysis of
known and putative protein-protein interactions further revealed
that �50% of the genes upregulated at unadjusted p < 0.05 were
functionally connected (107 out of 259; Figure 3). Visually, they
could be grouped into four main categories: genes related to
microglial activation and the subsequent immune response,
genes related to interferon signaling, lysosomal genes, and
genes related to mitosis and ribosomal protein synthesis. We
confirmed these clusters using gene ontology (GO) enrichment

separately for three experiments (1–3) using constant gates between SNL and sham. Histograms are displayed after gating for live CD45+, CD11b+ myeloid cells.

 analysis, comparing the list of upregulated genes to our com-
plete microglial gene set. Immune response terms, including
interferon gamma (IFNɣ), interferon beta (IFNb), and complement
signaling, were significantly enriched (Table S3).
We did not observe any significant downregulation of genes in
SNL microglia; however, when using all putatively dysregulated
genes (both upregulated and downregulated at unadjusted p <
0.05) as seeds for a protein-protein interaction network, some
downregulated genes did appear in our main network clusters
as defined above (Figure S3).
Protein Level and Functional Validation of RNA-Seq Data
Injury-associated gene expression increase was accompanied
by observable changes in protein levels. A western blot revealed
that Stat1 was significantly elevated in Percoll-isolated microglia
after SNL, mirroring our RNA-seq results (one sample t test,
p = 0.035, n = 3; Figure 2C). Moreover, by measuring mean fluo-
rescent intensity (MFI) of microglia via flow cytometry, we were
able to confirm the dysregulation of Fc gamma receptors, in
particular Fcgr1 (mean fold change of 1.39, one sample t test,
near significant at p = 0.07, n = 3) and Fcgr2b (mean fold change
of 1.48, one sample t test, p = 0.05, n = 3; Figure 2D).
To validate our network predictions, we moved into an in vitro
system using an undifferentiated human monocytic cell line.
Protein-protein interaction and GO analysis identified a cluster
of proteins involved in interferon signaling, including Stat1 (Fig-
ure 3), suggesting that IFNɣ might be inducing some of the
key microglial expression changes observed 7 days after
nerve injury. Indeed, mirroring our network, stimulation of our
cultured cells with IFNɣ caused a clear upregulation of
FCGR1, FCGR2B, STAT1, B2M, and CCL2, while FCGR3 was
unaffected (Figure 4A). STAT1 did not appear to play an irre-
placeable role in this process; partial knockdown of STAT1
in monocytes had no significant effect on gene regulation
Figure 3. Network of Genes Found to be Significantly Upregulated after SNL
Network analysis revealed a set of 107 functionally interconnected genes with increased expression after nerve injury that broadly clustered into four categories.
The shape of each node represents the statistical confidence at which each gene was found to be upregulated using Deseq2: unadjusted p < 0.05 (circles),
unadjusted p < 0.01 (hexagons), and adjusted p < 0.05 (pink border). The functional information contained in this analysis reduces the chance of false positive
results, but please note that they cannot be completely ruled out for individual genes, especially at p < 0.05 (circles).

 (Figure 4A), nor did pharmacological inhibition of STAT1 in vivo
have any effect on mechanical hypersensitivity after SNL in
mice (Figure 4B).
Injury-Specific Alterations of Microglial Enhancer
Profiles
Genome-wide H3K4me1 enrichment profiles of spinal cord mi-
croglia corresponded well to those of naive cortical microglia
published recently (Lavin et al., 2014). The consensus binding
profiles of sham, SNL, and cortical microglia overlapped to a sig-
nificant extent, although, as expected, SNL microglia were the
most divergent (Figure S4A).
A significant number of peaks were found to be differentially
bound in injured microglia compared to their sham counterparts
using the DiffBind algorithm with a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-
off of FDR <0.1 (Figures 5A and S4B; Table S4). The regions were
annotated to their nearest transcriptional start site, as well as
their closest regulated gene (using Deseq2 differentially regu-
lated genes at unadjusted p < 0.01). Most enhancers are likely
to occur within one megabase (Mb) of their target gene (Heinz
et al., 2015), therefore any regions that were >1 Mb from a dys-
regulated gene were disregarded. This resulted in a list of 36 pu-
tative latent enhancers and 12 putative repressed regions that
emerge as a result of nerve injury. GO and pathway analyses us-
ing GREAT revealed that regions with increased H3K4me1 bind-
ing after SNL were enriched for immune and inflammatory
response terms, such as regulation of lymphocyte and leukocyte
proliferation and inflammation mediated by chemokines and cy-
tokines (Figure S4C; Table S4).
Forty percent of our putative enhancer regions were within 500
kb of genes with abnormally high levels of expression after SNL
(Figure S4D). Previous work on latent enhancers (Ostuni et al.,
2013) indicates that 80% of binding sites emerge at this dis-
tance, and many are within 250 kb or less. In our list, 16 of 36
locations found were within 200 kb of a dysregulated gene
(Figure 5B). Indeed, the closest transcriptional start sites of
9 of these 16 were genes that were found to be overexpressed
after SNL. Fam65b, C4b, Ccl12, and Fcgr2b stood out in partic-
ular, as these were among the top upregulated genes identified
via RNA-seq (Figure 5B).
To validate our findings, we performed ChIP-qPCR to measure
H3K4me1 enrichment at selected sites in two additional, newly
Figure 4. Functional Validation of SNL-Induced Microglial Gene Network
(A) Stimulation of the undifferentiated human monocytic cell line THP1 revealed that IFNɣ indeed regulates many of the gene expression changes identified in our
RNA-seq analysis. As predicted by our network, FCGR1, FCGR2B, STAT1, CCL2, and B2M were significantly increased by IFNɣ, while FCGR3 was unaffected
(p < 0.05, ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc testing). siRNA knockdown of STAT1 did not have any effect. Plotted are ddCT values (mean + SD) after IFNɣ (+) or

 generated cohorts of neuropathic mice (2 3 n = 4), each with
their own sham controls (n = 4, n = 3). Seven out of eight sites
chosen for replication showed increased binding after SNL,
five of them significantly so as measured by independent sam-
ples t tests (Figure 5C).
Persistence of Putative Latent Enhancers 28 Days after
Nerve Injury
Our primary hypothesis is that latent enhancers might be a way
in which injury-specific changes are encoded over long periods
of time, allowing for priming of the system and ultimately the
chronification of pain. To test this, we went on to perform addi-
tional analyses of our model at later time points. RNA was ob-
tained at day 1, day 7, day 14, and day 28 after SNL. For this,
we FACS-sorted microglia from dorsal ipsilateral lumbar spinal
cord (Figure S5A), amplified the RNA using a multiple displace-
ment method, and performed high-throughput qRT-PCR using
TaqMan microfluidic cards. At day 7 after SNL, the 28 genes
deemed to pass our expression cut-off by qPCR correlated
well with our original RNA-seq (Figure 6A), serving as further
validation of the transcriptomic data presented here. Moreover,
it appeared that the transcriptional changes observed in micro-
glia were transient—the vast majority of genes had reverted
back to their pre-injury expression levels 28 days after SNL (Fig-
ures 6B and S5B). We also confirmed this at protein level:
immunofluorescent staining revealed that Fc gamma receptor
expression (CD16/C32) was still high in the ipsilateral lumbar
spinal cord at day 14, but much reduced or absent in some
cases at day 28 (Figure S6).
This was in stark contrast to what we found when we extracted
chromatin from microglia of mice 28 days after SNL or sham sur-
gery (n = 3). ChIP-qPCR indicated that several of the putative
latent enhancer regions we identified retained their increased
H3K4me1 binding levels at this late time point—up to a month af-
ter pain was first induced: C4b, Ccl12, and Ccl5 all still showed
significant enrichment (Figure 6C), and binding remained high
at several other regions (Fcgr2b, Fam65b, and Ly86), although
this was not statistically significant.

 DISCUSSION
We set out to test the hypothesis that neuropathic pain could
result in injury-specific alterations to the enhancer landscape.
For this, we investigated the spinal cord immune response after
peripheral SNL in mice, using techniques to analyze cell compo-
sition, genome-wide transcriptional alterations, and changes to
the enhancer-identifying histone mark H3K4me1.
Contrary to previous claims in the literature (Echeverry et al.,
2011), we found no evidence of peripheral immune cell infiltration
into the spinal cord after nerve injury. Moreover, our cell-type-
specific gene expression profile revealed the unique molecular
signature of the microglial inflammatory response, including
some surprising findings, such as the absence of Bdnf. Finally,
we found 16 putative enhancers that showed increased binding
in microglia 7 days after nerve injury, of which nine were within
250 kb of upregulated genes. Most intriguingly, many of these
potentially latent enhancer regions remained in place up to
28 days after the injury was first induced—a time point at which
we could show that the vast majority of transcriptional changes
had reverted back to normal.
Activity-dependent
changes
to
enhancers
have
been
described in the context of development (Gosselin et al.,
2014), immune system function (Ostuni et al., 2013), as well as
neuronal signaling (Malik et al., 2014). These range from the
appearance of completely new binding regions in mature
macrophages to the depolarization-induced priming of existing
enhancers in neurons. Both provide a mechanism by which a
stimulus could affect the response of cells in the longer term,
by altering their ability to bind certain transcription factors in
specific locations. In the context of nerve injury, alterations to
enhancer profiles therefore present a plausible way in which
maladaptive nervous system and immune responses could be
‘‘remembered,’’ become fixed in time, and ultimately contribute
to the chronification of pain.
Our results suggest the involvement of enhancers in a model
of neuropathic pain and raise a multitude of intriguing questions:
1. What
state
are
these
injury-specific
enhancers
in?
Enhancers can adopt varying conformations (inactive,
primed, poised, and active), which can only be fully char-
acterized by surveying several other chromatin marks. Are
our putative enhancer regions primed for activity at day 28,
ready to mount a more vigorous transcriptional response
upon repeat activation?
2. How are they deposited? In macrophages, it has been
shown that the deposition of new enhancer peaks requires
the combined action of various TFs including Pu.1, Stat1,
and Stat6 (Ostuni et al., 2013). This is of particular interest
in the context of our dataset, where Stat1 expression was
found to be significantly increased after SNL at both RNA
and protein level.
3. Are the observed changes in enhancer profile critical for
the development of chronic pain? Studying the direct

(A) Further validation of RNA-seq was conducted
using a TaqMan qRT-PCR array card for selected
genes at different time points after injury. Microglia
were isolated from lumbar ipsilateral dorsal horn
and sorted using FACS. Plotted here are the
ranked log2 fold changes (day 7, SNL versus
sham) of 28 genes obtained from the RNA-seq
(n = 4) versus those obtained from the qRT-PCR
(n = 3). They were strongly correlated (Spearman’s
rho = 0.61, p < 0.002). Genes in purple were
significantly dysregulated in the RNA-seq data at
adjusted p < 0.05, genes in blue reached statistical
significance via both methods.

demonstrated that the transcriptional changes in
microglia are transient. Shown here mean ddCT
values and SE for C4b, Ccl12, and Ccl5 at day 1
(SNL d1), day 7 (SNL d7), day 14 (SNL d14), and
day 28 (SNL d28) after injury compared to sham
injured animals at day 1 (SHAM d1) and day 7
(SHAM d7). See Figure S5 for more plots. The
changes observed for C4b and Ccl12 were sta-
tistically significant (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.006
and p = 0.009, respectively).

croglia at day 28 after SNL (compared to day 28
sham) demonstrated that altered H3K4me1 bind-
ing persisted at putative latent enhancers close to

 causal involvement of a specific enhancer is a complex
undertaking and involves tools such as the generation of
transgenic reporter lines or gene editing technologies
(Kearns et al., 2015), many of which are not yet adapted
for use in the CNS. Low cell numbers coupled with the
requirement for high levels of cell purity further complicate
study of enhancers in the neurosciences. Recent improve-
ments to small-scale ChIP-seq (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014)
as well as the innovative method of ATAC-seq (Buenrostro
et al., 2015) may help alleviate some of the methodological
difficulties in this area.
It may be some time before the injury-specific enhancers we
identified can be fully characterized. In the meantime, our data
provide immediately useable information about spinal cord im-
mune cell composition and microglial gene expression after
injury. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where peripheral noci-
ceptive afferents terminate, is a highly complex tissue with many
different cell types. After spinal nerve injury, the picture is further
complicated, with prior reports in the literature claiming T cell
(Costigan et al., 2009) and peripheral macrophage infiltration
(Zhang et al., 2007). Until recently though, the field has largely
been missing the cell-type-specific tools required to examine
these issues in more detail. Flow cytometry analyses are still
rare in neuroscience research, and only since 2014 have there
been specific antibodies available that allow the distinction be-
tween resident and infiltrating myeloid cells.
Here, we used one of these markers, the purinergic receptor
P2ry12, to demonstrate that 99% of myeloid cells in the spinal
cord after peripheral spinal nerve injury are resident microglia.
Previous reports of macrophage infiltration after nerve injury
may have arisen because it was hitherto necessary to irradiate
the bone marrow in order to introduce genetically tagged periph-
eral monocytes. This can result in a breakdown of the blood brain
barrier and artificially increase numbers of bone-marrow-derived
macrophages in the CNS. We also did not observe SNL-associ-
ated changes in B cell or T cell counts, all of which were very low.
Of course, we cannot exclude that T cell recruitment will start at a
later stage, more than 7 days after injury.
In addition to our flow cytometry analysis, we used RNA-seq to
characterize the transcriptional profile of acutely isolated micro-
glia. We identified several clear modules of increased activity indi-
cating that microglia are dividing and activated as expected, such
as members of the alternative complement activation pathway
(C3, Cfb C4b, C2) and their downstream receptors (Itgam
[CD11b] and Itgb2l [CD18]). One intriguing hit was the upregula-
tion of Cd244, which has previously been almost exclusively
described in the context of natural killer (NK) and memory
T cells.Weandothers(Butovskyetal.,2014)nowfinditexpressed
in naive microglia. Its upregulation upon injury raises the question
of what its function is in these cells, as in NK cells it has both acti-
vating and inhibitory potential (McNerney et al., 2005).
Our data also highlight the importance of only a few specific
chemokines and signaling pathways and may therefore help
direct efforts to find pharmacological targets. Cell-type-specific
RNA-seq confirmed a role for Ccl2, its mouse ortholog Ccl12,
and Ccl5, which have already been identified in previous litera-
ture (Old and Malcangio, 2012). Additionally, a network analysis
identified IFNɣ as a potentially important upstream mediator of
SNL-induced gene regulation in microglia—a result that we
were able to validate functionally in an undifferentiated human
monocyte cell line. IFNɣ appears to regulate the expression of
Stat1, Ccl2, and fragment-crystallizable gamma ɣ receptors
(FcɣRs). FcɣRIIb (Fcgr2b, CD32b) expression was increased in
our RNA-seq data, as well as in subsequent validation experi-
ments examining both RNA and protein. CD16 (Fcgr3) was not
found to be regulated, neither in microglia nor IFNɣ-stimulated
monocytes. The role of the activating receptor FcɣRI (Fcgr1,
CD64) was less clear: it was induced by IFNɣ in monocytes,
and there was a near-significant increase in microglia after
SNL at protein, but not transcript level. FcɣRs are the main re-
ceptors for immunoglobulins, and their balanced response is
crucial for a well-adjusted innate immune response (Nimmerjahn
and Ravetch, 2008). Shifts in FcɣR function toward too much or
too little activation have been linked to a variety of diseases,
including those with a chronic pain component, such as rheuma-
toid arthritis and inflammatory bowel syndrome (Franke et al.,
2016). At least in other cell types, like neutrophils, FcɣRs, and
in particular FcɣRIIb, can also directly impact complement-
induced responses (Karsten et al., 2012).
Spinal microglia release a host of cytokines and other media-
tors as a result of peripheral neuropathic injury that negatively
affect neuronal function. Our network suggests that this
response is driven by the delicate interplay of a few pro-inflam-
matory and immunomodulatory drivers: complements, FcɣRs,
and INFs, in particular IFNɣ.
Finally, qRT-PCR follow up of our RNA-seq study clearly high-
lighted the transient nature of the gene expression changes that
take place in microglia. One month after injury, most have re-
verted back to their pre-injury expression levels. In contrast,
several of our putative latent enhancer regions were maintained
in microglia at this time—a most intriguing observation that sug-
gests that some of the more persistent consequences of nerve
injury may be hidden in the epigenome.
In summary, our study revealed several features that charac-
terize the spinal cord microglial response in a model of persistent
pain. We have shown that it is primarily dependent on resident
microglia. We have presented a detailed molecular view of the
ensuing microglial-specific gene expression changes. Finally,
we have provided evidence for persistent injury-specific alter-
ations of the microglial enhancer landscape. We expect that
our findings will aid future research by providing several
genome-wide datasets, and we hope that they will ultimately
aid patients by deepening our understanding of why the nervous
system is chronically dysregulated in neuropathic pain.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Surgeries and Behavior
All work conformed to United Kingdom Home Office legislation (Scientific Pro-
cedures Act 1986). Male C57BL/6 mice were used throughout the study. SNL
surgery was performed by tying a 5.0 Vicryl suture through the sciatic nerve.
Corresponding sham surgery exposed the nerve, but left it intact. Mechanical
hypersensitivity was assessed with von Frey hairs using the up-down method
(Bonin et al., 2014). Fludarabine (S1229, Selleck Chemicals) or vehicle (0.9%
saline) was delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 30 mg/kg (d3 and
d7) and 100 mg/kg (d16) 1–2 hr before the behavioral assessment. The
1778

 compound is known to cross the blood brain barrier (Jensen et al., 2012), and
our dosing regime was based on previous literature (Chun et al., 1991; Frank
et al., 1999). The experimenter was blind to the treatment.
Microglial Isolation
Seven days after SNL or sham surgery, mice were sacrificed by overdose of
anesthetic and perfusion with ice-cold PBS. The spinal cord was extracted
using hydroextrusion, dounce homogenized in 0.2% BSA in Hank’s balanced
salt solution (HBSS), and microglia isolated using a Percoll density gradient
(37% versus 70%). Cells were counted on a hemocytometer and further pro-
cessed for RNA extraction, chromatin extraction, flow cytometry, or FACS. For
all experiments, two to eight segments of mouse cord were extracted on a
given day (2–43 sham and 2–43 SNL) and pooled onto two Percoll gradients
to make up one n for each group. For ChIP-seq, �20,000 cells were removed
to allow cytometry analysis of each sample before processing the remainder
for chromatin extraction.
Flow Cytometry
Microglia were centrifuged (200 3 g for 3 min at 4�C) and stained with Live/
Dead fixable yellow dye (L-34959, Life Technologies) in HBSS for 30 min on
ice in the dark. After a second spin, cells were stained in FACS buffer (0.4%
BSA, 15 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA in HBSS) with rat anti-P2RY12 antibody
(a gift from Dr. Oleg Butovsky) for 20 min on ice in the dark. After a wash in
FACS buffer, an APC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used
(A10931, Life Technologies). Cells were then washed once more, before being
incubated with the remaining directly conjugated primary antibodies, all raised
in rat and obtained from Biolegend: Alexa-Fluor-488-CD45 (103121), Pacific
Blue-CD11b (101223), PE-Ly6C (128007), PE/Cy7-Ly6G (127617), Brilliant
Violet-CD3 (100237), and APC/Cy7-CD19 (115529). The stained microglia
were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and kept in FACS buffer
until flow cytometry on a BD SORP Fortessa at the National Institute for Health
Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) flow core facility at King’s
College London. The following controls were employed to ensure accurate
compensation: unstained microglial cells, single-staining controls (cells for
live/dead, BD Comp beads [BD Biosciences, 552845] for all other colors),
and cells in which the primary anti-mouse P2RY12 antibody was omitted to
control for potential background arising from the APC anti-rabbit secondary
antibody. For any data analysis, gating was kept constant across conditions.
Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) analysis was performed after staining cells
first with Live/Dead fixable yellow dye and subsequently with the following pri-
mary antibodies (all from Biolegend): Alexa-Fluor-488-CD45 (103121), Pacific
Blue-CD11b (101223), PE-CD64 (139303), and APC-CD16/C32(101325).
Experiments were conducted in biological triplicate and analyzed in a within-
experiment manner, whereby all gates were kept the same between a sham
and SNL sample pair. After the MFI was determined, a ratio of SNL/sham
was generated, which was then compared across experiments using a one-
sample t test with a test value of 1.
FACS
Microglia were centrifuged and stained with primary antibodies in FACS buffer
for 20 min on ice in the dark (Pacific Blue-CD45, 103125, APC/Cy7-CD11b,
101225, Biolegend). DAPI was used as a viability dye. Unstained cells and
single staining controls were employed as described above. Microglia were
purified on a BD FACS Aria II Cell Sorter at the NIHR BRC flow core facility
at King’s College London and collected either into RLT buffer for RNA extrac-
tion or in FACS buffer for chromatin extraction.
Chromatin Extraction
Cells were shaken in 1% formaldehyde in FACS buffer for 5 min at room
temperature and the fixation reaction terminated by the addition of 0.125 M
glycine. After a wash with PBS and proteinase inhibitors, microglia were
pelleted and stored at �80�C until lysis.
ChIP
Samples were generated in pairs of SNL and sham (each a pool from 43 mice)
and stored at �80�C. Once a full experimental set was obtained (n = 4 pairs
for sequencing; n = 8, n = 7, n = 6 pairs for three separate qRT-PCR studies),
samples were lysed and pooled once more to obtain sufficient material
for downstream analysis (final n = 2 for sequencing, n = 4, n = 3 and n = 3
for 33 qRT-PCR studies). Cells for ChIP-seq and the first qPCR validation
cohort (Figure 5C) were derived from the entire lumbar enlargement, while cells
for the other two validation cohorts (Figures 5C and 6C) were derived from
ipsilateral lumbar enlargements. Chromatin was sheared in a Diagenode
bath sonicator with eight repeats of 5-min cycles (30 s on, 30 s off). Immuno-
precipitation was performed with an antibody against H3K4me1 (ab8895, lot
GR159018-1, Abcam) using the Diagenode True MicroChIP kit following man-
ufacturer’s instructions (AB-002-0016, Diagenode). Before precipitation, 10%
of the input chromatin was removed and decrosslinked. Two microliters were
used to check DNA concentrations on a Qubit fluorometer, as well as shear
sizes on an Agilent2100 Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity ChIP. The remainder
was used for sequencing or qRT-PCR controls.
ChIP-qPCR
DNA obtained from ChIP was amplified on a Roche LightCycler480 using
SYBR green mastermix (04707516001, Roche) and standard run parameters.
Each sample was normalized to its own 10% input control and negative control
primer signal to account for individual differences in initial chromatin amount
and noise levels. Standard and melt curves were generated for each run to
ensure adequate primer efficiency and selectivity. See Table S5 for primer
sequences.
RNA Extraction
For RNA-seq, lumbar cords and Percoll isolation was used, in order to allow
direct comparison to our ChIP-seq dataset. For qRT-PCR validation of our
RNA-seq data, we FACS-sorted the microglia as described above, using
only dorsal ipsilateral lumbar segments. In all cases, cells were lysed in RLT
buffer with beta-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was extracted using a QIAGEN
RNeasy Micro Kit (74004) following the manufacturer’s protocol with some
minor modifications. RNA quality and quantity was assessed on an Agilent
Bioanalyzer Pico chip. For sequencing, RNA was then shipped to Oxford for
library preparation (see below). For qRT-PCR, RNA was amplified and con-
verted to cDNA using the QIAGEN Repli-G single cell WTA kit according to
the handbook instructions.
qRT-PCR
cDNA was quantified using a Qubit ssDNA assay kit, diluted to 2 ng/ml and
loaded onto TaqMan microfluidic PCR array cards. We used the ddCT
method, normalizing each sample to the average of several housekeeping
genes and the same naive microglial pool. See Table S5 for the TaqMan
probes used (Life Technologies).
Protein Extraction and Western Blotting
Isolated microglia were lysed in 0.2% SDS in water with proteinase and phos-
phatase inhibitors. The samples were reduced in 53 Laemmli buffer (50 mM
Tris, ph 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M DTT, beta-mercaptoethanol) and
run on NuPage Novex 4%–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies).
After transfer onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, staining was
performed using the following antibodies: STAT1 (9172, Cell Signaling),
alpha-tubulin (T9026, Sigma Aldrich), and ECL anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (10794347 and 10094724, Fisher Scientific). The signal
was exposed using an ECL prime kit (RPN2232, Amersham) and visualized on
a UVP Biospectrum 810 Imaging System.
In Vitro Experiments
Confluent (70%–80%) THP1 cells (P3, P5, P6) were incubated for 5 hr in serum-
free DMEM, supplemented with small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection re-
agent (jetPEI, Polyplus) pre-mixed with either scrambled (AM4611, Ambion)
or STAT1 (s279, Ambion)-validated siRNA (20 pM). Subsequently, the culture
medium was replaced with fresh DMEM and 1.5% FCS, and cells were rested
overnight. The transfection was repeated the following day, and the cells were
kept for another 24 hr infresh culture medium.Prior to stimulation, siRNA-trans-
fected cells were serum-starved in plain DMEM for 3 hr. Finally, cells were stim-
ulated with IFNg (40 ng/ml) for 6 hr to determine acute regulation of transcripts
and avoid potential effects from cytokines synthesized and secreted by THP1
Cell Reports 15, 1771–1781, May 24, 2016
1779
 cells following stimulation with IFNg. Cells were lysed in TRK lysis buffer
(Omega Bio-Tek), RNA was extracted using the EZNA total RNA kit I (Omega
Bio-Tek) and converted to cDNA using the high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit
(Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche LightCycler480
using the following pre-validated TaqMan primer/probe mixes (Applied
Biosystems): FCGR2B (Hs01634996_s1), FCGR1 (Hs00417598_m1), STAT1
(Hs01013996_m1), and CCL2 (Hs00234140_m1). GAPDH was used as house-
keeper for ddCT calculations.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused with 0.2 M PB followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and
lumbar spinal cords were dissected, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose, and cut
on a cryostat in 20-mm sections. Cords were collected from two separate
time points (day 14 and day 28 after nerve injury) from both SNL and SHAM
mice (n = 3 per SNL time point, n = 2 per sham time point). The tissue was
stained by blocking in 10% BSA for 1 hr, followed by incubation with the pri-
mary antibodies overnight (Iba1, 019-19741, Wako; CD16/CD32, 553142,
BD Biosciences; PE-CD64, 139303, Biolegend). After several PBS washes,
the secondary antibodies were added for 2 hr (anti-rat Alexa488, anti-rabbit
Alexa594), and the slides mounted after more washes with hard-set medium
containing DAPI (Vector Labs). Images were taken on a Zeiss confocal
microscope.
Sequencing
Sequencing was performed by the High Throughput Genomics Group at the
Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (Oxford University). RNA libraries
were prepared using a SMARTer Ultra Low Input HV kit (634820, Clontech).
ChIP-seq libraries were prepared on the automated Wafergen’s Apollo Prep
system using a PrepX ILMN 32i 96 sample library kit (400076, Wafergen Bio-
systems). All RNA libraries and all ChIP libraries were prepared together to
avoid batch effects. In both cases, custom adaptor and barcode tags were
used (50-P-GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG, 50-ACACTCTT
TCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT). Samples were amplified (18 cycles
for ChIP, 13 cycles for RNA) and multiplexed in replicate flow cells on an Illu-
mina HiSeq2500 platform to yield 50-bp paired-end reads at a depth of at least
40 M (ChIP-seq) or 20 M (RNA-seq).
RNA-Seq Data Analysis
Samples (n = 4) were sequenced, each consisting of microglia obtained from a
pool of four sham or four SNL lumbar cords. Quality control, alignment, and
expression level analyses were performed on the Galaxy server (Blankenberg
et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005; Goecks et al., 2010), while differential expres-
sion was performed using Bio-Linux 7 (Field et al., 2006). FastQC (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) showed that base calls were
of high quality across the full length of the reads. Alignments were performed to
mouse mm9 using tophat2 (Kim et al., 2013) with a maximum of two multiple
alignments permitted (-g 2). Alignment rates were between 74% and 88%
(average 85.26%). The cufflinks algorithm (Trapnell et al., 2010) was run to
determine FPKM values (multiple read and effective length corrections were
used, and fragments of <150 bp in size were excluded to avoid unreliable
quantification for genes significantly shorter than the average fragment size).
Genes with an FPKM of at least 0.3 in more than three samples within a group
were considered expressed. For differential expression, count data were
generated using HT-seq (Anders et al., 2015) and fed into the Deseq2
algorithm (Love et al., 2014) in R. Network analyses were conducted using
STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2015), allowing all active prediction methods at me-
dium confidence (default). Only nodes connected to the main network cluster
were included in the final network. Gene ontology was determined in GOrilla
(Eden et al., 2009): lists of upregulated or downregulated genes at unadjusted
p < 0.05 (Deseq2) were compared to a background list of all microglial genes
(cufflinks, FPKM cutoff of 0.3 in at least three samples). For visualizations,
heatmaps were generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer software (MeV)
and networks edited in Cytoscape.
ChIP-Seq Data Analysis
As above, FastQC and alignments were performed on the Galaxy server
(Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005; Goecks et al., 2010). Reads
were aligned to the mm9 genome using bowtie2 with the following parame-
ters: -n 0, -e 40, -m 1, -best. Various additional quality controls were per-
formed: CHANCE (Diaz et al., 2012), phantompeaks (Landt et al., 2012),
and fraction of reads in peaks analysis. Peak finding was performed using
MACS1.4.2 with default parameters (Zhang et al., 2008), and differential bind-
ing was tested with the DiffBind package in R (Ross-Innes et al., 2012).
