Abstract
OBJECTIVES—To determine the sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, cognitive 
and functional status associated with baseline prevalence and new need for help taking medication 
three years later, and to construct a brief scale indicative of need for help taking medications.
DESIGN—Retrospective cross-sectional and 3-year longitudinal study
SETTING—Five-county area in north-central Piedmont, North Carolina
PARTICIPANTS—Representative community-resident sample of African Americans and Whites 
age 65 and older (N=4,136)
MEASUREMENTS—Information was obtained in person in the home, using structured 
questionnaires. Health conditions included sensory impairment and self-report of physician-
diagnosed conditions. Cognitive status was assessed by the 10-item Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire. Functional status was assessed by the 3-item Rosow-Breslau, 5-item Katz basic 
activities of daily living (ADL), and a modified 6-item OARS instrumental (I) ADL scale.

 RESULTS—Characteristics associated with need for help taking medications were age (≥80 
years), being male, living with others, four or more chronic conditions and impaired cognitive or 
functional status (c-statistic 0.94, 77.1% sensitivity, 87.9% specificity). Predictors of new need for 
help with medications 3 years later included older age (age 75 and over at baseline), being male, 
and impaired cognitive and functional status (c-statistic 0.75)
CONCLUSION—This brief scale should help to identify persons currently needing help with 
medications and be useful in assisting clinicians with patient medication management.

INTRODUCTION
As age increases a larger proportion of older people develop medication-taking problems.1 
Few studies, however, have tried to identify the characteristics of those who have, or who 
may develop need for help taking medications,2–5 or the prevalence and incidence of this 
problem. Such information is critical, since optimal management of chronic medical 
conditions relies heavily on appropriate prescribing and appropriate use of medications, and 
on awareness of the extent of the problem. Poor adherence can result in worsening of 
disease, increased health care costs, and death.4
Medication self-management (ability to handle taking medication without assistance), is a 
complex process requiring both cognitive and physical abilities.6 The median number of 
medications used by persons over 65 has doubled from 2 to 4 over the last 20 years, with 
individuals on multiple medications having worse health status.7 Those who cannot or do 
not take their medications properly have poorer health outcomes, and higher all-cause 
mortality.8–10 Patients 65 and older experience a two-fold higher risk of drug-related 
complications.11 In a large retrospective cohort of Medicare enrollees in an ambulatory 
setting, 27.6% of all drug-related adverse events were considered preventable, with 21.1% of 
these events due to patient error such as taking the wrong dose or wrong medication.12
Given information already available, we expect that the personal characteristics associated 
with needing help taking medications will be associated with factors attendant on age,13–14 
including decline in cognitive functioning,15 the number of medical conditions present, the 
number of medications prescribed,16–17 and self-reported instrumental and basic activities of 
daily living.18–20 Insofar as education and income are associated with health status,21–22 it is 
possible that these characteristics may also help to explain need for help with medications. 
We have examined data from a representative, older, community-resident sample of African 
Americans and Whites. Our aims were 1) to determine the sociodemographic characteristics, 
and general health, cognitive and functional status associated with the baseline prevalence, 
and new occurrence three years later, of the need for help taking medication, and 2) based on 
the information obtained, to construct a brief scale indicative of need for help taking 
medications.

 METHODS
Sample
Our data come from the first two in-person waves (1986, 1989) of the 10-year (1986–1996) 
longitudinal Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke 
EPESE), based on a probability sample of persons aged 65 years or older living in 
households in a five-county Piedmont area of North Carolina.23 African Americans were 
oversampled to increase statistical precision for this group. Of the 4,162 persons 
successfully interviewed (80% of those contacted), 54% (2,261) were African-American, 
45% (1,875) White, and 26 of other race/ethnicity; 35% were male. Roughly half came from 
the single urban and half from the four rural counties. For all participants, survival status 
was determined by search of National Death Index records.24
Sample members of “other” race (N = 26), and those for whom information on ability to 
take their own medications was missing (N = 30), were excluded, resulting in an analysis 
sample of 4,106 older African Americans and Whites. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center. Written consent was 
obtained from sample members or their legal representatives.
Information obtained
Information was obtained in person in the home, using structured questionnaires. When the 
sample member was unable to respond (or unwilling and designated another person), 
information was obtained from a proxy respondent (3.9%, n=158), an adult who had close 
contact with the sample member, and knew that person well (spouse, kin, close friend). 
Proxies provided only objective information.
Dependent variable—The following question indicated need for help taking medications: 
“Are you (is he/she) able to take your (his/her) medicine without help (in the right doses at 
the right time)?” (need help coded 1, no help needed coded 0).
Covariates
Sociodemographic characteristics included age (categorized as 65–69/70–74/75–79/≥80 
years), sex (reference: female), race (reference: White), education (≤8 years/some high 
school/≥completed high school), annual income from all sources (<$5000/$5,000-<$10,000/
≥$10,000), and whether living alone.
Health conditions included sensory impairment (poor vision, poor hearing), and self-report 
of physician-diagnosed stroke, diabetes, hypertension, heart attack, and cancer (skin cancer 
excluded). Physician-diagnosed conditions were summed, and categorized as 0–1/2–3/4–5 
conditions. Number of prescription and over-the-counter medications being taken was 
determined by review of containers, and categorized as 0–2 vs ≥3 for over-the-counter drugs, 
and 0–5 vs ≥6 for prescription drugs, based on review of the distribution present.
Cognitive status was assessed by the 10-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire,25 
with 0–3 errors considered cognitively intact vs ≥4 errors indicating cognitive difficulty.

 Functional status was assessed by the 3-item Rosow-Breslau,26 5-item Katz basic activities 
of daily living (ADL),27 and the 7-item older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) 
instrumental (I) ADL scale,28 from which the question on need for help with medications 
was excluded (i.e., resulting in a modified 6-item IADL scale). Information on the validity 
and reliability of these measures had been determined previously.28 On each scale, each item 
was scored dichotomously (able to do unaided [coded 0] vs need help or unable to do [coded 
1]). The items in each scale were summed, and dichotomized to indicate whether there were 
any problems (coded 1), or none (coded 0). (The specific items in the IADL and ADL scales 
are given in the on-line Appendix.)
Statistical analysis
To maintain the sample, missing data for education (1.6%), income (18.9%), Rosow-Breslau 
(4.3%), and IADL (2.3%) were imputed using stochastic regression imputation.29 A logical 
imputation approach was used for the SPMSQ (1.2% missing), e.g., if the missing item was 
easier than an item that had been answered correctly, the missing item was coded as correct. 
Information on vision was excluded because of substantial missing data.
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, N, %, chi square) were used to characterize 
the sample and to examine differences between those needing help vs those not needing help 
to take medications. A two-phase analysis strategy was employed in an effort to reduce the 
number of comparisons when developing multivariable logistic regression models. The 
candidate predictor variables were grouped into chunks (sociodemographic; health 
conditions and medications; sensory loss, cognitive and functional status), with each chunk 
entered into a separate multivariable logistic regression. If the chunk as a whole was 
significantly associated with the dependent variable, we retained the significant individual 
predictor variables present. By prior decision, age, sex, race, and education were retained 
regardless of significance status. The Rosow-Breslau was retained to maintain information 
on the entire range of functional status. The independent variables entered into the final 
baseline model are displayed in Table 2. Multicollinearity of the candidate variables was 
assessed and found not to present a problem. Pairwise correlations among Katz ADL, 6-item 
IADL, and Rosow-Breslau ranged from 0.33–0.47, which do not approach levels such as 
0.70 which threaten model validity. A sensitivity analysis, in which those not currently 
taking medications were excluded, showed inconsequential differences with the results 
shown in this manuscript.
Following analysis of baseline data, we checked whether the significant baseline variables 
also predicted need for help three years later in survivors that needed no help with 
medications at baseline
Although adjustment for sampling design is not considered necessary when, as here, 
sampling characteristics are included in analysis,30 we nevertheless checked to determine 
whether design effects should be taken into account. The resulting design effect (1.44) is 
considered low, indicating that sampling design has little effect on the generalizability of the 
results. We nevertheless used person weights to more accurately indicate the prevalence of 
self-reported need for help taking medications at baseline, and three years later.

 Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, we determined which set of 
variables significantly associated with both baseline (prevalent) and new need for help 
taking medications three years later best constituted a rapid scale to identify such need. All 
analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC). The threshold of p=.05 
determined statistical significance.
RESULTS
Baseline Cross-sectional Results
Two thirds of the sample were female, 55% were African American, nearly 40% were age 
75 or older; education was limited (fewer than half had gone beyond grade school), and 
income was low (Table 1, also on-line Table 1, with row-wise description).
At baseline, 7.1% (n=291; weighted: 7.14%) of the sample needed help taking medications. 
While 9% were taking no medication, they reported a higher rate of having trouble taking 
medications (8.7%) than did the group taking any medications (6.9%). Those needing help 
taking their medications were, on average, 5.6 years older, more likely to be male, African 
American, averaged 1.7 fewer years of education, lower income, and were less likely to live 
alone. They reported poorer hearing, more health conditions, a larger number of prescription 
medications but fewer over-the-counter drugs. Their cognitive status was poorer, as was their 
functional status.
After including pre-determined demographic characteristics and the Rosow-Breslau, and 
excluding non-significant variables (see Statistical Analysis section), we further excluded 
income from the multivariable analysis since the association with income in controlled 
analyses was inconsistent. Further analysis was unable to explain this finding, which did not 
occur when only demographic characteristics were included in the model.
Information in Table 2 indicates that persons age 80 and over had a 56% greater odds of 
needing help with medications than those aged 65–69; men were nearly twice as likely as 
women to need help; those who lived with others, who reported four or more chronic 
conditions, or had mobility problems had more than twice the odds of needing help. The 
odds of needing help was four to 16 times greater among those with impaired cognitive 
functioning or impaired instrumental or basic ADL. Race, level of education, and high 
number of prescription drugs were not associated with needing help with medications. The 
c-statistic for this analysis was 0.941, indicating high discriminative ability for this model.
Predicting new need for help with medications three years later
At baseline 3,815 participants needed no help in taking their medications; 3,090 were 
available for the full model analysis three years later, of whom 349 (11.3%; weighted: 
11.0%) now needed help. Drop-out was due to death (12.8%, n=489), refusal (4.0%, n=151), 
loss to follow-up (1.4%, n=44), and incomplete information (1.3%, n=41). We re-ran the 
final full baseline model to determine whether the variables associated with needing help 
taking medications at baseline also predicted new need for such help three years later. In the 
fully adjusted model, predictors of new 3-year need for help with medications included older 
age (age 75 and over at baseline), being male, White race, and impaired cognitive and

 functional status. With the exception of the oldest age, the predicted odds of needing help 
were lower than the cross-sectional odds. Living alone and having multiple chronic 
conditions were no longer predictive of needing help, but being African American was 
newly protective. Education and number of prescription medications remained non-
significant. The c-statistic (0.5 indicates no discriminative ability, 1.0 indicates perfect 
discriminative ability), for new 3-year need for help with medications was 0.752. Thus, a 
core set of characteristics was both associated with, and predicted new 3-year need for help 
taking medications; some variables were consistently not associated, while others were less 
stable in this regard.
To construct a brief scale indicative of need for help with medications we then selected those 
variables that were consistently associated with needing help: age (dichotomized for further 
analysis as 65–74 vs ≥75), sex, SPMSQ, modified OARS IADL, and Katz ADL. We omitted 
the Rosow-Breslau from further consideration since approximately half of those needing no 
help with their medications were impaired on this measure. Keeping age, sex, and SPMSQ 
as a core set, we determined whether the addition of ADL, IADL, or both measures yielded 
the best sensitivity and specificity for determining current need for help, using ROC 
analysis. The best combination included age (≥75), sex (male), SPMSQ (≥4 errors), ≥1 
IADL, and ≥1 ADL problem. With a potential scoring range of 0–5, a score of ≥3 had 
sensitivity 77.1%, specificity 87.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) 32.1%, negative 
predictive value (NPV) 98.1% (c=.905) (Figure 1). Details are given in the on-line 
Appendix.
Predicting new 3-year need for help with medication, the same combination of variables, 
with the same cut-points, had sensitivity 32.0%, specificity 92.8%, PPV 36.2%, NPV 91.5% 
(c=.716). However, sensitivity and specificity are improved with a cut-point of ≥2 
(sensitivity 56.9%, specificity 76.9%; PPV 23.9%, NPV 93.3%) (c=.704).
DISCUSSION
There is a paucity of information on factors associated with or predictive of need for help 
taking medications among older community residents. We found that, in 1986/87, 7.1% 
reported needing such help. This prevalence rate agrees with other studies of persons age 65 
and over which have used a comparable assessment: 7% in Durham county; 6% in both a 
statewide survey in Virginia, and in Cleveland, Ohio,31 and 7.6% in the Canadian Study of 
Health and Aging (data recalculated to adjust for differential oversampling by age).32 Our 
prevalence rate of 17.6% for persons age 80 and over agrees with the 17.9% reported by the 
Newcastle 85+ study,33 however, the Health and Retirement Survey found a prevalence rate 
of 6.2% in 1995, declining to 5.8% in 2004 in a representative US sample age 75 and over.34 
When need for help with medications was examined in terms of time till death, 14% of a 
nationally representative sample age 50 and over required help two years prior to death, with 
32% needing help in the last month of life.1 Among persons who survived for three years, 
who had not needed help initially, 11.3% (weighted: 11.0%) now reported needing help. We 
have been unable to find published comparison information. Given an increase in the 
number and proportion of older persons, a doubling in use of medications,7 and a marked 
increase in need for help within two years of death,1 a problem is present.

 Our population included all subjects including those who were not taking an over-the-
counter or prescription medication at the time of the baseline assessment. Their reported 
problems taking medications likely reflects a previous episode, or the need to handle as 
needed medications. Adjusted analysis indicated greater need for help taking medications 
among men, persons age 80 and over, those living with others, those with multiple chronic 
conditions, and impaired cognitive and functional status. Level of education, race, and a 
higher number of medications were not associated with need for help taking medications. 
Variables associated with prevalent need overlapped with those predicting new need for help 
three years later: again men, older persons, and poor cognitive and functional status 
predicted need for help. And again, number of medications was irrelevant. However, while 
race became significant (lower odds of needing help among African Americans, possibly 
because of differences in survival at older ages), living alone and number of chronic 
conditions lost significance. Aside from cognitive status,35 there is no consensus concerning 
characteristics associated with medication management ability.
The characteristics we examined to determine need for help taking medications fell into 
three categories: characteristics associated with both current and new need for help in three 
years’ time; characteristics associated with neither; and characteristics where the association 
was inconsistent.
Characteristics associated with both current and new need for help in three years’ time, 
included increased age, male gender, and impaired cognitive and functional status. We found 
that higher age was consistently associated with need for help with medications. This is to 
be expected given that number of medications (and with it drug complexity), increase with 
patient age,17,36 and that age has been found to be an important predictor of medication self-
management.37
There is no consistency across publications as to whether it is men or women who need help 
taking their medications.38,39 Our finding that older men are more likely to report needing 
help may reflect our study’s geographical area, and its’ cultural norms for the generation of 
seniors we studied. In agreement with the literature, we found that cognitive function was a 
consistent predictor of medication-taking ability.15,37,40 Executive function, in particular, has 
been identified as a significant determinant.41 Those.with mild cognitive impairment, who 
were otherwise functioning independently, have been shown to have trouble taking their 
medications.42
Ability to take one’s own medications is a recognized instrumental ADL, so the association 
between need for help taking medication and functional status is to be expected.43 In 
addition, a narrative review of the association between medications and functional decline44 
found decline in functioning associated with polypharmacy and with some medications.
Characteristics associated with neither current nor new 3-year need for help included 
education and taking ≥6 prescription medications. This may be due to the association of 
education and number of prescription medications with age, so that in multivariable analysis 
age accounts for both characteristics. Medications are more likely to be modified or added 
gradually and incrementally, so that only a small additional piece of information must be

 incorporated each time, and that information is practiced multiple times. Under such 
circumstances level of education may become less important. Based on these observations, 
seniors who have preserved IADL/ADL function and memory may still retain the ability to 
take medications independently.
Inconsistent characteristics included living with others and reporting four or more chronic 
conditions (associated with current need for help), and being African American (predicted 
reduced new 3-year need). The finding that a larger proportion of patients who lived with 
someone had a current need for help, but not new 3-year need for help, may be related to the 
fact that persons who live with someone already had an existing need to manage 
medications. We have no good explanation for the protective finding for African Americans. 
It may be a peculiarity of current data, and needs to be explored in other datasets. The 
finding on reduced need for help by African Americans over time may reflect a cross-over 
effect regarding both survival and functional status.45
Our findings have practical application. Omitting the Rosow-Breslau, but otherwise 
accepting all five variables associated with both prevalent and new 3-year need for help 
taking medications, the brief scale we constructed (age ≥75, being male, ≥4 errors on the 
SPMSQ, ≥1 IADL problem, ≥1 basic ADL problem) identified persons currently needing 
help with 77.1% sensitivity and 87.9% specificity. While this measure did not perform as 
well in predicting need for help in three years’ time, it facilitates identification of those 
currently needing help. Demographic characteristics are already part of the medical record, 
and the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit recommends obtaining information on cognitive 
and functional state. If already collected in the clinic, this measure should not require 
additional data gathering for the tool to be used.
This study has both strengths and weaknesses. In analysis we have included the main, 
readily measurable characteristics considered to be associated with medication-taking 
problems. We were, however, unable to include either visual problems (causing difficulties 
reading medication directions) because of a substantial amount of missing data, or a measure 
of depression.46 The latter was not obtained when a proxy was needed, and a large 
proportion of persons needing help with their medications used a proxy. Self-report bias may 
be an additional limitation, however, such reports have been found to be valid and reliable.28 
Further, we were limited by the information collected in our dataset, and were not able to 
adjust for possible bias associated with higher income resulting in greater access to 
prescribed medications (and so greater opportunity for problems with medications). The 
initial data were obtained nearly three decades ago, however medication-taking problems 
still remain. While there are indications that need for help with medications has been 
declining,34 the problem may become more severe since the number of persons 65 years of 
age and older with multiple chronic conditions and taking multiple medications has been 
increasing.7,17 Our data come from the southern region of the U.S., and may not be 
representative of the U.S. in general.
Our strengths include use of a representative, older, community-based sample of African 
Americans and Whites. Our multivariable analyses indicate the more general experience of 
older persons, and are not restricted to experience with a particular medication, or a

 particular disease.47 Our findings are easy to use, and do not depend on gathering 
information other than that mandated (age, cognitive status, and functional status) during the 
Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. Patients needing help may be identified by physicians, 
nurses and/or pharmacists, and appropriate intervention put in place.
Conclusion
In our cohort of seniors age 65 and over, 7% needed help when seen initially. Among those 
surviving for three years, 11% developed a need for help. Our final model showed that a 
limited set of mandated information (age, sex, cognitive impairment, and any impaired 
instrumental or basic ADL) could identify need for help taking medications with 77.1% 
sensitivity and 87.9% specificity. How help is to be provided remains an issue, but 
identifying the need and the magnitude of that need is a first step in that direction.
