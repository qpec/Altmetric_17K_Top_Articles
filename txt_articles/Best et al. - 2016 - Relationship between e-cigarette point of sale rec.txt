Abstract
Background: There has been a rapid increase in the retail availability of e-cigarettes in the UK and elsewhere. It is
known that exposure to cigarette point-of-sale (POS) displays influences smoking behaviour and intentions in
young people. However, there is as yet no evidence regarding the relationship between e-cigarette POS display
exposure and e-cigarette use in young people.
Methods: This cross sectional survey was conducted in four high schools in Scotland. A response rate of 87 % and
a total sample of 3808 was achieved. Analysis was by logistic regression on e-cigarette outcomes with standard
errors adjusted for clustering within schools. The logistic regression models were adjusted for recall of other e-
cigarette adverts, smoking status, and demographic variables. Multiple chained imputation was employed to assess
the consistency of the findings across different methods of handling missing data.
Results: Adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes in small shops were more likely to have tried an e-cigarette
(OR 1.92 99 % CI 1.61 to 2.29). Adolescents who recalled seeing e-cigarettes for sale in small shops (OR 1.80 99 %
CI 1.08 to 2.99) or supermarkets (OR 1.70 99 % CI 1.22 to 2.36) were more likely to intend to try them in the next
6 months.
Conclusions: This study has found a cross-sectional association between self-reported recall of e-cigarette POS
displays and use of, and intention to use, e-cigarettes. The magnitude of this association is comparable to that
between tobacco point of sale recall and intention to use traditional cigarettes in the same sample. Further
longitudinal data is required to confirm a causal relationship between e-cigarette point of sale exposure and their
use and future use by young people.

Background
There is increasing concern about the rising prevalence
of e-cigarette use among children and young people in
particular, that e-cigarette use is increasing among young
people who have never smoked (never smokers) [1]. Al-
though e-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than
smoking, the long term health impact of e-cigarette use
by never smokers and the long term consequences of
dual use (e-cigarette and tobacco smoking) are uncertain
[2]. In this context, it is important that we under-
stand what factors predispose adolescents to initiate
e-cigarette use.
It has been clearly demonstrated that increased avail-
ability of cigarettes is associated with higher consump-
tion. For example, a higher tobacco retail outlet density
in a young person’s home environment increases the
probability of current smoking and ever smoking [3] and
the same is true for current smoking in adults [4]. The
effect of increased taxes on tobacco similarly reduces
availability to young people and decreases consumption
[5, 6]. Young people’s perceived ease of access to

 cigarettes has been shown to interact with the social de-
sirability of smoking to reduce tobacco experimentation
[7]. Point of sale (POS) displays of tobacco products in-
fluence young people to take up smoking. Cross sec-
tional studies in the UK and New Zealand have shown
that self-reported recall of tobacco POS is related to
smoking susceptibility in young never smokers [8, 9] and
that young people who notice tobacco POS are more
likely to be current smokers [10]. A longitudinal study in
the US found that young never smokers who recall to-
bacco POS are more likely to be smokers at 30 month
follow up [11]. Studies of the effect of tobacco point of
sale bans in various parts of the world have shown the
reversibility of these effects. After the POS ban in
Australia young people had reduced odds of being
current smokers [12] and in Ireland young people’s per-
ception of smoking prevalence dropped following the
POS ban [13]. Systematic reviews have concluded there
is a relationship between tobacco POS exposure and
smoking related outcomes in young people [14–16]. It is
plausible that POS displays of e-cigarettes may have
similar influence.
The e-cigarette market is undergoing a period of sub-
stantial growth internationally [17] and the number of
convenience-type
stores
stocking
and
displaying
e-
cigarettes is increasing rapidly [18, 19]. In Scotland,
around 77 % of tobacco retailers sold e-cigarettes in
2014 and around 49 % had e-cigarette POS displays [20].
It is not known what impact the increase in retail avail-
ability and in-store promotion of e-cigarettes has on the
likelihood of young people trying e-cigarettes. This study
is the first to examine e-cigarette POS exposure and use
in young people. It also compares the relationship
between e-cigarette POS exposure and use with the
well-characterised association between cigarette POS ex-
posure and tobacco smoking. We cannot assume these
relationships will be similar because the cigarette market
and brands are far more established and more instantly
recognisable to potential purchasers than the relatively
recent and variable presence of e-cigarettes in the retail
environment.
The regulatory environment for e-cigarettes is very dif-
ferent to that for tobacco. While most tobacco advertis-
ing and promotion is prohibited in the UK [21] and sale
to under 18 year olds illegal, currently e-cigarettes are
not subject to such regulation. This will change when
the
European
Union’s
Tobacco
Products
Directive
(2014/40/EU), replacing Directive (2001/37/EC), comes
into force in May 2016. After that time existing rules re-
garding the cross border advertising and promotion of
tobacco products will apply to e-cigarettes. Therefore,
until after May 2016 there are no specific legal con-
straints on how e-cigarettes are marketed across the EU.
Even after this time it will be left to the discretion of
member states whether they decide to impose age limits
for purchase, restrictions on flavourings and/or POS
promotion of e-cigarettes. For example, in Scotland the
Health (Tobacco, Nicotine etc. and Care) (Scotland) Bill
was passed in March 2016. This prohibits e-cigarette
sales to under 18s but does not ban outright POS dis-
plays. This creates a window of opportunity for the mar-
keting and promotion of e-cigarettes.
Young people are not only exposed to e-cigarette ad-
verts through POS displays but also from TV, billboards,
print media and the internet. Experimental research has
shown that exposure to e-cigarette TV adverts increases the
likelihood that adolescents will intend to try e-cigarettes in
the future [22].
This Scottish study examines the relationship between
the recall of e-cigarette POS displays and children’s use
and future intention to use e-cigarettes controlling for
exposure to online advertising of e-cigarettes, e-cigarette
advertising via other media, smoking status and demo-
graphic factors. In order to compare the size of effects
we also examine the relationship of cigarette point of
sale exposure to intention to smoke cigarettes in the
same sample. To our knowledge information on young
people’s recall of e-cigarettes in retail outlets and use
and intention to use e-cigarettes has not been collected
in any other survey to date so this is the first and cur-
rently the sole source of information on this important
and policy relevant topic.
Method
Study
The data presented here were collected as part of an on-
going 6-year multi-modal study designed to assess the
impact of Scottish legislation banning tobacco POS dis-
plays on young people’s smoking-related attitudes and
behaviours [23]. The information on e-cigarette advertis-
ing exposure, e-cigarette use and smoking status were
gathered through a school-based survey conducted in
four purposively selected communities. Schools were
selected to reflect two levels of urbanisation (urban vs.
small town) and two levels of social deprivation (high vs.
medium/low).
The results reported here are based on data collected
between January and March 2015 after the implementa-
tion of the tobacco point of sale ban in large supermarkets
but before its implementation in small shops. Question-
naires were administered to pupils in Secondary 1 through
to Secondary 6 (age range 10.83–18.67 years, mean 14.71
sd 1.65) by teachers during class time under examination
conditions. Information regarding the survey was sent out
to parents two weeks prior to the survey date. Parents
could withdraw their child from the survey by returning
the opt-out form to the school. Young people could de-
cline to take part in the survey or withdraw from the

ing the consent procedures, was obtained from the Uni-

Analysis approach
This study aimed to examine the relationship between e-
cigarette point of sale recall (in large supermarkets and
small shops) and e-cigarette use. Previous e-cigarette use
and intention to use e-cigarettes in the next 6 months
were the dependent variables. E-cigarette POS recall in
large supermarkets and small shops were the explana-
tory variables. Recall of other sources of e-cigarette ad-
vertisement was included in the adjusted models to
control for the potentially confounding effects of expos-
ure to other types of e-cigarette advertisement. In
addition, demographic factors such as age, sex, and fam-
ily affluence were included as control variables. Tobacco
smoking is known to be a predisposing factor to e-
cigarette use therefore previous tobacco use was also in-
cluded in the adjusted models as a control variable in
order to test whether e-cigarette POS sale influenced e-
cigarette uptake in never smokers (never tried tobacco
cigarettes).
Demographic variables
Respondents were asked their gender, ethnic group, and
date of birth. Ethnic group was dichotomised to white
ethnic group versus other responses. Individual family
material well-being was assessed through the Family Af-
fluence Scale (FAS) [24] which is a validated measure
consisting of six questions (own bedroom, number of
family cars, number of computers, number of family hol-
idays abroad per year, owning a dishwasher and number
of bathrooms). The FAS raw scores were transformed
though categorical principal component analysis into
single dimensional scores that were then divided into
tertiles of high, medium, and low FAS scores. This asset
based measure of family affluence has been shown to be
strongly related to household income (eta squared
around 0.30 in most countries [25]).
E-cigarette use
Respondents were asked whether they had heard of e-
cigarettes and could respond ‘yes’
, ‘no’
, or ‘don’t know’.
Respondents who answered ‘yes’ were directed to the
question ‘which ONE of the following is closest to de-
scribing your experience of e-cigarettes?’
, to which they
could respond ‘I have never used them’
, ‘I have tried
them once or twice’
, ‘I use them sometimes (more than
once a month)’
, or ‘I use them often (more than once a
week)’. This variable was dichotomised to ‘ever tried-1’
versus ‘never tried-0’. The next question was ‘Do you
think that you will try e-cigarettes in the next 6 months?’
to which they could reply ‘yes I do’
, ‘no I don’t’ or ‘don’t
know’. This response was also dichotomised to ‘yes’ -1
versus ‘no’ or ‘don’t know’-0. In the original coding of
the e-cigarette variables participants who responded that
they did not know what an e-cigarette was or missed this
question were coded as ‘missing’ on all other e-cigarette
questions.
Another
alternative
coding
method
was
employed to minimise missing data where participants
who did not know what an e-cigarette was, were as-
sumed not to have tried one and not to intend to try
one. Results are presented for both versions of the e-
cigarette dependent variables.
Cigarette smoking
Ever smoking was assessed with the question: ‘Have you
ever smoked cigarettes, even if it is just one puff?’ to
which they could respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Negative re-
sponses were used as our variable for ‘never smoked’.
To assess intention to smoke respondents were asked
‘Do you think you will smoke a cigarette or hand-rolled
cigarettes (roll-ups) at any time during the next year?’
To which they could answer ‘definitely yes’ ‘probably
yes’ ‘probably not’ ‘definitely not’. This was dichotomised
to ‘yes’-1 or ‘no’-0.
Advertising
Respondents were asked ‘During the past 30 days, have
you noticed any adverts (e.g., shops, shopping centres,
TV, radio, billboards, newspapers, magazines, etc.) for
(a) cigarettes or hand rolled cigarettes (roll-ups), or (b)
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)?’ To which respon-
dents could answer ‘Yes’
, ‘no’ or ‘don’t know’. This re-
sponse was also dichotomised to ‘yes’-1 versus ‘no’ or
‘don’t know’-0.
Internet advertising
Respondents were asked ‘When you are using the inter-
net, how often do you see adverts for (a) tobacco prod-
ucts or pictures of people smoking, or (b) electronic
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or people smoking them?’ To
this pupils could respond ‘I don’t use the internet’
, ‘most
of the time’
, ‘some of the time’
, ‘hardly ever’
, ‘never’. Re-
sponses of ‘I don’t use the internet’ were recoded as
‘never’. All responses were dichotomised to ‘never’ -0
versus other responses-1.
Recall point of sale displays in supermarkets and shops
Respondents were asked whether in the past 30 days,
when they had been in (a) large supermarkets and (b)
small shops, they could remember seeing (i) cigarette or
tobacco packs or (ii) electronic cigarettes displayed for
sale. To this they could respond ‘yes’
, ‘no’ or ‘don’t know’.
This response was also dichotomised to ‘yes’ -1 versus
‘no’ or ‘don’t know’-0.

 Analysis
Data analysis and imputation was conducted in Stata ver-
sion 14. Analysis was by logistic regression with standard
errors adjusted for clustering by school. Where the preva-
lence of the outcome was low (i.e., near to 10 % for
dependent variable ‘intention to try e-cigarettes' -Table 3
and dependent variable intention to try cigarettes-Table 4),
the alpha value was adjusted to 0.01 [26] and therefore the
99 % confidence interval for the odds ratio is presented.
Interactions between demographic variables and other
predictors were explored for all models and interaction
terms retained in the models only if the interaction term
was significant.
To test how robust the results were across different
methods of handling missing data, we used multiple im-
putation by chained equations to fully impute the dataset.
Multiple imputation by chained equations is an iterative
process that imputes multiple variables using a series of
univariate chained equations with fully conditional specifi-
cation of prediction equations. It is based on Monte Carlo
simulation techniques for sampling from complicated
multivariate distributions. Auxiliary variables were in-
cluded in the imputation model: whether parents were
employed, receipt of free school meals and area level
deprivation. A uniform prior distribution was assumed. A
burn in of 10 iterations was employed and this was con-
firmed to lead to convergence through examination of
trace plots. Twenty imputations were initially performed
and adding additional imputations up to a total of 100 did
not significantly change the parameter estimates.
Results
The response rate to the survey was 87 % and a total sam-
ple of 3808 pupils was achieved. Table 1 shows the fre-
quencies for the demographic and outcome variables. In
this sample, 19.8 % of respondents reported having ever
smoked. This included 4 % (148/3725) who were current
smokers. Amongst young people who had ever tried smok-
ing, 60.0 % (437/728) indicated that they had also tried an
e-cigarette, while 29.9 % (215/718) said they intended try-
ing one in the next 6 months. Amongst never smokers,
only 8.6 % (252/2942) had ever tried an e-cigarette, while
2.7% (78/2896) intended to try one in the next 6 months.
Recall of e-cigarette POS displays and previous use of
e-cigarettes
In the unadjusted model, in which the predictor variables
were individually regressed on e-cigarette experience, all
types of e-cigarette advert recall were significantly associ-
ated with having tried an e-cigarette (Table 2 unadjusted
model). In other words, recalling any type of e-cigarette
advert or display was associated with an increase in odds
of having tried an e-cigarette. In the adjusted model 1
(Table 2) when smoking experience, all types of e-
cigarette advert recall and demographic variables were
included in the model, only recall of e-cigarette POS
displays in small shops and online remained significant
predictors of previous e-cigarette use. That is, recall of e-
cigarette POS in small shops was independently associated
with e-cigarette ever use when recall of other types of e-
cigarette advertising was controlled. Recall of other types of
e-cigarette advert (e.g., in print media, TV or billboards)
was not associated with previous e-cigarette use in the
adjusted model. As anticipated, having never smoked to-
bacco was a significant protective factor against having tried
e-cigarettes. Young people who had never smoked tobacco
were much less likely to have tried e-cigarettes than those
who had tried tobacco. In addition, older respondents were
more likely to have tried e-cigarettes than younger ones.
The consistency of these results across alternative
methods of handling missing data in the dependent vari-
able were explored. The adjusted model 2 in Table 2 shows
the effect of recoding the dependent variable so that young
people who have not heard of e-cigarettes are assumed not
to have used them. The adjusted model 3 shows the effect
of using multiple imputation to fully impute the dataset.
Neither of these alternative methods alter the results.
Recall of e-cigarette POS displays and intention to use
e-cigarettes
When the various sources of e-cigarette promotion were
individually regressed on intention to try e-cigarettes,
they were all found to be significant predictors of

 intention to try e-cigarettes (Table 3 unadjusted model).
In other words, recall of e-cigarette POS in small shops
and supermarkets, recall of e-cigarette adverts online,
and recall of other types of e-cigarette adverts all signifi-
cantly increased the odds of intending to use e-cigarettes
in the next 6 months. In the adjusted model 1 where all
sources of e-cigarettes, previous smoking experience,
previous e-cigarette use and demographic variables were
included in the model, recall of e-cigarette POS in small
shops and supermarkets both remained significant inde-
pendent predictors of intention to try e-cigarettes.
Never having smoked tobacco was a protective factor,
with those who had never smoked tobacco being less
likely to intend to try e-cigarettes. As might be expected,
young people who had tried e-cigarettes in the past were
more likely to intend to use them again. Young people
who were older and from more affluent families were
more likely to intend to try e-cigarettes when all the
other variables are included in the model.
Alternative methods of handling missing data were ex-
plored in adjusted models 2 and 3 in Table 3 and neither
changed the results of the analysis.

 Comparison with intention to smoke cigarettes
The analysis was then conducted with intention to
smoke cigarettes as the dependent variable and exposure
to tobacco POS as the explanatory variable. This was
done in order to compare the magnitudes of the odds
ratios with the e-cigarette analyses above.
As shown in Table 4 the different sources of cigarette
brand exposure were individually regressed on ‘intention
to try cigarettes’. In the unadjusted model recall of ciga-
rettes in small shops and in supermarkets and recall of
cigarette adverts on the internet predicted intention to
use cigarettes in the next year.
In the adjusted model 1, recall of seeing cigarettes
in small shops and on the internet both predicted
intention to use cigarettes in the next year. The odds
ratios are in the same order of magnitude as those for
the previous analyses with e-cigarettes. Never having
previously smoked tobacco was a protective factor
with those who had never smoked less likely to intend
to do so in the future. Having tried e-cigarettes was
also associated with intention to smoke tobacco in
the next year.
Alternative methods of handling missing data were
explored in adjusted models 2 and 3 in Table 4. In the
case of intention to smoke recoding the e-cigarette vari-
able and imputation both altered the results making the
effect of internet cigarette adverts not statistically sig-
nificant and high family affluence and age significant.
This makes the outcome of the analysis more similar to
that for intention to use e-cigarettes. The effect of recall
of tobacco in small shops on intention to smoke re-
mains significant in all the alternative treatments of the
missing data.
Discussion
This is the first study to look at e-cigarette POS recall
and e-cigarette use and intention to use amongst adoles-
cents. Our results show that there is an association be-
tween e-cigarette use by adolescents and awareness of
POS displays of e-cigarettes. Adolescents who recalled
seeing e-cigarettes in small shops were more likely to
have tried an e-cigarette and adolescents who recalled
seeing e-cigarettes in small shops and supermarkets were
more likely to intend to try them in the next 6 months.
The effect of POS displays on e-cigarette experience is
small relative to the effect of previous cigarette smoking.
That is, much more of the variance in the probability of
intending to try an e-cigarette is explained by whether
or not the young person had ever smoked cigarettes
than by whether they recalled e-cigarette POS displays.
However, the magnitude of the effect of POS recall on
intention to try e-cigarettes is comparable to that of to-
bacco POS displays on intention to smoke cigarettes.
There are many studies showing that exposure to to-
bacco POS displays influences susceptibility to smoking
and/or smoking initiation [8, 10, 27] and these findings
have been supported by studies illustrating the revers-
ibility of these effects [12]. This comparison suggests
that although the effect size is small, interventions that
reduce exposure to e-cigarette displays may have a
measurable effect on susceptibility to e-cigarette use and
initiation at the population level.
This study found that recall of e-cigarette adverts from
other sources (print media, billboards and TV) was not
a significant predictor of previous e-cigarette use or
intention to use in the adjusted models. This indicates
that once recall of point of sale and internet e-cigarette

 adverts is included in the models, recalling seeing ad-
verts in billboards, newspapers or magazines or on TV
does not account for any additional variance in uptake
of e-cigarettes by adolescents. Recall of e-cigarettes in
small shops and supermarkets contributes independently
to the prediction of intention to use e-cigarettes. Recall
of e-cigarette displays in small shops and on the internet
is associated with previous e-cigarette use. Thus, e-
cigarette advertising may be influencing adolescents
from two sources – the physical spaces in which they
live their lives and their online experience.
Small shops may be important as a source of e-cigarette
point of sale exposure because they are frequently visited
by young people. They also represent part of young peo-
ple’s formative environment. Display of e-cigarettes in
local small shops may indicate normality and social ac-
ceptability to young people [28]. The presence of e-
cigarettes in small shops also indicates accessibility which
has been shown to influence intention to smoke [29].
The other key source of e-cigarettes advert exposure is
the internet. A recent report on children’s use of online
technologies in Europe highlights ‘how embedded the
internet has become in young people’s lives’ and that
‘most young people find the internet to be a necessity
for life in modern society’ ([30], p.28). In the US, the
Pew research group found ‘92 % of teens report going
online daily including 24 % who say they go online
“almost constantly”’ ([31], p.16). It is, therefore, unsur-
prising that internet sources influence teenagers.
Limitations
The data, in this study, are cross-sectional so no firm
conclusions can be drawn regarding causality. Therefore,
we do not know whether young people plan to try e-
cigarettes because they have noticed e-cigarette displays
in shops or on the internet, or whether they notice e-
cigarette displays because they are favourably disposed
towards trying e-cigarettes. However, even if e-cigarette
experimentation makes users more likely to notice dis-
plays, seeing displays in the local environment may well
further reinforce that inclination [8]. Furthermore, longi-
tudinal studies of traditional tobacco cigarette use have
shown that exposure to point of sale displays leads to
changes in smoking susceptibility [9]. Longitudinal data
for e-cigarettes will be available from the DISPLAY study
[23] over the next three years. In this future analysis,
having three different measures of e-cigarette advertising
recall in the same model means that covariance attribut-
able to a predisposition to notice e-cigarette adverts is
controlled in the adjusted models.
Another limitation is that the sample is not represen-
tative of the population of Scotland, as a fully rando-
mised sampling process was not employed and there
was
13
%
non-response
to
the
survey.
However,
demographic variables have been included in the ad-
justed models to control for these factors.
Implications for e-cigarette POS display
This is the first study to suggest that there is an associ-
ation between young people’s exposure to and recall of
POS displays for e-cigarettes and their stated intentions
to use e-cigarettes. Longitudinal data, which will be pro-
vided by this study in the future, will allow us to estab-
lish whether this relationship is causal. The possibility
that e-cigarette POS displays may be linked to likelihood
of uptake by young people is of concern, given that
forthcoming EU legislation will state that e-cigarettes
should be an adult-only product. There is some evi-
dence, from animal models, that nicotine has long term
effects on the adolescent brain including permanent
changes to connectivity and neurotransmitter receptivity
in neural reward-systems. These are the brain circuits
associated with addictive behaviours [32, 33]. Therefore
young people’s exposure to e-cigarettes at POS should
be critically examined and potentially reduced. At the
same time, however, e-cigarettes have potential positive
health benefits for adult smokers [34] and some organi-
sations have called for them to be displayed and pro-
moted prominently at POS for this reason [35]. This
raises an interesting policy dilemma, which can only be
resolved by weighing up the relative benefits and costs
of different options for the regulation of e-cigarette pro-
motions, including banning POS. To a certain extent the
resolution of the policy implications of our findings
must await further evidence regarding the long term
consequences of e-cigarette use and dual use in young
people. As is the case for tobacco, the health conse-
quences of e-cigarette use may only be fully apparent
from long term longitudinal analysis [36]. The policy im-
plications will also depend on how the e-cigarette mar-
ket matures. If regular use of e-cigarettes among young
people stabilises at its current levels (<5 %) and no long
term adverse consequences emerge then it may be un-
necessary to regulate e-cigarette point of sale. In the event
that there is a continuing upward trend in regular e-
cigarette use among young people and there is evidence of
young people transitioning to tobacco smoking or other
adverse health consequences from e-cigarettes then the
information presented here on the relative importance of
POS and other sources of e-cigarette advertisement will
be important in influencing policy development.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that young people’s recall of e-
cigarettes POS displays in small shops is associated with
use of, and intention to use, e-cigarettes. Further re-
search is required on how to balance the promotion of
e-cigarettes as a cessation aid while preventing the
