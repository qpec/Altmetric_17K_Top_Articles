Future life expectancy in 35 industrialised countries: 
projections with a Bayesian model ensemble
Vasilis Kontis*, James E Bennett*, Colin D Mathers, Guangquan Li, Kyle Foreman, Majid Ezzati
Summary
Background Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to plan for health and social services and 
pensions. Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life expectancy using an approach that takes 
into account the uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model.
Methods We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which probabilistically contributed towards the 
final projections. We applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030 in 35 industrialised countries with 
high-quality vital statistics data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy at birth and at age 
65 years, and probability of dying before age 70 years, with life table methods.
Findings Life expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a probability of at least 65% for women and 
85% for men. There is a 90% probability that life expectancy at birth among South Korean women in 2030 will be 
higher than 86·7 years, the same as the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57% probability that it will 
be higher than 90 years. Projected female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in France, Spain, and 
Japan. There is a greater than 95% probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South Korea, Australia, and 
Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030, and a greater than 27% probability that it will surpass 85 years. Of the 
countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life 
expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 
in every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, 
and in Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar gains. More than half of the projected gains in 
life expectancy at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65 years.
Interpretation There is more than a 50% probability that by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 
90 year barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century. Our projections show 
continued increases in longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and social services and pensions.

Introduction
In high-income countries, except in periods of war, 
famine, and infection outbreaks, national life expectancy 
has increased steadily for decades, although there has 
been stagnation or decline in poor and marginalised 
groups.1–3 At the same time, due to variations in the pace 
of increase, the country with the highest (frontier) life 
expectancy has changed several times.3
Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are 
needed to plan for health and social services and 
pensions. Most current mortality and life expectancy 
projections rely on a single model, selected based on 
either theoretical considerations or a comparison of a 
few models.4 Due to differences in methodology, such 
projections vary across studies. For example, some 
researchers have projected a continued rise in life 
expectancy in high-income countries.3,5 Others have 
argued that obesity and other risks to health will 
imminently (ie, within the first half of the 21st century) 
halt or reverse the rise in life expectancy.6 This 
discrepancy indicates that there is uncertainty about 
model choice, which is not taken into account when a 
single model is used.
We applied a probabilistic Bayesian model averaging 
(BMA) approach to mortality and life expectancy 
projection.7 The BMA approach, which is increasingly 
common in areas of science such as weather and climate 
forecasting, uses an ensemble of models, all of which 
probabilistically contribute towards the final projections.
Methods
Countries analysed
Our analysis covered high-income countries in Asia 
and the Pacific, North America, central Europe and 
western Europe, as well as Latin American countries 
that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), with data available 
on deaths and population from 1985 to 2010 or later, 
and a population of 1 million or more over the entire 
period. Having data from at least 1985 provided a 
sufficient number of years to estimate parameters and 
weights for the models as described below. The table

lists the countries together with details about data 
availability.
Data sources
We obtained data on population and deaths from WHO. 
We obtained data for a single year (2014) for South Korea 
from the South Korean Statistical Information Service 
(KOSIS) because the latest year reported to WHO was 
2013 at the time of analysis. All countries had data from 
1985 onwards; 24 countries had data from 1960 onwards 
and were used for testing the performance of BMA 
projections. Information about data pre-processing is 
described in the appendix (p 3).
Bayesian model averaging
The probabilistic BMA approach uses an ensemble of 
models, each providing a posterior distribution for life 
expectancy in the future. The posterior distribution of 
the final projections is a probabilistic combination of 
those from individual models.7
We used an ensemble of 21 models for projecting 
age-specific death rates, which were in turn used to 
calculate projected life expectancy. These models, 
described in detail in the appendix (pp 4–6), were 
formulated to incorporate features of death rates in 
relation to age and birth cohort, and over time, as well 
as statistical considerations such as extent of smoothing 
over age and birth cohort, and how much weight to 
give to older data-points compared with more recent 
ones. We determined which models received a greater 
or lesser weight in the final projections based on 
performance in projecting withheld data in the 
following steps.
In step 1, we measured the performance of projections 
from individual models. We held back the last 13 years of 
data for each country (table), and used the remaining 
data to estimate model parameters, which we then used 
to make projections for the withheld years; 13 years is the 
maximum duration that would still allow sufficient data 
to reliably estimate model parameters for countries 
whose data start in 1985. We used bias in life expectancy, 
calculated as described in the appendix (p 7), as the 
metric to measure projection error for reasons described 
in the appendix (p 10). We calculated projection bias as 
the difference between the observed (but withheld) and 
projected life expectancies, averaged over all years of 
withheld data.
In step 2, we calculated model weights such that models 
with smaller bias were assigned larger weights, with the 
weights decaying exponentially as the magnitude of the 
projection bias increased. Each model was assigned a 
weight of exp(–|Projection bias|), where the bias was 
calculated as described in step 1; the 21 weights were 
normalised to sum to 1. The model weights are shown in 
the appendix (pp 16, 17).
In step 3, we calculated the final projections. We used 
all the available data for each country and sex to estimate 
model parameters, which we used to make projections to 
2030. We took a number of draws from the posterior 
distribution of age-specific death rates under each model 
proportional to the weight of that model calculated in 
step 2, and pooled the draws to obtain the posterior 
distribution of age-specific death rates under the BMA, 
which were then used to calculate life expectancy 
projections. The code used for the analysis is available 
online.
We tested the performance of the BMA projections as 
described in the appendix (pp 8, 9), which showed that 
the BMA approach on average had a smaller error than 
the best single models for different sex, country, and 
projection duration combinations (appendix pp 18, 19). 
The relative advantage of the BMA compared with the 
best model increased for longer validation periods. For a 
projection duration of 22 years, the average absolute bias 
of the BMA across countries and years was 0·68 years for 
women and 1·09 years for men; that of the best model 
was 1·00 years for women and 1·39 years for men. The

Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published up to July 21, 2016, 
with no language restrictions, using the search terms 
“forecasting” OR “projection”, “Bayesian”, and “life expectancy” 
in the publication title and abstract. We also used a review of 
forecasting methods to identify previous studies. All identified 
studies had used a single preferred model for projecting 
mortality or life expectancy or both for one or multiple countries.
Added value of this study
In a novel approach, we used an ensemble of models, all of 
which probabilistically contribute toward the final projections, 
with the projections from each model weighted according to 
how well it predicted withheld data for each country and sex. 
This approach not only takes into account the inherent 
uncertainty in the choice of projection model, but also 
outperforms projections from the single-model approach. 
We also decomposed the projected rise in life expectancy into 
gains in younger, middle, and older ages.
Implications of all the available evidence
There is a high probability that life expectancy will continue to 
increase in all industrialised countries, and more than a 
50% chance that by 2030 national female life expectancy in 
South Korea will break the 90 year barrier. Enhanced longevity 
in older ages will be the main contributor to the projected gains 
in life expectancy at birth, especially in women.

Results
Figure 1 shows the projected change in life expectancy at 
birth from 2010 to 2030. Taking model uncertainty into 
account, we project that life expectancy will increase in 
all of these 35 countries with a probability of at least 65% 
for women and 85% for men, although the increase will 
vary 
across 
countries. 
There 
is 
nonetheless 
a 
35% probability that life expectancy will stagnate or 
decrease in Japanese women by 2030, followed by a 
14% probability in Bulgarian men and 11% in Finnish 
women.
Figures 2 and 3 show the distributions of projected 
life expectancy at birth for women and men by country, 
and the distribution of each country’s rank. There is 
90% probability that life expectancy at birth among 
South Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 
86·7 years, the same as the highest life expectancy in 
the world in 2012, and a 57% probability that it will be 
higher than 90 years (figure 2), a level that was 
considered virtually unattainable at the turn of the 
21st century by some researchers.8–10 This achievement 
is a continuation of the massive gains in South Korean 
women’s life expectancy, which has increased by on 
average 3·7 years per decade since 1985, when they 
were ranked 29th, with no indication of slowing 
(appendix pp 20–27). The probability that South Korean 
women will have the highest female life expectancy in 
2030 is 45%, with a 27% probability of being in 
second place.
Female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by 
those in France, Japan, and Spain, the projected 
 
distributions of which have substantial overlap. For 
example, although median projected life expectancy for 
Japan places it in third place in 2030, there is a 
22% probability that Japanese women will continue to 
have the highest female life expectancy in 2030, as they 
have had for decades, and 14% probability of being 
ranked second. Other countries with large projected 
gains in female longevity are emerging economies 
(eg, Slovenia) as well as Portugal and France. Slovenia 
and Portugal have 71% and 63% probabilities, 
respectively, to be in the top ten countries in 2030, a 
substantial improvement to their rankings in the 
1980s.
For men, South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland have 
highly overlapping distributions of projected life 
expectancy and hence similar probabilities of occupying 
the top three ranks (figure 3). There is an at least 
95% probability that men’s life expectancy at birth in 
these three countries will surpass 80 years in 2030, and 
27% that it would surpass 85 years. Like women, men in 
South Korea and a number of central European emerging 
economies like Hungry and Slovenia are projected to 
make large gains, as are men in Denmark, Ireland, and a

few other western European nations. As a result of these 
trends, by 2030, South Korea is likely to take the life 
expectancy frontier position from Japan for women, and 
catch up with the current global frontier country Australia 
for men (figure 4). The USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, 
Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected 
gains for both men and women.
In 2010, women had a higher life expectancy than men 
by 3·9 (New Zealand) to 8·5 (Poland) years (figure 5). We 
project that the female advantage will shrink by 2030 in 
every country analysed here except Mexico, where a 
slightly larger life expectancy gain is projected for women 
than for men, and in Chile, France, and Greece where 
male and female life expectancies will increase by about 
the same.
In 2010, life expectancy at age 65 years was highest in 
Japanese women, at 24·3 years (95% credible interval 
23·6–24·7) followed by French women at 23·0 years 
(22·7–23·2; figure 6). By 2030, 65-year-old women 
in 19 of the countries analysed here are likely 
(probability >50%) to have life expectancies greater than 
23 years; in 11 of these countries life expectancy at age 
65 years is likely to surpass 24 years. Male life expectancy 
at age 65 years is projected to surpass 20 years—a level 
that has not been achieved so far—by 2030 in 22 countries 
with probabilities of over 50%  (figure 7). Further 
reductions are projected in premature mortality, 
measured by the probability of dying before age 70 years 
(appendix, pp 28–30). In women, more than half—and in 
many countries more than two-thirds—of the projected 
gains in life expectancy at birth will be due to enhanced 
longevity above age 65 years (figure 8). A similar pattern 
is also projected among men in Australasia, Asia-Pacific, 
North America, and western Europe. By contrast, the 
projected increase in life expectancy at birth for men in 
central European and Latin American countries will 
benefit more evenly from gains in the middle ages 
(age 30–64 years) and older ages.

Discussion
Using the performance-weighted average of an ensemble 
of 21 models, we project that there is a high probability 
that life expectancy will continue to increase in 
industrialised countries in the Americas, Australasia, 
central Europe, western Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The 
increase in life expectancy will be largest in South Korea, 
some western European countries, and some emerging 
economies, and smallest in the USA, Japan, Sweden, 
Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia. Most of the projected 
gains in life expectancy will occur in older ages, especially 
in women, furthering the ageing trends in the 
industrialised world.
Our projections of life expectancy at birth are broadly 
similar to those made by the UN population division.11 
The largest differences are for women in Singapore, for 
whom our projections are lower than those by the UN, 
and men in Hungary where the reverse occurs. In 2016, 
Parr and colleagues12 projected life expectancy for 
14 countries, with substantially higher projections for 
Japan than ours. The highest projected life expectancy by 
the UN11 (for women in Hong Kong) and Mathers and 
Loncar13 (for women in Japan) is below 90 years; however, 
our study and that of Parr and colleagues12 projected 
frontiers beyond 90 years (for South Korean women in 
our work and Japanese women by Parr and colleagues). 
The projected closing of the female–male gap in life 
expectancy in most countries in our study is consistent 
with historical data, when there was no female advantage.14 
The current gender differences in life expectancy are due 
to differences in deaths from external causes (injuries) 
and from conditions such as lung cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases, whose risk factors (eg, smoking) 
have different trends in men and women.14,15
A key strength of our study is the innovative method 
for combining projections from multiple models to more 
completely capture the uncertainty about future trends in 
mortality and life expectancy. On average, 36% of the 
variance of final projections for women and 41% for men 
were due to between-model variance, indicating that the 
BMA approach is effective in capturing the uncertainty 
in model choice (see appendix p 40 for the proportion in 
each country). In addition, BMA projections had a 
smaller projection error on average than the best model, 
which improved the validity of the projections.
The key limitation of our work, shared by all projections 
of the future, is the inability to account for completely 
unexpected 
events 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
social, 
technological, and health systems determinants of 
health. Alternative futures can be considered by 
envisioning scenarios of such determinants, and 
analysing how the projected death rates would be 
modified in such scenarios, as has been done for 
preventable risk factors.15 The model averaging method is 
inherently reliant on the choice of models included in 
the ensemble. We tested the performance of the BMA 
projections when subgroups of the ensemble of models 
were excluded but found that projection error increased 
as a result of doing so.
We applied the BMA approach to data from 
35 industrialised countries with reliable death registration, 
for which past trends in mortality were measured with 
little error, and could be used to fit the projection models. 
Future work should extend the BMA approach to project 
mortality for all countries, for many of which past 
mortality is itself estimated using demographic and 
statistical models. The simplest option for doing so is to 
treat the model-estimated past trends as actual

measurement, and apply our approach to the resultant 
death rates. A more complete model would incorporate 
the uncertainty of estimated past trends (eg, as 
measurement error), so that this uncertainty can be 
propagated into the projections. Some previous works 
have used macroeconomic factors such as per capita 
national income and risk factors such as smoking in the 
projections model,13 on the premise that such variables 
might improve projections. Although the associations of 
these economic and epidemiological variables with 
mortality can be estimated using historical data, using 
them to project future mortality requires assumptions 
about the futures of these factors themselves, or additional 
models to project them. An alternative approach to using 
risk factor data is to use an epidemiological model to 
estimate how much risk factor scenarios modify baseline 
projections such as those made here.15 Finally, we did not 
project cause-specific mortality. Despite their value for 
public health and health service planning, whether 
calculating all-cause mortality projections directly or as 
the sum of cause-specific projections produces better all-
cause mortality forecasts depends on the quality of cause-
specific predictions and the relationships between the 
causes (eg, whether they change in a correlated manner).
Early life expectancy gains in South Korea, which has 
the highest projected life expectancy, and previous to that 
in Japan, were driven by declines in deaths from 
infections in children and adults; more recent gains have 
been largely due to postponement of death from chronic 
diseases.16,17 These gains were due to broad-based 
inclusive improvements in economic status18 and social 
capital (including education) in both countries,19 which 
improved childhood and adolescent nutrition (eg, as 
seen by South Korea and Japan having achieved some of 
the largest gains in adult height over the past century),20 
expanded access to primary and secondary health care, 
and 
facilitated 
rapid 
scale-up 
of 
new 
medical 
technologies.16 South Korea has also maintained lower 
body-mass index and blood pressure than most western 
countries,21,22 and lower smoking in women. Finally,

South Korea and Japan might have lower health 
inequalities (eg, for cancer and cardiovascular disease 
mortality, and for self-reported health status) than some 
of their western counterparts, especially for women.23–25 
Other countries with high projected life expectancy are 
benefiting from one or more major public health and 
health-care successes. Examples include high-quality 
health care that improves prevention and prognosis of 
cardiovascular diseases and cancers, very low infant 
mortality, low rates of road traffic injuries and smoking 
(eg, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand), and low body-
mass index (eg, French and Swiss women) and blood 
pressure (eg, Canada and Australia).21,22
By contrast, projected life expectancy is lower in 
countries with higher levels of young adult mortality and 
major chronic disease risk factors, and possibly less 
effective health systems. These countries also tend to 
have higher social inequalities, which might lower 
national life expectancy by affecting the entire population 
or through the poor health of the worst-off social groups 
and communities, which in turn affects the national 
average.26,27 Notable among poor-performing countries is 
the USA, whose life expectancy at birth is already lower 
than most other high-income countries, and is projected 
to fall further behind such that its 2030 life expectancy at 
birth might be similar to the Czech Republic for men, 
and Croatia and Mexico for women. The USA has the 
highest child and maternal mortality, homicide rate, and 
body-mass index of any high-income country, and was the 
first of high-income countries to experience a halt or 
possibly reversal of increase in height in adulthood, 
which is associated with higher longevity.20,21,28–30 The USA 
is also the only country in the OECD without universal 
health coverage, and has the largest share of unmet 
health-care needs due to financial costs.25 Not only does 
the USA have high and rising health inequalities, but also 
life expectancy has stagnated or even declined in some 
population subgroups.1,2 Therefore, the poor recent and 
projected US performance is at least partly due to high 
and inequitable mortality from chronic diseases and 
violence, and insufficient and inequitable health care.
With the exception of obesity, effective strategies and 
policies exist to modify the important behavioural and 
health systems determinants of adult mortality.31 The 
cornerstone of these strategies is an equitable and 
effective health system that provides universal free 
access to high-quality primary and secondary care for 
prevention and treatment, and uses regulation and 
economic tools (eg, taxes) for substantially reducing 
tobacco and harmful alcohol use. Our projected 
longevity gains, and the contributions of older age 
longevity to these gains, also have major implications 
for health and social services.5 There is a need for health 
services that provide long-term care for the increasing 
number of older people who are affected by multi-
morbidity and limited mobility.32 The health-care needs 
go beyond simply increasing the number of facilities 
and personnel, itself a challenge in the current era of 
austerity, and should involve considerations about how 
and where care is delivered including more integrated 
care in the community setting or even at home. At the 
same time, healthy ageing through the life course can 
prevent or delay the chronic conditions that affect older 
people; assistive technologies that compensate for loss 
of sensory and motor abilities, and appropriate changes 
to the built environment and transportation services 
can support independent living and mobility.32 
Furthermore, social security and pensions will face 
additional payouts with extended longevity, which will 
further stress them unless work and retirement 
practices change, for example through gradual 
transition to retirement or later retirement age.5 
Although rising life expectancy necessitates policies 
that can support healthy ageing, reframing of 
education–work–retirement practices, and investment 
in health and social care, our projections show the 
continued success of extending longevity.
