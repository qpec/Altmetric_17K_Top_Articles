Foreword
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is committed to providing the Nation with reliable scientific 
information that helps to enhance and protect the overall quality of life and that facilitates effective 
management of water, biological, energy, and mineral resources (http://www.usgs.gov). Information 
on the Nation’s water resources is critical to ensuring long-term availability of water that is safe for 
drinking and recreation and is suitable for industry, irrigation, and fish and wildlife. Population growth and 
increasing demands for water make the availability of that water, now measured in terms of quantity and 
quality, even more essential to the long-term sustainability of our communities and ecosystems.
The USGS implemented the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program in 1991 to support 
national, regional, state, and local information needs and decisions related to water-quality management 
and policy (http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa). The NAWQA Program is designed to answer: What is the 
quality of our Nation’s streams and ground water? How are conditions changing over time? How do 
natural features and human activities affect the quality of streams and ground water, and where are 
those effects most pronounced? By combining information on water chemistry, physical characteristics, 
stream habitat, and aquatic life, the NAWQA Program aims to provide science-based insights for 
current and emerging water issues and priorities. From 1991 to 2001, the NAWQA Program completed 
interdisciplinary assessments and established a baseline understanding of water-quality conditions in 
51 of the Nation’s river basins and aquifers, referred to as Study Units (http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/
studyu.html).
National and regional assessments are ongoing in the second decade (2001–2012) of the NAWQA 
Program as 42 of the 51 Study Units are reassessed. These assessments extend the findings in the Study 
Units by determining status and trends at sites that have been consistently monitored for more than 
a decade, and filling critical gaps in characterizing the quality of surface water and ground water. For 
example, increased emphasis has been placed on assessing the quality of source water and finished 
water associated with many of the Nation’s largest community water systems. During the second decade, 
NAWQA is addressing five national priority topics that build an understanding of how natural features 
and human activities affect water quality, and establish links between sources of contaminants, the 
transport of those contaminants through the hydrologic system, and the potential effects of contaminants 
on humans and aquatic ecosystems. Included are topics on the fate of agricultural chemicals, effects of 
urbanization on stream ecosystems, bioaccumulation of mercury in stream ecosystems, effects of nutrient 
enrichment on aquatic ecosystems, and transport of contaminants to public-supply wells. In addition, 
national syntheses of information on pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nutrients, selected 
trace elements, and aquatic ecology are continuing.
The USGS aims to disseminate credible, timely, and relevant science information to address practical and 
effective water-resource management and strategies that protect and restore water quality. We hope this 
NAWQA publication will provide you with insights and information to meet your needs, and will foster 
increased citizen awareness and involvement in the protection and restoration of our Nation’s waters.
The USGS recognizes that a national assessment by a single program cannot address all water-resource 
issues of interest. External coordination at all levels is critical for cost-effective management, regulation, 
and conservation of our Nation’s water resources. The NAWQA Program, therefore, depends on advice 
and information from other agencies—Federal, state, regional, interstate, Tribal, and local—as well as 
nongovernmental organizations, industry, academia, and other stakeholder groups. Your assistance and 
suggestions are greatly appreciated.

 Abstract
The National Water-Quality Assessment Program of 
the U.S. Geological Survey has groundwater studies that 
focus on water-quality conditions in principal aquifers of the 
United States. The Program specifically focuses on aquifers 
that are important to public supply, domestic, and other major 
uses. Estimates for self-supplied domestic withdrawals and 
the population served for 20 aquifers in the United States 
for calendar year 2005 are provided in this report. These 
estimates are based on county-level data for self-supplied 
domestic groundwater withdrawals and the population served 
by those withdrawals, as compiled by the National Water Use 
Information Program, for areas within the extent of the 20 
aquifers. In 2005, the total groundwater withdrawals for self-
supplied domestic use from the 20 aquifers represented about 
63 percent of the total self-supplied domestic groundwater 
withdrawals in the United States; the population served by the 
withdrawals represented about 61 percent of the total self-
supplied domestic population in the United States. 
Introduction
The National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) 
Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) focuses its 
groundwater studies on water-quality conditions, including 
status and trends in principal aquifers of the United States, 
and specifically those aquifers important to public supply 
and domestic uses (Lapham and others, 2005; National 
Water-Quality Assessment Program, 2010) (fig. 1). NAWQA 
studies need accurate, current data about the amount of water 
withdrawn from these aquifers and the size of the Nation’s 
population that relies on them. 
The USGS Office of Groundwater identified more 
than 60 principal regional aquifers in the United States 
(U.S. Geological Survey, 2003), some of which are major 
sources of water for drinking-water supplies. Estimates of 
groundwater withdrawals for three major water uses (public 
supply, self-supplied industrial, and irrigation) were compiled 
for each of these principal aquifers using 2000 data (Maupin 
and Barber, 2005); however, groundwater withdrawal data 
for the population served by those withdrawals do not exist 
for self-supplied domestic use by principal aquifer. Self-
supplied domestic withdrawals are derived from private 
wells for domestic indoor and outdoor use, as compared to 
public-supply withdrawals, which are derived from public 
water systems and are used for public, domestic (homes on 
public-supply systems), commercial, and industrial purposes. 
This study used 2005 county-level self-supplied domestic 
groundwater withdrawals and the population served by those 
withdrawals from the USGS National Water Use Information 
Program (NWUIP) as the source data to allocate withdrawals 
and population served to 20 selected principal aquifers (fig. 1). 
Some of the principal aquifers were combined for this study; 
for example, the sand and gravel aquifers north of the limit 
of Quaternary continental glaciations and east of the Rocky 
Mountains (hereinafter referred to as Glacial aquifer system) 
also include aquifers denoted as ‘Unconsolidated-deposit 
aquifers (Alaska)’ and ‘Puget Sound aquifer system’ as shown 
in the National Atlas (U.S. Geological Survey, 2003). 
Groundwater is the primary source of water for self-
supplied domestic use. In 2005, groundwater withdrawals 
for self-supplied domestic use in the United States were an 
estimated 3,740 Mgal/d (million gallons per day) (Kenny 
and others, 2009), which comprised 98 percent of the total 
self-supplied domestic withdrawals in the Nation (2 percent of 
withdrawals were from surface-water sources). An estimated 
42.9 million people in the United States, or 14 percent of the 
total population, supplied themselves with water obtained 
from private wells. 
Purpose and Scope
This report summarizes estimates of groundwater 
withdrawals for self-supplied domestic use and the population 
served by those withdrawals from 20 aquifers in the United 
States during calendar year 2005 (fig. 1). This report also 
explains the different sources of data and the methods 
that were used to derive the groundwater withdrawals and 
population served. These data were compiled as part of 
the NAWQA principal aquifers studies using data from

the NWUIP’s 5-year county dataset for 2005, or other data 
provided by water-use specialists in USGS Water Science 
Centers. Data were compiled for 20 aquifers or aquifer groups 
(some principal aquifers were combined), which represents 
a subset of the more than 60 principal aquifers as shown on 
the USGS principal aquifer map of the National Atlas of 
the United States (U.S. Geological Survey, 2003). The data 
represent groundwater withdrawals for calendar year 2005 in 
Mgal/d, and population served, in thousands of people.
Sources of Data and Methods
County groundwater data are compiled by each USGS 
Water Science Center (WSC) every 5 years as part of the 
NWUIP. The most recent compilation at the time this 
study was conducted was for calendar year 2005. Data for 
counties within the areal extent of the selected aquifers were 
compiled to create the initial dataset of self-supplied domestic 
groundwater withdrawals and the population served by 
those withdrawals (http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/data/2005/
index.html). Water-use specialists in a few WSCs provided 
domestic withdrawals and population data by principal 
aquifer for the states in which they are located. Withdrawals 
and the population served by those withdrawals, by aquifer, 
were supplied for Florida, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Vermont, 
Virginia, and Wisconsin; only withdrawals were provided for 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, 
Tennessee, and West Virginia. Withdrawal and population 
served data for all other states that did not provide data were 
allocated to the 20 aquifers either using USGS database 
information regarding the number of domestic wells and 
aquifer sources in each county, or using maps showing the 
areal extent of the aquifers. 
Data provided directly from WSCs were initially 
compiled by WSC water-use specialists using methods and 
techniques that followed guidelines for the 2005 national 
water-use compilation (Hutson, 2007). Groundwater 
withdrawals and population data were allocated to the 
20 aquifers either as part of the 2005 compilation (Marella, 
2009; Tortorelli, 2009), or using methods developed from 
other studies that focused on similar goals (Pope and others, 
2008). All data were checked for consistency and accuracy by 
WSC water-use specialists.
If withdrawal and population served data were not 
provided by a WSC, it was interpolated using USGS databases 
and geographic analysis of the areal extent of the 20 aquifers. 
Each WSC maintains well information in a database system 
common to all USGS offices in the United States, the National 
Water Information System (NWIS). NWIS stores information 
about wells used for many purposes, but this study specifically 
focused on domestic wells. Well information in NWIS 
includes location, depth of well, water use and water levels, 
and some aquifer information. A retrieval of all domestic 
wells in NWIS databases for 48 States (excluding Alaska and 
Hawaii; also excluding the Territories of Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia) was conducted in 
April 2009. Specific information about aquifers was queried 
to determine which aquifers were supplying water to domestic 
wells. In total, there were more than 443,300 domestic wells 
in NWIS databases in the lower 48 States. About 65 percent 
of the total domestic wells (almost 291,000) had information 
that identified a principal aquifer. These data were used to 
construct a county database with the percentage of wells in 
each county that withdraw water from 1 of the 20 aquifers. 
The percentage of wells in each county that withdraw water 
from any of the 20 aquifers was used to allocate withdrawals 
and population served to those aquifers. 
NWIS databases are not an entirely complete or current 
inventory of all domestic wells in each state. The databases 
store a compilation of wells that were inventoried as part 
of projects and studies conducted in each state over time. 
For example, if groundwater studies in a state focused more 
intensely on one particular aquifer than another, or on wells 
in one particular part of a state rather than across all areas, the 
database will reflect a bias and cannot be expected to reflect a 
completely accurate representation of all aquifers or all areas 
of a state. However, lacking any other nationally consistent 
and readily available sources, the NWIS databases were the 
best source of information for this study and in many cases, 
the aquifers or areas of a state that are the focus of studies also 
are the important sources of drinking water.
A few states did not have domestic well information in 
NWIS and thus aquifer information regarding which aquifer 
to allocate withdrawal and population served data was not 
readily available. This lack of available information does 
not mean that these counties do not have domestic wells, 
but does indicate where NWIS had deficient information 
that would otherwise have been used in this study. Counties 
lacking domestic well information in NWIS at the time 
of the retrievals (April 2009) are shown in figure 2. If a 
county did not have domestic well information in NWIS, 
then the domestic withdrawals and population served for 
that county were allocated to any of the 20 aquifers based 
on the percentage of the county’s geographic area that was 
coincident with the geographic area of the aquifer. A simple 
area-weighted allocation was used to calculate withdrawals 
and population served in those areas based on the percentage 
of area and the county data from NWUIP. 
Results
Total self-supplied domestic withdrawals and population 
served for the 20 aquifers are summarized in tables 1–3. 
The 20 aquifers represent about 63 percent of the total self-
supplied domestic groundwater withdrawals and about 61 
percent of the total population served by those withdrawals in 
the United States for calendar year 2005. The Glacial aquifer 
system (table 1) had the largest withdrawals and supplied the

most people among all the 20 aquifers. The Glacial aquifer 
system also supplied the most water to public-supply systems 
in 2000 (Maupin and Barber, 2005). The four aquifers with 
the largest withdrawals and the largest population served 
were the Glacial aquifer system, Piedmont and Blue Ridge 
crystalline and carbonate-rock aquifers, the Floridan aquifer 
system and the overlying Surficial aquifer system, and the 
Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifer system. Combined, 
these four aquifers accounted for more than 60 percent of 
the total self-supplied withdrawals and about 66 percent of 
the total population served from all 20 aquifers. The daily 
per-capita use rate, in gallons per-capita per day (gpcd) is 
shown in table 1. These values range from about 312 gpcd 
for the Central Valley aquifer system, to about 59 gpcd for 
the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system. Generally, the daily 
per-capita use rate varies in accordance with general climatic 
regions. Dry and hot regions, such as the Southwest, generally 
exhibit higher per-capita use rates than cooler, wet regions. 
Data for self-supplied domestic withdrawals and 
population served for the 20 aquifers, by state, are shown 
in tables 2 and 3, respectively. Three aquifers in four 
states accounted for the largest withdrawals (greater than 
100 Mgal/d)—the Glacial aquifer system in Michigan 
(184 Mgal/d) and Indiana (124 Mgal/d), the Floridan aquifer 
system combined with the overlaying Surficial aquifer system 
in Florida (168 Mgal/d), and the Central Valley aquifer system 
in California (136 Mgal/d) (table 2). More than 1 million 
people in Florida, Michigan, and Indiana used groundwater 
from the Floridan and overlying Surficial aquifer systems,  
or the Glacial aquifer system, respectively (table 3). 
Total withdrawals and total population served, by state for 
the 20 aquifers, are shown in tables 2 and 3, along with the 
state total withdrawals and population served from the 2005 
compilation (Kenny and others, 2009). These data provide 
a reference point from which to determine the percentage of 
the entire state’s self-supplied domestic use and population 
served that is accounted for by the 20 aquifers. Self-supplied 
domestic withdrawals and population served in six states are 
completely provided by four aquifers as follows: Hawaii is 
supplied entirely by the Hawaiian volcanic-rock aquifers, 
Indiana is supplied entirely by the Glacial aquifer system, and 
Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont each are 
entirely supplied by the Glacial aquifer system and the New 
England crystalline-rock aquifers.

 10  Estimates for Domestic Withdrawals and Population Served for Selected Principal Aquifers, 2005
Summary
This report represents the most recent assessment of 
estimated self-supplied domestic withdrawals and population 
served for 20 aquifers in the United States. These data 
were compiled to support regional National Water-Quality 
Assessment Program studies, which focuses on groundwater 
quality of principal aquifers in the U.S., which are important 
sources of water to both public supply and private domestic 
uses. Estimated groundwater withdrawals for public-supply, 
self-supplied industrial, and irrigation uses from more than 
60 principal aquifers were compiled using 2000 data, but 
estimates for aquifer withdrawal or populations served 
are not available for the self-supplied domestic uses. This 
report summarizes the most currently available (calendar 
year 2005) water-use estimates from the National Water Use 
Information Program for self-supplied domestic groundwater 
withdrawals and population served allocated to 20 aquifers. 
Estimates of withdrawals from the 20 aquifers were provided 
by USGS water-use specialists, or were determined using well 
information available in USGS databases, or geographic area-
weighted processes. 
The 20 aquifers represent about 63 percent of the total 
self-supplied domestic groundwater withdrawals, and about 
61  percent of the total population served by those withdrawals 
in the United States for calendar year 2005. The Glacial 
aquifer system had the largest withdrawals and supplied the 
most people among all the aquifers. The four aquifers with the 
largest withdrawals and the largest population served were the 
Glacial aquifer system, Piedmont and Blue Ridge crystalline 
and carbonate-rock aquifers, the Floridan aquifer system 
and the overlying Surficial aquifer system, and the Northern 
Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifer system. Combined, these four 
aquifers accounted for more than 60 percent of the total 
self-supplied domestic withdrawals, and about 66 percent of 
the total population served by those withdrawals from the 20 
aquifers. Three aquifers in four States accounted for the largest 
withdrawals (greater than 100 Mgal/d)—the Glacial aquifer 
system in Michigan (184 Mgal/d) and Indiana (124 Mgal/d), 
the Floridan aquifer system combined with the overlaying 
Surficial aquifer system in Florida (168 Mgal/d), and the 
Central Valley aquifer system in California (136 Mgal/d). 
More than 1 million people in Florida, Indiana, and Michigan 
used groundwater from the Floridan and the overlying 
Surficial aquifer systems or the Glacial aquifer system. All 
withdrawals and population served in six states are supplied 
by four aquifers as follows: Hawaii is supplied entirely by the 
Hawaiian volcanic-rock aquifers, Indiana is supplied entirely 
by the Glacial aquifer system, and Maine, New Hampshire, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont each are supplied entirely by the 
Glacial aquifer system and the New England crystalline-rock 
aquifers.
