Abstract
PURPOSE—To evaluate the efficacy of a dexamethasone intravitreal implant in combination 
with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for treatment resistant neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (nvAMD).
METHODS—This study was designed as a single-center, retrospective interventional case series. 
Consecutive patients with treatment-resistant nvAMD underwent simultaneous combined injection 
of anti-VEGF agent and dexamethasone intravitreal implant. Eighteen patients with mean age of 
81.5 years were included. Patients received average of 26.3 anti-VEGF injections before dual 
therapy, with mean follow up of 8.2 months after dual therapy.
RESULTS—Dual therapy produced a significant mean decrease in CFT (126.3 μm), compared to 
a mean increase of 29.9 μm when treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy (p=0.0017). Patients also 
had mean decrease in MCV of −0.85 mm3 with dual therapy compared with anti-VEGF 
monotherapy (p=0.0014). There was a moderate correlation between the number of prior anti-
VEGF injections and the magnitude of anatomic response, suggesting that shorter disease duration 
may positively influence response to combined treatment. Although there was a slight trend 
towards improved mean visual acuity after dual therapy, these differences did not reach statistical 
significance. Nevertheless, with combination treatment, 33% of patients gained one or more lines 
of vision. Dual therapy resulted in a significantly lower number of required anti-VEGF injections

 (4.25 vs 5.33) and an increase of the anti-VEGF injection-free interval to 1.41 months from 1.12 
months during the 6 months following dual therapy compared to the same interval before dual 
therapy. Dual therapy was well tolerated; two eyes developed mild IOP elevation effectively 
managed with topical therapy and one patient developed worsening cataract.
CONCLUSIONS—Combined treatment of anti-VEGF with the dexamethasone intravitreal 
implant is a viable alternative for treatment-resistant nvAMD, and may reduce treatment burden. 
Earlier treatment with dual therapy may be beneficial to maximize anatomic and visual outcomes 
in these patients.

Introduction
Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 50 
or older in the United States.1-3 Neovascular AMD (nvAMD) accounts for the majority of 
the visual impairment in these patients.4 Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the 
hallmark of nvAMD, and results in well-described leakage, exudation and hemorrhage in the 
macula which can produce rapid vision loss.5 The role of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) in CNV formation and maintenance is well established,6,7 and intravitreal anti-
VEGF agents have become the first line treatment and standard of care for nvAMD over the 
past decade.8-10 Three agents, bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA), 
ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) and aflibercept (Eylea / VEGF 
Trap-Eye, Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY, USA) are in clinical use today. Despite the efficacy of 
anti-VEGF therapy, a subset of patients do not optimally respond and have persistent 
subretinal or intraretinal fluid with vision loss despite anti-VEGF monotherapy.11-13 
Treatment of these patients is challenging and may include any combination of switching 
among anti-VEGF agents,14-16 use of photodynamic therapy (PDT)17 or use of intravitreal 
corticosteroids.18,19
Corticosteroids are an attractive adjuvant for treatment resistant nvAMD because they 
address the inflammatory component of CNV membrane formation and growth that is not 
targeted by anti-VEGF agents. Multiple studies have shown that inflammatory elements, 
including macrophages, play an important role in AMD progression.20-22 Steroids stabilize 
vascular tight junctions and decrease leakage,23 produce apoptosis of peripheral T-cells24 
and eosinophils,25 and may block fibroblast activation and proliferation.26 In addition, 
glucocorticoids have been shown to directly inhibit VEGF production.27 Dexamethasone is a 
potent steroid, but its clinical usefulness is limited by its rapid clearance from the vitreous 
cavity (i.e. three half-lives of <12 hours).28 The dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7 mg 
Ozurdex®, Allergan, Parsippany, NJ) allows steady dexamethasone delivery in the vitreous 
cavity over a period of up to 6 months via a sustained release injectable biopolymer with 
dexamethasone integrated with polylacticco-glycolic acid.29, 30 It is approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), 
cystoid macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion and non-infectious uveitis.31

 The dexamethasone implant is well suited for treatment of chronic, inflammatory macular 
diseases.
Recently, Kuppermann and colleagues32 conducted a 6-month, single-masked, multicenter 
study in which nvAMD patients were randomized to receive either dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant or sham and 2 intravitreal ranibizumab injections. They showed that the 
intravitreal dexamethasone implant increased the injection-free interval of anti-VEGF 
therapy, but did not change visual acuity or retinal thickness outcomes.32 Although their 
study groups included both patients previously receiving anti-VEGF therapy as well as 
treatment-naïve nvAMD patients, they did not examine the effect of the dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant in patients with sub-optimal responses to anti-VEGF monotherapy, 
which is a likely scenario that would necessitate treatment beyond anti-VEGF agents in the 
real world.32
Methods
The study herein is a single-center, interventional, retrospective consecutive case series. It 
was conducted with Institutional Review Board approval and in accordance with the ethical 
standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008.
Study patient population and inclusion/exclusion criteria
We conducted a retrospective chart review of clinical data of consecutive patients with 
treatment-resistant nvAMD who underwent dual therapy with anti-VEGF medication and 
the dexamethasone intravitreal implant concurrently at Associated Retinal Consultants, 
Royal Oak, Michigan between 2012-2016. To be eligible for the study, patients were 
required to meet the following inclusion criteria (Table 1): age >50, diagnosis of nvAMD 
with active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (as determined by clinical examination, 
spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fluorescein angiography 
(FA), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/30-20/800. Patients previously treated 
with photodynamic therapy or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injections were included 
as long as they received treatment more than 6 months prior to the dual therapy. Patients 
were required to have received at least two anti-VEGF intravitreal injections that showed 
treatment resistance and have a minimum of 3 months of follow-up. Treatment resistant 
nvAMD was defined as: (1) persistent intra- or sub-retinal fluid despite monthly injections, 
(2) no improvement in central foveal thickness and macular cube volume in response to anti-
VEGF injection(s), and (3) new or worsening subretinal hemorrhage despite monthly anti-
VEGF injections. The majority of patients had persistent intra-retinal fluid with or without 
sub-retinal fluid on OCT. The exclusion criteria included prior diagnosis of glaucoma or 
advanced cupping, history of intraocular pressure (IOP) steroid response to local or systemic 
steroids, and history of elevated IOP requiring topical therapy or glaucoma surgery. Patients 
with choroidal neovascularization from any cause other than nvAMD were excluded. 
Patients were also excluded if they had active diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, 
active ocular infection, aphakia or pseudophakia with an anterior chamber intraocular lens 
(ACIOL) or scleral-fixated IOL (Table 1).

 Intervention
The dual therapy was administered in patients with treatment resistant nvAMD after 
discussion of the off-label use of the dexamethasone intravitreal implant. All patients were 
counseled on the risks of potential injection-related complications such as endophthalmitis, 
cataract progression (if phakic), and IOP elevation. All patients received local anesthesia in 
the form of sub-conjunctival lidocaine 2% without epinephrine, and were prepped with 5% 
betadine to the injection sites with the aid of an eyelid speculum. First, the anti-VEGF agent 
was administered followed by injection of the dexamethasone intravitreal implant using 
aseptic technique. A sterile cotton-tipped applicator was applied to facilitate closure of the 
sclerotomy, and the eye was irrigated with balanced salt solution and given a drop of topical 
antibiotic. All patients received the same anti-VEGF agent they were receiving prior to dual 
therapy at the time of intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection, and continued to receive 
anti-VEGF injections of the same agent thereafter at the discretion of treating physician.
For patients who met the inclusion criteria, BCVA and multimodal imaging data (SD-OCT, 
fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence and FA) were collected and analyzed at every 
visit (Table 2). In addition, key safety data including IOP changes, worsening or new 
cataract formation, posterior segment complications, endophthalmitis and any implant-
related complications in the course of follow-up were reviewed from patients’ medical 
records (Table 3).
Statistics and data analysis
BCVA, central foveal thickness (CFT) and macular cube volume (MCV) data were collected 
and changes in these parameters were determined at the first visit after dual therapy was 
begun and at the visit following the last monotherapy anti-VEGF injection prior to the dual 
therapy. The clinical responses of three index patients to anti-VEGF monotherapy and 
subsequent dual therapy are summarized with their FA, OCT and BCVA data in Figures 1, 2 
and 3. The mean differences in CFT (Figure 4) and MCV (Figure 5) were evaluated for 
statistical significance using a paired t-test. Snellen visual acuities were converted to 
logMAR equivalents and their means compared using a twoway ANOVA with multiple 
comparisons (Figure 6). The correlation using a Pearson coefficient between total number of 
injections and change in CFT after dual therapy is summarized in Figure 7. The total number 
of anti-VEGF injections required in the 6 months before and after the dual therapy with the 
dexamethasone intravitreal implant was determined and the injection free interval computed 
(Figure 8). All statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism software 
(LaJolla, CA). For all comparisons, statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
Results
Eighteen eyes of 18 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the 
study (Table 1). The cohort represented all eyes that received dual therapy. Subjects had a 
mean age of 81.5 years (range 67–91 years), 8 (44.4%) were male and 10 (55.6%) were 
female (Table 2) and all were Caucasian. Most eyes were pseudophakic (16 or 88.9%) while 
only 2 (11.1%) were phakic. Patients underwent a mean of 26.3 anti-VEGF injections (range 
2-56) prior to having dual therapy with the dexamethasone intravitreal implant. Prior

 treatments included injections of bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept, with 17 (94.4%) 
patients having received at least two different drugs in their course of prior treatment and 
one patient having received a series of 6 ranibizumab injections only before dual therapy. 
Only 2 (11.1%) patients had prior photodynamic therapy and 2 (11.1%) had intravitreal 
triamcinolone acetonide, all of which occurred at least 6 months before dual therapy.
The mean length of follow-up was 8.2 months (range 4-14.2 months). The dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant dual therapy was overall well tolerated; the frequency of adverse effects 
is summarized in Table 3. Transient IOP elevation effectively treated with topical glaucoma 
drops developed in 2 (11.1%) of patients. None of the patients required glaucoma surgery. 
One patient with pre-existing cataract developed worsening cataract and became 
symptomatic. This patient underwent successful cataract extraction without complications. 
There were no cases of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage or implant-related 
complications.
Figures 1, 2 and 3 summarize clinical data from three index patients included in the series. 
The first is an 87 year-old pseudophakic Caucasian woman with nvAMD and active CNV 
(Figure 1A, B). The patient received 24 anti-VEGF injections at baseline, but had persistent 
subretinal fluid on monthly aflibercept therapy (panels C-E demonstrate OCTs following the 
last three aflibercept injections, each associated with 20/50 vision). Following a single dual 
therapy treatment, there was significant resolution of intraretinal and subretinal fluid and VA 
improved to 20/25 (Figure 1F). The second patient is a 67 year-old phakic Caucasian man 
with recent conversion to nvAMD (Figure 2 A, B) who failed to significantly respond to 
initial ranibizumab and subsequent bevacizumab intravitreal injections (Figure 2 C-E). 
However, after one dual therapy treatment with the dexamethasone intravitreal implant 
combined with bevacizumab, the patient showed significant resolution of intra- and sub-
retinal fluid and experienced significant improvement in BCVA to 20/70 from 20/800 
(Figure 2F). The third patient is a 74 year-old pseudophakic man with active subfoveal CNV 
and persistent intra-retinal fluid despite 30 bevacizumab and aflibercept intravitreal 
injections. He underwent injection of intravitreal ranibizumab with minimal response 
(Figure 3A, B) before he received a combination treatment of intravitreal ranibizumab and 
dexamethasone implant. This resulted in complete resolution of the intraretinal fluid (Figure 
3C). He was observed monthly without anti-VEGF therapy, without recurrence of fluid 
(Figure 3D, E), and requiring only a single dual therapy during 12 months of follow up 
(Figure 3F).
Figures 4 and 5 summarize the mean change in CFT and MCV after dual therapy with the 
dexamethasone intravitreal implant and anti-VEGF injection compared to anti-VEGF 
therapy alone. Following dual therapy, there was a significant reduction in mean CFT of 
126.3 μm compared to a mean increase in mean CFT of 29.9 μm with anti-VEGF treatment 
alone. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0017). Furthermore, as a result of 
combined treatment there was a statistically significant reduction in MCV of - 0.85 mm3 
compared to a mean increase in MCV of 0.19 mm3 with anti-VEGF treatment alone 
(p=0.0014).

 Figure 6 summarizes the visual acuity data. Anti-VEGF therapy alone did not produce 
significant mean change in logMAR BCVA. Dual therapy with the dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant resulted in a small trend towards improvement of mean BCVA, but the 
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.92). Although there was no change in mean 
BCVA, vision improved by at least one line in 6 (33.3%) of patients as a result of dual 
therapy.
Patients who had improvement in BCVA as a result of combined treatment had a lower mean 
number of prior anti-VEGF injections (21.0 vs 28.9), which may suggest that earlier 
treatment is beneficial. To investigate this, we performed a correlation analysis between the 
change in CFT and number of anti-VEGF injections as a surrogate marker of baseline 
nvAMD disease duration. There was mild-moderate correlation between number of prior 
anti-VEGF injections and the likelihood of CFT reduction in response to dual therapy 
(Figure 7) with the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.375). In addition, dual therapy 
significantly reduced the number of required anti-VEGF injections after combined injections 
(Figure 8). The mean total number of injections during the 6 months before dual therapy 
(5.33) was significantly greater than the total number of injections during the 6 months after 
dual therapy (4.25) with p=0.0199 (Figure 8A). In addition, the mean treatment-free interval 
between injections before (1.13 months) was significantly extended to 1.74 months as a 
result of dual therapy (Figure 8B, p=0.0312).
Discussion
Over the past decade, anti-VEGF therapy has become the standard of care for the treatment 
of nvAMD. Despite the success of anti-VEGF agents, a significant proportion of eyes with 
nvAMD will demonstrate partial or no treatment response demonstrated by persistent 
intraretinal or subretinal fluid. In the Comparison of Age Related Macular Degeneration 
Treatment Trial (CATT), up to 50% of patients on monthly anti-VEGF therapy had 
persistent fluid on OCT.10,33 Although the majority of these “incomplete responders” 
retained good vision with continued anti-VEGF therapy,34 patients with persistent fluid 
associated with macular exudation, hemorrhage and/or worsening vision despite monthly 
anti-VEGF therapy can be classified as having treatment-resistant nvAMD and are at risk for 
vision loss. It can be a challenge for physicians to get complete resolution of the fluid after 
many injections and a variety of treatment strategies have been employed. These include 
switching anti-VEGF agents,14,35-37 increasing the injection dose or frequency,38,39 and 
combining anti-VEGF therapy with PDT40 and/or intravitreal steroids.41,42
Combination therapy with intravitreal steroids may simultaneously address both angiogenic 
(VEGF-mediated) and inflammatory mechanisms of choroidal neovascularization and its 
associated intraretinal and subretinal fluid.43,44 Although it was used before in nvAMD eyes 
because of its high potency,41,42 intravitreal dexamethasone given as a single injection has 
limited clinical usefulness because of its very short half-life.28 The dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant, however, offers sustained release of dexamethasone in the vitreous 
cavity with a clinically meaningful effect of 3-4 months duration. In this study, we report a 
case-series of consecutive nvAMD patients with treatment resistance to anti-VEGF 
monotherapy who were then treated with dual therapy of the same anti-VEGF agent plus the

 off-label use of the dexamethasone intravitreal implant. This is a consecutive series that 
presents the data from every patient that received dual therapy for persistently active 
nvAMD. Patients enrolled in the study met strict inclusion criteria and were consistently 
managed. The patients had a significant decrease in CFT and MCV after a single dual 
therapy. There was a mild to moderate correlation between CFT change and the number of 
prior anti-VEGF injections, suggesting that earlier treatment with dual therapy may result in 
a more significant anatomic response. Although visual improvement of at least one line of 
BCVA was observed in a third of patients, the mean visual acuity gains did not reach 
statistical significance. It is possible that earlier treatment with the dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant, along with continued anti-VEGF treatment may have increased the 
likelihood of a more significant visual improvement, but this question requires further study 
with a larger sample size of patients. Dual therapy resulted in a small but significant 
reduction in the mean number of required injections and resulted in a significant extension in 
the treatment-free interval. In one patient, we were able to eliminate persistent intra-retinal 
fluid and get the patient off the anti-VEGF injections completely. This suggests that dual 
therapy may reduce treatment burden in neovascular AMD as was suggested previously.32 It 
is also potentially possible that earlier initiation of dual therapy would have shown a greater 
effect in reducing the subsequent treatment burden also. Unfortunately, the number of 
patients was too small to adequately comment on differences in response of eyes with 
intraretinal fluid with a frank cystoid appearance to those that had predominately subretinal 
fluid and less or no cystoid macular edema as part of the nvAMD complex.
Overall, dual therapy with the intravitreal dexamethasone implant was well tolerated, but it 
produced the predictable effect of worsening cataract and mild IOP elevation (managed with 
drops alone) in a small subset of patients, which is consistent with the reported side effects 
of this agent.45,46 There were no implant-related or same day double injection-related 
complications.
The limitations of this study include its retrospective design, small sample size and lack of 
control group. In addition, the patient cohort had a heterogeneous treatment history with 
varied durations of therapy. This likely reflected the variability of the underlying biology of 
disease in each patient, including the variability in type and size of the choroidal neovascular 
lesions. These metrics were not measured as doing so was beyond the intent and scope of 
our study. Conversely, the study was done at a single-center with relatively homogenous, 
predominantly Caucasian population, its results may not necessarily be applied to other 
races, which may respond differently to intravitreal anti-VEGF and/or steroid therapy, and 
may have higher rates of nvAMD variants such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). 
Lastly, the response to the combined treatment is still difficult to predict as there are no 
widely-available direct measurements of the inflammatory activity in eyes with active CNV 
lesions. The development of biomarker assays for nvAMD treatment non-responders will be 
important to help us adequately stratify patients that would benefit most from combined 
therapy.
The simultaneous use of the dexamethasone intravitreal implant in combination with anti-
VEGF therapy for nvAMD may be a safe and effective treatment option for eyes resistant to 
anti-VEGF monotherapy with persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid. Earlier treatment

 with such dual therapy may maximize anatomic and visual outcomes and reduce the 
treatment burden. We look forward to the continued evaluation of dual therapy as a treatment 
for treatment-resistant nvAMD through larger, prospective multicenter trials. This will allow 
us to better understand which patients are the best candidates for such intervention and 
hopefully lead to earlier intervention. We also look forward to the development of safe, 
straightforward methods of clinical assessment of inflammatory cytokines in eyes receiving 
intravitreal injection therapy with the hope that they will correlate with responses to therapy 
with agents that act through different mechanisms and so treatment paradigms may be more 
specifically titrated for each individual patient.

 Figure 1. 
Patient 1 is an 87 year old pseudophakic Caucasian woman with neovascular AMD and 
active choroidal neovascularization (A, B) who presented with intra- and sub-retinal fluid on 
OCT (C). She underwent multiple intravitreal ranibizumab and aflibercept injections (>20), 
but developed persistent fluid despite monthly injections of each and had a BCVA of 20/50 
(C, D, E). She underwent dual therapy with intravitreal aflibercept and the dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant, which resulted in significant improvement of intra- and sub-retinal fluid 
and improved BCVA to 20/25 (F). She did not have any IOP elevation or injection- related 
complications.

Patient 2 is an 67 year-old phakic Caucasian man with active neovascular AMD with 
subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (A, B). Patient had significant intra-retinal fluid with 
exudate on OCT (C) and underwent intravitreal injection of ranibizumab with minimal 
response (D) after 1 month. He subsequently received another injection of bevacizumab, but 
with a similar lack of effect (E) after 1 month. At that time, the eye was treated with a 
combined injection of intravitreal bevacizumab and the dexamethasone intravitreal implant 
after which there was a significant decrease in intraretinal fluid and improvement of visual 
acuity to 20/70 after 1 month (F). There was no elevation of IOP or injection-related 
complications.

Patient 3 is a 74 year-old pseudophakic man with neovascular AMD and active subfoveal 
CNV with persistent intra-retinal fluid despite multiple bevacizumab (n=15) and aflibercept 
(n=15) intravitreal injections. Patient underwent injection of intravitreal ranibizumab (A) 
with minimal change in fluid appearance on OCT after 1 month (B). Then, combined 
intravitreal ranibizumab and dexamethasone intravitreal implant were given with complete 
resolution of the intraretinal fluid (C). As a result, no anti-VEGF treatment was given at this 
visit and patient continued to do well with observation alone at 1 month (D) and 3 months 
(E) post-combined treatment without anti-VEGF injections. At that time, additional 
combined intravitreal ranibizumab and dexamethasone intravitreal implant were given, and 
patient followed at monthly intervals for 1 year with stable visual acuity without requiring 
additional anti-VEGF or dual therapy re-treatment (F). The best corrected visual acuity 
remained stable at 20/50.

Comparison of the treatment burden before and after dual therapy with the dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant and anti-VEGF agent. The mean total number of anti-VEGF injections 
in the 6 months after dual therapy (4.25 injections) was significantly decreased compared to 
the mean during the 6 months prior to dual therapy (5.33 injections) (p=0.0199). The mean 
injection-free interval during the 6 months following dual therapy (1.75 months) was 
significantly longer compared to that seen during the 6 months before dual therapy (1. 13 
months) (p=0.0312).
