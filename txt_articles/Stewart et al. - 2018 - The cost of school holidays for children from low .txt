Abstract
School holidays can be stressful periods for children from low-income families. Poor provision 
of appropriate childcare, limited access to enrichment activities, and food insecurity mean that 
children’s health and well-being can suffer and their learning stagnate or decline. This article 
examines and documents the evidence that has emerged on this topic and aims to raise its 
profile and the impact on children’s lives. It makes the case for further academic scrutiny of this 
unexamined and neglected subject.

Introduction
The summer holidays are often sentimentalized as a happy and carefree time for chil-
dren, abound with new experiences and opportunities to play, relax, create memories, 
and develop essential social skills. While this is true for many children, for some, the 
school holidays are a stressful and impoverished period of isolation, boredom, and inac-
tivity (Blazer, 2011). For low-income families, summer holidays often entail increased 
financial pressures, food insecurity, poor health, and exclusion from culturally enriching 
and healthful activities (Rai, 2015). Unequal access to and limited participation in such 
engaging activities means that many children miss out on interesting educational and 
developmental opportunities otherwise enjoyed by their more affluent peers (Blazer, 
2011; Meyer et al., 2004; Summer Learning Association, 2009a). As a result, their learn-
ing stagnates and declines while their health and well-being also suffers (Graham et al.,

2016; Slates et al., 2012). There is now an emerging body of evidence which suggests 
that the prolonged summer break has an accumulative effect on educational outcomes 
and may be one of the most fundamental, yet least acknowledged, contributors toward 
the attainment gap between richest and poorest children, accounting for almost two-
thirds of the gap by the time children reach the age of 14 (Alexander et al., 2007, 2016; 
Slates et al., 2012; Von Drehle, 2010).
Despite ongoing commitment from successive UK governments to address child pov-
erty and persistent attainment gaps (Carter-Wall and Whitfield, 2012), the impact of the 
school holidays on children’s educational development and well-being remains an under-
explored topic, with ameliorative measures being provided by third-sector initiatives. 
Pressure groups such as Feeding America and End Summer Hunger in the United States 
and End Hunger UK in the United Kingdom have been established with the aim of both 
providing food over the summer but also to campaign and bring this issue to the forefront 
of public policy. There is, however, a relative dearth of academic research in this area and 
on holiday childcare more generally, despite its importance to families and the economy, 
and what little is available is largely gray literature (Cameron and Kiss, 2017; Graham 
et al., 2016). Presenting and engaging with the findings that have emerged from collabo-
rative research into potential sustainable models of childcare, food, and learning oppor-
tunities for low-income families during the summer holidays, this article aims to raise the 
profile of these issues and their impact on children’s lives and make the case for further 
academic scrutiny of this topic. The effects of living in poverty on families and children 
are complex and multifactorial (Barnes et al., 2010). There are clearly broader structural 
inequalities at work in shaping educational outcomes and children’s well-being. However, 
the cost of summer holidays and its effect on attainment, both educationally and in terms 
of well-being, points to a policy blind spot with respect to providing equal opportunities 
for children.
This article examines the challenges families face during the school holidays and the 
effects that these cumulative disadvantages have on children’s educational attainment and 
well-being. This is the first time this research has been drawn together, looking across a 
range of issues including isolation, hunger, boredom, enrichment activities, childcare and 
their intersection with well-being and educational attainment. While focusing primarily 
on UK literature, it does draw on international evidence where appropriate. Electronic 
databases of peer-reviewed and gray literature, including Web of Science, Embase, 
Medline, ERIC, Open Grey, and Google Scholar, were searched using terms for school 
holiday (including “vacation,” “not in term time,” and “non term time”) and for childcare 
and nutrition (including “food poverty” and “food security”). The results, in combination 
with further iterative searches and articles from personal libraries, were used to develop 
this discussion. The article begins with a consideration of the effect of the summer holi-
days on children’s educational attainment and development by examining the phenome-
non of summer learning loss, that is, the academic decline experienced by children as a 
result of the prolonged summer break and the disruption to learning that this entails 
(Alexander et al., 2007, 2016). We are not suggesting that this is the key reason for addres-
ing this issue, rather it provides firm, empirical and objective evidence for the harm sum-
mer holidays can cause some children. The article then examines some of the problems 
that may be the cause of this learning loss, focusing in particular on the provision and cost 
 518 
Childhood 25(4)
of childcare over the holiday period before discussing the growing problem of food inse-
curity. The article concludes by arguing that there is a strong case for action in this area. 
These problems can be tackled, as evidence from the third sector demonstrates; what is 
required is the right investment and policy initiatives from government.
Summer learning loss and the attainment gap
Research on summer learning loss shows that during the school holidays, children’s 
learning is not only at risk of stagnating but regressing, and that this decline may be more 
pronounced in children from low-income families, as well as for children with learning 
disabilities and children for whom English is a second language (Graham et al., 2012; 
Kerry and Davies, 1998). Some have argued that summer learning loss is the main factor 
behind the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students and that this is pre-
dominately driven by the inequalities experienced during the summer holidays (Alexander 
et al., 2016; Blazer, 2011).
Successive UK-based governments have made closing the attainment gap a key pol-
icy target, where across the country levels of inequality are greater than many other 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (Andrews 
et al., 2017; Sosu and Ellis, 2014). The importance of this has been intensified by auster-
ity where educational disadvantage has played a key role in shaping future outcomes 
(Carter-Wall and Whitfield, 2012; McCluskey, 2017). Recent governmental approaches 
in England have moved away from a more “broadly structural approach informed by 
social justice to a narrower focus on ‘troubled families’” (Ridge, 2013: 412). This 
approach relies heavily on the idea that educational outcomes can be improved through 
“raising aspirations” in low-income families (Carter-Wall and Whitfield, 2012). As a 
result, these approaches have emphasized individualized strategies of attitude and behav-
ior modification, and focus on promoting resilience while neglecting more structural 
understandings of poverty and educational disadvantage (Carter-Wall and Whitfield, 
2012). As such, recent poverty strategies have been criticized for treating children as 
prospective workers of the next generation who should be equipped with the tools to 
remediate their future disadvantage with little regard for childhood as an experience in 
and of itself (Ridge, 2013). Although this represents a valid concern regarding the nature 
of learning and ideological underpinning of children’s education, pragmatically speaking 
educational outcomes have real consequences for future life chances.
There has been little research into summer learning loss in the United Kingdom and 
therefore much of the literature in this area is North American in origin. However, in a 
recent survey of over 1000 primary and secondary schools in England, 77% of primary 
school leaders and 60% of secondary leaders voiced concern about summer learning loss 
among their students (Key Insights, 2014). Evidence for summer learning loss shows 
that during term-time, children across all income groups learn basic skills at similar 
rates; however, during the summer months, children from low-income families fall 
weeks or months behind their middle- and high-income peers (Alexander et al., 2007; 
Chaplin and Capizzano, 2006; Miller, 2007; Terzian et al., 2009; Von Drehle, 2010). This 
backslide in learning is usually measured using standardized tests administered before 
and after summer holidays (Cooper et al., 1996; Downey et al., 2004; Entwisle and 
 Stewart et al. 
519
Alexander, 1992; Heyns, 1978). Evidence submitted to the All-Party Parliamentary 
Group on Hunger (APPG) (Forsey, 2017) in the United Kingdom suggests that it takes 
up to 6 weeks for teachers to re-teach material forgotten over the summer period.
In their review of 39 studies on pre-secondary children’s learning during the summer 
period, Cooper et al. (1996) conducted a meta-analysis on the 13 highest quality studies 
and discovered that summer learning loss affects different subject areas to varying degrees. 
For example, learning loss was more substantial in mathematical computation and spell-
ing skills than in reading. This is likely because these particular skills are based in factual 
and procedural knowledge and therefore more susceptible to forgetting if they are not 
reinforced through practice (Cooper et al., 1996). While all students regardless of income 
lost approximately equal amounts in maths skills (an average of 1.8 months of progress) 
and spelling skills (4 months of progress), low-income students are subject to the largest 
learning loss when it comes to reading recognition, losing approximately 1.5 months 
while higher-income children gained around 2.3 months (Cooper et al., 1996). The 
researchers found little evidence to suggest that students’ prior achievement levels, gen-
der, or ethnicity had any consistent influence on summer learning loss; however, they did 
find that learning loss became more of an issue as children got older (Cooper et al., 1996).
Further evidence of summer learning loss comes from Alexander et al. (2007) who 
employed data from the Baltimore Beginning School study which followed a representa-
tive random sample of 790 school children from first grade until the age of 22. By ana-
lyzing data from reading comprehension tests given to the same students twice-yearly 
(autumn and spring), the researchers were able to isolate gains made during the school 
term from those made during the summer. When test scores reflected predominately 
term-time learning, low-income students kept pace with higher-income classmates 
(Alexander et al., 2007). During the summer however, higher-income students’ reading 
skills continued to improve while lower-income students lost ground. By the end of fifth 
grade (Primary 6 in Scotland/Year 5 in England), students from higher-income homes 
had gained approximately 47 points in their test scores thanks to their continued summer 
learning. For children from low-income homes, test scores decreased by 2 points over the 
same period. Alexander et al. (2007) concluded that by ninth grade (Secondary fourth 
year in Scotland/Year 10 in England), almost two-thirds of the achievement gap between 
higher- and lower-income children was explained by unequal access to summer learning 
opportunities during their early school years.
Downey et al. (2004) have reported similar findings after examining the learning rates 
of high- and low-income students over the school year and during the summer holidays. 
Using data from 20,000 children included in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, 
they found that the attainment gap was already present before school began and contin-
ued to widen after school started. However, the results indicated that once at school, the 
attainment gap between high- and low-income children grew much more rapidly over the 
summer months than it did during term-time (Downey et al., 2004). In the United States, 
this has prompted debate on how best to tackle summer learning loss, with reform of the 
school calendar implemented in some states to support Year Round Education (YRE) 
(Kerry and Davies, 1998). Others have argued that summer learning loss might be best 
addressed through the provision of high-quality summer camps and activities, a consid-
eration which we will return to in our discussion of food insecurity (Graham, 2014).

Childhood 25(4)
What these studies highlight is that summer learning loss is cumulative in that low-
income children fall further and further behind higher-income students year on year 
(Terzian et al., 2009). It is important to note that although we have focused on the issue 
of summer learning loss and the educational disadvantage this entails for poorer children, 
we would like to stress that lower-income families are not a homogeneous group and the 
relationship between poverty and educational attainment is inherently complex (Carter-
Wall and Whitfield, 2012). While learning opportunities and enriching activities are 
clearly inhibited by cost, children’s learning and well-being is also mediated by many 
other activities.
That being said, there is strong evidence to suggest that children’s learning and well-
being is put at risk without access to affordable, high-quality, and engaging childcare, the 
absence of which may also inhibit earning potential for parents (Diss and Jarvie, 2016). 
Children also require adequate food and other basic commodities during the holiday 
period. This article now turns to a discussion of some of the issues associated with holi-
day childcare for low-income families.
Childcare
Accessing affordable and good-quality childcare during the summer months is essential 
for both the economy and families, enabling parents to continue with their ongoing com-
mitments and responsibilities safe in the knowledge that their children are in a secure, fun, 
and engaging space (Cameron and Jarvie, 2016). Paid employment is politically endorsed 
as the route through which low-income families can remediate the poverty and inequality 
they experience, with childcare portrayed as the means of seizing these work opportuni-
ties (Petrie, 2015). However, holiday childcare costs are high and exceed many family 
budgets with 1 week of full-time care in the UK costing an average of £124.23 (Cameron 
and Kiss, 2017: 3). As Petrie (2015: 283) has recently noted, nursery places cost 77% 
more than they did in 2003 while earnings have remained largely unchanged. For many 
families, the high cost of childcare can mean that during the school holiday period, they 
are financially no better off in work, with some families seeing zero net income gain while 
other low-income earners can expect to take home as little as £1.96 per hour after having 
paid for childcare (Harding et al., 2017: 24; Petrie, 2015). A report by the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies showed that although the proportion of children with working parents rose 
between 2009-2010 and 2013-2014, a decrease in real earnings has meant reduced 
incomes for families and therefore the proportion of children in poverty from working 
families increased from 54% to 63% over the same period (Belfield et al., 2015). More 
recently, Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) (2017a) reported that the number of chil-
dren living in poverty is now 4 million and that in-work poverty is the most prevalent 
form of child poverty with 67% of poor children living in low-income households.
A Joseph Rowntree report into the potential of parental employment to reduce child 
poverty found increased exits from work from July to September which the researchers 
attributed to parents’ inability to source and afford childcare during the summer months 
(Simmonds and Bivand, 2008). The report also showed increases in lone parent benefit 
claims during the summer holidays, indicating that this period was particularly difficult 
for lone parents to sustain work and confined many parents with caring responsibilities 
 Stewart et al. 
521
to a “no-pay, low-pay cycle” (Rabindrakumar, 2014, 2015; Simmonds and Bivand, 2008: 
16). As CPAG (2017a) has noted, 47% of children from lone parent families live in pov-
erty. These findings have been further supported by research from Graham and McQuaid 
(2014) who reported that the lack of suitable and affordable childcare acts as a significant 
barrier to employment for lone parents. Of particular concern here is the risk of benefit 
sanctioning as lone parents are increasingly obliged to fulfill work-related requirements 
and actively seek work which may be especially difficult to accommodate during the 
summer without appropriate childcare (Graham and McQuaid, 2014; Petrie, 2015). 
Moreover, without access to suitable childcare and when faced with these sanctions or 
disciplinary procedures at work, some parents are forced to leave their children in risky 
situations with minimal supervision or indeed home alone (Petrie, 2015).
Literature exploring the lack of childcare during the summer holidays is limited, even 
though this is regularly raised whenever childcare problems are discussed. Under the 
Childcare Act 2006, local authorities in England and Wales are legally obliged to provide 
adequate childcare to parents who are working or undertaking training for work and to 
audit parental demand (Cameron and Jarvie, 2016; Rutter, 2015). Since September 2016, 
parents and childcare providers in England have had the “right to request” that local 
schools be used to provide wraparound and holiday childcare (Cameron and Jarvie, 
2016: 20). This policy was implemented to encourage schools to make better use of 
existing facilities and has the potential to fill holiday childcare gaps through offering 
families accessible and affordable childcare in familiar settings. This seems to represent 
a renewed interest in the potential of Extended Schools, a scheme originally introduced 
by New Labour to provide a range of services in local schools such as childcare, recrea-
tional activities, and parental support services but which quickly dissipated following 
austerity cuts and the end of ring-fenced funding (Cameron and Jarvie, 2016). However, 
unless parents are openly informed of their rights to request and the process involved and 
until this right is statutorily enforced, this scheme can act only as a means of encouraging 
schools to consider such provision (Cameron and Jarvie, 2016). In England, some local 
authorities have reported that the policy has been difficult to realize as a result of limited 
resources and the pressures and demands surrounding the implementation of the new 
entitlement to a minimum of 30 hours childcare (Cameron and Kiss, 2017). As of July 
2017, the right to request policy has had little impact and would benefit from local com-
munication drives which clarified the process as well as being statutorily implemented to 
ensure that these requests are properly investigated (Cameron and Kiss, 2017).
In contrast to England and Wales, although Scottish local authorities must take a stra-
tegic approach toward providing accessible childcare, there is no legal obligation for 
them to do so and therefore no statutory guidance or legal definitions regarding “suffi-
ciency” of provision (Cameron and Jarvie, 2016). Recent research on the cost of school 
holidays and childcare in Glasgow found that 86% of parents agreed that childcare is too 
expensive and a further 57% reported that childcare did not suit their working schedule 
(CPAG, 2015: 42). According to the Holiday Childcare Survey for 2015, only three local 
authorities in Scotland had enough holiday childcare for working parents (Rutter, 2015).
Shortages in provision have worsened across the United Kingdom in recent years with 
more than 5 million children living in areas where there is inadequate childcare (Cameron 
and Jarvie, 2016). This is a particular problem for families living in deprived areas where 
 522 
Childhood 25(4)
there is less provision generally and has been exacerbated by the closure of over 100 Sure 
Start centers which are disproportionately located in poorer areas (Rutter and Stocker, 
2014). Holiday support for children with Additional Support Needs and disabilities is 
particularly poor, with local authorities reporting little to no provision for such families 
(Cameron and Jarvie, 2016). Many parents feel that this lack of suitable care disrupts 
routine and that limited access to structured activities during the holiday period nega-
tively impacts their children’s well-being (CPAG, 2015). Provision for older children, 
especially children aged between 11 and 14 is also sparse and although parents often felt 
that children this age were still too young to be left unattended for too long, many child-
care providers do not cater to children aged 11 and over (Rabindrakumar, 2014).
For some parents, the difficulties in managing childcare costs and scheduling have 
resulted in them taking unpaid leave, choosing zero-hour contracts or self-employment and 
to shoulder the risks and low pay associated with these instead of taking on more perma-
nent, better rewarded, and secure employment (Hawkins, 2014; Hoggart and Vegeris, 
2008; Rabindrakumar, 2014). Following a survey of 614 lone parents on the difficulties of 
accessing suitable childcare during the holidays, Hawkins (2014) found that 29% had been 
forced to reduce their working hours, and 16% had stopped looking for work altogether or 
turned down employment in order to care for their children. The Holiday Childcare Survey 
for 2014 found that some parents reported their employers were often unsympathetic and 
inflexible when it came to scheduling work around childcare needs, leading 17% of parents 
to admit to taking sick days in order to look after their children (Rutter and Lugton, 2014: 
3). If this pattern of absence is applied more generally to all UK parents, “one day missed 
to cover childcare every year represents over 900,000 lost working days and costs the UK 
economy nearly £100 million every year” (Rutter and Lugton, 2014: 3).
The current UK Conservative government has promised to double the provision of 
free childcare from 15 to 30 hours for children aged 3 and 4 from September 2017; how-
ever, this will only be available to working parents in England (with similar policies 
planned in future for Scotland and Wales) who earn the equivalent of 16 hours per week 
at national living wage (Johnes and Hutchinson, 2016). This restricted eligibility means 
that children coming from families on the lowest incomes or from non-working house-
holds miss out (especially where parents may be on zero-hour contracts or in insecure 
employment) and is particularly troubling given that it is this group of children who 
stand to gain the most from good-quality, early years education (Johnes and Hutchinson, 
2016; Preston, 2008). There are also concerns that given the current shortage and patchy 
provision of nursery places, the government budget to implement this initiative is not 
sufficient and that the extra costs needed to subsidize this funding shortfall will be passed 
onto parents (Johnes and Hutchinson, 2016). What is more, Johnes and Hutchinson 
(2016) have warned that the increased competition for limited nursery places means 
there is a danger that childcare providers will prioritize children who qualify for the full 
30 hours of care at the expense of those who only qualify for the universal 15 hours. This 
policy has therefore been criticized for prioritizing parental employment over children’s 
development and overlooks the opportunity to implement high-quality early years edu-
cation and address attainment gaps (Johnes and Hutchinson, 2016). Since the free child-
care is only available during school term-time, the problem of finding care for children 
outside term-time remains, even for parents able to access the free childcare.
 Stewart et al.

What our review of childcare demonstrates is that provision of holiday care is not 
only expensive but unsuitable and insufficient to meet the needs of low-income families. 
While childcare is portrayed as a service which facilitates parental employment and by 
extension the amelioration of poverty, the issue of childcare as a positive experience 
which supports children’s developmental needs and well-being is overlooked (Petrie, 
2015). We now turn to a discussion of the growing problem of food insecurity during the 
summer holidays and the impact this has on children’s well-being and education.
Food insecurity
Sufficient access to nutritiously adequate food is recognized as a basic human right yet 
there are many low-income families in the United Kingdom who struggle to get enough 
food and are classified as food-insecure (Defeyter et al., 2015; Graham et al., 2016). 
Food insecurity is typically defined as insufficient and insecure access to nutritionally 
adequate food due to resource constraints. It has become a topic of growing concern 
amid rising demands for food aid and the increased usage of food banks across the United 
Kingdom (Graham et al., 2016; Taylor and Loopstra, 2016). According to data on food 
insecurity in the United Kingdom gathered by United Nations, in 2014, an estimated 8.4 
million people lived in households with insufficient food security (Taylor and Loopstra, 
2016). However, without any national monitoring of food insecurity, Taylor and Loopstra 
(2016) warn that the real magnitude of this problem remains largely obscured and allows 
the government to remain inactive on the issue (Rai, 2015).
Recent research suggests that low-income families find the long summer holidays 
particularly difficult as children lose access to free school meals and experience food 
insecurity or what has been referred to as “holiday hunger” (Graham et al., 2016: 2; Gill 
and Sharma, 2004). A recent report by the APPG in the United Kingdom (Forsey, 2017: 
4) estimates that up to 3 million children are at risk of going hungry during the school 
holidays. Although children who qualify for free school meals through low income are 
identified as those at greatest risk from holiday hunger, they account for only a third of 
this figure, highlighting the food insecurity faced by families experiencing in-work pov-
erty (Forsey, 2017: 11).
Oral evidence submitted by researchers and food bank staff to the APPG described 
how food bank use accelerates significantly among families during the long summer 
holidays as they struggle to feed their children every day (Forsey, 2017: 9). Last year, 
Britain’s largest food bank network, The Trussell Trust, found that the number of families 
seeking food aid because they could not afford to feed their children over the school holi-
days had doubled since 2015 with 5000 extra food parcels going to children in July and 
August than in the preceding few months (Forsey, 2017: 13). In addition to relying on 
food banks, several pieces of research have reported that many parents have resorted to 
skipping meals as a “coping strategy” in a bid to feed their children over the summer 
holidays (CPAG, 2017b, 2015; Forsey, 2017: 16; Graham et al., 2016).
The malnourishment that comes from food insecurity can manifest in children’s bod-
ies in a number of ways. Upon return to school, teachers have observed the obvious 
physical consequences in children who are “noticeably thinner” and sluggish as well as 
the negative effects it exacts on their mental well-being and ability to learn (Forsey, 
 524 
Childhood 25(4)
2017; Rai, 2015: 3). Malnutrition renders children unalert and unable to concentrate, 
demonstrating how holiday hunger can also exacerbate summer learning loss with chil-
dren who do not get enough to eat over the summer period returning to school “weeks, if 
not months, intellectually behind their more fortunate peers” (Forsey, 2017: 23). A recent 
report commissioned by CPAG (2017b: 06) in collaboration with the Royal College of 
Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) found that of the 266 pediatricians surveyed, 253 
believed that food insecurity contributed to the ill-health of the children they treated. The 
inability to provide nutritionally adequate food was associated with both poor growth 
and rising obesity in deprived children and that some parents struggled to afford essen-
tials such as clothes, toothpaste, and toothbrushes (CPAG, 2017b: 06). Of the 266 pedia-
tricians surveyed by CPAG (2017b: 11), 251 believed that the worry and stress associated 
with poverty negatively harmed the psychological well-being of children, revealing the 
less obvious manifestation of material disadvantage in feelings of shame, stigma, and 
anxiety (Ridge, 2013). These combine with and reinforce the harm caused by malnutri-
tion and Hirsch (2013; CPAG, 2017b) has estimated that child poverty costs the country 
£1.5 billion a year as a result of the increased need for acute healthcare.
That children are being left to go hungry at all is abhorrent but is all the more worry-
ing given the effect that this malnutrition has on children’s learning and attainment as 
“Children who are hungry more frequently fall behind academically” (Forsey, 2017: 
25). While all children experience a gap in formal educational instruction during the 
holidays, it is children with impoverished diets and with limited access to enriching 
activities who are most prone to learning loss. It has been estimated that it takes up to 
6 weeks for such children to physically and mentally readjust and be ready to reengage 
with the school curriculum (Forsey, 2017).
Although hunger represents a significant barrier to children’s education and well-
being, the cumulative struggles facing low-income families during the holidays such as 
the limiting costs of activities and suitable childcare demonstrate the multiple disadvan-
tages that children from food-insecure homes experience (CPAG, 2015; Forsey, 2017). 
The APPG report identified that among the many factors associated with increased risk 
of food insecurity (such as high living costs, low incomes, insecure employment, and 
delayed benefit payments and sanctions) were three unique contributors: the increased 
overall cost of looking after children during the holidays, the lack of affordable child-
care, and the loss of free school meals (Forsey, 2017). Addressing holiday hunger is 
therefore about much more than the provision of affordable and nutritious food and 
forms part of a much bigger picture in terms of children’s well-being, development, and 
life chances (CPAG, 2015; Forsey, 2017). As we have already highlighted, children from 
lower-income families are less likely to take part in enrichment activities during the sum-
mer holidays (Cooper et al., 1996). As such, initiatives which center around the provision 
of fun, enriching activities, as well as nutritious food, have been suggested as a means of 
ameliorating the multiple challenges facing low-income families in a way that regards 
the interests of children and avoids the stigma of “feeding stations for the poor” (CPAG 
in Forsey, 2017: 51; Graham, 2014; Ridge, 2013).
This is supported by research from Graham (2014) who argues that inequality gaps 
experienced by low-income families may be addressed through summer activity pro-
grams which maintain academic skills through a blend of learning, sport, and enrichment

activities coupled with with community food provision. According to Cooper et al. 
(1996), these sorts of programs would not only address educational attainment but also 
promote interpersonal skills and promote wellbeing. Feedback from third-sector food 
and fun programs report positive impacts upon children’s diet, social inclusion, physical 
activity, and learning opportunities as well as increased levels of concentration, confi-
dence, and skills (Defeyter et al., 2015; Forsey, 2017). Moreover, the various opportuni-
ties for parents to participate, volunteer, and access nutritional food and activities 
bolstered parental confidence, improved healthy food awareness, and meal preparation 
skills as well as offering informal social support though community networks (Defeyter 
et al., 2015; Forsey, 2017; Graham et al., 2016). These evaluations of summer programs 
provide valuable insights into how projects can make best use of existing facilities and 
local resources and suggest that a comprehensive system of protection against the chal-
lenges of poverty during the summer months could be implemented with the right fund-
ing and government support (Forsey, 2017).
The APPG hunger report has urged the UK government to eradicate holiday hunger 
by enacting a statutory requirement of local authorities to facilitate and coordinate sum-
mer food and fun programs (Forsey, 2017). Recommendations presented in the report 
draw upon examples of good practice found in many summer food and fun projects 
which have so far been successfully provided by third-sector initiatives (Forsey, 2017). 
Despite growing evidence on the ills of food insecurity, there has been no strategic com-
mitment from the UK government or legal requirements for local authorities to imple-
ment summer programs to tackle holiday hunger (Forsey, 2017; Gill and Sharma, 2004). 
This is not an issue which can be left to the benevolence of volunteers and third-sector 
provision and must become a policy priority of the government.
Conclusion
A clear conclusion that can be drawn from the literature is that for many low-income 
families, the summer holidays are an exceptionally difficult period. Not only are children 
from poorer families prevented from participating in enriching activities that many oth-
ers take for granted, but their health is also put at risk through malnourishment, isolation, 
and extended periods of inactivity. These disadvantages emerge from a range of overlap-
ping issues, including low income; welfare cuts and unsuitable, inaccessible, and insuf-
ficient childcare; the absence of free school meals; and the lack of suitable childcare 
during the summer. Parents’ opportunities to pursue working commitments are made 
increasingly difficult and this may further hinder attempts to move out of poverty. The 
disadvantages that low-income families face meld together and reinforce each other in 
ways which deeply permeate children’s lives (Petrie, 2015; Ridge, 2013). As we have 
shown, there is evidence to suggest that the combination of these factors exacts a toll 
upon children’s learning through the phenomenon of summer learning loss which in turn 
may contribute to the widening of attainment gaps between economically advantaged 
and disadvantaged students (Alexander et al., 2007; 2016).
Although presently there is no definitive solution to the problems faced by low-
income families, evidence suggests that if we are to tackle learning inequalities and 
support children’s education, health, and well-being, a system of social protection is 
required to negate the impact of poverty during the summer holidays. While ideally 
 526

these problems would be resolved through a more up-stream, structural approach tack-
ling what Marmot (2005) calls the “cause of the causes,” such an approach is likely to 
take time. These children need help immediately. The literature indicates that there are 
a number of key areas which must be addressed. First and foremost, steps must be 
taken to address the national problem of food insecurity to ensure that children do not 
go hungry or become malnourished during the school holidays. Not only does holiday 
hunger jeopardize children’s physical and mental well-being, it also impedes their 
capacity to participate in activities and learn (Forsey, 2017). Second, providing acces-
sible, good-quality childcare which meets the diverse needs of families is vital if chil-
dren’s learning and well-being is to be supported while enabling parents to pursue 
better paid and more secure employment. Third, although there is a substantial amount 
of evidence to support the claim that summer learning loss is a problem and a particu-
lar concern for low-income families, there is a lack of research within the UK context 
and on the long-term impact upon attainment and life outcomes, a gap which must be 
addressed through rigorous academic scrutiny.
However, given the already extensive and overwhelming evidence on the harm that 
surrounds the summer holiday experiences of children from low-income families, what 
is needed now is not just more research on the extent or nature of these inequities; rather 
there needs to be an emphasis on research on interventions that seek to tackle these ine-
qualities. We need to know what works and what does not in helping to improve out-
comes for children from low-income families over the summer and how best can we 
reform and change the lives of these children. Unless we take steps to tackle this prob-
lem, the evidence would suggest that attempts to rectify the attainment gaps in education, 
health, and well-being that exist between the wealthiest and poorest school children will 
be unlikely to succeed.
