Abstract
Background—Although over 40% of new breast cancer diagnoses in the U.S. are in older 
women, few studies have assessed the outcomes of post-mastectomy reconstruction in this 
population. Our objective was to evaluate age effects on postoperative complications and patient-
report outcomes (PROs) in women undergoing breast reconstruction, and to investigate whether 
age effects differ between reconstructive procedure types.
Study Design—Eligible patients in the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium study 
from 11 institutions (57 providers) in North America were analyzed. Two-year complications and 
PROs via BREAST-Q domains were compared across younger (<45 years), middle-aged (45–60 
years), and older (>60 years) women. Mixed-effects regression models were used, controlling for a 
range of demographic and clinical covariates.
Results—A total of 1,531 patients were studied: 494 younger, 803 middle-aged, and 234 older. 
Age was not a significant predictor of complications. For sexual well-being two years post-
reconstruction, older women reported 4.25 (p=0.04) higher mean scores with implant procedures, 
and 10.39 (p<.01) higher mean scores with autologous procedures compared to younger women. 
No age effect was seen with implant procedures with regards to physical and psychosocial well-
being; however, older women who underwent autologous procedures reported 6.07 (p<.01) higher 
physical and 8.21 (p<.01) higher psychosocial well-being scores than younger women.

 Conclusions—Age did not significantly affect complication rates. Older women demonstrated 
higher sexual well-being for both procedures, and better satisfaction, physical and psychosocial 
well-being than younger women with autologous procedures. Post-mastectomy reconstruction is a 
viable option for older patients, with risks and benefits comparable to those in younger women.
Precis
Findings collected from a multicenter, prospective trial confirm that post-mastectomy breast 
reconstruction is a viable option for older women (>60 years) with complication rates and patient-
reported outcome benefits comparable to those reported in younger women.
Introduction
According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, 
approximately 250,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. Nearly 40 
percent of these new diagnoses will be in older women, as the median age of breast cancer 
diagnosis is now 62 years old (1). As survival rates for breast cancer continue to improve, 
more patients will be living longer after being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. 
Moreover, use of mastectomy for breast cancer treatment has also risen over the past decade 
(2, 3). Along with this increase, more women have been opting for prophylactic mastectomy 
and breast reconstruction than ever before (2, 4–6). However, despite these trends, older 
women are still less likely to receive reconstruction following mastectomy, compared with 
younger patients (7–11).
There are several reasons that may explain why older women are less likely to undergo 
breast reconstruction. One possible explanation is that surgeons may not be offering 
reconstructive options to older women due to unfounded beliefs that elderly women would 
not tolerate the procedure well (12). For example, younger age (under 50 years) has been 
found to be the strongest predictor of being offered reconstruction (9). Another contributing 
factor may be older women’s perceptions of increase risk of complications after 
reconstruction with advancing age, and the feeling that the benefits of reconstruction do not 
outweigh the risks (13, 14). Regardless of the reason, it is apparent that more robust 
evidence evaluating the outcomes of breast reconstruction in older women is needed to 
improve this shared-decision making process (14).
While other studies have sought to determine the effects of advancing age on breast 
reconstruction outcomes, they have been largely retrospective in design (14–17) or focused 
on one type of reconstruction, either implant-based or autologous techniques (15, 18). For 
our current study, we sought to evaluate the effects of age on postoperative complications 
and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a large multicenter, prospective study of women 
who underwent breast reconstruction in the United States and Canada.

 funded project involves 57 plastic surgeons at 11 academic and private practice sites across 
the U.S. and Canada, including Michigan, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, 
Washington, D.C., Georgia, Texas, British Columbia, and Manitoba. The primary aim of the 
MROC Study is to compare patient outcomes among the common surgical options for breast 
reconstruction. All women 18 years or older presenting for first time breast reconstruction 
following mastectomy at MROC centers were eligible for enrollment into the MROC study. 
Participants included patients undergoing immediate or delayed, unilateral or bilateral 
reconstruction after mastectomies for breast cancer treatment or prophylaxis.
For this study, we analyzed data from patients enrolled in MROC from February 2012 to 
December 2015. We included any woman who completed implant-based or autologous 
reconstruction and had at least two-year follow-up from their reconstruction date. Due to 
limited numbers of patients in these cohorts, we excluded those who received latissimus 
dorsi with and without tissue expander/implant reconstructions; women who received a 
combination of implant and autologous-based techniques; crossover patients (i.e. those who 
changed their reconstructive technique during enrollment in the study); and mixed timing 
patients (i.e. those who received immediate reconstruction following mastectomy on one 
side and delayed reconstruction on the other side). Our analysis also excluded patients who 
did not complete the study’s preoperative surveys. For the analysis of PROs, we further 
excluded patients who experienced reconstructive failure, as no outcome data were collected 
from this group.
To evaluate the effects of age on outcomes following breast reconstruction, we divided 
patients into three cohorts: (1) younger women, defined as those < 45 years old, (2) middle-
aged women, defined as those 45–60 years old, and (3) older women, defined as those >60 
years old.
Two-year complication rates were compared among the three cohorts with the dependent 
variables of interest being any complication, major complication (i.e. complication requiring 
hospital readmission or surgical exploration), and reconstructive failure (i.e. removal of 
expander/implant or flap with or without subsequent replacement). With Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) approval at all centers, electronic 
medical records (EMRs) for each patient were reviewed by study coordinators 
preoperatively and at one and two years postoperatively to obtain demographic and clinical 
data. Complication data were collected from the EMRs at one and two years following 
reconstruction. All data were uploaded onto Velos (Velos Inc., Fremont, CA), a web-based 
clinical trial management system.
In addition to complication rates, we also evaluated PROs using the BREAST-Q 
Reconstructive Module. The BREAST-Q Reconstructive Module is a validated, condition-
specific PRO instrument that has been widely used to measure health-related satisfaction and 
quality of life in breast reconstruction patients (19, 20). The scales used in this study 
included satisfaction with breast, as well as psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being. 
For each scale, responses were summed on a 0–100 scale, with higher numbers reflecting 
better outcomes (i.e. higher satisfaction with breast, and greater psychosocial, physical, or 
sexual well-being). Study patients completed the web-based questionnaire pre-operatively,

 and at one and two years postoperatively. Of note, only two-year PRO data are presented 
here.
Clinical variables such as age, body mass index (Body Mass Index - BMI=kg/m2), and 
smoking status were collected. Medical comorbidities were recorded and the total number of 
comorbidity conditions were obtained (21). In addition to reconstructive variables such as 
procedure type (i.e. implant-based vs. autologous), laterality, and timing (i.e. immediate vs. 
delayed) of reconstruction, we also collected oncologic variables such as indication for 
mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy status, and lymph node management at the time of 
reconstruction. Indication for mastectomy was subdivided into cancer treatment or 
prophylaxis. Radiation status was divided into three groups: (1) history of radiation before 
reconstruction, (2) receipt of radiation during or after reconstruction, and (3) no radiation. 
Similarly, patients were subdivided into two groups with respect to their chemotherapy 
status: (1) receipt of chemotherapy during or after reconstruction and (2) no chemotherapy 
during or after reconstruction. Information regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not 
available. Finally, lymph node management at the time of reconstruction was categorized as: 
(1) sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), (2) axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), or (3) 
no lymph node removal.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics by age group were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or chi-square 
tests. Two-year postoperative complication rates and PROs were also summarized by age 
and procedure type. Mixed effects regression models were employed to further compare the 
outcomes of patients across age groups. For each model, we included two of the three age 
group cohorts as the primary predictor variables, with younger (i.e. <45 years old) women as 
the reference group. Additionally, interaction terms between age groups and procedure types 
were used to explore differential effects of age on the outcomes between patients who 
underwent implant-based versus autologous techniques. Independent variables with 
statistically significant effects in the univariate analysis (p-value of <0.05) and those 
variables known to be predictors of postoperative complications in breast reconstruction 
based on previous literature (i.e. BMI, laterality, and smoking status) were included in the 
regression models (22). For each model, we controlled for baseline covariates and included 
random intercepts for centers (hospitals) to account for between-center variability. Baseline 
and two-year PROs as well as certain covariates were missing for some patients. To account 
for such missing data, multiple imputation with chained equations were employed to create 
10 complete imputed data sets, each of which was used to run the regression models 
specified above. The results were then combined using Rubin’s rules (23). Statistical 
analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and statistical significance 
was set at 0.05.

Summary of Demographic Data
We identified a total of 1,531 women who underwent immediate or delayed, implant-based 
or autologous reconstruction between 2012 and 2014, and had at least two-year follow-up

 from their initial reconstruction date. Of these, 494 (32.3%) were younger (<45 years old), 
803 (52.5%) were middle-aged (45–60 years old), and 234 (15.3%) were older (>60 years 
old), all of whom were included for complication analysis. Among these 1,531 patients, 84 
experienced reconstructive failure at some point during the two-year postoperative period. A 
total of 1,447 patients were thus, included for PRO analysis.
Results of the bivariate analyses of demographic and clinical variables are summarized in 
Table 1. There were statistically significant differences in BMI and number of comorbidities 
across age groups. Additionally, indications for mastectomy, management of regional lymph 
nodes, as well as use of radiation treatment and chemotherapy differed significantly among 
the three age groups. Reconstructive variables such as procedure type (i.e. implant-based 
versus autologous), timing of reconstruction, and laterality also differed significantly across 
age cohorts. For example, while the majority of women in all age groups underwent 
immediate reconstruction, a higher proportion of older women received delayed 
reconstruction, as compared to the younger patients (11.1% versus 4.1%, respectively). 
Moreover, the majority of younger women (73.3%) underwent bilateral reconstruction, 
while the majority of older women (70.1%) received unilateral reconstruction. As potential 
confounders, these clinical, reconstructive, and oncologic variables were all included in the 
regression models.
Complications
Results of bivariate analyses for all complications, major complications, and reconstructive 
failures are described in Table 2. Within both implant and autologous tissue procedure types, 
there were no statistically significant differences across the age cohorts for these outcomes. 
However, overall complication rates were generally higher in women undergoing autologous 
reconstruction as compared to patients receiving implant-based techniques across all age 
groups, while two-year reconstruction failure rates were lower in autologous than implant 
procedures.
Similar findings were observed in our mixed-effects logistic regression models presented in 
Table 3. Controlling for covariates and between-center variability, we found that age was not 
a significant predictor of overall complications or major complications. Interaction between 
age group and procedure type (not shown here) was found to be insignificant, indicating that 
age effects on overall complications and major complications did not differ significantly for 
implant versus autologous tissue reconstructions. Due to the small numbers of reconstructive 
failures, we did not have sufficient power to evaluate the effects of age on this outcome. 
Finally, significant effects on overall and/or major complications were noted for many of the 
covariates in our analysis, including procedure type, BMI over 35, laterality, timing of 
reconstruction, current smoking status, and receipt of radiation (during or following 
reconstruction).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Mean scores for the four domains of BREAST-Q before reconstruction and at two-years 
post-reconstruction are presented in Table 4. Across all age groups, and irrespective of 
procedure type, patients reported improved satisfaction and psychosocial well-being two

 years after reconstruction. Sexual well-being also improved across all age groups 
undergoing autologous reconstructions. Older women who underwent implant-based 
procedures reported lower physical well-being after reconstruction while older women who 
underwent autologous reconstruction reported an improvement in physical well-being 
scores.
Results from the mixed-effects regression models for the four domains of the BREAST-Q 
Reconstructive module are summarized in Table 5. Two years after reconstruction, older 
women with implant procedure reported 4.25 (p=0.04) higher sexual well-being scores than 
younger women, while older autologous patients reported 10.39 (p<0.01) higher outcomes 
compared to younger patients. For both physical and psychosocial well-being, no age effect 
was observed within implant patients. However, older women who underwent autologous 
procedures reported 6.07 (p<.01) higher physical well-being scores, and 8.21 (p<.01) higher 
psychosocial well-being scores, compared to younger women. Older patients receiving 
implant-based procedures reported 5.05 (p=0.025) lower satisfaction scores than younger 
patients. On the other hand, both older and younger autologous patients reported comparable 
satisfaction two years after reconstruction. We present adjusted means (i.e., estimated 
population marginal means) to illustrate the differential age effects between two procedure 
types described above in Figure 1. Other clinical variables that had significant effects on 
patient satisfaction with breast, and psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being are 
summarized in Table 5.
Discussion
Although over 40 percent of new female breast cancer diagnoses are made in older women 
(1), they are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction than their younger counterparts (7–
9, 11, 16). Reasons behind this disparity are multifaceted and largely unknown. What we do 
know is that while breast reconstruction decision-making is a complex process for patients 
of all ages, this may be particularly true for older women, who may be more risk-averse or 
may have health issues that impact their choices. Older women considering post-mastectomy 
breast reconstruction and their providers must weigh the risk of post-reconstruction 
complications against the potential quality of life benefits. Unfortunately, while other studies 
have attempted to provide comprehensive information on outcomes, evidence is still 
currently lacking. This knowledge gap may be responsible, in part, to the relatively lower 
utilization rates of breast reconstruction in women over 60 years old.
Analyses of age effects on breast reconstruction complication rates have yielded mixed 
results. For example, in two studies from Fischer and coworkers (24, 25) utilizing the 
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to 
evaluate complication rates following immediate breast reconstruction, advancing age was 
not a predictor of post-reconstruction complications. However, in other studies employing 
similar study designs, older age (variously defined as 45 years or above, over 50 years, or 
greater than 55 years), conferred an increased risk of complication rates, compared with 
younger age groups (18, 26, 27). While these studies were adequately powered, they were 
limited only to complications following immediate reconstruction, and were not designed to 
specifically evaluate the impact of advancing age on post-reconstruction complication rates.

 In a larger analysis, Butz and coworkers (16) recently reported findings from the ACS-
NSQIP database examining the role of advancing age on complications following immediate 
implant-based and autologous techniques. Among the 40,769 patients in their cohort, 
complication rates between younger (less than 65 years old) and older (65 years or above) 
women who underwent immediate implant-based reconstruction did not differ significantly. 
However, older women undergoing autologous reconstruction were more likely to develop 
venous thromboembolism. This study, like the others mentioned, only evaluated outcomes 
following immediate reconstruction and had limited follow-up of 30 days post-
reconstruction. Furthermore, none of these studies included PRO assessments, since they 
were designed as retrospective analyses of large administrative databases.
Results from studies evaluating PROs in older women undergoing breast reconstruction are 
more consistent in their findings, demonstrating that older women achieve similar or even 
higher levels of satisfaction than younger women post-reconstruction (14, 15, 28, 29). For 
example, Sisco and coworkers (29) conducted a prospective cohort study of 315 patients 
undergoing immediate reconstruction and found that patients over 65 years of age achieved 
similar quality of life scores to younger patients. Similarly, Johnson and colleagues (28) 
found that women 65 years or older reported similar physical and upper body well-being 
scores, compared with younger women. Moreover, in a study of 1,751 patients who 
underwent autologous reconstruction, patients over 65 years and younger women achieved 
similar high levels of satisfaction (15). However, these studies did not include any 
complication data. In a more comprehensive design, the current analysis used prospectively 
collected data from 11 centers across North America to evaluate the impact of age on 
postoperative complication rates as well as PROs across different procedure types.
Our results confirm previous findings that advancing age is not a predictor of complications 
following breast reconstruction (15, 17, 30). However, we did observe significant age-related 
differences in some of the PRO measures; while older women reported greater sexual well-
being than younger women, patients over 60 years were less satisfied with their 
reconstruction than their younger counterparts. These age-related differences in satisfaction 
may vary by procedure type: Older women who opted for autologous reconstruction 
reported significantly higher satisfaction than women of the same age undergoing implant-
based techniques. This finding may be attributable to the ability of autologous techniques to 
obtain superior symmetry with a ptotic contralateral breast, compared with implant-based 
reconstructions (12, 15, 31). While reconstructive surgeons may avoid autologous 
reconstruction in older women due to concerns over longer anesthetic times, our results 
indicate that autologous procedures may be viable options in older patients, given that 
advancing age is not associated with greater risks and that autologous reconstruction in this 
population still achieves high levels of satisfaction and physical well-being.
The strengths of the current study include its multicenter design, use of prospectively 
collected data, inclusion of implant and autologous procedures, and focus on both 
complications as well as PROs. However, limitations remain. Firstly, because this was not a 
randomized controlled trial, there are certainly other potential cofounders that we could not 
control for in our analysis. However, it is not possible to randomize across age. Secondly, 
these findings may not be generalizable to all patients across all centers; the vast majority of

 MROC sites are academic centers, so our conclusions may not apply to all patients treated at 
all facilities. Additionally, while we had two-year follow-up for our patients, longer follow-
up is still necessary to evaluate late complications, such as capsular contracture, as they may 
adversely affect long-term patient satisfaction and quality of life.
Conclusions
Despite previous concerns among some surgeons over the potential risks of post-mastectomy 
reconstruction in older women, it appears that age does not significantly affect complication 
rates. Furthermore, older patients appear to enjoy many of the same quality of life benefits of 
reconstruction as do younger women. For older patients considering breast reconstruction 
and for surgeons performing these procedures, the study findings confirm that reconstruction 
is a viable option, with risks and benefits comparable to those reported in younger women.
