Abstract
To date there are no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease
(EVD). Based on our in vitro evidence of antiviral activity of interferon (IFN)-ß activity against
Ebola virus, we conducted a single arm clinical study in Guinea to evaluate the safety and
therapeutic efficacy of IFN β-1a treatment for EVD. Nine individuals infected with Ebola
virus were treated with IFN β-1a and compared retrospectively with a matched cohort of 21
infected patients receiving standardized supportive care only during the same time period at
the same treatment unit. Cognizant of the limitations of having treated only 9 individuals with
EVD, the data collected are cautiously considered. When compared to supportive care only,
IFN β-1a treatment seemed to facilitate viral clearance from the blood and appeared associ-
ated with earlier resolution of disease symptoms. Survival, calculated from the date of con-
sent for those in the trial and date of admission from those in the control cohort, to the date
of death, was 19% for those receiving supportive care only, compared to 67% for those
receiving supportive care plus IFN β-1a. Given the differences in baseline blood viremia
between the control cohort and the IFN-treated cohort, an additional 17 controls were
included for a subset analysis, from other treatment units in Guinea, matched with the IFN-
treated patients based on age and baseline blood viremia. Subset analyses using this
expanded control cohort suggests that patients without IFN β-1a treatment were ~ 1.5–1.9
fold more likely to die than those treated. Viewed altogether the results suggest a rationale
for further clinical evaluation of IFN β-1a.

 Introduction
Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the filovirus family, causes severe, frequently lethal
infections in humans and primates [1]. Since December 2013 the outbreak of Ebola virus dis-
ease (EVD) in West Africa has claimed 11,314 lives of the 28,630 confirmed cases. Clinical
symptoms at onset of EVD include headache, fever, asthenia, arthralgia and myalgia. Gastroin-
testinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea develop, leading
to an electrolyte imbalance associated with intravascular volume depletion. Indeed, EVD is
associated with profound endothelial dysfunction leading to fluid shifts that may result in car-
diovascular collapse and renal failure [2,3]. Notably, the overall fatality rates differed in the 3
countries with the greatest number of confirmed cases: 67% in Guinea, 45% in Liberia and
28% in Sierra Leone [4]. Variables such as extent of viremia, time to onset of supportive care,
and the level of supportive care, contributed to the case fatality ratio [5]. In the absence of any
approved treatments, the high case fatality ratio prompted the consideration of potential treat-
ment options, including the repurposing of approved drugs.
The type I interferons (IFNs) IFN-α and IFN-β, exhibit broad spectrum antiviral activity,
with demonstrated clinical effectiveness against HBV, HCV, influenza A viruses and the
SARS-CoV [6]. IFN-α/β production occurs as the earliest non-specific response to viral infec-
tion, directly inhibiting viral infection and activating the innate and adaptive immune
responses to clear virus. Indeed, viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies specifically
targeted against the type I IFN response, confirming the importance of IFNs as antivirals. This
immune evasion strategy is particularly relevant when one considers IFN and EBOV infection.
Experimental data indicate that the EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35 inhibit host cell systems
that lead to type I IFN production and also inhibit events associated with an IFN response [7–
9]. Accordingly, early post-exposure treatment with type I IFN might override these inhibitory
effects of EBOV. IFN β-1a therapy has been shown to prolong survival in a rhesus macaque
model of lethal EVD [10] and IFN-α2b treatment reduced viremia and extended the time to
death in a similar cynomolgus model of lethal EVD [11]. A combination of monoclonal anti-
bodies targeted against EBOV (ZMAb) protects macaques from lethal EVD, with decreasing
efficacy if treatment is delayed to 2 days post-infection [12]. Addition of an adenovirus
expressed vectored IFN-α to ZMAb extended the treatment window and improved protection
[12]. Moreover, in mice and guinea pigs, using this replication-deficient human adenovirus
expressing recombinant IFN-α alone, post-exposure treatment elicited full protection from
lethal doses of the mouse- and guinea pig- adapted EBOV [13]. Notably, examination of serum
samples from infected individuals during the 2000 outbreak of Sudan EBOV in Uganda
revealed that surviving patients had significantly higher levels of IFN-α within the first few
days of the onset of critical illness [14].
Viewed altogether, these studies prompted our evaluation of IFN treatment for EVD. In
studies using transcription competent virus-like particles and infectious eGFP-Ebola virus, we
provided evidence that IFN-α/ß limit Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in vitro, and showed that
IFN ß-1a exhibits superior antiviral potency compared with IFN-α [15]. These findings pro-
vided the basis for this single arm proof-of-concept pilot study to evaluate the safety and effi-
cacy of IFN-β treatment for EVD. This study was undertaken in an ETU close to Coyah,
Guinea, during the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak. While a placebo-controlled study was not per-
mitted by the Guinean Health Authorities due to ethical concerns, laboratory and clinical data
from EBOV-infected individuals who received only supportive care at the same treatment cen-
ter and during the same period as those who received IFN β-1a was available for comparison.
We provide preliminary evidence supporting further evaluation of IFN β-1a in any subsequent
outbreak.

 Materials and methods
Study design
Given (i) the urgent need to introduce drugs that would reduce mortality of EVD, (ii) the lim-
ited data on the clinical and biochemical parameters associated with EVD and (iii) the limited
care provisions available in the treatment units during the outbreak, the study design focused
on the objective endpoints of reduction in blood viremia, resolution of clinical symptoms,
improvement in survival and safety of IFN β-1a treatment.
Study protocol & informed consent
The study protocol (English version;) is provided as Supplementary Materials. Approvals were
obtained from the Guinean Ministry of Health (#0777/CNRE; Dr. Sakoba Keita) (February 29,
2015), the CNERS, Guinea (016/CNERS/15; Prof. Oumou Younoussa Sow) (February
16,2015) and the Ebola Research Commission, National Public Health Institute, Guinea (Dr.
Lamine Koivogui) (December 12, 2014). Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients who received IFN β-1a treatment.
Trial registration
ISRCTN 17414946. This trial registration was delayed. The Guinean Health Ministry regis-
tered the trial as #0777/CNRE on February 29, 2015.
Patient selection
The initial study population involved patients who were admitted to the Ebola Treatment Unit
(ETU) in a rural area close to the town of Coyah, in west Guinea, during the period March 26,
2015 –June 12, 2015. Inclusion (eligibility) criteria for IFN β-1a therapy were (1) symptom
onset within 6 days, (2) Blood RT-PCR-confirmed positive for EBOV, (3) patient/designate
informed consent for use of IFN β-1a. Exclusion criteria included (1) symptom onset more
than 6 days prior to admission, (2) age < 17 or >70 years, (3) contra-indication to use of IFN
β-1a or any of the constituents of the drug product. Recruitment of patients was difficult in the
declining outbreak, limiting this proof-of-concept study to a pilot study. Nine patients met the
inclusion criteria for IFN β-1a treatment. A cohort of historical controls of 28 patients was
available for comparison with the treated patients. 7 patients of this cohort were excluded: 4
were younger than 17 years of age, 2 had onset of symptoms more than 6 days before admis-
sion and 1 was older than 70 years of age. The 21 control patients were admitted to the Coyah
ETU during the same time period as the IFN β-1a treated patients, with RT-PCR-confirmed
blood EBOV (Table 1). We also included an additional 17 patients who matched the IFN-
treated patients for eligibility criteria based on � 6 days from symptom onset, age, and under
care in a Guinean treatment centre, who were better matched for baseline CT values. Since no
data were available to us on serial CT values for these additional patients, vital status only
(alive or dead) was used as the outcome.
Treatment protocol
Eligible patients were administered IFN β-1a (0.5 mL liquid formulated AVONEX drug prod-
uct, Biogen) subcutaneously daily. Refer to Table 2 for dosing schedules. Each 0.5mL con-
tained 30μg (6 x 106 IU) of IFN β-1a. All patients treated with IFN β-1a and all historic
controls received supportive care as was available in this resource constrained setting, as needs
demanded, comprising: rehydration solution (oral), Ringer’s lactate solution (perfused), iso-
tonic salt /glucose solutions (perfused), pain and fever medication: Novalgin (iv), Paracetamol

 (oral), Antalgin (oral) orTramadol (oral), Plumpy’Nut therapeutic diet (oral), vitamin B com-
plex (perfused), vitamin C (iv / perfused), Cimetidine (iv), Omeprazol (oral) or iv metoclopra-
mide (to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux), Vogalene (iv) (to treat symptom of
nausea and vomiting), Cimetidine (iv) (inhibits stomach acid production), Dycinone (iv) (an
antihemorrhagic), cephalosporin antibiotics Cefixime (oral) and Ceftriaxone (iv), antibiotic
Metronidazole (perfused) and the anti-malarial Coartem (oral) (Refer to S1 Excel File for
details of supportive care provided to IFN-treated patients). Notably, all historic controls
received similar supportive care as IFN-treated patients. Pain and fever were managed on a
case by case basis, as were gastrointestinal issues, nutritional requirements, co-infections and
hemorrhagic occurrences. Of importance is that each patient that we report on, whether a par-
ticipant in the IFN treatment clinical study, or a historic control, received supportive care as
outlined.
Patients were discharged on resolution of clinical symptoms and following 2 consecutive
negative blood RT-PCR results for viremia (� CT value of 40), 48 hours apart, as per WHO
guidelines [16].
Adverse events, reporting and management
Please refer to the Study S1 Protocol. Briefly, adverse events as have been reported are
described in the product monograph for AVONEX. The study protocol indicated dose adjust-
ment or withdrawl for severe adverse events (worsening and severe clinical symptoms

 associated with EVD (including persistently elevated AST and ALT) and/or resolution of dis-
ease (CT value � 40).
Laboratory studies
Laboratory investigations included serial blood RT-PCR analyses for EBOV and biochemical
assays. Blood draws into EDTA tubes were immediately processed for determination of vire-
mia. EVD diagnosis was made using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay (RealStar Filovirus
Screen RT-PCR kit 1.0, altona Diagnostics, GmbH). Measurements are expressed as CT values
(cycle threshold), inversely proportional to viral load. The CT value for ebola virus positivity
was � 40.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics and treatment of the control and IFN β-1a treated groups are presented
as medians, ranges or numbers and percentages for all clinical parameters, biochemistry values
and symptoms. The comparison between the two cohorts was performed utilizing either the
Mann-Whitney test for the continuous variables (e.g. CT values) or the Fischer exact test for
the categorical variables. Survival percentages and plots were based on Kaplan-Meier esti-
mates. The survival curves were compared using the log-rank test (p-value shown). The IFN β-
1a treatment as well as the CT value (as continuous) were also tested using the Wald test within
the Cox proportional hazards model. The effect of IFN β-1a treatment was tested adjusting the
model for the CT value. The assumptions of proportionality of hazards and linearity (for CT
value) were inspected and no departure was found. The rate of change over time for CT values
and fever as well as the differences for these rates between the IFN β-1a treatment and the con-
trol cohort were tested utilizing the mixed effect modeling. This type of modeling can account
for the possible correlations between observations belonging to the same individual. On
inspection of the residuals no departure from normality was observed.
The difference in the change of symptoms over time between the treatment group and con-
trols was investigated using general estimating equation (gee) models with the logit link (spe-
cific to binary outcome). The presence of a symptom was the outcome and the treatment, day
and their interaction were the covariates. The interaction term measures the difference in the
rate of change of the symptom occurrence between the two groups (controls vs IFN β-1a
treated). The interaction p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons utilizing Hochberg
approach [17]. Analysis was performed using R-3.2.2. The packages needed for this analysis
were gee and NIME.
Results
Refer to Fig 1. The initial study population included 19 females and 11 males, aged 18 to 70
years at the Coyah Treatment Unit, Guinea. EBOV was confirmed in all study participants
using blood RT-PCR. It is important to note that while IFN β-1a was available as a treatment
option, EBOV-infected individuals and/or their designate had the right to refuse IFN β-1a
treatment, which 4 did. The IFN β-1a treatment and control groups did not differ in age, sex
or day of admission relative to symptom onset (Table 1). Elevated alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRE) and C reactive protein (CRP) lev-
els were consistent features of EVD in all study participants. Of the 9 patients treated with IFN
β-1a, 5 started IFN treatment on day 3 post-symptom onset, 1 on day 4 post-symptom onset,
one on day 5 post-symptom onset and one on day 6 post-symptom onset. One patient started
treatment the next day following admission to the treatment unit based on being a high risk
contact who was asymptomatic, but was PCR positive. Given the elevated ALT, AST and CRE

 levels in all patients with EVD, we were unable to determine whether IFN β-1a treatment nega-
tively affected these biochemical blood measurements. 1 patient (Table 2, #4) with a PCR nega-
tive result received a dose reduction (3 x106 IU), related to elevated AST and ALT levels, and
had a second 2 consecutive PCR negative result on this reduced dose. Another patient (#5)
received a dose reduction (3x106 IU) because of rapid resolution of clinical symptoms and a
coincident first negative PCR result. This patient also had a consecutive PCR negative result
on the reduced IFN β-1a dose. 1 patient had treatment discontinued because of severe clinical

 symptoms and subsequently died. 2 patients received treatment beyond 10 days, until they
became PCR negative (Table 2). 3 of the 9 patients who received IFN β-1a died. Notably, ALT,
AST and CRE were significantly elevated in all 3 patients who died, despite one patient (#7)
exhibiting reduction in blood viremia from a CT value of 20.1 at start of IFN β-1a treatment,
to a CT value of 38 on day 10, when the patient succumbed to disease (Table 2).
The data in Fig 2 show survival percentages for the control (19% at 21 days) and IFN β-1a
treated patients (67% at 21 days, log-rank p = 0.026). The hazards ratio (HR) for the treatment
when alone in the model is 0.27, 95%CI:0.08–0.94, p = 0.039 (Wald test). This analysis suggests
that the treatment is beneficial to the patients with a HR of 0.27 (those untreated are approxi-
mately 3.7-times more likely to die). Age and sex did not affect survival. The HR for the CT
values, as continuous, when alone in the model, for the untreated control cohort is 0.8, 95%
CI:0.62–0.97, p = 0.0234. These results indicate that CT values have a prognostic effect, with
larger values being associated with better survival. For each unit decrease of CT, the risk of
death increases 1.25 fold. When the model is adjusted for CT values, the effect of the treatment
becomes weaker (HR = 0.79) and for CT slightly stronger (HR = 0.76 for each unit of CT value
increase). This analysis suggests that for the same CT values the risk of dying for the untreated
is 1.26 fold compared to the IFN treated group, and each unit decrease in CT value will
increase the risk of dying by 1.31 fold. For a CT value of 19 (median for CT) the probability of
dying for those untreated was 1.35 fold larger than for those treated. Due to the smaller num-
ber of deaths in this cohort, it is not possible to adjust the model for more covariates.
Given that a recent analysis of baseline CT values supports our findings of their prognostic
effect [18], we extended our analysis for treatment effect on survival as the outcome, using an
expanded cohort of untreated and infected patients. We included an additional 17 patients

Survival was calculated from the date of consent for those receiving IFN β-1a treatment and date of admission
for those in the control cohort, to the date of death. Survival plots were based on Kaplan-Meier estimates and
the plots were compared using the log rank test (p = 0.026).

 who matched the IFN-treated patients for eligibility criteria based on � 6 days from symptom
onset, age, and under care in a Guinean treatment centre, who were better matched for base-
line CT values. Notably, these patients were never approached to participate in the IFN β-1a
treatment trial. Since no data were available to us on serial CT values for these additional
patients, we only used vital status (alive or dead) as the outcome. Three logistic regression anal-
yses were performed: (i) An analysis in which all patients were included: 9 IFN-treated and 38
controls. The results suggest that the treatment is significant even when the model is adjusted
for CT value. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 7.54 fold more likely
than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the
probability of dying for those untreated was 1.89 fold larger than for those treated (S1 Table)
(ii) An analysis in which patients older than 50 years (which is the maximum age in the IFN-
treated group) and with baseline CT values <16 or >31 (the range of values for the IFN-
treated group) were excluded. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 6.39
fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20
(median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.81 fold larger than for those
treated (S2 Table). (iii) A matched analysis. Each patient from the IFN-treated group was
matched to a group of patients in the control group such that the age difference was not larger
than 5 years and the CT difference was not larger than 2. For 5 patients suitable matches were
found: For IFN 02 one match, for IFN 03 one match, for IFN 04 three matches, for IFN 08 two
matches and for IFN 10 three matches. For IFN 05, IFN 06, IFN 07 and IFN 09 no matches
were found and they did not enter this analysis. The effect of the treatment based on the condi-
tional logistic regression is significant (OR = 0.17, p = 0.012). The patients without treatment
had an odds ratio of dying 6.0 fold more likely than those treated. The probability of dying for
those untreated was 1.5 fold larger than for those treated (S3 Table).
Next, the rate of viral clearance from blood was evaluated, using the original 21 control
cohort, for whom we had serial data (Fig 3). To remove bias associated with CT values from
patients who succumbed to disease, i.e. did not clear virus, this analysis was performed only on
patients who were alive at the end of the study, i.e. cleared virus. We observe a trend of faster
clearance in the IFN β-1a treated patients compared with the controls (Fig 3, inset). The CT
values increase by 1.53 units/day in the controls and by 1.62 units/day for the IFN treated
patients. The difference (0.19) is not statistically significant (p = 0.36).
Patient symptoms were recorded in the morning, afternoon and evening over time for
all study participants. Refer to Table 3. Frequency and number of clinical symptoms are
described in S4 Table. Overall, the data in Table 3 indicate that IFN β-1a treatment led to ear-
lier resolution of many clinical symptoms, including those associated with the gastrointesti-
nal dysfunction of EVD, namely abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. In the context of
fever, temperature values fluctuated between 34˚ and 40.5˚ among all study participants
(data not shown). Fever did not decrease differently between the two groups, with the inter-
action p-value s = 0.069, 0.63, 0.82, for the morning, afternoon and evening, respectively.
Overall, in both groups fever seemed to decrease by a small amount in the afternoon (0.07˚C,
p<0.001). No statistically significant decrease was observed in the two groups for the temper-
atures taken in the morning or evening (p = 0.069 and p = 0.93, respectively). Pulse taken in
the afternoon decreased by 0.6 per day in the control cohort (p = 0.19) and increased by 1.1
per day in the IFN β-1a treated group (p = 0.0042). The difference between these rates (inter-
action term) was statistically significant (p = 0.0053). The rate of change for the morning or
evening pulse did not change significantly between the two groups over time (p = 0.33 and
0.19, respectively). Similarly, the rate of change for systolic blood pressure was not different
between groups (p = 0.37 for morning, p = 0.92 for afternoon and p = 0.49 for the evening
measure).

 Discussion
These preliminary findings, cautiously interpreted, suggest that treatment with IFN β-1a may
be associated with clearance of virus from blood, better clinical features and potentially,
improved survival (summarized in S1 CONSORT Checklist). As the case fatality ratio for EVD
is associated with level of blood viremia, the findings reported herein do need to be interpreted
cautiously, given the difference in CT values between the controls and IFN β-1a treated
patients and the limited sample size. Despite the limitations of a single arm, non-randomized
study, we infer from these data that IFN β-1a treatment is worthy of further consideration for
the treatment of EVD.
At the start of the outbreak, and over the ensuing months, there was considerable skepti-
cism about the potential therapeutic effectiveness of type I IFNs. Our strategy at the outset was
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN treatment, hence the decision to use a non-pegylated
version of IFN with a short half-life, that could be discontinued or dose-reduced, with rapid
clearance, to address potential concerns of adverse events. Moreover, extensive clinical experi-
ence with IFN-α and IFN-β prepared us for potential adverse outcomes and solutions to these.
The decision to undertake this trial was based on preliminary scientific pre-clinical data and,
perhaps most pertinently, the absence of any approved antivirals to treat EVD. Availability and
cold storage were not issues, unlike other experimental antivirals that were considered during
the recent outbreak.
A unique aspect of this trial was that the onsite team was comprised exclusively of 11 Guin-
ean nationals. Healthcare workers received, for their first time, relevant training in all opera-
tional and administrative aspects of conducting a trial. There is now in place in Guinea a team

Data were analyzed utilizing the gee model with logit link. i.e. a logistic regression was applied with the symptom (as binary) as the dependent variable and
the treatment and time as covariates. Since there is more than one observation for each patient, the model also considered the possible correlations among
the specified observation for the same patient (hence gee rather than a simple logistic model). The columns contain: the effect in the control arm, the effect
in the IFN β-1a treated arm, and represent how the symptoms changed over time. If the OR was >1, then the frequency of the symptom increased over time,
while if the OR was <1, the frequency of the symptom decreased over time. The last column contains the p-values when the OR for the historic controls was
compared to the OR for the IFN-treated patients. These p-values indicate whether the changes in the symptom frequency over time differ between the two
arms.
The highlighted values are significant after adjusting for multiplicity with the Hochberg’s approach. Breakdown of symptoms by time and treatment are
provided in S4 Table.

 of 11 individuals, including MDs and administrative staff, who have the ability and competen-
cies to conduct a clinical trial according to international standards.
Although the current outbreak of EVD in West Africa was declared over on January 14,
2016 by the WHO, a new case was reported in Sierra Leone in the ensuing days with identified
contacts at risk of developing EVD. Therefore, there continues to exist the possibility of resur-
gence of EVD or emergence of a divergent strain [19]. Certainly, vaccines offer the potential to
protect populations from a resurgent EBOV strain identical to that reflected in the current vac-
cines under evaluation, yet it remains unclear whether these vaccines offer post-exposure pro-
tection or what the duration of protection is prior to exposure. Accordingly, the need exists for
antivirals that provide a broader spectrum of activity against different EBOV strains. Viewed
altogether, the data support further evaluation of IFN β-1a for the treatment of EVD.

Symptoms recorded am, pm and e (evening), as indicated. With reference to asthenia pm
(highlighted in grey), this symptom remained relatively unchanged over the 3 time periods
examined among the historic controls receiving supporting care only (54%, 74%, 56%), and
the p-value is not significant (p = 0.47). For the IFN ß-1a treated patients, the incidence of
asthenia (pm) decreases over the 3 time periods (69%, 43%, 8%) with the OR in this arm of
0.65 and p<0.0001. Comparing the OR between historic controls and IFN-treated, the OR in
the control arm is 1.65 fold larger than the OR in the IFN-treated arm, hence the significance
recorded in the last column in Table 3.
