Background: In 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) surpassed
heroin and prescription opioid deaths in the United States for the first time, with IMF-involved overdose deaths
increasing more than 500% across 10 states from 2013 to 2016. IMF is an extremely potent synthetic opioid that
is regularly mixed with heroin and often sold to unwitting consumers. Community-based organizations have
started to distribute fentanyl test strips (FTS) as a strategy to identify IMF in street purchased products. We
investigated the association between FTS use and changes in drug use behavior and perceived overdose safety
among a community-based sample of people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States.
Methods: Between September-October 2017, a total of 125 PWID completed an online survey about their most
recent FTS use in Greensboro, North Carolina. Our first outcome of interest included whether PWID engaged in
any of the following changes in drug use behavior after using FTS: used less than usual, administered tester shot,
pushed syringe plunger slower than usual, and snorted instead of injected. Our second outcome of interest was
whether PWID felt that FTS use made them feel better able to protect themselves from overdose. We conducted
bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the association between FTS use and these two outcomes.
Results: Overall, 63% of the sample reported a positive FTS test result and 81% reported using FTS prior to
consuming their drugs. For the outcomes, 43% reported a change in drug use behavior and 77% indicated
increased perceived overdose safety by using FTS. In multivariable models adjusting for demographic and FTS
correlates, PWID with a positive FTS test result had five times the odds of reporting changes in drug use behavior
compared to those with a negative result. PWID who used the FTS after drug consumption were 70% less likely
to report behavioral changes at subsequent drug consumption compared to those who used it before con-
sumption. PWID who were not existing clients of the syringe services program had four times higher odds than
existing clients to report increased overdose safety from using FTS.
Conclusions: We found that using FTS and receiving a positive test result was associated with changes in drug use
behavior and perceptions of overdose safety. FTS may represent an effective addition to current overdose pre-
vention efforts when included with other evidence-based strategies to prevent opioid overdose and related harm.
Introduction
The opioid overdose crisis in the United States continues to generate
unprecedented levels of mortality. Over 63,000 people died from a drug
overdose in 2016, with more than 60% of deaths involving an opioid
(Hedegaard et al., 2017). In 2016, the number of overdose deaths in-
volving illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) surpassed the number of
heroin-involved deaths and prescription opioid-involved deaths for the
first time, with IMF-involved overdose deaths increasing more than
500% across 10 states from 2013 to 2016 (O’Donnell, Halpin, Mattson,
Goldberger, & Gladden, 2017). A recent report published by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detected IMF in 56% of
opioid overdose deaths (O’Donnell, Halpin, et al., 2017), with the
highest burden in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the country and
rising trends identified in the South and West (Peterson et al., 2016;
Tomassoni et al., 2017). Postmortem toxicological reports from opioid
overdose decedents have identified new polydrug combinations (e.g.,
alprazolam + gabapentin + IMF) that suggest the emergence of high-

 risk consumption patterns and complex clinical presentations (Dragovic
et al., 2016; Marinetti & Ehlers, 2014).
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent by weight than
heroin, with a rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of
effect. The vast majority of fentanyl overdose deaths since 2013 involve
IMF, not diverted prescription fentanyl. Manufactured in clandestine
labs outside of the U.S., IMF typically enters the country alongside
heroin and other illicit drugs through illicit channels before being sold
by
itself
or
used
to
adulterate
heroin
(Drug
Enforcement
Administration, 2017a). IMF includes fentanyl analogs (e.g., carfen-
tanil) that may be purchased on the internet and shipped through in-
ternational postal services before being distributed throughout regional
drug markets in the U.S. (Frank & Pollack, 2017). IMF has also been
pressed into counterfeit prescription drugs, with fake versions of Oxy-
Contin, Percodan, and Xanax linked to overdose outbreaks in several
states (Green & Gilbert, 2016). In addition, IMF has been found on il-
lustrated blotter paper commonly associated with paper tablets of ly-
sergic acid diethylamide (LSD; Drug Enforcement Administration,
2015).
National estimates from the Drug Enforcement Administration show
law enforcement seizures of IMF have increased substantially, from
4,697 reports in 2014 to 14,400 in 2015 (O’Donnell, Gladden, & Seth,
2017). This rapid growth in supply has led to increased saturation of
IMF in existing and emerging heroin markets while exacerbating the
opioid overdose risk environment by introducing a new level of diffi-
culty for consumers as they try to parse out different “heroin” types and
discern IMF from heroin (Somerville et al., 2017; Marshall et al., 2017).
Due to a heightened risk environment and the urgent need to prevent
and treat opioid overdose, several public health strategies established
by harm reduction organizations have been implemented in high-
burden communities throughout the U.S., including overdose education
and naloxone distribution (OEND) programs and Good Samaritan Laws
(Lambdin et al., 2018; McClellan et al., 2018; Strang et al., 2012;
Walley et al., 2013).
Most recently, fentanyl test strip (FTS) technology has emerged as a
drug checking strategy to address the fentanyl crisis. FTS was originally
developed as a field immunoassay to screen for the presence of fentanyl
in urine, but harm reduction organizations discovered that FTS can also
detect fentanyl in illicit drug solutions. This realization has led many
harm reduction organizations to distribute FTS to people who consume
street opioids as an off-label approach to test street drugs for fentanyl
(Harm Reduction Coalition, 2018). One type of FTS technology com-
monly distributed by harm reductions organizations is manufactured by
BTNX, Inc., a Canadian biotechnology company that specializes in drug
testing research and development.
A recent report compared BTNX’s FTS technology with both Raman
Spectroscopy (TruNarc machine) and Fourier-transform infrared spec-
troscopy (Bruker Alpha machine) to determine FTS’s effectiveness for
detecting fentanyl’s presence (sensitivity) and absence (specificity) in
street drug products (Johns Hopkins University, 2018). Among the
three technologies, BTNX’s FTS performed the best with the lowest
detection limit (0.13 mcg/ml) and highest sensitivity (96% and 100%)
and specificity (90% and 98%) for fentanyl, in addition to detecting 4-
out-of-4 fentanyl analogs (two cases involving acetyl fentanyl and two
cases involving furanyl fentanyl). These findings suggest that BTNX’s
FTS technology is effective and can be used off-label to detect the
presence of fentanyl and several fentanyl analogs in street drug pro-
ducts.
Numerous international studies have demonstrated the utility of
drug checking services for consumers of illicit drugs (Butterfield et al.,
2016;
Decorte,
2001;
Giné
et
al.,
2017;
Harper
et
al.,
2017;
Hungerbuehler et al., 2011), especially MDMA testing among club and
rave culture (Barratt et al., 2018; Mounteney et al., 2016; Saleemi et al.,
2017). A recent study in Rhode Island among young (aged 18–35 years)
people who use drugs showed high levels (> 90%) of willingness to use
FTS (Krieger et al., 2018). Comparably less is known about whether FTS
use can help facilitate safer drug use behavior and protect against
overdose for this population (Prekupec et al., 2017).
The current study investigated behavioral outcomes associated with
the off-label use of FTS among a community-based sample of people
who inject drugs (PWID). The study was conducted at a harm reduction
organization in the southeastern United States that recently started
distributing FTS as part of their overdose prevention efforts. Our pri-
mary objective was to determine the influence of FTS results on drug
use behavior and perceptions of overdose safety. Based on existing lit-
erature and our collective fieldwork experience, we hypothesized that
PWID who received a positive FTS result would be more likely to
change their drug use behavior than those who received a negative
result.
Methods
Study sample
We administered anonymous online surveys to PWID in Greensboro,
North Carolina to examine the association among self-reported FTS
results and behaviors and attitudes. The study was conducted in
September and October 2017 in collaboration with the Urban Survivors
Union (USU), a community-based organization that provides syringe
services and OEND programs to PWID. Study recruitment began on
International Overdose Awareness Day (August 31, 2017) to publicize
the study and maximize enrollment. Initial recruitment involved direct
intercept with people receiving services at USU. Informational flyers
were also posted at USU and made available for people to disseminate
amongst their social networks. PWID interested in study participation
visited USU’s fixed site where they were referred to study staff for in-
structions on determining eligibility for the study. Eligibility criteria
included being aged 18 years or older, having injected illicit opioids
within the past 24 hours, and reporting having ever used FTS to test
street drugs.
In the Spring of 2017, USU began distributing BTNX Inc.’s Rapid
Response Fentanyl Test Strips as part of their overdose prevention
strategy. BTNX FTS is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay that
qualitatively detects the presence or absence of fentanyl and fentanyl
analogs in urine but does not assess concentration levels. Positive and
negative results are signified by single and double red lines, respec-
tively (Fig. 1). USU offered FTS to program participants in combination
with naloxone and overdose education literature, which included di-
rections for how to use the FTS and a directive to use the strips prior to
drug consumption (Asher, 2018; Harm Reduction Coalition, 2018).
Data collection occurred on computers made available at USU’s SSP
in
Greensboro
using
a
secured
online
data
collection
platform
(SurveyGizmo, Boulder, Colorado). To ensure both anonymity and
prevent duplicate responses, we implemented a quality control me-
chanism that used existing program participants’ anonymous program
identifiers as their study identification (ID). Study participants who
were not already enrolled at USU were assigned a randomly-generated,
unique identifier as their study ID. After respondents confirmed their
eligibility and provided informed consent, they proceeded to a 20-
minute online survey that asked about their most recent FTS use. Upon
survey completion and verification by study staff, respondents were
provided a $20 Visa gift card as remuneration. The study protocol was
approved through a full review by the institutional review board at RTI
International.
Survey measures
Data were collected using an online survey instrument pertaining to
social and demographic characteristics, including age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, marital status, living situation, health insurance
status, employment status, and quality of life. In addition, access to
transportation was added based upon its identification as one of six key

 variables for rural program access in a recent vulnerability assessment
published by the CDC (Van Handel et al., 2016). FTS correlates in-
cluded ever experiencing an opioid overdose, previous experience with
naloxone (e.g., ever administered naloxone during overdose, received
naloxone training), SSP utilization, purposively seeking fentanyl, FTS
usage before or after drug consumption, and the FTS result from last
test.
Participants were instructed to report on their behavior and per-
ception as it related to the most recent FTS use. Several a priori mea-
sures of safer drug use behavior were identified by extensive commu-
nity-based field work with PWID and further confirmed by discussions
with key harm reduction stakeholders. Four safer drug use behaviors
were combined to make a generalized drug use behavior variable (any
behavior vs none): used less drug than usual; pushed syringe plunger
slower than usual; administered tester shot; and snorted instead of in-
jected. Of note, two other safer drug use behaviors— threw away the
drugs (n = 0, 0%) and staggered drug use with injection partner (n = 1,
1.6%)—were included on the survey, but due to sparseness, were not
included in the generalized drug use behavior variable. Perceived
overdose safety was assessed by asking participants, “Does using FTS
make you feel better able to protect yourself from overdose?” (yes/no).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics, FTS corre-
lates, and the study outcomes. We employed a stepwise process to ar-
rive at a parsimonious set of covariates for the final multivariable
models (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000). First, we conducted bivariate
analyses to determine significant associations between demographics
and FTS correlates with changes in drug use behavior and perceived
overdose safety using the χ2 statistic, or Fisher’s exact test in instances
of small cell sizes. Variables that were significant at the P < 0.20 level
in the bivariate analyses were then included in multivariable logistic
regression models. We used a backward selection process to retain
covariates that were significantly associated with drug use behavior and
perceived overdose safety at the P <
0.05 level. Firth’s penalized
likelihood method was used to estimate the final models to address
issues of separation and bias of the parameter estimates due to small
sample sizes (Greenland & Mansournia, 2015). This computed adjusted
odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the demo-
graphics and FTS correlates associated with the outcomes. To test the
robustness of our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that

 modeled associations between demographics and FTS correlates with
changes in drug use behavior and perceived overdose safety only
among those PWID who reported using FTS prior to drug consumption
(n = 101). Stata version 15.1 was used to execute all analyses.
Results
A total of 129 PWID completed the online survey. Respondents who
reported an uncertain FTS result (n = 4) were excluded from analyses.
Of the remaining 125 respondents, 56% were male, 70% were 20–39
years old, 78% were white, 24% were college or technical school
graduates, 70% lived in a home/house, and 49% were unemployed
(Table 1). Nearly half of the sample (48%) reported having experienced
an overdose in their lifetime, while 82% reported previous experience
with naloxone. More than three quarters of the sample (81%) reported
using FTS before drug consumption and nearly one-third (31%) re-
ported seeking fentanyl when performing the FTS test. Approximately
two-thirds (63%) of the FTS results at last use were positive.
For the study outcomes overall, 43% of the sample reported changes
in drug use behavior and 77% indicated that FTS increased their per-
ceived overdose safety. Using less drug than usual was the most com-
monly reported change in drug use behavior (32%) followed by per-
forming a tester shot (17%), snorting instead of injecting (10%), and
pushing the plunger more slowly (9%). Based on the bivariate analyses,
marital status, education, employment status, health insurance, na-
loxone experience, FTS usage, and FTS result were retained for further
analysis with changes in drug use behavior, while age, race, employ-
ment status, and SSP client status were retained for perceived overdose
safety.
In the final multivariable models (Table 2), unemployed PWID had
lower odds of reporting changes in drug use behavior compared to
employed PWID (aOR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.13–0.66) and PWID who
used FTS after drug consumption also had lower odds of changing drug
use behavior compared to PWID who used FTS before consumption
(aOR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.11–0.95). PWID reporting a positive FTS re-
sult had higher odds than those with a negative result to report changes
in drug use behavior (aOR = 5.08, 95% CI =2.12–12.17). PWID aged
40 years and older had higher odds than people aged 20–29 years to
report perceived overdose safety (aOR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.18–13.40).
Non-SSP clients had higher odds than existing clients to report in-
creased perceived overdose safety (aOR = 4.06, 95% CI = 1.63–10.13).
The sensitivity analysis of PWID who used FTS before drug con-
sumption (N = 101) yielded highly comparable results to the analysis
of the full sample (N = 125). Among the subsample of 101 PWID, re-
spondents who reported a positive FTS result had increased odds of
changing their drug use behavior compared to respondents with ne-
gative FTS results (aOR = 4.88, 95% CI = 1.91–12.46); unemployed
PWID had lower odds of reporting changes in drug use behavior com-
pared to employed PWID (aOR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.09–0.55); PWID
aged > 40 years had higher odds than those aged 20–29 years reporting
increased overdose safety (aOR = 4.03, 95% CI = 1.08–15.02); and
non-SSP clients had higher odds than existing clients to report increased
overdose safety (aOR = 4.51, 95% CI = 1.58–12.88).
Discussion
This study examined the off-label use of FTS technology by PWID
and its effect on changes in drug use behavior and perceptions of
overdose risk. Of 125 PWID, nearly two-thirds (63%) reported a posi-
tive FTS result from their most recent use. PWID who reported positive
FTS results had five times higher odds of changing their drug use be-
havior compared to those with negative results. Although we found no
statistically significant association between FTS results and perceptions
of overdose risk, a high percentage of respondents (77%) indicated that
FTS made them feel more able to protect themselves from overdose.
In contrast to reports claiming that “opioid addicts” lack impulse
control and are unable make healthy decisions (Grant et al., 2000;
Jones et al., 2012; Volkow & Fowler, 2000), PWID’s capacity to make
safer drug use decisions when confronted with test results has been well
documented (Bandura, 1990; Celentano et al., 2002; Weinstein, 1989).
One example consistent with our findings comes from the hepatitis C
(HCV) literature and involves injection equipment serosorting: a disease
prevention strategy whereby PWID choose injection partners based on
disease status (e.g., HCV+) to reduce infectious disease transmission
(Smith et al., 2013; van den Boom et al., 2014). In a national study of
9,690 PWID, Smith et al. (2013) found that PWID who received HCV
antibody test results and knew their anti-HCV status were more likely
than those with an unknown HCV status to engage in safer injection
behaviors (e.g., sharing injection equipment only with partners of
concordant disease status).
Our study employs the logic of serosorting to situate “drug
checking” with FTS as a test that can influence PWID’s decision to
practice safer drug use behaviors based on the result. In the current
analysis, PWID who reported a positive test result at last use were
significantly more likely to change drug use behavior compared to
those with a negative test result (aOR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.1–12.2). Like
serosorting, this finding provides additional evidence that PWID, when
receiving test results indicating potential harm, can change how they
inject drugs to prevent adverse health outcomes.
Another notable finding is that over three-quarters of our sample
(81%) reported using FTS to test their drugs prior to consuming them.
This contrasts with a recent Canadian study that found only 38% of
PWID used FTS before consumption (Lysyshyn et al., 2017). As our
study found that respondents who used FTS after consumption had
lower odds of reporting changes in drug use behavior, it is possible that
discrepancies between studies emerged due to the Canadian study re-
cruiting PWID from a supervised consumption site (SCS). SCSs are
staffed by health professionals and PWID may be less motivated to use
FTS before consuming street-purchased opioids because they are using
them in a safe environment (Kennedy et al., 2018; Kerr et al., 2017; Kral
& Davidson, 2017). In the absence of SCSs, the high percentage of FTS
use before consumption in the current study suggests that PWID are
willing to use FTS as an added strategy to protect against fentanyl
overdose and preempt the need for emergency interventions (e.g., na-
loxone, EMS, acute hospitalization).
The impact of FTS distribution on service utilization is also note-
worthy. Slightly over half of our sample (54%) were non-SSP partici-
pants, and this group had four times higher odds than existing SSP
clients to report FTS increased overdose safety. Studies in the U.S. show
that SSPs provide direct harm reduction services to only a small pro-
portion of PWID in a given community or locality (Lorvick et al., 2006;
Riley et al., 2010). Results from this study provide evidence that FTS
distribution may represent a cost-effective strategy to increase program
participation among PWID not currently utilizing harm reduction ser-
vices in their community.
Nearly one-third (31%) of our study sample reported wanting fen-
tanyl when testing their most recently purchased street drugs. This
finding is consistent with another study that found 26% of respondents
(N = 256) reported their preference for fentanyl (Johns Hopkins
University, 2018). Ethnographic research suggests that recent shifts in
illicit opioid preferences may be a function of the specific psychoactive
effects associated with fentanyl (Ciccarone et al., 2017), such as a
stronger “rush” compared to heroin (Armenian et al., 2018). Increased
preference for fentanyl may also reflect IMF’s growing saturation in
illicit drug markets and associated increases in (witting and unwitting)
fentanyl exposure that can result in exacerbated physical dependence
and greater tolerance among PWID (Cicero, Ellis, & Kasper, 2017;
Helander, Backberg, Signell, & Beck, 2017; Marshall et al., 2017;
Somerville et al., 2017). Together, these findings may represent a
growing proportion of PWID who prefer IMF and IMF-adulterated
heroin over heroin alone.

 identifying strong links between economic instability and “deaths of
despair” (i.e., deaths from drug overdose, alcohol-related disease, and
suicide) in states hard hit by the opioid epidemic (Case & Deaton, 2017;
Diez Roux, 2017; Rudd et al., 2016; Zibbell et al., 2017). Our study
found that unemployed PWID had lower odds of reporting changes in
drug use behavior compared with employed PWID. This finding high-
lights the impact economic instability exerts on drug use behavior and
overdose risk, especially among PWID who experience homelessness,
unemployment, incarceration, eviction, and residential transience
(Galea & Vlahov, 2001). These “root” causes of the ongoing opioid crisis
need further exploration (Dasgupta et al., 2018). Targeted outreach
efforts, tailored interventions, and referral to specialty services are
necessary to provide supplemental support for economically dis-
advantaged PWID.

 The use of FTS as a primary overdose prevention strategy is gaining
traction and rapidly becoming a component of harm reduction pro-
grams in the U.S. At present, however, there is a paucity of evidence on
their safety and efficacy, and numerous questions remain as to whether
their use can indeed reduce overdose risk. Qualitative research
(Marshall et al., 2017; Somerville et al., 2017), including rapid assess-
ment ethnography (Ciccarone, 2017), can serve as key supports of
implementation science when examining drug checking technologies
(Barratt et al., 2018). Further studies that investigate attitudes and risk-
reduction behaviors associated with FTS use, including barriers to be-
havioral change, would also benefit from direct observation in real
world settings. For example, field research can aid in studying the
correlation between consumer perceptions and discernment of fentanyl
with FTS detection alongside gold standard gas/liquid chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometry. With reports of fentanyl increasingly
being detected in non-opioid drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine
(Marinetti & Ehlers, 2014; Seth et al., 2018), clinical and toxicological
studies are needed to address the issue of fentanyl testing in different
drug classes or different source-forms of heroin (e.g., black tar).
Limitations
These results should be considered in light of several potential
limitations. The generalizability of this study is limited, given that data
were from just one community in the southeastern U.S. According to
the Drug Enforcement Administration, IMF is more prevalent in
Greensboro, NC and other states east of the Mississippi River, regions
where heroin powder is dominant and can be more easily mixed with
IMF (also a powder), compared to western states like California, New
Mexico and Texas where black tar heroin is dominant and more difficult
to adulterate with IMF (Drug Enforcement Administration, 2017b). The
small sample size limited our ability to derive more precise estimates in
the multivariable analyses, although stepwise and sample size penali-
zation procedures improved model parsimony. Limited sample size also
precluded a more thorough examination of FTS use with the four
changes in drug use behaviors. Because the survey was taken anon-
ymously, it is possible that some respondents could have participated
twice and double counted in the sample, particularly persons not al-
ready enrolled at USU and unfamilar to SSP staff. We suspect subject
duplication was minimal, however, given the short time frame of the
study (two months) and its rigorous, in-person enrollment procedures.
In addition, a small proportion of the total sample (3%) reported an
uncertain FTS result, a finding comparable to other recent FTS studies
(Harm Reduction Coalition, 2018; Health Canada, 2017; Johns Hopkins
University, 2018). Our study suggests, however, that the effects of FTS
use on drug use behavior outweigh the very small likelihood of an
uncertain result. As the general population is still encouraged to use
other common types of health protections (e.g., condoms, over-the-
counter pregnancy tests) despite being subject to diagnostic error or
improper use, the public health message that PWID not use FTS and
assume that all street drugs are tainted with IMF may be counter-
productive regarding informed decision-making and maintaining an
internal locus of control (Celentano et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2017).
Larger prospective studies are now needed to further evaluate patterns
of FTS use and the types of changes in drug use behavior that can lead
to reductions in opioid overdose, including the need to develop stra-
tegies in situations of product uncertainty.
The current study suggests that FTS use has the potential to facil-
itate changes in drug use behavior among PWID, but the question as to
whether FTS can lead to reductions in overdose was beyond the study’s
scope and requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the need for
more evidence should not prevent community-based organizations and
public health agencies from distributing FTS as part of a comprehensive
overdose prevention strategy. When seen in this light, FTS can follow
the path of syringe exchange and lay naloxone distribution, interven-
tions initially developed by harm reduction activists and organizations
before adequate evidence was available and prior to being endorsed by
state and federal public health agencies. A recent commentary re-
commends a similar approach for FTS, echoing the importance of ad-
ditional research and the need to provide FTS within a package of
evidence-based harm reduction services (McGowan, Harris, Platt, Hope,
& Rhodes, 2018). In addition to FTS, there remains a need to evaluate
other types of drug checking technologies, including portable chroma-
tography and spectroscopy devices that can be utilized onsite at SSPs
and SCSs, or through community-based drop-off laboratories and mail
order tests that provide more comprehensive drug panels. Given an
increasingly lethal fentanyl risk environment, FTS technology re-
presents a low-cost and timely strategy that can inform evidence-based
overdose prevention and provide the foundation for developing safer
drug use practices for PWID.
