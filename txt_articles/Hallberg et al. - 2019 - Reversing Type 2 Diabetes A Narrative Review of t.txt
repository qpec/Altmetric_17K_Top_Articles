Abstract: Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has long been identified as an incurable chronic disease
based on traditional means of treatment. Research now exists that suggests reversal is possible
through other means that have only recently been embraced in the guidelines. This narrative review
examines the evidence for T2D reversal using each of the three methods, including advantages and
limitations for each. Methods: A literature search was performed, and a total of 99 original articles
containing information pertaining to diabetes reversal or remission were included. Results: Evidence
exists that T2D reversal is achievable using bariatric surgery, low-calorie diets (LCD), or carbohydrate
restriction (LC). Bariatric surgery has been recommended for the treatment of T2D since 2016 by
an international diabetes consensus group. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and
the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) now recommend a LC eating pattern
and support the short-term use of LCD for weight loss. However, only T2D treatment, not reversal,
is discussed in their guidelines. Conclusion: Given the state of evidence for T2D reversal, healthcare
providers need to be educated on reversal options so they can actively engage in counseling patients
who may desire this approach to their disease.

1. Introduction
According to 2017 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) statistics, there are approximately
425 million people with diabetes worldwide [1]. In the United States, there are an estimated 30.3 million
adults living with diabetes, and its prevalence has been rising rapidly, with at least 1.5 million new
diabetes cases diagnosed each year [2]. Diabetes is a major public health epidemic despite recent
advances in both pharmaceutical and technologic treatment options.
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has long been identified as an incurable chronic disease. The best outcome
that has been expected is amelioration of diabetes symptoms or slowing its inevitable progression.
Approximately 50% of T2D patients will need insulin therapy within ten years of diagnosis [3] Although
in the past diabetes has been called chronic and irreversible, the paradigm is changing [4,5].
The recent 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) global report on diabetes added a section
on diabetes reversal and acknowledged that it can be achieved through weight loss and calorie
restriction [4]. “Diabetes reversal” is a term that has found its way into scientific articles and the lay
press alike; “remission” has also been used. While the exact criteria are still debated, most agree that a
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under the diabetes threshold of 6.5% for an extended period of time without

the use of glycemic control medications would qualify [6]. Excluding metformin from the glycemic
control medications list, as it has indications beyond diabetes, may also be a consideration [7,8].
Likewise, terms such as “partial” (HbA1c <6.5 without glycemic control medications for 1 year)
or “complete” (HbA1c <5.7 without glycemic control medications for 1 year) remission have been
defined by an expert panel as more evidence accumulates that points to the possibility of avoiding the
presumably progressive nature of T2D [9]. It is important to note that the term “cure” has not been
applied to T2D, as there does exist the potential for re-occurrence, which has been well documented in
the literature.
Despite the growing evidence that reversal is possible, achieving reversal is not commonly
encouraged by our healthcare system. In fact, reversal is not a goal in diabetes guidelines. Specific
interventions aimed at reversal all have one thing in common: they are not first-line standard of care.
This is important, because there is evidence suggesting that standard of care does not lead to diabetes
reversal. This raises the question of whether standard of care is really the best practice. A large study
by Kaiser Permanente found a diabetes remission rate of 0.23% with standard of care [10]. The status
quo approach will not reverse the health crisis of diabetes.
A significant number of studies indicate that diabetes reversal is achievable using bariatric
surgery, while other approaches, such as low-calorie diets (LCD) or carbohydrate restriction (LC),
have also shown effectiveness in an increasing number of studies. This review will examine each of
these approaches, identifying their beneficial effects, supporting evidence, drawbacks, and degree
of sustainability.
2. Materials and Methods
A literature search was performed as appropriate for narrative reviews, including electronic
databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar from 1970 through December 2018. We reviewed
English-language original and review articles found under the subject headings diabetes, bariatric
surgery, metabolic surgery, very low-calorie diet, calorie restriction, low carbohydrate diet, ketogenic
diet, diabetes remission, and diabetes reversal. References of the identified publications were searched
for more research articles to include in this review. Selected studies were reviewed and evaluated for
eligibility for inclusion in this review based on their relevance for diabetes reversal and remission.
Either remission or reversal needed to be discussed in the paper or the results were consistent with these
terms for inclusion. Randomized clinical trials and intervention-based studies were given emphasis
for inclusion.
A total of 99 original articles containing information pertaining to diabetes reversal or remission
were included in this narrative review.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Bariatric Surgery
Bariatric surgery has long been recognized as a potential treatment for both morbid obesity and
the metabolic processes that accompany it, specifically T2D. While the efficacy of T2D reversal depends
on the choice of procedure, there is unilateral improvement in glycemia following operation [11], and
bariatric surgery has been found to be superior to intensive T2D medical management. Accordingly, in
2016, the second Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS-II) released recommendations, endorsed by 45 medical
and scientific societies worldwide, to use bariatric surgery as a treatment for T2D (bariatric surgery is
currently approved by the 2016 recommendations for adults with a body mass index (BMI) >40, or
>35 kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities) [12]. Of interest is the consistent finding that glycemic
improvements occur rapidly, often within hours to days, and precede weight loss, which likely
represents the enteroendocrine responses to altered flow of intestinal contents (i.e., bile acid signaling
and changes in microbiota and their metabolome) [13–19].
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 766

The most commonly performed bariatric surgeries in the United States include laparoscopic and
robotic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). While surgical treatment is
based on the principles of restriction and intestinal malabsorption, evidence suggests that there are
more complex mechanisms at play. Bariatric surgery has consistently been shown to dramatically and
rapidly improve blood glucose [20] while allowing decreased oral hypoglycemic medications and
insulin use, effectively reversing diabetes in up to 80% of patients [21] in the short term. In addition
to early post-operative improvement in blood glucose and insulin sensitivity, bariatric surgery has
also been shown to cause alterations in GI hormone release, including ghrelin, leptin, cholecystokinin
(CCK), peptide-tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), that may impact feeding
behavior via the gut–brain axis in addition to modulating euglycemia [22]. Furthermore, microbial
changes in the human gut have been linked to obesity, and surgical alterations to gastrointestinal
anatomy have been associated with dramatic changes in gut microbiota populations with reversion
from an “obesogenic” to a lean bacterial population [13,14,16,19,23,24].
Long-term outcomes from bariatric surgery depend on multiple factors, including type of
surgery performed, patient comorbidities, patient readiness for lifelong dietary change, and ongoing
surveillance. While bariatric surgery has been demonstrated to be safe and effective overall, it is
important to recognize that it is not without risks. Each patient must weigh the risks and benefits
associated with untreated morbid obesity versus those associated with surgery or effective dietary
management and choose accordingly. Surgery of any type can be associated with complications
leading to morbidity or mortality; the complication rates have been stated to be as high as 13%
and 21% for SG and RYGB, respectively. The postoperative mortality rate is 0.28–0.34% for SG and
0.35–0.79% for RYGB; in comparison, an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with
overall complication rates of 9.29% and with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.15–0.6%, depending on
the series [25,26]. Significant complications include anastomotic leak or hemorrhage, post-operative
readmission, need for reoperation, post-operative hypoglycemia, dumping syndrome, worsening acid
reflux, marginal ulceration, and micronutrient deficiencies [25–29].
It is important to consider that while short-duration studies have shown early resolution of
comorbidities following bariatric procedures, when followed for multiple decades, there may be
decreased efficacy of disease resolution and increased incidence of hospital admission long-term.
Long-term reversal of T2D and true glucose homeostasis remain uncertain. Weight loss after surgery is
a significant predictor of a return to euglycemia post-operatively. Multiple studies have reported initial
T2D remission rates as high as 80% [30,31], however, long-term remission is less durable. The five-year
follow-up outcomes of the SLEEVEPASS RCT found complete or partial remission of T2D in 37% of SG
and 45% of RYGB patients, which is similar to other studies showing long-term T2D remission in up to
a third of patients [32]. In the large prospective cohort study Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric
Surgery 2 (LABS-2), the investigators found that long-term diabetes remission after RYGB was higher
than predicted by weight loss alone, which suggests that the surgery itself impacts metabolic factors
that contribute to disease management [31]. Similarly, the STAMPEDE trial—an RCT that followed 150
patients with T2D who were randomized to intensive medical intervention (IMT) versus IMT plus
RYGB versus IMT plus SG for diabetes resolution (defined as HbA1c <6.0%) and followed for five
years—revealed increased rates of T2D resolution with RYGB (29%) and SG (23%) compared to IMT
alone (5%) (Figure 1). The surgery cohort also demonstrated greater weight loss and improvements in
triglycerides, HDL, need for insulin, and overall quality of life [33–35].
Despite the likelihood of improved glycemic control, there are significant financial costs for the
patient, health system, and insurance companies associated with bariatric surgery (U.S. average of
$14,389) [36]. Despite the high initial cost of surgery, Pories and colleagues found that prior to surgery,
patients spend over $10,000 per year on diabetes medications; after RYGB, the annual cost falls to
less than $2000, which represents an $8000 cost savings at the individual level [30]. Furthermore,
economic analyses show that surgery is likely to be cost-effective, especially in patients who are
obese [37,38]. In a clinical effectiveness review of the literature that included 26 trials extracted from
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 766

over 5000 references, Picot et al. found that bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight
loss than non-surgical options; however, there was extreme heterogeneity and questionable long-term
adherence to the non-surgical interventions [39]. After surgery, metabolic syndrome improved, and
there were higher rates of T2D remission compared to the non-surgical groups [39]. Further, while
there were improvements in comorbidities after surgery independent of bariatric procedure, there
was also an increased likelihood of adverse events. While the overall event rate remained low, major
adverse events included medication intolerance, need for reoperation, infection, anastomotic leakage,
and venous and thromboembolic events [39].
It is imperative to consider that one of the requirements of qualifying for bariatric surgery is
demonstration of at least six months of unsuccessful attempts at weight loss using traditional dietary and
exercise advice according to the 2016 Recommendations [12]. There are, however, no requirements as
to what weight loss strategy is employed, which may represent a time point where dietary intervention,
including low-calorie, ketogenic, or carbohydrate-restricted diets, should be utilized. At least two
recent clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy in pre-operative very low-carbohydrate
ketogenic diets before bariatric surgery for increasing weight loss and decreasing liver volume [40,41].
Furthermore, despite technically adequate surgery, an alarming number of patients may still
experience weight regain and/or recurrence of comorbid obesity-associated conditions. In these
patients, effective strategies for dietary intervention are even more important. Approximately 10–15%
of patients fail to lose adequate weight (failure defined as <50% of excess weight) or demonstrate
significant weight regain after bariatric surgery without evidence of an anatomic or technical reason [42].
Additionally, in 25–35% of patients who undergo surgery, significant weight regain (defined as >15%
of initial weight loss) occurs within two to five years post-operatively [43]. These patients often
require further medical management with weight loss medications, further dietary and behavioral
intervention, and, for some, reoperation. Reoperation can be for either revision for further weight
loss (narrowing of the gastric sleeve, conversion of VSG to RYGB, and increasing the length of the
roux limb) or reversal of RYGB due to health concerns, most commonly associated with malnutrition.
A small cohort of patients (4%) may experience severe weight loss with significant malnutrition leading
to hospitalization in over 50%, mortality rates of 18%, and need for reversal of RYGB anatomy. While
the incidence of RYGB reversal is unknown, based upon a systematic review that included 100 patients
spanning 1985–2015, the rate of reversal parallels the increasing rate of bariatric surgery [44].
In the short term, T2D reversal rates with surgery have been reported to be as high as 80%, with
an additional 15% demonstrating partial improvement in T2D despite still requiring medication [17].
Within one week after RYGB, patients experience improved fasting hepatic insulin clearance, reduced
basal de novo glucose production, and increased hepatic insulin sensitivity; by three months and one
year after surgery, patients have improved beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, increased GLP-1 secretion
from the gut, and improved insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells [45]. Over time, T2D remission
rates remain high but do decline; Purnell and colleagues reported three-year remission rates of 68.7%
after RYGB [29]. However, Pories published results from a 14-year prospective study with mean
follow-up of 7.6 years, and found 10-year remission rates remained around 83% [46]. In a 10-year
follow-up study of participants from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study that prospectively
followed patients who underwent bariatric surgery, the authors reported a 72% (n = 342) and 36%
(n = 118) recovery rate from T2D for RYGB at two years and 10 years, respectively [47].
The long-term metabolic impact and risk reduction from surgery remain high in a substantial
number of patients and this route to reversal clearly has the most robust data to support its use.
As evidenced by the dramatic improvements in metabolic state that precede weight loss, bariatric
surgery is far more than merely a restrictive and/or malabsorptive procedure. Large shifts in bile
acid signaling in the lumen of the small intestine, gut nutrient sensing, and changes in the microbiota
community appear to greatly impact overall host health. Further research is ongoing using both
basic and translational science models to identify the role of these various hormones and metabolites;

perhaps there will be a way to one day harness the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery without the
need for anatomic rearrangement.
3.2. Low-Calorie Diets (LCD)
As diabetes rates have risen to unprecedented levels [1,2], the number of studies examining
diabetes reversal using non-surgical techniques has increased. A handful of studies have reported
successful weight loss with decreased insulin resistance, plasma glucose, and medication use following
a LCD. As early as 1976, Bistrian et al. [48] reported that a very low-calorie protein-sparing modified
fast allowed for insulin elimination in all seven obese patients with T2D. The average time to insulin
discontinuation was only 6.5 days, and the longest was 19 days.
In a study by Bauman et al.,
a low-calorie diet of 900 kcal, including 115 g of protein, led to significant improvement in glycemic
control that was mainly attributed to improvements in insulin sensitivity [49]. Furthermore, a study
conducted in obese T2D patients found that a LCD and gastric bypass surgery were equally effective in
achieving weight loss and improving glucose and HbA1c levels in the short term [50]. Weight loss,
however, persisted in the diet-treated patients only for the first three months, indicating difficulty with
long-term maintenance [47]. Similarly, other studies also reported similar pattern of early blood glucose
normalization without medication use, but the improvements were not sustained long-term [51–53].
Likewise, the study by Wing et al., even though reported significant and greater improvements of
HbA1c at 1 year in the intermittently delivered very low-calorie diet, the HbA1c improvement was
not significantly different than what was reported in the patients receiving low-calorie diet (LCD)
throughout the one year period [54]. Furthermore, the glycemic improvements observed at 1 year
were not maintained through 2-years, even though the group with intermittent very low-calorie diet
had less medication requirement than the group in the LCD arm at 2 years [54]. Lastly, micronutrient
deficiencies with the use of calorie restricted diets has been shown and supplementation and monitoring
for deficiencies is a consideration with their use [55,56].
While these previous studies were not assessing diabetes remission or reversal rate per se, they
demonstrated the effectiveness of calorie restriction in achieving weight loss and improved glycemic
control, which are the core goals of reversal. In 2003, the Look AHEAD trial randomized 5145
overweight or obese patients with T2D to an intervention group that received either an intensive
lifestyle intervention (ILI) including calorie restriction and increased physical activity or to a control
group that included diabetes support and education (DSE) [57]. Post hoc analysis of this study revealed
that at one year, 11.5% of the participants in the ILI group achieved remission (partial or complete);
however, remission rates subsequently decreased over time (9.2% at year two and 7.3% at year four).
Nevertheless, the remission rates achieved through ILI were three to six times higher than those
achieved in the DSE group. Lower baseline HbA1c, greater level of weight loss, shorter duration of T2D
diagnosis, and lack of insulin use at baseline predicted higher remission rate in ILI participants [58].
Following the Look AHEAD study, other studies have evaluated a LCD for diabetes
remission [59–61]. Most of these studies assessed remission over a short period of time in a small
study sample. Bhatt et al. reported that six of the 12 individuals achieved partial remission at the
end of the three-month intervention [61]. Ades et al. studied an intensive lifestyle program including
calorie restriction and exercise, and reported that eight of the 10 individuals with recently diagnosed
T2D achieved partial remission at six months, including one with complete remission [60]. The study
ended at six months, therefore long term sustainability was not assessed. Another study assessing a
one-year diabetes remission retrospectively among those undergoing 12 weeks of the intensive weight
loss program “Why Wait” had a much lower remission rate of 4.5%, with 2.3% of them achieving
partial remission, while another 2.3% had complete remission [59]. This study suggests that long-term
maintenance of remission is a challenge. Moreover, diabetes remission was more likely reported in
those who had a shorter diabetes duration, lower baseline HbA1c, and were taking fewer hypoglycemic
medications [59,61].
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 766

An initial 2011 diabetes reversal study by Taylor and colleagues showed that a very low-calorie
diet of 600 Kcal/day not only normalized glucose, HbA1c, and hepatic insulin sensitivity levels within a
week, but also led to decreased hepatic and pancreatic triacylglycerol content and normalization of the
insulin response within eight weeks [62]. At 12 weeks post-intervention, many of the improvements
were maintained, but over a quarter of the patients had an early recurrence of diabetes. Further,
average weight regain during the 12 weeks post-intervention was 20% [62]. As a follow-up to the 2011
study, the same group performed a larger and longer study with eight weeks of a very low-calorie
meal replacement (624–700 kcal/day) followed by two weeks of solid food replacement and a weight
maintenance program of up to six months [63]. In this study, those who achieved a fasting blood
glucose of <7 mmol/L (<126 mg/dL) were categorized as responders, while others were categorized
as non-responders. At six months, 40% of participants who initially responded to the intervention
were still in T2D remission which was defined by achieving a fasting plasma glucose of <7mmol/L; the
majority of those who remitted (60%) had a shorter diabetes duration (<4 years) [63].
These short-term studies were the foundation for a community-based cluster-randomized clinical
trial called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial). DiRECT enrolled a sample of 306 relatively
healthy participants with T2D (people on insulin or with a diabetes duration longer than six years
were excluded) [64] (Figure 1). They were cluster randomized to either standard diabetes care or
an intervention using low-calorie meal replacement diet (825–853 kcal/day) for three to five months,
followed by stepwise food re-introduction and a long-term weight maintenance program. At one-year
follow-up, 46% of patients met the study criteria of diabetes remission (HbA1c <6.5% without
antiglycemic medications) [64] and at two years the remission rate was 36% [65]. The DiRECT study
has extended their follow-up an additional three years to assess the long-term impact on remission.
Taken together, evidence suggests that a LCD is effective in reversing diabetes in the short term
up to two years, and its effectiveness was predominantly demonstrated in those with shorter duration
since diabetes diagnosis. It is important to note that a substantial level of calorie restriction is needed to
generate a sufficient level of weight loss for reversing diabetes. Short-term intervention with moderate
energy restriction and metformin for modest weight loss was not as effective in reversing diabetes as
compared to standard diabetes care [66]. Lifestyle intervention with severe energy restriction may
have some deleterious effect on the body composition and physiology, which poses a concern for
long-term health [67]. Furthermore, long-term achievement of diabetes remission, adherence to the
diet, and weight loss maintenance after the diet remain a challenge. Studies have also suggested
that physiological and metabolic adaptation of the body in response to caloric restriction may shift
energy balance and hormonal regulation of weight toward weight regain after weight loss [67,68].
Thus, it is crucial that future studies are directed towards assessing the long-term sustainability of
diabetes remission led by LCD and feasibility of this diet on the physiological adaptation and body
composition changes.
3.3. Carbohydrate-Restricted Diets (LC)
Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, low carbohydrate (LC) diets were the most frequently
prescribed treatment for diabetes [69,70].
The paradigm shifted both with the development of
exogenous insulin and later with the emergence of the low-fat diet paradigm. A diet low in fat, which
by default is high in carbohydrate, became the standard recommendation in guidelines around the
globe [71]. Rather than preventing elevations in glucose, the goal became maintenance of blood sugar
control via the increased use of glycemic control medications, including insulin [72]. Over the last
decade, clinical studies have begun to resurrect the pre-insulin LC dietary approach. In response
to the new evidence on the efficacy of carbohydrate restriction, low-carbohydrate has recently been
endorsed as an eating pattern by the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes
(EASD) [5,73]. In addition, the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DOD) guidelines now
recommend carbohydrate restriction as low as 14% of energy intake in its most recent guidelines for
treatment of diabetes (VA) [74].
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 766
7 of 17
LC diets are based on macronutrient changes rather than a focus on calorie restriction [75].
Although the exact definition varies, a low-carbohydrate diet usually restricts total carbohydrates to
less than 130 grams per day, while a very low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet usually restricts total
carbohydrates to as low as 20–30 grams per day. Protein consumption is generally unchanged from a
standard ADA diet (around 20% of intake), with the remaining energy needs met by fat from either the
diet or mobilized body fat stores. Carbohydrate sources are primarily non-starchy vegetables with
some nuts, dairy, and limited fruit [75].
A total of 32 separate trials examining carbohydrate restriction as a treatment for T2D were
found when our search was performed [76–108]. However, for reasons that may include varied
levels of carbohydrate restriction and differing levels of support given, not all studies had results
that would be consistent with diabetes reversal. A number of shorter-term trials have found a
significant between-group advantage of a low-carbohydrate intervention for T2D [80,84,92,97]. Data
from longer-term trials are limited, and in some follow-up studies, the between-group advantage
seen initially was lost or reduced, although it often remains significantly improved from baseline.
This raises the question of long-term sustainability using this approach. Due to heterogeneity in
methodology and definition of carbohydrate restriction, the ability to fully examine T2D reversal based
on the existing studies is limited. Based upon a recent systematic review of LC, it appears that the
greatest improvements in glycemic control and greatest medication reductions have been associated
with the lowest carbohydrate intake [109]. In consideration of these limitations, it appears important to
assess the level of carbohydrate restriction, support or other methods given to encourage sustainability,
and length of follow-up.
A study comparing an ad libitum very low-carbohydrate (<20 g total) diet to an energy-restricted
low-glycemic diet in T2D found greater reduction in HbA1c, weight, and insulin levels in the
low-carbohydrate arm [89]. Additionally, 95% of participants in the low-carbohydrate arm reduced or
eliminated glycemic control medications, compared to 62% in the low glycemic index arm at 24 weeks.
Instruction was given in a one-time session with a dietician and included take-home materials for
reference. A slightly longer study (34 weeks) trial [85] found that a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic
diet intervention (20–50 g net carbs per day) resulted in HbA1c below the threshold for diabetes in 55%
of the patients, compared to 0% of patients in the low-fat arm. The education sessions were all online
and included behavior modification strategies and mindful eating which was aimed to address binge
eating. New lessons were emailed to the patients weekly for the first 16 weeks and then every two
weeks for the remainder of the study.
A small (34 participants) one-year study of an ad libitum, very low-carbohydrate diet compared
to a calorie-restricted moderate carbohydrate diet found a significant reduction in HbA1c between
groups favoring the low-carbohydrate arm [86]. At one year, 78% of participants who began the trial
with a HbA1c above 6.5% no longer met the cutoff for the diagnosis of diabetes, no longer required any
non-metformin medication, and significantly reduced or eliminated metformin. Total kilocalorie intake
was not significantly different between the two groups, even with moderate carbohydrate restriction.
Despite equal energy intake, the low carbohydrate group lost significantly more weight and had
improved glycemic control, which indicates a potential mechanistic role for carbohydrate restriction
itself. The support given was 19 classes over the 12-month period, tapering in frequency over time.
Another one-year trial [76] found significant HbA1c reduction in the subset of patients with
diabetes (n = 54) assigned to an ad libitum low-carbohydrate diet (<30 total grams per day), compared
to an energy-restricted low-fat diet. These results remained significant after adjusting the model for
weight loss, indicating an effect of the carbohydrate reduction itself. The support given was four
weekly sessions during the first month, followed by monthly sessions for the remaining 11 months.
A metabolic ward study on 10 patients with T2D [96] found that 24-h glucose curves normalized
within two weeks on a very low-carbohydrate diet (<21 g total per day). This was in addition to
medication reduction and elimination including insulin and sulfonylureas After accounting for body
water changes, the average weight loss during the two-week period was 1.65 kg (average of <2% total
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 766

body weight which is similar to the results of bariatric surgery, where normoglycemia is seen prior to
significant weight loss. Interestingly, despite the diet being ad libitum other than the carbohydrate
limit, the average energy intake decreased by 1000 kcal per day. Assuming no further change in
glycemic control, HbA1c would be 5.6% after eight weeks, which would represent a reduction of 23%
from baseline. The fact that HbA1c reductions were greater than in other, longer-term outpatient
studies may indicate that support of dietary changes is the key to longer-term success.
In our published trial providing significant support through the use of a continuous care
intervention (CCI), we examined using a low-carbohydrate diet aimed at inducing nutritional ketosis
in patients with T2D (n = 262), compared with usual care T2D patients (n = 87) [98] (Figure 1). At one
year, the HbA1c decreased by 1.3% in the CCI, with 60% of completers achieving a HbA1c below 6.5%
without hypoglycemic medication (not including metformin). Overall, medications were significantly
reduced, including complete elimination of sulfonylureas and reduction or elimination of insulin
therapy in 94% of users. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant improvement [110].
The one-year retention rate was 83%, which indicates that a non-calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate
intervention can be sustained. Improvements were not observed in the usual care patients. The newly
released two-year results of this trial [106] show sustained improvements in normoglycemia, with 54%
of completers maintaining HbA1c below 6.5% without medication or only on metformin. The retention
rate at two years was 74%, further supporting the sustainability of this dietary intervention for diabetes
reversal. Weight loss of 10% was seen at 2-years despite no intentional caloric restriction instruction.
Additionally, this trial involved participants with a much longer duration of diabetes (8.4 years
on average) than other nutrition trial interventions [58,64,65] and did not exclude anyone taking
exogenous insulin. As duration of T2D and insulin use have both been identified to be negative factors
in predicting remission after bariatric surgery [111,112], the 2-year results of this trial may be even
more significant.
It is interesting to note that most studies utilize ad libitum intake in the carbohydrate-restricted
arm. Despite this, in studies that have tracked energy intake, spontaneous calorie restriction has
occurred [113,114]. In many trials where energy intake has been prescribed or weight loss has been equal,
an advantage has been seen in glycemic control, weight, or both in the low-carbohydrate arm [86,91,107].
A better understanding of the role that caloric intake, whether prescribed or spontaneous, plays in the
overall success is important. In cases of spontaneous energy intake reduction, elucidating the specific
mechanism behind this reduction would help in the overall personalization of this approach.
Multiple studies have evaluated side effects or potential complications of carbohydrate restriction.
The diet has been found to be safe and well tolerated although long term hard outcome data is lacking
and should be a focus of future research. A transient rise in uric acid early in very low-carbohydrate
restriction without an associated increase in gout or kidney stones has been documented [84,98,100].
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) has been found to increase and decrease in different studies without an
associated change in kidney function [87,98,100,115,116]. Recently, bone mineral density has been
found to be unchanged despite significant weight loss after two years of a ketogenic diet intervention
in patients with T2D [108]. While most studies show an improvement or no change in LDL-C levels
in patients with T2D on a low-carbohydrate diet, there have been two studies that have found an
increase in LDL-C in participants with T2D [99,111]. In one of the studies that found an increase
in calculated LDL-C, a non-significant reduction in measured ApoB lipoproteins and unchanged
non-HDL cholesterol were seen. Monitoring LDL-C or a measured value of potentially atherogenic
lipoproteins such as ApoB should be considered. Lastly, micronutrient deficiency has been seen with a
carbohydrate restricted diet, supplementation and monitoring should be given consideration with this
intervention [56].
Although the use of very low-carbohydrate diets for diabetes reversal shows promising results,
the lack of longer-term follow-up studies remains a limitation. Follow up is limited to two years, and
therefore longer-term studies are needed to determine the sustainability of the metabolic improvements.
Determining the appropriate method of support may be a key to the overall success with disease reversal.

6.5% without hypoglycemic medication (not including metformin). Overall, medications were 
significantly reduced, including complete elimination of sulfonylureas and reduction or elimination 
of insulin therapy in 94% of users. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant improvement 
[110]. The one-year retention rate was 83%, which indicates that a non-calorie-restricted, low-
carbohydrate intervention can be sustained. Improvements were not observed in the usual care 
patients. The newly released two-year results of this trial [106] show sustained improvements in 
normoglycemia, with 54% of completers maintaining HbA1c below 6.5% without medication or only 
on metformin. The retention rate at two years was 74%, further supporting the sustainability of this 
dietary intervention for diabetes reversal. Weight loss of 10% was seen at 2-years despite no 
intentional caloric restriction instruction. Additionally, this trial involved participants with a much 
longer duration of diabetes (8.4 years on average) than other nutrition trial interventions [58,64,65] 
and did not exclude anyone taking exogenous insulin. As duration of T2D and insulin use have both 
been identified to be negative factors in predicting remission after bariatric surgery [111,112], the 2-
year results of this trial may be even more significant.

4. Summary
Additional evidence has become available in recent years suggesting that diabetes reversal is a
possible alternative to consider in place of traditional diabetes treatment and management. In this
paper, we provide a review of three methods that have been shown to successfully reverse type 2
diabetes. The current body of evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is the most effective method for
overall efficacy and prolonged remission, even though concerns associated with surgical complications,
treatment cost and complete lifestyle modification after surgery remain challenges for wide adoption
of this approach. While both the LCD and LC dietary approaches are convincing for reversing diabetes
in the short term (up to two years), long term maintenance of diabetes remission is still unproven.
There are limited available data supporting long term maintenance of weight loss and its associated
glycemic improvements in response to LCD; similarly, long-term adherence to a low carbohydrate

diet will likely remain an obstacle without the development of proper patient education and optimal
support for long-term behavioral change. Moreover, research in understanding the mechanism of
diabetes reversibility in all three approaches and its overlapping mechanistic pathways are lacking;
this is an area for future research emphasis.
There are similar identified negative predictors of remission for all three approaches. These factors
include longer diabetes duration and increased severity, lower BMI, advanced age, poor glycemic
control, and low C-peptide levels (indicating decreased endogenous insulin production) [117]. Further
exploration into the heterogeneity of these factors will help personalize the approach, determine
realistic goals for each patient, and should be considered during treatment discussions. Ongoing
research into algorithm development will be helpful in this regard.
5. Conclusions
Overall, as a society we can no longer afford or tolerate the continued rising rates of diabetes.
Despite many barriers within the healthcare system as a whole, providers are responsible on a daily
basis for the lives of patients caught up in this unprecedented epidemic. The current standard of care
may be suitable for some, but others would surely choose reversal if they understood there was a
choice. The choice can only be offered if providers are not only aware that reversal is possible but have
the education needed to review these options in a patient-centric discussion.
