Societal Discrimination With Adverse Behavioral
Health Outcomes in Late Adolescence
Adam M. Leventhal, PhD; Junhan Cho, PhD; Nafeesa Andrabi, BA; Jessica Barrington-Trimis, PhD
IMPORTANCE Public expressions of discrimination may generate stress and behavioral health
problems, particularly in racial/ethnic minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged youths.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether concern about increasing discrimination in society
reported among adolescents during 2016 and the magnitude of increase in concern from
2016 to 2017 were associated with behavioral health outcomes by 2017 and to examine
racial/ethnic or socioeconomic differences in associations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort survey collected data at
baseline from January 2 through September 28, 2016 (11th grade), and at follow-up from
January 1 through August 10, 2017 (12th grade), at 10 high schools in Los Angeles, California,
recruited through convenience sampling. A total of 2572 students completed both surveys.
EXPOSURES Reported concern, worry, or stress regarding “increasing hostility and
discrimination of people because of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation/identity,
immigrant status, religion, or disability status in society”were scored as “not at all”(0) to
“
extremely”(4). Mean ratings were calculated in a 3-item composite (range, 0-4).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported days of cigarette, alcohol, or marijuana use in
the past month (range, 0-30 days), number of substances used in the past 6 months (range,
0-27), mild to moderate depression (yes or no), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) (yes or no) at follow-up.
RESULTS The sample of 2572 students (54.4% female; mean [SD] baseline age, 17.1 [0.4]
years; 1969 [87.7%] had at least 1 parent with high school diploma) included 2530 with
race/ethnicity data (1198 [47.4%] Hispanic; 482 [19.0%] Asian; 104 [4.1%] African American;
155 [6.1%] multiracial; 419 [16.6%] white; 172 [6.8%] other). Appreciable numbers of students
reported feeling very or extremely concerned (baseline, 1047 [41.5%]; follow-up, 1028
[44.6%]), worried (baseline, 743 [29.7%]; follow-up, 795 [34.7%]), or stressed (baseline, 345
[13.9%]; follow-up, 353 [15.5%]) about increasing societal discrimination. Each 1-SD increase
on the societal discrimination concern composite in 2016 was associated with more days of
past-month cigarette (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.42-2.20; P < .001), marijuana
(IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26; P = .03), and alcohol (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P = .01) use,
more substances used (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; P = .04), and greater odds of depression
(odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .04) and ADHD (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26;
P = .04) symptoms in 2017. The magnitude of increase in societal discrimination concern from
2016 to 2017 was also associated with several behavioral health problems in 2017; some
associations were amplified among teenagers who were African American (IRR for cigarette
smoking, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.45-6.09) or Hispanic (IRR for cigarette smoking, 1.30; 95% CI,
1.09-1.54) or had parents with less educational attainment (IRR for alcohol use, 1.41 [95% CI,
1.14-1.74]; OR for ADHD, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.13-2.89]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Concern over societal discrimination was common among
youths in Los Angeles in 2016 and was associated with behavioral health problems 1 year
later. Adolescents’behavioral responses to recent societal expressions of discrimination may
warrant public health attention.

 P
ublic expressions of resentment, discrimination, and
hostility toward minority and disadvantaged popula-
tions have become increasingly prominent.1 Several
events leading up to 2016 exemplify such trends, including
highly publicized incidents of police violence toward racial/
ethnic minorities, backlash against same-sex marriage legis-
lation, and the largest number of hate crimes against Ameri-
canMuslimssincetheperiodimmediatelyfollowingSeptember
11,2001.2-4Thesocialclimateintensifiedduring2016and2017,
when the Trump presidential campaign and administration
released several statements and social policy proposals
perceived by many as discriminatory. Because polarizing
societal events have historically been linked with stress and
behavioral health problems,5-7 the ramifications of recent dis-
crimination-associated societal events may be a public health
concern, particularly for vulnerable populations, such as
adolescents.
Whether the extent of concern adolescents attribute to in-
creasing discrimination in society is of an appreciable level to
heighten risk of behavioral health problems is unknown. Con-
cern over societal discrimination could cause distress, impair
concentration, and lead to hopelessness about the future
among teenagers on the cusp of adulthood, especially among
racial/ethnic minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged
youths who may be worried about being directly targeted by
discrimination.Distress,concentrationimpairment,andhope-
lessness increase the incidence, persistence, and exacerba-
tion of behavioral health problems that are prevalent in late
adolescence, including substance use, depression, and atten-
tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).8-13
If concern over societal discrimination is common among
adolescents and associated with adverse behavioral health
outcomes, preventive measures to protect the current genera-
tion of youth exposed to public expressions of hostility and
discrimination toward minority populations may be war-
ranted. This study investigated whether concern over increas-
ing discrimination in society reported among 11th grade stu-
dents in Los Angeles, California, during 2016 and the
magnitude of increase in concern from 2016 to 2017 were as-
sociatedwithbehavioralhealthoutcomesby2017andwhether
associations were amplified among youth from racial/ethnic
minority groups or youth with less educated parents.
Methods
Participants and Procedures
Data were drawn from a prospective cohort survey of behav-
ioral health, which enrolled students from urban and subur-
ban public high schools in Los Angeles County in 2013.14 Ap-
proximately 40 public high schools in the Los Angeles
metropolitan region were contacted about participating in this
studybecauseoftheirdiversedemographiccharacteristicsand
proximity to the study institution. Ten schools agreed to par-
ticipate (school characteristics in context of Los Angeles city
public schools appear in eTable 1 in the Supplement). All 9th
grade students in standard educational programming within
these schools in 2013 who provided assent and who had writ-
ten or verbal parental consent were eligible to join the cohort.
The institutional review board of the University of Southern
California approved the study.
Paper-and-pencil surveys were administered semiannu-
ally in classrooms from 9th through 12th grade. Students not
in class during data collections completed abbreviated sur-
veys by telephone, Internet, or mail that included only behav-
ioral health measures. The measure involving concern over
societal discrimination was included in the full-length base-
line survey from January 2 through September 28, 2016 (11th
grade), and the 12-month follow-up survey from January 1
through August 10, 2017 (12th grade).
Measures
Societal Discrimination Concern
In3separateitems,studentsratedtheirlevelofconcern,worry,
or stress regarding “increasing hostility and discrimination of
people because of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation/
identity, immigrant status, religion, or disability status in so-
ciety” (scored 0 for “not at all”; 1 for “slightly”; 2 for “some-
what”; 3 for “very”; and 4 for “extremely”). We calculated the
mean of the 3 ratings to quantify the overall magnitude of so-
cietal discrimination concern (range, 0-4) in a composite in-
dex that had high internal consistency at baseline (Cronbach
α = 0.88) and follow-up (Cronbach α = 0.90). Difference scores
were also computed (follow-up – baseline) to operationalize
the change in societal discrimination concern level from 2016
to 2017.
Substance Use
Cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use were measured using
well-validated items15,16 instructing students to select the
number of days they used each substance in the past 30 days.
Past 6-month use (yes or /no) of 27 different substances
(eg, cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, prescription painkillers, in-
halants, ecstasy, or cocaine) were summed to create a cumu-
lative substance use index (range, 0-27).

Key Points
Question Is concern about increasing discrimination in society
associated with behavioral health outcomes among adolescents?
Findings In this cohort survey of 2572 adolescents, self-reported
level of concern about increasing societal discrimination was
associated with higher frequency of substance use, a greater
number of different substances used, and 11% higher odds of
depression and 12% greater odds of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
Meaning Public health and policy interventions may be warranted
to address the potential adverse effect of increasing public
expressions of discrimination on adolescent behavioral health.

 depressive symptoms (eg, sadness, sleep and appetite prob-
lems, or psychomotor slowing) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 indi-
cates 0 days; 3, 5-7 days). Sum scores were used to classify
whether students met or exceeded the recommended
screening cutoff indicative of mild to moderate depressive
symptoms (score, ≥16).17 The 18-item Current Symptoms
Scale–Self Report Form,19 which screens for Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
(DSM-IV)-defined ADHD, was administered. Respondents
indicated the past 6-month frequency of experiencing inat-
tention (ie, difficulty organizing and completing tasks) and
hyperactivity and/or impulsivity (ie, difficulties remaining
still or with task persistence) ADHD symptoms. Consistent
with DSM-IV criteria,19,20 adolescents who reported experi-
encing at least 6 inattention or at least 6 hyperactivity
and/or impulsivity symptoms often or very often were clas-
sified positive for ADHD symptoms.
Covariates and Descriptive Measures
Covariates to address the potential confounding influence of
sociodemographic variation included age, sex, race/
ethnicity, and highest parental educational level, which were
assessed with investigator-defined, forced-choice items (re-
sponse categories are given in Table 1). Additional measures
include perceived frequency of personal discrimination using
the Everyday Discrimination Scale,21 reported birth country of
students and their parents (United States vs other), and accul-
turation using the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanic
Youth22 that assesses the extent of use of non-English lan-
guagesacrosssettings(eg,athome,withfriends)(sumof1[only
another language] to 5 [only English] for 4 items; Cronbach
α = 0.82).
Statistical Analysis
Negative binomial regression models23 were used to obtain
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for associations of
the (1) baseline societal discrimination concern composite
score and (2) change in societal discrimination concern
score from baseline to follow-up, with substance use out-
comes at follow-up. Logistic regression was used to obtain
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for associations of the base-
line and change in societal discrimination concern score

 with ADHD and depression symptoms. For each outcome,
separate models were tested for the societal discrimination
concern baseline and change scores. Models were adjusted for
the respective behavioral health outcome at baseline and
sociodemographic covariates. To facilitate interpretation of
ORs and IRRs, the societal discrimination concern composite
was standardized (mean [SD], 0 [1]) for regression modeling.
The χ2 difference test of goodness of fit from multigroup
analysis24 was used to determine whether associations esti-
mated in regression models differed by race/ethnicity or high-
est parental educational level (ie, high school graduate or
higher degree vs no high school diploma). We used Mplus,
version 7 (Muthen & Muthen)25 with complex analysis to
account for nesting by school. The 2572 participants with data
on baseline societal discrimination concern and at least 1
behavioral health outcome constituted the analytic sample.
Additional missing data were managed with full-information
maximum-likelihood estimation (eTable 2 in the Supplement
provides numbers of participants with available data for
key variables). Statistical significance was set at P < .05 (2
tailed). Benjamini-Hochberg corrections for multiple testing26
were applied for primary tests of association of baseline soci-
etal discrimination concern with outcomes. Other (second-
ary) tests were uncorrected. Findings from sensitivity analy-
ses are summarized below and detailed in eMethods in the
Supplement.
Results
Study Sample
Among eligible 9th grade students (N = 4100), 3396
enrolled in the cohort in 2013. Societal discrimination con-
cern data were collected from 2735 students in 2016 (base-
line), of whom 2572 (94.0%) completed follow-up (2017)
(1400 female [54.4%] and 1172 male [45.6%]; mean [SD]
age, 17.1 [0.4] years). eFigure 1 in the Supplement provides
participant accrual details.
Descriptive Results
The sample was heterogeneous with regard to sex and
parental educational level and had a plurality of Hispanic
students, with an appreciable representation of students of
Asian, African American, multiracial, and white race/
ethnicity (Table 1). Of students with parental education
data, 1969 (87.7%) reported having at least 1 parent with a
high school diploma. The mean (SD) level of acculturation
was moderate relative to standardized reference samples of
Hispanic youth (16.70 [2.89]).22 Although most students
were born in the United States, a substantial proportion of
students’ parents were born outside the country (1383
mothers [56.3%] and 1417 fathers [58.8%]). Responses on
the Everyday Discrimination Scale (mean [SD], 8.52 [8.15])
indicate considerable interindividual variability in the fre-
quency of personal discrimination in the sample.
Descriptive data on depression, ADHD, and substance use
at baseline and follow-up are reported in Table 2 and are com-
mensurate with estimates in other population-based adoles-
cent studies.27 From baseline to follow-up, increases were ob-
served in the number of past-month days of cigarette (baseline
vs follow-up mean [SD], 0.27 [2.36] vs 0.41 [2.73]), marijuana
(mean [SD], 1.26 [4.55] vs 1.89 [5.76]), and alcohol (mean [SD],
0.85 [2.57] vs 1.16 [2.76]) use and number of past 6-month sub-
stances used (mean [SD], 1.57 [3.07] vs 2.01 [3.30]), whereas
the prevalence of ADHD (baseline vs follow-up, 188 [7.4%] vs
174 [7.4%]) and depression symptoms (1004 [39.3%] vs 1033
[40.7%]) did not change.
Characterization of Students’ Level
of Societal Discrimination Concern
Sizeable proportions of the overall sample reported feeling
very or extremely concerned (baseline, 1047 [41.5%]; fol-
low-up, 1028 [44.6%]), worried (baseline, 743 [29.7%];
follow-up, 795 [34.7%]), or stressed (baseline, 345 [13.9%];
follow-up, 353 [15.5%]) about increasing societal discrimina-
tion; each rating increased from baseline to follow-up
(Table 2). Overall concern quantified by the 3-item compos-
ite varied substantially across students and increased from
baseline (mean [SD], 1.56 [1.21]) to follow-up (mean [SD],
1.71 [1.24]).
The baseline societal discrimination concern composite
score and change from baseline to follow-up by race/
ethnicity are reported in Table 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment. Societal discrimination concern composite scores did
not differ by parental educational level and were modestly cor-
related with Everyday Discrimination Scale scores at baseline
(Pearson r = 0.14; P < .001).
Associations of Societal Discrimination Concern
With Behavioral Health in the Overall Sample
Primary Tests of Baseline Societal Discrimination Concern
Regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covari-
ates and the respective outcome at baseline showed that the
baseline societal discrimination concern composite score was
associated with greater odds or frequency of behavioral health
problems at follow-up for each outcome (Table 3 and eTable 3
in the Supplement). For example, each 1-SD increase in base-
line societal discrimination concern was associated with 77%
more days of past-month cigarette smoking (IRR, 1.77; 95% CI,
1.42-2.20; P < .001) and 12% greater odds of ADHD symp-
toms (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26; P = .04) at follow-up.
ChangeinSocietalDiscriminationConcernFromBaselinetoFollow-up
The magnitude of change in societal discrimination concern
composite score from baseline to follow-up was positively
associated with cigarette smoking, marijuana use, and the
number of substances used at follow-up after adjusting for
sociodemographic factors and the respective baseline sub-
stance use variable (Table 3). For example, each 1-SD
increase in the societal discrimination concern composite
scores from baseline to follow-up was associated with 18%
more days of cigarette smoking in the past month at
follow-up (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.42; P = .02). Change in
societal discrimination concern was not associated with
alcohol use, depression, or ADHD at follow-up in the overall
sample.

ference in associations by parental education, P = .04). Among
youths whose parent(s) did not complete high school, the es-
timated mean past-month days of marijuana use from these
regression models was successively higher across students
who, for example, reported no change (1.37 days; 95% CI, 1.18-
1.51), a 2-point increase (eg, from slightly to very concerned;
2.17 days; 95% CI, 1.76-2.64), and a 4-point increase (eg, from
not at all to extremely concerned; 3.36 days; 95% CI, 2.37-
4.72) in the societal discrimination concern score from base-
line to follow-up (Figure 1A). Among youths whose parent(s)
completed high school, the estimated mean days of past-
month marijuana use days at follow-up differed less substan-
tially across youths who reported no change (1.05 days; 95%
CI, 0.91-1.21), a 2-point increase (1.22 days; 95% CI, 0.95-
1.52), and a 4-point increase (1.39 days; 95% CI, 0.91-2.10) on
the societal discrimination composite. Associations of soci-
etal discrimination concern change scores with past 30-day al-
cohol use and ADHD were significantly stronger in youths
whose parent(s) did not complete high school (IRR for alco-
holuse, 1.41[95%CI,1.14-1.74];ORforADHD,1.81[95%CI,1.13-
2.89]) than in youths whose parents completed high school
(IRR for alcohol use, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89-1.02; difference in as-
sociations by parental education, P = .02]; OR for ADHD, 0.98
[95% CI, 0.81-1.20; difference in associations by parental edu-
cation, P = .03]) (Figure 1B and C).
The association of change in societal discrimination con-
cern from baseline to follow-up with past-month smoking
days at follow-up differed by race/ethnicity (Figure 2). Each
1-SD increase in societal discrimination concern from base-
line to follow-up was associated with significantly more past-
month smoking days at follow-up in African American
(IRR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.45-6.09) and Hispanic (IRR, 1.30; 95%
CI, 1.09-1.54) youth, whereas in other racial/ethnic groups,
associations were nonsignificant (IRR, ≤1.23; P > .13) (differ-
ence in associations by race/ethnicity, P = .04). Associations
of societal discrimination concern composite change score
with other outcomes did not differ by parental educational
level or race/ethnicity.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses showed negligible effects of using alter-
native methods of addressing missing data or omitting covar-
iatesonstudyfindings,modestdifferencesbetweencohorten-
rollees included vs excluded in the analytic sample, low
likelihood that unmeasured confounding explains the re-
sults, and that the association of baseline societal discrimina-
tion concern composite scores with 5 of 6 behavioral health
outcomes at follow-up did not differ across youth who did and
did not report frequently being a direct target of discrimina-
tion. Data are given in eMethods and eTables 4 to 7 in the
Supplement.
Discussion
Concern, worry, and stress attributed to increasing societal dis-
crimination during the recent sociopolitically charged period
was common and associated with adverse behavioral health
outcomes in this adolescent cohort. Polarizing societal events
before 2016 may have generated concern over societal dis-
crimination reported by students at baseline, including hate
crimes, instances of police violence toward racial/ethnic mi-
norities,andhostilitytowardminoritiesexpressedamongpub-
lic figures in the media.2-4 From the spring of 2016 to the spring
of2017—atimespancoincidingwiththe2016presidentialcam-
paign and first several months of the Trump presidency—
reported concern increased predominantly among Hispanic

a Results of regression models are adjusted for parental educational level, youth
age, sex, and race/ethnicity at baseline and the respective behavioral health
variable at baseline; separate models were tested for each combination of
regressor and outcome. The regressor is standardized (mean, 0; SD, 1) such
that ORs and IRRs can be interpreted as the difference in odds or frequency
rate of outcome with 1-SD difference in the regressor.

 and African American students. During this period, President
Trump pledged to enact new policies that may have height-
ened concern about intensifying discrimination in society,
including proposals to construct a US-Mexico border wall to
deter undocumented immigration, repeal the Affordable Care
Act that provides health insurance to millions of low-income
Americans, and prohibit entry into the United States from sev-
eral countries with high religious minority populations. Con-
sequently, the adolescents concerned about societal discrimi-
nation in early 2016 may have been especially reactive to the
events transpiring during the subsequent year, which may, in
turn, had implications for their behavioral health.

 Several explanations for the associations found in this
study may apply. Cross-student differences in willingness to
report behavioral health problems and express feelings about
the social climate could have affected study results. How-
ever,reportingtendenciesareimplausibleexplanationsofwhy
the change in societal discrimination concern from 2016 to
2017 was associated with certain behavioral health outcomes
and why associations were amplified among racial/ethnic
minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth in sev-
eral cases. A preexisting liability toward behavioral health
problems and sensitivity to environmental stress caused by
endogenous (eg, genetics) or exogenous (eg, neighborhood
deprivation) factors28,29 could have influenced associations
between societal discrimination concern and behavioral
health. Shared liability would presumably be reflected, to
some extent, by students’baseline behavioral health and
sociodemographic status, and findings with vs without
adjusting for these factors did not differ (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Perhaps the measure of youths’perceptions of
discrimination in society is a proxy for discrimination di-
rectly experienced, and being the direct target of discrimina-
tion, per se, may worsen behavioral health.30 However, the as-
sociations predominately generalized across youths who did
vs did not report frequently experiencing discrimination
(eMethods in the Supplement).
Although inferences regarding whether the demon-
strated associations are causal cannot be made from this
observational study, perceiving discrimination in society
may play a direct role in the behavioral health of youth.
Stress in any form may cause depression and interfere with
the development of sustained attention, impulse control,
and decision-making skills, which in turn may heighten the
risk of ADHD and substance use.11-13,31-34 During the age cap-
tured in this study (11th to 12th grade), most adolescents
began to face impending adult responsibilities, such as inde-
pendent housing, obtaining full-time employment, financial
independence, and embarking on higher education or other
forms of career training. Many of these responsibilities are
essential to identity formation during this developmental
stage and the transition from adolescence to young
adulthood.35 Consequently, youth concerned about the social
climate may become discouraged about future opportunities
for social advancement, less apt to successfully progress
toward an adult identity, and more inclined to engage in risky
behaviors they otherwise would not have, including sub-
stance use.8,9
In the overall sample, youth who became more con-
cerned over societal discrimination during this period accel-
erated their cigarette and marijuana use frequency by follow-
up. The reason why this association was specific to these 2
substances and did not extend to alcohol or to depression or
ADHDsymptomsisunknownandwarrantsfurtherinquiry.The
association between change in societal discrimination con-
cern and several behavioral health outcomes was heightened
among African American, Hispanic, or socioeconomically dis-
advantaged youths. Youths from these populations may be-
lieve that the consequences of shifting social trends are more
likely to affect their communities. Consequently, the extent
to which accelerated societal discrimination concerns trans-
late into behavioral health problems may be more powerful for
these youths. The pattern of stronger associations between
changes in societal discrimination concerns and study out-
comes was particularly pervasive in adolescents with less edu-
cated parents, extending across 3 of the 6 behavioral health
problems. Compared with[12.3%] other demographic fac-
tors, parental educational level and other socioeconomic in-
dicators are especially indicative of social disadvantage.36 So-
cial disadvantage per se may be a key source of vulnerability
to behavioral health consequences of societal discrimination
concerns.

 Limitations
A limitation of this research was the application of an adver-
sity approach to understanding this phenomenon. Resil-
iency, connectedness, and other potential buffers of the
association between societal discrimination concern and be-
havioral health warrant future study. This investigation could
not biochemically verify substance use or obtain clinician di-
agnoses of depression or ADHD. Although the societal dis-
crimination concern items exhibited high internal reliability
in this study, they have not been subject to extensive psycho-
metric evaluation. These items assess concern over increases
in societal discrimination, yet some youth may not perceive
societal discrimination to be increasing. Whether findings
would generalize to other geographic locations or other de-
velopmental periods is unknown.
Conclusions
Recent societal increases in hostility and discrimination di-
rected toward minorities may be a significant source of con-
cern in youth that is associated with adverse behavioral health
outcomes, particularly in teenagers of color or from socioeco-
nomically disadvantaged families. Although some of the as-
sociations were of small magnitude, even modest increases in
theriskofadolescentbehavioralhealthproblemsmayposeim-
portant public health consequences given that increasing so-
cietal discrimination can be a nationwide (and to some de-
greeinternational)phenomenon.Thebehavioralconsequences
of adolescent exposure to public expressions of discrimina-
tion may warrant public health attention.
