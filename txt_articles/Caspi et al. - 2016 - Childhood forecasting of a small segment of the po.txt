Abstract
Policy-makers are interested in early-years interventions to ameliorate childhood risks. They hope 
for improved adult outcomes in the long run, bringing return on investment. How much return can 
be expected depends, partly, on how strongly childhood risks forecast adult outcomes. But there is 
disagreement about whether childhood determines adulthood. We integrated multiple nationwide 
administrative databases and electronic medical records with the four-decade Dunedin birth-cohort 
study to test child-to-adult prediction in a different way, by using a population-segmentation 
approach. A segment comprising one-fifth of the cohort accounted for 36% of the cohort’s injury 
insurance-claims; 40% of excess obese-kilograms; 54% of cigarettes smoked; 57% of hospital 
nights; 66% of welfare benefits; 77% of fatherless childrearing; 78% of prescription fills; and 81% 
of criminal convictions. Childhood risks, including poor age-three brain health, predicted this 
segment with large effect sizes. Early-years interventions effective with this population segment 
could yield very large returns on investment.
Around the world, the population is aging and total fertility rates are declining. As a result, 
nations increasingly view children and young people as valuable resources for the economic 
and social wellbeing of whole societies. This view is accompanied by public-policy interest 
in early interventions to help as many children as possible achieve their full potential. A key 
question concerns how much potential impact might be brought about by interventions in the 
early years of children’s lives 1,2. Research teams that have followed up small samples of 
children who were enrolled in intervention experiments carried out decades ago point to

 reductions in school leaving, unemployment, crime, overweight, and even blood 
pressure 3–6. Some argue that today’s better-designed interventions might achieve greater 
reductions in adult problems than yesteryear’s efforts 7–11. Others assert that interventions 
for the youngest children will bring even greater return on investment, compared to 
interventions that begin when children are older 12. However, a skeptic could point out that 
return on investment for society will depend not only on an intervention’s capacity to 
ameliorate childhood risks, but also on how relevant those risks are for downstream adult 
functioning in the general population. Thus, to a large extent, the question of how much 
early-years intervention can lift health and social wellbeing and reduce costs depends on 
how strongly early-years risk factors are tied to adult outcomes in the population. Our own 
research and that of others suggests that while childhood risk factors do predict adult 
outcomes with statistical significance, the effect sizes are typically modest 13–15. The 
interpretation of these modest child-to-adult effect sizes is polarizing, and has sown 
confusion among scientists, policy makers, and the public 16–18. On the one hand, claims are 
made that the ‘child is father of the man,’ because continuity from childhood risks to adult 
outcomes is stronger than expected, given the long duration of follow-up. On the other hand, 
on the basis of the same data, warnings are issued about the myth of early-childhood 
determinism and about unwarranted over-emphasis on childhood.
Here we tackled the prediction question anew in the context of the Dunedin Longitudinal 
Study, a population-representative 1972-73 birth cohort of 1,037 New Zealanders assessed at 
ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years and followed from birth to midlife 
with 95% retention (Supplemental Material). We first integrated our longitudinal survey data 
and clinical data with multiple nationwide government administrative databases and 
electronic medical records. Then, using a novel segmentation approach, we tested the 
hypothesis that a small segment of the adult population accounts for large cumulative 
economic burden and that this segment can be predicted with good accuracy from early 
childhood.
Results
Throughout the cohort’s childhood, during the first decade of life, we measured risk factors 
that are thought to augur poor adult outcomes: growing up in a socioeconomically deprived 
family, exposure to maltreatment, low IQ, and poor self-control. We report these four risk 
factors here because they are proven predictors of adult health and social outcomes and are 
high-priority targets in many early-years intervention programs 19–21. A strength of this 
analysis is that all childhood risk predictors were measured prospectively, unbiased by 
participants’ knowledge of their adult outcomes.
At the most recent follow-up assessment when the cohort reached age 38, roughly the 
midpoint in the human lifespan, we drew on personal interviews and on New Zealand’s 
multiple nationwide administrative databases and electronic medical records to ascertain the 
cumulative distributions of economically burdensome outcomes in eight social and health 
sectors. This article refers to these outcomes as ‘economically burdensome’ because, in each 
instance, these are events, behaviours, and conditions that saddle society and government 
with both direct and indirect costs. These are also the same outcomes that early-years

 interventions hope to reduce 22. We predicted: social welfare dependency, fatherless child-
rearing (defined by the absence of the biological father from the households in which a 
cohort member’s offspring live), tobacco smoking, excess body weight, admissions to 
taxpayer-funded national-health-service hospitals, taxpayer-funded prescription drug fills, 
taxpayer-funded insurance claims paid out for accidents and injuries, and convictions for 
crime (Figure 1). Analyses tested how strongly childhood risks predicted these economically 
burdensome outcomes in this cohort.
Prospective-longitudinal cohort studies have tackled the prediction question before 23. Here 
we draw attention to two infrequently tried approaches to prediction. Our first fresh 
approach was to predict the concentration of each economically burdensome behaviour by 
focusing on its cumulative distribution across the cohort. Typically, prediction has focused 
on dimensional outcomes, such as the number of crime convictions accrued by a person, or 
nominal outcomes, such as whether the person is a convicted offender or not. Instead, we 
noted that most economically burdensome outcomes have a markedly skewed distribution, 
and accordingly defined our prediction target as the small group of cohort members who 
could be considered high-cost because they accounted for an excessive amount of an 
outcome (e.g., a few individuals account for the majority of criminal convictions and are 
thus high-cost users of the criminal justice sector). To define this concentration, we followed 
the lead of Vilfredo Pareto who, over 100 years ago, observed that 80% of ‘effects’ emanate 
from 20% of ‘sources’ 24. In Pareto’s day, the problem definition was that 20% of families 
owned 80% of land in Italy. The so-called Pareto principle is alive and useful today: For 
example, in software engineering, 20% of the code is said to contain 80% of the errors 25. 
Here, we studied each outcome variable measured in units that could be meaningfully 
counted (e.g., tobacco pack-years, hospital bednights, prescription fills, criminal convictions, 
etc.). Such measures allowed us to identify the minority of individuals who accounted for 
the majority of each economically burdensome outcome.
Our second fresh approach was to predict the aggregation of different types of economically 
burdensome behavioural outcomes. Economic analyses of early-years interventions illustrate 
the advantages of estimating costs associated with multiple outcomes 26. However, typical 
approaches to prediction in population studies continue to predict only one outcome at a 
time. We noted that some cohort members appeared to be engaged in economically 
burdensome behaviour across multiple health and social sectors. This observation suggests a 
relatively small population segment may generate a large share of societal costs. If this is 
true, this group would be a high value target for prevention. We hypothesized that predicting 
such “aggregated concentration” would yield stronger estimates of prediction from 
childhood to adulthood than reported in previous research. We analyzed aggregation as the 
second step, after analyzing concentration.
Adult outcomes were concentrated as anticipated from the Pareto principle (or ‘80–20 rule’). 
Cumulative distribution functions showed that, in each of the eight social and health sectors 
where we collected data, 20% of individuals consistently accounted for a disproportionate 
share (close to 80%) of the outcome (Figure 1, Panels A–H). These distributions led us to 
operationally define a high-cost group in each sector as 20% of the cohort members who 
accounted for a disproportionate share in that sector.

 We observed that members of the high-cost group in every sector could be differentiated 
from their peers by the same four childhood disadvantages: they tended to have grown up in 
more socioeconomically deprived environments; experienced child maltreatment; scored 
poorly on childhood IQ tests; and exhibited low childhood self-control (Table 1). The 
predictions were fairly uniform across each of the eight different social and health sectors, 
with the exception of injury claims. In addition to being less concentrated within a high-cost 
group, injury claims were less strongly associated with childhood risk factors.
Figure 1 and Table 1 both focus on one sector at a time. However, a heat-map (Figure 2, 
Panels A and B) showed that high-cost group members in one sector were often significantly 
more likely to reappear as high-cost in other sectors too, and that the observed distribution of 
high-cost individuals across multiple sectors deviated from the distribution that would be 
expected if the high-cost groups were independent, χ2 (7, N=940)= 2103.44, p<0.001. The 
fact that membership in one high-cost group is associated with greater likelihood of 
membership in other high-cost groups re-framed the prediction question: How well could 
childhood risks predict the number of high-cost groups to which an individual belonged?
At a population level, each of the childhood factors was a statistically significant predictor of 
risk for belonging to more high-cost groups (Table 2, Panels A & B). Prediction was the 
same when men and women were analyzed separately (Supplemental Material). However, 
this population-level analysis did not answer the question of whether childhood factors were 
useful in predicting the outcome of an individual child 27. We evaluated the accuracy of 
individual predictions by applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. A 
ROC curve plots the sensitivity and specificity of prediction at various thresholds and yields 
a metric indexing predictive accuracy: the Area Under the Curve 28. The Area Under the 
Curve reflects the probability of correctly classifying any randomly selected pair of cohort 
members in which one person belongs to a high-cost group and the other does not. It can 
take on any value between 0.50 (indicating chance prediction) and 1.00 (indicating perfect 
prediction). Some pundits grade the values as: worthless (0.5–0.6), poor (0.6–0.7), fair (0.7–
0.8), good (0.8–0.9), and excellent (0.9–1.0). Behavioural scientists note that AUC values of 
0.54, 0.64, and 0.71 correspond to Cohen’s d values of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80, which are 
regarded as small, medium, and large effects, respectively 29. Using the standards of medical 
research, values approaching 0.8 suggest adequate discrimination for consideration in 
decision-making aboutintervention 30.
The four childhood risks predicted which cohort members belonged to any particular single 
high-cost group with poor-to-fair accuracy (Figure 3, Panel A). However, as hypothesized, 
prediction improved when we turned to predict who belonged to multiple high-cost groups 
(Figure 3, Panel B). Hereafter this article refers to individuals who belonged to three or more 
high-cost outcome groups as the “multiple-high-cost population segment.” The multiple-
high-cost segment comprised 22% of the Dunedin cohort (N = 207 of 940 cohort members). 
Childhood socio-economic deprivation, maltreatment, low IQ, and poor self-control 
predicted these multiple-high-cost adults with considerable accuracy, as indicated by an 
Area Under the Curve of 0.87 (approaching excellent). To answer the question of whether 
accurate prediction of the multiple-high-cost segment capitalized on the fact that high-cost 
membership in one particular sector (e.g., crime sector, welfare sector, etc.) could be

 predicted well, sensitivity analyses were undertaken, in which each high-cost group was left 
out one sector at a time, in turn. Results showed that accurate prediction was not simply an 
artifact of predicting well in any one sector (Figure 3, Panel C).
Our prediction was based on risk measures (familial socioeconomic characteristics, 
maltreatment, IQ, and self-control) that we constructed using repeated measurements 
collected across the first decade of children’s lives. However, multi-wave risk measurement 
is not a realistic standard that can be achieved by many other studies, nor implemented by 
policy analysts. Moreover, multi-wave measures from birth to age-11 years did not address 
the possible importance of early-childhood interventions targeting preschoolers. As such, we 
asked: how well could outcomes be predicted from a single brief evaluation of each child, 
using a standard pediatric assessment during the preschool years?
At age three years, each child in the cohort participated in a 45-minute examination that 
included assessments of neurological soft signs, intelligence, receptive language, and motor 
skills, and afterwards the examiners (having no prior knowledge of the child) rated each 
child’s frustration tolerance, resistance, restlessness, impulsivity, and lack of persistence in 
reaching goals. This examination yielded a summary index we have termed brain health, a 
global index of the three-year-old’s neurocognitive status 31 (Supplemental Material). 
Variation in age-three brain health significantly predicted economically burdensome 
outcomes in each sector, except injury claims (Table 3). Moreover, variation in cohort 
members’ age-three brain health predicted with considerable accuracy which individuals 
would 35 years later be members of the multiple-high cost segment, with an Area Under the 
Curve of 0.79 (Figure 3, Panel D).
Is this multiple-high-cost population segment a priority prevention target? This group was 
operationally defined as individuals belonging to three or more high-cost groups. They made 
up only 22% of their age cohort born in one year in one city. However, they left a big 
footprint on costs of service delivery (Figure 4, Panel A). By age 38 years they used 66% of 
the birth cohort’s welfare benefits; accounted for 77% of the next generation’s years 
growing up fatherless; smoked 54% of the cohort’s tobacco cigarettes; carried 40% of the 
cohort’s kilograms of overweight; occupied 57% of their cohort’s hospital bed-nights; filled 
78% of all prescriptions; were convicted for 81% of the crimes charged to the cohort; and 
even made a disproportionate number (36%) of injury claims. In contrast, the data also 
reveal a substantial segment of the cohort (30%) who did not belong to the high-cost group 
in any sector. Figure 4, Panel B shows that this group has left an unusually small footprint on 
their society so far.
Discussion
This research yielded two results. First, the study uncovered a population segment that 
featured as high-cost across multiple health and social sectors. This illustrates the potential 
discovery value offered by data integration of multiple longitudinal administrative databases 
and electronic health records. Without such data, this population segment would have 
remained hidden. Second, by linking administrative data with individual-level longitudinal 
data, the study provides the strongest effect sizes yet measuring the connection between an

 at-risk childhood and costly adult outcomes in the population. The prediction was excellent 
when it relied on multiple risk factors measured during the first decade of children’s lives, 
and was still good when it relied on information derived from a relatively brief assessment 
of brain health when the children were three years old. Given two three-year-old children 
(one who grew up to belong to multiple high-cost groups and one who grew up to belong to 
none), the model was able to classify them accurately 80% of the time. If this pattern of 
findings is replicated elsewhere, it will imply that early-years interventions, if efficiently 
effective with this population segment, have the opportunity to make very large reductions in 
economic burden. How much economic burden can be reduced remains an empirical 
question at present. However, historical interventions that have targeted children on the basis 
of low IQ have proven effective with good a rate of return, giving reason for optimism 32.
This research has limitations. First, results reflect the New Zealand context and a specific 
historical period. New Zealand is a useful laboratory because it suffers income inequalities 
similar to the USA and the UK (after-tax Gini coefficient: NZ=0.33, UK=0.34, US=0.37) 33, 
spends a comparable amount on health care (NZ=10%, UK=9%, US=17% of GDP) 34, has a 
national health-care system, and, has a generous social safety net. Nevertheless, 
geographical and generational variations require investigation. Second, using 20% to 
identify a vital proportion of the population may seem arbitrary, but rather than choosing a 
sample-specific operant, we chose the Pareto principle a priori as a useful rule-of-thumb 
because it is familiar to researchers, policy makers, and the public. Third, the data were 
right-hand censored at age 38 years, and we could not test how well early childhood risks 
predict economically burdensome outcomes across the full life course. This is an important 
question because the health-care burden of developed societies concentrates in older age 
groups. To the extent that factors such as smoking, excess weight, and health problems 
during midlife foretell health-care burden and social dependency, findings here should 
extend to later life (keeping in mind that midlife smoking, overweight, and health problems 
also forecast premature mortality). Fourth, this article addresses the strength of prediction 
only; we did not address causal mechanisms behind the predictive associations reported 
here. Whether the risk factors studied here are causal, or whether they mediate other prior 
causal influences, the finding that economically burdensome adult outcomes are predictable 
from these early-life factors with moderate to strong effects suggests that these risk factors 
are not unreasonable targets for randomized experimental intervention trials. Moreover, 
many interventions have treated risk factors that are not root causes, and improved outcome 
nevertheless. Fifth, we are unable to directly compare costs across sectors because we did 
not monetize outcomes within each sector. Although the multiple high-cost group is clearly 
‘expensive’, we did not convert each of our outcomes (e.g., pack years of smoking, criminal 
convictions, injury insurance claims) to (New Zealand) dollars, for the following three 
reasons: Monetizing outcomes is informative when evaluating return on investment of an 
intervention of known cost, but we did not study an intervention26. Monetizing costs is not 
without assumptions, and estimates are time- and place-specific. Compared to New-Zealand-
specific monetized estimates the concentration metric reported here will be a more feasible 
target for replication and extension studies. The concentration metric can be used, for 
example, to ask whether high-cost groups aggregate to the same extent in different times and 
places, whether the same risk factors predict a multiple-high-cost group across time and

 place, and how historical events such as economic recessions or immigration affect high-cost 
distributions.
As a final limitation, we are aware that from a different perspective, the economically 
burdensome behaviours we have studied can be considered economically generative, or at 
least neutral. Smokers fuel the tobacco industry; crime provides jobs in policing, courts, and 
corrections; hospital admissions, prescription fills, and injury insurance claims animate 
health-care and pharmaceutical industries. Such cost-benefit analyses were beyond our 
scope. Moreover, it is not we who designated these outcomes as burdensome; rather, we 
selected them because they are oft-cited long-term targets of early-years intervention 
policy 22,35
This research revealed a predictable aggregation of different economically-burdensome adult 
outcomes in the same multiple-high-cost segment of the population. This aggregation has 
implications for methodology, prevention science, and human rights. Methodologically, the 
finding illustrates that social-science research on risk prediction can benefit from 
considering the accumulation of outcomes within a life. Social scientists have observed that 
failure to aggregate information about risk predictors results in small or null effects in 
prediction 36,37, but the recommendation to aggregate has typically been applied only to 
predictor variables, such as when studying cumulative disadvantage or adverse childhood 
experiences 38 39. We turned this recommendation on its head, by showing how aggregating 
outcome variables, not just predictors, can improve effect sizes in longitudinal prediction 
research. Such aggregation has been used in medical epidemiology, for example to index the 
cumulative deficits associated with aging 40, but it is rarely used in the social and 
behavioural sciences. Treatment studies, as well as observational studies, can make use of 
this principle to more comprehensively evaluate impact. Moreover, health, social, and justice 
sectors might benefit from understanding that the bulk of their services are going to the same 
clients.
The finding also has implications for early-years prevention science 2,41–43. We sought to 
inform a question which nags the behavioural and social sciences, and which has strategic 
consequences for national policy on children: How strong is the connection between 
childhood risk and future costly life-course outcomes? Results reported here suggest that the 
importance of childhood risks for poor adult outcomes has generally been underestimated. It 
is not news to service-delivery professionals that some individuals use more than their share 
of services. What is news is that individuals feature in multiple service sectors and they can 
be identified as children, with reasonable accuracy. The question for intervention science 
becomes not just “what works?” but “what works for this multiple-high-cost population 
segment of children?”
Finally, the finding has implications for human rights. We aimed to test if population 
segmentation could give a more accurate evidence base to clarify the need for early-years 
intervention. We are aware of potential for misuse; population segments are often 
stigmatized and stereotyped. However, the predictions reported here make clear that the 
most costly adults in our cohort started the race of life from a starting block somewhere 
behind the rest, and while carrying a heavy handicap in brain health. Such a disadvantaged

 citizen is unlikely to be able to cover his or her share of health and social costs, but there is 
no merit in blaming the victim for economic burden following from childhood disadvantage. 
Instead, ameliorating the effects of childhood disadvantage is an important aim 44,45 and 
achieving this through early-years support for families and children could benefit all 
members of a society.
Method
A more detailed report of the study design, measurement, and statistical analysis is provided 
in the Supplemental Material.
Dunedin Study Sample
Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, 
which tracks the development of 1,037 individuals born in 1972–1973 in Dunedin, New 
Zealand 46.
Measuring economic-burden outcomes
We drew on personal interviews and on New Zealand’s multiple nationwide administrative 
databases and electronic medical records to ascertain the cumulative distributions of eight 
economically burdensome outcomes (Figure 1, Panels A–H):
(Panel A) Social welfare benefit-months—Using record linkage, we collected 
information about social welfare benefits received from the New Zealand Ministry of Social 
Development. The cohort accumulated 24,997 months of welfare payments between January 
1993 and March 2012 (approximately age 21 to 38). The cumulative distribution of benefit 
months revealed that 20% of the cohort accounted for 80% of the months of social welfare 
benefits received by the cohort. These individuals constituted a high-cost group in the social 
welfare sector.
(Panel B) Fatherless child-years (defined by the absence of the biological father from the 
households in which a cohort member’s offspring live). Using Life History Calendars, we 
recorded information about childbirths and living arrangements of all cohort members’ 
offspring (until each reached age 18 years). In the cohort, 669 parents produced 1,418 live 
births. These offspring lived a total of 10,946 child-years of which 25% (2,755 child-years) 
were spent in households without their biological fathers. 20% of the cohort accounted for 
82% of their offsprings’ fatherless years. These individuals constituted a high-cost group in 
the fatherless-children sector.
(Panel C) Tobacco smoking pack-years—In repeated personal interviews, we 
gathered details about tobacco smoking and calculated the number of pack-years smoked, 
where pack-years = (number of cigarettes smoked per day × number of years smoked) / 20); 
one pack-year = 7,305 cigarettes. The cohort smoked 5,760 pack-years, the equivalent of 
42,076,800 cigarettes. 20% of the cohort accounted for 68% of the pack years smoked. 
These individuals constituted a high-cost group in the smoking sector.

 (Panel D) Excess obese kilograms—We measured height and weight during 
anthropometric assessments. By early midlife, the cohort had put on 2,924 kilograms of 
excess weight, defined as the total number of kilograms beyond a BMI > 30, the recognized 
cut-off for obesity; thus, a person with a BMI <= 30 carries 0 kilograms of excess obese 
kilograms whereas the excess weight of a person with a BMI > 30 is their actual weight 
minus the weight predicted for a BMI = 30 based on their height. 20% of the cohort 
accounted for 98% of excess weight in the cohort. These individuals constituted a high-cost 
group in the excess weight sector.
(Panel E) Hospital bed-nights—We obtained details of admission events to public 
hospitals from Ministry of Health records. The cohort accumulated 8,958 bed-nights in the 
hospital from January 1988 to March 2012. 20% of the cohort accounted for 77% of hospital 
bed-nights in the cohort. These individuals constituted a high-cost group in the hospital-stay 
sector.
(Panel F) Prescription drug-fills—We obtained information about prescription drugs 
filled by pharmacists, as indicated on the nation-wide Pharmaceutical Management Agency 
database. The cohort filled 66,811 prescriptions between January 2006 and March 2012. 
20% of the cohort accounted for 89% of prescriptions. These individuals constituted a high-
cost group in the prescription fill sector.
(Panel G) Injury insurance-claims—We obtained records of insurance claims for 
accidents and injuries from the Accident Compensation Corporation, the national provider 
of comprehensive, no-fault personal injury cover for New Zealanders. The cohort made 
6,919 claims between January 1993 and March 2012. The concentration was not as 
pronounced for this outcome as for others, perhaps owing to the random nature of many 
accidents and injuries. Nevertheless, 20% of the cohort accounted for 52% of injury claims 
in the cohort. These individuals constituted a high-cost group in the injury claim sector.
(Panel H) Convictions for crime—We obtained information about criminal convictions 
by searching records available to the New Zealand Police. The cohort had 2,141 convictions 
for adult crimes (excluding routine traffic offenses), beginning at age 15. The concentration 
was more pronounced for this outcome than for others: 20% of the cohort accounted for 
97% of convictions in the cohort. These individuals constituted a high-cost group in the 
crime sector.
Measuring childhood risk factors
We measured risk factors that are thought to augur poor adult outcomes. All risk factor 
measures have been described in previous reports about this cohort.
Childhood socioeconomic status 47
Childhood socioeconomic status was defined as the average of the highest occupational 
status level of either parent across study assessments from the Study member’s birth through 
11 years (1=unskilled laborer; 6=professional), on New Zealand’s occupational rating of the 
1970s.

 Childhood maltreatment 48
Childhood maltreatment 48 includes evidence of (1) maternal rejection assessed at age 3 
years by observational ratings of mothers’ interaction with the study children, (2) harsh 
discipline assessed at ages 7 and 9 years by parental report of disciplinary behaviours, (3) 2 
or more changes in the child’s primary caregiver, and (4) physical abuse and (5) sexual 
abuse reported by study members once they reached adulthood. For each child, our 
cumulative index counts the number of maltreatment indicators during the first decade of 
life; 63.7% of children experienced no maltreatment, 26.7% experienced 1 indicator of 
maltreatment (hereinafter “probable” maltreatment), and 9.6% experienced 2 or more 
indicators of maltreatment (“definite” maltreatment).
Childhood intelligence (IQ) 13
Childhood intelligence (IQ) 13 was measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children – Revised (WISC-R) administered at ages 7, 9, and 11 years. IQ scores for the 
three ages were averaged and standardized.
Childhood self-control 13
Childhood self-control 13 during the first decade of life was measured using nine measures 
of self-control: observational ratings of children’s lack of control (ages 3 and 5 years) and 
parent, teacher, and self-reports of hyperactivity, lack of persistence, inattention, impulsive 
aggression and impulsivity (ages 5, 7, 9, and 11 years). The nine measures were positively 
and significantly correlated. Based on principal components analysis, the standardized 
measures were averaged into a single composite comprising multiple ages and informants, 
with strong internal reliability α = 0.86.
Age-3 brain health
At age 3 years, each child in the cohort participated in a 45-minute examination that 
included assessments of neurological soft signs, intelligence, receptive language, and motor 
skills, and afterwards the examiners (having no prior knowledge of the child) rated each 
child’s behaviour. Using this information, we created a summary factor score via 
confirmatory factor analysis which we termed brain health, a global index of the child’s 
early neurocognitive status 31.
Statistical analysis
We began our work by examining the cumulative distributions of each of the eight outcomes 
(Figure 1). Using these distributions, we operationally defined a high-cost group in each 
sector as 20% of the cohort members who accounted for a disproportionate share of 
economically burdensome behaviour in that sector.
We tested associations between childhood risk factors and growing up to be a member of a 
high-cost group using modified Poisson regression models to estimate risk ratios (RR). We 
then added up (0–8) the number of high-cost groups to which each individual belonged and 
used Negative Binomial regressions to model incident rate ratios (IRR). We followed up this 
analysis to test associations between childhood risk factors and membership in the multiple-

(ROC) curve analysis to estimate each individual’s probability of belonging to a high-cost 
group in society based on their childhood risks.

Measuring the concentration of economic-burden outcomes in a birth cohort. The data 
represent information about 940 people who were born in one hospital in 1972-73 and are 
life-long participants in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. The panels show that a minority of 
individuals accounts for a majority of outcomes in a birth cohort, in each of 8 different social 
and health sectors: social welfare (Panel A), fatherless children (Panel B), smoking (Panel 
C), excess obese kilograms (Panel D), hospital stays (Panel E), prescription fills (Panel F), 
injury claims (Panel G), and crime (Panel H). Each Panel displays the cumulative 
distribution of an outcome in the cohort. To find the proportion of each outcome that 20% of 
the population accounts for, start at 20% on the vertical axis and follow arrow 1 to the right,

The aggregation of adult economic-burden outcomes. The polychoric correlations in Panel 
A show that high-cost group members in one sector were significantly more likely to re-
appear as high-cost in other sectors. Panel B shows that the distribution of high-cost 
individuals across multiple sectors deviated from the expectation of a random distribution, 
χ2 (7, N = 940) = 2103.44, p < 0.001, with excesses at the two tails (i.e., there are more 
people than expected who do not belong to any high-cost group and there are more people 
than expected who belong to multiple high-cost groups). The expected distribution is based

chance. The observed:expected ratios in each cell are: 1.83, .80, .71, .52, 1.45, 5.09, 16.89,

Predicting the probability of economic-burden outcomes. In Panels A-C we tested the 
predictive performance of a model that included information about four childhood risk 
factors. We assessed discrimination (that is, the model’s ability to classify correctly) using 
the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). The diagonal line in each 
panel indicates random classification. Points above the diagonal represent good (better than 
random) classification results. Panel A shows that childhood factors only modestly 
predicted which cohort members belonged to any particular single high-cost group. Panel B 
shows that classification improved when predicting who belonged to multiple high-cost 
groups. Panel C shows the results of a leave-one-out analysis and documents that accurate 
prediction was not simply an artifact of predicting one high-cost group well. Panel D shows 
that, reaching back to early childhood, age-3 brain health predicted which cohort members 
belonged to multiple high-cost groups. All models included sex. Models in Panels A-C 
included childhood socioeconomic status (SES), childhood maltreatment, IQ,and self-

The big footprint of multiple-high-cost users. Panel A shows that although the multiple-
high-cost group made up only 22% of the cohort (N = 207), it accounted for a 
disproportionate share of economic-burden outcomes across all 8 health and social sectors 
that we examined. In contrast, Panel B shows that a substantial segment of the cohort did 
not belong to any high-cost group (30%; N = 289) and left an unusually light footprint on 
society.

Childhood predictors of economic-burden outcomes in a birth cohort. The Table shows that children who grew up in socioeconomically deprived 
environments, who experienced child maltreatment, who scored more poorly on childhood IQ tests, and who exhibited less self-control were more likely 
to belong to a high-cost economic burden group as adults, in each of 8 different sectors.

Childhood socioeconomic status (SES), IQ, and self-control are standardized z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1); childhood maltreatment is coded as 0 = none, 1 = probable, 2 = definite maltreatment. All models 
control for sex. Prediction was the same when men and women were analyzed separately (see Supplemental materials for details).

Table 2
Childhood predictors of economic-burden outcomes in a birth cohort. Panel A shows that children who grew up in socioeconomically deprived 
environments, who experienced child maltreatment, who scored more poorly on childhood IQ tests, and who exhibited less self-control were more likely 
to belong  to more high-cost economic-burden groups in adulthood (ranging from 0–8). PanelB shows that these childhood factors differentiated a group 
of cohort members who became, as adults, members of the multiple-high-cost segment of their society.

Table 3
Variation in children’s age-3 brain health predicted which children belonged to high-cost economic-burden 
groups, 35 years later. Panel A shows that variation in age-3 brain health predicted who was more likely to 
belong to a high-cost group in adulthood, in each of 8 different sectors. Panel B shows that age-3 brain health 
predicted the number of high-cost groups (ranging from 0–8) to which each cohort member belonged. Panel C 
shows that age-3 brain health differentiated cohort members who became, as adults, members of the multiple-
high-cost segment of their society.
