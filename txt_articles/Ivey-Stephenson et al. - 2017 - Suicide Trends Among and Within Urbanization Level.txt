Abstract
Problem/Condition: Suicide is a public health problem and one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. 
Substantial geographic variations in suicide rates exist, with suicides in rural areas occurring at much higher rates than those 
occurring in more urban areas. Understanding demographic trends and mechanisms of death among and within urbanization 
levels is important to developing and targeting future prevention efforts.
Reporting Period: 2001–2015.
Description of System: Mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) include demographic, geographic, and 
cause of death information derived from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NVSS was used to 
identify suicide deaths, defined by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause of death codes 
X60–X84, Y87.0, and U03. This report examines annual county level trends in suicide rates during 2001–2015 among and within 
urbanization levels by select demographics and mechanisms of death. Counties were collapsed into three urbanization levels using 
the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics classification scheme.
Results: Suicide rates increased across the three urbanization levels, with higher rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties than in 
medium/small or large metropolitan counties. Each urbanization level experienced substantial annual rate changes at different times 
during the study period. Across urbanization levels, suicide rates were consistently highest for men and non-Hispanic American 
Indian/Alaska Natives compared with rates for women and other racial/ethnic groups; however, rates were highest for non-Hispanic 
whites in more metropolitan counties. Trends indicate that suicide rates for non-Hispanic blacks were lowest in nonmetropolitan/
rural counties and highest in more urban counties. Increases in suicide rates occurred for all age groups across urbanization levels, 
with the highest rates for persons aged 35–64 years. For mechanism of death, greater increases in rates of suicide by firearms and 
hanging/suffocation occurred across all urbanization levels; rates of suicide by firearms in nonmetropolitan/rural counties were 
almost two times that of rates in larger metropolitan counties.
Interpretation: Suicide rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties are consistently higher than suicide rates in metropolitan counties. 
These trends also are observed by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death.
Public Health Action: Interventions to prevent suicides should be ongoing, particularly in rural areas. Comprehensive suicide 
prevention efforts might include leveraging protective factors and providing innovative prevention strategies that increase access 
to health care and mental health care in rural communities. In addition, distribution of socioeconomic factors varies in different 
communities and needs to be better understood in the context of suicide prevention.
Introduction
Suicides, the fatal component of suicidal behavior, result 
from an interaction of individual, interpersonal, social, and

environmental influences (1). These deaths take a toll on society. 
In 2015, suicide ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the 
United States and was the cause of 44,193 deaths (2). One of 
the Healthy People 2020 objectives is to reduce suicides by 10% 
(from 11.3 suicides per 100,000 population in 2007 to 10.2 
by 2020); however, during 2005–2015 the age-adjusted suicide 
rate increased 21.6% whereas many other causes of mortality 
have declined (3,4). The increase has been manifested across

multiple demographic groups (3). One study, after adjusting 
for underreporting, estimated the 2013 U.S. national cost of 
suicide and suicide attempts at $93.5 billion (5).
Patterns of suicide have been associated with various 
sociodemographic characteristics. For example, in the United 
States, suicide rates are higher for males than for females and 
for adults aged ≥45 years than for adolescents and young 
adults; overall rates are higher for non-Hispanic white and 
American Indian/Alaska Native populations than for other 
racial/ethnic groups (6). Recent trends have demonstrated an 
increase in suicides, particularly among working age adults 
aged 45–64 years (3). Previous studies have documented 
regional and state differences in suicide rates in the United 
States (7–10). Suicide rates tend to be higher in the West than 
in the South, Midwest, and Northeast. In at least one study, 
regional differences in demographic patterns (i.e., age, race/
Hispanic ethnicity, and sex) did not account for variations in 
suicide rates (7), indicating that some other factor, possibly 
population density (11), might be influencing the differences. 
An analysis of urban-rural differences focused on specific 
age groups (e.g., youths and older adults) and highlighted 
the disparities (8,9). In addition, the level of urbanization 
is associated with suicide rates. One study analyzed death 
certificate data during 1999–2015 and reported that suicide 
rates in less urban areas are higher than in more urban areas and 
the gap in rates has been widening (10). This report analyzes 
death certificate data during 2001–2015 to describe patterns 
of suicide by level of urbanization, demographic characteristics, 
and mechanism of death in the United States. Public health 
professionals and prevention program staff can use the data to 
identify specific populations in need of targeted interventions 
to address suicide rates.
Methods
The National Vital Statistics System annual compressed 
mortality data files during 2001–2015 were used to identify 
suicides using International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause of death codes X60–X84, 
Y87.0, and U03, excluding foreign residents (12). Three-
year moving averages were used to reduce the variability of a 
small number of observations in a particular period. Working 
backward from 2015 (the most recent data year), 2001 was 
identified as the starting point. Going back further would 
have required the inclusion of 1998 data, which use the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) 
for coding cause of death, rather than ICD-10 codes. Children 
aged <10 years (74 deaths) were excluded because intent for 
self-harm is not usually attributed to young children. Annual 
suicide counts were summarized using the 2006 National 
Center for Health Statistics urban-rural classification scheme 
for counties (13). The six-level 2006 classification scheme was 
selected to coincide with the middle of the study period and 
to align with the results of a recent report on trends by level 
of urbanization (2,10,12). Following are the six classification 
levels for counties:
1. Large central metropolitan is part of a metropolitan 
statistical area with ≥1 million population and includes 
a principal city.
2. Large fringe metropolitan is part of a metropolitan 
statistical area with ≥1 million population but does not 
include a principal city.
3. Medium metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical 
area with ≥250,000 but <1 million population.
4. Small metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical 
area with <250,000 population.
5. Micropolitan (nonmetropolitan) is part of a 
micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of 
≥10,000 but <50,000 population).
6. Noncore (nonmetropolitan) is not part of a 
metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area.
Levels of urbanization were further collapsed into 
large metropolitan, medium/small metropolitan, and 
nonmetropolitan/rural for selected analyses. Large metropolitan 
includes counties from large central metropolitan and large 
fringe metropolitan areas. Medium/small metropolitan 
includes counties from medium and small metropolitan areas. 
Nonmetropolitan/rural includes counties from micropolitan 
and noncore areas.
U.S. Census Bureau county level population estimates were 
used to calculate annual suicide rates (per 100,000 population 
among persons aged ≥10 years). Rates were age adjusted to the 
2000 U.S. standard population (3,10). Joinpoint regression 
analyses were used to examine the magnitude and direction of 
the annual trends in suicide rates for each level of urbanization. 
During the study period, there were two joinpoints in the large 
metropolitan counties and one joinpoint in all other levels 
of urbanization at p value <0.05 statistical significance level. 
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, North Carolina) and Joinpoint version 4.4.0 (Statistical 
Methodology and Applications Branch, Surveillance Research 
Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland) 
software.

Results
During 2001–2015, a total of 256,511 suicides were 
reported in large metropolitan, 173,045 in medium/small 
metropolitan, and 114,559 in nonmetropolitan/rural counties 
(Table). Joinpoint regression analyses indicated increases in 
annual age-adjusted suicide rates across the three urbanization 
levels during the study period, with counties in more urban 
areas having the lowest suicide rates and counties in less urban 
areas having the highest suicide rates (Figure 1). In large 
metropolitan counties, annual suicide rates decreased during 
2001–2005, then increased during 2005–2010; these changes 
in rates were significant. During 2010–2015, although suicide 
rates continued to increase in large metropolitan counties, these 
increases were not significant. In nonmetropolitan/rural and 
medium/small metropolitan counties, increases in suicide rates 
occurred during 2001–2007 and the increases accelerated in 
2007 and 2008.
Analysis according to sex, race/ethnicity, age group, 
and mechanism of death by urbanization level indicated

† Levels of urbanization were collapsed using the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics urban classification scheme. The six classification levels for counties are 
1) large central metropolitan (part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and includes a principal city); 2) large fringe metropolitan (part of a 
metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population but does not include a principal city); 3) medium metropolitan (part of a metropolitan statistical area with 
≥250,000 but <1 million population); 4) small metropolitan (part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population); 5) micropolitan (nonmetro) (part of a 
micropolitan statistical area [has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population]); and 6) noncore (nonmetropolitan) (not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan 
statistical area). Large metropolitan classification includes counties from large central metropolitan and large fringe metropolitan areas. Medium/small metropolitan 
classification includes counties from medium metropolitan and small metropolitan areas. Nonmetropolitan classification includes counties from micropolitan and 
noncore areas.
§ Joinpoint regression analysis was used to determine annual percentage change with statistically significant trend (p<0.05). Dots indicate the joinpoints. 
gradual increases in suicide rates occurring across the three 
urbanization levels for both males and females, with lower 
rates in large metropolitan counties and higher rates in 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties (Figure 2). The greatest 
rate increases occurred in medium/small metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties for both sexes. Across all 
three urbanization levels, suicide rates for males were four to 
five times higher than for females during the study period. 
By race/ethnicity, rates typically increased in all counties 
across the study period for all racial/ethnic groups, with 
greater increases in the medium/small metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties. Non-Hispanic whites and 
non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives had the 
highest suicide rates across all three urbanization levels, 
with both groups experiencing greater increases compared 
with non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific 
Islanders, and Hispanics across the study period. With the 
exception of non-Hispanic blacks, suicide rates were higher 
in nonmetropolitan/rural counties. During 2001–2015, 
rates for all age groups typically increased, with greater 
increases occurring in medium/small metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties. For all urbanization levels, 
higher rates were observed among persons aged ≥25 years, 
with the highest rates among those aged 35–64 years. Across 
all urbanization levels, firearms were the most often used 
mechanism of death, with rates in nonmetropolitan/rural 
counties almost double those in large metropolitan and 
medium/small metropolitan counties. Greater increases in 
rates of suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation were 
observed across all urbanization levels whereas lesser increases 
in rates of suicide by drug poisoning, nondrug poisoning, and 
other mechanisms were observed during the study period.

Discussion
During 2001–2015, age-adjusted suicide rates for 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties were consistently higher than 
for medium/small and large metropolitan counties. Although 
other studies have documented these differences (10), this 
report examined annual changes in rates by urbanization 
level along with trends among and within urbanization levels 
by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death. A 
closer look at annual rate changes revealed substantial increases 
after 2005 for large metropolitan counties, after 2008 for 
medium/small metropolitan counties, and after 2007 for 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties. Although the Great Recession 
officially began in 2007 and ended in 2009 (14), differential 
effects were observed at different points in different geographic 
areas (14). Economic indicators (e.g., housing foreclosures, 
poverty, and unemployment) vary by urbanization level, with 
rural areas usually having greater prevalence of these negative 
factors (15). Factors such as housing foreclosures and overall 
business cycles negatively affect suicide rates and other health 
outcomes (16–18). A combination of these factors likely 
contributed to the differences in annual suicide rate changes by 
urbanization level observed in this study. In addition, because 
U.S. suicide rates were increasing before the Great Recession, 
other contributors to the changes in rates were likely (19).
The differences observed in suicide rates by sex within 
urbanization levels are consistent with previous findings 
that age-adjusted suicide rates tend to be higher for men 
than for women (3). This difference is maintained regardless 
of urbanization level, with differences most notable in 
nonmetropolitan/rural counties. By race/ethnicity, age-
adjusted suicide rates for non-Hispanic American Indian/
Alaska Natives are consistently the highest, followed by 
rates for non-Hispanic whites across all periods; however, 
when comparing rates by race/ethnicity across urbanization 
levels, suicide rates are highest for non-Hispanic whites in 
metropolitan counties and for non-Hispanic American Indian/
Alaska Natives in nonmetropolitan/rural counties.
CDC released a technical package of policies, programs, 
and practices to prevent suicide that includes examples of 
programs that can be tailored to fit the cultural needs of 
different racial/ethnic groups (20). The technical package is a 
compilation of a core set of strategies, developed using the best 
available evidence, that have the greatest prevention potential. 
For example, a suicide prevention program called Sources of 
Strength was developed with rural and tribal communities in 
North Dakota to promote connectedness between youth and 
adults. The program strategy is to understand and respond to 
underlying causes of suicidal behavior and promote protective 
factors against suicidal behavior to prevent adverse outcomes. 
Sources of Strength is a universal (i.e., programs administered 
to all children in classrooms regardless of individual risk status) 
school-based approach to suicide prevention that is designed to 
build socioecological protective influences across the student 
population. Youth opinion leaders are recruited from diverse 
social backgrounds, including some who are at risk for suicidal 
behavior. They are trained to change the norms and behaviors 
of their peers by conducting well-defined messaging activities 
with adult mentoring (21). Local implementers might need 
to tailor this and other programs discussed in CDC’s technical 
package for suicide prevention to specific cultural practices and 
traditions of tribes in rural areas.
Another notable finding regarding racial/ethnic differences 
by urbanization level was identified from analysis of the total 
age-adjusted rates by urbanization level across the study period. 
For non-Hispanic blacks, suicide rates do not follow the 
historical trend of being highest in rural areas. Except during 
2004–2006, rates for non-Hispanic blacks in rural areas were 
consistently lower than rates for non-Hispanic blacks in urban 
areas, with fluctuations across the entire period. A previous 
study using data from the 1993 National Mortality Followback 
Survey to identify risk and protective factors specific to suicide 
among blacks identified rural residence as a protective factor 
(22). A hypothesis that has been proposed to support this 
finding is that blacks living in urban areas will be more at 
risk for suicide due to the stressors and strains of urban life, 
including unaccustomed social isolation, as well as difficulty 
acculturating to middle-class suburban living (22).
Findings by age group among urbanization levels revealed 
increases in rates for all age groups, with the highest rates 
and greatest rate increases in more rural areas. Within all 
urbanization levels, the highest rates were observed among 
persons aged 35–64 years. This age group has been of particular 
interest given increases in suicide rates among middle-aged 
whites (23). Findings are consistent with those of studies 
that have identified a pattern of increasing mortality among 
non-Hispanic white populations, which is in part attributed 
to increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related 
mortality, especially among persons aged 45–54 years (24). By 
mechanism of death within each urbanization level, firearms 
were the most common, with the highest rates and greatest 
rate increases in rural areas. Among urbanization levels, rates 
for firearms as the mechanism of death in nonmetropolitan/
rural counties were approximately two times the rates of those 
in metropolitan counties. This might be attributed, in part, 
to firearm ownership being more common in rural areas and 
a large number of rural community residents being familiar 
with firearm use (25).

Suicide rates by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and 
mechanism of death for the general population are higher 
in rural communities than in urban areas. In addition to 
considering differences by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and 
mechanism of death, this study underscores the need for 
analyses both among and within urbanization levels with the 
goal of designing and implementing tailored suicide prevention 
efforts. To address suicide in rural areas, the Health Resources 
and Services Administration has developed activities including 
epidemiologic studies, research, and programs for primary 
health care providers. Ongoing work by CDC in suicide 
prevention from a public health perspective, such as programs 
that focus on middle-aged men, a group experiencing one 
of the greatest increases in suicide rates (3), is an important 
step in decreasing overall suicide rates in the United States. 
Prevention practitioners could use these findings to prioritize 
and allocate resources for their rural populations as part of 
efforts to meet the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce the 
suicide rate by 10% (4).
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, mortality data from the compressed 
mortality data file missing information on Hispanic origin 
were excluded when calculating death rates for this group 
(i.e., no corresponding population denominator data are 
available). The small fraction (1,970 [0.0036%]) of suicide 
data excluded might have resulted in a slight underestimation 
of some rates. Second, use of the 2006 six-level classification 
scheme does not reflect a number of county reclassifications 
made in the updated 2013 classification scheme. Although 
these changes are not reflected in this report, fewer than 
10% of counties had different category assignments in the 
two schemes, with the majority of counties shifted to a more 
urban category. The effects of using the earlier classification 
scheme are expected to be minimal. Third, the 2006 National 
Center for Health Statistics six-level county classifications 
were further collapsed into three groups (large metropolitan, 
medium/small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan/rural) for 
comparative purposes. Collapsing these categories from six 
into three might further mask the heterogeneity of certain 
counties. Fourth, on April 3, 2017, CDC released a revised 
data file for 2014 to include corrections affecting 125 deaths 
previously coded to accidental discharge of firearms (ICD-10 
codes W32–W34). Of the 125 deaths, 53 were reclassified 
as intentional self-harm (suicide) by discharge of firearms 
(ICD-10 codes X72–X74). These revisions were not available 
for inclusion in this report; however, substantial differences 
in rates and substantial effects on the results and conclusions 
in this report are not anticipated. Finally, undercounting or 
underreporting could have an impact on the findings. Suicides 
are often undercounted on death certificates and studies have 
indicated they are differentially undercounted for females 
and racial/ethnic minorities; therefore, the suicide rates in 
this report are likely to be underestimates (26). The degree of 
underreporting might also vary by level of urbanization and 
mechanism of death, and misclassification of race/ethnicity on 
death certificates, particularly among the American Indian/
Alaska Native population, could also affect the findings.
Future Directions
Detailed analysis of suicide rates among and within 
urbanization levels by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and 
mechanism of death can provide more comprehensive 
knowledge of national trends and highlight the greater needs 
in rural communities. Although CDC’s technical package to 
prevent suicide might help states and communities focus on 
strategies supported by the best available evidence, ongoing 
evaluation of suicide prevention programs is still necessary to 
advance suicide prevention efforts (20). This study emphasizes 
the need for development and evaluation of suicide prevention 
efforts specific to rural communities. Innovative prevention 
strategies, such as telebehavioral health (i.e., telephone-, 
video-, and web-based technologies), are a promising option 
to increasing access to health care and mental health care in 
rural communities (20); however, rural communities often have 
limited access to the Internet (27). Future analyses might target 
identification of rural communities whose populations are at 
greatest risk for suicide to prioritize Federal Communications 
Commission broadband access needs, furthering telebehavioral 
health approaches and helping to reduce suicide rates.
In the move toward more comprehensive suicide prevention 
approaches, prevention specialists might need to consider 
tailoring specific programs to the needs of various racial/ethnic 
groups for effective prevention efforts. Although all-cause 
mortality rates for blacks are higher than those for whites, 
suicide is the only leading cause of death for which the death 
rate is lower among blacks compared with whites for all age 
groups (28). Among American Indian/Alaska Natives, suicide 
rates in rural areas are substantially higher than the already 
high rates for this population. Future studies should attempt 
to identify risk factors and protective factors for suicide specific 
to racial/ethnic groups.

Conclusion
Nonmetropolitan/rural counties have higher suicide rates 
than medium/small and large metropolitan counties. Over 
the study period, notable changes were observed in rates 
by urbanization level. A combination of factors, including 
economic and health indicators, likely contributed to the 
differences in annual suicide rate changes by urbanization 
level (14–18) observed in this study. Trends in suicide rates 
by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death 
that are observed in the general population indicate that rates 
are consistently higher in rural communities. Findings from 
this study underscore the need to identify protective factors as 
part of comprehensive suicide prevention efforts, particularly 
in rural areas. Additional information on suicide rates in rural 
areas might be used to evaluate current suicide prevention 
efforts and determine which rural communities to prioritize 
when allocating public health and mental health resources.
