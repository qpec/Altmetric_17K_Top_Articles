 Importance—Effective long-term treatments are needed to address the obesity epidemic. There 
are numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet, but it is unclear if these 
are effective at improving weight loss.
Objective—To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss 
intervention (SBWI), a technology-enhanced intervention (EWLI) would result in greater weight 
loss.
Design, Setting, Participants—Randomized trial with participants enrolled between October 
2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014. The study was 
conducted at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA). Participants were randomized to SBWI 
(N=233) or EWLI (N=237) interventions.
Interventions—Participants were placed on a low calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical 
activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months the interventions added telephone 
counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 
months SBWI initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, whereas 
EWLI was provided a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and 
physical activity.
Main Outcome Measure—The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6 
months intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between two groups at 
24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary 
intake.
Results—Among the 470 participants randomized (BMI: 25 to <40 kg/m2; age: 18–35 years; 
28.9% non-white, 77.2% female), 74.5% completed the study. Weight change at 24-months 
differed significantly by intervention groups [estimated mean weight loss of 3.5 kg (95% CI: 2.6, 
4.5) in EWLI and 5.9 kg (95% CI: 5.0, 6.8) in SBWI, difference of 2.4 kg (95% CI 3.7, 1.0), 
p=0.002]. Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical 
activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among young adults with a BMI between 25 to <40 kg/m2, the 
addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less 
weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may 
not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.

INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obesity have high prevalence1 and are associated with numerous health 
conditions.2 Interventions emphasizing both diet and physical activity are effective for 
weight loss, resulting in 6 month weight loss of 8–10% of initial weight.3 However, 
challenges remain to sustaining weight loss long-term.3
There is wide availability of commercial technologies for physical activity and diet.4 These 
technologies include wearable devices to monitor physical activity, with many also including 
an interface to monitor diet. Short-term studies have shown these technologies to result in

 modest improvements in weight loss when added to a behavioral intervention.5,6 These 
technologies may provide a method to improve longer-term weight loss; however, there are 
limited data on the effectiveness of such technologies for modifying health behaviors long-
term.4
This randomized trial examined whether adding wearable technology to a behavioral 
intervention would improve weight loss across 24 months among young adults 18 to 35 
years of age. Additional outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and 
dietary intake.
METHODS
Design
IDEA (Innovative Approaches to Diet, Exercise and Activity) was a randomized clinical trial 
conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, and was one of the studies within the Early Adult 
Reduction of weight through LifestYle intervention (EARLY) Trials consortium, with each 
study implementing a unique intervention in young adults.7 Participants in IDEA were 
randomized to one of two groups. Both groups received a behavioral weight loss 
intervention for 6 months after which the two groups received different interventions until 
month 24. Randomization was to: 1) a behavioral weight loss intervention that, after the 
initial 6 months, added text messaging prompts and a study website containing study-related 
education materials and the ability to self-monitor diet and physical activity behaviors 
(SBWI), or 2) the same intervention described for SBWI but after the initial 6 months the 
study website was only used to access education materials and wearable technology was 
provided along with a web-based interface to monitor physical activity and diet (EWLI). 
Randomization was stratified by sex and race (white or non-white) using a computer 
program that applied randomly selected block sizes of 2 and 4 with the sequence of 
randomization kept confidential to the other investigators. The primary outcome was weight 
change at 24 months.
Participants
Recruitment occurred across 10 recruitment periods that took place between October 2010 
and October 2012 at the University of Pittsburgh using direct mail, mass media 
advertisements, or referral from clinical research registries. Eligibility was assessed based on 
self-reported medical history, and clearance from the participant’s physician was also 
obtained. Procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review 
Board and all participants provided informed consent.
Eligibility criteria included age between 18 to 35 years, body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 
<40.0 kg/m2, access to a cellular telephone that could receive text messages, and a computer 
with internet access. Exclusion criteria have been previously published.8
Intervention
Intervention Contact—Both SBWI and EWLI received regular intervention contact. 
Group-based sessions were scheduled weekly for the initial 6 months and monthly between 
Jakicic et al.

 months 7 to 24. If a participant was unable to attend a scheduled group session, attempts 
were made to engage the participant in a make-up session. Theory-based strategies were 
used to promote adherence to weight loss behaviors.9–13 At each session participants were 
given feedback on weight change and were provided materials to complement the topic of 
the session. Beginning with month 7 these materials were posted on the study website along 
with a weekly behavioral tip.
During months 7 to 24 participants were also scheduled to receive a brief (≤10 minutes) 
individual telephone contact once per month and weekly text messages. The telephone 
contacts were conducted by intervention staff and followed a standard script. Text messages 
were provided once or twice per week, and were used to prompt engagement in weight loss 
behaviors or to remind participants of upcoming intervention sessions. Participants were 
compensated $5 per month to offset the cost of receiving text messages.
Dietary Intervention—Calorie intake in both SBWI and EWLI was prescribed based on 
baseline weight at 1200, 1500, and 1800 kcal/d for individuals who were <90.7 kg, 90.7 to 
<113.4 kg, and ≥113.4 kg, respectively. If weight loss exceeded 6% during each 4 week 
period or if BMI was ≤22 kg/m2, prescribed individual calorie intake was increased. Dietary 
fat was prescribed at 20 to 30% of total calorie intake and sample meal plans were provided 
to facilitate adoption of the prescribed dietary recommendations. During months 1 to 6 
participants were instructed to self-monitor dietary intake in a diary that was returned to the 
interventionists at the conclusion of each week, and the intervention staff provided feedback 
prior to returning diaries to the participants. During months 7 to 24 SBWI self-reported their 
daily intake using a website designed for this study, and this information was available to the 
staff during the intervention telephone contacts. EWLI self-monitored their dietary patterns 
using the technology described below.
Physical Activity—Non-supervised moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in 
both SBWI and EWLI was initially prescribed at 100 minutes per week and increased at 4 
week intervals until a prescription of 300 minutes per week was achieved. Participants were 
instructed to engage in structured forms of MVPA that were ≥10 minutes in duration. During 
months 1 to 6 participants were instructed to self-monitor their MVPA in a diary that was 
returned to the interventionists at the conclusion of each week. The intervention staff 
provided feedback on these diaries. During months 7 to 24 SBWI self-reported their daily 
MVPA using a website designed for this study, and this information was available to the 
staff during the intervention telephone contacts. EWLI self-monitored their MVPA using the 
technology described below.
Technology used within EWLI—EWLI was provided and encouraged to use a 
commercially available wearable technology that included a web-based interface 
(BodyMedia Fit, Pittsburgh, PA). This system included a multi-sensor device worn on the 
upper arm that provided feedback to the participant on energy expenditure and physical 
activity through a small display or through web-based software developed by the 
manufacturer. While the display provided information about total MVPA, the web-based 
software also provided feedback on MVPA performed in durations of ≥10 minutes. The

 web-based software also allowed for self-monitoring of dietary intake. Intervention staff had 
access to this information during the scheduled telephone contacts.
Outcome Assessments
Measures occurred at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants received $100 for completing 
each of the 6, 12, 18, and 24 month assessments. Assessment staff were masked to prior data 
at each assessment to minimize potential bias.
Weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg with the participant clothed in a hospital gown or 
lightweight clothing. Height was measured only at baseline to the nearest 0.1 cm with shoes 
removed. BMI was computed as kg/m2.
Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry from a total body 
scan. Prior to this scan, females had a urine pregnancy test and a positive result excluded the 
participant from further study participation.
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed with a submaximal graded exercise test that was 
performed on a motorized treadmill.8 Oxygen consumption was assessed using a metabolic 
cart.
Physical activity was assessed using a portable device that was worn for one week14,15. Data 
were considered valid if the participant wore the device for ≥10 hours per day for ≥4 days 
during the observation period.16,17 Minute-by-minute data were used to identify minutes and 
MET-min/week of sedentary (awake time, <1.5 metabolic equivalents [METs]), light-
intensity physical activity (LPA: 1.5 to <3.0 METs) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity 
physical activity (MVPA: ≥3.0 METs) physical activity. Percent sedentary time was 
calculated as sedentary time identified by the activity monitor divided by the monitor wear 
time.
Diet over the past month was assessed using the web-based version of the Diet History 
Questionnaire18,19 and DietCalc software (version 1.5.0).
Percent weight loss was included as a post-hoc outcome.
For safety, depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiology 
Studies questionnaire.20 Participants with a score of ≥13 were referred to their primary care 
physician and provided a list of community resources to assist in obtaining treatment. 
Resting blood pressure was assessed following a 5 minute seated resting period using an 
automated system, with systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 
of ≥90 mmHg referred to their primary care physician. Participants were queried regarding 
the occurrence of overnight hospitalizations and conditions to assess for adverse and serious 
adverse events.
Sex, race, ethnicity, education, income, employment status, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, depressive symptoms20 were assessed by self-report using questionnaires.

 Statistical Methods
Sample Size—The mean (standard deviation) weight loss (in kg) from baseline to month 
24 in the SBWI group was projected to be approximately 3.4 kg at 24 months, with these 
estimates based on data from prior weight loss studies that included young adults.21–23 We 
specified 2.3 kg or more average weight loss for EWLI compared to SBWI so that the 
average weight loss in the EWLI group was expected to be 5.7 kg at the end of month 24. 
This would allow EWLI to maintain a clinically meaningful weight loss of at least a 5%.3 
Using a standard deviation of 6.8 kg for both groups, a two-sided t-test at 5% level of 
significance had 90% power to detect a mean difference of 2.3 kg (effect size of .33) 
between EWLI and SBWI if 24 month data were available for at least 191 patients in each 
group. Based on an expected attrition rate of 20%, the recruitment goal was 238 participants 
per group.
Analysis Plan—Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants in the two 
groups. Statistical significance of group differences in distributions was tested using 
Wilcoxon’s test for continuous and Pearson’s chi-square test or exact tests for categorical 
variables, as appropriate.
It was expected that the likelihood of missingness could be predicted by the observed data 
prior to missing so missing data were assumed to be at random and a likelihood-based 
analysis was used. Thus, the primary hypothesis of EWLI achieving different weight loss 
than SBWI was tested by fitting a linear mixed effect model via maximum likelihood with 
weight over time as the outcome, including race, sex, time (assessment, treated as discrete, 
baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), intervention (EWLI vs. SBWI) and intervention by time 
interaction as fixed effects, and participants and recruitment periods as random effects. 
Weights measured during or after pregnancy were excluded from the analyses. Significance 
of the difference in distributions of weight was tested with a likelihood ratio test of the null 
hypothesis H0: β = 0, with β as the coefficient of the intervention by 24 month visit 
interaction in the linear mixed effect model.
For all of the models, if the intervention by time interaction was statistically significant (p < 
0.05), the equality of mean changes in the two intervention groups at each intermediate time 
point was tested. The mean change at each time point, estimated using the least-square 
means, are presented by intervention along with the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals. P-values were adjusted by Holm’s method for multiplicity when the differences 
were tested at multiple time points.24 No adjustment for multiple comparisons were made 
for the primary outcome. P-values for all other secondary outcome analyses were adjusted 
for multiplicity using Holm’s method.
Multiple imputation was used for sensitivity analysis. Specifically, 10 Monte Carlo Markov 
Chain imputations based on the observed variables (intervention group, sex, race, ethnicity, 
education, income, employment status, waist circumference, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, depression, and weights) at previous assessments were used to impute the 
missing weights for the sensitivity analysis. The estimates from the imputed datasets were 
averaged to see if they were similar to the likelihood-based estimates from the primary 
analysis. A similar approach was used for the secondary outcomes.

 Fisher’s exact test conducted separately for each time interval was used for comparing 
adverse events and other alerts. All tests were two-sided and a level of less than 0.05 was 
used as the cut-off for statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using the SAS 
statistical software package (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
This study randomized 471 participants with specific exclusion criteria by participant shown 
in Figure 1. However, prior to the start of the intervention, one participant was discovered to 
be ineligible and was removed from the study. Thus, 470 participants received the 
intervention and are included in the analysis. Descriptive characteristics for SBWI and 
EWLI are shown in Table 1. Weight data at 24 months was available on 74.5% of the sample 
(Figure 1, 72.5% in SBWI, 76.4% in EWLI). The 20 women in SBWI and 9 in TECH who 
became pregnant after randomization discontinued participation in the study for safety. 
When these women are excluded, 79.3% of those in SBWI and 79.4% in EWLI had weight 
measured at 24 months.
There was significant change in weight over time (Time p < 0.0001), and the change differed 
significantly between EWLI and SBWI (Group × Time p=0.003), with less weight loss in 
EWLI (Table 2). Estimated mean weights for EWLI group were 96.3(95% CI: 94.2, 98.5) 
kg, 92.8 (95% CI: 90.6 to 95.0) kg and 3.5 kg (95% CI: 2.6, 4.5). Corresponding values for 
SBWI were 95.2 (95% CI: 93.0 to 97.3) kg at baseline and 89.3 (95% CI: 87.1, 91.5) kg at 
24 months, resulting in a mean loss of 5.9 kg (95% CI: 5.0, 6.8). At 24 months weight loss 
was 2.4 kg (95% CI: −3.7, −1.0) lower in EWLI compared to SBWI (p=0.002). Results from 
the sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation were similar with weight loss at 24 months 
of 3.3 kg (95% CI: 2.5, 4.0) in EWLI and 5.3 kg (95% CI: 4.5, 6.2) in SBWI.
In post-hoc analysis, percent weight loss differed significantly between SBWI and EWLI 
(Group p<0.001) (Table 2). While there was no significant difference between groups at 6 
months (estimated means: SBWI = 9.4% vs. EWLI = 8.4%, p=0.15), percent weight loss 
was significantly greater in SBWI compared to EWLI at 12 (estimated means: 8.9% vs. 
7.0%, p=0.01), 18 (estimated means: 7.9% vs 5.6%, p=0.002) and 24 months (estimated 
means: 6.4% vs 3.6%, p<0.001).
SBWI and EWLI did not differ significantly for fat mass, lean mass, percent body fat, bone 
mineral content, bone mineral density, or cardiorespiratory fitness (Group p for all ≥0.05), 
though there were significant changes across time among all participants (Time p for all 
<0.01). Data are presented in Table 2.
Differences between intervention groups for physical activity and dietary intake were not 
significant (Table 3). Regardless of the intervention conditions, there was a significant 
change in % sedentary time, sedentary time, and LPA across time (Time p for all <0.001). 
Although total MVPA (min/week or MET-min/week) did not change significantly over time, 
MVPA performed in bouts of ≥10 minutes significantly changed across the intervention 
(p<0.0001 for min/week and MET-min/week). Approximately 95% of participants providing

 weight data also provided valid physical activity data across the assessment periods (see 
eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Total calorie intake and the percent of energy intake consumed as dietary fat, carbohydrates, 
and protein changed significantly over time (Time p for all <0.001).
Of the 237 participants randomized to EWLI, 191 participants received the wearable device 
that was a component of the intervention starting after month 6 and wore the device for ≥1 
day [median days worn = 170.0 (25th, 75th percentile: 68.0, 347)]. On days that the device 
was worn the median wear time was 241.1 (25th, 75th percentile: 99.3, 579.1) minutes per 
day. User experience with this technology is included in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
There were no significant differences between groups in the number of safety alerts, non-
serious adverse events, and serious adverse events (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, the addition of wearable technology to a behavioral intervention was less 
effective for 24-month weight loss. This may be a result of the technology not being as 
effective for changing diet or physical activity behaviors compared to what was achieved in 
SBWI; however, the study found no significant difference in these measures between SBWI 
and EWLI. Thus, the reason for this difference in weight loss between SBWI and EWLI 
warrants further investigation.
The few studies that have shown promise for adding wearable technology at the onset of a 
weight loss intervention have been short in duration and have included relatively small 
samples of participants.5,6 However, in one 9-month intervention, combining a group-based 
weight loss intervention with wearable technology improved weight loss compared to the 
group-based treatment alone.25 Furthermore, the group-based treatment resulted in a mean 
weight loss of approximately 2 kg, whereas our SBWI resulted in mean weight loss of 
approximately 8 kg at both 6 and 12 months. Thus, questions remain regarding the 
effectiveness of wearable technologies over and above a SBWI and how to best use them to 
modify physical activity and diet behaviors in adults seeking weight loss.
Although this study showed weight loss across the 24 month intervention in young adults, 
similar to trials of middle-aged and older-aged adults,22,23,26,27 the benefits achieved at 6 
months were not fully sustained long-term. Thus, regardless of age, challenges remain to 
prevent or minimize weight regain following initial weight loss in adults. These findings are 
important because of the lack of data to support the effectiveness of approaches for weight 
loss in young adults, who have a high prevalence for overweight and obesity.1 The 
interventions used in this study resulted in substantially greater weight loss than what was 
recently reported for young adults in response to a 24-month low-intensity, technology-
based intervention.28 Given that there was not a no treatment control condition in this study, 
the degree to which the observed change in weight is a direct result of the intervention 
versus other factors cannot be determined. However, the importance of examining effective 
weight loss strategies for young adults is supported by a recent report showing that this age 
demographic has a higher prevalence rate of obesity (32.3%) compared to youth 12–19 years 
Jakicic et al.

 of age (20.5%) but lower than the prevalence found in middle-aged adults (40.2%).29 This 
may suggest that young adulthood is an important transition period for weight gain and the 
development of obesity.29
There were limitations to this study. The study sample was restricted to young adults, so 
results cannot be generalized to other ages. The multi-sensor wearable device was worn on 
the upper arm, which may not reflect the effectiveness of more contemporary devices that 
are worn on the wrist. However, the accuracy of wrist-worn devices to monitor physical 
activity and energy expenditure compared to the arm worn device has been questioned,30 
which may also limit their effectiveness and this may not be consequential. Moreover, the 
use of wearable technology was not initiated at the onset of the intervention, which may 
have influenced how the participants adopted and utilized the technology during their weight 
loss efforts. The device that was used was also commercially available, and therefore the 
investigators did not have control over any additional information that may have been 
provided through the website that was available for use with this device. Dietary intake was 
assessed using self-report, which may have affected the accuracy of this measure and 
therefore influenced the understanding of how the intervention influenced this aspect of 
energy balance. Additional investigation is also needed to examine for whom wearable 
devices and other technologies may be effective within the context of weight loss efforts, 
and how these technologies influence other components of weight loss, namely eating 
behavior and dietary intake.
Approximately 75% of the participants provided outcome data at the 24 month assessment. 
Of the 120 participants missing 24 month weight, approximately one-third (n=38) had 
missing weight due to either being terminated for pregnancy (n=29) or moving out of the 
area (n=9), which are unlikely to bias the results. Linear mixed models used all available 
data from participants with missing data (i.e., from earlier time points) to gain efficiency. 
Although multiple imputation was used to account for missing data in a sensitivity analysis, 
the loss of outcome data most likely resulted in reduced precision for the parameter 
estimates. Moreover, it is possible that the results could be biased in the event that the lost to 
follow-up was not missing at random. Assessment staff were also aware that individuals 
were engaged in a weight loss trial, which may have introduced additional bias.
CONCLUSIONS
Among young adults with a BMI between 25 to <40 kg/m2, the addition of a wearable 
technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 
months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an 
advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.

 KEY POINTS
Question
Is the addition of a wearable device to monitor and provide feedback on physical activity 
effective for improving weight loss within the context of a behavioral weight loss 
intervention?
Findings
In this randomized trial that included 470 young adults, weight loss was significantly less 
(by 2.4 kg) in response to a behavioral intervention when a wearable device that 
monitored and provided feedback on physical activity was included within the 
intervention.
Meaning
Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an 
advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.
