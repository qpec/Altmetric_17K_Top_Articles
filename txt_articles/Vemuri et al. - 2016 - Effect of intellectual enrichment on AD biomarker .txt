Effect of intellectual enrichment on AD
biomarker trajectories
Longitudinal imaging study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the effect of age, sex, APOE4 genotype, and lifestyle enrichment (edu-
cation/occupation, midlife cognitive activity, and midlife physical activity) on Alzheimer disease
(AD) biomarker trajectories using longitudinal imaging data (brain b-amyloid load via Pittsburgh
compound B PET and neurodegeneration via 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and structural MRI)
in an elderly population without dementia.
Methods: In the population-based longitudinal Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we studied 393 par-
ticipants without dementia (340 clinically normal, 53 mild cognitive impairment; 70 years and
older) who had cognitive and physical activity measures and at least 2 visits with imaging bio-
markers. We dichotomized participants into high ($14 years) and low (,14 years) education
levels using the median. For the entire cohort and the 2 education strata, we built linear mixed
models to investigate the effect of the predictors on each of the biomarker outcomes.
Results: Age was associated with amyloid and neurodegeneration trajectories; APOE4 status
appears to influence only the amyloid and FDG trajectories but not hippocampal volume trajec-
tory. In the high-education stratum, high midlife cognitive activity was associated with lower
amyloid deposition in APOE4 carriers. APOE4 status was associated with lower FDG uptake in
the entire cohort and in participants with lower education but not the high-education cohort.
Conclusions: There were minimal effects of lifestyle enrichment on AD biomarker trajectories
(specifically rates). Lifetime intellectual enrichment (high education, high midlife cognitive activity)
is associated with lower amyloid in APOE4 carriers. High education is protective from the APOE4
effect on FDG metabolism. Differing education levels may explain the conflicting results seen in
the literature. Neurology® 2016;86:1128–1135

Better intellectual and physical activity lifestyles have increasingly been viewed as protective
strategies against cognitive decline in the elderly.1,2 While lifestyle enrichment is associated with
better cognitive performance, there is no clear consensus on the influence of lifestyle enrichment
on ongoing Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology through longitudinal biomarker studies.
The primary goal of this study was to examine the effect of lifestyle enrichment variables on AD
biomarker values taking into account demographics and APOE4 status, both cross-sectionally
and longitudinally, in an elderly population-based sample without dementia.
Several recent studies have examined the effect of lifestyle enrichment on biomarkers cross-
sectionally. The use of different cohorts, sample sizes, and constructs of enrichment has contrib-
uted to conflicting results in the literature.3–10 An important difference we observed across the

 studies was the level of education. Typically,
participants recruited through advertisements
and after thorough screening have higher levels
of education, which is often the main under-
lying variable of interest. Since educational
attainment occurs during sensitive periods of
brain development, it plays a key role through-
out the lifespan, and may have a significant
impact on AD biomarker trajectories. We
hypothesized
that
the
conflicting
results
(regarding the effect of lifestyle enrichment
on AD biomarkers) seen in the literature (see
Discussion) may be partly explained by differ-
ent education levels of the cohort. We further
hypothesized that the effects of demographics
and lifestyle variables on the AD biomarker
trajectories may differ based on education lev-
els. Therefore, in this article we specifically
examine the effects of demographics and life-
style enrichment variables on AD biomarker
trajectories in participants with high and low
education.
In this article, we use longitudinal imaging
data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging
(MCSA), which is a population-based sample
of elderly without dementia. We used the fol-
lowing imaging biomarkers as surrogates of the
major AD processes: Pittsburgh compound B
(PiB) PET imaging as a biomarker of cerebral
amyloidosis,
18fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG)
PET imaging as an indicator of AD-related
changes in brain metabolism, and hippocam-
pal volume measured by structural MRI as an
indicator of neurodegeneration due to AD.
METHODS Selection of participants. Study participants
were participants in the MCSA, an epidemiologic study of the
prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) and dementia among Olmsted County residents
ages 70–89 years. The participants consisted of the original
cohort sampled from the October 1, 2004, enumeration of the
county population, and replenishment cohorts sampled from the
2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 enumeration. The MCSA uses
the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage sys-
tem to enumerate the county population11 and samples are ran-
domly selected for participation. We included all 393 participants
without dementia (340 clinically normal, 53 MCI) with APOE
genotype, intellectual lifestyle, physical activity lifestyle, and at
least 2 complete sets of AD biomarker measurements (PiB, FDG,
MRI). More extensive details of the MCSA design have been
published elsewhere.12,13
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. These studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic and
Olmsted Medical Center institutional review board. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants or their surrogates.
AD biomarkers. MRI acquisition and processing. All partici-
pants were scanned on 3T MRI scanners and a 3D volumetric
T1- magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)
was acquired and preprocessed as described previously.14 Free-
surfer software (version 5.3) with a longitudinal processing
pipeline was used to obtain total hippocampal volumes on serial
MRI scans.15 Total intracranial volume was estimated using
MPRAGE scans using an in-house method.16
PET acquisition and processing. Images were acquired with
a PET/CT operating in 3D mode (septa removed). More exten-
sive details of PET acquisition were described previously.17 All
PET quantitative image analysis, including quality control, was
performed at the Mayo Clinic using the same fully automated
image processing pipeline as described previously.16,18 Statistics
on image voxel values were extracted from automatically labeled
cortical regions of interest using an in-house modification of the
automated anatomic labeling atlas.19
Global PiB-PET ratio measure. A global cortical PiB-PET
measure was computed for each individual scan by calculating the
median uptake over voxels in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, pari-
etal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate/precu-
neus regions of interest (ROIs) for each participant and dividing
this by the median uptake over voxels in the cerebellar gray matter
ROI of the atlas.
Global FDG-PET ratio measure. A global FDG-PET
retention summary was computed for each individual scan by
averaging the left and right angular gyri, bilateral posterior cin-
gulate, and left middle/inferior temporal gyrus values for each
participant as described previously20 normalized by the pons
uptake.
Lifestyle enrichment variables. We used the following life-
style enrichment variables from the MCSA. These were recorded
for the majority of participants at the baseline or enrollment visit.
For patients with multiple evaluations, the variables collected
closest in time to the MRI/PET scan date were used in the anal-
yses. Details about the individual questions that were part of the
cognitive and physical activity questionnaires are provided in our
previous work.21
Intellectual lifestyle. The primary intellectual activity vari-
ables of interest included the following. (1) Education and pri-
mary occupation throughout life. Education and occupation are
highly correlated variables; therefore we used principal compo-
nents analysis (PCA) to form a consolidated variable (educa-
tion/occupation score) similar to our previous work21 to
reduce the numbers of predictor variables. (2) Midlife weekly
cognitive activity (ages 50–65 years) was summarized based on
self-report questionnaire21 (supplemental material on the
Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org).
Physical activity lifestyle. We used a midlife physical activity
score (ages 50–65 years) based on self-report questionnaire21
(supplemental material). In this article, we created a physical
activity composite score by weighting each individual component
with metabolic equivalent (MET) scores.22,23 These MET scores
assign intensities to physical activity questionnaire items, and
allow differentiation of light from heavy activities and exercises.
We then again used PCA to form a consolidated variable.
Statistical analysis. We examined baseline age, sex, APOE4
genotype, and lifestyle enrichment variables (education/occupa-
tion, midlife cognitive activity, and midlife physical activity) as
potential predictors of longitudinal biomarker values using linear
mixed models. In the entire cohort, we initially fit 3 separate
models for each of the AD biomarkers: global PiB ratio, global
FDG ratio, and total hippocampal volume (data in figure e-1).

 We then conducted stratified analyses using the median educa-
tion level of 14 as a cutpoint to investigate differences between
high- and low-education groups. In the models for amyloid,
global PiB was log transformed and also reversed in sign so that
larger values would correspond to lower amyloid burdens. In the
models for hippocampal volume, we included total intracranial
volume (TIV) as a covariate. We included all 2-way interactions
with time in the group of potential predictors. In these linear
mixed models, a significant interaction of a predictor with time
would indicate that the rate of change of the outcome over time
differs according to the value of the predictor variable (nonparallel
over time). In the absence of that interaction, a significant
predictor would indicate that the rate of change in the outcome
over time would be consistent (parallel over time) but shifted
according to the value of the predictor variable. We also
included interactions with sex and APOE4.
Because of the large number of potential predictor variables, we
used a Lasso-type penalization procedure for linear mixed models to
select a parsimonious model for each biomarker outcome24 while
respecting the need to retain nested terms. These methods are
implemented in the R package lmmlasso. This method shrinks
regression coefficient estimates to zero for some predictor variables,
thereby dropping them from the model. It has good statistical
accuracy for prediction and is computationally manageable. Per
the recommendations of the developer, we selected the regulariza-
tion parameters controlling the penalization (and hence the number
of regression coefficients set to zero) by minimizing the Bayesian
information criterion. Final parameter estimates, standard errors,
and p values were obtained for the parsimonious models using
standard linear mixed models fit with random participant-specific
intercepts and slopes. We tested for the statistical significance of
these random terms using likelihood ratio tests, and found that all
were necessary (all p values ,0.0001). Since we did not find sig-
nificant associations of lifestyle enrichment variables or sex with
biomarker values, we tested to see if we had adequate power to
detect important associations. Detailed power analyses are included
in the supplemental material.
RESULTS The demographics, APOE4 status, life-
style enrichment variables, and baseline AD bio-
marker values of all the participants and those in
the 2 education-stratified groups are shown in table
1. Age, sex, and APOE4 status were not significantly
different between the low- and high-education
cohorts. The greater mean follow-up time for high-
education participants (p 5 0.04) was primarily
driven by a few participants with large follow-up
times. Since the times were positively skewed, we
also ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test, which had p 5
0.09. Any influence of follow-up time should thus
be minimal. The number of visits per participant
did not differ between the groups (p 5 0.31).
Persons with higher education had higher job level
scores as well as higher midlife cognitive activity
levels, as expected (p , 0.001). The baseline AD
biomarker values were not different between high-
education and low-education groups (p $ 0.1).
The results of the linear mixed effect models for
the entire cohort are presented in table 2. The results
of the 3 linear mixed effects models are presented in
table 3A for those with high education ($14 years)
and in table 3B for those with low education (,14
years). Figure 1 illustrates the predicted biomarker
trajectories in the entire cohort as a function of age.
The top panel in figure 2 illustrates the predicted
biomarker trajectories in the high-education cohort
and bottom panel in figure 2 illustrates the predicted
biomarker trajectories in the low-education cohort as
a function of age.
Models for prediction of amyloid deposition. In the
amyloid models for the entire cohort as well as the
education-stratified cohorts, older age and APOE4
status was associated with worse amyloid levels (p ,
0.05). In the entire cohort amyloid model, APOE4
status was also associated with faster rate of increase
in amyloid deposition (p , 0.001). In the model of
amyloid deposition for high education levels, high
midlife cognitive activity was associated with lower
amyloid deposition in APOE4 carriers (coefficient 5
0.0630, p , 0.05). Midlife physical activity was not
associated with the amyloid trajectories.

 education strata, older age was associated with low
FDG uptake (p , 0.05). In the FDG models for
the entire cohort and the low-education cohort,
APOE4 status was associated with worse FDG
uptake (p , 0.05). None of the enrichment
variables was associated with FDG uptake.
Models for prediction of hippocampal volume. In all of
the models with hippocampal volume as an outcome,
increasing age was associated with lower hippocampal
volume. As expected, larger TIV was a predictor of
larger hippocampal volume (p , 0.001). In the
model of hippocampal volume with the entire cohort,
age was a predictor of faster annual rate of hippocam-
pal volume decline. None of the enrichment variables
was associated with hippocampal volume.
DISCUSSION The major conclusions of the study
are as follows. (1) We observed minimal effects of life-
style enrichment variables (education/occupation,
midlife cognitive activity, and midlife physical activ-
ity) on the AD biomarker trajectories (specifically
the rate of worsening). (2) Highly educated APOE4
carriers with high midlife cognitive activity have lower
amyloid burden than highly educated APOE4 carriers
with low midlife cognitive activity. (3) Age was asso-
ciated with both amyloid and neurodegeneration bio-
marker
trajectories;
APOE4
status
appears
to
influence only the amyloid and FDG trajectories
but not hippocampal volume trajectory. (4) APOE4
status was not associated with lower FDG uptake in
the high-education cohort but was associated with
lower FDG uptake in the entire cohort and lower
education cohort.
For all the models predicting amyloid deposition,
older age and APOE4 status were significantly asso-
ciated with higher levels of amyloid deposition. Only
the entire cohort model showed an association
between APOE4 status and faster rate of amyloid
deposition, which can be attributed to the larger sam-
ple required for detecting small effects (observed coef-
ficient was 0.01). These findings are consistent with
the literature that has shown a significant impact of
age and APOE4 on amyloid deposition.16,25,26 In our
earlier cross-sectional studies, we did not find an asso-
ciation between amyloid and lifestyle enrichment21
similar to the results we found when we considered
the entire cohort (figure 1). Some recent studies sup-
port the findings of no association between amyloid
deposition and cognitive activity.3–5 However, after
dichotomizing participants into high education and
low education, we observed associations of high mid-
life cognitive activity with lower amyloid deposition
in APOE4 participants with high education. The ef-
fects of lifestyle on amyloid deposition in our study
are similar to those found in studies with participants
with high education (median $16 years).6–10 There is
also literature supporting our findings of reduced AD
risk due to lifestyle modification, specifically in
APOE4 carriers.10,27–30 The analyses conducted in this
article make an important point that high-education
cohorts are likely to find an association of high life-
style enrichment with low amyloid deposition. The
conclusions were the same when education and occu-
pation were considered as separate variables.
There are several possible explanations for the
observation that highly educated APOE4 carriers with
high midlife cognitive activity have lower amyloid bur-
den than highly educated APOE4 carriers with low
midlife cognitive activity. (1) Higher levels of educa-
tion and higher levels of midlife cognitive activities
somehow forestall amyloid deposition, which is evi-
dent in APOE4 carriers because APOE4 carriers are
accumulating amyloid at an earlier age and at a faster
rate than APOE4 noncarriers.16,31 With greater power,
we might see the same protective association in APOE4
noncarriers. The problem is that there is not a good
biological explanation of how these features could fore-
stall amyloid deposition. (2) A reverse causality expla-
nation: APOE4 carriers are more likely to experience
an earlier elevation of brain amyloid.16 Among all edu-
cated APOE4 carriers, those with the highest amyloid
levels in middle age are most likely to experience subtle
cognitive symptoms at that time and consequently
avoid strenuous intellectual activity, thus placing them
in the low cognitive activity group.

 For all the models predicting FDG uptake,
older age and APOE4 status were associated with
lower glucose metabolism, which has been found
in previous studies.32–34 An interesting finding was
that APOE4 status was not associated with lower
FDG uptake in the high-education subset, which
implies that high education in APOE4 carriers may
be protective via nonimpaired glucose metabolism.
This may have been further observed by the differ-
ences in the amyloid deposition levels between
participants with low cognitive activity vs high
cognitive activity.
For the models predicting hippocampal volume,
we found that older age was associated with lower
hippocampal volume. Only the entire cohort model
showed an association between older age and faster
rate of hippocampal atrophy, which can be attributed
to the larger sample required for detecting small ef-
fects (observed coefficient was 20.0025). APOE4 sta-
tus did not influence the hippocampal atrophy
trajectories. While decline of hippocampal volume
with age has been well-established in the litera-
ture,35,36 the influence of APOE4 on hippocampal
volume and rates of hippocampal atrophy has often
been debated.37,38
In this longitudinal biomarker study, we did not
find any direct effect of lifestyle enrichment variables
on the rate of change of neurodegenerative bio-
markers even though we had adequate power to
detect associations of interest based on the sensitivity
analyses. The effect of lifestyle enrichment on neuro-
degeneration is not unanimously agreed upon.3,4,8
The neurodegeneration biomarkers not only capture
the disease-related effects (i.e., worsening of neuro-
degeneration with disease severity) but also capture
structural and functional brain differences, e.g.,
genetic differences and compensatory mechanisms.
Therefore, the effect of lifestyle enrichment on pro-
gression of neurodegeneration can yield different re-
sults depending on the biomarker and disease stage of
the participants sampled.
There is substantial evidence that lifestyle enrich-
ment is helpful in delaying the onset of cognitive
impairment, but the mechanisms through which it
delays impairment remain controversial. There may
be 2 fundamental reasons for the controversial find-
ings. First, the effect of lifestyle enrichment on AD bi-
omarkers is small and only seen in select situations.
Sample characteristics and sensitivity of the (lifestyle
enrichment and biomarker) measures can yield signif-
icantly different findings. For example, in this study
we did not see any effect of lifestyle enrichment in
the overall sample, which is a population-based sam-
ple. Also, we only detected effects in highly educated
individuals with APOE4 who had both higher levels
of amyloid (APOE4 genotype) and higher neuroplas-
ticity potential (high education). Second, there will be
an impact of survivor and recruitment bias on the
statistical models. For any biomedical study, persons
with low educational attainment and low interest in
novel activities tend to have a lower voluntary partic-
ipate rate. Additionally, it is difficult to recruit older
APOE4 carriers who do not have dementia due to the
earlier onset of dementia in APOE4 carriers.

the current physical and cognitive activities (i.e.,
reverse causality). We only included activity ques-
tionnaires that reported midlife physical and cogni-
tive
activities.
The

of
the
activities done by participants stratified by median
education level (of 14 years) and median midlife
cognitive activity level (of 19.5) are shown in table
e-1 and figure e-2. Participants with high cognitive
activity scores performed well across the board com-
pared to those with low cognitive activity scores.
The top 4 frequent activities in the high cognitive

Longitudinal trajectories for predicted (left panel) amyloid deposition, (middle panel) 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and (right panel) hippocampal
volume as a function of age. In each of the plots, the variables that significantly influenced the trajectories were also considered, i.e., APOE4 carrier status
influenced amyloid deposition and FDG uptake.
Figure 2
Plots for biomarker outcome models run after education stratification
Longitudinal trajectories for predicted (left panel) amyloid deposition, (middle panel) 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and (right panel) hippocampal
volume as a function of age. In the top panels (A), participants were in the higher education cohort (education $14), and the lower panels (B) participants
were in the lower education cohort (education ,14). In each of the plots, the variables that significantly influenced the trajectories are additionally plotted.
High cognitive activity was defined as the 67th percentile, and low cognitive activity as the 33rd percentile.

 activity group were reading books and magazines,
computer activities, and playing games. A third of
the population sampled fell in the category of low
education and low cognitive activity and would ben-
efit from engaging in midlife cognitive activities.39
Though we did not find associations with midlife
physical activities, ongoing and planned active inter-
ventional trials may be better designed to observe
these associations with physical activity.40
The limitations of this study are as follows. (1) We
took a simplistic approach of investigating the influence
of lifestyle enrichment on the 3 AD biomarkers inde-
pendently and did not consider the possible interac-
tions between the different biomarker variables,
which may be influenced by enrichment variables. (2)
The AD biomarkers used in this study may not be cap-
turing the brain compensatory mechanisms invoked by
pathology due to lifestyle enrichment, e.g., recruitment
of additional neuronal changes not measured here. (3)
The activity questionnaires are self-reported.
