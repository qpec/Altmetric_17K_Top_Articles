The importance of the circadian rhythm in regulating human food intake behaviour and
metabolism has long been recognised. However, little is known as to how energy intake is
distributed over the day in existing populations, and its potential association with obesity.
The present review describes global trends in time-of-day of energy intake in the general
population based on data from cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts. Evidence
of the association between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity is also summarised.
Overall, there were a limited number of cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts
that provided data on time-of-day of energy intake. In the identified studies, a wide variation
in time-of-day of energy intake was observed, with patterns of energy distribution varying
greatly by country and geographical area. In relation to obesity, eight cross-sectional surveys
and two longitudinal cohorts were identified. The association between time-of-day of energy
intake and obesity varied widely, with several studies reporting a positive link between even-
ing energy intake and obesity. In conclusion, the current review summarises global trends in
time-of-day of energy intake. The large variations across countries and global regions could
have important implications to health, emphasising the need to understand the socio-
environmental factors guiding such differences in eating patterns. Evidence of the associ-
ation between time-of-day of energy intake and BMI also varied. Further larger scale colla-
borations between various countries and regions are needed to sum data from existing
surveys and cohorts, and guide our understanding of the role of chrono-nutrition in health.
Circadian rhythms: Chrono-nutrition: Temporal trends: Obesity
Circadian rhythms are cyclical endogenous processes
that occur with a periodicity of approximately 24 h.
Research carried out in the 1970s identified a region in
the brain of mammals within the anterior hypothalamus
known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The suprachias-
matic nucleus also known as the master clock is

synchronised to geophysical time via photic activation of
the retinal ganglion cells. In this way, the suprachiasmat-
ic nucleus can synchronise oscillators present within the
cells of most organs and tissues, therefore influencing
several physiological processes(1). So although the im-
portance of circadian rhythms in regulating mammalian
physiological responses has been recognised for a long
time(2), its impact on nutrition and metabolism is rela-
tively new and is an area of evolving interest(3).
It is now well recognised that food intake, appetite,
digestion and metabolism each exhibit circadian pat-
terns(4). Food intake itself serves as a regulator of the cir-
cadian clock, particularly the peripheral circadian clock
in tissues such as the liver and the intestine(5–7).
Conversely, the central circadian clock, entrained by
the dark–light cycle, is known to extend its effect on
food
absorption.
More
specifically,
small
peptides
cleaved in the intestine from dietary protein have been
shown to be transported in a circadian-driven process(8).
Similar observations have been made for glucose(9) and
lipid transport(10). However, despite our ever-growing
knowledge of circadian rhythms, we still need to gain fur-
ther insight into how the nutrient content of a mixed
meal (macronutrient, micronutrient and energy content)
may interact to benefit/compromise health.
The debate as to when to eat is imbedded in human
history. Ancient Greeks consumed three to four meals,
with breakfast and the evening meal being deemed
most important(11). In Roman times, breakfast was con-
sumed at dawn although greater emphasis was given to
eating later in the day particularly amongst the upper so-
cial classes(11). By contrast, the poorer social classes ate
their meals in line with the patterns of manual labour
and thus consistent with the night–day cycle(11). In the
Islamic world, meal timing was also often dictated by
the dark–light cycle. Consuming a meal before sunrise
was deemed to be a sacred ritual that prepared the
human body for fast and promoted health. Accordingly,
the famous physician Avicenna recommended eating two
meals a day, one taken prior to sunrise and the second
taken in the evening at dusk(12). The ancient physicians
of Andalusia also believed in the importance of consum-
ing two to three meals a day separated by 6–12 h inter-
vals depending on the nature of the individual and
their health status(12). By the middle-ages, however, eat-
ing breakfast in Europe was seen as a sinful act, and phy-
sicians warned against eating breakfast as it was thought
to be detrimental to health(13). It was not until later in the
16th century that breakfast became recognised as an es-
sential meal(13), and proverbs such as ‘Eat breakfast
yourself, share lunch with a friend and give dinner
away to your enemy’ or ‘Eat breakfast like a king,
lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper’ became
prevalent.
Recent evidence obtained from both randomised
controlled trials and observational studies have indeed
documented the importance of breakfast consumption
and its associated benefits to health(14). Several studies
have also investigated the relationship between night eat-
ing and cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity(15).
Furthermore,
the
way
the
overall
energy
load
is
distributed across the day has also been shown to result
in altered physiological adaptations(16,17). The exact rea-
son for this is not clear. However, recent evidence has
emerged suggesting that various genes involved in sub-
strate metabolism such as dietary lipids are under direct
control of the circadian rhythm dictating their metabolic
fate towards oxidation or storage(18).
Such studies highlight the importance of understand-
ing the role of circadian rhythms and chronobiology in
nutrition and how these may alter the physiological sta-
tus. The exact driver behind such alterations is not
clear. Nonetheless, given the complex interplay between
the various eating occasions and the fact that energy in-
take at one eating occasion is not independent of intake
at previous or subsequent occasions, it is critical to con-
sider a broader approach that encompasses the so-called
circadian rhythms of eating and in which timing of en-
ergy intake is considered across the full spectrum of eat-
ing occasions.
Against, this background, the current review aimed:
(1) to describe current trends in energy intake across
the day in the general population worldwide and contrast
differences in time-of-day of energy intake across the
life-course, and different sexes, and (2) to systematically
review the association between time-of-day of energy in-
take in relation to metabolic disease, particularly obesity.
Identifying observational studies
The present review included observational studies that
used a cross-sectional or longitudinal design and which
had quantitative data on energy intake at different eating
occasions, wherein eating occasions were categorised into
either pre-defined meal slots, self-defined or statistically
defined. All published studies that used a quantified diet-
ary assessment method (24 h recall, food records, diet
history) to estimate energy intake at different eating
occasions were included. We excluded qualitative studies
that assessed frequency of eating occasions, or that sim-
ply reported proportions of meal consumers or skippers,
as well as methodological and validation studies. Studies
that looked at specific population groups (i.e. athletes) or
patients were also excluded. We did not consider studies
that assessed energy intake at specific eating occasions
(i.e. breakfast) without reporting energy intake at other
eating occasions.
Characteristics of observational studies
Overall, 1660 titles were identified using the search terms
(see supplementary material), of which fifty were dupli-
cates. An additional three titles were identified using
manual searches of reference lists. Based on assessment
of titles, a total of twenty-five abstracts were identified
as potentially relevant. Of the latter studies, five studies
were excluded because the main outcome of interest
was
comparing
energy
intake
from
snacks
v.
meals(19–23). One other study focused on meal and
snack patterns and daily eating frequency(24). Overall,

eleven full-text articles were included in the present re-
view(25–35). These studies are summarised in Table 1.
There was a wide variation in the dietary assessment
methods, with the majority of studies using food records
and 24 h recalls. Moreover, the definition of eating occa-
sions varied widely. In most studies, eating occasions
consisted of pre-defined meal slots(25,26), and in a few
occasions survey members self-reported the type of eat-
ing occasion with the aid of a list containing standardised
meal and snack names. Sjoberg et al.(35) used a diet his-
tory method alongside an interview with a dietitian. The
questionnaire used as part of the diet history method had
a quantitative element and was divided into sections to
cover breakfast, lunch, dinner and in-between meals eat-
ing occasions. Meals were defined based on the locations
and time of intake during the day, thereby taking into
consideration
the
elements
of
‘when’
and
‘where’.
Accordingly, breakfast was defined as intake in the
morning before school, while lunch was considered as in-
take during lunch break at school and dinner as the main
meal
in
the afternoon
after
schools. By
contrast,
Howarth et al.(36) assessed eating patterns based on
data collected from two 24 h dietary recalls. Eating occa-
sions were standardised using a statistical method that
incorporated both self-reported definitions of eating
occasions with a statistical approach incorporated a
time element. For instance, two or more meals consumed
within 59 min of each other were deemed to be one eating
occasion(36). Similarly, if a brunch was reported or mul-
tiple same meals (i.e. two dinners), an a priori criterion
was used to recode these eating occasions to ensure
standardisation across all survey members. One study
did not specify how eating occasions were defined(28).
Eating occasions reported outside the main meals
(breakfast, lunch and dinner) were labelled as snacks
and combined into one category. Only one study did
not combine the between-meals eating occasions to one
category, which permitted evaluation of energy intake
between meals and whether there were differences in
energy intake at mid-morning, mid-afternoon and late-
evening eating occasions(25).
In relation to obesity, 962 publications were identified
using the search strategy (see supplementary material).
After removing forty-four duplicates, 918 titles remained.
Of these, fourteen articles were selected for further
screening. An additional article was identified using
manual searches. A total of ten full-text articles were
found to be eligible and therefore included in the review
(Table 2).
In relation to studies on obesity, various dietary as-
sessment methods were used to assess the association be-
tween the time-of-day of energy or macronutrient intake
and BMI. The number of dietary data days also varied
from as few as 1–7 d. BMI was assessed as a continuous
variable expressed as kg/m2 or as z-scores in some stud-
ies(27,37–40), whilst in others BMI was treated as a categor-
ical variable(41,42). One study selected subcutaneous and
visceral fat as an outcome of interest(43). In the majority
of studies, time-of-day of energy intake was assessed by
dividing eating occasions into four main groups (break-
fast, lunch, dinner and snacks).

Global trends in time-of-day of energy intake
There was a wide variation in the contribution of differ-
ent eating occasions to energy intake across the studies
(Table 3). Overall, four different patterns of energy distri-
bution could be observed in these studies (Fig. 1). These
patterns differed by country and geographical area
(Fig. 2).
For instance, Vossenaar et al. assessed the distribution
of energy, macro- and micronutrient intakes in a cross-
sectional sample of school children in Guatemala attend-
ing third and fourth grades(26). In this survey, lunch
contributed the greatest proportion of daily energy in-
take, while breakfast and dinner contributed an equal
proportion of daily energy intake(26). Macronutrients fol-
lowed a similar pattern of distribution as energy, whilst
the distribution of micronutrients varied. Accordingly,
lunch provided a greater proportion of all macro-
nutrients, vitamin C and Zn, whereas breakfast provided
more vitamins A and D, thiamine, riboflavin, folate Ca
and Fe(26). Poland followed a similar pattern of distri-
bution with breakfast and dinner contributing approxi-
mately an equal proportion of energy intake and lunch
providing the greatest contributor to energy intake over
the day(30).
However in France, Switzerland, Italy and Northern
Ireland, the pattern of energy distribution differed in
both adults and children in that the proportion of energy
intake increased progressively reaching a peak at lunch
and declining thereafter. As such, lunch contributed the
greatest proportion of energy intake followed by dinner
and breakfast(30,33).
In Sweden, energy distribution followed a different
pattern.
In
a
cross-sectional
survey
conducted
by
Sjoberg et al., dietary data were collected from 611
boys and 634 girls attending grade nine in Goteborg,
Sweden(35). Breakfast and dinner were found to contrib-
ute the greatest proportion of energy intake across the
day, whilst lunch contributed the lowest proportion of
energy intake over the day.
In the UK, USA, Germany, Canada, Denmark,
Netherlands and Belgium, the pattern of energy distribu-
tion varied from the earlier studies. Accordingly, in the
UK, the proportion of daily energy intake increased
gradually across the day, with breakfast providing the
lowest proportion of energy intake while dinner contrib-
uted the greatest proportion of energy intake(25). This
eating pattern was observed at different follow-ups in
the MRC 1946 British Birth Cohort. This corresponds
to changes in distribution of energy intake between the
years 1982, 1989 and 1999, which translates to when co-
hort members were aged 36, 43 and 53 years. On average,
dinner contributed over 40 % of daily energy intake(25).
This is was markedly higher than in any of the other sur-
veys. Macronutrient intake also followed a pattern simi-
lar to energy distribution in this cohort(25).
Similar
observations
were
made
in
the
USDA
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals, col-
lected in 1994–1996, where energy intake was assessed
using two 24 h food recalls. In this repeated cross-
sectional survey, both younger survey members (20–59

years) and older survey members (60–90 years) were
found to increase energy intake over the day(27).
In Canada, data were available from a small-scale
study wherein 180 healthy adolescent males aged 14–18
years were recruited from local high schools and commu-
nity groups. Adolescents completed a 3-d food record.
Breakfast contributed 18 % of total daily energy intake
(TEI), followed by lunch (26 % TEI), and dinner at
34 % (TEI)(28). This pattern of energy distribution was
consistent with the pattern observed in the UK and
USA. Likewise in Germany, breakfast, lunch, and dinner
contributed to TEI in the following proportions, respect-
ively: 17, 29 and 33 %(44). Denmark(30), Netherlands(30)
and Belgium(32) followed a similar pattern with the pro-
portion of energy intake increasing progressively through
the day.

Breakfast, snacks and meals: contribution to total
energy intake
Thelowestproportionofenergyfrombreakfastwasobserved
in US children (11 % TEI in girls, 12 % TEI in boys) and
Italian adults (11 % TEI in men, 13 % TEI in women)(30).
By contrast, the proportion of TEI from breakfast was high-
est in Swedish boys (21 % TEI), Guatemalan children (22 %
TEIingirls,24 %TEIinboys)andPolishadults(28 %TEIin
men, 30 % TEI in women; see Figs 3 and 4).
In most countries, snacks contributed a larger proportion
of energy intake through the day than breakfast. Swedish
adolescents and Dutch men and women(30) reported obtain-
ing the greatest proportion of energy from snacks, whereas
adults from the UK(25), France and Italy reported the low-
est proportion of energy intake from snacks(30).
Secular trends in time-of-day of energy intake and
differences according to age and sex
There were limited data of secular trends in time-of-day
of energy intake. In the UK, data from the MRC 1946
British Birth Cohort demonstrated a trend towards
increased energy intake later in the day between 1982
and 1999 corresponding to ages 36 and 53 years(25).
Therewere some variationsin energy intake across differ-
enteatingoccasionsamongst youngerandolder people. For
instance, in France, the contribution of lunch and dinner to
dailyenergyintakeincreasedprogressivelyfromages4years
and below, to ages 41 and above(33). In the USA, both
younger adults and older adults obtained 38 % of their en-
ergy intake from dinner, although the younger group had
a larger difference in energy intake between breakfast and
dinner (15·9 % energy at breakfast v. 38·3 % of daily energy
at dinner), compared with the older group (20·4 % energy at
breakfast v. 38·1 % of daily energy at dinner)(27).
Few studies examined differences in time-of-day of en-
ergy intake between men and women. On average, girls
obtained a lower proportion of energy intake at breakfast
compared
with
boys
in
both
Guatemala(26)
and
Sweden(35). In Guatemala, on average, girls obtained a
greater percentage of energy from snacks(35), while in
Sweden, girls obtained a greater proportion of energy
at dinner compared with boys(35). In the UK, women
reported obtaining a greater proportion of energy intake
at breakfast than men at age 36 years(25).
There were no marked sex-differences in the propor-
tion of energy intake from breakfast or snacks in the
countries surveyed by the Seneca Study(30). However,
men from Poland reported a greater proportion of energy
intake at lunch (33 % TEI) compared with Polish women
(26 % TEI). Likewise, Swiss men reported a greater pro-
portion of energy intake at dinner (33 % TEI) compared
with Swiss women (28 % TEI)(30).
Time-of-day of energy intake in relation to BMI
There was a wide variation in the reported association
between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity.
Aljuraiban et al. assessed time-of-day by examining
the ratio of evening-to-morning energy intake in the
INTERMAP study(37). Accordingly, morning intake
was defined as mean energy intake from 06.00 hours to
11.55 hours, while evening intake was defined as mean
energy intake from 18.00 hours to 23.55 hours. Times
were selected based on when 98 % of the US and UK
INTERMAP survey members consumed morning and
evening
meals.
Additionally,
survey
members
were
divided into quartiles of the ratio of evening:morning
energy intake (<1·0, 1·0 to <1·5, 1·5 to <2·0, ≥2·0).
Based on the findings of this study, survey members
with <1·0 compared with >2·0 ratio of evening:morning
energy
intake
had
lower
total
energy
intake
and
dietary energy density, and better nutrient quality of
individual foods and nutrient density of the overall
diet, as assessed using Nutrient Rich Food Index 9.3
(NRF9.3)(45). BMI was also found to be positively asso-
ciated with evening:morning energy intake ratio, with
a 2 SD difference in ratio of evening:morning energy in-
take being associated with a 0·2 kg/m2 increase in BMI,
after adjustment for sex, age and population sample(37).
There was a tendency for individuals to have fewer eating
occasions with increasing ratio of evening:morning en-
ergy intake, although this was NS(37).
Kondoh et al. pooled cross-sectional data from three
interventions which included a total of 301 Japanese
men aged 21–65 years. Energy intake was divided into
four eating occasions: breakfast, lunch, supper and
between-meal intake. The association between each eat-
ing occasion and visceral and subcutaneous adiposity
was assessed in multiple linear regression models after
adjustment for age. Only between-meal energy intake
was associated positively with subcutaneous fat. No
adjustments for sociodemographic or other sample char-
acteristics were conducted.
In a longitudinal analysis of the association between
time-of-day of macronutrient intake and the metabolic
syndrome, increasing carbohydrate intake at the expense
of carbohydrate at age 43 years was associated with
lower waist circumference at age 53 years(46).
In another small cross-sectional study, time-of-day of
energy intake was assessed using three 24 h dietary
recalls and stratified by time-of-day into three categories:
morning
(00.00–11.00 hours),
midday
(11.00–17.00
hours) and evening (17.00–00.00 hours)(47). Data on
time-of-day of beverage intake was not collected and,
as such, energy intake from beverages was assumed to
be evenly distributed across the eating occasions. The
proportion of daily energy intake at morning, midday
and evening was calculated, and participants were stra-
tified into two categories; those reporting <33 % of
total energy intake at morning, midday and evening,
and those reporting ≥33 % of total energy intake at
morning, midday and evening. In the crude analysis,
higher proportion of energy intake at midday was asso-
ciated with a healthy BMI. The odds of having a BMI
≥25 kg/m2 was almost double in men reporting a higher
proportion of energy intake in the evening in the overall
sample, after adjustment for age, sex, race and educa-
tion, TEI and physical activity. However, once only

men with self-reported energy intake within ±25 % of
total energy expenditure as assessed by doubly-labelled
water were included in the analysis, the odds of
having a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was lower in men reporting a
higher proportion of energy intake at midday but not

By contrast, in a cross-sectional study investigating the
association between eating behaviours (eating speed and
energy intake at main meals) in pre-school children (n
1138; age range 3·1–6·7 years), each 418·4 kJ (100 kcal)
increase in energy intake at lunch increased the likeli-
hood of overweight by a factor of 1·445(48).

The association between breakfast skipping, BMI and
time-of-day of energy intake was examined in the
Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Quebec,
when children were aged 44–56 months(41). Breakfast
skipping was defined as eating breakfast on fewer than
7 d/week. Differences in energy and macronutrient intake

at breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, din-
ner, and evening snack, as assessed using a 24 h recall,
were compared amongst breakfast skippers and eaters.
Overall, breakfast skippers were found to have lower en-
ergy intake at breakfast and over the day, as well as
higher energy intake at lunch, afternoon snack and even-
ing snack. Breakfast skippers reported having lower en-
ergy intake from main meal and greater energy intake
from between meals. Furthermore, overweight/obesity
in breakfast skippers was related to a higher energy
and carbohydrate intake at dinner(41).
In a representative sample of French children aged 3–
11 years (n 748), 7-d dietary records were collected as
part of a cross-sectional survey(42). Eating occasions
were categorised into four categories: breakfast, main
meals (lunch and dinner) and snacks (any eating occasion
other than breakfast and main meals). Overweight,
defined using the International Obesity Task Force cut-
points, was associated with a higher proportion of daily
energy intake from main meals and snacks(42).
Howarth et al. compared the association between eat-
ing patterns, including time-of-day of energy intake, and
BMI in younger (20–59 years, n 1792), and older (60–90
years, n 893) participants of the Continuing Survey of
Food Intakes by Individuals(27). Data were collected be-
tween 1994 and 1996. Higher BMI was associated with a
higher TEI and higher intakes at all eating occasions in
participants reporting plausible energy intake. The pro-
portion of energy intake at different eating occasions
was, however not assessed(27).
In a convenience sample of 101 girls selected from a
longitudinal growth and development study, dietary
data were collected using a 7-d food record at baseline
when cohort members were aged 8–12 years and at a
follow-up when the same girls where aged 11–19
years(38). Given that participants reported atypical eating
patterns
dietary
events
were
classified
based
on
time-of-day, frequency and amount of energy intake.
Using data on time-of-day, dietary events were classified
as morning (06.00–10.59 hours), afternoon (11.00–16.59
hours) and evening/night (17.00–05.59 hours). After con-
trolling for baseline BMI z-score, the mean percentage of
daily energy intake at evening/night was positively asso-
ciated with change in BMI z-score(38).
Maffeis found a correlation between proportion of en-
ergy intake at breakfast, dinner and night snack and per-
centage fat mass in children(39). There was a significant
correlation between energy intakes at different eating
occasions. Proportion of daily energy intake at dinner
explained 2 % of the variation in children’s BMI after ad-
justment for sex, energy intake/BMR ratio and parental
BMI.
In another small-scale study, eating patterns were
assessed in 220 individuals who completed 7-d weighed
dietary records(40). In the latter study, 187 records were
obtained from three independent studies, and data were
reanalysed. These studies provided data on three age
groups in the British population: Elderly group (n 88),
Middle-aged group (n 40), Working age group (n 59).
A fourth study of 13–14-year olds living in Croydon
was carried out from which thirty-three usable diet
records
were
collected
to
produce
the
Adolescent
group. Greater energy intake at breakfast was associated
with a lower BMI in the Adolescent group. In the
Middle-aged group, greater energy intakes at breakfast
and lower energy intakes during the evening were asso-
ciated with a lower BMI. However, only the association
between breakfast energy and BMI in the Adolescent
group remained significant after including individuals
with plausible energy intakes.
Summary of the evidence and current challenges
The present review provides a summary of published
data on the time-of-day of energy intake in Northern
and
Southern
Europe,
and
in
North
and
South
America. Despite the limited number of studies pub-
lished in this field, data suggest that there are four pat-
terns
of
energy
distribution
over
the
day.
These
patterns varied by country and geographical area.
Although the factors contributing to such geographical
differences in time-of-day of energy intake are not
clear, they may potentially reflect sociocultural habits
or beliefs related to eating behaviour. For instance, the
fact that lunch is the most important meal of the day is
characteristic of France and the Mediterranean re-
gion(49), and serves as a reflection of the French beliefs
of the importance of the pleasurable and social aspects
of eating(50). Consequently, the French tend to eat to-
gether as a household more regularly and to follow a
regular meal pattern of three meals daily(49). By contrast,
in central England, individual ethics and convenience
drive food choices and intake, which is then translated
as increased consumption of ready-prepared and take-
away meals, as well as higher intake of energy-dense
snack foods such as crisps(49). Indeed, such reliance on
individual ethics and convenience may potentially favour
an individual pattern of consumption where people pre-
pare and consume meals alone and eat away from
home(49). This is particularly concerning given the estab-
lished association of family meals with better diet quality
and meal structure(51). The absence of the latter might ex-
plain the greater prevalence of meal skipping in England
compared with France(49). This said, although a shift to-
wards greater energy intake at the evening meal has been
reported in France in recent decades(49) due to changing
working patterns(52), the destructure of French eating
patterns is not yet on par with the patterns observed in
England(49). This highlights the need for further studies
to determine the sociocultural and socio-economic fac-
tors that govern time-of-day of energy intake. For in-
stance in relation to breakfast, it is now well recognised
that amongst children; girls, older adolescents, children
from families within the lower socio-economic groups
and those living in single-parent families are more likely
to skip breakfast(53).
In relation to in-between meal energy intake, evidence
from the literature demonstrated that the contribution of
snacks to energy intake varied from as high as 37 % of
TEI in Swedish boys(35) to as low as 2–3 % of TEI in
French adults(33). In most countries, snacks provided a

similar contribution to TEI as breakfast or more. The
implications of the varying energy intake from snacks
in relation to cardio-metabolic risk factors warrant inves-
tigation. However, it is important to mention that the
majority of studies did not differentiate between mid-
morning, mid-afternoon or late-evening eating occasions,
with most studies aggregating in-between meal energy in-
take into one ‘snack’ category. This raises several chal-
lenges as the proportion of TEI at different time points
might be more relevant than the total energy intake
from snacks. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, it
has previously been reported that consuming a small
snack at night (23.00 hours) for 2 weeks, compared to
a morning snack (10.00 hours), leads to a decline in
24 h fat oxidation(54).
In addition to the time-of-day of snack intake, the
composition of snacks taken in-between meals might
equally be important. For instance, in a study examining
snacking behaviour in Scottish school children, 77 % of
children reported eating biscuits, cakes and pastries;
whilst 72 % ate crisps and savoury snacks; 70 % ate con-
fectionery; and 69 % ate fruit as part of a snack(55). In the
USA, desserts, salty foods and sugar-sweetened bev-
erages are the greatest contributors to energy intake
from snacks(56). By contrast in France, snacking is
reported to be rare amongst adults, and when it does
occur, it consists mainly of foods such as bread, cheese,
yoghurts and fresh fruit rather than cakes, sweet biscuits
or confectionery(57). This again emphasises potential
socio-cultural values related to eating behaviour.
With regard to secular trends, only one study had lon-
gitudinal data on time-of-day of energy intake. In the
present study, a trend was observed towards increased
energy intake later in the day between 1982 and 1999,
corresponding to ages 36 and 53 years,(25). The present
study was, however, limited because it was based on
data from a birth cohort. This rendered it impossible to
differentiate secular trends from age trends. Differentiat-
ing secular and age trends is important to elucidate
whether the recent increase in obesity prevalence is asso-
ciated with a global trend towards increased energy in-
take later in the day, or whether it is related to
life-style changes related to ageing.
Only a few studies examined differences in time-of-
day of energy intake across different age groups.
Accordingly, it was observed that, in France, lunch and
dinner meals contribute a greater proportion of TEI in
adults compared with children(33). Similarly, in USA,
there was a greater disparity between the proportion of
energy intake at breakfast v. dinner in younger adults
compared with older adults(27), which might reflect
greater breakfast skipping and a larger proportion of
energy intake later in the day. As discussed previously,
such differences might be influenced by various socio-
environmental factors. This emphasises the need for
investigating the context of eating occasions, and under-
standing how factors such as ‘with whom’ and ‘where’
influence time-of-day of energy intake.
In the context of obesity, there were a limited number
of studies investigating the association between time-of-
day of energy intake and obesity. Moreover, there was
a large heterogeneity in terms of the population studied,
dietary assessment methods used, sample size, and choice
of markers of obesity. Of the ten studies included in the
second part of the present review, one study found an as-
sociation between breakfast and BMI(40). Another study
reported an association between lunch time intake and
BMI(48). However, the present study only assessed energy
intake at lunch and did not observe or collect data on
other eating occasions. Four studies identified evening
energy intake as being an important eating occa-
sion(38,39,41,47). Out of these four, one study reported
that the association between evening intake and BMI
was affected by breakfast habits wherein individuals
who did not consume breakfast on all days (breakfast
skippers), had higher BMI with increasing energy and
carbohydrate intake in the evening(41). Similarly, one of
the studies reported that the mean percentage of daily en-
ergy intake at evening/night is associated with a longitu-
dinal increase in BMI z-score in girls(38). Likewise, Wang
et al. found that the association between evening intake
and BMI diminished after removing individuals who
may have potentially mis-reported their energy intake(47).
A further two studies reported an association between
energy intake between meals and subcutaneous fat and
BMI, respectively(42,43). On the balance of this evidence,
it could be speculated that evening energy intake is a
major risk factor for obesity. However, additional data
from cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys will be
required to confirm such findings. Given the heterogen-
eity of the studies included in the present review, it was
not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of the data.
Moreover, it is important in future to differentiate be-
tween mid-morning, mid-afternoon and evening snacks,
as it is likely that the time-of-day of snack intake is rele-
vant to obesity risk.
It is noteworthy that one study found that energy
intake at all occasions is associated with BMI(27).
However, in the latter study, absolute energy intake at
every eating occasion was assessed without adjustment
for intake at other eating occasions. It is likely that the
use of absolute intake rather than proportion of TEI
masks the association between time-of-day of energy in-
take and BMI(27). This highlights the importance of con-
trolling energy intake at other eating occasions when
investigating the relationship between time-of-day of en-
ergy intake and obesity. Indeed in a recent clinical trial
investigating the effect of redistributing the TEI on
weight loss, the authors reported greater weight and
waist circumference loss as well as improved insulinae-
mia, glycaemia and TAG levels in overweight and
obese women when greater energy consumption occurred
in the morning compared with the evening(58). Therefore,
the timing and distribution of the TEI across the day play
an important role in relation to cardio-metabolic risk fac-
tors. It has previously been reported that glucose homeo-
stasis naturally fluctuates across the day indicating that is
governed by the internal circadian system, and is thought
to involve changes in insulin signalling(59). Similarly,
lipid metabolism has also been reported to be under
the influence of the circadian clock. For example, plasma
TAG concentrations are elevated during the biological

night and the postprandial response following a night-
time meal is amplified compared with the same meal con-
sumed during the day(60).
Observational
studies
have
also
reported
similar
findings. In addition to individual eating occasions,
Aljuraiban et al.(37) pointed towards the importance of
the
ratio
of
evening:morning
energy
intake.
This
finding is important as it suggests the need for novel
approaches to examine the relationship between time-
of-day of energy intake and BMI. This could be further
reinforced by Dubois et al.(41) who suggested that evening
intake affects BMI differently based on whether indivi-
duals were regular or irregular consumers of breakfast.
There was little data on how time-of-day of macronu-
trient intake influences BMI. To our knowledge, time-
of-day of macronutrient intake is critical to obesity,
given that lipid and glucose metabolism are influenced
by the circadian rhythm, a topic reviewed in a recent art-
icle by Oosterman et al(61). Consistent with this, a longi-
tudinal association between carbohydrate intake at
breakfast and the abdominal obesity component of the
metabolic syndrome was observed in the 1946 British
Birth Cohort(46). Likewise Dubois et al. reported that
overweight/obesity in breakfast skippers was related to
a higher carbohydrate intake at dinner(41). Collectively,
findings from both randomised controlled clinical trials
and longitudinal observational studies highlight the un-
equivocal role of the distribution of TEI across the day
plays on outcomes cardiometabolic disease risk factors,
including waist circumference and body weight(41).
Gaps in the literature and future research
Findings from the present review are limited by the small
number of published data in time-of day of energy intake
and the inconsistencies in the definition of eating patterns
or the so-called circadian rhythms of energy intake, as
well as obesity. Such limitations could be overcome in
the future by including unpublished results from other
cross-sectional surveys across the globe.
Although a number of studies investigated the distri-
bution of energy intake across the eating occasions,
there were few data as to the potential patterns of energy
distribution or so-called meal patterns that could be
observed in the studied populations. Indeed, in all of
the earlier studies, average intake of survey members at
the three main meals and snacks taken between meals
was provided. However, with the exception of Winkler
et al.(29), none of the earlier studies examined variation
in energy patterns over the day nor evaluated differences
in meal patterns in their population. This renders it diffi-
cult to postulate as to whether there are variations to this
traditional pattern. Although outside the scope of the
present review, Kerver et al. identified five patterns of
meal and snack intake in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey(24). Accordingly,
7·6 % of US adults reported consuming lunch, dinner
and two snacks, 8·3 % consumed breakfast, lunch, dinner
and no snacks, 13·1 % consumed breakfast, dinner and
two snacks, 15·4 % consumed breakfast, lunch, dinner
and one snack, and 31·6 % consumed breakfast, lunch,
dinner and two or more snacks(24). To date, it remains
unclear as to whether there are specific patterns of energy
distribution that could be more beneficial or detrimental
for health. Consequently, there is a need to elucidate how
these meal patterns have changed over time, and what
factors
influence
time-of-day of
energy
intake.
As
observed in the present review, there are differences in
the contribution of the main meals to energy intake
across the surveys. The latter raises the question as to
what meal should ideally be contributing the greatest
proportion of energy intake over the day. Although, evi-
dence exists to suggest that a greater energy intake later
in the evening is detrimental to health and is associated
with increased obesity, we are still far from understand-
ing whether, in relation to metabolic health, energy
should be distributed equally across the day or whether
it should be distributed with a descending pattern
where breakfast contributes the greatest proportion of
energy, followed by lunch and dinner. Evidence form
human studies appears to indicate that satiety decreases
progressively over the day, potentially implicating the
need to consume a greater proportion of energy earlier
in the day(62). However, recent evidence from animal
models indicates that living organisms are biphasic and
that, physiologically, eating two main meals a day (a big-
ger breakfast with a smaller dinner) but not one meal/d
(breakfast only) helps control body weight and fat
accumulation(63).
To date, only selected countries have recommenda-
tions on the distribution of energy over the day, whilst
more dietary recommendations provide nutrient- and
food-based guidelines. As such, further research is
required to shape future dietary guidelines.
One main limitation of the studies included in the pre-
sent review is that eating occasions were defined using
various methods such as using pre-defined meal slots,
self-defined meal slots and statistically defined methods.
There were inconsistencies in the definition of eating pat-
terns or the so-called circadian rhythms of eating. Several
studies described eating pattern as meal regularity or fre-
quency. In other studies, dietary patterns was synonym-
ously used as eating patterns and vice versa(64). This
highlights the need for a consensus to be reached in the
definition of eating patterns. Furthermore, there is a
need to develop novel statistical methods to investigate
the relationship between time-of-day of energy intake
and obesity, as intake at one eating occasion is likely to
be influenced by energy intake at another eating occa-
sion. Incorporating knowledge of time of energy intake
as well as time of energy intake in relation to the bio-
logical clock and time of awakening is important.
Finally, it is noteworthy that of the data presented in
the present review, only a small number of studies re-
presented nationally relevant data from on-going surveil-
lance studies. As such, findings from the present review
might not summarise current trends in time-of-day of
energy intake. Future studies should address the rela-
tionship between current trends in time-of-day of energy
intake and cardio-metabolic health outcomes, particular-
ly obesity.

Conclusion
The present review provides an indication of how energy
intake is distributed over the day across the globe.
Evidence of the association between time-of-day of
energy and obesity was limited indicating the need for
larger-scale collaborations between various countries
and regions in order to sum the data from existing sur-
veys and cohorts, and guide our understanding of the
role of chrono-nutrition in health.
