Purpose: An association of Lynch syndrome (LS) with breast cancer
has been long suspected; however, there have been insufficient data to
address this question for each of the LS genes individually.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of personal and
family history in 423 women with pathogenic or likely pathogenic
germ-line variants in MLH1 (N = 65), MSH2 (N = 94), MSH6
(N = 140), or PMS2 (N = 124) identified via clinical multigene
hereditary cancer testing. Standard incidence ratios (SIRs) of breast
cancer were calculated by comparing breast cancer frequencies in our
study population with those in the general population (Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results 18 data).
Results: When evaluating by gene, the age-standardized breast cancer
risks for MSH6 (SIR = 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56–2.86)
and PMS2 (SIR = 2.92; 95% CI, 2.17–3.92) were associated with a
statistically significant risk for breast cancer whereas no association
was observed for MLH1 (SIR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.42–1.83) or MSH2
(SIR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72–2.06).
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that two LS genes, MSH6 and
PMS2, are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer and
should be considered when ordering genetic testing for individuals
who have a personal and/or family history of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Germ-line pathogenic variants (PVs) in the mismatch repair
(MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, and 3′
deletions of EPCAM, a gene just upstream of MSH2, cause
Lynch syndrome (LS). There is evidence that cancer risk
depends on the affected gene. MLH1 and MSH2 are most
commonly associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.1
Additionally, MSH2 has been associated with a higher risk for
extracolonic cancers, and female MSH6 carriers may have the
highest risk of endometrial cancer. While the LS tumor
spectrum has been well established as including colon,
endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary
tract, ureter/renal pelvis, pancreas, brain, and sebaceous
neoplasms, the risks of other cancers, including breast,
prostate,
and
adrenocortical
tumors,
are
less
clearly
delineated.1,2
The MMR pathway is responsible for repairing single base
pair mismatches and small insertions or deletions that occur
when DNA polymerase attempts to replicate small repeat
sequences. Pathogenic variants within the MMR genes result
in errors in DNA repair, leading to an increased mutation
load in MMR-deficient cells.1 Screening for MMR deficiency
by microsatellite instability and immunohistochemistry assays
is often performed on colorectal and endometrial tumors to
identify patients with LS. Although screening for MMR
deficiency in breast tumors is currently not standard clinical
practice, multiple studies have shown that breast cancers from
women with LS are more likely to exhibit microsatellite
instability and loss of one or more MMR proteins via
immunohistochemistry,
compared
with
sporadic
breast
cancers.3–14
Clinical studies evaluating breast cancer risk in women with
LS have been conflicting, with some showing up to a fourfold
increased breast cancer risk and others reporting no increased
risk.15,16 Ascertainment bias may have affected results: many
previous LS studies assessing breast cancer ascertained their
study cohorts based on criteria heavily weighted toward
colorectal cancer. As a result, many study cohorts consisted
only of MLH1 and MSH2 carriers although some also
included MSH6.17–23 A few studies have included all four
MMR genes, but presented only a single combined breast
cancer risk, likely due to a small number of MSH6 and PMS2
carriers.15,16 Thus, the lack of consistent association of breast
cancer and LS in previous studies may reflect the genetic
composition of the cohorts. While it has been suggested that
breast cancer risk may vary by gene in LS, no one study has
examined gene- and age-specific breast cancer risks for all
four MMR genes. The aim of our study was to characterize

 breast cancer risks for each MMR gene in our group of
women who were identified to have a PV via germ-line
hereditary cancer panel testing for a variety of cancer-related
indications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
We retrospectively queried more than 50,000 women who had
multigene hereditary cancer panel testing completed at
GeneDx between 2013 and 2016, identifying 423 women
with a single germ-line pathogenic variant or likely patho-
genic variant (collectively referred to here as PV) in any of the
four MMR genes. All sequence variants were classified based
on the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for
the interpretation of sequence variants.24 Combined EPCAM-
MSH2 deletions were included in the MSH2 PV cohort.
Individuals with a second PV in an MMR or another gene
(excluding single PV in MUTYH) were excluded. A list of the
multigene panels (with gene lists) included and PVs identified
can be found in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 online.
Demographic, clinical, and family history information was
obtained from test requisition forms and accompanying
clinical documents supplied by the ordering provider at the
time of the test order. Pathology reports were not requested to
confirm diagnoses. Subjects were limited to females over the
age of 18. Breast cancer was defined as any invasive breast
neoplasm or ductal carcinoma in situ. This study was
approved
by
the
Western
Institutional
Review
Board,
Puyallup, WA (WIRB 20162523).
Technical/laboratory methods
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using a
QIAsymphony DNA kit, and from oral rinse using a
QIAsymphony
DSP
Virus/Pathogen
Midi
Kit
(Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Genomic DNA was enriched for the complete
coding region and splice-site junctions of the genes of interest
using custom SureSelect targeted capture (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA). Next-generation sequencing and deletion/dupli-
cation analysis were performed for all coding regions as well
as a portion of the 5′ untranslated region, 3′ untranslated
region, and intronic regions for all genes on each panel, with
the exception of EPCAM, for which only deletion/duplication
analysis was performed. The products were sequenced on
Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq instruments with paired-end reads
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). DNA sequence was mapped to a
masked version of the published human genome build
University of California–Santa Cruz hg19/GRCh37 reference
sequence using BWA-Mem version 0.7.8.25,26 Local realign-
ment around insertion/deletion sites and regions with poor
mapping quality was performed using the Genome Analysis
Toolkit version 1.6 IndelRealigner.27 Variant calls were
generated by the union of SAMtools version 0.1.18,28 Genome
Analysis
Toolkit
UnifiedGenotyper,27
and
a
GeneDx-
developed heuristic caller. Capillary sequencing (Applied
Biosystems/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) on a newly
extracted DNA sample was used to confirm all variants with
clinical or uncertain significance and to fill in sequence for
regions
with
fewer
than
15
reads
by
next-generation
sequencing. Any potential variant position with coverage of
fewer than 50 reads was reviewed by analysts and analyzed by
capillary sequencing if unclear. Long-range polymerase chain
reaction was used to distinguish variants in PMS2 from those
in the PMS2 pseudogene PMS2CL. Deletion/duplication
analysis was performed via custom-designed exon-targeted
array comparative genomic hybridization (Agilent). Con-
firmation
of
copy-number
changes

comparative genomic hybridization was performed by multi-
ple ligation-dependent probe amplification, repeat microarray
analysis, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction using the
Universal ProbeLibrary (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
Statistical analysis
Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for breast cancer were
calculated for each gene as the number of observed cancers to
the number of expected cancers based on breast cancer
incidence in the general population. The expected number of
cases was estimated for each 5-year age group from 20 to 85 as
the time at risk multiplied by the reference population
incidence rates. The population-based incidence rates were
obtained using SEER*Stat statistical software from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data,
which includes 18 cancer registries representing 27.8% of the
US population.29,30 Corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated using the Poisson approximation
distribution. SIRs for endometrial, colorectal, and ovarian
cancer were also calculated using their respective incidence
rates from SEER 18. All statistical analyses were conducted
using RStudio 0.99.902.31 The Kaplan–Meier method was
used to estimate cumulative risk and corresponding 95% CIs
for breast cancers to age 60, stratified by MMR gene.32 Log-
rank test was used to compare incidence rates between
groups. All reported p values are two-tailed with a significance
level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Cohort characteristics
Most of the 423 female MMR PV carriers in our study
reported Caucasian or European ancestry (72.1%, 305/423).
The average age at time of genetic testing was 52.5 (±12.1)
years (see Table 1 for further demographic details). The
distribution of MMR PVs was as follows: MSH6, 33.1%
(140/423); PMS2, 29.3% (124/423); MSH2, 22.2% (94/423);
MLH1, 15.4% (65/423). The 423 women in our study
harbored 241 unique PVs, the majority of which (87.5%,
370/423) were predicted to result in a truncated protein or a
transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay (start codon,
splice, cryptic splice, nonsense, deletion/duplication, frame-
shift), while the rest were missense or small in-frame deletions
(12.5%, 53/423) (Supplementary Figure S1).

 Cancer history and referral patterns
A personal history of breast cancer was reported in 25.3%
(107/423) of the cohort, with 1.4% (6/423) reporting a history
of more than one primary breast cancer. The average age
at first breast cancer diagnosis was 50.2 years (±11.7, range:
26–76).
Approximately half of the women with a MMR PV were
referred for testing with either the Comprehensive Cancer
Panel (24.6%, 104/423) or the Breast/Ovarian Cancer Panel
(24.3%, 103/423), both of which contain genes related to breast
cancer and LS (Supplementary Table S1). Twenty-six percent
(27/104) of Comprehensive Cancer and 45.6% (47/103) of
Breast/Ovarian Cancer Panel patients reported a personal
history of breast cancer. Twenty-eight percent (117/423) of the
women with MMR PVs were referred for the Colorectal Cancer
Panel or the Lynch Syndrome Panel. Of these 117 women, 2
(1.7%) had breast cancer. Reflex testing (more extensive genetic
testing after the first panel yielded normal results) identified
PVs in three women with breast cancer following a normal
result on the High-Risk Breast Cancer Panel.
Prevalence of breast, ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal
cancer varied among MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2
carriers (Figure 1a). After preliminary analyses, genes were
grouped based on similar breast cancer prevalence observed
in MMR PV carriers (MLH1/MSH2 vs. MSH6/PMS2). A
diagnosis of breast cancer, irrespective of other personal
cancer history, was reported more frequently in women with
MSH6 or PMS2 PVs (MSH6: 30%, 42/140; PMS2: 35.5%,
44/124) compared to women with MLH1 or MSH2 PVs
(MLH1: 10.8%, 7/65; MSH2: 14.9%, 14/94) (p o 0.001)
(Figure 1a). Furthermore, breast cancer in the absence of
LS-associated cancers was reported more frequently in
women with PVs in MSH6 or PMS2 (MSH6: 18.6%, 26/140;
PMS2: 29.0%, 36/124) compared to women with PVs in
MLH1 or MSH2 (MLH1: 3.1%, 2/65; MSH2: 4.3%, 4/94)
(p o 0.001) (Figure 1b).
The average numbers of reported breast, ovarian, endo-
metrial, and colorectal cancers per family showed similar
results to personal cancer histories (Figure 1c). Breast cancer
was more commonly reported in family members (up to third
degree as available) of probands with a PV in MSH6 or PMS2
(average number of reported cancers per family = 1.46 and
1.52) whereas colon cancer was more commonly reported in
family members of probands with a PV in MLH1 or MSH2
(2.62 and 2.12). The proportion of probands (excluding the
seven relatives in our cohort) reporting a personal or family
history of breast cancer but no colorectal, endometrial, or
ovarian cancer was lower among those with MLH1 or MSH2
PVs (MLH1: 0%, 0/65; MSH2: 2.2%, 2/92) than among those
with PVs in MSH6 or PMS2 (MSH6: 8.0%, 11/137; PMS2:
24.6%, 30/122) (p o 0.001).
SIR analysis and cumulative risk
Breast cancer risk was found to be approximately twofold
higher (SIR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.63–2.37) in our aggregate
mismatch
repair
PV
cohort
compared
to
the
general
population (Table 2). When evaluating by gene, only two of
the four MMR genes were found to have a statistically
significant increased association with breast cancer: MSH6
(SIR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.56–2.86) and PMS2 (SIR = 2.92; 95%
CI, 2.17–3.92). MLH1 (SIR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.416–1.83) and
MSH2 (SIR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.721–2.06) were not found to be
associated with breast cancer.
Cumulative incidence of breast cancer was calculated and
illustrated
via
Kaplan–Meier
analysis
(Figure
2).
The
cumulative incidence of breast cancer at the age of 60 was
found to be 37.7% (95% CI, 27.5–47.8) for PMS2, 31.1% (95%
CI, 21.9–40.7) for MSH6, 16.1% (95% CI, 7.3–27.9) for MSH2,
and 15.5% (95% CI, 5.5–30.2) for MLH1 PV carriers. MSH6
and PMS2 had a statistically significant greater cumulative
incidence of breast cancer compared with MLH1 and MSH2
(p o 0.001).
Clinical criteria
Unrelated probands (n = 416) were evaluated to determine if
they met Amsterdam II, Revised Bethesda Guidelines, and the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) BRCA1/2
Testing Criteria (Figure 3).33–35 Women with MLH1 (53.8%,
35/65) or MSH2 (43.5%, 40/92) PVs, compared with MSH6
and PMS2, were more likely to meet Amsterdam II criteria.
Women with MLH1 PVs most frequently met Revised
Bethesda Guidelines (50.8%, 33/65). A higher proportion of
women with MSH6 (64.2%, 88/137) or PMS2 (68.9%, 84/122)
PVs met NCCN BRCA1/2 testing criteria compared to those
with MLH1 (44.6%, 29/65) or MSH2 (45.7%, 42/92) PVs.

 Overall, our cohort of women with MMR PVs more
commonly met NCCN BRCA1/2 testing criteria (58.4%,
243/416) than any of the established LS clinical or testing
criteria (Amsterdam II: 23.8%, 99/416; Revised Bethesda:
22.8%, 95/416).
DISCUSSION
We describe the reported personal and family cancer histories
for a consecutive series of women identified to carry a single
germ-line MMR PV through clinical testing with hereditary
cancer gene panels. This study is the first, to our knowledge,
to provide gene-specific breast cancer risks for all four MMR
genes utilizing the same study cohort. In addition, unlike
many previous studies, our cohort was not ascertained based
on strict LS clinical criteria, suggesting our study population
may be more representative of the population undergoing
hereditary cancer testing. While many women had a personal
or family history of traditional cancers associated with LS
(colorectal, endometrial, or ovarian), 11.1% (46/416) reported
no personal or family history of these cancers. In the absence
of large panel testing, many might not have been tested for the
MMR genes. In addition, three women with breast cancer
were found to be positive for a MMR gene PV only after
having normal results on a smaller, high-risk breast panel.
We found a twofold and threefold increased risk of breast
cancer for the women with MSH6 and PMS2 PVs in our
cohort, whereas no breast cancer association was observed for
MLH1 or MSH2. PVs in MSH6 and PMS2 were found to
confer 31.1% and 37.7% cumulative risks for breast cancer by
the age of 60 while PVs in MLH1 or MSH2 were found to
confer breast cancer risks close to the expected general
population risk, 16.1% and 15.5%, respectively.
Due to differences in study design, cohort ascertainment,
and overall proportion of MSH6 and PMS2 PV carriers, many
previous studies evaluating breast cancer risk in association
with the MMR genes are not suitable for direct comparison
with our findings.15,16 In one retrospective study with a design
more similar to ours, Engel et al.21 found an almost twofold
increased breast cancer risk in a cohort of 1,107 women with
PVs in the MMR genes (SIR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.4).
Although Engel’s study did not include any women with
PMS2 PVs and included a smaller proportion of women with
MSH6 PVs (16.4%, C. Engel, personal communication) than
the current study (33.1%), our SIR of 1.96 for all four MMR
genes was similar to theirs.
As a clinical laboratory, it was important to determine
whether our calculated SIRs for breast cancer might be
skewed if our referral population were higher risk than the

 general population. We therefore calculated SIRs for well-
established female-specific LS-associated cancers (endometrial
and ovarian) using the same cohort of 423 women with MMR
PVs. In aggregate, the endometrial cancer risk was found to be
13-fold higher (SIR = 12.93; 95% CI, 10.87–15.37) while the
ovarian cancer risk was eightfold higher (SIR = 8.15; 95% CI,
6.61–10.95) compared with the general population, consistent
with published LS-associated endometrial (SIRs = 10–62)
and ovarian (SIRs = 7–14) cancer risks.36 As LS study
cohorts in the literature have historically been ascertained
using established clinical and/or testing criteria, resulting in
overestimation of published CRC risks, we did not use CRC
risks as a metric for comparison.37 The fact that the
endometrial and ovarian SIRs in our cohort are consistent
with previously published SIRs supports the validity of our
approach.
Our findings suggest that the current LS clinical testing
criteria may not be sufficiently sensitive, particularly for
MSH6 and PMS2. Hegde et al.38 reported that MSH6 and
PMS2 account for approximately 7–10% and o5%, respec-
tively, of LS families. When applying Amsterdam II criteria to
our cohort, consistent with Hedge et al., only 10.9% of women
with MSH6 and 7.4% of PMS2 PVs would have been
identified. The overall low proportion of women with MMR
PVs meeting Amsterdam II Criteria (23.9%), compared with
those meeting NCCN BRCA1/2 testing criteria (58.2%),
underscores the need to continuously reconsider the criteria
for which genes to test.

 This study has several limitations. First, the clinical
information used in this study was limited to that provided
with the testing sample. In addition, the study population
consisted only of women considered candidates for genetic
testing by their providers and may not be representative of all
women with MMR PVs. As our overall testing cohort was
comprised largely of women with a personal or family history
of breast cancer, SIRs might be biased and will need to be
confirmed in other studies. It is notable that the race/ethnicity
distribution between this study cohort and the general
population differs slightly among certain groups.39 To address
these potential differences we conducted sensitivity analyses
limited to those reported to be only Caucasian/European
(non-Hispanic white) in our cohort using breast cancer SEER
rates for non-Hispanic white females and found similar
results (results not shown). Finally, given our retrospective
study design, our estimates of cumulative survival may be
overestimated because we may have differentially tested
women with longer survival. It is also possible that the
retrospective design and young average age at time of testing
(52.1 years in this study) underestimates the cumulative
incidence. To deal with this latter bias, we estimated
cumulative incidence to age 60 only. Prospective validation
of our findings will be needed to minimize these and other
potential biases.
This study suggests that women with PVs in MSH6 or
PMS2 may benefit from increased breast cancer screening.
Replication of our gene-specific breast cancer risks will be
important to the future development of breast cancer
management guidelines for female LS patients. In addition,
further assessment of MMR deficiency in breast tumors may
provide more information with which to evaluate the link
between MMR genes and breast cancer. Finally, family studies
of additional individuals with MMR PVs may also provide
better breast cancer risk estimates.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PVs in MSH6 or
PMS2 are associated with a modest but statistically significant
increased risk for breast cancer. Previously, the identification
of a PV in MSH6 or PMS2 in a woman with breast cancer may
have been considered an incidental finding. Here we show
that PVs in MSH6 or PMS2 are associated with breast cancer
and that these MMR genes should be considered when
ordering a multigene panel for women with a personal or
family history of breast cancer.
