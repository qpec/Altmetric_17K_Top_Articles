ABSTRACT
Anurans show the highest diversity in reproductive modes of all vertebrate taxa, with
a variety of associated breeding behaviours. One striking feature of anuran
reproduction is amplexus. During this process, in which the male clasps the female,
both individuals’ cloacae are juxtaposed to ensure successful external fertilization.
Several types of amplexus have evolved with the diversification of anurans, and
secondary loss of amplexus has been reported in a few distantly related taxa. Within
Nyctibatrachus, a genus endemic to the Western Ghats of India, normal axillary
amplexus, a complete loss of amplexus, and intermediate forms of amplexus have all
been suggested to occur, but many species remain unstudied. Here, we describe the
reproductive behaviour of N. humayuni, including a new type of amplexus. The
dorsal straddle, here defined as a loose form of contact in which the male sits on the
dorsum of the female prior to oviposition but without clasping her, is previously
unreported for anurans. When compared to known amplexus types, it most closely
resembles the form of amplexus observed in Mantellinae. Furthermore, we prove
that, opposed to the situation in most anurans, male semen release happens before
egg deposition. We hypothesize that the male ejaculates on the female’s dorsum and
that sperm subsequently runs from her back and hind legs before fertilizing the eggs.
A second feature characterizing anuran breeding is the advertisement call, mostly
produced solely by males. Despite recent descriptions of several new Nyctibatrachus
species, few studies have explored their vocal repertoire. We describe both the male
advertisement call and a female call for N. humayuni. The presence of a female call
has not been reported within Nyctibatrachidae, and has been reported in less than
0.5% of anuran species. Altogether, our results highlight a striking diversity and
several unique aspects of Nyctibatrachus breeding behaviour.

 INTRODUCTION
Anurans exhibit considerable diversity in their reproductive modes, with differences
occurring, for example, in oviposition sites, larval development, and parental care
(Crump, 1974; Haddad & Prado, 2005; Crump, 2015). One behaviour characteristic of
nearly all anuran species’ reproduction is amplexus. This behaviour, whereby the male
takes the female in an embrace, is considered to have evolved to optimize successful
fertilization of the eggs. Because fertilization is external in most anurans, the juxtaposition
of the male and female cloacae during amplexus helps to synchronize egg deposition and
the release of sperm (Duellman & Trueb, 1986: 68–70; Wells, 2007: 452–458). Several
forms of amplexus have been described, with inguinal and axillary being the most
widespread. Inguinal amplexus, in which the male clasps the female around her waist, is
considered the ancestral state and is found in the oldest anuran lineages (Duellman &
Trueb, 1986: 68–70; Wells, 2007: 452). Axillary amplexus, in which the male grasps the
female in her armpits, is sometimes considered to be more efficient because the cloacae are
better juxtaposed (Rabb & Rabb, 1963). While there is no evidence that axillary amplexus
results in higher fertilization rates than inguinal amplexus, species with axillary
amplexus may require less time to lay their eggs, thereby reducing an amplectant pair’s
vulnerability to predators (Wells, 2007: 456). Other forms of amplexus, in addition to
axillary amplexus and inguinal amplexus, have evolved in some lineages (Duellman &
Trueb, 1986: 68–70). A complete loss of amplexus has been observed in a few distantly
related taxa (Limerick, 1980; Kunte, 2004; Zhang et al., 2012).
Another distinctive behaviour associated with anuran reproduction is calling. The
vocal repertoire of male frogs and toads is well known, with the advertisement call, which
is produced to attract mates and signal presence towards other males, being present in all
but a few species (Wells & Schwartz, 2007). Male advertisement calls are species specific
and can convey information about the signaller to other individuals. A key function of
male advertisement calls is in premating species isolation (Gerhardt & Huber, 2002). It is,
therefore, important to record and describe advertisement calls, as they can provide
useful information in both taxonomical and evolutionary frameworks. Female calls are
less well known because they are rare and seldom observed. For example, females in only a
few anuran species are known to produce true advertisement calls (e.g., Emerson, 1992;
Bush, Dyson & Halliday, 1996; Bush, 1997; Bosch & Ma
´rquez, 2001). The use of courtship
calls by females engaged in close-range interactions with males has been reported in a
number of species (e.g., Given, 1993; Tobias, Viswanathan & Kelley, 1998; Bosch, 2002;
Shen et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2010). In some species, females produce a territorial call upon
disturbance (Capranica, 1968; Wells, 1980; Stewart & Rand, 1991). Females in some
anuran species also produce a release call when they are amplexed but unreceptive, or
amplexed by an undesired male (Brzoska, Walkowiak & Schneider, 1977; Gollmann,
Benko
¨ & Ho
¨dl, 2009).
The genus Nyctibatrachus Boulenger, 1882 is endemic to the Western Ghats of India and
comprises 28 known species, many of which have only recently been described (Das &
Kunte, 2005; Biju et al., 2011; Gururaja et al., 2014; Frost, 2015). Nyctibatrachus species
Willaert et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2117
2/21
 vary in snout-vent length (SVL) from 10.0 mm (N. minimus Biju et al., 2007) to 76.9 mm
(N. grandis Biju et al., 2011) and are either stream-associated or found in the leaf litter, the
latter making use of small puddles for reproduction (Biju et al., 2007; Biju et al., 2011;
Van Bocxlaer et al., 2012). Information about their natural history is scarce, and the
conservation status of many species is unknown, with only 15 out of the 28 species having
been assessed by the IUCN Red List (including four that are considered data deficient)
(Biju et al., 2011; IUCN, 2014). Furthermore, male advertisement calls have only been
described in four species (Kuramoto & Joshy, 2001; Gururaja et al., 2014).
Despite their poorly understood ecology, several studies suggest the presence of
interesting forms of reproductive behaviour (Kunte, 2004; Biju et al., 2011; Gramapurohit,
Gosavi & Phuge, 2011; Gururaja et al., 2014). In all Nyctibatrachus species, egg clutches are
deposited on rocks or vegetation overhanging water, and tadpoles fall in the water after
hatching, where they continue their development and metamorphosis (Biju et al., 2011;
Gururaja et al., 2014). Different kinds of amplexus behaviours have been described within
this genus. Pairs of N. kumbara Gururaja et al., 2014, for example, perform a short axillary
amplexus followed by a handstand. The female then deposits the eggs from this upside
down position directly after the male has dismounted (Gururaja et al., 2014). Afterwards,
males of N. kumbara cover the deposited eggs with a layer of mud, a behaviour previously
unknown for anurans. In N. aliciae Inger et al., 1984, N. humayuni Bhaduri & Kripalani,
1955, N. jog Biju et al., 2011 and N. minor Inger et al., 1984 a short, loose physical contact
between the male and female takes place as the male sits on the dorsum of the female but
does not clasp her as in a normal axillary amplexus (Biju et al., 2011; Gramapurohit,
Gosavi & Phuge, 2011). In other species, such as N. petraeus Das & Kunte, 2005, amplexus
behaviour may be completely absent, with the female depositing the eggs prior to the male
fertilizing them (Kunte, 2004; Das & Kunte, 2005). On one occasion, amplexus was
observed in N. petraeus five minutes before egg deposition took place, and the author
therefore considered this to be a type of ‘pseudo-amplexus’ (Kunte, 2004).
Together the available data indicates a wide range of breeding-associated behaviours in
Nyctibatrachus, with a new form of amplexus and an intrageneric variation in amplexus
types previously unreported in anurans. To better understand the reproductive behaviour
of Nyctibatrachus frogs, we observed breeding and associated vocalizations in a wild
population of N. humayuni. Here, we describe both the male advertisement call and a
female call, and discuss the different behavioural steps involved in reproduction based on
field observations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field surveys and behavioral observations
We spent a total of 40 nights in the field during July and August 2010 and 2012 studying a
population of Nyctibatrachus humayuni. The population was located in a dense forest
near Humbarli village, Koyna, Satara District, Maharashtra (coordinates 17�24′10.8″N,
73�44′13.2″E, 827 m asl) (Fig. S1A). Males were easily located by their calls while females,
which were harder to find, were more often encountered by chance. Sex was determined
by the presence of femoral glands in males and their absence in females (Biju et al., 2011).

 The moment a female was observed approaching a male, we started filming the event
using a camera with infrared function (Sony HDR-XR 550VE). In most such instances, we
used infrared light to avoid disturbing the animals and affecting their behaviour. Movies
were analysed with iMovie 8.0.6 (Apple Inc.) to determine the duration of different
steps of reproduction. In order to test the assumption that fertilization happens after the
female has left the oviposition site (Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge, 2011), Ziploc� bags
were placed around egg clutches directly after deposition on five occasions to hinder
male contact with the eggs. To determine the duration of embryo development, deposited
and fertilised clutches were monitored every evening until hatching occurred.
Call recording
The advertisement calls of eight males and the calls of one female were recorded on a
solid-state digital recorder (Marantz PMD620, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, 16-bit resolution)
using a directional shotgun microphone (Sennheiser ME 66). A minimum of 20 calls were
recorded per individual. Microphones were handheld and positioned at a distance of
approximately 75 cm from the target animal. Sounds were monitored in real time using
headphones (Sony MDR-V500). At the end of each recording, the calling individual was
captured and its SVL was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital callipers. A
portable digital balance was used to measure body mass to the nearest 0.01 g. These two
measures of body size were used to compute a measure of body condition (i.e., length
independent mass) following Baker (1992). Condition was estimated as the residuals from
a regression of the cube root of mass on SVL divided by SVL.We used these measures of
SVL body mass and body condition to assess whether any call properties were correlated
with body size and condition. Recorded frogs were released at their calling site
immediately after obtaining body size measurements. To avoid recording the same
individual twice, we only recorded animals that were widely spaced (> 15 m). Since the
study area was large (ca. 250 m � 30 m) and males of this species are territorial, being
found sitting next to or on previously deposited egg clutches on subsequent nights, the
chance of recording the same individual multiple times was negligible (Gramapurohit,
Gosavi & Phuge, 2011). As call properties can vary with temperatures in anurans
(Gerhardt & Huber, 2002), we recorded both dry bulb and wet bulb air temperatures
(± 0.2 �C) at the animal’s calling site using a thermometer (Jennson Delux).
This study was conducted with permissions and guidelines from the responsible
authorities in the State Forest Department of Maharashtra. Study permit:
D-22 (8)/Research/4543/2012-13, dated 1-03-2012. This study did not sample animals for
any captive or laboratory studies. All observations were made in the wild. Recorded frogs
were released back at their calling site immediately after measuring the body size and
body mass.
Call analysis
We used Raven Pro 1.4 (Charif, Waack & Strickman, 2010) to measure 32 acoustic
properties for each of the 160 advertisement calls recorded from the eight males. Raven’s
waveform display was used to measure 21 temporal properties, while 11 spectral

 properties were measured using the spectrogram slice view (1024pt. FFT, Hanning
window). A description of the measured properties is provided in Table S1A. Properties
are analyzed after Bee, Suyesh & Biju (2013a) and Bee, Suyesh & Biju (2013b). Coefficients
of variation (CV ¼ standard deviation/mean) were computed to describe patterns of
both within-individual (CVw) and between-individual (CVb) variation in call parameters
and are expressed her as percentages (Gerhardt, 1991). Correlation of any of the acoustic
parameters with physical characteristics (SVL, body mass and body condition) and
temperature was explored by performing Spearman rank correlations using the software
package Statistica v7.1 (Statsoft). Due to the low sample size, these correlation analyses
should be considered exploratory and are not intended to test any specific hypotheses.
Five temporal and four spectral properties were measured for the 20 calls recorded from
one female (Table S1B). Since we only recorded the call of a single female, descriptive
statistics and correlations with other parameters could not be carried out.
RESULTS
Reproductive behaviour
Breeding took place in and around a stream in which the water level heavily depended on
the weather conditions (Figs. S1B and S1C). Males were observed calling from different
positions along the stream. They were perched on rocks, vegetation and fallen trees, all
bordering or overhanging the water (Video S1). Their vertical position ranged from
partially submerged to up to four metres high on trees. Females were observed moving
slowly between the territories of different males. A schematic overview of the reproductive
sequence is shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and videos of the different steps are provided as
Supplementary Information.
When a female approaches a male (Figs. 1A and 2A; Video S2), she sits in front of him
and creeps backwards until her abdomen is placed over his head, making physical contact
(Figs. 1B and 2B; Video S3). At this moment, the male mounts the female. If the male
does not react, the female will repeat this physical contact. When mounted, the male rests
on the female without grabbing her in a firm amplexus, and instead uses his hands to hold
on to the leaf or branch on which the pair sits (Figs. 1C and 2C; Video S4). Lateral
movements in the male’s flank were observed during this stage in a few of the breeding
sequences (Video S4). This loose form of amplexus is of short duration, lasting on average
768 s (n = 21, range: 338–1670 s). At the end of this embrace, the female strongly and
repeatedly arches her back followed by the male immediately dismounting (Fig. 1D;
Video S5), a behaviour known from other species too (Gosner & Rossman, 1959). The
female deposits eggs in a single bout immediately after the male dismounts (Figs. 1E and 2D;
Video S6). Oviposition takes only a few seconds and occurs without any form of physical
contact between the sexes. The female then remains motionless, with her hind legs
stretched around the freshly deposited clutch (Figs. 1E and 2D; Video S6). It takes on
average 479 s (n = 17, range: 260–961 s) before the female moves after egg laying. After this
first movement, it takes another 728 s (n = 11, range: 405–1692 s) before she jumps back
into the stream. During this period, the male is sitting nearby. There is, however, no
physical contact between the two sexes after egg deposition.

 During several of the observed breeding sequences, the male crawled back over the
eggs after the female had moved away (Figs. 1F and 2E), but we did not see this on every
occasion. This prompted us to test whether fertilization had already happened during an
earlier stage. We tested this by placing a Ziploc� bag around five egg clutches directly
after deposition, and in this way prevented the male from having any further contact
with the eggs (Video S7). Interestingly, in all five clutches, the fertilization rate was
100%. In at least half of the observations we made (nine observations), reproduction was
interrupted by one or both of the frogs falling into the water (Video S6, Examples 6 and 7).
Fallen individuals returned to the same position to continue the mating sequence,
except when strong currents swept them away. Males showed high site fidelity, with new
eggs being deposited directly next to present clutches or in close vicinity (� 50 cm).
When a female approached a male calling from a position away from his previously
fertilized clutches, the male moved towards those eggs upon the first contact while
continuing to produce advertisement calls as the female followed. Males are known
to defend their territories (Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge, 2011), and we witnessed
a single event of aggression where the resident male chased off an intruder
(Video S8).
We monitored 15 egg clutches from the moment of deposition until hatching. Of the
15 clutches, 12 were eaten before hatching took place. These cases of predation were rarely
observed but could easily be distinguished from hatched clutches, because in hatched

 clutches, the jelly remained visible on the substrate after hatching, in contrast to instances
of predation, where most of the jelly was removed. In one of the remaining three clutches,
hatching started 18 days after oviposition and all larvae had fallen into the stream by
the 19th day. In the other two clutches, hatching started after 19 days and finished one
and two days later (Figs. 2F and 2G).
Male advertisement calls
Male advertisement calls are composed of two distinct parts, with the first part being
non-pulsatile and the second part having a pulsatile temporal structure (Fig. 3A;
Audios S1 and S2). A detailed overview of analysed properties, including the variation
both within and between individuals, is given in Table S2.

 The mean call duration was 532 ms (range: 483–630 ms). On average, calls reached
their full amplitude in 268 ms (rise time) and decreased in amplitude over the last 262 ms
of the call (fall time). Both rise time and fall time were approximately 50% of the total call
duration (Table S2A). The second part of calls consisted of 16–24 pulses, with a mean
pulse period of 13.2 ms and a mean pulse duration of 12.8 ms. These pulses were
produced at rates of 74–84 pulses/s. Individual pulses had mean rise and fall times of
4.7 and 8.1 ms, respectively (Table S2C).
The mean dominant frequency, measured over entire calls, was 1.34 kHz (1.11–1.45
kHz) with relatively low variation between calls produced by the same individual
(CVw ¼ 3.73%) compared to the magnitude of variation observed among the eight
individuals (CVb ¼ 8.19%). The dominant frequency of the first, non-pulsatile part of the
call ranged between 0.91–1.45 kHz while in the second, pulsatile part the dominant
frequency ranged between 1.17–1.47 kHz (as calculated from first pulse, middle pulse and
last pulse) (Table S2). Frequency modulation is present in the first, non-pulsatile part of
the call, but absent in the second, pulsatile part. The dominant frequency increased by
approximately 30% during the first part of the call, from 1027 Hz (mean dominant
frequency 1) to 1336 Hz (mean dominant frequency 4) in less than 300 ms (Table S2B).
Results of correlation tests are presented in Table S3. SVL and body mass of the
different recorded males and corresponding temperature data is presented in Table S4.
The mean (± SD) dry bulb and wet bulb air temperatures during our study were 22.2 ±
0.6 �C and 22.7 ± 0.4 �C, respectively. There were no correlations between these
temperatures and the acoustic properties analysed. Though temporal properties are
frequently correlated with temperature, we attribute this lack of temperature effects on call
properties to the very small temperature variation across our recordings (< 2.1 �C dry
bulb air temperature; < 1.1 �C wet bulb air temperature).
Several spectral properties were correlated with our measures of body size. The overall
dominant frequency of the entire call was significantly negatively correlated with body
mass (Table S3A). The dominant frequencies measured separately over the first and
second halves of the call were also significantly negatively correlated to body mass

 (Tables S3B and S3C). The overall dominant frequency of the entire call was also
negatively correlated with the SVL (Table S3A). The overall dominant frequency,
dominant frequency 2, and dominant frequency 4 of the 1st half were significantly
negatively correlated with SVL (Table S3B). The overall dominant frequency and
dominant frequency of the first and last pulses of the second, pulsatile part of the call were
also significantly negatively correlated with SVL (Table S3C). The correlation of dominant
frequency 1 and dominant frequency 3 with SVL were marginally non-significant in the
first half of the call (Table S3B). Only one temporal property, pulse 50% rise time of
maximum amplitude pulse, was correlated with body mass (Table S3C).
With only one exception, there were no significant correlations between body condition
and the acoustic properties measured in this study (Table S3). The exception was the
temporal property of fall time of the first part of the call, which was significantly negatively
correlated with body condition (Table S3B). Several spectral properties had reasonably
strong negative correlations with body condition (-0.69 � r � -0.62), but these
correlations were not quite significant (0.06 � P � 0.10; Table S3B). Body condition can
sometimes be strongly related to certain temporal call properties associated with higher
energetic demands, such as fast pulse rates (Jakob, Marshall & Uetz, 1996). Although
overall pulse rate was not related to body condition (Table S3C), two measures of
individual pulse period (¼ 1/pulse rate) had correlations with body mass that approached
significance (r ¼ -0.69, P ¼ 0.06; Table S3C). We attribute the general lack of
significant effects of body condition on several analysed call properties to our small
sample size.
Female call
Female Nyctibatrachus humayuni calls were only rarely observed (four individuals), as
females do not seem to vocalize on a regular basis. A single female calling from a height
of 2.5 m above the ground was recorded. It produced about 50 calls in about 30 minutes.
These calls sounded similar to the calls we heard other females produce (Table S5; Video S9).
The female call is quite distinct from the male advertisement call (Fig. 3B; Audio S3;
Video S9). The call is short, consisting of a single note, with a mean call duration of
83 ms and a rapid onset (call rise time ¼ 16 ms). The call’s frequency spectrum is
characterized by several frequency peaks, with the lowest three peaks having mean
frequencies of 1.45 kHz (Dominant frequency 1), 2.90 kHz (Dominant frequency 2) and
4.37 kHz (Dominant frequency 3), respectively. The overall dominant frequency of the
call was 2.85 kHz (range 1.39–3.10 kHz). Based on measures of within-individual CVs,
spectral properties were less variable (2.53 � CVw � 12.37%) compared to temporal
properties (18.30 � CVw � 58.04%). The call 50% rise time and call 50% fall time were
more variable compared to other temporal properties. During two of our observations of
female calling behaviour in N. humayuni, the female only initiated calling when she
had not succeeded in reaching a calling male after trying for considerable time (more
than 30 minutes). On one of these occasions the male immediately changed his position
as soon as the female called. Although the male’s response resulted in him calling from
a new position closer to the stream and to the female, she still failed to locate him.

 DISCUSSION
New form of amplexus
The loose amplexus observed here in Nyctibatrachus humayuni differs from all previously
described amplexus types in anurans (Duellman & Trueb, 1986: 68–70) (Figs. 4A–4F). Our
observations indicate there is some similarity between amplexus in N. humayuni and that
observed in some mantellid frogs, whereby the male sits with his abdomen on the female’s
head (Blommers-Schlo
¨sser, 1975; Glaw & Vences, 2007: 144, 186, 200, 204; Altig, 2008).
Duellman & Trueb (1986: 69) defined this type of amplexus as a straddle, and it was later
more specifically called a head straddle (Savage, 2002: 166). The form of contact described
in this study resembles this head straddle, but the male is positioned lower on the female,
with his abdomen placed on her lower dorsum. When mounted, the male rests on the
female without grabbing her tightly, but instead uses his hands to hold on to a leaf, branch
or tree trunk (Figs. 1C, 2C and 4J–4K). On some occasions his hands may rest on her arms
or hands (Figs. 4H–4I). Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge (2011) considered this to be
cephalic amplexus, similar to that present in some dendrobatids. Because the male does
not press the backside of his hands against the female’s throat, we believe this term
should not be used (Wells, 1980). We therefore propose to name this behaviour a dorsal
straddle. A dorsal straddle can be defined as a loose form of amplexus in which the male
sits on top of the female with his abdomen positioned on her lower dorsum. The male
does not, however, grasp the female under her armpits or head, but instead places his
hands on the leaf, branch or tree trunk the pair is sitting on (Figs. 1C and 2C). At the
moment, dorsal straddle is known to occur in N. humayuni only, but observations made
in other Nyctibatrachus species (Biju et al., 2011) might also correspond with this newly-
defined type of amplexus.
We speculate that a loose form of contact, with the male holding on to the substrate
rather than to the female, as seen during a dorsal straddle, might function to avoid falling
and interrupting mating. In Guibemantis depressiceps (Boulenger, 1882), which uses a
head straddle during amplexus, pulsing movements in the male flanks were observed
during a short period of physical contact (Blommers-Schlo
¨sser, 1975), similar to the ones
observed here for Nyctibatrachus humayuni (Video S4). The function of these pulsations is
unclear, but similar movements during amplexus have been observed in several other frog
species (Savage, 1932; Rabb & Rabb, 1963; Weygoldt, 1976; Cui et al., 2010). It has been
proposed that these movements might stimulate ovulation by the female (Duellman &
Trueb, 1986: 71; Cui et al., 2010).
Moment of fertilization
The loose contact during amplexus, and the lack of any physical contact between both
sexes during oviposition, that we have described is rarely seen among anurans. Our
observations significantly extend those made by Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge (2011) of
the same species. Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge (2011) observed a subsequent step after
oviposition, in which the male placed himself on top of the eggs, and they considered this
to be the moment of fertilization (Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge, 2011). In our study,
Willaert et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2117

 however, all clutches covered with a Ziploc� bag immediately after oviposition showed a
100% fertilization rate, proving that semen release must happen before clutch deposition,
since the male dismounts the female just before oviposition (Videos S5 and S7). This is
remarkable, since amplexus is considered to increase chances of successful fertilization by
synchronizing egg deposition and semen release (Duellman & Trueb, 1986: 68–70).
A complete lack of physical contact between male and female during egg deposition is,
therefore, rarely seen in anurans (Wells, 2007: 458, 513). Our findings are inconsistent
with the idea of the male fertilizing the eggs after deposition, as postulated by

 Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge (2011), and instead suggest that semen release must take
place during the dorsal straddle. We hypothesize that the male releases his sperm on the
female’s back and the eggs are subsequently fertilized by the semen running down her back
and hind legs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that female remains
motionless after egg deposition, for 479 s on average, with her hind legs stretched around
the freshly deposited clutch (Figs. 1E and 2D; Video S6). Furthermore, similar behaviour
has been reported for Blommersia wittei (Guibe
´, 1974), B. blommersae (Guibe
´, 1975),
Guibemantis depressiceps and G. liber (Peracca, 1893), among others (Blommers-Schlo
¨sser,
1975; Glaw & Vences, 2007: 144, 186, 200, 204; Altig, 2008). In these Malagasy frogs, males
engage in a head straddle with females and dismount the female before she finishes egg
deposition.
In Guibemantis depressiceps, multiple males were observed sitting on a female’s head
during a single egg deposition event, and the female exhibited lethargic behaviour,
remaining stretched around the clutch for at least an hour after deposition had finished
(Altig, 2008). For these mantellid frogs, the hypothesis of sperm running from the female
back has also been assumed (Blommers-Schlo
¨sser, 1975; Altig, 2008). The exact moment of
semen release could not be observed, as this was not possible with the naked eye during
extremely wet field conditions, a problem also mentioned by Altig (2008). The male might
release his semen just before dismounting the female. The eggs are then subsequently
fertilized by sperm running down her back. Another possibility is that sperm is gradually
released during amplexus and that the eggs are eventually deposited on top of the sperm.
This last option has been observed in some species of Dendrobatoidea (Weygoldt, 1980).
A few anurans make use of internal fertilization (Townsend et al., 1981; Stephenson &
Verrell, 2003), but for N. humayuni this is very unlikely as males lack an intromittent
organ and only limited contact between the two sexes exists.
In Nyctibatrachus petraeus there is no physical contact at all, and it is believed that the
male fertilizes the eggs after the female has deposited the clutch (Kunte, 2004). In this
species the female is reported to immediately leave after egg deposition (Kunte, 2004),
contrasting with our findings of N. humayuni females. Gururaja et al. (2014) do not
mention the moment of fertilization in N. kumbara, but it is unlikely to happen as in one
of the methods described above. Since the female deposits the eggs from an upside-down
position, sperm cannot run down from her back onto the eggs. Furthermore, the male
only touches the eggs with his hands after deposition, to cover them with mud (Gururaja
et al., 2014). Future studies regarding the reproductive behaviour of Nyctibatrachus should
aim to pinpoint when semen is released and how fertilization is achieved.
Egg development and egg attendance
Of the egg clutches monitored, 80% were eaten by predators before hatching. During a
single occasion, a Boiga sp. (tree snake) was observed eating a N. humayuni egg clutch
(Video S10). Another water snake, Rhabdops olivaceus (Beddome, 1863), was frequently
observed around the oviposition sites but no direct observation of predation was made.
Gramapurohit, Gosavi & Phuge (2011) reported an egg stage duration of 11–13 days in
their study population, which is much shorter than our observation of 18–21 days
Willaert et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2117
12/21
 (Figs. 2F–2G). An egg stage of 12–15 days and 8 days were observed for Nyctibatrachus
petraeus and N. kumbara, respectively (Kunte, 2004; Gururaja et al., 2014), while for
N. aliciae an egg stage of 8–9 days was observed in a clutch studied in captivity (Biju et al.,
2011). As egg development duration is negatively correlated with temperature within a
certain optimal range (Duellman & Trueb, 1986: 120–124; Wells, 2007: 124, 499), a higher
number of observations and associated temperature data will be needed to address this
variation.
Males were seen each night in the same location, sitting near or on the developing
clutches that had resulted from earlier successful mating encounters. Egg attendance by
the male, or both male and female, is known for all Nyctibatrachus species in which
reproductive behaviour has been studied (Kunte, 2004; Biju et al., 2011; Gramapurohit,
Gosavi & Phuge, 2011; Gururaja et al., 2014). The function of egg attendance has not yet
been studied in this genus, but it might prevent desiccation or reduce predation risk by
arthropods, both of which have already been confirmed in other anuran taxa (Crump,
2015). More specific parental care has been documented for N. kumbara and N. grandis.
Nyctibatrachus kumbara males cover the egg clutch with mud, possibly preventing
dehydration or providing camouflage against predation (Gururaja et al., 2014). Males of
N. grandis have been observed inflating their body upon disturbance and making attempts
to bite would-be predators, including human observers (Biju et al., 2011).
Male call
The advertisement calls of only a few Nyctibatrachus species have been described
(Kuramoto & Joshy, 2001; Gururaja et al., 2014). Gururaja et al. (2014) provide a brief
description of the calls of N. kumbara, N. jog and N. kempholeyensis (Rao, 1937), while a
concise description of the call of N. major Boulenger, 1882 is given by Kuramoto & Joshy
(2001). In N. kumbara and N. kempholeyensis two distinct call types are distinguished; in
N. kumbara one of these types was produced more frequently when a female was present
(Gururaja et al., 2014). Our recordings were made in the absence of females. Therefore, we
cannot exclude the possibility that in N. humayuni too, distinct call types are present. The
advertisement call from male N. humayuni described here is complex, consisting of an
initial, unpulsed part with frequency modulation and a second, pulsed part without
frequency modulation (Fig. 3A; Table S2). The call of N. jog also has a pulsed second part
of the call (Gururaja et al., 2014). The call of N. humayuni can be distinguished from the
call of N. major, the type I call of N. kumbara, and both types of call of N. kempholeyensis
by call duration. With an average duration of 0.53 s, the call is longer than the type I call of
N. kumbara (0.11 s) and the call of N. major (0.05 s), while being substantially shorter
than both call types of N. kempholeyensis (5.17 and 11.69 s for the type I and type II calls,
respectively). Although call duration is similar between N. humayuni and the call of
N. jog and the type II call of N. kumbara, the dominant frequency of N. humayuni calls is
lower (1.33 kHz) than that of N. kumbara type II calls (1.53 kHz) and N. jog calls
(1.51 kHz).
Our results show a significant negative correlation between male body size and
dominant frequency (Table S3). This is the case for many anuran species, in which
Willaert et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2117
13/21
 relatively larger individuals’ calls are characterized by relatively lower dominant
frequencies. Larger males tend to have more massive vocal cords and, consequently,
produce lower-frequency calls (Martin, 1971). In some species, females show a preference
for low frequency calls and hence larger males (Ryan, 1980; Wollerman, 1998). However,
experimental studies have also shown that in other species no preference is given to lower
frequencies (Rosso, Castellano & Giacoma, 2006). Furthermore, female preference can vary
between different populations within a single species (Schrode et al., 2012). Within
Nyctibatrachus, only a few species’ calls have been described, and no data on female
preferences for spectral properties are available, making it impossible to draw conclusions
without further bioacoustic research on this group.
Female call
The discovery of a female call is remarkable, as this is rarely observed in frogs and toads.
Female calling behaviour has so far been reported in–to our knowledge–only 25 anurans,
representing less than 0.5% of the total of 6583 anuran species that are currently
recognized (25/01/2016) (Frost, 2015). An overview of the species for which a female call
has been reported is given in Table S6. Female calling in Nyctibatrachus humayuni was
observed only briefly and on just four occasions over a total of 40 nights in the field,
compared to the almost permanent presence of male advertisement calls. The female call
of N. humayuni is shorter and less complex than that of the male, consisting of a single,
unpulsed note (Fig. 3B; Video S9). A short and less intense female call is also observed in
other anuran species (Given, 1987; Emerson, 1992; Cui et al., 2010) and can, in part, be
explained by the smaller size of laryngeal and oblique muscles of the female (Emerson &
Boyd, 1999). A female call is not known from any other species of Nyctibatrachus. Since
documentation of the presence of female calls can be done with more confidence than
their absence (Wells, 2007: 282), female vocalizations might be more common than
currently believed, both among Nyctibatrachus species and across all anuran taxa more
generally (Emerson & Boyd, 1999).
Observed male responses to female calls include positive phonotaxis and changes in
male vocalization rate (Emerson & Boyd, 1999; Shen et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2010), suggesting that female vocalization is important in mate location and
recognition. In this and other Nyctibatrachus species, calling males are often located in
difficult to reach locations (e.g. vegetation overhanging the water) that might be accessed
only by leaping towards them directly from the stream. It is likely that in such a situation
the female will mainly rely on acoustic cues to localize the calling male. Intensified male
calling, or the male shifting to another position, in response to a female call might then
prove beneficial in successfully locating a mate. This hypothesis is only speculative at
present, and additional observational and experimental studies will be required to test it.
Several other potential functions have been attributed to female calling behaviour, such as
signalling receptivity (Tobias, Viswanathan & Kelley, 1998; Shen et al., 2008),
distinguishing satellite males from territorial ones (Given, 1993) and inciting male-male
(Judge, Swanson & Brooks, 2000) and female-female competition (Bush, 1997; Bosch,
2002). Few of these hypotheses, however, have been tested experimentally (Wells &
Willaert et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2117
14/21
 Schwartz, 2007). Both positive and negative phonotaxis has been observed in male
Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) in response to two distinct female call types (Wang et al.,
2010). Distinct female call types have also been described for Alytes cisternasii (Ma
´rquez &
Verrell, 1991). Together, the scarce data available on female vocal behaviour and the
variability observed in male responses suggest a complex of multiple, non-exclusive
functions rather than a sole explanation.
Diversity in reproductive behaviours
Our results, combined with other recent behavioural studies (Kunte, 2004; Biju et al., 2011;
Gururaja et al., 2014), show a striking interspecific diversity in reproductive behaviours
within Nyctibatrachus. As the reproduction of many species in this genus has not yet been
studied, the extent of variation is likely to be even greater. Our limited understanding
of this diversity is evidenced by the high number of recent publications reporting new
modes of breeding and associated reproductive behaviours (Zhang et al., 2012; Gururaja
et al., 2014; Iskandar, Evans & McGuire, 2014; Crump, 2015; Seshadri, Gururaja &
Bickford, 2015; Senevirathne et al., 2016). Within Nyctibatrachus, variation in the types of
amplexus is especially remarkable, ranging from a normal axillary amplexus to a complete
lack of physical contact between the sexes (Kunte, 2004; Gururaja et al., 2014). The use of
amplexus is the ancestral state in anuran amphibians and enables juxtaposition of
male and female cloaca to ensure successful fertilization (Duellman & Trueb, 1986: 68–70;
Wells, 2007: 452–458). Secondary loss of amplexus was already shown for a limited
number of anuran taxa (Limerick, 1980; Brown et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012) and a short,
loose contact (head straddle) similar to the dorsal straddle reported here for N. humayuni,
was also found in several Mantidactylus species (Blommers-Schlo
¨sser, 1975; Altig, 2008).
Many males of both Mantidactylus and Nyctibatrachus possess distinct femoral glands
(Fig. S2B) (Vences et al., 2007; Biju et al., 2011). The function of these structures in
Nyctibatrachus has not yet been addressed, but recently it was shown that the femoral
glands of Mantidactylus secrete volatile pheromones (Poth et al., 2012; Ho
¨tling et al., 2014).
Further studies are required to discover and understand the full extent of variation and the
evolutionary advantage of these highly diversified behaviours within Nyctibatrachus,
especially regarding the modification and loss of amplexus.
CONCLUSION
The breeding behaviour of Nyctibatrachus humayuni has several unique elements: a new
type of amplexus, the release of semen before oviposition and the presence of a female call.
These findings further highlight the tremendous variation present in the reproductive
behaviour of anuran amphibians. Nyctibatrachus frogs are one of several unique taxa in
the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is heavily threatened by anthropogenic
activities (Myers et al., 2000; Bossuyt et al., 2004; Van Bocxlaer et al., 2012). A good
understanding of each species’ ecology, including reproduction, is of major importance
for planning and successfully implementing conservation strategies. Additional studies
further exploring the unique and diverse behaviour in Nyctibatrachus frogs are, therefore,
badly needed. Special attention should be paid to describing the amplexus type,

 determining the moment of fertilization and assessing the presence and function of female
calling behaviour.
