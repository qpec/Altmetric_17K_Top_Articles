Summary
Cuffed tracheal tubes are increasingly used in paediatric anaesthetic practice. This study compared tidal volume
and leakage around cuffed and uncuffed tracheal tubes in children who required standardised mechanical ventila-
tion of their lungs in the operating theatre. Children (0–16 years) undergoing elective surgery requiring tracheal
intubation were randomly assigned to receive either a cuffed or an uncuffed tracheal tube. Assessments were made
at five different time-points: during volume-controlled ventilation 6 ml.kg�1, PEEP 5 cmH2O and during pressure-
controlled ventilation 10 cmH2O / PEEP 5 cmH2O. The pressure-controlled ventilation measurement time-points
were: just before a standardised recruitment manoeuvre; just after recruitment manoeuvre; 10 min; and 30 min
after the recruitment manoeuvre. Problems and complications were recorded. During volume-controlled ventilation,
leakage was significantly less with cuffed tracheal tubes than with uncuffed tracheal tubes; in ml.kg�1, median (IQR
[range]) 0.20 (0.13–0.39 [0.04–0.60]) vs. 0.82 (0.58–1.38 [0.24–4.85]), respectively, p < 0.001. With pressure-con-
trolled ventilation, leakage was less with cuffed tracheal tubes and stayed unchanged over a 30-min period, whereas
with uncuffed tracheal tubes, leakage was higher and increased further over the 30-min period. Tidal volumes were
higher in the cuffed group and increased over time, but in the uncuffed group were lower and decreased over time.
Both groups showed an increase in tidal volumes following recruitment manoeuvres. There were more short-term
complications with uncuffed tracheal tubes, but no major complications were recorded in either group at long-term
follow-up. With standardised ventilator settings, cuffed tracheal tubes produced better ventilation characteristics
compared with uncuffed tracheal tubes during general anaesthesia for routine elective surgery.

 Introduction
Children’s tracheas have traditionally been intubated
with uncuffed tracheal tubes (TT) due to differences
between adult and paediatric subglottic anatomy, and
fears that cuffs may lead to mucosal damage and sub-
glottic stenosis. Despite this, cuffed TTs are increasingly
used in paediatric anaesthesia. Over the last 20 years,
evidence suggests that cuffed TT may have advantages
over uncuffed, and are associated with at least similar, if
not superior, airway outcomes when compared with
uncuffed TT in children [1–5]. Some of these studies
were performed in an intensive care setting where intu-
bation and ventilation were carried out for prolonged
periods [3], but were of an observational nature. Others
were randomised studies that looked at children as a
single group in an anaesthetic setting rather than divid-
ing them into specific age groups [4]. The largest and
latest randomised controlled study by Weiss et al. [1]
included sub-group analysis of small infants in an
anaesthetic setting, and demonstrated that cuffed TT
did not have worse outcomes than uncuffed, and were
associated with fewer insertion attempts. Other studies
have referred to clinical, environmental and economic
benefits of cuffed tubes.
This study is the first randomised controlled trial
to compare leakage and tidal volumes in cuffed vs.
uncuffed TT in the operating theatre in children dur-
ing standardised mechanical ventilation.
Methods
This trial was conducted as a single-centre, ran-
domised, parallel-group study at Princess Margaret
Hospital for Children in Perth, Western Australia. It is
the only tertiary referral paediatric centre in Western
Australia,
with
approximately
14,000
anaesthetics
administered every year. Approval for this study was
obtained from the Princess Margaret Hospital for Chil-
dren Ethics Committee and the University of Western
Australia Committee.
Recruitment was carried out between 3 February
2012 and 30 January 2014 through the Department of
Anaesthesia and Pain Management. Written informed
consent was obtained from parents (with assent from
children
whenever
possible)
before
enrolment.
Recruited children were randomly assigned to one of
two groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a cuffed or
uncuffed TT for airway management. No interim anal-
yses for efficacy or futility were performed, and an
independent data monitoring committee was set up.
All children aged 0–16 years weighing more than
> 5 kg and undergoing elective surgery were consid-
ered. Patients with airway malformation, upper airway
surgery, contra-indications to either cuffed or uncuffed
tubes, or requirement for postoperative ventilation,
were not studied.
Subjects were recruited into the trial during anaes-
thetic pre-operative assessment. Following recruitment,
children were randomly assigned by computer-gener-
ated block randomisation to either a ‘cuffed TT’ or
‘uncuffed TT’ group in equal numbers. Withdrawals
from the study were not replaced. Preschool children
(< 6 years) and school children ≥ 6 years) were analy-
sed both separately and together.
All children were anaesthetised in accordance with
the safety standards of the Australian and New Zeal-
and
College
of
Anaesthetists
(ANZCA)
and
the
Department of Anaesthesia and Pain Management,
Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, Aus-
tralia. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia was
performed as deemed appropriate by the attending
anaesthetist (who was independent of the study team)
with either inhalational sevoflurane (up to 8 vol%) or
intravenous (i.v.) propofol (3–5 mg.kg�1). Oral tra-
cheal intubation was performed as per the attending
anaesthetist’s
usual
practice,
with
neuromuscular
blocking drugs optional. Standard institutional TTs
(Table 1) and Draeger Primus anaesthesia workstations
(Dr€
agerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, Luebeck, Germany)
were used. Cuffed TTs < size 5 had low-volume cuffs
(Microcuff, Halyard Health Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA),
and those size 5 and above had high-volume low-pres-
sure cuffs (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland).
Routine anaesthetic monitoring and continuous cuff
manometry (Portex Limited, Hythe, Kent, UK) was
used for cuffed TTs, with cuff pressures monitored
continuously. Following inflation of the TT cuff, pres-
sure was measured, and if necessary adjusted to pres-
sures ≤ 20 cmH2O to allow for a good cuff seal
without hyperinflation.
Initial tube size was based on the type of tube and
age of patient (Table 2). Final tube size was decided by
the attending anaesthetist, and was based on the

 absence of resistance to insertion of the tube and the
presence of audible leak (with inflation pressures of
25 cmH2O following initial cuff deflation). As neces-
sary, TT sizes were adjusted up or down by half a size
to achieve these conditions.
Measurements were carried out under both vol-
ume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-con-
trolled ventilation (PCV). Ventilation was set initially
to VCV of 6 ml.kg�1 and PEEP 5 cmH2O. Five anaes-
thesia workstation measurements of inspiratory and
expiratory tidal volumes were recorded, and the mean
taken for analysis of leakage around the TT. Ventila-
tion was then adjusted to PCV of 10 cmH2O, PEEP of
5 cmH2O and leakage around the tube analysed again
in the same way.
Following
these
measurements,
a
standardised
recruitment manoeuvre was performed by giving 10
slow manual breaths up to 35 cmH2O, followed by
PEEP of 5 cmH2O [6]. Following the recruitment
manoeuvre,
repeat
measurements
were
recorded
immediately, then again at 10 min and 20 min. Once
these measurements were taken, ventilation was at the
discretion of the anaesthetist for the remainder of the
case.
Respiratory rate and inspiratory times were stan-
dardised according to age (Table 3). In both groups,
the TT was removed at the discretion of the attending
anaesthetist, and timing of extubation recorded.
All patients were transported in the lateral position
to the recovery unit after ensuring that their airway,
air exchange and oxygenation were adequate. Oxygen
saturation was measured continuously until discharge
from the recovery unit.
Oxygen saturation was recorded when the subjects
were calm and the pulse oximeter showed consistent
detection. Lowest measured SpO2 values were recorded
10 min before removal of the TT, and at 1 min,
2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min,
25 min and 30 min after removal.
Any
respiratory
adverse
events
(laryngospasm;
bronchospasm; desaturation < 95%; airway obstruction;
severe coughing and/or postoperative stridor) as well as
subsequent
interventions
were
recorded.
We
also
recorded risk factors for peri-operative respiratory
adverse events [7], together with baseline characteristics.
All families were interviewed on the ward pre-discharge
regarding the presence or absence of sore throat (if
patient > 3 years) or other respiratory adverse events.
In line with institutional ethics regulations, we moni-
tored patients for 3 years following the last patient
recruitment to identify if any participants required sub-
sequent airway intervention.
The primary end-point for the study was leakage
around the TT, defined as the difference between
inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes (as measured
by the anaesthesia workstation) at five different time-
points before the start of surgery. Secondary end-
points were: inspiratory tidal volume; expiratory tidal
volume; number of attempts to insert and correctly
size the tracheal tube; adverse events; sore throat in
children old enough to report (3 years and above) and
hoarse voice.

 In pilot studies on children at our institution, we
observed differences in mean TT-leak between cuffed
TT (0.5 ml.kg�1) and uncuffed TT (0.65 ml.kg�1).
Based on our data and assuming a common standard
deviation of 0.23, a sample size of 52 children per group
would provide 90% power to detect a difference in leak-
age of 0.15 ml.kg�1 between study groups. We analysed
leakage between the two groups using Mann–Whitney’s
test and a significance level of 0.05.
For the secondary end-points, unadjusted analysis
was performed with binary logistic regression.
Results
One-hundred
and
four
children
between
0
and
16 years of age were recruited (Fig. 1, Table 4).
Fifty-two patients were aged < 6 years and 52
patients aged 6–16 years. Twenty-six patients in each
age group were included in the ‘cuffed TT group’ and
26 in the ‘uncuffed TT group’. In the uncuffed group,
data from six (< 6 years) and 12 (6–12 years) subjects
could not be collected due to tube-related problems
(e.g. leak too large). Long-term follow-up data ranged
from 3 to 5 years after surgery. Table 4 depicts the
baseline characteristics for subjects in both cuffed and
uncuffed TT groups. In the uncuffed group, one child
who was under the weight limit of 5 kg (3.8 kg) was
recruited
by
mistake,
but
the
child’s
data
were
included in the analysis. Table 4 includes the usage of
neuromuscular blockade in all groups.
Tables 5, 6 and 7 show leakage (inspired – expired
tidal volume) at the time-point, < 6 and 6–16 years
groups, respectively.
Table 8 shows the number of attempts and prob-
lems encountered at intubation. In the cuffed TT
group, about 80% were successfully intubated with a
correctly-sized TT at first attempt compared with only
about 30% in the uncuffed group. There were fewer
corrective interventions in the cuffed group. Tube size
required changing in around 10% in the cuffed group
and 30% in the uncuffed group. A change in tube type

Anaesthesia 2018, 73, 160–168 Chambers et al. | Leakage and tidal volume in cuffed vs. uncuffed tracheal tubes in children
 was only required in the uncuffed group (i.e. changed
to cuffed).
The incidence of some complications was low,
making meaningful analysis difficult, but overall there
were fewer in the cuffed group (Tables 8 and 9).
Discussion
Our study compared specific clinical end-points in
cuffed TT vs. uncuffed TT groups during two alterna-
tive ventilation strategies. Cuffed TTs provided not

 mechanics, but also had lower requirements for correc-
tive measures at intubation and a lower rate of adverse
events in children whose tracheas were intubated for
elective surgery, as compared with uncuffed TTs.
The leak measurements in this study consisted of
both inspiratory and expiratory components, but did
not distinguish between the two, assuming the major-
ity of the leak to be inspiratory because of the higher
intra-tracheal pressure. The leak around the TT was
significantly lower in the cuffed TT group at every sin-
gle assessment point. During PCV, the leak remained
relatively unchanged in the cuffed TT group over the
four measurement points, but in the uncuffed TT
group the leak decreased slightly after the recruitment
manoeuvre, then increased significantly over time in
both
age
groups.
This
suggests
that
recruitment
manoeuvres may be required less often in children
with cuffed TTs.
All tidal volume measurements were higher in the
cuffed TT group at every assessment point, with the
difference increasing at the later points. Inspired tidal
volume measurements reflect both leak and expired
tidal volume components, and thus expired tidal vol-
umes more accurately reflect actual tidal volume,
notwithstanding the possibility of an unmeasured expi-
ratory leak. Expired tidal volume initially increased
after the recruitment manoeuvre in both TT groups
and both age groups, demonstrating the positive effects
of recruitment on tidal volume as expected. Expired
tidal volume increased over time in the cuffed group,

Anaesthesia 2018, 73, 160–168 Chambers et al. | Leakage and tidal volume in cuffed vs. uncuffed tracheal tubes in children
 but decreased in the uncuffed TT group. These find-
ings suggest that there is superior maintenance of lung
volume in the cuffed TT group and reduction of lung
volume in the uncuffed TT group, with likely associ-
ated changes in lung compliance, functional residual
capacity (FRC) and ventilation.
Additionally, and in line with previous findings [1,
2], cuffed TTs were associated with greater ease of
insertion, lower leak/tidal volume ratio, fewer post-
operative complaints and fewer adverse events. The
decreased incidence of sore throat and hoarse voice in
the cuffed TT group may reflect decreased requirement
for repeated airway instrumentation.
Subanalysis of the effect of neuromuscular block-
ade on leakage was not possible, due to the low num-
bers
involved
(and
therefore
insufficient
power).
However, usage of neuromuscular blockade was similar
between tube type and age groups, and an exploratory
analysis (data not presented) did not suggest any
impact of neuromuscular blockade on the results stud-
ied.
Advantages of the use of cuffed TT are reported as
being a reduced need for multiple intubation attempts
to correctly size a tube [1]; lower atmospheric pollu-
tion [6, 8] due to lack of a leak; more reliable capnog-
raphy [1]; lower risk of micro-aspiration [9]; decreased
sore throat [2]; lower risk of airway fires during
oropharyngeal procedures [10]; and economic benefits
of lower gas and anaesthetic use [11, 12]. In a retro-
spective study, Mahmoud demonstrated that tracheal
tube leak of > 5% tidal volume was present in 75% of
infants ventilated in neonatal intensive care with
uncuffed TTs, and the leak was up to 40% tidal vol-
ume in > 40% of infants [13]. These findings are con-
sistent with the results of our study, which showed a
leak/tidal ratio of 32% in the < 6 years and 39% in 6–
16 years groups. Fine et al. showed similar results
(31% leak/tidal volume ratio) in infants whose lungs
were ventilated [11]. Main et al. suggested in their
study [14] that a tube leak of > 20% is associated with
an inconsistent tidal volume, and overestimation of
lung compliance and resistance which can lead to
impaired ventilation. Consequences of suboptimal lung
monitoring may include avoidable atelectasis, loss of
volume or unnecessary shearing forces, thus increasing
the risk of ventilator-induced lung damage. Without
accurate
tidal
volume
monitoring,
lung
protective
strategies become difficult. It is suggested that a cycli-
cal process of recruitment and atelectasis may con-
tribute to lung inflammation [15]. However, evidence
is lacking about whether there are advantages from
ventilation with cuffed TT in children due to leak min-
imisation.
There is a financial cost associated with cuffed
TTs,
which
are
generally
more
expensive
than
uncuffed tubes, but this is offset by a lower incidence
of tube changes (i.e. cost of tubes and the time
required for tube change) and lower fresh gas use [12].
Our study has some limitations. These include the
use of four different types of available cuffed TT.
There are numerous manufacturers of TTs, each hav-
ing a different outer diameter and cuff qualities, but
our results only reflect the four cuffed TT types in use
at our institution. The ultimate choice of TT size was
made by the attending anaesthetist, which introduced
another element of variability. Also, there was no stan-
dardisation of the anaesthetic drugs used, but all were
administered according to routine practice in our insti-
tution. The use of neuromuscular blockade was incon-
sistent,
and
could
potentially
be
a
confounding
variable affecting both leak and tidal volume. Different
ventilation modes or settings may have changed our
results. There may also have been some error in the
calculations of tidal volumes and tube leak by the
Dr€
ager Primus Anaesthesia Machine, but this would
have affected both groups equally. Finally, we did not
distinguish between leak during inspiration and expira-
tion, and assumed that most of the leak occurred dur-
ing inspiration because of larger pressure gradients.
Expired tidal volume might not therefore be an accu-
rate indicator of changes in lung volume because expi-
ratory leak has not been measured or taken into
account. Any expired leak could thus be associated
with an overestimate of lung volume loss.
Trials examining various pressures in supraglottic
airway devices have demonstrated that lower cuff pres-
sures produce a lower incidence of sore throat [16].
To date, there are no prospective randomised trials
that compare the rate of sore throat with cuffed and
uncuffed TT, but an audit at our own institution [2]
showed a higher incidence of sore throat in children
receiving an uncuffed TT, and the incidence of sore

 throat in those with cuffed TT positively correlated
with cuff pressure.
Under standardised ventilation settings, cuffed TTs
were associated with lower leak, higher tidal volumes and
more stable ventilation parameters. Additionally, children
intubated with cuffed TT showed less adverse events, sore
throat and hoarse voice. The results of this randomised
controlled trial add to the growing body of evidence that
cuffed TTs may be associated with superior outcomes
when compared with uncuffed TTs in children.
