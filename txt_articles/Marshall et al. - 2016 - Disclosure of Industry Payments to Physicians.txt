Abstract
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Open Payments program implements Section 
6002 of the Affordable Care Act requiring medical product manufacturers to report payments 
made to physicians or teaching hospitals, as well as ownership or investment interests held by 
physicians in the manufacturer. To determine the characteristics and distribution of these industry 
payments by specialty, we analyzed physician payments made between August 1, 2013 and 
December 31, 2013 that were publicly disclosed by Open Payments. We compared payments 
between specialty type (grouped as medical, surgical, and other specialties) and across specialties 
within each type, using Pearson's chi square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The number of 
physicians receiving payments was compared to the total number of active physicians in each 
specialty in 2012. We also analyzed physician ownership interests. There were 2.7 million 
identified payments to recipient physicians totaling $527 million. Allopathic and osteopathic 
physicians received 2.43 million payments totaling $475 million. General payments represented 
90% ($430 million) of payments by total value (per-physician median:$100, IQR:$31-$273, mean:
$1,407, SD:$23,766) with the remaining 10% ($45 million) as research payments (median:$2,365, 
IQR:$592-$8,550; mean:$12,880, SD:$66,743). Physicians most likely to receive general 
payments were cardiovascular specialists (78%) and neurosurgeons (77%); those least likely were 
pathologists (9%). Reports of ownership interest in reporting entities included $310 million in 
dollar amount invested and $447 million in value of interest held by 2,093 physicians. In 
conclusion, the distribution and characteristics of industry payments to physicians varied widely 
by specialty during the first half-year of Open Payments reporting.

 The recently debuted Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Open Payments 
transparency program establishes a national database of industry payments to physicians and 
teaching hospitals1. Financial relationships between medical product manufacturers and 
physicians have long been a source of concern to patients and policymakers alike. These 
concerns have grown in recent years as research continues to show the ways in which these 
widely prevalent relationships2 may affect treatment decisions and may drive healthcare 
costs due to inappropriate utilization3,4. In their report calling for broad transparency of 
industry-physician relationships, the Institute of Medicine “defines a conflict of interest as 
existing when an individual or institution has a secondary interest (…) that creates a risk of 
undue influence on decisions or actions affecting a primary interest (e.g., the conduct of 
objective and trustworthy medical research). This definition frames a conflict of interest in 
terms of the risk of such undue influence and not the actual occurrence of bias3.” In many 
cases, industry-physician financial relationships, from transfers of value as small as a meal 
or gift to those for royalties and licensing fees, create a conflict of interest3,4,5.
As a result of concerns about these financial conflicts of interest, several legislative efforts 
have been made over the years to increase transparency with respect to industry-physician 
relationships. Prior to Open Payments implementation, several states enacted laws requiring 
various levels of disclosure of industry payments to physicians6, including full transparency, 
disclosure to the state, compliance with professional guidelines7, and limits on gifts. 
However, only 8 states had such laws prior to Open Payments implementation6. In addition 
to these laws, several pharmaceutical and device manufacturers publicly disclosed 
payments, though with varying detail8. Kesselheim et al., in their evaluation of 
Massachusetts physician payment transparency data, found wide variation among 
specialties9. They speculated that there may be differences in industry incentive to engage in 
such relationships or that specialties may have differences in the acceptance of these 
relationships.
Federal policymakers have attempted to increase transparency of industry-physician 
financial relationships, though attempts between 2002 and 2009 failed to gain enough 
support for the bills to pass10-12. Finally, in 2010, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act was 
signed into law as Section 6002 of President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act13, leading to the establishment of the Open Payments program. The stated goal of 
the Sunshine Act and Open Payments is to “shed light on the nature and extent of [industry-
physician] relationships and […] hopefully discourage the development of inappropriate 
relationships and help prevent the increased and potentially unnecessary health care costs 
that can arise from such conflicts13.” The Open Payments data release was updated in 
December 2014 and includes 4.5 million records of $3.7 billion in total value for payments 
occurring between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. These data, despite representing 
only five months of 2013, are the most comprehensive to date describing physician-industry 
relationships in the United States. Physician payments reported to Open Payments include 
payments of greater than $10 or $100 in aggregate annually (adjusted based on the consumer 
price index) with notable exceptions that include product samples, discounts, charity care, 
and patient educational materials1.

 Much of the existing literature on the Open Payments program is speculative, published 
prior to the availability of the data, but provide important insight into the possible uses and 
impact of the data. For example, Rosenthal and Mello14 speculated on the use of Open 
Payments data by attorneys, insurance carriers, researchers, policymakers, and patients14. 
The debate on the influence of conflicts of interest on physician decision-making is 
ongoing14-16, with researchers acknowledging that there is little evidence to answer such 
questions. Analysis of these newly available data may bring better understanding of the 
differences and commonalities between specialties in their relationships with industry. Such 
knowledge may help to determine how to assess the appropriateness of these relationships 
and their effects on clinical practice, as well as help inform evidence-based advocacy efforts 
as ongoing federal transparency efforts shift the landscape of disclosure for physicians.
The purpose of our study was to characterize Open Payments program records of industry 
payments to physicians and determine how these payments vary by specialty. We 
hypothesized that there would be differences in the characteristics and distribution of 
payments by physician specialty.
Methods
The Open Payments database allows for physician-level industry payment calculations and 
aggregation for analysis of broader characteristics by specialty. We performed a 
retrospective analysis of the most recent (December 2014) publicly available release of 
Open Payments data on industry payments (>$10 or $100 in aggregate annually) to 
identified physicians made between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. CMS excludes 
resident and manufacturer employee physicians. The data released also include payments to 
teaching hospitals, but these are beyond the scope of this article. Payments to recipient 
physicians were available in both identified and de-identified databases. Identified physician 
payments included records of payments or other transfer of value (‘physician payments’) to 
a specific physician and included physician specialty designation. ‘Recipient physicians’ 
include both allopathic and osteopathic specialties as well as other practitioners designated 
as physicians by CMS. We further limited our analysis to allopathic and osteopathic 
physician specialties that could be matched with the AMA masterfile count of active 
physicians17. Data were aggregated by physician specialty type (medical, surgical, and 
other) and by specialty:
•
medical specialties: allergy & immunology, dermatology, family medicine & 
general practice, cardiovascular disease, gastroenterology, internal medicine, 
pediatrics, and pediatric cardiology;
•
surgical specialties: colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics & gynecology, 
ophthalmology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, 
plastic surgery, surgery (general), thoracic surgery, and urology; and,
•
other specialties: anesthesiology, emergency medicine, neurology, pathology, 
psychiatry, radiology, and other.

 A listing of the specialty groupings is provided to delineate specialty taxonomy used for this 
analysis (see eTable 1). Records include information on reporting manufacturers, physicians, 
payments, associated drug or device, and ownership interests.
We characterized payments by ‘type’ (general or research). General payments include all 
forms of payment other than for research activities, which are classified under research 
payments (defined below). General payments were also characterized by ‘form’ of payment 
or the modality used to transfer payment, including: cash or cash equivalent (‘cash’); in-kind 
items and services (‘in-kind’); dividend, profit or other return on investment (‘ROI’); or 
stock, stock option or other ownership interest (‘ownership interest’). General payments are 
further classified by ‘nature’ of payment or the reason the general payment was made. CMS 
provides descriptive titles for each nature of payment classification and has examples of 
payment types that were developed with stakeholder input available on their website 
(available at: https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/About/Natures-of-Payment.html, 
accessed June 15, 2015). We have provided an adapted version of the CMS descriptions in 
eTable 2.
Research payments include any direct compensation, funding for coordination or 
implementation, or study participant expense payment associated with research activities1. 
Research is defined in the regulations as “a systematic investigation designed to develop or 
contribute to generalizable knowledge relating broadly to public health, including behavioral 
and social-sciences research. This term encompasses basic and applied research and product 
development1.” Research-related payments are reported separately from general payments 
due to the complexity of research programs1. In addition, certain research payments qualify 
for delayed publication if they are related to new, additional applications of, or clinical 
investigations regarding a drug, biologic, device or medical supply1. Research payments are 
not required to report an expenditure category (similar to nature of payment for general 
payments) because there are often multiple, although the option to report such a category is 
available. 91% of research payment records did not specify an expenditure category; 
therefore we did not further explore this classification. We present summarized aggregate 
data, data by specialty type, and data by physician specialty (organized by specialty type). 
Payment characteristics analyzed included number of payment reports, value of payments, 
and the per-physician median and mean payment amount.
Lastly, we characterized physician and immediate family member ownership interests in 
manufacturers. ‘Ownership interests’ include any ownership or investment interests of 
physicians or immediate family members in a reporting entity (applicable manufacturer or 
group purchasing organization) required to report payments1. Ownership interest include 
stocks, stock options, partnership shares, limited liability company membership(s), loans, 
bond or other financial instruments secured by the reporting entity; notable exclusions 
include ownership interest received as compensation (until exercised), as part of a retirement 
plan, or interest in a publicly traded security or mutual fund1. Unless listed under general 
payments, ownership interests must be held within the defined reporting period but are not 
necessarily transferred. To characterize ownership and investment interest data, we utilized 
CMS terms “amount invested” and “value of interest” to delineate the original amount of the 
interest holding or transfer of value and the “cumulative value” of that ownership interest in

 the reporting entity at the end of the reporting period, respectively18. Ownership interest 
characteristics analyzed included number of ownership interests held, and the total and per-
physician median dollar amount invested and value of interest.
We analyzed how payment and ownership interest characteristics vary between specialty 
types and across physician specialties within each type using Pearson Chi-square test and the 
Kruskal-Wallis test where applicable. We compared the number of physicians receiving 
payments to the total number of active physicians in each specialty in 201217 to estimate the 
proportion of physicians receiving payment and holding ownership interest.
Results
From August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, there were 4.4 million payments totaling $2.6 
billion reported to Open Payments with 2.7 million of these payments ($869 million) 
disclosed in an identified manner. General payments represented 4.2 million ($1.0 billion) of 
all payments, and 2.7 million ($693 million) of the identified payments. Recipient 
physicians received 4.2 million ($761 million) of all general payments, and identified 
recipient physicians received 2.6 million payments totaling $476 million. The nature of all 
general payments to recipient physicians and the subset of identified payments are presented 
in Table 1. Nature of identified general payments to recipient physicians by total value was 
primarily compensation for services [$113 million (24%)], royalty/license [$107 million 
(22%)], and consulting fees [$94 million (20%)]; by number of records, they were primarily 
food/beverage [2.2 million (84%)].
Allopathic and osteopathic physicians received 2.4 million payments totaling $475 million 
(Table 2). Figure 1 shows the distribution of payments among allopathic and osteopathic 
specialties. Internal medicine and orthopedic surgery had the greatest total value ($111 
million each), Figure 1a; however, payments were distributed to a greater number of internal 
medicine physicians vs. orthopedic surgeons (77,515 vs. 15,459, respectively). Medical 
specialties that received the greatest number of payments were cardiovascular disease and 
gastroenterology (78% and 68%, respectively). The proportion of physicians receiving 
payment was significantly different between specialty types and by specialty within each 
type (P < .001 for all tests). Form of payments (Figure 1) was primarily cash [$367 million 
(77%) by value, 469,557 (19%) by number] or in-kind [$103 million (22%) by value, 2.0 
million (81%) by number], with the remaining payments as ROI [$421,769 (0.1%) by value, 
48 (<0.1%) by number) and ownership interest [$4.8 million (1%) by value, 66 (<0.1%) by 
number].
General payments represented $430 million (90%) of the total value of payments to 
allopathic and osteopathic physicians (per-physician median:$100, IQR:$31-$273, mean:
$1,407, SD: $23,766) and 2.4 million (99%) of the number of records. The remaining $45 
million (10%) of the total value were research payments (median:$2,365, IQR:$592-$8,550; 
mean:$12,880,SD:$66,743). Thoracic surgery, cardiovascular disease, and urology had the 
highest median general payments; and, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and neurology had 
the highest mean value of general payments per-physician (Figure 1b). The value of general 
payments was significantly different between specialty types and by specialty within each

 type (P < .001 for all tests). The distribution of the nature of payments by specialty type can 
be found in Figure 2a, Figure 2b, and eTable 3. Surgical specialties had the greatest 
proportion of general payments for royalty/license [$89 million (47%) in value, 2,431 (<1%) 
by number]. Royalty/license payments to surgical specialties encompassed 89% of the $100 
million total royalty/license payments made for all specialty types. The proportion of general 
payments in each nature of payment category differed significantly between specialty types 
and by specialty within each type (P < .001 for all tests).
Manufacturers also disclosed 3,296 reports of 2,093 individual physicians (0.3% of all 
physicians) with ownership interest (Table 3) totaling $310 million in total dollar amount 
invested (median:$12,520, IQR:$3,114-$50,050) and $447 million in total value of interest 
(median:$15,640, IQR:$4,747-$72,880). We found significant differences in the total dollar 
amount invested between specialty types and by specialty within each type (Kruskal-Wallis 
test, P < .001 between specialty types, and by specialty within medical and surgical 
specialties; P =.001 by specialty within other specialties). We also found that total value of 
interest between specialty types and by specialty within each type were significantly 
different for each comparison (P < .001 between specialty types, and by specialty within 
medical and surgical specialties), except for by specialty within other specialties (P = .11). 
Specialties most likely to have ownership interests were urology [583 of 10,773 (5%)], 
neurosurgery [117 of 6,041 (2%)], and orthopedic surgery [385 of 25,670 (2%)]. All other 
specialties had <1% of physicians with ownership interest. We found significant differences 
in the proportion of physicians with ownership interest by specialty type and by specialty 
within each specialty type (P < .001 for all tests).
Discussion
Our analysis of this unprecedented volume of physician-specific data on industry-related 
financial conflicts of interest shows wide variability in the prevalence and characteristics of 
industry payments to physicians by specialty. While important analyses of Open Payments 
manufacturer and product data exist19,20, little attention has been paid to characteristics of 
physician data. A report by Jarvies et al.20 gave an initial account of the first release of Open 
Payments data in September 2014, focusing largely on manufacturer and product data. 
However, the data provided regarding physician specialties were limited to 5 specialties and 
provided aggregates that included ownership and investment interests in the totals, despite 
the difference in reporting of these records. Useful aggregation and analyses of Open 
Payments manufacturer and product data are also available from ProPublica19 and from 
CMS in their recent report to Congress21, although little attention has been paid to 
characteristics of physician data. Prior to the enactment of Open Payments, ProPublica also 
assembled a separate important database of industry-physician financial relatinships22 
containing $4 billion in payments disclosed by 17 pharmaceutical companies between 2009 
and 2013. In comparison to the 4 year period evaluated by ProPublica, the Open Payments 
data presented herein reports on a 5 month period that contains data on nearly the same total 
value of payments ($3.7 billion in total).
Our findings are also important because the specialty variation in our analysis demonstrates 
that further interpretation of the impact of industry payments on physician decision-making,

 healthcare costs and utilization must incorporate the specialty-specific context of these data. 
We found significant differences in the distribution and median values of payments by 
specialty type as well as by specialty within each type. We found that general medical 
specialties (internal medicine and family medicine/general practice,) were the target of a 
large proportion of industry payments (1.2 million (50%) of 2.4 million total) though the 
value of these payments tended to be lower than other specialties [$133 million (28%) of 
$475 million paid to allopathic and osteopathic specialties in our analysis]. In addition, the 
medical specialties that involve a greater amount of intervention (cardiovascular disease, 
gastroenterology and dermatology) had the highest proportion of physicians receiving 
industry payments. Our data are consistent with prior evidence showing wide variation 
among specialties in an early evaluation of Massachusetts physician payment transparency 
data9 as well as in physician self-reports2,23. These evaluations also found a high prevalence 
of payments with specialty variability, as well as high values of payments attributed to 
cardiology and orthopedic surgery. In addition, our data differ from the Massachusetts data 
in the nature of payments by providing additional detail to the distribution of payments, 
where a large proportion of Massachusetts payments fell under the broad category of 
“compensation for bona fide services9.” Other analyses of Open Payments data also found 
similar variation amongst a limited number of surgical specialties24-26, although a 
comprehensive analysis of medical and other specialties is absent. Certain specialties may 
have greater research and development involvement resulting in royalty and licensing 
payments27. Comparisons between surgical, medical and other specialties in our findings 
show distinct payment distributions and characteristics in each specialty type, with greater 
royalty and licensing payments in surgical specialties compared to medical and other 
specialties. In addition, our findings are consistent with an analysis showing the broad extent 
of financial interaction between orthopedic surgery and industry26, a field with long-
standing financial relationships28 and a history of recent problematic relationships with 
device manufacturers influencing the dissemination of research results29,27.
Whether transparency will impede valuable collaborations and the pace of innovation also 
requires ongoing evaluation, as does further investigation into the appropriateness of these 
financial relationships. For example, the influence of payments of greater value (orthopedic 
surgery received 80,951 (3%) of payments by number and $111 million (23%) of $475 
million by value) cannot necessarily be interpreted under the same criteria as payments to 
other specialties. However, implications of these payments are complex; and, the prevalence 
and magnitude of payments seen in these data increase the need for further research into the 
effect of these payments, both beneficial and problematic. Research has shown that 
physician payment laws may deter physician-industry relationships that create conflicts of 
interest6,15. Physicians may be less likely to accept industry payments15, and manufacturers 
may be less likely to pay physicians and shift these expenditures towards direct-to-consumer 
advertising and towards payers30. But there is also some debate as to whether an unintended 
consequence of transparency of physician payments may result in allowing such payments 
to be more rather than less influential because they have been disclosed31 due to discounting 
by informed patients or a feeling of moral license after having disclosed such a relationship. 
Moreover, others16 have found that the effects of transparency are small in deterring 
utilization of higher priced drugs, for example. Many have expressed concern with the

 limitations of the Open Payments program, citing the inaccuracies of the database32, the 
short review period33, and the value assigned to research payments due to the high price of 
drugs34. Additionally, others are concerned that payment transparency, if not properly 
contextualized, will deter physicians from entering even those relationships that are 
beneficial, out of concern that such payments will be misconstrued as problematic32.
Our study adds to the current literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of Open 
Payments physician-level data with specialty-specific analyses to evaluate differences in the 
distribution and characteristics of payments. Now that Open Payments data are publicly 
available, despite criticisms of the data released thus far35, physicians must understand what 
is being reported, how to engage efficiently and effectively with Open Payments, and how to 
manage questions from patients and other interested parties. Manufacturers are not required 
to inform physicians that certain payments must be reported, nor is physician participation in 
the program required; thus, educating physicians on transparency data is critical to physician 
awareness. CMS estimates that 50% of physicians will have a reported financial relationship 
with industry1. We estimate that 40% (324,523) of all allopathic and osteopathic physicians 
(813,123) received identified payments, nearly meeting CMS estimates, though we expect 
that the actual proportion is greater. The remaining 1.7 million de-identified records may 
include up to 546,000 total physicians (68% of physicians by our estimates), but the actual 
number is unclear due to provider identifier inconsistencies1. CMS also excluded 190,000 
records due to delay in publication requests. In addition, manufacturers must now report 
payments for accredited CME activities made in 2016 and beyond. Moreover, if payers 
incorporate Open Payments data into certain quality and utilization measures used for 
reimbursement14, more physicians are likely to review their reports. Acknowledging the 
potential for an increase in physicians engaging with Open Payments will ensure that the 
proper support and resources are available.
While CMS suggests that Open Payments data be combined with quality and utilization data 
to improve understanding of these relationships1, no unique physician identifier is publicly 
available to facilitate comparison to other quality and utilization, research publication, or 
funding databases to facilitate effective analysis. Industry reporting of payments must 
include a National Provider Identifier (NPI), however the law itself prohibits publication of 
NPIs with Open Payments data. CMS implemented a search tool to help identify payments 
by physician or manufacturer name, but does not enable broader aggregation and analysis. 
However, searching for payments to an individual physician still provides organizations the 
opportunity to verify conflicts of interest and make more informed decisions on physician 
participation in influential decision making and developing guidelines. There is also ongoing 
debate into whether or not some payments deserve exclusion36, with recent federal efforts to 
allow payments related to accredited CME activities to be excluded from reporting 
requirements based on the recent changes made by CMS discussed above for the 2016 
reporting year.
The extent to which patients' knowledge of industry-physician relationships will impact their 
decision making is unclear3. Research into the opinion of patients regarding industry-
physician financial conflicts of interest has shown that patients in clinical trials largely 
(90%) expressed little to no concern about the financial ties, although many wanted

 disclosure of these interests (31%)37. In addition, a survey or orthopedic surgery patients 
found that they largely viewed financial relationships for surgeons acting as consultants for 
device manufacturers as beneficial38. Nevertheless, proper contextualization of payments is 
an ongoing concern for physicians and specialty societies, given the potential for 
misinterpretation by patients or the media, and the potential for use in liability claims. 
Industry collaborations in research are increasingly important as a result of stagnating 
government-funded support28,29,39. In a commentary on the potential unintended effects of 
Open Payments on oncology care, one author suggests that given the assignment of industry 
publication expenses being attributed to a physician, that important research findings may be 
delayed and that researchers may be reluctant to engage in industry-supported research40. 
Our data establish important elements of payment context that may help to mitigate such 
reluctance, and ongoing assessment of the appropriateness of industry-physician 
relationships may help ensure that disclosure does not adversely affect beneficial 
relationships that are becoming more common, and will deter those that are inappropriate. 
Furthermore, such payments for publication expenses, if reported correctly, would be 
included in a research payment if subject to an agreement, contract or research protocol, and 
the separate reporting of research payments should mitigate certain concerns, especially as 
the program and reporting entity experience with the Open Payment system matures and 
physicians become more involved.
Our study has limitations. First, our study is limited by restricting our analysis to identified 
physician payments–payments linked to a physician with total confidence–excluding 1.7 
million records. Accordingly, we likely underestimated the proportion of physicians 
receiving industry payments and as such, the generalizability of our data is limited. Also, we 
were unable to assess specialty-level systematic differences in the excluded data. However, 
the distribution of de-identified general payments by nature was similar to identified 
payments (Table 1), and we do not expect that errors leading to provider identification 
introduce large systematic bias, though it cannot be ruled out. Ongoing analyses of 
upcoming data releases will be an important step in verifying our findings and analyzing 
how they change over time. CMS also excluded 190,000 records due to delay in publication 
requests, many of which may have been for proprietary drugs or devices. Accordingly, 
incidence of physician payments may be underestimated and we could not account for 
potential systematic differences in excluded records or inaccuracies inherent to the database. 
CMS does not publish NPIs in the public use dataset, therefore incorporation of 
demographic and other data of interest is limited.
The Open Payments data and our analyses, while important, demonstrate the need to test the 
effects of financial conflicts of interest on physician behavior and those of transparency 
itself in prospective interventional studies. In addition, the variability of our data between 
specialties demonstrate a potential need for specialty-specific advocacy as federal 
transparency programs and their broad availability evolve.
Conclusion
Our analysis provides important insights into the specialty differences in industry-related 
conflicts of interest as the nation's physician workforce enters an era of transparency for

advocacy efforts by specialty organizations and guide further research efforts to measure the 
effect of transparency on physician and patient decision-making and how industry-physician 
relationships change over time.
