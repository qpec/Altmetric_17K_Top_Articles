Bactericidal levels of antibiotics are difficult to achieve in infected total joint arthroplasty 
when intravenous antibiotics or antibiotic-loaded cement spacers are used, but intra-
articular (IA) delivery of antibiotics has been effective in several studies. This paper 
describes a protocol for IA delivery of antibiotics in infected knee arthroplasty, and 
summarises the results of a pharmacokinetic study and two clinical follow-up studies of 
especially difficult groups: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and failed two-stage 
revision. In the pharmacokinetic study, the mean synovial vancomycin peak level was 9242 
(3956 to 32 150; SD 7608 μg/mL) among the 11 patients studied. Serum trough level ranged 
from 4.2 to 25.2 μg/mL (mean, 12.3 μg/mL; average of 9.6% of the joint trough value), which 
exceeded minimal inhibitory concentration. The success rate exceeded 95% in the two 
clinical groups. IA delivery of antibiotics is shown to be safe and effective, and is now the 
first option for treatment of infected total joint arthroplasty in our institution.

Revision for infected total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) is usually performed in two stages. At the
first stage, infected implants are removed and
antibiotic therapy is initiated (usually via a com-
bination of systemic antibiotics and an antibiotic-
loaded spacer made from polymethyl meth-
acrylate (PMMA) bone cement), and the revision
components are implanted between six and
12 weeks later.1-5 In order to treat bacterial infec-
tions within joints effectively, it is essential that
high intra-articular (IA) concentrations of antibi-
otics are achieved. While antibiotics in cement
spacers can produce high IA concentrations of
antibiotics initially, the levels decrease rapidly
during the first three days as the antibiotics leach
from the surface layer of the cement spacer.4,6,7
Intravenous (IV) administration of antibiotics
also achieves IA concentrations in excess of the
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for sus-
ceptible organisms, but the levels achieved are
modest and the duration of time above the MIC
is short.8,9 As a result, even in patients with an
infected TKA which has been treated with IV
antibiotics, causative organisms can still be iso-
lated from intra-operative tissue biopsies.10 The
effectiveness of glycopeptide antibiotics is pro-
portional to both the concentration and the
length of time the concentration is maintained at
an effective level.11-14 This remains the case
whether the antibiotic is used as a prophylactic
agent in clean cases, or to eradicate bacteria in
infected cases. 
Following two-stage revision, re-infection is
common, particularly in cases involving resist-
ant bacteria, where re-infection rates between
24% and 82% have been reported.15-18 The
surgical management of re-infection after two-
stage revision for infection is especially chal-
lenging with a high rate of complications
including repeated re-infection,19-21 loosening,
and chronic pain.
In an effort to achieve sustained high con-
centrations of antibiotics in the synovial fluid
of an infected joint, we have developed a
method to inject antibiotics directly into the
knee joint, using Hickman catheters implanted
into the joint cavity at the time of surgical
treatment for infection, and leaving an external
portal for injection.22,23 Administration of
antibiotics directly into the joint can achieve IA
concentrations between two and three orders
of magnitude higher than that achieved by IV
administration.9 Similar methods of direct IA
antibiotic delivery have been used effectively
for treatment of pyarthrosis in veterinary prac-
tice for decades,8,24-26 and have been used suc-
cessfully in humans to salvage acutely and
chronically infected TKA.22,23,27-30 Given that
knee joint infection may affect structures out-
side the joint capsule (including adjacent tis-
sues or regional lymph nodes), it is important
that IA delivery of antibiotics also generates a
therapeutic concentration within the serum.
This appears to be the case: previous studies

have reported mean serum peak (4.1 μg/mL to 6.1 μg/mL)
and trough (3.2 μg/mL to 3.3 μg/mL) values within the
therapeutic range.22,23
This paper describes a technique developed to treat
infected TKA using single-stage exchange arthroplasty
using cementless implants and IA infusion of antibiotics.
Three cohorts of patients are described: firstly, the tech-
nique was evaluated in a study of basic pharmacokinetics in
a group of patients to determine antibiotic concentration in
the joint and serum. The protocol also was then applied to
a group of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococ-
cus aureus (MRSA) and a group of patients with re-
infection after failed two-stage revision for infected TKA.
Patients and Methods
Pharmacokinetic study.31 Following institutional review
board approval, we enrolled 11 patients (11 knees) referred
for treatment of infected TKA into a study with the aim of
evaluating IA and serum concentrations of vancomycin in
response to IA injection. Two Hickman catheters (Bard
Access Systems, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah) (Fig. 1) were
inserted into the IA space intra-operatively at the time of
revision surgery to allow for direct vancomycin injection.
These catheters are silicon tubes with a fibrous cuff that
allows fibrous tissue ingrowth to seal the entry point, pre-
venting ingress and egress of fluid around the catheter, and
have a Luer-lock module and cap to allow injection with a
syringe. Two catheters were inserted to ensure that at least
one would remain viable for the six-week term. Both cath-
eters were used for injection only; the only dispersal of anti-
biotics was through the local venous and lymphatic system.
IA antibiotics were initiated on the evening of the first
day after surgery if the incision was dry. Initially, the dose
was small (100 mg vancomycin in 3 mL of sterile water);
the dose was increased gradually over three to five days to
a maintenance level of 500 mg of vancomycin in 5 mL of
water every 12 or 24 hours. IV antibiotics were discontin-
ued when the maintenance level of IA delivery was estab-
lished. The protocol now has been stabilised such that the
maintenance dose is 400 mg vancomycin in 5 mL sterile
water every 24 hours. Peak and trough serum vancomycin
levels were measured following the third dose, and subse-
quently twice per week, using fluorescent polarisation
immunoarray (FPIA).32,33 The dose was decreased if the
serum vancomyin levels exceeded 22 μg/mL. In three
patients receiving 500 mg of vancomycin every 12 hours,
serum trough level was reported in excess of 20 μg/mL.
Their doses were decreased to 250 mg, and their trough lev-
els decreased to less than 10 μg/mL. After six weeks, the
treatment was concluded and the Hickman catheters were
removed in the operating theatre under local anesthesia as a
day case procedure. An elliptical incision was made around
the catheters, the fibrous cuffs were sharply dissected from
the surrounding subcutaneous tissue, and the catheters
were extracted gently from the knee. The catheters, made of
soft silicon, were handled with care to avoid cutting them
and allowing the tip to escape into the knee. 
In the theatre, immediately before catheter removal, sam-
ples of synovial fluid were taken by arthrocentesis to deter-
mine the IA trough concentration. Then the final dose of
vancomycin was given through the catheter, the knee was
flexed and extended to disperse the antibiotic, and another
specimen of joint fluid was taken through arthrocentesis for
the peak level. For one patient, additional synovial fluid
samples were taken at the one-month follow-up visit. 
Resistant organism study.22 In the second study, direct IA
injection of vancomycin was prospectively evaluated as a
treatment for MRSA in 18 knees (18 patients with a mean
age of 69 years (58 to 84), 11 women and seven men)
referred to the senior author (LAW) between January 2001
and January 2007. All patients had chronic infections of at
least three months’ duration. All patients had important
comorbidities: nine patients had Type II diabetes, 12 had
chronic dependency oedema and stasis dermatitis, nine
were morbidly obese, and 15 had malnutrition and hypo-
albuminemia. Of the 18 patients, 17 had two or more
comorbidities. Four of these patients had had previous two-
stage revisions for infection with antibiotic cement spacers
and antibiotic cement and had revision implants in situ.
Seven patients had primary total knee components and had
had a previous infection treated by debridement with
implant retention and between two and six weeks of IV
antibiotics. Four patients had undergone re-operations
following their primary TKA for patellar tendon avulsion
or patellar subluxation. 
All patients were treated with a protocol comprising
debridement, revision TKA with uncemented components,
and IA antibiotics. In 11 patients, the infected components
were cemented and had cemented diaphyseal engaging

stems in the femur and tibia. The mean follow-up was 62
months (27 to 96). No patients were lost to follow-up. 
In all cases, a thorough debridement was performed
including removal of all non-absorbable sutures, a com-
plete synovectomy, and meticulous cement removal with
the aid of a high-torque reamer to burr away all bone sur-
faces exposed to cement. If necessary, a vascularised osteo-
periosteal flap osteotomy was used to expose the
diaphyseal cement mantle. Hand-pump irrigation with
saline solution of vancomycin (1 g/L), polymyxin B
(250 000 units/L), and bacitracin (50 000 units/L) was used
throughout debridement. After debridement, the surgical
area was cleaned and re-draped, surgical gowns and gloves
were changed, and new sterile instruments were brought
into the sterile field. All revision implants had porous-
coated surfaces applied directly to available bone and had
diaphyseal-engaging titanium alloy stems. Neither cement
nor bone graft was used in any case. Patients received 1 g of
vancomycin intravenously at the time of surgery with two
further doses given at 12 and 24 hours following surgery.
The first IA dose of vancomycin (100 mg of vancomycin in
100 mL of sterile water) was started on the first day after
surgery if the incision was dry, which was then increased in
100 μg/ml increments to a maintenance dose of up to 500 mg
in 10 mL of sterile water. Again, IV vancomycin was dis-
continued once the maintenance IA dose was established.
At least one catheter remained in situ and functional in
all patients for the duration of treatment, with seven of 18
knees having lost one by the end of the six-week treatment
period. Peak and trough serum vancomycin levels were
measured using the same method and intervals used in the
first study. After six weeks, the Hickman catheters were
removed and the joint fluid was cultured. The patients were
seen at two weeks for suture removal, and evaluated at
three months for tenderness, erythema, and induration, and
at yearly intervals. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concen-
tration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were eval-
uated at three months. CRP of less than 25% above the
normal range and ESR less than 50% above the normal
range were considered as signs of resolved infection. 
Revision for re-infection study.23 The third study was designed
to evaluate the success rate of an aggressive protocol to treat
infection following failed two-stage revision. A retrospective
review was conducted of 18 patients (18 knees; 12
women, six men) who had undergone re-revision between
January 1999 and January 2008. A surgical protocol was
used that included tibial tubercle osteotomy for exposure
when necessary in stiff knees to avoid extensive soft-tissue
stripping, bivalve osteotomy of the femur and tibia to
extirpate extensive cement mantles, cementless fixation,
closure with muscle flaps and subfascial skin flaps in cases
with deficient capsule and skin, and IA antibiotics with
Hickman catheters. 
Mean time to initial revision was seven months (1.5 to
13) and to re-revision was five months (1 to 18). All knees
were re-infected with the original organism(s): MRSA in 11
cases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in
two, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in two,
and mixed Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Escherichia
coli (E. coli) in three. All Staphylococcus organisms were
sensitive to vancomycin in concentrations of 2 μg/mL to
5 μg/mL, and the three E. coli and P. mirabilis organisms
were sensitive to gentamycin in concentrations of 2 μg/mL.
The mean follow-up was 6.1 years (2.3 to 12.0). No patient
was lost to follow-up. 
Ten knees (56%) underwent single-stage revision and
five had two-stage procedures with between three and four
months between excision and re-implantation (Fig. 2).
Three knees (16%) had extensive soft-tissue reconstruc-
tions involving a number of operations including tissue
expanders to produce enough skin for closure and external
fixators to achieve adequate limb length before definitive
revision arthroplasty. Two patients required debridement
of the edge of a muscle flap and repeat closure within the
first week post-operatively. Three patients had open drain-
age of haematoma and re-closure during the first two weeks
post-operatively. If the bone and soft-tissue had adequate
circulation to sustain healing, and adequate soft-tissue was
available for closure, revision TKA was performed with the
same technique described above. In cases in which bone
stock and soft-tissue were not deemed adequate for stable
fixation of the implants and secure closure of the joint,
implants were not inserted, Hickman catheters were
inserted for delivery of antibiotics, and closure completed
using available skin and muscle flaps, allowing the extrem-
ity to shorten if necessary. These patients were managed
post-operatively to achieve bone healing of the osteo-
tomies, restore leg length, and gain skin for closure. Three
patients underwent external fixation for gradual lengthen-
ing to regain limb length, and three patients had subfascial
soft-tissue expanders to provide skin for closure.

Two Hickman catheters were inserted in all knees for IA
antibiotic delivery. Post-operatively, the patients received
1 g of vancomycin or 80 mg of gentamicin intravenously
every 12 hours for at least 48 hours post-operatively. IA
infusion of antibiotics began the evening of the first day
after surgery and the IV antibiotics were discontinued after
IA administration was established. As a test dose, 100 mg
of vancomycin in 30 mL of sterile water or 20 mg of gen-
tamicin in 3 mL of sterile water were given, and the concen-
tration and volume were increased daily if the wound
remained quiescent. 
Results
Pharmacokinetic study.31 Patients who received IA vanco-
mycin to treat infected TKA exhibited very high synovial
vancomycin levels. Following injection, the mean synovial
vancomycin peak level was 9242 (3956 to 32 150;
SD 7608 μg/mL). Synovial trough level (mean of 377 μg/mL,
8.4 to 1610) varied with time but exceeded MIC in all sam-
ples. Serum trough level ranged from 4.2 μg/mL to 25.2 μg/
mL (mean, 12.3 μg/mL; average of 9.6% of the joint trough
value), and the MIC was exceeded in all samples. Among
individual patients, the elimination half life (t1/2) of IA van-
comycin ranged from 1.61 to 4.70 hours (mean 3.22
hours). Among all patients, using β as the slope of the expo-
nential regression curve, t1/2 was 3.06 hours (r2 = 0.52,
p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). No adverse events were reported; how-
ever, three of 11 patients had high serum vancomycin
trough levels and their dose was reduced as a result. No
patient had elevated urea or creatinine concentrations in
the serum. 
Resistant organism study.22 In total 17 of 18 patients were
clinically free of infection at last follow-up in January 2007,
and had laboratory evidence of resolved infection by the
third post-operative month. None of the synovial fluid cul-
tures taken at the time of catheter removal were positive for
bacteria. One patient had elevated ESR and CRP concen-
tration at three months post-operatively and redeveloped
clinically apparent infection with MRSA five months after
initial revision and debridement. The knee was re-explored
and a fragment of necrotic bone measuring 2 cm to 3 cm on
the anterior surface of the femur was found. Complete
debridement was repeated, the polyethylene component
was exchanged, and the metal components were retained.
Hickman catheters were inserted, and the knee was treated
for six weeks with IA vancomycin. At 42 months post-
operatively, this knee had no clinical signs of infection.
Other than the case with persistent infection, none of the
implants has been revised for loosening or other reasons.
Mean serum vancomycin peak concentration was 6.1
(SD 4.1 μg/mL) and mean serum vancomycin trough con-
centration level was 3.2 (SD 1.0 μg/mL) at two weeks post-
operatively. Because of elevated serum vancomycin concen-
tration, five patients required the dose to be decreased to
500 mg once daily, and one required the antibiotics to be
held for four days while the levels normalised. Three
required discontinuation of the antibiotic infusion for two
to three days because of local inflammatory response to
precipitated vancomycin. Six patients (six knees) (33%)
had elevated urea and creatinine levels during the six weeks
of antibiotic infusion and required temporary discontinua-
tion of IA vancomycin for two days. IA infusion then was
resumed at a lower dose. None required complete discon-
tinuation of vancomycin infusion for more than four days. 
Revision for reinfection study.23 Infection was controlled in
17 of 18 knees. One patient had a recurrent infection 13
months after single-stage debridement, revision, and pri-
mary closure of the knee. This knee was debrided again,
infused with vancomycin for six weeks with no implant in
place, and re-implanted with cementless implants six
weeks after catheter removal. The CRP and ESR were nor-
mal at re-implantation with no sign of infection at 28
months follow-up. In one knee, soft-tissue closure was not
achieved intra-operatively; the wound continued to drain
and, two months after beginning treatment, the patient
underwent an above-knee amputation. CRP and ESR
were within normal limits at two-year follow-up in 16 of
the 17 patients. One patient, who has chronic gingivitis,
stasis dermatitis, and arteriosclerotic coronary artery dis-
ease, had elevated markers at one-year, but the knee was
asymptomatic and neither examination nor aspiration
demonstrated any signs of infection. No patient required
chronic suppressive antibiotics.
The mean serum vancomycin peak level at one month
post-operatively was 4.1 (SD 1.2 μg/mL), and mean trough
level was 3.3 (SD 1 μg/mL). The mean serum peak gen-
tamicin level was 1.1 (SD 1 μg/mL) and trough level was
0.2 (SD 0.1 μg/mL). Three patients with vancomycin and
one with gentamicin infusion required temporary cessa-
tion of antibiotic infusion and resumption at a lower dose

ing urea and creatinine levels.
Discussion
The protocols described above achieved control of infec-
tion in the majority of patients in the study. IA delivery of
antibiotics produced peak concentrations many orders of
magnitude higher than achieved after IV administration,
trough levels which remained therapeutic for 24 hours,
with therapeutic levels also achieved in the serum. The 11
patients in the pharmacokinetic study had vancomycin
concentrations in the synovial space ranging from
3956 μg/mL to 32 150 μg/mL, which is similar to the ami-
kacin levels achieved with a similar protocol by Perry et
al.28 In contrast to the synovial fluid levels achieved from
IV dosing, which tend to become subtherapeutic in the
knee after six hours, IA administration was shown to
maintain the concentration of vancomycin within the knee
joint above MIC for at least 24 hours following the dose.
IV administration of vancomycin produced joint levels
that were 35% of serum levels on average, while IA
administration of vancomycin produced a peak joint con-
centration that on average was 750 times higher than the
serum concentration. In addition, serum trough levels fol-
lowing IA administration of vancomycin remained thera-
peutic, with the mean value greater than the 10 μg/mL
recommended to avoid resistance.11
Extremely high antibiotic concentrations in the syno-
vial fluid have a distinct advantage in treating IA infec-
tions involving a metal implant. The therapeutic
effectiveness of antibiotics such as vancomycin that
inhibit cell wall and RNA synthesis is proportional to
both the concentration achieved and the time during
which the concentration remains high.11-14 This factor is
especially important when bacteria have formed a glyco-
calyx on implant surfaces.34 Since the formation of small
colony variants with long reproductive intervals contrib-
utes to antibiotic resistance in treatment,35,36 it seems
likely that the sustained high concentrations of antibiotics
that are achieved with daily IA injection will be important
in the effective management of IA infections involving
metallic implants.
Direct IA antibiotic infusion with single-stage revision
using cementless implants safely and effectively eradicated
MRSA and provided a well-fixed implant in spite of the
lack of antibiotic-loaded cement. Single-stage revision
avoided the morbidity and inconvenience associated with
the use of an antibiotic spacer and the need for a second
surgical procedure. Infection was controlled in 17 of 18
patients with the first procedure, and in the failed proce-
dure after debridement and repeat single-stage revision. 
Two-stage revision, using IV antibiotics and antibiotic-
loaded PMMA spacers to deliver antibiotics into the
joint is considered the conservative surgical approach
to this condition,3,4,19,37 but its clinical results are disap-
pointing. Re-infection rates varying from 11% to 24%
have been reported in centres experienced in care of
these difficult cases using two-stage debridement and
re-implantation.15,16,18,38
Cemented fixation of implants is less successful in
revision than in primary cases,19,39-43 and would appear
to have a higher failure rate in cases with persistent infec-
tion from indolent bacteria. The use of cementless fixa-
tion with porous devices in revision arthroplasty leads to
a high rate of successful fixation in the hip and has
become the dominant mode of fixation in revision
THA.44-46 Our centre has reported excellent results using
cementless fixation for revision of infected TKA, with a
success rate similar to that reported using cementless
revision THA.47
The re-infection cohort, where the revised cases had pre-
viously undergone failed two-stage revision for infected
TKA, illustrates the severity of the bone loss in such cases
and the effort required to achieve successful, infection-free
reconstruction. The use of proven surgical procedures com-
bined with IA antibiotic infusion led to control of infection
in 17 of 18 knees. The types of cases in this cohort involve
problems that cannot be solved only with high levels of
antibiotics, but also require aggressive exposure and limb
salvage techniques and often multiple procedures to pre-
pare the extremity for reimplantation of the arthroplasty
components. 
These studies have demonstrated that daily IA injection
of antibiotics achieves and maintains high synovial antibi-
otic concentrations, well above concentrations achievable
using IV infusion. At our institution the single-stage proce-
dure - including debridement and use of Hickman catheters
for six weeks of IA antibiotic administration - is our proto-
col, even with highly resistant organisms.
