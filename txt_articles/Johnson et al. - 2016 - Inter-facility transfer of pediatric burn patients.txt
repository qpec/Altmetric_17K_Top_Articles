Abstract
Purpose—To describe the epidemiology of pediatric burn patients seen in U.S. emergency 
departments (EDs) and to determine factors associated with inter-facility transfer.
Methods—We analyzed data from the 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Current 
American Burn Association (ABA) Guidelines were used to identify children <18 who met criteria 
for referral to burn centers. Burn patient admission volume was used as a proxy for burn expertise. 
Logistic models were fitted to examine the odds of transfer from low volume hospitals.
Results—In 2012, there were an estimated 126,742 (95% CI: 116,104–137,380) pediatric burn 
ED visits in the U.S. Of the 69,003 (54.4%) meeting referral criteria, 83.2% were in low volume 
hospitals. Only 8.2% of patients meeting criteria were transferred from low volume hospitals. Of

 the 52,604 (95% CI: 48,433 – 56,775) not transferred, 98.3% were treated and released and 1.7% 
were admitted without transfer; 54.7% of burns involved hands.
Conclusions—Over 90% of pediatric burn ED patients meet ABA burn referral criteria but are 
not transferred from low volume hospitals. Perhaps a portion of the 92% of patients currently 
receiving definitive care in low volume hospitals are under-referred and would have improved 
clinical outcomes if transferred at the time of presentation.

Introduction
Every day in the United States, over 300 children aged 0 to 19 are seen in emergency 
departments with burn-related injuries.[1] Patients under the age of 18 comprise 26.8% of all 
burn injury admissions.[2] Ensuring that pediatric patients with significant burns receive 
care in hospitals with burn care expertise is important because lower mortality rates are 
associated with hospitals that have higher burn admission volumes. These facilities may also 
achieve better functional outcomes for patients.[3–9] Expertise is even more crucial when 
dealing with children, whose care needs are unique and distinct from adults.[7, 9, 10] 
Palmieri et al. found that even within verified and non-verified burn centers, pediatric 
experience as measured by annual pediatric burn patient admissions plays a role in patient 
mortality.[9] Other outcomes may be affected as well, since hospitals with low numbers of 
pediatric patients may lack pediatric specific social, emotional, and rehabilitative services.
The American College of Surgeons and American Burn Association (ABA) have a joint 
program to verify burn care facilities. As a result, hospitals fall into one of three categories: 
verified burn centers who have met the ABA’s rigorous requirements for burn care 
resources; non-verified burn centers who are self-listed in the ABA directory but do not have 
ABA verification; and non-burn centers.[11] The ABA outlines certain characteristics of a 
burn injury that warrant referral to a facility equipped with burn care resources.[12] Most 
ABA referral criteria relate to the size, degree, and mechanism of the burn, but there is also a 
criterion specific to the pediatric population, recommending referral from hospitals without 
qualified personnel and equipment for the care of children. These criteria are not strict rules 
dictating automatic transfer to a burn center, but rather guidelines recommending burn-
specific referral which can include outpatient referral and inter-facility transfer. Inter-facility 
transfer has been used in previous studies, as well as in the current study, to evaluate a 
component of referral.[3, 5, 13–15]
Previous studies have reported that pediatric hospitals treat 56% of hospitalized pediatric 
burn patients, and that children seen in pediatric hospitals are those with more severe burns.
[13, 16] Zonies et al. utilized a national dataset to describe inpatients with significant burns 
that meet criteria for referral to a burn center.[14] They reported that for pediatric inpatients, 
25% were cared for in verified burn centers, 30% were treated in non-verified burn centers, 
and 45% received care in non-burn centers.[14] One recent statewide study in North 
Carolina reported that 55% of children treated at non-burn centers meet criteria for transfer.

 [15] Similarly, Carter et al. found that in a statewide sample of adult inpatients, 47% of burn 
injuries received acute inpatient care at non-burn centers, and almost half of these met 
referral criteria.[3] They also found that all burn-related deaths at non-burn centers had met 
criteria for transfer.[3]
Our study seeks to fill a gap in knowledge regarding pediatric patients with significant burns 
seen in emergency departments (EDs). Prior research examining transfer patterns and the 
treatment locations of burn patients have only studied hospitalized patients,[13, 14, 16] and 
other studies have been focused primarily on adults.[3, 14] Our study is drawn from a 
nationally representative sample of emergency departments. This study is the first to provide 
national estimates of the number of pediatric patients who meet ABA referral criteria and to 
examine factors associated with inter-facility transfer from US EDs.
Methods
Data Source
This study utilized the most current data available, the 2012 Nationwide Emergency 
Department Sample (NEDS) which is a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 
(HCUP). The NEDS is the largest publicly available database containing de-identified 
discharge data for emergency department (ED) visits, with data from over 950 hospitals in 
30 states. Each year, HCUP produces an approximately 20% stratified sample of U.S. 
hospital-based EDs, and it includes weighting variables to calculate national estimates. The 
2012 NEDS contains approximately 30 million ED visits and an estimated 130 million 
discharges after weighting, with over 100 clinical and nonclinical variables per visit. The 
following hospital characteristics were used for sample stratification: U.S. Census region, 
trauma center designation, urban-rural location of the hospital, ownership, and teaching 
status.[17] More detailed information, such as the states included in the 2012 NEDS, is 
available on the HCUP website.[17]
Patient and burn characteristics
We identified children under the age of 18 with burn injuries using International 
Classification of Disease Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes for burn 
injuries (ICD-9 codes 940–949). We included the following patient and burn injury 
characteristics: patient gender, age, median household income by zip code, patient 
disposition from the ED, expected primary payer, burn site, burn degree, and total body 
surface area (TBSA) burned. We also included burn mechanism using external cause of 
injury codes (E codes); each ED visit may have up to four E codes. Codes associated with 
intentional injuries/undetermined intent are reported separately.
American Burn Association (ABA) referral criteria
We created variables for American Burn Association (ABA) referral criteria describing those 
patients with burn injuries that should be referred to a burn center. These ABA referral 
criteria variables included: partial-thickness burns >10% TBSA; partial-thickness burns to 
the face/head/neck, hand, foot/joint, and genitalia; full-thickness burns; electrical burns; 
chemical burns; inhalation injury; burns in patients with comorbid conditions; and burns

 with concomitant trauma.[12] Comorbid conditions were defined using a variable available 
in the NEDS, the Chronic Condition indicator, which labels all available ICD-9 diagnosis 
codes as chronic or non-chronic.[18] We included all chronic conditions except those the 
NEDS categorizes as resulting from injuries. Concomitant trauma was defined as another 
trauma diagnosis and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) >9. In the NEDS, ISS is assigned using 
ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes by a publicly-available Stata program (ICDPIC). Burns are not 
included in the ICDPIC’s ISS calculation. We did not create a variable for the ABA referral 
criterion specific to children, because our study looked exclusively at patients <18 years old. 
This criterion recommends referral from hospitals without qualified personnel and 
equipment for the care of children. Given the variables available in NEDS, we also did not 
attempt to create a referral criterion variable for patients who needed social, emotional, or 
rehabilitative services.
Hospital burn care resources
In this study, we used annual hospital burn patient admission volume as a proxy for burn 
center resources, including burn expertise to care for children. Our annual hospital burn 
patient admission volume variable includes both adult and pediatric burn admissions. In our 
study, low volume hospitals were defined as those with <50 burn admissions per year and 
high volume hospitals were those with ≥50 burn admissions. While the ABA Guidelines for 
the Operation of Burn Centers, in place at the time the data was collected, used ≥100 annual 
burn admissions for burn center verification, we are not attempting to identify verified 
centers but rather those hospitals with burn care experience (with or without verification).
[12] Additionally, a recent review of the burn center verification guidelines, updated in 
February of 2015, allows centers to consider five new outpatients as one inpatient.[19] In our 
sample, there were only six hospitals with burn patient admission volumes in the range of 
50–99.
Children’s hospitals were identified by calculating the median age of patients admitted in 
each hospital. The median age of patients for some hospitals is less than ten, while for others 
it is over twenty, and no hospitals fall in between. For this reason we identified children’s 
hospitals as hospitals with a median patient age <10 years. Hospitals were also categorized 
according to their urban-rural designation. We are making the assumption that transferred 
pediatric patients are being sent to hospitals with the necessary burn care resources; we 
cannot confirm this using the NEDS dataset. It is acknowledged that referral occurs in the 
context of the care available within each region.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC) software. We used NEDS 
weighting variables to calculate national estimates with confidence intervals and weighted 
percentages for demographics, hospital characteristics, and burn injury characteristics of all 
pediatric burn-related ED visits. We produced incidence rates by age and gender for burn ED 
visits using US census data.
We report patient disposition by burn characteristics for both low and high volume hospitals. 
Patients who were admitted but then transferred were included as transfers. For those

 patients meeting referral criteria, we then examined transfer rates by hospital burn patient 
admission volume.
Patients who met at least one referral criterion and were either admitted, or treated and 
released without transfer, by a low volume hospital were of interest and are shown in gray in 
Figure 1. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine which factors were 
associated with transfer among those patients meeting referral criteria and first seen in low 
volume hospitals. The variables of interest in our study were the ABA referral criteria and 
confounding variables included patient age, gender, urban-rural designation of patient 
residence, median household income by zip code, and expected primary payer. Those 
confounding variables were chosen because they can affect patient transfer between medical 
facilities. The primary purpose of the logistic regression analysis was to identify risk factors 
for transfer; therefore, we reported adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
each independent variable in the model. We used SAS procedures for weighted sample data 
analysis.
Results
Characteristics of pediatric burn ED visits
There were a total of 28,363 pediatric burn-related ED visits identified in the 2012 NEDS 
sample, producing a weighted national estimate of 126,742 (95% CI: 116,104–137,380). 
Demographics and hospital characteristics are shown in Table 1. The majority of pediatric 
burn-related ED visits were seen in children age 4 and under. There was a peak in the 
population rates at age one, and rates in males were higher at this age (Figure 2). Those 
patients residing in zip codes with the lowest income were the largest proportion of patients, 
representing nearly 35% of burn ED patients. As household income by zip code increased, 
the proportions of pediatric burn patients residing in those zip codes decreased. Over half of 
the ED visits involved patients for whom public insurance was the expected primary payer. 
Nearly half of all pediatric burn patients resided in large metropolitan areas. Nearly 80% 
(95% CI: 72.38%–85.49%) of pediatric burn ED visits were in hospitals with under 20 
annual burn patient admissions. Overall, 90.3% of patients were treated and released from 
the ED, 4.0% were admitted to that same hospital without transfer, and 5.6% were 
transferred.
Pediatric burn injury characteristics are shown in Table 2. The most common burn site 
involved the wrist(s) and hand(s), followed by lower limb(s). Over two-thirds of visits 
involved second degree burns. TBSA burned was unspecified in over half of patients; 
however, of those with unspecified TBSA burned, nearly 95% were treated and released and 
less than 5% were transferred (data not shown). Nearly 40% of all patients had a TBSA 
<10%. The most commonly coded mechanism for injury was hot object/substance: other/
unspecified (44.6%) followed by hot liquids and vapors, including steam (28.6%). Fire and 
flames was reported in 11.3% of visits. In 2012, 69,003 ED patients (54.4%) had burns 
which met at least one referral criterion (95% CI: 53.1%–55.8%). A partial-thickness burn of 
the hand was the most frequently met criterion.

 Patient disposition by burn characteristics
Table 3a shows patient disposition from the low volume hospitals by burn characteristics. Of 
those meeting at least one referral criterion in low volume hospitals, 90.1% were treated and 
released. Partial thickness burns >10% TBSA burned was the criterion with the greatest 
proportion transferred (50.1%), followed by partial thickness burns of the genitalia (39.8%). 
Only 5.2% of children with partial thickness burns of the hand were transferred from low 
volume hospitals, and 72.6% (4,562) of patients meeting more than one criterion were 
treated and released. Of the 6,648 transferred patients from low volume hospitals, 1,921 did 
not meet any referral criteria; of these, an estimated 1,201 had missing TBSA burned (data 
not shown). Table 3b shows patient disposition from high volume hospitals by burn 
characteristics. Of those meeting at least one referral criterion in high volume hospitals, 
68.5% were treated and released. Admission rates for patients meeting referral criteria 
appear higher in the high volume hospitals. Direct statistical comparisons were not made 
between high and low volume hospital patient dispositions. High volume hospitals may be 
more likely to receive transfer patients. Patients seen in sample high volume hospitals may 
have been transferred from sample low volume hospitals.
Patients with significant burns (meeting referral criteria)
Table 4 shows the ED disposition of patients with burns meeting at least one referral 
criterion by annual hospital burn patient admission volume. An estimated 57,382 (95% CI: 
52,801–61,962) were initially seen in low volume hospitals, with 78.9% first seen in 
hospitals with <20 burn admissions.
Despite meeting criteria for referral to a burn center, only 8.2% (95% CI: 7.3%–9.1%) of 
these patients were transferred from low volume hospitals, leaving an estimated 52,604 
(95% CI: 48,433–56,775) patients who were not transferred. The rates of transfer from the 
high volume hospitals were similar for those hospitals with 50–99 burn admissions (3.1%) 
and those with 100 or more admissions (2.8%).
Patients with significant burns but not transferred
Among the patients with significant burns receiving their definitive care in low volume 
hospitals, an estimated 51,700 were treated and released and 905 were admitted without 
subsequent transfer by low volume hospitals (Figure 1). The most commonly met referral 
criterion in this group was partial-thickness burns of the hand, which was met by 54.7% 
(95% CI: 53.6%–55.9%) of patients with significant burns managed in low volume hospitals 
(data not shown). Of the estimated 28,798 patients with second degree hand burns in this 
group, 28,622 were treated and released and 175 were admitted. The next most commonly 
met criteria among those not transferred were burns of the feet or joints (19.2%, 95% CI: 
18.3%–20.0%), followed by burns of the face/head and neck (14.0%, 95% CI: 13.3%–
14.8%).
Factors associated with transfer
The results of logistic regression modeling transfer of pediatric burn ED patients meeting 
referral criteria from low volume hospitals are shown in Table 5. Patients with age <5 (AOR, 
1.75; 95% CI: 1.29–2.36), partial-thickness burns with >10% TBSA (AOR, 12.61; 95% CI:

 9.54–16.65), full-thickness burns (AOR, 6.43; 95% CI: 4.58–9.03), and burns of the face/
head/neck (AOR, 3.41; 95% CI: 2.68–4.34) or genitalia (AOR, 10.55; 95% CI: 5.76–19.33) 
were more likely to be transferred. Patients from medium metropolitan areas (AOR, 0.62; 
95% CI: 0.43–0.91) and those with chemical burns (AOR, 0.50; 95% CI: 0.34–0.74) were 
less likely to be transferred. Income by zip code and expected primary payer were not 
associated with transfer. Aside from being children, 28.7% of all transfers did not meet any 
additional referral criteria. These patients are not included in our logistic model. There is a 
criterion specific to the pediatric population, recommending referral from hospitals without 
qualified personnel and equipment for the care of children.
Discussion
In 2012, over half of pediatric burn patients met the ABA criteria for referral to a burn 
center, and over 78.9% of these children were first seen in hospitals with <20 burn 
admissions/year. Nevertheless, only 8.2% of patients meeting criteria were transferred from 
low volume hospitals presumably to hospitals with burn care expertise. Certain criteria were 
positively associated with transfer: age <5 years, burns >10% TBSA, full-thickness burns, 
and burns of the face/head/neck or genitalia. Insurance status and income were not 
associated with transfer. There has been little previous comparison research examining ABA 
burn referral criteria in children. Zonies et al. analyzed two years of burn patient admissions 
using HCUP national in-patient data.[14] Those admitted to verified centers were more 
likely to have head/neck burns, hand burns, or electrical burns, but their sample included 
both adults and children. These authors reported that patients under the age of five were 
more likely to be admitted to verified/non-verified burn centers, but no other pediatric-
specific results were reported. Doud et al. studied pediatric burn in-patients from 2000 to 
2007 using a statewide database and found that neither age nor gender was associated with 
treatment location; however, 78% of burn-specific procedures performed at non-verified 
burn centers were performed on patients meeting referral criteria.[15]
It is possible that some children treated without inter-facility transfer are receiving adequate 
burn care in the ED or with outpatient follow-up care, especially for minor burns. The 
guidelines, however, do not outline when this is appropriate, leaving the course of care and 
consultation with burn centers to the discretion of ED providers in low volume hospitals. A 
previous study has reported on the notable opportunity for error in this decision-making 
process.[20] One way to lessen this documented room for error involves clear guidance from 
the ABA and from burn centers to referring hospitals about these care continuum and 
consultation decisions.[21]
Another concern is that any recommended outpatient burn-specific care relies on caregivers 
to transport the child to a burn center. Other researchers have recommended a revision of the 
ABA guidelines in order to differentiate between significant burns requiring immediate 
transfer, from burns requiring burn center care but without an urgent need for transfer.[20] 
Others have suggested more detailed collection of outpatient and outcome data in the 
National Burn Registry to facilitate this research.[22] These authors provide an evaluation of 
the additional resources needed to collect outpatient data in their hospitals’ burn registry.[22] 
Evaluating burn center outpatient populations in relation to the ABA referral guidelines may

 add to our understanding of follow-up care patterns. In trying to address these concerns with 
burn center referral, the practice of telemedicine has recently been discussed as a potential 
area of investigation in improving burn care.[20, 23] Saffle et al. found that burn size 
estimates given by remote burn center physicians correlated closely with direct inspection 
without sacrificing provider or patient satisfaction.[23] The authors concluded that this 
practice of telemedicine may be able to improve utilization of burn care resources and 
provide cost-effective burn center expertise to many rural communities. Given the large 
numbers of pediatric patients with significant burns, greater use of telephone consultation 
and telemedicine is merited.
Limitations
The sampling and national estimation weighting in the NEDS database is a major strength of 
this research. However, perhaps the greatest limitation of this study is that TBSA burned was 
missing from nearly 58% of the burn-related visits; however, nearly 95% of these patients 
were treated and released and less than 5% were transferred. Of the 6,648 transferred 
patients from low volume hospitals, 1,921 did not meet any referral criteria; of these, an 
estimated 1,201 had missing TBSA burned. It is possible that referring hospitals do not 
always calculate TBSA burned and leave this to the receiving hospital. It is also worth 
noting that major discrepancies by hospital have been shown in pediatric burn size estimates. 
Goverman et al. (2015) found that 94% of children referred to a pediatric burn center had 
inaccurate burn size estimates from the referring hospital.[24] Because ICD-9 coding is 
intended for billing purposes, this may also explain the low reporting of TBSA burned. 
Transferring hospitals may not have pediatric specific care resources, and this may partially 
explain the transfer of children not meeting other burn referral criteria.
Another limitation is that burn center designation is not specified in the NEDS database. We 
used annual burn patient admission volume ≥50 as a conservative proxy for pediatric burn 
care expertise.[12] This does not guarantee that the hospitals that we classified as high 
volume are burn centers. Since we included both adult and pediatric burn admissions, 
hospitals classified as high volume may still not have sufficient pediatric burn care 
resources. Finally, the NEDS database does not provide information about patients referred 
for follow-up care at a burn center, so that some patients meeting ABA criteria may be 
referred to burn facilities without inter-facility transfer.
Conclusions
The current study found that a small proportion of burned children meeting ABA criteria are 
transferred from low volume hospitals. This finding raises concerns: the ABA referral 
criteria for pediatric burn patients may be too broad, and would possibly benefit from 
urgency specifications regarding care; perhaps a portion of the 92% of patients currently 
receiving definitive care in low volume hospitals are under-referred and would have 
improved clinical outcomes if transferred upon presentation. If outpatient referral is 
recommended for a substantial proportion of pediatric burn patients meeting ABA referral 
criteria, relying on caregivers may be problematic. Further research on the long-term care 
and outcomes of pediatric burn patients is needed to address these concerns.
