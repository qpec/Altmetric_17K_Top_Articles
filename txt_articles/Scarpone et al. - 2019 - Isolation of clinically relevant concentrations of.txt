Abstract 
Background: This study examined the quality of bone marrow aspirates extracted using a novel, FDA cleared 
method to optimally target cells from the inner cortical iliac bone surface without the need for centrifugation. 
This method employs small draws from a single puncture that promote only lateral flow from multiple sites (SSLM 
method). The study utilized the Marrow Cellutions bone marrow aspiration system (MC system) which is based on the 
SSLM method and compared the MC system directly to bone marrow concentrates (BMAC) generated by centrifuga-
tion of aspirates harvested with a standard aspiration needle.
Methods: Three direct comparisons were conducted evaluating the SSLM draws and BMACs derived from the same 
patient from contralateral iliac crests. The levels of TNCs/mL, CD34+ cells/mL, CD117+ cells/mL, and CFU-f/mL were 
compared between the various bone marrow preparations. The cellular content of a series of SSLM draws was also 
analyzed to determine the total nucleated cell (TNC) count and the concentration of mesenchymal stem/progenitor 
cells as measured by colony forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-f).
Results: In direct comparisons with BMAC systems, SSLM draws yielded significantly higher CFU-f concentrations 
and comparable concentrations of CD34+ and CD117+ cells. In addition, the average quantity of TNCs/mL in a 
series of 30 patients utilizing the SSLM draw was 35.2 × 106 ± 17.1 × 106 and the average number of CFU-f/mL was 
2885 ± 1716. There were small but significant correlations between the TNCs/mL and the CFU-fs/mL using the SSLM 
method as well as between the age of the patient and the CFU-fs/mL.
Conclusions: The MC Device, using the SSLM draw technique, produced concentrations of CFU-fs, CD34+ cells and 
CD117+ cells that were comparable or greater to BMACs derived from the same patient. Given the rapid speed and 
simplicity of the MC Device, we believe this novel system possesses significant practical advantages to other currently 
available centrifugation based systems.

Background
Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and concentrates (BMAC) 
have been used to treat a variety of orthopedic injuries as 
well as critical limb ischemia and heart failure with posi-
tive clinical outcomes being linked to higher numbers of 
stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow sample [1–7]. 
Because of their clinical importance, a variety of tech-
niques exist to increase the yield of stem/progenitor cells 
in bone marrow aspirate [6, 8]. Unfortunately, attempts 
to aspirate excess bone marrow (a volume over 1 mL 
from a single site) will introduce significant peripheral 
blood that has lower numbers of stem/progenitor cells 
into the aspiration [9–11]. In addition, given the variety 
of niches in which stem/progenitor cells reside within 
the bone and marrow space [12–14], different aspiration 
techniques may be more or less effective at preferentially 
extracting cells from different niches.
A common option to increase the concentration of 
stem/progenitor cells in large volume aspirates is to con-
centrate the aspirate by density gradient separation using 
a centrifuge-based system [6, 11]. While BMAC systems 
can increase the concentration of nucleated cells in the 
aspirate [11], because they do not distinguish between 
peripheral blood and marrow components, they may 
merely increase the level of peripheral blood nucleated 
cells, which contain very few stem/progenitor cells.
A novel approach to potentially overcome this issue is 
to utilize the Marrow Cellutions bone marrow aspiration 
system (MC system) which employs multiple small vol-
ume draws (1 mL) from a single puncture that promote 
lateral flow from multiple sites near the inner cortical 
bone space in the bone marrow (SSLM method). It is 
known that this anatomical location contains a high con-
centration of bone marrow stem/progenitor cells [12–
14]. In addition, The aspiration cannula used to employ 
this method is: (1) closed on the end to limit peripheral 
blood infiltration from the distal end of the cannula, (2) 
has side holes to preferentially draw cells from the sides 
closest to the inner cortical plate verses the center of the 
iliac bone, and (3) has a mechanical feature to precisely 
re-position the side aspiration ports within the medullary 
space.
In this study, we performed three direct compari-
sons between SSLM derived bone marrow aspirates and 
BMAC systems using contralateral iliac crest draws from 
the same patient. In comparison 1, the SSLM method 
was compared to Harvest BMACs derived from three 
puncture sites. In comparison 2, the SSLM method was 
compared to Harvest BMACs derived from a single 
puncture site. Finally, in comparison 3, the SSLM method 
was compared to EmCyte BMACs derived from a sin-
gle puncture site. The levels of TNCs/mL, CFU-fs/mL, 
CD34+/mL and CD117+/mL were examined in these 
comparisons to determine differences in cellular compo-
nents obtained using SSLM and BMAC systems. Finally, 
we measured the levels of TNCs/mL and CFU-fs/mL 
harvested by the SSLM method in a series of 30 patients. 
We found that the MC system produced concentrations 
of CFU-fs, CD34+ cells and CD117+ cells that were 
comparable or greater to BMACs derived from the same 
patient.
Materials and methods
Three different direct comparisons were performed 
between the SSLM method (MC system) and different 
BMAC systems. In all three cases, contralateral iliac crest 
draws from the same patient were used for comparison. 
In the first comparison, the levels of TNCs, CFU-fs, and 
CD34+ cells obtained using the SSLM method (single 
puncture) were compared to BMACs obtained via three 
punctures from the same patient’s contralateral hip. In 
the second comparison, the levels of TNCs, CD34+ cells, 
and the related hematopoietic progenitor CD117+ cells 
obtained via the SSLM method (single puncture) were 
compared to BMACs obtained via a single puncture using 
the same BMAC system as comparison one. To determine 
if the specific centrifuge system influenced the results, the 
third comparison tested an additional centrifugation sys-
tem. In this case, the levels of TNCs, CFU-fs, and CD34+ 
cells obtained via the SSLM method (single puncture) 
were compared to BMACs obtained via a single puncture 
using a different BMAC system. Finally, the cellular con-
tent of a series of SSLM draws was analyzed to determine 
the total nucleated cell (TNC) count and the concentra-
tion of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells as measured 
by CFU-fs to see how the levels of CFU-fs using the SSLM 
method compared to previously published thresholds for 
CFU-f levels required for clinical effectiveness.
Bone marrow aspiration and concentration
All bone marrow aspirates (BMA) were taken from the 
posterior superior iliac spine. A careful review of the 
manufacturer’s most recent instructions for use, (writ-
ten instructions and on-line video) prior to aspiration 
and processing was performed for the Harvest BMAC 
system, the EmCyte BMAC system and the Marrow Cel-
lution (MC) system which employed the SSLM method. 
The EmCyte and Harvest BMACs were processed within 
the procedure room following the manufacturers rec-
ommendations. For the SSLM method, aspirates were 
performed along the insertion trajectory, starting distal 
to the point of entry into the medullary space, with the 
device mechanically repositioning the aspiration ports to 
a new location after each 1 mL of aspiration. BMA was 
aspirated using a 10 mL syringe using quick sharp pulls of 
the plunger at each 360 degree turn. For each 1 mL draw,

the aspiration ports were moved approximately 3/4 cm 
out of the body. A total of 8 to 12 mL of bone marrow was 
harvested. Samples were then analyzed at one of three 
laboratories using the protocols described below. Lab 1: 
Franciscan University of Steubenville, Steubenville, OH. 
Lab 2: BSR Laboratories, Cambridge, MA. Lab 3: The 
Centre of Research and Formation High Technologies 
“Johannes Paulus II”
, Catholic University of Campobasso. 
The study was approved by the Franciscan University 
Institutional Review Board and the Catholic University 
of Campobasso Institutional Review Board and informed 
consent was obtained from all participants.
First centrifuge comparison
Bone marrow aspirate samples were collected during 
spine surgery from the iliac spine by Clinician A from 
five patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures. 
BMA was aspirated from randomly assigned alternate 
iliac crests, using either the Harvest BMAC system or 
the MC system. While Clinician A had significant expe-
rience using the Harvest BMAC system, it was this cli-
nician’s first attempt at using the MC system. Aspiration 
of 20 mL from three separate punctures was performed 
for the Harvest BMAC sample for centrifugation; a sin-
gle puncture was performed with the MC system using 
the technique described above. Laboratory analysis was 
performed at Lab 2. TNC levels were counted utilizing 
an automated analyzer (Coulter Ac.T diff2). CD34+ cells 
concentrations [15] and CFU-f levels [16] were analyzed 
using methods described previously. All samples were 
processed within 24 h of collection.
Second centrifuge comparison
Five sets of bone marrow aspirate samples were col-
lected from a single puncture in patients with end stage 
critical limb ischemia from each iliac spine by Clinician 
B. BMA was aspirated from randomly assigned alternate 
iliac crests, using either the Harvest BMAC system or the 
MC system. This was Clinician B’s first attempt at using 
the MC system. The levels of TNCs, CD34+ cells, and 
CD 117+ cells in the samples were then analyzed at Lab 3 
using their previously published methodologies [17]. All 
samples were processed within 8 h of collection.
Third centrifuge comparison
Bone marrow aspirate samples were collected from a sin-
gle puncture from each iliac spine, randomly assigned 
to alternate iliac crests, using either the EmCyte BMAC 
system or the MC system in three patients undergoing 
elective orthopedic procedures. The MC Device was used 
by Clinician C using the same method described above. 
Samples were then analyzed in Lab 1 to determine TNC/
mL, CD34+ cells/mL, and CFU-f/mL levels.
To determine TNC levels, the BMA was diluted 1:20 
in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and mixed 1:1 
with AO/PI dye (Nexcelom Bioscience). The sample was 
then counted using a Cellometer Vision CBA Cytometry 
System (Nexcelom Bioscience) to determine the concen-
tration of live and dead nucleated cells. All samples were 
counted in duplicate.
To measure CFU-f levels, 5–10 μLs of undiluted bone 
marrow was plated in 6-well dishes containing 3 mLs of 
DMEM/F12 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 15% 
MSC qualified FBS (GIBCO) and an antibiotic/antimy-
cotic mix (Gibco). Cells were cultured under standard 
conditions, 37 °C, 5%  
CO2. After 48 h, the wells were 
washed four times with HBSS to remove non-adherent 
cells. The cells were then cultured for 12 additional days 
with the media being changed every 3 days. After 14 days 
total, the colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet 
solution in methanol. Colonies with 100 or more cells 
were counted as CFU-fs. All samples were processed in 
duplicate.
The levels of CD34+ cells were determined using the 
established ISHAGE protocol [18]. Briefly, 50 μLs of mar-
row was mixed with 40 μLs of cell staining buffer, 5 μLs of 
PE conjugated CD34+ antibody (Biolegend) and 5 μLs of 
FITC conjugated CD45+ antibody (Biolegend) and incu-
bated for 20 min at RT. RBC lysis buffer was then added 
and samples were then run on an Accuri flow cytometry 
using gates established by the ISHAGE protocol. All sam-
ples were processed within 8 h of collection.
Case series
A series of 30 consecutive patients from the same clini-
cian (Clinician C) underwent marrow aspiration using 
the MC system for use in elective orthopedic procedures. 
Clinician C had previous experience using the MC sys-
tem as described above. Samples were then analyzed in 
Lab 1 to determine TNC/mL and CFU-f/mL levels using 
the methods described above. All samples were pro-
cessed within 8 h of collection.
Statistics
For the three different comparisons between the MC sys-
tem and centrifugation systems, TNC, CFU-f, CD34+ 
and CD117+ levels were compared using paired stu-
dent t-tests. Prism software was used for all the above 
statistical analyses. For the case series of 30, the age, 
TNC counts, and CFU-f counts are reported as average 
counts ± SD. The data were analyzed for normal distribu-
tion using a Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Correlations 
between TNC counts and CFU-f counts were analyzed 
using a nonparametric Spearman’s correlation as the 
TNC counts were not normally distributed. Correlations 
between patient age and CFU-f counts were analyzed 
 Page 4 of 10
Scarpone et al. J Transl Med           (2019) 17:10 
using Pearson’s correlation as both age and CFU-f counts 
were normally distributed. Linear regression was per-
formed on each of the two sets of data.
Results
MC system vs. centrifugation comparison #1
The MC system was compared in five patients with Har-
vest processed BMACs obtained from the contralat-
eral iliac crest (Table 1). Three separate punctures were 
made to aspirate the marrow used for the centrifuga-
tion process while only one puncture site was used for 
the MC system. The mean TNC count for the MC sys-
tem was 31.5 ± 15.5 million/mL vs. 66.1 ± 20.5 million/
mL for a traditional needle aspirate (three punctures) 
followed by processing using the Harvest centrifuge-
based system (p = 0.0001). Likewise, the mean CD34+ 
count for the MC system was 71.2 ± 49.0 × 103/mL vs. 
254 ± 122 × 103/mL for the Harvest system (p = 0.0034). 
Finally, the mean CFU-f count for the MC system was 
1583 ± 858/mL vs. 796.6 ± 508.5/mL for the Harvest sys-
tem (p = 0.0346). For all three measurements, the values 
were significantly different with the Harvest system hav-
ing significantly elevated TNC and CD34+ counts and 
the MC system having significantly higher CFU-f counts.
MC system vs. centrifugation comparison #2
Harvest processed BMACs and MC system prepared 
aspirates were also compared in a second group of 
patients (n = 5) with the aspirations being drawn by a dif-
ferent clinician (Table 2) but in this case only one punc-
ture was made to aspirate the marrow used for BMAC 
processing. The mean TNC count for the MC system, 
24.2 ± 11.6 million/mL, was significantly lower than 
the value found with the Harvest processed BMAC sys-
tem, 39.7 ± 17.2 million/mL (p = 0.0454). The mean 
CD34+ count for the MC system in this comparison was 
257 ± 115 × 103/mL vs. 217 ± 143 × 103/mL for the Har-
vest system, a difference that did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (p = 0.1378). CFU-f counts were not performed 
on these samples, however, the level of CD117+ cells 
was examined in this comparison. The average CD117+ 
count for the MC system was 272 ± 141 × 103/mL vs. 
180 ± 164 × 103/mL for the Harvest system, a difference 
that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0530).
In addition to testing the two systems in this com-
parison, analysis was also performed on a sample of the 
traditional needle aspirate before it was processed using 
the Harvest system. When the traditional needle aspi-
rate prior to centrifugation was compared with the MC

system, the TNC counts (12.56 ± 2.6 million/mL vs. 
24.2 ± 11.6 million/mL), the CD34+ counts (68.8 ± 30.7 
 
103/mL vs. 257 ± 115  
103/mL), and the CD117+ counts 
(65.0 ± 44.0  
103/mL vs. 272 ± 141  
103/mL) were all signif-
icantly reduced as compared to the MC system. Finally, 
the CD34+ counts were highly correlated with the 
CD117+ counts in both the MC system (Pearson’s corre-
lation coefficient = 0.894; p = 0.041), and the Harvest sys-
tem (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.966; p = 0.007).
MC system vs. centrifugation comparison #3
In the final comparison, a second BMAC centrifuga-
tion system was compared with the MC system. In this 
case, the MC system was compared in three patients 
with EmCyte processed BMACs obtained from the con-
tralateral iliac crest (Table 3). The mean TNC count for 
the MC system was 36.7 ± 17.7 million/mL vs. 60.5 ± 53.8 
million/mL for the traditional needle aspirate followed 
by processing with the EmCyte centrifuge-based sys-
tem (p = 0.1888). The mean CD34+ count for the MC 
system was 237 ± 88 × 103/mL vs. 146 ± 33 × 103/mL 
for the EmCyte system (p = 0.0806). Likewise, the mean 
CFU-f count for the MC system was 2263 ± 1667/mL vs. 
267 ± 76.4/mL for the EmCyte system (p = 0.0437). While 
the mean values showed considerable differences for all 
three comparisons between the MC and EmCyte sys-
tems, the difference was only significant in the case of the 
elevated CFU-f levels found in the MC system prepara-
tion (p < 0.05).
TNC and CFU-f levels in a case series of 30 MC system 
aspirates
A series of 30 bone marrow aspirates harvested using the 
MC system were analyzed for TNC and CFU-f levels. The 
TNC counts for these aspirates ranged from 10.1 to 57.2 
million TNCs/mL with a single statistical outlier having 
a 90.0 million TNCs/mL count (Table 4). The mean and 
standard deviation for the TNC count was 35.2 million 
TNCs/mL ± 17.13 million (Fig. 1a). The median TNCs/
mL value was 36.0 million. While the range of TNC 
counts for women was shifted lower (10.1–38.2 million) 
than the range for men (13.6–57.2 million), no statisti-
cal difference could be inferred due to the low number 
of women [4] included in the study. The CFU-f counts 
for the 30 samples ranged from 300 to 7300 CFU-fs/
mL (Table 4). The mean and standard deviation for the 
CFU-f count were 2885 CFU-fs/mL ± 1717 (Fig. 1b) with 
a median value of 2500. The average number of CFU-fs 
per million nucleated cells was 99.8 ± 123.5. There was 
significant variation in the samples as values ranged from 
11.4 to 722.8
Of the four individuals who had CFU-f counts below 
1000/mL, two had significant co-morbidities (diabe-
tes, obesity, RA, and gout). The other two had no co-
morbidities, nor were they outliers based on age as both 
were within one standard deviation of mean age of the 
population tested. Of the seven individuals with CFU-f 
counts above 4000/mL, four had no co-morbidities. Of 
the three that exhibited co-morbidities, one had ulcers, 
another hypertension and GERD while the most com-
plex case had hypertension, GERD, gout and obesity 
(Table 4). Thirteen of the 30 individuals included in the 
study had no co-morbidities. These individuals had an 
average CFU-f count of 3118/mL ± 2115 while those with 
co- morbidities had an average count that was not signifi-
cantly different, 2705/mL ± 1381.
Age and TNC correlations with CFU-f levels in MC system 
aspirates
We examined whether a correlation existed between 
the TNC counts and the CFU-f counts in the MC sys-
tem aspirates. Figure 2a shows the CFU-f count for each 
sample plotted against the TNC count. The Spearman’s 
correlation coefficient for the data is 0.48837 indicating 
a weak positive correlation between the two values that 
was significant (p = 0.0062). If the two-outlier points are 
removed (patients 7 and 28), an even stronger positive 
association is seen as the Spearman’s correlation coeffi-
cient is 0.6263 (p = 0.0004). Given the reduction in regen-
erative ability that occurs with age, we examined whether

a decrease in CFU-f counts in bone marrow aspirate was 
associated with the age of the patient. Figure 2b shows 
the CFU-f count for each sample plotted against the age 
of the patient. The data show a weak negative correlation 
between age and CFU-f number with a Pearson’s corre-
lation coefficient of − 0.4689 (p = 0.009), indicating that 
older patients tend toward lower CFU-f counts.
Discussion
BMA and BMACs, which contain a complex mix of 
nucleated cells, platelets and growth factors, are known 
to aid in the healing of a variety of orthopedic injuries and 
to promote angiogenesis in ischemic tissue [2, 19–22]. 
While BMA and BMACs show significant promise in the 
clinic, it is important to validate individual bone marrow

preparations given the numerous methods for aspirat-
ing and concentrating bone marrow currently in use [11] 
as well as the different locations of stem cells within the 
marrow space [13, 14]. This is particularly important 
given that aspirates with higher levels of CFU-f cells and/
or CD34+ cells have been shown in a variety of studies to 
correlate with improved patient outcomes [1–4, 21].
Given the association between higher levels of stem/
progenitor cells and positive patient outcomes, verifying 
that BMAs and BMACs contain sufficient numbers of 
these cells is of clinical relevance. In this study, we found 
that the MC system which employs the SSLM method, 
produces ~ 10 mL aspirate with high concentrations of 
CFU-fs and/or CD34+ cells. Most traditional needle 
aspirates are sourced from a cannula with an open distal 
end without a mechanical means to precisely reposition 
the cannula. These traditional needle techniques nor-
mally produce aspirates that contain between 200 and 
300 CFU-f/mL [11]. In the three direct comparisons with 
three different clinicians and two different centrifuge sys-
tems, the MC system had significantly higher amounts 
of CFU-fs and tended toward similar or higher num-
bers of CD34+ and CD117+ cells as compared to cen-
trifugation systems (Tables 1, 2, 3). The only exception 
was the significantly higher levels of CD34+ cells in the 
first comparison where the BMAC draw was performed 
using smaller aspirations at three different insertion sites, 
as opposed to a single large aspiration at only one inser-
tion site as performed in the other two comparisons. 
Despite the elevated CD34+ cells in this BMAC, the MC 
system aspirate still had significantly higher CFU-f lev-
els. Interestingly, the smaller volume aspirations done 
at the three different insertion sites for the BMAC draw 
seemed to preferentially increase the number of CD34+ 
cells without a corresponding increase in CFU-f levels. 
Previous studies have shown while the CFU-fs are pre-
dominately found in the CD34+ population, only a small 
fraction of CD34+ cells are capable of forming CFU-fs so 
the levels may not always correlate [23].
There is increasing evidence that different MSC pop-
ulations are found in unique niches within the bone. 
MSC populations have been identified within the corti-
cal bone space and trabecular bone cavities [12, 24], as 
well as within endosteal and perivascular niches within 
the marrow space [13, 25]. It is possible that different 
aspiration techniques can preferentially target these sub-
populations. The BMAC aspirates were done using an 
aspiration needle with an open-ended cannula that has 
five side ports but that draws preferentially through the 
largest distal open end that is oriented toward the center 
of the bone space. In contrast, the MC system draws only 
from the sides and not the center as the distal opening is 
closed. Given these differences, the endosteal population 
near the inner cortical bone space [13], located adjacent 
to the side ports in the MC system, may be preferentially 
targeted with the SSLM method. As a result, while mul-
tiple small incisions/draws using a traditional needle may 
increase the CD34+ count, this technique may target a 
cell population from the inner marrow space that is not 
as rich in CFU-f forming cells. Our data supports the 
hypothesis that a different cell population richer in MSCs 
may reside along the endosteal niche near the cortical 
surface of the bone, a population that can be preferen-
tially targeted based upon the aspiration method.
High concentrations of CFU-fs were found utiliz-
ing the MC system by two different clinicians using the 
analysis of two different independent laboratories. In the 
case series, the MC system produced 10 mL aspirates

that had an average of 2885 CFU-f/mL. The total num-
ber of CFU-fs found in the MC system aspirates, roughly 
28,000, represents a level of progenitor/stem cells that 
is in line with concentrations from other studies that 
have shown therapeutic success in reducing disc pain 
[26], treating hip osteonecrosis [27] and ameliorating 
cartilage defects [1]. In addition, the number of CFU-fs/
mL found here in the case series was greater or similar 
than those reported previously for centrifuge-based final 
products [11, 21].
Overall, the data presented here challenges the ration-
ale for aspirating large volumes of bone marrow and then 
volume reducing through centrifugation. While cen-
trifugation systems allow for higher TNC levels as seen 
here, they did not in general produce BMACs with higher 
CFU-f, CD34+ or CD117+ concentrations than the MC 
system. The CFU-f/mL yields in the BMACs tested here 
are at the low end of the range as compared with previ-
ous BMAC studies that found CFU-f/mL yields in the 
500–3000 range [11, 16, 21, 26, 28]. The high end of this 
range is similar to what was found here with the MC 
system case series. Based upon the CFU-f, CD34+ and 
CD117+ levels, the comparison data suggest that higher 
concentrations of HSCs and MSCs are found following 
the SSLM method [29].
There are several likely explanations for the high lev-
els of stem/progenitor cells harvested with the SSLM 
method. First, the MC system automatically repositions 
the aspiration cannula allowing it to mimic multiple 
puncture sites each with small 1 mL aspirations. Previ-
ous studies have shown that large volume aspirates (more 
than 2 mL) from a single site using traditional needles 
tend to be infiltrated by significant amounts of periph-
eral blood, which contains very few MSCs and HSCs 
and leads to lower CFU-f and CD34+ cell counts [9, 10]. 
This is particularly important in diabetic, atheroscle-
rotic and elderly patients in which the amount of MSC 
and HSC is significantly reduced [30–32]. Secondly, the 
MC system aspirates from side ports, thereby (1) pulling 
in fluid from across a greater geography of the marrow 
space and (2) targeting the endosteal niche closest to the 
inner cortical plate, a region known to be rich in stem 
cells [13, 25]. While enzymatic digestion is necessary to 
fully harvest MSCs from this site, aspiration of marrow 
from this region appears to yield more MSCs than mar-
row harvested from traditional needle systems. Finally, 
the inefficiencies of the centrifugation process can leave 
significant numbers of stem/progenitor cells behind in 
the discarded portion of the processed marrow. Studies 
have shown that many MSCs are present as aggregates in 
bone marrow aspirates, aggregates that can be removed 
by the filtering and centrifugation steps associated with 
BMAC preps [33, 34].
In addition, very small embryonic-like stem cells 
(VSELs), which are found in BM and can contribute to 
tissue regeneration, are lost during common centrifuga-
tion protocols due to their high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio 
[35, 36]. Given the variety of cells in the bone marrow 
that can aid in tissue regeneration (HSCs, MSCs, VSELs) 
[33, 37, 38] and the fact that significant amounts of these 
cells can be lost in the centrifugation process, the ability 
to avoid centrifugation can be a significant benefit in pre-
paring a robust biologic.
In order to better characterize the aspirates generated 
by the MC system, we examined the correlation between 
TNC and CFU-f counts obtained from MC system aspi-
rates. It was found that the two values did show a small 
but highly significant correlation with higher TNC val-
ues associated with higher CFU-f counts. Previous stud-
ies using BMAC have found a similar correlation [28]. 
In addition, we found a small but significant correlation 
between age and CFU-f counts using this process, with 
aspirates from older individuals correlating with lower 
CFU-f yields. These results are in general agreement with 
previous research [39].
While the data presented here demonstrates that fol-
lowing the SSLM method produces an aspirate that con-
tains high CFU-f and CD34+ levels, there are limitations 
associated with the study. First, while suitable for a pilot 
study, the sample size for each of the three comparison 
studies was small. Second, the different methodologies at 
the three labs were not standardized. However, the fact 
that CFU-f values were comparable between the two 
labs that tested CFU-fs suggests that the differences in 
protocols did not substantially affect the outcome of the 
study. Despite this, future studies should include a larger 
sample of side-by-side comparisons with standard labo-
ratory protocols in place. Given the possibility that dif-
ferent aspiration techniques can preferentially target 
different bone marrow niches, further studies investi-
gating the geographical location of different cell types 
within the marrow space and the influence of different 
aspiration protocols on selecting these cells is warranted. 
Finally, given that higher numbers of MSCs as measured 
by CFU-fs have been associated with positive treatment 
outcomes, future studies should include follow-up on 
patients treated with these aspirates.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that bone marrow samples con-
taining relatively high CFU-fs/mL and CD34+/mL can 
be obtained without the need for centrifugation using 
the MC system. In side by side comparisons with BMACs 
procured from the same patients using the contralateral 
iliac crest, the level of CFU-fs/mL was significantly higher 
in the MC system. In addition, MC system aspirates had 
 Page 9 of 10
Scarpone et al. J Transl Med           (2019) 17:10 
similar numbers of CD34+ and CD117+ cells as com-
pared to centrifugation systems. Finally, the CFU-f/mL 
levels obtained using the MC system were positively cor-
related with the TNC count and negatively correlated 
with the age of the patient. As a result, knowing the TNC 
count and age of the patient can provide some informa-
tion regarding the potential quality of the bone marrow 
aspirate obtained using the MC system.
