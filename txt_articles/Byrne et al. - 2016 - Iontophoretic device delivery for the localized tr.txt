Poor delivery and systemic toxicity of many cytotoxic agents, such
as the recent promising combination chemotherapy regimen of
folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin
(FOLFIRINOX), restrict their full utility in the treatment of pancre-
atic cancer. Local delivery of chemotherapies has become possible
using iontophoretic devices that are implanted directly onto
pancreatic tumors. We have fabricated implantable iontophoretic
devices and tested the local iontophoretic delivery of FOLFIRINOX
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in an orthotopic patient-
derived xenograft model. Iontophoretic delivery of FOLFIRINOX
was found to increase tumor exposure by almost an order of magni-
tude compared with i.v. delivery with substantially lower plasma
concentrations. Mice treated for 7 wk with device FOLFIRINOX
experienced significantly greater tumor growth inhibition com-
pared with i.v. FOLFIRINOX. A marker of cell proliferation, Ki-67,
was stained, showing a significant reduction in tumor cell prolif-
eration. These data capitalize on the unique ability of an implant-
able iontophoretic device to deliver much higher concentrations of
drug to the tumor compared with i.v. delivery. Local iontophoretic
delivery of cytotoxic agents should be considered for the treat-
ment of patients with unresectable nonmetastatic disease and
for patients with the need for palliation of local symptoms, and
may be considered as a neoadjuvant approach to improve resec-
tion rates and outcome in patients with localized and locally ad-
vanced pancreatic cancer.

P
ancreatic cancer is among the most lethal malignancies be-
cause of its insidious onset and resistance to therapy. The
overall 5-y survival rate for this disease is less than 5%, and es-
timates indicate that pancreatic cancer will be second only to
non-small-cell lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in the United States by 2030 (1–2). Surgical resection is
the only curative option, with 15% of patients having resectable
disease at presentation. Complete resection of all gross and
microscopic disease results in a median survival time of 22–23
mo (3, 4). However, nearly 40% of patients with pancreatic
cancer have locally advanced, unresectable disease with a me-
dian overall survival time of 9.2–13.5 mo (5). Although the true
effect of microscopic positive margins is not fully known, patients
destined to have the longest survival are those for whom re-
section with curative intent is feasible (6).
The efficacy of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer is im-
paired by a unique desmoplastic response (7, 8). Pancreatic tu-
mors have a dense desmoplastic stroma with fibrotic connective
tissue that surrounds the tumor and may account for >80% of
tumor volume (9). This leads to a microenvironment with low
blood perfusion and hypoxia, serving as a barrier to diminish the
delivery of anticancer drugs (10, 11). A local drug delivery device
capable of overcoming this barrier could provide substantial
benefit for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
We have developed an implantable iontophoretic device ca-
pable of driving chemotherapies deep into solid tumors. The
principle behind iontophoretic drug delivery is the movement of
charged species under an applied electric field (12, 13). Ionto-
phoresis has been previously evaluated for oncologic purposes
(13–15). An iontophoretic Foley catheter was developed to de-
liver mitomycin C to bladder tumors. Significant clinical success
was achieved using the treatment alone and in combination with
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy (15). In addition, Gratieri
et al. explored the iontophoretic delivery of 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin in healthy pig buccal tissue for the treatment of head
and neck cancer (14).
One major benefit of this technology is the ability to deliver
highly toxic agents limited by unwanted secondary effects.
FOLFIRINOX, a promising mixture of cytotoxic agents including
folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin,
has limited use in many patients because of its high systemic
toxicity (16, 17). Modified FOLFIRINOX regimens have been
created to improve tolerability (5, 18). Given the ability of the
iontophoretic device to deliver drugs locally with minimal sys-
temic exposure, the iontophoretic delivery of FOLFIRINOX
Significance
Drug delivery to pancreatic tumors is impaired by a unique
desmoplastic response and poor tumor vascularization. A drug
delivery device capable of overcoming these barriers could
provide substantial benefit for patients with pancreatic cancer.
In this study, we show that local iontophoretic delivery of
folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin
(FOLFIRINOX) resulted in better tumor response and tolerability
compared with i.v. FOLFIRINOX. Given the low systemic expo-
sure of FOLFIRINOX using iontophoretic delivery, it may be
possible to use in combination with systemic delivery to treat
micrometastatic disease. Local iontophoretic delivery of cyto-
toxic agents should be considered as a neoadjuvant approach
to improve resection rates and outcome in patients with lo-
calized and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

 could further enhance the efficacy of this cytotoxic regimen by
increasing the local drug concentration and decreasing systemic
exposure. The aim of our study was to evaluate the iontophoretic
delivery of FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of localized pan-
creatic cancer. We evaluated this therapy in xenografts derived
from patients with pancreatic cancer, which have been shown to
reflect recently defined RNA tumor subtypes in patients, mirror
patient outcome, and be highly predictive of clinical response to
many targeted agents (19, 20). We report the delivery of high
levels of the FOLFIRINOX drugs to the tumor, a reduction in
systemic exposure of the drugs, and potent tumor regression.
This therapy has the potential to improve the resection rates and
the outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.
Results
Implantable Iontophoretic Device. The device was designed for
intra-abdominal implantation with external access for power and
drug supply (Fig. 1 A and B). A platinum electrode was encased
in a polyurethane reservoir covered by a semipermeable mem-
brane, and a multiluminal polyurethane tube connecting the
implanted reservoir to the external environment allowed for
electrical contact, as well as continuous drug flow into and out of
the device. Using this drug flow design, a constant drug con-
centration was maintained around the electrode and device–tis-
sue interface. Once an electric potential was applied with the
device on the tumor, the drugs were actively transported into
the tissue.
Iontophoretic Drug Delivery Testing in ex Vivo Tumors. Drug transport
studies were conducted using ex vivo pancreatic cancer patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. To test the transport of
FOLFIRINOX in the ex vivo PDX tumors, the devices were sutured
onto the tumors (Fig. 1 A and B), and the counter electrode was
placed on the contralateral side of the tumor. Two or 0 mA of
current was applied for two 10-min periods, with a washout pe-
riod between treatments, and the tumors were subsequently
analyzed for the concentrations of the three major cytotoxic
drugs in the FOLFIRINOX regimen: 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan,
and oxaliplatin. The application of 2 mA constant current resulted
in a 5.1-fold increase in oxaliplatin transport (P = 0.024), a 10.8-fold
increase in 5-fluorouracil transport (P = 0.018), and a 5.4-fold in-
crease in irinotecan transport (P = 0.015) into the tumor compared
with the passive diffusion control (0 mA) (Fig. 1C).
Pharmacokinetics of Cytotoxic Drugs in Mice. Iontophoretic delivery
of the FOLFIRINOX drugs was further characterized with re-
spect to pharmacokinetics (PK), as previously described (12).
Briefly, devices were surgically implanted when the tumor reached
a median size of 312 mm3 (range, 180–467 mm3). One week after
device implantation, a single treatment was administered, tumors
were harvested at designated times, and drugs were quantified by
tissue (Fig. 2). FOLFIRINOX i.v. dosing was adjusted from
clinical dosage in accordance with prior maximum tolerated dose
studies (21–23).
The organ exposure to the FOLFIRINOX drugs, as measured
by the area under the curve for device versus i.v. delivery, can be
found in Table 1. FOLFIRINOX tumor area under the curve for
iontophoretic delivery was considerably greater than for i.v. de-
livery (228.5 vs. 25.4 h*μg/g for 5-fluorouracil, 67.9 vs. 5.5 h*μg/g
for oxaliplatin, and 177.75 vs. 30.55 h*μg/g for irinotecan,
respectively). The average tumor penetration distances for
FOLFIRINOX were not able to be quantified because of the amount
of tissue required for measurement of the three cytotoxic drugs.
The iontophoretic device delivery of FOLFIRINOX resulted in

 substantially lower plasma concentrations: a 141.5-fold reduction in
5-fluorouracil concentration, 47.5-fold reduction in oxaliplatin con-
centration, and 1,340.7-fold reduction in irinotecan concentration
compared with i.v. delivery. There was greater exposure of the
FOLFIRINOX drugs to the pancreas, kidney, and liver after i.v.
delivery compared with device delivery (Table 1).
Fig. 2.
PK of FOLFIRINOX delivered by device compared with i.v. was evaluated in an orthotopic PDX model of pancreatic cancer. Mice were administered a single
treatment of FOLFIRINOX through the device. Organs were collected from each animal at various times, and total drug concentrations were analyzed. Data are
means ± SD (n = 3–4 animals per group). Limit of quantitation for oxaliplatin was 1 ng/mL; limits of quantitation for irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil were 30 ng/mL.

 Device Delivery of FOLFIRNOX Promotes Tumor Regression. To
evaluate the antitumor activity of FOLFIRINOX delivered by
the iontophoretic devices, we performed efficacy studies in the
same orthotopic PDX model of pancreatic cancer used in the PK
studies. Devices were surgically implanted onto orthotopic pan-
creatic tumors when their size reached a median of 260 mm3
(range, 117–433 mm3). Mice were treated once per week for 7 wk
with device FOLFIRINOX, i.v. FOLFIRINOX, device saline
(0.9% NaCl), or i.v. saline. Tumor volumes were measured only
after completion of the treatment, as implanted devices impaired
ultrasound imaging.
Device FOLFIRINOX resulted in tumor regression in three of
six mice and stable disease in another mouse, outperforming i.v.
FOLFIRINOX and the control groups of i.v. and device saline
during the 7-wk period of the study (Fig. 3A). Mice treated with
device FOLFIRINOX had a mean log2-fold change in tumor
volume of 0.4 compared with a mean log2-fold change in tumor
volume of 1.9 for i.v. FOLFIRINOX (P = 0.0092), 3.0 for i.v.
saline (P = 0.0002), and 2.6 for device saline (P = 0.0011) groups.
No difference in tumor volume was seen in mice treated with
device saline compared with i.v. saline.
Device Delivery of FOLFIRNOX Inhibits Cancer Cell Proliferation. Tu-
mors from mice treated with device FOLFIRINOX for 7 wk
showed a significant decrease in Ki-67, a marker of cell prolif-
eration, compared with tumors from mice that received i.v.
FOLFIRINOX (P = 0.01) (Fig. 3 B and C). No difference in Ki-67
was seen between device saline-treated and i.v. saline-treated
tumors. Of note, Ki-67 staining of tumors from the two nonre-
sponders treated with device FOLFIRINOX resulted in H-scores
(62.3 and 57.3) that were closer to the average i.v. FOLFIRINOX
H-score (70.1 ± 6.8) than the average device FOLFIRINOX
H-score (36.6 ± 18.6).
Device Delivery of FOLFIRNOX Does Not Cause Obvious Evidence of
Tissue Toxicity. No difference in alanine transaminase, aspartate
transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and lipase levels was noted
for the different delivery routes (Fig. 4A). Mice treated with
device FOLFIRINOX showed better or at least equivalent treat-
ment tolerance based on a greater body weight gain compared
with i.v. FOLFIRINOX (Fig. 4B).
Discussion
Here, we show that iontophoretic delivery of FOLFIRINOX
substantially increases intratumoral drug concentrations while
limiting systemic exposure. The iontophoretic delivery of
FOLFIRINOX resulted in better tumor response and tolerability,
as defined by body weight gain, compared with i.v. FOLFIRINOX.
Pancreatic PDX models such as the one used in this study have
been shown to be highly predictive of relapse after surgery, re-
flective of patient outcome, genetics, and RNA tumor subtypes
(19, 20, 24). These results suggest that the iontophoretic delivery
of FOLFIRINOX may translate to improved clinical outcomes by
enhancing the therapeutic index of this drug mixture, allowing
for resection of localized and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
As the role of chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being ques-
tioned for use in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, there is a
need for new treatments to improve resection rates (25, 26). Our
device has the ability to overcome the “wall-like” barrier of
pancreatic tumors and improve responses to neoadjuvant che-
motherapy. The iontophoretic device is able to increase intra-
tumoral drug concentrations well above current i.v. administration
while maintaining low systemic exposure. Through better delivery of
an agent that has shown promise, we may not only increase the
number of patients who may be resectable but also improve overall
rates of margin-negative resections, and thus improve long-term
patient outcomes. With concern for early micrometastatic disease,
the low plasma exposure of the device delivery of FOLFIRINOX

 allows for concomitant device and potentially full-dose systemic
administration of additional agents.
We hypothesize that the two nonresponders treated with device
FOLFIRINOX may be the result of inadequate drug delivery
secondary to device placement or damage. Further device design
revisions may be warranted to improve the functionality and du-
rability of the device. Furthermore, the efficacy of the device
FOLFIRINOX treatment may be further improved by modifying
the dosing schedule and optimizing the FOLFIRINOX formu-
lations. Because of the low level of systemic exposure after a
single treatment, the frequency of device FOLFIRINOX treat-
ments may be increased to more than once weekly. Combining
the drugs into the same solution may affect the overall mobility
of each drug within the system, and further optimization of the
formulation is warranted to improve the delivery (13). In addi-
tion, seeing that irinotecan is the water-soluble prodrug of
SN-38, it may be beneficial to deliver SN-38 or a more active
form of irinotecan (27).
Looking beyond pancreatic cancer, this iontophoretic delivery
of FOLFIRINOX may be applied to a variety of other cancers,
including sarcomas, gastroesophageal, head and neck, and re-
current rectal cancers. The minimization of systemic exposure by
iontophoresis will allow more patients to tolerate therapy and
will allow new systemic regimens to be evaluated in combination
with iontophoresis. This device treatment has tremendous po-
tential to improve surgical outcomes in challenging cancers.
Methods
Study Design. Device fabrication and tumor implantation into the pancreas
followed previously published methods (12). The ex vivo work was per-
formed to evaluate the transport of the FOLFIRINOX drugs into tumor tissue
under an applied electric potential. The three major cytotoxic drugs of the
FOLFIRINOX regimen, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, were eval-
uated for drug transport and PK analysis. For PK and efficacy studies, PDX
mice with pancreatic tumors were randomly assigned into the experimental
and control groups. The study endpoint for efficacy was an interval of 7 wk.
For histological analysis, tumors were annotated and the number of posi-
tively stained cells according to stain intensity was quantified. H-scores for
the Ki-67 stains were calculated from the stain intensity and percentage
stain positivity by the formula 3 × percentage of strongly staining nuclei +
2 × percentage of moderately staining nuclei + percentage of weakly
staining nuclei, giving a range of 0–300. The H-score is an established
method of assessing the extent of nuclear immunoreactivity (12, 28). No
outlying data points were excluded in the studies.
Device Fabrication. A 5-mm platinum (Strem Chemicals) disk was soldered to a
stainless steel cable wire and embedded in a polyurethane (Hapco Steralloy
2056) reservoir. The polyurethane was allowed to crosslink for at least 2 h at
60 °C after use. The steel wire was then threaded through custom-made
multiluminal tubing, and the tubing/reservoir interface was encased in heat-
shrink tubing with extra polyurethane to secure the tubing. A semiperme-
able 14K cellulose membrane (Fisher Scientific) was adhered to the reservoir
for enclosure using polyurethane.
Drug Formulations. The drugs were combined into two separate solutions:
50 mg of leucovorin dissolved with a 5 mg/mL oxaliplatin solution to final
concentrations of 10 mg/mL leucovorin and 5 mg/mL oxaliplatin at a final pH
of 5.5, and 10 mg/mL irinotecan solution added to 50 mg/mL 5-fluorouracil
solution to create a final concentration of 14.4 mg/mL irinotecan and 14.0 mg/mL
5-fluorouracil at a pH of 6.0, using hydrochloric acid to limit conversion of
irinotecan to its inactive form (29).
For i.v. delivery of FOLFIRINOX, the drugs were delivered via tail vein
injection and dosed at 100 mg/kg leucovorin, 5 mg/kg oxaliplatin, 50 mg/kg
5-fluorouracil, and 50 mg/kg irinotecan.
Animal Studies. All studies involving animals were approved by the appropriate
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before initiation. All animals used
in PK and efficacy studies were allowed to acclimate for at least 1 wk in the
animal facilities before experimentation. Animals were exposed to a 12-h
light/dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum through the studies.
Ex Vivo Studies. De-identified tumors from patients with pancreatic cancer
were grafted and passaged in athymic nude mice, as described previously
(12). After pancreatic (orthotopic) implantation, tumor volumes were
tracked by weekly abdominal ultrasound imaging. Upon reaching ∼400 mm3
(range, 323–484 mm3), the PDX tumors were directly removed and placed
into Petri dishes filled with 10 mL saline. Devices were sutured directly onto
the tumor, using 6–0 prolene, followed by either no current (control) or
2 mA of current for 10 min with each drug solution and a 5-min drug washout
period with saline between drug solutions. The drug solutions were flowed
at 50 μL/min through the device. After treatment, the tumors were snap
frozen, using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C before drug extraction
and quantification. Drug quantification by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS
and inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS followed previously published
methods (30–32).
PK Studies. Devices were surgically implanted onto the pancreatic tumors
when they reached a median volume of 312 mm3 (range, 180–467 mm3).
Treatment was started 1 wk postimplantation to allow for epithelialization
around the device. A constant DC power supply was used to provide the
electric potential gradient. The positive lead was connected to the device
wire, and the negative lead was connected to a silver chloride electrode

 placed on the mouse’s skin with electrolyte gel. The device treatments were
identical to the ex vivo studies. When the constant voltage was applied, drug
was driven from the device reservoir into the tumor tissue. Upon completion
of the treatment, the device was emptied of drug solution. Terminal bleeds
and organs were removed at their designated times. The tissues were snap
frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C before drug extraction
and quantification.
Efficacy Studies. The technical protocols for surgical implantation of the
device and device treatments were identical to the ex vivo and PK studies.
Devices were surgically implanted onto orthotopic pancreatic tumors when
their size reached a median size of 260 mm3 (range, 117–433 mm3). Mice
were treated once weekly for 7 wk, using device FOLFIRINOX or i.v.
FOLFIRNOX. Data for mice treated with device saline (0.9% NaCl) and i.v.
saline for 7 wk were derived from our previous study (12). Ultrasound imaging
was not used during the treatment interval because of device interference
with tumor volume quantification. After completion of the treatments, mice
were killed, and the tumors were extracted. The tumor volumes were
quantified by volume displacement, for which there was good correlation
between ultrasound imaging and volume displacement (R2 = 0.83).
PK and Statistical Analyses. Data are expressed as means ± SD. The PKs of all
drugs in plasma and tissues were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis
using WinNonlin Professional Edition version 6.2 (Pharsight Corp.). Unpaired
t tests were used to make comparisons of continuous values between
groups. Unadjusted P values are reported for pairwise comparisons when an
overall difference was detected.
