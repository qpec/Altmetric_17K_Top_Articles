Abstract
In this prospective study of upper middle class youth, we document frequency of alcohol and drug use, as well as diagnoses of abuse and dependence, during
early adulthood. Two cohorts were assessed as high school seniors and then annually across 4 college years (New England Study of Suburban Youth
younger cohort [NESSY-Y]), and across ages 23–27 (NESSY older cohort [NESSY-O]; ns ¼ 152 and 183 at final assessments, respectively). Across gender
and annual assessments, results showed substantial elevations, relative to norms, for frequency of drunkenness and using marijuana, stimulants, and
cocaine. Of more concern were psychiatric diagnoses of alcohol/drug dependence: among women and men, respectively, lifetime rates ranged between
19%–24% and 23%–40% among NESSY-Os at age 26; and 11%–16% and 19%–27% among NESSY-Ys at 22. Relative to norms, these rates among
NESSY-O women and men were three and two times as high, respectively, and among NESSY-Y, close to one among women but twice as high among men.
Findings also showed the protective power of parents’ containment (anticipated stringency of repercussions for substance use) at age 18; this was
inversely associated with frequency of drunkenness and marijuana and stimulant use in adulthood. Results emphasize the need to take seriously the elevated
rates of substance documented among adolescents in affluent American school communities.
The United States continues to experience an epidemic of drug over-
dose deaths. From 2000 to 2015 more than half a million people died
from drug overdoses, the majority (55% of these deaths) occurring
from 2009 to 2015 . . . Large suburban metro counties went from
having the lowest to the highest rate of premature death due to drug
overdose within the past decade. Premature death due to drug over-
dose was highest among whites (778 years of potential life lost per
100,000). (Givens, Gennuso, Jovaag, & Van Dijk, 2017, p. 6)
Over the last two decades, studies have documented more
frequent drug and alcohol use among upper middle class
teens than their less well-off counterparts, but what remains
unclear is the degree to which this might eventuate in serious
problems of addiction. In this paper, we present adult data on
two cohorts from schools in predominantly affluent commu-
nities. Both cohorts were initially assessed as high school
seniors, with one subsequently assessed annually at ages
23–27, and the second across the 4 years of college at ages
19–22 years. For women and men separately, we document
frequency of using different substances and psychiatric
diagnoses of abuse as well as dependence, relative to national
normative data.
Substance Misuse Among Upper Middle Class Youth
In 2009, an editorial in the Journal of the American Academyof
Child & Adolescent Psychiatry declared affluent youth to be a
“newly identified at-risk group” (Koplewicz, Gurian, & Wil-
liams, 2009, p. 1053), and over time, studies have confirmed
that substance misuse is a problem of particular concern (Bot-
ticello, 2009; Luthar & Barkin, 2012; Luthar & D’Avanzo,
1999; Patrick, Wightman, Schoeni, & Schulenberg, 2012). Re-
searchers have documented high binge drinking and marijuana
use in neighborhoods with mostly well-educated, wealthy,
White families (Reboussin, Preisser, Song, & Wolfson, 2010;
Song et al., 2009). Similar patterns are seen in highly achieving
schools, which serve mostly affluent students (as home prices
typically rise with schools’ standardized test scores; Bui &
Dougherty, 2017). Studies have recurrently shown elevated
substance use levels, compared to national norms, among stu-
dents at high-achieving public and independent schools, in the
suburbs and cities, and across different parts of the country (for
a review, see Luthar, Barkin, & Crossman, 2013).
Consistent findings have been reported in analyses of
large, national data sets. In a nationally representative sample
of over 13,000 US youth, Coley, Sims, Dearing, and Spielvo-
gel (2017) found that attendance at schools with a high
proportion of affluent schoolmates was associated with
significantly higher likelihood of both intoxication and use
of illicit drugs (marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs).

 In similar analyses of data in Norway, Lund, Dearing, and Za-
chrisson (2017) established links between school-level afflu-
ence and students’ drinking to intoxication: boys and girls at
the most affluent schools were about two and half times more
likely to report such abuse of alcohol than those at the poorest
schools, mirroring prior findings in the United States (Luthar
& D’Avanzo, 1999; Lyman & Luthar, 2014).
Maturing Out?
Despite evidence of high substance use in affluent high
schools, little is known about the evolution of alcohol and
drug use after high school graduation. In contemporary times,
after the early or “emerging” adulthood years roughly span-
ning ages 18–25 (Arnett, 2007), youth tend to mature out
of deviant behaviors linked with adolescence including mis-
use of drugs and alcohol (Arnett, 2005). To illustrate, Schu-
lenberg and Zarrett (2006) showed that binge drinking and
marijuana use declined at approximately age 21 or 22, and
Jackson, Sher, Gotham, and Wood (2001) documented mat-
uration toward less severe drinking by the age of 24 years.
Youth in relatively affluent communities may not show
these patterns of maturing out for at least two reasons. First,
many in this demographic begin to use substances in preado-
lescence (Luthar & Barkin, 2012; Luthar & Goldstein, 2008),
and early substance use is a strong predictor of long-term con-
tinued use (Moss, Chen, & Yi, 2014). Longitudinal research
has shown that the incidence of adult alcohol dependence was
over 10% among those who started drinking (more than two
drinks per week) at age 13, as compared to 2% who started at
age 18 (Grant, Stinson, & Harford, 2001).
Second, almost all high school seniors in affluent settings go
on to attend college (e.g., Dreier, 2014; Pell Institute, 2015) and
among contemporary college students, mores in the peerculture
often actively support drinking and drug use (e.g., LaBrie,
Hummer, & Pedersen, 2007; O’Hara, Armeli, & Tennen,
2015). Across the college years, inebriation not only is norma-
tive at social gatherings but also is often desirable (Chase, 2008;
Marano, 2005), and studies have revealed binge-drinking rates
as high as 44% among undergraduates (Wechsler et al., 2002;
Wechsler & Nelson, 2008). Moreover, harmful drinking habits
have been found to be more pronounced in college students
from well-educated, affluent families, at least in part because
they have more disposable income while at the same time living
away from parent vigilance (Dantzer, Wardle, Fuller, Pampa-
lone, & Steptoe, 2006; Rose, Smith, & Segrist, 2010; see also
Carrick, 2016; Hussey & Schlossberg, 2015; Schiffman, 2011).
Whereas these trends may apply across all 4 years of college,
it is possible that there are at least modest reductions in sub-
stance use around the time of graduation. During the first or sec-
ond year of college, experimentation with alcohol and drugs
can be high given freedom from parental supervision (Turrisi,
Wiersma, & Hughes, 2000); some also drink or use drugs to
conform to a new peer group and to ease social anxiety (LaBrie
et al., 2007; O’Hara et al., 2015; Reifman & Watson, 2003; Tur-
risi et al., 2000). Closer to the time of graduation, however, it is
plausible that overall use levels are reduced given attention, for
example, to securing full-time employment (see Shulenberg &
Zarrett, 2006; Steinman, 2003; Turrisi et al., 2000).
Following college graduation, similarly, it is possible that
use levels may remain somewhat elevated in the first year or
so, and declines become apparent several years later as these
youth approach their late 20s (Chen & Jacobson, 2013). Stud-
ies have shown that even after the college years, drinking to get
drunk is common in social gatherings (Maggs & Schulenberg,
2004), and hard drugs such as cocaine are used as well (White,
Becker-Blease, & Grace-Bishop, 2006). Affiliation with devi-
ant peers, who routinely binge drink and use drugs, can there-
fore reinforce substance misuse among these young people
through the mid-20s (Andrews, Tildesley, Hops, & Li, 2002;
Mason & Spoth, 2011; Schulenberg & Zarrett, 2006). By the
later 20s, in contrast, substance use should, in theory, be re-
duced as a result of social role transitions, including full-
time employment and family formation roles such as long-
term, committed relationships (Bachman, Wadsworth, O’Mal-
ley, Johnston, & Schulenberg, 1997; Glatz, Stattin, & Kerr,
2012).
The New England Study of Suburban Youth (NESSY)
With a focus on youth who grew up in affluent suburbs, we
report on patterns of substance use across a period of 10 adult
years in a prospective, longitudinal design with two cohorts.
The first cohort was assessed from sixth grade through high
school (Luthar & Barkin, 2012), and here we present data
at Grade 12 and then across the 5 years after college grad-
uation, through the ages of 23 to 27 years. The second cohort
was first assessed in Grade 12 and then followed through their
4 years of college, across the ages of 18–22. In this report, we
refer to these two respective cohorts as NESSY older
(NESSY-O) and NESSY younger (NESSY-Y). Both schools
sampled were in communities with a high concentration of
well-educated, white-collar professionals, with median in-
comes in the top 5% of the country, from two different states
in the Northeastern United States.
Based on annual assessments in adulthood, we expected to
see elevated frequencies, compared to national norms, for at
least four use indices: drunkenness, and the use of marijuana,
stimulants such as Adderall or Ritalin, and cocaine. As noted
earlier, elevated alcohol and marijuana use have already been
documented among high school youth in affluent communities,
and past use is a good predictor of later use. Studies have in-
creasingly reported high misuse among college students of
stimulant drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall, both as study
aids and for recreational use, with reported rates as high as
20%–35%, and acquisition easy either from friends or through
black-market sales on college campuses (Gendaszek & Low,
2002; Moore, Burgard, Larson, & Ferm, 2014; Vrecko,
2015). Finally, cocaine is also more commonly used by young
adults from high socioeconomic status (SES) families than oth-
ers, whereas in general, use of cigarettes and other drugs (e.g.,
inhalants, methamphetamines, and heroin), are more used

non, Kollins, Prybol, & Fuemmeler, 2013).
Psychiatric Diagnoses: Does Frequent Use Imply
Impairment?
Percentages reporting some use of a substance per year do not
necessarily imply serious disorders; even if twice as many up-
per middle class youth report using a substance as their less
wealthy counterparts, this may not entail functional impair-
ment (see Uestuen & Kennedy, 2009). In this paper, there-
fore, we go beyond reporting on the percentages using
substances relative to national norms (per data from Monitor-
ing the Future; Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & Schulen-
berg, 2012). Here we also report on the proportions of the
sample that met criteria for psychiatric diagnoses, based on
structured interviews, of substance abuse and dependence.
Broadly speaking, diagnoses of abuse imply levels of use
that lead to failure to fulfill major role obligations, or prob-
lems with the law, without meeting criteria for dependence.
The latter is the more serious diagnosis, encompassing the
medical term for what is commonly referred to as alcoholism
or addiction, involving physical tolerance, craving, and with-
drawal symptoms when use is reduced.
For both NESSY-Y and NESSY-O, diagnoses were made
based on criteria in the DSM–IV (American Psychiatric As-
sociation, 1994), the version of the diagnostic manual current
at the time participants were enrolled in the study. Alongside,
we present national normative rates for individuals of the
same age using data from the National Comorbidity Study
Replication (NCS-R), a nationally representative survey
implemented between 2001 and 2003 with individuals 18
years and older, where rates of diagnoses were also based
on structured interviews (Kessler et al., 2004).
In this paper, we report on lifetime rates in the NESSY co-
horts using two sets of estimates. The first set is based on di-
agnostic interviews conducted at a single assessment time as
was done in the NCS-R. This was the last interview with each
cohort, at age 26 for NESSY-O (age 27 assessments encom-
passed the questionnaires but not interviews; see Methods)
and age 22 for NESSY-Y. The second set of rates is based
on lifetime diagnoses obtained cumulatively, across any of
the annual NESSY interviews conducted. Several studies
have established that single, cross-sectional assessments of
mental disorders underestimate true lifetime rates, given lim-
itations of retrospective recall across several years (Moffitt
et al., 2010; Olino et al., 2012; Takayanagi et al., 2014).
Thus, for both cohorts, we also present lifetime rates based
on all four annual assessments, such that a positive diagnosis
at any of these indicated a lifetime diagnosis.
Parent Containment
A final aim in this study was to examine the protective power of
adolescents’ perceived parents’ “containment” in relation to
long-term substance misuse. Containment represents views
of the seriousness of repercussions from parents if they were
to discover the youth’s use of drugs or alcohol. Cross-section-
ally and across multiple affluent school samples, low perceived
parent containment has been found to have robust links with
teenagers’ actual use, over and above conventionally examined
aspects of parents’ supervision or monitoring (Luthar & Bar-
kin, 2012). As this single construct explained much more var-
iance than other parent predictors, researchers have under-
scored the need for upper middle class parents to avoid
laxness when detecting teen substance use, in order to mitigate
high levels of misuse in the future (Luthar et al., 2013).
Whereas such cautions may be reasonable, there is only
limited evidence that high school parent containment has
any ramifications for youths’ substance use past the time
that they no longer live at home. In a prospective study of
339 high school students in the Southwest, parental contain-
ment and parent–child relationship quality were examined in
relation to alcohol use over the college transition (Hartman
et al., 2016). Again, given overlap between the constructs
of parental monitoring and containment, parental monitoring
was included as a covariate. Results showed that higher pa-
rental containment was associated with less alcohol use in
college, especially in the context of more positive, supportive
parent–child relationships, mirroring findings that authorita-
tive parenting is generally beneficial whereas authoritarian
parenting is not (Cohen & Rice, 1997; Hoffmann & Bahr,
2014; Visser, de Winter, Vollebergh, Verhulst, & Reijneveld,
2013). The authors concluded that the construct of contain-
ment can have “important implications for parental efforts
to reduce risk for alcohol use and related problems prior to
the important transition to college, during which rates of
heavy drinking and related problems often dramatically in-
crease” (Hartman et al., 2016).
In this study, therefore, we examined, using longitudinal
data, whether parents’ containment in high school might
have any prognostic significance for frequency of substance
use well into adulthood. In these prospective analyses (as in
prior cross-sectional work), we controlled for overall parental
monitoring in high school, toward illuminating links largely
specific to containment. Outcomes examined were frequen-
cies on three use indices: drunkenness, marijuana use, and
stimulants use. This choice was based on anticipated range of
scores, wherein enough individuals would likely report using
at least once, and some with high frequency scores, such that
floor effects (with mostly zeros) could be avoided. These three
indicators were considered, again, in the last year of adult as-
sessments. In addition, assuming these associations were iden-
tified, we sought to determine whether they might be mediated
by overall substance use during high school, while these young
people had still been living at home.
Summary
In this cross-lagged longitudinal study, the central goal was to
provide in-depth data on adult substance use among a popu-
lation recently identified as being “at risk,” that is, youth who

 grow up in relatively affluent communities. We document
levels of alcohol and drug use in two cohorts both assessed
as high school seniors, and then annually across 4 college
years (NESSY-Y), and across 5 years of young adulthood
from ages 23 to 27 years (NESSY-O). In comparison with na-
tional norms, we expected to see (a) high rates of drinking to
intoxication, and the use of marijuana, stimulants, and co-
caine; and (b) modest reductions in rates, relative to prior
use, by the senior year of college in NESSY-Y and by age
27 years in NESSY-O. A second goal was to compare rates
of lifetime diagnoses of abuse or dependence relative to na-
tional norms, at ages 22 and 26 for NESSY-Y and NESSY-
O,respectively. Finally, we sought toexaminewhether parental
containment of substance use in high school was related to fre-
quency of substance use several years later in adulthood, with
high school use as a potential mediator. All analyses were con-
ducted separately by gender, as prior work with affluent youth
has shown gender differences in specific areas of maladjust-
ment as well as in salient risk and protective processes (e.g.,
substance use shows robust links with high peer status among
males but not among females; Luthar et al., 2013).
Methods
Sample
Originally encompassing only one cohort of students in a rel-
atively affluent Northeastern suburb, this study evolved into a
two-cohort design. The first cohort, NESSY-O, was followed
annually from Grade 6 through freshman year of college
(eight assessments, between 1998 and 2005; see Luthar &
Barkin, 2012), and then again, after college graduation, be-
tween the ages of 23 and 27 (five assessments, between
2009 and 2013). Because data collection with NESSY-O
was unavoidably stopped between 2006 and 2009, the second
cohort (NESSY-Y) was recruited for this study to (a) capture
trends among suburban youth across the critical college years
of ages 19–22, and (b) potentially, to establish generalizabil-
ity of young adult findings across two sites.
This report is the first to present on any data past the high
school years on the NESSY-O cohort, and the first to present
any data at all on the NESSY-Y cohort. In high school assess-
ments of both samples, participation had been voluntary, and
71% and 70% of the graduating classes participated in the se-
nior year assessments (ns ¼ 255 and 272, respectively). Ap-
proximately half of the participants were female (48% and
54% in NESSY-O and NESSY-Y, respectively). Most stu-
dents were White (88% and 80%), and the majority of parents
had a college degree (83% and 90% for fathers and 83% and
88% for mothers in NESSY-O and NESSY-Y, respectively).
Median family incomes were well over three times the national
average in 2014 of $52,250, at $151,771 and $241,453 in the
two towns, and median home prices in 2015 were both over $1
million (United States Bureau of the Census, 2015).
With regard to retention, the number of participants as-
sessed at each wave is shown for both cohorts in Table 1.
Note that at each wave, students were invited to join even if
they had not participated in preceding waves of data collec-
tion. As shown in Table 1, at the final wave of data collection,
we assessed 72% of NESSY-O youth who participated as
high school seniors (age 27 years: 183 of 255 participants),
and 56% of NESSY-Y youth (age 22 years: 152 of 272 par-
ticipants). Whereas retention rates were lower for NESSY-Y,
they compare favorably to other follow-up studies of sub-
stance use among high school students. For example, the
Monitoring the Future (MTF) study reported retention rates
for high school seniors ranging from 50% to 54% for the first
year after high school through the fifth year after high school
(Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, Schulenberg, & Miech,
2014).
To test for attrition biases, we compared Grade 12 scores
on substance use between participants at the final year of
data collection with their counterparts who had dropped out
after high school assessments. In both NESSY-O and

 NESSY-Y, final year participants versus nonparticipants
were not significantly different on overall substance use as
high school seniors, F (1, 249) ¼ 0.40, ns and F (1, 264) ¼
0.63, ns. Further analyses showed, in addition, that there
were no significant differences for specific substance use cat-
egories, participant race, parents’ marital status, mother and
father education levels, mother and father employment status,
and number of hours/week parents worked outside the home.
Thus, the adult prospective samples appear to be generally
representative of the original NESSY-O and NESSY-Y cohorts
as high school seniors, with no evidence to suggest differen-
tial attrition.
Procedure
In the high school senior year, data collection occurred during
the month of May for both cohorts. Students’ participation
was voluntary and based on passive consent procedures, as
the study was part of school-based initiatives promoting pos-
itive youth development. Participants completed a packet of
questionnaires administered in a group setting, with research
assistants available to answer any questions that arose. In
Grade 12 assessments, participants received monetary incen-
tives of a $30 gift card for NESSY-O (who had already par-
ticipated in prior school-based assessments) and a $10 gift
card for NESSY-Y (for whom this was the first assessment).
In subsequent annual adult assessments, data were col-
lected via two processes: phone interviews for psychiatric di-
agnoses and online questionnaires in an extensive battery of
self-report measures including those on substance use. Of
the five adult assessments of NESSY-O, the first four (ages
23, 24, 25, and 26 years) involved the complete battery
with psychiatric interviews for diagnoses as well as all ques-
tionnaires, whereas in the last assessment (age 27), project
funds were available only for the questionnaire part of the
study. Thus, diagnostic data are presented through age 26
but use data are available at age 27 as well. The second co-
hort, NESSY-Y, received the complete battery of assessments
across four annual assessments, so that data on both diagno-
ses and use are available for ages 19, 20, 21, and 22. For
NESSY-O adult assessments, incentives for completing
both interview and online assessments were $150 at each
wave; for their final wave where only questionnaires were
completed, participants received $75. On completion of
both parts of the study, NESSY-Y participants received
$125 for participation during college freshman year, and
$150 in subsequent years.
Measures
Substance use: Prevalence rates and frequencies. Partici-
pants completed questions from the MTF (Johnston et al.,
2012) study about the use of alcohol and different substances.
The reliability and validity of this type of self-report have been
amply documented (http://www.monitoringthefuture.org).
For each substance, participants indicated use both for the
past year and the past 30 days, and in this paper, we present
rates of any past-year use because for some substances (i.e.,
those rarely used), normative data for the past 30 days are
not available. In addition, we considered past-year rates
more reliable than those in the past month, as participants
were assessed at different times in the year, and events
(e.g., final exams or football season in college) could have
skewed some 30-day use patterns.
Clinical diagnoses. Trained research assistants with bache-
lor’s degrees administered the Computerized Diagnostic In-
terview Schedule for the DSM-IV (Robins et al., 2000) to
subjects via telephone. The Computerized Diagnostic Inter-
view Schedule for the DSM-IV is a structured interview
that can be administered by lay interviewers and assesses life-
time and past-year symptoms according to the DSM-IV. All
responses are precoded, and the measure has good reliability
and criterion validity (Robins et al., 2000). In this study, we
report on lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses of both abuse and de-
pendence for alcohol and drugs. Criteria for drug abuse and
dependence are parallel to those for alcohol abuse and depen-
dence.
As noted earlier, lifetime diagnoses in both NESSY co-
horts are compared here to normative rates from the NCS-R
survey (Kessler et al., 2004), wherein DSM-IV diagnoses
were obtained via a structured interview also administered
by trained lay interviewers, using laptop computers. The in-
terview used in the NCS-R was the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview, which is similar to the Diagnostic Inter-
view Schedule but was designed to produce diagnoses based
on criteria of both DSM-IV and ICD-10 (National Comorbid-
ity Study, 2005). To ensure comparability with our sample,
we used the DSM-IV rates.
In the national NCS-R study, completed from 2001 to
2003, researchers had recruited participants from US house-
holds in different geographic regions, and had chosen one
adult member of the household randomly, for a total of
9,836 interviews of English-speaking adults to determine di-
agnosis. Rates were then appropriately weighted to adjust for
differential probabilities of selection for the national survey,
as some groups of respondents were undersampled (e.g.,
based on sociodemographic and geographic variables; see
Kessler et al., 2004). Accordingly, the NCS-R prevalence
rates we used, shown in the present tables, were calculated
using the same weighting criteria as were used in the NCS-
R study, to derive national lifetime rates, by gender, and at
the specific ages that corresponded to our NESSY-Y (age
22) and NESSY-O (age 26) samples. These conversions
were done by using SAS survey procedures (Version 9.1.5,
SAS Institute Inc.).
As previously indicated, we report on two sets of lifetime
diagnoses in our NESSY cohorts. The first is based on the last
assessment point only for each sample, as NCS-R rates were
based on a single interview. The second set of NESSY life-
time rates are based on diagnoses received across all annual
interviews, a method that both corrects for underestimation

Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Binghamton University, on 01 Jun 2017 at 17:40:38, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at
 due to retrospective recall spanning several years and takes
into account data from all participants, whether or not they
were interviewed in the last year of the study, specifically.
Parent containment of substance use: 12th grade. With re-
sponses rated on a 5-point scale, students were asked,
“How serious would the repercussions from your parents be
if they found out that you . . . Attended a keg or drinking party
without permission; Got drunk; Went to a party where no
adults were present without permission; Were smoking mar-
ijuana” (Luthar & Goldstein, 2008). Alpha coefficients
among females and males respectively were 0.89 and 0.87,
among NESSY-O, and 0.85 for both genders among
NESSY-Y.
Parent monitoring: 12th grade. Paralleling measures used by
Fletcher, Steinberg, and Williams-Wheeler (2004), participants
were asked about how much their parents know about their ac-
tivities via a five-item, 5-point scale (Luthar & Goldstein,
2008). Illustrative items include “My parents know where I
am after school,” “My parents know how I spend my money,”
and “My parents know who my friends are.” Alpha coefficients
among females and males respectively were 0.75 and 0.78
among NESSY-O, and 0.75 and 0.78 among NESSY-Y.
Results
Comparability of the two cohorts in adolescence
As noted earlier, the two cohorts were similar in sociodemo-
graphics; to ascertain overall comparability on substance use,
we examined past-year rates of use as high school seniors ver-
sus rates in MTF norms also assessed in the 12th grade and
during the same calendar year (i.e., 2005 and 2010 to com-
pare with NESSY-O and NESSY-Y, respectively). Results
for both cohorts are shown in Table 2. Note that in this and
subsequent tables (Tables 3 and 4), comparisons in which
the category encompasses more than one particular substance
within MTF norms, the MTF value that we report is that of the
substance with the highest rate in the norms. Thus, in the in-
terest of stringency, we compare to MTF rates of Adderall ra-
ther than Ritalin that are lower in MTF; tranquilizers rather
than barbiturates; and ecstasy rather than ketamine.
To ease interpretation of the array of values, we present not
only rates in our two cohorts and those in MTF norms during
the same calendar year but also the relative risk, calculated as
a simple ratio. Thus, as 84.5% of NESSY-Y girls reported al-
cohol use in Grade 12 versus 65.3% in MTF norms, the rel-
ative ratio was 84.5/65.3 ¼ 1.29 (the first row in Table 2).
In addition, we conducted, significance testing to compare
the proportions of use in the NESSY samples versus the
MTF sample using two-tailed z tests, appropriately weighted
for sample size differences. Where NESSY values were sig-
nificantly higher than those in MTF, ratios and z scores are
shown in bold in the tables.
As shown in Table 2, elevations were apparent on the use
dimensions we had expected, a priori, based on prior high
school assessments. For females and males in the older and
younger cohorts, NESSY values were significantly higher
than those in MTF on 11 of the 12 comparisons: frequency
of alcohol use, drunkenness, and marijuana use among all
subgroups with the exception of marijuana use among
NESSY-O males. In addition, there were slight elevations
in the use of tranquilizers only among NESSY-Y males and
NESSY-O females, with the latter also showing elevations
in Adderall use. Other rates of use were below norms in
both high school cohorts.
Substance use relative to national norms
In Table 3, we present prevalence rates of substance use across
each of the 4 college years for the NESSY-Y cohort, as com-
pared to MTF normative rates (Johnston et al., 2014) corre-
sponding to ages 19–22 years during the same calendar year.
For comparisons in Table 3, again, two-tailed z tests weighted
for sample size were conducted to test for differences in the
proportions between the NESSY and MTF samples.
Unfortunately, MTF prevalence rates for college students
specifically are not available separately by both age and gen-
der, but rather are reported for the overall age bracket 19–22
years, encompassing typical ages during college attendance,
separately for males and females. Because (a) it is well known
that substance use is higher among college students than oth-
ers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration, 2012), and (b) of central interest to us, a priori,
were gender-specific use patterns among NESSY youth
across young adulthood, we used these MTF rates in central
analyses of relative risk among NESSY-Y. (Note that com-
parisons by specific ages 19, 20, 21, and 22, relative to overall
MTF rates for these ages, not just for college students and not
separated by gender, are depicted in Figure 1.)
As shown in Table 3, for the four use indices in which we
expected to see elevations (i.e., drunk, marijuana, stimulants,
and cocaine), and across all 4 years of college and among
both males and females, prevalence rates were significantly
higher than norms in 27 of the 32 instances. Of the other 5 ra-
tios that were not statistically significant, 4 were those for co-
caine, which were 1.5–2.4 times higher in NESSY than MTF,
but actual incidence rates were too low to allow for statistical
significance (ns of 3, 5, 6, and 8 for values in order, across
Table 3). The 27 significantly elevated ratios ranged from
1.27 to 5.33, with a median value of 1.81. Overall, therefore,
findings were striking in showing that across all 8 observa-
tions (4 years and both genders), almost every ratio for drunk,
marijuana, stimulants, and cocaine was above norms (97%),
and relative elevations were statistically significant in 85%
of comparisons.
In Table 4, we present parallel values for NESSY-O for
five assessments between the ages of 23 in 2010, and 27 in
2014, compared with MTF normative rates for adults (ages
19–30, during the same calendar years), separately by males

 and females. Unfortunately, MTF normative rates for adult
men and women are not broken down by specific age but
are presented across the span of 19–30 years. Again, as our
central a priori goal was to illuminate NESSY use patterns
separately by gender, our primary analyses entailed compar-
isons of adult MTF men and women in Table 4. Subse-
quently, we also show descriptive rates for specific NESSY
ages 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27, relative to each of these ages in
MTF (not split by gender) in Figure 1.
As in preceding analyses, two-tailed z tests weighted for
sample size were conducted to test for differences in the pro-
portions between the NESSY and MTF samples. Rates were
significantly different in 36 of the 40 comparisons involving
elevations hypothesized a priori: drunkenness, marijuana,
stimulants, and cocaine, among females and males across five
observations. The four nonsignificant ratios were all above
1, for example, 1.25 for marijuana use by females at 25,
1.62 for Adderall use by males at age 25, 1.31 for marijuana
use by females age 27, and 1.27 for Adderall use by males age
27. The 36 significantly elevated ratios ranged from 1.25 to
5.25, with a median value of 2.1.
Aside from the indices we had hypothesized to be ele-
vated, findings also revealed distinct elevations on club drugs
such as ecstasy among NESSY-O, with 9 of the 10 values sta-
tistically significant ranging from 2.30 to 3.69 (Table 4).
Tranquilizer use rates were somewhat higher than norms in
both cohorts, with 12 of the 18 ratios across Tables 3 and 4
being greater than 1.5 (although only statistically significant
differences in 5 of these, possibly due in part to low incidence
of tranquilizer use overall). Finally, cigarette use, surpris-
ingly, was significantly elevated in 9 of the 10 comparisons
among NESSY-O, with z scores ranging from 1.34 to 1.82.
Trends displayed over time
Figure 1 displays patterns of use over time for both cohorts,
side by side, across the four annual assessments during col-
lege (NESSY-Y) and five adult assessments (NESSY-O),
along with national norms by individual age. As noted before,
previously discussed comparisons in Table 3 referenced na-
tional rates for 19- to 22-year-old college students, rather
than separate rates for 19-, 20-, 21-, and 22-year-olds. In
Figure 1, we present comparisons of NESSY-Y with MTF
rates for each age (19, 20, 21, and 22 years), acknowledging
that the latter normative data included both college students
and others, and combined for men and women. As a reference
point for patterns during each of the adult years, we include
Grade 12 rates. In these figures, NESSY-Y and NESSY-O
rates are shown by the lines across the annual assessments,
and the bars show parallel rates for the MTF normative sam-
ples at the same age and during the same calendar year. These
comparative rates are shown not only for the four indices for
which we had expected elevations a priori (drunk, marijuana,
stimulants, and cocaine) but also for ecstasy and downers
(e.g., tranquilizers) that we found, in this study, to show ele-
vations (Table 3 and Table 4).
With regard to possible “maturing out,” across the college
years, prevalence rates did seem to decrease for some indices
by the senior year of college, for example, marijuana and ec-
stasy. At the same time, elevations relative to norms appeared
somewhat elevated among NESSY-Y on drunk (83% vs.
66% in norms), stimulant use (21% vs. 8% in norms), and co-
caine use (9% vs. 5%; percentages averaged across men and
women, in Table 3). Among NESSY-O individuals, we did
not see any marked reductions in rates of use at the last assess-
ment relative to all prior years, ages 23 to 27 years.
Diagnoses
Presented in Table 5 are lifetime rates of DSM-IV substance use
diagnoses in the NESSY-Y (age 22 years) and NESSY–O (age
26 years) cohorts, compared with rates of diagnoses estimated
in the NCS-R study for adults of the same age (Kessler et al.,
2004), separately by gender. Values in the first set of columns
are based on lifetime diagnoses as reported in only the last as-
sessment of NESSY-Y or NESSY-O along with parallel values
in the NCS-R (also based on a single assessment), and their ra-
tio, NESSY/NCS-R. Again, two-tailed z tests weighted for
sample size were conducted to test for differences in the propor-
tions between the NESSY and MTF samples. Incidence rates in
the last set of columns for women and men represent diagnoses
based on cumulative assessments, that is, if criteria were met at
any of the annual assessments conducted, for each cohort.
The first two rows of Table 5 depict the diagnostic values of
greatest concern (i.e., signifying dependence on, or addiction,
to any substance). As shown there, values were significantly
elevated for three of the four subgroups with relative ratios of
2.37, 3.30, and 2.05 for NESSY-Y men and NESSY-O women
and men, respectively. Among NESSY-Y women, rates of de-
pendence were close to those in national norms.
Percentages of participants meeting diagnostic criteria for
dependence based on cumulative assessments in the last col-
umn, versus a single assessment (first column) were 15.8%
versus 11.4% for NESSY-Y women; 26.9% versus 19.2%
for NESSY-Y men; 24.2% versus 18.5% for NESSY-O wo-
men; and were substantially different among NESSY-O men,
at 40.0% versus 22.6%.
On diagnoses of any substance abuse, NESSY-Y men and
women were both below norms. Their older counterparts
were above norms (ratios 1.4 and 1.33), but these differences
were not statistically significant.
Predicting substance use in adulthood
For the prospective examination of associations between high
school containment and adult use levels, regression and medi-
ation analyses were conducted using MPlus 7.11 (Muthe
´n &
Muthe
´n, 2013) with full information maximum likelihood
unless otherwise specified. Maximum likelihood missing
data handling was employed to account for the existence of
missing data (Enders, 2010), whether due to attrition or a re-
sult of incomplete measurement. Maximum likelihood miss-

 ing data handling utilizes all of the available observations for
each case to compute the likelihood function (Enders & Ban-
dalos, 2001), and subsequently provides unbiased estimates
with minimal standard errors when data are missing at ran-
dom (Schafer & Graham, 2002). To account for the existence
of missing data and ensure the use of all available observa-
tions, maximum likelihood missing data handling requires
that the model specify the estimation of means, variances,
and covariances among the predictors.
In examining long-term effects of perceived parents’ con-
tainment, we examined whether containment in high school
was linked with use frequencies at the last assessment for
three indices on which we expected adequate variability:
drunk, marijuana use, and stimulant use. Regression analy-
ses showed that after controlling for gender and parental
monitoring, containment was significantly associated with
lower levels of drunkenness and marijuana use among
NESSY-Y, and for all three outcomes among NESSY-O
(see Table 6). Once Grade 12 levels of overall substance
use (summed across all substances) were also considered
in Model 2, three of the five associations became nonsigni-
ficant, suggestive of mediated effects. (Correlations between
containment and Grade 12 use were r ¼ –.40 for NESSY-Y
and r ¼ –.46 for NESSY-O, respectively; between contain-
ment and gender were r ¼ –.05 for NESSY-Y and r ¼ –.02
for NESSY-O, respectively; and between Grade 12 use and
gender were r ¼ –.03 for NESSY-Y and r ¼ –.19 for
NESSY-O, respectively.)
In follow-up analyses, we estimated mediated effects and
95% confidence intervals for the same three substance use
indices for which we ran regressions, using MODEL INDI-
RECT in Mplus 7.1 (Muthe
´n & Muthe
´n, 2013) with bias
corrected bootstrap resampling (5,000 samples) for greater ac-
curacy in the estimation of the standard errors (MacKinnon,
2008). A mediated effect was considered statistically
significant when the confidence interval did not contain
zero (MacKinnon, 2008). The results indicated that Grade
12 use significantly mediated the influence of parental con-
tainment on drunkenness and marijuana use for both
NESSY-O and NESSY-Y cohorts, and on stimulant use for
the NESSY-Y cohort only (see Table 7).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that it is probably unwise to treat lightly
the elevated rates of substance use previously documented
among upper middle class teenagers; a troubling proportion
of these youth met criteria for diagnoses of substance depen-
dence in their late 20s. In the older NESSY cohort assessed at
age 26, lifetime diagnoses of addiction to any substance (drug
or alcohol) were over 2 and 3 times those of national rates, for
men and women, respectively. Data on the younger NESSY
cohort showed that by age 22 years, lifetime rates of depen-
dence on any substance were 2.4 times national rates for
men, although rates among the younger women were closer
to normative rates (0.95).
It should be noted that the estimates discussed here are on
the conservative side, being based on a single diagnostic in-
terview (the last in the follow-ups of each cohort). Retrospec-
tive recall could have diminished reporting of some serious
use in past years (Moffitt et al., 2010; Olino et al., 2012;
Takayanagi et al., 2014). As shown in the tables, when overall
lifetime rates were computed on the basis of repeated annual
interviews, rates of diagnoses were substantially higher.
Further suggesting the seriousness of the issues are data on
the actual frequency of using different substances over time,
including not only drunkenness and marijuana use (elevated
even in high school) but also the use of stimulants and co-
caine as hypothesized. Across multiple waves, stimulant
use rates for NESSY-O ranged between 15% and 20%, at
least twice as high as in MTF norms. Among NESSY-Y
across the college years, one in five of NESSY-Y on average
reported misusing stimulants, rates more than twice as high as
in normative MTF samples. Similar trends were seen on co-
caine: in both cohorts, rates of cocaine use were, again, at
least twice as high as in norms.
One of the four subgroups in this study did not show sig-
nificant elevations in diagnoses of any substance dependence
compared to NCS-R rates: that is, NESSY-Y women. How-
ever, even among these young women, a disturbingly high
proportion were not only getting drunk frequently but also
misusing other substances. Rates of intoxication were around
1.5 those of MTF norms across the four assessment waves as
rates for both stimulants and cocaine were 1.5 to more than 2
times normative values. The consistency of elevated frequen-
cies across time is cause for concern (notwithstanding that
some frequent users did not meet criteria for addiction by
age 22). It is also possible that increasing proportions of these
young women would meet diagnostic criteria in the years
after college graduation, approaching the clearly elevated
rates of NESSY-O women by age 26.
Conservatively estimating, therefore, for three of the four
subgroups in this study, findings resonate with reports on
the growing problem of abuse in segments of the population
that thus far have not been thought of as being “at risk.” Re-
cent studies have suggested that in their adult years, adoles-
cents from high SES families have higher rates of binge
drinking as well as misuse of marijuana, stimulants, prescrip-
tion drugs, and cocaine, with these elevations seen even
among those with full-time employment, well after college
graduation (Arria, Bugbee, Caldeira, & Vincent, 2014; Hu-
mensky, 2010). These past reports have been based on survey
data; to our knowledge, ours is the first study to report on in-
terview-based DSM-IV diagnoses, with rates reported for
both substance dependence and abuse. It is worrisome to
learn that before their 27th birthdays, lifetime diagnoses of
any substance dependence could be seen among men and
women from upper middle class communities in as many
as 23%–40% of men, and 19%–24% of women.
Potentially mitigating concerns, in contrast, it should be
noted that with further developmental maturity, diagnoses
of past-year dependence could be reduced somewhat.

 Whereas life transitions such as marriage or having children
are typically associated with marked reductions in substance
use (Bachman et al., 1997; Glatz et al., 2012), in the upper
middle class cohorts in this study, neither event had yet
occurred at their final assessments for any participant. In fu-
ture work, it will be important to ascertain whether diagnostic
rates, as well as frequency of use, decrease with transition to
adult roles such as marriage (which tends to occur later
among the more affluent), or whether they might remain ele-
vated given high lifetime rates already documented.
Containment
Perceived parent containment for substance use is reportedly
a robust predictor of concurrent use levels among affluent
adolescents (Luthar et al., 2013), and results of this study in-
dicate potential ramifications continuing well into adulthood
(Hartman et al., 2016). Perceived parents’ containment at age
18 was found to have direct associations with the frequency of
marijuana use at age 22 among the younger NESSY cohort,
and with the frequency of stimulant use at age 27 among
the older cohort. Furthermore, containment was indirectly as-
sociated, through substance use in Grade 12, with drunken-
ness and marijuana use at both age 22 and age 27 years,
and with stimulant use at age 22.
Along with prior evidence that perceived parental approval
of substance use influences substance use behavior (Boyle &
Boekeloo, 2006; Messler, Quevillon, & Simons, 2014), find-
ings from this study highlight the need for upper middle class
parents to revisit laissez-faire attitudes toward their high
school children’s substance use, with three caveats. The first
is that the repercussions meted out should be consequential,
but at the same time, (a) are not draconian, (b) are mutually
agreed upon (for “repeat offenses”), and (c) are consistently
enforced, within the context of a supportive parent–child rela-
tionship. Overly severe punishments in the absence of support
and nurturance will inevitably backfire (Luthar et al., 2013).
Second, along with such limit setting, parents would do well
to discuss these issues long before the onset of high school,
spelling out the risks associated. In this regard, Reyna and

 Mills’s (2014) findings are useful, showing the benefits of sex
education programs conveying the “bottom line” of the risks
involved, such as “it only takes once” to contract a sexually
transmitted disease. With regard to substance abuse, an anal-
ogous message for these highly achieving and ambitious
youth might be that “it takes only one arrest” for cocaine pos-
session, or for injuring someone while driving intoxicated, to
disqualify them from future careers involving high-profile, se-
nior positions of substantive leadership.
Limitations
There are questions about generalizability of our findings, as
both schools from which cohorts were originally sampled
were located in the suburbs of the northeastern United States
(although in their adult years, participants lived in varied geo-
graphic locations). At the same time, we should note that the
12th grade elevations in use are consistent with high relative
risk rate patterns across many other high school samples, in
suburbs and cites (see Botticello, 2009; Coley et al., 2017;
Lund et al., 2017; Patrick et al., 2012; Reboussin et al.,
2010; Song et al., 2009).
A related limitation is small sample size; neither cohort
was large, and each showed the kind of attrition that is ex-
pected when high school students are followed into adult-
hood. As noted earlier, high school assessments were con-
ducted as part of the routine school day, whereas all
subsequent interviews required proactive participation. This
said, our retention rates of 56% to 72% across adult assess-
ments compare reasonably with parallel MTF rates for high
school seniors, ranging from 50% to 54% for the first year
through the fifth year after high school (Johnston et al.,
2014), although for NESSY-Y, rates are lower than the ap-
proximately 65% retention in prospective studies that used in-
terviews rather than survey-based questionnaires (see Deng,
Hillygus, Reiter, Si, & Zeng, 2013; Rothman, 2009). Perhaps
most importantly, there was no evidence of differential attri-
tion in either the NESSY-O or the NESSY-Y cohort, in terms
of high school levels of substance use, or on multiple socio-
demographic indices including parents’ education, employ-
ment status, race, or marital status.
With regard to findings on containment, the possibility of
bidirectional effects must be acknowledged. There is a con-
siderable literature showing that children’s behaviors can af-
fect those of parents in addition to the reverse (see Abar, Jack-
son, & Wood, 2014; Kerr, Stattin, & O
¨ zdemir, 2012; Pardini,
2008; Racz & McMahon, 2011). Thus, in some instances, it is
plausible that adolescents were using frequently but without
being caught, leading to beliefs that if use were to be detected,
the teen might minimize it as a one-time event and thus meet
with few consequences from parents.
As we fully acknowledge the limitations of this work, we
believe that it is worth considering our findings, at the very
least, as pointing to potentially serious public health issues
warranting further rigorous study. A defining feature of the
field of developmental psychopathology, across the more
than three decades since its inception, is careful attentiveness
to the implications of data for policy and practice (Cicchetti,
1984). As colleagues in science weigh the credibility of the
rates we have described, to treat them as probable “false pos-
itives” (e.g., as they are based on just two Northeast cohorts)
could turn out to be a disservice to many if there are serious
problems of drug and alcohol addiction in a substantial pro-
portion of youth growing up in affluent communities. Our
own perspective is that from a prevention standpoint, it might
be more prudent to treat these elevated rates of addiction as
real possibilities, with future research systematically refuting
or substantiating this postulate as the case may be, given the
substantial costs of these problems to society: estimated at
over $600 billion in the United States (National Institute on
Drug Abuse, 2014). Even among well-educated adults, fre-
quent use of alcohol and drugs is linked with lower yearly
earnings as well as poorer functioning at work (Ellickson,
Martino, & Collins, 2004; Ellickson, Tucker, Klein, &
McGuigan, 2001; Griffin, Samuolis, & Williams, 2011).
Finally, in weighing the possible seriousness of these is-
sues, it is worth considering national data on the misuse of
prescription drugs over time. Between 2006 and 2011, the
nonmedical use of the stimulant Adderall reportedly rose
67%, and emergency room visits went up 156% (Chen
et al., 2016). Increasing misuse was particularly pronounced
among 18- to 25-year-olds (often used as study aids in col-
lege); these young adults usually procured the medications
from family and friends (Chen et al., 2016). In analyses of
trends spanning 2004–2013, researchers documented signifi-
cant increases in emergency department visits for drug over-
doses among children and adolescents, with most poisonings
resulting from unsupervised exposure to opioids (including
pain medications such as oxycodone), followed closely by
benzodiazepines or tranquilizers (Lovegrove, Weidle, & Bud-
nitz, 2015). Finally, analyses of patterns between 1997 and
2012 showed significant increases in opioid poisonings
among 15- to 19-year-olds (Gaither, Leventhal, Ryan, & Ca-
menga, 2016). Besides suicidal intent, poisonings occurred
because of recreational misuse and self-medication for de-
pression or anxiety, and once again, most teens obtained
the drugs from friends or family (Gaither et al., 2016; Hirsh-
man, 2017). Obviously, the ability to obtain all these con-
trolled substances is easiest for young adults who have ample
discretional spending money.
Future directions
In the years ahead, our findings suggest the need for more fo-
cused research on substance use in teens in upper middle class
communities. It has been noted that acquiring these samples in
developmental research can be difficult given the high empha-
sis on privacy of students (some of whom have well-known
parents); furthermore, even when school-based assessments
are obtained, following them over time can be complicated
as monetary incentives for participation are not adequate as
many are well-off (Luthar et al., 2013). As was the case

 with the accelerated scientific attention to youth in poverty
when they were recognized as being at risk for adjustment
problems (see Huston, McLoyd, & Garcia Coll, 1994), we
would suggest that there is value in future initiatives seeking
focused research on this subgroup of youth. Useful, for exam-
ple, could be requests for proposals with funds allocated to
studies on the onset, ontogenesis, and potential mitigation of
drug and alcohol use among teens growing up in relatively af-
fluent schools and communities.
In future prospective research and with large enough sam-
ples, it will be important to tease apart long-term effects, on
youth, of demographic indices not examined here, with ap-
propriate significance testing. As suggested at the outset of
this paper, for example, parents’ income or education levels
might contribute less unique variance to high substance use
than does growing up in schools and communities with
mostly high SES families (Coley et al., 2017; Jensen, Chas-
sin, & Gonzales, 2017; Lund et al., 2017; Odgers, Donley,
Caspi, Bates, & Moffitt, 2015; Trim & Chassin, 2008). In ad-
dition, it will be important to disentangle effects of ethnicity
(Crosnoe, 2009). In this study as in the general population,
families with high SES disproportionately included Cauca-
sians. Finally, with larger samples (and thus greater power
to detect significance given relatively low-incidence prob-
lems), there is value in exploring if there are any long-term
associations between high school parent containment and la-
ter psychiatric diagnoses of dependence on different substan-
ces, and if there are, whether these too might be mediated by
levels of use during the high school years.
In conclusion, results of this study suggest the value of
more systematic, long-term studies on a population that is
quite possibly at considerable risk for problems of addiction:
youth raised in relatively well-to-do school and community
settings. Although by no means decisive, the patterns docu-
mented are troubling given their consistency across two inde-
pendent cohorts, different sets of measures (questionnaires
and interviews), and across 10 annual assessments, consid-
ered cumulatively. Prospective studies of any at-risk groups
are rarely pursued without some initial evidence of long-
term problems. As results of this study show little evidence
that participants matured out of serious alcohol and drug mis-
use well into their 20s, we hope that this work will, at the
least, serve as “preliminary data” for long-term, contextually
sensitive research on problems of substance misuse among
children in upwardly mobile communities. Over time, such
research could prove invaluable for a sizeable group of youth
whose vulnerability is profound, but remains largely un-
acknowledged in science, prevention, and public policy.
