Summary 
Background: Few studies have examined the efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES) for reducing 
aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft (SVG) failure when compared with bare metal stents 
(BMS) in patients undergoing stenting of de novo SVG lesions.  
Methods: We performed a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of DES vs 
BMS in de novo SVG lesions. The primary endpoint was the 12-month incidence of target vessel 
failure (TVF, defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or 
target vessel revascularization). Secondary endpoints included all-cause death, myocardial 
infarction during follow-up, and target lesion revascularization. Enrollment was stopped before 
reaching the revised target sample size of 762 patients.    
Findings: A total of 599 patients were randomised over the phone and the data for 597 were 
used. Mean age was 68∙6 ± 7∙6 years and over 99%% (595 of 597) of the patients were men. The 
two study groups were similar for most baseline characteristics. At 12 months the incidence of 
TVF was 17%% (51 of 292) in the DES group vs. 19%% (58 of 305) in the BMS group (adjusted 
hazard ratio 0∙92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0∙63 to 1∙34, p=0∙7067).  There were no 
significant between group differences in the components of the primary endpoint or stent 
thrombosis. Over the entire length of follow-up (median: 2∙7 years), the incidence of TVF was 
37% in the DES group vs. 34% in the BMS group (hazard ratio, 1∙11, 95% CI 0∙85 to 1∙45, 
p=0∙46).   
Interpretation: In patients undergoing stenting of de novo SVG lesions there were no significant 
differences in outcomes between those receiving DES and BMS during 12-month and long-term 
follow-up.

Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Saphenous vein graft failure can be challenging to treat due to high rates of periprocedural 
complications and in-stent restenosis. Drug-eluting stents appeared to provide improved 
outcomes as compared with bare metal stents in three of the four randomised-controlled trials 
performed to date, driven by lower rates of target lesion revascularization. However, these 
studies were limited by small size, lack of blinding, routine angiographic follow-up, low use of 
embolic protection devices (EPDs), and use of first generation DES.  
Added value of this study 
DIVA investigated the efficacy and safety of DES versus BMS in patients presenting with de 
novo saphenous vein graft lesions.  At 12 months there was no significant difference in the 
incidence of target vessel failure (composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, 
or target vessel revascularization). Similarly, during a median follow-up of 2.7 years, target 
vessel failure occurred in approximately 1 in 3 patients, without difference between bare metal 
and drug-eluting stents.  
Implications of all the available evidence 
The common clinical perception is that patients who need stenting of saphenous vein graft 
lesions derive benefit from drug-eluting stent implantation. The results of the DIVA, the only 
blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial of drug-eluting stents vs. bare metal stents in 
saphenous vein grafts that did not mandate routine angiographic follow-up, show that drug-
eluting stents and bare metal stents were associated with similar clinical outcomes. Given their 
lower cost, bare metal stents may be preferred in saphenous vein graft lesions

Introduction 
Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) is one of the most commonly performed surgical 
procedures with an estimated 400,000 cases performed in the US during 2010.1 Patients who 
undergo CABG often develop bypass graft failure, especially in saphenous vein grafts (SVGs).2-5 
Approximately one in five patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the 
US has had prior CABG and 6% of all PCIs in the United States are performed in SVGs.4,6 
Stents improve outcomes as compared with balloon angioplasty in SVG PCI and are the current 
standard of care. Although drug-eluting stents (DES) improve outcomes compared with bare 
metal stents (BMS) in native coronary artery lesions,7 their efficacy and safety in SVG lesions 
has received limited study.8-13 Four randomised studies have been performed with conflicting 
results (three studies showed benefit with DES11-13 and one showed harm9). These studies were 
limited by small size,9,11,13 lack of blinding,11-13 routine angiographic follow-up,9,11,12 low use of 
embolic protection devices (EPDs)12 and use of first generation DES.9,11-13 
We, therefore, examined the risks and benefits of using DES versus BMS in SVGs in a 
prospective, double-blind, randomised trial. 
Methods 
 
Study design 
The Drug-Eluting Stents vs. Bare Metal Stents In Saphenous Vein Graft Angioplasty 
(DIVA) Trial was a multicenter, randomised trial conducted at 25 VA centers. The DIVA trial 
study design has been published.14 The trial was funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs' 
Cooperative Studies Program. A planning committee and a steering committee designed the 
 11 
 
study, managed the study conduct and data collection, and made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication.  
The trial was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Institutional 
Review Board and each participating site's Research and Development Committee. All patients 
provided written informed consent. 
 
Participants 
Between January 2012 and December 2015, 3,482 patients with prior CABG undergoing 
cardiac catheterization at participating sites were evaluated for enrollment (Figure 1). Eligible 
patients were those who were at least 18 years of age and who had at least one significant de 
novo SVG lesion (50-99% stenosis of a 2∙25-4∙5 mm diameter SVG) requiring PCI with intent to 
use EPD, agreed to participate and take medication as prescribed, and provided informed 
consent. Patients were excluded if they had planned non-cardiac surgery within 12 months of 
screening; presented with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction; had a target SVG 
that was the last remaining vessel or was a “left main” equivalent; had any previous 
percutaneous treatment of the target vessel within the prior 12 months; had hemorrhagic 
diatheses, or refused to receive blood transfusions; required warfarin administration for the 
following 12 months and were considered to be at high risk of bleeding with triple 
anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy; had recent positive pregnancy test, breast-feeding, or 
possibility of a future pregnancy; had coexisting conditions that limited life expectancy to less 
than 12 months; had a history of allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to any drug or metal 
included in DES; were allergic to clopidogrel and did not present with acute coronary syndrome 
 12 
 
(ACS) at sites that use blinded study medication; or participated in another interventional 
randomised trial. 
 
Randomisation, masking, and procedures 
Enrolled patients were randomly assigned using a phone system in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
DES or BMS in the target SVG(s). Each patient received as many stents as clinically indicated 
based on operator judgment.  Randomisation was stratified by presence/absence of diabetes, and 
number of target SVG lesions requiring PCI (1 or ≥2) within each participating site using an 
adaptive scheme intended to balance the two stent type groups on marginal totals for the 
stratification factors.  
Stents used in the trial were commercially available in clinical practice during the study 
period.  Operators were allowed to use the DES or BMS of their choice. To preserve the study 
blinding, at sites where standard of care was to treat patients receiving only BMS with one 
month of a P2Y12 inhibitor, study patients who did not present with an ACS and who did not 
require ≥12 months of P2Y12 inhibitor for clinical reasons were given clopidogrel or matching 
placebo for 12 months. All patients were prescribed aspirin as per standard of care. 
PCI was performed using standard techniques at the discretion of each operator. Intent to 
use an EPD was required for inclusion in the study. In patients with multiple lesions the same 
type of stent was used for all lesions whenever possible. 
 
Outcomes 
 13 
 
Patients were followed every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months 
thereafter. Quality of life questionnaires were administered at baseline and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 
months.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month incidence of target vessel failure 
(TVF), defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI), or 
target vessel revascularization (TVR). Periprocedural myocardial infarction was not included in 
the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included procedural success and complications; all-
cause death and cardiac death; follow-up MI15; stent thrombosis16; target lesion revascularization 
(TLR); non-target vessel revascularization; the composite endpoint of any death, any MI, or 
TVR (patient-oriented composite endpoint); the composite endpoint of cardiac death, target 
vessel MI, or TLR (device-oriented composite endpoint for target lesion failure)16; stroke; and 
incremental cost-effectiveness of DES relative to BMS (not included in this manuscript). The 
definitions of the study endpoints were published in the DIVA design paper.14  
The cardiac interventionalist was not blinded to the stent assignment, but the participants, 
the referring physicians, the (primary) study coordinators and the outcome assessors (clinical 
events committee and angiographic and intravascular ultrasonography core laboratories) were 
blinded. An independent clinical events committee (CEC) adjudicated possible TVF events (all 
deaths, MIs not reported as non-target vessel, and TVRs) reported by the sites that occurred 
during the first 12 months of follow-up. In addition, the study’s angiographic and 
electrocardiographic core laboratories reviewed the angiograms and electrocardiograms in a 
blinded manner to verify that events reported by the sites as definite stent thrombosis met the 
definition used in DIVA. Counts for all other event types are based on cases reported by the 
sites.  
 14 
 
Statistical analysis 
We estimated that a total sample size of 519 participants at 25 sites would provide 123 
participants with primary outcome (12-month TVF) and 90% power for detecting the difference 
between the two groupsprimary outcome during the first year of follow-up, assuming 12-month 
TVF rate 30% in BMS and 18% in DES (corresponding hazard ratio 0 .556).9,10,17,18  Because of 
a lower than anticipated overall TVF rate of 16% after 384 randomisations, the sample size was 
increased to 762 which would provide 86% power to detect a group difference based on 122 
participants with TVF, an overall TVF rate of 16%, and 40% relative reduction for the DES 
group (corresponding hazard ratio 0 .573). Two interim analyses were planned, at approximately 
25% and 60% of target adjudicated primary outcomes, to allow early stopping for efficacy 
(based on O’Brien-Flemming boundary) or futility (based on conditional power). The first 
interim analysis was performed on October 13, 2015, when there were 35 adjudicated primary 
outcomes (29% information time); at that time 576 participants were randomized. The Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended the study to continue. the TVF rate was lower than 
anticipated, hence the sample size was increased to 762. Trial enrollment was terminated on 
December 31, 2015 due to slower than expected enrollment and funding issues; the final number 
of randomisations was 599. We only report data for 597 because for two participants the consent 
process was performed improperly. The study follow-up ended on December 31, 2016. The 
minimum length of follow-up was one year and the maximum was five years. The post hoc 
power of the study with 109 adjudicated primary outcomes has 86% post-hoc power  to detect 
the originally hypothesized difference between DES and BMShazard ratio 0.556 and 83% power 
to detect the revised hypothesized hazard ratio 0.573. 
 15 
 
The analyses for all outcomes followed the intention-to-treat principle. The primary 
analysis was the comparison of time to first TVF between the DES and BMS groups in the initial 
12 months following index stent implantation. Cumulative incidence curves for time to TVF 
were calculated by stent group. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time 
of last contact. Log rank tests were used to compare the time to TVF. This test was stratified by 
presence or absence of diabetes and by number of target SVG lesions that were treated (one vs. 
>1). Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model19 was used to assess the effect of stent 
type as well as various covariates on time to TVF. Participant and graft characteristics thought to 
be potentially predictive of SVG patency, including diabetes mellitus, number of target SVG 
lesions (1 or >1), reference vessel diameter, stent length, the SVG recipient vessel (left anterior 
descending artery, circumflex, right coronary artery), lesion location (aorto-ostial, body, distal 
anastomotic), and baseline TIMI flow (3 vs. <3), were first entered into the regression model. 
Stent assignment (DES vs. BMS) was then added to the model to see if it was a statistically 
significant predictor of TVF above and beyond the participant-graft characteristics. Interaction 
terms between stent type and other significant participant-graft characteristics were also 
assessed. Potential time-varying stent effects were assessed by plotting using the scaled 
Schoenfeld residuals against time and using the Grambsch and Therneau (1994) test.20 We also 
assessed piecewise constant hazard ratios for the time period up to one year of follow-up (the 
interval for the primary endpoint) versus after one year to test for non-constant hazards. 
Interaction terms between stent type and other significant participant-graft characteristics were 
also assessed. A two-sided p-value of 0∙05 from the stratified log-rank test was used as the level 
of significance for the primary outcome. As a pre-planned secondary analysis, we performed 
similar analyses as above to compare time to TVF based on all follow-up data.  
 16 
 
The procedural success rate and the incidence of post-procedural MI and post-procedural 
GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding21,22 were compared between the DES and BMS groups 
using the difference between two independent proportions. Cumulative incidence curves and log-
rank tests were used to compare the two stent groups on the incidence of the secondary clinical 
outcomes listed above. When appropriate, competing risks analyses with plots of cumulative 
incidence curves and comparisons of cumulative incidences using Gray’s (1988) test23 and Fine 
& Gray’s (1999)24 methods were performed. Proportional hazards regression for sub-
distributions of competing risks were also performed.  
The DIVA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01121224. 
Role of the funding source 
The funder (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program) was involved in study design, data 
collection, site monitoring, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, but did 
not influence the interpretation of the trial results nor the decision to submit the paper for 
publication. Members of the Executive Committee had full access to all the data in the study. 
The corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
RESULTS 
Patients and follow-up 
Between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015, a total of 3,482 patients with prior 
CABG undergoing cardiac catheterization at the participating centers were screened for 
participation in the trial and 597 (17%) were randomised and included in the final analysis 
(Figure 1). The two study groups were well balanced for most clinical and angiographic 
characteristics (Table 1), except for SVG age and race categories. During the index procedure, 
13%% (77 of 597) of the patients had one target SVG with multiple SVG lesions treated, 4%% 
 17 
 
(23 of 597) had multiple SVGs treated, and 16%% (95 of 597) had native coronary artery lesions 
treated. An embolic protection device was used in 69%% (409 of 597) of patients in both groups. 
In the group receiving DES, 88%% (256 of 292) of participants received second generation DES 
(63% everolimus-eluting stents and 26% zotarolimus-eluting stents, with some participants 
receiving both). Newer generation BMS with thin struts were used in the BMS group. The names 
and manufacturers of all types of stents that were implanted at baseline are shown in Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix. The median follow-up time was 32 months (range: 0∙23 to 59). 
 
Study outcomes 
At 12 months, the incidence of TVF was 17%% (51 of 292) in the DES group and 19%% 
(58 of 305) in the BMS group (using the stratified log rank test; hazard ratio unadjusted for 
stratification of randomisation was 0∙92, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0∙63 to 1∙34, p=0∙7067) 
(Table 2 and Figure 2). Log rank tests unstratified by diabetes status and 1 versus ≥2 SVG 
lesions also were not significant (data not shown). There was also no significant between-group 
difference in the primary outcome after adjustment for baseline imbalance in SVG age (less than 
versus at least the median age of 13∙5 years). The results for TVF were consistent in subgroups 
defined by demographic, clinical, lesion, and procedural characteristics (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).  Also, adding stent assignment to the proportional hazards model 
with participant and graft characteristics as covariates did not significantly increase the model’s 
predictive ability (p = 0∙837) of TVF at 12 months.  
Analyses of the 12-month incidence of TVF with noncardiac death as a competing risk, 
target vessel or indeterminate MI with any death as a competing risk, and TVR with any death as 
 18 
 
a competing risk showed no significant effects from stent assignment on any cause-specific 
hazard.  
 
There were no significant between-group differences in the 12-month incidence of all-
cause death, any myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, stroke, or other 
secondary outcomes (Table 2 and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).  
 
Median length of follow-up was 2.7 years with 68% (406 of 597) of the participants 
followed for at least two years and 39% (235 of 597) followed for at least three years. Over the 
entire length of follow-up (median: 2.7 years), the incidence of TVF was 37%% (108 of 292) in 
the DES group and 34%% (105 of 305) in the BMS group (adjusted hazard ratio 1∙101, 95% 
confidence intervals [CI] 0∙845 to 1∙435, P=0∙446) (Table 3 and Figure S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome after 
adjustment for baseline imbalance in SVG age (<13∙5 years versus ≥13∙5), and tThe results for 
TVF over the entire follow-up were consistent in subgroups defined by demographic, clinical, 
lesion, and procedural characteristics (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A test using 
piecewise constant hazard ratios for the time periods up to before and after one year of follow-up 
versus after one year showedThere was no significant evidence of non-proportionalconstant 
hazards (Grambsch-Therneau test p=0∙08).  In a post-hoc analysis, there was no significant 
between-group difference in the primary outcome after adjustment for baseline imbalance in 
SVG age (<13∙5 years versus ≥13∙5). 
 
There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of all-cause death, 
myocardial infarction during follow-up, definite or probable stent thrombosis, stroke, or other 
secondary outcomes (Table 3 and Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were also 
no differences in the percent of participants reporting one or more serious adverse events overall 
 19 
 
and by classification using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; Tables 
S3 and S4 in the Supplemental Appendix). Most patients requiring repeat revascularizations 
were performed in patients who presented with an acute coronary syndrome (70%% [(133 of 
191])) or stable angina (24%% [(46 of 191])). 
 
A post-hoc analysis for the combination of TVF and/or SVG occlusion that was 
intervened upon showed no difference between treatment groups at 12 months (Table 2) and 
during the entire duration of follow-up (Table 3).  
DISCUSSION 
In DIVA, we did not find a significant difference between DES and BMS in the incidence 
of the combined endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel 
revascularization during the first 12 months and over the entire length of follow-up (median: 2∙7 
years) among patients undergoing stenting of de novo SVG lesions.  There was also no 
difference in the risk for stent thrombosis or bleeding. DIVA was the first trial of SVG stenting 
to use stent type blinding and the second that did not mandate angiographic follow-up, which is 
known to increase the rates of repeat revascularization in favor of DES.25 DIVA had higher use 
of embolic protection devices (69%% [(409 of 597])) than any prior SVG stenting trial. 
Our findings are in contrast with the findings of three11-13 of the four randomised-
controlled trials performed to date that showed benefit with DES over BMS in SVGs. The “Is 
Drug-Eluting-Stenting Associated with Improved Results in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts?” 
(ISAR-CABG) trial randomised 610 participants to a first generation DES or a BMS and 
reported lower 12-month incidence of TVR in the DES group (7% vs. 13%, p=0∙01), and no 
significant differences in all-cause mortality, MI, and definite or probable stent thrombosis as 
compared with BMS.12 ISAR-CABG had planned angiographic follow-up as did two smaller 
 20 
 
studies: the first study showed harm (higher mortality with DES at 3 years [29% vs. 0%, 
p=0∙001],9 although most deaths were due to non-cardiac causes) and similar TVR in both 
groups. The second study showed lower risk for myocardial infarction and target lesion 
revascularization with DES.10,11 The most recent trial (Basel Kosten Effektivitäts Trial – 
SAphenous Venous Graft Angioplasty Using Glycoprotein 2b/3a Receptor Inhibitors and Drug-
Eluting Stents [BASKET-SAVAGE]), randomised 173 patients, had no planned angiographic 
follow-up, and revealed lower incidence of TVR in the DES group (4∙5% vs. 19∙1% at 3 years, 
p<0∙001).13 The lack of improved outcomes with DES in DIVA was observed despite using 
second generation DES in 88%% (256 of 292) of the DES group patients, whereas first 
generation DES were used in all prior studies.9,11-13  
The lack of benefit with DES in DIVA could be related to the different pathophysiology 
of SVG atherosclerosis (more concentric and diffuse with less well defined fibrous cap) 
compared with native coronary artery atherosclerosis.26,27 It could also be due to the large burden 
of comorbidities among prior CABG patients,.14 or the use of thin-strut bare metal stents that 
may have lower risk for restenosis as compared with thicker strut stents that were used in prior 
SVG PCI studies. 9,11-13 It is unlikely to be due to differences in stenting technique and 
concomitant medications, since those characteristics were similar in both groups. Unknown 
confounders could have played a role, but are unlikely given randomization. The study results 
have important economic implications in countries with high DES prices such as the US, as they 
suggest that the lower cost BMS can be used in SVG lesions without compromising either safety 
or efficacy. The financial implications of the study may differ between countries, depending on 
local stent pricing. An alternative treatment approach would be to recanalize the native coronary 
 21 
 
artery instead of the diseased SVG,4,28 although such interventions can be technically 
challenging.29,30  
Our study has limitations. As is typical in VA studies, nearly all study participants were 
men, limiting extrapolation of the results to women, although most patients undergoing PCI after 
CABG are men.31 The interventionalists performing the index SVG PCI were not blinded to the 
type of stent used, although the patients, clinicians, and event adjudicators were blinded. The 
study was stopped before completion of the revised enrollment target, yet the number of patients 
recruited was greater than originally planned and the post-hoc power (86%) was similar to the 
pre-hoc power (90%) to detect the originally hypothesized hazard ratio 0∙ .556.  
In summary, in our evaluation of the clinical outcomes of 597 patients undergoing PCI of 
de novo SVG lesions, we found no significant difference in the 12-month and long-term 
(median: 2∙7 years) incidence of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target 
vessel revascularization.
