Skin and soft tissue infections are common and frequently recur. Poor adherence to antibiotic therapy may lead to suboptimal
clinical outcomes. However, adherence to oral antibiotic therapy for skin and soft tissue infections and its relationship to clinical
outcomes have not been examined. We enrolled adult patients hospitalized with uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections
caused by Staphylococcus aureus who were being discharged with oral antibiotics to complete therapy. We fit the participants’
pill bottles with an electronic bottle cap that recorded each pill bottle opening, administered an in-person standardized ques-
tionnaire at enrollment, 14 days, and 30 days, and reviewed the participants’ medical records to determine outcomes. Our pri-
mary outcome was poor clinical response, defined as a change in antibiotic therapy, new incision-and-drainage procedure, or
new skin infection within 30 days of hospital discharge. Of our 188 participants, 87 had complete data available for analysis.
Among these participants, 40 (46%) had a poor clinical response at 30 days. The mean electronically measured adherence to anti-
biotic therapy was significantly different than the self-reported adherence (57% versus 96%; P < 0.0001). In a multivariable
model, poor clinical response at 30 days was associated with patients having lower adherence, being nondiabetic, and reporting a
lack of illicit drug use within the previous 12 months (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we found that patient adherence to oral antibi-
otic therapy for a skin and soft tissue infection after hospital discharge was low (57%) and associated with poor clinical outcome.
Patients commonly overstate their medication adherence, which may make identification of patients at risk for nonadherence
and poor outcomes challenging. Further studies are needed to improve postdischarge antibiotic adherence after skin and soft
tissue infections.
S
kin infections are a common reason for physician visits and
hospital admission (1, 2). Staphylococcus aureus is the most
common cause of skin infections in the community (3, 4). Recur-
rent and/or relapse skin infections are commonly reported after
an initial S. aureus skin infection (5–7). Rates of recurrence have
exceeded 50% in some populations (5, 8, 9).
Reasons for the failure of a skin infection to resolve are poorly
understood but are likely to be due to host and behavior factors,
inadequate medical and/or surgical therapy, and possibly patho-
gen-associated factors (10). In other chronic and acute infections,
medication adherence is frequently suboptimal and associated
with worse clinical outcomes (11–13). However, there are no
studies to date evaluating antibiotic adherence, or the relationship
between adherence and clinical outcome, among patients experi-
encing skin infections.
Pooradherencetomedicationregimensiscommonacrossalldis-
ease entities. Low adherence contributes to a worsening of the pa-
tient’s condition, death, and increased health care costs (14). Even in
clinical trials, where study participants receive increased support,
mean reported adherence rates are 43 to 78% (14). Other investiga-
tions addressing adherence among patients taking antibiotics have
found adherence rates of 57 to 78% by patient report (15, 16). Anti-
biotic treatment of S. aureus skin infections has unique challenges.
Antibiotics for skin infections are typically taken two to four times
daily for 1 to 2 weeks, and side effects such as gastrointestinal symp-
toms are common (17, 18). Both high dosing frequency and adverse
drug effects are associated with lower medication adherence (14).
We hypothesized that patients with lower rates of adherence to
their antibiotic regimen will have poor clinical outcomes. To ex-
amine adherence to and the subsequent clinical outcome of the
prescribed antibiotic regimen after hospital discharge among pa-
tients experiencing a S. aureus skin infection, we enrolled patients
and monitored them to determine their antibiotic adherence and
clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design. This prospective cohort investigation took place at Harbor-
UCLA Medical Center, a 400-bed tertiary-care county hospital, from No-
vember 2009 to March 2012. Potentially eligible patients were identified
via daily screening of microbiology laboratory results for S. aureus-posi-
tive wound cultures by research coordinators. Adult patients were eligible
for the study if (i) they had a confirmed S. aureus skin infection without
bacteremia, osteomyelitis, or endocarditis or a hardware-associated infec-

 tion, (ii) the infection occurred �72 h after admission to the medical
center, and (iii) the treating team planned to discharge the patient on oral
antibiotic therapy for S. aureus for up to 2 weeks. This investigation was
approved by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-
UCLA Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Study visits. Participants completed an in-person study visit at enroll-
ment and 14 days postdischarge and a phone visit at 30 days postdis-
charge. At each visit, a standardized instrument that used questions from
a previously reported investigation of risk factors for skin infections was
used to assess risk factors for relapse or recurrent infection as well as
self-reported adherence (9, 19). The survey was based on previous surveys
used for measuring adherence to treatment for infectious diseases (20).
Predictors of nonadherence were based on established conceptual models
of adherence (14, 21).
Data collection. Upon hospital discharge, the oral antibiotic pre-
scribed to continue treatment of the participant’s S. aureus infection was
placed into a pill bottle fitted with a Medication Event Monitoring System
(MEMS) electronic bottle cap. The MEMS cap measures the date and time
each time that the pill bottle is opened or closed (22). The MEMS cap
was collected and information was downloaded at the day 14 visit for
analysis. Antibiotic treatment was determined by the participants’
treating providers.
A study physician blind to the adherence results conducted a review of
the participants’ medical records. The initial hospitalization was reviewed
to confirm eligibility criteria and discharge medications. Data on subse-
quent hospitalizations, clinic visits, and microbiology results were col-
lected during the 30 days of follow-up for the study.
Data analysis. The primary outcome was clinical response after 30
days of follow-up, with poor clinical response being defined as the pres-
ence of any of the following events, as determined by patient report and/or
review of the medical chart: (i) relapse of skin infection, (ii) new skin
infection, (iii) receipt of prolonged antibiotic therapy for skin infection,
(iv) receipt of new antibiotic therapy or change in therapy for skin infec-
tion, or (v) new incision-and-drainage procedure. Patients were consid-
ered to have prolonged antibiotic therapy if the provider deemed it nec-
essary to extend the duration of therapy beyond that originally anticipated
at the follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes of interest included (i) clinical
response after 14 days of follow-up using the same definition of poor
clinical response as that for the primary outcome, (ii) predictors of adher-
ence to antibiotic therapy, and (iii) evaluation of the participants’ atti-
tudes and beliefs in regard to taking antibiotics.
Adherence was calculated based on the proportions of prescribed
medications that were taken, based on opening of MEMS caps. For exam-
ple, if 27 bottle openings occurred and 28 doses were prescribed, adher-
ence was 27/28 or 96.4%. However, we considered a dose to be taken only
if bottle opening occurred during a proper dose timing interval specific to
the dosing frequency of the prescribed medication (e.g., twice daily or
three times daily). Specifically, participants were categorized as being ad-
herent to a prescribed antibiotic if they opened the electronic bottle cap
within 67% of the prescribed dosing interval. The basis for applying this
percentage was to avoid overcalculations of compliance for patients who
may have opened the bottle cap within a few minutes of time. The follow-
ing time frames after a prior dose were used to determine that the dose was
properly taken (adherent): intervals of 12 � 4 h for a twice-daily antibi-
otic, 8 � 2 h 40 min for a three-times-daily antibiotic, and 6 � 2 h for a
four-times-daily antibiotic. If participants continued to open their pill
bottle beyond the specified duration of therapy, the later doses were not
included in the adherence calculation.
Prior to study commencement, we estimated power calculations to
achieve 80% power to detect a 10% difference in adherence between treat-
ment outcomes (responders versus nonresponders). The power calcula-
tions assumed a significance level of an � value of 0.05 with 90% and 80%
adherence rates between treatment outcomes. We also assumed a stan-
dard deviation of a delta value of 0.15 and a ratio of responders to nonre-
sponders of 0.489, based on previous studies using MEMS-based adher-
ence and treatment outcomes of patients with skin infections (6, 23).
Using these assumptions, we estimated that we would need 84 partici-
pants to detect a difference in clinical outcomes between groups.
Data analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
USA). Bivariate analysis was used to compare variables from the risk fac-
tor questionnaire hypothesized to be associated with poor clinical re-
sponse. Bivariate analyses were assessed by using odds ratios (ORs), 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), and the associated P values. All variables with a
P value of �0.20 in the bivariate analysis were included in a multivariate
logistic regression analysis predicting poor clinical response. Multicolin-
earity for the logistic regression model was assessed by condition indices
and variance decomposition proportions using a macro developed for use
with the SAS system. Backwards elimination was performed by using the
likelihood ratio test to find the best model. Models were examined for
goodness of fit by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. Linear regression
was utilized to examine predictors from the risk factor questionnaire hy-
pothesized to be associated with adherence. Mean adherence rates, stan-
dard deviations, and the associated P values were calculated. All variables
were considered significant at an � value of 0.05.
RESULTS
Among the 188 participants who consented to be in the study, 87
(46%) were confirmed as being eligible and returned the MEMS
cap to study personnel. Of the 101 participants not included in the
analysis, the reasons for exclusion were as follows: they met exclu-
sion criteria of bacteremia (1 participant), osteomyelitis (15 par-
ticipants), or hardware- or device-associated infection (9 partici-
pants); were discharged without oral antibiotics (31 participants);
did not have a confirmed diagnosis of S. aureus skin infection
(7 participants); did not use or return the MEMS cap (31 partici-
pants); and discontinued participation prior to discharge (7 par-
ticipants). Among the 87 participants included in the analysis,
71% were male, with an average age of 43 years, and 44% of the
participants were of Hispanic ethnicity (Table 1).
The mean rate of adherence to antibiotic therapy using MEMS
data was 57%, which was different from a self-reported adherence
rate of 96% (P � 0.0001) (Fig. 1). Common reasons reported for
missed doses were as follows: the participant was away from home
(32%), was asleep when a dose was supposed to be taken (14%), or
forgot to take the dose (14%); the medication made the partici-
pant feel sick (12%); and there were too many pills to take (11%).
Participants also reported that the most common reminder
method used was taking the medication(s) with meals (74%). Ta-
ble 2 shows factors analyzed for their association with adherence.
Poor adherence was associated with participants being discharged
with more than one antibiotic (P � 0.01), not seeing the same
health care provider for care (P � 0.02), and not feeling that they
had a regular health care provider (P � 0.05). Appropriate anti-
biotic therapy was prescribed for 85 (98%) patients. There was 1
patient in the poor-clinical-response group and 1 patient in the
successful-response group who received inappropriate antibiotic
therapy according to culture and susceptibility data (P � 0.99).
Forty participants (46%) experienced a poor clinical response
in the study. Poor clinical responses were due to the following: a
relapse of skin infection (9/40; 22.5%); a new skin infection (12/
40; 30%); receipt of prolonged antibiotic therapy, receipt of new
antibiotic therapy, or change in therapy for skin infection (16/40;
40%); and a new incision-and-drainage procedure (3/40; 7.5%).
In our bivariate analysis, lower adherence trended toward a sig-
nificant association with poor clinical response (P � 0.06) (Table
1). In the multivariable analysis, lower adherence was an indepen-
dent risk factor for poor clinical outcome (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.02

(OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.0; P � 0.05) and lack of illicit drug use
in the previous 12 months (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.99; P �
0.048) were also independent risk factors for poor clinical out-
come. Results for the clinical response at 14 days were similar to
those at 30 days (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Skin infections are a common clinical problem resulting in sub-
stantial clinical morbidity, hospitalization, and cost (1, 2, 24). In
this study, postdischarge adherence to antibiotic therapy for S.
aureus skin infection was low (57%) and associated with poor
clinical outcome. This low adherence contrasted with the high
levels of adherence (96%) that participants reported in a confi-
dential interview. Poor clinical outcome was independently asso-
ciated with relapse or recurrent infection. While the number of
relapse/recurrent infections among the cohort is worrisome, these
numbers are, however, consistent with data for other cohorts in
which recurrent infection after methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) or S. aureus infection exceeded 50% (5, 8). Our data
suggest that adherence may explain some of the relapses that occur
among patients with skin infections.
Poor adherence to antibiotic therapy is a common problem
that is highlighted in this investigation. While ours is the first
investigation to examine the association between clinical outcome
and adherence among patients with a skin infection, other studies
have reported similarly low adherence to antibiotic regimens. In a
French study of 37 patients with a variety of different infections
who were being discharged with antibiotics after hospitalization,
43% reported nonadherence to the prescribed antibiotic regimen
(15). Another European investigation among patients with acute
cough who were prescribed outpatient antibiotics found that 30%
of patients reported that they did not consume any antibiotics and
that only 44% reported consuming the entire prescribed treat-
ment course (25). Similarly, a study of patients in Portugal re-
ported a rate of adherence to oral antibiotics in community phar-
macies of 58% (26). A meta-analysis of community-based
antibiotics found that the mean rate of adherence was 62.2% (95%
CI, 56.4 to 68.0%) (26).
In our investigation, poor adherence was associated with pa-
tients being discharged with more than one antibiotic, not seeing
the same health care provider for care, and not feeling that they
had a regular health care provider. These data are consistent with
previously reported theoretical constructs and empirical data (14,
21, 27). Other studies found that poor adherence was associated
with a higher number of daily doses of the antibiotic (16, 28–30),
longer antibiotic treatment duration (25, 26, 28), increasing age,
difficulty in buying the antibiotic, duration of treatment, difficulty
with ingestion, and satisfaction with the information given by the
physician (26).

 cough based on patient-reported adherence (25). This lack of as-
sociation may be based on the fact that antibiotics for bronchitis
have no effect on clinical outcome in the majority of patients with
bronchitis (31). Our investigation also found that better adher-
ence was associated with diabetes and illicit drug use. While the
reason why these two groups may have better adherence is not
clear, we hypothesize that the relationship may stem from the
fact that these groups of patients frequently experience skin
infections and may be more knowledgeable about the impor-
tance of taking their antibiotics as prescribed. Alternatively,
clinicians may have known that these factors were associated
with worse outcomes and may have treated the patients more
conservatively in the hospital, thus discharging them when
they had a less severe skin infection than those of patients with-
out diabetes or illicit drug use.
Methods to improve adherence for acute infections are rela-
tively understudied. Health care providers can enhance adherence
by discussing the value of completing the regimen with their pa-
tient, making the regimen simple, and customizing the regimen
to the patient’s lifestyle. One recent randomized trial suggested
that medication counseling may improve adherence to antibi-
otics (32), but larger studies are needed. New methods of man-
aging chronic diseases, such as text message reminders and
smart phone applications, have had success in improving ad-
herence (33); however, these innovations have not been uti-
lized in the management of acute infections. Newer longer-
acting antibiotics have recently been approved for the treatment of
skin infections, such as dalbavancin and oritavancin, which are
dosed one weekly (34, 35). The use of these antibiotics may
alleviate challenges associated with adherence to antibiotic
therapy for patients for whom this is an appropriate treatment
option. However, their ability to improve outcomes over oral
therapy is unproven at this time.
There are some limitations to our investigation. The adherence
data analyzed were collected by using electronic bottle caps. Cap
openings do not always necessarily correspond to the actual med-
ication being taken. Participants may have removed multiple
doses at one cap opening in order to put them into pillboxes, in
which case the cap openings underestimate actual adherence
(36). Additionally, the participants were enrolled from a single
center, and findings may not be generalizable to other popula-
tions. However, the patient population at our institution is
similar to those of many community hospitals and is ethnically
diverse. We also relied on participants to self-report social risk
factors. Participants may be reticent to acknowledge less so-
cially acceptable risk factors such as incarceration or illicit sub-
stance use. Nevertheless, in a previous investigation at this
institution using this instrument, risk factors that may be con-
sidered socially undesirable were significantly associated with
MRSA risk (37), suggesting that the survey has validity and
limited bias.
There are strengths to our investigation. First, this is the first
study to examine the association between clinical outcome and
adherence to antibiotic therapy postdischarge among patients
hospitalized with a skin infection. This is also the first investiga-
tion to find an association between adherence to postdischarge
antibiotic therapy and poor clinical outcome. Second, our mea-
sure of adherence was strong, as we employed electronic bottle
caps to measure adherence. This measure is superior to self-re-
porting, pill counts, and pharmacy records as it correlates better
with clinical outcomes (36). Third, we studied only participants
with S. aureus-associated skin infection, a condition known to
have a high rate of recurrence of infection (5, 8). This high rate
provided reasonable power to examine the relationship between
infection and clinical outcome. Finally, we used a theoretical con-
struct to examine factors associated with medication adherence.
Most other investigations have focused on clinical factors and did
not measure participants’ beliefs and attitudes, which may be im-
portant predictors of adherence (38, 39).
In conclusion, we found that low adherence to postdischarge
antibiotic therapy after hospitalization for skin infection was as-
sociated with a higher chance of clinical failure. Patients typically
overstate their medication adherence, which may make identifi-
cation of those at risk for nonadherence and poor outcomes
challenging. Further studies are needed to determine methods
to improve antibiotic adherence and clinical outcomes after
hospitalization for a skin infection.
