Abstract
Background: Lack of association between fat intake and breast
cancer risk in cohort studies might be attributed to the disregard of
temporal effects during adolescence when breasts develop and are
particularly sensitive to stimuli. We prospectively examined asso-
ciations between adolescent fat intakes and breast density.
Method: Among 177 women who participated in the Dietary
Intervention Study in Children, dietary intakes at ages 10–18 years
were assessed on five occasions by 24-hour recalls and averaged.
We calculated geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals for
MRI-measured breast density at ages 25–29 years across quartiles
of fat intake using linear mixed-effect regression.
Results: Comparing women in the extreme quartiles of ado-
lescent fat intakes, percent dense breast volume (%DBV) was
positively associated with saturated fat (mean ¼ 16.4% vs. 21.5%;
Ptrend < 0.001). Conversely, %DBV was inversely associated with
monounsaturated fat (25.0% vs. 15.8%; Ptrend < 0.001) and the
ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (P/S ratio; 19.1% vs.
14.3%; Ptrend < 0.001). When examining intake by pubertal stages,
%DBV was inversely associated with intake of polyunsaturated fat
(20.8% vs. 16.4%; Ptrend ¼ 0.04), long-chain omega-3 fat (17.8%
vs. 15.8%; Ptrend < 0.001), and P/S ratio (22.5% vs. 16.1%; Ptrend <
0.001) before menarche, but not after. These associations
observed with %DBV were consistently observed with absolute
dense breast volume but not with absolute nondense breast
volume.
Conclusions: In our study, adolescent intakes of higher
saturated fat and lower mono- and polyunsaturated fat are
associated with higher breast density measured approximately
15 years later.
Impact: The fat subtype composition in adolescent diet
may be important in early breast cancer prevention. Cancer

Introduction
Although studied extensively, the association between diet and
breast cancer remains unsettled. In pooled analyses of eight
prospective cohort studies (1) and randomized controlled trials
(2, 3), little association was observed between total and subtypes
of fat intakes during adulthood and breast cancer risk, despite
positive associations observed in ecologic (4, 5) and animal
studies (6). Associations with the risk of breast cancer subtypes
also have been inconsistent (7, 8). However, breast tissue is most
sensitive to stimuli during adolescence (9), when breasts develop
and undergo structural changes (10–12). Little is known whether
early-life fat intake affects breast development or morphology,
which may, in part, mediate breast cancer risk later in life.
Breast density is a measure of the relative amount of glandular
and stromal tissue in the breasts, and is a strong risk factor for
breast cancer (13, 14). Dietary fat intake was reported to affect
endogenous hormones (15, 16), which regulates ductal morpho-
genesis during puberty (12). Pubertal high-fat diets in rats altered
cellular proliferation and breast tissue composition (17, 18), and
induced abnormal breast lesions (18, 19). The few studies that
examined associations of early-life fat intake with breast density
reported null results (20, 21). Still, these studies were limited by
recall of diet in the distant past, and no investigation of fat
subtypes and pubertal stages. In the Dietary Intervention Study
in Children (DISC), children with elevated levels of blood cho-
lesterol who were randomized to a reduced fat diet for 7 years had
similar breast density in their 20s to children randomized to the
control group who consumed usual diets (22), though variation
in fat intake between groups was modest.
Therefore, utilizing adolescent dietary data collected repeatedly
in the DISCtrial (23,24) and breastdensity measured bymagnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) at age 25–29 years in the DISC06
Follow-Up Study (22, 25), we expanded our initial analyses and
prospectively evaluated associations between breast density and
reported total and subtypes of fat intakes during adolescence and
at specific pubertal stages.

 (LDL-C; refs. 26, 27). Between 1988 and 1990, healthy, prepu-
bertal, 8- to 10-year-old girls (N ¼ 301) and boys (N ¼ 362) with
elevated LDL-C were randomized to a reduced-fat diet interven-
tion or a usual-care control group in six clinical centers until 1997
(27). Between 2006 and 2008, the DISC06 Follow-Up Study was
conducted among female DISC participants ages 25–29 years to
assess the long-term effect of the diet intervention during child-
hood and adolescence on breast cancer–related biomarkers (22).
Assent from participants and informed consent from parents or
guardians were obtained prior to randomization and informed
consent was obtained from participants before the DISC06 Fol-
low-Up Study. The institutional review boards at participating
centers approved original and follow-up DISC protocols.
Of 260 women who participated in the DISC06 Follow-Up
Study, women who were pregnant or breastfeeding within 12
weeks before the follow-up visit (N ¼ 30), had breast augmen-
tation or reduction surgery (N ¼ 16), had unacceptable or missing
breast density data (N ¼ 32), or were without dietary data during
the DISC trial (N ¼ 5) were excluded. Consequently, this analysis
includes 177 women.
Data collection
Participants completed questionnaires on demographics, life-
style, physical activity, medication use, and reproductive, men-
strual, and medical history at baseline and at follow-up visits in
the DISC trial and the DISC06 Follow-Up Study. Height and
weight were measured (25). Childhood BMI z-score was calcu-
lated on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2000 Growth Charts (28). In DISC06, whole-body percent fat was
estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (25). During the
DISC trial, sexual maturation was evaluated annually by ascer-
taining onset of menses and conducting a physical examination
including Tanner staging (29).
Diet at baseline, year 1, 3, and 5 and last visits during the
DISC trial and at DISC06 follow-up visits was assessed via three
nonconsecutive 24-hour dietary recalls obtained on two week-
days and one weekend day over two weeks (30, 31). Trained,
certified nutritionists conducted face-to-face interviews during
clinic visits and two subsequent recalls were obtained via
telephone. Parents provided additional details, if needed.
Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of Minnesota
estimated nutrient intake from 24-hour recalls using their food
and nutrient database (version 20). Nutrient intakes from
recalls were averaged to estimate usual dietary intake. Records
with implausible energy intakes (<600 kcal/day or >3,500 kcal/
day; N ¼ 7) were set to missing (32). Energy intakes from each
type of fat or protein were divided by total energy intake to
calculate percent energy from those nutrients. The correlations
between 24-hour recalls and dietary records collected on a
subset of participants were 0.73 for total fat, 0.64 for saturated
fat, 0.78 for monounsaturated fat, and 0.64 for polyunsaturat-
ed fat (33).
Breast density was measured by noncontrast MRI (22), because
MRI avoids radiation exposure, and provides three-dimensional
volumetric measurements of breast composition that is reported
by some to be more predictive of breast cancer risk (34) and is also
not impaired by high breast density typical of young women. Even
so, percent breast density measured by MRI is highly correlated
with mammographic measurements (r > 0.75; refs. 35, 36).
Breasts were imaged with a whole-body 1.5 Tesla or higher
field-strength MRI scanner with a dedicated breast-imaging radio-
frequency coil. All MRI image data were processed by Dr. C. Klifa
(University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA), who
identified chest wall–breast tissue boundary and skin surface, and
separated breast fibroglandular and fatty tissue via automated
fuzzy C-means method (37). MRI technologists were trained to
recognize and correct failures. Each DISC clinic was certified after
obtaining acceptable images from three volunteers.
We measured total breast volume and absolute dense breast
fibroglandular volume (ADBV) for each breast. Absolute non-
dense breast volume (ANDBV) was estimated by subtracting
ADBV from total breast volume. Percent dense breast volume
(%DBV) was calculated as the ratio of ADBV to total breast
volume. Breast density measures for both breasts were averaged
for analysis.
Statistical analyses
Our primary exposure was long-term fat intake during adoles-
cence estimated by averaging reported intakes (38) over the course
of the DISC trial. We also estimated fat intakes separately by
menarche status as breasts' susceptibility to stimuli might vary
during pubertal transition (10, 39–41). Specifically, we averaged
fat intakes from age 10 years, the approximate age of onset of
breast development (42, 43), to the last DISC trial visit (median
age ¼ 16.6 years) to estimate overall adolescent intake, from age
10 years to the onset of menarche to estimate premenarcheal
intake, and thereafter to the last DISC trial visit to estimate
postmenarcheal intake.
%DBV, ADBV, and ANDBV values were log-transformed to
approximate normality. We imputed missing values of whole-
body percent fat (N ¼ 6) using values from a prediction model
that included adult BMI as an independent variable; this process
was repeated 25 times to create 25 multiply imputed datasets. The
correlation coefficient between imputed whole-body percent fat
and adult BMI ranged from 0.74 to 0.99 across the imputed
datasets, which compared favorably to a correlation of 0.82 based
on actual data. In each imputed dataset, the geometric mean and
the 95% confidence interval for %DBV, ADBV, and ANDBV were
calculated across fat intake quartiles using linear mixed-effects
regression models with robust SEs. To adjust for potential con-
founders known to be associated with breast cancer risk, breast
density, and fat intake (1, 25, 44), fully adjusted multivariable
models included the following predictors, race, education, child-
hood BMI z-score, adulthood whole-body percent fat, duration of
hormone use, number of live births, smoking status, and intakes
of total calories, protein, fiber, and alcohol as fixed effects; clinic
was included as a random effect; other types of fat were simul-
taneously adjusted for in analyses of specific types of fat (38).
Trends across quartile medians modeled as continuous variables
were tested using the Wald test statistic. Interactions of fat intake
by intervention assignment, hormone use, and whole-body per-
cent fat were tested in the model including cross-product terms.
Results from the fully adjusted multivariable model in each
imputed dataset were pooled using Rubin's rule (45).
Analyses were conducted by STATA (version 13.0). All tests
were two-sided and done at the 0.05 level of significance.
Results
In our analyses of 177 women, the mean percent energy from
total and major subtypes of fat intakes during adolescence at age
10–18 years were 29.7% for total fat, 10.8% for saturated fat,

 10.9% for monounsaturated fat, and 5.8% for polyunsaturated
fat (Table 1). In the DISC06 Follow-Up Study when breast
density was measured, participants' mean age was 27.2 years
and their mean BMI was 25.4 kg/m2. The majority of women
were White (91%) and nulliparous (72%), had attended at least
college (91%), and ever used hormonal contraceptives (94%).
The median of breast density measures (interquartile ranges)
were 24.3% (9.7%–41.2%) for %DBV, 93.6 cm3 (50.0–140.3
cm3) for ADBV, and 299.2 cm3 (157.8–484.9 cm3) for ANDBV.
Fat intakes at the DISC06 follow-up visit are shown in Sup-
plementary Table S1.
We present results only from the fully adjusted multivariable
model because associations of fat intakes with breast density
measures were similar from the simpler model adjusting for
adult whole body percent fat, treatment assignment, and intake
of total energy and protein (data not shown). Intake of satu-
rated fat was significantly positively, whereas monounsaturated
fat and the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (P/S
ratio) were significantly inversely associated with %DBV (all
Ptrend < 0.001; Table 2). Comparing women in the extreme
quartiles of each fat subtype or P/S ratio (Q1–Q4), the mul-
tivariable-adjusted mean %DBV increased from 16.4% to
21.5% for saturated fat, while it decreased from 25.0% to
15.8% for monounsaturated fat and from 19.1% to 14.3% for
the P/S ratio.
When we examined intakes before and after menarche
(refs. 10, 39–41; Table 2), premenarcheal, but not postme-
narcheal, intakes of polyunsaturated fat (Ptrend ¼ 0.04) and
long-chain omega-3 fat (Ptrend < 0.001) and the P/S ratio (Ptrend
< 0.001) were significantly inversely associated with %DBV. The
multivariable-adjusted mean %DBV decreased from 20.8% to
16.4% for polyunsaturated fat, from 17.8% to 15.8% for long-
chain omega-3 fat, and from 22.5% to 16.1% for the P/S ratio
when comparing women in the lowest and the highest quartiles
for each fat. Total fat and linoleic acid intakes during adoles-
cence or during pre- or postmenarche periods were not asso-
ciated with %DBV.
Because variation of fat intakes and the P/S ratio was relatively
modest, particularly among women in the lower quartiles, we
conducted sensitivity analyses categorizing fat intakes and the P/S
ratio into tertiles to improve contrasts (data not shown). The
linear inverse trend with %DBV became clearer. For example, the
multivariable-adjusted mean %DBV decreased monotonically
from 20.9% to 18.4% and 17.0% for monounsaturated fat and
from 21.8% to 18.6% and 16.2% for the P/S ratio with increasing
tertiles.
Additional adjustment for adult fat intakes or restricting anal-
yses to nulliparous women did not change results substantially
(data not shown). Treatment assignment, whole-body percent fat,
and hormone use did not statistically significantly modify asso-
ciations between total or subtypes of fat intakes and %DBV (all
Pinteraction � 0.11).
When examining associations separately for individual com-
ponents of breast tissue that compose %DBV (Tables 3 and 4),
the associations observed with %DBV were generally seen with
ADBV, although results for polyunsaturated fat were not sig-
nificant. Comparing extreme quartiles (Q1–Q4) of each sub-
type of fat intake or the P/S ratio, the multivariable-adjusted
mean ADBV increased from 65.6 cm3 to 97.4 cm3 for saturated
fat (Ptrend ¼ 0.03), whereas it decreased from 105.4 cm3 to 69.0
cm3 for monounsaturated fat (Ptrend ¼ 0.05) as well as for
premenarcheal long-chain omega-3 fat (from 76.6 cm3 to 65.5
cm3; Ptrend < 0.001) and P/S ratio (from 85.1 cm3 to 71.8 cm3;
Ptrend < 0.002). In contrast, ANDBV was significantly positively
associated with premenarcheal intakes of polyunsaturated fat
(Ptrend ¼ 0.01), linoleic acid (Ptrend ¼ 0.02), and the P/S ratio
(Ptrend < 0.001). The multivariable-adjusted mean ANDBV
increased from 260.8 cm3 to 324.1 cm3 for polyunsaturated

Discussion
In this prospective analysis, adolescent total fat intake was
not significantly associated with %DBV, ADBV, or ANDBV.
However, adolescent intake of saturated fat was significantly
positively associated, while monounsaturated fat was signifi-
cantly inversely associated with %DBV and ADBV but not with
ANDBV. When examining intakes by pubertal stages, preme-
narcheal intakes of polyunsaturated fat and long-chain omega-
3 fat, and the P/S ratio were significantly inversely associated
with %DBV. Intake of long-chain omega-3 fat also was signif-
icantly inversely associated with ADBV, whereas polyunsatu-
rated fat was significantly positively associated with ANDBV.
The P/S ratio was significantly inversely associated with ADBV
and positively with ANDBV. No postmenarcheal fat intakes
were associated with %DBV, ADBV, or ANDBV.

 The null association we observed between total fat intake and
%DBV is largely consistent with previous evidence. Of eight
cross-sectional studies of adult women (46–53), total fat intake
was not associated with breast density in six (46, 47, 50–53),
whereas two found significant positive associations (48, 49).
Similarly, high-fat food consumption during childhood was
not associated with breast density in adulthood (20, 21). In two
(22, 54) of three randomized controlled trials (22, 54, 55),
women assigned to a low-fat diet in adolescence (22) or midlife
(54) had similar breast density to women assigned to a usual
diet, although another found a significant difference in breast
density (55).
Nonetheless, fatty acids have unique chemical and biophysical
properties (56, 57) and varying physiologic functions (58–61).
Examining only total fat intakes may mask specific effects of each
subtype of fat on breasts. Indeed, in our data, saturated fat and
unsaturated fat intakes, such as mono- and polyunsaturated fat,
particularly from long-chain omega-3 fat, had opposing associa-
tions with %DBV. Our significant positive association of saturated
fat with %DBV is consistent with three studies (46, 48, 62),

 although others have reported no associations (47, 50, 52) or
significant inverse associations (53). Contrary to the inverse
associations, we observed with unsaturated fat intake, most
studies of adult women found no significant association between
breast density and intakes of monounsaturated fat (47, 48, 50,
53, 62), polyunsaturated fat (46–48, 50, 53), or omega-3 fat (48),
while one found significant positive association with monoun-
saturated fat (49).
The stronger associations observed for specific subtypes of fat in
our study, compared with previous studies of adult women, might
be attributed to the early-life dietary assessment. Adolescence is a
critical period when mammary ducts elongate and branch (10).
These structural changes accompany rapid proliferation of undif-
ferentiated cells, which may render breasts particularly vulnerable
to any effects of fat. The degree of saturation in fatty acids
influences fluidity and structure of cell membranes, which affects
cell receptors, membrane transporters, and cellular signaling
pathways (56, 57, 63). Increasing saturated fat while decreasing
monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat, and particularly
omega-3 fat, were shown to promote proliferation, insulin

 resistance, and inflammation, and to depress cellular responses to
DNA damage and apoptosis (60, 61, 64–67). The P/S ratio was
also inversely associated with estrogens that promote ductal
growth and proliferation (68, 69). The opposing associations of
saturated and unsaturated fats we observed with %DBV may
reflect different roles of these fats in formation and maintenance
of breast tissue.
Early-life timing when fat would most influence breast mor-
phology is unknown. Nonetheless, breast maturation during
adolescence consists of a sequence of physical changes, in which
ductal outgrowth is followed by accumulation of breast fat (10).
Recent studies underscore earlier prolonged exposures at the time
of breasts' ductal expansion, regarding early breast cancer initia-
tion (39, 40, 70). In prospective analyses, an earlier age at
thelarche (onset of breast development; ref. 39), a longer interval
between thelarche and menarche (39), and higher premenarcheal
adrenal hormone levels (40) were significantly associated with
higher breast density (40) and increased breast cancer risk (39). In
this first analysis, examining fat intakes before and after menarche
with %DBV, stronger associations observed between %DBV and
polyunsaturated fat and omega-3 fat intakes before menarche, but
not after, align with previous evidence (39, 40, 70). However, the
significant associations of saturated and monounsaturated fat
intakes with %DBV in our data were from cumulative intakes
during both pre- and postmenarche periods. Further investigation
is warranted to examine whether our results reflect true fat-
induced dynamics occurring with breast maturation.
With regard to whether our findings can be translated to later
breast cancer risk, it is worth noting that significant associations
observed between subtypes of fat and %DBV were generally also
seen with ADBV. ADBV reflects fibroglandular tissue amount,
which comprises highly proliferative structures like mammary
ducts where most tumors arise. Indeed, ADBV was more strongly
associated with breast cancer risk than %DBV in a recent cohort
study (34). Our significant results for ADBV may indicate that fat
intake alters breast tissue composition during adolescence and
potentially could influence later breast cancer risk.
Our study has some limitations. We could not examine asso-
ciations with the main food sources of saturated fat (e.g., cheese,
milk, meat) and unsaturated fats (e.g., fish, nuts, seeds; refs. 71–
75) or methods used to prepare food (76), because individual
foods and cooking methods data are not available. We had
limited intake variations for total and subtypes of fat. Nonethe-
less, percent energy range for each fat type in our study was
comparable with national data for girls of a similar age (30).
Significant inverse associations observed for unsaturated fats and
the P/S ratio with %DBV was nonlinear, possibly due to modest
intake variations in lower quartiles; for example, median daily
percent energy intakes from long-chain omega-3 fat were 0.01%
and 0.03% in second quartile and third quartile, respectively,
while the corresponding value in the highest quartile was 0.09%.
We had adequate power to detect modest associations of total fat,
saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat and lino-
leic acid intakes during adolescence with breast density measures,
but power was more limited for omega-3 fatty acids and the P:S
ratio. Although analyses and interpretation were conducted cau-
tiously with consideration of prior findings and biologic relevance
(77), concern remains about multiple testing. Ourresults could be
due to chance and warrant replication in a separate cohort.
Unknown residual confounding cannot be ruled out; however,
we comprehensively adjusted for the known possible confoun-
ders associated with both breast density and intake of fat such as
number of live births, duration of hormonal contraceptive use,
educational attainment, smoking status and alcohol consump-
tion in our full multivariable model. Similar results between
simpler and fully adjusted models suggest little confounding by
known covariates.
Nevertheless, this is the first comprehensive prospective anal-
ysis that examined the long-term effect of adolescent fat intakes on
breast density, measured approximately 15 years later. The pro-
spective design minimized recall bias of early life diet. With
multiple diet assessments, we estimated fat intakes at specific
pubertal stages, as well as long-term intake during adolescence;
averaging intake also dampened potential random measurement
errors. MRI-measured breast density is more accurate than mam-
mography for dense breasts typical of young women. We mea-
sured breast density at ages 25–29 years, which might be the most
relevant marker to assess the effect of adolescent fat intake on
breasts, because it precedes natural involution of breast tissue that
occurs with aging, and decreases breast density (78). We adjusted
for both childhood and adulthood potential confounders.
In conclusion, we observed that types of dietary fat during
adolescence were associated with adult breast density. Higher
intakes of saturated fats and lower intakes of unsaturated fats were
associated with higher %DBV and ADBV, whereas higher intakes
of unsaturated fats were associated with lower ANDBV. These
findings emphasize fat subtype composition in adolescent diets in
determining breast's morphologic characteristics and support
early risk accumulation of breast cancer. Further cohort studies
are warranted to replicate our findings, validate whether they are
independent of other components in food sources for fat, and
identify underlying mechanisms.
