Abstract
Background
Gonorrhea remains one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Suc-
cessful treatment has been hampered by emerging resistance to each of the antibiotics rec-
ommended as first-line therapies. We retrospectively analyzed the susceptibility of
gonorrhea to azithromycin and ceftriaxone using data from the China Gonococcal Resis-
tance Surveillance Programme (China-GRSP) in order to provide evidence for updating the
treatment recommendations in China.
Methods and findings
In this study, we included 3,849 isolates collected from patients with a confirmed positive
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) culture at clinic visits during the period of 1 Janu-
ary 2013 through 31 December 2016 in 7 provinces. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of
gonorrhea isolates using agar dilution was conducted to determine minimum inhibitory con-
centration (MIC). Resistance to azithromycin (RTA) was defined as MIC � 1.0 mg/l, and
decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (DSC) was defined as MIC � 0.125 mg/l. The preva-
lence of isolates with RTA was 18.6% (710/3,827; 95% CI 17.4%–19.8%). The percentage
of patients with DSC fluctuated between 9.7% and 12.2% over this period. The overall prev-
alence of isolates with both RTA and DSC was 2.3% (87/3,827; 95% CI 1.9%–2.8%) and it
increased from 1.9% in 2013 to 3.3% in 2016 (chi-squared test for trend, P = 0.03). Study
limitations include the retrospective study design and potential biases in the sample, which

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first national study on susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to azi-
thromycin and ceftriaxone in China. Our findings indicate high rates of RTA and DSC from
2013 to 2016. Although dual therapy with azithromycin and ceftriaxone has been recom-
mended by WHO and many countries to treat gonorrhea, reevaluation of this therapy is
needed prior to its introduction in China.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) is a global threat in
the control of this infection. China has one of the biggest antimicrobial consumption
rates globally. However, China has limited data on antimicrobial resistance in
gonorrhea.
• Systematic and timely collection and analysis of data on antimicrobial susceptibility of
N. gonorrhoeae will inform the development of Chinese treatment guidelines and clini-
cal practice standards.
What did the researchers do and find?
• Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azithromycin and ceftriaxone were
determined for 3,849 clinical isolates from patients with gonorrhea who provided sam-
ples during the time period 2013 to 2016 in 7 provinces in China.
• Following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria, MIC values were
used to define isolates as resistant to azithromycin and/or with decreased susceptibility
to ceftriaxone.
• High prevalence of resistance to azithromycin (18.6%) and decreased susceptibility to
ceftriaxone (10.8%) were found in our study population. The prevalence of concomitant
resistance to azithromycin and decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone increased from
1.9% in 2013 to 3.3% in 2016.
What do these findings mean?
• N. gonorrhoeae strains resistant to azithromycin and/or with decreased susceptibility to
ceftriaxone are prevalent in China, posing a challenge for gonorrhea control.
• The results can be used to inform national recommendations for N. gonorrhoeae treat-
ment in China.

 Introduction
Gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae), remains one of the most com-
mon sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide. In 2012, the World Health Organization
(WHO) estimated 27 million prevalent and 78 million incident cases of gonorrhea among peo-
ple 15–49 years old. Of these estimated numbers, 42.5% and 45%, respectively, occurred in the
Western Pacific Region. China is the most populous country in this region and contributes sub-
stantially to the number of people with gonorrhea [1]. China reports approximately 115,000
new cases of gonorrhea annually. The incidence of gonorrhea has increased in recent years, and
the infection has become one of the most common notifiable infectious diseases in the country
[2]. Gonorrhea causes urethritis, cervicitis, pharyngitis, and anal infection. If left untreated, it
can result in complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease in women [3] and infertility in
both men and women [4]. Moreover, it increases the risk for HIV acquisition and transmission
[5]. Control of gonorrhea in many countries largely relies on detection of cases followed by ther-
apy to cure the infection and eliminate transmission to others. However, successful treatment
has been hampered by emerging resistance to each of the antibiotics recommended as first-line
therapies [6]. Latest in this trend are resistance and treatment failures for extended-spectrum
cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone and cefixime [7,8]. Monotherapy with ceftriaxone (250
mg intramuscularly in a single dose) for uncomplicated gonococcal infections is still the recom-
mended regimen in the current guidelines in China. To halt the development and spread of
resistance, dual therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and azithromycin has been recommended as
the first-line therapy in international and national guidelines [9–11]. However, the first treat-
ment failure with dual therapy was reported in 2016 in the United Kingdom [12]. To provide
evidence for updating China’s national treatment recommendations for gonorrhea, we analyzed
data on the susceptibility to azithromycin and ceftriaxone of N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in
the China Gonococcal Resistance Surveillance Programme (China-GRSP).
Methods
Ethical clearance
The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee at the Institute of Dermatology, the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, and the National
Center for Sexually Transmitted Disease Control (NCSTD) at Nanjing (approval number
2014-LS-026) for the use of anonymized samples and data collected during routine outpatient
services to patients attending local dermatology and/or STD clinics.
Study population
The current study was a retrospective study based on clinical isolates and data of patients with
confirmed N. gonorrhoea in the China-GRSP. The China-GRSP was launched by the NCSTD
as a collaboration project consisting of a few clinics in 1987. China joined the WHO Western
Pacific Gonococcal Antimicrobial Susceptibility Programme (GASP) in 1992 and then
expanded China-GRSP to more participating clinics in 9 provinces (Guangdong, Guangxi,
Hainan, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Tianjin, Xinjiang, Shanghai, and Chongqing) in 2007. In 2013,
China-GRSP started collecting data on azithromycin resistance. At each participating clinic,
routine medical consultation was provided to patients. Cultures for N. gonorrhoeae were per-
formed in patients with a positive risk assessment. Data from patients with confirmed N.
gonorrhoeae from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2016 were used in this study. The study
focused on 7 provinces (Fig 1); Shanghai and Chongqing were not included in this study

 because these provinces did not collect data about azithromycin resistance. Selected demo-
graphic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics of the participants were extracted from outpa-
tient medical records, i.e., from background information collected during the clinic visits.
Isolation of N. gonorrhoeae
As a patient could be infected at different anatomical sites (cervix/vagina, pharynx, rectum,
and urethra), samples from more than 1 site were collected, if indicated. Rectal and pharyngeal
samples were generally not obtained from heterosexual males. Samples were inoculated into
selective Thayer-Martin (TM) medium and cultured in an incubator at 36˚C in 5%–10% CO2
for 24 to 48 hours. With the cultured isolate samples, probable N. gonorrhoeae was identified
based on colonial morphology (growth of typical appearing colonies), Gram stain (Gram-neg-
ative), and oxidase reaction (oxidase-positive intracellular diplococci in stained smears). Sugar
fermentation tests were further performed if the identification was ambiguous. The gonococcal
isolates were further sub-cultured from the selective TM medium to a nonselective medium,
and the confirmed colonies were suspended in skim milk and frozen to −70˚C until shipped to
provincial central STD laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted at the central STD laboratories
of the participating provinces according to WHO recommendations [13]. Specifically, the iso-
lates were cultured from frozen stocks onto selective TM medium and sub-cultured on GC
medium base agar supplemented with hemoglobin powder and IsoVitaleX Enrichment (BD
Diagnostics, Oxford, England) at 36˚C with 5% to 10% CO2 for 18 to 20 hours at the central
STD laboratories. The colonies were scraped, and suspensions of 107 organisms per milliliter
were prepared. Using a multipoint inoculator (104 per point), the suspension was applied to
antibiotic-containing medium (GC agar base supplemented with 10% defibrinated sheep
blood; Nanjing Bianzhen Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) on a 9-cm diameter plate [14]. The
plate was cultured at 36˚C with 5% to 10% CO2 for 18 to 24 hours, and the growth of gono-
cocci in different concentrations of antibiotic (0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0
mg/l for azithromycin and 0.008, 0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/l for ceftriax-
one) was observed and recorded. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined
as the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that inhibited the growth of gonococci. MIC inter-
pretive criteria were in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute to
define resistance or decreased susceptibility [13,15]. For azithromycin, we categorized MIC
values as susceptible (MIC � 0.5 mg/l) or resistant (MIC � 1.0 mg/l). For ceftriaxone, we cate-
gorized MICs as susceptible (MIC � 0.06 mg/l) or decreased susceptibility (MIC � 0.125 mg/
l). For quality assurance, all the central STD laboratories participated in the external quality
assurance program of the WHO Western Pacific GASP through the National STD Reference
Laboratory in Nanjing.
Statistical analyses
The development of the statistical analysis plan, including changes inspired by peer review, is
described in S1 Text. Those patients whose isolates were successfully cultured and for which
MICs for azithromycin and/or ceftriaxone were determined were included in the final analy-
ses. In this study, we calculated the prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
of N. gonorrhoeae resistance to azithromycin (RTA), decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone
(DSC), and both RTA and DSC (RTA/DSC). Age was described as median and 25%–75%
interquartile range (IQR) because the age data followed a left-skewed distribution. MIC was

 described as geometric mean and 95% CI because MICs were multiple values determined by
serial dilutions. For MICs determined as above or below a specific value, we used the midpoint
value between this specific value and the value of the next higher or lower dilution for calculat-
ing the geometric means. Bivariate analyses were conducted by chi-squared test or chi-squared
test for trend. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the associa-
tions of variables with being infected with strains of N. gonorrhoeae with RTA, DSC, or RTA/
DSC. Variables with a significance level of P < 0.10 in bivariate analyses were included in a
multinomial logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs were esti-
mated by adjusting for potential confounding factors that were included in the model.
P � 0.05 was set as the level of significance. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS for Win-
dows (version 16.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) and MedCalc for Windows (version 16.8; MedCalc
Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).
The current study is reported as per Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S1 Checklist).
Results
Baseline characteristics of patients
A total of 3,849 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were collected from 3,849 patients (males, 91.1%;
females, 8.9%). Data on repeat infections in individuals were not available due to anonymiza-
tion of the dataset during the study years. Of the 3,503 males who provided information on
sexual orientation (99.9% of the male total), 3,451 (98.5%) were heterosexual and 52 (1.5%)
were homosexual or bisexual. The median age was 31 years (IQR 26–40 years) for males and
31 years (IQR 25–43 years) for females. The majority (92.8%) of the participants were of Han
ethnicity, and 50.2% were from the provinces along the coast, where more cases of gonorrhea

 were reported than in other areas [16]. Previous infection with gonorrhea was reported in
15.0% of patients. Among the heterosexual patients, the majority of the isolates were from the
urethra (99.4%) in males and the cervix or urethra (96.2%) in females. No patients were found
to have a positive N. gonorrhoeae isolate at more than 1 anatomical site.
Azithromycin susceptibility
Out of 3,849 N. gonorrhoeae isolates, 3,827 (99.4%) and 3,849 (100.0%) had MIC results for azi-
thromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively. The geometric mean azithromycin MIC was 0.32 mg/
l (95% CI 0.31–0.34 mg/l), with a range of �0.05 to �8 mg/l. The prevalence of RTA (defined
as MIC � 1.0 mg/l) was 18.6% (710/3,827; 95% CI 17.4%–19.8%). The proportions of the iso-
lates with different MICs of azithromycin by year are shown in Fig 2. Neither the mean MIC
nor the percentage of resistant strains appeared to change during the 2013–2016 study period,
remaining between 0.31 mg/l and 0.34 mg/l and between 17.1% and 20.8%, respectively. Multi-
nomial regression analysis (Table 1) indicates that RTA was significantly associated with youn-
ger age (AOR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–1.00; P = 0.043) and being female (AOR 1.50; 95% CI 1.13–
2.00; P = 0.005, compared with males).
Ceftriaxone susceptibility
The geometric mean ceftriaxone MIC was 0.025 mg/l (95% CI 0.024–0.026 mg/l), with a range
of �0.008 to �1.0 mg/l. The prevalence of DSC (defined as MIC � 0.125 mg/l) was 10.8%
(417/3,849; 95% CI 9.9%–11.9%). The proportions of isolates with different MICs for ceftriax-
one are shown by year in Fig 3. The percentage with DSC fluctuated between 9.7% and 12.2%
over the period from 2013 to 2016. In the multinomial analysis (Table 1), DSC was signifi-
cantly associated with residence in areas along the coast (AOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.44–2.36;
P < 0.001, compared with residence in other areas).

 Resistance to azithromycin and decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone
The proportion of isolates resistant to azithromycin in those with DSC (21.0%, 87/415; 95% CI
17.3%–25.1%) was not statistically different from the proportion of isolates resistant to azithro-
mycin in those susceptible to ceftriaxone (18.3%, 623/3,412; 95% CI 17.0%–19.6%) (chi-
squared = 1.79; P = 0.18; Table 2). The prevalence of isolates with RTA/DSC was 2.3% (87/
3,827; 95% CI 1.9%–2.8%). The prevalence increased from 1.9% (18/928; 95% CI 1.2%–3.0%)
in 2013 to 3.3% (32/981; 95% CI 2.3%–4.6%) in 2016 (chi-squared for trend = 4.78; P = 0.03)
(Fig 4). Multinomial regression analysis (Table 1) indicates that residents in areas along the
coast are less likely to be infected with strains with RTA/DSC (AOR 0.56; 95% CI 0.35–0.88;
P = 0.013).
Discussion
The current study represents, to our knowledge, the first national surveillance on trends of sus-
ceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to azithromycin and ceftriaxone over time in China. In addition,
associations between susceptibility data and demographic and clinical characteristics of study
participants were examined. Our findings indicate that the rate of dual RTA and DSC
increased between 2013 and 2016. The prevalences of N. gonorrhoeae RTA and DSC found in
this study in China were higher than those reported in many countries, including in Europe
and the Americas [17–27] (Table 3). A high prevalence of RTA or DSC has also been reported
in Japan, although the sample size of the available study was relatively small (less than 700 iso-
lates in total over 3 years) [27]. It is unclear whether circulating gonococcal strains with altered
susceptibility to the key antibiotic agents in China acquired these mutations through domestic
selective pressure or whether the strains have been imported. Antimicrobial resistant gonor-
rhea was documented first in Asia [28,29], then emerged in other areas in the world. Although
azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended for gonorrhea treatment in China, this

 antibiotic is widely used for treatment of chlamydial infection according to the national STD
treatment guidelines [30]. The prevalence of chlamydial infection is much higher than that of
gonorrhea both among high-risk groups, such as female sex workers [31,32] and men who
have sex with men [33], and in the general population [34] in China. Overuse of macrolides
for chlamydia and other infections could facilitate emergence of resistance in N. gonorrhoeae
[35]. Studies in China have reported that a high percentage (>50%) of outpatient visits result
in prescription of antibiotics [36,37].
WHO and many countries have recommended dual antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone
plus azithromycin for people with symptomatic and asymptomatic gonorrhea [9–11]. How-
ever, despite the high prevalence of DSC (more than 10%) in the current study, treatment fail-
ure of ceftriaxone has not been documented in China. It is important that clinicians be on
high alert to recognize gonorrhea treatment failures so that they can be reported promptly to
public health officials. The high and increasing prevalence of RTA/DSC found in the current
study suggests the need for further consideration and validation of an appropriate regimen for
treatment of gonorrhea in China.

 Socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors associated with antimicrobial resistance
have been investigated by previous studies in China and other countries [38–40]. Interestingly,
the factors independently associated with RTA and DSC were not the same in our study.
Female patients had a higher risk of infection with an azithromycin-resistant strain than
males. This finding was consistent with that reported in Amsterdam [41] but different from
that reported in Shanghai, where male sex was a significant predictor of tetracycline resistance
[38]. Our finding of an association of younger age with RTA is different from that reported in
Shanghai, where probable resistance to ceftriaxone was most common among those in older
age groups [38]. In addition, in our study, DSC was more likely to occur in areas along the
coast, but RTA/DSC was more prevalent in other areas. These associations may be related to
transmission dynamics linked to the sexual networks of different populations or in different
areas. In addition, the resistance patterns are also dependent on the population seeking care in
the sentinel clinics. Further studies on genomic epidemiology and sexual networks among
people infected with resistant strains are needed. In contrast to the expected association
between previous gonorrhea infection—linked to potential exposure to the antibiotics—and
antimicrobial resistance, our study indicated that previous infection with gonorrhea was not
associated with risk of RTA or DSC.
There are some potential limitations to this study. First, although the current study was a
national surveillance survey with a large number of isolates collected from 7 provinces in
China, the sample accounts for roughly only 1% of reported cases of gonorrhea during the
study period in the country. Geographically, less than a quarter of the 31 provinces in the
country participated in the study, and most of them were located in the economically devel-
oped areas along the coast. Moreover, the majority of male participants provided urethral spec-
imens (99.4% of men), and the majority of female participants provided cervical or urethral
specimens (96.2% of women). Our sample overrepresents men because men are usually

 symptomatic and easy to identify for specimen collection. Another concern is that most pha-
ryngeal and anal gonorrhea is asymptomatic, and repeat infections or repeat visits of anon-
ymized patients to clinics during the study period may result in the true number of individuals
sampled being smaller than the number of “patients” described here, although this difference
is likely to be relatively small. In addition, only a small proportion of the study participants
were homosexual or bisexual, and therefore the majority of men did not report any anal or
pharyngeal sexual intercourse [42]. All of these potential biases may limit the generalizability
of the current study to all people infected with gonorrhea in China. Second, those isolates with
MIC > 0.5 mg/l for azithromycin or MIC > 0.125 mg/l for ceftriaxone were not further cate-
gorized for susceptibility analysis to identify high-level RTA and/or resistance to ceftriaxone.
Third, although molecular typing of N. gonorrhoeae was carried out in a few areas and reported
previously [43], it was not performed in the present survey. Future studies should include
molecular and genomic analyses to investigate gonorrhea transmission and to track the spread

 of antimicrobial resistance [44]. With regard to the treatment of gonorrhea in China, the
national STD guidelines have not yet been updated to include dual therapy with ceftriaxone
plus azithromycin for gonorrhea but recommend the use of azithromycin for treating potential
infection with chlamydia among patients infected with gonorrhea. Further studies are needed
to look into appropriate doses of ceftriaxone and azithromycin as well as use of other antibiot-
ics in China.
In conclusion, the current study was a national study on the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae
to azithromycin and ceftriaxone with implications for antibiotic choice for treatment of gonor-
rhea in China. An increasing trend of isolates with simultaneous RTA and DSC will likely
impede the introduction of the currently WHO-recommended dual therapy in China. There-
fore, evaluation of the efficacy of the dual therapy and the development of novel treatment
strategies are urgently warranted in China. In addition, future resources should be dedicated
to enhancing antimicrobial resistance surveillance by increasing both the number of laborato-
ries performing susceptibility testing and the quality of susceptibility tests. The development of
rapid diagnostics to promptly detect gonococcal infections and identify antimicrobial resis-
tance is also urgently needed.
