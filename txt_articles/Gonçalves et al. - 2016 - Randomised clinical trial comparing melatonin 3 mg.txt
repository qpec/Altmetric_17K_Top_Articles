ABSTRACT
Introduction Melatonin has been studied in headache
disorders. Amitriptyline is efficacious for migraine
prevention, but its unfavourable side effect profile limits
its use.
Methods A randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study was carried out. Men and women, aged
18–65 years, with migraine with or without aura,
experiencing 2–8 attacks per month, were enrolled. After
a 4-week baseline phase, 196 participants were
randomised to placebo, amitriptyline 25 mg or melatonin
3 mg, and 178 took a study medication and were
followed for 3 months (12 weeks). The primary outcome
was the number of migraine headache days per month
at baseline versus last month. Secondary end points
were responder rate, migraine intensity, duration and
analgesic use. Tolerability was also compared between
groups.
Results Mean headache frequency reduction was 2.7
migraine headache days in the melatonin group, 2.2 for
amitriptyline and 1.1 for placebo. Melatonin significantly
reduced headache frequency compared with placebo
(p=0.009), but not to amitriptyline (p=0.19). Melatonin
was superior to amitriptyline in the percentage of
patients with a greater than 50% reduction in migraine
frequency. Melatonin was better tolerated than
amitriptyline. Weight loss was found in the melatonin
group, a slight weight gain in placebo and significantly
for amitriptyline users.
Conclusions Melatonin 3 mg is better than placebo
for migraine prevention, more tolerable than amitriptyline
and as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg.
INTRODUCTION
Migraine is a chronic debilitating neurological con-
dition affecting 12–20% of the population world-
wide.1
Preventive
treatments
are
available,
decreasing the number and severity of headache
attacks, and improving health outcomes and quality
of life; half of the patients show 50% reduction in
attack frequency.2 Although migraine prophylaxis
guidelines from North American, South American
and European societies are available, only 3–5% of
patients receive adequate preventive therapy.3
Public surveys report that migraineurs are among
the most dissatisfied patients.4 5 About half of the
patients with migraine stop seeking care for their
headaches,
partly
because
of
their
side
effect
profile.6 Most guidelines recommend topiramate,
divalproex/sodium
valproate,
propranolol
and
metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence.7
Newer effective and tolerable options for migraine
prophylaxis are necessary to reduce this gap and
improve patients’ quality of life.
Melatonin use in migraine prevention is sup-
ported by several biological effects.8 Melatonin
levels are decreased in patients with migraine; it
has been studied for migraine prophylaxis with
conflicting results.9–11 W
e aimed to study the effect
of melatonin in a double-blind, placebo controlled
trial with an active comparator.
METHODS
Patients
Patients with migraine were eligible for the study if
they met inclusion criteria: age of 18–65 years;
migraine with or without aura criteria according to
the
International
Classification
of
Headache
Disorders, third edition, β-version12 for at least
1 year, age of onset before 50 years, at least three
migraine headache attacks or four migraine head-
ache days (defined as any occurrence of migraine
headache pain of at least 30 min in duration with
acute treatment) per month, presents with migraine
or non-migraine headache attacks <15 days per
month during each of the 3 months prior to the
screening visit and the reference period. Migraine
diagnosis was performed by a trained neurologist
headache specialist. W
omen were eligible if they
were unable to bear children or if they were not
pregnant and using adequate contraception.
Patients were excluded if they had a history of
psychiatric disorder (in the past or present); ergota-
mine, triptan, opioid, or combination medication
intake for >10 days per month, or simple analgesic
intake for >15 days per month for >3 months; in
use of preventive medications such as β-blockers,
tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers,
antiepileptic drugs, bupropion, serotonergic nor-
epinephrine reuptake inhibitors; and were unable
to discontinue the treatment; had previously taken
melatonin, amitriptyline or agomelatine; or had
uncontrolled hypertension (ie, sitting systolic blood
pressure >160 mm Hg or sitting diastolic blood
pressure >90 mm Hg) at the screening visit or at
randomisation. Data collection was performed after
patient
compliance
and
signing
of
informed
consent. Patients were recruited from the general
population, primary care, advertising and social
media. Those interested in participating in the trial
called
and
were
asked
screening questions.

a screening visit.
Patients’ involvement
Patients/service users/carers/laypeople were not involved in the
study design. Outcome measures were defined by scientific cri-
teria, designed to better meet patients’ preferences, priorities
and experience. Patients were not involved in recruitment and
conducting the study. Results will be disseminated to patients/
carers/laypeople by publication in the clinicaltrials.org database
and to press/social media. Burden of intervention, for example,
side effects were assessed. The research question and outcome
measures were developed to meet patients’ needs.
STUDY DESIGN
The
study
was
conducted
in
a
randomised,
multicentre,
parallel-group design. Melatonin 3 mg was compared with ami-
triptyline 25 mg and placebo. Randomisation was performed
centrally with the use of randomisation lists with randomly per-
muted block lengths stratified according to centre. Patients,
treating clinicians and the outcome assessor were blinded. Study
medications were also blinded and delivered to the investigators
by the pharmacy which prepared the three study medications
equally in design, shape, and colour.
The trial conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, Good
Clinical Practice guidelines and the International Organization
for Standardization standards and was approved by the ethics
committee for each participating centre. The trial was funded
by FAPESP
, Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa de São Paulo, a
Brazilian governmental funding agency without any role in
manuscript
preparation.
The
trial
was
registered
at
ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01357031.
Procedures
The study consisted of a 4-week period to established baseline
measures followed by a 12-week treatment period. After eligibil-
ity had been determined, patients were randomised to treatment
groups (figure 1).
Patients meeting eligibility criteria were randomised 1:1:1 to
one of the three groups: placebo, melatonin 3 mg or amitriptyl-
ine 25 mg, all taken at bedtime. Use of acute migraine medica-
tion was permitted for breakthrough migraine attacks. Patients
recorded information about migraine or non-migraine headache
occurrence, mean migraine headache attack intensity, duration,
analgesics taken, (type of medication, number of days of medi-
cation use, number of doses) and associated symptoms in a
paper-based diary. Trained neurologists in headache abstracted
the information, which was double-checked by another investi-
gator and uploaded into a spreadsheet. Any migraine headache
during at least 30 min was defined as a migraine headache day.
The variables were collected from the diaries and defined at the
end of the baseline period, and at the first (weeks 1–4), second
(weeks 5–8) and third (weeks 9–12) months after treatment.
Outcome measures
Efficacy
The primary efficacy outcome
measure was frequency in
number of migraine headache days per month comparing base-
line with the past 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points
included
reduction
in
migraine
intensity,
attack
duration,
number of analgesics used and percentages of patients with
greater than 50% reductions in migraine headache days.
Tolerability and safety
Patients were monitored by adverse events and vital signs to
determined tolerability and safety. An adverse event was defined
as any medical occurrence reported by a patient or noted by a
clinician during the study, regardless of its suspected cause. It
was recorded if it was considered to be related to study medica-
tion. Tolerability measures included the incidences of adverse
events, including those that led to the premature withdrawal of
the study and serious adverse events (defined as death, disability
or incapacity; were life-threatening; or required hospitalisation).
Adverse events data were summarised for the safety population,
defined as randomised patients who were administered at least
one dose of the study medication.
Statistical analysis
Sample size calculation was based on previous trials. A 20% dif-
ference between active drug and placebo response was assumed.
The randomisation ratio of 1:1:1 for placebo, and the two treat-
ment groups, 59 participants in each groups were determined to
provide 80% power to detect a significant difference in the
primary endpoint.
This estimate was based on a two-sided analysis of variance
(ANOVA), an α level of 0.05 and an SD of 4.0. Efficacy data
were analysed for the intention-to-treat population, defined as
randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study

J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry: first published as 10.1136/jnnp-2016-313458 on 10 May 2016. Downloaded from 
 medication and provided at least one postbaseline efficacy assess-
ment. No interim analysis was planned. Missing data were ana-
lysed by three methods. The first method extended the calendar
earlier into the treatment period until 28 days of non-missing
data contributed to the count of migraine headache days. The
second method proportionately adjusted the number of migraine
headache days (multiplied by 28 and divided by the number of
non-missing days). The third method treated all missing days as
non-migraine headache days (used for the primary end point).
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to test the
null hypothesis of no difference between placebo and the
average of the values for the three groups. Results were sum-
marised using the adjusted mean and SE for each treatment
group, a 95% CI for the change from baseline for each treat-
ment group, a model estimate of the difference between each
active treatment group and placebo, a 95% CI for the difference,
and an associated p value and adjusted p value for the differ-
ence. Analysis of the primary end point was carried out using a
combination of a sequential method and a Hochberg procedure
to maintain the experiment-wise α level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Patients
The number of patients randomised to treatment was 196 after
438 were recruited and assessed for eligibility. Eighteen rando-
mised patients were excluded from the study, the analysis was
performed in the remaining completed cases, 178 patients (59
placebo, 60 melatonin and 59 amitriptyline. Between 69% and
75% of patients completed the study in the treatment groups.
Adverse events occurrence was the most common reason for
premature withdrawal for all randomised patients (figure 2).
Treatment groups presented with similar demographics and
baseline clinical characteristics (table 1). There were no signifi-
cant differences in all variables.
The primary efficacy end point was frequency in number of
migraine headache days per month. Melatonin 3 mg and ami-
triptyline 25 mg efficiencies were superior to placebo (p<0.05)
when comparing baseline with the last month of observation
(table 2 and figure 3).
For the secondary end points, melatonin and amitriptyline
were more effective to placebo reducing the number of analge-
sics taken, migraine headache attacks duration and intensity.
Melatonin and amitriptyline were equally effective for the
primary end point, but for the secondary end point number of
responders (patients with a higher than 50% improvement in
headache frequency) melatonin was superior to amitriptyline
(p<0.05)
and
placebo
(p<0.01)
(table
2
and
figure
4).
Outcomes were not related to duration of illness.
Tolerability
Over the 3-month course of treatment, 77 adverse events were
reported by 60 participants, 46 reports in the amitriptyline
group, 16 in the melatonin group and 17 in the placebo group.
No serious adverse events were observed. The majority of
adverse events were either mild or moderate in intensity and
occurred more commonly in the amitriptyline group compared
with melatonin and placebo (p<0.03), whereas the melatonin
and placebo groups had similar numbers (p value=not signifi-
cant). The most common adverse events were daytime sleepi-
ness, dry mouth, epigastralgia, weight gain and constipation
(table 3). Blood pressure levels have not changed among groups.
Patients were asked specifically about and reported no hypogly-
caemic symptoms.
W
e also evaluated weight variation in all groups. Surprisingly,
patients taking melatonin had on average a weight reduction
(mean 0.140±0.156 kg), whereas those taking placebo and ami-
triptyline had a weight gain (mean 0.432±0.247 kg, and 0.971
±0.359 kg), respectively. W
eight differences among groups were
significantly different (figure 5).
DISCUSSION
The results from this study support the efficacy and tolerability
of melatonin 3 mg as a preventive therapy for migraine.
Melatonin was more effective than placebo in the primary end

 point and all other end points studied. Although melatonin was
as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg in the primary end point, in
the secondary end point, proportion of patients who improved
>50% in headache frequency, melatonin was superior to both
placebo and amitriptyline. The placebo rate in our study was
20.4%, similar to the rates reported in the meta-analysis of
pharmacological migraine prevention studies 22% (0.17% to
0.28%).
A pilot open-label study was published in 2004,9 showing
efficacy and good tolerability of the same melatonin dose as was
studied in this trial. A placebo controlled study comparing a dif-
ferent melatonin compound and dose (extended-release mela-
tonin
2.0 mg,
Circadin
(Neurim
Pharmaceuticals,
T
el-Aviv,
Israel)) with placebo showed negative results.10 Several meth-
odological issues including the short trial length (only 8 weeks),
high placebo response rate and low melatonin dosage and
patient population limit this trial interpretation. Nevertheless, in
this trial, the melatonin response rate was 44%, similar to
several other positive migraine prophylaxis trials. The mean
decrease in headache frequency was also similar to the most
recent and well-designed preventive trials.11
W
e
designed
the
study
according
to
the
International
Headache Society guidelines for clinical trials,13 including an
active comparator, in order to warrant a better blinding of treat-
ment groups. Patients taking placebo not having sleepiness
would probably guess their group to be placebo. Amitriptyline
25 mg is a lower than usually prescribed dose in the USA and
studied in trials, but the usual dose in many countries, including
Brazil. One study showed that topiramate and amitriptyline
were equally effective with a mean daily dose of 74.8 and

 76.5 mg, respectively; the amitriptyline group reported an
unacceptable side effect profile, at least in our culture, for our
patient population profile: dry mouth (35.5%), fatigue (24.3%),
somnolence (17.8%), weight increase (13.6%) and dizziness
(10.7%). Higher doses of amitriptyline could give better results
but certainly a lot higher dropout rates in our population.14
Although our focus was to study melatonin efficacy, and the
study was not designed for non-inferiority, this trial also gives
support for the use of amitriptyline in lower doses for migraine
prophylaxis.
Melatonin was more tolerable than amitriptyline and as toler-
able as placebo. W
eight loss was found in the melatonin group
as opposed to a slight weight gain in placebo and a significant
one in amitriptyline group. This is a very important and original
finding that deserves special discussion. There is substantial
experimental evidence in the literature indicating the role of
melatonin in the control of food intake, energy balance and
body weight. An inhibitory action of melatonin in preadipocytes
differentiation into adipocytes, reducing the number of cells in
the visceral adipose tissue has been demonstrated.15 Melatonin
treatment reduced body weight gain, visceral adiposity, blood tri-
glycerides and insulin resistance in a model of high-calorie
diet-induced metabolic syndrome.16 Likewise, a single daily
administration of melatonin decreased visceral fat in middle-aged
mice,17 and after melatonin treatment aged rats showed weight
reduction, preceded by an increase in insulin signalling in the
central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues.18 In add-
ition, melatonin might have a direct anorexigenic action regulat-
ing
hypothalamic
pro-opiomelanocortin
(POMC)
gene
expression.19 In ageing animals, melatonin and moderate exercise
training induced a reduction in food intake associated with a
reduction in body weight and amount of visceral adipose tissue
depot.20 Melatonin should be considered as regulating the other
side of energy balance increasing the energy expenditure by its
ability to convert white adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue
increasing its metabolic rate.21 The reduction in body weight of
patients in the melatonin treated group is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first demonstration of the putative effect of mela-
tonin in body weight reduction in humans.
Melatonin mechanism of action in migraine prevention could
be due to one of its several effects, including: membrane stabil-
isation, anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of dopamine
release, modulation of serotonin, gamma amino butyric acid
(GAMA) and glutamate neurotransmission, scavenging toxic-
free radicals and cerebrovascular regulation.22 Melatonin also
potentiates opioid analgesia; therefore, it should be used with

 caution in patients taking and/or overusing opioids.23 Patients
with diabetes and hypertensive patients should be monitored
since melatonin may decrease blood pressure24 and glucose
levels.25
Owing to its favourable side effect profile and efficacy, mela-
tonin could be an option for patients sensitive to other drugs or
with a preference for natural products. With the same efficacy
level compared with other treatments and a low cost, melatonin
should be a cost-effective treatment.
Different melatonin doses (lower and higher) should be
studied, as well as its effect in other migraine types and
comorbidities. The use of other chronobiotic agents, including
melatonin analogues, could be tested in migraine prevention.
Other trials in different populations and other latitudes should
be conducted in the future.
Conclusion
Melatonin 3 mg is effective and better than placebo for migraine
prevention. Melatonin is as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg in
the primary end point, but better than amitriptyline in the sec-
ondary end point (50% responder rate). It is more tolerable
