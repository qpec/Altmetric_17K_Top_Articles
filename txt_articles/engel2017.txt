Abstract
Background/objectives Dietary guidelines have for decades recommended choosing low-fat dairy products due to the
high content of saturated fat in dairy known to increase blood concentration of LDL cholesterol. However, meta-
analyses including observational studies show no association between overall dairy intake and risk of cardiovascular
disease and even point to an inverse association with type 2 diabetes. The objective was to compare the effects of
whole milk (3.5% fat) with skimmed milk (0.1% fat) on fasting serum blood lipids, insulin, and plasma glucose in healthy
subjects.
Subject/methods A randomized, controlled 2 × 3-week crossover dietary intervention in 18 healthy adults randomly
assigned to a sequence of treatments consisting of 0.5 L/d of whole milk and skimmed milk as part of their habitual diet.
A total of 17 subjects completed the intervention.
Results Whole milk increased HDL cholesterol concentrations significantly compared to skimmed milk (P < 0.05). There
were no significant differences between whole milk and skimmed milk in effects on total and LDL cholesterol, tria-
cylglycerol, insulin, and glucose concentrations.
Conclusions Intake of 0.5 L/d of whole milk did not adversely affect fasting blood lipids, glucose, or insulin compared to
skimmed milk. Moreover, intake of whole milk increased HDL cholesterol concentration compared to skimmed milk. These
findings suggest that if the higher energy content is taken into account, whole milk might be considered a part of a healthy
diet among the normocholesterolemic population.
Introduction
Dairy is a source of saturated fat (SFA) and dietary
recommendations for choosing low-fat dairy products are
mainly based on predicted effects of macronutrients, such as
SFA, which are known to increase LDL cholesterol con-
centration in the blood. However, there is disagreement
between dietary guidelines [1, 2] and results from meta-
analysis of prospective cohort studies reporting no asso-
ciation between dairy and risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) [3] and an inverse association with type 2 diabetes
(T2D) [4]. A meta-analysis including studies comparing
diets of equal SFA content from cheese and butter reported
a beneficial effect of cheese on LDL cholesterol [5].
Moreover, a comparison between regular and reduced fat
cheese found no difference in effect on LDL cholesterol and
risk markers of the metabolic syndrome [6], although a
significantly higher SFA content in the regular fat cheese
diet. This could suggest that the expected effect on LDL
cholesterol was mediated by a combination of nutrients or
bioactive components in the cheese matrix. Every day,
people make a choice between whole milk and skimmed
milk in the super market. Thus, a comparison between these
high and low-fat dairy products is a real-life practical issue
for the consumer that makes it possible to further examine
the effect of milk fat on health. Two studies compared milk
with different fat content and found no difference in chan-
ges in LDL and HDL cholesterol; one between two control
diets with semi-skimmed and skimmed milk (1.9 vs. 0.3%)
[7] and another between whole milk and skimmed milk (3.4
vs. 0.2%) but with only eight participants and therefore

 underpowered [8]. Current evidence from randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that milk consumption has
no effect on risk of T2D in terms of fasting insulin and
glucose concentrations [7, 9–11], although not consistently
[12]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
whole milk compared with skimmed milk on serum total,
LDL, and HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentra-
tion and secondarily on glucose and insulin concentrations
in healthy subjects. We hypothesized that whole milk would
increase fasting blood cholesterol concentration moderately
compared to skimmed milk.
Methods
Subjects
Subjects were recruited through postings on the Internet and
around university campus area in Copenhagen. A total of
25 subjects were screened through telephone calls, 19 were
assessed for eligibility, 18 were enrolled in the study, and
1 subject dropped out after randomization (see participant
flowchart in Fig. 1). Exclusion criteria were: previous or
current CVD, diabetes, or other severe chronic disease; BMI
(in kg/m 2) < 18.5 and >30; age < 20 years and >70 years;
pregnancy or planning of pregnancy during study period;
excessive physical activity (>10 h/wk); milk allergy or
lactose intolerance; blood donations <1 mo prior to and
during study period; use of supplements, lipid-lowering
medication, as well as medicine that might affect study
outcomes; known or suspected abuse of alcohol, medica-
tion,
or
drugs;
blood
pressure
>140/90 mmHg;
and
inability to follow study protocol. After receiving oral and
written information about the study all subjects gave their
informed consent in writing and completed a lifestyle
questionnaire including questions about current and pre-
vious disease.
Study design
The study was a crossover RCT. The two intervention
periods of whole milk and skimmed milk (in random order)
were 3 weeks long with no wash-out period, as the lipids in
the blood are known to adjust after 2 weeks [13]. The study
was not blinded as the appearance of the test beverages
could not be concealed. However, analyses of blood sam-
ples as well as statistics were done blinded. Sample size was
based on a previous study on dairy fat in which butter
significantly increased LDL cholesterol compared with
olive oil (control) (difference in concentration 0.17 mmol/L)
[14]. Thus, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.19 mmol/L,
a total of 12 subjects had to be included in order to detect a
similar difference (assuming a significance level of 5 and
80% power). The study was carried out at the Department of
Nutrition, Exercise, and Sports, Faculty of Science, Uni-
versity of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark from 3
October to 17 December 2015. The study was approved by
the Municipal Ethical Committee of Copenhagen (Report
H-15011908) and conducted according to the Helsinki
Declaration.
Intervention
The test foods were provided to the study subjects, con-
sisting of 0.5 L conventional skimmed milk (0.1%, Arla
Foods, Denmark) and whole milk (3.5%, Arla Foods,
Denmark) from cows and from the same season. The energy
content and macronutrient composition of the milks are
shown in Table 1. Subjects were instructed not to consume
yoghurt, ice-cream, or milk besides the test milk. For other
dairy products such as cheese and butter and for cooking
oils subjects were instructed to keep the same dietary pat-
tern throughout the intervention. Apart from the test foods

 and restrictions in dairy intake the remaining diet was self-
selected and study subjects were asked to maintain their
usual diets and their regular level of physical activity
throughout the intervention periods. Subjects were instruc-
ted in how to substitute the test foods for food items from
their habitual diets (usually the milk they normally drank).
Weekly subjects visited the department to collect the milk
and for weighing and follow-up making sure they adhered
to the test diet and kept a stable body weight during inter-
vention periods. Compliance was measured as a percentage
of milk consumed according to a diary kept throughout the
intervention compared with the milk handed out. Subjects
completed 3-d dietary records the last week of each period
and were instructed to include 1 weekend day and 2 week-
days to take account of differences in nutrient intake.
Dietary intake was assessed using Dankost Pro dietary
assessment software (Dankost).
Clinical investigations
Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline, after 3 weeks
and after 6 weeks. Prior to the blood sampling subjects
fasted (12 h) and were asked to refrain from smoking (12 h),
extreme sports (36 h), alcohol or medicine (24 h). Blood
samples were drawn for assessment of following: serum
lipids (total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triacylgly-
cerol), insulin, and plasma glucose. Samples for assessment
of blood lipids and insulin were collected into dry tubes,
and samples for glucose were collected into tubes with a
1 × 3 mL-fluoride citrate mixture. To coagulate blood
samples were stored at room temperature for 30 min. Fur-
ther, blood samples for assessment of blood lipid and
insulin concentrations were centrifuged at 2754×g for 10
min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until the concentration
was analyzed. For glucose, samples were centrifuged at
2754×g for 10 min at 20 °C and stored at −80 °C until the
concentration was analyzed. LDL and HDL cholesterol
concentrations were assessed by enzymatic colorimetric
procedure (ABX Pentra LDL Direct CP and ABX Pentra
HDL Direct CP, respectively; Horiba ABX). Concentration
of total cholesterol was assessed by enzymatic photometric
test (CHOD-PAP from ABX Pentra Cholesterol CP). Tria-
cylglycerol and glucose concentrations were assessed by
enzymatic colorimetric procedure (ABX Pentra Triglycer-
ides CP and ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP; Horiba ABX,
respectively). Blood lipid concentration was analyzed on an
ABX Pentra 400 Chemistry Analyzer (Horiba ABX).
Interassay CVs for total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, tria-
cylglycerol, and glucose were 2.2, 2.7, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.5%,
respectively. Intra-assay CVs for total, LDL and HDL
cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and glucose were 0.9, 0.7, 1.2,
3.8, and 1.1%, respectively. Insulin concentrations were
assessed
by
the
solid-phase
enzyme-labeled
chemiluminescent immunometric assay with an Immulite
2000 XPi (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics). Inter-
assay and intra-assay CVs for insulin were 3.5 and 4.2%,
respectively.
Insulin resistance was evaluated by using homeostasis
model assessment—insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with the
following formula: HOMA-IR = Fasting serum insulin (µU/
mL) x fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5 [15].
Fasting body weight was measured at baseline, 3 and
6 weeks to the nearest 0.1 kg wearing light clothing and
having emptied their bladder in advance. Height, body weight
for BMI calculation, and waist circumference were also
measured at screening. Height was measured without shoes to
the nearest 0.5 cm with a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca)
and waist circumference was measured horizontally at the
midpoint between the bottom rib and the top of the hip bone.
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences for outcome measures were analyzed
with linear mixed models that incorporated systematic
effects of period and treatment and their interaction.
Approximate F-tests were used to evaluate the interaction
between time and treatment and if non-significant to eval-
uate a time-independent treatment effect. Baseline values
and relevant covariates: sex, age, waist circumference, and
baseline-BMI
were
included.
Subject-specific
random
effects were included to account for inter-subject variability
and to adjust for non-specific differences that could not be
explained by the explanatory variables included. For dietary
records statistical differences were based on paired t-test or
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for non-parametric variables.
Treatment differences were reported in terms of unadjusted
mean
levels
with
corresponding
standard
errors.
All
models
were
validated
by
graphical
assessment
of
normal quantile plots and residual vs. fitted plots. When
departure
was
detected
logarithmic
transformation
of
the variables were made. Variance homogeneity was
visually inspected and showed similar variance. Con-
centration of glucose and insulin were correlated to blood
lipid responses using Pearson correlation test or Spearman
correlation test for non-parametric variables. A two-tailed
P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical
software R version 3.1.3 2015 was used for all statistical
evaluations.

 characteristics of the 17 subjects who completed the study
are outlined in Table 2. No difference was observed in body
weight during the intervention between whole milk and
skimmed milk periods (P = 0.59). The compliance for
intake of milk during the first and second period was 99.7
and 98.5%, respectively.
Blood lipids
Results from fasting blood lipid measurements at the end of
each period are listed in Table 3. HDL cholesterol was
significantly higher with whole milk than with skimmed
milk (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences
between the periods for any of the other blood lipids. For
total cholesterol there was a tendency for a higher con-
centration with whole milk than with skimmed milk (P =
0.06).
Insulin and glucose
Results of glucose and insulin concentrations measured at
the end of each period as well as calculated HOMA values
are listed in Table 3. There were no significant differences
between the periods for any of these outcomes. However,
correlation analysis with skimmed milk showed that insulin
and LDL cholesterol were moderately positively correlated
(r = 0.54, P < 0.05) and with whole milk that glucose
and HDL cholesterol were moderately negatively correlated
(r = 0.52, P < 0.05).
Dietary intake
Results from the dietary records are listed in Table 4. Total
energy intake was significantly higher with whole milk than
with skimmed milk (P < 0.05). Fat intake (in grams and
percentage of energy) was significantly higher with whole
milk than with skimmed milk (P < 0.001). Also, the intake
of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat was

Intake of carbohydrate was significantly higher with skim-
med milk than with whole milk (P < 0.01). There were no

cium, alcohol, and dietary fiber.
Discussion
In the present study we showed that a daily intake of 0.5 L
whole milk for 3 weeks did not increase LDL cholesterol
compared to an equal intake of skimmed milk in healthy
subjects. Moreover, although small, a significant increase in
HDL cholesterol concentration was shown with whole milk
compared to skimmed milk, which was significantly,
moderately, and negatively correlated with glucose con-
centration. None of the other outcome measurements
showed a difference between the periods. The increase in
HDL cholesterol following intake of whole milk was
expected due to the higher content of SFAs known to
increase HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations [16]. The
Nordic Nutrition Recommendations as well as the American
Dietary Guidelines advice that SFA should be limited to
less than 10 E% [1, 2], due to the predicted effect on LDL
cholesterol. In comparison, the amount of SFAs in the
whole milk diet was almost 5 E% above and in the skimmed
milk diet close to recommendation (14.4 and 11.3 E%,
respectively), according to the dietary records. Thus, the
result of no difference in LDL cholesterol was unexpected
and opposite to the dietary guidelines and our hypothesis,
despite of the dominating macronutrient content of SFA
with whole milk. Studies of the association between HDL
cholesterol concentration and CVD has shown that HDL is
protective [17, 18]. However, it is necessary to be cautious
when interpreting low concentration of HDL cholesterol as
a CVD risk factor. Mendelian randomization studies have
shown that genetically decreased HDL cholesterol was not
associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction,
questioning the causality of an association between low
HDL concentration and CVD [19–21]. Still, HDL choles-
terol concentration, as a marker of cardiovascular health,
should be taken into consideration when interpreting the
effect of dairy or SFAs in the diet.
Our results are in line with two previous intervention
studies from 2009 and 1994 comparing milk of different fat
content that also showed no effect on total and LDL cho-
lesterol concentration after 12 months and 6 weeks with
similar milk intake (500 and 660 mL/d, respectively);
however, contrary to our results also no effect on HDL
cholesterol [7, 8]. Fonolla et al. compared semi-skimmed
milk and skimmed milk and therefore a smaller difference
in milk fat (1.9 vs. 0.3%), which could explain the lack of
difference in HDL cholesterol compared to the present
study [7]. Steinmetz et al., the more comparable study and
of good quality, also compared skimmed milk with whole
milk in a crossover design, but in a background diet
designed to meet the AHA recommendations. Steinmetz
et al. reported a significantly higher concentration of total
and LDL cholesterol with whole milk compared to skim-
med milk [8]. However, the statistical analysis was not
adjusted for baseline measurements, and thus not adjusted
for differences between periods, and in addition the sample
size was small (n = 8). Still, the analysis of difference in
change from baseline between the two diets was also
reported which showed no difference between total and
LDL cholesterol, in line with our results. Nevertheless, the
study reported higher Apolipoprotein B concentrations with
whole milk compared to skimmed milk known to be a
predictor of cardio metabolic risk [22].
Although the dietary records showed a significantly
higher energy intake with whole milk compared to skimmed
milk, it seems that the study subjects compensated for the
extra energy with whole milk by lowering their intake of
carbohydrate which was significantly lower compared to
skimmed milk. The content of calcium and protein were
similar in the two milk types, but whole milk has a higher
content of milk fat globule membranes (MFGM), which
encloses the fat. A possible matrix effect of MFGMs was
suggested in a recent study showing an impaired lipoprotein
profile after a butter oil diet, low in MFGMs, compared with
a whipping cream diet, high in MFGMs [23]. One proposed
mechanism, based on a mice study, is through lowering of
cholesterol absorption by inhibition of cholesterol micellar
solubility possibly due to presence of sphingomyelin in
MFGM fragments [24]. Thus, one could speculate that an
expected higher LDL cholesterol concentration after whole
milk may be modified by a dairy matrix effect of MFGM.
The strength of the present RCT was the imitation of
real-life settings by not matching the diets for energy con-
tent or macronutrient composition, which made it possible
to directly compare whole milk and skimmed milk as whole
foods. The free-living design of the study was a limitation,
thus allowing the presence of potential confounding by
other lifestyle and dietary factors. However, the crossover
design minimizes this potential confounding as study sub-
jects were their own control.
In conclusion, the results indicate that intake of 0.5 L/d
of whole milk does not adversely affect fasting blood lipids,
glucose, or insulin compared to skimmed milk in healthy
adults. Moreover, intake of whole milk increased HDL
cholesterol concentration compared to skimmed milk.
These findings suggest that if the higher energy content is
taken into account, whole milk can be considered as part of
a healthy diet among the normocholesterolemic population.
