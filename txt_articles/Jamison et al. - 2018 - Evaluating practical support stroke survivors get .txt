Objectives To design a questionnaire and use it to explore 
unmet needs with practical aspects of medicine taking 
after stroke, predictors of medicine taking and to estimate 
the proportion of survivors who get support with daily 
medication taking.
Design Four workshops with stroke survivors and 
caregivers to design the questionnaire. A cross-sectional 
postal questionnaire in primary care.
setting 18 general practitioner practices in the East of 
England and London. Questionnaires posted between 
September 2016 and February 2017.
Participants 1687 stroke survivors living in the 
community outside institutional long-term care.
Primary outcome measures The proportion of 
community stroke survivors receiving support from 
caregivers for practical aspects of medicine taking; the 
proportion with unmet needs in this respect; the predictors 
of experiencing unmet needs and missing taking 
medications.
results A five-item questionnaire was developed to 
cover the different aspects of medicine taking. 596/1687 
(35%) questionnaires were returned. 56% reported getting 
help in at least one aspect of taking medication and 11% 
needing more help. 35% reported missing taking their 
medicines. Unmet needs were associated with receiving 
help with medications (OR 5.9, P<0.001), being on a 
higher number of medications (OR 1.2, P<0.001) and 
being dependent for activities of daily living (OR 4.9, 
P=0.001). Missing medication was associated with having 
unmet needs (OR 5.3, P<0.001), receiving help with 
medications (OR 2.1, P<0.001), being on a higher number 
of medicines (OR 1.1, P=0.008) and being older than 70 
years (OR 0.6, P=0.006).
Conclusions More than half of patients who replied 
needed help with taking medication, and 1 in 10 had 
unmet needs in this regard. Stroke survivors dependent 
on others have more unmet needs, are more likely to 
miss medicines and might benefit from focused clinical 
and research attention. Novel primary care interventions 
focusing on the practicalities of taking medicines are 
warranted.
IntrODuCtIOn
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in 
developed countries, with an estimated 
25%–74% of the 50 million stroke survivors 
worldwide requiring some assistance or being 
fully dependent on caregivers for activities of 
daily living (ADLs).1–3 For many older adults 
remaining independent at home may depend 
on how well they can manage complex medi-
cation regimens.4 5 Around half of stroke 
survivors are dependent on others for 
everyday activities.6 
There is evidence that being dependent 
for ADLs and impairment in mobility and 
communication decrease medication adher-
ence in patients suffering from hypertension.7 
Deficits in attention, cognition or working 
memory have been linked with non-adher-
ence to medications in other patient groups.8 
In a recent systematic review of medication 
adherence among patients with cognitive 
impairment, one-third of studies showed that 
such patients were likely to have a caregiver to 
assist with medications and there was an asso-
ciation between taking four or more medi-
cines and non-adherence.9 In patients taking 
cardiovascular medicines, multiple factors 
including cognitive problems, lack of social 
support, dosing regimen, as well as practical 
problems and difficulties accessing services, 
contribute to poor medication adherence.10 11 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Development of the questionnaire was based on 
patients’ and caregivers’ own views gathered 
through workshops.
 
► Stroke survivors were recruited from two UK regions.
 
► This work identified issues from a population that 
includes patients severely affected by stroke, who 
are often excluded from research.
 
► Results shed light on the effect of stroke-related 
impairments on practical domains and predictors of 
medicine taking, which have significant effects on 
medication adherence and call for new primary care 
interventions.
 
► The low response rate reported is a limitation of this 
study, and stroke survivors who are harder to reach 
may have been missed.

Low adherence to secondary prevention medication is 
associated with poor cardiovascular health.12 13
Stroke survivors have previously reported difficulties in 
the handling of medication as a barrier to adherence to 
secondary prevention medication after stroke.14 This was 
true irrespective of age at stroke, with younger and older 
stroke survivors being similarly affected.14 Research on 
medication adherence in stroke has identified multiple 
barriers to medication taking among stroke survivors.14–16 
However, interventions developed to improve adherence 
have mainly concentrated on patients responsible for 
their own medicine taking.17 18
In England, the average age at stroke is 74 for men and 
80 years for women.19 In elderly patients in particular, 
cognitive deficits, taking large number of medicines and 
the complexity of medication regimens have been identi-
fied as barriers to medication adherence.20 21 Caregivers 
are known to play a key role in providing assistance to 
older people in a range of daily activities including medi-
cation taking and physician visits22 and can help improve 
adherence in cardiac patients with memory problems.23
Survivors of stroke have previously reported unmet 
needs including physical difficulties, cognitive and 
emotional difficulties, information needs and other 
unmet needs.24 25 However, we know little about factors 
that influence medication taking among stroke survivors 
with disabilities (ie, physical or cognitive) living in the 
community (ie, not in nursing homes), their unmet needs 
around the use of medicines or the proportion relying on 
caregivers for some or all aspects of medicine taking.
To date, survey instruments examining the unmet 
needs of stroke survivors have not focused on practical 
aspects of medication taking such as how patients collect 
or handle their medicines.
The aims of this investigation were to design an instru-
ment to evaluate the support stroke survivors get with 
taking their medicines, characterise patients receiving 
help with medications, estimate the proportion who 
have unmet needs with daily medicine taking and who 
miss medications. We additionally aimed to identify the 
predictors of missing medicines and of experiencing 
unmet needs with medications.
This knowledge can inform the development of primary 
care interventions aimed at improving medication taking 
in this patient group.
MethODs
Questionnaire development workshops
To develop the questionnaire, current literature evidence 
was evaluated17 and 3 workshops were conducted with 26 
stroke survivors and 12 caregivers in the East of England 
(St John’s College, Cambridge 200926: 7 patients, 1 care-
giver; Different Strokes, Cambridge 2012: 9 patients, 
3 caregivers; Peterborough, 2012: 10 patients, 8 care-
givers). Recruitment was opportunistic and no purposive 
sampling was applied. The workshops were organised in 
the context of gathering patient and public involvement 
(PPI) input into research grant applications aimed at 
improving adherence to medication after stroke.17
The survey questions were developed through thematic 
analysis27 of workshops field notes.
A fourth workshop was conducted to gather feedback 
on the questionnaire using a PPI exercise with 11 stroke 
survivors and 3 caregivers recruited through a local stroke 
group (Different Strokes, East of England). Two stroke 
survivors from this group took part in subsequent 'think-
aloud' interviews, which involved talking out loud as they 
read the questionnaire, continually verbalising what they 
were thinking.
Postal survey
In respect to sample size, 400 returned questionnaires 
would allow good precision for prevalence estimates. The 
95% CIs on various proportions with this sample size were 
calculated using the Wilson score method (with continuity 
correction) and are as follows: 50% (45.00% to 55.00%), 
25% (20.89% to 29.60%), 5% (3.16 to 7.74%). With 600 
questionnaires, the improvement in the precision of the 
estimates would be as follows: 45.93% to 54.07%, 21.62% 
to 28.70% and 3.46% to 7.14%, respectively.
General practices in primary care in the East of 
England and London were approached through the Clin-
ical Research Network (CRN). CRN Eastern contacted 20 
general practitioner (GP) practices, of which 11 replied 
and took part in the study. CRN North London contacted 
140 GP East London practices by email (Tower Hamlets, 
Newham and National Health Service City & Hackney 
Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)), of which only 
two replied and participated in the study. Five of the eight 
GP practices contacted in North London (Barnet CCG) 
through a research coordinator took part in the study.
Patients with stroke and their caregivers were sent the 
postal questionnaire according to the following criteria.
Inclusion criteria
Patients
 
► All patients aged >18 on the practice stroke register 
with documented history of stroke.
Caregivers
 
► Anyone identified by the patient as having a role 
helping with medicine taking.
exclusion criteria
 
► Patients who suffered a transient ischaemic attack 
(TIA) but not a stroke.
 
► Palliative or end-of-life patients.
 
► Patients 
receiving 
institutional 
long-term 
care 
(receiving total care in residential homes or living in 
nursing homes).
 
► Patients considered unsuitable to take part in the 
study by their GP.

restriction was placed on the recruitment of survivors who 
were dependent for ADLs or lacking capacity. The list was 
screened by a practice GP and anyone not meeting the 
inclusion criteria or who was considered unsuitable for 
the study was excluded. Reasons for unsuitability were not 
collected for practical reasons.
survey participant recruitment
Eligible participants were sent a study survey pack by prac-
tice staff between September 2016 and February 2017. 
Study recruitment packs included two invitation letters, 
information sheets, questionnaires and postal version 
of Barthel Index,28 one of which was for completion by 
the patient and the other by the caregiver. The Barthel 
Index provides a measure of functional independence 
and physical functioning and has been used in stroke 
research previously.29 Patients with Barthel score of 20 
were categorised as independent for ADLs, those with 
score 15–19 moderately dependent for ADLs and those 
with scores 0–14 severely dependent.30 If receiving help 
with medications, the patient was asked to pass to their 
caregiver the invitation letter and information sheet 
and invite him/her to complete their copy of the ques-
tionnaire, providing answers on the patient’s medicine 
taking. Family members, friends or paid caregivers of 
stroke survivors who were severely disabled and/or lacked 
mental capacity were invited to fill and return the care-
givers’ questionnaires only on behalf of patients. The 
information sheets stated that consent was implied by 
returning the completed questionnaire. Participants were 
asked to return completed questionnaires to the research 
centre in the Freepost envelopes provided. A second mail 
out of the study invitation pack was sent to all patients as 
a reminder, 2 weeks after the first one.
survey AnAlysIs
Survey data entry was performed by Document Capture 
Company.31 Individual patients’ characteristics (age, 
gender, time since stoke, number of daily medicines) were 
collected from the questionnaires themselves. Practice 
population, number of patients on stroke registers, depri-
vation score and ethnicity were taken from the National 
General Practice profiles (https:// 
fingertips. 
phe. 
org. 
uk/ 
profile/ 
general- 
practice). The proportions of patients in 
each sociodemographic category, needing help taking 
medication, missing any medication in the previous 30 
days and reporting the need for more help taking medi-
cation were estimated. When the survivor and caregiver 
questionnaires were both returned together, study data 
were collected from the patient’s questionnaire only. 
The associations between ‘unmet needs’ and age (<or 
≥70 years), gender, total number of medicines taken, 
dependence for ADLs, years since stroke and receiving 
help with medicines were investigated with individual 
logistic regression models (a different model per variable 
investigated), adjusted each and all of them for age and 
gender. Individual logistic regression models adjusted for 
age and gender were also used to estimate the association 
between ‘missed medicines in the previous 30 days’ and 
age (< or >70 years), gender, total number of medicines 
taken, dependent for ADLs, years since stroke, help with 
medicines and unmet needs (a different model adjusted 
for age and gender per variable investigated). Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to investigate if predictors of 
missing medication or unmet needs vary when the anal-
ysis was done on the whole dataset versus on question-
naires filled by patients only.
χ2 tests were used to compare the responses on unmet 
needs and missing medication given by patients versus 
caregivers.
All statistical analysis has been conducted with Stata V.14 
(StataCorp).
results
Questionnaire development
Taking medications emerged as an important issue in all 
three workshops: nearly half of patients stated that a family 
member or friend was supporting them with daily medi-
cine routines especially in relation to prompting medicine 
taking. This was put down to effects of the stroke itself 
on memory retention rather than general memory prob-
lems that people without stroke also experience. They 
admitted missing doses due to forgetting. Only a small 
proportion of survivors were actually handling their own 
prescriptions and were relying on support from family 
and/or community services. In one workshop, almost all 
survivors had dosette medication boxes and agreed that 
taking medications out of safety bottles and blister packs 
was a problem due to physical disabilities.
Thematic analysis of workshop data revealed five main 
practical domains of support needed with medication 
taking: (1) dealing with prescriptions and collection of 
medicines; (2) getting medicines out of the box, blister 
packs of bottles; (3) prompting ‘It’s time to take your 
medicine’; (4) swallowing medicines and (5) checking 
whether medicines have been taken. The final study 
questionnaire (see online supplementary file 1) included 
questions relating to each of these five domains, one item 
related to adherence (missed medicine in the last 30 
days) and an assessment of disabilities through comple-
tion of the validated postal version of the Barthel Index.28 
The questionnaire was adapted for caregivers (see online 
supplementary file 2).
Questionnaire finalisation
On the basis of the fourth workshop and two 'think-aloud' 
interviews, we reworded the survey questions (eg, from 
‘Do you get help with’ was changed into ‘Is somebody 
helping you with’) and used a scale response 'all the 
time', ‘often’, ‘sometimes’, ‘rarely’, ‘never’ for the first 
question of each of the five survey domains, which was 
originally conceived as a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer (see online 
supplementary files 1,2 for text of questions).

survey
Practice characteristics
Eighteen GP practices agreed to take part in the study, 
of which just over 1/3 were in London (n=7). GP prac-
tices were relatively large with an average population of 
11 904 patients (SD=4010) and a low to moderate level of 
deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation32: mean 7.05: 
SD 3.19). Out of 3066 patients on the stroke registers, 
1687 patients with stroke (55%) were considered eligible 
for the study and received the postal questionnaire. The 
average response rate of East of England and London 
practices was 42% and 27%, respectively. The response 
rate varied between 16% and 53% across practices.
Participant characteristics
A total of 596 participants returned a completed ques-
tionnaire (549 (92.1%) from patients, 47 (7.9%) from 
caregivers showing a mean response rate of 35% (0.33–
0.37)). Participants were on average 72.7 years old; 37.8% 
(n=210) of the sample were female (see table 1). There 
were a high proportion of white patients in the recruited 
practices (79%), which were on average 21% of mixed or 
ethnic minority background. Approximately 28% of study 
participants were completely independent for ADLs.
Participants getting any kind of help with medicines 
were on average 73.6 years old, two-thirds were male with 
only 19% of this group completely independent for ADLs.
Patients with unmet needs were on average 69 years old, 
predominantly male (71%) and 56.86% were severely 
dependent for ADLs. Patients who missed medications 
were on average 70 years old, 64% were male and the 
majority (48%) were moderately dependent for ADLs.
support with daily medication taking
Overall, 55.5% (95% CI 51.7 to 59.7) of the participants 
received help in at least one aspect of taking medication, 
in that they ticked one of the options from ‘all the time’ 
to ‘rarely’ on one or more of the five questions related 
to medicine taking. Eleven per cent (95% CI 8.8 to 13.9) 
of patients reported experiencing unmet needs and 
needing more help with at least one of the aspects of 
taking medication, in that they ticked 'yes' to the question 
‘do you feel you need more help’ on one or more of the 
five questions related to medicine taking. The proportion 
of questionnaires reporting unmet needs filled in by care-
givers, 19.6% (n=9), and by patients, 10.7% (n=57), had 
no significant difference (P=0.068).
Among the participants, help was needed to some 
degree with prescriptions and collection of medicines 
(49.8%), getting medicines out of the box or packet 
(27.9%), reminding to take medicines (36.4%), swal-
lowing medicines (20.2%) and checking that medicines 
have been taken (34.1%) (see table 2). Being reminded 
to take medicines, dealing with prescriptions and collec-
tion of medicines and getting medicines out of a pack or 
bottle were the most commonly reported areas of unmet 
needs. Almost two-thirds of participants (65.3%) reported 
never missing medicines in the last 30 days. Out of the

34.7% of patients who said they missed taking medicine 
at any point in the previous 30 days, 23.9% said rarely, 
9.3% sometimes, 0.8% often and 0.7% all the time. The 
proportion of questionnaires reporting missing medica-
tion at some point, filled in by caregivers, 27.7% (n=13), 
and by patients 35.3% (n=193), had no significant differ-
ence (P=0.292).
Factors associated with unmet needs
Being on a higher total number of daily medications (OR: 
1.2, (1.1 to 1.3), P<0.001), severe dependence for ADLs 
(OR: 11.6 (4.2 to 32.4) P<0.001) and receiving any kind of 
help (OR: 5.9, (2.7 to 11.6), P<0.001) in relation to taking 
medication was associated with experiencing unmet 
needs. Getting help with swallowing medicines (OR: 
6.8, (3.8 to 12.0), P<0.001) and getting medicines out 
of a box, blister packs or bottles (OR: 6.6, (3.6 to 11.8), 
P<0.001) showed the strongest associations with experi-
encing unmet needs (see table 3).
When the analyses were conducted with data from 
questionnaires filled by patients only, the variables 
significantly associated with unmet needs were the same, 
apart from years since stroke (see online supplementary 
appendix 1).
Factors associated with missing medications
Being older (age ≥70) was associated with a lower prob-
ability of missing medication (OR: 0.6 (0.4 to 0.9) 
P=0.006). Being on a higher number of daily medicines 
(polypharmacy) (OR: 1.1 (1.0 to 1.1), P=0.008) and 
getting any kind of help with medicine taking (OR: 2.1 
(1.4 to 3.0) p<0.001) was associated with higher proba-
bility of missing medicines. The more unmet needs stroke 
survivors had with taking medication, the more likely 
they were to miss their medicines (OR: 5.3 (3.0 to 9.4), 
P<0.001) (see table 4). When the analyses were conducted 
with data from questionnaires filled by patients only, the 
variables significantly associated with missing medication 
were the same (see online supplementary appendix 1).

summary of findings
From workshops, we identified five key issues that 
patients regarded as important with medication taking 
after stroke. We converted these into a five-item question-
naire that we distributed to people on stroke registers in 
18 general practices. We obtained a response rate of 35%. 
Among respondents, 56% of survivors in the community 
were receiving help in some aspect of daily medication 
taking, 11% reported needing more help in at least one 
domain of medicine taking and 34% missed taking their 
medicines at some point in the previous 30 days.
A higher total number of daily medicines, being severely 
dependent for ADLs and receiving help with medication, 
were predictors of experiencing at least one unmet need 
in respect of medication taking. Stroke survivors who 
were younger, taking a higher number of daily medicines 
and experiencing a greater number of unmet needs were 
more likely to miss medications.
This work identified issues from a population that 
includes patients severely affected by stroke, who are 
often excluded from research.17 Results presented here 
shed light on the effect of stroke-related impairments 
on practical domains and predictors of medicine taking,

which are shown to have significant effects on overall 
adherence.
strengths and limitations
A strength of this study is that the questionnaire was devel-
oped from patients’ and caregivers’ own views gathered 
through workshops. Although not recruited through 
purposive sampling, workshop participants suffered from 
a range of stroke-related impairments, as highlighted by 
the reported use of dosette boxes, dependence on others 
for aspects of medicine taking like prompting medica-
tion times and dependence for ADLs such as collecting 
prescriptions and taking tablets out of boxes. In the 
postal survey, the inclusion of stroke survivors regardless 
of level of dependence for ADLs permitted investigating 
a population who are understudied,17 yet may have signif-
icant unmet needs that can affect their adherence to 
medications. This investigation highlights caregivers’ role 
in managing medicines in survivors dependent for ADLs.
However, study limitations should also be considered. 
The response rate across recruited GP practices was 
low and harder to reach stroke survivors may have been 
missed. Poor response rate is a source of bias that might 
affect our estimates.
Interestingly, considering the average age at stroke in 
England (ie, 74 for men and 80 years for women),19 our 
participants’ population was slightly younger (73 years), 
perhaps reflecting the fact that patients receiving insti-
tutional long-term care were excluded from the study or 
that older people found it harder taking part in a postal 
survey. Through the Barthel score, we did not assess 
cognition directly, although low cognitive function is asso-
ciated with poor adherence.33 As the Barthel focuses on 
physical disability, it is not known to what extent study 
participants were cognitively impaired or suffered from 
communication difficulties like aphasia. In addition, 
dependency for ADLs could have been caused by existing 
comorbidities other than stroke. We did not collect infor-
mation on the use of blister packaged medication or 
devices to aid compliance, which could have influenced 
medication-taking practices. Finally, this study examined 
all medicine taking and did not differentiate between 
stroke secondary prevention medications and other drug 
categories.
Comparisons with existing research
To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that 
more than half of all stroke survivors get help with some 
aspect of medicine taking and that those receiving help 
are more likely to have unmet needs. This provides some 
insight in to why adherence to medication in stroke survi-
vors may be poor.34
Moreover, the greater the number of medicines, the 
more likely stroke survivors were to miss medications. 
Addressing pill burden by simplifying drug regimens 
may be an important focus for future interventions. 
Indeed the polypill approach to medication taking has 
been shown to reduce cardiovascular as well as total pill 
burden in a primary care setting.35 Simpler dosing regi-
mens are known to be associated with better medication

adherence,36 while fewer medicines has been shown to 
be an independent predictor of long-term medication 
persistence among stroke survivors.37 38 A recent trial 
incorporating a fixed-dose combination polypill approach 
to taking cardiovascular medicine demonstrated better 
adherence among patients receiving a single pill.39
Receiving help with prescriptions and collecting medi-
cines was identified as the area where most help was 
received (49.7% of respondents). Stroke survivors who are 
dependent for ADLs may face considerable practical chal-
lenges accessing healthcare resources at the pharmacy 
and the GP practice. A recent study in the USA found that 
around two-thirds of caregivers were involved in at least 
one medication management activity of elderly patients 
and that high involvement in instrumental ADLs was asso-
ciated with the caregiver providing the patient with assis-
tance in ordering medicines.40 Filling prescriptions is also 
known to be an important factor influencing medication 
adherence.41 42 Indeed caregivers can play a significant 
role in ensuring appropriate medication taking. A recent 
interview study exploring potential barriers and facili-
tators of medication adherence in stroke identified the 
central role of the caregiver in medication adherence.43 
Our evaluation of an online stroke forum also confirmed 
the important role of the caregiver in facilitating medi-
cation adherence.14 Monitoring prescription collections, 
liaising with the GP and pharmacy, increasing the time 
between prescriptions or arranging medication deliv-
eries, may help to address prescription needs.
Around 11% of stroke survivors reported unmet medi-
cation needs. We found that stroke survivors severely 
dependent for ADLs and receiving help with medicines 
were more likely to report unmet needs, which is in line 
with a recent study investigating stroke/TIA survivors 
in Australia, where greater functional ability was associ-
ated with fewer unmet needs, including those related to 
secondary prevention.44 In previous research on unmet 
needs among stroke survivors, a 44-item survey study by 
McKevitt and colleagues reported that 49% of stroke 
survivors had at least one unmet need,25 while in a study of 
Australian survivors who completed a 58-item survey, the 
percentage was 84%.24 Both these studies however, exam-
ined unmet needs over a variety of domains including 
health, work, leisure and everyday living, social support 
and finances, whereas our study focused on medication 
needs only.
Getting help to take medicines out of a box, packet 
or bottle was the area where the greatest proportion of 
stroke survivors needed help all of the time. We previ-
ously found that the use of pill boxes and blister-packed 
medication to be both a facilitator35 and a barrier14 to 
adherence among stroke survivors,15 while interventions 
using blister packaging and pill boxes have been found 
to be associated with improved adherence.45 Although 
electronic 
medication 
devices 
were 
considered 
potentially effective in improving medication-taking 
behaviour among patients with cognitive impairments, 
success in using such devices was dependent on the 
patient having a good level of dexterity, while removing 
the medication from these devices was also found to be 
challenging.46–48
The need for further support in this domain, as reported 
in the current study, suggests that handling medications 
remains problematic for stroke survivors.
An interesting finding from this survey study is that 
stroke survivors who missed medicines were younger. 
This is consistent with other research on adherence in 
stroke that found that younger age was predictive of poor 
adherence49 and has also been described in patients 
taking medication for cardiovascular disease.50 The 
finding in the present study contrasts with the view that 
older patients are more likely to face difficulties taking 
medication,51 52 which is frequently attributed to higher 
number of pre-existing comorbidities resulting in poly-
pharmacy and increased complexity of medication-taking 
regimens. The fact that older patients may be less likely to 
miss medicines might be down to the support they receive 
from caregivers. Our findings suggests that support 
needed with medications may be overlooked in younger 
stroke survivors.53
In this study, a significant proportion of patients 
admitted missing medications occasionally. There is 
evidence that improving adherence by one antihyper-
tensive pill/week for a once-a-day regimen reduces the 
hazard of stroke by 8%–9% and death by 7%.54 Each 
incremental 25% increase in proportion of days covered 
with statin medications is associated with a 0.10 mmol/L 
reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.55 56 
Non-adherence to cardiovascular medications is associ-
ated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality.57
Implications for clinical practice
A significant proportion of patients, particularly those 
who take large numbers of tablets, are disabled or receive 
help to take medication, have unmet needs and miss their 
tablets, which can increase risk of recurrent cardiovascular 
events. These particularly vulnerable groups of patients 
might benefit from focused clinical attention. Through 
understanding the needs of survivors and caregivers in 
different aspects of daily medication taking, we can help 
direct future resources to the areas of greatest need. For 
example, further exploration of medication packaging 
is warranted to understand the difficulties stroke survi-
vors face handling medicines. Polypharmacy remains 
a difficulty for older patients. Therefore, exploring the 
use of combination pills and further efforts to reduce the 
burden of multiple medications among stroke survivors 
is warranted.
The questionnaire we have developed could be used to 
understand the challenges around medication faced by 
other patient groups. Unmet medication needs among 
UK stroke survivors have not been previously explored 
in the context of activities both survivors and caregivers 
consider important for taking medicines. Through under-
standing the extent of unmet needs as well as the areas 
in which these are greatest, strategies can be developed

which address poor medication-taking practices and 
therefore improve medication adherence.
Future research
Novel interventions focussing on the practicalities of 
taking medicines and aimed at improving stroke survi-
vors’ adherence to treatment are needed. The findings 
reported here may inform the development of such inter-
ventions. Advances in technology have the potential to 
facilitate delivery of such interventions, for example, elec-
tronic devices prompting medication-taking times.58 59 
Efforts to improve medication taking among survivors of 
stroke using technology are already under way and have 
shown promise.60
