adjusted lachrymosity syndrome
(AALS)’’?

ABSTRACT
Objective. In the media, numerous public figures have reported involuntary emotional
outbursts arising from watching films on planes, resembling neurological phenomena
such as pseudobulbar affect. Putative risk factors put forward include altitude, mild
hypoxia, or alcohol. Our objective was to determine whether watching a film on an
airplane is really more likely to induce involuntary, uncontrollable, or surprising crying
than watching one on the ground, described in some social media as ‘‘altitude-adjusted
lachrymosity syndrome’’ (AALS), or whether this is a pseudo-phenomena.
Methods. Amazon Mechanical Turk survey participants (N = 1,084) living in the
United States who had watched a film on a plane in the past 12 months were invited
to complete an online survey. The main outcome measures were likelihood of crying
in a logistic regression model including location of viewing, age, gender, genre of film,
subjective film rating, annual household income, watching a ‘‘guilty pleasure’’ film,
drinking alcohol, feeling tired or jetlagged, or having a recent emotional life event.
Results. About one in four films induced crying. Watching a film on a plane per se
does not appear to induce involuntary crying. Significant predictors of crying included
dramas or family films, a recent life event, watching a ‘‘guilty pleasure’’, high film
ratings, and female gender. Medical conditions, age, income, alcohol use, and feeling
tired or jetlagged were not significant.
Conclusion. People reporting the pseudo-phenomena of AALS are most likely expe-
riencing ‘‘dramatically heightened exposure’’, watching as many films on a plane in a
week’s return trip as they would in a year at the cinema. Such perceptions are probably
magnified by confirmation bias and further mentions in social media.

INTRODUCTION
Mark Kermode, Film critic: ‘‘Your movies...provoke very visceral, very physical reactions,
very emotional responses and occasionally I think some critics are simply sideswiped by
them’’.
How to cite this article Wicks and Lancashire (2018), No tears in heaven: did the media create the pseudo-phenomenon ‘‘altitude-
adjusted lachrymosity syndrome (AALS)’’? PeerJ 6:e4569; DOI 10.7717/peerj.4569
 David Cronenberg, Film director: ‘‘We should put all those critics on a plane and have
them watch. I’m just noticing, and talking to some other people who’ve had the same
reaction, that a movie that perhaps you would be very cool to on the ground, when you’re
watching on an airplane with the thrumming of the motors and the compressed air and
so on, things suddenly become much more emotional and strange...A movie that I would
probably have great disdain for on the ground, I find myself weeping over in an airplane.
I don’t know whether it’s because you’re constantly fearing for your life or what it is but
seeing movies on an airplane is actually quite a different experience. A lesser one in some
ways but weirdly more intense in others.’’
(Kermode & Mayo, 2007)
Today, numerous anecdotal reports in mainstream and social media describe otherwise
healthy individuals being prone to outbursts of uncontrollable crying while watching films
on airplanes. An ‘‘index case’’ may be the film director David Cronenberg, who suggested
that watching a film on an airplane caused him to experience a different set of emotional
reactions than watching a film on the ground. This interview took place on the popular
BBC podcast ‘‘Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review’’, which has between 1–2 million listeners
per week (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2014). Over the years, enthusiastic listeners to
the program even coined a medical-sounding term for this potential phenomena: ‘‘altitude
adjusted lachrymosity syndrome’’ (AALS). In AALS, healthy people report crying at scenes
they wouldn’t normally consider to be emotional when viewing films in other settings, such
as at the cinema or at home, have difficulty suppressing the urge to cry, and are surprised
at which films make them cry.
Since the potential index case, numerous claims of the phenomena have been made
by prominent individuals in mass media settings. A subsequent sufferer, the film director
Quentin Tarantino reported during a television interview on the Late Show with Stephen
Colbert (around three million viewers): ‘‘There’s something about watching a romantic
comedy on an airplane flight; I think you become more emotional when you’re three
miles high in the air. I have found myself crying, just literally weeping at (movies I’d
be embarrassed to confess that I’d watched)’’ (Tarantino & Colbert, 2015). A clip of the
interview has been viewed on YouTube nearly 400,000 times. Another film director, Tim
Burton, was quoted in the New York Times (with around nine million daily readers) as
saying ‘‘I don’t know why, maybe because you constantly think you’re going to die—I find
every movie, I cry if I watch it on a plane’’ (Groening, 2014). Another potential sufferer,
the comedian David Baddiel said in an interview with the Guardian (around 150,000 daily
readers): ‘‘I cry a lot. Especially on planes. What is that about? On a plane, I’ll be in floods
at The Good Dinosaur (an animated family film)’’ (Greenstreet, 2016). As a public health
measure to educate passengers about this phenomena, in 2011 the airline Virgin Atlantic
(flying around five million customers annually) placed ‘‘weep warning’’ disclaimers before
films such as Toy Story 3, stating: ‘‘The following film contains scenes which may cause
viewers of a sensitive disposition to cry, weep, sob, wail, howl, bawl, bleat or mewl (Gunner,
2017)’’ Such warnings were widely covered in the mainstream media and online including
respectable sources like the BBC (Gray, 2017).

 About two billion people fly commercially each year, with a recent review describing a
range of potential associated health issues such as venous thromboembolism, jet lag, poor
cabin air quality, cosmic-radiation exposure, and the exacerbation of pre-existing medical
conditions (Silverman & Gendreau, 2009). Evidence from surveys, qualitative shadowing,
and experience monitoring confirms that air travel can be a stressful experience, with
stressors including going through security, getting to the gate on time, and being treated
rudely by others (Ahmadpour, Robert & Lindgaard, 2014; McMullin et al., 2014).
Uncontrollable episodes of crying or laughter that are incongruent with an individual’s
feelings or situation affect as many as half of people living with neurological conditions such
as ALS/MND, MS, stroke, or dementia (Miller, Pratt & Schiffer, 2011). Known variously
as ‘‘labile affect’’, ‘‘emotional lability’’, ‘‘emotional incontinence’’, or pseudo-bulbar affect
(PBA), disruption of glutamatergic cerebellar microcircuitry is thought to lead to motor
disinhibition (Ahmed & Simmons, 2013). There is a single FDA-approved treatment for
PBA, (dextromethorphan hydrobromide 20 mg + quinidine sulfate 10 mg, NueDexta R
�;
Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) which can reduce the frequency of PBA
attacks by around 50% (Brooks et al., 2004), and off-label use of antidepressants to treat
PBA is common (Ahmed & Simmons, 2013). Consequences of PBA are serious and can
involve embarrassment, social isolation, and depression as people around those affected
find it hard to understand the affected individual’s outbursts (Strowd et al., 2010).
The evidence for emotional changes in healthy people on airplanes is limited. A single
randomized, controlled barometric manipulation study found a 4% decrease in oxygen
saturation at altitude and evidence of altitude sickness symptoms including ‘‘distress’’ in
healthy people subjected to a simulated 20-hour airline flight (Muhm et al., 2007).
However, with the exception of a single unscientific Facebook poll conducted by Virgin
Atlantic, no researchers have sought to systematically understand the phenomenon and
its risk factors. The development of new ‘‘diagnoses’’ can be harmful, leading to increased
health anxiety, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary treatment (Hurley, 2017). The perpetuation
of such myths in the media may be considered a manifestation of ‘‘fake news’’ in a medical
context. Therefore, we sought to understand whether AALS was a real syndrome and, if so,
to understand its underlying etiology.
OBJECTIVES
Our prespecified hypothesis was that, controlling for other factors, participants watching a
film in the air would be more likely to cry, feel the urge to cry, or be surprised at how much
they cried than when watching a film on the ground. We also developed specific secondary
hypotheses about potential risk factors identified by sufferers (described below).
METHODS
A retrospective online survey was selected as the most practical approach, with an aim to
recruit participants who had watched a film on an airplane and who had then subsequently
watched another film on the ground.

 Survey development
Search terms on Pubmed such as ‘‘altitude adjusted lachrymosity syndrome’’, ‘‘crying
on planes’’, ‘‘crying altitude’’, ‘‘altitude tearfulness’’, and ‘‘pseudobulbar affect altitude’’
failed to yield any previous studies. The use of online ‘‘grey literature’’ or social media for
concept elicitation has been previously established as feasible (McCarrier et al., 2016), so a
search on Google was performed for ‘‘Crying on planes’’, which produced a range of blogs,
newspaper articles, and podcasts which anecdotally described the phenomenon in great
detail (Appendix S1).
From these qualitative data, survey items (Appendix S2) were developed to estimate the
likelihood of crying, uncontrollable crying, or surprise at crying, with items and responses
based upon the validated Center for Neurologic Study Lability Scale (CNS-LS) (Moore et
al., 1997). Participants were asked to categorize the film according to the categories listed
on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) and to rate the film for quality from 0–10
stars.
Further items evaluated the many speculative risk factors that have been reported by
sufferers, such as genre of film (romantic comedies > dramas), choosing a film they would
normally be embarrassed to watch (guilty pleasure > regular film choice), use of alcohol
(alcohol > no alcohol), experiencing a recent emotional event (event > no event), or having
a medical condition that might affect their emotional reaction such as a mood disorder
or PBA-related condition like ALS/MND or MS (condition > no condition). Domains
over which participants were unlikely to report reliable data, such as flight altitude, oxygen
levels, air pressure, or more abstract concepts like ‘‘catharsis’’ were not given specific items,
but an optional free text box was provided for any further observations about participants’
emotions watching the film.
Pilot fielding
A small pilot fielding was conducted using a US Census-representative sample via
SurveyMonkey ‘‘Targeted Audience’’ system. To recruit a target N of 50 who watched
a film, 122 respondents were screened, with slight over-recruitment leading to N = 56.
Minimizing bias
Amongst the pilot respondents, 33 (27%) had watched a film on a plane in the past 12
months, 49 (40%) more than 12 months ago, and 40 (33%) had never seen a film on a
plane. Review of film titles showed that 35% of respondents who had last seen a film more
than 12 months ago could not remember what they saw, compared to just 16% of those
who had seen the film within the past 12 months. Accordingly, for the main study we
changed the title of the survey invitation to clarify we were seeking responses only from
respondents who had watched a film on a plane in the past 12 months to minimize recall
bias. Median time to complete the test fielding was 3 min.
Statistical analysis
Main hypotheses and exploratory factors were developed and defined in advance of data
collection. Because respondents watched different films in each setting, a within-subjects
comparison was not suitable. Due to the design of the survey and the release schedule of
Wicks and Lancashire (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4569
4/15
 films differing between ground viewing (summer blockbuster season) and plane viewing
(typically a six month delay from the cinema), we planned for a binary logistic regression
to predict the likelihood of crying at a film given 11 predictor variables: plane vs. ground
location, film genre, gender, annual household income, film rating (0–10 stars, higher is
better), experiencing a recent emotional life event, watching a guilty pleasure film, alcohol
use, feeling tired, having a medical condition, and age (the only continuous variable). In
addition, we report a number of unplanned exploratory post-hoc analyses using chi-square
tests (alpha = 0.05; two tailed). Crying questions were asked using a Likert scale but
collapsed into binary categories for analysis. Participants with missing data were excluded
from further analysis. Statistical analysis were conducted in SPSS v21 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY, USA), R Core Team (2017) and Python Software Foundation (2018) using the
Keras package.
Power analysis
Given the absence of prior data from the literature we relied on pilot data to form a power
analysis. From the pilot data, 30% of films watched on a plane elicited crying as opposed to
22% of films watched on the ground. Calculation of effect size using chi-squared statistic
(Hulley et al., 2013) using a baseline risk of 22% and an exposed risk of 30% resulted in an
odds ratio of 1.519, risk ratio of 1.364 and total required sample of 992 (496 reports on
both ground and in air) to achieve 80% power (Type II error = 0.2) at a significance of
0.05 (Type I error rate).
Survey population
While SurveyMonkey provided a representative sample for the pilot fielding, it was
relatively expensive ($4.24 per complete survey, with $0.50 being donated to charity on
each participant’s’ behalf). Therefore we sought to use Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk),
a widely used resource for rapid gathering of voluntary research participants (e.g., a recent
study on the potential health benefits of Pokemon Go (Howe et al., 2016)). While some
concerns have been expressed about the validity and representativeness of mTurkers,
a recent review of 35 validation studies in the health and medical literature confirmed
‘‘mTurk is an efficient, reliable, cost-effective tool for generating sample responses that are
largely comparable to those collected via conventional meanings’’ (Mortensen & Hughes,
2018).
Guidance from the mTurk community itself suggests that ‘‘fair payment’’ is considered
the US Federal minimum wage of $0.12/min (Salehi, 2016). Therefore respondents were
offered $0.36 for completing the survey, which, with Amazon’s fees, yielded a total cost per
participant of $0.50. After a test run of N = 9 participants to ensure the survey was working
and that data was valid (a co-pilot), the survey was fielded to a target N of 1,000 mTurk
workers. Only mTurk users living in the US with a 98% accuracy rating for prior tasks were
eligible to take part. To minimize fraud, participants were provided with a random digit
code at the end of the survey to enter into mTurk to receive their payment. Mechanical
Turk users choose which studies to participate in and are free to withdraw at any time. As a
minimal risk study with no personally identifiable information gathered, ethical approval
was not sought for this project.

 Per the Open Science Framework (osf.io), the authors confirm that they have reported
all measures, conditions, data exclusions, and determination of sample size.
RESULTS
Between July 14–July 16 2017, 1,238 participants started the survey of whom 154 were
disqualified for having seen a film more than 12 months ago (12%) for a total of 1,084
surveys started. As others have reported (Howe et al., 2016), due to the nature of the mTurk
platform, it is impossible to calculate a response rate from the number of people who may
have seen the study posting online or understand the demographics of non-responders.
Missing data was found for 49 respondents (4%) and these were excluded for a total of 1,035
respondents. The survey was closed for fielding on July 17th 2017 and took participants an
average of 2.5 min to complete.
Amongst survey respondents, 450 (43.4%) were female, with a mean age of 32.1 years
(SD 9.1, median 30, range 18–74) and with 37% living in households earning below
$50,000 USD per year. Relative to 2015 US census data, this sample has fewer females
(census: 50.8%), is younger (census median: 37.6 years), and is slightly wealthier than the
general US population (US Census Bureau, 2015; US Census Bureau, 2017).
Respondents reported on 1,035 film viewings in the air and 904 on the ground, of which
340 (38%) were seen on television, 337 (38%) at the cinema, and 238 (26%) on a computer,
tablet, or smartphone. Participants reported crying at 25% of films in the air (lower than
the 30% identified in the pilot) as opposed to 22% on the ground (same as pilot). Table 1
describes the films reported, crying behaviour, and crying triggers. Examination of the
frequencies clearly demonstrates that participants chose to watch different categories of
films by setting, with more comedies, animated, and drama films being seen in the air and
more action films being watched on the ground. There was not perfect agreement between
participants on which genre a film belonged to, e.g., ‘‘Moana’’ could be classified as a family
film, an animated film or a comedy. Where there was a modal response this was selected
for classification, or in the event of a tie the film’s category was selected from its listing
on IMDB.com. Film genres were collapsed into larger groups on the basis of higher-order
IMDB categories (e.g., comedy + romantic comedy).
For the primary analysis, a logistic regression model was fitted to the binary outcome of
whether or not the participant cried at all (1) or never (0) while watching the film. Results
are shown in Table 2.
Factors shown to be significant in predicting crying behaviour included the type of film
(with dramas being much more likely to elicit crying), female gender, having had a recent
emotional experience, choosing a ‘‘guilty pleasure’’ film, and watching a highly rated film
(10/10 stars).
Contrary to our expectations, we did not find an effect of location (plane vs. ground)
as significant in the model. Age, annual household income, feeling tired, or drinking
alcohol were not significant factors either. Cross-validated predictive modelling using
logistic regression resulted in a ROC AUC of 0.71, sensitivity 0.66 and specificity 0.64 when
predicting probability of crying. Film category and gender dominated the model, consistent

with the findings above. Similar results were seen when predicting the urge to cry, and
the feeling of being surprised by crying. Contrary to our expectations, more participants
reported being ‘‘surprised at crying’’ at films on the ground (11.3%) than in the air (8.6%).
In clinical practice, air travellers may exhibit multiple risk factors; therefore Table 3
outlines a stepped treatment approach modelled on guidance for the prevention of deep
vein thrombosis in the air (Silverman & Gendreau, 2009). Table 4 identifies individual films
current at the time of the study but also particular genres that are likely to induce crying.

DISCUSSION
We found that AALS is probably not a real medical condition. We found no evidence
of increased crying resulting from high altitude in terms of frequency of crying, control
over crying, or surprise at crying at a heterogeneous array of films within the same

cohort of individuals on planes as opposed to on the ground. This seems true despite
significantly higher levels of proposed triggers for AALS in the air, such as experiencing a
recent emotional event, feeling tired or jetlagged, drinking alcohol, or watching a ‘‘guilty
pleasure’’ film. Contrary to the qualitative descriptions identified in the grey literature
review, there did not appear to be an elevated degree of crying at comedies or romantic
comedies on planes, which had the lowest rates of crying overall. Reassuringly for medical
professionals, there do not appear to be any major implications for aviation medicine in
that only a handful of participants endorsed medical conditions such as depression, anxiety,
pregnancy, or multiple sclerosis as worsening their emotional reactions to a film. Future
studies could replicate these findings in a group of patients at greater risk of pseudobulbar
affect by inviting participants to watch films like in different settings, with and without
medication.
The most likely explanation for the perceived phenomenon of AALS is dramatically
heightened exposure to films in a short space of time. On long-haul flights passengers watch
an average of three films each (Anonymous airline, pers. comm., 2017) and, assuming a

9/15
 return flight, this could mean exposure to six films within a week. With an unadjusted
crying rate of about one in four, that would deem any passenger almost certain to cry at
least once at a film on a plane in the course of their trip. By contrast, data from the US
National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) suggests an average of five trips to the
cinema per annum (National Association of Theatre Owners NATO, 2015). With about half
of these viewings being action films unlikely to elicit crying, it is clear how the perceived
phenomena may have taken root. This, combined with repeated descriptions in the media
and cognitive heuristics such as confirmation bias probably account for the reported
pseudo-phenomenon.
Other factors that were identified by the model included watching dramas or family
films, ‘‘guilty pleasure’’ films, and high-quality films, and having recently experienced an
emotional life event. While a review of factors implicated in adult crying is outside the
scope of the current study (see Vingerhoets & Bylsma, 2016), such factors may be more
associated with ‘‘sentimental or moral tears shed when watching movies with themes such
as eternal love, self-sacrifice, altruism, the good that overcomes the bad, etc.’’ While gender
arose as a significant variable in the model, this is likely to have complex underpinnings
including socialization to certain film choices, and that males may be less likely to accurately
self-report instances of crying (Fischer & LaFrance, 2015). We were surprised at the lack
of surprise reported by participants at crying on planes, given that this appeared to be
a signature characteristic of AALS. However, this may have to do with expectations for
the different film choices made and any pre-existing belief in something like the AALS
pseudo-phenomena i.e., they were not surprised because they chose sad films on a plane.
We were also surprised at the relatively low rates of alcohol use in-flight relative to ground
settings, which may reflect a move by airlines away from free distribution of alcohol to a
cash bar, at least in economy class.
The screening of feature-length films on aircraft first became common in the 1960’s,
and in addition to the commercial and marketing benefits offered the potential to calm
nervous flyers anxious about long-haul flights (Groening, 2016). Originating as 16 mm
film projected to drop-down cinema screens at the front of the cabin, IFE systems evolved
into drop-down televisions in the aisles, then seat-back screens in the late 1980’s and to
modern ‘‘audio-visual on demand’’ (AVOD) touchscreens from the early 2000’s onwards
(Mele, 2017). As technology has improved, passengers have been getting closer and closer
to their screens, gained more control over the choices available to them, and through
increasingly sophisticated noise-cancelling headphones have been drawn into more of a
‘‘bubble’’ in which they can be distracted from the noise and stress of their flight and from
other passengers (Groening, 2016). One model proposes watching IFEs as a ‘‘mediator’’
of emotional function during flight for helping to focus passengers’ attention away from
distressing elements such as the cramped conditions, troublesome neighbours, or boredom
(Ahmadpour, Robert & Lindgaard, 2014). In support of passenger film choice as the key
mechanism, reports of AALS in popular media do not predate the ‘‘video on demand’’ era,
i.e., when whole planeloads of passengers were watching the same film either projected at
the front of the plane, or shown in a fixed loop on seat-back screens, there were no reports
twenty years ago of mass hysterical crying at the end of ‘‘Titanic’’, for instance.
Wicks and Lancashire (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4569
10/15
 The pseudo-phenomenon of AALS is likely to be time-limited, as commercial airlines
are moving from today’s expensive, cumbersome, and heavy AVOD IFE systems to much
cheaper methods of providing high speed internet access to passengers (Mele, 2017).
As passengers migrate from watching films to streaming live television, playing games,
participating in social media, or working, we might expect to see a decline in mentions of
AALS, which could be confirmed through tools such as Google Trends.
One potentially interesting finding arising in our review of the grey literature was that
many newspaper articles and blog posts (Appendix S1) such as Vice, Bustle, Junkee, New
Statesman, and the Guardian, posed a question which the article itself didn’t answer, such
as ‘‘Why do we always cry on planes?’’ Such headline techniques have been described as
‘‘Clickbait’’ designed solely to garner online views to gain advertising revenue (Khoja, 2016).
Further review of the article text showed a high degree of overlap in content (sometimes
verging on plagiarism) and heavy reliance as a reference on a single unscientific poll
commissioned by Virgin Atlantic. In an age of ‘‘fake news’’ it is likely that AALS is merely
a ‘‘pop psychology’’ urban legend, kept alive by confirmation bias when an individual
watches six films on a plane, cries at one, and then selectively recalls only the experience
of crying on a plane when reading a prompt in the news media before going on to ‘‘share’’
the story on social media to further perpetuate the meme.
Limitations
This study had a number of limitations that may compromise validity such as selection
bias, recall bias, the heterogeneity of viewing experiences in the air (e.g., long-haul vacation
with children in economy vs. traveling alone for work in business class) as well as on
the ground (e.g., watching a rerun on television vs. going to the cinema to watch a new
release). Researchers have cautioned that results from mTurk may not generalize to the
US population, and we found our respondents were more likely to be male, younger, and
wealthier than average citizens (Mortensen & Hughes, 2018) Seasonality was not controlled
for, which would have allowed us to discount seasonal affective disorder; however data
was gathered in the summer and most cinema viewings appeared to be recent releases. We
did not gather information on which scenes prompted crying or whether it was the first
time a participant had watched this film. We did not screen participants for psychiatric
disorders with a validated measure, which could have improved confidence that mood
disorders were not a significant factor. We did not ask participants if they were taking any
medication, which may have been a factor.
While the ideal experimental design would involve a randomized crossover trial with
participants watching the same film in the air and on the ground (perhaps in a flight
simulator) and having their lachrymosity recorded using Schirmer’s test (Schirmer, 1903),
or perhaps a thermal imaging camera (Ioannou et al., 2016), this was deemed impractical
and rather expensive. Therefore, this study may be considered a precursor to a more robust
experimental design.

 CONCLUSIONS
In an era of ‘‘fake news’’, ‘‘too much medicine’’ and the ‘‘replication crisis’’ of the social
sciences, it is important that we do not take widely-accepted phenomena as statements of
fact. The cognitive biases and heuristics that allow us to function routinely in the world
are poor proxies for understanding the truth of complex low-frequency events. The rapid
deployment of online surveys to large anonymous samples may be one tool to help dispel
urban legends and encourage a more critical approach to human behaviour.
