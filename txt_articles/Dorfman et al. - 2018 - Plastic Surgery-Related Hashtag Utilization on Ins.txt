Abstract
Background: Recent data suggest patients are seeking aesthetic surgery to improve their appearance on Instagram and other social media. Despite 
the rising influence of Instagram in plastic surgery, few academic publications address Instagram, let alone evaluate its utilization in plastic surgery.
Objectives: We set out to answer the following three questions: 1) what plastic surgery-related content is being posted to Instagram; 2) who is posting 
this content; and 3) what specific hashtags are they using?
Methods: Our study queried 21 Instagram plastic surgery-related hashtags. Content analysis was used to qualitatively evaluate each of the nine “top” 
posts associated with each hashtag (189 posts). Duplicate posts and those not relevant to plastic surgery were excluded.
Results: A total of 1,789,270 posts utilized the 21 hashtags sampled in this study. Of the top 189 posts for these 21 queried hashtags, 163 posts met 
inclusion criteria. Plastic surgeons eligible for membership in American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) accounted for only 17.8% of top posts, 
whereas noneligible physicians accounted for 26.4%. All nonplastic surgery trained physicians marketed themselves as “cosmetic surgeons.” Nine top 
posts (5.5%) were by nonphysicians, including dentists, spas with no associated physician, and a hair salon. The majority of these posts were self-promo-
tional (67.1%) as opposed to educational (32.9%). Board-certified plastic surgeons were significantly more likely to post educational content to Instagram 
as compared to nonplastic surgeons (62.1% vs 38.1%, P = 0.02).
Conclusions: ASAPS eligible board-certified plastic surgeons are underrepresented amongst physicians posting top plastic surgery-related content 
to Instagram.

The Internet and social media have become ubiquitous in 
the world of plastic surgery. In a 2013 study by Vardanian 
et al, more than half of surveyed American Society of 
Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) members used social media for 
personal or professional purposes.1 Even the ASPS and 
American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) 
now have Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.2,3 
Moreover, according to 2017 statistics from the American 
Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 
42% of surgeons report that their patients are seeking aes-
thetic surgery to improve their appearance on Instagram, 
Snapchat, Facebook, and other social media channels.4
As a uniquely visual social media channel, Instagram in 
particular is naturally suited to plastic surgery, a uniquely 
visual surgical specialty. As of 2016, Instagram reports 
more than 400 million monthly active users, and more 
than 80 million photos are uploaded on this platform 
per day.5,6 Like Facebook and Twitter, Instagram utilizes 
hashtags that allow users to identify content of interest. 
For example, when users search a particular hashtag, 
Instagram automatically lists the total number of posts

using that hashtag, as well as the nine “top” or most pop-
ular related posts, at the top of the page. This is followed 
by the remaining posts utilizing that hashtag, which are 
subsequently itemized in chronological order.
Instagram has become a dominant channel for business 
marketing to young adults, and its usage in plastic sur-
gery continues to rise. Many surgeons have been quick 
to embrace Instagram as a tool for patient education as 
well as business development, and have since gained large 
followings.7 Despite the rising influence of this platform, 
very few academic publications even mention Instagram, 
let alone evaluate its utilization in modern plastic surgery. 
Several authors cite Instagram in passing.8-10 Others briefly 
point out advantages, disadvantages, and recommended 
uses of Instagram for plastic surgeons, highlighting its util-
ity for brand development and education.11,12 Nonetheless, 
there are no peer-reviewed studies that quantitatively eval-
uate plastic surgery-related content on Instagram—and 
perhaps more importantly, there are no published reports 
indicating who is responsible for these posts.
Consequently, our study set out to systematically 
answer the following three questions: 1) what plastic sur-
gery-related content is being posted to Instagram; 2) who 
is posting this content; and 3) what specific hashtags are 
they using? In doing so, we address an important gap in 
the surgical literature.
METHODS
Data from Instagram (www.instagram.com) was obtained 
manually on January 9, 2017. Two authors (R.G.D. and 
E.E.V.) queried the following hashtags, which include 
medical and lay person terminology for popular plastic sur-
gery procedures13: 1) #plasticsurgery, 2) #cosmeticsurgery, 
3) #aestheticsurgery, 4) #plasticsurgeon, 5) #cosmeticsur-
geon, 6) #aestheticsurgeon, 7) #breastlift, 8) #mastopexy, 
9) #breastaugmentation, 10) #boobjob, 11) #breastim-
plant, 12) #nosejob, 13) #rhinoplasty, 14) #rhytidectomy, 
15) #facelift, 16) #tummytuck, 17) #abdominoplasty, 
18) #brazilianbuttlift, 19) #buttockaugmentation, 20) #bod-
ycontouring, and 21) #liposuction.
The total number of posts using each hashtag was 
recorded. Content analysis was then utilized to qualita-
tively evaluate each of the nine “top” posts associated with 
each hashtag (189 posts). More specifically, we tracked 
whether the post was educational or self-promotional.14 
In addition, we noted whether the post was a photo or 
short video.
For each post, we further recorded data on who did the 
actual posting on a per-user basis by analyzing each post-
er’s Instagram profile. Data extrapolated included what 
country the poster came from and whether or not they 
were a plastic surgeon. If so, we noted whether they were 
board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery 
(ABPS) or The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of 
Canada (RCPSC), both of which are included in the mem-
bership criteria for ASAPS.15 If not, we noted their medical 
specialty, if any, or general occupation. We further tracked 
if the poster was a patient, medical interest group, or for-
eign surgeon. Instagram users not falling into any of these 
categories (ie, celebrity fan pages or satirical pages) were 
classified as “other.”
Posts were included in our analysis if they were relevant 
to plastic surgery (ie, photos or short videos in the operat-
ing room, before/after photos, anatomical diagrams, post 
by a plastic surgery patient describing their experience, 
advertisement for breast implants, etc.) or were posted by 
a plastic surgeon. Duplicate posts and posts not relevant to 
plastic surgery were excluded from our study.
All analyses were performed using SAS JMP Pro 12 (SAS 
Institute. Cary, NC). Categorical variables were described 
by frequencies or proportions and were compared using 
the chi-square test. Continuous variables were com-
pared using a t test. Post characteristics were compared 
between board-certified plastic surgeons and other users 
of Instagram. For all tests, the P values were two-sided and 
significance was defined as at a P value <0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 1,789,270 posts utilized the 21 hashtags sampled 
in this study. Of these hashtags, #plasticsurgery had the 
highest amount of posts associated with it (523,361 posts). 
This was more than the next two most popular hasthags 
combined (#facelift with 224,235 posts, and #rhinoplasty 
with 138,259 posts). In comparison, 117,320 posts used 
the hashtag #cosmeticsurgery, whereas #aestheticsurgery 
had only 15,939 posts associated with it. Likewise, more 
posts used the hashtag #plasticsurgeon (128,197 posts) 
than #cosmeticsurgeon (15,100) and #aestheticsurgeon 
(3638).
For most procedures evaluated in this study, hashtags 
using lay person terminology for the procedure had more 
posts associated with it than hashtags using the proper med-
ical terminology (Table 1). For example, #boobjob (91,968 
posts) was more popular than #breastimplant (5003 posts) 
and #breastaugmentation (1138 posts). In addition, 24,243 
posts used #breastlift, whereas only 5929 posts used #mas-
topexy. The hashtag #facelift had 224,235 posts associated 
with it, as opposed to #rhytidectomy with 339 posts. This 
was true for abdominal (#tummytuck with 124,010 posts 
vs #abdominoplasty with 32,027 posts) and gluteal pro-
cedures (#brazilianbuttlift with 42,026 posts vs #buttock-
augmentation with 2048 posts) as well. There were some 
exceptions to this, however. The hashtag #rhinoplasty had 
138,259 posts associated with it, whereas #nosejob had

103,348 posts. Likewise, 119,974 posts used #liposuction, 
in contrast to 71,168 posts using #bodycontouring.
Of the top 189 posts for these 21 queried hashtags, 
163 posts met inclusion criteria (128 photos and 35 
short videos). A majority of top posts came from foreign 
surgeons (68 posts or 41.7%). Countries represented 
included Turkey (17 posts), Russia (11 posts), Brazil (7 
posts), Colombia (4 posts), Dominican Republic (3 posts), 
Ecuador (3 posts), Greece (2 posts), Iran (2 posts), Italy (2 
posts), Philippines (2 posts), Thailand (2 posts), Ukraine 
(2 posts), United Arab Emirates (2 posts), United Kingdom 
(2 posts), Venezuela (2 posts), Azerbijan (1 post), Japan 
(1 post), Lebanon (1 post), Puerto Rico (1 post), and 
Spain (1 post).
ABPS and RCPSC board-certified plastic surgeons 
accounted for only 17.8% of top posts (29 posts), whereas 
those not board certified by ABPS or RCPSC accounted for 
26.4% (43 posts) (Figure 1). Excluding foreign surgeons, 
otolaryngologists made up the largest group of those not 
eligible for ASAPS membership among the top posts (12 
posts). Also included in this cohort were dermatologists (9 
posts), general surgeons (6 posts), gynecologists (4 posts), 
family medicine physicians (2 posts), and an emergency 
medicine physician (1 post). All obstetrician-gynecolo-
gists, dermatologists, general surgeons, family practice, 
and emergency medicine physicians marketed themselves 
as “cosmetic surgeons.” Nine of these top posts were not 
even by licensed physicians. This included dentists (4 
posts), spas with no associated physician (4 posts), and a 
hair salon (one post).
The vast majority of these posts were for self-pro-
motional (94 posts, 67.1%) as opposed to educational 
(46 posts, 32.9%) purposes, though there was no sig-
nificant difference in number of likes (4757 ± 20,305 
vs 2780 ± 9108, P = 0.54) or comments (20 ± 34 vs 
22 ± 41, P = 0.82) between self-promotional and edu-
cational posts. Board-certified plastic surgeons were 
significantly more likely to post educational content to 
Instagram as compared to nonplastic surgeons (62.1% vs 
38.1%, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in 
number of likes (P = 0.55) or comments (P = 0.44) for 
content posted by plastic surgeons vs nonplastic surgeons 
(Table 2). Twenty-one posts were by patients and 2 posts 
were by medical interest groups.
DISCUSSION
The 21st century patient has been described as a “con-
sumer” of healthcare, underscoring the importance 
of understanding the decision-making process these 
patients use when “shopping” around for plastic sur-
geons.16 Evidence suggests that plastic surgery patients 
are increasingly querying the Internet and social media

for health-related information before their consultation.17 
As patients increasingly rely on such means to choose 
their provider, it is critical to understand the ecosystem of 
online platforms available to patients.
In “#PlasticSurgery,” Branford and colleagues exam-
ined posting about plastic surgery on Twitter as a means of 
informing how board-certified plastic surgeons could use 
the hashtag #PlasticSurgery as a tool to educate patients 
and the public. The authors prospectively analyzed 
2880 “tweets” containing the words “plastic surgery” and 
discovered that such posting was dominated by the public, 
accounting for 70.6% of posts as opposed to 6.0% by plas-
tic surgeons.14 They further found that 37.0% of posts by 
plastic surgeons were self-promotional.
Though Twitter is undoubtedly an important social 
media platform, Instagram reports more monthly active 
users than Twitter, and likewise beats Twitter as the most 
popular social media platform for advertisers.18,19 Like 
Twitter, there too is a “lively conversation” going on about 
plastic surgery on Instagram.14 The 21 plastic surgery-re-
lated hashtags sampled in this study alone account for 
nearly two million posts.
Yet unlike plastic surgery-related posting on Twitter, our 
study found that posting of top plastic surgery-related con-
tent on Instagram was dominated by licensed physicians 
(80.4%). However, only 17.8% of posts were made by 
ABPS and RCPSC board-certified plastic surgeons. This is in 
contrast to the 26.4% of top posts that were made by phy-
sicians (excluding foreign surgeons) not eligible for ASAPS 
membership. Indeed, the paucity of board-certified plastic 
surgeons amongst the top plastic surgery-related posts on 
Instagram is alarming. Our analysis found that together 
there were more otolaryngologists, dermatologists, general 
surgeons, gynecologists, family medicine physicians, and 
emergency medicine physicians marketing plastic surgical 
procedures than ASAPS eligible board-certified plastic sur-
geons. We even identified dentists, spas with no associated 
physician, and a hair salon that were offering plastic sur-
gery procedures in their facilities (5.5%). This may offer 
insight into why hashtags using more slang or lay person 
terminology for plastic surgery procedures tended to have 
more posts associated with them than hashtags using the 
proper medical terminology.
Furthermore, we found that more than twice as many of 
these top posts were done for self-promotional over edu-
cational purposes. In a 2010 interview with Jim Leonardo 
of Plastic Surgery News, past ASPS Ethics Committee chair-
man and coauthor of this study, Dr. Neil A. Fine, suggested 
that nonplastic surgeons feel the only way to draw atten-
tion to themselves is to be “more and more visible through 
advertising.”20 Though Fine was referring to website-based 
advertising at the time, our findings suggest that nonplas-
tic surgeons are now also utilizing new social media chan-
nels to widen their target audience and extend their reach 
far beyond traditional website-based advertising.
This ever-increasing number of physicians not board 
certified in plastic and reconstructive surgery performing 
cosmetic procedures often comes at the expense of patient 
safety and outcomes, with accounts detailing significant 
morbidity and even mortality at the hands of practitioners 
without proper training.21-24 Indeed, Mioton and col-
leagues discovered a nearly 300% increase in the number 
of complications for panniculectomies performed by non-
plastic surgeons as compared with board-certified plastic 
surgeons.24
Though having a trained and qualified surgeon perform 
such procedures is paramount for patient safety, patients 
may be confused as to what constitutes such a surgeon. In 
a recent study, Shah et al found survey respondents were 
uncomfortable with obstetrician-gynecologists, dermatolo-
gists, general surgeons, and family practice physicians per-
forming aesthetic surgery.25 Despite their finding that 90% 
of survey respondents believed board certification was 
important and necessary, approximately half of respon-
dents believed a surgeon must be appropriately creden-
tialed and trained in order to legally advertise themselves 
as cosmetic surgeons. Yet in our study cohort, all obstetri-
cian-gynecologists, dermatologists, general surgeons, fam-
ily practice, and emergency medicine physicians marketed 
themselves as “cosmetic surgeons.” This echoes Shah and 
colleagues’ concern that problematic medical marketing, 
recognized and unrecognized boards, and varying catego-
rizations of surgeons have made it challenging for patients 
to decide which physicians can safely perform aesthetic 
surgeries.25
Since patients are increasingly querying social media 
when choosing a provider, and the top nine posts are the 
first content a prospective patient would see when search-
ing a particular hashtag on Instagram, the findings of our 
study as presented here are particularly worrisome.
How Can Plastic Surgeons Unite to 
Educate the Public?
There are concerns of social media trivializing aesthetic 
surgery and dropping the high standards plastic surgeons 
should hold themselves too.26 Reissis et al indicate that a 
review of advertising guidelines created by organizations

such as the ASPS and ASAPS is needed, as these guidelines 
were largely created before the widespread use of social 
media by plastic surgeons.26 Yet sharing content on social 
media need not be unethical and can play an important 
role in education as well as marketing when done tact-
fully.27 Indeed, social media represents a platform that can 
be used by plastic surgeons to advance collective goals of 
patient education and informing the public that board cer-
tification as well as adequate training matters.28 In a recent 
Letter to the Editor in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Dr. 
Sheila Nazarian asks, “If we, the so-called experts, don’t 
get ourselves out there like the non-core physicians are, 
how will we stay relevant?”28 The results of our study indi-
cate that Dr. Nazarian’s question is more pertinent now 
than ever before. If plastic surgeons do not start using 
social media to engage with potential patients, noncore 
physicians certainly will—and already are. Interestingly, 
our study found no significant difference in number of 
likes (P = 0.55) or comments (P = 0.44) for Instagram 
posts done by board-certified plastic surgeons vs nonplas-
tic surgeons. This underscores how crucial it is for more 
plastic surgeons board certified by the American Board of 
Medical Specialties to join the social media conversation.14
But how can plastic surgeons join forces to educate the 
public and stay relevant, yet do so in an ethical and pro-
fessional manner? Addressing this will require multiple 
approaches. Uniting under the hashtag #plasticsurgery is 
one potential strategy. Engagement on Instagram is nat-
urally highest with posts using more than one hashtag, 
thus we recommended that surgeons use any combina-
tion of the 21 plastic surgery-related hashtags evaluated 
in this study, as applicable. A media campaign by the 
ASAPS to inform the public of the dangers of deceptive 
advertising and higher postoperative complications24 by 
nonplastic surgery trained surgeons is another potential 
strategy. Furthermore, we recommend that plastic sur-
geons obtain written consent from the patient before 
any content be distributed online, and ideally surgeons 
should seek counsel from a legal professional when pre-
paring the consent form.27 Surgeons should always seek 
to uphold ethical and professional standards as deter-
mined by the ASAPS Code of Ethics.29 In doing so, plastic 
surgeons will be able to post content to social media with 
the confidence of knowing that they are protecting their 
patients, themselves, and ultimately, the perception of 
plastic surgery at large.
Limitations
Our pilot study only examined the nine top posts associ-
ated with each queried hashtag. This study reveals that 
the majority of top United States and Canadian plas-
tic surgery Instagram posts were by nonboard-certified 
plastic surgeons. One inherent weakness of this study is 
that foreign surgeons accounted for the greatest propor-
tion of posts, making it difficult to ascertain if they were 
advertising outside their scope of training. It is possible 
to have the same top post for multiple hashtags if related 
hashtags are used together, although we attempted to min-
imize this by excluding duplicate posts linked to the same 
account. Though using social media for research purposes 
has biases and limitations, the same is true for outcomes 
studies and quality-of-life measures.30 Our study queried 
the included Instagram hashtags for a single date. Top 
posts for any given hashtag can potentially change on a 
daily basis, thought it is unlikely to be significantly dif-
ferent on any given day vs another. Future studies may 
wish to evaluate seasonal variations in plastic surgery-re-
lated Instagram usage. Older individuals who are not as 
technology savvy are less likely to post on Instagram, 
and those using the platform may represent a “vociferous 
and well-connected minority.”31 Yet such limitations are 
increasingly being reduced as social media continues to 
grow in use and popularity.
On the other hand, social media permits analysis over 
a wide geographic area. In their recent study using Twitter 
to evaluate lung cancer surgery outcomes, Cooke and col-
leagues suggest that the Internet and social media enable 
a more diverse population to be sampled than possible 
with focus groups or individual interviews.32 Indeed, our 
study identified content posted from 21 different coun-
tries. Forthcoming studies should examine additional 
posts to validate our findings as well as better understand 
the full extent plastic surgery-related content posted to 
Instagram. Such future studies may wish to broaden the 
hashtags queried to include those applicable to facial plas-
tic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons as well, in order to 
better compare core plastic surgery specialties with non-
core ones.
CONCLUSIONS
Board-certified plastic surgeons are underrepresented 
amongst physicians posting top plastic surgery-related 
content to Instagram. Furthermore, individuals that are not 
licensed physicians may likewise be promoting plastic sur-
gery procedures to prospective patients. The vast majority 
of these top posts are for self-promotional over educational 
purposes. Given the volume of cosmetic surgery advertis-
ing by nonplastic surgeons and the ensuing risk this poses 
to patient safety and outcomes, our findings present a sig-
nificant cause for concern. It is critical that board-certified 
plastic surgeons use social media like Instagram as a plat-
form to educate patients about the risks of surgery and 
dangers of having plastic surgery performed by those with 
improper training.
