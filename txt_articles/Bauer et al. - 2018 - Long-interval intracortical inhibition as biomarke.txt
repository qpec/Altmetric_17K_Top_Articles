Cortical excitability, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electromyography, is a potential biomarker
for the diagnosis and follow-up of epilepsy. We report on long-interval intracortical inhibition data measured in four different
centres in healthy controls (n = 95), subjects with refractory genetic generalized epilepsy (n = 40) and with refractory focal epilepsy
(n = 69). Long-interval intracortical inhibition was measured by applying two supra-threshold stimuli with an interstimulus interval
of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms and calculating the ratio between the response to the second (test stimulus) and to the first
(conditioning stimulus). In all subjects, the median response ratio showed inhibition at all interstimulus intervals. Using a mixed
linear-effects model, we compared the long-interval intracortical inhibition response ratios between the different subject types. We
conducted two analyses; one including data from the four centres and one excluding data from Centre 2, as the methods in this
centre differed from the others. In the first analysis, we found no differences in long-interval intracortical inhibition between the
different subject types. In all subjects, the response ratios at interstimulus intervals 100 and 150 ms showed significantly more
inhibition than the response ratios at 50, 200 and 250 ms. Our second analysis showed a significant interaction between inter-
stimulus interval and subject type (P = 0.0003). Post hoc testing showed significant differences between controls and refractory
focal epilepsy at interstimulus intervals of 100 ms (P = 0.02) and 200 ms (P = 0.04). There were no significant differences between
controls and refractory generalized epilepsy groups or between the refractory generalized and focal epilepsy groups. Our results do
not support the body of previous work that suggests that long-interval intracortical inhibition is significantly reduced in refractory
focal and genetic generalized epilepsy. Results from the second analysis are even in sharper contrast with previous work, showing
inhibition in refractory focal epilepsy at 200 ms instead of facilitation previously reported. Methodological differences, especially
shorter intervals between the pulse pairs, may have contributed to our inability to reproduce previous findings. Based on our
results, we suggest that long-interval intracortical inhibition as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyog-
raphy is unlikely to have clinical use as a biomarker of epilepsy.

Introduction
Epilepsy is a paroxysmal neurological condition characterized
by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures
(Fisher et al., 2014). The diagnosis is based on the clinical
history, often supported by interictal or ictal epileptic dis-
charges on the EEG (Rosenow et al., 2015). These patho-
logical changes in the EEG are paroxysmal and do not
always occur during a short EEG recording (Smith, 2005).
The diagnostic sensitivity of routine EEG for epilepsy is esti-
mated at 17% in adults and at 58% in children (Bouma
et al., 2016). Sensitivity can be moderately increased by
increasing recording time, or by using activation procedures
such as sleep deprivation, hyperventilation or photic stimula-
tion (Smith, 2005; Rosenow et al., 2015). In about 70% of
those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be suppressed
with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) (Brodie et al., 2012), but
finding the optimal AED type and dose for an individual
patient can be a difficult and time-consuming process. The
EEG does not provide a direct measure of seizure proneness
and its use in the follow-up of epilepsy is therefore limited,
spurring the search for a reliable biomarker of epilepsy ac-
tivity to improve its management (Smith, 2005; Engel, 2008).
Increased cortical excitability resulting from an imbalance
between excitatory and inhibitory activity is thought to
play an important role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy
(Schwartzkroin, 1994). Cortical excitability can be mea-
sured non-invasively using single or paired pulse transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Reutens and Berkovic,
1992). Single pulse protocols are used to assess the motor
threshold, motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and
cortical silent period. With paired pulse protocols, short-
interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation
and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) can be mea-
sured (Kobayashi and Pascual-Leone, 2003). Several studies
showed increased cortical excitability in groups of drug-
naı
¨ve subjects with generalized or focal epilepsy compared
to healthy controls (for review see de Goede et al., 2016).
Four
studies
reported
a decrease
in
excitability
after
successful treatment with AEDs but not after ineffective
treatment (Badawy et al., 2010a, 2013, 2013c, d).
Of the different variables measured with TMS, those mea-
sured with paired pulse protocols appear to hold the greatest
potential as biomarkers for epilepsy for several reasons: first,
they provide information about cortical excitability rather
than integrated corticospinal excitability as is the case for
single pulse measures (Ziemann et al., 1996). Second, they
can be expressed as dimensionless ratios, enabling compari-
son across different institutions. Third, paired pulse protocols
appear to yield more reliable findings than single pulse proto-
cols (de Goede et al., 2016). Several studies consistently found
facilitation at the short (2 and 5ms) and long (250 and
300ms) interstimulus intervals (ISIs), instead of inhibition as
in healthy controls, providing evidence for cortical hyperexcit-
ability in drug-naı
¨ve epilepsy (for review see de Goede et al.,
2016). Lastly, this difference between facilitation in drug-
naı
¨ve epilepsy and inhibition in controls was larger at long
than at short ISIs (Badawy et al., 2007). Of the different TMS
variables, LICI may thus be the most suitable as an epilepsy
biomarker. LICI is measured by applying two supra-threshold
stimuli with an ISI of 50–400ms and calculating the ratio
between the response to the second (test stimulus) and to
the first (conditioning stimulus) (a variant consists of the
ratio between the response to the test stimulus and to an
unconditioned stimulus). A ratio with values51 indicates in-
hibition, while values41 indicate facilitation (Valls-Sole
´
et al., 1992). LICI is thought to be linked to GABA-B recep-
tor mediated inhibition (Werhahn et al., 1999; McDonnell
et al., 2006).
In epilepsy, LICI was mainly studied by one group of
investigators who, in several studies, showed facilitation
instead of inhibition at ISIs of 50, 150, 250 and 300 ms
in groups of drug-naı
¨ve subjects with different types of
genetic
generalized
epilepsy
(Brodtmann
et
al.,
1999;
Badawy et al., 2007, 2010b, 2012, 2013, 2013b, c,
2014; Badawy and Jackson, 2012). In drug-naı
¨ve focal
epilepsy, cortical excitability was consistently increased in
the hemisphere ipsilateral to the epileptic focus, but not
in the contralateral hemisphere, at ISIs 250 and 300 ms

 (Badawy et al., 2007, 2010b, 2012, 2013, 2013a, b, d,
2014, 2015; Badawy and Jackson, 2012). In successfully
treated epilepsy, hyperexcitability normalized over time in
seizure-free groups, becoming more similar to controls, but
it remained increased in refractory groups (Badawy et al.,
2010a, 2013, 2013c, d). Two recent studies from other
groups reported contrasting findings, however, the first
found significantly lower cortical excitability in subjects
with genetic generalized epilepsy on AEDs compared to a
healthy control group and a drug-naı
¨ve generalized epilepsy
group at ISIs between 200 and 250 ms. No significant dif-
ferences were found between the drug-naı
¨ve epilepsy and
control groups (Silbert et al., 2015). The second study
found inhibition at an ISI of 50 ms in poorly controlled
epilepsy, but not in moderately controlled epilepsy or
healthy controls. At an ISI of 200 ms, the groups with
poorly and moderately controlled epilepsy both showed in-
hibition (more prominent in the poorly controlled group),
whereas healthy controls did not. These results, however,
were not significant after correction for multiple compari-
sons (Pawley et al., 2017).
To establish the true potential of LICI as a clinical bio-
marker of epilepsy, the promising findings need to be repli-
cated and extended to larger groups. An ideal biomarker
needs to provide consistent results across different centres.
For it to be useful on an individual level, the interindividual
variability should be low. A difference in excitability be-
tween refractory epilepsy and healthy controls would sup-
port the use of LICI to rapidly evaluate the effect of
treatment with AEDs. We report on LICI data from healthy
controls and subjects with refractory genetic generalized
and focal epilepsy from four different centres in two differ-
ent countries. Our results do not support the utility of LICI
as a biomarker for epilepsy.
Materials and methods
Data were collected independently in four different tertiary
referral centres, two each in the Netherlands and the UK,
and retrospectively pooled. The centres were: (i) Medisch
Spectrum
Twente
(Netherlands);
(ii)
Stichting
Epilepsie
Instellingen
Nederland – SEIN (Netherlands);
(iii) King’s
College London (UK); and (iv) University College London
(UK).
The studies were performed in accordance with guidelines
for TMS use in clinical practice and research (Rossi et al.,
2009). All study protocols were approved by the local ethics
committees of each of the participating centres.
Participants
Informed written consent was provided by all participants. For
those younger than 18 years, assent was also obtained from
both parents. People with contra-indications to TMS other
than epilepsy and pregnant females were excluded.
Centre 1
Healthy adults (aged 18 years or over) were recruited locally
through advertisement at the University of Twente and the
Medisch Spectrum Twente. People with a history of epilepsy,
brain lesions or spinal cord surgery were excluded. Hand dom-
inance was assessed with the Dutch Handedness Questionnaire
(van Strien, 1992, 2003).
Centre 2
Healthy participants (aged 12 years or over) were recruited
locally through digital and paper adverts. People with a neuro-
logical or psychiatric condition, including migraine or epilepsy,
diabetes mellitus and people taking medication that could
affect cortical excitability (such as psychoactive drugs and
b-blockers) were excluded. Hand dominance was assessed
with the Dutch version of the Edinburgh handedness question-
naire (Oldfield, 1971).
Centre 3
Adults with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited via
specialized neurology and epilepsy clinics at King’s College
Hospital,
St
Thomas’
Hospital,
St
George’s
Hospital,
London, Kent and Canterbury Hospital and Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, Woolwich. For the control group, healthy adults
without a personal or family history of neurological or psychi-
atric conditions were recruited through a local research volun-
teer’s database and friends of participants. Those with epilepsy
who had a neuropsychiatric condition other than epilepsy,
non-epileptogenic seizures, an estimated IQ 570 or who did
not cooperate with the TMS procedures were excluded. In part
of
the
cohort,
hand
dominance
was
assessed
with
the
Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971).
Centre 4
Adults with epilepsy were recruited through specialized epi-
lepsy clinics and an inpatient unit at the National Hospital
for
Neurology
and
Neurosurgery
(Queen
Square
and
Chalfont sites). Participants with a clinical diagnosis of refrac-
tory genetic generalized or focal epilepsy were included. Hand
dominance was assessed with the Edinburgh handedness ques-
tionnaire (Oldfield, 1971).
Data acquisition
In all centres, participants were seated in a comfortable chair
with their hands in a relaxed position and their eyes open. The
experimental set-up and stimulation protocol of each centre is
summarized in Table 1.
Centre 1
TMS was performed with a Magstim Rapid2 Stimulator (max-
imum stimulator output 1.5 T), and a figure-of-eight air-cooled
70 mm coil (The Magstim Company Limited). Biphasic TMS
pulses were given to both motor hotspots of the abductor
digiti minimi (ADM) muscle. Muscle activity was recorded
using two surface Ag/AgCl electrodes placed in a belly-
tendon montage. MEPs were recorded from the contralateral
ADM muscle with a 72-channel Refa system (TMSi). Data
were recorded with a sampling frequency of 5 kHz and
stored for offline analysis. Measurements were conducted be-
tween 9 AM and 5 PM.

 Centre 2
TMS was performed with a MagPro X100 magnetic stimula-
tor (maximum stimulator output 3.9 T), and a 12-cm diameter
parabolic circular MMC-140 coil (Magventure). Biphasic TMS
pulses were given on the vertex (Cz). MEPs were recorded
bilaterally from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles
with a Nicolet Viking EDX EMG system (Natus). Data were
recorded with a sampling frequency of 4 kHz and stored for
offline analysis. Measurements were conducted between 9 AM
and 4 PM.
Centre 3
TMS was performed using two Magstim 2002 stimulators con-
nected via a BiStim module, and a figure-of-eight 90 mm coil
(The Magstim Company Limited). Monophasic TMS pulses
were given to both motor hotspots of the first dorsal interosse-
ous (FDI) muscle. MEPs were recorded from the contralateral
FDI muscle with a CED1902 EMG amplifier and CED 1401
Signal 3.13 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) using a
sampling rate of 15 kHz, a bandwidth of 10–5000 Hz, a gain
of 1000 (ranging from �5 to 5 V), and traces recorded on
Signal 3.13 software (CED 1401) and stored for offline ana-
lysis. Measurements were conducted between 9 AM and 5 PM.
Centre 4
Hardware and software for TMS-EMG data collection were
the same as in Centre 3. A figure-of-eight 70 mm D70 alpha
coil was used (The Magstim Company Limited). Monophasic
TMS pulses were given to the dominant motor hotspot of the
APB muscle. MEPs were recorded with a sampling frequency
of 2 kHz and stored for offline analysis. Recordings were ob-
tained between 9 AM and 5 PM.
Estimation of the resting motor
threshold
For the three centres using a figure-of-eight coil, the resting
motor threshold was determined by applying single pulses to
the ADM (Centre 1), FDI (Centre 3) or APB (Centre 4) motor
hotspots. The hotspot was defined as the location were the
largest MEPs were induced when the TMS coil was placed
tangentially with the handle pointed backwards and laterally
at an angle of 45� from the midline. Stimulation commenced at
30% of maximum stimulator output and increased in 5% in-
crements until a MEP was seen. One per cent changes in in-
tensity were then used to find the threshold, defined as the
minimum stimulus intensity, which produced a MEP with a
peak-to-peak amplitude 450 mV (4100 mV in Centre 4) in
50% or more of 10 trials in the fully relaxed target muscle
(Rossini et al., 1994). Relaxation of the target muscle was
monitored by continuous visual observation of the EMG.
The approach was different in Centre 2, where the resting
motor threshold was approximated using a single pulse stimu-
lus-response curve, with the coil on the vertex. Stimulation
started at 20% of stimulator output with 5% stepwise incre-
ments until there was a consistent twitch in the hand contra-
lateral to the stimulated hemisphere in 50% or more of eight
trials (approximated resting motor threshold). Then, a semi-
automated, in-house designed scanning protocol (created in
Matlab�)
(version
7.5.0
R2007b
The
MathWorks
Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA) was used to automatically deliver stimuli
with a fixed intertrial interval of 2 s, and eight stimuli at each
intensity. Scanning started at a stimulator output value of
10–12% below the approximated resting motor threshold
and
increased
in
2%
steps
until
a
reproducible
MEP
(4200 mV) was seen after every stimulus (corresponding to
110–120% resting motor threshold). The resting motor thresh-
old was defined as the lowest stimulus intensity eliciting a
visible twitch in any hand muscle in 50% or more of eight
stimuli (Varnava et al., 2011).
Assessment of long-interval intracor-
tical inhibition
Centre 1
Paired pulse stimulation was applied with the coil over the
ADM motor hotspot. Both pulses were given at 120% of
the resting motor threshold with ISIs between 50 to 300 ms,
with 50 ms increments (six intervals). Stimulation was repeated
50 times for each ISI. The stimulus pairs were given randomly
with �4 s (range 3.5–4.5 s) between stimulus pairs (intertrial
interval). To calculate the LICI for each ISI, the ratio was

 taken between the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the re-
sponses to the second (test) stimuli (test response, TR), and
the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the responses to the first
(conditioning) stimuli (conditioning response, CR): mean(TR)/
mean(CR).
Centre 2
Paired pulse stimulation was applied with the coil over the
vertex. Both pulses were given at 110% of the resting motor
threshold, with increasing ISIs between 50 and 400 ms, with
25 ms increments (15 intervals). Stimulation was repeated six
times for each ISI. The stimulus pairs were given in a fixed
increasing order with an intertrial interval of 1 s. An uncondi-
tioned stimulus was given six times immediately before the
start of the paired pulse stimulation protocol. To calculate
the LICI for each ISI, the mean peak-to-peak amplitude in
response to the conditioned, second stimuli (TR) was divided
by the mean peak-to-peak amplitude in response to the uncon-
ditioned stimuli: mean (TR)/mean (unconditioned MEP).
Centre 3
Paired pulse stimulation was applied with the coil over the FDI
motor hotspot. Both paired pulses were given at 120% of the
resting motor threshold. Four ISIs were tested: 50, 150, 200
and 250 ms. Stimulation was repeated 10 times for each ISI.
The stimulus pairs were given in random order with an inter-
trial interval of 4 s. To calculate the LICI for each ISI, the
ratios were taken between the peak-to-peak amplitudes of
the responses to the second test stimuli (TR), and the peak-
to-peak amplitudes of the responses to the first conditioning
stimuli (CR). Then the mean over all ratios was taken:
mean(TR/CR).
Centre 4
Paired pulse stimulation was applied with the coil over the
APB motor hotspot. Both pulses were given at 110% of the
resting motor threshold. Five ISIs were tested: 50, 100, 150,
200 and 250 ms. Stimulation was repeated 10 times for each
ISI. The stimulus pairs were given in a random order with a 5 s
intertrial interval. LICI was calculated in the same way as in
Centre 2.
Data analysis
Each centre provided the following individual data for ana-
lysis: age, gender, hand dominance (if available), epilepsy diag-
nosis, including whether epilepsy was refractory to treatment
with AEDs (defined as at least one seizure in the year preced-
ing the TMS measurement), number of different AEDs, side of
seizure focus (in case of focal epilepsy), and the mean LICI for
each ISI. Only LICI values of healthy controls and people with
refractory epilepsy (generalized or focal) were included in the
analysis. Based on previous reports, cortical excitability as
measured by LICI remains elevated in those who are refractory
to pharmacological treatment, whereas it normalizes (returns
to the levels seen in controls) in those who become seizure-free.
The refractory epilepsy group is, therefore, the most interesting
to assess in this context. For controls and genetic generalized
epilepsy, we only analysed the LICI when stimulating the dom-
inant hemisphere (left hemisphere for right-hand dominance).
When hand dominance was unknown and in ambidextrous
participants, we analysed the LICI when stimulating the left
hemisphere. For focal epilepsy, we included the LICI when
stimulating the hemisphere ipsilateral to the epileptic focus in
the analysis, or the dominant/left hemisphere when epileptic
foci were bilateral. We included the LICI measured at ISIs of
50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ms.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was done in R� (R Core Team, 2015). As the
material and stimulation protocols differed between the cen-
tres, we expected not only large interindividual variability of
LICI values, but also a large variability between the centres.
This intercentre variability limits the comparison of data be-
tween the centres and means that data cannot simply be
pooled for analysis. Linear mixed-effects models (lme4 pack-
age, Linear Mixed Effects version 4) (Bates et al., 2015) are the
best way to deal with such datasets, as they allow for correc-
tion of systematic variability. We accounted for the heterogen-
eity of LICI values across subjects and centres by defining them
as effects with a random intercept, thus instructing the model
to correct for any systematic differences between the subjects
(interindividual variability) and centres (intercentre variability).
We then analysed the influence of two possible fixed effects
on LICI: (i) the subject type (three levels: controls, refractory
genetic generalized epilepsy and refractory focal epilepsy); and
(ii) the ISIs (five levels: 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms). LICI
response ratios were log transformed to better approximate
normality (Supplementary Fig. 1). To optimize our model,
we checked the normality of the model residual.
We ran a type II analysis of variance. Wald chi-square tests
were used for fixed effects in linear mixed-effects models. For
post hoc tests we used the Lsmean package (Lsmean version
2.20-23) (Searle et al., 1980) where P-values were considered
as significant at P 5 0.05 and adjusted for the number of com-
parisons performed (Tukey method).
Results
Participants
Centre 1
Twenty-five healthy subjects were included. Four were
excluded from the analyses: in two, stimulation was not
possible at an intensity of 120% of the resting motor
threshold, in one the session was terminated prematurely
as the subject felt unwell, and in one, LICI data were not
available
from
the
dominant
hemisphere.
Twenty-one
healthy individuals were included in the analysis (six
males, mean age 28.6 years, range 20–49 years, three
left-handed) (Fig. 1).
Centre 2
Thirty-eight controls were included; one was excluded due
to non-specific EEG abnormalities. Data of 37 controls
were included in the analysis (11 males, mean age 38.1
years, range 15–62 years, four left-handed, one ambidex-
trous) (Fig. 1).

 Centre 3
Thirty-seven controls and 110 subjects with epilepsy were
included (54 with genetic generalized epilepsy, 55 with
focal epilepsy and one with an unclear diagnosis). All con-
trols were included in the analysis (19 males, mean age
30.2 years, range 18–52 years, four left-handed, one ambi-
dextrous). Of the 54 subjects with generalized epilepsy, 31
were excluded from the analysis: in 11, LICI data were not
collected (for reasons including too high motor threshold or
discomfort during stimulation), in four, LICI data were not
available from the dominant hemisphere, nine were not
taking AEDs at the time of the experiment, and seven
were not considered refractory. Thus, 23 subjects with re-
fractory genetic generalized epilepsy were included in the
analysis (10 males, mean age 30.1 years, range 18–54
years, hand dominance known in 12, of these two were
left-handed, AEDs: median 1, range 1–4). In 24 of the 55
with focal epilepsy, LICI data were not collected. In three,
LICI data were only available for the hemisphere contra-
lateral to the epileptic focus. Thus, 28 subjects with refrac-
tory focal epilepsy were included in the analysis (12 males,
mean age 39.4 years, range 21–66 years, AEDs: median 1,
range 1–3) (Fig. 1). The hand dominance of this group was
unknown.
Centre 4
Nineteen participants with genetic generalized epilepsy
were included. One had to be excluded from the analysis
as no AEDs were used and one because LICI data from
the dominant hemisphere were not available. Seventeen
subjects with genetic generalized epilepsy were included in
the analysis (eight males, mean age 34.4 years, range 20–51
years, one left-handed, two ambidextrous, AEDs: median 3,
range 1–5). Fifty-nine with focal epilepsy were included but
15 were excluded as LICI data from the hemisphere ipsi-
lateral to the epileptic focus were not available. In one
participant with a bilateral focus, LICI data from the dom-

not taking AEDs, leaving 41 with refractory focal epilepsy
for analysis (18 males, mean age 39.7 years, range 18–61
years, four left-handed, AEDs: median 2, range 1–6) (Fig.
1). A further five participants were included, but as the
epilepsy diagnosis was unclear they were excluded from
the current analysis.
In total, we included data from 204 subjects in the ana-
lysis, 40 with refractory generalized epilepsy, 69 with re-
fractory focal epilepsy and 95 healthy controls (Fig. 1). Part
of the data from this cohort were previously reported in
other studies [Centre 1: de Goede and van Putten (2017),
Centre 3: Chowdhury et al. (2015); Pawley et al. (2017)
and Centre 4 (including patients with Dravet Syndrome):
Stern et al. (2016, 2017)].

For all subject types, the response ratios for each ISI are
shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. As expected, we found inhib-
ition (median LICI value 51) in healthy controls at all
analysed ISIs (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms) (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, the median LICI was
also 51 in refractory genetic generalized epilepsy (all ISIs
except 50 ms) and refractory focal epilepsy (all ISIs). The
mean LICI also showed inhibition in the controls, except in
Centre 2 (all ISIs), in Centre 1 at ISI 50 ms and in Centre 3
at ISI 250 ms (Table 2). In the refractory epilepsy groups,
the mean LICI was also 51 at most ISIs, except for genetic
generalized epilepsy at ISI 50 ms and focal epilepsy in

model showed that there was no significant interaction
between subject type and LICI at any of the ISIs. We
found a main effect of interaction between ISI and LICI
(P 5 0.001). Post hoc tests revealed that LICI at ISIs 100

to LICI at ISIs 50, 200 and 250 ms for all three subject
types (Fig. 3). The methods of Centre 2 differ the most

 from those used in the other centres, as it was the only site
to use a round coil and stimulation on the vertex. It also
used the shortest intertrial interval and the lowest number
of repetitions per ISI. The statistical model takes this meth-
odological heterogeneity into account but as Centre 2 also
seems to have less consistent results and more outliers than
Centres 1 and 3 and other studies in the field (Valls-Sole
´
et al., 1992; Wassermann et al., 1996; Cash et al., 2010;
Caux-Dedeyste
`re et al., 2015; Silbert et al., 2015), we re-
ran the statistical analysis without Centre 2 data. In con-
trast with the first analysis, this showed a significant inter-
action
between
ISI
and
subject
groups
(P = 0.0003).
Post hoc testing revealed a small, yet significant difference
between controls and refractory focal epilepsy at ISIs of
100 ms (P = 0.02) and 200 ms (P = 0.04). There were no
significant differences between the control and refractory
generalized epilepsy groups or between the refractory gen-
eralized and focal epilepsy groups (Fig. 4). At an ISI
100 ms, the LICI of both controls and refractory focal epi-
lepsy was 51, indicating inhibition. At an ISI of 200 ms,
there was neither inhibition nor facilitation in the controls
(LICI �1)
but
inhibition
in
the
focal
epilepsy
group
(LICI 51).
Discussion
Our analysis of long-interval paired pulse TMS data col-
lected in four different centres do not support previous
promising findings (Badawy et al., 2010a, 2013, 2013c,
d). Our first analysis, including data from all centres,
showed no significant differences in LICI between those
with refractory genetic generalized epilepsy, subjects with
refractory focal epilepsy and healthy controls. We observed
a statistically significant difference between the ISIs of 50,
200 and 250 ms on one hand, and ISIs 100 and 150 ms on
the other hand for all subjects. Inhibition was measured at
all five ISIs in all subject types but it was significantly
stronger at ISIs 100 and 150 ms. The results from our
second analysis without Centre 2 data, clearly contrast
with previous findings
(Badawy et al., 2010a, 2013,
2013c, d). First, we find inhibition in the refractory epilepsy
groups instead of facilitation (LICI 41) reported previ-
ously. Second, the differences in our sample are only
found between refractory focal epilepsy and controls and
not in generalized refractory epilepsy. Third, the differences
are found at other ISIs (100 and 200 ms instead of 50, 150
and 250 ms) than previously reported (Badawy et al.,
2010a, 2013, 2013c, d). Lastly, the differences between
controls and refractory focal epilepsy are much smaller in
our sample than in previous reports (Badawy et al., 2010a,
2013, 2013c, d).
One of the main methodological differences between our
study protocols and that of previous studies is the intertrial
interval, which ranged between 1 and 5 s in our studies but
was 15 s in previous studies (Brodtmann et al., 1999;
Badawy et al., 2007, 2010a, b, 2012, 2013, 2013a, b, c,
d, 2014, 2015; Badawy and Jackson, 2012). Another study
of LICI in epilepsy, also using an intertrial interval of 5 s
did not show a difference between the healthy control and
drug-naı
¨ve epilepsy groups (Silbert et al., 2015). Several
studies have shown that the MEP amplitude is influenced
by the intertrial interval but there are no studies assessing
the influence of the intertrial interval on LICI. The optimal
intertrial interval to obtain reproducible single pulse MEPs
is probably between 10 and 20 s (Mo
¨ller et al., 2009;
Julkunen et al., 2012; Vaseghi et al., 2015; Pellicciari
et al., 2016), although other studies show that stimulus-
Figure 3 LICI at all ISIs per subject type pooled across centres. The boxplots show the median � 25th percentiles; the whiskers show
1.5 times the IQR. LICI at ISIs 100 and 150 ms (diagonal pattern) shows significantly more inhibition than LICI at ISIs 50, 200 and 250 ms for all
subject types.

 response curves can be obtained reliably using shorter inter-
trial intervals (Pearce et al., 2013; Mathias et al., 2014).
Other LICI studies, mostly in relatively small cohorts, used
random intertrial intervals between 4 and 15 s, but showed
variability similar to our cohort (Valls-Sole
´ et al., 1992;
Kujirai et al., 1993; Wassermann et al., 1996; Sanger
et al., 2001; Vallence et al., 2017). Interestingly, Centre
2, with the shortest intertrial interval (1 s) shows mean
LICI 41 at all ISIs, but median LICI 51 at all ISIs,
which may be due to several extreme outliers and specula-
tively a cumulative effect of the paired pulses. The relatively
short intertrial intervals in all centres may thus have con-
tributed to our inability to reproduce previous findings ob-
tained with an interstimulus interval of 15 s (Badawy et al.,
2010a, 2013, 2013c, d). A recent study, however, that also
used an intertrial interval of 15 s showed facilitation at ISIs
of 50, 80, 110 and 140 ms in a group of 20 healthy vol-
unteers (Bolden et al., 2017). Future studies are warranted
to quantify the influence of intertrial interval on paired
pulse TMS protocols.
Another explanation for the different results could be the
participant cohorts. We only included data obtained from
the dominant hemisphere in controls and generalized epi-
lepsy and the ipsilateral hemisphere in focal epilepsy (i.e.
the side of the seizure focus). In Centre 4 it was standard
practise to stimulate the dominant hemisphere only, leading
to the exclusion of those in whom the dominant hemi-
sphere was not the ipsilateral hemisphere. Including the
results of both hemispheres in our multi-centre analysis
would have led to missing data for cases in which only
one hemisphere was measured. Alternatively, we could
have estimated a mean of both hemispheres measured,
which could have introduced a bias. Our choice lead to
several exclusions, especially from Centre 4, but we feel
that this was the best way to deal with this issue. Even if
some bias were introduced this way, we would expect the
large differences between controls and subjects reported in
other studies to have been visible in our large sample. We
included a large number of people with all types of refrac-
tory generalized and focal epilepsy as well as healthy con-
trols, while previous studies often report on relatively small
samples (�20 participants) of people with specific epileptic
syndromes (Badawy et al., 2010b, 2012, 2013a, b, c, 2014)
or AEDs (Silbert et al., 2015). Our retrospective study
design did not allow us to go into such detail, limiting
the comparison with these studies. It should be noted that
the participant cohorts reported in previous studies appear
to overlap, potentially leading to multiple publication bias
and overestimation of the consistency of these findings
(Brigo et al., 2012; Badawy et al., 2017; Bauer et al.,
2017).
Comparing TMS data across centres is challenging as
variables such as the resting motor threshold depend dir-
ectly on the equipment used. LICI, however, is expressed as
a response ratio, and thus is dimensionless. It is, therefore,
theoretically better suited for comparison between centres
than the resting motor threshold. We report on data col-
lected from multiple centres and although it provides a
large body of data, it is limited by its retrospective set-up
and the different equipment and stimulation protocols used.
Clear methodological guidelines for LICI stimulation are
currently lacking, as there is insufficient data to define the
most robust LICI protocol in terms of stimulator, stimula-
tion intensity, coil type, stimulation site, target muscle,

 number of repetitions and intertrial interval. Some of the
methodological differences are less likely to hamper the
direct comparison between centres. For example, in three
of the centres a figure-of-eight coil was used and stimula-
tion was applied to the motor hotspot, while in one of the
centres (Centre 2) a round coil was used and stimulation
was applied on the vertex. The coil design (circular or
figure-of-eight) affects the size and depth of the cortical
region that is stimulated by the TMS pulse, and may
result in different LICI responses. While several studies
compared different coils for shorter interstimulus intervals
(Shimizu et al., 1999; Cantello et al., 2000; Badawy et al.,
2011; Fleming et al., 2012), only one study directly com-
pared these different coils for LICI in a small sample (n = 8)
(Valzania et al., 1994). The LICI responses obtained at
stimulation intensities of 110 and 120% resting motor
threshold with either a circular or a figure-of-eight coil
were similar in this study.
Other methodological differences are more likely to
hamper direct comparison between centres. Centres 2 and
4 applied two pulses with an intensity of 110% resting
motor threshold while the other centres applied two
pulses at 120% of the resting motor threshold. This was
previously shown to yield small differences in the LICI re-
sponse (Valls-Sole
´ et al., 1992), and may have contributed
to the weaker mean LICI (41) seen in Centre 2. Despite
the difference in stimulation intensity used in Centres 3 and
4, the mean LICI is 51 in both refractory epilepsy groups
at ISIs 100, 150 and 200 ms (Table 2), contrasting with
previous studies showing facilitation at these ISIs in refrac-
tory epilepsy (Badawy et al., 2010a, 2013, 2013c, d). In
our refractory epilepsy groups, facilitation is only seen at
50 ms in genetic generalized epilepsy (Centres 3 and 4) and
at 250 ms in focal epilepsy (Centre 3, Table 2). Two centres
(Centres 1 and 2) used biphasic pulses for stimulation.
Biphasic
and
monophasic
pulses
preferentially
excite
partly different sets of cortical axons when using the
same coil orientation (Groppa et al., 2012), potentially
contributing to different response patterns. The number
of repetitions and stimulation sequence (random or fixed)
also differed, being relatively low in all centres, except in
Centre 1, where each ISI was repeated 50 times. Recent
studies suggest the use of 20–30 repetitions for single
pulse and short-interval paired-pulse protocols (Chang
et al., 2016; Goldsworthy et al., 2016), although 10 repe-
titions are commonly used in studies of epilepsy (Badawy
et al., 2010b, 2012, 2013a, b, c, 2014). All these methodo-
logical differences result in a net intercentre variability,
which limits the direct comparison of LICI outcomes
from different centres. We accounted for intercentre vari-
ability by using a linear mixed-effects model, and although
this is a methodological robust solution, it cannot replace a
prospective multi-centre study in which all centres use
exactly the same materials and methods. Despite the differ-
ent methods, however, the results of Centres 1, 3 and 4
(and 2) are consistent, making the difference with the re-
sults
of
previous
studies
all
the
more
striking.
The
individual studies that constituted our sample were set up
as prospective TMS trials and part of the data were previ-
ously reported [Centre 1: de Goede and van Putten (2017),
Centre 3: Pawley et al. (2017) and Centre 4 (including pa-
tients with Dravet syndrome): Stern et al. (2017)]. In none
of these studies were previous promising results replicated
(Badawy et al., 2010a, 2013, 2013c, d), spurring the cur-
rent retrospective multi-centre analysis. Only one centre
(Centre 3) in our study included all three participant
types. Despite the same protocol and equipment being
used, there was no significant difference between LICI mea-
sured in refractory generalized epilepsy, refractory focal
epilepsy
and
control
groups
in
this
centre
(see
also
Pawley et al., 2017).
The LICI response ratios were not normally distributed in
our sample. This is in line with one previous study of LICI
(Silbert et al., 2015). Another study, reporting on a large
cohort of healthy subjects, showed that resting motor
threshold and short-interval intracortical inhibition do not
follow a normal distribution (Wassermann, 2002). We sug-
gest that statistical analyses of TMS variables should be
done on log-transformed data. Furthermore, responses at
different ISIs should be treated as repeated measurements,
warranting corrections for multiple comparisons when sev-
eral ISIs are measured in the same participants (Pawley
et al., 2017).
Some authors consistently report low interindividual vari-
ability of LICI (Badawy et al., 2010b, 2012, 2013, 2013a,
c, d, 2014, 2015; Badawy and Jackson, 2012); however,
others reported much higher variability of TMS responses
(Valls-Sole
´
et
al.,
1992;
Wassermann
et
al.,
1996;
Nakamura et al., 1997; Sanger et al., 2001; Wassermann,
2002; Lang et al., 2011; Du et al., 2014). In our cohort, the
response ratio to long-interval paired pulse stimulation
varied between individuals from strong inhibition to facili-
tation supporting some previous studies (Valls-Sole
´ et al.,
1992; Bolden et al., 2017). LICI variability was shown to
be linked to the time of day and sleep status (Lang et al.,
2011), neuropsychological profile (Bolden et al., 2017) and
to age and hemispheric dominance (Vallence et al., 2017).
While some TMS variables were shown to vary according
to the menstrual cycle (Smith et al., 2002; Inghilleri et al.,
2004; Hattemer et al., 2007), no data are available for
LICI. These and probably other unknown factors contrib-
ute to the large interindividual variability of LICI and need
to be adequately accounted for. One previous study ac-
counted for the interindividual variability by using a
mixed model analysis, similar to our approach (Silbert
et al., 2015).
An ideal biomarker for epilepsy diagnosis and manage-
ment should show a difference in cortical excitability be-
tween
drug-naı
¨ve
subjects
with
epilepsy
and
healthy
controls. To be of clinical use for the management of epi-
lepsy, it needs to show normalization of cortical excitability
soon after treatment initiation in those who become seiz-
ure-free, but not in those with refractory seizures. In the
latter group, cortical excitability should remain different

 from controls despite treatment indicating active epilepsy
with (refractory) seizures. Our analysis (both with and
without Centre 2), however, shows the opposite effect.
A good biomarker should also have low interindividual
variability, so that it can also be used to assess disease
activity on an individual level. In our analysis, we only
included subjects with refractory seizures and controls.
Based on our findings showing both no significant differ-
ences between subjects with refractory epilepsy and con-
trols, and a variable response to long-interval paired
pulse stimulation, we argue that the use of LICI measured
with TMS-EMG as a biomarker for epilepsy is limited and
that a prospective trial is urgently needed to confirm this
finding. Recent studies show that combining TMS with
EEG may provide a more direct method to assess cortical
excitability and underlying processes (Ilmoniemi et al.,
1997; Ilmoniemi and Kicic
´, 2010). There is only one
report of paired pulse TMS-EEG in epilepsy (Kimiskidis
et al., 2017). Using feature selection methods combined
with a Bayesian classifier, this study found a cross-validated
diagnostic accuracy of 0.92 for differentiating genetic gen-
eralized epilepsy from healthy controls and 0.80 for differ-
entiating responders from non-responders, suggesting that
paired pulse TMS-EEG may be useful for diagnosis and the
assessment of disease severity (Kimiskidis et al., 2017).
Further research is needed to extend and confirm these
findings. TMS-EEG may also help to reveal the mechanisms
underlying the difference in LICI at ISIs of 100 and 150 ms
and LICI at ISIs 50, 200 and 250 ms that we found in all
groups of our cohort.
Conclusion
In this retrospective study, we could not replicate the dif-
ference in LICI measured with TMS-EMG between people
with refractory genetic generalized and focal epilepsy and
healthy controls consistently reported in previous studies.
Methodological
differences,
especially
shorter
intertrial
intervals, may have contributed to our inability to replicate
previous findings. Further studies are needed to assess the
influence of the length of the intertrial interval on LICI and
to establish guidelines for LICI stimulation protocols. Based
on our findings, LICI measured with TMS-EMG is unlikely
to be useful as a biomarker in the clinical management of
epilepsy. Future prospective multi-centre trials are needed
to confirm this finding.
