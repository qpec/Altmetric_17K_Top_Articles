Study objectives: To determine the effect of light exposure on subsequent sleep characteristics under ambulatory field conditions.
Methods: Twenty healthy participants were fitted with ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and wrist-actigraphs to assess light exposure, rest–activity, sleep 
quality, timing, and architecture. Laboratory salivary dim-light melatonin onset was analyzed to determine endogenous circadian phase.
Results: Later circadian clock phase was associated with lower intensity (R2 = 0.34, χ2(1) = 7.19, p < .01), later light exposure (quadratic, controlling for 
daylength, R2 = 0.47, χ2(3) = 32.38, p < .0001), and to later sleep timing (R2 = 0.71, χ2(1) = 20.39, p < .0001). Those with later first exposure to more than 10 lux 
of light had more awakenings during subsequent sleep (controlled for daylength, R2 = 0.36, χ2(2) = 8.66, p < .05). Those with later light exposure subsequently 
had a shorter latency to first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episode (R2 = 0.21, χ2(1) = 5.77, p < .05). Those with less light exposure subsequently had a 
higher percentage of REM sleep (R2 = 0.43, χ2(2) = 13.90, p < .001) in a clock phase modulated manner. Slow-wave sleep accumulation was observed to be 
larger after preceding exposure to high maximal intensity and early first light exposure (p < .05).
Conclusions: The quality and architecture of sleep is associated with preceding light exposure. We propose that light exposure timing and intensity do 
not only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep but also homeostatic sleep pressure. These novel ambulatory PSG findings are the first to highlight the 
direct relationship between light and subsequent sleep, combining knowledge of homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep by light. Upon confirmation by 
interventional studies, this hypothesis could change current understanding of sleep regulation and its relationship to prior light exposure.
Clinical trial details: This study was not a clinical trial. The study was ethically approved and nationally registered (NL48468.042.14).
Keywords: circadian rhythms, chronobiology, scoring, sleep/wake mechanisms, actigraphy.
Statement of Significance
This research is the first application of ambulatory polysomnography in the assessment of the regulation of sleep. This study demonstrates that 
laboratory findings of light exposure being related to subsequent sleep characteristics are observable in real life situations for the first time. Through these 
observations, we form the basis of a hypothesis for the interaction of light exposure and sleep regulation. If supported by intervention studies to be correct, 
current models of sleep regulation will need to be reassessed.
INTRODUCTION
Light is the primary zeitgeber (entraining cue) for the verte-
brate circadian system. In mammals, light information is pro-
jected to the circadian pacemaker or synchronizer (located in 
the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN1) via intrin-
sically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).2 Light 
entrainment is modulated, not only by the duration of light 
exposure, but also by its intensity and spectral composition.3,4 
Additionally, light can influence sleep timing, duration, struc-
ture, and quality.5 These sleep characteristics6–8and the intensity 
of sleep9 are controlled by the circadian drive for wakefulness 
and the accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure during 
preceding wakefulness. We hypothesize that light has an influ-
ence on subsequent sleep by either altering the rate of sleep 
pressure build up or by altering the timing of the circadian-mod-
ulated wake drive.
Timing of light exposure has been observed to be linked 
to clock phase, estimated by the time of dim-light melatonin 
onset (DLMO), both in the laboratory3,10,11 and in real-life sit-
uations.12–16 However, behavioral timing during some highly 
controlled laboratory studies in animals does not match obser-
vations in the field, such as in the cases of House mice,17 Spiny 
mice,18 Golden hamsters,19 and Tuco tucos20 (e.g., hamsters are 
nocturnal in the laboratory but diurnal in the wild). These con-
tradictions might be explained by the multiple factors that could 
affect sleep timing, duration, and structure, which are excluded 
under controlled laboratory conditions. For humans, social 
restrictions, environmental influences, eating patterns, artificial 
light, disturbances by family or pets, and work schedules are 
just a few examples that could alter circadian entrainment.
In laboratory settings, sleep timing, duration, and structure 
have been linked to both evening21–26 and morning single-day 
bright light exposure8,10,25 with morning light advancing sleep 
timing and leading to a reduction of sleep duration at the ex-
pense of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.25 Some field studies 
have gone further in assessing how light exposure influences 
sleep when individuals have the freedom to habitually sleep and 
conduct their usual daily routines. Objective actigraph and sub-
jective field measurements have shown that earlier sleep tim-
ing is related to more daytime light exposure, either with27or 
without imposed sleep schedules.28–30 Earlier light timing also 
resulted in earlier sleep phase,15 and repeated bright daytime 
light exposure has been observed to lead to earlier sleep phase 
in Alzheimer’s disease patients in real-life settings.31 Consistent 
with this, later and lower intensity light exposure has also been 
linked to later sleep phases in subjective field studies.32,33 The 
relationship between light exposure and sleep duration remains 
less clear. In an intervention-field study, a reduction in day-
time light intensity was linked to a decrease in sleep duration,34 
whereas without intervention, the presence of electrical lighting

in addition to normal sunlight led to a decrease in sleep dur-
ation.35 This paradox might be explained by timing of light. In 
the evening, additional light seems to decrease sleep duration, 
whereas during the day it increases sleep duration. There is a 
lack of real-life modern society observational studies assess-
ing the association of everyday light exposure with subsequent 
sleep timing and duration.
In subjective reports of sleep in nonintervention field stud-
ies, it was observed that sleep quality was considerably reduced 
when individuals had low exposure to light during the day.36–38 
Laboratory electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown 
that light directly before24,39,40 or during sleep41 increases sleep 
disturbance. Increased daytime light exposure through add-
itional lighting in Alzheimer care homes has confirmed labora-
tory study findings that bright light during the day results in a 
reduction of sleep disturbances42 and an increase in sleep con-
solidation.43 These sleep parameters are key experimental tar-
gets for improving health44 and therefore require more detailed 
description under ambulatory conditions.
With the current field study, we sought to simultaneously 
assess the link between light exposure and subsequent sleep 
timing, duration, sleep structure, and objective quality without 
experimental intervention. Although observational field studies 
have gone far in corroborating laboratory findings, the influence 
of light exposure on sleep structure and objective quality has 
not been assessed in the field. Through a multiple-day, compara-
tive analysis of both rest–activity data and polysomnography 
(PSG)-based sleep data, with preceding light exposure, we can 
determine whether laboratory findings are transferable to real-
life settings for the first time. Furthermore, we seek to assess 
whether sleep timing, quality, or architecture depends on prior 
light intensity and timing, and whether these relationships are 
mediated by the individual’s clock phase. We intend to assess 
whether current laboratory finding-based sleep regulation mod-
els remain valid under ambulatory conditions in the field.
METHODS
Participants
For this study, 23 participants were recruited of which 20 healthy 
male (n = 8) and female (n = 12) subjects aged 20–29 years 
(average 23.4 ± 2.2 [±SD]) were used for analysis. Chronotype 
was assessed via the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire30 
(MCTQ) as mid-sleep on free days (MSF) regardless of alarm-
clock use. To ensure large variation in chronotypes, the dataset 
contained eight very early (MSF range 2.75–3.79, 3.50 ± 0.33 
[mean ± SD]), nine intermediate (MSF range 4.63–4.83, 
4.72 ± 0.09 [mean ± SD]), and three very late (MSF range 7.04–
7.75, 7.33 ± 0.37 [mean ± SD]) chronotypes. These cutoffs were 
aimed at obtaining 10% of the Dutch chronotype distribution 
in each category, as determined by the updated Dutch MCTQ 
database45 consisting of 4132 people from the Netherlands aged 
20–30 years. Participants were excluded when they had mod-
erate or severe sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index46 [PSQI], ≥10), tendencies for anxiety and/or depres-
sion (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale47 [HADS], ≥8 
and Beck Depression Inventory48 [BDI], ≥8), existing chronic 
medical conditions, the need for medication use, previous head 
injury, epilepsy, smoking, excessive use of alcohol or caffeine 
(>3 and >8 glasses per day, respectively), any use of recreational 
drugs in the last year, having a BMI of <18 or >27 or a body 
weight of <36 kg, having travelled across more than one time-
zone in the last month or had a history of shift work (in-house 
general health questionnaire), or color-blindness (Ishihara color 
blindness test49).
In total, 23 participants were recruited into the study after 
meeting all inclusion criteria. Of these, three were excluded 
from both analyses: one dropped out, one was excluded based 
on inaccurate completion of inclusion questionnaires, and one 
was excluded due to unreliable light data for both assessment 
periods. A further six participants were only excluded from 
PSG analyses either due to malfunction of the actigraph (five) 
or due to unreliable light data (one; Supplementary Table S1).
The study procedures were approved by the Medical Ethical 
Research Committee of the University Medical Centre 
Groningen (NL48468.042.14), The Netherlands and are in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All partic-
ipants gave written informed consent.
Study Design
The data presented here are a subset of measures from a larger 
ambulatory assessment of biological rhythms in the field. 
Here, only rest–activity, light exposure, and PSG measures are 
described. The study took place between November 2014 and 
January 2016 in Groningen, The Netherlands.
The study duration totaled 3 weeks, the first 6 days being an 
ambulatory field assessment of rest–activity (MotionWatch 
8™, MW8™, CamNTech Ltd., UK), light intensity monitor-
ing from the same actigraph, followed by a weekend labora-
tory assessment of salivary melatonin to calculate clock phase 
under standardized dim light conditions of <10 lux (DLMO; see 
Figure 1). Eight samples were obtained, one per hour, ending at 
habitual sleep onset (weighted average of sleep onset for work-
days and freedays). To avoid the dim light conditions affect-
ing subsequent measurements, there were no observations for 
a minimum of 1 week after saliva sampling. After this break, 
participants undertook two nights of home PSG recordings 
(Actiwave™, CamNTech Ltd., UK) to measure sleep architec-
ture. The recordings took place on a Wednesday and Saturday 
night, in randomized order. Electrode placement and removal 
was conducted at the facility (a visit of maximum 1 hour, at 
least 3 hours before sleep onset). Concomitant actigraph light 
intensity monitoring continued throughout this period. There 
were no interventions throughout the study; however, on two 
instances of <1 hour, participants were required to attend our 
facilities briefly during the first week of the study to have bat-
teries replaced and to return other devices.
Measurements
All time codes were converted to Greenwich mean time (GMT) 
+ 1 hour. All daylight savings time adjustments were removed.
Rest–Activity
Activity counts were collected in 1-minute epochs using a 
MotionWatch 8™ (MW8™, CamNTech Ltd., UK), worn on

the nondominant wrist. Activity timing and rest duration were 
calculated using Sleep analysis software (version 7, CamNTech 
Ltd., UK). Activity offsets were determined as the time when 
activity and light reduced and activity was observed to be 
less consolidated (assisted by software algorithm from Sleep 
Analysis 7, CamNTech Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and maintained 
at a reduced level for at least 10 minutes. Activity onsets were 
determined using the reverse algorithm of activity offset. Sleep 
onset and offset were assessed by PSG (see Methods).
DLMO Assessment
Salivary melatonin was collected using Salivette®, Sarstedt™ 
Ltd., Germany. Samples were centrifuged and stored overnight 
at approximately 4°C and then stored at −80°C. On completion 
of the study, a double-antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) was 
performed to assess melatonin concentration levels (Bühlmann 
Direct Saliva Melatonin kit, Bühlmann Laboratories AG, 
Switzerland; intra-assay variation: 13.97% and 9.11%; interas-
say variation: 13.99% and 14.64% for low and high concen-
tration controls, respectively). DLMO was marked as the first 
time where melatonin concentrations exceeded the 4 pg/mL 
threshold upon linear interpolation of subsequent melatonin 
values.
PSG Details
PSG was measured using five scalp electrodes (Fpz, Cz, C3, 
C4, and Oz), a reference electrode on the left mastoid, two 
electro-oculogram (EOG) electrodes, and one electromyogram 
(EMG) electrode either under the chin or on eyebrow muscle 
(when a beard obstructed chin electrode attachment). PSG sig-
nals were sampled at 128 Hz, 8 bits and scored in 30-second 
epochs according to AASM scoring criteria50 with a 50-Hz 
notch filter, 0.3-Hz high-pass filter, and a 32-Hz low-pass fil-
ter (Vitascore software, TEMEC, The Netherlands). Sleep onset 
was determined as the time of at least 5 consolidated minutes 
of sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM). First slow-wave sleep 
(SWS) episode was defined as the first occurrence of an epoch 
of stage N3 sleep. First REM sleep episode was defined as 
the first REM epoch occurrence. The number of awakenings, 
i.e., transitions from sleep to wake epochs, was utilized as a 
sleep disturbance proxy. Although electrodes were fitted at the 
Human study facility, University of Groningen, all participants 
slept at home at a self-chosen time. Sleep stage accumulation 
data were calculated based on hypnogram cumulative percent-
age of total sleep time. Division of sleep stage accumulation 
data by high or low maximum fitted light intensity was defined 
as individuals with a maximum light intensity on the day of 
subsequent sleep of either higher or lower than the median of 
3.01 log10(lux) (two groups of n = 7). Splitting the group by 
time of first exposure to more than 10 lux (two groups of n = 7) 
was at the median of 8.90 hours. Once the groups were split by 
high or low light intensity, or early or late first exposure to more 
than 10 lux, the groups were further split by DLMO. This split 
was conducted on the group as a whole at the median DLMO of 
20.07 hours. This resulted in different sample sizes of “early” 
and “late” clock types; sample sizes are stated in the relevant 
figure legends. Detailed description of obtained light values 
and intra-individual distributions of light measurements in this 
study were described by Woelders and colleagues.51 All DLMO 
split accumulation results are presented in the text with graphs 
to be found in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.
Light Data
Light data from the MotionWatch were cut to end at sleep onset 
of the sleep/rest period of interest (e.g., beginning of sleep 
according to PSG recording). The light data were cut to begin 
at the sleep onset preceding the night of interest. Therefore, 
light data included light exposure throughout the night and 
day (approximately 24 hours) preceding the sleep of interest. 
Because circadian responses to light follow a log-linear rela-
tionship,52,53 all light data (measured in lux) were log10 trans-
formed after values below device sensitivity threshold were 
set to 1 lux. To estimate the time of maximal light exposure, a 
linear harmonic regression analysis with a single sine wave, fit-
ted per 24 hours due to the entrained nature of the participants’ 
rhythms (CircWave,54 version 1.4, University of Groningen, 
The Netherlands), was fitted through the log-transformed 
lux values for each day separately. We smoothed the data by 
Figure 1—Study design representation. Timeline shows the two assessment periods (rest–activity; and PSG). Light measurements are shown 
in yellow with subsequent rest periods (blue) and sleep periods (green). The first half of the timeline indicates a week of rest–activity meas-
urements with light and subsequent sleep comparisons indicated by the red arrows. All daily comparisons of light and subsequent sleep were 
included in the analyses controlling for subject. After this rest–activity measurement period, a salivary melatonin collection was conducted to 
determine subject’s DLMO (grey). Following this, there was a period of no assessments lasting at least 1 week dependent on the subject’s 
randomization of a Wednesday or Saturday first PSG assessment night (dashed lines). The two PSG recordings are shown in green and each 
was compared with the preceding light exposure (indicated by blue arrows).

a local polynomial regression procedure (LOESS55; span of 
72 minutes). We then calculated the first and last times at which 
the smoothed (LOESS) data crossed the 1 log10(lux) threshold 
on each day, to determine the times of first and last exposure 
to more than 10 lux. The threshold of 10 lux was chosen based 
on previous evidence of sleep alterations56 and/or phase shifts57 
with lux values above this threshold. Maximal light intensity 
was calculated per day from the smoothed (LOESS) log10-trans-
formed data. Raw average light intensity was calculated from 
the nonsmoothed log-transformed data.
Statistical Analysis
Light and sleep comparisons were always confined to a period 
of light exposure and the directly subsequent rest or sleep period 
(in rest–activity and PSG measurement periods, respectively). 
All reliable daily light-rest or light-sleep comparisons were 
included in statistical analyses while controlling for subject. 
Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, 2015; 
version: 3.2.3), using the most recent shell of Rstudio (version: 
0.99.491) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects mode-
ling.58 In all models, participant ID was included as a random 
effect. A critical p-value of .05 was maintained for all analy-
ses. As a goodness-of-fit parameter for these mixed models, 
the marginal R2 was reported, using the “MuMIn” R-package. 
This parameter represents the variance explained by the fixed 
factors in the model.59 Sleep parameters were included in the 
model as dependent variables, whereas light parameters were 
included as fixed effects (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). 
Daylength and DLMO (covariates) were included as additional 
fixed effects. Daylength was included as the timing and inten-
sity of light exposure might be season-modulated. Daylength 
was calculated as dusk clock time–dawn clock time on the day 
of observation. DLMO was included in the analysis to observe 
the contribution of clock phase to these relationships. When fit-
ting the models, Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) (“drop1” 
function, “lme4” package) were compared to perform back-
ward selection on the most complex model, dropping the least 
significant term at each iteration. Insignificant covariates were 
considered before independent variables of primary interest 
were dropped from the model. Only in the models where max-
imal light intensity was significant, timing of maximal light in-
tensity was tested for significance to investigate whether light 
intensity, independent of timing, could affect sleep. Timing of 
maximum light intensity was discarded when the model did 
not improve significantly. For all analyses, a quadratic term 
of the independent variable was added to the model and dis-
carded when not significant. All sleep and light parameters were 
regressed against DLMO and its quadratic term to assess the 
influence of clock phase on these parameters.
For the analysis of the sleep stage accumulation over the sleep 
period, mixed-effects linear models were fitted using the “lme4” 
library in R.60 The dependent variable was either REM-sleep, 
SWS, or wake accumulation since sleep onset (as a percentage 
of total sleep duration). Participant ID was included in these 
models as a random factor. The first fixed factor was either the 
light intensity group, light timing group, or the DLMO group, 
depending on how the data were split. Time since sleep onset 
(as a percentage of total sleep duration, rounded to the nearest 
integer) was included as the second fixed factor. To allow for 
testing of the difference between two groups (first fixed factor) 
for each time value since sleep onset (second fixed factor) sep-
arately, the latter factor was converted from a numerical factor 
into a categorical factor (101 categories, range: 0%–100%) be-
fore fitting the models. The interaction term was included as the 
third and final fixed factor. After fitting these models to the data, 
each model contained 101 interaction coefficients (i.e., the dif-
ference between the two groups for each time after sleep onset). 
For each model, post hoc analysis was then performed on these 
101 interaction coefficients (H0: coefficient ≠ 0), via a general 
linear hypothesis testing procedure (the “glht” function in the 
“multcomp” R-library). The resulting p-values were corrected 
for multiplicity using the single-step method.61
Throughout the results section, all results are written as 
+quadratic term if the quadratic of the independent variable 
(either light parameter or DLMO) significantly contributed to 
the model; +daylength if daylength significantly contributed to 
the model; and +DLMO if DLMO timing significantly contrib-
uted to the model; in these cases, details of the sign of the coef-
ficient are provided to explain its interaction with the dependent 
variable (sleep parameter). If, on testing, only the linear term 
of the independent variable significantly contributed to explain 
the variance of the dependent variable, no covariate is stated. 
Additionally, the R2, chi-square statistic (χ2), associated degrees 
of freedom and p-value for the final model are provided. Any 
models where the linear term of the independent variable did not 
significantly explain dependent variable variance were deemed 
insignificant regardless of covariate significance. For results 
of models containing only the linear term or the linear terms 
and the quadratic term of the independent variable, graphs are 
shown as raw data with model fit indicated (for PSG graphs, 
average datapoints ± SE are provided). For results of models 
containing any additional covariates (i.e., DLMO timing and/or 
daylength), data are shown as the model prediction ± model SE 
and raw data are omitted, to facilitate graphical representation.
RESULTS
Light Exposure
The large range of DLMO timing in this dataset (see Table 1) 
enabled an assessment of the relationship between DLMO tim-
ing (considered to represent clock phase) and light exposure. 
An example of the original data is provided (Figure 2). In gen-
eral, earlier light exposure was observed to be coupled to ex-
posure to higher intensity light (Table 1).
Later DLMO was related to lower maximal light exposure for 
both the rest–activity (+quadratic term, R2 = 0.23, χ2(2) = 10.01, 
p < .01) and the PSG assessment periods (no covariate, R2 = 0.34, 
χ2(1) = 7.19, p < .01; Figure 3A; see Supplementary Table S2 
for coefficient information). As well as a lower intensity of light 
exposure, later DLMO timing was also related to later light ex-
posure. A later DLMO was observed to be associated with later 
first light exposure (+quadratic term, R2 = 0.14, χ2(2) = 9.82, 
p < .01; Figure 3B), and a later last light exposure to more than 
10 lux during both the rest–activity assessment (no covariate, 
R2 = 0.07, χ2(1) = 4.24, p < .05) and the PSG period (+quadratic 
term, +daylength, R2 = 0.56, χ2(3) = 13.03, p < .005, and +quad-
ratic term, R2 = 0.32, χ2(2) = 6.23, p < .05, respectively). Later

DLMO was also associated with later time of maximal light ex-
posure (+quadratic term, +daylength, R2 = 0.47, χ2(3) = 32.38, 
p < .0001) for rest–activity assessment days (see Figure 2 for an 
example) and PSG days (+quadratic, R2 = 0.58, χ2(2) = 19.39, 
p < .0001).
Rest–activity and Sleep Timing
As expected, clock phase (DLMO) correlated positively with be-
havioral measures of activity and PSG-based measures of sleep. 
Later DLMO timing was related to a later activity offset (no 
covariate, R2 = 0.27, χ2(1) = 12.76, p < .001; see Supplementary 
Table S1 for coefficient information), and in agreement, a later 
sleep onset (no covariate, R2 = 0.71, χ2(1) = 20.39, p < .0001; 
Figure 3C). Later DLMO timing was related to a later activity 
onset (+quadratic term, R2 = 0.50, χ2(2) = 37.02, p < .0001) 
and likewise to a later sleep offset (no covariate, R2 = 0.53, 
χ2(1) = 12.37, p < .001). A later DLMO timing was observed 
to be associated with a longer rest duration (+quadratic term, 
R2 = 0.08, χ2(2) = 8.19, p < .05), in contradiction to the lack of 
relationship observed for sleep duration (p > .05). Although it 
might be expected that a similar relationship for rest and sleep 
would appear from the data, the rest duration actually consists 
of a consolidated period of inactivity, whereas sleep duration is 
the period between sleep onset and offset possibly accounting 
for this mismatch. In line with these findings, when splitting the 
study sample by DLMO timing, DLMO group was observed 
to be related to sleep onset timing and the phase angle between 
DLMO and sleep onset (see Table 1). This completes an overall 
picture of a later clock phase (DLMO timing) being related to 
later sleep timing and a shorter interval between DLMO and 
sleep onset. Interestingly, individuals classified as having low 
light exposure also a shorter phase angle between their DLMO 
and sleep onsets (Table 1).
As DLMO timing was observed to be related to both light 
exposure and sleep timing, regression analysis was utilized 
to assess the relationship between light exposure, and ac-
tivity and sleep timing on the same day. Activity timing 
was observed to have a quadratic relationship to the time of 
last exposure to more than 10 lux. A later activity offset was 
related to both very early and very late last exposure to more

than 10 lux, when accounting for the positive relationship 
DLMO has with activity timing (+quadratic term, +DLMO, 
R2 = 0.45, χ2(3) = 44.75, p < .0001). This same relationship was 
observed for activity onset (+quadratic and +DLMO, R2 = 0.44, 
χ2(3) = 30.93, p < .0001). A similar relationship was observed 
for sleep onset and offset with last exposure to more than 10 
lux, although DLMO timing was not observed to significantly 
be involved in the relationship (sleep onset: +quadratic term, 
R2 = 0.68, χ2(2) = 22.09, p < .0001; sleep offset: +quadratic term, 
R2 = 0.68, χ2(2) = 20.39, p < .0001). Activity onset was also 
positively associated with first exposure to more than 10 lux and 
time of maximal light exposure, when controlling for the posi-
tive relationship between DLMO timing and activity onset (first 
exposure: +DLMO, R2 = 0.43, χ2(2) = 28.32, p < .0001 and time 
of maximal light exposure: +DLMO, R2 = 0.49, χ2(2) = 37.92, 
p < .0001). Interestingly, longer rest duration was associated 
with lower maximal light intensity on the preceding day (no 
covariate, R2 = 0.05, χ2(1) = 4.83, p < .05), and a later timing of 
maximal light exposure (no covariate, R2 = 0.05, χ2(1) = 4.82, 
p < .05). In general, individuals who had more time between 
waking and being exposed to 10 lux for the first time were likely 
to have that first exposure later in the day (Table 1).
Phase Angle Between Sleep Onset and DLMO
The phase angle between sleep onset and DLMO was also 
assessed as covariate, but did not contribute significantly to any 
of the models tested (p > .05).
Light Exposure and Subsequent Sleep Disturbance
Subjects with a late DLMO also showed less sleep stage tran-
sitions, except for one included subject, who had a very late 
DLMO while experiencing more sleep transitions than those 
with moderate late DLMO timing (+quadratic term, R2 = 0.32, 
χ2(2) = 6.81, p < .05; Supplementary Table S2).
In general, individuals who were first exposed to 10 lux later 
had significantly more subjectively reported sleep disturbances 
(Table 1). Objectively recorded sleep disturbances were found 
to depend on previous light exposure, but time of maximal 
light exposure did not significantly contribute to this effect. 
Later time of first exposure to 10 lux was also related to more 
awakenings, when controlling for daylength (+daylength, 
R2 = 0.36, χ2(2) = 8.66, p < .05, Figure 4A). Lower maximal 
light exposure resulted in fewer awakenings, when accounting 
for variance explained by DLMO timing (+DLMO, R2 = 0.26, 
χ2(2) = 6.98, p < .05, Figure 4B). Timing of DLMO was found 
to additively contribute (coefficient: 1.01, p < .05) such that 
later DLMO timing was related to an increased number of 
awakenings (Figure 4B and Table 2). Additionally, later time 
of first exposure to more than 10 lux seemed related to more 
wake after sleep onset (trend: p = .053). This seems in line 
with the finding that later first light exposure correlate with 
more awakenings (Figure 4A), but contrasts with the correl-
ation showing less sleep stage transitions in people with late 
DLMO (Supplementary Table S2). Sleep characteristics are 
summarized in Table 2. No differences were found between the 
two PSG nights (weekday and weekend recordings) in terms of 
sleep disturbances, architecture, timing, or stage accumulation; 
or their relationships with preceding light exposure (p > .05; 
data not shown). No effect of randomization order of starting 
PSG night was observed (p > .05; data not shown).
Sleep Architecture
The timing of the DLMO was not related, on its own, to any 
aspect of subsequent sleep architecture (p > .05). Light ex-
posure variables on their own or combined with DLMO did 
explain variation in sleep architecture. A later time of first 
exposure to >10 lux (no covariate, R2 = 0.21, χ2(1) = 5.77, 
p < .05, Figure 5A) and a later timing of maximal light ex-
posure (+quadratic, +DLMO, R2 = 0.36, χ2(2) = 11.17, p < .01, 
Figure 5B) were associated with a subsequent shorter latency 
to first REM episode. The findings might seem paradoxical 
since REM sleep propensity is thought to be directly influenced 
Figure 3—Relationships between dim-light melatonin onset, light exposure, and sleep timing. (A) Higher maximal fitted light intensity exposure 
was related to earlier DLMO timing. (B) In a curvi-linear fashion, later DLMO was generally related to later time of first exposure to >10 lux when 
accounting for differences in daylength (model prediction: black line, standard error of mixed model: grey range). (C) Later DLMO timing was 
related to later sleep onset.

by the circadian clock. Hence, at first sight, later DLMO was 
expected to correlate with the later occurrence of REM sleep. 
However, the first (or even second) REM sleep bout can be sup-
pressed if non-REM propensity is high. Therefore, we inves-
tigated the effects of light intensity on subsequent non-REM 
and REM sleep. Higher maximal intensity of light on the day 
before sleeping with PSG was followed by lower percentages of 
REM sleep, when accounting for variance explained by DLMO 
timing (+DLMO, R2 = 0.43, χ2(2) = 13.90, p < .001, Figure 5C). 
The negative coefficient for DLMO timing as a covariate indi-
cates that later DLMO timing was related to a subsequent lower 
percentage of REM sleep (see Supplementary Table S2 for co-
efficient information), which may indicate that higher sleep def-
icit in late sleepers may reduce or eliminate the first REM sleep 
bout. In the same lines, the percentage of stage 1 sleep was 
observed to be lower in those individuals who were classified 
as being exposed to higher light intensity light (Table 2). This 
could indicate that shorter latencies to non-REM sleep occur-
ring when individuals are exposed to higher maximal light, a 
pressure for SWS overrides the balance of other sleep stages. 
This can also be observed with the dominating increase in per-
centage of subsequent SWS at higher average light intensities 
Figure 4—Light exposure and its relationship to subsequent sleep disturbances. (A) Later first exposure to more than 10 lux was related to 
increased sleep disturbance (number of awakenings per hour), when controlling for daylength (model prediction: black line, standard error of 
mixed model: grey range). (B) Higher maximal light intensities during the day were followed by more sleep disturbances (number of awaken-
ings per hour TST) within DLMO timing groups (DLMO) timing (red: DLMO > 21 hours, orange: 19 hours ≤ DLMO ≤ 21 hours, green: DLMO 
< 19 hours).

p < .05).
Sleep Stage Accumulation
In order to see how light timing and the intensity of light 
exposure interact with the subsequent accumulation rate of 
SWS, REM sleep, and wake, the sample was split into low and 
high maximal intensity exposure, and into early and late first 
exposure to >10 lux. Those individuals exposed to higher max-
imal light intensities experienced larger subsequent SWS accu-
mulation (p < .05; Figure 6A), lower subsequent REM sleep 
accumulation throughout the night (p < .05; Figure 6B), and 
lower subsequent wake accumulation at the beginning of the 
night (p < .05; Figure 6C).
Those individuals who had their first exposure to >10 lux 
earlier had significantly higher subsequent SWS accumulation 
Figure 5—Light exposure and subsequent sleep architecture. (A) Shorter latencies to first REM sleep episode were associated with preceding 
later timing to first exposure to more than 10 lux (black circles indicate average values of two PSG recordings and of the same 2 days of 
light recordings and dashed line indicates model fit) and (B) later preceding timing of maximal light exposure. (C) A lower percentage of REM 
sleep was associated with higher preceding maximal light intensities (model prediction: black line, standard error of mixed model: grey range). 
This relationship was modulated by DLMO timing, though all DLMO timing categories showed the same relationship (red: DLMO > 21 hours, 
orange: 19 hours ≤ DLMO ≤ 21 hours, green: DLMO < 19 hours).

(Figure 7A) seemingly at the expense of the accumulation of 
REM sleep in the middle of the sleep period (Figure 7B), and 
wake throughout the night (Figure 7C; p < .05).
DISCUSSION
Our data show that sleep timing, duration, structure, and the 
number of sleep disturbances observed in the field objectively, 
for the first time, depended on the aspects of preceding light 
exposure. In a sample of healthy 20 to 30 years old, selected 
for a wide range of sleep timing (MSF), we observed large 
variation in clock phases (DLMO), which optimized the prob-
ability to find relationships with preceding light parameters 
within DLMO timing groups. DLMO was added to our models 
to assess the impact of clock phase and explain the variance 
in sleep architecture dependent on the circadian clock to allow 
for a better analysis of the effect of previous light on subse-
quent sleep.62 We found that later endogenous clock timing was 
related to later timing and lower levels of light exposure. Later 
exposure to light has been observed experimentally to result in 
a later clock phase.3,10,39 This finding confirms light interven-
tions in the field12,14,15 and the finding that manipulated reduc-
tion of blue light in the morning was associated with later clock 
phases.13 Spectral light composition information would help us 
to further elucidate this relationship.
Despite the lack of intervention studies, field data indicate 
that later chronotypes are generally exposed to later light33 
Figure 6—Sleep stage accumulation related to preceding maximal light exposure intensity. (A) SWS accumulation was higher throughout the 
sleep period in individuals previously exposed to higher maximal light intensities (p < .05). (B) REM sleep accumulation was lower in individuals 
previously exposed to higher maximal light intensities (p < .05). (C) Wake accumulation was significantly lower at the beginning of the sleep 
period in individuals previously exposed to higher maximal light intensities (p < .05). In all graphs, line at top indicates a significant difference 
between groups at that time percentage of total sleep, p < .05.
Figure 7—Subsequent sleep stage accumulation related to timing of first exposure to more than 10 lux. (A) SWS accumulation was higher in 
individuals that previously had earlier first exposure to > 10 lux (p < .05). (B) REM sleep accumulation was lower in individuals that previously 
had earlier first exposure to >10 lux (p < .05). (C) Wake accumulation was significantly lower throughout the sleep period in individuals that 
previously had earlier first exposure to >10 lux (p < .05). In all graphs, line at top indicates a significant difference between groups at that time 
percentage of total sleep, p < .05.

and less time outdoors.32 This probably results in lower light 
exposure,27,33 and probably a reduction in exposure to approxi-
mately 460–490 nm photons, which are important for entrain-
ing the circadian system.63 In both our dataset and in previous 
studies, later sleep timing has been shown to be related later 
clock phase54,55 and later preceding light exposure.33,34 These 
relationships are most probably due to the influence of light 
on the entrainment of the circadian clock, which drives pro-
cess C in sleep regulation, which in turn will shift the timing of 
sleep.6,7 Because humans have on average an intrinsic circadian 
period longer than 24 hours (24.2 hours64), they need advancing 
(morning) light to entrain to the 24-hour day. Exposure to lower 
light intensities indicates reduced zeitgeber strength and oscil-
latory theory predicts that this will result in a later (lagging) 
phase angle of entrainment65,66 when intrinsic period is greater 
than 24 hours. This later phase angle of entrainment may then 
be further amplified by artificial light in the evening. In add-
ition, entrainment models would predict a bigger role for para-
metric entrainment in diurnal animals.67,68 Moreover, according 
to Aschoff’s rule, diurnal animals will lengthen intrinsic period 
with lower light intensity.69,70
Although we only found that lower maximal light intensities 
were associated with subsequent longer rest durations, studies 
with high intensity light interventions have previously focused on 
the timing of the light,8,15 rather than the intensity itself. Despite 
that, shorter subsequent sleep duration has been related to brighter 
morning light8 and exposure to artificial electric lighting.35 In the 
current study, however, no relationship between light exposure 
and sleep duration was found. This is in line with the analysis of 
sleep behavior of three preindustrial societies that indicated that 
there were no differences in sleep duration in societies without 
electric lighting compared with our industrialized sleep habits71 
(but see also Ref. 72). Because sleep onset and offset appear gated 
by the circadian system in a similar way, the reduction in the 
strength of light as the primary entrainment signal may only play 
a minimal role in the alteration of sleep duration.
Preceding light exposure, possibly through altering the bal-
ance of circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep, appears 
to be associated with the amount of subsequent sleep disturb-
ance. Later light was associated with more awakenings, in line 
with laboratory studies observing evening light being related 
to more arousals.39,73 It is unclear why late DLMO correlates 
with less sleep transitions (Supplementary Table S2), but the 
complex quadratic relationship of this correlation suggests that 
more data need to be collected to fully understand this. A clearer 
relationship was found between light parameters, DLMO, and 
number of awakenings. Late first light exposure and late clock 
phase correlate with more awakenings (Figure 4A and B). We 
have described before that people with a late clock phase sleep 
early relative to DLMO.51 This may indicate that their sleep par-
tially overlaps with the circadian drive for wakefulness, result-
ing in more awakenings.7
The influence of the circadian drive for wake promotion on 
sleep offset timing has been reported to result in a reduction 
of REM sleep, with non-REM sleep appearing unaffected.8,25 
Sleep structure appears to be related to preceding light exposure 
in our dataset. Exposure to higher levels of maximal light was 
related to less REM in subsequent sleep. In the laboratory, 
higher levels of blue photons in evening light have been associ-
ated with a reduction in REM sleep duration,24,26 whereas light 
during sleep was associated with an increased prevalence of 
REM sleep.41 Therefore, influence of light on REM sleep could 
be due to the circadian regulation of REM sleep. The timing 
of light during the daytime exposure in our subjects appears 
to be related also to the timing of the first REM episode. The 
finding that later light exposure was related to earlier first REM 
episodes indicates that the timing of light could modulate not 
only clock phase but in turn also the circadian regulated sleep 
architecture. There are two alternative explanations, either light 
is influencing sleep architecture through altering the rate of 
sleep pressure increase or through the shift of the sleep struc-
ture by a shift in the circadian-related drive for wakefulness 
(and REM sleep). What is known is that the alerting signal of 
the circadian system decreases throughout the night, rising just 
before sleep offset.7 Based on the forced desynchrony findings 
that REM sleep appears clock modulated,74 it can be hypothe-
sized that the influence of later light extending the window for 
REM sleep episodes could be due to the altered phase of the 
circadian system and a reduced sleep load build up. Through 
the sleep stage accumulation analysis, it can be observed that 
SWS has a direct relationship with the timing and intensity 
of light. As REM sleep and wake accumulation show the op-
posite pattern to SWS, it appears that light is influencing the 
homeostatic pressure shifting other sleep stages in accordance. 
Therefore, it appears that light, although known to affect the 
circadian system and in turn REM sleep, additionally increases 
the build-up of the homeostatic sleep pressure. To further assess 
the relationship of light exposure with subsequent sleep inten-
sity, an analysis of delta power decay is required. This is beyond 
the scope of this current article due to the already complex na-
ture of the included analyses. We hypothesize that the under-
lying biological mechanism for this is the direct light input 
observed from the retina to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, 
the sleep “switch” alternating sleep stages.75 Upon confirmation 
of interventional studies, this hypothesis could change the cur-
rent understanding of the regulation of sleep.
Although there appears in our pilot analysis (in Supplementary 
Material) to be some influence of DLMO timing on the rela-
tionship between light and sleep structure, this influence needs 
to be further investigated, due to small sample size once par-
ticipants were grouped by DLMO. In the main analyses of this 
study, despite the large amount of data obtained per participant, 
it is possible that this sample is not representative of the broader 
population. In addition, the majority of participants were uni-
versity students and therefore may have different lifestyles than 
the general working population. Although this might be a limi-
tation, it must also be noted that the large variation present in 
our data (through participant selection based upon chronotype) 
provides the ability to assess the relationships in a statistically 
powerful way. Another possible limitation is the assumption 
that the subsequent sleep is related to the preceding light ex-
posure rather than the sleep having an influence on future light 
exposure. Through correlational analysis, these relationships 
cannot be further elucidated here.
In general, our findings corroborate those observed in labora-
tory settings. Our observations support that despite lacking the

many factors that influence sleep in real life, laboratory find-
ings are transferable to how people sleep in naturalistic settings. 
Although light can be well controlled in the laboratory, it can be 
difficult to generalize laboratory findings to observations in the 
field where light quality and quantity show large variation over 
the day. Our study is the first to assess sleep architecture in the 
field using ambulatory PSG in the context of chronobiological 
applications, showing its reliability with the new technological 
advances utilized here. This study provides further evidence 
for the link between light exposure and the timing, duration, 
structure, and quality of subsequent sleep. Not only does this 
influence have implications for further strategies in the care for 
patients and those with sleep disturbances, but this study shows 
that light exposure shapes everyday life. Light technologies and 
those developing working schedules and living environments 
could greatly influence the sleep individuals have in real life 
and its subsequent effects on quality of life, health, productivity, 
mental performance, and safety. With confirmation from spec-
tral analysis and interventional studies, this study could alter 
the current understanding of sleep regulation and the role of 
light history.
