Abstract
The US and European guidelines have recommended testing of advanced nonesmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients for multiple targetable genomic alterations. We found that roughly one third of 814 nonsquamous
NSCLC patients in a large oncology practice had not been tested for EGFR or ALK, with more marked under
genotyping of additional genomic targets. The challenges and potential solutions are discussed.
Background: National guidelines have advocated broad molecular profiling as a part of the standard diagnostic
evaluation for advanced nonesmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the goal of identifying driver mutations for which
effective therapies or clinical trials are available. However, adherence to genomic testing guidelines could present
challenges to community oncologists. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of genomic
testing patterns in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC treated by 89 oncologists at 15 sites throughout New Jersey
and Maryland from January 2013 to December 2015. Results: A total of 814 patients (89% with stage IV; 11% with
stage IIIB) were identified in the COTA Inc database. Of the 814 patients, 479 (59%) met the guideline recommen-
dations for EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) biomarker testing; 63 (8%)
underwent comprehensive genomic profiling for all 4 major types of alterations (point mutations, indels, fusions, and
copy number amplifications). Gender, age, race, site of care (referral vs. community center), and practice size did not
influence comprehensive genomic profiling frequency. Active smokers and patients who died within 30 days were
tested less frequently (P < .05). Among those not tested for EGFR and ALK, 52% received chemotherapy without
documented reasons for no testing, 32% did not receive antineoplastic therapy, and 13% had insufficient tissue for
genotyping. Conclusion: Genomic testing presents multiple logistical challenges for the community-based oncolo-
gist, including coordination of sample handling, long turnaround times, test reimbursement, access to targeted
therapies, insufficient tissue, and patient harm from the repeat biopsies necessary if the tissue sample is insufficient.
Opportunities exist for improvement in guideline adherence, possibly through new technologies such as “liquid bi-
opsies,” which obviates the need tissue biopsy samples in select settings.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
States, with a projected 222,500 new patients diagnosed in 2017,
resulting in 155,870 deaths.1 Nonesmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for approximately 85% to 90% of cases, with 60% of
patients
presenting
with
advanced-stage
disease.1,2

 improvements in survival have been realized with the introduction
of multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy.3 However, recent advances
in our understanding of the biology of NSCLC, including both the
genomic alterations that drive malignancy and the mechanisms of
tumor immunologic escape, have led to new therapeutic ap-
proaches.4-6
The identification of oncogenic activation of tyrosine kinases in
NSCLC, such as mutations in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor
receptor) or rearrangements of the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma
kinase) gene has enabled targeted molecular treatments. Notably,
> 75% of patients with activating EGFR alterations experience
major regression with gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib and prolon-
gation of overall survival.7-10 NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor
rearrangements in ALK or ROS1 have also benefited from targeted
therapies, including crizotinib and alectinib.11-13 Targeting of the
BRAF V600E variant, MET gene amplification and exon 14 skip-
ping, RET fusions, and ERBB2 (HER2) mutations have also pro-
duced dramatic responses.14-17 These oncogenic driver mutations
account for more than one quarter of lung adenocarcinoma cases
and are targetable with approved drugs. Ongoing sequencing studies
have identified three quarters of the known drivers in this cancer, all
generally mutually exclusive, although many driver mutations might
not be amenable to medication management.18
Genomic testing for EGFR and ALK alterations as a part of the
standard diagnostic evaluation for all patients with NSCLC whose
tumors contain an element of adenocarcinoma, regardless of
the clinical characteristics of the patient, has been recommended by
the College of American Pathologists, International Association for
the Study of Lung Cancer, and Association for Molecular Pathology
(CAP/IASLC/AMP) and has been endorsed by the American Society
of Oncology.19,20 In 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) extended the recommendations for metastatic
NSCLC to include “broad molecular profiling,” consisting of not
only EGFR and ALK, but also BRAF, ERBB2 (HER2), MET, RET,
and ROS1.21 These 5 additional alterations are under consideration
for inclusion in the upcoming revised lung cancer biomarker guide-
lines by the CAP/IASLC/AMP and are included in the European
Society for Medical Oncology guidelines.22,23 The clinical impor-
tance of broad genomic testing has been bolstered by multiple studies
finding objective responses from targeted therapies in NSCLC to be 2
to 3 times better than cytotoxic chemotherapy.7-9,11-17,24
Despite these advances, genomic evaluation of NSCLC poses
major challenges in community settings. Difficulties include pro-
curing adequate tissue samples by coordination among multiple
medical specialists, selecting which biomarkers should be assayed,
patient factors (including surgical and treatment candidacy),
financial issues (including the Medicare 14-day rule for reim-
bursement), and accurate interpretation of test results.25-27 These
challenges can lead to under genotyping, with a recent series
reporting as much as 40% and 60% of patients without guideline-
recommended EGFR and ALK testing, respectively, and 19%
receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy before test result review.28 These
factors also lead to under referral to clinical trials of molecularly
targeted agents.25 In the present report, we sought to determine the
genomic testing patterns for patients with advanced NSCLC diag-
nosed in a large multisite community-based US oncology practice
and to examine the potential barriers to adherence with published
biomarker guidelines.
Patients and Methods
A retrospective medical record review of patients with patho-
logically confirmed stage IIIB and IV NSCLC, with nonsquamous
histologic findings, diagnosed between January 1, 2013 and
December 31, 2015, and treated within the Regional Cancer Care
Associates network was performed. The Regional Cancer Care As-
sociates
network
consists
of
15
community
oncology
sites
throughout New Jersey and Maryland. Cases were identified using
the COTA Inc database, which extracts and organizes relevant de-
mographic, diagnostic, treatment, and quality data from the elec-
tronic health records at all the clinical sites under business associate
agreements. Trained COTA Inc abstractors reviewed and confirmed
the medical record-derived data and the dates of testing. For the
purposes of the present study, any laboratory or pathology report
mentioning testing for a driver mutation was counted as “tested,”
regardless of method, vendor, or test completeness. The data were
then merged with the study population using blinded patient
identifiers for subsequent analysis. The overall proportion of eligible
patients receiving genomic testing in each calendar year was calcu-
lated. The overall rate of genomic testing was determined by the
number of patients tested at any point between diagnosis and the
end of the follow-up period, divided by the total study sample.
Demographic information, disease characteristics, and clinical his-
tory at the first diagnosis were compared between the tested and
nontested patients using c2 tests for equality of proportions to test
for differences in percentages (eg, testing rates), and the Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used to test for differences in the median number
of days. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical
language.29
Results
Patient Demographics
A total of 814 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC diagnosed
between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 were identified in
the COTA database (295, 226, and 293 patients received a diag-
nosis in 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively; Table 1). Of these
patients, 11% had stage IIIB and 89% stage IV disease. Adeno-
carcinoma was the most predominant pathologic subtype (89%),
followed by NSCLC, not otherwise specified (6%), large cell (2%),
and other subtypes (3%). The median age of the patient population
was 67 years, with 57% � 65 years old and 28% � 75 years old;
53% of the patients were women and 72% were white, 4% were
African-American, 3% were Asian, and the remainder was other or
undeclared. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status at diagnosis was 0 in 4%, 1 to 2 in 32%, 2 in
8%, � 3 in 2%, and not recorded in 54%. Of the 814 patients,
19% reported active tobacco use, 63% reported former use, and
17% denied smoking. The patients were treated by 89 oncologists
at 15 centers in New Jersey and Maryland. Of the 814 patients, 251
(31%) were treated by physicians caring for < 10 NSCLC patients
during the 3-year period; 75% were treated in community cancer
centers and 25% in a referral center containing a dedicated lung
cancer program.

 biomarkers (Table 2). The testing rates remained fairly constant
throughout the 3-year observation period (Table 3). The physicians
at a tertiary referral center and those with � 10 patients tested at the
same frequency as physicians at community centers or those with <
10 patients. Gender and race did not influence testing frequency.
Age (including Medicare age eligibility) did not influence testing
frequency. However, active smokers were tested less frequently than
never or former smokers (P < .01). Patients with stage IIIB disease
were tested less frequently than those with stage IV disease (P <
.05). Patients who died within 30 days of their cancer diagnosis
(P < .001) were tested less frequently. ECOG performance status
did not correlate with the testing rates, although a proportion of
patients did not have their ECOG status documented (including
the 217 patients who did not receive any drug-based therapy).
During the 3-year study, 387 patients developed progression and
received second-line therapy. The medical records of 331 of these
patients were reviewed, and < 10% had undergone genomic
profiling at that time (Table 4).
Broad Molecular Testing
The 2014 NCCN guidelines extended the recommended
genomic biomarkers to include EGFR mutations, ALK fusions,
ROS1 rearrangements, BRAF mutations, MET amplifications and
mutations, RET rearrangements, and ERBB2 (HER2) mutations.21
Of the 814 patients, only 63 (8%) met these extended guidelines.
After EGFR and ALK testing rates of 69% and 65%, respectively,
testing for additional targetable alterations decreased precipitously
for BRAF V600E (18%), ROS1 fusion (25%), MET exon 14
skipping or amplification (15%), RET fusion (14%), and ERBB2
(HER2) mutation (12%; Figure 1). Comprehensive tissue-based
genotyping rates increased throughout the 3-year observation
period, from 2% in 2013 to 16% in 2015 (Table 3). Physicians at
community centers were more likely to test for all biomarkers (9%
vs. 3%; P < .01), but physicians with > 10 patients tested at the
same frequency as physicians with < 10 patients. Gender, age, and
race did not influence testing frequency. Active smokers showed a
trend toward less frequent testing than never and former smokers
(P ¼ .07). Stage did not correlate with testing frequency. Patients
who died within 30 days of their cancer diagnosis were tested less
frequently (P < .02).
Response Time for Biomarker Testing Results
The joint CAP/IASLC/AMP recommendations require EGFR
and ALK results to be available within 2 weeks (10 working days) of
receiving the specimen in the testing laboratory.19 Laboratories with
longer response times are encouraged to establish protocols for more
rapid testing in matters of clinical urgency. Of the 479 patients
successfully tested for both EGFR and ALK in the present series, the
median response time (from the date of diagnosis to the test result
received) was 23 days. Additionally, of the 63 patients successfully
tested for all 7 NCCN recommended targets (57 using extensive
and comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels and 6
using limited-panel polymerase chain reaction), the response time
for 54 patients (85%) exceeded the recommendations (these 54
patients received test results > 14 days after the diagnosis and 37
received test results > 30 days after diagnosis). Of these 54 patients,
only 4 (7%) underwent duplicate rapid EGFR testing.
Limitations Affecting Testing
Of the 814 patients, 53 had insufficient tissue for testing of
EGFR/ALK on the initial biopsy specimen (10% of the initial
diagnostic samples sent for analysis). Of these 53 patients, 23 un-
derwent a second diagnostic biopsy (of whom 16 were ultimately
successfully tested for both EGFR and ALK). Thus, 30 of these
patients did not have testing after failure of the first sample, and 7
patients underwent repeat biopsy but still with no documentation of
test results. Of the 335 patients who did not undergo the guideline-
recommended combined EGFR/ALK biomarker testing, 22 (7% of
335) died within 30 days of the diagnosis. In contrast, 9 tested
patients (2% of 479) died within 30 days of the diagnosis (P <
.001). Testing was also not performed in 93 patients who did not
receive any antineoplastic drug-based therapy for NSCLC.

Genomic Profiling of Advanced NSCLC

- Clinical Lung Cancer
November 2017
 Of the 335 patients who did not undergo EGFR and ALK
testing, 45 had insufficient tissue samples available, 5 had other
documented reasons, 24 had rapidly died, and 86 received no
antineoplastic therapy. However, 175 patients with no documented
reason for not performing testing received antineoplastic therapy
(21% of the entire population; Table 5). Of these 175 patients, 94
(54%) received first-line therapy with pemetrexed, 40 (23%)
received bevacizumab, and 32 (18%) received combination biologic
therapy.
Implications of Testing on Treatment and Survival
Of the 479 patients tested for EGFR and ALK, 128 were noted to
harbor mutations involving EGFR or ALK (13% had EGFR mu-
tations and 3% had ALK fusions). Of these patients, 73% received
first-line matched targeted therapies. Also, 12 patients harbored
other NCCN-recommended mutations, and 2 (17%) received “off-
label” matched therapies.
Overall survival data were available for 805 patients. For the 131
patients who received a targeted therapy at some time during their
treatment, the median overall survival was 31.8 months. In contrast,
of the 482 patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy, the me-
dian overall survival was 12.7 months and was 5.1 months for the
192 patients who received only supportive care (P < .001;
Figure 2). Seventeen patients with EGFR or ALK mutations did not
receive targeted therapy but instead received chemotherapy; their
overall survival was 15.5 months.
Discussion
The present retrospective review from 15 community oncology
centers noted significant underusage of genomic testing among
patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. Although the CAP/IASLC/
AMP guidelines have recommended routine EGFR and ALK
biomarker testing, only 69% and 65%, respectively, underwent
testing in the present series. Only 12% underwent broad molecular
profiling for the 5 additional mutations recommended by the 2014
NCCN guidelines. Despite the guidelines specifically recommend-
ing testing without regard to the clinical characteristics, the physi-
cians appeared to withhold testing for active tobacco users. Smokers
as a group have a lower frequency of EGFR and ALK genomic al-
terations, but BRAF and MET mutations occur more frequently in
smokers.14,30 The testing frequency was also lower for those rapidly
approaching death.
Few studies have examined the adherence to genomic testing
guidelines in NSCLC in the community setting. A report from
Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY) also noted a sizable under-
genotyped patient population. Of 1910 patients with NSCLC (874
with nonsquamous histologic types) from 2009 to 2013, the testing
rates for EGFR and ALK were 62% and 23%, respectively, despite
an institutional policy permitting pathology department-guided
reflex testing (compared with only 26% and 7%, respectively,
before the reflex policy).31 In a separate online survey of 562 on-
cologists in 10 countries, EGFR testing was self-reported as
requested for approximately 81% of patients with advanced
NSCLC. Although 49% of oncologists responded that their treat-
ment decisions were influenced by detected mutations, 23% stated
that EGFR mutational status did not affect their first-line treatment
decisions. Separate from the histologic type, the main reasons given
for not testing were insufficient tissue, poor performance status, and
long response times.32
Even at academic centers, genomic testing can be inconsistent. A
survey of 55 National Cancer Institute-designated centers in 2012
found that all had stated policies for routine testing of NSCLC
patients for EGFR and ALK biomarkers. However, at 43% of the
institutions, the sequence of NSCLC biomarker testing relied on an
oncologist’s order; 34% performed testing for all biomarkers
upfront for patients with a new diagnosis, and 22% used a
sequential protocol.33 The reliance on physician judgment decreases
the likelihood of full adherence to testing guidelines. An estimate of
adherence in academic centers can be inferred by reviewing the
conduct of the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium’s prospective
multi-institutional study of genomic profiling. A total of 1536 pa-
tients with adenocarcinoma and a good performance status were
enrolled in the study; however, only 1102 were eligible for genomic
testing. The primary reason for ineligibility was the lack of tumor
tissue for genomic testing. Of the 1017 patients with confirmed
adenocarcinoma, 1007 had tumors with � 1 gene studied for
genomic changes (99% of eligible patients but only 65% of enrolled
patients), and 733 had tumors fully genotyped for all 7 NCCN
recommended alterations (72%; but only 48% of enrolled pa-
tients).34 Similarly, a tertiary academic center in Canada performing
reflex testing of EGFR and ALK had rates of 58% and 40%,
respectively.28 The primary challenge was, again, insufficiency of
tissue after histopathologic examination and staining. Only 13% of
medical oncologists had biomarker test results available at the first

 visit. This led to missed opportunities for 19% of the patients, who
started first-line chemotherapy before the biomarker results were
available.28 Thus, even at academic centers participating in pro-
spective studies of genomic profiling, a sizable population of pa-
tients will not receive the guideline-recommended molecular
analysis.
The increasing number of potential targetable alterations in
NSCLC also presents additional clinical and logistic challenges to
models of sequential gene-by-gene testing. To obtain all 7 NCCN
targetable mutations testing requires multiple modalities, including
immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-based tests,
capillary sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization-based testing,
and mass spectrometry-based sizing assays. Insufficient tissue to
supply all these tests, therefore, becomes a recurring problem. In our
series, 23 patients underwent a second biopsy to obtain additional
material to test for EGFR and ALK mutations before first-line ther-
apy, and in the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium study, insuffi-
cient tissue was the leading cause of ineligibility.34 The deployment of
multiplex testing using NGS, which requires less tissue, has begun to
address this issue. However, repeat biopsy might still be necessary,
adding additional costs (mean Medicare cost of $14,634 but
increasing to $37,745 if complicated) and the potential for compli-
cations.35 Three recent series of NSCLC patients at academic centers
where tissue-based NGS is standard practice each reported tissue
insufficiency (quantity not sufficient) rates of � 50%.36-38
Of the 335 patients in our series who did not undergo genomic
profiling, 22 (7%) died within 30 days of their lung cancer diag-
nosis. Frail patients might not be able to undergo biopsy or wait for
extended periods for genomic test results. The median response
time from diagnosis to the receipt of results was 23 days in our
series. The delays in obtaining results can be exacerbated by the
Medicare 14-day rule, which encourages delayed ordering of
expensive testing until 2 weeks after hospital discharge.32 The use of
either liquid biopsy or performing sequential testing with inex-
pensive rapid immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridi-
zation technology for EGFR/ALK, followed by comprehensive
molecular profiling, can be considered to enable more rapid
response times for the results. However, only 7% of the patients in
our series who underwent comprehensive NGS testing, with its
longer response time, underwent dual-level testing.
In the present “real world” series, patients with a targetable
mutation who received the matched targeted therapy (principally for

 EGFR mutations) experienced superior overall survival durations
approaching 32 months compared with patients with or without
mutations who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (median survival,
12-15 months). The clinical utility of genomic profiling justifies
adherence to testing guidelines. In addition to the improved survival
with targeted therapy among patients with alterations of EGFR,
ALK, and ROS1, other studies have suggested benefits with targeted
therapies against BRAF, RET, MET, and ERBB2 (HER2). Large
national trials are attempting to confirm the benefits of broad
molecular profiling with comprehensive genotyping.39-41 An Israeli
review of 101 NSCLC patients tested by hybrid capture NGS,
principally after negative EGFR/ALK test results, identified clinically
actionable genomic alterations in 50% of patients and changed the
treatment strategies for 43 patients. NGS also identified EGFR
mutations in 15 patients identified as EGFR wild type using con-
ventional testing. The overall response rate in these patients was
65% (complete response, 14.7%; partial response, 50%), support-
ing the use of NGS instead of 1-gene-at-a time testing.42 Notably,
in 19 of the 101 NSCLC patients, the tissue for NGS was insuf-
ficient, and comprehensive cell-free DNA testing of plasma found
targetable alterations, which changed the treatment for 6 of the 19
patients (32%). Objective responses were obtained for plasma-
detected genomic targets in 50% (including 2 patients with
EGFR mutations missed using local quantitative polymerase chain
reaction tissue testing) and stable disease in 33%.42
NGS of cell-free circulating solid tumor DNA, commonly
known as “liquid biopsy,” could help rescue patients who cannot
receive genotype testing because of insufficient tissue or tissue
sampling error related to tumor heterogeneity.43-46 This method of
massively parallel and deep sequencing, both enables assessment of a
comprehensive genomic profile from a simple blood sample and
reduces the need for repeat invasive tissue biopsies.47 The response
rates based on cell-free DNA-detected mutations might be similar to
those reported by tissue biopsy-based studies.37,38,42,48
The higher costs associated with the genomic diagnostic testing
(upward of $4000 per sample) might deter adherence to guideline
evaluations. However, if a genomic driver is identified, not only
might the outcomes be improved, but also the total cost of cancer
care might be reduced. The treatment costs for matched therapies
such as erlotinib for EGFR mutations have been associated with
much lower total health care costs than chemotherapy plus biologic
agents such as bevacizumab, for both first- and second-line ther-
apy.49 Ambulatory infusion, the high costs of biologic agents, and
hospitalization related to neutropenia from chemotherapy were
among the drivers of the greater costs with chemotherapy. Immu-
notherapy costs might be even greater, and consideration of tumor
genomic status is important, because patients with NSCLC with
EGFR mutations might have poor responses to immunotherapy.6
Current molecularly targeted therapies are not curative, and most
patients will experience disease progression within 1 to 2 years.
Newer targeted therapies designed to combat acquired mutations
have been released, and the NCCN and European Society for
Medical Oncology guidelines now recommend repeat genomic
testing at progression to identify EGFR- and ALK-resistance tar-
gets.21,23 In our series, which largely predated these agents, repeat
biopsies at progression during matched therapy were uncommon.
Liquid biopsy approaches to detect acquired mutations or for
identification of targets missed during the initial evaluation could be
useful in this secondary resistance setting.50-52 In our series, 9 pa-
tients, including 6 patients receiving matched therapies for EGFR
driver mutations, underwent liquid biopsy testing on progression.
Targetable clonal EGFR T790M mutations were detected in 3 of
the EGFR patients (50%), avoiding the need for repeat tissue bi-
opsies. All 3 were treated with osimertinib, and 2 had a brief

Conclusion
The present retrospective “real world evidence” review has
demonstrated that genomic testing presents multiple clinical and
logistical challenges for community-based oncologists.53 These
challenges include insufficient tissue owing to sequential or parallel
testing and unacceptably long response times. The lack of integra-
tion of biomarker testing into routine pathology practice and un-
certainty about reimbursement create additional barriers. Solutions
might include new technologies such as “liquid” biopsies (useful
when the initial tissue biopsy is insufficient for genotyping or to
detect acquired mutations at disease progression). Although gaps in
genomic biomarker testing remain, opportunities for improvement
in guideline adherence exist.
Clinical Practice Points
� Patients with advanced NSCLC (nonsquamous histologic types)
might harbor genomic alterations that are amenable to matched
targeted therapies.
� The CAP/IASLC/AMP guidelines have recommended routine
testing for EGFR and ALK alterations, and the 2014 NCCN
NSCLC guidelines added broad molecular profiling for 5 addi-
tional mutations.
� However, the demands for tissue specimens for histopathologic
diagnosis and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression staining
might leave little tissue remaining for genomic testing.
� In the present 3-year study (2013-2015) of a large community-
based oncology network consisting of multiple sites, we
measured the genotyping rates.
� More than one third of patients were not tested for EGFR and
ALK, and the testing rate for all 7 genes was only 8%.
� Among those not tested for EGFR and ALK, 52% received
chemotherapy without documented reasons for not testing, 32%
did not receive antineoplastic therapy, and 13% had insufficient
tissue.
� Under genotyping has significant implications because the overall
survival rates were significantly improved with matched therapies
compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy in the present real world
series.
� Because the clinical outcomes are improved and the total cost of
care might be lessened with targeted therapies, efforts to increase
adherence with guideline recommended genomic profiling
should be encouraged.
� New strategies, including tissue-based NGS, to improve efficient
testing of multiple targets and plasma-based cell-free circulating
tumor DNA NGS to obviate the need for repeat invasive tissue
biopsies when the initial samples have been exhausted by path-
ologic examination or to avoid repeating biopsies at progression
should be considered.
