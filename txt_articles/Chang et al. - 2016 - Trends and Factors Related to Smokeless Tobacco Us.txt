Introduction
As US smoking prevalence rates have declined, the promotion and 
consumption of alternative tobacco products, such as smokeless 
tobacco (SLT) and e-cigarettes, has been increasing.1,2 While the use 
of SLT was shown to be declining prior to the year 2002,3,4 total 
SLT sales have been increasing in recent years,2,5,6 likely influenced 
by the increase in the free nicotine content of SLT7 and the introduc-
tion of new forms and delivery systems.8 In particular, use of moist 
snuff, including snus, currently the largest share of the US market 
(85.6% in 2011),2 has been increasing since the 1980s. The use of 
both SLT and cigarettes has been observed in states with weak and 
strong tobacco control policies. For example, over 10% of smokers

Abstract
Background: While declines in smoking prevalence in the United States have been well docu-
mented, trends in smokeless tobacco (SLT) use are less clear. 
This study updates previous analyses 
of US SLT use prevalence to better understand trends and factors related to SLT use.
Methods: We used the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) to 
examine trends and factors related to SLT use using joinpoint and logistic regression models. SLT 
consumption from 1985 to 2011 was obtained from the 2011 Federal 
Trade Commission Smokeless 
Tobacco Report. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for assessing the impact of varying fre-
quency definitions of SLT use.
Results: Decreasing trends in smoking and SLT prevalence overall were observed from 1992 to 
2003 independently of use definition. SLT prevalence in the total adult population significantly 
decreased at an annual percent change (APC) of 4.5% per year from 1992 to 2003, but has been 
approximately constant ever since. Similar patterns were also found in adult males (APC = −4.4%) 
and young males (APC = −9.5%). SLT per capita consumption decreased significantly from 1991 
to 1999 (APC = −2.2%), but has since decreased at only 0.35% per year (1999–2011). SLT use was 
found to be associated with former smoker status, younger age, white race, living in rural areas, 
residence in the South, lower education and unemployment, adjusting for other factors.
Conclusions: Declines in SLT use were found in the United States, suggesting tobacco control has 
had positive impacts, but these have slowed since 2003. Targeting tobacco control policies to at-
risk demographic groups is needed to further reduce SLT use in the United States.
Implications: This study confirms that the declines in SLT use prevalence stopped in 2003 across 
different demographic groups, consistent with trends in SLT consumption. In addition, the longer 
period of analysis in comparison with earlier studies allows for quantitative characterization of SLT 
use trends using joinpoint regression. 
The study also shows the impact of different SLT use defini-
tions in determining tobacco product use prevalence and trends.
 also use SLT in states such as Minnesota and Wyoming,9 with sub-
stantial recent increases in dual-use in Minnesota between 2007 
and 201010 despite strong anti-tobacco policies. This high level of 
use could represent a substitution of SLT use for cigarettes in places 
where smoking is prohibited, which may reduce harm by reducing 
smoking intensity, but could instead represent an increase in tobacco 
consumption among smokers.
Smokers generally view SLT as a less harmful alternative to ciga-
rettes11; however, SLT may be used alone or with cigarettes. When 
used alone, SLT has been independently linked to major health 
risks, although these could vary depending on the product types. 
For instance, the levels of tobacco specific nitrosamine (TSNAs), 
which are established carcinogens, vary among different products.12 
Harmful effects include oral and esophageal cancer,12,13 stomach 
cancer,14 pancreatic cancer,15,16 and cardiovascular diseases.17–20 
Although less is known about the health effects of SLT when used 
jointly with cigarettes,21 dual use may lead to additional harmful 
effects by deterring smoking cessation. For instance, smokers may 
use these products as an alternative source of nicotine when they are 
not permitted to smoke, for example, due to clean air laws6,9,10,22–25 
or may use these products as nicotine replacements when they are 
attempting to quit. Both of these circumstances have important 
implications for tobacco control. Thus, continued monitoring to 
understand trends in SLT product use is critical to inform national 
efforts to reduce the overall public health harms of tobacco.26
In understanding the public health impact of SLT use, as well as 
for other nicotine delivery products, such as e-cigarettes, it will be 
important to develop measures of use that can inform the transitions 
to sole and dual use of cigarettes.27 Unfortunately, the definition of 
SLT use has been inconsistent across national tobacco use surveys, 
making the characterization of prevalence trends challenging.3,28 
In particular, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the 
National Survey on Drug Use & Health (NSDHS), and the Tobacco 
Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS), col-
lect information on SLT use differently.3,29 The NHIS defines current 
SLT use as every day or some days use of a SLT product.30,31 The 
NSDHS defines current SLT use as past 30-days use of a SLT prod-
uct.27 Here, we explore patterns of SLT use under different defini-
tions using the TUS-CPS survey. One of the goals of this study is to 
assess the sensitivity of SLT use trend estimates to the use definition.
Previously, Mumford et al.3 and Nelson et al.4 have described 
trends in SLT use under different definitions from the 1980s to 2000. 
In this article, we update these analyses with three additional waves 
from the TUS-CPS from 2003 to 2011, focusing on the relationship 
of SLT use and smoking prevalence. We also consider the relation-
ship of SLT use to tobacco sales using data from the Federal Trade 
Commission Smokeless Tobacco Report. Currently, there is limited 
literature on the burden and determinants of SLT use in the United 
States. In addition to investigating the time trends of SLT use, we 
also examine the factors associated with SLT prevalence in the 
United States.
Methods
SLT Data
We used data from nine waves of the TUS-CPS, a series of nation-
ally representative cross-sectional surveys: 1992/93, 1995/96, 1998, 
1999, 2000, 2001/02, 2003, 2007, and 2010/11. The TUS-CPS col-
lects national and state level representative data on tobacco use 
in the US household population.32 The survey includes a civilian, 
non-institutionalized population of age 15 years or older. Primary 
data collection was conducted by telephone interviews, but about 
30% of interviews were conducted in-person in the household. In 
this study, we restricted the sample to self-respondents of age 18 
or older.
In addition to prevalence analysis, we analyzed trends in SLT 
consumption from 1985 to 2011 using data from the 2011 Federal 
Trade Commission Smokeless Tobacco Report33 to examine if the 
trends in sales reflect the prevalence trends. SLT consumption per 
capita is calculated by dividing all SLT sales in pounds (in a particu-
lar year) by the corresponding total US population.
SLT and Cigarette Use Measures
Prevalence of SLT use was calculated using aggregates of monthly 
samples for each survey wave. The wording of SLT use questions in 
TUS-CPS varies over time. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the 
definitions of current use of SLT in TUS-CPS by survey year. For 
1992/93 and 1995/96 surveys, current SLT use was defined as those 
reporting ever using SLT on a “regular basis” and answering “yes” 
to the current use question. Because the screening questions changed 
(removal of “on regular basis”), the baseline measure of current use 
for 1998 to 2010/11 surveys was defined as those reporting having 
ever used, responding “yes” to every day or some days current use, 
and reporting using SLT products at least 10 out of the past 30 days 
(as a criteria for “regular use”). We also explored the sensitivity of 
our results to varying measures of SLT use based on frequency from 
1998 to 2010/11 (1, 20 and 25 days out of the past 30 days), and 
compared the SLT consumption per capita data with different defini-
tions of SLT use.
Current cigarette smokers were defined as those who reported 
ever smoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, and report-
ing smoking every day or some days at the time of the survey. Current 
smokers were also distinguished by those reporting smoking every 
day versus some days, and those reporting quitting attempts within 
the past year. Former smokers were defined as those who reported 
ever smoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, and did not 
smoke at the time of the survey. Consistently with Mumford et al.,3 
dual users were defined as those who are simultaneously classified as 
current smokers and current SLT users according to the definitions 
above, the later assuming the 10-day metric.
Demographic Classifications
We categorized age into seven groups: 18–24 years, 25–34 years, 
35–44 years, 45–54 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and 75 years 
and older. Due to a low sample size for non-white racial/ethnic 
groups, race/ethnicity was collapsed into a dichotomous variable, 
white and Other race. Region was categorized into four categories: 
Northeast, Midwest, South and West. Education level was grouped 
into four categories: less than a high school degree, a high school 
degree or equivalent, some college, and at least a 4-year college 
degree. Household income was grouped into four categories: less 
than $14 999, $15 000–$34 999, $35 000–$74 999, and $75 000 
or more. Residence was defined by the CPS’s use of Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas (MSAs), which divides major metropolitan and 
rural areas.
Statistical Analyses
Prevalence was estimated using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), 
applying sample weights and the PROC SURVEY procedures, which 
Nicotine & 
Tobacco Research, 2016, Vol. 18, No. 8
1741
 allow for adjustment of survey design. Trends in cigarette smoking, 
SLT use, and dual use prevalence (using both cigarette and SLT prod-
ucts) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for different demographic 
groups were calculated. To characterize trends in SLT prevalence, 
frequency (number of days used during the last 30 days), and SLT 
consumption, we performed joinpoint regression analyses using the 
statistical software Joinpoint, version 4.1.5 (Surveillance Research 
Program, US National Cancer Institute). Joinpoint regression identi-
fies statistically significant trend change points and the annual per-
cent change (APC) in each significant trend segment.34 Because SLT 
prevalence among females is low (less than 0.05% each year), exam-
ining the distribution of female SLT use by demographic character-
istics yields unstable estimates; therefore, estimations were confined 
to adult males only.
Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential 
demographic factors associated with SLT use. Only potential varia-
bles with a P value of less than .05 in univariate models were retained 
in the final multivariable logistic regression model. For the multi-
variate analyses, we categorized age into four groups: 18–24 years, 
25–44 years, 45–64 years, and ≥65 years. The Cochran-Armitage 
trend test was performed to test for trends in age, education and 
income. For this analysis, odds ratios (ORs) with their correspond-
ing 95% CIs are reported. Regression analyses were performed in 
SAS 9.3 using the PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure.
Results
Trends in 
Tobacco Use
Tobacco use prevalence for the total population, adult males and 
females (ages 18 and older), and males ages 18–24 is presented in 
Table 1. Smoking prevalence significantly decreased for adult males 
with APC rate of 2.7% per year (1998–2011) and for adult females 
with APC rate of 2.5% per year (1992–2011). For males ages 18–24, 
smoking prevalence remained approximately constant (nonstatisti-
cally significant increase of 0.6% per year) from 1992 to 2000 and 
then decreased at 4.1% per year from 2000 to 2011. Declines in 
overall SLT prevalence from 1992 to 2003 were observed assum-
ing our baseline SLT use definition (frequency of at least 10 of the 
past 30 days) from 1998 to 2011. Total adult SLT use significantly 
decreased at an APC rate of 4.5% per year from 1992 to 2003. The 
SLT use prevalence has remained approximately constant since 2003 
(nonstatistically different from zero). Similar patterns were also 
found in adult males (APC = −4.4%, 1992–2003) and males age 
18–24 (APC = −9.5%, 1992–2003).
The dual use of SLT and smoking also declined. Dual use by 
adult males declined 5.3% per year, and by adult females decreased 
at about 8.4% per year throughout the period of analysis.
SLT Use by Demographic Groups
Table 2 shows SLT prevalence and trends among adult males by 
age, race, residence, education and current smoking frequency. Age-
specific SLT prevalence is the highest for males ages 18–24 in early 
years (1992 and 1995 surveys), but the peak shifted to older ages 
since 1998 (highest for ages 25–34 from 1998 to 2003 and for ages 
35–44 in 2007 and 2010/11). This shift may reflect trends in use 
by birth-cohort, with lower overall consumption of tobacco prod-
ucts in more recent cohorts. The SLT prevalence is highest among 
whites, those living in rural areas, those with lower education, and 
non-daily smokers across all survey years. The youngest age group 
(18–24) had the greatest decline in SLT prevalence from 1992 to 
2003 (APC = −9.5%) compared with other age groups; however, 
the decrease in this and other groups stopped in 2003. Among race/
ethnicity, males of other races had a larger decline in prevalence than 
whites (APCs = −10.6% vs −3.9%, respectively), although their rate 
decrease stopped earlier. Supplementary Table 2 shows the addi-
tional demographic characteristics of SLT use. Among income cat-
egories, those earning less than $14 999 per year had the largest 
significant decline in SLT prevalence compared with other groups 
(APC = −6.3%), although the decrease stopped in 1993. Among 
region, SLT prevalence decreased in all regions, with those living 
in the South having the largest significant declines in SLT preva-
lence (APC = −5.6%, 1992–2003) compared with other regions. 
Former and never smokers had also significant declines in SLT use 
(APCs = −2.4%, 1992–2011 and −5.2%, 1992–2003, respectively).
SLT Consumption in the United States
Trends in SLT consumption per capita from 1985 to 2011 are pre-
sented in Figure 1a. From 1985 to 1988, there was a significant 
3.04% APC decrease per year in SLT consumption per capita. SLT 
consumption significantly decreased at 2.24% APC from 1991 to 
1999, but has since decreased at 0.35% APC (1999–2011).
Frequency of SLT Use
Starting in 1998, respondents were asked about their frequency of 
SLT use if they reported current use of SLT products every day or 
some days. Following Mumford et al., we defined, as our baseline 
metric, current regular users of SLT products as those reporting 
a frequency of at least 10 of the past 30 days. Among those, the 
average frequency of SLT use (number of days used during the past 
30 days) did not vary in total adults, adult males and adult females, 
throughout the survey years (Table 1). Otherwise, the average fre-
quency of SLT use declined in young males by about 1.7% per year 
from 1998 to 2002.
We also examined different thresholds for defining frequency of 
SLT use (at least 1 day, 20 days or 25 days of the past 30 days). 
Figure 1b shows the trends of different SLT prevalence assum-
ing different frequency use thresholds (1-day, 10-day, 20-day, and 
25-day) in adult males. Prevalence for all demographic groups for all 
definitions is shown in the appendix (Supplementary Table 3). The 
1-day measure leads to 12%–20% (about 17% on average) higher 
SLT prevalence relative to the baseline (10-day) measure. However, 
the 1-day definition shows a uniform decline over time, while the 
10-day, 20-day and 25-day show that independently of the defini-
tion; SLT prevalence decreased until 2003 and has been roughly 
constant since 2003. While the 10-, the 20-, and 25-day measures 
show similar patterns, the 10-day definition shows a less pronounced 
decline. We compared the SLT consumption per capita (Figure 1a) 
with the prevalence of SLT across definitions (Figure 1b), and con-
sistent with previous results by Mumford et al., the SLT use trends, 
using the 10-day metric, more closely mirror the SLT consumption 
per capita compared with other definitions.
Factors Associated With SLT Use
Due to low SLT prevalence among females, we only included males in 
the logistic regression analyses. In univariate analyses (Table 3), the 
likelihood of use of SLT decreases with increasing age (Ptrend < .0001). 
The likelihood of SLT use decreases with advancing education (Ptrend 
< .0001). People who live in the non-MSA areas (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 
3.0–3.4) are more likely to use SLT, residents of the South (OR = 2.8,

 95% CI: 2.5–3.1), former smokers are likely to use SLT compared to 
never smokers, with an unadjusted OR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6–1.9). In 
a multivariable logistic regression model, ages 25 to 44 (OR = 1.3, 
95% CI: 1.1–1.5), white race (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.7–3.8), living 
in a non-MSA area (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.4–2.8), unemployment 
(OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7), lower education, for example, those 
with a high school degree or equivalent (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–
1.6), and being a former smoker (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.8–2.2) were 
associated with SLT use after adjusting for other factors.
Discussion
We examined trends in SLT and cigarette smoking use in the United 
States over a 20-year period using nine cross-sectional, nationally 
representative surveys. For US adults, significant declines in SLT 
prevalence for both genders were observed, particularly in males 
of ages 18 to 24 years old with a decrease of 9.5% per year from 
1992 to 2003. However, we found that the decreases in SLT preva-
lence in most groups stopped since 2003. In contrast, the frequency 
of SLT use among current users remained approximately constant 
throughout the period of analysis at an average of 26 out of the past 
30 days. Consistent with prevalence trends, SLT per capita consump-
tion declined at a constant rate until 1999, but there was a significant 
reduction in the rates (APC) since 1999. In contrast, smoking preva-
lence showed a greater decline since 1998 than prior to that year. 
The information about SLT use in the TUS-CPS surveys has changed 
over time. In particular, the screening SLT use question was relaxed 
from “regular use” prior to 1998 to “at least one time” in more 
recent years (Supplementary Table 1), which may artificially increase 
the prevalence estimates for recent years relative to earlier years by 
omitting non-regular users who would have answered yes to ever 
use. To address this limitation, following the approach by Mumford 
et al.,3 we constructed different measures of SLT prevalence based 
on the reported use frequency, information that has been collected 
since 1998. Previous analysis of SLT3 and recent analyses of e-ciga-
rettes by Amato et al.27 demonstrate the importance of accounting 
for use frequency when estimating tobacco products use prevalence. 
Here, we found that although the absolute prevalence estimates 
vary across definitions, with lower prevalence for higher frequency 
requirements (Figure 1b), the estimated male SLT prevalence trends 
show a consistent pattern of decline until 2003 and stability through 
2010 (Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 3). The 20- and 25-day meas-
ures also show a flattening trend since 2003, but more rapid decline 
over 1992–2003 compared to the 10-day measure, suggesting that 
the 20- and 25-day measures are more sensitive metrics of changes 
in trend.28 The results also differ somewhat for male ages 18 to 24 
compared with adult males, suggesting greater sensitivity to secular 
trends. Similarly to Amato et al.,27 we found that any past 30-day use 
does not necessarily detect changes in use trends.
Younger age, white race, unemployment, residents of the South, 
residents of rural areas lower education and former smoker status 
were found to be associated with SLT use. Those reporting less than 
12 years of education were twice as likely to use SLT in comparison 
with those with at least a college degree. White males were nearly 
3 times more likely to use SLT compared with those who are other 
races, thus showing the importance of race and SES. These findings 
are consistent with recent results by Bhattacharyya et al.,35 whose 
analyses found that whites are 2.5 times higher for active snuff 
use and 2.2 times higher for active chewing tobacco use, as well as 
with the earlier analyses of TUS-CPS data from 1992 to 2002 by 
Mumford et al.3
The Healthy People 2020 target36 is to reduce SLT prevalence for 
U.S adults to 0.3% or below. However, current prevalence is about 
1.3% and at current trends, the target will likely not be achieved.

 The change in the decreasing trend of SLT use since 2003 may be 
partly attributable to the changing SLT landscape, with the intro-
duction of new alternative nicotine delivery products in recent years, 
like snus37,38 and electronic cigarettes, which have reenergized the 
market, and the increasing influence of products with flavoring and 
portion pouch packaging.39,40 Previous studies have found impor-
tant reductions in chewing tobacco sales, which may explain the 
decreases observed in SLT prevalence prior to 2003.39,41 In contrast, 
the promotion of moist snuff, snus and dissolvable tobacco, with 
“spit-free” formulations, may be responsible for the trend changes 
in SLT use.37 In addition, data from the CDC state system42 shows 
that cigarette taxes increased in many states from 2003 to 2010, 
while SLT taxes changed in fewer states and often by small amounts, 
which may explain the relative increase in SLT use compared to 
cigarettes (ie, the flattening in trend in SLT use while cigarette use 
declined more rapidly than in prior years).
Understanding the relative impacts of different products in shap-
ing SLT consumption is needed. It is thus important to conduct stud-
ies of SLT use distinguishing by product category and use patterns, 
although the constant changes in the market and product category 
distribution, as well as changes in survey questions, make these 
studies challenging. Preliminary results (data not shown) using TUS-
CPS suggest a progressive replacement of chewing tobacco by snus 
and new forms of SLT.
A strength of our study is having access to detailed tobacco 
use data from nationally representative surveys, which allows for 
quantitative joinpoint analyses of SLT use trends for the past two 
decades in relevant demographic groups. In addition, we examined 
SLT use trends and SLT consumption, allowing for comparisons 
between self-reported data and market sales. We were able to go 
beyond recent studies3,30 to examine trends in SLT use since 2003, 
and how patterns varied depending on the measure of use (number 
of days used in the past 30 days) and the sociodemographic group. 
Nonetheless, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to 
the following limitations.
First, while the TUS-CPS is a nationally representative survey, all 
information is self-reported, which may lead to underestimation of 
the true prevalence. Second, the survey data is cross-sectional, mak-
ing it difficult to assess trends in initiation and cessation rates of 
SLT use. Third, the changes across survey years of SLT use defini-
tions may have introduced bias, in particular going from the regular 
use to ever use screening question. Nevertheless, as discussed, we

 use information on frequency to attempt to increase the current use 
definition across years, and sensitivity analyses show that our gen-
eral conclusions are consistent across alternative SLT use definitions. 
Lastly, tobacco companies have continued to introduce new SLT 
products on the market, making the interpretation of trends difficult 
given the variability in available products each year.
In sum, we report a significant declining trend in SLT product use 
from 1992 to 2003, suggesting the impact of tobacco control poli-
cies in reducing tobacco consumption. However, the decline ended in 
2003 for SLT prevalence and ended in 1999 for per capita, highlight-
ing the need for additional tobacco control efforts focusing on alter-
native tobacco products. These results are consistent with a recent 
analysis by Nguyen et al.43 that shows little change in SLT prevalence 
between 2011 and 2013 in most states, and increases in prevalence 
in some states such as Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, and 
West Virginia. With the Healthy People 2020 goal, extra efforts are 
necessary in the next 5 years to achieve the 0.3% target. Focusing 
tobacco control efforts, particularly targeting at-risk demographic 
groups, is needed to further reduce SLT consumption in the United 
States. Little is known about whether the increasing use of e-ciga-
rettes44,45 and the potential use of snus will impact future SLT trends. 
E-cigarettes may replace SLT use, especially snus, if it is viewed as a 
better harm reduction alternative. Continued monitoring of SLT use 
and its relationship to e-cigarette use is needed.
