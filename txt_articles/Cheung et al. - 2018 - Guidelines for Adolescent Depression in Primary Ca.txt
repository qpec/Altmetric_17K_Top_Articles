OBJECTIVES: To update clinical practice guidelines to assist primary care 
(PC) in the screening and assessment of depression. In this second part of 
the updated guidelines, we address treatment and ongoing management of 
adolescent depression in the PC setting.
METHODS: By using a combination of evidence- and consensus-based 
methodologies, the guidelines were updated in 2 phases as informed by (1) 
current scientific evidence (published and unpublished) and (2) revision and 
iteration among the steering committee, including youth and families with 
lived experience.
RESULTS: These updated guidelines are targeted for youth aged 10 to 21 years 
and offer recommendations for the management of adolescent depression in 
PC, including (1) active monitoring of mildly depressed youth, (2) treatment 
with evidence-based medication and psychotherapeutic approaches in cases 
of moderate and/or severe depression, (3) close monitoring of side effects, 
(4) consultation and comanagement of care with mental health specialists, 
(5) ongoing tracking of outcomes, and (6) specific steps to be taken in 
instances of partial or no improvement after an initial treatment has begun. 
The strength of each recommendation and the grade of its evidence base are 
summarized.
CONCLUSIONS: The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care 
cannot replace clinical judgment, and they should not be the sole source 
of guidance for adolescent depression management. Nonetheless, the 
guidelines may assist PC clinicians in the management of depressed 
adolescents in an era of great clinical need and a shortage of mental health 
specialists. Additional research concerning the management of depressed 
youth in PC is needed, including the usability, feasibility, and sustainability of 
guidelines, and determination of the extent to which the guidelines actually 
improve outcomes of depressed youth.

Studies have revealed that up to 
9% of teenagers meet criteria for 
depression at any one time, with as 
many as 1 in 5 teenagers having a 
history of depression at some point 
during adolescence.1 
– 
7 In primary 
care (PC) settings, point prevalence 
rates are likely higher, with rates 
up to 28%.8 
– 
12 Taken together, in 
epidemiologic and PC-specific studies 
it is suggested that despite relatively 
high rates, major depressive disorder 
(MDD) in youth is underidentified 
and undertreated in PC settings.13, 
 
14
Because adolescents face barriers 
to receive specialty mental health 
services, only a small percentage of 
depressed adolescents are treated 
by mental health professionals.15 As 
a result, PC settings have become 
the de facto mental health clinics for 
this population, although most PC 
clinicians feel inadequately trained, 
supported, or reimbursed for the 
management of depression.14 
– 
21 
Although MDD management 
guidelines have been developed 
for specialty care settings (eg, the 
American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry22) or related 
problems such as suicidal ideation or 
attempts, 
23 it is clear that significant 
practice and clinician differences 
exist between the primary and 
specialty care settings that do not 
allow a simple transfer of guidelines 
from one setting to another.
Recognizing this gap in clinical 
guidance for PC providers, in 2007, 
a group of researchers and clinical 
experts from the United States and 
Canada established Guidelines for 
Adolescent Depression in Primary 
Care (GLAD-PC), a North American 
collaborative, to develop guidelines 
for the management of adolescent 
depression in the PC setting. The 
development process of GLAD-PC 
is described in detail in Part I of the 
original GLAD-PC articles.24, 
 
25  
In this article, we describe the 
updated recommendations regarding 
treatment, ongoing management, and 
follow-up, along with the supporting 
empirical evidence for these 
recommendations. In our companion 
article, we provide a detailed 
description of the update process as 
well as the corresponding updated 
recommendations for GLAD-PC 
regarding practice preparation, 
depression identification, 
assessment, and diagnosis, and 
initial management before formal 
treatment.
METhODS
A full description of the methodology 
used for the update of GLAD-PC is 
included in our companion article. 
In brief, the expert collaborative 
used a mix of qualitative (expert 
consensus) and quantitative 
(literature reviews) methods to 
inform the update of GLAD-PC. In 
view of space limitations, only the 
methods and results of the updated 
literature reviews regarding available 
evidence for treatment and ongoing 
management are presented in this 
article.
The following 3 literature reviews 
were conducted for the updated 
GLAD-PC recommendations: 
(1) nonspecific psychosocial 
interventions in pediatric PC, 
including studies pertaining to 
integrated behavioral health and 
collaborative care models; (2) 
antidepressant treatment; and (3) 
psychotherapy interventions.
For the first review, we searched 
the literature (PubMed, PsycInfo, 
and the Cochrane Database) for 
articles published from 2005 to 
the present in which researchers 
examined evidence for psychosocial 
interventions delivered in the PC 
setting to update the previous 
review conducted by Stein et al.26 
The “related articles” function was 
used to search for articles similar to 
Asarnow et al14 and Richardson et al.27  
In addition, reference lists of all 
relevant articles were also examined 
for other relevant studies.
In the second updated review, we 
examined the efficacy and safety 
of antidepressant medications in 
the pediatric population (under the 
age of 18 years). This review was 
used to update the findings from the 
US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) safety report28 and the 
previously published GLAD-PC 
review on antidepressants in 
youth depression.29 Studies in 
which researchers examined the 
management of depression with 
the use of antidepressants as both 
monotherapy and combination 
therapy were included.
In the third review, we searched 
the literature for depression trials 
in which researchers examined 
the efficacy of psychotherapy for 
the management of depression in 
children and adolescents. The search 
included all forms of psychotherapy, 
including both individual and 
group-based therapies. We not only 
identified both individual studies but 
also high-quality systematic reviews, 
given the extensive empirical 
literature in this area. In both the 
second and third reviews, the 
literature searches were conducted 
by using Medline and PsycInfo to 
find studies published between 2005 
to the present. To ensure additional 
articles were not missed, reference 
lists of included articles were hand-
searched for other relevant studies. 
A full description of the 3 reviews is 
available on request.
RESULTS
Organizational Adoption of 
Integrative Care
Within the past decade, there 
has been a shift in medicine and 
in mental health away from the 
“traditional” model of autonomous 
individual providers and toward 
delivering empirically supported 
interventions in a team-based 
manner. This followed a growing 
recognition that complex chronic 
conditions, such as depression, 
FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

Downloaded from 
 are more successfully managed 
with proactive, multidisciplinary 
patient-centered care teams. 
Ongoing changes in the health 
care landscape helped to solidify 
support for this revolution. Systems 
are enacting top-down changes 
designed to make the entire delivery 
system (organizations, clinics, and 
providers) more effective, efficient, 
safe, and satisfying to both patients 
and providers.
Proposed integrated care models 
include “chronic care management, 
”  
“integrated behavioral health  
care, 
” “collaborative care, 
” and 
“medical home.” Here, the term 
“integrative care” will be used to 
collectively refer to models such as 
these. These complex care models 
share multiple features, such as 
an emphasis on systematically 
identifying and tracking target 
populations, multidisciplinary 
patient care, structured protocols 
for symptom management, regular 
follow-ups, decreasing fragmentation 
across the care team, and enhancing 
the patient’s ability to self-manage 
their condition.30 The following list 
represents many of the components 
described in 1 or more of these 
health care models:
1. a treatment team that includes the 
patient, the family, and access to 
mental health expertise;
2. education (including decision 
tools) for PC providers, patients, 
and family;
3. tools and/or procedures to 
systematically identify, assess, 
and diagnose patients who are at 
risk or are currently experiencing 
depressive symptoms;
4. a care plan for target patients 
(which may involve the family 
when possible and includes 
resources at other agencies or in 
the community);
5. improved communication and 
coordination of care across 
providers and/or between patient, 
family, and provider;
6. case management and/or patient 
and family support;
7. routine tracking of patient 
progress, with appropriate 
follow-up action as needed;
8. routine evaluation of staff 
performance metrics to inform 
ongoing quality improvement 
efforts; and
9. increased patient and family 
motivation and capacity to self-
manage symptoms, including 
education, feedback, etc.
A variety of integrative care models 
have been proposed or discussed in 
the literature, 
31, 
 
32 but few studies 
have actually been conducted to 
examine whether they ultimately 
improve care for children and 
adolescents with mental health 
disorders, broadly speaking, or 
depression, specifically. In the 
present review, only 3 randomized 
clinical trials were identified. In 
the first, Asarnow et al14 found that 
adolescents treated for depression 
at PC clinics engaging in a quality 
improvement initiative received 
higher rates of mental health care 
and psychosocial therapy, endorsed 
fewer depressive symptoms, 
reported a greater quality of life, 
and expressed greater satisfaction 
with their care than comparison 
adolescents in a usual care condition. 
In a second study, researchers 
examined the additive benefits 
of providing brief (4-session) 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for depression in conjunction 
with antidepressant medication 
compared with medication alone 
in a collaborative care practice 
with embedded care managers and 
found a weak but positive benefit 
for adjunctive CBT.33 Finally, 
Richardson et al27 randomly assigned 
adolescents to either an integrative 
care condition, in which patients 
chose from a treatment menu of 
antidepressant medication alone, 
brief CBT alone, or a combination 
of the 2, versus usual care. Results 
revealed that integrative care was 
associated with significant decreases 
in depression scores and improved 
response and remission rates at 12 
months compared with treatment 
as usual.27 The results of a cost-
effectiveness analysis of this trial 
revealed that the integrative care 
condition was more effective at 
reducing depression symptoms for 
adolescents, resulting in incremental 
cost savings given the quality of 
life years gained from improved 
functioning.34
Although research studies offer 
support for the impact of integrative 
or collaborative health care delivery 
models as a whole, 
35 multiple 
changes to the practice setting are 
being evaluated simultaneously. The 
components of integrative health 
care models have largely been 
identified through practice-based 
research36 or “best ideas” about how 
to solve identified problems, without 
a clear theoretical or empirical basis 
for these components individually or 
in combination. Thus, it is unknown 
what “active ingredients” account for 
the greatest proportion of variance 
in patient improvement because 
no dismantling studies have been 
conducted in which the relative 
impact of the individual components 
was examined. Given that integrated 
health care approaches are resource-
intensive to implement and maintain, 
it may not be feasible for many 
PC practices to fully adopt such a 
model. Some states and communities 
have attempted to implement 
“wraparound services” under the 
“systems of care model”; however, 
unfortunately, these services are 
usually restricted to severely 
impaired children with chronic 
mental health problems. Nonetheless, 
such services are available if PC 
providers are interested.37, 
 
38 
Unfortunately, there is relatively 
little information to help guide 
prioritization and decision-making 
for PC clinics that wish to improve 
patient care within the constraints

Antidepressant Treatment
The updated treatment review for 
antidepressant safety and efficacy 
included randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) of antidepressants 
in youth with depression. In this 
GLAD-PC review, we identified 
27 peer-reviewed articles in 
this area, including trials with 
fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, 
paroxetine, duloxetine, and 
venlafaxine. In addition, in 
several studies, the switch from 
a selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) to venlafaxine, a 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitor, was explored.39 
– 
41 Older 
antidepressants (ie, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants) were not included 
in our updated review because of 
several reasons. First, the 2004 
FDA review that was used for the 
development of the guidelines 
only involved newer classes of 
antidepressants. Second, older 
antidepressants are not used because 
of the lack of efficacy demonstrated 
in clinical trials data for other classes 
of older antidepressants.42
Overall, both individual clinical 
trial evidence and evidence from 
systematic reviews still support the 
use of antidepressants in adolescents 
with MDD. Bridge et al43 conducted 
a meta-analysis of the clinical trials 
data and calculated the numbers 
needed to treat and numbers needed 
to harm. They concluded that 6 times 
more teenagers would benefit from 
treatment with antidepressants than 
would be harmed.43 In reviewing the 
individual studies, the percentage 
of subjects who responded to 
antidepressants ranged from 47% 
to 69% and from 33% to 57% for 
those on placebo (see Table 1). The 
majority of these studies revealed 
a significant difference between 
those on medication versus those on 
placebo. Similarly, on the basis of the 
updated review, fluoxetine still has 
the most evidence to support its use 
in the adolescent population.44
The largest study, the Treatment 
of Adolescent Depression Study, 
involved subjects who were 
randomly assigned to receive 
placebo, CBT alone, fluoxetine alone, 
or a combination treatment of CBT 
with fluoxetine.45 Subjects assigned 
to receive combination treatment or 
fluoxetine alone showed significantly 
greater improvement in their 
depressive symptoms compared with 
those on placebo or those treated 
with CBT alone (also see subsection 
“CBT”). There is also a more rapid 
initial response when medication 
is initiated first or in combination 
with therapy.55 The superiority 
of combination therapy is also 
demonstrated in adolescents with 
anxiety.56, 
 
57 However, a few trials 
have revealed little extra benefit 
to combination therapy, but these 
findings might be confounded by 
the control therapy intervention (ie, 
routine specialist care).58 
– 
60
Combination therapy has also 
been evaluated in adolescents with 
treatment-resistant depression. 
In the Treatment of SSRI-resistant 
Depression in Adolescents study, 
researchers examined treatment 
options for adolescents aged 12 
to 18 whose depression had not 
improved after 1 adequate trial of 
an SSRI.39 
– 
41, 
 
49, 
61 
– 
63 Subjects were 
randomly assigned to 4 possible 
interventions: (1) switch to a 
different SSRI (citalopram, fluoxetine, 
paroxetine), (2) switch to a second 
SSRI in combination with CBT, (3) 
switch to venlafaxine, or (4) switch 
to venlafaxine in combination with 
CBT. Patients who received CBT 
and changed their medication to a 
second SSRI or venlafaxine had a 
higher response rate (54.8%; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 47%–62%) 
than changing the medication alone 
(40.5%; 95% CI: 33%–48%; P = .009). 
Additionally, there was no difference 
in response rate between venlafaxine 
and a second SSRI (48.2%; 95% CI: 
41%–56%; and 47%; 95% CI:  
40%–55%; P = .83) as well as no 
significant differences among 
Children’s Depression Rating Scale–
Revised improvements between 
treatment options.
Finally, with available evidence from 
RCTs, it is suggested that adverse 
effects do emerge in depressed 
youth who are treated with 
antidepressants.45 Adverse effects 
(ie, nausea, headaches, behavioral 
activation, etc) were found to occur 
in most adolescents treated with 
antidepressants, with duloxetine, 
venlafaxine, and paroxetine as the 
most intolerable.45 Therefore, routine 
monitoring of the development 
of adverse events is critical for 
depressed youth treated with 
antidepressants.
The most significant adverse effect of 
antidepressants is the emergence of

 new onset or worsening suicidality, 
which was demonstrated in the FDA 
review in 2004.29 The estimated 
risk of suicidality is 4% in those on 
medication versus 2% in those on 
placebo. However, further analyses 
of clinical trials data revealed that 
there is overall improvement in 
suicidality in subjects treated with 
antidepressants, with only a few 
subjects reporting worsening or new 
onset suicidality.49 In the FDA review, 
it was also suggested that paroxetine 
and venlafaxine have a significantly 
higher risk for suicidality 
compared with other serotonergic 
antidepressants.
The doubling of risk of suicidality 
was also confirmed in population 
level studies.63 However, studies 
have also revealed that almost all 
adolescents who die by suicide do not 
test positive for antidepressants in 
postmortem toxicology tests despite 
being prescribed these drugs.64 
Furthermore, Olfson et al65 found an 
inverse relationship between rates 
of SSRI prescriptions and rates of 
suicide in adolescent populations.
Psychotherapy
In the third review conducted, 
we examined the efficacy of 
psychotherapy, such as CBT, 
interpersonal psychotherapy for 
adolescents (IPT-A), as well as 
nonspecific interventions such as 
counseling and support. Through 
our search, we were able to identify 
both individual studies as well as 
several high-quality meta-analyses 
and/or reviews that were recently 
conducted to examine the efficacy 
of psychotherapy in adolescent 
depression.
CBT
Numerous meta-analyses and 
reviews have been conducted on 
CBT in the treatment of adolescent 
depression and showed improved 
outcomes for subjects treated with 
CBT.66 
– 
68 There are also several 
ongoing studies in which researchers 
are evaluating CBT in youth up to  
age 21.69
The effectiveness of CBT for 
adolescents with moderate to 
moderately severe depression 
was also evaluated in Treatment 
of Adolescent Depression Study, 
in which researchers randomly 
assigned 439 12- to 17-year-olds who 
were depressed to treatment with 
CBT, fluoxetine, CBT plus fluoxetine, 
or placebo.45, 
 
70 According to Clinical 
Global Impressions severity scores, 
the posttreatment response rate to 
15 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks 
(43.2%; 95% CI: 34%–52%) was not 
significantly different (P = .40) from 
placebo (34.8%; 95% CI: 26%–44%). 
The authors attributed this relatively 
low response rate, in part, to the fact 
that the study population suffered 
from more severe and chronic 
depression than participants in 
previous studies and to a high rate 
of psychiatric comorbidity in their 
study participants. Along with the 
fairly robust placebo-response rate, 
it is also possible that the nonspecific 
therapeutic aspects of the medication 
management could have successfully 
competed with the specific effects 
of the CBT intervention. As a 
consequence, one cannot and should 
not conclude that CBT is ineffective.
In another study with adolescents 
with depression, Fleming et al71 
evaluated the effectiveness of a 
computerized cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CCBT) intervention called 
SPARX in treating adolescents 
aged 13 to 16 years excluded from 
mainstream education (n = 20). 
After randomly assigning them to 
CCBT or the waitlist control, it was 
found that there were significantly 
greater reductions in Children’s 
Depression Rating Scale and 
Reynolds Adolescent Depression 
Scale scores from baseline to week 5 
for the intervention group compared 
with those who waited. In addition, 
the SPARX group was significantly 
more likely to be in remission or have 
a significant reduction in symptoms. 
In several other studies, researchers 
have evaluated CCBT interventions 
and have also found similar results, 
with 1 study conducted in the PC 
setting.72, 
 
73
IPT-A
In terms of IPT-A, only a handful of 
studies have been conducted. First, 
Tang et al74 randomly assigned 347 
adolescents who were depressed 
to receive IPT-A in schools or 
treatment as usual. IPT-A was found 
to have significantly higher effects 
on reducing severity of depression, 
suicidal ideation, and hopelessness 
compared with treatment as 
usual. In Gunlicks-Stoessel et al’s75 
study, 63 adolescents who were 
depressed were randomly assigned 
to IPT-A or treatment as usual. 
Adolescents who were depressed 
who reported higher baseline 
levels of interpersonal difficulties 
showed a greater and more rapid 
reduction in depressive symptoms 
if treated with IPT-A compared 
with treatment as usual. In the most 
recent study, 
76 57 adolescents with 
depressive symptoms were randomly 
assigned to receive either 8 weeks 
of interpersonal therapy–adolescent 
skills training or supportive school 
counseling. Adolescents who were 
treated with interpersonal therapy–
adolescent skills training showed 
significantly greater rates of change 
compared with adolescents who 
received school counseling on the 
Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (t[215] = −2.56,  
P = .01), Children’s Depression 
Rating Scale-Revised (t[169] = −3.09, 
P < .01), and the Children’s Global 
Assessment Scale (t[168] = 3.24,  
P < .01).

).
Recommendation strength based 
on expert consensus was rated 
in 4 categories: very strong 
(>90% agreement), strong (>70% 
agreement), fair (>50% agreement), 
and weak (<50% agreement). 
The recommendations in the 
guidelines were developed only in 
areas of management that had at 
least a “strong agreement” among 
experts (see Fig 1 for the treatment 
algorithm).
Treatment
Recommendation 1: PC clinicians 
should work with administration 
to organize their clinical settings 
to reflect best practices in 
integrated and/or collaborative 
care models (eg, facilitating 
contact with psychiatrists, case 
managers, embedded therapists). 
(grade of evidence: 4; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
There is a growing recognition 
that complex chronic conditions, 
such as depression, are most 
successfully managed with proactive, 
multidisciplinary, patient-centered 
care teams.77, 
 
78 Proposed integrated 
care models include chronic care 
management, integrated behavioral 
health care, collaborative care, and 
medical home. These complex care 
models have been shown to be more 
effective in improving outcomes 
and share multiple features, such 
as an emphasis on systematically 
identifying and tracking 
target populations, decreasing 
fragmentation across the care team, 
and enhancing the patient’s ability to 
self-manage their condition.
Recommendation 2: After initial 
diagnosis, in cases of mild 
depression, clinicians should 
consider a period of active 
support and monitoring before 
starting evidence-based treatment 
(grade of evidence: 3; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
After a preliminary diagnostic 
assessment, in cases of mild 
depression, clinicians should 
consider a period of active 
support and monitoring before 
recommending treatment (from 6 to 
8 weeks of weekly or biweekly visits 
for active monitoring). Evidence 
from RCTs with antidepressants and 
CBT show that a sizable percentage 
of patients respond to nondirective 
supportive therapy and regular

However, if symptoms persist, 
treatment with antidepressants 
or psychotherapy should be 
offered, whether provided by PC 
or mental health. Active support 
and monitoring is also essential in 
cases in which depressed patients 
and/or their families and/or 
caregivers refuse other treatments. 
Active support and counseling 
for adolescents by pediatric PC 
clinicians have been evaluated 
for several different disorders, 
including substance abuse and sleep 
disorders.22
Furthermore, expert opinion based 
on extensive clinical experience and 
qualitative research with families, 
patients, and clinicians indicates 
that these strategies are a crucial 
component of management by PC 
clinicians. For further guidance on 
how to provide active support, please 
refer to the GLAD-PC toolkit (http:// 
www. 
gladpc. 
org).
For moderate or severe cases, 
the clinician should recommend 
treatment; crisis intervention; patient 
and family support services, such as 
in-home or skill-building services 
(as indicated); and mental health 
consultation immediately, without a 
period of active monitoring.
Recommendation 3: If a PC clinician 
identifies an adolescent with 
moderate or severe depression 
or complicating factors and/
or conditions such as coexisting 
substance abuse or psychosis, 
consultation with a mental 
health specialist should be 
considered (grade of evidence: 
5; strength of recommendation: 
strong). Appropriate roles and 
responsibilities for ongoing 
comanagement by the PC clinician 
and mental health clinician(s) 
should be communicated and 
agreed on (grade of evidence: 
5; strength of recommendation: 
strong). The patient and family 
should be active team members 
and approve the roles of the PC 
and mental health clinicians 
(grade of evidence: 5; strength of 
recommendation: strong).
In adolescents with severe 
depression or comorbidities, such as 
substance abuse, clinicians should 
consider consultation with mental 
health professionals and refer to 
such professionals when deemed 
necessary. In cases of moderate 
depression with or without comorbid 
anxiety, clinicians should consider 
consultation by mental health and/
or treatment in the PC setting. 
Although the access barriers to 
mental health services need to 
be addressed by policy makers to 
make mental health consultations 
more feasible, available, and 
affordable in underserviced areas, 
clinical judgment should prevail in 
the meantime; thus, the need for 
consultation should be based on the 
clinician’s judgment. PC providers 
should also take into consideration 
the treatment preferences of patients 
and/or families, the severity and 
urgency of the case presentation, and 
the PC provider’s level of training 
and experience.
Active support and treatment 
should also be started in cases in 
which there is a lengthy waiting list 
for mental health services. Once a

 they are supported in crisis situations 
when caring for depressed youth.
Recommendation 4: PC clinicians 
should recommend scientifically 
tested and proven treatments 
(ie, psychotherapies, such as CBT 
or IPT-A, and/or antidepressant 
treatment, such as SSRIs) whenever 
possible and appropriate to achieve 
the goals of the treatment plan 
82 
(grade of evidence: 1; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
After providing education and 
support to the patient and family, 
the range of effective treatment 
options, including medications, 
psychotherapies, and family support 
should be considered. The patient 
and family should be assisted to 
arrive at a treatment plan that is both 
acceptable and implementable, taking 
into account their preferences and 
the availability of treatment services. 
The treatment plan should be 
customized according to the severity 
of disease, risk of suicide, and the 
existence of comorbid conditions. 
The GLAD-PC toolkit (www. 
gladpc. 
org) provides more detailed guidance 
around the factors that may influence 
treatment choices (ie, a patient 
with psychomotor retardation may 
not be able to actively engage in 
psychotherapy). A “common factors” 
approach is focused on evidence-
based practices, which are common 
across therapies. Common factors 
include better communication 
skills, to be supportive, to take 
advantage of therapeutic alliance, 
and to engage in shared decision-
making.83 Common sense approaches 
such as the prescription of physical 
exercise, sleep hygiene, and adequate 
nutrition should also be used in the 
management of these patients.
As an aside, the majority of CBT and 
IPT-A studies in which researchers 
included patients with MDD also 
included patients with depression 
not otherwise specified, subthreshold 
depressive symptoms, or dysthymic 
disorder. In contrast, medication 
RCTs for depression in adolescents 
generally only included subjects with 
MDD. Thus, although the general 
treatment of depression is addressed 
in these guidelines, medication-
specific guidelines apply only to fully 
expressed MDD.
Psychotherapies
Both CBT and IPT-A have been 
adapted to address depression in 
adolescents and have been shown to 
be effective in treating adolescents 
with MDD in tertiary care as well 
as community settings.57, 
 
84 CBT has 
been used in the PC setting with 
preliminary positive results.33, 
 
35 Also 
suggested in emerging evidence is 
the superior efficacy of combination 
therapy (medication and CBT) versus 
CBT alone.43 For a brief description of 
the 2 therapies, see Table 2.
Antidepressant Treatment
Previous research has shown that 
up to 25% of pediatric PC clinicians 
and 42% of family physicians in the 
United States had recently prescribed 
SSRIs for more than 1 adolescent 
under the age of 18.15 When indicated 
by clinical presentation (ie, clear 
diagnosis of MDD with no comorbid 
conditions) and patient and/or 
family preference, an SSRI should 
be used. The selection of the specific 
SSRI should be based on the optimum 
combination of safety and efficacy 
data. Deliberate self-harm and/or 
suicide risk is more likely to occur 
if the SSRI is started at higher doses 
(rather than normal starting doses).85 
The patient and family should be 
informed about the possible adverse 
effects (clinicians may use checklist), 
including possible switch to mania 
or the development of behavioral 
activation or suicide-related events. 
Once the antidepressant is started, 
and if tolerated, the clinician should 
support an adequate trial up to the 
maximum dose and duration.
In Table 3, recommended 
antidepressants and dosages for 
use in adolescents with depression 
are listed. These recommendations 
are based on the updated literature 
review and reviewed by the 
GLAD-PC Steering Committee. 
Generally, the effective dosages 
for antidepressants in adolescents 
are lower than would be found in 
adult guidelines. Note that only 
fluoxetine has been approved by 
the FDA for use in children and 
adolescents with depression, and 
only escitalopram has been approved 
for use in adolescents aged 12 years 
and older. Clinicians should know 
the potential drug interactions with 
SSRIs. Further information on the use 
of antidepressants is described in the 
GLAD-PC toolkit (www. 
gladpc. 
org). 
In addition, all SSRIs should be slowly 
tapered when discontinued because 
of risk of withdrawal effects. Details 
regarding the initial selection of a 
specific SSRI and possible reasons for 
initial drug choice can be found in the 
GLAD-PC toolkit.

TABLE 2  
Components of CBT and IPT-A
Therapy
Key Components
CBT
Thoughts influence behaviors and feelings and vice versa. Treatment targets patient’s 
thoughts and behaviors to improve his or her mood.
Essential elements of CBT include increasing pleasurable activities (behavioral activation), 
reducing negative thoughts (cognitive restructuring), and improving assertiveness 
and problem-solving skills to reduce feelings of hopelessness. CBT for adolescents may 
include sessions with parents and/or caregivers to review progress and to increase 
compliance with CBT-related tasks.
IPT-A
Interpersonal problems may cause or exacerbate depression, and that depression, in turn, 
may exacerbate interpersonal problems. Treatment targets patient’s interpersonal 
problems to improve both interpersonal functioning and his or her mood.
Essential elements of interpersonal therapy include identifying an interpersonal problem 
area, improving interpersonal problem-solving skills, and modifying communication 
patterns.
Parents and/or caregivers are involved in sessions during specific phases of the therapy.

Downloaded from 
 Contact (either in person or by 
telephone with either the clinician 
or member of the clinical staff) 
should take place after the initiation 
of treatment to review the patient’s 
and family’s understanding of and 
adherence to the treatment plan. 
Issues such as the current status 
of the patient and the patient and/
or family’s access to educational 
materials regarding depression 
should be discussed during follow-up 
conversations. For relevant 
educational resources for patients 
and/or families, please refer to the 
GLAD-PC toolkit (www. 
gladpc. 
org).
Recommendation 5: PC clinicians 
should monitor for the emergence 
of adverse events during 
antidepressant treatment (SSRIs) 
(grade of evidence: 3; strength of 
recommendation: very strong). 
82
Re-analysis of safety data from 
clinical trials of antidepressants 
led to a black-box warning from 
the FDA regarding the use of 
these medications in children 
and adolescents in 2004 and 
a recommendation for close 
monitoring. The exact wording of the 
FDA recommendation is:
All pediatric patients being treated with 
antidepressants for any indication should 
be observed closely for clinical worsening, 
suicidality, and unusual changes in 
behavior, especially during the initial few 
months of a course of drug therapy, or at 
times of dose changes, either increases or 
decreases.
It should be noted, however, that 
there is no empirical evidence to 
support the requirement of face-to-
face meetings per se. In fact, evidence 
from large population-based surveys 
reveals high reliability of telephone 
interviews with adolescent subjects 
for the diagnosis of depression.86, 
 
87  
Although obtaining a diagnosis is 
not the same as the elicitation of 
adverse events while in treatment, 
with this evidence, it is suggested 
that telephone contact may be just as 
effective in monitoring for adverse 
events. More importantly, a regular 
and frequent monitoring schedule 
should be developed, taking care to 
obtain input from the adolescents 
and families to ensure compliance 
with the monitoring strategy.88, 
 
89  
This may include monitoring 
of depressive symptoms, risky 
behaviors, and also functioning in 
the school setting, especially if an 
individualized education program 
is in place. Working closely with 
the family will ensure appropriate 
monitoring and help-seeking by 
caregivers.
Ongoing Management
The strength of evidence on which 
each recommendation is based has 
been rated 1 (strongest) through 5 
(weakest), according to the Oxford 
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 
levels of evidence, and paired with 
the strength of recommendation 
(Very strong [>90% agreement]), 
Strong [>70% agreement], Fair 
[>50% agreement], Weak [<50% 
agreement]).
Recommendation 1: Systematic 
and regular tracking of goals and 
outcomes from treatment should be 
performed, including assessment 
of depressive symptoms and 
functioning in several key domains. 
These include home, school, and 
peer settings (grade of evidence: 4; 
strength of recommendation: very 
strong).
Goals should include both 
improvement in functioning and 
resolution of depressive symptoms. 
Tracking of goals and outcomes from 
treatment should include function 
in several important domains (ie, 
home, school, peers). Evidence 
from large RCTs reveals that 
depressive symptoms and functional 
impairments may not improve at 
the same rate with treatment.28, 
 
70 
Therefore, symptoms and functioning 
should be tracked regularly during 
the course of treatment with 
information gathered from both the 
patients and their families when 
possible.
According to expert consensus, it is 
ideal that patients are assessed in 
person within 1 week of the initiation 
of treatment. At every assessment, 
clinicians should inquire about 
each of the following: (1) ongoing 
depressive symptoms, (2) risk of 
suicide, (3) possible adverse effects 
from treatment (including the use 
of specific adverse-effect scales), (4) 
adherence to treatment, and (5) new 
or ongoing environmental stressors. 
In several studies, researchers have 
examined medication maintenance 
after response.90 
– 
93 Emslie et al93 
randomly assigned pediatric patients 
who had responded to fluoxetine by 
19 weeks to placebo or to medication 
continuation for an additional  
32 weeks. Of the 20 subjects randomly 
assigned to the 32-week medication 
relapse-prevention arm, 10 were 
exposed to fluoxetine for 51 weeks. 
Significantly fewer relapses occurred 
in the group randomly assigned to 
medication maintenance, which 
suggests that longer medication 
continuation periods, possibly 1 
year, may be necessary for relapse 
prevention. In addition, Emslie et al93  
found the greatest risk of relapse 
to be in the first 8 to 12 weeks

 after discontinuing medication, 
which suggests that after stopping 
an antidepressant, close follow-up 
should be encouraged for at least 
2 to 3 months. Other studies 
have revealed similar benefits of 
prolonged treatment after acute 
response.90 
–93
With the limited evidence in children 
and adolescents and the emerging 
evidence in the adult literature 
in which it is suggested that 
antidepressant medication should be 
continued for 1 year after remission, 
both GLAD-PC and the American 
Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry concluded that medication 
be maintained for 6 to 12 months 
after the full resolution of depressive 
symptoms.22, 
 
90 
–93
However, regardless of the length 
of treatment, all patients should be 
monitored on a monthly basis for 6 
to 12 months after the full resolution 
of symptoms.22, 
 
93, 
 
94 If the depressive 
episode is a recurrence, clinicians are 
encouraged to monitor patients for 
up to 2 years given the high rates of 
recurrence as demonstrated in the 
adult literature in which maintenance 
treatment in those with recurrent 
depression continues for up to 2 
years after the full resolution of 
symptoms. Clinicians should obtain 
consultation from mental health 
professionals if a teenager develops 
psychosis, suicidal or homicidal 
ideation, and new or worsening of 
comorbid conditions.
Recommendation 2: Diagnosis 
and initial treatment should be 
reassessed if no improvement 
is noted after 6 to 8 weeks of 
treatment (grade of evidence: 
4; strength of recommendation: 
very strong). Mental health 
consultation should be considered 
(grade of evidence: 4; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
If improvement is not seen within 
6 to 8 weeks of treatment, mental 
health consultation should be 
considered. Evidence of improvement 
may include reduction in the 
number of depressive symptoms, 
improved functioning in social or 
school settings, or improvement 
spontaneously reported by the 
adolescent and/or parent or 
caregiver. The clinician should also 
reassess the initial diagnosis, choice 
and adequacy of initial treatment, 
adherence to treatment plan, 
presence of comorbid conditions 
(eg, substance abuse) or bipolar 
symptoms that may influence 
treatment effectiveness, and new 
external stressors. If a patient 
has no response to a maximum 
therapeutic dose of an antidepressant 
medication, the clinician should 
consider changing the medication. 
Alternatively, if the patient has 
failed to improve on antidepressant 
medication or therapy alone, the 
addition of or switch to the other 
modality should be considered.
Recommendation 3: For patients 
achieving only partial improvement 
after PC diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches have been exhausted 
(including exploration of poor 
adherence, comorbid disorders, 
and ongoing conflicts or abuse), a 
mental health consultation should 
be considered (grade of evidence: 4; 
strength of recommendation: very 
strong).
If a patient only partially improves 
with treatment, mental health 
consultation should be considered. 
The clinician should also review the 
diagnosis and explore possible causes 
of partial response, such as poor 
adherence to treatment, comorbid 
disorders, or ongoing conflicts and/
or abuse. These causes may need to 
be managed first before changes to 
the treatment plan are made.
If a patient has been treated 
with a SSRI (maximum tolerated 
dosage) and has shown only partial 
improvement, the addition of an 
evidence-based psychotherapy 
should be considered, if not 
previously initiated. Other 
considerations may include the 
addition of another medication, an 
increase of the dosage above FDA-
approved ranges, or a switch to 
another medication as suggested 
in the Treatment of SSRI-resistant 
Depression in Adolescents study, 
39  
preferably done in consultation 
with a mental health professional. 
Likewise, if a patient’s condition 
fails to improve after a trial of 
either CBT or IPT-A and has not 
yet begun medication, the clinician 
should consider a trial of SSRI 
antidepressant treatment. Strong 
consideration should also be given to 
a referral to mental health services.
Recommendation 4: PC clinicians 
should actively support depressed 
adolescents referred to mental 
health services to ensure adequate 
management (grade of evidence: 
5; strength of recommendation: 
very strong). PC clinicians may 
also consider sharing care with 
mental health agencies and/
or professionals where possible 
(grade of evidence: 1; strength 
of recommendation: very 
strong). Appropriate roles and 
responsibilities regarding the 
provision and comanagement of 
care should be communicated 
and agreed on by the PC clinician 
and the mental health clinician(s) 
(grade of evidence: 4; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
PC clinicians should continue 
follow-up with adolescents with 
depression who have been referred 
to mental health services for 
assessment and/or management.95 
Where possible, PC clinicians may 
consider sharing management of 
depressed adolescents with mental 
health agencies and/or professionals. 
There is emerging evidence from 
the literature about the greater 
effectiveness of “shared-care” models 
for the management of depression 
in the PC setting.27,

DISCUSSION
The recommendations regarding 
treatment and ongoing management 
highlight the need for PC providers 
to become familiar with the use of 
empirically tested treatments for 
adolescent depression, including both 
antidepressants and psychotherapy. 
In particular, antidepressant 
treatments can be useful in certain 
clinical situations in the PC setting. In 
many of these clinical scenarios, PC 
providers should schedule systematic 
and routine follow-up, including 
mental health support when 
appropriate. The need for systematic 
follow-up, whether by PC provider 
or by mental health provider, is 
especially important in light of the 
FDA black-box warnings regarding 
the emergence of adverse events with 
antidepressant treatment.
Psychotherapy is also recommended 
as first-line treatment of adolescents 
who are depressed in the PC 
setting. Although the provision of 
psychotherapy may be less feasible 
and practical within the constraints 
(ie, time, availability of trained staff) 
of PC settings, there is some evidence 
to support that quality improvement 
projects involving psychotherapy can 
improve the care of adolescents who 
are depressed.35
GLAD-PC was developed and now 
updated on the basis of the needs of 
PC clinicians who are faced with the 
challenge of caring for depressed 
adolescents as well as many barriers, 
including the shortage of mental 
health resources in most community 
settings. Although it is clear that 
more evidence and research in this 
area are needed, these updated 
guidelines represent a necessary 
step toward improving the care of 
depressed adolescents in the PC 
setting. Similar guidelines have also 
been produced for other health 
care contexts, such as in the United 
Kingdom (https:// 
www. 
nice. 
org. 
uk/ 
guidance/ 
cg28). The updated 
GLAD-PC guidelines and the toolkit 
(www. 
gladpc. 
org) reflect the coming 
together of available evidence and the 
consensus of experts representing 
a broad spectrum of specialties and 
advocacy organizations within the 
North American health care context. 
However, no improvements in care 
will be achieved if changes do not 
occur in the health care systems that 
would allow for increased training 
in mental health for PC clinicians 
and in collaborative models for 
both primary and specialty care 
clinicians. Therefore, it is critical 
that training programs for PC 
providers increase their focus 
on mental health issues and that 
trainees in both PC and specialty 
care areas be helped to hone their 
skills in working in collaborative 
care models89 (see http://

aspx). For providers who 
are currently practicing, continuing 
education should strengthen skills in 
collaborative work, and specifically, 
for PC providers, increase skills and 
knowledge in the management of 
depression.
LIMITATIONS
Although the guidelines covered 
a range of issues regarding 
the management of adolescent 
depression in the PC setting, there 
were other controversial areas 
that were not addressed in these 
recommendations. These included 
such issues as the use of augmenting 
agents and treatment of subthreshold 
symptoms. New emerging evidence 
may impact on the inclusion of such 
areas in future iterations of the 
guidelines and the toolkit (available 
for download at www. 
gladpc. 
org). 
Many of these recommendations 
are made in the face of an absence 
of evidence or at lower levels of 
evidence.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Ample evidence exists to support 
the notion that guidelines alone 
are insufficient in closing the gaps 
between recommended versus 
actual practices.100, 
 
101 Thus, it will 
be necessary to identify effective 
methods for disseminating 
information and provide assistance 
to PC clinicians in changing practice. 
Researchers should build on this 
work by piloting and evaluating 
methods, tools, and strategies to 
facilitate the adoption of these 
guidelines for the management 
of adolescent depression in PC 
settings. Researchers should also 
explore optimal methods for 
helping clinicians and their clinical 
settings address the range of 
obstacles that may interfere with 
the adoption of necessary practices 
to yield sustainable management of 
adolescent depression in PC settings.
Many jurisdictions have recognized 
the need to increase collaborative 
care to address the care of 
adolescents with mental illness. In 
Canada and the United States, models 
of care involving mental health and 
PC are being implemented (National 
Network of Child Psychiatry Access 
Programs: www. 
nncpap. 
org; 
Massachusetts Child Psychiatry 
Access Program: https:// 
www. 
mcpap. 
com/ 
; Partnership Access 
Line; Training and Education for 
the Advancement of Children’s 
Health).102 
–106 However, the 
empirical support for these models 
is modest internationally; therefore, 
additional research is urgently 
needed.
