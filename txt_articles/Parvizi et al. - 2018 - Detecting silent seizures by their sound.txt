Summary
Objective: The traditional approach to interpreting electroencephalograms (EEGs)
requires physicians with formal training to visually assess the waveforms. This
approach can be less practical in critical settings where a trained EEG specialist is
not readily available to review the EEG and diagnose ongoing subclinical sei-
zures, such as nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
Methods: We have developed a novel method by which EEG data are converted
to sound in real time by letting the underlying electrophysiological signal modu-
late a voice tone that is in the audible range. Here, we explored whether individu-
als without any prior EEG training could listen to 15-second sonified EEG and
determine whether the EEG represents seizures or nonseizure conditions. We
selected 84 EEG samples to represent seizures (n = 7), seizure-like activity
(n = 25), or nonperiodic, nonrhythmic activity (normal or focal/generalized slow-
ing, n = 52). EEGs from single channels in the left and right hemispheres were
then converted to sound files. After a 4-minute training video, medical students
(n = 34) and nurses (n = 30) were asked to designate each audio sample as “sei-
zure” or “nonseizure.” We then compared their performance with that of EEG-
trained neurologists (n = 12) and medical students (n = 29) who also diagnosed
the same EEGs on visual display.
Results: Nonexperts listening to single-channel sonified EEGs detected seizures with
remarkable sensitivity (students, 98% � 5%; nurses, 95% � 14%) compared to
experts or nonexperts reviewing the same EEGs on visual display (neurologists,
88% � 11%; students, 76% � 19%). If the EEGs contained seizures or seizure-like
activity, nonexperts listening to sonified EEGs rated them as seizures with high speci-
ficity (students, 85% � 9%; nurses, 82% � 12%) compared to experts or nonexperts
viewing the EEGs visually (neurologists, 90% � 7%; students, 65% � 20%).
Significance: Our study confirms that individuals without EEG training can
detect ongoing seizures or seizure-like rhythmic periodic patterns by listening to
sonified EEG. Although sonification of EEG cannot replace the traditional
approaches to EEG interpretation, it provides a meaningful triage tool for fast
assessment of patients with suspected subclinical seizures.

INTRODUCTION
Millions of people are seen in emergency departments
(EDs) for the evaluation of altered mental status (AMS).1
Additionally, AMS patients with critical conditions are
admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), where a significant
portion of these patients are found to have nonconvulsive
subclinical seizures.2 In these patients, electroencephalogra-
phy (EEG) is the gold standard method for detecting sub-
clinical seizures, especially nonconvulsive status epilepticus
(NCSE). A timely diagnosis of NCSE facilitates appropri-
ate acute management and reduces the number of unneces-
sary diagnostic procedures, length of hospitalization, and
morbidity and mortality.3–5
The current practice of EEG depends on the interpreta-
tion of the acquired data represented in visual or graphical
form by specialized neurologists with expertise in reading
EEG (clinical neurophysiologists and epileptologists). On
visual display, features of the brain waves are often confus-
ing to professionals not trained in reading EEGs. Thus, the
current EEG platform does not provide untrained users
(especially in the ED and ICU) with instant diagnostic
information at the bedside; therefore, the ordering physician
not trained in EEG will have to wait until a trained EEG
specialist has had time to review the recording. There is
often a long delay from the time of EEG order until the
ordering physician receives the diagnostic information from
the EEG team. One study showed that, for stat EEGs in
several university hospitals in North America, the initial
interpretation of the EEG had a mean delay of about
3 hours.6
In this study, we test the effectiveness of a method by
which EEG waveforms are sonified and users hear the
sound of rhythmic fluctuations of the waveforms to deter-
mine whether the waveforms represent seizures or non-
seizures.
To
this
end,
we
took
advantage
of
recent
developments in music research and introduced a novel
method of advanced sonification of EEG data. The overar-
ching hypothesis of the study was that users not trained in
EEG (such as nurses or medical students) will be able to
detect the presence of ongoing seizures by listening to
brainwaves converted to auditory form. In other words, the
claim is that if a patient is having ongoing seizures (for
example NCSE), one will be able to appreciate the pres-
ence of seizures by listening for only a few seconds to the
sound of the patient’s brainwaves. Like auscultating the
sound of the heart with a stethoscope, one can auscultate
the tone of the brain to determine whether the patient is
seizing at that very moment. Lastly, the aim of the study
was not to test whether users without prior exposure to
EEG could differentiate seizures from seizure-like rhythmic
periodic patterns such as generalized periodic discharges
(GPDs) or lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs), because
even individuals with extensive EEG training will often
disagree on the nomenclature and will have difficulties in
identifying subtle differences among these conditions.7
In our current study, we explored the performance of
our sonification method when used by medical students
and nurses compared to the performance of trained epilep-
tologists reviewing the same samples on visual display.
Our findings confirm that individuals without EEG
training can detect ongoing seizures or seizure-like rhyth-
mic periodic patterns by merely listening to a short dura-
tion of sonified EEG. Although sonification of EEG cannot
replace the traditional approaches to EEG interpretation, it
provides a meaningful triage tool for fast assessment of
patients with suspected subclinical seizures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Standard protocol approvals
This study was conducted with the approval of the Stanford
University Institutional Review Board and in accordance
with the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy
Studies (STARD) guidelines.
2.2 | EEG sample selection
We selected 84 EEG samples (15 seconds long) from
recordings obtained in the routine evaluation of patients
with altered mental status. Although it is unusual to ask
someone to evaluate only 15 seconds of the EEG, the 15-
second-long EEGs were chosen because they correspond to
a single page of EEG on visual display. Also, the users
were not allowed to change the gain or filter settings,
because we wanted to ensure that all raters provided their
responses on the basis of the same data.
The original epileptologist’s interpretation report was
used to identify EEGs that captured findings commonly
seen in the ICU, including seizures, seizure-like rhythmic

 and periodic patterns (eg, GPDs and LPDs), nonseizure
patterns such as slowing, and normal activity. In our selec-
tion of seizure cases, we made sure that the cases were
chosen from patients who had no clinical signs associated
with the seizures, hence the terms “silent,” “nonconvul-
sive,” or “subclinical.” We reviewed each continuous EEG
record to extract a 15-second epoch representative of the
activity
noted
in
the
original
epileptologist’s
report.
Figure 1 shows examples of each condition.
The relative number of files for each category was
chosen according to the reported prevalence of such
cases in the literature.4,8 We also emphasize that the per-
centage of nonseizure cases far exceeded the percentage
of seizure cases. Therefore, high performance in detecting
seizure cases could not be explained by chance perfor-
mance.
2.3 | Reference standard
Three senior epileptologists, each with >10 years of EEG
experience, reviewed each 15-second EEG sample pre-
sented visually in standard double banana montage. We
defined samples as seizures (n = 7), seizure-like abnormali-
ties (eg, GPDs, LPDs, triphasic waves, burst suppression,
n = 25), and slowing or normal (n = 52) based on the
majority agreement of these 3 experts.
2.4 | Study design
Two surveys were conducted, one using an 18-channel
visual presentation of EEG samples and a second using
audio presentations of single channels from the left (T3-
T5) and right (T4-T6) hemispheres from the same EEG

 samples prepared using our proprietary sonification algo-
rithm described elsewhere. Samples were presented in a
random order in both surveys. Visual samples were pre-
sented as one static page, whereas in the audio survey the
sound clips from left and right channels were presented
separately. Prior to completing the audio survey, partici-
pants watched a short video that described the appearance
of seizures and seizure-like patterns (eg, GPDs, LPDs,
triphasic waves, burst suppression) on visual display and
the correlation of specific visual features that define these
patterns (rhythmicity and periodicity) with the sound of
these brainwaves after sonification.
2.5 | Study participants
We recruited 15 neurologists with EEG training (ie, epilep-
tologists, epilepsy fellows, senior neurology residents), 34
medical students, and 30 nurses at Stanford University
Medical Center to participate in the audio and visual EEG
surveys. Of the 15 neurologists, 12 completed the visual
EEG survey and 3 served as referees; of the 34 medical
students who completed the audio EEG survey, 27 also
completed the visual EEG survey. The 30 nurses partici-
pated only in the audio EEG survey.
2.6 | Sonification method
We used a novel sonification algorithm to translate the
low-frequency EEG signals into the audible range by using
them as modulators of a voicelike synthesized sound.9
EEG signals acquired from 1 temporal channel (T3-T5 or
T4-T6) were applied as modulators of the synthesized
sound. For each visual EEG record, we produced 2 soni-
fied EEG clips (1 from each hemisphere). Using the sonifi-
cation method, vocal pitch, loudness, and formant structure
were directly varied by the input signal. In the seizure case,
the sonification renders epileptic spike trains into speech-
like declamations with a loud, strong rhythmic character,
which is easily distinguished by ear from the quieter,
slower,
and
smoother-sounding
normal
case
(see
Appendix S1). The unique feature of this new sonification
method is in its ability to use brain data (0-100 Hz) as a
source of audio signal modulation without distorting its
temporal information. Listeners hear the brain activity in its
own state (normal or seizure), in its natural time course,
and with its rhythms and severity, without breaking down
the rich EEG signal to its conventional narrow bands as
has been done in prior sonification methods.10–12
2.7 | Data coding
For each EEG sample in the visual survey, participants
were asked to indicate the presence of any and all specific
findings (seizure, GPD, LPD, triphasic wave, burst suppres-
sion, slowing, normal, or other). We reviewed participants’
responses (including those entered as free text if the partici-
pant selected “other”) and coded their selections of specific
findings as indicating “seizure” (if they indicated seizure
activity was present, regardless of other selections) and
“seizure or seizure-like” activity (if they indicated seizure,
GPD, LPD, triphasic wave, or burst suppression was pre-
sent).
For each single channel presented in the audio survey,
participants were asked to judge whether the sound repre-
sented seizure or nonseizure (respondents were also able to
respond “I do not know”). The visual EEG displays could
be rated as “seizure” if the neurologists noticed seizure
activity in any of the EEG channels. In the audio survey,
the left and right channels were presented separately, and
for each EEG sample we had 2 responses, which were then
combined
for
patient-based
analysis;
if
a
participant
responded “seizure” for either channel, the response for the
EEG sample from that patient was coded as “seizure.” This
resulted in an equal number of averaged responses across
visual and audio surveys.
2.8 | Statistical analysis
For each of the respondents (who were not part of the ref-
erence standard), we calculated the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of both visual and audio EEG for determining the
presence of seizure and of seizure/seizure-like activity
when compared to the reference standard. These analyses
were conducted at the sample level (rather than for individ-
ual channels presented in the audio survey). Differences
between diagnostic statistics (reported as mean with 95%
confidence intervals [CIs]) associated with display modality
(audio vs visual) and training level (physician vs nurse vs
student) were calculated using 2-sample t tests; a signifi-
cant level of a = .05 was used with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
The STARD flow diagram is shown in Figure 2. The neu-
rologists with EEG training who completed the visual sur-
vey included 7 epilepsy fellows and 5 neurology residents.
No significant differences in diagnostic statistics were
observed between neurologists of different levels of train-
ing (attending, fellow, and resident) or between untrained
individuals (nurses and students).
Review of visual EEG is the gold standard method for
detecting seizure activity. However, there are reports of sig-
nificant interrater variability among EEG readers and the
method is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific, even

 when read by trained physicians.13–16 We confirmed this
by showing visual EEG samples to EEG-trained epilepsy
fellows and neurology residents, who detected seizures
with only 86% sensitivity (CI = 79%-93%) and 87% speci-
ficity (CI = 84%-90%), and seizures/seizure-like activity
with only 88% sensitivity (CI = 86%-90%) and 90% speci-
ficity (CI = 84%-95%; Figure 3). By contrast, untrained
individuals (medical students and nurses) demonstrated sur-
prisingly high sensitivity for seizures and specificity for
seizures/seizure-like activity while listening to the sound of
EEG. Their performance using audio EEG was comparable
to that of neurologists with EEG training (Figure 4). The
sensitivity for seizures observed for students and nurses
was 98% (CI = 96%-100%) and 95% (CI = 90%-100%),
respectively, whereas their specificity for seizures was 65%
(CI = 61%-69%) for nurses and 66% (CI = 63%-69%) for
students. When considering responses indicating the pres-
ence of seizure as correct for both seizure and seizure-like
samples, specificity increased to 82% (CI = 78%-86%) for
nurses and 85% (CI = 82%-88%) for students. Sensitivity
for seizures and seizure-like activity was 77% (CI = 72%-
81%) for nurses and 79% (CI = 77%-82%) for students.
Nurses and students detected seizure-like events with 77%
and 79% sensitivity and 82% and 85% specificity, respec-
tively. Despite their high performance using audio EEG,
students, as might be expected, were less able to make
accurate diagnoses using visual EEG. They demonstrated
76% sensitivity (CI = 69%-83%; P < .001) and 65% speci-
ficity (CI = 58%-73%; P = .92) for seizures and 62% sensi-
tivity (CI = 54%-70%; P < .001) and 65% specificity (CI =
57%-72%; P < .001) for seizures and seizure-like activity.
As shown in Figure 5, medical students who had taken
both the visual and audio tests demonstrated greater and
more consistent sensitivity and specificity for seizures and
seizure-like activity by listening to EEG sound.

DISCUSSION
EEG is the current gold standard method for monitoring
the
brain’s
electrophysiological
activity.
Traditional
approaches to interpreting EEG have mostly involved visu-
ally inspecting the electrical signals in polygraph-style
charts. This approach is useful for determining the approxi-
mate source of electrophysiological abnormality (eg, focal
seizures), but it has proven to be impractical in critical set-
tings where there is an urgent need to assess patients with
AMS who may be having ongoing subclinical nonconvul-
sive seizures.
We have invented a new way of evaluating EEGs by
which clinical team members, including nurses and more
junior trainees, can instantly assess whether a patient is
having seizures by listening to the EEG sound, that is, the
“brain stethoscope function” (see Appendix S1 for sample
sounds). Our continuous modulation technique9 runs in real
time and is computationally inexpensive. It creates a dis-
tinctive sound that clearly contrasts seizure versus non-
seizure brain states. If there are no seizures, the listener
hears a steady vocal tone with no variation. If there are sei-
zures, fluctuations in the EEG signal cause frequency

 fluctuations in the tone, an effect very much like vibrato.
In the current study, we confirm that individuals without
EEG training can detect ongoing seizures or seizure-like
rhythmic and periodic patterns by merely listening to short
clips of sonified EEG. Our method of listening to the
“sound of the brain” is similar to listening to the sound of
the heart with a stethoscope. We move the stethoscope to
different locations of the chest to listen to different valves

 of the heart. Similarly, with EEG sonification, a user can
listen for a few seconds to the sound of any part of the
brain by choosing the appropriate EEG channel and the
hemisphere.
Ours is also the first study to test the capability of a
sonification method to detect a range of significant abnor-
malities when it is used by clinical staff (eg, physicians,
nurses, and students). Although sonification of EEG cannot
replace the traditional approaches to EEG interpretation,
especially when it concerns detection of single epileptiform
discharges, it seems to be ideal for fast assessment of
patients with ongoing subclinical seizures. The less-than-
perfect specificity of audio EEG for seizures and improved
specificity for the broader category of seizure/seizure-like
activity suggest that nonexperts (and even experts) may not
be able to differentiate subtle differences between general-
ized rhythmic and periodic patterns (eg, GPDs and triphasic
waves) and status epilepticus by their sound. It is often dif-
ficult even for trained EEG specialists to differentiate
triphasic
waves
from
NCSE
when
reviewing
visual
EEGs.14,17 Therefore, the sonification method should be
used as a triage diagnostic tool to help nonexpert users dis-
cern normal or slow activity from seizures and grossly
abnormal seizure-like rhythmic or periodic discharges.
Our results strongly suggest that EEG sonification can
have a meaningful application in rapid response settings
when EEG interpretation is crucial in making treatment
choices. Sonification methods prior to the digitization of
EEG systems showed great promise in accurately diagnos-
ing seizures. One such sonification method used by the
Oxford-Medilog 9000 System in the early 1980s demon-
strated excellent capability to detect seizures in long-term
ambulatory EEGs recorded on a tape by playing it at 960
speed.18 Although this method was useful for offline
review of long-term EEG files, the compression of EEG by
the factor of 50-200 distorts the temporal information and
does not allow bedside monitoring in real-time. Unlike
other existing sonification algorithms, our method preserves
the temporal features of the EEG as the users listen to the
sound in real-time, as if they are listening through a brain
stethoscope. Preserving the natural flow of EEG signal in
time may have, in part, enabled the users to detect seizures
and seizure-like activity with remarkably high sensitivity
and specificity.
Lastly, we are mindful of the limitations of our study’s
retrospective design. We had selected representative EEG
samples
for
sonification
as
opposed
to
prospectively
recruiting patients and studying clinicians’ interpretation of
the EEG sounds in real time and at the bedside. We are
also mindful that our method selects individual channels
(T3-T5 or T4-T6 in this study) for sonification, and any
focal seizures in other channels (that do not cause changes
in the selected temporal channels) may go undetected.
However, because the intended use of EEG sonification is
to detect generalized or hemispheric patterns such as the
ones in cases of NCSE, single-channel sonification may be
sufficient. However, this needs to be tested in prospective
studies. Clinical trials using EEG sonification at the bed-
side are currently underway.
