Summary
Background Up to 60% of patients with Crohn’s disease need intestinal resection within the fi
 rst 10 years of diagnosis, 
and postoperative recurrence is common. We investigated whether mercaptopurine can prevent or delay postoperative 
clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease.
Methods We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial at 29 UK secondary and tertiary hospitals of 
patients (aged >16 years in Scotland or >18 years in England and Wales) who had a confi
 rmed diagnosis of Crohn’s 
disease and had undergone intestinal resection. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated 
web-based randomisation system to oral daily mercaptopurine at a dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight rounded to the 
nearest 25 mg or placebo; patients with low thiopurine methyltransferase activity received half the normal dose. 
Patients and their carers and physicians were masked to the treatment allocation. Patients were followed up for 
3 years. The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
>150 plus 100-point increase in score) and the need for anti-infl
 ammatory rescue treatment or primary surgical 
intervention. Primary and safety analyses were by intention to treat. Subgroup analyses by smoking status, previous 
thiopurines, previous infl
 iximab or methotrexate, previous surgery, duration of disease, or age at diagnosis were also 
done. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN89489788) 
and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2006-005800-15).
Findings Between June 6, 2008, and April 23, 2012, 240 patients with Crohn’s disease were randomly assigned: 128 to 
mercaptopurine and 112 to placebo. All patients received at least one dose of study drug, and no randomly assigned 
patients were excluded from the analysis. 16 (13%) of patients in the mercaptopurine group versus 26 (23%) patients in 
the placebo group had a clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease and needed anti-infl
 ammatory rescue treatment or 
primary surgical intervention (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·27–1·06; p=0·07; unadjusted HR 0·53, 
95% CI 0·28–0·99; p=0·046). In a subgroup analysis, three (10%) of 29 smokers in the mercaptopurine group and 
12 (46%) of 26 in the placebo group had a clinical recurrence that needed treatment (HR 0·13, 95% CI 0·04–0·46), 
compared with 13 (13%) of 99 non-smokers in the mercaptopurine group and 14 (16%) of 86 in the placebo group 
(0·90, 0·42–1·94; pinteraction=0·018). The eff
 ect of mercaptopurine did not signifi
 cantly diff
 er from placebo for any of the 
other planned subgroup analyses (previous thiopurines, previous infl
 iximab or methotrexate, previous surgery, 
duration of disease, or age at diagnosis). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the mercaptopurine 
and placebo groups. One patient on placebo died of ischaemic heart disease. Adverse events caused discontinuation of 
treatment in 39 (30%) of 128 patients in the mercaptopurine group versus 41 (37%) of 112 in the placebo group.
Interpretation Mercaptopurine is eff
 ective in preventing postoperative clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease, but only 
in patients who are smokers. Thus, in smokers, thiopurine treatment seems to be justifi
 ed in the postoperative 
period, although smoking cessation should be strongly encouraged given that smoking increases the risk of 
recurrence.

Introduction 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic, relapsing infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease. Estimates of the frequency of surgical 
resection in Crohn’s disease vary. Historical data 
suggest that up to 60% of patients need a major 
abdominal resection within 10 years of diagnosis.1 
However, more recent population-based data suggest 
this fi
 gure is as low as 29% at 7 years.2 Postoperative

recurrence is common within 2 years, in the form of 
endoscopic signs (72–98% of patients) or clinical 
symptoms (37–70%), with the proportion of patients 
needing surgery increasing by 5% per year.3,4
Strategies to prevent or delay postoperative recurrence 
of Crohn’s disease are of major clinical importance. 
However, there is a paucity of evidence to support any 
particular drug treatment strategy.5,6 Azathioprine and 
mercaptopurine have an established role in inducing 
remission, and in the maintenance of medically induced 
remission, in patients with Crohn’s disease. These drugs 
are recommended in treatment algorithms for patients at 
high risk of postoperative relapse,4 but the evidence to 
support this, and the evidence that clinical parameters 
can predict patients at high risk of relapse, is weak. 
A meta-analysis7 showed that effi
  cacy data for thiopurines 
in this setting were inconclusive and, aside from smoking, 
there were no consistent predictors of postoperative 
relapse. A Cochrane review8 also concluded that the 
evidence supporting thiopurines for the reduction of 
endoscopic and clinical recurrence was insuffi
  cient 
because of the small numbers of patients included and 
fl
 awed study designs. The value of thiopurine metabolites 
in postoperative Crohn’s disease is unknown. The role 
of biological treatments in postoperative Crohn’s 
disease has received substantial attention. After smaller 
randomised studies of infl
 iximab,9,10 fi
 ndings from the 
POCER study11 showed that targeted escalation of 
immune-modulatory treatment (ie, thiopurines followed 
by adalimumab) in patients with early endoscopic 
evidence of recurrence might delay subsequent endo-
scopic, although not clinical, recurrence.
 
We therefore aimed to establish whether mercap-
topurine, compared with placebo, can prevent or delay 
postoperative clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease that 
needs anti-infl
 ammatory rescue treatment or surgery. 
Methods 
 
Study design and participants 
TOPPIC 
was 
a 
randomised, 
placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study done at 29 secondary and tertiary UK 
hospitals. The study was approved by the Scotland “A
” 
Research Ethics Committee. 
Patients aged at least 16 years (Scotland) or 18 years 
(England and Wales) who had a diagnosis of Crohn’s 
disease12 and an ileocolic or small bowel resection within 
the preceding 3 months were eligible for inclusion. Key 
exclusion criteria were residual active Crohn’s disease 
present after surgery, known intolerance or hyper-
sensitivity to thiopurines, known need for further 
surgery, strictureplasty alone, formation of a stoma, 
active or untreated malignancy, absent thiopurine

Evidence before this study
There remains uncertainty about the effi
  cacy of thiopurines in 
patients with postoperative Crohn’s disease. We searched the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 
May 24, 2016, and PubMed from Jan 1, 1974, to 
May 24, 2016, with the terms “(azathioprine OR 
mercaptopurine OR thiopurine) AND Crohn’s AND 
(postoperative OR resection OR hemicolectomy OR ileectomy 
OR surgical procedures OR surgery) AND trial”, with no 
language restrictions. We identifi
 ed two previous systematic 
reviews with meta-analyses comparing thiopurines with 
placebo, both published by the Cochrane Collaboration. 
These reviews diff
 ered in their choice of timepoint to assess 
outcome and in their handling of loss to follow-up. 
The earlier Cochrane review compared clinical recurrence at a 
standard time of 12 months across all studies and used the 
number of patients with a clinical relapse as the outcome 
measure. Clinical relapse diff
 ered signifi
 cantly between 
thiopurines and placebo (risk ratio 0·59, 95% CI 0·38–0·92, 
favouring thiopurines). The more recent Cochrane 
meta-analysis used the end of study, which varied between 
1 year and 2 years, and regarded anyone who did not 
complete the study as a treatment failure. This study reported 
a benefi
 t for thiopurines compared with placebo (risk ratio 
0·74, 95% CI 0·58–0·94). The Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation score for the 
evidence was low. No further published randomised 
controlled trials were identifi
 ed that compared thiopurines 
with placebo since this meta-analysis.
Added value of this study
TOPPIC is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised controlled 
study of thiopurines for postoperative prevention of Crohn’s 
disease, and the largest interventional study of any kind for this 
indication, with 240 patients enrolled. We found no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between mercaptopurine and placebo for the 
primary endpoint of clinical recurrence of Crohn’s disease 
(Crohn’s Disease Activity Index >150 plus 100-point increase in 
score) and the need for anti-infl
 ammatory rescue treatment or 
primary surgical intervention. Smoking was confi
 rmed as the 
only factor predictive of disease recurrence. A subgroup 
analysis revealed that mercaptopurine was eff
 ective at reducing 
the incidence of clinical recurrence within 3 years of surgery in 
smokers, but not in non-smokers (pinteraction=0·018).
Implications of all the available evidence
Combining our data with those included in the previous 
Cochrane meta-analyses derives a risk ratio of 0·57 (0·38–0·85) 
in favour of mercaptopurine for the prevention of 
post-operative Crohn’s disease (appendix p 11). We confi
 rm 
that smoking aff
 ects the clinical course of Crohn’s disease, as 
well as response to treatment, whereas no diff
 erences were 
reported by age, sex, or a history of previous surgery. Smoking 
cessation should be a priority in patients with Crohn’s disease 
after surgery.

methyltransferase activity, substantial abnormalities of 
liver function tests or full blood count, and pregnancy. 
The appendix (p 4) lists all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Before randomisation, postoperative infections 
were treated and existing treatments for Crohn’s disease 
stopped. The protocol was amended on Sept 28, 2010, to 
include patients successfully treated for a malignancy 
and in remission for at least 5 years and to exclude 
those receiving treatment for active Crohn’s disease 
at random allocation. All patients provided written 
informed consent before enrolment.
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to mercaptopurine 
or identical matched placebo using a computer-generated 
web-based randomisation system managed by the 
Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit (University of Edinburgh, 
Edinburgh, UK) and stratifi
 ed according to smoking 
status at baseline and recruiting site (block sizes of two or 
four). Patients’ details were entered into the randomisation 
system before random allocation and were concealed at 
randomisation.  
Patients and their carers and physicians 
were masked to the treatment allocation. Blood monitoring 
results were reviewed by an independent central clinician 
masked to treatment allocation and to mean corpuscular 
volume results. The appendix (p 5) details the dose 
reduction algorithm. To protect masking, investigators 
were informed that sham dose reductions were planned 
for patients on placebo. However, on the advice of the data 
monitoring committee, sham dose reductions did not 
occur; the investigators were not informed of this. 
Procedures 
Patients received once daily oral mercaptopurine, at a 
dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight rounded to the nearest 
25 mg, or identical matched placebo. Patients with low 
thiopurine methyltransferase activity were prescribed 
half the normal dose.
Baseline assessments included Crohn’s Disease Activity 
Index (CDAI); patient-reported outcome measures, 
including the Infl
 ammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
(IBDQ); a physical examination; and a blood sample for 
6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations (6-thioguanine 
and 6-methyl 
mercaptopurine; appendix p 6). We also 
took additional blood samples for genetic and serological 
analysis and will report those results separately. Treatment 
was planned for 3 years, with dose adjusted for changes 
in bodyweight. The appendix (p 6) describes which 
procedures were done at which timepoints. Blood 
monitoring was done weekly for the fi
 rst 6 weeks and 
thereafter at 6-weekly intervals. Patients with abnormal 
results had a dose reduction, temporary cessation, or 
cessation as per a study algorithm (appendix p 5). Patients 
with persistent nausea or persistent infl
 uenza-like 
symptoms also received a dose reduction, according to 
the protocol. If abnormal parameters improved after a 
temporary cessation, treatment was recommenced at a 
lower dose. At each study visit, the following data 
were collected: CDAI, physical examination, concomitant 
medications, and patient-reported outcomes, including 
the IBDQ (appendix p 6). Samples for assay of faecal 
calprotectin, 6-thioguanine, and 6-methyl 
mercaptopurine 
were collected at randomisation and weeks 13, 49, 103, 
and 157
. Faecal samples were stored on site at –80°C 
and then shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory 
(Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Western General Hospital, 
Edinburgh, UK) for analysis with the CALPRO Calprotectin 
ELISA test (Calpro AS, Lysaker, Norway). Samples were 
stored in a freezer until the patient exited the study, and 
all samples for an individual were then tested at the 
same time. The Edinburgh laboratory has a coeffi
  cient of 
variation of 10% for faecal calprotectin (based on 
assessments of the entire sample processing pipeline). 
6-thioguanine nucleotide and 6-methyl 
mercaptopurine 
were analysed by the Viapath Purine Research Laboratory 
(St Thomas’ Hospital, London, UK) using a method 
adapted from Dervieux and colleagues.13 Briefl
 y, 
thioguanine and methylated mercaptopurine nucleotides 
in whole blood were hydrolysed to the base by boiling in 
15% perchloric acid and detected by ultraviolet absorption 
after separation on a Waters Ultra-Performance Liquid 
Chromatography system (Waters Limited, Elstree, 
Hertfordshire, UK). Colonoscopy was done at 49 and 
157 weeks after randomisation. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was clinical recurrence, defi
 ned as 
a CDAI score of over 150 and a 100-point increase from 
baseline, and the need for anti-infl
 ammatory rescue 
treatment or primary surgical intervention. Secondary 
outcomes were clinical recurrence, defi
 ned as reaching 
either of the individual components of the primary 
outcome (ie, either a CDAI score of >150 and a 100-point 
increase from baseline, or the need for anti-infl
 ammatory 
rescue treatment or primary surgical intervention); 
endoscopic recurrence, defi
 ned as a Rutgeerts score of at 
least i2; Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity 
(CDEIS) score;14,15 and quality of life, measured by 
changes in IBDQ scores. Adverse events were assessed 
by investigators at the participating sites using criteria 
defi
 ned in the trial protocol. 
Statistical analysis 
 
A sample size of 234 patients was needed to give 80% 
power to detect a reduction in the frequency of recurrence 
from 50% in the placebo group to 30% in the treatment 
group by 3 years at the 5% level of signifi
 cance.
Analyses were by intention to treat. For the primary 
analysis, we used a Cox proportional hazards model 
with terms for treatment and the variables on which 
the randomisation was stratifi
 ed (smoking status and 
recruitment site), adjusted for baseline values of 
previous treatment with mercaptopurine and previous 
treatment with azathioprine. We present adjusted and

unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for 
the comparison of mercaptopurine versus placebo 
(reference), with an HR of less than one suggesting a 
treatment eff
 ect in favour of mercaptopurine. For both 
primary and secondary outcomes, the adjusted analysis 
was judged to be the primary analysis. We did predefi
 ned 
subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary 
outcomes to assess treatment eff
 ect in terms of previous 
medical treatment, previous surgery, smoking status, 
duration of disease, and age at diagnosis. The interaction 
between subgroup and treatment was included in the 
Cox regression model to establish whether the treatment 
eff
 ect diff
 ered by subgroup.
We 
compared 
endoscopic 
recurrence 
between 
treatment groups using a χ² test. CDEIS results at week 
157 were compared between treatment groups using a 
two-sided t test. The same subgroups analysed for the 
primary and secondary outcomes were also analysed 
with respect to endoscopic recurrence and CDEIS scores. 
We produced receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of faecal 
calprotectin to predict endoscopic recurrence and 
remission. The optimum cutoff
  point was calculated by 
maximising Youden’s J statistic. We incorporated faecal 
calprotectin and 6-thioguanine separately into a Cox 
proportional hazards model as time-varying covariates. 
Quality of life, as measured by the IBDQ, was analysed 
using a change from baseline repeated measures 
ANCOVA to assess the eff
 ect of treatment over time for 
the overall mean IBDQ score and also the overall total 
IBDQ score. Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D 
system was summarised by treatment group across 
study visits.
We excluded missing data from any formal statistical 
analyses, with the exception of a secondary sensitivity 
 
analysis to the complete case analysis of IBDQ data, for 
which we used several imputation techniques, as 
described in the statistical analysis plan. A data 
monitoring committee oversaw the trial.  
Data were 
analysed in SAS version 9.4.
In a post-hoc analysis, we used the absolute risk 
reduction experienced by patients on mercaptopurine 
versus placebo to calculate the number needed to 
treat (NNT), for benefi
 t and harm, for smokers and 
non-smokers.
This trial is registered with the International Standard 
Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN89489788) 
and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT 
number 2006-005800-15).

Results 
 
Between June 6, 2008, and April 23, 2012, 328 patients 
were screened at 29 centres (appendix p 7), 240 of whom 
met eligibility criteria, consented to inclusion, and were 
enrolled and randomly assigned: 128 to mercaptopurine 
and 112 to placebo (fi
 gure 1). There was low patient 
recruitment (only one or two patients) at several centres, 
which resulted in only one treatment being assigned 
at these centres, which created the imbalance in 
recruitment numbers between treatment groups. All 
patients received at least one dose of study drug. 
146 (61%) were women and 55 (23%) were smokers 
(table 1). Baseline characteristics were similar between 
study groups (table 1). 104 (43%) of 240 patients received 
study drug at the initial dose for the entire 3-year 
treatment period. The mean treatment period was 
22·6 months (SD 13·7): 23·4 months (14·0) in the 
mercaptopurine group versus 21·8 months (13·4) in 
the placebo group. 50 (39%) of 128 patients in the 
mercaptopurine group and 18 (16%) of 112 in the placebo 
group had a dose reduction in accordance with the trial 
protocol. Study drug was discontinued in 66 (52%) of 
128 patients in the mercaptopurine groups versus 
70 (63%) of 112 in the placebo group for the following 
reasons: adverse events in 80 patients (59%; 39 in the 
mercaptopurine group and 41 in the placebo group), 
abnormal blood test results in 18 (13%; 12 and six), early 
withdrawal in 21 (15%; eight and 13), loss to follow-up in 
16 (12%; seven and nine), and death in one (1%; in the 
placebo group). The appendix (p 8) summarises data 
completeness for the study visits. Median follow-up was 
36·0 months (IQR 27·5–36·0) in the mercaptopurine 
group and 36·0 months (19·5–36·0) in the placebo group.

for recurrence and had rescue treatment, fi

of whom subsequently went on to have surgery. 
In predefi

had a clinical recurrence, three (10%) of 29 in the 
mercaptopurine group and 12 (46%) of 26 in the placebo 
group (HR 0·13, 95% CI 0·04–0·46), compared with 
27 (15%) of 185 non-smokers, 13 (13%) of 99 in the 
mercaptopurine group and 14 (16%) of 86 in the placebo 
group (0·90, 0·42–1·94; pinteraction=0·018; fi

smokers (95% CI NNTbenefi
 t 7·5 to ∞ to NNTharm 14·1) 
across the entire follow-up period. Previous exposure to 
treatment, previous surgery, thiopurine status, duration 
of disease, and age at diagnosis had no eff

34 (27%) of 128 patients in the mercaptopurine group 
versus 40 (36%) of 112 in the placebo group experienced 
the secondary endpoint of clinical recurrence, defi
 ned as 
a CDAI rise or need for rescue treatment or surgery 
(adjusted HR 0·74, 95% CI 0·44–1·23; p=0·24; 
unadjusted 0·75, 0·47–1·18; p=0·21). In subgroup 
analyses, 
mercaptopurine 
reduced 
recurrence 
in 
smokers only (pinteraction=0·033; fi
 gure 4).
Of the 208 patients who remained in the study 49 weeks 
after randomisation, 172 attended for colonoscopy (95 in 
the mercaptopurine group and 77 in the placebo group), 
and a Rutgeerts score was available for 168 (91 in the 
mercaptopurine group and 77 in the placebo group). 
Of these, 121 (72%; 58 in the mercaptopurine group and 
63 in the placebo group) had some form of endoscopic 
recurrence (score >i0). Of the 161 patients who remained 
in the study at week 157 after randomisation, 128 (69 in 
the mercaptopurine group and 59 in the placebo group) 
underwent a colonoscopy, and a Rutgeerts score was 
available for 124 (67 in the mercaptopurine group and

some form of endoscopic recurrence (score >i0). 29 (43%) 
of 67 patients in the mercaptopurine group and 28 (49%) 
of 57 in the placebo group had endoscopic recurrence 
with a Rutgeerts score of i2 or greater (p=0·38). We noted 
a similar pattern at week 49, although this pattern was 
not formally analysed. Week 157 CDEIS scores did not 
diff
 er signifi
 cantly between groups (data not shown). 
Similarly, none of the CDEIS subgroup analyses showed 
a signifi
 cant interaction with treatment (data not shown).
Of the 168 patients who had a Rutgeerts score calculated 
at week 49, faecal calprotectin concentrations were 
available in 126 patients (71 in the mercaptopurine group 
and 55 in the placebo group). Of the 124 patients who 
had a Rutgeerts score calculated at week 157, faecal 
calprotectin concentrations were available in 88 patients 
(46 in the mercaptopurine group and 42 in the placebo 
group; appendix p 12). These data were combined to 
generate ROC curves to examine test accuracy at 
predicting endoscopic recurrence and remission. In both 
scenarios, the faecal calprotectin measurement proved to 
be an unreliable test, with an area under the curve of 
0·70 (95% CI 0·63–0·77) for recurrence and 0·66 
(0·58–0·75) for remission. Selecting a faecal calprotectin 
concentration of 50 μg/g (commonly proposed as an 
appropriate cutoff
  concentration to detect infl
 ammation) 
to predict endoscopic recurrence produced a sensitivity 
of 84·4% (95% CI 77·0–91·9), specifi
 city of 44·4% 
(35·6–53·1), positive predictive value (PPV) of 52·4% 
(44·3–60·5), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 
79·7% (70·2–89·2). Increasing the cutoff
  concentration 
to 100 μg/g produced a sensitivity of 72·2% (95% CI 
63·0–81·5), specifi
 city of 62·1% (53·6–70·6), PPV of 
58·0% (48·9–67·2), and NPV of 75·5% (67·1–83·8). The 
NPV for the prediction of endoscopic remission with a 
faecal calprotectin concentration of 50 μg/g was 81·4% 
(95% CI 75·0–87·7) and with a concentration of 100 μg/g 
it was 83·9% (77·1–90·7; appendix p 9). Analysis of faecal 
calprotectin as a time-varying covariate suggested that,

for every 100-unit increase in faecal calprotectin, the HR 
for the primary endpoint (data available for 31 [74%] of 
42 patients who reached the primary endpoint) increased 
by 18% (HR 1·18, 95% CI 1·08–1·28; p=0·0002).
102 (92%) of 111 patients had 6-thioguanine nucleotide 
concentrations measured at week 49, and 64 (72%) of 
89 who remained on mercaptopurine had concentrations 
measured at week 157
. 6-thioguanine nucleotide concen-
trations were grouped according to the target therapeutic 
range (235–450 pmol per 8 × 10⁸ red blood cells). At 
week 49, 61 (60%) of 102 patients had subtherapeutic 
concentrations, versus 40 (63%) of 64 at week 157 
(appendix p 13). In the corresponding time-varying 
covariate analysis of 6-thioguanine nucleotide concen-
trations in patients receiving mercaptopurine, the 
association with the primary outcome was not signifi
 cant 
(HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·57–1·13; p=0·21).
IBDQ data were available for 203 (85%) of 
240 randomly assigned patients at week 49 (109 in the 
mercaptopurine group and 94 in the placebo group) and 
155 (65%) at week 157 (86 in the mercaptopurine group 
and 69 in the placebo group). Overall mean or total 
IBDQ scores did not seem to diff
 er signifi
 cantly between 
groups (data not shown).
 
The incidence and types of adverse events were similar 
in the mercaptopurine and placebo groups (table 2 and 
appendix p 10). Adverse events caused discontinuation 
of treatment in 80 (33%) of 240 patients: 39 (30%) of 
128 in the mercaptopurine group versus 41 (37%) of 
112 in the placebo group. Of the 1747 reported adverse 
events, four (<1%) were malignancies (three in the 
mercaptopurine group [two cases of lentigo maligna in 
the same individual and one case of basal cell carcinoma] 
and one in the placebo group [breast cancer]), and one 
patient on placebo died of ischaemic heart disease. 
171 (18%) of 947 events in the mercaptopurine group and 
184 (23%) of 798 in the placebo group were infections. 
Mercaptopurine was temporarily stopped in 32 patients 
because of abnormal blood monitoring results or other 
side-eff
 ects. Placebo was temporarily discontinued in 
35 patients for similar reasons.
14 pregnancies were reported during the course of the 
trial, with 12 healthy outcomes (ie, successful birth and 
healthy infant). One spontaneous abortion occurred at 
about 21 weeks gestation in the mercaptopurine group 
and one congenital anomaly (heart murmur, septal 
defect, and hydrocephalus) occurred in a child born to a 
patient in the placebo group.
 
In a post-hoc analysis, complete endoscopic remission 
(Rutgeerts score i0) was maintained in proportionally 
more patients on mercaptopurine than placebo at both 
week 49 and week 157 (appendix pp 14–15). In a subgroup 
analysis, mercaptopurine was more eff
 ective at preventing 
endoscopic recurrence in patients with previous 
thiopurine exposure (odds ratio 0·25, 95% CI 0·09–0·70) 
than in thiopurine-naive patients (3·00, 1·00–9·04;

mercaptopurine group versus 62 (82%) of 76 in the

67 in the mercaptopurine group versus 48 (84%) of 57 in 
the placebo group at week 157 (p=0·07).
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised, 
double-blind 
study 
to 
assess 
the 
effi
  cacy 
of 
mercaptopurine in the prevention of postoperative 
Crohn’s disease. The primary outcome of clinical 
recurrence of Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity 
Index >150 plus 100-point increase in score) and the 
need for anti-infl
 ammatory rescue treatment or primary 
surgical intervention, occurred in 13% of patients in the 
mercaptopurine group versus 23% in the placebo group 
(adjusted p=0·07); however, clinical recurrence was 
signifi
 cantly more common in smokers, in whom 
mercaptopurine proved benefi
 cial, with an NNT of three. 
The secondary outcome of endoscopic recurrence was 
recorded in a third of patients in each group, with no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence between groups; however, in a 
post-hoc analysis, mercaptopurine was signifi
 cantly 
more eff
 ective than placebo at maintaining complete 
endoscopic remission. Although there was no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence in the prespecifi
 ed primary clinical effi
  cacy 
endpoint, the subgroup analyses provide relevant 
insights in terms of clinical prediction of response and 
outcome, and in terms of the challenges in assessing 
outcome by endoscopic or clinical criteria.
Findings from this study confi
 rm that smoking aff
 ects 
the clinical course of Crohn’s disease, as well as response 
to treatment. Of the factors assessed, the primary 
endpoint was only signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between 
smokers and non-smokers, whereas no diff
 erences were 
reported by age, sex, a history of previous surgery, 
duration of disease, previous treatments, or thiopurine 
status. The data highlight the importance of smoking 
cessation in disease management and support fi
 ndings 
from previous studies16–18 that showed that surgical 
recurrence increases with the number of cigarettes 
smoked each day, and that smoking cessation reduces 
clinical and surgical recurrence. In the present study, 
treatment with mercaptopurine to delay or prevent 
postoperative recurrence was particularly eff
 ective in 
people who continue to smoke; thus, in smokers, 
thiopurine treatment seems to be justifi
 ed in the early 
postoperative period. In non-smokers, the data do not 
provide a suffi
  ciently strong rationale for immediate 
initiation of treatment in the postoperative period. 
A considered approach involving colonoscopy in the fi
 rst 
6–12 months is likely to be benefi
 cial in this group.
This study is one of the largest to report on endoscopic 
recurrence of Crohn’s disease, and is important for several 
reasons. First, the incidence of any endoscopic recurrence 
was 77% at 3 years, which is similar to the 85% reported 
previously.14 Second, over a 3-year period, there was a poor 
association between endoscopic and clinical recurrence. 
There are several possible explanations for this fi
 nding, 
and there is no consensus as to whether to prioritise 
clinical outcomes over endoscopic outcomes. Third, 
mercaptopurine seems to maintain complete endoscopic 
remission (i0), whereas using a cutoff
  score of at least i2 
to defi
 ne endoscopic recurrence revealed no diff
 erence 
between treatment and placebo groups. Fourth, our 
study is, to our knowledge, the largest comprehensive

assessment of faecal calprotectin in postoperative Crohn’s 
disease. Using a cutoff
  of 50 μg/g, the NPV for recurrence 
was 79·7%, which decreased to 75·5% by increasing the 
cutoff
  to 100 μg/g. The corresponding NPVs for the 
prediction of endoscopic remission were 81·4% and 
83·9%, respectively. If mucosal integrity is the goal, these 
values might not provide the confi
 dence to abandon 
endoscopic assessment. The performance of faecal 
calprotectin was poorer than reported in the POCER study 
(NPV of 94%).11 Reported diff
 erences between studies are 
probably due to diff
 erences in study methods, since in the 
POCER study, an endoscopic score of i2 was imputed for 
all missing values; no imputations were made in our study.
 
Several important factors should be considered when 
interpreting these fi
 ndings. Based on existing data, 
power calculations estimated a 20% diff
 erence between 
mercaptopurine and placebo groups. Clinical recurrence 
rates were 23·2% in the placebo group and 12·5% in the 
treatment group: a diff
 erence of 10·7%. These rates are 
lower than those in studies by Hanauer and colleagues19 
(50% treatment and 77% placebo) and Ardizzone and 
colleagues20 (17% treatment and 28% control), on which 
the power calculations were based. This marked 
diff
 erence between recurrence rates is probably a result of 
diff
 ering primary outcome defi
 nitions; clinical scoring 
systems advocated to identify disease relapse in clinical 
trials such as CDAI have fl
 aws, especially in the 
postoperative setting.21 We used an outcome that was 
based on a disease activity score (CDAI >150 and a 
100-point increase from baseline) and the need for 
medical treatment. In view of the diffi
  culties of using the 
CDAI postoperatively, we judged this defi
 nition of clinical 
recurrence to be robust. The Rutgeerts score attempts to 
make the assessment of endoscopic recurrence an 
objective exercise, but has never been prospectively 
validated.14 We selected a score of at least i2 as a secondary 
endpoint, in line with previous studies, including the 
study by Hanauer and colleagues.19 However, the 
limitations of this approach are well recognised; there is 
little diff
 erence between i1 (≤5 aphthous ulcers) and i2 
(>5 aphthous ulcers or larger lesions confi
 ned to the 
anastomosis), and inter-observer variation is an issue. 
In a substudy22 of the TOPPIC trial, inter-observer 
agreement on 43 endoscopic images was measured by 
fi
 ve investigators; complete agreement occurred in only 
79% of cases. Although centralised reading could 
overcome some of the inter-observer variation in 
endoscopic scoring in future studies, an alternative 
approach might be to regard complete mucosal healing as 
the preferred therapeutic target in Crohn’s disease, and to 
identify maintenance of endoscopic remission (i0) as the 
target in postoperative Crohn’s disease. A review of the 
scoring of endoscopic recurrence is warranted.
Optimum dosing in all patients was also diffi
  cult to 
achieve in the context of a double-blind study and 
a protocol-led dose adjustment strategy. Of the 
240 patients, 104 (43%) received treatment at the initial 
dose for the duration of the study. Data available at the end 
of the study show that about 60% of patients randomly 
assigned to mercaptopurine were on subtherapeutic 
doses, and a stronger treatment eff
 ect might have been 
noted had 6-thioguanine nucleotide results been available 
to optimise the dose during the study. The rates of 
discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal or loss to 
follow-up in this study are similar to those in previous 
work. For example, Ardizzone and colleagues20 reported 
treatment discontinuations owing to adverse events in 
15 (22%) of 69 patients in the azathioprine group versus 
six (9%) of 69 in the mesalazine group, although data on 
treatment discontinuation within other trials are not 
clearly documented. Analysis of these data was on an 
intention-to-treat basis and therefore the eff
 ect of the drug 
taken at full dose in an individual patient is likely to have 
been underestimated. In clinical practice, many patients 
taking thiopurines might be inadvertently under-dosed 
initially, but are identifi
 ed on the basis of mean corpuscular 
volumes or, more recently, available metabolite testing.23
 
Adverse events were noted frequently in both groups 
but were generally mild. Rates of pancreatitis and 
malignancy were lower than expected. Unusually for a 
clinical trial, we did not remove patients who became 
pregnant during the trial, in keeping with accepted 
clinical practice. We noted 14 pregnancies, with 12 healthy 
outcomes. No fetal malformations occurred in the 
mercaptopurine-treated group. Masked safety monitoring 
contributed to the validity of the results.
The strengths of this study include the double-blind 
design, the comparison of symptom scores with 
endoscopic fi
 ndings, the assessment of faecal calprotectin 
in a large number of patients in the postoperative 
setting, and a demonstration of the potential usefulness 
of 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations in patient 
management. The study also included patients from 
29 UK centres, both secondary and tertiary hospitals, 
which makes it  
generalisable beyond specialist centres. 
Limitations include the absence of therapeutic drug 
monitoring with dose adjustment, missing colonoscopy 
data in 20% of eligible patients, and the absence of 
centralised endoscopy reading. Furthermore, we included 
CDAI measurement within the primary outcome even 
though it has been previously criticised in this setting. 
The 36-item Short Form quality-of-life instrument 
underwent internal text changes at the time of trial 
start-up. The reporting of these results was deemed not to 
be compliant with 36-item Short Form licensing terms 
and these results are therefore not presented.
A defi
 nitive study of postoperative prevention of Crohn’s 
disease has proved diffi
  cult to undertake. The PREVENT 
study24 was terminated early because of small numbers of 
patients reaching the primary outcome. The PREVENT 
study24 had selective inclusion criteria, and no diff
 erence 
was reported in clinical relapse between those on 
infl
 iximab and those on placebo at week 76, although 
an endoscopic eff
 ect was noted. A smaller study25 that

compared early azathioprine initiation with azathioprine 
driven by endoscopic fi
 ndings at week 26 was stopped 
after 6 years because of slow recruitment, with no 
meaningful conclusions. Although our study was 
underpowered to detect the reported treatment eff
 ect, and 
many patients were under-dosed with mercaptopurine, 
our data nonetheless provide some evidence of effi
  cacy of 
mercaptopurine in the context of postoperative prevention. 
Indeed, a meta-analysis of these data with the two other 
randomised placebo-controlled trials of thiopurines in the 
postoperative setting16,19 shows a signifi
 cant reduction in 
postoperative clinical relapse at 12 months (relative risk 
0·57, 95% CI 0·38–0·85; appendix p 11). Taken with the 
other recent data, our study helps to make progress 
towards a treatment algorithm for all patients after 
surgery for Crohn’s disease, with smoking habit the key 
determinant aff
 ecting management.
Several areas now require further clinical studies, 
including putative mechanisms for the eff
 ect of 
smoking on Crohn’s disease,26 and smoking intervention 
studies. The effi
  cacy and safety of mercaptopurine 
compared with anti-tumour-necrosis-factor (TNF) as 
postoperative preventive treatment is a key issue to 
investigate. At present, anti-TNF treatment is reserved 
for patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to 
thiopurine, but the safety, effi
  cacy, and cost of these 
drugs is under continuous reassessment. Endoscopic 
fi
 ndings and faecal calprotectin remain important 
components of disease assessment, but the exact 
parameters that best defi
 ne postoperative recurrent 
disease remain to be elucidated.
