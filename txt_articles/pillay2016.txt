in the Public Sector of South Africa?

ABSTRACT
Purpose. This study was designed to understand the profiles of the patients who attended and chose to purchase spectacles
from the public sector eye clinics in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. Furthermore, we wished to explore patients’ perceptions
of the spectacle frames on offer and to understand the motivation of the patients in selecting their spectacle frames.
Methods. This descriptive study consented 674 patients from seven eye clinics in KwaZulu Natal. Each was interviewed
using a questionnaire containing open-ended, close-ended questions and questions with a Likert-scale response.
Results. Females comprised 68.4% of the study population. The majority of participants had not completed secondary
school or had no schooling (78.9%), were unemployed (70.9%), and earned less than R2000 per month or did not have any
form of income (89.2%). Of the 670 who chose to buy spectacles from the eye clinics, 79.4% indicated that this was
convenient (79.4%) and 23.0% said that they were motivated in their decision because they liked the available frames. More
than 95% of participants rated the design, quality, and price as good to excellent. Factors influencing their decisions in-
cluded design, recommendations from staff, and quality. Those who bought the spectacles from the budget range were
prepared to pay more for the next pair of spectacles, whereas almost all reported that they would return to the same eye
clinic for their next pair of spectacles and that they would recommend relatives and friends to the clinic.
Conclusions. The results from the study indicate that there is high acceptance by patients of the range of spectacles offered
in public sector eye clinics with specific suggestions to improve it. Increased understanding of the perceptions and mo-
tivations in spectacle choice will help inform planning and procurement decisions in supplying the needs of the patients and
broadening the patient base.

lobally, the burden of uncorrected refractive error is
significant,1,2 and literature suggests that it negatively
affects the quality of life, education, and employment
opportunities of an individual and detrimentally impacts on the
lives of their family and society.3 Spectacles are the simplest and
one of the most cost-effective eye care interventions, yet many
people are still unable to acquire them, as indicated by spectacle
coverage rates ranging from 0 to 22%, globally.4Y6 This low
uptake is caused, in part, by lack of affordability and restricted
access.7 Recognizing that government alone cannot fully meet the
needs of all its people, nonprofit organizations have become
involved. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, the Depart-
ment of Health provides refractive services whereas the nonprofit
sector provides affordable spectacles at a number of public health
hospitals and clinics.
As with any health service delivery model,8 we are concerned
with meeting the needs of patients, in our case, with respect to
spectacle quality, design, and price. Historically, lower price has
been the predominant focus in relation to supply,9 with less
consideration given to patients’ preferences around style and de-
sign and their confidence in the quality of the spectacle frame. In
addition, what constitutes adequate choice has not been yet been
explored. In the absence of us knowing and having an adequate
range, patients may be forced to resort to other more expensive
options or simply do without a pair.
A cross-subsidization strategy, which subsidizes spectacles for
the poorer patients through higher income generated from wealthier
patients, was applied to meet the needs of the patients. Although this
strategy improves affordability and accessibility,10 there is limited

 information that demonstrate its effectiveness without compro-
mising the needs of some patients. Also lacking are data to suggest
that patients purchasing the more expensive spectacles are having
their needs met. Although the existing literature indicates successful
cross subsidization in the delivery of refractive care and cataract
intervention,11,12 adequate understanding of the priorities patients
consider when making their purchases is lacking.
As the same range of spectacles is provided with the same pricing
for patients in the same way across the urban, semiurban, and rural
areas, it was important to learn whether a uniform approach was
meeting patients’ needs adequately and that no particular group was
being underserved because of their social setting. As low price
was the main consideration at the time of implementation of the
system, a limited range and low cost frames were offered to patients.
Implementation and evolution of the cross-subsidy scheme were
informed largely by our speculation as to needs of patients. To
adequately serve all patients, it is important to directly engage with
public sector patients to elicit their expectations and opinions.
Perceptions and key decision-making factors in the purchase of
spectacles were determined. It was also important to establish
whether patients across different social settings demonstrated the
same behavior.
METHODS
Study Setting
The study took place in the province of KZN, compris-
ing eThekwini, iLembe, Umzinyathi, Umgungundlovu, and
Uthungulu health districts. The study population was composed
of respondents who chose to purchase spectacles from eye clinics
in the public sector.
Sample Size Calculation
The study sample consisted of patients who chose to purchase
spectacles from eye clinics from November 2013 to December
2013 (1 month). To ensure adequate representation, the sample
included individuals from five health districts representing rural,
semiurban, and urban settings in KZN.
The method used for sampling takes into consideration the
monthly 15% new range spectacle incidence (clinical sales re-
ports, Brien Holden Vision Institute). For this study, the required
precision is 0.08%, the significance level was set at 5%, and the
initial sample size was 601. To account for nonresponse and re-
fusal, 10% of 601 is added to the original sample to make it 661
and further rounded up to 665.
For the pretesting of the study interviews, the quota sampling
technique was used to sample the population who were prescribed
spectacles. The sampling strategy estimated that 15% of patients
selected their spectacle frames from the new spectacle range.
Thirty respondents were interviewed to ensure statistical repre-
sentativeness in the pretesting.
We included all patients who visited the eye clinics who had
undergone refraction and needed spectacles for correction. We
excluded patients who had not undergone refraction or who had
undergone refraction but did not need spectacle correction (e.g.,
no refractive error or with ocular diseases). If a child was the
patient seeking refractive services, the child’s guardian/parent was
interviewed on behalf of the patient.
Study Method
We conducted face-to-face interviews in a separate room with
the selected respondents and categorized them into i) respondents
who chose to purchase spectacles from the budget frames, ii) re-
spondents who chose to purchase spectacles from the new range of
frames, and iii) respondents who did not choose to purchase any
spectacles. To ensure standardization and avoid bias in the results,
a written interview script was given to the interviewers and re-
spondents were presented with the same range of budget frames
and a new range of frames from which to choose.
We designed and pretested an isiZulu (local language) ques-
tionnaire, which included 6 open-ended and 13 close-ended
questions and 4 questions with responses with a 5-point Likert
scale. We recruited and trained two interviewers (a 2-day training)
on data collection techniques, including how to conduct in-
terviews, to ensure standardization. The six domains of the
questionnaire include i) demography; ii) perceptions on design,
quality, and pricing of the frames; iii) important factors in making
their purchasing decision; iv) reasons for choosing to buy spec-
tacles from the eye clinic; v) improvement on the spectacle range;
and vi) future patient prospect.
Data Management
To ensure that data quality was maintained, we performed
double data entering using the double data entry system. The data
were entered and transferred to the STATA 11 program (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL) for data cleaning and analysis. Data checks and
cleaning involved checking for completeness and consistency of
the data. In addition, all electronic data were anonymized, and
codes were derived to be used as record identifiers. Data were
analyzed in terms of frequencies (percentages) and represented in
tables and graphs. Significance level was set at 5%. Fisher exact
and W2 tests were used for bivariate analysis to test for associations,
and logistic regression was conducted for multivariate analysis.
To assist in verifying model specification, the Hosmer and
Lemeshow’s goodness-of-fit test and the link test were used,
resulting in W2 (8); p = 0.961 and z (0, 1); p = 0.961, respectively.
This showed that the model fits the data well because of the in-
significant results; however, the pseudo R-square was low (0.046).
For ordinal data, nptrend test was performed to ascertain their
statistical significances.
Ethical Considerations
Ethics approval was obtained from the Biomedical Research
Ethics Committee, University KwaZulu Natal. We sought in-
formed consent from all the participants after briefing them about
the study and informing them of their rights to refuse to partic-
ipate in the study or withdraw at any stage. Identities of the re-
spondents were kept anonymous and confidential. The interviews
were conducted in a separate room where only the interviewer and
the respondent were present. The study adhered to the principles
of Declaration of Helsinki involving human subjects.

 RESULTS
Demography
There were 674 participants interviewed of whom 31.6% (213)
were men and 68.4% (461) were women, with a median age of
53 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41 to 64 years). The majority
of the respondents (48.5%) indicated that they had completed
secondary school or primary schooling (39.5%). In addition,
70.9% (N = 478) of the respondents were unemployed, 89.1%
(N = 512) earned less than R2000 (equivalent to USD 167) per
month or did not have any form of income, and 93.5% (N = 630)
had less than six dependents.
The eye clinics were categorized into urban, semiurban, and
rural categories. The number of individuals included in each
category was 378 (56%), 222 (33%), and 74 (11%), respectively.
Of 674 individuals, 670 (99.4%) chose to buy spectacles from the
eye clinics visited. A detailed breakdown of the respondents’ de-
mographic profile is shown in Table 1.
Choices of Respondents
A budget range of frame packages that cost between R130 and
R460 (equivalent to USD 11 to 39) and the more expensive
ranges, which cost between R230 and R760 (equivalent to USD
19 to 63), were made available to the patients.
With regard to the types of frames purchased, 73.3% of the
participants indicated that they chose to buy the budget range and
26% chose the expensive range. The median price for previous
limited range of spectacles was R400 (equivalent to USD 33)
(IQR, R40 to R600; equivalent to IQR, USD 3.30 to 50).
A trend with regard to purchases of the expensive range by age
and income was also observed (nptrend, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002,
respectively). The expensive range was mainly chosen by those
who are at least 45 years of age. Participants from both age groups
45 to 59 years and 70 years and older were 3.3 times more likely to
buy from the expensive range compared with those 1 to 14 years
old (p = 0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively). Those who had income
R1 to R2000 is 1.8 times more likely to purchase from the ex-
pensive range (p = 0.02) compared with those who did not have
any income. The demographic characteristics and the purchases
are shown in Table 2.
The Reasons Respondents Made Their Choices
Most of the respondents (N = 532, 79.4%) reported that it was
convenient because it was a one stop for examination and dispensing,
and 23.0% reported that they liked the frames available, despite
knowing of other places where spectacles can be purchased. Only six
respondents (0.9%) did not know of other places where spectacles
could be purchased. In addition, 29 respondents (4.3%) reported
other reasons such as the person was referred to another place or
practitioner by the hospital or they wanted better-quality frames.
What Do They Think about the Spectacles Offered
in the Eye Clinics?
Before purchasing the spectacles, 98.8% (N = 662) of the re-
spondents were told about the different frame ranges available and
were asked about their perceptions in terms of the spectacle de-
sign, quality, and price. Table 3 shows that the majority of re-
spondents (985%) perceived the design, quality, and price as good
to excellent. More women than men perceived that the designs of
the frames were excellent and good (Fisher exact, p = 0.033),
whereas more participants who earned more than R5000 (equiva-
lent to USD 417) perceived that the quality of the frames were
excellent and good as compared with those who earned less (Fisher
exact, p = 0.005). In terms of price, more participants from the
semirural areas perceived that prices were excellent and good (Fisher
exact, p = 0.033).
How Respondents Make Their Choices
Factors most influencing the choice of a frame were noted
and are presented in Table 4. Respondents who reported a factor
that was ‘‘not important’’ in their decision making were asked
to give reasons for this response. One respondent indicated
that the design was not important; he or she was more con-
cerned with the practical aspect of a pair of spectacles in helping

the frame.
‘‘(I am) old (and) don’t care about the design.’’
Respondent, 60 years old, female
Quality was reported not important in the selection of spec-
tacles because they all seem to be of intermediate quality.
‘‘The spectacles are in plastic, and the quality looks intermediate.’’
Respondent, 20 years old, male
In addition, respondents reported that other factors such as
the improvement in their sight when wearing spectacles were
important.
How can we improve our spectacles?
Respondents also reported that the spectacles could be im-
proved if there was a need for improvement. About one-fifth of
respondents (N = 137 or 20.4%) reported that there was need
for improvement. Of the respondents who reported a need for
improvement, 9.5% requested a variety of colors, bigger sizes, and
a larger range from which to choose (Fig. 1).
Are They Happy to Come Back, Pay More,
and Recommend Others to the Clinic?
Of the 494 respondents who bought the budget frame, 78.9%
were prepared to pay more for their next pair of spectacles. In
addition, 98.2% (658 of 670) reported that they would return
to the same eye clinic for their next pair of spectacles, and 99.3%
(N = 664) reported that they would recommend relatives and
friends to the clinic (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the four in-
dividuals who did not buy spectacles reported that either designs
did not suit them or they would make a decision and return later.
DISCUSSION
Our aim was to explore the motivations, priorities, and key
decision-making factors of the patients in making spectacle frame
selections in public sector clinics and to apply this wealth of
knowledge to inform the procurement process. From the results, it

 was shown that there is a great need to develop a patient-centered
health delivery system.13
In our study, women made up 68% of the customer base. A
comparison between men and women showed that a higher per-
centage (27.8%; N = 178) of the expensive frames were chosen by
females (p = 0.203). Based on this, even though insignificant sta-
tistically, there is an indication that women may be placing greater
importance on the design and quality of the frames in comparison
with men (personal communication, clinic managers). Another
explanation may be that the range is not too attractive or distinct
enough from the other lower-priced ranges for the men to justify
paying a higher price. A strategy to address possible assumptions
would be to invest more in the designs for women and address the
needs for men by gradually introducing new styles and monitoring
the shift in purchase behavior thereafter. This strategy is important
to provide selections that are acceptable to the community because
the success of the investment will be reflected in the sales perfor-
mance.14 A further study may be necessary to establish if there are
improvements after changes are made to the procurement strategy.
The largest customer base was aged 30 years; with ages 45 to
74 years being the largest percentage of the participants who chose
to purchase from the expensive range, participants younger than
30 years had the highest unemployment rate and lower income.
These results demonstrate the importance of strengthening the
cross-subsidization strategy15 so that the income generated from
the expensive range can subsidize those who can only afford the
budget range. To effect improvement in eye care delivery, it is
essential to incorporate suggestions made by the respondents16: to
add frames of bigger sizes and more fashionable frames with more
options with respect to color. This was also evident from the
perceptions held by the participants, indicating that the design of
the frames should be more varied (Table 3).
It was also important to note that 25.5% of those who had an
income of less than R2000 (equivalent to USD 167) and 24.2% of
unemployed respondents chose to buy from the expensive range.
It can be explained that these respondents have alternate income
streams either from social grants or others, which allow them to
fully exercise their option to buy any frame they like, within the
ranges offered. Alternatively, it may be the case that, even with
limited income, respondents prioritized design and quality over
price and were willing to invest in their appearance. These results
clearly dispel the notion that lower-income groups would be very
price conscious and, when catering for this group, quality and
design should be treated as less of a priority. In fact, such as-
sumption, as was expressed by Pralahad and Hammond, ‘‘reflects
a narrow and largely outdated view of the developing world.’’17 It
is therefore imperative that adequate choice in price and designs be
provided in community-based programs aimed at serving the
lower-income population.
Those who earn R5000 (equivalent to USD 417) and more
made up the smallest group of respondents. This is likely to be
caused by the fact that people earning above this threshold are on
medical aid schemes, which enable them to access private health
services, often a more convenient option for them,18 which in-
volves less hassle, cost, effort, and time. Hence, we recommend
that decisions around procurement to meet the needs of this group
must be reassessed so that a better balance between price and
aesthetics and quality is achieved.

 It was interesting to note that patients aged 45 years and older
held design, quality, and brand as important factors when choosing
their spectacle frames more than the younger groups, with the ex-
ception of those between 1 and 14 years who were given a free pair
of spectacles. These results dismiss an often common perception
that older patients may place emphasis on more practical criteria
like price, especially in a country like South Africa, where many of
these patients experience daily financial challenges.

 It is also evident that rural patients rated brand as a more
important factor than patients in semirural and urban areas. It is
difficult to establish an underlying reason for this other than to
assume that semiurban and urban patients understood the real
financial costs associated with branded products and responded
from a more informed perspective.
Recommendations from clinic staff, especially for those 34 years
and older, are seen to be an important factor when choosing a
frame. This can be viewed from two perspectives. One, it is highly
likely that the respondents valued the professional opinion of the
staff who may have guided their choice from a clinical and practical
point of view. Two, the opinions given by the staff from a cosmetic
perspective may have strengthened the respondents’ confidence in
their choice, especially if no one else close to them was present to
offer suggestions. Noting the value that respondents placed on this
factor, it will be important for staff to understand the importance of
this, be trained to provide appropriate advice, and spend time
assisting patients with their choices. They should also pay attention
to the latest fashion trends in the community and inform the pro-
curement department appropriately. However, having the data

design, brand choice, and material.

 collected at the clinic may have created response bias because the
subjects might not be forthcoming with negative comments when
they have just received a service.
The results of this study clearly indicate that respondents choose
to buy what they find appealing and do not necessarily restrict
their options because of the price. This does not mean that they
may always be able to buy the spectacles they want but that
they are willing to perhaps prioritize differently where possible
to get want they want, and this may be a good reflection of the
success of a health system where patients are prioritizing eye
health.18 Alternatively, spectacles straddle health and fashion,
and the choice could be a reflection of the importance that
even poor communities place on fashion or appearances. This
behavior demonstrates that the rationale behind purchasing
decisions of lower-income group patients is similar to those as-
sumed for higher-income groups. Accordingly, there should be
no prejudice in servicing lower-income patients in providing a
variety of frames with varying price options available. However,
it should be noted that the more expensive frames in an NGO
program are often still cheaper than such options in the private
sector, and further research should be conducted to determine
what is the tipping point that will make fashion unaffordable to
this patient population.
The facts that the majority (995%) respondents indicated that
they would return to purchase another pair of spectacles and also
recommend the eye care service center to friends and family and
that 78.9% were prepared to pay more for the next pair of
spectacles indicate that it is necessary to continue to meet their
needs appropriately and continue to invest in the operation to
service this population.
Overall, the views expressed by the patients were positive. The
results were useful and informative, and we recommend further
investment in the female designs and that the needs for males are
addressed by introducing new styles and thereafter monitoring the
shift in purchasing behavior. It is also important to continue to
strengthen the cross-subsidization strategy so that the income
generated from the expensive range can subsidize those who can
only afford the budget range. This can be achieved by ensuring a
better balance between price, aesthetics, and quality, which will be
addressed through the procurement process.
