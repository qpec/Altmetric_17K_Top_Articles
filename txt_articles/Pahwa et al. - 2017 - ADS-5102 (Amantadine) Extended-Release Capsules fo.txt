IMPORTANCE Medical treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson disease
(PD) is an unmet need.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended-release
274-mg capsules for treatment of LID in patients with PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial was conducted between May 7, 2014, and July 22, 2015, at 44 North American sites
among patients with PD treated with levodopa who experienced at least 1 hour of
troublesome dyskinesia per day with at least mild functional impact.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 274 mg of ADS-5102
administered orally at bedtime for up to 25 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy analysis was the change from baseline
to week 12 in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale total score for ADS-5102 vs placebo in the
modified intent-to-treat population. OFF time (amount of time the PD medication is not
controlling motor symptoms) was a key secondary end point. Safety analyses included all
patients who received the study drug (ADS-5102 or placebo).
RESULTS A total of 189 patients were screened, and 126 were randomized; the modified
intent-to-treat population included 121 patients (51 women and 70 men; mean [SD] age,
64.7 [9.1] years). At week 12, the least-squares mean (SE) change in the Unified Dyskinesia
Rating Scale score was –15.9 (1.6) for ADS-5102 (n = 63) and –8.0 (1.6) for placebo (n = 58)
(treatment difference, –7.9; 95% CI, –12.5 to –3.3; P < .001). OFF time decreased by a mean
(SE) of 0.6 (0.3) hours for ADS-5102 and increased by 0.3 (0.3) hours for placebo (treatment
difference, –0.9 hours; 95% CI, –1.6 to –0.2; P = .02). Common adverse events for ADS-5102
vs placebo included visual hallucinations (15 [23.8%] vs 1 [1.7%]), peripheral edema
(15 [23.8%] vs 0), and dizziness (14 [22.2%] vs 0). Adverse events led to treatment
discontinuation for 13 patients receiving ADS-5102 (20.6%) vs 4 patients receiving placebo
(6.9%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE ADS-5102, 274 mg at bedtime, may be an effective treatment
for LID. An additional benefit is reduced OFF time. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an oral treatment reducing both LID and OFF time in patients with PD with
dyskinesia.

 T
he medical treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia
(LID) in Parkinson disease (PD) is an unmet need. There
is no approved drug therapy for LID, which impairs ac-
tivities of daily living, decreases quality of life, increases care-
giver burden and health care use, and is associated with a
higher risk for falls.1-4 Levodopa remains the most effica-
cious treatment for motor symptoms of PD; however, long-
term treatment with levodopa often leads to the develop-
ment of dyskinesia. For patients treated with levodopa,
dyskinesia can develop early and affects nearly 90% of pa-
tients within approximately 10 years of treatment.5
Immediate-release amantadine hydrochloride (amanta-
dine IR) was originally approved for influenza, with an addi-
tional indication for parkinsonism. Several small studies sug-
gest that amantadine IR may have an antidyskinetic effect6-12;
however, the drug has not been extensively studied in well-
controlledclinicaltrials,andthedurabilityofitseffecthasbeen
disputed.8,11,13,14 The safety profile of amantadine IR has been
well characterized.8,15 Although most patients with PD can tol-
erate amantadine IR doses of 81 to 161 mg daily (equivalent to
100to200mgdailyofamantadinehydrochloride),16thehigher
doses that may produce an antidyskinetic effect are associ-
ated with increased frequency of central nervous system ad-
verse events (AEs).6,8,10,15
ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended-release capsules are in
development for the treatment of LID. ADS-5102 is adminis-
tered at bedtime and is specifically formulated such that the
shapeoftheresultingplasmaconcentration–timecurveischar-
acterized by an initially slow increase during sleep, peak con-
centrations in the morning, and sustained concentrations
throughoutwakinghours,whenpatientsmostneedrelieffrom
dyskinesia. In the dose-finding study of ADS-5102, the 274-mg
dose (340 mg of amantadine hydrochloride) provided the best
benefit and risk profile.17 The present study was designed to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of 274 mg of ADS-5102 once
daily at bedtime for the treatment of LID in patients with PD.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Aphase3,randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlledclini-
cal trial (ADS-5102 Extended Release Capsules for the Treat-
ment of Levodopa Induced Dyskinesia [EASE LID] Study, Ad-
amas Pharmaceuticals Inc, ADS-AMT-PD301) was conducted
at 44 North American sites. The complete trial protocol can be
found in Supplement 1. The study was conducted in accor-
dancewiththeDeclarationofHelsinki18andGoodClinicalPrac-
ticeGuidelines.Beforeinitiatingthestudy,allparticipatingsites
received institutional review board approval. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all study participants be-
fore any study-related procedures were performed.
Keyinclusioncriteriawereasfollows:patientswithPDtak-
ing levodopa; age between 30 and 85 years; diagnosis of PD

day 1. Antiparkinsonian medications, including levodopa
preparations, were to be unchanged for at least 30 days be-
forescreeningandduringstudyparticipation.Levodopaprepa-
rations had to be administered at least 3 times daily.
Key exclusion criteria included the following: history of

clonic, dystonic, or akathetic without peak-dose dyskinesia;
neurosurgical intervention related to PD; atypical parkinson-
ism; levodopa- or dopamine agonist–induced psychosis; cog-

Randomization and Blinding
Between May 7, 2014, and July 22, 2015, eligible patients
were randomized on day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or
ADS-5102. ADS-5102 and placebo capsules and packaging
were identical in appearance. The randomization list was
generated and validated by PharmaStat, LLC. Randomization
was accomplished through an interactive web-based re-
sponse system managed by Endpoint Clinical, which allowed

Key Points
Question Are 274-mg ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended-release
capsules safe and effective for the treatment of levodopa-induced
dyskinesia in Parkinson disease?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, ADS-5102 was
associated with a significantly greater reduction in the duration,
severity, and impact of dyskinesia at 12 weeks compared with
placebo, as measured by the least-squares mean change in the
Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale score (treatment difference, –7.9);
this reduction in the duration, severity, and impact of dyskinesia
was maintained through week 24 (treatment difference, –9.3).
Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation for 13 of 63
patients receiving ADS-5102 (20.6%) vs 4 of 58 patients receiving
placebo (6.9%).
Meaning ADS-5102 may be an effective treatment for
levodopa-induced dyskinesia.

 site personnel, raters, the sponsor, and contract research or-
ganization staff were blinded to group assignment.
Procedures
Prequalified raters completed training using the MDS teach-
ing modules for the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS)
and the MDS-UPDRS. Each assessment was at least 30 min-
utesafterthepatient’
sregularlyscheduledlevodopadose,dur-
ing ON time when the patient was experiencing typical dys-
kinesia.Therewere11scheduledvisits(screening;baseline[day
1]; weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 25; and a safety follow-up).
The study was originally designed as a 13-week trial. Based
on a regulatory health authority recommendation, the proto-
col was amended to increase the treatment duration to 25
weeks to characterize the durability of effect.
During the screening visit (up to 3 weeks before base-
line), written informed consent was obtained and study eligi-
bility criteria were assessed. Patient training in filling out the
PD home diary was completed, and diary concordance test-
ing (between patient and rater) was performed. Two 24-hour
PD home diaries were distributed for completion just before
the scheduled baseline visit. During the baseline visit, eligi-
bility was confirmed and patients were randomized to re-
ceive ADS-5102 or placebo. In addition, the following assess-
ments associated with efficacy were performed: completion
of the UDysRS and MDS-UPDRS, review of completed PD home
diaries, and recording of investigator notes relevant to the Cli-
nician’
s Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale.22
During the first week of treatment, patients randomized
to receive ADS-5102 received a daily ADS-5102 dose of 137 mg.
To maintain blinding, patients took 1 capsule containing
ADS-5102 and 1 capsule containing placebo. During weeks 2
through 24, the daily ADS-5102 dose was increased to 274 mg,
administered as two 137-mg capsules. During the last week of
dosing, the dosage was reduced back to 137 mg daily. Patients
randomized to receive placebo were given 2 placebo capsules
for 25 weeks.
The UDysRS, MDS-UPDRS, CGIC, and standard safety as-
sessments were performed at weeks 2, 8, 12, 18, and 24. The
PD home diaries were completed before each of these visits.
A final safety follow-up visit occurred approximately 7 days
followingtreatmentcompletion,unlessapatientelectedtoen-
roll directly into a companion open-label safety study (Clini-
calTrials.gov identifier: NCT02202551).
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline
in the UDysRS total score at 12 weeks. Key secondary out-
come measures included the change from baseline in the
UDysRS total score at 24 weeks, ON time without trouble-
some dyskinesia (ON time without dyskinesia plus ON time
with nontroublesome dyskinesia) at 12 and 24 weeks, and OFF
time (amount of time the PD medication is not controlling mo-
tor symptoms) at 12 and 24 weeks. Other secondary mea-
sures included the change from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks
in the MDS-UPDRS score, ON time with troublesome dyskine-
sia, total ON time with dyskinesia (nontroublesome plus
troublesome), and the CGIC score. Safety assessments in-
cluded AEs, reasons for discontinuation, physical examina-
tions, vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing.
Statistical Analysis
Based on the previous phase 2/3 study,17 46 patients per group
were expected to provide 90% power to detect a mean (SD)
treatment difference of 9.5 (14.0) units between the ADS-5102
and placebo groups, with α = .05. To account for a potential
dropout rate of up to 20% at 12 weeks, 120 patients (60 per
group) were planned for randomization.
The primary efficacy analysis compared the active (274 mg
of ADS-5102) group with the placebo group at week 12 using a
linear mixed model with repeated measures, with the changes
from baseline in the UDysRS total score at weeks 2, 8, and 12
as the dependent variable. The model included categorical ef-
fects for treatment group, visit, and the interaction between
treatment group and visit, and baseline UDysRS total score as
a covariate. Estimates for the least-squares mean change were
provided with 95% CIs.
The key secondary analyses were conducted using a fixed-
sequence hierarchical procedure to control the overall level of
significance. A specified comparison was considered confir-
matory only if the primary efficacy analysis and all previously
conducted key secondary analyses were statistically signifi-
cant at P < .05.
The modified intent-to-treat population was the prespeci-
fied efficacy analysis population and included randomized pa-
tients who received treatment and provided 1 or more post-
baseline assessments of the UDysRS. The safety population
included randomized patients who received 1 or more doses
ofthestudydrug.Asynchronizedtimeprofileanalysiswasgen-
erated displaying the percentages of patients reporting a given
PD home diary state. Software package SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc), was used for analysis. A data monitoring com-
mittee was not used for this trial.
This study was stopped early by the sponsor to accelerate
the availability of primary efficacy data to permit timely sub-
mission of these data to the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion. All randomized patients had the opportunity to complete
their week 12 study visit. A priori study power was preserved
fortheprimaryanalysisbecause103patientscontributedweek
12 efficacy data. At the time the study was stopped, consider-
ation was also given to having a sufficient number of patients
contributeweek24efficacydata(n = 84)toallowadequatesta-
tistical power (at least 80%) for treatment comparisons at this
point to characterize the durability of effect beyond 12 weeks.

Results
Atotalof189patientswerescreened,and126patientswereran-
domized (Figure 1). The most common reason for failure to be
randomized (24 of 63 total) was that the patient did not report
at least 2 half-hour ON time periods with troublesome dyski-
nesia at baseline. The modified intent-to-treat population
included 121 patients; 5 patients receiving placebo were ex-

pared with the placebo group (ON time without troublesome

weeks, 3.6 [0.4] vs 1.4 [0.5] hours; OFF time: at 12 weeks, –0.6

hours) (Table 2). Mean changes in PD diary end points at all
study visits for the ADS-5102 and placebo groups are shown
in Figure 2B. A summary of diary states across waking hours
showedagreaterincreaseinONtimewithouttroublesomedys-
kinesia due to a decrease in OFF and ON times with trouble-
some dyskinesia for the ADS-5102–treated patients com-
pared with the patients receiving placebo (eFigures 2 and 3 in
Supplement 2).
At weeks 12 and 24, there were no differences between the
ADS-5102 and placebo groups in MDS-UPDRS (in the ON state)
combined or individual scores (parts I, II, and III), suggesting
that ADS-5102 does not worsen PD motor function (Table 2).
The CGIC results showed that 51 of the 63 patients (81.0%) in
the ADS-5102 group and 21 of 58 patients (36.2%) in the pla-
cebo group were assessed as improved in overall PD symp-
toms, including dyskinesia, at week 12 (P < .001 for overall dis-
tribution). Furthermore, 43 patients (68.3%) in the ADS-5102
group and 27 of 58 patients (46.6%) in the placebo group were
assessedasimprovedfrombaselineatweek24(P = .11forover-
all distribution).
Overall, AEs were reported for 56 of 63 patients (88.9%)
in the ADS-5102 group and 36 of 60 patients (60.0%) in the
placebo group (Table 3). Most patients in both groups
reported AEs that were mild to moderate in intensity (43
[68.3%] in the ADS-5102 group and 32 [53.3%] in the placebo
group). The most common AEs (≥5% in the active arm)
included visual hallucinations, peripheral edema, dizziness,
dry mouth, and constipation (Table 3). Other AEs occurring
in less than 5% of patients in the ADS-5102 group included
nausea (3 [4.8%]), confusion (2 [3.2%]), and orthostatic hypo-
tension (1 [1.6%]). There were no reports of impulse control
disorder in the ADS-5102 group. No serious AEs associated
with the study drug were reported. There was 1 death in the
ADS-5102 group; the investigator reported this as not associ-
ated with study drug and attributed the event to advanced
PD. Adverse events broken down by time of onset are listed
in the eTable in Supplement 2.
Fifteen patients (23.8%) in the ADS-5102 group and 1 pa-
tient in the placebo group reported visual hallucinations. For

 patients experienced auditory hallucinations, while 3 addi-
tional patients experienced only auditory hallucinations. In
total, 18 patients (28.6%) in the ADS-5102 group experienced
a hallucination of any type.
Thirteen patients (20.6%) in the ADS-5102 group and 4 pa-
tients (6.7%) in the placebo group discontinued the study drug
because of AEs. The most common AEs leading to treatment
discontinuation in the ADS-5102 group were visual hallucina-
tions (5 [7.9%]), peripheral edema (3 [4.8%]), and dry mouth
(3 [4.8%]). Within the ADS-5102 group, 10 of the 13 patients
who discontinued treatment because of AEs did so during the
first month of treatment. For 3 patients, a dose reduction to
137 mg at bedtime was allowed because of AEs. In general, vi-
tal signs and laboratory test results remained consistent with
baseline values and were similar between treatment groups
throughout the study.
Discussion
ADS-5102 is a high-dose amantadine administered once daily
at bedtime with a slow initial increase in amantadine concen-
trations and a prolonged time to reach the maximum concen-
tration.ADS-5102providescontinuouscoveragethroughoutthe
day to alleviate LID, with high plasma concentrations (approxi-
mately 1500 ng/mL) that cannot be achieved with conven-
tional dosing (100 mg 2 or 3 times daily) with amantadine IR.17
This study demonstrates that bedtime administration of
274 mg of ADS-5102 reduces the duration, severity, and im-
pact of LID, as assessed by multiple outcome measures
(UDysRS, MDS-UPDRS, PD home diary, and CGIC). ADS-5102–
associated reduction in LID was evident at the first UDysRS as-
sessmentatweek2andwasmaintainedthroughweek24.More
important, this reduction in the duration, severity, and imp-
lact of LID was achieved without worsening of underlying con-
trolofPD,asassessedbytheMDS-UPDRScombinedscore(parts
I, II, and III). The significant decrease in mean ON time with
troublesome dyskinesia (as assessed by patient-completed PD
diaries) supports the clinical relevance of the mean change in
the UDysRS total score for a reduction in the duration, sever-
ity, and impact of LID. Diary assessments also demonstrated
a reduction of almost 1 hour in OFF time at week 12 in the
ADS-5102 group compared with the placebo group. The re-
duction in ON time with troublesome dyskinesia and OFF time
resulted in a significant increase in ON time without trouble-
some dyskinesia. More important, the benefit of ADS-5102 was
achieved without affecting the duration of sleep.
The most common AEs with ADS-5102 treatment were
largely consistent with its N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor an-
tagonist activity (eg, hallucinations and dizziness) and anti-
cholinergic activity (eg, dry mouth and constipation). Hallu-
cinations,themostcommonlyobservedclinicallyrelevantAEs,
were mostly mild and reversible and did not require interven-
tion or lead to study drug discontinuation. Therefore, these
events did not constitute irreversible morbidity. Other risk fac-
tors for hallucinations in PD include disease progression, ad-
vancing age, cognitive impairment, comorbidities, daytime
somnolence, sleep disorders, decreased visual acuity, and con-
comitantmedications.23PatientstreatedwithADS-5102should
be observed for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout
treatment, especially at initiation and after dose increases. The
use of ADS-5102 for patients with a history of clinically signifi-
cant hallucinations has not been studied, to our knowledge.
Limitations
One limitation of this study was the decision to stop the study
early, decreasing the number of patients contributing to the
secondary end-point assessments at week 24. However, this
