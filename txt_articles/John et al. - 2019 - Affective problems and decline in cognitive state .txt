Abstract
Evidence suggests that affective problems, such as depression and anxiety, increase risk for
late-life dementia. However, the extent to which affective problems influence cognitive decline,
even many years prior to clinical diagnosis of dementia, is not clear. The present study sys-
tematically reviews and synthesises the evidence for the association between affective problems
and decline in cognitive state (i.e., decline in non-specific cognitive function) in older adults.
An electronic search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect was conducted to
identify studies of the association between depression and anxiety separately and decline in
cognitive state. Key inclusion criteria were prospective, longitudinal designs with a minimum
follow-up period of 1 year. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment using the
STROBE checklist were conducted independently by two raters. A total of 34 studies (n = 71
244) met eligibility criteria, with 32 studies measuring depression (n = 68 793), and five meas-
uring anxiety (n = 4698). A multi-level meta-analysis revealed that depression assessed as a
binary predictor (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.76, p = 0.02) or a continuous predictor (B =
−0.008, 95% CI −0.015 to −0.002, p = 0.012; OR 0.992, 95% CI 0.985–0.998) was significantly
associated with decline in cognitive state. The number of anxiety studies was insufficient for
meta-analysis, and they are described in a narrative review. Results of the present study
improve current understanding of the temporal nature of the association between affective
problems and decline in cognitive state. They also suggest that cognitive function may need
to be monitored closely in individuals with affective disorders, as these individuals may be
at particular risk of greater cognitive decline.
Introduction
Decline in cognitive state is a central feature of ageing, and severe deterioration in cognitive
function has frequently been associated with poorer quality of life and worse performance
on physical tasks (Tabbarah et al., 2002). Accelerated decline in cognitive state also has an
influential and adverse impact upon the psychological, social, emotional and financial status
of the individual, which can subsequently contribute to heightened levels of burden and dis-
tress (Wilson et al., 2007). Cognitive symptoms are common in affective disorders, particularly
impairments in memory, executive control, feedback sensitivity and affective processing (Clark
et al., 2009). These cognitive symptoms are associated with pathophysiology across a distrib-
uted neural circuit, which is made up of various regions across the prefrontal cortex, as well as
subcortical regions and also temporal lobe structures (Clark et al., 2009). Both affective disor-
ders, such as depression and anxiety, and poor cognitive function are common in older adult-
hood (Rovner et al., 1989; Alexopoulos and Abrams, 1991). It is estimated that after age 70, the
combination of low mood and poor cognition doubles with every 5 years. By age 85, around
one in four of individual experience both these comorbid conditions (Arve et al., 1999). Due to
the high prevalence of these conditions in older adulthood, this is a research area of clinical
relevance and importance.
Previous research has proposed that affective problems, such as depression and anxiety,
may be associated with accelerated cognitive ageing (da Silva et al., 2013; Gulpers et al.,
2016). However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of this link. For instance,
the precise temporal order of the association between affective problems and decline in cog-
nitive state is currently unclear. It is possible that affective problems may act as an early
risk factor for decline in cognitive state, or alternatively that affective problems may be a pro-
dromal symptom of oncoming cognitive impairment. Additionally, previous studies, including
several meta-analyses, have been largely diagnosis driven, with a primary focus on dementia as
an outcome (Jorm, 2001; Ownby et al., 2006; Byers and Yaffe, 2011; da Silva et al., 2013;
Bennett and Thomas, 2014; Cherbuin et al., 2015). Less is known about the impact of affective
problems on decline in cognitive state across the entire population spectrum. The focus on the

 transition to dementia as an outcome may be problematic, as it is
now believed that there is a long pre-clinical period of several dec-
ades before cognitive impairment becomes evident (Morris,
2005). It is possible that participants who transition to dementia
at follow-up assessment may have already developed substantial
cerebral pathology by the time of baseline assessment, even if
they were not yet presented with any cognitive symptoms. In
this case, associations between affective disorders and develop-
ment of dementia may be the result of reverse causality. The pre-
sent study focuses on the association between affective disorders
and decline in cognitive state in healthy older adults in order to
minimise effects of possible reverse causality.
Cognitive state refers to a composite measure of overall cogni-
tive function. It has been studied extensively in previous research
(Nordin et al., 2006; Kavé et al., 2008; Sohrabi et al., 2008;
Esslinger et al., 2011), using assessments of overall cognitive sta-
tus, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or com-
posite assessments of multiple cognitive domains (e.g. memory,
information processing speed, executive function). Therefore,
decline in cognitive state is defined in the present review as a
decline in overall cognitive function, rather than decline in spe-
cific cognitive domains. There is evidence from longitudinal
research that low scores on cognitive state tests may predict
onset of functional impairment (Moritz et al., 1995; Gill et al.,
1996), and functional dependence over time (Agüero-Torres
et al., 2002; Gill et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002). For this reason,
it is important to investigate how affective problems influence
decline in cognitive state over time.
There are large individual differences in the extent of cognitive
decline experienced by healthy older adults; however, the decline
in cognitive state occurs at a steady and gradual rate over time. On
average there is a decline of around 1–2 standard deviations in
fluid cognition from age 20 to 70, after which average decline
increases to around 0.5 S.D. every 10 years (Anstey and Low,
2004). This stable decline is often maintained over time until
symptoms of dementia begin to manifest, at which point a
sharper decline in cognitive state may be observed (Rubin et al.,
1998). As such, studies in which substantial cognitive decline is
apparent within a short time frame of under 1 year may be
more indicative of pathological ageing (e.g. oncoming dementia),
rather than healthy ageing. Since the present study aims to exam-
ine the longitudinal association between affective disorders and
decline in cognitive state in cognitively healthy individuals, it
includes only longitudinal studies with sufficient time between
baseline and follow-up assessments (i.e., minimum 1 year) for a
substantial decline to occur within these populations. There are
several studies that have investigated the association between
affective problems and decline in cognitive state (Bassuk et al.,
1998; Geerlings et al., 2000; Paterniti et al., 2002; Ganguli et al.,
2006; Reyes-Ortiz et al., 2008; Köhler et al., 2010; Bunce
et al., 2012; Gale et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Neubauer
et al., 2013; Royall and Palmer, 2013; Rajan et al., 2014; Chang
and Tsai, 2015, Chen and Chang, 2016; Brailean et al., 2017).
However, it is difficult to draw a straightforward conclusion
from this work due to conflicting findings. Specifically, some
studies report a significant association between affective problems
and decline in cognitive state (Geerlings et al., 2000; Paterniti
et al., 2002; Reyes-Ortiz et al., 2008; Köhler et al., 2010;
Johnson et al., 2013; Royall and Palmer, 2013; Rajan et al.,
2014; Chang and Tsai, 2015, Chen and Chang, 2016), while con-
versely others report that affective problems do not predict decline
(Bassuk et al., 1998; Ganguli et al., 2006; Bunce et al., 2012; Gale
et al., 2012; Neubauer et al., 2013; Brailean et al., 2017). These
contradictory results are likely attributable to inconsistencies in
methodologies and study design, such as length of follow-up,
sampling, definitions used, differences in assessment tools and
also the primary aim of each study (Bennett and Thomas,
2014). To date, however, there have been no systematic reviews
or meta-analyses addressing associations between affective pro-
blems and subsequent decline in cognitive state, prior to the
onset of dementia. Due to inconsistencies in findings, as well as
the lack of attempts to synthesise these data, it is still unclear
whether affective problems across the life course are associated
with a decline in cognitive state, prior to the onset of dementia
and cognitive impairment. The primary aim of the present
study therefore was to systematically review and synthesise current
evidence regarding the longitudinal association between affective
problems (depression and anxiety separately) and subsequent
decline in cognitive state, with consideration of several potential
moderators, including mean age of sample at baseline, length of
follow-up, quality of study and publication year.
Method
Search strategy
This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). A systematic literature
search was conducted using PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane, and
ScienceDirect databases for studies investigating the association
between affective problems and decline in cognitive state. All stud-
ies published up to November 2016 were included in the search.
There was no restriction on the start date. Our search terms com-
prised three search blocks (Table 1). The first search block included
keywords relating to affective problems. The second search block
contained keywords describing the decline in cognitive state. To
reduce the number of irrelevant hits, a third search block was
added, which contained keywords related to methodology, to ensure
all studies with cross-sectional designs were excluded from search
results. In addition, reference lists of relevant papers were scanned
for articles of interest.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to articles
identified through the initial search.
Design criteria
Original studies written in English up to November 2016 were
included. Only studies using longitudinal, prospective designs
with human participants were included in order to test for the asso-
ciation between affective disorders and decline in cognitive state
over time. Cross-sectional, case-control, experimental, including
intervention and treatment, studies were excluded. Studies with a
follow-up period of 1 year or greater were included, as it is possible
that substantial decline in cognitive state may not be observed over
very short follow-up periods in a general population. Included
studies used samples drawn from a general population, whereas
studies using specific clinical populations only, for example, a sam-
ple of stroke patients, were excluded. This criterion was used
because inclusion of clinical samples may increase the heterogen-
eity of data synthesis and reduce the comparability of studies.

 Studies with a sample size of 100 or less were also considered ineli-
gible, due to insufficient statistical power.
Outcome-related criteria
Samples with cognitive impairment or dementia present at base-
line were excluded. In addition to this, studies with any measure
of change in cognitive state from baseline to follow-up were
selected for inclusion. Other outcomes, such as the transition to
dementia or cognitive performance at follow-up without con-
sideration of change from a baseline measure were omitted.
This was because the present study aimed to look at the associ-
ation between affective disorders and cognitive decline within
healthy ageing populations, rather than samples with dementia.
Additionally, studies assessing specific cognitive domains, such
as attention or visuospatial ability exclusively, rather than cogni-
tive state, were also excluded to reduce heterogeneity.
Predictor-related criteria
Both diagnostic and dimensional measures of depression and
anxiety at baseline assessment were judged as eligible. Studies
with retrospective assessments of affective problems were excluded,
as such assessments may be less reliable. Both binary indicators of
affective problems, defined as either a diagnosis or as a score above
a threshold level, or continuous symptoms scores, as assessed by a
validated scale of affective problems were included in this review.
Screening procedure
All articles identified through our search strategy were screened
for eligibility using a three-step process. All references were first
reviewed by title. Next, the remaining references were screened
by abstract. Finally, all remaining articles were read in full and
final eligibility determinations were made on this basis. All arti-
cles were reviewed for inclusion by one rater, and 10% of all arti-
cles were additionally screened by an independent rater, in order
to assess the consistency of screening. Any disagreements were
resolved during consensus meetings.
Data extraction
Data from the relevant articles were extracted using a detailed
coding form. Information extracted included: Study information
(Authors, publication year, DOI); Sample information (Country,
mean age at baseline, gender composition, ethnicity, year of
data collection, number of follow-ups, time between lags, total
length of follow-up, sample size at baseline, sample size at final
follow-up); Instrument information (Type of affective problem,
measure used to assess affective problem, measure used to assess
decline in cognitive state); Statistical information (Statistical test
used, effect sizes, covariates adjusted for in statistical model).
Where results for more than one follow-up were reported, the
longest follow-up was selected for our analysis, as longer
follow-up times allow a greater period for the decline in cognitive
state to occur. Similarly, where multiple models were reported
with various adjustments made, the most conservative model
(with the greatest amount of adjustments) was selected. In cases
where insufficient statistical information was available, original
authors were contacted directly via email. All studies were evalu-
ated for methodological quality using STROBE (Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guide-
lines (Elm et al., 2007).
Statistical analysis and data synthesis
All analyses were conducted in R Studio (Studio, 2012), using the
metafor package. Separate meta-analyses were run for studies in
which affective problems were assessed as a binary predictor
(using a defined threshold), and studies where affective problems
were assessed as a continuous predictor (using a symptom score).
In addition, separate analyses were conducted for studies that used
depression or anxiety as predictors of decline in cognitive state.
Odds ratios (ORs) were used as a common effect size across
studies with a binary measure of affective problems. When ORs
were not reported in original studies, these were estimated from
available data using standard computational techniques (Lipsey
and Wilson, 2000; Borenstein et al., 2009; Field and Gillett,
2010). Log ORs were then computed for subsequent analysis.
Standardised regression coefficients were used as a common effect
size across studies with a continuous measure of affective pro-
blems. If unstandardised effect sizes were reported, or measures
were not standardised to a z score before analysis, coefficients
were converted to standardised coefficients using standard com-
putational methods (Kim and Ferree, 1981; Duncan, 2014). In
cases where insufficient information was reported in the study
to calculate the standardised coefficients, authors were contacted
directly via email. We also converted the estimated regression
coefficients into ORs to facilitate the comparison with the ana-
lyses using a binary predictor of depression.
Multi-level meta-analyses were conducted to account for mul-
tiple effect sizes within studies (Van Den Noortgate and Onghena,
2003). Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Q stat-
istic, with p < 0.1 suggesting significant heterogeneity between

 studies, and the I2 statistic, in which 25, 50 and 75% represent
low, medium and high heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2003).
Additional meta-regression analyses were also conducted to
assess the effects of potential moderators, including the length
of follow-up, age of sample at baseline, publication year, method
of affective problem assessment (diagnosis or self-report) and
quality of studies. All moderators were entered initially as con-
tinuous variables, except for the assessment method of affective
problems which was coded as a binary variable. For significant
moderators, binary variables were created using the average values
and sub-group analyses were run using these variables.
Publication bias was assessed using Begg’s funnel plot and
Begg’s rank correlation test (Richard and Pillemer, 1984; Song
et al., 2000; Egger et al., 2008).
Results
Literature search
Our search identified 25 844 references. After exclusion of dupli-
cates, 20 954 unique citations remained. At stage 1, citations were
screened by title and 981 were determined to be eligible (inter-
rater reliability = 96%). In stage 2, remaining citations were
screened by abstract and 185 were judged as relevant (inter-rater
reliability = 91%). Finally, all 185 citations were selected for full-
text screening, after which 84 references remained (inter-rater
reliability = 94%). At this stage, a further 36 studies were excluded,
as they were addressing the decline in specific cognitive outcomes,
rather than cognitive state. Of the 48 studies remaining, initially
there were 18 with insufficient information for calculation of
effect sizes. Authors were contacted directly by email about
this and four (22%) responded to provide the relevant informa-
tion. This left a total of 34 studies with sufficient information
to calculate effect sizes, with 32 studies investigating the link
between depression and a decline in cognitive state (n = 68 793),
and five studies investigating anxiety and decline in cognitive
state (n = 4698; Fig. 1 and Table 2).
Depression studies
Of the depression studies, 17 used a binary measure of depression
(k = 34) and 16 measured depression as a continuous variable
(k = 36). Depression studies had a mean follow-up length of
approximately 6.61 years (S.D. = 4.41). The mean age of partici-
pants was 72.15 at baseline (S.D. = 7.56) and the gender compos-
ition of the sample was approximately 59.48% female. The
majority of studies took place in the USA (n = 14), followed by
the Netherlands (n = 4) and Taiwan (n = 3). Studies also took
place in Australia, Canada, France (n = 2 for each), Germany,
England,
Italy,
Singapore
and
Japan,
Hawaii
and
the
mainland-USA (n = 1 for each). Overall, the majority of studies
used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) to assess depression present at baseline (n = 16), fol-
lowed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (n = 7), the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) (n = 3), the Neuroticism
scale from the NEO Personality Inventory, the Duke Depression
Evaluation Schedule (DDES), the Goldberg Depression Scale,
Fig. 1. Flowchart of selection.
Note: *One study assessed both binary and continuous
assessments of depression, meaning that although there
are 17 studies using binary measures of depression and 16
studies using continuous measures of depression, in total
there are only 32 studies reporting on depression and cogni-
tive decline.

Only one study reported separate effect sizes for more than one
follow-up period (Bassuk et al., 1998). This study reported effect
sizes at 3 years after baseline (n = 2030), 6 years after baseline (n
= 1447) and 12 years after baseline (n = 756). The effect size with
the longest follow-up (12 years) was selected for inclusion in the
meta-analysis.
Anxiety studies
Of the five anxiety studies, two used a binary indicator of anxiety
(k = 2) and three used a continuous measure of anxiety (k = 3).
Anxiety studies had a mean follow-up time of 5.9 years (S.D. =
4.36). On average, participants were 76.56 years old at baseline
(S.D. = 4.23) and were predominantly female (60.14% female).
The majority of studies took place in Australia (n = 2), followed
by the USA, the Netherlands and Israel (n = 1 for each).
Anxiety was assessed using Sinoff’s Short Anxiety Screening
Test (SAST), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety
(HADS-A), Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Goldberg Anxiety Scale
and the Neuroticism scale from the NEO Personality Inventory
(n = 1 for each). All anxiety studies had a score of 60% or greater
on the STROBE checklist (maximum score = 81%, median score
= 78%).
Depression and decline in cognitive state
Meta-analysis of studies with depression as a binary predictor
There were 34 relevant effect sizes across 17 studies with a binary
measure of depression (Dufouil et al., 1996; Bassuk et al., 1998;
Yaffe et al., 1999; Geerlings et al., 2000; Paterniti et al., 2002;
Rosenblatt et al., 2003; Ganguli et al., 2006; Raji et al., 2007;
Han et al., 2008; Reyes-Ortiz et al., 2008; Niti et al., 2009;
Köhler et al., 2010; Brodaty et al., 2012; Sawyer et al., 2012;
Chang and Tsai, 2015; Downer et al., 2016; Wilson et al.,
2016). A multi-level meta-analysis of 34 effect sizes revealed
that depression was associated with an increased risk of subse-
quent decline in cognitive state (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.76, p
= .02; Fig. 2).
Assessment of heterogeneity, meta-regression and sub-group
analyses
Significant heterogeneity was observed across the studies with
depression as a binary predictor (Q = 106.83, df = 33, p < 0.0001,
I2 = 69.08%). An omnibus meta-regression analysis including
publication year, mean age at baseline, length of follow-up,
method of depression assessment (diagnosis or self-report) and
quality of study revealed that these variables together were able
to explain a significant amount of heterogeneity in the model
(QM = 13.32, df = 5, p = 0.02). However, even after accounting for
these factors, significant heterogeneity remained in the model
(QE = 93.51, df = 28, p < 0.0001). To further explore the effect of
publication year, age at baseline, length of follow-up, depression
assessment
and
quality
on
heterogeneity,
individual
meta-
regressions were conducted for each of these potential modifiers.
These analyses revealed that mean age at baseline ( p = 0.13),
publication year ( p = 0.19), quality of the study ( p = 0.09) and
depression assessment ( p = 0.91) did not significantly explain the
between-study variability.
Meta-regression analyses including the length of follow-up
showed significant between-study variability, whereby studies
with shorter follow-up periods had significantly greater effect

 sizes than studies with longer follow-up periods (B = −0.03, S.E. =
0.009, p = 0.002). Additionally, meta-regression analyses including
the method of cognitive assessment (MMSE v. neuropsychiatric
batteries) showed significant between-study variability (B = −0.2,
S.E. = 0.08, p = 0.01). To further explore precisely how these sig-
nificant factors were involved in this association sub-group
meta-analyses were conducted.
To explore how length of follow-up affected the association,
effect sizes were divided by the mean follow-up length in years
(M = 6.35 (S.D. = 4.25) years), resulting in two groups of longer
(k = 7, M = 10.79 (S.D. = 2.45) years) and shorter follow-up periods
(k = 10,
M = 3.25
(S.D. = 1.48)
years).
Multi-level
sub-group
meta-analyses revealed that depression was significantly asso-
ciated with decline in cognitive state in studies with shorter
follow-up periods (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03–2.00, p = 0.03) and
was approaching significance in studies with longer follow-up
periods (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98–1.36, p = 0.08). However, the over-
all effect size was larger for studies with shorter follow-up periods
than those with longer follow-up periods. Studies with longer
follow-up periods did not differ significantly from studies with
shorter follow-up periods on quality (t(14.29) = 1.08, p = 0.3),
publication year (t(15.38) = 0.1, p = 0.92), mean age at baseline
(t(10.67) = −0.41, p = 0.69), or depression assessment (t(14.07) = −0.5,
p = 0.63).
The meta-regression analysis including the method of cognitive
assessment suggested that effect sizes were significantly smaller for
studies using the MMSE than studies using neuropsychiatric batter-
ies (B = −0.2, S.E. = 0.08, p = 0.01). However, there were only four
studies using neuropsychiatric battery assessments of cognitive
state, so results need to be treated with caution.
Meta-analysis of studies with depression as a continuous
predictor
A multi-level meta-analysis of the 36 effect sizes across 16 studies
with a continuous measure of depression was conducted (Geerlings
et al., 2000; Vinkers et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Dotson et al.,
2008; Panza et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2011; Bunce et al., 2012;

et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Chen and Chang, 2016; Chiao
and Weng, 2016). This analysis revealed that depression was signifi-
cantly associated with a decline in cognitive state (B = −0.008, 95%
CI −0.015 to −0.002, p = 0.012; Fig. 3; OR 0.992, 95% CI 0.985–
0.998).
Assessment of heterogeneity and meta-regression analyses
Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies with depres-
sion as a continuous predictor (Q = 93.86, df = 35, p < 0.0001,

 I2 = 69.74%). In order to try and explain some of this heterogeneity,
an omnibus meta-regression analysis was conducted, including
mean age at baseline, length of follow-up, quality and publication
year as potential moderators. This analysis revealed that together
these variables were not able to explain a significant amount of
the heterogeneity in the model (QM = 8.97, df = 4, p = 0.06), but
even after accounting for these factors, significant heterogeneity
remained within the model (QE = 84.9, df = 31, p < 0.0001). In
order to explore the influence of age at baseline, follow-up length,
quality and publication year in more depth, individual meta-
regressions were conducted for each potential modifier. These
analyses revealed that mean age at baseline ( p = 0.27), length of
follow-up ( p = 0.1), publication year ( p = 0.18), method of cognitive
assessment ( p = 0.47) and quality ( p = 0.11) could not significantly
explain between-study variability individually.
Publication bias
Publication bias is unlikely for meta-analyses of depression stud-
ies measured as a continuous variable, as Begg’s rank correlation
test was non-significant ( p = 0.07). Begg’s funnel plot also
appears relatively symmetrical (online Supplementary Fig. S1).
There may have been some publication bias present in the
meta-analysis of studies with depression as a binary predictor,
as although Begg’s funnel plot appears symmetrical (online
Supplementary Fig. S1), Begg’s rank correlation test was signifi-
cant ( p = 0.02). Results should, therefore, be interpreted with
caution.
Anxiety and decline in cognitive state
Due to the limited number of studies with anxiety which met our
inclusion criteria, meta-analyses for these studies were not pos-
sible. Instead, these studies are described in the form of a narrative
review. Of the five relevant anxiety studies, two used a binary
indicator of anxiety (Sinoff and Werner, 2003; Brodaty et al.,
2012)
and
three
used
a
continuous
measure
of
anxiety
(Bierman et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2011; Bunce et al., 2012).
Two of these studies reported that anxiety was a significant
predictor of decline in cognitive state (Sinoff and Werner, 2003;
Wilson et al., 2011). Specifically, Sinoff and Werner, 2003
reported that in a sample of 100 people, anxiety (assessed using
Sinoff’s Short Anxiety Screening Test – SAST) had a strong direct
and indirect effect on predicting future decline in cognitive state

 over 3.2 years (B = 0.23, 95% CI −0.03 to –3.95, p < 0.05).
Similarly, Wilson et al. (2011) found that in 785 older adults,
higher levels of anxiety symptoms (assessed using the anxiety sub-
scale from the 48-item Neuroticism scale) were significantly asso-
ciated with more rapid decline in cognitive state over a 3.4-year
period (B = −0.003, S.E. = 0.001, p = 0.01).
Conversely, three of the eligible studies found no association
between anxiety symptoms and a decline in cognitive state
(Bierman et al., 2008; Brodaty et al., 2012; Bunce et al., 2012).
Bierman et al. (2008) found no evidence that anxiety (assessed
using the anxiety sub-scale from the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale – HADS-A) predicted a linear decline in cogni-
tive state in a sample of 2351 people over a period of 9 years.
Instead, a significant negative quadratic trend for cognition was
reported. The authors state that this is suggestive of a curvilinear
association between anxiety levels and cognitive performance.
Specifically, milder anxiety symptoms may be associated with
an improvement on the MMSE until it reaches an optimal level,
beyond which the beneficial influence reduces, so more severe
anxiety is related to poorer cognitive function. The authors
posit that the Yerkes and Dodson law regarding the association
between
arousal
and
cognitive
performance
(Yerkes
and
Dodson, 1908; Mendl, 1999) may also apply to anxiety symptoms.
Brodaty et al. (2012) found that in a sample of 480 non-impaired
people, the odds of decline in global cognitive state over a period
of 2 years were not significantly higher for participants with anx-
iety (assessed using Neuropsychiatric Inventory) at baseline than
those without (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.5–5.8, p = 0.45). They did, how-
ever, find a significant effect of anxiety at baseline on the decline
in executive function (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.3–9.9, p = 0.016).
Finally, Bunce et al. (2012) found no evidence that anxiety
(assessed using the Goldberg Anxiety Scale) affected change in
cognitive state over a period of 12 years in a sample of 836
community-dwelling individuals over the age of 70 (B = −0.14,
S.E. = 0.19, p = 0.46).
Discussion
The aim of the current study was to systematically investigate
associations between affective problems (depression and anxiety)
present at baseline and subsequent decline in cognitive state. Our
findings revealed that individuals with depression (measured as a
binary or continuous predictor) were at an increased risk of a
greater decline in cognitive state. These findings are consistent
with previous reviews which have indicated an association
between
affective
problems
and
development
of
dementia
(Jorm, 2001; Ownby et al., 2006; Byers and Yaffe, 2011; da Silva
et al., 2013; Bennett and Thomas, 2014; Cherbuin et al., 2015;
Gulpers et al., 2016). Our results extend these findings by linking
affective problems to a greater decline in cognitive state in samples
without dementia at baseline.
Strengths and limitations
Several limitations of the current study must be acknowledged.
They are subject to the limitations of the included studies. Our
analyses suggest that there are several key methodological differ-
ences between studies which significantly affect the results pro-
duced. For example, our results suggest that effects may differ
based on length of follow-up. As shown, this is unrelated to dif-
ferences in publication year, age at baseline, or method of
depression assessment (self-report or diagnosis). It is possible
that this is more likely attributable to additional unobserved
heterogeneity.
This review only included studies of decline in cognitive state
as an outcome. For this reason, it is not clear whether affective
problems may differentially influence decline in different cogni-
tive domains. Additionally, the majority of included studies
assessed cognitive state using the MMSE. This measure has
been criticised for lacking sensitivity to subtle changes in cogni-
tion and for ceiling and floor effects (Tombaugh and McIntyre,
1992). Consistent with this, the meta-analysis of studies using
depression as a binary predictor revealed that effect sizes are sig-
nificantly smaller for studies using the MMSE than studies using
neuropsychiatric batteries. It is therefore possible that the wide-
spread use of the MMSE may have resulted in an underestimation
of the association between affective disorders and decline in cog-
nitive state in healthy older adults over time. One further limita-
tion is that excluding cognitive impairment and dementia at
baseline does not completely rule out the possibility of reverse
causality.
Beyond this, included studies used different approaches and
instruments to assess affective problems. Research suggests that
there is low overlap among different scales of depression and anx-
iety, with content analysis suggesting that different types of assess-
ments may capture different symptoms (Fried, 2017). It is
therefore possible that studies included in this review are not
entirely comparable on the basis that the methods of assessing
depression are heterogeneous and may each be capturing different
kinds of symptoms. Beyond this, there were also very few studies
which met our inclusion criteria which examined the association
between anxiety and decline in cognitive state, meaning that a
quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. Moreover, an add-
itional limitation is that as there were no studies investigating
comorbidity between anxiety and depression. Finally, many of
the studies did not report separate effect sizes for different types
of symptoms of affective problems (e.g. negative affect symptoms,
somatic symptoms, etc.), meaning we could not look at how dif-
ferent symptoms of affective problems may influence decline in
cognitive state in the current study.
Plausible mechanisms
Three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
observed association. The first states that affective problems may
act as an aetiological risk factor for the subsequent decline in cog-
nitive state, perhaps by lowering the threshold for manifesting
decline (Butters et al., 2008; Bennett and Thomas, 2014). The
second hypothesis proposes that affective problems may act as a
prodromal feature of dementia. Specifically, affective problems
may manifest as an early clinical presentation of this disorder.
Affective problems and decline in cognitive state may therefore
be different symptoms of the same underlying condition (Panza
et al., 2010; Bennett and Thomas, 2014). The third hypothesis
posits that affective problems and decline in cognitive state are
separate processes but may share common risk factors and under-
lying neurobiological substrates (Djernes, 2006; Enache et al.,
2011; Bennett and Thomas, 2014). These hypotheses are not
necessarily mutually exclusive and it is likely that multiple path-
ways and mechanisms underlie this relationship.
There are several biological and behavioural pathways which
may be involved in the association between affective problems
and decline in cognitive state. These include vascular disease,

 increased cortisol production leading to atrophy of the hippocam-
pus (Geerlings and Gerritsen, 2017), increased deposition of
β-amyloid plaques (Byers and Yaffe, 2011), inflammatory changes
(Byers and Yaffe, 2011) and a decline in the levels and activities of
neurotrophic factors (Royall et al., 2017). A multiple pathways
model has also been proposed by Butters et al. (2008), which
posits that depression-associated cerebrovascular disease and
glucocorticoid neurotoxicity may operate to decrease levels of
brain and cognitive reserve, as well as interact with pathology
of Alzheimer’s disease, giving rise to the clinical manifestation
of
Alzheimer’s
disease
and
accelerated
cognitive
decline.
Additional potential lifestyle and behavioural pathways associated
with affective problems include educational attainment, social
support, early life adversity and health behaviours such as exercise
regime, alcohol consumption, smoking status and medication sta-
tus. It is more likely that a complex interaction of biological and
sociobehavioural mechanisms are involved in linking affective
problems with cognitive decline, rather than one single aetio-
logical determinant (da Silva et al., 2013).
Implications and future directions
Future research should focus on investigating whether effective
treatment and management of affective problems may reduce
risk of decline in cognitive state. Additionally, future reviews
could focus on how affective problems are associated with decline
in specific cognitive domains, such as memory, executive function
and information processing speed. This information can help to
elucidate the pattern of decline characteristic of individuals with
a history of affective problems. The present review could not
address the issue of comorbidity between depression and anxiety
and how comorbidity is associated with subsequent decline in the
mental state. Indeed, comorbidity of depression and anxiety dis-
orders is common. It is estimated that around 50–60% of indivi-
duals who have experienced depression also have a history of
anxiety disorder (Kessler et al., 1996; Fava et al., 2000).
Additionally, it is believed that comorbidity of anxiety and depres-
sion may be related to higher symptom severity and persistence,
as well as poorer functional outcomes (Angst et al., 1999;
Roy-Byrne et al., 2000). For this reason, it is important for future
research to address how comorbid depression and anxiety is asso-
ciated with future cognitive decline, and whether comorbidity of
these conditions may result in poorer cognitive outcomes than
depression or anxiety in isolation. One additional question
which remains unresolved is whether affective problems act as a
risk factor for the accelerated decline in cognitive state or whether
they are an early biomarker representing prodromal dementia.
While we excluded studies where cognitive impairment was pre-
sent at baseline, it is also known that dementia has a preclinical
period of many decades (Sperling et al., 2011). It is therefore pos-
sible that participants in included studies may have already built
up substantial dementia pathology at baseline, even if cognitive
symptoms were not yet apparent. Associations could therefore
be due to reverse causality from subtle cognitive changes short
of dementia. Future research should focus on distinguishing
more clearly between these possibilities.
As average life expectancy lengthens and rapid demographic
ageing occurs in populations worldwide, there is a dramatic pre-
dicted increase in the number of older adults living in our society
(Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002; Lutz et al., 2008). By 2030, it is
estimated that approximately one in five people in England will
be over the age of 65 (House of Lords, 2013). Given the predicted
increase in population size of adults over the age of 65, as well as
the poor outcomes and economic costs associated with a decline
in cognitive state and impairment, it is important to identify life
course risk factors for poorer late-life cognitive outcomes, for
potential early intervention. These findings may have value in
identifying individuals who may be at a greater risk of deterior-
ation in cognitive function over time. It is possible that effective
management and treatment of depression may reduce risk and
improve cognitive outcomes within these individuals. However,
there has also been some evidence to suggest there may be
persisting neurocognitive disturbances even after remission of
depression (Frasch et al., 2000; Weiland-Fiedler et al., 2004;
Paelecke-Habermann et al., 2005). Additionally, cognition may
be an important treatment target for depression (Kaser et al.,
2017). Due to the high prevalence of depression in the population,
these results are of great public health importance.
In conclusion, demographic ageing is occurring rapidly world-
wide and the number of people living with dementia is expected
to grow substantially in prevalence over the next thirty years. As
such, focussing research on potentially modifiable life-course risk
factors, such as affective problems, is of increasing importance.
This review highlights the importance of affective problems,
particularly depression, in this context.
