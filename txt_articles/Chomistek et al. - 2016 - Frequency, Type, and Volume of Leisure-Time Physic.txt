BACKGROUND: The inverse association between physical activity and 
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk has primarily been shown in studies of 
middle-aged and older adults. Evidence for the benefits of frequency, type, 
and volume of leisure-time physical activity in young women is limited.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis among 97 
230 women 
aged 27 to 44 years at baseline in 1991. Leisure-time physical activity was 
assessed biennially by questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models 
were used to examine the associations between physical activity frequency, 
type, and volume, and CHD risk.
RESULTS: During 20 years of follow-up, we documented 544 incident CHD 
cases. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard ratio (95% confidence 
interval) of CHD comparing ≥30 with <1 metabolic equivalent of task-
hours/wk of physical activity was 0.75 (0.57–0.99) (P, trend=0.01). 
Brisk walking alone was also associated with significantly lower CHD risk. 
Physical activity frequency was not associated with CHD risk when models 
also included overall activity volume. Finally, the association was not 
modified by body mass index (kg/m2) (P, interaction=0.70). Active women 
(≥30 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/wk) with body mass index<25 kg/
m2 had 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.78) times the rate of CHD in 
comparison with women who were obese (body mass index≥30 kg/m2) and 
inactive (physical activity <1 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/wk).
CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data suggest that total volume of 
leisure-time physical activity is associated with lower risk of incident CHD 
among young women. In addition, this association was not modified by 
weight, emphasizing that it is important for normal weight, overweight, and 
obese women to be physically active.

eisure-time physical activity is associated with an 
≈30% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
in women.1,2 The majority of studies, however, have 
been conducted in middle-aged and older populations 
because cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality 
rates are low in women <55 years.3 Manson et al4 re-
ported an inverse association between physical activity 
and cardiovascular disease in 3 separate age groups 
of women in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational 
Study, with the youngest group including women 50 to 
59 years of age at baseline. However, evidence for the 
benefits of exercise for CHD in younger women is very 
limited.
Although CHD morbidity and mortality rates are low 
in younger women, the CHD mortality rate among US 
women aged 25 to 54 years has shown minimal im-
provement in the past 2 decades, in contrast to rates 
in older adults that have consistently declined.5 A poten-
tial explanation may be the increases in the prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus and obesity.6,7 In addition, younger 
women differ from older women with regard to their lipid 
profiles, and psychosocial risk factors, as well, which 
may potentially impact the association between physi-
cal activity and CHD.8,9 We have recently shown that a 
healthy lifestyle that includes a healthy diet, not smoking, 
normal weight, and at least 2.5 hours per week of mod-
erate- to vigorous-intensity exercise is associated with 
substantially lower CHD risk in younger women.10 None-
theless, physical activity is a complex exposure because 
of its many dimensions, intensity, type, and frequency, 
all of which may be important for the prevention of CHD 
in younger women.
The purpose of this study was to assess the relation-
ship between the volume of total leisure-time physical 
activity (in metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-hours/wk) 
and CHD in young women, while also examining moder-
ate- and vigorous-intensity activity separately. In addition, 
we examined whether frequency and type of exercise 
were important attributes to general measures of overall 
activity in relation to CHD risk. Because rises in obesity 
may be a reason for the lack of decline in CHD mortal-
ity rates in young women, we investigated whether high 
levels of physical activity could eliminate the adverse as-
sociation between excess weight and CHD risk. Finally, 
given the high prevalence of inactivity among adolescent 
girls,11 we also investigated the associations between 
activity during adolescence and young adulthood and 
CHD during adulthood.
MethODs
study Population
The NHSII (Nurses’ Health Study II) is an ongoing cohort 
study that was established in 1989 and included 116 430 
predominantly white registered nurses aged 25 to 42 years. 
Participants completed a baseline self-administered question-
naire used to collect information on lifestyle factors, includ-
ing physical activity, health behaviors, and medical history. 
Follow-up biennial questionnaires were sent to participants to 
collect updated information on potential risk factors and newly 
diagnosed diseases. Biennial response rates are >90%. This 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Informed consent 
was implied by completion of the questionnaire.
Participants first reported on the frequency of physical 
activity and completed a semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaire 12 in 1991, which served as the baseline for 
this analysis. Women were excluded if they did not complete 
the baseline physical activity questionnaire (n=15 
418) or 
reported an inability to walk at baseline (n=69). After exclusion 
of women with cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes 
mellitus before 1991 (n=3713), 97 
230 women were included 
in the analysis.
assessment of Physical activity
Leisure-time physical activity was assessed in 1991, 1997, 
2001, 2005, and 2009 through questions on average total 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Findings from this study indicate that physical activ-
ity is associated with lower risk of coronary heart 
disease (CHD) in young women.
• Exercise did not have to be strenuous to have such 
associations; moderate-intensity physical activity, 
including brisk walking, was associated with lower 
risk of CHD.
• In addition, we found that frequency of physical activ-
ity was not associated with CHD risk after adjusting 
for total volume of physical activity.
• We found no association between physical activity 
earlier in life and CHD risk in adulthood.
• Finally, the associations between physical activity 
and lower CHD risk were evident regardless of body 
mass index.
What are the clinical implications?
• For patients who are currently inactive and find join-
ing a gym intimidating, emphasizing the benefits of 
walking may help them get active.
• Findings from this study indicate that the frequency 
of physical activity is not as important as the total 
volume; thus, patients can achieve the recom-
mended 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-
intensity physical activity per week in as many or as 
few sessions as they wish.
• Our results suggest that previously inactive women 
who become physically active can still decrease 
their risk of CHD.
• It is important for normal weight, overweight, and 
obese women to be physically active.

time per week spent on various activities over the previous year. 
The questions included on the 2009 NHS2 questionnaire can 
be accessed at the Nurses’ Health Study website.13  Walking 
pace, categorized as casual (<2 mph), normal (2–2.9 mph), 
brisk (3–3.9 mph), or striding (≥4 mph), was also assessed. A 
MET score was assigned to each activity based on its energy 
cost.14 To calculate the amount of energy expended, the time 
spent at each activity in hours per week was multiplied by its 
MET score, then summed over all activities to yield total MET-
hours/wk. Moderate activities (3 ≤ METs < 6) included brisk 
walking, outdoor work, yoga (beginning in 2001), and weight 
training (beginning in 2001). Vigorous activities, defined as 
requiring MET values ≥6, were jogging (>10 minutes/mile), 
running (≤10 minutes/mile), bicycling, lap swimming, tennis/
squash/racquetball, and other aerobic exercise.
The validity and reproducibility of the physical activity ques-
tionnaire have been reported in detail elsewhere.15 In brief, the 
Pearson correlation between 4 one-week diaries and the question-
naire was 0.62 for moderate and vigorous recreational activity.
In addition to time per week spent on physical activity, fre-
quency of exercise was assessed in 1991, 1993, 1995, 2005, 
and 2009. This was assessed by using a single question that 
read, “How many times per week do you engage in physical 
activity long enough to perspire heavily (including swimming)?” 
The responses provided were less than once/wk, once/wk, 2 
to 3 times/wk, 4 to 6 times/wk, and ≥7 times/wk.
In 1997, participants were asked about their walking and 
leisure-time activity during 5 age periods: grades 7 to 8, grades 
9 to 12, ages 18 to 22, ages 23 to 29, and ages 30 to 34. For 
each period, participants reported the average hours per week 
they engaged in each of 3 activity categories, with examples 
given for each: strenuous recreational activity (eg, running, 
aerobics, swimming laps), moderate recreational activity (eg, 
hiking, walking for exercise, casual cycling, and yard work), and 
walking to and from school or work. Seven categories were 
provided for responses ranging from 0 to 11+ hours per week.
Outcome ascertainment
The primary end point was incident CHD, which included non-
fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Self-reported MIs 
were confirmed by medical records according to World Health 
Organization criteria that included symptoms plus either diag-
nostic ECG changes or elevated cardiac-specific enzymes.16 
Fatal CHD was confirmed by hospital or autopsy records or if 
CHD was listed as the cause of death on the death certificate 
and evidence of previous CHD was available.
statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Each eligible par-
ticipant contributed person-time from the return of the 1991 
questionnaire (or 1997 questionnaire for analysis of adoles-
cent physical activity) until the date of diagnosis of the first 
CHD event, death, or June 2011.
Analysis of Total, Moderate-Intensity, and 
Vigorous-Intensity Physical Activity
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate haz-
ard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CHD 
outcomes. Physical activity was modeled as a time-varying 
exposure where simple updated levels of physical activity, 
using the most recent value of activity reported, were used. 
For example, events and person-time accrued between 1991 
and 1997 were categorized according to exposures reported 
on the 1991 questionnaire; events and person-time accrued 
between 1997 and 2001 were categorized according to 
exposures reported on the 1997 questionnaire; and so forth. 
Participants were divided into quintiles (<1, 1–5.9, 6–14.9, 
15–29.9, and ≥30 MET-hours/wk) for total leisure-time physi-
cal activity. For moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity, cat-
egories were based on the distribution of these variables as 
well as informative cut points. For example, 3 MET-hours/wk 
corresponds to 1 hour of moderate or 0.5 hours of vigorous 
activity and 7.5 MET-hours/wk corresponds to 2.5 hours of 
moderate or 1.25 hours of vigorous activity (the current rec-
ommendations based on the Physical Activity Guidelines for 
Americans).3 Tests for linear trend were computed by using 
the medians for categories modeled as a continuous variable.
Analysis of Individual Types of Physical Activity
In addition, we examined each individual activity separately 
while adjusting for all other activity using categories of 0, 0.1 
to 0.9, and 1+ hours per week (except for walking, where cat-
egories were 0, 0.1–0.9, 1–2.4, and 2.5+ hours per week due 
to a larger number of women reporting walking compared to 
other types of activities). For this analysis we used hours rather 
than MET-hours to be able to use the same categories for all 
activities, both those requiring more METs (eg, running) and 
fewer METs (eg, yard work). Yoga and weight training were not 
assessed until 2001; as such, we did not have enough power 
to look at these individually.
Covariables
The multivariable models were stratified by age (in months) and 
calendar year and included parental history of myocardial infarc-
tion before 60 years of age (yes/no), smoking (never, former, 
current: 1–15 cigarettes/d, current: ≥15 cigarettes/d), hours 
per week of television watching (quartiles), Alternative Healthy 
Eating Index-2010 diet score (quintiles), aspirin use (yes/no), 
menopausal status (pre/postmenopausal), postmenopausal 
hormone use (never, past, current), parity (none, 1–2 children, 
3–4 children, 5+ children), oral contraceptive use (never, past, 
current), and history of hypertension (yes/no) or hypercholes-
terolemia (yes/no) at baseline. All covariables were updated 
over time, except for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia 
because the incidence of these conditions may be in the causal 
pathway relating physical activity to CHD. Information from pre-
vious questionnaires was used when covariable data in a given 
cycle were missing.
Sensitivity Analyses
To minimize bias attributable to reverse causation in situa-
tions where preclinical cardiovascular disease may limit the 
ability to exercise, in the main analysis, we stopped updating 
physical activity when an individual reported difficulty climb-
ing a flight of stairs or walking. In addition, we performed 
sensitivity analyses with a 2- and 4-year lag to exclude pre-
clinical cases at baseline. For example, in a 2-year lag analy-
sis, physical activity reported in 1991 would be used for the 
1993 to 1995 follow-up period.

In addition to using simple updated levels of physical 
activity, we also conducted a secondary analysis where we 
calculated the cumulative average of physical activity levels 
from all available questionnaires up to the start of each 2-year 
follow-up interval to represent long-term levels of exercise.17
analysis of Joint association and effect 
Modification
Finally, we assessed the joint association of leisure-time 
physical activity and body mass index (BMI) with risk of CHD. 
Participants were cross-classified into 15 groups according 
to the levels of physical activity (<1, 1–5.9, 6–14.9, 15–29.9, 
and ≥30 MET-hours/wk) and BMI (<25, 25–29.9, and ≥30 kg/
m2). The interaction was assessed using the likelihood ratio 
test between the models with and without the cross-classified 
physical activity–BMI variables. Potential effect modification 
between physical activity and other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors (smoking, age, alcohol, and diet) was similarly assessed.
resUlts
The mean (SD) age of the study population at baseline 
was 36.6 (4.6) years. During 20 years of follow-up, 544 
women developed documented incident CHD of which 
254 cases occurred in women <50 years of age. We 
examined total leisure-time physical activity in relation to 
other potential risk factors for CHD at baseline (Table 1). 
Women who reported more physical activity were young-
er, had lower BMI, were less likely to smoke, watched 
less television, and had a higher Alternative Healthy Eat-
ing Index-2010 - diet score.
In multivariable-adjusted models, women reporting 
the highest amount of leisure-time physical activity (≥30 
MET-hours/wk) were at significantly lower risk of CHD in 
comparison with women who were the least active (<1 
MET-hour/wk; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.57–0.99, P for trend=0.01) (Table 2). 
When examined separately, moderate- and vigorous-
intensity physical activity were both inversely associated 
with CHD risk. In comparison with women reporting 0 
MET-hours/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity, 
women reporting ≥15 MET-hours/wk of moderate ac-
tivity had a 33% lower risk of CHD (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.51–0.87; P for trend=0.01). Similarly, women report-
ing ≥15 MET-hours/wk of vigorous activity had a 23% 
lower risk of CHD (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57– 1.03) in

comparison with women reporting no vigorous activity 
(P for trend=0.04). When the analysis was repeated with 
a 2- and 4-year lag, results for total leisure-time activ-
ity and moderate activity were attenuated and no longer 
statistically significant, whereas results for vigorous ac-
tivity were similar and remained significant. In second-
ary analysis, when we used cumulative average physical 
activity instead of simple updated activity, similar results 
were obtained although the hazard ratios in the highest 
2 categories were slightly attenuated (online-only Data 
Supplement Table I).
We also examined the association between frequency 
of exercise and risk of CHD (Table 3). In comparison 
with women reporting exercise less than once per week, 
the age-adjusted HR for women reporting exercise 4+ 
times per week was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46–0.78; P for 
trend=0.0001). However, the correlation between fre-
quency and volume of exercise ranged from 0.41 to 
0.44 in the questionnaire cycles where both were asked 
(1991, 2005, 2009). In the multivariable model that in-
cluded volume of physical activity, the association be-
tween exercise frequency and CHD risk was attenuated 
and no longer significant (HR comparing extreme cat-
egories, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.70–1.26, P for trend=0.84), 
whereas the association for volume of physical activity 
was nearly identical to that above (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.56–1.02 comparing ≥30 with <1 MET-hours/wk).
Table 4 shows the association between individual 
activities and CHD risk. In multivariable-adjusted analy-
ses where each activity was modeled separately, but 
adjusted for total volume of all other activity, aerobics, 
outdoor work, and brisk walking were each significantly 
inversely associated with CHD (P for trend=0.04, 0.04, 
and 0.001, respectively) (Table 4). Engaging in aero-
bics ≥1 hour/wk was associated with a 26% CHD risk 
reduction (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99) and outdoor 
work with a 16% CHD risk reduction (HR, 0.84; 95% 
CI, 0.68–1.04) in comparison with women not partici-
pating in these activities (Table 4). Brisk walking for 
≥2.5 hours/wk was associated with a 35% risk reduc-
tion (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.87) in comparison with 
women who reported no brisk walking. In addition, in-
creasing speed of usual walking pace was associated 
with lower CHD risk. After adjusting for hours per week 
of walking, other physical activity, and covariables, the 
HRs for easy/casual pace (<2 mph), normal/average 
pace (2–2.9 mph), brisk pace (3–3.9 mph), and very 
brisk/striding pace (≥4 mph) were: 1.00, 0.81 (95% CI,

0.66–0.98), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44–0.73), and 0.33 (95% 
CI, 0.17–0.65). Finally, results for running and tennis 
also suggested an inverse association with incidence 
of CHD but, most likely because of the small number of 
cases in the upper categories, reductions in risk were 
not statistically significant.
The joint association of physical activity and BMI on 
risk of CHD is shown in the Figure. As the interaction 
between physical activity and BMI was not statistically 
significant (P for interaction=0.70), the inverse associa-
tion between physical activity and CHD was not modi-
fied by BMI category. In comparison with obese women 
reporting <1 MET-hour/wk of physical activity, the HR 
of CHD for normal weight women reporting ≥30 MET-
hours/wk was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.35–0.78). Furthermore, 
among women in the highest category of exercise, those 
with normal BMI had lower CHD risk than women who 
were overweight or obese.
We additionally examined the association between 
physical activity recalled from earlier in life and CHD 
risk in adulthood (online-only Data Supplement Table 
II). There was no association between physical activ-
ity during ages 12 to 22 years and risk of CHD; the 
multivariable-adjusted HR comparing the highest with 
the lowest category was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.83–1.52). We 
also assessed physical activity measured at baseline 
only (1991) in relation to events occurring throughout 
the 20 years of follow-up, which differs from the primary 
analysis where physical activity levels were updated ev-
ery 4 to 6 years during follow-up. Similar to early-life 
activity, the association between baseline physical activ-
ity and risk of CHD was null; the multivariable-adjusted 
HR comparing the highest with lowest quintile was 0.98 
(95% CI, 0.74–1.29) (online-only Data Supplement Table 
III). These results suggest that the favorable association 
between physical activity and CHD may be best docu-
mented with levels proximal to the date of CHD inci-
dence for young and middle-aged women.
Finally, we evaluated whether the inverse association 
between physical activity and CHD was modified by other 
cardiovascular risk factors (online-only Data Supplement 
Table IV). Physical activity was associated with lower CHD 
risk for women <50 years of age and for women ≥50 
years of age, as well. In addition, there was no evidence 
of effect modification by smoking, Alternative Healthy 
Eating Index-2010  diet score, or alcohol intake.
DiscUssiOn
In this large, prospective study of young US women, in-
dividuals in the highest category (≥30 MET-hours/wk) of 
leisure-time physical activity were at a 25% lower risk 
of incident CHD. In addition, both moderate-intensity 
physical activity (eg, brisk walking) and vigorous-intensity 
activity were associated with reduced CHD risk. Impor-
tantly, physical activity was associated with lower CHD 
risk regardless of BMI group.
The mean age at baseline of participants in this study 
was 36.6 years, providing a unique opportunity to ex-
amine physical activity and CHD in younger women. Ac-
cording to a recent review, the median or mean ages of 
subjects in studies included in the 2008 Physical Activity 
Guidelines primarily ranged from 45 to 60 years.18 Thus, 
this article is a valuable contribution to the existing lit-
erature on modifiable lifestyle factors that could prevent 
CHD in younger women. Primordial prevention of CHD in 
this group is critical because recent data suggest that 
the CHD mortality rate in women aged 25 to 54 years 
may not be declining as it is in other groups, possibly 
because of the increases in the prevalence of obesity 
and type 2 diabetes mellitus.5–7
We found no association between recalled physical 
activity during adolescence or early adulthood and risk 
of CHD in adulthood. This finding is similar to that of 
Conroy et al19 who found that, although physical activ-
ity during high school and ages 18 to 22 was associ-

ated with meeting physical activity recommendations in 
middle adulthood, it was not associated with the risk of 
CHD during middle age and older. Furthermore, when 
we performed the analysis lagged 2 and 4 years, the 
association between total physical activity and CHD risk 
was attenuated. Taken together, these findings suggest 
that associations between physical activity and CHD pre-
vention may be driven by most recent levels. This is con-
sistent with evidence suggesting that exercise has acute 
effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors such as 
blood lipids, blood pressure, and glucose control.20 
Specifically, physical activity is correlated with lower tri-
glycerides, lower apolipoprotein B, higher high-density 
lipoprotein, change in low-density lipoprotein particle 
size, and lower coronary artery calcium.21 Therefore, an 
important message to communicate to the public is that, 
regardless of how inactive you may be, it is possible to 
experience cardiovascular benefits soon after becom-
ing physically active. Nonetheless, physical activity early 
in life should be encouraged because it has important 
health benefits for children and adolescents, including 
improved cardiovascular and metabolic health.3,22,23 Fur-
thermore, in this same cohort of women, there was a 
suggestive inverse association between physical activity 
during ages 14 to 22 years and risk of premenopausal 
breast cancer.24 Previous studies have also indicated 
that past physical activity is associated with physical ac-
tivity later in life.19,25 Thus, engaging in regular exercise 
is important for young and old as physical activity has 
important health benefits throughout life.
In the current study, there was no association be-
tween weekly frequency of physical activity and CHD 
risk once adjusted for volume of physical activity. This 
is in contrast to a recent finding from the Million Women 
Study, which showed that, in comparison with women 
reporting strenuous activity 2 to 3 times per week, those 
reporting strenuous physical activity daily were at higher 
risk of CHD.26 This inconsistency could be explained, in 
part, by differences in analysis methods. In the Million 
Women Study, the analysis for frequency of physical ac-
tivity did not adjust for total volume of activity because 
the duration of activity was not assessed until 3 years 
after baseline. With the exception of activity frequency, 
however, findings from the current study are similar to 
those of the Million Women Study among women 50 to 
64 years of age, in particular, with regard to the benefits 
of moderate physical activity for CHD.
Our results suggest that both moderate- and vigor-
ous-intensity physical activity are associated with CHD 
risk reduction, similar to other studies.27–30 Nonethe-
less, these previous studies in older men and women 
indicate a greater magnitude of association for vigor-
ous activity compared with moderate,27–30 whereas we 
saw a modestly stronger association for moderate over 
vigorous activity. The result in the present study may 
be a consequence of the physical activity questionnaire 
used. We were unable to include an assessment of the 
intensity at which a participant performed many of the 
activities. So, although we categorized activities like bi-
cycling and swimming as vigorous, some participants 
may actually perform these activities at a much lower 
intensity. Thus, the inability to distinguish between the 
same activity performed at a truly vigorous intensity ver-
sus a lower intensity could have contributed random er-
ror and attenuated our assessment. This is further sup-
ported by the activity-specific hazard ratios where the 
traditional vigorous activities such as running, tennis, 
and aerobics were more strongly inversely associated 
with CHD than activities like swimming, biking, and jog-
ging that likely have a much broader range of intensity. 
Furthermore, walking pace was assessed in the current 
study and found to be strongly inversely associated with 
risk of CHD.
Importantly, our study suggests that leisure-time phys-
ical activity is associated with a reduction in CHD risk in 
younger women who are normal weight, overweight, or 
obese. Although this finding has been reported in pre-
vious studies among middle-aged and older men and 
women, it is worth emphasizing, given the high preva-
lence of overweight and obesity in young and middle-
aged US women (58.5% for women 20–39 years of age, 
71.7% for women 40–59 years of age).31–33 An elevated 
BMI is still a significant risk factor for development of 
CHD, but the increased risk associated with being over-
weight or obese is attenuated, although not completely, 
by engaging in physical activity.

Strengths of this study include its prospective design, 
the detailed information on physical activity collected 
multiple times during follow-up, the large number of con-
firmed CHD cases despite the relatively young age of 
study participants, and minimal loss to follow-up.
Our study also has several limitations that should be 
considered. Our study population, consisting of predomi-
nantly white nurses, is not representative of the general 
population. Thus, we cannot necessarily generalize our re-
sults to men or other populations with different education-
al levels, incomes, or distributions of race and ethnicity. 
Physical activity was self-reported, but this questionnaire 
has been previously validated in this population.15 More-
over, measurement error is unlikely to bias our results be-
cause physical activity was assessed prospectively so any 
reporting errors would be nondifferential with respect to 
subsequent disease status. Nonetheless, the lack of asso-
ciation between physical activity during adolescence and 
CHD during adulthood may be a consequence of measure-
ment error as participants had to recall physical activity 
levels from 20 to 35 years earlier. As in any observational 
study, the possibility of residual confounding by other life-
style characteristics must be considered; however, we 
were able to adjust for many known CHD risk factors.
In conclusion, this study indicates that physical ac-
tivity is associated with a lower risk of CHD in young 
women. Furthermore, exercise did not have to be strenu-
ous to have such associations; moderate-intensity physi-
cal activity, including brisk walking, was associated with 
lower risk of CHD. There was no association between 
physical activity earlier in life and CHD risk in adulthood, 
suggesting that previously inactive women who become 
physically active can still decrease their risk of CHD. Fi-
nally, the favorable associations between physical activ-
ity and lower CHD risk were evident regardless of BMI, 
emphasizing that it is important for normal weight, over-
weight, and obese women to be physically active.
