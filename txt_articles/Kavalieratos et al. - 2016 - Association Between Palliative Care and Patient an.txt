 IMPORTANCE—The use of palliative care programs and the number of trials assessing their 
effectiveness have increased.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the association of palliative care with quality of life (QOL), 
symptom burden, survival, and other outcomes for people with life-limiting illness and for their 
caregivers.
DATA SOURCES—MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL to July 2016.
STUDY SELECTION—Randomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in adults with 
life-limiting illness.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—Two reviewers independently extracted data. 
Narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. Quality of life, symptom burden, and survival 
were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis, with estimates of QOL translated to units of 
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–palliative care scale (FACIT-Pal) 
instrument (range, 0–184 [worst-best]; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 9 points); 
and symptom burden translated to the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) (range, 0–
90 [best-worst]; MCID, 5.7 points).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Quality of life, symptom burden, survival, mood, 
advance care planning, site of death, health care satisfaction, resource utilization, and health care 
expenditures.
RESULTS—Forty-three RCTs provided data on 12 731 patients (mean age, 67 years) and 2479 
caregivers. Thirty-five trials used usual care as the control, and 14 took place in the ambulatory 
setting. In the meta-analysis, palliative care was associated with statistically and clinically 
significant improvements in patient QOL at the 1- to 3-month follow-up (standardized mean 
difference, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.08 to 0.83; FACIT-Pal mean difference, 11.36] and symptom burden at 
the 1- to 3-month follow-up (standardized mean difference, −0.66; 95%CI, −1.25 to −0.07; ESAS 
mean difference, −10.30). When analyses were limited to trials at low risk of bias (n = 5), the 
association between palliative care and QOL was attenuated but remained statistically significant 
(standardized mean difference, 0.20; 95%CI, 0.06 to 0.34; FACIT-Pal mean difference, 4.94), 
whereas the association with symptom burden was not statistically significant (standardized mean 
difference, −0.21; 95%CI, −0.42 to 0.00; ESAS mean difference, −3.28). There was no association 
between palliative care and survival (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.69 to 1.17). Palliative care was 
associated consistently with improvements in advance care planning, patient and caregiver 
satisfaction, and lower health care utilization. Evidence of associations with other outcomes was 
mixed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this meta-analysis, palliative care interventions were 
associated with improvements in patient QOL and symptom burden. Findings for caregiver 
outcomes were inconsistent. However, many associations were no longer significant when limited 
to trials at low risk of bias, and there was no significant association between palliative care and 
survival.
Improving quality of life (QOL) in serious illness is an international priority.1,2 Palliative 
care focuses on improving QOL and reducing suffering for seriously ill patients and their

 families.3 More than 65%ofUS hospitals have an inpatient palliative care program.4 
Community- and outpatient-based models of palliative care delivery are increasing.5
A 2008 systematic review6 and a 2011 narrative review7 both reported mixed evidence for 
the association between palliative care and patient, family, and health care utilization 
outcomes, as well as methodological shortcomings in the evidence. Since 2011, additional 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have reported that palliative care improves outcomes such 
as QOL,8–11 symptom burden,8–10 and survival.12,13 As a result, palliative care has been 
included in international policy and guidelines.14,15
The aims of this study were to conduct a systematic review of palliative care RCTs to 
provide an up-to-date summary of palliative care outcomes and to perform meta-analyses to 
estimate the association of palliative care with patient QOL, symptom burden, and survival.
Methods
This protocol-based systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: 
CRD42014013696)16 was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for 
Systematic Reviews of Interventions.17
Identification and Selection of Studies
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library’s CENTRAL from 
inception to July 22, 2016. A health sciences librarian (M.K-F.) developed, piloted, and 
executed the searches (eText 1 in the Supplement). Searches excluded pediatric and non–
English-language articles.
Study Eligibility
Two reviewers (D.K. and L.H.) independently evaluated all records for eligibility (eTable 1 
in the Supplement). Disagreements were resolved by consensus with 2 other authors (J.C. 
and Y.S.). The RCTs investigating palliative care interventions targeting adult patients (≥18 
years) with life-threatening illness that reported on at least 1 of 9 patient-level outcomes 
were included: QOL, symptom burden, mood, survival, advance care planning, site of death, 
resource utilization, health care expenditures, and satisfaction with care. Interventions were 
included if they comprised at least 2 of 8 possible domains of palliative care, as defined by 
the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care.18 Interventions that treated a 
single symptom (eg, opioids for dyspnea), targeted only one palliative care domain (eg, 
advance care planning only), or did not target patients (eg, caregiver-only interventions) 
were excluded. Trials with usual care, waitlist, or attention control comparators were 
included.
Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment
Two of 4 investigators (D.K., J.C., N.C.E., J.H.) used structured, customized forms to extract 
information from each trial’s primary and secondary reports. Risk of bias was independently 
rated by 2 investigators (D.K., J.N.D-O.) using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool.17 Within 
each trial, risk of bias was evaluated separately for subjective (eg, patient-reported

 outcomes) and objective (eg, survival) outcomes. Therefore, each trial has 2 summary risk-
of-bias judgments, 1 regarding subjective outcomes and 1 for objective outcomes. Detailed 
information regarding risk of bias assessment is provided in eText 2 in the Supplement. Trial 
authors were contacted to provide additional detail necessary to render high or low 
judgments.
Key Points
Question
Is palliative care associated with improved patient and caregiver outcomes?
Findings
In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, palliative care was associated with 
improvements in quality of life and symptom burden but not with improved survival. 
However, results were attenuated and some of these associations were no longer 
statistically significant when analyses were restricted to trials at low risk of bias.
Meaning
Palliative care may be associated with improved quality of life and symptom burden for 
patients, but findings for caregiver outcomes were mixed. However, the quality of 
evidence is limited.
Synthesis
A narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. In addition, patient QOL, symptom 
burden, and survival outcomes were selected a priori for meta-analysis. Quality of life and 
symptom burden are considered to be primary targets of palliative care interventions. 
However, the association of palliative care and survival has been of considerable 
interest.12,19,20 Due to the variety of instruments used to evaluate QOL and symptom 
burden, pooled effects were summarized as standardized mean differences (SMDs), 
calculated using a Hedges adjusted g estimator to correct for small sample bias.21 If 
necessary, individual study results were corrected for directionality such that higher QOL 
scores represented better QOL, and lower symptom scores indicated less symptom burden. 
Pooled SMDs were reexpressed as units of familiar instruments by multiplying SMDs by the 
among-person SDs of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–palliative care 
scale (FACIT-Pal)22 for QOL, and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS)23 for 
symptom burden (eText 3 in the Supplement).24 Translations are provided to assist with 
interpretation of results; however, due to differences in study variances, inferences regarding 
statistical significance of findings should be interpreted from SMD calculations. The FACIT-
Pal scores range from 0 (worst) to 184 (best). Although the minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID) is unknown for the FACIT-Pal, it has been suggested that MCIDs for 
total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scores, including the FACIT-Pal, are 
4% to 6% of a measure’s overall score.25 A midrange bound of 5% equals 9 points on the 
FACIT-Pal. Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale scores range from 0 (best) to 90 (worst). 
The MCID for improvement in the ESAS total score is 5.7 points using the conservative 
within-patient change approach.26

 Given heterogeneity across trials, DerSimonian-Laird random effects models were 
constructed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp). All significance tests were 2-tailed, with P 
< .05 considered statistically significant. The proportion of variability in point estimates 
attributable to between-study heterogeneity was quantified by the I2 statistic21 and 
interpreted qualitatively as low (25%–50%), moderate (50%–75%), and high (75%–
100%).27 Heterogeneity was also examined using τ2 and Cochrane Q statistics. All studies 
included in the meta-analysis had comparable baseline characteristics between intervention 
and control groups or outcome measurements adjusted by baseline scores.
To account for variability in the timing of study end points, clinically relevant follow-up 
periods of 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 months were used. For studies that reported outcomes at more 
than one time point within the same 1- to 3- or 4- to 6–month window, the last time point 
was analyzed. Outcomes reported between 2 time points were categorized with the earlier 
month. Hazard ratios (HRs)were used as the treatment effect for survival. Hazard ratios were 
imputed when they were not provided using the log-rank approach.28,29
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of risk of bias, the use of 
follow-up time windows (vs 3- or 6-month discrete follow-up time points), and imputation 
of HRs. Post hoc analyses were conducted to assess whether associations varied according to 
setting and disease (cancer only, noncancer only, or mixed-disease samples). Univariable 
meta-regression was used to explore associations between estimated effect sizes and 
publication year and intervention intensity. Publication bias was assessed through funnel 
plots and Egger tests. Statistical heterogeneity was explored by modeling study-level 
characteristics using univariable meta-regression.
Results
Study Characteristics
Searches identified 6158 unique records, of which 200 were potentially relevant based on 
initial screening (Figure 1). Fifty-six articles were ultimately included, describing 43 trials 
that involved 12 731 patients (mean age, 67 years) and 2479 caregivers (eTables 2–4 in the 
Supplement). Thirty trials (69.7%) included patients with cancer and 14 trials (32.5%) 
included patients with heart failure, both of which diseases represent the diagnoses most 
commonly requiring palliative care. Thirty-one trials (72.0%)were conducted in the United 
States. Fourteen trials (32.5%) were in ambulatory settings; 18 (41.8%), home-based; and 11 
(25.6%), hospital-based. Regarding subjective outcomes, 24 trials (55.8%)were judged as 
having high risk, 11 (25.6%) as unclear risk, and 7 (16.3%) as low risk of bias. One trial did 
not evaluate subjective outcomes (eTables 5–6 in the Supplement). Regarding objective 
outcomes, 19 trials (44.1%) were judged as having high risk, 10 (23.2) as unclear risk, and 3 
(6.9%) as low risk of bias; 11 trials (25.6%) did not evaluate objective outcomes.
Interventions addressed a median of 5 (range, 2–7) of 8 palliative care components.18 Forty-
two trials addressed physical and 39 trials addressed psychological aspects of care. No 
interventions explicitly described cultural assessment as an aspect of the intervention or 
reported using culturally sensitive materials (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

 Fifteen RCTs evaluated caregiver outcomes. One had a separate, yet concurrent caregiver-
focused intervention.30 Four included the patient and caregiver as a unit of care in a single 
intervention,31–34 5 invited but did not require a caregiver to participate in a patient-focused 
intervention,35–39 and 5 collected caregiver data only, without a caregiver-focused 
intervention.40–44
Thirty-nine studies used parallel-group designs (35 with a usual-care comparator, 2 with 
active comparators, and 2 with attention controls). Five studies used waitlist 
designs,20,43,45–47 with delay intervals ranging from 2 to 12 weeks. Most trials randomized 
patients; 5 used cluster randomization.8,48–51
Patient QOL
Quality of life was assessed in 24 studies (55.8%) (4576 patients), of those 
129,10,20,32,35,44,48,51–55 were at high risk; 5,11,13,31,42,56 unclear risk; and 7,8,12,33,57–60 low 
risk of bias. Sixteen trials (67%) exclusively comprised patients with cancer. Twelve trials 
(50%) evaluating QOL reported statistically significant improvements related to palliative 
care. Of the 7 trials at low risk of bias, 5 (71%) reported statistically significant 
improvements.8,12,33,57–60 Six (85.7%) of which were conducted in the ambulatory 
setting,8,12,33,58–60 and 5 (71.4%) involved patients with cancer,8,33,57,59,60 with 2 of those 
involving outpatient specialist palliative care interventions.8,60
Fifteen trials evaluating QOL at the 1- to 3-month follow-up could be pooled in meta-
analysis; of these, 11 exclusively comprised patients with cancer, and 8 used ambulatory 
interventions. Among these 15 trials, palliative care was associated with statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvement in QOL at 1 to 3 months (SMD,0.46; 
95%CI,0.08 to 0.83; Figure 2; mean difference in FACIT-Pal units, 11.36; heterogeneity, I2 = 
94.8%). There was no association of palliative care and QOL among 12 trials pooled with 4- 
to 6-month follow-up (Figure 3).
In sensitivity analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias, palliative care was associated 
with improved QOL at the 1- to 3-month follow-up, but the point estimate was attenuated 
(SMD, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06–0.34; 5 trials; I2 = 0.0%; Figure 2; mean difference in FACIT-Pal 
units, 4.94 points) and at the 4- to 6-month follow-up (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05–0.32; 5 
trials; I2 = 0.0%; Figure 3; mean difference in FACIT-Pal units, 2.96). Additional post hoc 
analyses related to disease or study setting demonstrated no associations between palliative 
care and QOL (eFigures 2 and 3). Analyses using discrete time points vs windows 
demonstrated a statistically significant association at 3 months (eFigure 4), but not at 6 
months (eFigure 5). Evidence of publication bias was detected by an Egger test (P = .03), 
and from visual examination of an asymmetrical funnel plot (eFigure 6). Heterogeneity was 
explainable by study setting, with hospital-based palliative care interventions showing 
stronger associations with improved QOL (P = .04; eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Physical Symptoms
Of the 29 trials involving 10105 patients and assessing physical symptoms, 17 had a high 
risk of bias,9,10,20,43–45,47–49,51,52,54,55,61–64 5 had an unclear risk of bias,37,42,46,50,65 and 7 
had a low risk8,12,33,57–60 of bias. Ten trials reported statistically significant reductions in

 specific physical symptoms or a composite symptom indicator.8–10,46–48,59–61,63 Of the 7 
trials at low risk of bias, 3 reported statistically significant reductions in symptom 
burden.8,59,60 All 3 included only patients with cancer and reported findings as 
multisymptom composites; 2 of them used specialist outpatient palliative care 
interventions.8,60
Ten trials involving 1813 participants were pooled in a meta-analysis regarding symptom 
burden at the 1- to 3-month follow-up8–10,12,20,43,46,54,57,60; 4 trials were judged as having a 
low risk,8,12,57,60 1 as unclear,46 and 5 as high risk of bias.9,10,20,43,54 Palliative care was 
associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in symptom burden at the 
1- to 3-month follow-up, but the analysis had extremely high heterogeneity (SMD, −0.66; 
95% CI, −1.25 to −0.07; I2 = 96.1%; Figure 4; mean difference in ESAS units, −10.30). At 
the 4- to 6-month follow-up, palliative care was associated with improved symptom burden 
(SMD, −0.18; 95% CI, −0.31 to−0.05; I2 = 0.0%; Figure 5; mean difference in ESAS units, 
−2.80).
In sensitivity analyses limited to the 4 trials at low risk of bias, palliative care was not 
associated with change in symptom burden at the 1- to 3-month follow-up (SMD, −0.21; 
95% CI, −0.42 to 0.00; I2 = 42.1%; Figure 4; mean difference in ESAS units, −3.28; 4 
trials). Nor was it associated with change in symptom burden at the 4- to 6-month follow-up 
(SMD, −0.13; 95% CI, −0.27 to 0.01; I2 = 0.0%; Figure 5; mean difference in ESAS units, 
−2.03, 4 trials). Additional post hoc analyses related to disease, setting, or discrete time 
point assessment revealed no associations between palliative care and symptom burden 
(eFigures 7–9). There was no evidence of publication bias (eFigure 10). Heterogeneity was 
largely explained by study setting, with hospital-based palliative care interventions showing 
stronger associations with improved symptom burden (P < .001; eTable 7 in the 
Supplement).
Survival
Survival was assessed in 17 trials involving 8196 patients;10 trials were judged as having 
high risk of bias,9,20,34,39,49,52,55,60,67,68 5 as unclear risk,11,13,50,65,66 and 2 as low risk.12,57 
One trial specified survival as a primary outcome.20 The 2 trials at low risk of bias reported 
conflicting findings. A telepalliative care intervention for patients with advanced cancer 
reported no effect on survival (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64–1.07),20 whereas a trial of integrated 
palliative and respiratory care for dyspnea, which included survival as a safety outcome, 
reported greater survival at 6 months(94%vs 75%,P = .048).12 Three additional trials(2 at 
high risk of bias,20,60 1 at unclear risk13) reported statistically significant improvements in 
survival.
Seven trials involving 2184 patients that assessed survival were pooled in a meta-
analysis.9,11,13,50,57,60,65 One trial was rated as having low risk of bias, summarized above.12 
There was no association between palliative care and survival (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69–
1.17; I2 = 75.3%; Figure 6). Post hoc analyses related to disease, setting, or imputation of 
HRs identified no significant associations of palliative care and survival (eFigures 11–13). 
No evidence of publication bias was detected (eFigure 14). Heterogeneity of estimates could 
not be explained by study-level characteristics (eTable 7 in the Supplement).

 Patient Mood
There was mixed evidence from 23 trials involving 4175 patients regarding the association 
of palliative care with mood. Of the 23 trials, 13 were judged as high 
risk,9,20,35,43–45,47,48,51,55,62–64 5 as unclear risk,11,13,37,42,56 and 5 as low risk of 
bias.12,57–60 Overall, 7 trials reported statistically significant improvements in mood related 
to palliative care9,13,48,57–60; of these, 4 were at low risk of bias.57–60 Of the 5 trials at low 
risk of bias,12,57–60 4 reported statistically significant improvements in mood.57–60
Advance Care Planning
Advance care planning was assessed in 10 trials involving 6525 patients; 7 trials were 
judged as having high risk of bias,9,39,48,49,55,61,68 2 as unclear risk,65,66 and 1 as low risk.60 
Among the 5 trials that reported statistically significant improvements,9,39,61,65,66 3 were at 
high risk of bias9,39,61 and 2 were of unclear risk of bias.65,66 One trial at low risk of bias, a 
trial of early specialist palliative care in patients with lung cancer, demonstrated no 
association with documentation of resuscitation preferences (P = .05).60
Site of Death
Eight trials involving 1556 patients assessed site of death with mixed results; of these, 5 
trials were judged as having high risk of bias20,48,67,69,70 and 3 as unclear risk.50,66,71 Three 
trials reporting statistically significant increases in at-home death,50,67,72 tested home-based 
interventions. Of these, 2 were large trials involving 744 patients were at unclear risk of 
bias,50,71 and 1 was a medium-sized trial that involved 167 patients was at high risk of 
bias.67
Resource Utilization and Expenditures
Twenty-four trials involving 4794 patients assessed resource 
utilization9–13,20,34,37,38,42,48,50,52,55,57,60,61,63,65,66,68,69,71,73; of these, 11 reported 
significantly decreased utilization among palliative care 
recipients.10,34,37,38,48,50,52,65,66,71,73
Hospital utilization was assessed in 20 trials involving 4329 patients; of these, 11 trials were 
judged as having high risk of bias,9,10,20,34,48,52,55,61,63,67,69 7 as unclear 
risk,11,13,37,42,65,66,71 and 2 as lowrisk.12,57 Neither of 2 trials at low risk of bias 
demonstrated statistically significant differences in length of stay.12,57 Five trials, all of 
home-based interventions involving either heart failure or mixed-disease samples, reported 
significant reductions in hospital utilization10,34,52,67,71; of these, 4 were judged at high risk 
of bias,10,34,52,67 and 1 at unclear risk.71
Six trials involving 1360 patients assessed hospice use; of these, 3 trials were judged as 
having high risk of bias9,55,68 and 3 as unclear risk.11,65,71 Overall, 1 trial involving 517 
participants and judged as having an unclear risk of bias that assessed inpatient specialist 
palliative care consultation reported significantly longer hospice stays among intervention 
patients (median, 24 vs 12 days; P = .04), although the overall percentage of patients 
admitted to hospice did not differ between groups (P = .50).65

 Four trials involving 704 patients evaluated the use of intensive nonpalliative services (eg, 
chemotherapy within the last 14 days of life, no hospice care, or admission to hospice ≤3 
days before death), of which 1 trial was judged as having high risk of bias,20 2 as unclear 
risk,37,66 and 1 as lowrisk.60 The trial at low risk reported no association between palliative 
care and intensive, nonpalliative services (P = .05).60
Twelve trials involving 6892 patients assessed health care expenditures; of these 7 trials 
were judged as having high risk of bias,34,39,43,47–49,67 4 as unclear risk,37,46,65,71 and 1 as 
low risk.12 Only 1 trial was considered at low risk of bias, a multidisciplinary palliative 
intervention for patients with refractory dyspnea. This trial reported no differences in 6-
weekmean costs (£1402 vs £1408).12 Of the 4 trials that reported significant reductions in 
expenditures favoring the intervention, 2 were at high risk34,67 and 2 were at unclear risk of 
bias.65,71 None of the trials in this review demonstrated increased overall health care 
expenditures related to palliative care.
Satisfaction With Care
Patient satisfaction with care was assessed in 11 trials involving 2690 patients; of these 6 
trials were judged as having high risk of bias,10,34,39,48,64,67 4 as unclear risk,37,42,65,71 1 as 
lowrisk.8 Overall, 7 trials reported a significant improvement in satisfaction among palliative 
care recipients,8,34,37,39,65,71 including 1 trial that assessed and was judged at low risk of 
bias.8
Caregiver Outcomes
Fifteen trials involving 2479 caregivers with 8 trials judged as having high risk, 4 as unclear 
risk, and 3 as low risk of bias included subjective caregiver outcomes. Of 7 trials assessing 
caregiver QOL,30–33,35,41,44 three31,33,44 showed benefit in 1 or more QOL domain at 1 or 
more time point. However, only 1 trial was at low risk of bias.33 Of 5 studies assessing 
caregiver mood,30,35,37,43,44 two30,37 showed benefit at 1 or more time points. Of these, one 
was at high risk of bias30 and the other had an unclear risk of bias.37 Out of 7 
studies30–33,36,40,41 evaluating caregiver burden, three30,32,33 reported benefit in at least 1 
domain at 1 or more time points, although only 1 was at low risk of bias.33 Caregiver 
satisfaction was measured in 5 studies. Of these,34,37–39,42 four34,37–39 showed higher scores 
among intervention groups; however, 3 were at high risk of bias34,38,39 and 1 was at unclear 
risk.37
Discussion
In this meta-analysis, palliative care interventions were associated with significant 
improvements in QOL and symptom burden but not in 1- to 3-month survival. However, 
because of marked heterogeneity among trials in methodological quality and rigor, there was 
weak evidence for these associations. When sensitivity analyses were restricted to trials at 
low risk of bias, associations between palliative care and QOL remained statistically 
significant but not clinically important and associations with symptom burden were no 
longer statistically significant. Of the outcomes narratively synthesized, palliative care was 
associated with improved advance care planning, greater patient and caregiver satisfaction

 with care, and lower health care utilization. There was mixed evidence of associations of 
palliative care with site of death; patient mood; health care expenditures; and caregiver 
QOL, mood, or burden.
This study adds to the literature by (1) including 23 trials published since a 2008 systematic 
review6 and 29 trials not included in the 2011 narrative review,7 (2) by evaluating risks of 
bias and methodological limitations in each trial, and (3) by conducting a systematic review 
that includes a meta-analysis of 3 important outcomes. Although these analyses provide 
increased evidence for the association of palliative care with several patient and caregiver 
outcomes, particularly for patients with advanced cancer, the results should be interpreted 
cautiously given persistent methodological limitations. High-quality palliative care studies 
with innovative and context-specific methods are needed that are responsive to the 
complexities of conducting research in seriously ill populations are needed.74,75
Although all included trials involved patients with life-limiting illness, there was wide 
variability across samples. This is consistent with the concept that palliative care is 
appropriate at any stage of life-limiting illness, including patients less severely ill.2 
However, the effects of palliative care may be more difficult to demonstrate among people 
with less symptom burden or QOL impairment. Future meta-analyses should account for this 
diversity between studies, to avoid ceiling and floor effects.
Survival was reported as an outcome in recent trials, although improving survival is not an 
aim of palliative care.2 Only one trial specified survival as a primary end point.20 Given that 
some clinicians and members of the lay public view palliative care negatively due to an 
unfounded belief that it may shorten survival,76,77 it is important to note that no trial showed 
a decrease in survival from palliative care.
The association of palliative care with caregiver outcomes was mixed. Three explanations 
may clarify these seemingly discrepant findings. First, many of the reviewed interventions 
did not specifically target caregivers. Included trials were typically patient focused. Second, 
of palliative care interventions that targeted caregivers, there was considerable variability in 
their type and delivery. Third, care needs of patients with life-limiting illness change as 
patient health deteriorates. Hence, despite training in coping skills, caregivers may feel 
burdened by having to adapt to these changing needs. Because we excluded caregiver-
focused interventions, the outcomes presented reflect only caregiver outcomes of patient-
focused palliative care interventions.
Strengths and Weaknesses
This review used a broad search for palliative care RCTs to detect interventions consistent 
with the philosophy or components of palliative care, including interventions that may not 
be explicitly described as palliative care. Consequently, this review includes a wide spectrum 
of palliative care delivery models, with interventions ranging from interdisciplinary 
specialized palliative care to those in which palliative care domains were delivered by a 
nonpalliative care specialist. Although all interventions met our prespecified definition of 
“palliative care,” their diversity likely introduced heterogeneity into the meta-analysis.78 The 
use of a random-effects model measures variability between trials, weighting each study’s

 contribution within the pooled effect. This review regards palliative care as a philosophy of 
care. Insufficient data were available to identify the associations between specific models of 
palliative care (eg, specialist vs generalist palliative care training)and patient and caregiver 
outcomes.
This review has several limitations. First, several trials could not be included in meta-
analyses, typically, because missing data remained even after contacting authors. Second, the 
review excluded quasi-experimental studies, several of which have demonstrated benefits of 
palliative care.79,80 Third, post hoc analyses including meta-regressions and tests for 
publication bias should be interpreted cautiously given that these statistical tests may have 
been underpowered. Fourth, trial duration and attrition rates were not uniformly reported in 
studies and are therefore excluded from this review. Fifth, this review did not distinguish 
between early palliative care interventions vs those at the end-of-life, reflecting the 
prevailing view that palliative care is appropriate at any point in the disease trajectory.2 
Sixth, risk of bias assessment is subjective, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool is not 
designed to account for the intricacies of conducting behavioral interventions among 
seriously ill populations. Given these limitations, results of this systematic review and meta-
analysis should be interpreted cautiously.
Unanswered Questions and Future Research
Several gaps remain regarding palliative care. First, this review could not discern the 
association between specific palliative care processes and outcomes. Future research should 
aim to identify the efficacious component(s) of palliative care. Second, future studies should 
assess patient-reported outcomes using a core set of standardized and validated measures 
appropriate for seriously ill patients at similar time points. Third, additional studies are 
needed to evaluate the role of palliative care in chronic nonmalignant illnesses (eg, heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease). Fourth, among subgroups for 
which the efficacy of palliative care has been established (eg, oncology), future trials should 
consider active controls to investigate the comparative effectiveness of different palliative 
care strategies. Finally, trials are needed to establish optimal models of palliative care 
delivery that help caregivers in addition to patients.
Conclusions
In this meta-analysis, palliative care interventions were associated with improvements in 
patient QOL and symptom burden. Findings for caregiver outcomes were inconsistent. 
However, many associations were no longer significant when limited to trials at low risk of 
bias, and there was no significant association between palliative care and survival.
