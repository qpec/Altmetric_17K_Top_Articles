ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness 
of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for 
patients with atrial fibrillation.
DESIGN
Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost 
effectiveness analysis. 
DATA SOURCES
Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane 
Library.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES
Published randomised trials evaluating the use of a 
DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug for 
prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.
RESULTS
23 randomised trials involving 94 656 patients 
were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC with warfarin 
dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 
5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence 
interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily 
(0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily 
(0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once 
daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of stroke 
or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The 
risk of stroke or systemic embolism was higher with 
edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) and 
rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) 
than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The risk of 
all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than 
with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 
to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 
to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 
0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 
0.90) reduced the risk of major bleeding compared 
with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher 
with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 
mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), rivaroxaban 20 
mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 
1.19 to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than 
edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The 
risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower 
for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the 
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with some 
DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was 
ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost 
effective compared with warfarin.
CONCLUSIONS
The network meta-analysis informs the choice of 
DOACs for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
fibrillation. Several DOACs are of net benefit compared 
with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would 
overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be 
made through network meta-analysis.

Introduction
The prevalence of atrial fibrillation roughly doubles 
with each decade of age, rising to almost 9% at 80-
90 years.1-3 Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of 
thromboembolic stroke fivefold, as a result of blood 
pooling in the left atrium and systemic embolisation 
to the brain. More than a fifth of the 130 000 annual 
strokes in England and Wales are attributed to atrial 
fibrillation (annual incidence of 114 in 100 000).4 
Patients with thromboembolic stroke from atrial 
fibrillation have higher mortality, higher morbidity, 
and longer hospital stays than patients with other 
stroke subtypes.1
The oral anticoagulant warfarin, a vitamin K 
antagonist, is effective for prevention of stroke in 
patients with atrial fibrillation.5 However, bleeding 
associated with warfarin is among the top five reasons 
for hospital stays, secondary to adverse drug effects, 
in England.6 Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Anticoagulants have an established role in the prevention of stroke in patients 
with atrial fibrillation
Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) overcome some of the limitations of 
warfarin which include monitoring, slow onset of action, bridging, and multiple 
drug interactions
Randomised controlled trials, and meta-analyses of these trials, suggest that 
DOACs, as a class, reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolic events compared 
with warfarin, and that they may be safer with respect to the risk of bleeding
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
DOACs, as a class, reduce the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality in patients with atrial 
fibrillation, and are safer with respect to major and intracranial bleeding than warfarin 
when used at doses to maintain an international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0
Our cost effectiveness analysis provides evidence that, despite their higher costs, 
several DOACs are preferable to warfarin
We found that apixaban 5 mg twice daily has the highest expected incremental net 
benefit, followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, 
and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily

index as well as problematic drug and dietary 
interactions. The international normalised ratio 
(INR) requires monitoring (through hospital, primary 
care, anticoagulation clinics based in pharmacies, or 
by home monitoring with clinic support) to ensure 
optimal warfarin efficacy while limiting the risk of 
bleeding. Such monitoring is a large proportion of 
the overall cost of warfarin use, estimated at £90 
million annually in the National Health Service (NHS) 
in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.7 Because 
of its perceived risk and inconvenience warfarin is 
underused, particularly in those at high risk of stroke.8 
It is estimated that only 46% of those who should be on 
warfarin are receiving it, with up to 40% of these not 
in the optimal therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0 INR units.7
Direct acting (non-vitamin K antagonist) oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) overcome some of the 
limitations of warfarin, offering important benefits 
that can improve quality of life for patients and their 
carers. The class includes factor II inhibitors (eg, 
dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (eg, apixaban, 
betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). DOACs 
do not require monitoring, have a more predictable 
pharmacokinetic (dosing) profile, and have fewer 
interactions with other drugs. Furthermore, they have 
rapid onset and offset of action, avoiding loading 
and use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 
for bridging. However, their cost is substantially 
higher than that of warfarin and will remain so until 
market exclusivity periods end and generic products 
become available (indicative dates 2022, 2018, 2023, 
and 2020 for apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and 
rivaroxaban respectively). Potential limitations of 
DOACs include class specific or drug specific cautions 
and contraindications, potential for subtherapeutic 
dosing, reduced adherence owing to lack of regular 
monitoring, absence of (or limited experience with) 
drug products to reverse the anticoagulant effects, the 
cost of maintaining stocks of different anticoagulants, 
and the potential for prescribing errors owing to 
unfamiliarity.9
Systematic reviews of randomised trials of DOACs 
have concluded that they have a similar efficacy to 
warfarin but may have some advantages with respect 
to the risk of bleeding.10-12 The DOACs have also been 
evaluated individually by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the respective 
technology appraisals have recommended their use.7 
However, no trials have directly compared different 
DOACs with each other, so it is difficult to determine 
which drug should be recommended as a first choice 
for most patients. It also remains unclear whether the 
higher costs of DOACs are offset by improved efficacy 
benefits or a reduced need for therapeutic monitoring, 
or both. In addition, the effects of DOACs may have 
been overestimated in clinical trials because some 
patients randomised to warfarin were not maintained 
within the therapeutic INR target of 2.0-3.0.13-15 We 
conducted a systematic review, network meta-analysis, 
and cost effectiveness analysis to compare DOACs with 
each other and with warfarin for prevention of stroke 
in patients with atrial fibrillation, and recommend a 
rank order based on efficacy, safety, and cost.
Methods
Study eligibility and selection
Our systematic review was prospectively registered 
with the National Institute for Health Research 
prospective register. Methods were in accordance with 
guidelines of the University of York Centre for Reviews 
and Dissemination16 and Cochrane.17 A detailed report 
of the methods and results is available elsewhere.18
We included phase II or phase III randomised 
controlled trials using either a superiority or non-
inferiority design, that evaluated the use of a 
direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC), vitamin K 
antagonist, or antiplatelet agent for prevention of 
stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. We included 
adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation eligible 
for oral anticoagulation. Trials in participants only 
eligible for parenteral anticoagulation were excluded. 
Unless otherwise specified, anticoagulation services 
may have been delivered in hospital, primary care, or 
pharmacy based clinics or through home monitoring 
and telephone support. The review was not limited to 
NHS anticoagulation services. 
We focused on five DOACs; four direct factor Xa 
inhibitors: apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and 
rivaroxaban, and one direct factor II (thrombin) 
inhibitor; dabigatran. The following direct factor 
Xa inhibitors were excluded: eribaxaban because 
the current stage of development was unclear; 
otamixaban because it is administered parenterally; 
darexaban (YM150) because it has been discontinued; 
and LY517717 and letaxaban (TAK442) because no 
information on any further clinical development was 
available. Two factor II inhibitors were also excluded: 
ximelagatran because it has been withdrawn as a 
result of liver toxicity and AZD0837 because it has 
been discontinued. Furthermore, we excluded trials 
comparing only different doses of the same drug, trials 
reporting only short term follow-up data (less than 
three months), trials of warfarin with target INR of 2.0 
or less, and one trial that included only patients who 
were without thrombogenic characteristics as detected 
using transoesophageal echocardiography.
To determine the comparator interventions, we 
constructed network plots to ensure they would 
provide information on the relative effectiveness of 
the DOACs of interest. Comparators were therapeutic 
doses of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonist (with 
optimal INR range 2.0-4.0), as well as aspirin and 
clopidogrel. We excluded studies evaluating a fixed 
dose of warfarin, and where warfarin administration 
for all patients had suboptimal target INR compared 
with UK guidelines (INR 2.0–3.0).
The main outcomes of our interest were decided 
from the network meta-analyses and chosen based 
on three considerations:1 their clinical importance;2 
the consistency of reporting across studies included 
in the network; and the amount of data available 
for inclusion in network meta-analysis.3 Outcomes

extracted included all stroke, stroke or systemic 
embolism, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, 
myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, all bleeding, 
minor bleeding, major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically relevant 
bleeding. Where necessary we derived numbers of 
compound events from components reported in trial 
publications.
We screened the studies included in previously 
published network meta-analysis of DOACs against our 
eligibility criteria. We developed searches to identify 
additional studies published from 2010 onwards, 
implemented in Medline (see web appendix 1), 
PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. We 
also searched the NHS Economic Evaluation Database 
and NICE Technology Appraisals, within The Cochrane 
Library. We applied no restrictions on language. 
We sought information on studies in progress, 
unpublished research, or research reported in the grey 
literature and searched ClinicalTrials.gov (to August 
2016). We screened reference lists of retrieved studies 
and relevant review articles.
Collection of data and assessment of the risk of bias
Two members of the review team independently 
screened titles and abstracts. We assessed full texts of 
all potentially relevant reports for inclusion, having 
collated multiple reports from the same studies. 
We extracted the following data: study details 
(identifier, study design, location, year, length of 
follow-up, and industry sponsorship); participant 
details (number of participants, age, and sex); 
intervention details (drug name, dose, and timing); 
comparator details; details relevant to the risk of bias 
assessment (including adherence to and withdrawal 
from randomised allocation); and effect modifiers. 
Multiple reports from a study informed a single data 
extraction form. We extracted dichotomous data as 
number of events in intervention and control groups 
and numbers of participants, and we sought details 
of follow-up time. We also extracted estimates of 
hazard ratios and their confidence intervals where 
available. We extracted intention to treat data where 
these were reported. Otherwise we extracted the data 
as reported (often a modified intention to treat based 
on, eg, all patients who received at least one dose of 
the study drug).
Data extraction and risk of bias assessments using 
the Cochrane tool were carried out by one reviewer 
(GNO) in a Microsoft Access data collection form, and 
checked by a second reviewer (PB).19 Disagreements 
were resolved by consensus or by referral to a third 
reviewer (PAD or JS) where necessary.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
We generated network plots of comparisons to illustrate 
which interventions had been compared within 
randomised trials (direct comparisons). Different doses 
or frequencies of administration (once daily or twice 
daily) of DOACs were analysed separately and hence 
appear as separate points in network plots. We defined 
two independent nodes for warfarin interventions, 
labelled as warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) and warfarin (INR 
3.0-4.0) respectively. The first of these formed the 
reference treatment across all networks. We also 
included in warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) some interventions 
with an INR range of 2.5-3.5 or 2.0-4.5. In some trials 
the INR range for some patients in the warfarin arm 
was subtherapeutic (below 2.0), so that the total INR 
range was 1.6-3.0. These interventions were excluded 
from the main analysis, but merged with the INR 2.0-
3.0 node in a sensitivity analysis.
We considered two separate nodes for antiplatelets, 
less than 150 mg once daily and 150 mg or more once 
daily. The dose range considered in the AVERROES20 
trial (81-324 mg once daily) was much wider than in 
any other trial, and we included this intervention in the 
lower dose node (<150 mg once daily) because some 
patients from that study had received a low daily dose. 
As a sensitivity analysis, we excluded the AVERROES 
trial from the network.
Where outcome data were presented for multiple 
time points, we took the longest period of follow-
up. For stroke or systemic embolism, we used the 
total number of stroke events if the former was not 
reported. When clinically relevant bleeding was not 
reported, we calculated it as the sum of the major 
bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events.
In the primary network meta-analyses, we treated 
data as binomial, modelling the number of events out 
of the total number of participants using a logistic 
model. We omitted trials with no events in any arm 
and where there were events in at least one arm 
of a trial but no events in one or more other arms, 
we added 0.5 events to all cells in the 2×2 table for 
that trial. As sensitivity analyses, we also undertook 
separate analyses for all outcomes where we took 
into account the different follow-up periods and the 
different reporting patterns considered across studies 
(see web appendix 3 and 4).
We conducted both standard meta-analyses of each 
pairwise direct comparison between interventions, 
and a network meta-analysis combining results of 
all these comparisons in one analysis, exploiting 
both the direct comparisons within trials and the 
indirect comparisons across trials for each outcome. 
The network meta-analyses used a logistic regression 
approach, implemented in a Bayesian framework 
using WinBUGS software (version 1.4.3).21 We used 
a fixed effect model, because the number of studies 
for each comparison was small. We present results 
as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and 
as rankograms displaying the probability that each 
intervention evaluated in phase III trials is ranked 
highest, second highest, and so on, for preventing 
each outcome. To assess consistency among sources of 
evidence, we back calculated the indirect comparisons 
of interventions from the network meta-analysis 
results and the direct comparisons. We first tabulated 
intervention effects for each DOAC against warfarin 
(mostly based on direct comparisons), and then 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

comparisons, derived from the network meta-analysis, 
between the DOAC dosing strategies that had been 
evaluated in a phase III trial. 
We prespecified important characteristics to be age, 
sex, ethnicity or race, body mass index or weight, renal 
status or creatinine clearance, blood pressure, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, previous thrombotic event, 
liver disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, pregnancy, 
intervention dose, mean time in warfarin therapeutic 
range, CHADS2 score, CHA2DS2-VASc score, HAS-BLED 
score, history of previous stroke or transient ischaemic 
attack, previous myocardial infarction, and summary 
assessment of the risk of bias for each outcome. We 
used meta-regression to determine the influence of 
these potential effect modifiers.
Cost effectiveness analysis
We evaluated the most cost effective first-line (initially 
used) anticoagulant for the prevention of ischaemic 
stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, from 
the perspective of the UK National Health Service 
(NHS). Only recommended doses were considered. 
Betrixaban was excluded from this analysis because 
of insufficiently precise evidence regarding efficacy. 
The base case was a cohort aged 70, modelled to the 
end of life. We used a discrete time Markov multistate 
model, with a cycle length of three months.22 The 
main assumptions and structure of the model are 
provided in web appendix 2. We estimated expected 
lifetime total costs and quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for a patient with atrial fibrillation, aged 70, 
beginning each first-line anticoagulation strategy. We 
estimated the net monetary benefit for each strategy 
using the willingness to pay threshold of £20 000 
(the amount the UK NHS is willing to pay for one 
year of perfect health, which is one QALY). Expected 
incremental costs, QALYs, and net benefit for each 
preferred strategy compared with warfarin INR 2.0-
3.0 were also estimated. We conducted a wide range 
of sensitivity analyses, described in web appendix 2. 
A key sensitivity analysis explored the price at which 
DOACs would have to be sold to become most cost 
effective.
Patient involvement
Two representatives (DE and ASB) of patient group 
charities (AntiCoagulation Europe and Thrombosis 
UK) participated in the design (as co-applicants on 
the grant application), conduct (including attending 
project meetings), reporting, and interpretation of the 
results of this study, and are included as co-authors of 
this paper. It was not evaluated whether the studies 
included in the review had any patient involvement
Results
Studies included
Figure 1 shows how we identified 23 completed, eligible, 
randomised trials involving 94 656 patients (see web 
appendix 3 for a summary of trial characteristics). 
All reports were written in English except for one 
paper written in Chinese that was translated with 
assistance from a native Chinese speaker.23 Sixteen 
trials, involving 97% of patients, were phase III. 
Where reported, the mean age of included patients 
ranged from 63.3 to 81.5 years (median 70.0 years); 
proportions of male patients from 44.9% to 82.9% 
(63.3%); and mean body mass index (BMI) from 24.4 
to 30.5 kg/m2 (28.0 kg/m2). The percentage of patients 
with previous stroke (5.0% to 63.8%, median 20.2%), 
hypertension (38.0% to 93.7%, 73.8%), and chronic 
heart failure (0% to 100%, 32%) varied across the 
studies. Mean time in therapeutic range for warfarin 
arms ranged from 45.1% to 83.0% (median 63.8%) of 
the duration of treatment.
Thirteen studies (six phase III 15 24-28 and seven 
phase II 13 14 29-33) examined one of the following direct 
acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs): apixaban,24 25 
31 betrixaban,32 dabigatran,13 28 33 edoxaban,14 26 29 
30 and rivaroxaban.15 27 Treatment durations ranged 
from three to 30 months: outcomes were reported 
at the end of the treatment period. Pharmaceutical 
companies sponsored 15 studies, including all those 
examining DOACs. Sponsor details were not reported 
in two studies. Table 1 shows the number of patients 
analysed and the number of events for the main 
outcomes reported in each trial (event counts for other 
outcomes are in web appendix 4).
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias judgments for studies contributing 
to analyses of each outcome are presented in web 
appendix 5. Most studies were judged to be at a low 
or unclear risk of bias for sequence generation and 
at low risk of bias for allocation concealment. Most 
studies were open label and were judged to be at 
high risk of bias for blinding of participants and staff. 
Most studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for 
blinding of outcome assessment and for incomplete 
outcome data.

Efficacy and safety results
A total of 27 different interventions were included in 
the network: the direct comparisons made for different 
outcomes are shown in figure 2 (efficacy outcomes) 
and figure 3 (safety outcomes). Table 2 shows evidence 
that apixaban 5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95% 
confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg 
twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once 
daily (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg 
once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) all reduce the risk of 
stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin 
INR 2.0-3.0. The risk of ischaemic stroke was lower 
for dabigatran (0.76, 0.58 to 0.98) but higher for 
antiplatelet interventions (<150 mg once daily: 1.61, 
1.25 to 2.07 and ≥150 mg once daily: 1.88, 1.40 to 
2.51) than for warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. Comparing DOACs, 
there was evidence of a higher risk of stroke or systemic 
embolism with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 
to 1.75) and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 
to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. 
There was little evidence that the risk of ischaemic 
stroke differed between licensed strengths of DOACs.
There was weak evidence that the risk of myocardial 
infarction was higher with dabigatran 110 mg twice 
daily (odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 0.97 
to 1.79), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (1.29, 0.96 to 
1.75), and edoxaban 30 mg once daily (1.22, 0.97 to 
1.53) compared with warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. The risk 
of myocardial infarction was lower with rivaroxaban 
20 mg once daily (0.80, 0.61 to 1.04) compared with 
warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. Between the DOACs, there was 
weak evidence that the risk of myocardial infarction 
was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily 
compared with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.48, 0.98 
to 2.2), and lower with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (0.62, 
0.41 to 0.93). The risk of all-cause mortality was 
lower with all the DOAC interventions compared with 
warfarin INR 2.0-3.0: odds ratios ranged from 0.83 for 
rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (95% confidence interval 
0.69 to 1.00) to 0.91 for dabigatran 110 mg twice daily 
(0.80 to 1.04) and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.82 to 
1.01). There was little evidence of differences between 
the effects of licensed DOACs on all-cause mortality.
Table 3 shows evidence that apixaban 5 mg twice 
daily (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.61 
to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 
0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 0.54), 
and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) 
all reduce the risk of major bleeding compared with

warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. Between the DOACs, there was 
evidence that the risk of major bleeding was higher with 
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with apixaban 
5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), with rivaroxaban 
20 mg twice daily compared with apixaban 5 mg twice 
daily (1.45, 1.19 to 1.78), and with rivaroxaban 20 mg 
twice daily compared with edoxaban 60 mg once daily 
(1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). There was strong evidence that the 
risk of intracranial bleeding was lower with apixaban 
5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, 
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 30 mg once 
daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban 20 
mg once daily compared with warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. For 
each of these DOACs and doses, except for rivaroxaban 
20 mg once daily, the estimated relative risk reduction 
for intracranial bleeding was more than 50%. There 
was strong evidence that the risk of intracranial 
bleeding was lower with apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
compared with the other doses of licenced strengths 
of DOACs. The risk of intracranial bleeding was higher 
with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily compared with 
apixaban 5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice 
daily, and edoxaban 60 mg once daily.
There was evidence that the risk of gastrointestinal 
bleeding was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice 
daily (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.20 
to 1.91), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.22, 1.01 to 
1.49), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.47, 1.20 
to 1.81) than for warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. The risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding was lower with apixaban 5 
mg twice daily than with other doses of DOACS.
The risk of clinically relevant bleeding during 
antiplatelet therapy <150 mg once daily was lower 
than with warfarin INR 2.0-3.0 (odds ratio 0.59, 95% 
confidence interval 0.45 to 0.77). There was evidence 
that the risk of clinically relevant bleeding was also 
lower with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.67, 0.60 to 
0.75), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.59, 0.54 to 0.64), 
and edoxaban 60 mg twice daily (0.84, 0.77 to 0.90) 
than with warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. However, edoxaban 
30 mg twice daily and edoxaban 60 mg twice daily 
substantially increased the risk of clinically relevant 
bleeding compared with warfarin INR 2.0-3.0. Between 
the DOACs, there was evidence that the risk of clinically 
relevant bleeding was higher with edoxaban 60 mg 
once daily compared with apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
(1.24, 1.09 to 1.42), rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
compared with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.53, 1.33 
to 1.75), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily compared 
with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.23, 1.1 to 1.37). 
In meta-regression analysis there was no evidence 
of effect modification owing to mean age, percentage 
of male patients, mean CHADS2 score, or mean time in 
warfarin therapeutic range for the main outcomes (web 
appendix 6). There were not enough data to analyse 
the influence of other effect modifiers. Furthermore, 
we found similar results after merging the warfarin 
interventions where the INR range was 1.6-3.0 with the

reference node (warfarin INR 2.0-3.0), after excluding 
the unusually large dose range considered for aspirin 
in the AVERROES trial, and with more elaborate 
models taking into account the follow-up periods and 
reporting patterns across studies.
Figure 4 shows that apixaban 5 mg twice daily was 
ranked as being the most effective intervention for 
several of the outcomes evaluated including stroke or 
systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and all-cause 
mortality. It was also ranked as being the safest with 
lowest incidence of major and gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Edoxaban 60 mg once daily was ranked second for 
major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Except for the 
outcome of all-cause mortality, rivaroxaban 20 mg once 
daily was ranked lowest of the DOACs. The non-DOAC 
interventions (warfarin dosed to achieve an INR 2.0-
3.0 and antiplatelet ≥150 mg once daily) were ranked 
lowest for stroke or systemic embolism.
Cost effectiveness results
Table 4 shows that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily had 
the lowest expected lifetime total cost (£23 064) for a 
patient aged 70 starting anticoagulation, followed by 
apixaban 5 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, 
warfarin, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily which had 
the highest expected lifetime total cost (£24 841), 
although there is substantial uncertainty around these 
estimates. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily had the highest 
expected quality adjusted life years (QALYs) (5.49), 
followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (5.45), 
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (5.42), edoxaban 60 
mg once daily (5.41), and warfarin (5.17), though 
again there is substantial uncertainty. Assuming that 
the UK NHS is willing to pay £20 000 for each year of 
perfect health (one QALY), all DOACs have a positive 
expected incremental net benefit compared with 
warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily has the highest 
expected incremental net benefit (£7533), followed by 
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (£6365), rivaroxaban 
20 mg once daily (£5279), and edoxaban 60 mg once 
daily (£5212). Apixaban 5 mg twice daily is the only 
DOAC for which the 95% confidence interval around 
incremental net benefit is positive, suggesting that 
apixaban is cost effective compared with warfarin. 
Similar results were found for the higher £30 000 
threshold. Uncertainty in the estimated total costs 
and QALYs is illustrated in the cost effectiveness plane 
(web appendix 7). Figure 5 shows that apixaban 5 mg 
twice daily has the highest probability of being the 
most cost effective product for prevention of stroke 
in patients with atrial fibrillation of the five selected 
for comparison. It has a probability close to 60% in 
the £20 000-£30 000 range of willingness to pay, 
which is the range generally considered by NICE. 
Warfarin and edoxaban 60 mg twice daily are unlikely 
to be cost effective. Sensitivity analyses, described

in further detail in web appendix 2, found that these 
results and conclusions were robust to changes in our 
assumptions. Dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban 
would have to be sold at the negative annual prices of 
-£280, -£1140, and -£1173, respectively, in order to 
become more cost effective than apixaban.
discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study of all currently 
licensed direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for 
stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation that 
has provided a rank order for their use, in terms of both 
individual efficacy and safety outcomes and overall cost 
effectiveness. DOACs appear to be at least as effective as 
warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke secondary to atrial 
fibrillation. They are associated with a reduced risk of 
bleeding compared with warfarin at doses to maintain 
an international normalised ratio (INR) between 2.0 
and 3.0, although the risk of bleeding with these drugs 
is still substantial and some patient populations still 
require monitoring between DOACs, based on network 
meta-analyses, suggested that apixaban 5 mg twice 
daily and edoxaban 60 mg twice daily reduced the risk 
of major bleeding the most compared with warfarin, 
while maintaining efficacy in reducing the risk of stroke. 
This advantage of apixaban offsets its slightly higher 
cost compared with other DOACs and thus apixaban 
is associated with the highest net benefit and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) in the cost effectiveness 
analysis. We found no convincing evidence of effect 
modification owing to mean time in warfarin therapeutic 
range, mean age, percentage of male patients, or mean 
CHADS2 score across the different outcomes.
Our study has several implications for clinical 
practice. Current NICE guidance does not indicate 
whether one drug with the same mechanism of action 
should be used over another.7 Providing evidence for 
development of prescribing guidelines is important 
for rational drug use, and may reduce costs of stocking 
multiple drugs. Our analysis indicates that, of the 
currently available DOACs, apixaban ranks highest on 
the balance of efficacy, safety, and cost. Policy makers, 
healthcare providers, and patients could therefore 
consider apixaban to be the first choice among DOACs 
for the prevention of stroke in most patients with atrial 
fibrillation, based on currently available evidence. 
However, clear guidance will be needed on the hierarchy 
of DOACs for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
fibrillation, specifically a treatment hierarchy and 
conditions under which alternative drugs from within 
the same class should be prescribed (eg, as reserve 
treatments for patients with specific contraindications 
or adverse reactions to apixaban). This approach 
should increase the use of this drug class, benefit 
patient safety, and lead to eventual cost savings.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
Our findings about the overall efficacy and safety of 
DOACs are consistent with previously published meta-
analyses and postapproval observational studies.10 12

34-36 The probabilities used in our cost effectiveness 
analysis for outcomes including stroke, major bleeding, 
and all-cause mortality are also comparable to those 
observed in recent prospective atrial fibrillation 
registry studies.37 A previous review with a similar 
analysis approach also ranked apixaban 5 mg twice 
daily and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily as the most 
cost effective drugs.38 However, this previous review 
only included five trials, hence there was considerable 
uncertainty around the conclusions and some relevant 
drug products could not be examined.
Recent studies have suggested that the efficacy 
and safety of dabigatran could be improved by 
monitoring the achieved drug levels, because these 
exhibit wide interpatient variation.39 This may 
reduce the convenience of this DOAC and increase 
its cost compared with warfarin or other DOACs. A 
question has also been raised about the efficacy data 
for rivaroxaban: the largest efficacy study used an 
INR testing device which gave faulty readings.40 This 
means that a proportion of patients on warfarin may 
have been underdosed, inflating the relative efficacy 
of rivaroxaban. However, the number of patients 
using the INR testing device was low. The FDA have 
reanalysed the data to assess the impact of the faulty 
readings on the results and concluded that the effects 
on stroke or bleeding rates were minimal.41
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
The strengths of our study include comprehensive 
coverage 
of 
current 
research 
findings, 
careful 
appraisal of study quality, a focus on clinically relevant 
endpoints, and comprehensive analyses allowing 
comparisons between DOACs as well as comparisons 
of DOACs with warfarin. Limitations relate mainly to 
assumptions underlying the network meta-analysis 
and to limitations of the primary data. There were no 
direct comparisons between DOACs, necessitating a 
network meta-analysis approach. We were unable to 
fit random effects models because few comparisons 
were replicated in two or more trials. The network 
meta-analyses assume that studies making different 
comparisons do not differ in participant characteristics 
that are associated with response to treatment (effect 
modifiers). Where data were available for meta-
regression analyses and comparisons of direct versus 
indirect sources of evidence, we observed no clear 
evidence of effect modification.
Table 1 shows that many of the outcomes extracted 
for our review were incompletely reported. Such 
incomplete reporting reduces precision, and is a threat 
to the validity of results of systematic reviews if non-
reporting of outcomes is influenced by the direction 
or statistical significance of the intervention effect. 
However, among the larger phase III trials comparing 
a DOAC with warfarin (ARISTOTLE, AVERROES, 
ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY and ROCKET AF) results 
for the following outcomes were all reported or could 
be derived from their components: stroke or systemic 
embolism, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, 
all-cause mortality, major bleeding, intracranial 
bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding. This gives 
some reassurance that the conclusions of our review 
are unlikely to have been substantially affected 
by bias owing to selective reporting of outcomes. 
It is nonetheless unfortunate that the outcome of 
clinically relevant bleeding was not reported by RE-
LY. Studies were generally assessed as having a low 
risk of bias except that most were open label so were 
assessed as having a high risk of bias owing to a lack 
of blinding.
Our findings are limited by the constraints of 
cost effectiveness analyses. These make long term 
projections on the basis of short term trial evidence, 
observational 
data, 
and 
clinically 
informed 
assumptions about treatment pathways and health 
state transitions. Furthermore, the profile of patients 
treated in trials may not be the same as those treated 
in practice. Older patients and those with multiple 
comorbidities, who may have a higher risk of bleeding 
than younger patients with fewer comorbidities, have 
been excluded from many trials. Finally, the long term 
safety of DOACS will only emerge as this drug class 
becomes more widely used in large patient populations 
in the future.
A head to head trial comparing different DOAC drugs 
would overcome the need for indirect comparisons to 
be made through network meta-analysis and improve 
the precision of estimates of relative efficacy and safety. 
Our cost effectiveness analyses are sensitive to these 
indirect comparisons, many of which are not precisely 
estimated. The analyses are also sensitive to costs, 
the effect of past events on future hazard ratios, and 
probabilities of treatment switching. A head to head trial 
would provide valuable information on these measures, 
although measuring all outcomes with sufficient 
precision would require a very large trial, which could 
be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the additional 
benefits and convenience for older patients and their 
carers are important factors to be considered.
Conclusion
DOACs appear to be at least equivalent to warfarin at 
preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation 
and to carry a reduced risk of bleeding. They 
overcome some of the limitations associated with 
warfarin and may lead to increased use by patients 
with atrial fibrillation. The cost of anticoagulation 
may be greatly reduced once generic DOACs become 
available, since they do not require monitoring, the 
major cost associated with warfarin use. Despite a 
similar mechanism of action, apixaban at the right 
dose appears to maximise efficacy and safety among 
the DOACs, with favourable cost effectiveness. Further 
long term data may bring other insights with respect 
to safety, and it is important to identify patient groups 
that may not benefit from DOACs, as well as to develop 
drugs to reverse the anticoagulant effects of each 
DOAC.9 Additional investments in new trials that 
address limitations of the current evidence may help 
practitioners and policy makers better understand the 
role of DOACs in this clinical setting.
