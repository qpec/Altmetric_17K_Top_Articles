Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was to determine whether short-term supplementation of a powdered
tart cherry supplement prior to and following stressful endurance exercise would affect markers of muscle damage,
inflammation, oxidative stress, and/or muscle soreness.
Methods: 27 endurance-trained runners or triathlete (21.8 ± 3.9 years, 15.0 ± 6.0 % body fat, 67.4 ± 11.8 kg) men
(n = 18) and women (n = 9) were matched based on average reported race pace, age, body mass, and fat free mass.
Subjects were randomly assigned to ingest, in a double-blind manner, capsules containing 480 mg of a rice flour placebo
(P, n = 16) or powdered tart cherries [CherryPURE®] (TC, n = 11). Subjects supplemented one time daily (480 mg/day) for
10-d, including race day, up to 48-hr post-run. Subjects completed a half-marathon run (21.1 km) under 2-hr (111.98 ± 11.
9 min). Fasting blood samples and quadriceps muscle soreness ratings using an algometer with a graphic pain rating
scale were taken pre-run, 60-min, 24 and 48-h post-run and analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measures.
Results: Subjects in the TC group averaged 13 % faster half-marathon race finish times (p = 0.001) and tended to have
smaller deviations from predicted race pace (p = 0.091) compared to P. Attenuations in TC muscle catabolic markers
were reported over time for creatinine (p = 0.047), urea/blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.048), total protein (p = 0.081), and
cortisol (p = 0.016) compared to P. Despite lower antioxidant activity pre-run in TC compared to P, changes from
pre-run levels revealed a linear increase in antioxidant activity at 24 and 48-h of recovery in TC that was statistically
different (16–39 %) from P and pre-run levels. Inflammatory markers were 47 % lower in TC compared to P over time
(p = 0.053) coupled with a significant difference between groups (p = 0.017). Soreness perception between the groups
was different over time in the medial quadriceps (p = 0.035) with 34 % lower pre-run soreness in TC compared to P.
Over the 48-h recovery period, P changes in medial quadriceps soreness from pre-run measures were smaller
compared to TC.
Conclusion: Results revealed that short-term supplementation of Montmorency powdered tart cherries surrounding
an endurance challenge attenuated markers of muscle catabolism, reduced immune and inflammatory stress, better
maintained redox balance, and increased performance in aerobically trained individuals.

 Background
Acute bouts of strenuous aerobic exercise facilitate a
stress response characterized by mechanical muscle dam-
age, oxidative stress, and inflammation that parallels the
physiological stress response associated with many adverse
traumatic cardiovascular events and illnesses [1–3]. As a
result, this type of long duration mechanical muscle stress
and high oxidative metabolic demand [4], significantly
increases free radical production beyond the capacity of
the endogenous antioxidant systems. Ultimately, this in-
crease facilitates excessive cell damage, altered cell signal-
ing [5–7], decreased cellular performance [5–8], lipid
peroxidation, oxidation of proteins and glutathione, and
subsequent DNA damage [3, 9]. Exercise-induced muscle
soreness is indirectly related to inflammation as a product
of high nociceptor and mechanoreceptor sensitivity to
potent metabolites released during muscular degeneration
[10, 11].
The use of antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C
[12–15] and E [4, 14, 15], in athletic applications to help
fortify the body’s endogenous antioxidant response has
spurred some success. However, vitamins C and E (inde-
pendently or in combination with N-acetylcysteine, β-
carotene, or α-lipoic acid) remain controversial due to con-
flicting reports of effectiveness [3, 16–19] with potential
post-exercise pro-oxidant effects on muscle protein anab-
olism [20–22], endogenous antioxidant capacity [22], and
mitochondrial biogenesis [23].
More recent nutritional research has focused on the
antioxidant effects of functional foods containing high
concentrations of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids
and anthocyanins. It is proposed that these may act syner-
gistically with other compounds contained within the food
to provide an overall aerobic exercise recovery benefit [4,
24]. A wide variety of antioxidant and polyphenol-
containing functional foods such as grape extract [25],
chokeberries
[26],
and
blueberries
[8]
have
shown
performance-enhancing and exercise recovery benefits.
Exercise-based research with similar functional foods
spurred investigation with tart (e.g. Mortmorency) cherry
concentrate and juice supplementation to help increase
performance by theoretically attenuating muscle damage,
oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with aerobic
challenges [7].
There are a few studies that have evaluated the effects of
tart cherry supplementation on responses to endurance-
based exercise. The first endurance-based study investi-
gated the effects of 8-d tart cherry cultivar-blended juice
supplementation on exercise-induced muscle pain sur-
rounding an endurance relay race event (running distance
= 22.5–31.4 km) [27]. Exercise-induced muscle pain was
reduced as a result of tart cherry supplementation, but
the findings were not confirmed by subsequent blood
marker analysis [27]. Following a similar 8-d tart cherry
juice supplementation protocol, a second study reported
greater lower body isometric strength and quicker restor-
ation of muscular function with reduced blood markers of
muscle damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation in re-
sponse to a marathon run [28]. A third endurance study
examined the effects of 7-d tart cherry concentrate sup-
plementation on physiological markers of muscle damage,
oxidative stress, and inflammation surrounding 3-d of
simulated high-intensity road cycling [4]. Similar to the
second study, reductions of oxidative and inflammatory
responses were the primary findings, thereby demonstrat-
ing a potential acute recovery-enhancing effect between
bouts of high-intensity aerobic exercise with tart cherry
supplementation [4].
The primary objective of this study was to determine
whether short-term (10-d) supplementation with a pow-
dered form of tart cherry skins would facilitate greater aer-
obic performance through attenuation of oxidative stress,
inflammation, muscle damage, and muscle soreness.
Methods
Subjects
Twenty-seven male (n = 18) and female (n = 9) endurance-
trained runners or triathletes (21.8 ± 3.9 years, 67.4 ±
11.8 kg, 15.0 ± 6.0 % body fat, 51.2 ± 11.4 kg free fat mass)
participated as subjects in this study. Subjects were re-
cruited through paper and electronically distributed flyers
at Texas A&M University. Entrance criteria required the
runners or triathletes to have been involved in a consistent
running program for at-least 1-year and able to run a half-
marathon (21.1 km) in less than 2 h. Figure 1 provides a
breakdown of the subject population. Subject discontinu-
ation of participation was not related to any aspect of the
supplementation or testing protocol.
All subjects signed informed consent documents and
the study was approved by the Texas A&M University
Institutional Review Board prior to any data collection.
Subjects were not allowed to participate in this study if
they reported any of the following: 1) metabolic disorders
or taking any thyroid, hyperlipidemic, hypoglycemic, anti-
hypertensive, anti-inflammatory (e.g. NSAIDs), and/or an-
drogenic medications; 2) history of hypertension, hepator-
enal, musculoskeletal, autoimmune, and/or neurological
disease(s); and 3) allergy to cherries or any cherry compo-
nents (e.g. polyphenols, anthocyanins, anthocyanidins).
Experimental design
The study was conducted in a randomized, double-blind,
and placebo-controlled manner (see Fig. 2). All subjects
completed a morning familiarization (FAM) session where
they were provided detailed information regarding the
study design, testing procedures, and supplementation
protocols. Informed consent, medical history, and endur-
ance training history questionnaires were also completed
Levers et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2016) 13:22

 during the FAM session. A nurse reviewed medical history
documents and performed a physical exam (resting vital
signs and lung auscultation) on each subject to ensure par-
ticipation eligibility. A fasting blood sample was taken at
the end of the FAM session. Approximately 10-d prior to
the endurance exercise intervention, subjects returned to
the lab for a morning baseline testing session to determine
body mass, height, and body composition. Following base-
line measurements subjects were matched based on average
reported race pace, fat free mass, body mass, and age and
randomly separated into two groups: 1) a placebo group or
2) a powdered tart cherry group. Subjects were instructed
to not change their dietary habits in any way throughout
the study. Nutritional habits were monitored through self-
dietary recall for 4-d (3 weekdays and 1 weekend day) of
the first seven supplementation days.
Subjects were instructed to begin supplementation 7-d
prior to the endurance exercise challenge (Day 0). Sub-
jects were asked to fast overnight for 10-h to account
for diurnal variation as well as abstain from exercise and
consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medi-
cations (NSAIDs) for 48-h prior to all testing days. On
the day of the endurance exercise challenge, the subjects
reported to the lab where body mass, resting heart rate,
and resting blood pressure were measured. Subjects then
donated a fasting venous blood sample (approximately
20 ml) using standard clinical procedures and rated percep-
tions of muscle soreness to a standardized application of
pressure on their dominant thigh at three designed loca-
tions using a graphic pain rating scale (GPRS). Twenty mi-
nutes prior to the start of the half-marathon race, subjects
were allowed to warm-up as they normally would before
running a road race. Subjects completed a half-marathon
(21.1 km) run outdoors at their normal race/competition
pace. Both water and glucose-electrolyte drinks were pro-
vided ad libitum to the subjects at regular intervals during
the race. Fasting (except 60-min post-run) blood samples
and GPRS ratings of quadriceps muscle soreness were

 completed at 60-min, 24 and 48-h of post-run recovery.
The last or tenth day of supplementation correlated with
48-hours post-run recovery.
Exercise protocol
Half-marathon (21.1 km) run
On the morning of supplementation day 8, all subjects
performed an outdoor half-marathon run (21.1 km) for
best time on a closed course under simulated race day
conditions. Race start (0800) conditions were: ambient
temperature = 22.8 °C, wind = 14.5 kph, humidity = 90 %,
dew point = 21.1 °C. Conditions at the race finish (1030)
were: ambient temperature = 25.0 °C, wind = 14.5 kph,
humidity = 86 %. The race was run completely on con-
crete and pavement surfaces. All subjects were given 20-
minutes for individual warm-up routines. At regular
intervals (4 total locations) throughout the race, fluids
(water and/or glucose-electrolyte beverages) were made
available ad libitum to the subjects. Each subject had
their own water and glucose-electrolyte beverage bottle
labeled with a number that corresponded to their race
number. All fluid bottles were weighed before and after
the race to determine fluid consumption for each sub-
ject. Official race splits and finish times were recorded
by designated lab staff. Following the race, subjects were
not allowed to run to cool down, only stretching and
minimal ambulation was permitted until the 60-min
post-run testing session.
Supplementation protocol
Subjects were assigned in a double-blinded and random-
ized manner to ingest a rice flour placebo (P, n = 16) or
powdered tart cherry (TC, n = 11). Subjects were matched
into one of the two groups according to average reported
race pace from previous (within the last 1 year) race
events, fat free mass, body mass, and age. Subjects were
instructed to ingest one 480 mg supplement capsule one
time daily directly after breakfast at 0800 for 7-d prior to,
the day of, and for 2-days following the half-marathon
race for a total supplementation timeline of 10-d. The tart
cherry supplements contained 480 mg of freeze dried
Montmorency tart cherry skin powder derived from tart
cherry skins obtained after juicing (CherryPURE™ Freeze
Dried Tart Cherry Powder, Shoreline Fruit, LLC, Trans-
verse City, MI, USA). Prior analytical testing conducted in
2012 by Advanced Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT, USA)
demonstrated that 31 mL (10.5 fl oz) of tart cherry juice
provides approximately 600 mg of phenolic compounds
and 40 mg of anthocyanins, which is equivalent to consum-
ing 290 mg of CherryPURE™. Using the same comparison,
the 480 mg CherryPURE™ supplement provided in the
current study would be equivalent to 51.3 mL (17.4 fl oz) of
tart cherry juice providing 991 mg of phenolic compounds
and 66 mg of anthocyanins. The supplements were pre-
pared for distribution by Shoreline Fruit, LLC and sent to
Advanced Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT, USA) to quan-
tify the nutritional contents of the powdered tart cherry
supplements. Both supplements were prepared in capsules
identical in taste and appearance. The supplements were
packaged in generic bottles by Shoreline Fruit, LLC for
double blind administration.
Procedures
Dietary inventories
Within the first 7-d of supplementation, subjects were
instructed to record all food and fluid intake over a 4-d
Fig. 2 Experimental study design. DEXA dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometer, MVC maximal voluntary contraction, 1-RM 1-repetition maximum, NSAID

 period (3 weekdays, 1 weekend day). Dietary inventories
were then reviewed by a registered dietician and analyzed
for average daily energy (total kilocalories), macronutrient
(protein, fat, and carbohydrates), and dietary antioxidant
(vitamins C and E, and β-carotene) intake using ESHA
Food Processor (Version 8.6) Nutritional Analysis software
(ESHA Research Inc., Salem, OR, USA).
Anthropometrics and Body composition
At the beginning of every testing session, subjects had
their height and body mass measured according to stand-
ard procedures using a Healthometer Professional 500KL
(Pelstar LLC, Alsip, IL, USA) self-calibrating digital scale
with an accuracy of ±0.02 kg. Whole body bone density
and body composition measures (excluding cranium) were
determined with a Hologic Discovery W Dual-Energy X-
ray Absorptiometer (DEXA; Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA,
USA) equipped with APEX Software (APEX Corporation
Software, Pittsburg, PA, USA) by using procedures previ-
ously described [29]. Mean test-retest reliability studies
performed on male athletes in our lab with this DEXA
machine have revealed mean coefficients of variation for
total bone mineral content and total fat free/soft tissue
mass of 0.31–0.45 % with a mean intraclass correlation of
0.985 [30]. On the day of each test, the equipment was cal-
ibrated following the manufacturer’s guidelines for quality
assurance.
Muscle soreness perception assessment
Pressure application to the three specified areas of the
quadriceps muscle group on each subject’s dominant leg
was standardized to 50 N of pressure using a handheld
Commander Algometer (JTECH Medical, Salt Lake City,
UT, USA). The standard amount of pressure was applied
to the vastus lateralis at both 25 and 50 % of the distance
between the superior border of the patella to the greater
trochanter of the femur at the hip and to the vastus medalis
at 25 % of the distance between the aforementioned land-
marks. These three specific locations were measured and
marked with a permanent marker on each subject during
the baseline muscle soreness perception measurement
before the half-marathon race. The subjects were asked to
maintain these three marked locations between testing
sessions to avoid error with secondary measurement. The
subject was seated in a reclined supine position and given
the algometer GPRS sheet to evaluate the perception of
muscle soreness at each of the three quadriceps locations.
The order of pressure application was standardized across
all sessions and subjects: 25 % VM, 25 % VL, and 50 % VL.
The 50 N of pressure was applied to a relaxed quadriceps
at each of the three locations using the algometer for a
period of 3-sec to give the subject enough time to record
their soreness evaluation on the GPRS. Perceptions of
muscle soreness were recorded by measuring the distance
(centimeters) of the participant mark on the GPRS from
0 cm (no pain). Reliability statistical analyses revealed a
mean intraclass correlation of 0.909.
Blood collection
Subjects donated approximately four teaspoons (20 mL) of
venous blood after a 10-h fast from an antecubital vein
using standard phlebotomy procedures. Blood samples
were collected in two 7.5 mL BD Vacutainer® serum separ-
ation tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA), left at room temperature for 15-min, and
then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10-min using a standard,
refrigerated (4 °C) bench top Thermo Scientific Heraeus
MegaFuge 40R Centrifuge (Thermo Electron North America
LLC, West Palm Beach, FL, USA). Serum supernatant was
removed and stored at −80 °C in polypropylene microcen-
trifuge tubes for later analysis. The multiple serum micro-
centrifuge tubes for each subject was allocated for a specific
group of assays and thawed only once during analysis.
Blood was also collected in a single 3.5 mL BD Vacutainer®
containing K2 EDTA (Becton, Dickinson and Company,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), left at room temperature for 15-
min, and refrigerated for approximately 3–4 h before
complete blood count analysis.
Clinical chemistry analysis
Whole blood samples were analyzed for complete blood
count with platelet differentials (hemoglobin, hematocrit,
red blood cell counts (RBC), white blood cell counts
(WBC), lymphocytes, granulocytes (GRAN), and mid-range
absolute count (MID) using a Abbott Cell Dyn 1800 (Ab-
bott
Laboratories,
Abbott
Park,
IL, USA)
automated
hematology analyzer. The internal quality control for
Abbott Cell Dyn 1800 was performed using three levels of
manufacturer control fluids to calibrate acceptable standard
deviation (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV) values for
all aforementioned analytes. Samples were re-run if the
observed values were outside control values and/or clinical
norms according to standard procedures. Reliability statis-
tical analyses revealed a mean intraclass correlation of
0.729 across all measures. Serum samples were analyzed
using a Cobas c111 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Indianapo-
lis, IN, USA) automated clinical chemistry analyzer that
was calibrated according to manufacturer guidelines. This
analyzer has been known to be highly valid and reliable in
previously published reports [31]. Each serum sample was
assayed for a standard partial metabolic panel [(aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
and total bilirubin)] and clinical markers of protein and
fatty acid metabolism [(uric acid, creatinine, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), BUN:creatinine ratio, total protein, and
creatine kinase (CK)]. The internal quality control for the
Cobas c111 was performed using two levels of manufac-
turer control fluids to calibrate acceptable SD and CV

 values for all aforementioned assays. Samples were re-run if
the observed values were outside control values and/or
clinical norms according to standard procedures. Reliability
statistical analyses revealed a mean intraclass correlation of
0.793 across all measures.
Markers of anabolic/catabolic hormone status
Serum samples were assayed using standard commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (ELI-
SAs) for cortisol and testosterone (ALPCO Diagnostics,
Salem, NH, USA). Serum concentrations were determined
calorimetrically using a BioTek ELX-808 Ultramicroplate
reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at an
optical density of 450 nm against a known standard curve
using manufacturer recommended procedures. Samples
were run in duplicate according to standard procedures.
Test to test variability of performing these assays yielded
average CV values for the aforementioned markers of:
CORT (±6.85 %), and TEST (±4.47 %) with a test retest
correlation for the same markers of: CORT (r = 0.92),
TEST (r = 0.98).
Markers of oxidative stress
Serum samples were assayed using standard commercially
available ELISA kits for Superoxide Dismutase (SOD Activ-
ity Assay kit), Total Antioxidant Status (TAS, Antioxidant
Assay kit), Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS,
Malondialdehyde-MDA, TCA method kit) (Cayman Chem-
ical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and Nitrotyrosine
(ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA). Serum concentra-
tions for SOD and Nitrotyrosine were determined calori-
metrically using a BioTek ELX-808 Ultramicroplate reader
(BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at an optical
density of 450 nm against a known standard curve using
standard procedures, while TAS serum concentrations were
analyzed calorimetrically at 405 nm. Lastly, serum concen-
trations for TBARS were determined fluorometrically using
a SpectraMax Gemini multimode plate reader (Molecular
Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at an excitation wave-
length of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 550 nm
against a known standard curve using standard procedures.
Samples were run in duplicate according to standard proce-
dures. Test to test variability of performing these assays
yielded average CV values for the aforementioned markers
of: SOD (±8.35 %), TAS (±14.24 %), TBARS (±8.30 %),
and NT (±10.03 %) with a test retest correlation for the
same markers of: SOD (r = 0.83), TAS (r = 0.85), TBARS
(r = 0.94), and NT (r = 0.99).
Cytokine/Chemokine markers of inflammation
Serum markers of inflammation [(interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13,
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF)] were measured by using a commercially available
Milliplex MAP 13-Plex Human High Sensitivity T-Cell
Magnetic Bead Panel kit (EMD Millipore Corporation, St.
Charles, MO, USA). A minimum of 100 positive beads for
each cytokine/chemokine was acquired with a Luminex
MagPix instrument (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX,
USA). Samples were run in duplicate according to standard
procedures. Test to test variability of performing these as-
says yielded an average CV value range of ±4.26 to ±6.05 %
for the aforementioned markers with an average test retest
correlation of r = 0.99 for the same markers.
Statistical analysis
Individual group and time data are presented throughout
as means (± SD), while group effects are presented as
means (± SEM). All related variables were grouped and
analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA in IBM
SPSS Statistics Software version 22.0 for Windows (IBM
Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Half-marathon finish
time was also used as a covariate in subsequent ANCOVA
analyses to determine if previously reported statistical out-
comes were attributed to running intensity or to supple-
mentation. Post-hoc LSD pairwise comparisons were used
to analyze any significance among groups where needed
with Cohen’s d calculations employed to determine effect
magnitude. Data were considered statistically significant
when the probability of error was less than 0.05 and con-
sidered to be trending when the probability of error was
between 0.05 and 0.10.
Results
Subject characteristics
A total of 27 healthy, endurance trained or triathlete men
(n = 18) and women (n = 9) completed the study protocol.
Participant demographic data are presented in Table 1.
One-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences
(p >0.05) in baseline demographic or anthropometric
markers.
Nutritional intake and compliance
Table 2 lists relevant nutrition components analyzed in the
4-d dietary recall. P tended to consume a smaller amount
of average daily calories compared to TC (31.0 kcal/kg vs.
37.4 kcal/kg, p = 0.094). This differential is likely due
dropped subjects (see Fig. 1) causing a greater proportion
of females in P (nf = 3/11, 27.3 %) versus TC (nf = 6/16,
37.5 %). When stratifying the statistical dietary analysis by
gender within each group, average daily calorie (p = 0.44)
and dietary carbohydrate (p = 0.64) consumption was the
same across groups. No other statistically significant inter-
actions were observed across groups with respect to dietary
intake.

 Half-marathon performance measures
Table 3 presents half-marathon split and finish times in
addition to projected versus actual average race paces.
There was no difference in projected race finish times
between groups (p = 0.304). TC subjects had faster half-
marathon split (p = 0.002) and race finish times (p = 0.001)
corresponding to a quicker overall race pace compared to
P. The actual race pace was slower compared to the pro-
jected race pace in both groups (p <0.001), but the differ-
ence tended to be smaller (p = 0.091) in TC compared to
P. Due to the significant difference in race performance,
half-marathon finish time was used as a covariate in sub-
sequent ANCOVA analyses to determine if other statis-
tical outcomes were attributed to running intensity or to
supplementation.
Markers of mechanical damage and physiological stress
Table 4 presents the serum mechanical damage and
physiological stress marker data. Serum creatinine and
urea/BUN makers increased on average 19 and 21 %,
respectively, over pre-run values during the recovery in
P, but only 6 and 3 % in TC. Serum total protein con-
tent increased on average 4 % over pre-run values dur-
ing the recovery in P, but decreased 3 % below pre-run
in TC. Significant (or trends approaching significance)
changes across groups and group differences over time
for creatinine (p = 0.047, group p = 0.007), urea/BUN
(p = 0.048, group p = 0.004), and total protein (p =
0.081,
group
p = 0.060)
were
further
supported by
ANCOVA analyses accounting for running intensity.
Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated a significantly
attenuated serum creatinine level 60-min post-run and a
mitigated urea/BUN response in TC compared to P 24-h
post-run (see Fig. 3). The total protein response never
increased above pre-run levels over the 48-h recovery in
TC compared to significant elevations 60-min and 48-h
post-run in P (see Fig. 4).

 Anabolic/catabolic hormone response markers
Table 5 demonstrates the serum testosterone and corti-
sol hormone marker response. Testosterone and corti-
sol demonstrated significant changes over time and
from baseline, peaking (elevated or depressed) 60-min
post-run. Significant group differences over time and
from pre-run levels were reported for serum cortisol (p
= 0.012, delta p = 0.016). Serum cortisol levels 60-min
post-run increased 44 % over pre-run values in P, but
only 15 % in TC. Subsequent post-hoc analysis indi-
cated significantly attenuated serum cortisol levels in
TC compared to P 60-min and 24-h post-run (see
Fig. 4). These results were supported when accounting
for differences in running intensity.
Markers of free radical production and oxidative stress
Table 6 shows the response of free radical production
and oxidative stress markers. None of the measures for
free radical production or oxidative stress demonstrated
significant changes over time. Serum TAS levels tended
to be different between groups over time (p = 0.089),
which was supported when accounting for running in-
tensity differences. Serum TAS levels decreased 1–8 %
from pre-run levels in P over the 48-h recovery, but
increased 15–31 % in TC (p = 0.046). Post-hoc analysis
revealed a linear increase in TC serum TAS activity
from pre-run levels that was statistically different from
P and pre-run values at 48-h of recovery (see Fig. 5).
Inflammatory response markers
Table 7 shows the serum inflammatory cytokine and che-
mokine marker response. Accounting for running inten-
sity differences, both IL-2 (p = 0.089) and IL-6 (p = 0.064)
measures tended to be different between groups over time.
Serum IL-2 levels increased 0.2 % from pre-run levels
throughout recovery in P, but decreased 28 % in TC.
Further, serum IL-6 levels increased 64 % from pre-run in
P, but only 17 % in TC. Delta post-hoc analyses demon-
strated significant attenuation of serum IL-6 measures 60-
min post-run in TC compared to P (104 % TC increase vs.
210 % P increase). Serum IL-2 significantly decreased in
TC compared to P and pre-run measures over the 48-h
recovery (see Fig. 6).
Anti-inflammatory response markers
Table 8 presents the serum anti-inflammatory cytokine
marker results. Accounting for running intensity, serum
IL-13 levels were significantly different across groups (p =
0.031) and tended to be different between groups over
time (p = 0.053). Serum IL-13 markers decreased 6 % on
average from pre-run over the 48-h recovery in P, com-
pared to a 13 % decrease in TC. Specifically, at 60-min
post-run, serum IL-13 markers increased 5 % over pre-run
values in P, but actually decreased 7 % below pre-run in
TC. The serum IL-13 group (p = 0.029) and group by time
(p = 0.014) differences from pre-run levels over the recov-
ery period were also significant (see Fig. 6).
Clinical markers of immune-related complete blood
counts
Table
9
demonstrates
the
immune
response-related
complete blood count marker results. All immune-related
complete blood counts demonstrated significant changes
over time (p <0.001), but no significant changes between
groups.
Muscle soreness perception assessment
Table 10 presents perceptions of muscle soreness. Percep-
tions were not measured at baseline. All locations of muscle
soreness measurement demonstrated significant changes
over time (p <0.001), peaking 60-min post-run. Significant
differences between groups over time were found in vastus
medalis (¼) soreness perception (p = 0.035) that was con-
firmed when accounting for running intensity discrepan-
cies. Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated significantly
attenuated (34 %) pre-run vastus medalis (¼) soreness in
TC compared to P with no differences in soreness per-
ception between groups over the recovery (see Fig. 7).
The change from pre-run vastus medalis (¼) soreness
was smaller in P soreness perception compared to TC
(p = 0.035) over the 48-h recovery. The other two loca-
tions of quadriceps soreness perception testing did not

Discussion
Previous research has investigated the efficacy of tart
cherry supplementation surrounding bouts of endurance
exercise, however, this is the first study to investigate the
effect of Montmorency tart cherry skin powder on acute
endurance performance recovery. It was hypothesized that
supplementation with this novel powdered tart cherry skin
supplement prior to a single bout of endurance exercise
would attenuate markers of muscle damage, oxidative
stress, inflammation, and perceptions of muscle soreness
in facilitation of faster recovery. Tart cherry ingestion
reduced post-run serum markers of muscle catabolism,
secondary muscle damage, and physiological stress over
the 48-h recovery period compared to the placebo. De-
creased muscle catabolism and stress are indicative of the
attenuated recovery inflammatory response reported with
tart cherry supplementation versus placebo. Antioxidant

 activity in those who ingested tart cherry was greater than
the placebo, particularly 24 and 48-h post-run. Despite
increases in actual over projected race pace times in both
groups, the tart cherry group demonstrated smaller pace
differences compared to placebo. Medial quadriceps sore-
ness in tart cherry supplementers was significantly lower
pre-run compared to those ingesting the placebo. How-
ever, results indicated a smaller change from pre-run med-
ial quadriceps soreness in placebo supplementers over the
48-h recovery period compared to the tart cherry group.
Examining subject endurance performance, the increase
in actual versus projected race pace irrespective of group is
likely attributed to the 10-h fast and blood draw on the day
of the endurance exercise challenge that would have not
been experienced prior to any other race. The apparent
beneficial effect of tart cherry powder supplementation on
endurance performance through a decrease in race comple-
tion time is consistent with some of the previously pub-
lished findings. Nieman et al. conducted a study in young,
healthy males with 2-wk of quercetin supplementation
(1000 mg/day) versus placebo [32]. Following a 12-min
treadmill running trial at a 15 % grade and self-selected
speed, Nieman et al. reported a significantly greater pre-
supplementation versus post-supplementation change in
distance covered with quercetin supplementation versus
placebo [32]. The polyphenol content of a fruit-derived
supplement similar to tart cherry was proven beneficial
after extended supplementation in a study conducted by
Kang et al. on regular endurance exercisers [33]. Kang et al.
demonstrated that 30-d supplementation of oligomerized
lychee fruit extract significantly elevated both submaximal
running time and anaerobic threshold compared to a vita-
min C/E mixture and a placebo [33].
Attenuation of muscle catabolism and secondary markers
of muscle damage following prolonged endurance exercise
physiologically provides the body optimal conditions for
quicker recovery in preparation for subsequent perform-
ance bouts. Studying trained endurance runners, Kratz
et al. [34] analyzed hemodynamic clinical chemistry makers
before, 4 and 24-h post-Boston marathon. The results of
demonstrated significant increases in total CK, AST, ALT,
total protein, uric acid, total bilirubin, BUN, and creatinine
4-h post-race and confirmed significant elevations in CK,
BUN, creatinine, uric acid, ALT, and AST over pre-race
values 24-h post-race [34]. Bell et al. [35], in an acute
endurance study following a combination of cycling sprints

 and time trials, reported results similar to the current study,
demonstrating no differences in the CK response between
Montmorency tart cherry concentrate and placebo supple-
mentation. Unlike the current study, Howatson et al. [28]
following marathon running demonstrated a trend of lower
post-run CK levels when supplementing with tart cherry
juice compared to placebo up to 48-h of recovery. Despite
conflicting evidence among previous endurance-based tart
cherry research, the post-run collective attenuation of these
markers in the current study demonstrates a beneficial
effect of powdered tart cherry supplementation on indices
of muscle catabolism.
Previous research in the literature seems to conclude
that the inflammatory process is mediated by both pro-
inflammatory cytokines [36] and neuroendocrinological
factors [37]. However, it has also been demonstrated that
as major players in the development of secondary muscle
damage, neutrophils, may also amplify the release of in-
flammatory cytokines [38, 39]. Nieman et al. [40] supple-
mented trained cyclists with quercetin, quercetin-EGCG
(epigallocatechin 3-gallate), or placebo soft chews for 24-d
surrounding 3-d of consecutive bouts of 3-h submaximal
cycling. Nieman et al. [40] reported a significant decreases
in plasma concentrations IL-6 immediately post-exercise
on the third exercise day in the quercetin-EGCG group
compared to placebo [40]. Howatson et al. [28] reported
significantly
lower
inflammation
immediately
post-
marathon through analysis of IL-6 that coincided with
quicker recovery of knee extensor maximal strength fol-
lowing the marathon in Montmorency tart cherry juice
supplemented subjects compared to placebo. Coinciding
with the reduced inflammatory findings of Nieman et
al. [40] and Howatson et al. [28] following endurance
challenges, the current half-marathon study also re-
ported a post-run attenuation in IL-6 with powdered
tart cherry supplementation versus placebo. Similar to
the post-exercise reduction in anti-inflammatory re-
sponse (IL-10) in the quercetin-EGCG group published
by Nieman et al. [40], the powdered tart cherry group
in the current study also demonstrated similar changes
via an attenuated IL-13 response over the 48-h recovery
compared to placebo.
Glucocorticoids, specifically cortisol, released due to ac-
tivation of the stress response through muscle mechanical
microtrauma and ROS production have demonstrated an
immunosuppressive influence. Davison and Gleeson [41],
in an investigation of moderately trained males during
2.5-h moderate intensity cycling compared the effects of a
beverage containing a vitamin C supplement with and
without carbohydrate before and during endurance exer-
cise. This study by Davison and Gleeson [41] revealed a
significant increase in plasma cortisol levels immediately
and 1-h post-exercise in both the placebo and vitamin C
only supplemented groups with no significant difference
between these two groups at 1-h post-exercise [41]. The
addition of carbohydrates (alone or with vitamin C)
significantly lowered the cortisol response during the exer-
cise recovery up to 1-h post-exercise [41]. This result
potentially demonstrates lower physiological stress post-
exercise due to a higher energy state. The results of the
current study revealed a similar cortisol response 60-min
and 24-h post-run as both fasted groups demonstrated an
increase from pre-run values, but the placebo group
response from pre-run was significantly greater than the
tart cherry group. This cortisol response group difference
60-min post-run may be due to a combination of anti-
inflammatory and antioxidant effects of tart cherry
anthocyanins.
Due to the reduced cortisol response 60-min post-run
following tart cherry supplementation in the current study,

 it is likely that this anthocyanin-rich supplementation may
modulate endogenous cytokine secretion following stressful
exercise challenges. An acute supplementation study pro-
viding moderately active subjects with 48 g of anthocyanin-
rich black currant extract immediately surrounding a single
bout of high-intensity rowing conducted by Lyall et al. [42]
demonstrated a significant post-exercise attenuation of pro-
inflammatory cytokine production from LPS-stimulated
cells. Lyall et al. [42] postulated from subsequent in vitro
experimentation that this reduced cytokine production may
have resulted from anthocyanin-based inhibition of NF-κB-
mediated mechanisms. In the current study, attenuated IL-
6 and serum cortisol levels during post-run recovery in tart
cherry supplementers compared to placebo, demonstrates a
potential relationship between the perception of physio-
logical stress, regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines,
and cortisol release through NF-κB-mediation.
The attenuation muscle catabolic indices in the current
study may also be partially attributed to an improved
post-run redox balance with tart cherry supplementation

 compared to placebo. The greater antioxidant bioavailabil-
ity from functional foods, such as tart cherries, containing
high levels of flavonoids and anthocyanins [43], has been
hypothesized to beneficially support endogenous antioxi-
dant systems following strenuous exercise and excessive
ROS-production. Howatson et al. [44] analyzed plasma
TAS following a full marathon in trained endurance run-
ners, and found that TAS was significantly greater in the
tart cherry supplemented group compared to control up
to 48-h post-race [7, 28, 38]. Unlike the tart cherry group,
TAS levels dropped below baseline 48-h following endur-
ance exercise in the placebo group as they failed to
maintain redox balance. This discrepancy between supple-
mentation groups demonstrates possible tart cherry anti-
oxidant effectiveness on excessive ROS production during
bouts of endurance exercise [7]. Similar to the recovery
findings of Howatson et al. [44], the current study re-
vealed a linear increase in TAS activity culminating in a
48-h recovery TAS activity that was greater in the tart
cherry group compared to placebo. This demonstrates a
potential short-term antioxidant effect of powdered tart
cherry consumption surrounding a single endurance chal-
lenge with better achievement of redox balance compared
to placebo supplementation.
Additional redox research has reported changes in
exercise-induced oxidative stress utilizing TBARS ana-
lyses to measure lipid hydroperoxidation decomposition
products over time. Supplementing with a tart cherry juice
blend or placebo for 8-d surrounding a marathon run,
Howatson et al. [28] demonstrated significantly lower
TBARS levels 48-h post-marathon in the tart cherry sup-
plemented group versus placebo. In coordination with
Howatson et al. [28], Pilaczynska-Szczesniak et al. [26]
reported significantly attenuated serum TBARS levels at
1-min and 24-h post-2,000 m incremental rowing test
following 4-wk of chokeberry supplementation in trained
rowing athletes compared to those supplemented with a
placebo. In two more recent studies within the same
trained rowing athlete population used by Pilaczynska-
Szczesniak et al. [26], Skarpanska-Stejnborn et al. [45, 46]
reported no differences in post-2,000 m incremental row-
ing test TBARS levels following 4-5-wk of supplementa-
tion with either Rhodiola rosea L. extract or artichoke
extract. Contradictory outcomes across several studies
may be due to mode of exercise, training and nutrition
status, and duration of supplementation. Further, evidence
in the literature utilizing lipid peroxidation (TBARS as-
says) analysis has presented a potential lack of oxidative
damage detection specificity in human studies that may
also explain the variability in results between the current
and previous studies [4, 7, 35, 47].
As a highly reactive oxide metabolite of nitric oxide,
peroxynitrate-bound tyrosine residues forming nitrotyro-
sine (NT) was measured by Sureda et al. [48] following
supplementation of vitamin C + vitamin E surrounding a
half-marathon. Suerda et al. [48] reported a significant
increase in NT immediately post-race and 3-h post-race
in the placebo group compared to the vitamin C + vitamin
E supplemented group, indicating that antioxidant supple-
mentation may have a dampening effect on oxidation of
nitrogen-containing compounds with endurance exercise.
The current study, however, reported no differences in
NT levels over the study protocol or between supplemen-
tation groups. The outcome inconsistency may also be at-
tributable to the differences in the antioxidant supplement
and bioavailability, thus exhibiting a potential mechanistic
variability in whole fruit-derived versus extracted antioxi-
dant supplements (e.g. vitamins C and E).

inflammatory supplements on the perception of muscle

 soreness after an endurance exercise challenge is incon-
sistent within the literature. Close et al. [20] acutely
supplemented subjects with either ascorbic acid or a pla-
cebo surrounding an eccentrically braked endurance trial,
where physically active subjects ran downhill continuously
for 30-min. Close et al. [20] reported no significant differ-
ences in VAS pain ratings nor pressure algometry between
groups up to 14-d post-exercise on six lower extremity
locomotion muscle groups. With no effect on post-aerobic
exercise delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in addition
to previous evidence in the literature, Close et al. [20] sug-
gested a dissociation between post-exercise ROS produc-
tion and DOMS. Following a marathon running event and
a bout of high intensity stochastic cycling using a similar
200 mm VAS protocol, Howatson et al. [28] and Bell et al.
[35] respectively, reported no difference in DOMS ratings
between Montmorency tart cherry juice supplementation
and placebo up to 72-h post-exercise. Within the current
study, no quadriceps soreness differences were detected
between groups over the three recovery time points. Due to
the significant difference in pre-run medial quadriceps sore-
ness between supplementation groups, delta changes calcu-
lated from pre-run revealed greater recovery medial muscle
soreness with tart cherry supplementation compared to pla-
cebo. Without a baseline measure of quadriceps soreness
perception and a subject training load record surrounding
data collection, it is difficult to rationalize the pre-run
muscle soreness discrepancy. However, the variability in
soreness perceptions across muscle groups within the
current study compared to previous research may also be
due to the disparity in measurement protocol, supplements,
exercise modality, and/or subject pool training status.
Measurement of muscle soreness perception in the present
study utilizing both an algometer and a GRPS was imple-
mented to help ameliorate the purely subjective nature of a
VAS as the only measure of pain or soreness.
The strengths of the current study revolve around the
cohort of soreness measures and hemodynamic markers
that contribute a more comprehensive analysis to the exist-
ing body of published literature. Some of the more recent
endurance-based tart cherry supplementation research
studies have investigated phytonutrient effectiveness on a
comprehensive panel of hemodynamic markers, which will
allow for parallels to be drawn to the powdered tart cherry
supplement used in the current study. The current study
did not enter the study cohort into a previously established
race competition, but rather created a half-marathon race
exclusively for the study. The utilization of this sup-
plement within a trained population demonstrated its
effectiveness under normative training, diet, and perform-
ance conditions. Potential limitations and weakness of the
current study should also be considered. The placebo-
control matched design of this study was effective in
equalizing study subject exposure to the conditions of the
half-marathon irrespective of supplement group. However,
compared to previous research implementing a cross-over
design, some variability associated with subject pairing
may have been possible. Differences in aerobic state of
training beyond the study inclusion/exclusion criteria may
also have been a source of variability in study cohort
recruitment. Due to the large number of hemodynamic
markers measured in this study, the five selected time
points of blood draws over the course of the experimental
period may have not fully represented the pharmacoki-
netic profile of each marker. The major overriding
strength of the current study is that this is the first study
to be conducted utilizing a powdered form of tart cherries
rather than a juice or concentrate.
Conclusions
The findings of the current study revealed that consump-
tion of a Montmorency powdered tart cherry supplement
7-d before, the day of, and 2-d after completing an endur-
ance running challenge, appears to be an effective dietary
supplement that may help attenuate post-run markers of
muscle catabolism and physiological stress in aerobically
trained individuals. Attenuation of inflammatory markers
over the 48-h recovery also demonstrates significant prom-
ise with powdered tart cherry supplementation. Coupled
with the dampening of the inflammatory response, the
powdered tart cherry subjects seemed to better maintain
post-run redox balance compared to placebo supplemented
subjects. The initial effectiveness on aerobic performance,
serum markers of muscle catabolism, physiological stress,
and inflammatory mechanisms coupled with a more stable
post-run redox balance potentially indicates a reduction in
secondary muscle damage as a result of powdered tart
cherry supplementation. Despite inconclusive evidence
surrounding the perceptions of medial quadriceps soreness,
the primary findings of the current study demonstrate that
powdered tart cherry supplementation in endurance-
trained individuals provides similar benefits as previously
studied tart cherry juices or concentrates following acute
bouts of aerobic-based exercise.
