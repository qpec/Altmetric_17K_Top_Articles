iosynthetic human insulin and insulin analogues are the mainstay of insulin therapy for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes although 
access to human insulin at affordable prices remains a global issue. The world is experiencing an exponential rise in the prevalence 
of diabetes presenting an urgent need to establish effective diabetes therapy in countries burdened by inadequate health care 
budgets, malnutrition and infectious diseases. Recombinant human insulin has replaced animal insulins and animal-based semisynthetic 
human insulin thereby available in sufficient quantities and at affordable prices able to provide global access to insulin therapy. In many 
patients, analog insulins can offer additional clinical benefit, although at a considerably higher price thus severely restricting availability in 
low income countries. The approval process for recombinant human insulins (i.e. biosimilars) and analogue insulins is highly variable in the 
developing countries in contrast to Europe and in North America, where it is well established within a strict regulatory framework. This review 
aims to discuss the future access to human insulin therapy in a global context with an ever increasing burden of diabetes and significant 
economic implications.

The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that the total 
number of adults (20–79 years) living with diabetes in 2015 was 415 
million and that by 2040, the number is predicted to rise to 642 million 
(see Figure 1).1 In countries with a low healthcare budget, biosynthetic 
human insulin is the mainstay of effective therapy, and is now available 
from an increasing number of suppliers, at an affordable price locally. 
However, the overall cost of diabetes care has been increasing due to the 
dramatic and relentless increase in prevalence globally. A significant part is 
related to cost of insulin in the form of human insulin, and the much more 
expensive option of analogue insulins. Insulin therapy is indispensable 
in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and is essential for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), 
first presenting at an advanced stage or when orally active antidiabetic 
drugs (OAD) fail to maintain adequate glycaemic control with the many 
newer therapeutic options increasingly costly. The American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) estimates that the total cost of known diabetes 
 
in the US rose by about 40% over a five-year period from US$174 billion in 
2007 to US$245 billion in 2012.2 representing 20% of all healthcare dollars 
in the US. A significant part of this increase was attributed to the cost 
 
of new analogue insulins and new OAD drugs. 
In contrast, worldwide, the cost of recombinant human insulin has 
been decreasing, due to large-scale production, competition between 
insulin manufacturers in different geographic areas (for example, India 
and Asian countries). In the US, human insulin formulations are now 
often available from drugstore pharmacies without a prescription. This 
includes the classically low-priced category of insulin vials and syringes, 
and also some insulin pen devices. Interestingly, in the US recently a 
price differential has developed between regular human insulin and 
intermediate-acting human neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin.
The situation is very different in low-income countries, where access 
to recombinant human insulin formulations at affordable price levels 
remains to be established and/or maintained. This is very obviously a 
question to be addressed by national and regional healthcare systems.

EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
Globally, 12% of health expenditure is currently consumed by diabetes 
and diabetes-related complications with major differences related to 
the access to diabetes care and provision of effective medication.1 
The mean annual health expenditure per person with diabetes in 
2010 was highest in North America and lowest in South-East Asia (see 
Figure 3).3 The capital expenditures on diabetes per person per year 
also differed among different countries of the world,4 with half of all 
nations spending less than US$400, 42% of countries less than US$300 
and 20% allocating less than US$100 per person per year.5 The fraction 
of capital expenditure attributed to insulin therapy is particularly high 
in countries with low health budgets, because there are no other 
therapeutic options for persons with T1DM.
Many regions of the world, such as Asia, are currently experiencing a 
disproportionally large increase in the prevalence of diabetes, both T1DM 
and T2DM, due to more effective screening, enhanced early diagnosis, 
and changes in lifestyle due to rapid economic growth and urban 
development. In Asia, T2DM tends to develop at a younger age and in 
those with a lower body mass index than in Europe and North America.6 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the western Pacific 
region has 153 million adults with diabetes, which is substantially more 
than either in China (109.6 million) or India (69.2 million). On the continent 
of Africa, the expected rate of increase in prevalence of diabetes is 
amongst the highest in the world.7 In an assessment of the treatment 
options, the WHO has addressed issues on how to support the production 
of pharmaceuticals in Africa.8,9
Insulin by injection remains the most effective component of diabetes 
management.6,10 Therapy in T1DM needs to be initiated at or near the 
time of diagnosis. Therapy by insulin in T2DM is most often initiated 
when OAD drugs no longer achieve effective glycaemic control. 
Metformin is the most common first-line therapy,followed by the 
addition of a sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, an 
insulin sensitiser, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2(SGLT2) inhibitor 
or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonistas second line. 
Insulin-based therapy is usually the third line when orally active drugs 
fail.11 Insulin may be commenced at an early stage if on presentation 
the person with T2DM is markedly hyperglycaemic (glycated 
haemoglobin [HbA1c] >8%) with symptoms. Clinical evidence suggests

that the introduction of insulin earlier in the treatment of patients with 
T2DM can modulate the disease process and significantly improve 
glycaemic control.12,13 Where there is a strong rationale to initiate 
insulin therapy at an early stage of T2DM, selecting an affordable 
biosynthetic human insulin (or animal insulin) should be considered 
in preference to analogue insulins. Initiation of insulin therapy is often 
delayed, despite the evidence of chronic poor glycaemic control 
(‘clinical inertia’) or simply due to limited access. A GLP-1 receptor 
agonist is advocated when the body mass index exceeds 35 kg/m prior 
to or as add-on to insulin therapy. Therapy change always needs to 
 
take into consideration both the clinical situation and the patient’s 
preference. There are clinical situations when analogue insulins have 
important advantages, in paediatrics,14 in pregnancy15 and in Ramadan.16 
Many people with diabetes unfortunately remain in poor glycaemic 
control17,18 due to barriers such as compliance to therapy, patient and 
healthcare professional preferences, and resource allocation, all of 
which must be addressed.19 
Global availability of insulin 
The global supply situation for insulins has improved steadily since the 
early period, when animal insulins were gradually replaced by chemical 
synthesis of human insulin and semisynthetic human insulin,20 due 
to concerns about future limitations of supply. The global supply of 
recombinant human insulin and analogue insulins has improved steadily 
(Table 2). A recent market survey on global insulin supply concluded 
that at the moment, insulin production has been able to sustain 
the increase in demand.21 Significant inequalities exist in the global 
availability of human insulin at affordable cost in developing countries, 
often limiting access to this crucial therapy22 despite its inclusion in 
the WHO’s Essential Medicines List. Based on the International Insulin 
Foundation’s (IIF’s) assessment, the root cause relates to distribution, 
tendering and government policies which are all aimed at reducing 
diabetes-related expenditures.23 The situation is critical in countries 
with limited resources, where human insulin (formulations of soluble 
and NPH insulin) is the only affordable option. The introduction of 
analogue insulins24,25 and new injectable and orally active diabetic 
agents have contributed significantly to the steadily increasing cost 
of diabetes care in Europe and North America, with reimbursement 
 
an increasing problem restricting their availability.26 In the US, the use 
of insulin among privately insured adults with T2DM mellitus increased 
by approximately 50% between 2000 and 2010 (see Figure 3),27 which 
coincides with the widespread prescription of analogue insulins 
and recently developed coformulations, due to specific advantages 
of personal convenience and a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia.28 
In Europe, cost and re-imbursement remain critical issues for patient-
related decisions. However, many healthcare schemes retain human 
insulin on their essential drug lists and continue to encourage their 
use due to long-term established therapeutic efficacy.29 The three 
essential medicines for T2DM are metformin, sulfonylureas and human 
insulin.30 Metformin is available in generic form, with sulfonylureas and 
biosynthetic human insulin also now widely available. The global market 
for human insulin is dominated by three major insulin manufacturers 
including Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi. Prescribing human insulin 
formulations is a logical and practical approach to reducing costs, with 
the recent option of considering biosimilar insulin analogues, which 
involves complex and evolving approval procedures ongoing in Asia, 
India and Africa.22 
The global insulin market
When considering the cost of human insulin formulations (see Table 1), 
 
there is a clear cost benefit in favour of the classical vial and 
syringe formulations and the more convenient human insulin pen 
presentations. The cost difference of adopting formulations of analogue 
insulins has little justification for the vast majority of insulin-treated 
persons with diabetes. The price is on average fivefold higher for insulin 
analogues, although it is decreasing gradually in certain markets with 
the availability of biosimilar analogue insulins (for example, insulin 
glargine). However, currently the costs involved remains out of range 
for many developing countries. For basal insulin therapy, analogue 
insulins22 have advantages over NPH human insulin but cost remains a 
prohibiting factor in such countries.
Approved and marketed human insulin products 
In the WHO Essential Drugs List, insulin (soluble) and intermediate acting 
insulin (NPH) are listed without further detail or reference to products.31 
Brand names differ considerably by global region and a search using 
the international non-proprietary names (INN, insulin human) as well 
as careful identification of the specific formulations is recommended. 
In each case, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is recombinant 
human insulin.
There are currently three groups of recombinant human insulin 
formulations available for clinical use,32 which are characterised by their 
onset, peak action and duration of action which determines their clinical 
use. The groups are:
• Regular human insulin (short-acting soluble).
• Intermediate-acting human insulin (NPH) suspension with delayed 
onset and protracted duration of action.33,34
• Premix formulations provide both meal time and basal insulin supply, 
they contain a fixed ratio of soluble regular insulin and of NPH insulin 
suspension, in a range of 15–50% of soluble insulin.33 
Widely available recombinant human insulin brands include Insuman® 
(Sanofi, Paris, France), Humulin® (Lilly, Indiana, United States) and Novolin® 
(Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark).33 These insulin formulations are of 
consistent quality, with globally available documentation of product details. 
The premix formulations of recombinant human insulin with variable 
ratios of regular and NPH insulin, i.e. Humulin M2, M3 and M5, Insuman 
Comb 15, 30 and 50; and related Novolin premix formulations, such 
as Novolin 70/30, Novolin 60/40 and Novolin 50/50 need thorough 
 
re-suspension immediately before injection.25
In the last decade, an increasing number of ‘biosimilar’ recombinant 
human insulins have emerged from different pharmaceutical companies

in India, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Mexico and Poland, which 
were subsequently approved by their respective drug regulatory 
authorities. This provides an ever-increasing number of recombinant 
human insulin formulations (common INN insulin human), often marketed 
locally under different brand names and with limited supporting 
published documentation. All prescriptions need to include brand names 
to avoid mistakes when exchanging products (interchangeability). There 
is an ever-increasing number of formulations which do not provide either 
medical and/or pharmaceutical information.
Biosimilars of analogue insulins (recombinant)
There is currently considerable interest in the development and approval 
of biosimilar analogue insulins,29 in part due to patent expiration and 
the opportunity to substantially decrease clinical development costs 
and eventually the cost to the consumer.29 However, there is the 
need for rigorous documentation relating to the production process, 
pharmacokinetics (PKs), clinical efficacy and safety when compared with 
marketed analogue insulin products.35 The global access to ‘biosimilar’ 
analogue insulins is now relatively easy due to an ever-increasing number 
of manufacturers and production facilities involved.29,36 The decreasing cost 
of analogue insulins will encourage market competition and can eventually 
result in a further expansion of the global access to insulin therapy.37 
 
A panel of certified diabetes educators (CDEs) found that many patients 
would definitely use the more affordable biosimilar analogue insulin 
products, after strict evaluation to determine that they are equivalent to 
currently marketed insulin products in terms of safety and clinical efficacy 
based on rigorous quality, pharmacovigilance and risk-assessment 
procedures.31 Details of the procedures will differ considerably depending 
on established regulations.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval procedure refers to the 
need for preclinical, clinical and pharmaceutical information, including 
pharmacovigilance and a risk management plan.
• Detailed documentation for process of manufacturing and consistent 
quality assurance (details of biosynthesis process, purification and 
final insulin product).
• PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies are required to be conducted 
for bioequivalence using the glucose clamp technology.
• Evidence of consistent glucose control by HbA1c, pre-meal and post-
meal blood glucose profiles, seven-point blood glucose profiles, etc.
• Self-monitored plasma glucose (SMBG) profiles recorded by patients.
• Hypoglycaemia rates, by predefined criteria including plasma glucose 
monitoring where available, and by clinical evidence
• Comparative studies in patients with T1DM, versus approved 
marketed products.
• Comparative studies in patients with T2DM, versus approved marketed 
products and in other specific populations (paediatric, pregnancy etc.)
• Specific clinical studies on antigenicity and local reactions in people 
with T1DM. 
Pharmacovigilance studies are required for each biosimilar insulin 
product, for the lifetime of production, to detect any clinical effects 
which may be related to the methods used for production of the specific 
recombinant biosimilar analogue insulin preparation. Discussions on 
the price of recombinant insulin formulations are based on legal and 
governmental considerations in different countries worldwide. 
Interchangeability
One important practical consideration when choosing biosimilar 
human insulin products is its interchangeability, i.e. can a patient be 
switched from an approved product to a biosimilar formulation? Such a 
substitution when initiated and authorised by pharmacists may require 
identification by the INN and specific formulation (short-acting or regular, 
intermittent-acting, long-acting or premixed human insulin). 
Traceability 
After a change from one approved insulin product to another biosimilar, 
traceability is also very important. This requires identification of the initial 
and subsequent insulin product, both by the approved WHO INN and 
brand identification. Traceability is essential for any pharmacovigilance 
programme. This information is available from drug regulatory systems 
established by the country of origin (manufacturing site) and the Ministry 
of Health in that country or region. 
Future evolution of insulin therapy requires a full understanding by 
patients and healthcare professionals on the subject of human insulin 
biosimilars (a small, restricted group) and analogue insulin biosimilars. 
The majority of patients (66%) in a recent market research survey 
would consider using such biosimilar insulins, provided that the cost is 
decreasing but that efficacy and safety is maintained and confirmed.38 
The adoption of biosimilar insulin products is clearly a responsibility of 
the governmental authorities and/or health insurance systems. In clinical 
terms, there may be a benefit when changing from a recombinant human 
insulin to more expensive analogue insulins, e.g. in special populations 
 
of patients who require a faster onset, and/or a longer duration of action, 
a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, less weight gain and improved stability 
in insulin delivery systems. Implementation of such decisions then 
depends on local cost considerations.
Conclusions and future perspectives
The world is experiencing an exponential rise in the number of patients 
diagnosed with diabetes and requiring insulin therapy (diabetes 
pandemic). This is the main driving force behind the increased economic 
burden of diabetes in low-income countries.39 The rising cost of therapy 
in developed regions of the world such as North America and Europe is 
predominantly attributed to the introduction of the much more expensive 
new insulin analogues, the widespread introduction of continuous 
glucose monitoring systems e.g. continuous subcutaneous glucose 
monitoring (CSGM), and the ever-increasing number of expensive 
injectable and OAD drugs for T2DM. 
Clinical efficacy of recombinant human insulin has been well 
established over approximately 35 years of clinical use. Clearly, in low-
income countries the critical factor is to provide affordable access 
to recombinant human formulations. With respect to insulin therapy 
and improved management of T1DM and T2DM, validated diabetes 
education for patients and healthcare professionals alike is essential.8 A 
key issue is the earlier introduction of insulin treatment in T2DM, which 
has been shown to improve glycaemic control and thereby to retard and 
reduce the onset and progression of diabetes-related complications. 
These complications include amputations, visual loss and blindness,

coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), nerve 
and kidney damage and complications during diabetic pregnancy. In 
2012, a report from the London School of Economics estimated that 
the cost of prescribing medication for the complications of diabetes is 
around three to four times greater than the cost of prescribing effective 
diabetes medication early after establishing the diagnosis.40
Very distinct problems remain relating to insulin therapy, which includes 
its safe and effective application, glucose monitoring, management of 
hypoglycaemia and adherence to therapy.41 The problem of non-adherence 
is very real in low-income countries without fully developed patient 
support systems in place. One important aspect of improving adherence is 
to establish consistent access to human insulin at an affordable price level. 
Recombinant human insulin therapy is a confirmed and effective 
therapeutic option when supported by appropriate patient education.36 
The increasingly broad range of ‘biosimilar’ human insulin preparations 
now available in many countries requires specific education for 
healthcare professionals on prescribing and dispensing, when selecting 
human insulins products for clinical practice.42 In developed countries 
biosimilar human and analogue insulins are assessed by well-defined 
preclinical procedures and clinical studies, supported by post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance programmes.43 Clinical awareness of any changes 
in insulin quality is very important. Self-monitoring of blood glucose 
for several weeks after a change to or between biosimilar insulins 
will help to identify any batch-to-batch differences, thus enabling 
dose adaptation. Diabetologists are fully aware that patients’ insulin 
requirements change under different real-life situations and they should 
take this into consideration. Therefore, individual guidance, counselling 
and monitoring, while often elusive, remains an essential requirement 
to achieve better and safer glycaemic control, especially in patients 
requiring insulin therapy. Global availability of recombinant human 
insulin of consistent high quality is an important future step in the quest 
to improve the outcome for people with diabetes.
