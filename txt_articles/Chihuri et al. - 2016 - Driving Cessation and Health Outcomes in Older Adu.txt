OBJECTIVES: To determine what effect driving cessation
may have on subsequent health and well-being in older
adults.
DESIGN: Systematic
review
of
the
evidence
in
the
research literature on the consequences of driving cessation
in older adults.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Drivers aged 55 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Studies pertinent to the health conse-
quences of driving cessation were identified through a
comprehensive search of bibliographic databases. Studies
that presented quantitative data for drivers aged 55 and
older;
used
a
cross-sectional,
cohort,
or
case–control
design; and had a comparison group of current drivers
were included in the review.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Driv-
ing cessation was reported to be associated with declines
in general health and physical, social, and cognitive func-
tion and with greater risks of admission to long-term care
facilities and mortality. A meta-analysis based on pooled
data from five studies examining the association between
driving cessation and depression revealed that driving ces-
sation almost doubled the risk of depressive symptoms in
older adults (summary odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence
interval = 1.61–2.27).
CONCLUSION: Driving cessation in older adults appears
to contribute to a variety of health problems, particularly
depression. These adverse health consequences should be
considered in making the decision to cease driving. Inter-
vention programs ensuring mobility and social functions
may be needed to mitigate the potential adverse effects of
driving cessation on health and well-being in older adults.

ar ownership and driving are highly correlated with
independence and life satisfaction in older adults.1–4
In the United States and other industrialized countries,
driving is often the most-preferred mode of personal trans-
port, is regarded as an important aspect of personal free-
dom, and is associated with a sense of control over one’s
life.4–7 The capacity to drive is an important mechanism
through which many adults, young and old, fulfill their
social roles and engage with their environments.6 Driving
has also been identified as an important instrumental activ-
ity of daily living (IADL).7 In a study in Australia, older
adults rated driving as the second most important activity
of daily living (ADL) task, behind use of transportation
but ahead of leisure, reading, and medication manage-
ment.8
Driving safety is especially relevant given the growing
older adult population; the proportion of the U.S. popula-
tion aged 65 and older will increase from 13% in 2010 to
20% in 2040.9 Most adults continue driving in older age;
81% of the 39.5 million adults aged 65 and older in the
United States held a driver’s license.10 These older drivers
face unique challenges because driving is a complex task
that
requires
a
variety
of
skills,
including
physical,
cognitive, behavioral, and sensory-perceptual abilities.11
Because of age-related declines in health and physical and
cognitive function, driving becomes more difficult for older
adults. Many older adults eventually reduce or stop their
driving
activities,
which
may
have
adverse
health
consequences.12–14
Health problems are the most commonly cited reasons
for driving cessation.15,16 Several community-based studies
have identified specific medical and socioeconomic factors
associated with driving cessation, such as recent hospital-

 izations, neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease,
stroke), visual disorders (e.g., cataracts, retinal hemor-
rhage, macular degeneration), low income, and unemploy-
ment.15,17–19 Other factors that may precipitate driving
cessation include advice and warning from a physician,
crash involvement, and intervention from a family mem-
ber.2,20,21 Sociodemographic variables such as age, sex,
education, marital status, co-resident status, urban resi-
dence, and geographic location may also influence the
decision to cease driving.5,15,19,22–24
It is likely that the relationship between health status
and driving cessation is mutually causative; that is, declin-
ing health may lead to driving cessation, and driving cessa-
tion in turn may result in adverse health outcomes. In
addition, health declines can result from reduced access to
out-of-home medical care and difficulty picking up medica-
tions and making other health purchases. Although risk
factors for driving cessation have been studied exten-
sively,3,15,17–19,22 there is less research examining the effect
of driving cessation on health outcomes.13 The objective of
this review was to assess and synthesize evidence in the
research literature on the consequences of driving cessation
in older adults.
METHODS
This systematic literature review included a narrative syn-
thesis and a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis component
followed standard methodology and adhered to reporting
and procedures outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses25 and Meta-ana-
lysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.26
Eligibility
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included com-
munity-dwelling adults aged 55 and older, examined the
consequences of driving cessation, used an epidemiologi-
cal design (cross-sectional, cohort, or case–control) that
compared driving cessation with continued driving, pre-
sented quantitative data on any health-related outcome
(e.g., physical, social, emotional), and were published in
English
language.
No
date
restrictions
were
applied.
Qualitative
studies,
letters,
editorials,
opinion
pieces,
commentaries,
and
reviews
were
excluded.
In
this
review, driving cessation was defined as total discontinu-
ation of operating a motor vehicle for productive, social,
spiritual, or any other purposes. Studies that exclusively
focused on driving reduction, which implies some contin-
uation of driving, were excluded. Driving cessation could
be voluntary or involuntary, with or without loss of dri-
ver’s license.
Search Strategy, Data Sources, and Extraction
A medical librarian was consulted to review the search
strategy
and
terms.
Relevant
literature
was
identified
through a comprehensive search of the following electronic
databases on November 15, 2014: American Psychological
Association PsychINFO (1967-present), Scopus (1960-pre-
sent), Transport Research International Documentation
(TRID) (1970-present), Medline OVID (1946-present), and
MELVYL (the online catalog of the University of Califor-
nia
library
system)
(1970-present).
One
author
(SC)
screened all the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and
exclusion criteria. The full text of studies with uncertain
eligibility was reviewed using these criteria. Information
was abstracted from each included study on primary
author, publication year, country of study population or
where study data originated, study design, source of driv-
ing cessation status, comparison group, outcomes assessed,
methods of outcome assessment, and results. For the meta-
analysis, two authors (SC, GL) independently extracted the
data needed to calculate the individual odds ratio (OR)
and summary OR for the health outcome.
Quality Assessment, Data Synthesis, and Analysis
The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)27 for assessing the quality
of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses, as recom-
mended by the Cochrane Collaboration on bias assess-
ment.28 The best possible score varies according to study
design; higher scores indicate better quality. In this version
of the scale, the highest possible score is 9 for a cohort
study. For the cross-sectional studies, the NOS was modified
to disregard the follow-up period and absence of outcome at
the start of the study; the highest possible score was 10.
Because of the numerous possible health-related conse-
quences
for
driving
cessation,
studies
were
grouped
according to health outcomes for synthesis. The most-com-
mon health outcomes were identified and verified for con-
sistency
in
outcome
assessment
to
determine
their
inclusion in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was consid-
ered for health outcomes that were measured consistently
in at least five studies.
For each health outcome, the Q and I2 tests were used
to assess heterogeneity.29 P ≤ .05 and I2 > 0.5 were consid-
ered heterogeneous.29 When visual examination of results
and test statistics indicated homogeneity, results were com-
bined quantitatively. The individual odds ratio (OR) for
each study and the summary OR were calculated using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.30 A fixed-effects
model was used unless significant heterogeneity was present,
in which case a random-effects model would be preferred.
Data from each study were manually entered into the
appropriate
effect
size
column
in
the
Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis software; for studies reporting the standard-
ized mean difference (d), results were converted to ORs
using the following formula29:
Log odds ratio ¼ d pffiffiffi

p
where p is the mathematical constant. The variance of the
log OR was calculated using this formula29:

potentially
relevant
results;
24,362
duplicates
were
removed, leaving 202,048 citations to be screened. After
excluding studies that did not meet eligibility criteria, 161
studies were reviewed in full text (Figure 1), 16 of which
met the inclusion criteria and were included in this system-
atic review.
Study Characteristics
Twelve of the 16 studies were conducted in the United
States,1–4,14,17,19,32–36 two in Australia,6,20 and one each in
Finland31
and
Kuwait7
(Table 1).
Two
publications
reported outcomes from the same population sample (New
Haven Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies
for the Elderly).3,17 All but one study31 included adults of
both sexes. The majority included adults aged 65 and
older.
Included studies used cohort (n = 12) and cross-sec-
tional
(n = 4)
designs
(Tables 1,
2).
No
case–control
studies were identified. All included studies examined
potential confounding factors such as baseline health sta-
tus and sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, and
in some cases marital status and education. A variety of
health
outcomes
were
examined
in
the
16
studies,
including general, physical, social, and mental health;
entry to long-term care (LTC) facilities; and mortality
risk (Table 3).
Study Quality
Based on the NOS,27 all 12 cohort studies were of high
quality, with an average assessment score of 7.2 out of 9
(range 7–8). The four cross-sectional studies varied in
quality, with two scoring 9 out of 10 and two scoring 5
out of 10.
Summary of Findings
General Health
Four studies evaluated general health outcomes through
self-reported participant measures.14,31–33 One of these
studies14 found a rapid decline in general health trajectory
after driving cessation in adults aged 65 and older over a
5-year period. Nondrivers were significantly more likely
than drivers to report having poor health, as indicated by
scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-
Form Survey (SF-36), a widely used self-report measure of
health-related quality of life.32

HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF DRIVING CESSATION
335
 A Finnish study31 found that drivers were more likely
to assess their health as good (59.4%) than ex-drivers
(42.5%), and another study33 found that former drivers
had poorer overall health than current drivers, but because
both of these studies were cross-sectional, it is possible that
former drivers stopped driving because of poor health.
Physical Health
Of the five studies7,14,20,32,33 that found declines in physi-
cal functioning, three were cross-sectional,7,20,33 making it
difficult to discern temporality, but these studies showed
that former drivers had less participation in outside activi-
ties and lower productivity in daily life activities than cur-
rent drivers (Table 3). The association between driving
cessation and poor physical functioning was strong in lon-
gitudinal studies even after adjusting for sociodemographic
factors and baseline health. Although one study14 reported
a 6.7-point decline in the physical functioning domain and
a 12-point decline in the physical role domain of the SF-
36, they examined a small sample of ex-drivers (n = 37) in
a cohort of 690 older adults.
Social Health
Social health refers to the capacity to interact in society,
which can be measured according to social engagement,
social contacts, and satisfaction with social roles and social
support.7,14,20,32,34,35 Decline in social health after driving
cessation appeared greater in women than in men.14 The
reported declines in social health were not as rapid as
those in physical health.14,35 For example, one study34

HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF DRIVING CESSATION
337
 reported that, over a 13-year period, driving cessation was
associated with a 51% reduction in the size of social net-
works of friends and relatives, which was not mediated by
the availability of or access to alternative transport. In
addition,
support
from
family
and
friends
remained
unchanged. Former drivers were likely to spend less time
in social activities and more time in solitary leisure or to
abandon previous social activities.7,20
Cognitive Decline
One longitudinal study34 reported that former drivers had
poorer cognitive abilities as measured according to the
Mini-Mental State Examination than current drivers. Simi-
larly, another study1 found that former drivers had faster
cognitive decline over a 10-year period than active drivers
even after controlling for baseline cognitive function and
general health. Current drivers were also healthier and had
better cognitive function than former drivers in a cross-
sectional study.33
Entry into Long-Term Care
The only study24 to evaluate entry into LTC reported that
former
drivers
were
nearly
five
times
(hazards
ratio
(HR) = 4.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.26–7.21)
as likely as current drivers to be admitted to LTC facilities
(e.g., nursing home, assisted living community, retirement
home). Even after adjusting for marital status or co-resi-
dence, the authors found a strong association between
driving cessation and LTC entry.24 Having no other driver
in the house was independently associated with LTC entry
(HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.15–2.57).24
Risk of Mortality
There was a general agreement between the two stud-
ies32,36 that exclusively examined the relationship between
driving cessation and risk of mortality. One of these stud-
ies36 found that driving cessation was a strong predictor of
3-year mortality, with nondrivers four to six times as
likely to die as drivers after adjusting for baseline psycho-
logical and general health, sensory function, and cognitive
abilities. The other study32 found that 5-year mortality risk
for nondrivers was 68% higher than in drivers. The stron-
ger association reported in the first study36 may be due in
part to the fact that its study subjects were less healthy
than those in the latter.32
Depressive Symptoms
Five cohort studies2,4,6,7,14 that examined the effect of driv-
ing cessation on depressive symptoms in older adults were
included in a meta-analysis. Four of the studies reported sig-
nificantly greater depressive symptoms in ex-drivers after
adjustment for potential confounding factors. Effect esti-
mates did not show significant heterogeneity (Q = 3.266,
df = 4, P = .51; I2 = 0.000), indicating that the studies were
fairly homogenous, so a fixed-effects model was used. Over-
all, driving cessation almost doubled the risk of greater
depressive symptoms in older adults (summary OR = 1.91,
95% CI = 1.61–2.27) (Figure 2). A funnel plot for the five
studies did not indicate any major publication bias because
the summary OR was near the estimated effects from the
two largest studies. A cross-sectional study that used a dif-
ferent measure for depression also found that greater depres-
sive symptoms were associated with driving cessation.7
DISCUSSION
Driving cessation in older adults is associated with a vari-
ety of adverse health outcomes, particularly greater depres-
sive symptoms. These findings are generally consistent
with a previous review13 but update and expand the find-
ings of that review with more than 10 additional years of
empirical research. Evidence of the association between
driving cessation and depression is robust and compelling.
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in all five cohort

 studies included in the meta-analysis. Moreover, these five
studies were of high quality, as indicated by NOS scores.
With the exception of one study,4 the underlying popula-
tions studied were nationally representative samples of the
U.S. population. Because of the integral role that driving
plays in personal identity and independence, driving cessa-
tion may lead to psychological reactions.4 The perceived
loss of control that accompanies driving cessation may
partly explain the association between driving cessation
and greater depressive symptoms.6 Not much is known
about the extent to which existing transition services and
programs contribute to the maintenance of control beliefs
and social functioning, but studies have found that avail-
ability and access of alternative transport may not mitigate
the observed risk of increased depressive symptoms.2,34
Given the observational nature of the included studies, the
possibility that driving cessation and depression are both
consequences of some other common factor (e.g., declining
health) cannot be completely excluded. Nevertheless, addi-
tional research may identify effective interventions that
can avoid the worsening of depressive symptoms associ-
ated with driving cessation.37
Prior research reported conflicting findings on the
effect of driving cessation on general health. Although
some researchers found nondrivers to have more medical
conditions and poorer health than drivers,17 others have
reported the opposite.22,38 There is growing evidence that
driving
cessation
may
exacerbate
decline
in
general
health.32 The prospective nature of the study on health tra-
jectories,14 adjusting for baseline covariates, offers com-
pelling evidence of this effect. The conflicting evidence in
the literature might be explained in part by the fact that
healthier people adapt better to driving cessation than
those in poorer health.13 Additional large, prospective
studies controlling for location and medical conditions are
required to further establish the effect of driving cessation
on health.
Based on the current findings, driving cessation may
hasten declines in physical and social health in older
adults. Older ex-drivers tend to have markedly fewer out-
of-home activities as they substitute indoor activities for
outside activities.14 Although older adults tend to find sub-
stitute activities to do around the home,17 those activities
may not benefit physical functioning as much as produc-
tive work or volunteerism outside the home does. The
health implications of markedly poorer physical function-
ing are profound in terms of worsening of underlying
physical and emotional problems, deconditioning, and
need for support with IADLs. As older adults transition to
stopping driving, programs should be in place to facilitate
continued physical and social activities.
Although there were discrepancies in the assessment of
social functioning after driving cessation, the findings are
generally consistent. In some qualitative studies, older ex-
drivers mentioned loss of spontaneity and the increasing
need to plan things ahead of time,5,39 which can limit
opportunities
for
out-of-home
social
engagement
and
activities. Loss of social functioning appears to affect
women more than men, but women who voluntarily cease
driving seem prepared to adapt to a nondriving lifestyle,
whereas those who were forced to stop had a more diffi-
cult transition.39 Because of lifestyle changes, many older
adults may combine errands such as a trip to the drug
store with seeing a friend.5 Although declines in social
activities may be gradual,35 they have been found to
strongly mediate the association between driving cessation
and mortality over time.32
Exdrivers tend to have poorer cognitive abilities than
current drivers. Although most studies have shown that
declines in cognitive abilities contribute to driving cessa-
tion, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the effect of
driving cessation on cognitive abilities. Findings from one
study1 indicate a possible bidirectional association between
driving status and cognitive abilities.
Factors that are likely to precipitate mortality are
also likely to affect driving status, making it difficult to
establish a causal relationship between driving cessation
and mortality, but the two studies32,36 included in this
review adjusted for baseline covariates that could con-
found the association between driving cessation and mor-
tality. Both studies indicate that driving cessation is a
strong risk marker for mortality, possibly by worsening
the
diminishing
functional
capabilities
of
the
normal
aging process.
The
aforementioned
adverse
health
consequences
notwithstanding, reducing or ceasing driving in older
adults may have safety benefits. One study21 reported a
45% reduction in the annual rate of crash injury in medi-
cally unfit drivers after they received warnings from their
physicians.
Although this review provides an up-to-date synthe-
sis of the research literature on driving cessation and
health outcomes, it has several notable limitations. With
the exception of one study, the studies examining the
effect
of
driving
cessation
on
depressive
symptoms
included a self-report depression scale rather than a clin-
ical diagnosis and thus were able to examine changes
only on the scale and not in the proportion of partici-
pants classified as clinically depressed. In addition, the
assessments of other health outcomes varied substantially
across the studies reviewed. The use of standardized
measures could allow for quantitative synthesis to obtain
robust estimates of effect size. Two studies14,32 used
data from the same project, but the respective study
samples did not overlap. Finally, this review was limited
to studies published in English and excluded qualitative
studies, which can provide rich and deep—although not
generalizable—information about the effects of driving
cessation. Additional longitudinal studies using standard-
ized measures of health outcomes are needed to better
understand the effects of driving cessation on health and
well-being in older adults, particularly as to how these
effects may differ according to geographic location and
other driver characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS
There is mounting evidence that driving cessation in older
adults may contribute to a variety of health problems. Of
special note is the apparent effect of driving cessation on
self-reported depressive symptoms. Pooled data from five
studies indicate that driving cessation nearly doubles the
risk of greater depressive symptoms in older adults. The
strength of the association between driving cessation and

 self-reported depressive symptoms is generally consistent
across studies. This finding may be generalizable to the
older adult population in the United States because the
underlying population in four of the five studies came from
nationally representative samples in the United States, and
the fifth came from a fairly comparable Western Aus-
tralian population. This review also sheds light on other
health outcomes of driving cessation, including declines in
cognitive abilities, diminished physical and social function-
ing, and greater risks of LTC entry and mortality. These
adverse health consequences should be taken into consider-
ation when an older adult ceases driving. Access to alter-
native transportation may not necessarily mediate the
association between driving cessation and greater depres-
sive
symptoms.2,34
Effective
intervention
programs
to
ensure and prolong mobility and physical and social func-
tioning for older adults are needed.
