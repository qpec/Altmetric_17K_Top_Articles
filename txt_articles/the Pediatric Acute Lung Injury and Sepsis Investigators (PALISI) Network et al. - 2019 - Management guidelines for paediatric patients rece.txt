 Leukaemias are the most common childhood cancers, 
and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most 
common form of childhood leukaemia1. In the century 
following its first description, leukaemia remained a 
near uniformly fatal disease. In 1948, astute observations 
among children with leukaemia, made by Sidney Farber2, 
led to therapeutic breakthroughs — ushering in an era of 
hope. Since then, paediatric oncology cooperative group 
trials and pioneering work by E. Donnall Thomas on 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) among 
patients with leukaemia have led to dramatic improve­
ments in the cure rates of childhood ALL3,4. Despite 
improvements in overall remission rates (ORRs) for 
children with ALL, until now, the cure rates for chil­
dren with relapsed and/or refractory disease remain 
disappointingly low5,6. In the 1970s, E. Donnall Thomas 
considered a 15% salvage rate after disease relapse 
to be a promising result among a patient population 
 
with previously even more dismal outcomes7. Since 
that time, durable remission rates have increased, with 
other dramatic improvements in supportive care, such 
as antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, infection 
control, HLA tissue typing, immunosuppression, trans­
fusion support, and paediatric critical care management, 
resulting in improved patient survival.
In 2017, the FDA approved the first chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel, 
which has been associated with ORRs of almost 90% 
among children and young adults with B cell precursor 
ALL that is treatment refractory or in second or later 
relapse8,9. Notably, this novel genetically engineered, 
CD19­targeted, autologous T cell immunotherapy 
was approved specifically for a paediatric and young 
adult indication. While CAR T cell immunotherapy is 
an exciting paradigm shift in anticancer therapy, this 
treatment modality is associated with unique toxicities,

Abstract | In 2017 
, an autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy indicated for 
children and young adults with relapsed and/or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
became the first gene therapy to be approved in the USA. This innovative form of cellular 
immunotherapy has been associated with remarkable response rates but is also associated with 
unique and often severe toxicities, which can lead to rapid cardiorespiratory and/or neurological 
deterioration. Multidisciplinary medical vigilance and the requisite health- 
care infrastructure are 
imperative to ensuring optimal patient outcomes, especially as these therapies transition from 
research protocols to standard care. Herein, authors representing the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury 
and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) 
Subgroup and the MD Anderson Cancer Center CAR T Cell Therapy- 
Associated Toxicity 
(CARTOX) Program have collaborated to provide comprehensive consensus guidelines on the 
care of children receiving CAR T cell therapy.

 which can lead to very rapid and life­ 
threatening cardi­
orespiratory and/or neurological deterioration. Thus, 
this novel therapy requires the medical vigilance of a 
diverse multidisciplinary team — and the associated 
comprehensive clinical infrastructure — to ensure 
optimal outcomes.
CAR T cells are generated through genetic modifica­
tion of the patient’s own (autologous) T cells or those of 
an allogeneic donor. The isolated cells are activated and 
genetically modified via viral transduction or nonviral 
gene transfer10,11. Specifically, the modified CAR T cells 
express an engineered chimeric cell­ 
surface receptor 
comprising an extracellular antigen­ 
recognition domain, 
which is usually an antibody single­ 
chain variable frag­
ment (scFv), linked to at least one intracellular signalling 
domain — usually the CD3ζ chain of the T cell receptor 
plus one or more domains derived from co­ 
stimulatory 
receptors (such as CD28 or 4­1BB ligand receptor 
(4­1BB; also known as TNFRSF9)). The extracellular 
portion of the CAR enables recognition of a specific 
antigen (such as CD19), and the signalling domains 
stimulate T cell proliferation, cytolysis, and cytokine 
secretion to enable elimination of the target cell12,13. 
Autologous or allogeneic cells genetically engineered 
to express CARs targeting certain molecules commonly 
presented on the surface of cancer cells have been asso­
ciated with durable remissions among patients for whom 
no alternative therapies were effective14–27.
Cytokine­ 
release syndrome (CRS) and CAR T cell­ 
related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) are well­ 
described unique toxicities associated with CAR T cells 
and some other immunotherapies28–33; however, the 
pathophysiological mechanisms of both CRS and CRES 
remain poorly understood. Results from animal studies 
reported in May 2018 implicate recipient monocyte­ 
derived and/or macrophage­ 
derived IL­1, IL­6, and 
nitric oxide (and not CAR T cell­ 
derived cytokines) 
as the key determinants of the severity of CRS and 
CRES34,35. Indeed, CRS is a systemic inflammatory 
response caused by the CAR T cells and involving other 
immune cells that is typically characterized by fever, 
hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension, and multi­ 
organ 
dysfunction36. CRES can occur concurrently with CRS, 
following its resolution, or without associated CRS and 
is characterized by encephalopathy, delirium, seizures, 
and, rarely, cerebral oedema37. Almost half of all patients 
who receive tisagenlecleucel require intensive monitor­
ing and critical care support, predominantly owing to 
these toxicities9,38. CRS and CRES are generally reversible 
but can be fatal. Paediatric­ 
specific management guide­
lines, comprehensive training of interdisciplinary staff, 
effective communication, and an appropriately phased 
infrastructure to ensure that adequate resources are 
available should facilitate the early diagnosis and appro­
priate management of paediatric patients who develop 
CRS and/or CRES after receiving CAR T cell therapy as 
a standard of care or according to a research protocol — 
 
and thereby achieve optimal outcomes. Herein, we 
provide consensus guidelines for the use of CAR T cells 
in paediatric patients with cancer.
Guideline formulation
A panel of experts from the HSCT Subgroup of the 
Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators 
(PALISI) Network, the CAR T Cell Therapy­ 
Associated 
Toxicity (CARTOX) Program at The University of 
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, 
USA), and several other institutions with extensive 
interest and experience in CAR T cell therapy was con­
vened to develop these guidelines. The PALISI Network 
includes clinical researchers from >90 paediatric 
intensive­ 
care units across North America and beyond. 
The PALISI HSCT Subgroup is dedicated to improv­
ing the health and survival of children who require 
critical care during and following HSCT and cellular 
therapy through collaborative clinical and translational 
research. The guideline panel comprised a multidisci­
plinary and inter­ 
professional team, including physi­
cians with expertise in HSCT for paediatric and adult 
patients, translational immunotherapy researchers, 
paediatric intensivists, neurologists, paediatric nurses,

 advanced­ 
practice providers, pharmacists, clinical 
nurse specialists and nursing administrators, and 
health­ 
care administrators from a diverse group of 
medical centres. Using a modified Delphi method, the 
panel aimed to provide comprehensive guidelines for 
the safe administration of various CAR T cell therapies 
(standard of care and/or research protocol administra­
tion), the early recognition of CRS and/or CRES, and 
the management of these toxicities39. Levels of evidence 
and strength of recommendations were based on the 
classification schemes described by Shekelle and col­
leagues40 (Supplementary Table 1). A summary of our 
 
key recommendations and the associated level of 
 
supporting evidence are provided in Table 1.
Patient selection and evaluation
Currently, CAR T cell therapies are used mainly among 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory haematologi­
cal cancers or other high­ 
risk malignancies. As new 
genetically modified cellular therapies are developed, 
differences in a range of variables related to the source 
cell type (T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer 
T cells, and cytokine­ 
induced killer cells, among others), 
the engineered product (for example, the co­ 
stimulatory 
domains and gene transfer technologies used), the man­
ufacturing process and reagents, the primary disease, 
and host factors might influence the individual tox­
icity profiles. Thus, providers of these treatments are 
encouraged to adhere to product information labels and 
guidance from risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
(REMS) programmes as the products are approved by 
the FDA (Table 1).
Patient selection should be based upon the FDA­ 
approved indications and eligibility criteria used in 
pivotal studies but could potentially be tailored on the 
basis of emerging information relating to each new 
product (such as label updates). Patients should gen­
erally have an acceptable performance status according 
to the thresholds defined in treatment protocols and/or 
institutional guidelines, which might vary for different 
indications and products and depending on whether any 
deficiencies are secondary to disease­ 
specific manifes­
tations and thus likely to improve with primary disease 
response. Patients should be evaluated for uncontrolled 
infections, active graft­ 
versus­host disease (GVHD), or 
recent donor­ 
lymphocyte infusion (DLI), with a thresh­
old of at least 6 weeks between DLI and CAR T infu­
sion38. Patients with uncontrolled infection and active 
grade II–IV acute or extensive chronic GVHD should be 
excluded. In patients with prior GVHD, the GVHD must 
have resolved and the patient should not have received 
systemic immunosuppression. Consideration should 
be given to the sites of active disease and specifically to 
whether immune activation, such as tumour flare ‘pseu­
doprogression’
, could compromise vital organ function 
(for example, of the airway or central nervous system 
(CNS)). Patients with active CNS pathology should be 
selected with caution, particularly for products associ­
ated with CRES41–43. When feasible, baseline evaluation 
by interdisciplinary team members, such as intensive­ 
care physicians and neurologists, could help to guide 
patient selection.
As new products are introduced, programmes should 
establish minimum eligibility criteria for patients to 
receive each agent. These criteria could potentially be 
adjusted over time on the basis of published experience 
gained in larger cohorts of patients. Patients identified 
as candidates for CAR T cell therapy should rapidly 
be referred for financial counselling to avoid delays in 
accessing care related to insurance pre­ 
authorizations. 
For convenience, we have provided an overview of our 
general recommendation relating to CAR T cell­ 
therapy 
eligibility and monitoring evaluations in the form of a 
checklist (box 1).
Informed consent and assent
CAR T cell therapy is a potentially curative treatment 
but is associated with life­ 
threatening toxicities and 
can require long­ 
term local follow­ 
up evaluations and 
restrictions. Thus, detailed informed consent for ther­
apy should be obtained from the patient and/or their 
guardians; when appropriate, child assent should also be 
obtained44 (Table 1). Incorporation of child life and psy­
chological services in assent discussions might be helpful. 
In addition, capable patients should be asked to consider 
age­ 
appropriate advanced medical directives. Even before 
leukapheresis is performed, the patient and/or their 
guardians should be informed about the potential bene­
fits of CAR T cell therapy, as well as the potential toxicities 
and other risks associated with the procedure. Consent for 
CAR T cell manufacturing and therapy should encom­
pass leukapheresis, lymphodepletion therapy, CRS and 
CRES, and the potential need for bridging chemotherapy, 
intensive­ 
care support (including intubation and mechan­
ical ventilation, vasopressor and/or inotropic support, 
renal replacement therapy, and intracranial hypertension 
management after transfer to the intensive­ 
care unit), and 
anti­ 
IL­6 therapy38. Patients should be aware that, even 
if the CAR T cell product is manufactured successfully, 
infusion of the product is contingent upon continued 
clinical eligibility. Patients should also be informed of the 
need to remain within 2 hours of the treatment facility for 
at least 4 weeks following infusion and of any other special 
precautions and limitations required during post­ 
infusion 
monitoring after treatment with specific products 
 
(for example, limitation of driving)8.
Leukapheresis for CAR T cell production
Generation of autologous CAR T cells requires the col­
lection of CD3+ lymphocytes from the patient through 
leukapheresis. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 
thresholds to proceed with leukapheresis can vary 
between different CAR T cell products; although an 
ALC of >100 cells/µl can be acceptable, >500 cells/µl 
(or an absolute CD3+ lymphocyte count of >150 cells/
µl) is generally preferred45,46. Patients should undergo 
pre­ 
collection testing to ensure that they are medically 
eligible to proceed with leukapheresis. Institutional or 
protocol­ 
specific guidelines should outline haemato­
logical and other clinical criteria to proceed with col­
lection. Paediatric patients can require a leukapheresis 
central venous catheter, rather than a peripheral venous 
cannula, for collection and should be haemodynami­
cally stable (that is, able to tolerate fluid shifts) and free

 symptoms50–54 (Table 1). Packed red blood cells (irradi­
ated) and/or albumin can be used to prime the collec­
tion in children weighing <30 kg. The targeted cell dose 
for leukapheresis can vary depending on the specific 
product and manufacturing process. Once an adequate 
quantity of cells has been collected, the cells are sent to 
the laboratory for CAR T cell manufacturing — a pro­
cess that typically takes 2–4 weeks8. Cell­ 
therapy pro­
duction, storage, transportation, and shipping should 
occur in compliance with the most current standards as 
defined by the Foundation of Accreditation of Cellular 
Therapy (FACT)55.
Allogeneic CAR T cells
Limitations of autologous CAR T cell therapy include 
the time required after leukapheresis to manufac­
ture the cell product (especially among patients with 
advanced­ 
stage disease and a very narrow therapeutic 
window), the cost of manufacturing a patient­ 
specific 
product, and the fact that adequate leukapheresis 
might not always be possible among heavily pretreated 
patients. Allogeneic CAR cells would presumably offer 
an ‘off­ 
the­shelf’
, third­ 
party approach to CAR­ 
based 
cell therapy56–59. CAR­ 
transduced cord blood­ 
derived 
NK cells have been reported to have potent anticancer 
effects in preclinical studies60. This allogeneic NK cell 
approach to CAR cell therapy might also be associated 
with a reduced risk of GVHD compared with the use of 
allogeneic T cells. Moreover, the NK cell product used 
included a ‘suicide’ gene — inducible caspase 9 — that 
could be pharmacologically activated to eliminate the 
transduced cells, thus providing an additional safety 
mechanism60. A clinical trial to test the safety and effi­
cacy of this product is currently underway at the MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (NCT03056339). In other 
allogeneic CAR­ 
expressing cell­ 
therapy approaches, 
functional co­ 
expression of RQR8, a construct com­
bining epitopes from CD34 and CD20, renders the 
CAR cells sensitive to the monoclonal anti­ 
CD20 anti­
body rituximab, as a safety feature56,61. Safety mecha­
nisms designed to eliminate transduced cells have also 
been added to autologous CAR­ 
expressing cells, such 
as anti­ 
CD19 CAR T cells also expressing inactive, 
truncated EGFR, which enables the cells to be targeted 
through administration of the anti­ 
EGFR antibody 
cetuximab49. The recommendations provided herein 
should be applicable to both autologous and allogeneic 
 
CAR­ 
based cell therapies.
Bridging chemotherapy
Some patients with high­ 
risk advanced­ 
stage malig­
nancies require bridging chemotherapy in the period 
immediately following leukapheresis. The goal of 
bridging chemotherapy is to maintain disease control 
and prevent progression (in addition to potentially 
decreasing tumour burden, which might reduce the 
risk of severe CRS20,29,62) while the autologous CAR 
T cells are manufactured rather than to act as a primary 
treatment of the disease20,62. During this 2–4­week 
period, patients should be monitored for tumour­ 
lysis syndrome (TLS) and should receive antimicro­
bial prophylaxis with routine infection precautions63. 
Indeed, the bridging chemotherapy regimen should be 
selected carefully during this critical period in order to 
minimize the risk of toxicities, which might disqualify 
the patient from proceeding to lymphodepletion and/
or CAR T cell infusion45. Several bridging chemother­
apy regimens are commonly used in paediatric patients 
(box 2); however, insufficient data are currently avail­
able to recommend an optimal regimen. This choice 
might be influenced by certain study protocol guide­
lines, characteristics of the particular CAR T cell prod­
uct, and/or patient­ 
specific clinical variables (such as 
prior response to particular chemotherapeutic agents 
and baseline organ function).
Preparative lymphodepletion treatment
Several lymphodepletion regimens are commonly used 
in the treatment of paediatric patients9,22,64 (box 3). The 
T cell pool is subject to homeostatic regulation; there­
fore, a lymphopenic environment might be favourable 
for adoptive T cell transfer owing to reduced compe­
tition for homeostatic factors. Indeed, the removal of 
‘cytokine sinks’ increases the availability of cytokines 
that promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival, 
such as IL­7 and IL­15, and can be a contributing fac­
tor to the effectiveness of tumour­ 
specific T cells65–67. 
Furthermore, the depletion of immunosuppressive 
CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells68–75 has been proposed as 
a key mechanism by which lymphodepletion augments 
adoptive T cell therapy76,77. Accordingly, lymphodeple­
tion has also been shown to improve the expansion and 
persistence of adoptive CAR T cells and to enhance their 
anticancer efficacy, resulting in increased ORRs64,66. Of 
note, the majority of paediatric patients enrolled in the 
trials of tisagenlecleucel completed lymphodepletion 
before CAR T cell infusion9,38. We recommend that all 
patients undergo lymphodepletion if possible (omis­
sion of lymphodepletion might need to be considered 
in patients with lymphopenia).
Cyclophosphamide­ 
based lymphodepletion regimens 
are commonly used before CAR T cell infusion, and the 
addition of fludarabine to lymphodepletion chemother­
apy has been associated with improved CAR T cell expan­
sion and persistence and prolongation of disease­ 
free 
survival in patients with ALL64,78. Alternative lympho­
depletion regimens (box 3) can be considered in patients 
with haemorrhagic cystitis and/or resistance to a prior 
cyclophosphamide­ 
based regimen9,46,64,79–81 (Table 1).
To proceed with lymphodepletion and CAR T cell 
infusion, patients should not have uncontrolled infec­
tion because hyperinflammatory states pre­ 
infusion 
have been associated with increased risks of morbidity 
and mortality49,82–84. Thus, an interval assessment should 
be performed on the day of initiation of the lympho­
depletion regimen to identify any new complications. 
This evaluation usually includes screening for signs and 
symptoms of active infection and/or new organ toxicity, 
as well as exclusion of pregnancy if indicated (box 1). 
Anticipatory guidance regarding the adverse effects of 
the specific drugs and treatment modalities used should 
be reviewed. Haemodynamic and laboratory monitor­
ing and hydration should be tailored on the basis of the 
selected lymphodepletion regimen.

 Cell infusion
Patients should not have evidence of uncontrolled infec­
tion and/or other contraindications before CAR T cell 
infusion. Contraindications include active or latent HBV 
infection, active HCV or HIV infection, severe acute or 
chronic extensive GVHD, and pregnancy8,37,38,49,82–85. If 
any of these features are present, CAR T cell infusion 
should be delayed to avoid potentially severe immune 
activation and associated sequelae.
At the time of infusion, oxygen, suction, and 
emergency medications, including adrenaline, should 
be readily available (box 1). The patient and/or their 
caregiver should be instructed to report symptoms, 
such as shortness of breath, rash, chills, chest pain, 
and back pain. Infusion should occur through the 
largest patent lumen without a filter and generally 
without an infusion pump. Pre­ 
medication with 
drugs including acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 
should be administered 30–60 mins before CAR 
T cell infusion8 in order to prevent infusion reactions 
related to cryopreservants, such as dimethyl sulfox­
ide. Corticosteroids should not be routinely used for 
pre­ 
medication, as these agents are lymphocytotoxic 
and, thus, their administration early in the treatment 
course (before CAR T cell expansion in vivo) could 
affect therapeutic outcomes20. With the use of CAR 
T cell products approved by the FDA, we recommend 
following the FDA­ 
approved package labelling; other­
wise, protocol­ 
specific guidelines should be followed. 
Vital signs and urine output should be monitored 
closely after the time of infusion.
Infusion of cellular therapy products is generally 
safe, although serious adverse infusion reactions can 
occur. Characteristic adverse reactions include nau­
sea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills, fever, and, rarely, 
severe respiratory depression, neurotoxicity, and cardiac 
arrhythmias86–93. General management principles for 
infusion reactions associated with adoptive cell therapy 
include consideration of slowing or halting the infusion, 
activation of emergency precautions, and confirmation 
of product details for accuracy. If symptoms resolve 
uneventfully without medical intervention, a serious 
infusion­ 
related event is unlikely to have occurred. If an 
infusion­ 
related event is considered likely, a transfusion­ 
reaction laboratory evaluation and appropriate support­
ive care according to institutional guidelines should be 
initiated94. Bacterial infusion reactions occur from infu­
sion of contaminated products, typically with Gram­ 
negative organisms; therefore, prompt treatment with 
appropriate antibiotics and supportive care for fever, 
severe hypotension, and other unexpected signs and 
symptoms is important to preclude clinical deterioration 
and potentially death.
Inpatient and outpatient management
Early recognition of toxicities of CAR T cell therapy, 
particularly CRS and/or CRES, in paediatric patients 
requires detection of variations from baseline in char­
acteristics including heart rate, blood pressure, tem­
perature, and irritability (box 1). Both the efficacy and 
toxicity profiles of CAR T cell therapy might vary 
depending on the specific product administered and 
individual patient characteristics. Thus, the decision 
on inpatient versus outpatient management of patients 
treated with CAR T cell therapy should involve consid­
eration of the toxicity profile of the product used, the 
clinical status of the patient (including risk of TLS), 
and the ability of the institution to deliver prompt and 
comprehensive outpatient management, as well as 
 
the ability of the patient to access such care. Given the 
potential for rapid clinical deterioration, if CAR T cell 
therapy is administered in an outpatient setting, a low 
threshold should be used for patient admission upon 
development of fever and/or other signs or symptoms 
that are suggestive of CRS and/or CRES38 (Table 1). The 
presence of a reliable, consistent, and well­ 
informed 
caregiver is essential to facilitate outpatient adminis­
tration of CAR T cell therapy. In instances in which 
patients are not admitted for CAR T cell infusion and 
CRS–CRES monitoring, adequate outpatient facilities 
are needed, with extended outpatient hours (as defined 
by the institutions), prompt access to emergency and 
critical care, and trained staff who are knowledgea­
ble of CAR T cell toxicity and are capable of prompt 
patient evaluation and management available at all 
times. This requires adequate outpatient space with a 
design appropriate to the protection of patients who 
are immunocompromised while they are being triaged. 
Moreover, rapid access to a cellular therapy physician, 
and pharmacy, laboratory, and transfusion medicine 
services should be guaranteed.
As products transition from research study proto­
cols to standard­ 
of­care administration, institutional 
guidelines should consider whether most patients 
require inpatient hospitalization during the pivotal tri­
als and/or what infrastructure is needed for outpatient 
administration. For example, during the international 
phase II ELIANA study of tisagenlecleucel in paediat­
ric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed and/
or refractory B cell ALL38, 76% of patients underwent 
cell infusions in the inpatient setting. CRS occurred in 
77% of patients, with a median time to onset of 3 days 
(range 1–22 days)38. Almost half of all patients required 
intensive­ 
care support, with a median stay of 7 days 
(range 1–34 days); intensive­ 
care support included the 
use of high­ 
dose vasopressors, oxygen supplementation, 
mechanical ventilation, and/or dialysis38. Neurological 
events occurred in 40% of patients, with the majority 
of cases occurring concurrently with, or soon after res­
olution of, CRS38. Two deaths occurred within 30 days 
of CAR T cell infusion (one patient died of cerebral 
haemorrhage and another died of progressive leukae­
mia)38. On the basis of the published experience with 
this product, considering inpatient admission for a 
 
minimum of 3–7 days following infusion is reasonable, 
especially as this treatment is increasingly being offered 
as a standard of care8,38 (Table 1). Nevertheless, the length 
of inpatient hospitalization and/or need for daily out­
patient assessments might vary on the basis of the risks of 
CRS and CRES, the clinical and developmental status 
 
of the patient, and the social support systems available to 
the patient at home. The risk of developing CRS and/or 
 
CRES probably depends on the patient, the source of 
immune effector used to manufacture the CAR T cell

 therapy, the specific CAR T cell product, and/or the 
associated lymphodepletion strategy.
Admission orders and handoff communication 
should include information regarding the patient’s base­
line heart rate, blood pressure, and mood, cognition, and 
developmental status. In addition to the aforementioned 
screening (box 1), continuous cardiac — and, if feasible, 
telemetry — monitoring should be strongly considered, 
beginning on the day of CAR T cell infusion (to ascer­
tain baseline physiology) and continuing for a minimum 
number of days following infusion (based upon peak 
incidence of CRS and/or CRES) or until any emergent 
CRS resolves. Sinus tachycardia can be an early present­
ing sign of CRS29,95, and recognition of this clinical find­
ing requires high vigilance and awareness of the child’s 
baseline heart rates as well as age­ 
specific normal values. 
To enable prompt medical intervention for these toxic­
ities, we recommend that patients have central venous 
access or a double or triple lumen peripherally inserted 
central catheter37. For patients with a history of, or pre­
disposition to, seizures or those with a high risk of CNS 
pseudoprogression (such as those with CNS disease, 
chloromas and/or leptomeningeal enhancements, or a 
prior history of seizures), a baseline neurology evalu­
ation, electroencephalography (EEG), and/or baseline 
MRI of the brain and spinal cord and/or anti­ 
seizure 
prophylaxis should be considered96.
We recommend that all patients have frequent 
physical examinations and laboratory monitoring 
with complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic 
panels, coagulation testing, and serum ferritin and C­ 
reactive protein measurements during the post­ 
infusion 
period associated with a high risk of CRS (as defined 
in pivotal studies and by emerging data for each prod­
uct)37,82,84 (box 1). Regular — daily, if possible — moni­
toring for TLS is also important, and TLS prophylaxis 
is recommended for patients with a high disease bur­
den16,29,37,82,84,96. In addition, infectious disease prophy­
laxis against viral, bacterial, and/or fungal pathogens 
should be prescribed as appropriate63,82. Patients should 
have adequate hydration with monitoring for acute 
fluid overload (daily weights and fluid intake–output 
recording). If needed, transfusions (irradiated blood 
products) should be ordered according to institutional 
guidelines for paediatric patients (without routine 
corticosteroid pre­ 
medication). The risk of bleeding 
 
can be exacerbated by hypofibrinogenaemia and/or 
thrombocytopenia, especially in patients receiving anti­ 
coagulation therapy (including through continuous 
 
venovenous haemofiltration)38,82,97. Conservative man­
agement of bleeding or hypofibrinogenaemia and/ 
or thrombocytopenia, with the use of cryoprecipitate or 
 
fresh frozen plasma, as needed, is recommended to 
avoid lethal haemorrhage82. Administration of growth 
factors (G­ 
CSF) should be considered for patients with 
neutropenic fever8,82. Conditional orders for fever and/
or neutropenia and suspected sepsis can enable rapid 
intervention, when needed, by the nursing unit, out­
patient triage personnel, and pharmacy. We recommend 
creation of a flag or banner in the electronic health 
 
system to alert care providers of patients who are CAR 
T cell recipients. Indeed, recipients of CAR T cell prod­
ucts should be made easily identifiable; in particular, 
the strong contraindication of these patients to steroids 
must be highly visible to avoid routine or accidental 
administration of these drugs (for example, during 
blood product and other pre­ 
medication orders). An 
‘as needed’ order, which requires a real­ 
time electronic 
approval by an authorized care­ 
provider, is recom­
mended in order to ensure rapid access to the correct 
dose of anti­ 
IL­6 therapy (for example, with the anti­ 
IL­6 receptor antibody tocilizumab) when required for 
the treatment of CRS and/or CRES.

 CRS monitoring, grading, and management
CRS reflects a systemic inflammatory response driven 
by rapid and excessive secretion of cytokines (a so­ 
called 
cytokine storm) that is associated with a spectrum of 
symptoms ranging from fever to multi­ 
organ dysfunc­
tion34,35. As mentioned previously, 77% of the paediatric 
and young adult population of the ELIANA trial devel­
oped CRS after treatment with tisagenlecleucel, with 
almost half experiencing severe symptoms requiring 
intensive­ 
care support38. In addition, 40% of patients 
developed CRES (grade 3 in 13%)38. Other notable 
adverse events included infection (in 43% of patients), 
cytopenias (grade ≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytope­
nia not resolved by day 28 in 35% and 7%, respectively), 
and TLS (in 4%)38. Patients with a high risk of develop­
ing severe CRS include those with early symptom onset 
(typically within 3 days of CAR T cell infusion), a high 
disease burden, and/or pre­ 
existing comorbidities9,20,22.
Early detection of CRS and/or CRES in paediatric 
patients can be challenging; however, early diagnosis 
of CRS and its prompt management can mitigate the 
risks of life­ 
threatening sequelae. We recommend that 
patients who show signs of CRS and/or CRES be admit­
ted for observation. The grading and management of 
CRS have been largely based on criteria originally out­
lined by Lee and colleagues29. In the January 2018 issue 
of this journal, Neelapu and other members of the MD 
Anderson Cancer Center CARTOX Program published 
updated and more­ 
detailed guidelines for the manage­
ment of adult patients with CRS37. Herein, these recom­
mendations for adult patients have been modified with 
input from the PALISI Network HSCT Subgroup to 
 
provide paediatric­ 
specific guidelines.
CRS grading according to the criteria outlined in 
Table 2 should be performed at least once every 12 hours 
and more often if a change in the patient’s clinical status 
or reasons for concern are noted (Table 1). Parent and/or 
 
caregiver concerns should be thoroughly investigated 
because early signs or symptoms of CRS can be subtle 
and thus might be best recognized by those who know 
the child very well98 (Table 1). For example, detection of 
CRS involving the gastrointestinal system often requires 
recognition of changes in the child’s food intake and/or 
the frequency and consistency of bowel movements, as 
well as expression of nausea. We recommend that CRS 
grading performed primarily by physicians, advanced­ 
practice providers, and bedside nurses be reviewed 
by interdisciplinary team members immediately after 
each assessment and, when possible, should include 
participation of the patient and/or parent or caregiver 
at the bedside. Nurses should ideally perform assess­
ments mid­ 
shift and jointly with incoming nurses dur­
ing handoff at the end of their shifts. In the outpatient 
setting, properly trained caregivers could potentially 
perform CRS–CRES assessment in lieu of twice­ 
daily 
clinical assessments by a health­ 
care professional, but 
this approach has not been validated.
CRS should be suspected if at least one of the fol­
lowing four symptoms or signs is present during the 
CRS­ 
risk period after CAR T cell infusion: fever ≥38 °C; 
hypotension (defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
<(70 + (2 × age in years)) mmHg for patients aged 1–10 
years or <90 mmHg for those aged >10 years, a change in 
SBP from baseline values, and/or a reduced requirement 
for chronic anti­ 
hypertensive medications); hypoxia 
with an arterial oxygen saturation of <90% on room 
air; and/or evidence of organ toxicity as determined 
using the most recent Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) grading 
system99 — bearing in mind specific considerations for 
paediatric patients29,37,82 (Tables 1,2). Frequent monitor­
ing of complete blood count, coagulation, and chem­
istry profiles, including serum levels of liver enzymes, 
C­ 
reactive protein, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase, 
might be useful for early detection of CRS.
While the criteria above provide general definitions 
of hypotension in children, it is important that the base­
line blood pressure range of each child be defined before 
CAR T cell infusion so that relative hypotension from an 
elevated baseline is not missed. Reduced requirements 
for chronic anti­ 
hypertensive medications can also indi­
cate relative hypotension. Furthermore, because some 
symptoms can be caused by other concurrent conditions 
(for example, sinus tachycardia can have causes that 
range from crying to sepsis), care providers must use 
their clinical judgement to determine CRS attribution. 
Patients who develop fever with a temperature >38 °C, 
for example, should be assessed for infection using blood 
cultures and chest radiography; additional tests, such as 
viral PCR, respiratory viral screening, urine cultures, 
and CT of the chest, should be obtained as clinically 
indicated. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be initi­
ated, and filgrastim should be considered if the patient is

 neutropenic and septic. Importantly, the patient’s orders 
should ensure triggering of such an escalation in care for 
a temperature >38 °C — some nursing units might be 
accustomed to higher temperature thresholds for inter­
vention. This practice might require re­ 
education of 
outpatient, emergency room, and triage staff that might 
not routinely care for patients treated with CAR T cells.
Careful vigilance for early recognition of haemody­
namic shock in the child is crucial. Symptoms such as 
malaise, lethargy, weakness, oliguria, irritability, and 
reduced appetite are not always self­ 
reported by younger 
children. Among infants, assessment of diapers will 
be critical to assess urine output and detect diarrhoea. 
 
We concur with recommendations that any patient requir­
ing a rapid increase in the dose of vasopressors or exhib­
iting evidence of end­ 
organ hypoperfusion should be 
treated intensively for grade 3 CRS, even if the vasopressor 
therapy required is ‘low dose’ according to the definition 
of Lee and colleagues29,37. For children with hypoten­
sion owing to CRS, an initial normal saline fluid bolus 
 
(10–20 ml/kg; maximum 1,000 ml) should be adminis­
tered; if no improvement is observed, anti­ 
IL­6 therapy 
should be initiated (Table 2). After administration of 
anti­ 
IL­6 therapy, the decision to repeat additional fluid 
boluses versus starting vasopressors should involve con­
sideration of the cardiac and fluid status of the child. For 
example, the administration of additional fluid boluses 
should be avoided in patients with underlying cardiac 
dysfunction and/or signs and symptoms of volume over­
load (such as pulmonary oedema). Additionally, early use 
of colloid solutions might be indicated because patients 
with CRS could potentially develop capillary leak and 
hypoalbuminaemia more rapidly than patients with sep­
sis, and the administration of additional fluid boluses 
might compromise pulmonary function by causing pul­
monary oedema. Care should be taken not to trigger acute 
fluid overload, cardiogenic shock, and/or respiratory 
compromise. Consideration should be given to adrenal 
insufficiency in decisions of the initial choice of corti­
costeroid intervention, if needed (Table 2); patients with 
vasopressor­ 
resistant hypotension attributed to adrenal 
insufficiency might respond to stress­ 
dose hydrocorti­
sone only and, thus, high doses of other lymphocytotoxic 
corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) 
can be avoided. Transfer to an intensive­ 
care unit should 
be considered early in this process (Table 1).
Grading criteria for CRS­ 
related hypoxia have pre­
dominantly been based upon fraction of inspired oxygen 
(FiO2) requirements and the need for mechanical venti­
lation29,37. In recognition of the differences in acute res­
piratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between adult and 
paediatric patients, a 2015 publication by the Pediatric 
Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) 
group provided paediatric­ 
specific definitions for pae­
diatric ARDS (P­ 
ARDS)100; these criteria have since been 
applied among paediatric patients who have under­
gone HSCT101,102. We recommend application of the 
PALICC at­ 
risk P­ 
ARDS criteria for the CRS grading of 
hypoxia100 (Table 1). Accordingly, the grading of CRS­ 
related hypoxia should be based on the use of high­ 
flow 
oxygen and other non­ 
invasive forms of mechanical 
ventilation, whereby flow rates and FiO2 are indicators 
of severity. For example, paediatric patients who require 
supplemental oxygen exceeding an FiO2 requirement of 
40% or those who are receiving non­ 
invasive mechanical 
ventilation should be classified as having grade 3 CRS 
and be managed accordingly (Table 2).
CTCAE v5.0 grading of organ toxicity provides an 
objective assessment tool, although high vigilance is 
important for prompt recognition of CRS among chil­
dren. Sinus tachycardia (according to age­ 
dependent 
definitions) is often the earliest sign of CRS103 (Table 1). 
Expected heart rate ranges should also incorporate the 
child’s baseline measurements at patient admission 
before CAR T cell infusion104. Acute kidney injury in 
children can be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria 
using the Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End­ 
Stage 
Renal Disease (pRIFLE) and Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions of oliguria and 
anuria105,106 (Tables 1,2).
In one study20, the use of high­ 
dose steroids to treat 
CRS was associated with suppression of CAR T cell 
expansion and unfavourable patient outcomes. However, 
no adequately powered randomized studies investigating 
whether the administration of anti­ 
IL­6 therapy and/or 
corticosteroids reduces the efficacy of CAR T cell ther­
apy have been reported to date. Notably, the use of anti­ 
IL­6 therapy and/or corticosteroids for the management 
of CRS (usually following CAR T cell expansion) has 
not negatively affected disease­ 
free survival outcomes 
in larger cohorts107,108. Indeed, the anti­ 
IL­6 receptor 
antibody tocilizumab is currently approved by the FDA 
for management of CRS109; patients weighing <30 kg are 
treated at a dose of 12 mg/kg, and those weighing ≥30 kg 
are treated at a dose of 8 mg/kg110 (Tables 1,2). Clinical 
responses following the administration of tocilizumab 
are often observed within 4 hours (ref.33). Patients who 
do not respond to the first dose of tocilizumab might 
be less likely to respond to subsequent repeat admin­
istration of this agent; for these patients, consideration 
should be given to administration of corticosteroids — 
weighing the risks and benefits of steroid use for CRS 
and the uncertain risk of suppressing CAR T cell expan­
sion — and/or alternative agents, such as the anti­ 
IL­6 
monoclonal antibody siltuximab37,38,111. Corticosteroids 
can also be administered concurrently with repeat 
doses of tocilizumab (Table 2). When corticosteroids 
are used, the taper should be rapid and individualized 
according to the patient’s response. The initial choice 
of corticosteroid (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, 
or methylprednisolone) will vary depending on insti­
tutional preference, protocol­ 
specific guidelines, or 
 
product label specifications.
CAR T cell therapy- 
related HLH
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare 
syndrome with severe clinical sequelae that result from 
a dysregulated, hyperinflammatory immune response112 
and can present in a primary (inherited) or a secondary 
form113. Secondary HLH is thought to occur in the con­
text of an underlying immunological condition and, in 
the setting of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, 
is often referred to as macrophage­ 
activation syndrome 
(MAS). The diagnosis of HLH is made on the basis of 
54 | JANuARY 2019 | volume 16 
www.nature.com/nrclinonc
ConSenSuS Statement
 the presence of mutations associated with primary HLH 
(such as mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, or STX11) and/or 
clinical and laboratory criteria, such as fever, cytopenias, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia, elevated 
serum levels of ferritin and liver enzymes, haemophago­
cytosis, low or absent NK cell activity, and/or elevated 
soluble IL­2 receptor levels113. Differentiation of primary 
HLH from MAS can be difficult, and distinction of sec­
ondary CAR T cell­ 
related HLH–MAS from CRS–CRES 
can be even more challenging owing to the overlapping 
symptoms associated with these conditions16,29,37,112. 
Future studies to define the role of genetic testing and 
functional analyses of NK cells might help identify 
patients who are at a disproportionately higher risk of 
 
this complication of CAR T cell therapy30. Nevertheless, 
diagnostic criteria for this rare toxicity have been pro­
vided in the guidelines for the management of adult 
patients treated with CAR T cell therapy published by 
Table 2 | Cytokine- 
release syndrome grading and management

Paediatric considerations
• Asymptomatic sinus 
tachycardia is defined by 
heart rates above the age- 
specific normal range or 
baseline values)
• Hypotension is defined as follows: SBP <(70 
+ (2 × age in years)) mmHg in patients aged 
1–10 years; SBP <90 mmHg in patients aged 
>10 years
• Oliguria is defined as a urine 
output of <0.5 ml/kg per hour for 
8 hours
• Anuria is defined as  
a urine output of  
<0.3 ml/kg per hour for  
24 hours or 0 ml/kg  
per hour for 12 hours
Management
• Acetaminophen, as needed, 
for fever
• Evaluate for infectious 
aetiologies (blood and 
urine cultures and chest 
radiography)
• Consider broad- 
spectrum 
antibiotics and filgrastim  
(if patient is neutropenic)
• Assess for adequate 
hydration

IL-6 therapy 
for persistent or refractory 
feverb
• Symptomatic management 
of constitutional symptoms 
and organ toxicities
• Manage according to recommendations for 
grade 1 CRS (if applicable)
• Administer i.v. fluid bolus of 10–20 ml/kg  
normal saline; repeat as necessary to 
maintain SBP above baseline or age- 
specific 
normal range
• For hypotension refractory to fluid boluses or 
hypoxia, consider anti- 
IL-6 therapy with i.v. 
tocilizumab (12 mg/kg for patients weighing 
<30 kg or 8 mg/kg for those weighing ≥30 kg, 
to a maximum of 800 mg per dose); repeat 
dose every 8 hours for up to 3 doses within 
24 hours (but titrate frequency according to 
response)
• If hypotension persists after two fluid boluses 
and anti- 
IL-6 therapy 
, start vasopressors, 
transfer patient to PICU, and obtain 
echocardiogram
• Use supplemental oxygen as needed
• If patient is at high risk of severe CRSc, 
hypotension persists after anti- 
IL-6 therapy 
, 
or there are signs of hypoperfusion or rapid 
deterioration, use stress- 
dose hydrocortisone 
(12.5–25 mg/m2 per day divided every 
6 hours; i.v. dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg 
(maximum 10 mg per dose) every 6 hours; 
or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg per day 
divided every 6–12 hours)
• Manage according to 
recommendations for grades 1 
and 2 CRS
• Transfer patient to PICU and 
obtain echocardiogram, if not 
performed already
• Administer i.v. dexamethasone 
0.5 mg/kg (maximum 10 mg per 
dose) every 6 hours; can increase 
dose to maximum of 20 mg every 
6 hours if patient is refractory 
to lower dose (alternatively 
, 
methylprednisolone  
1–2 mg/kg per day divided  
every 6–12 hours can be used)d
• Use supplemental oxygen, 
including high- 
flow oxygen 
delivery and non- 
invasive 
positive pressure ventilation
• Administer i.v. fluids, 
anti- 
IL-6 therapy 
, 
corticosteroids, and 
vasopressors and perform 
haemodynamic monitoring 
as described for grades 1, 2, 
or 3 CRS
• If low doses of 
corticosteroids do not lead 
to clinical improvement, 
consider high- 
dose 
methylprednisolone (1 g 
daily for 3 days followed by 
rapid taper on the basis of 
clinical response)
Early recognition of cytokine- 
release syndrome (CRS) and appropriate intervention are essential to avoid life- 
threatening complications of this toxicity. CRS should 
be suspected if any of the above listed signs and symptoms are present within the first 3 weeks after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. CRS grading 
should be performed at least twice a day and when a change in the patient's clinical status occurs. BiPAP
, bi- 
level positive airway pressure; FiO2, fraction of inspired 
oxygen; i.v., intravenous; PICU, paediatric intensive- 
care unit; SBP
, systolic blood pressure; SpO2, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation; ULN, upper limit of 
normal.aGraded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 guidelines99.bFor example, persistent fever lasting >3 days or fever 
with a temperature of ≥39 °C for >10 hours that is unresponsive to acetaminophen.cPatients with early onset of CRS signs and symptoms (within 3 days of cell 
infusion), bulky disease, and comorbidities are at high risk of developing severe CRS.dSimultaneous administration of corticosteroids and anti- 
IL-6 therapy or 
waiting to see if the patient responds to anti- 
IL-6 monotherapy before administering corticosteroids are both reasonable approaches (strategy used might vary 
depending on the CAR T cell products and/or risk factors).

 Neelapu et al.37 in this journal. Children can also be 
diagnosed with CAR T cell­ 
related HLH–MAS if they 
have a peak serum ferritin level >10,000 ng/ml during 
the CRS­ 
risk period and develop any two of the follow­
ing: grade ≥3 organ toxicities involving the liver, kidney, 
or lung; or haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow or 
other organs37. Patients who develop CAR T cell­ 
related 
HLH–MAS can be treated simultaneously with anti­ 
IL­6 therapy and corticosteroids (fig. 1); responses to 
anti­ 
IL­6 therapy alone might not be as common as in 
 
patients with CRS alone33. In addition, although HLH–
MAS occurring after treatment with CAR T cells and 
other T cell­ 
engaging therapies has typically been shown 
to resolve following administration of anti­ 
IL­6 therapy 
and/or corticosteroids30,62,96, refractory cases can require 
additional therapy, including consideration of systemic 
and/or intrathecal therapy according to the HLH­2004 
management guidelines113 or use of the IL­1 receptor 
antagonist anakinra62,114 (Table 1). Further research 
is needed, however, to optimize the diagnosis and 
 
treatment of CAR T cell­ 
related HLH–MAS.
CRES
Neurological symptoms associated with CAR T cell 
therapy, referred to as CRES, commonly present as a 
toxic encephalopathy with delirium, seizures, and/or 
cerebral oedema29,37,62,82,115. The earliest signs and symp­
toms of CRES can be subtle among children, and, thus, 
a paediatric skill set is required in order to determine the 
child’s baseline level of cognitive performance. Among 
adult patients, early presenting symptoms of CRES 
include inattention and impaired expression affecting 
language and handwriting37. Grading of CRES accord­
ing to CTCAE v5.0 (ref.99) or previously published CRES 
algorithms for adult patients29,37 is not optimal among 
infants and younger children. The Cornell Assessment 
of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD)116 is a validated screening 
tool (Supplementary Table 2) for recognition of delirium 
among children and adolescents (from birth to 21 years 
old); the sensitivity and specificity of this tool are highest 
in patients aged <12 years. Use of CAPD with appropri­
ate developmental anchor points117 enables developmen­
tally appropriate delirium screening by nurses and other 
members of the health­ 
care team at the bedside and is 
an important tool in the overall grading of CRES, as out­
lined in Table 3; a CAPD score >8 is indicative of delir­
ium116. Alternatively, neurological assessment scoring, as 
previously described with the CARTOX 10­point assess­
ment scale (CARTOX­10) grading system by Neelapu 
et al.37, can be used for patients aged ≥12 years who have 
cognitive abilities that are appropriate for these assess­
ments (Table 3). We recommend that delirium screening 
with CAPD or other neurological assessments be per­
formed at least twice per day among admitted patients 
and at least daily among outpatients during the high­ 
risk 
period for CRES (the 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion) 
(Table 1). The first neurological assessment from a nurs­
ing provider should occur at the end of their shift and 
be conducted concurrently with the incoming nurse. 
The severity of CRES can be labile; thus, assessments 
should be performed more frequently if a change from 
prior scores occurs and/or if a caregiver raises concerns. 
Indeed, the trend in CAPD scores within an individual 
patient is important; increasing scores can be used as a 
marker of CRES severity (Table 3).
The onset of CRES can be biphasic, occurring con­
currently with CRS and/or after CRS has resolved, 
and the precise pathophysiology remains unclear — 
although evidence implicates a combination of endothe­
lial activation in the CNS, elevated cytokine levels in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cerebral T cell infiltra­
tion118,119. The use of anti­ 
IL­6 therapy seems to be more 
effective for the management of CRES that occurs con­
currently with CRS. Patients who develop CRES can also 
benefit from early corticosteroid administration29,37,38 
(Table 3). CRES is generally reversible; however, cer­
ebral oedema and death have been reported37,64,120–122. 
No adequately powered randomized studies to identify 
patients who are at disproportionately higher risk of 
CRES have been reported to date. We recommend that 
recipients of CAR T cell therapy with CNS disease or a 
history of seizures receive anti­ 
seizure prophylaxis with 
levetiracetam (10 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 500 mg 
per dose) every 12 hours for 30 days following infusion 
(or through the CRES­ 
risk period as described during 
pivotal studies and with subsequent emerging data)9,27,37 
(box 1). Levetiracetam is generally well­ 
tolerated, with 
a minimal risk of adverse drug interactions, although 
dose adjustments might be necessary in the setting of 
renal dysfunction and are not thought to affect cytokine 
levels37,123,124. Neurology consultation should be consid­
ered if the patient develops grade 1 CRES (Table 3) and/
or for specialized screening for papilloedema. Patients 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms 
of cerebral oedema. Status epilepticus can be managed 
according to institutional guidelines (our recommended 
management approaches are provided in box 4). In 
general, first­ 
line anti­ 
seizure medications with unfa­
vourable cardiotoxicity profiles (such as lacosamide and 
phenytoin) should be avoided when possible. Increased 
intracranial pressure (CSF opening pressure ≥20 mmHg 
or clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure) will 
require intensive­ 
care management and osmotherapy 
(a management algorithm that can be tailored accord­
ing to institutional guidelines is proposed in box 5). 
A neurosurgery consultation should be considered, 
and brain scans can help guide patient management. 
Routine chemistry panels should be monitored more 
frequently (every 6–8 hours) and medications adjusted 
accordingly to prevent rebound cerebral oedema, renal 
failure, hypovolemia and/or hypotension, and electro­
lyte abnormalities. General grading and management 
guidelines for CRES are outlined in Table 3 (these can 
be tailored according to product­ 
specific approved 
label instructions and/or study protocols). CRES can 
 
occur as a later complication and, in some patients, 
after discharge from hospital; therefore, caregivers 
and/or the patient should be given appropriate antici­
patory guidance and appropriate education before 
being discharged from hospital. Moreover, patients 
should have a caregiver available who can observe for 
 
signs of CRES and seek prompt intervention for at least 
4 weeks (or through the CRES­ 
risk period) after CAR 
T cell infusion.

 Long- 
term follow- 
up assessment
Careful long­ 
term follow­ 
up assessment of patients 
receiving CAR T cell therapy is important. Management 
of on­ 
target, off­ 
tumour effects should be well coordi­
nated between treatment and referring centres if the 
patient returns to local providers following therapy.
For example, B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobuli­
naemia or agammaglobulinaemia are commonly seen 
in patients treated with anti­ 
CD19 CAR T cells. These 
adverse effects require long­ 
term replacement with 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs). We recom­
mend intervention to maintain serum immunoglobulin 
levels above 400 µg/l with IVIGs as well as consideration 
 
of IVIG administration to provide specific immunity 
during active infection, irrespective of immuno­
globulin levels63,125. B cell aplasia has been associated 
with  
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML)126,127; thus, patients should be closely monitored 
for neurological signs and symptoms that are suggestive 
of PML (neuropsychological deficits, progressive demen­
tia, apraxia, or visual and motor deficits)126 until the 
 
resolution of B cell aplasia.
Data from studies of the effectiveness and safety of 
immunization with inactive or live vaccines in patients 
treated with adoptive T cell therapies have not been 
reported to date. We recommend careful assessment 
of immune reconstitution after lymphodepletion 
and CAR T cell infusion; the findings should guide 
decisions regarding antimicrobial prophylaxis and 
re­ 
vaccination63,128.
Patients treated with CAR T cell therapy are at risk 
of disease relapse and/or the development of secondary 
neoplasms. In addition, the use of a replication­ 
competent 
viral vector during CAR manufacturing could pose a 
theoretical risk to patients and/or their close contacts129. 
Long­ 
term clinical monitoring is important for detec­
tion of these complications and is mandated by the FDA 
for all such gene therapies130,131.
Local and national registries to capture the out­
comes, acute complications, and late effects of CAR 
T cell therapies might enable the establishment of qual­
ity benchmarks, facilitate retrospective research, recog­
nize potential delayed toxicities, and ultimately improve 
future care. As the Center for International Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) develops 
a registry for patients receiving CAR T cell therapy, 
we recommend that consideration be given to the 
reporting of variables that are directly retrievable from 
electronic medical records to ensure accuracy and min­
imize the infrastructural burden required for compre­
hensive reporting. Given that toxicity grading systems 
are likely to evolve over time, entry of primary varia­
bles seems more useful in the long term. Furthermore, 
many of these patients require intensive­ 
care support, 
and therefore prospective collaborations with intensive­ 
care registries, such as Virtual paediatric intensive­ 
care 
unit (PICU) Systems (VPS)132, should be considered 
(Table 1). This approach could enable accurate data 
entry of cell­ 
therapy variables into the CIBMTR regis­
try by cell­ 
therapy programmes, with concurrent entry 
of data on intensive­ 
care variables into an appropriate 
registry by paediatric critical care teams.
CAR T cell therapy as a bridge to HSCT
In ELIANA8, the largest study of CAR T cell therapy 
involving paediatric patients performed to date, 83% of 
the infused patients (n = 63) achieved minimal resid­
ual disease (MRD)­negative complete remission (CR) 
or CR with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi). 
After a median follow­ 
up duration of 4.8 months from 
response, the median CR and/or CRi duration was 
not reached (range 1.2 months to >14.1 months). The 
results of prediction­ 
based modelling suggest that more 
than half of the patients who received tisagenlecleucel 
on the ELIANA trial will be alive at 5 years after treat­
ment133. The actual allogeneic HSCT (allo­ 
HSCT) rate 
among those who achieved a CR or CRi was 12% in the 
ELIANA trial8.
In another paediatric study46, CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells transfected with an anti­ 
CD19 CAR construct 
containing a 4­1BB co­ 
stimulatory domain using a 
lentiviral vector were administered to 45 children and 
young adults with pre­ 
B cell ALL; 93% of the patients 
achieved MRD­ 
negative remission by day 21. However, 
the estimated 12­month event­ 
free survival was 50.8%, 
with the majority of these patients unfortunately expe­
riencing disease relapse46. The persistence of functional 
anti­ 
CD19 CAR T cells was assessed by measuring 
the duration of B cell aplasia using flow cytometry; 
the median duration of B cell aplasia was 3 months 
(95% CI 2.07–6.44)46. In this study46, 11 of 40 (28%) 
patients who were in CR underwent allo­ 
HSCT, and 2 of 
 
these 11 patients subsequently experienced CD19+  
leukaemia relapse.

Fig. 1 | Proposed algorithm for the diagnosis and management of CAR T cell- 
related 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and/or macrophage- 
activation syndrome. 
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell- 
related haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
(HLH) and macrophage- 
activation syndrome (MAS) are serious, life- 
threatening 
complications of CAR T cell therapy and should be suspected when a patient has a serum 
ferritin level >10,000 ng/ml in association with grade ≥3 organ toxicities (liver, kidney 
, or 
lung) per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0)99 and/or 
evidence of haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow or other organs. Patients should be 
managed as recommended for grade 3 cytokine- 
release syndrome (CRS) with close 
monitoring of inflammatory markers and organ function. If no clinical and laboratory 
improvement is observed after 48–72 hours, consider HLH management according to the 
HLH-2004 protocol113.

 In an open­ 
label, phase I, dose­ 
escalation study 
of anti­ 
CD19 CAR T cells (containing a CD28 co­ 
stimulatory domain and manufactured using a retroviral 
vector) involving children and young adults with ALL 
or non­ 
Hodgkin lymphoma performed by the US NIH, 
the CR rate was 66.7%. Following remission, 10 of 12 
(83%) patients who achieved MRD­ 
negative remission 
underwent HSCT and remained disease­ 
free at the time 
of publication of the data22.
At this time, whether CAR T cell therapy is a defin­
itive treatment remains unclear. While strategies to 
understand antigen­ 
escape mechanisms and to increase 
rates of long­ 
term remission are developed134, allo­ 
HSCT can reasonably be considered for patients with

Early recognition of and intervention for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-

threatening 
complications. CRES should be suspected if any of the above listed signs and symptoms are present within the first 4 weeks of CAR T cell therapy. CRES grading

 haematological malignancies who have achieved remis­
sion following CAR T cell therapy. Alternatively, as CAR 
T cell product­ 
specific data matures, it might also be 
reasonable to consider CAR T cell therapy as a defini­
tive treatment. The decision to proceed with allo­ 
HSCT 
should be based upon the candidate meeting standard 
eligibility requirements, and the long­ 
term outcomes 
associated with the specific CAR T cell product used 
should be considered in the risk–benefit assessment.
Ethical considerations
Currently, CAR T cell therapy for paediatric patients is 
available for only those with high­ 
grade, relapsed and/
or refractory ALL. Remission rates among children with 
relapsed and/or refractory ALL, who previously had no 
curative options, have been impressive with current 
CAR T cell therapies97. Nevertheless, not all children 
with relapsed and/or refractory ALL are appropriate 
candidates for this therapy. Patients who do not have a 
reasonable expectation of survival between leukapher­
esis and CAR T cell administration or whose survival 
after CAR T cell therapy is expected to be limited by 
other comorbidities should not be considered as candi­
dates for this treatment. Among these groups, the risks 
of primary disease progression must be weighed against 
the risk of accelerating mortality and/or causing severe 
disability that could potentially be associated with CAR 
T cell therapy135.
Financial and health- 
system considerations
We understand that value in health care is determined 
by patient outcomes balanced against costs. The current 
estimated cost of standard of care CAR T cell therapy for 
children with ALL is high136,137. Moreover, the ancillary 
administrative and supportive care service (including 
management of complications, intensive­ 
care unit stays, 
and frequent hospitalization) costs can be substantially 
higher than the CAR T cell product price tag138. We 
strongly encourage consideration of the quality­ 
adjusted 
life years gained for paediatric patients who can poten­
tially achieve long­ 
term remission as a result of this 
therapy and encourage all efforts to reduce the costs of 
care137,139,140 (Table 1). We anticipate that advances in CAR 
T cell technology will improve our understanding of the 
pathophysiology of CRS–CRES and facilitate the dis­
covery of predictive biomarkers with which to identify 
patients requiring early intervention with available sup­
portive care, which will subsequently lead to improved 
outcomes and reductions in the cost of this care, in addi­
tion to biomarkers for identifying in advance patients 
who are unlikely to respond. As payers and health sys­
tems determine coverage benefits, it is important that 
the specific needs of all children be considered and that 
access is granted to CAR T cell therapy and the asso­
ciated supportive care (encompassing baseline assess­
ments, inpatient observation, and essential supportive 
care when necessary).
Health institutions are encouraged to provide access 
to CAR T cell therapies; however, adequate strategic 
and operational planning and preparation are needed 
to ensure the safe delivery of such treatments. We rec­
ommend that programmes seek immune effector cell 
(IEC) accreditation by the FACT as a voluntary means 
of ensuring adherence to quality standards55 (Table 1). 
FACT accreditation will require an established quality­ 
assurance programme at the institution, as well as edu­
cation and ongoing training for clinical staff. Institutions 
that offer CAR T cell therapy should support rigorous 
quality assurance, data management, clinical services, 
and education programmes for interdisciplinary staff 
involved in the care of patients who receive this treat­
ment. Additionally, emergency medical services, com­
munity hospitals, and local triage facilities will require 
high vigilance to recognize and promptly escalate care in 
the event that a patient treated with CAR T cell therapy 
presents to their facility in an emergency.
Nursing considerations
The availability of skilled interdisciplinary staff, includ­
ing nurses, is an essential requirement for safe admin­
istration of CAR T cell therapy to paediatric patients. 
Owing to the need for close medical attention among 
these patients, communication between coordinators, 
medical care providers, and nursing administration 
is important to ensuring that CAR T cell infusions 
are considered together with staffing decisions141,142.

• If seizures persist, transfer patient to paediatric intensive-

as follows:
 
- lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg (maximum 1 mg) i.v. every 8 hours for 3 doses
 
- levetiracetam 15 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg) i.v. every 12 hours
 
- Phenobarbital 1–3 mg/kg i.v. every 12 hours

ConSenSuS Statement
 all need available nursing staff that have completed 
all required competencies to care for patients treated 
with CAR T cells. These nurses can assist in the rapid 
recognition of CRS–CRES and help avoid iatrogenic 
errors (for example, administration of steroids as a 
routine pre­ 
medication). Visual cues, such as flags in 
the patient chart or patient bracelets (similar to ‘fall 
risk’ identifiers), can help care teams to quickly recog­
nize recipients of CAR T cells, even during electronic 
medical record ‘downtime procedures’
. Discharge pro­
tocols should ensure comprehensive education of the 
caregiver and patient about signs and symptoms of 
 
CRS and CRES, and the patient should also be given 
a wallet or REMS identification card for their spe­
cific CAR T cell product. Most importantly, recipients 
 
of CAR T cells should be instructed to immediately 
alert all providers that they have received this therapy, 
especially if presenting to a facility outside of their 
 
original treatment centre.
Pharmacy considerations
As CAR T cell therapies transition from experimental 
therapies to standard­ 
of­care treatments, institutional 
pharmacists must be engaged in the development 
of policies and protocols to optimize supportive 
care. Additionally, REMS programmes are likely to 
accompany new therapy approvals by the FDA. For 
instance, the REMS programme for tisagenlecleucel 
requires institutions to have a minimum of two doses 
of tocilizumab available on site for each patient at risk 
of CRS–CRES in order to enable immediate admin­
istration143. New CAR T cell therapies might also 
require an adequate stock of other agents directed at 
ameliorating CRS and/or CRES and other supportive 
therapies (such as rituximab and cetuximab for the 
aforementioned products with integrated suicide or 
safety switches)49,56,61. Institutional pharmacies will 
need to ensure adequate training of pharmacy staff 
regarding the recognition and management of CRS and 
CRES and the development of policies and protocols to 
ensure adequate stock and the prompt dispensation of 
supportive therapies55.
Emergency contingency planning
Institutions involved in the administration of CAR T cell 
therapies are encouraged to develop programme­ 
specific 
emergency plans that take into account the particular 
needs of patients exposed to these treatments144. Many 
patients will be required to live within a specified dis­
tance of the treating hospital for a predefined amount 
of time after CAR T cell infusion. Should acute toxici­
ties develop, this stipulation will ensure prompt access 
to care, which will help to mitigate against additional 
complications. When possible, institutions should 
develop protocols to overcome barriers to care for these 
patients in the event of natural disasters and/or disrup­
tion of services. Prespecified electronic medical record 
downtime procedures, evacuation plans that include 
access to anti­ 
IL­6 therapies, and the consideration of 
admission of outpatients at risk of CRS–CRES before 
an anticipated natural disaster are examples of disaster 
planning protocols145,146.
Conclusions
To achieve improvements in CAR T cell therapy and 
the requisite supportive care, and thereby sustain CR 
rates among children, we recommend that enrolment 
of children in trials of novel agents be facilitated at the 
earliest acceptable time points. In this regard, application 
of CAR T cell therapies for treatment of solid tumours 
and other haematological malignancies in children 
is being explored (NCT03126864, NCT01953900, 
NCT02311621, and NCT03056339). Moreover, consid­
eration of earlier or upfront use of CAR T cell therapy 
might spare patients the acute and long­ 
term toxicities 
associated with traditional chemotherapy and/or radi­
ation regimens. Whether CAR T cell therapy should 
be followed by allo­ 
HSCT or repeat CAR T cell infu­
sions also needs to be explored. Future studies aimed at 
improving the persistence of CAR T cells and thereby 
inducing long­ 
term remission without the need for 
further therapy are an important requirement. An over­
arching commitment to improve patient outcomes, 
especially among children with limited or no therapeutic 
options, is key.
Currently, the time required from leukapheresis to 
manufacture CAR­ 
expressing cells is a major limitation 
of CAR T cell therapy. Efforts to explore third­ 
party, 
off­ 
the­shelf allogeneic approaches to therapy with CAR 
T cells or other immune effectors, such as CAR NK cells, 
are exciting potential alternatives60.
Box 5 | Proposed management algorithms for increased intracranial pressure
Algorithm A: stage 1–2 papilloedema with CSF opening pressure <20 mmHg 
and without evidence of cerebral oedema
Acetazolamide 15 mg/kg (maximum 1,000 mg) intravenous (i.v.) followed by  
8–12 mg/kg (maximum 1,000 mg) i.v. every 12 hours; monitor renal function and  
acid–base balance once or twice daily and adjust dose accordingly
Algorithm B: management of stage 3–5 papilloedema, any evidence of 
cerebral oedema on imaging studies, or CSF opening pressure ≥20 mmHg
use high- 
dose corticosteroids according to recommendations for grade 4 chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell- 
related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES; see Table 3) 
along with the following measures for the management of cerebral oedema:
• elevate head of bed to an angle of 30 degrees
• Hyperventilation to achieve target PaCo2 of 30–40 mmHg during the acute 
management of intracranial hypertension (or acute management of intracranial 
hypertension according to accepted institutional guidelines)
• Hyperosmolar therapy with either 20% mannitol or hypertonic saline (3%)
 
- mannitol: initial dose of 0.5–1 g/kg; maintenance dose 0.25–1 g/kg every 6 hours 
(check metabolic profile and serum osmolality every 6 hours, and hold mannitol if 
serum osmolality is ≥320 mosm/kg or osmolality gap is ≥40)
 
- Hypertonic 3% saline: initial dose 5 ml/kg i.v. over 15 mins; maintenance dose  
1 ml/kg per hour i.v. to reach a target serum sodium level of 150–155 meq/l (check 
electrolytes every 4 hours, and hold infusion if sodium level is >155 meq/l)
• If patient has an ommaya reservoir, drain CSF to a target opening pressure of  
<20 mmHg
• Consider neurosurgery consultation and i.v. anaesthetics for burst- 
suppression 
pattern on electroencephalography
• Perform metabolic profiling every 6 hours, daily CT of the head, and adjust above 
medications to prevent rebound cerebral oedema, renal failure, electrolyte 
abnormalities, hypovolemia, and hypotension

ConSenSuS Statement
 Additional long­ 
term prospective studies to under­
stand the pathophysiology and develop early recog­
nition and optimal treatment strategies for CRS and/
or CRES are needed. Such studies should involve 
broad collaborative efforts because these toxicities 
are multifaceted and necessitate interdisciplinary 
care. Response and adverse event rates, as well as late 
effects, are likely to vary depending on various host, 
disease, and CAR T cell characteristics; therefore, a 
comprehensive and robust registry is needed to guide 
future efforts to optimize and expand the use of CAR 
T cell therapy.
