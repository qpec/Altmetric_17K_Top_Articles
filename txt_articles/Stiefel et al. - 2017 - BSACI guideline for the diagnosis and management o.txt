Summary
Peanut nut and tree nut allergy are characterised by IgE mediated reactions to nut pro-
teins. Nut allergy is a global disease. Limited epidemiological data suggest varying preva-
lence in different geographical areas. Primary nut allergy affects over 2% of children and
0.5% of adults in the UK. Infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy have a higher
risk of peanut allergy. Primary nut allergy presents most commonly in the first five years
of life, often after the first known ingestion with typical rapid onset IgE-mediated symp-
toms. The clinical diagnosis of primary nut allergy can be made by the combination of a
typical clinical presentation and evidence of nut specifc IgE shown by a positive skin
prick test (SPT) or specific IgE (sIgE) test. Pollen food syndrome is a distinct disorder, usu-
ally mild, with oral/pharyngeal symptoms, in the context of hay fever or pollen sensitisa-
tion, which can be triggered by nuts. It can usually be distinguish clinically from primary
nut allergy. The magnitude of a SPT or sIgE relates to the probability of clinical allergy,
but does not relate to clinical severity. SPT of ≥ 8 mm or sIgE ≥ 15 KU/L to peanut is
highly predictive of clinical allergy. Cut off values are not available for tree nuts. Test
results must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. Diagnostic food chal-
lenges are usually not necessary but may be used to confirm or refute a conflicting his-
tory and test result. As nut allergy is likely to be a long-lived disease, nut avoidance
advice is the cornerstone of management. Patients should be provided with a comprehen-
sive management plan including avoidance advice, patient specific emergency medication
and an emergency treatment plan and training in administration of emergency medica-
tion. Regular re-training is required.

Introduction
Nut allergy is common and affects approximately 2%
of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK. Resolution of
peanut allergy is sometimes seen in young children.
Clinical experience suggests that peanut allergy in teen-
agers and adults and tree nut allergy rarely resolve. The
quality of life of the affected patients and their families
is decreased because of the need for constant vigilance
over food choices and the perceived likelihood of ana-
phylaxis, alongside the dietary and social restrictions
that accompany food allergy [1, 2]. Current best man-
agement is directed at educating patients, families and
caregivers on food allergen avoidance and how to treat
food allergy emergencies [3].
Evidence for the recommendations was collected by
electronic literature searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE

Definition
Nut allergy is characterised by a type I IgE-mediated
reaction induced by nut proteins. There are two types
of IgE-mediated nut allergy: primary nut allergy and
pollen food syndrome (often referred to as oral allergy
syndrome) associated with nuts (see Box 1).
Non-IgE-mediated immunological reactions to nuts
will not be discussed in this guideline [4, 5].
Background and epidemiology
Peanut and tree nut allergy were uncommon until the
early 1990s following which there was a substantial rise
in prevalence [6–10]. In the UK, peanut allergy affects
between 0.5% and 2.5% of children [6, 9, 11, 12].
Although these variations could be ascribed to differ-
ences in populations examined, study design, age of
children and time periods assessed (Table 1). There is
evidence of increasing prevalence of peanut allergy in
UK
children.
A
meta-analysis
of
European
studies
showed peanut allergy prevalence varied from 0.5% to
2.5%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used [13]. In
Australia, 3% of unselected 12-month-old infants had
challenge-proven PA [14].
In adults in the UK, the self-reported prevalence of
peanut allergy was 0.53% for 15- to 44-year-olds and
0.3% > 45-year-old. Studies outside the UK suggest a
peanut allergy prevalence from 0.4% to 0.7%, although
there are significant variations in diagnostic criteria
[20]. As peanut allergy has affected 1–2% of children
for over a decade, the prevalence in young adults is
likely to exceed 1%.
Box 1. Phenotypes
Primary nut allergy: is characterized by systemic and often severe
reactions to nuts in patients with specific IgE against the major
storage proteins e.g. Ara h2 for peanut.
Pollen food syndrome (PFS), also known as oral allergy syndrome
is characterized by seasonal allergic rhinitis and a history of reac-
tions to fresh fruit, vegetables or nuts. Symptoms are typically
mild and isolated to the oropharynx. Anaphylaxis can occur but
is uncommon. Serum specific IgE is directed against heat-labile
proteins (PR-10 homologues) homologous to those in pollen.

 The prevalence of allergy to at least one tree nut in
UK children is based on data from the Isle of Wight.
The prevalence reported has varied from 0.2% to 2.2%
(see Table 1). Individual tree nut allergy prevalence var-
ies from 0.12% for walnut to 0.48% for Brazil nut [21].
The population prevalence of tree nut allergy was esti-
mated by telephone survey in the United States at
0.2%, 0.5% and 1.1% in 1997, 2002 and 2008, respec-
tively [22]. In adults, primary tree nut allergy ranged
from 0% to 0.7%, whereas an estimated prevalence of
pollen food syndrome (PFS) to hazelnut has been
reported as high as 4.6% in an unselected population
[20, 23, 24].
A systematic review and meta-analysis of fatal food
anaphylaxis estimated an incidence of fatal peanut ana-
phylaxis was 0.73–4.25 per million person years [25].
Over a 20-year period from 1992 to 2012, there were
69 fatalities attributed to peanut and tree nuts in the
UK [26].
Risk factors for development of nut allergy
Most children with primary nut allergy present with a
clinical reaction on first known ingestion of nuts [27,
28]. This contrasts with PFS, where patients have often
previously consumed the nut without symptoms prior
to developing their PFS symptoms.
Eczema is a significant risk factor for primary nut
allergy. Peanut allergy may develop through transcuta-
neous sensitization in children with an impaired skin
barrier function such as eczema (dual-allergen hypoth-
esis) [29]. Filaggrin (FLG) plays a role in skin barrier

 formation and eczema. FLG mutation carriers are at
increased risk of peanut allergy [30, 31]. Early-life
environmental peanut exposure is associated with an
increased risk of peanut sensitization and allergy in
children who carry an FLG mutation [32]. In addition,
use of eczema creams containing peanut oil is an
independent risk factor for the development of peanut
allergy [33]. High levels of household peanut con-
sumption by family members in the households of
infants with eczema are also a risk factor presumably
due to skin exposure [34]. Recent data demonstrate
with increasingly severe eczema, and earlier onset of
eczema, the risk of peanut sensitization increases as
well as the risk of peanut allergy [35–38]. Lastly egg
allergy is a significant risk factor for peanut allergy
[36].
Risk factors for the development of tree nut allergy
have not been as extensively investigated as for peanut
allergy. However, it is clear that peanut allergy and tree
nut allergy often coexist [39, 40] and data suggest one
specific
tree
nut
allergy
commonly
coexists
with
another tree nut allergy.
Risk factors for severe reactions
A previous severe reaction in a patient is a risk factor
for future severe reactions [41–43]. Most patients with
mild reactions do not go on to have severe reactions.
Severity appears to relate to the amount of nut ingested
[44]. Hospital-based challenges are not helpful in pre-
dicting severity of accidental reactions [45–47].
Allergy testing (skin prick test, or serum-specific IgE)
does not predict clinical severity, although if a patient
is found to be sensitized only to PR-10 homologues
and has a clinical history of oral allergy symptoms
from a significant nut exposure (for instance hazelnut
or peanut), the risk of a future severe reaction is low
(as this would suggest a diagnosis of PFS) (see Diagno-
sis section). The basophil activation test has been shown
in research studies to predict severity and threshold
reactivity in peanut-allergic children [48].
A clinical history of asthma in food allergy increases
the risk of a severe allergic reaction, [49, 50] and a
recent UK study demonstrated that 78% of those with
fatal anaphylaxis to food had asthma. Increased sever-
ity of asthma can increase the risk of anaphylaxis [51],
and the risk of fatal food anaphylaxis is higher in
patients with asthma [25, 26, 52].
The majority of severe non-fatal and fatal accidental
reactions occur in teenagers and young adults [53, 54].
Several factors are thought to be involved. These
include risk-taking behaviour such as failure to avoid
trigger(s), failure to carry an adrenaline autoinjector
(AAI) and use of alcohol [55].
Diagnosis
History/clinical presentation
The clinical history is the cornerstone of a diagnosis of
nut allergy (Box 1). A detailed allergy history should be
taken before testing is considered [56]. A history of nut
allergy reactions is often typical; patients usually sus-
pect the diagnosis following an allergic reaction. A
convincing history of an immediate reaction to peanuts
on two separate occasions has an 80% probability for
predicting primary nut allergy [57]. A clinical history
alone, however, is insufficient to make a diagnosis of
nut allergy.
Nut allergy presents with rapid onset of IgE-mediated
symptoms, within minutes of ingestion. The nature of
the symptoms is often related to the site and amount of
exposure, with ingestion of large quantities generally
being responsible for more severe reactions. It is rare
for a severe reaction to occur following only cutaneous
exposure [58]. Following ingestion, immediate local
mucosal symptoms of oral itching and swelling of the
lips are common.
Young children may not be able to describe this
experience and will often spit the food out and become
distressed. Alternatively, the nut protein may be masked
within the food carrier, and it may not cause any upper
GI tract symptoms [59]. If sufficient allergen has been
ingested, then after a short period of time, other organ
systems
may
become
involved.
Peanut
allergen
is
absorbed rapidly across the oral mucosal, or more grad-
ually through the gut causing colicky central abdominal
pain, which is often accompanied by profuse vomiting.
Generalized urticaria and angioedema commonly occur,
often accompanied by rhinoconjunctivitis. Symptoms of
a more severe reaction include a sensation of throat
tightening, wheezing and breathlessness. Collapse due
to hypotension is a rare presentation and is usually due
to hypoxia secondary to respiratory failure. Nut allergy
is the commonest cause of anaphylactic death in ado-
lescents and young adults [26]. Young children may
not be able to describe the symptoms of upper airway
narrowing, but suggestive features are a change in the
pitch of their voice, hoarseness or a loss of the voice,
stridor, excessive drooling of saliva and breathlessness.
Symptoms usually resolve quickly with treatment, and
it is unusual therefore to still have symptoms the fol-
lowing day.
Tree nuts such as brazil and cashew nut cause symp-
toms of airway narrowing more often that peanut, and
cashew nut in particular has been associated with more
severe reactions and
more frequent use of adrenaline
injections to treat reactions [60]. The allergic reactions
to nuts may be more severe in adults than children [61].

722 G. Stiefel et al.
 Primary nut allergy and PFS can usually be differen-
tiated by clinical history; however, they can coexist
(see Box 1). Care should be taken not to misinterpret
primary nut allergy causing only oral symptoms as
PFS.
Allergy tests
Before considering any allergy test, it is necessary to
consider the clinical context (history) to determine the
pre-test probability of nut allergy (see Figs 1 and 2).
Positive specific IgE (sIgE) or SPTs by itself (a state of
sensitisation) do not make a diagnosis [36, 62]. A sug-
gested approach to diagnosis of peanut and tree nut
allergy is illustrated in Figs 1 and 2.
Skin prick test. SPTs are performed with standardized
nut extracts and in some cases supported by prick-to-
prick testing with individual nuts. A recent typical clin-
ical history of peanut or tree nut allergy with SPT weal
size of at least 3 mm is sufficient to make a clinical
diagnosis of allergy (see Figs 1 and 2). However, using
a SPT ≥ 3 mm cut-off alone for peanut in a paediatric
population without the appropriate clinical context has
a poor predictive value and should not be used [63, 64].
However, a cut-off with a SPT diameter < 3 mm per-
forms well for excluding allergy. The exception is in
the context of a typical clinical history of nut allergy
with a SPT < 3 mm, where further investigations will
usually be required (Figs 1 and 2).
SPT weal diameter cut-off values for diagnosis of
peanut allergy have been proposed. Larger SPT weals
have
been proposed
to improve SPT performance.
Table 2 shows the sensitivity, specificity, LRs and posi-
tive predictive values (PPV) for peanut SPT values. A
SPT ≥ 8 mm has a low sensitivity and high specificity
and in the majority of studies provides a PPV >95%
(Table 2) [63, 65].
There are fewer studies assessing the diagnostic val-
ues of SPT weal size in tree nut allergy. In one study, a

 SPT ≥ 8 mm for cashew, hazelnut and walnut had a
PPV >95% [70]. In contrast, a further study with hazel-
nut showed a SPT ≥ 8 mm and ≥ 17 mm with a PPV of
74% and 100%, respectively [75]. However, it is gener-
ally accepted that a cut-off SPT ≥ 8 mm for a specific
tree nut is highly suggestive of clinical allergy [76].
Skin testing is safe, and systemic reactions are extre-
mely rare. The skin prick test weal size does not corre-
late with clinical severity.
Serum-specific total nut IgE. Nut serum sIgE testing is
more widely available than SPTs in primary and sec-
ondary care. A sIgE ≥ 0.35kU/l is usually considered to
represent a positive result, although this cut-off is arbi-
trary.
Using
peanut
sIgE
as
an
example,
a
sIgE
≥ 0.35 KU/L has a high sensitivity and low specificity
and PPV (see Table 3) and is therefore not a reliable
test to diagnose allergy in isolation.
However, a peanut sIgE ≥ 15 KU/L is highly specific
with a PPV in excess of 90% and thus on its own without
a history of tolerating peanut would be highly suggestive
of peanut allergy. This cut-off has a low sensitivity and
therefore lower sIgE values must be interpreted with the
clinical history to make a correct diagnosis. For all nuts,
one study comparing specific IgE with history found 40%
of positive tests were misleading (patients were tolerant)
and 22% of negative tests were falsely reassuring.
In children, hazelnut sIgE ≥ 15 KU/L has a PPV of
57% and therefore if interpreted in isolation without
the clinical history is not a good diagnostic test, but a
sIgE < 0.35 KU/L has a NPV of 95% and therefore can
effectively exclude hazelnut allergy [75]. A hazelnut
sIgE ≥ 0.7 KU/L provides a PPV of 92%, but a poor
sensitivity and specificity [86]. The data on hazelnut-
specific IgE reflect variations in populations studied but
also variations amongst different age groups studied
and it is difficult to use specific cut-offs to diagnose
hazelnut allergy.

Peanut and tree nut allergy guideline 725
 cut-off are likely to represent walnut allergy. Unfortu-
nately, the sensitivity is low (17%). Diagnosing walnut
allergy based on sIgE alone is unreliable [40]. Data on
other tree nuts’ sIgE cut-offs are limited although it has
been suggested that a cut-off ≥ 15 KU/L for individual
tree nuts is likely to represent clinical allergy [76]. Mea-
surements of serum IgE reactivity against individual
recombinant or native protein components can be
made, which represent the major allergenic proteins of
each nut (see Table 4).
Component specific IgE testing. Most data on slgE com-
ponents relates to ImmunoCAP, although the various
methods used are not comparable. Ara h 2 is the major
peanut allergen, and sIgE directed against this shows
better discrimination than total peanut IgE [62, 83, 88].
Several studies have established cut-off values for the
peanut component Ara h 2 (see Table 5). The reported
predictive value of Ara h 2 varies amongst different
populations. Measurement of Ara h 1, 3 and 6 appears
less useful [84, 89–93]. However, if peanut slgE is posi-
tive and slgE Ara h 2 is negative, then other peanut
components can be useful in combination with the clin-
ical context.
There are few data comparing performance of peanut
SPT to slgE peanut components. One study demon-
strated that the performance of both sIgE Ara h 2 and
SPT was similar in correctly identifying young children
with peanut allergy and peanut sensitization [83].
Similarly, sensitization to the hazelnut component Cor
a 9 and Cor a 14 are more specific for primary hazelnut
allergy compared to hazelnut sIgE [88, 96–99] as with
Ara h 2, there is variation amongst different populations
in the predictive values of a specific IgE level.
An isolated sIgE to PR-10 Bet v 1 (birch pollen) sug-
gests the possibility of PFS rather than primary nut
allergy. Isolated sIgE to Cor a 1 or Ara h 8 is often
associated with clinical tolerance or mild, subjective
oral symptoms [96, 100]. Sensitization to PR-10 nut
components in addition to seed storage components
(e.g. Ara h 1,2,3 & 6 or Cor a 9 & 14) requires further
evaluation of the history as this suggests the a diagno-
sis of primary nut allergy.
Less commonly in the UK, clinical reactions to nuts
may reflect sensitization to non-specific lipid transfer
proteins (nsLTP, e.g. Ara h 9, Cor a 8) [101]. This pat-
tern of sensitization has been associated with both mild
and severe systemic reactions. Serum sIgE to cashew
components in children performs better than cashew-
specific IgE or SPT [93] and Ana o 3 appears the best
predictor of cashew nut allergy [102, 103].
Jug r 1 is a clinically important major walnut com-
ponent associated with systemic allergic reactions to
walnut [104]. The roles of slgE to walnut and Brazil nut
components are not yet established [98, 105, 106].

Many studies have suggested specific cut-offs demonstrating the 95% positive predictive value (95% PPV) and 95% negative predictive values (95% NPV) of SPT or sIgE tests. However, these
figures are population dependent and not transferrable to other populations seen routinely in one’s individual clinic. However, these figures are often quoted in the literature and utilized. Like-
lihood ratios (LR) on the other hand are not meant to be population dependent, so LRs are transferrable to most populations. Utilizing LRs suggest that a LR ≥ 10 is strongly suggestive of nut
allergy, and a LR ≤ 0.1 is strongly suggestive of no allergy. As a general rule, the higher the SPT or sIgE, the more likely it is to be allergy. However, even with the above information these test
results cannot be taken in isolation of the clinical context.

 Specific IgE or SPT to non-index nuts. Children with
one nut allergy have a significantly increased risk of
allergy to other nuts and often do not have any history
of ingestion or have not consumed the nut for a con-
siderable length of time. Performing SPT or sIgE to the
other nuts in this situation may be helpful. If the weal
diameter is large (equal to and >8 mm) or sIgE is high,
then allergy is likely. Similarly if the SPT is negative or
sIgE < 0.35 KU/L, then clinical allergy to those nuts is
unlikely [107, 108]. Skin prick test weals 3–7 mm are
indeterminant as patients could be tolerant or allergic
[109]. A food challenge may be required to make a
definitive diagnosis depending on the management plan
agreed between the clinician and patient. Testing for
IgE to nuts which are tolerated in the diet should be
avoided.
Diagnostic peanut/tree nut challenge. Oral food chal-
lenges to nuts may be required occasionally in clinical
practice to make a definitive diagnosis (see Figs 1 and
2). Challenges need to be performed in an appropriate
setting with access to resuscitation equipment [110].
Such challenges should be performed by competent and
trained staff with experience in food allergy and the
skills to manage acute allergic reactions (including ana-
phylaxis). There also needs to be appropriate gover-
nance for food challenges such as clear guidelines on
whom to challenge and protocols in place for undertak-
ing challenge tests. An example of a challenge proto-
cols for peanut is found in Appendix 1.
Quality of life/burden
There is evidence that food allergy is associated with
increased
stress
and
anxiety
in
children
and
an
impaired quality of life (QoL), even compared to other
chronic conditions such as diabetes [1, 112, 113]. This
is related to constant fear of a severe/fatal allergic reac-
tion when eating, the burden of constant vigilance
when making food choices and the resulting social
restrictions.
The impact of peanut allergy is not exclusive to the
child but also impacts on other members of the family
[112, 114]. Therefore, psychological impact and QoL of
children with nut allergy should be considered.
Management
A comprehensive management plan is essential and
should include advice on avoidance of nuts, individual
nut recognition, treatment of allergic reactions and pro-
vision of, and training in the use of emergency medica-
tions including adrenaline self-injectors. Detection and
management
of
allergic
comorbidities,
particularly
active management of asthma, are especially important,
because of the association between poor asthma control
and severe allergic reactions.
Additionally, in nut-allergic children the manage-
ment plan needs to be delivered to the wider family
(e.g. grandparents if appropriate, nursery, preschool and
school). It is also essential to include and establish links
with healthcare professionals who provide education of
staff in schools and early years settings. Reactions to
accidental exposures are frequent, but with good man-
agement, further reactions can be reduced in both fre-
quency and severity.
Dietary management
All patients and their families/carers require clear infor-
mation on nut avoidance. Dietitians can play a key role in
educating patients and families on how to avoid nuts and

 how to give advice on an individual basis. This should

Food labelling
Two
main
types
of
labelling
exist
on
pre-packed
food: the first is the ingredients list. Legislation (Con-
sumers Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011) requires the
following specific nut terms to be highlighted in the
ingredients list: peanuts, almond, hazelnut, walnut,
cashew
nut,
pistachio
nut,
Brazil
nut,
pecan
nut,
macadamia nut or Queensland nut [115]; the second
is the ‘may contain’ or ‘not suitable for’ statements
referred to as precautionary allergen labelling (PAL).
This type of caution is voluntary and may or may
not refer to a specific nut type [116] and is not
required to be highlighted.
Patients should be advised to read both the ingredi-
ents list and the PAL on any food product they intend
to consume even if it has been consumed before as
recipes can change. Patients should be made aware that
foods imported from outside the EU may lack allergy
labelling.
Precautionary allergen labelling
Food
manufacturers
should
make
a
thorough
risk
assessment, adhere to good manufacturing practice and
provide information about the risk of nut contamina-
tion; but this often results in the use of PALs. No con-
sistent terminology for PAL exists, and patients often
find them difficult to interpret. Foods with and without
PAL both carry a low risk of nut contamination. How-
ever, some foods with PAL such as snack foods are
likely to pose a higher risk. Advice should be individu-
alized; those with a history of very severe past reac-
tions, uncontrolled asthma or a very low threshold for
reactivity may benefit from more strict avoidance of
PAL food. Patients with clinically diagnosed PFS do not
need to avoid foods with PAL.
Eating out
Legislation requires restaurants, and cafes to provide
clear information about nuts in non-packaged foods.
When eating out and food is prepared by a third party,
it is important to consider potential risks. In restaurants,
patients should liaise directly with staff to ensure they
can provide a nut-free meal. In the United States and
the UK, allergic reactions to nuts have occurred with
food bought from Asian restaurants, ice cream shops
and bakeries [117]. The UK Food Standards Agency
provides resources for food businesses including techni-
cal guidance, online training tools and materials for
businesses and consumers [118].
Single vs. all nut exclusion
Many healthcare providers advise patients with peanut
allergy to also avoid tree nuts [3, 119, 120].
This recommendation aims to simplify the message
and improve avoidance while eating in schools and
restaurants. It also addresses the issues of cross-con-
tamination, substitution and misidentification of nuts.
There is an increased incidence of tree nut allergy in
patients with peanut allergy. A comprehensive manage-
ment plan, including advice to avoid all nuts, reduces
the annual risk of an accidental reaction after exposure
to peanut to 3% [3]. Other studies have shown an
annual prevalence of accidental reaction to be 14–45%
although these studies have not explicitly reported on
the dietary advice provided [50, 121, 122]. Similarly in
patients with tree nut allergy, it is recommended that
they avoid other tree nuts and peanuts, unless they are
known to be tolerant or have negative tests.
Clearly, complete nut avoidance including avoiding
all pre-packed and non-packed snack foods as well as
products with PAL is the safest approach and, if fol-
lowed, results in very few accidental reactions. How-
ever, in practice this is difficult to achieve and can
result in a significant restriction of certain food prod-
ucts. There are also nutritional, cultural and immuno-
logical arguments for allowing consumption of other
nuts [123]. If a patient is already consuming a nut they
are not allergic to, it would appear reasonable to con-
tinue consuming it on a regular basis, but to be aware
of the risks of cross-contamination and PAL. Safe nuts
should still be avoided within a restaurant environment,
due to the risk of misidentification of nuts or inadver-
tent substitution of other nut types.
Whichever dietary approach is undertaken, it is essen-
tial to have an individualized plan for each patient and
the family provided with sufficient information to enable
them to be fully informed so that they can manage their
nut allergy as effectively as possible. It also needs to be
recognized that increased resources may be required to
deliver individualized management plans. Management
plans should be reviewed regularly as family circum-
stances change, for example transition from secondary
school to higher education/employment.
Nut-specific advice
Peanut allergy often coexists with tree nut allergy (see
section on risk factors for development on nut allergy)
and therefore this will need to be considered in the
management plan employed. Peanut-allergic individuals
may be sensitized to legumes (soya, pea and chickpea);
however, the rate of allergy is low in the UK and USA.
In addition a specific tree nut allergy can coexist with
another tree nut allergy. Allergy to cashew nut is

Peanut and tree nut allergy guideline 731
 commonly associated with co-sensitization and allergy
to pistachio [124–126]. Cashew nut is often present in
pre-packaged pesto sauce.
There is evidence for similar co-sensitization between
walnuts and pecan nuts [127]. Medicines containing
peanut oil are unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.
Arachis oil BP is made from refined peanut oil, contain-
ing clinically insignificant quantities of peanut protein.
Medical management
Provision of emergency medication
Oral antihistamines. All patients should be supplied
with oral antihistamines. Long-acting antihistamines
with rapid onset of action, e.g. cetirizine are preferred.
These should be used at the onset of any mild/moderate
reaction, not requiring adrenaline.
AAI provision and training. The decision to provide an
AAI should follow a risk assessment. The allergist
should lead on advice and should consider and dis-
cuss views of the family/patient. Clear indications to
provide
injectable
adrenaline
include
any
previous
episodes of anaphylaxis to a nut. Published BSACI
guidelines
advise
on
the
provision
of
AAI
[128].
Patients with PFS normally do not require an AAI,
unless there have been severe reactions or another
indication for an AAI is present. UK data suggest that
children who are not at risk are being prescribed AAI
[129]. All at-risk patients will require adrenaline to
treat
an
episode
of
anaphylaxis.
However,
most
patients will only need one injection of adrenaline
[128, 130]. The decision to recommend one or more
AAIs must be individualized with each patient and
also requires a thorough risk assessment [128]. The
provision of AAI training does significantly improve
the ability to use an AAI effectively but over time,
this ability diminishes [131–133]. In addition, specific
training is required prior to switching between brands
of any AAI device [134]. Even though AAI provision
has greatly increased over recent years [129], patients
often do not carry prescribed AAIs with them, when
outside the home environment [5, 50, 135]; encourag-
ing patients to carry AAI at all times is an essential
part of training. The provision of written emergency
action plans is essential [130, 136–138].
Patient follow-up. The role of follow-up for primary
nut allergy is the provision of ongoing education on
preventing and managing future reactions (see Box 2).
Allergy tests can be repeated periodically depending on
resources
and
patient’s
symptoms.
Follow-up
in
a
patient with PFS is often not required unless there has
been a severe reaction.
Schools
Section 100 of the Children and Families Act 2014
[139] places a duty on governing bodies of maintained
schools, proprietors of academies and management
committees of pupil referral units (PRUs) to make
arrangements for supporting pupils at their school with
medical conditions. In the case of food allergy, specific
recommendations have been provided by an EAACI/
GA2LEN task force (Box 3) [140].
Natural history
There are no data on resolution and long-term out-
come
of
patients
with
PFS
with
respect
to
nuts.
Therefore, this section specifically focuses on primary
nut allergy. There are few data on the natural history
Box 3. Recommendations for schools adapted from Ref. [140]
1 Ensure there is a system to identify food-allergic children to
staff, especially catering or new/temporary staff
2 Clear allergen labeling should be available for any food pro-
vided by the school. Menus could be made available to the
family in advance with ingredients clearly stated
3 Staff should be made aware of how to handle potential food
allergens safely, including effective cleaning of surfaces and
utensils
4 Schools should consider the impact of provision of foods con-
taining nuts on nut allergic children
5 Discourage trading or sharing food, and sharing utensils or
containers.
6 Ensure lessons avoid the use of provoking food allergens (e.g.
using peanuts during science or art lessons)
7 Educate staff and pupils regarding allergen avoidance and
recognition of food allergy reactions
8 Separating children from their peers during mealtimes is unnec-
essary, provided the other measures described are instituted
Box 2. Management at follow up appointments
1 Take history of reactions to inadvertent exposure to nut and
identification of new allergies
2 Ongoing education on nut avoidance measures
3 Resolution of nut allergy- Periodic measurement of nut SPT +/-
nut sIgE. Resolution may have occurred if there has been no
reaction following accidental ingestion or there has been a sig-
nificant reduction in SPT/sIgE (see figure 1 and 2). Testing can
also be used to determine tolerance or allergy to other nut

 of both peanut allergy and tree nut allergy to deter-
mine whether patients become tolerant. In children
under 2 years of age diagnosed with peanut allergy,
21% outgrew their allergy [111, 141, 142]. The weak-
ness of all these studies is that the initial PA diagno-
sis was not based on strict criteria such as a positive
OFC. One more recent study confirmed PA at 1 year
of age by OFC and by 4 years of age, 22% had
resolved PA [143]. A decreasing SPT weal size pre-
dicted tolerance, whereas an increase weal size pre-
dicted
persistence.
Looking
more
longitudinally,
spontaneous
resolution
of
peanut
allergy
predomi-
nantly occurred by 6 years of age and occurs at a
much lower frequency after 10 years of age [144].
One study on tree nut allergy examined the natural
history of tree nut allergy in children and approxi-
mately 9% of children outgrew their tree nut allergy
[145]. This must be interpreted with caution as many
had
a
diagnosis
based
on
sensitization
only
and
patients were carefully selected to determine resolu-
tion.
Prevention of nut allergy
Early introduction of peanuts into the weaning diets of
atopic infants at high risk of peanut allergy can pre-
vent the development of peanut allergy. A single UK
study
suggests
infants with egg allergy or severe
eczema and a negative peanut oral challenge benefit
from consuming peanut products regularly (at least 2 g
of peanut protein 3 times a week) to prevent the devel-
opment of peanut allergy [36]. There was a 70–86%
risk reduction of developing peanut allergy and it was
greatest in the SPT-negative group (SPT = 0 mm). No
conclusion can be made for children with SPT > 4 mm
as they avoided peanut. Similarly, it is not known if
prevention of PA would result if smaller quantities of
peanut were consumed on a weekly basis. There is no
evidence to support the delayed introduction of peanut
into the infant’s diet. In exclusively breastfed infants
from
the
general
population
who
were
randomly
assigned to the early introduction of six allergenic
foods including peanut from 3 months, or
to the cur-
rent practice recommended in the UK of exclusive
breastfeeding to approximately 6 months of age [15],
there was no significant difference in peanut allergy in
the early-introduction group. In those that achieved the
required peanut ingestion, the prevalence of peanut
allergy was however significantly lower.
Health economic benefits and public health methods of
administering these approaches have not been estab-
lished. For infants who do not have eczema, asthma or
other food allergies, it is reasonable for them to have pea-
nut butter cautiously introduced into their diet at home.
There are no data on prevention of tree nut allergy.
Testing siblings of nut-allergic children
The prevalence of peanut allergy in siblings of children
with peanut allergy is 5–9%, [11, 146–148]. In siblings
of children with peanut allergy who would like to
introduce peanuts into their diet and do not have
eczema, asthma or other food allergies, it is reasonable
for them to cautiously introduce peanut into their diet
at home. In higher risk siblings or high level of parental
anxiety, a negative SPT or sIgE will exclude allergy
[148].
Positive tests may require oral challenge which is
time- and resource consuming. Each case needs to be
assessed on its merits after a careful assessment by a
clinician. There are no data available about tree nut
allergy.
Immunotherapy
Clinical trials of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) have
shown promising results [149–152]. Various routes of
allergen administration are being explored, including the
oral (OIT), sublingual (SLIT) and epicutaneous (EPIT)
route. Although SLIT and EPIT appear to have a favour-
able safety profile, SLIT appears ineffective, and the
effect of desensitization with EPIT is unknown [153]. Fur-
ther evaluation of the use of immune modulators (anti-
IgE and probiotics) in peanut OIT is required [150, 154].
The acquisition of long-term tolerance (where partici-
pants are able to consume peanut ad lib, without any
need for ongoing therapy) vs. sustained unresponsive-
ness (ability to tolerate substantial gaps in nut inges-
tion) vs. transient desensitization (an increase of the
threshold of reactivity to peanut, which requires regular
consumption in order to be maintained), following the
administration
of
peanut
immunotherapy,
is
under
investigation [155].

not constitute an automatic defence for negligence and
conversely non-adherence is not indicative of negli-
gence. It is anticipated that this guideline will be

Appendix 1 Examples of peanut challenge protocols
A peanut challenge protocol is provided as an example of
current clinical practice. It is not intended to be proscrip-
tive and may be adjusted according to local practice and
experience. The challenge doses should be adjusted
according to the clinical history. The lower doses may be
adjusted, so that a lower dose than 1/16th is used as the
first ingested dose. The total dose should equate to a por-
tion considered appropriate for the patient. This would
equate to approximately 15–20 peanuts in older children
and adults, so an extended challenge may be required.
Whole nuts should not be used in challenges in children
under 3 years due to the risk of choking. An alternative
amount of smooth peanut butter may be used. An interval
of 15 min between initial doses is usually sufficient. It
should also be emphasized that continued regular inges-
tion should be recommended following a negative chal-
lenge [111].
