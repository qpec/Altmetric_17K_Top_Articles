Attention control (or executive control) is a higher cognitive
function involved in response selection and inhibition, through
close interactions with the motor system. Here, we tested whether
influences of attention control are also seen on lower level motor
functions of dexterity and strength—by examining relationships
between attention control and motor performance in healthy-
aged and hemiparetic-stroke subjects (n = 93 and 167, respec-
tively). Subjects undertook simple-tracking, precision-hold, and
maximum force-generation tasks, with each hand. Performance
across all tasks correlated strongly with attention control (mea-
sured as distractor resistance), independently of factors such as
baseline performance, hand use, lesion size, mood, fatigue, or
whether distraction was tested during motor or nonmotor cogni-
tive tasks. Critically, asymmetric dissociations occurred in all tasks, in
that severe motor impairment coexisted with normal (or impaired)
attention control whereas normal motor performance was never
associated with impaired attention control (below a task-
dependent threshold). This implies that dexterity and force genera-
tion require intact attention control. Subsequently, we examined
how motor and attention-control performance mapped to lesion
location and cerebral functional connectivity. One component of
motor performance (common to both arms), as well as attention
control, correlated with the anatomical and functional integrity of
a cingulo-opercular “salience” network. Independently of this, mo-
tor performance difference between arms correlated negatively
with the integrity of the primary sensorimotor network and cortico-
spinal tract. These results suggest that the salience network, and its
attention-control function, are necessary for virtually all volitional
motor acts while its damage contributes significantly to the cardinal
motor deficits of stroke.

S
troke is one of the commonest causes of adult disability,
resulting in impairments of both physical (e.g., hemiparesis)
and cognitive (e.g., aphasia and neglect) function (1). These two
broad types of impairment are commonly regarded as having
distinct neuroanatomical bases, entailing different therapeutic
strategies, whereas, in fact, physical and cognitive functions may
share mechanisms, and their measures interdepend. A well-known
example of this is motor neglect (2), in which unilateral motor
dysfunction arises from a lateralized attentional bias, rather than
because of primary motor, or corticospinal tract, disruption.
However, focal brain lesions also impair nonspatial forms of at-
tention, such as alertness (1), that are associated with motor
function (3, 4) although the nature of this relationship is unclear.
Associations could occur because lesions tend to overlap an-
atomically adjacent, yet functionally independent, motor and
attention pathways (5) or because of general illness effects on
mood or fatigue. Alternatively, motor disability or fatigue de-
mands extra attentional resources, which may secondarily impair
performance on tests of attention (6, 7). In the current study, we
sought to distinguish these possibilities from the third reason for
an association: That nonspatial attentional deficits are a cause of
motor impairment.
The type of attention focused on here is attention control (also
termed “executive control” or “cognitive control”), which refers
to the ability to maintain performance as challenges increase, be
they competitive choices or distraction (8, 9). It is an everyday
observation that distraction worsens motor performance (e.g., on
strength (10) or tracking (11) tasks), indicating that the motor
system competes for finite attentional resources. Increasing ev-
idence suggests that a distinct control system manages such re-
source allocation and is recruited during motor acts, even in the
absence of experimental challenges, because purposeful move-
ments entail inhibition of irrelevant or competing motor plans
(12, 13), distractor suppression (14), rule following (15), error
monitoring, and correction (16). In keeping with this, functional–
anatomical associations have been found between basic motor
functions (e.g., strength and dexterity) and cerebral regions in-
volved in attention control, particularly cingulate, inferior frontal,
and temporoparietal cortices (17, 18), that become more apparent
with aging or brain injury (19–22). Such findings extend studies
showing that higher motor functions (e.g., drawing, speech, object
use, and walking) commonly engage executive systems (23–26).
However, while imaging studies suggest anatomical overlap of motor
Significance
Simple voluntary movements (e.g., reaching or gripping) de-
teriorate with distraction, suggesting that the attention-control
system—which suppresses distraction—influences motor con-
trol. Here, we tested the causal dependency of simple move-
ments on attention control, and its neuroanatomical basis, in
healthy elderly and patients with focal brain lesions. Not only
did we find that attention control correlates with motor per-
formance, correcting for lesion size, fatigue, etc., but we found a
revealing pattern of dissociations: Severe motor impairment
could occur with normal attention control whereas impaired
attention control never occurred with disproportionately milder
motor impairment—suggesting that attention control is re-
quired for normal motor performance. One implication is that a
component of stroke paralysis arises from poor attentional
control, which could itself be a therapeutic target.

 with attention-control functions, they have not to date shown
whether attention control is a requisite for basic motor functions—as
is the objective here.
Given evidence for motor and attention-control interactions,
and noting that stroke-induced impairments in these two functions
are associated behaviorally (3, 4), and anatomically (5), we hy-
pothesized that one component of stroke hemiparesis arises from
damage to a domain-general, attention-control system, thereby
implying that normal motor performance requires intact attention
control. To test this, we observed the pattern of dissociations
between motor and attention-control performance in a large co-
hort of hemiparetic stroke patients that, by random distribution,
should include lesions with variable differential overlap of motor
versus attention-control systems. We reasoned that, if attention
control is necessary for motor function, then attention-control
impairments would always be associated with motor deficits that
are proportionate or worse (i.e., we would not find dissociations
where severe attentional impairment coexists with relatively mild
motor impairment). Conversely, if poor motor performance in-
creases distractibility (6, 7), then severe motor impairment would
always be associated with impaired attention control (i.e., we
would not find dissociations of severe motor impairment and
preserved attention control). A third possibility—that associations
occur because of anatomical proximity, but not functional in-
teraction, between attention-control and motor systems (5)—al-
lows for both types of dissociation because, by chance, some
lesions are likely to target either system solely or preferentially. To
increase the likelihood of discovering such dissociations, we fo-
cused on subjects with mild-moderate deficits who had small le-
sions that are likely to result in variable relative overlap of two
adjacent networks and without confounding cognitive deficits: e.g.,
gross executive impairments, neglect, or apraxia.
In the following experiments we (i) characterize motor per-
formance in healthy subjects and hemiparetic stroke patients in
terms of separable bilateral and unilateral components; (ii) show
how these motor components relate to distractibility during
motor and nonmotor cognitive tasks, correcting for lesion size
and other potential confounds; (iii) characterize the profile of
motor/attention-control dissociations; and (iv) ascertain how the
two motor components and attention control relate to lesion
overlap and functional connectivity, of a putative attention-
control (“salience”) network (9), as opposed to other cognitive
or motor networks.

(A) Tracking and precision tasks required subjects to vary grip force, thereby moving a crosshair (X) onto a target (T) that moved vertically (tracking) or
was stationary (precision), in presence of 0, 1, or 3 distractors (D). The force task required subjects to apply a maximal, brief grip, with only the peak force
recorded. (B) Examples of X and T vertical positions in single trials of tracking and precision, in control (blue) and patient (red). (C) Scatterplots of accuracy in

precision, and force tasks. Diagonal line reflects equal performance between hands. Arrows show how performance can be resolved into bilateral (1.) and
unilateral (2.) components, where the former is directly proportional to absolute nonparetic-hand performance (horizontal axis), and the latter represents
performance difference between hands. For example, a patient with paretic-hand strength of 66% (gray circle) may have a nonparetic hand strength ranging
between 66% and 100% (range of data points along dashed line).: the former extreme representing 100% bilateral and 0% unilateral components, the latter
representing 0% bilateral and 100% unilateral components.

 and Materials and Methods) (n = 176, 37, and 213 for the three tasks,
respectively) (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S4 provide subject details). In
all three tasks, in the absence of distractors, patients’ paretic-hand
performance was worse than with their nonparetic hand while con-
trols were worse using left relative to right hand with tracking only
(SI Appendix, Table S5). Additionally, the two hands correlated
strongly with each other (Fig. 1C) although correlation strength (r2)
decreased and offset (y intercept) increased progressively between
tracking, precision, and force tasks, reflecting increasing disparity
between hands. Performance of the paretic hand was thus resolvable
into bilateral and unilateral components—the former proportionate
to nonparetic hand performance, the latter reflecting the difference
between hands (Fig. 1C, arrows). Relative to controls, patients
performed worse not only in their paretic, but also nonparetic,
hands, thus revealing ipsilesional deficits (27, 28) in all tasks (hence
the term “nonparetic hand” in fact refers to the clinically unaffected
hand). There was no significant difference comparing second versus
first block performance for all tasks in controls or patients with either
hand (P > 0.05, sign test).
Relationship Between Distractibility and Motor Performance. When
distractors were introduced, performance deteriorated pro-
portionately to the number of distractors, with the degree of
impairment (“interference”) greater for patients than controls
(Fig. 2 A and B and SI Appendix, Table S6A). One explanation
for this is that effortful use of a disabled arm results in less
attention available to resist distraction (6, 7). However, in-
terference increases in patients occurred similarly in paretic and
nonparetic hands (20% vs. 23% absolute Δ relative to controls;
P > 0.1) or were even greater in patients’ nonparetic than paretic
hands, using unnormalized data (16% vs. 13%; P < 0.05). Fur-
thermore, by matching undistracted performance (comparing
fast tracking in controls, with slow tracking in patients’ non-
paretic hands; P > 0.1 comparing baselines), interference was
still greater in patients (P < 0.01)—suggesting that poor per-
formance per se did not drive increased distractibility. In-
terference increases in patients, relative to controls, were also
similar comparing slow and fast versions of tracking (19% vs.
23%) (Fig. 2B) and comparing precision, in which the target was
stationary, versus tracking (24% vs. 21%; all comparisons: P >
0.1). These findings suggest that attention-control impairments
in patients are not specific to target tracking but rather relate to
motor dexterity in general.
An association of high interference with poor undistracted
motor performance was seen not only comparing patients versus
controls, but also as between-subject negative correlations for all
three tasks (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Table S6B),
correcting for lesion volume, mood, fatigue, or pain. In the force
task, similar correlations with interference were seen, whether
measuring the average or best-out-of-four readings, the latter of
which resemble conventional clinical power scores [e.g., Medical
Research Council (MRC)] that typically score maximum effort.
Correlation strengths with interference were similar for motor
performance in paretic and nonparetic arms (bilateral compo-
nent), but significantly less for motor performance difference
between arms (unilateral component; Δr: P < 0.01).
Dissociations Between Distractibility and Motor Performance. To
understand the directionality of these associations, it is notable
that, for all tasks, dissociations between motor performance and
distractor resistance occurred asymmetrically: Poor motor per-
formance could coexist with low interference values (i.e., intact
attention control) whereas good motor performance did not
occur with high interference values, but rather was strictly as-
sociated with a narrow band of low-interference values (seen as a
relative absence of cases in upper-right, relative to lower-left,
wedges of Fig. 2C graphs, the range of low-interference values
associated with normal performance being in the following or-
der: tracking < precision < force). More formally, this is dem-
onstrated as less interference variability comparing upper- versus
lower-tertile paretic-arm motor performances (P < 0.05, for all
three tasks) or as a negative correlation between absolute re-
siduals (from linear models shown in Fig. 2C) and paretic-arm
performance (r = −0.21, −0.14; P < 0.05, for tracking and force:
i.e., as performance worsens, the association with interference
weakens). This suggests that normal motor performance in all
three tasks (without distraction) requires intact attention control
whereas impaired motor performance may occur due to impaired
attention control or other factors. Since the absence of good-
performance/poor-attention-control dissociations was observed
for both paretic and nonparetic arm performance, the performance
component dependent upon attention control appears to be bi-
lateral. By contrast, poor-performance/good-attention-control dis-
sociations were largely selective for paretic arm (comparisons of
interference variability between upper- versus lower-tertiles of
nonparetic arm tracking or force were not significant; P > 0.05)—
indicating that the performance component independent of at-
tention control is more unilateral (i.e., measured as a difference
between arms).
Distractibility During a Nonmotor Memory Task. An alternative ex-
planation for correlated interference and motor performance,
measured in opposite arms, is that unilateral lesions disrupt bi-
lateral motor systems (27, 28). Consequently, increased in-
terference, measured in the “nonparetic’ arm, may be secondary
to performance difficulties in this arm, causing attentional real-
location (6, 7), rather than vice versa. Against this is our earlier
observation that patients’ interference level (taking unnormal-
ized data) was higher using the nonparetic than the paretic arm.
Additionally, we measured interference during a nonmotor,
working-memory (WM) task (n = 36) (Fig. 2D) and compared
this to undistracted motor performance on tracking and force
tasks. Patients showed greater interference with WM perfor-
mance than controls (25% vs. 0%; P < 0.01). Furthermore,
negative correlations occurred between tracking and force per-
formance and WM interference, at least as strong as with motor
interference (corrected for lesion volume and mood) (Fig. 2E
and SI Appendix, Table S6C) (e.g., correlation of paretic arm
tracking performance against WM interference: r2 = 0.54; and
against motor interference: r2 = 0.39; or for paretic arm force,
correlations were r2 = 0.34 and 0.23 respectively; all P < 0.001).
Once again, poor motor performance was associated with a wide
range of WM interference values whereas good motor perfor-
mance was strictly associated with low WM interference (in-
terference variance of upper- versus lower-tertile performance:
P < 0.01)—indicating that not only is attention control necessary
for normal motor performance, but this is a domain-general
capacity, engaged also in nonmotor, cognitive tasks.
Dependency of Motor and Attention-Control Components on Lesion
Anatomy. We next determined how lesion-anatomical correlates
of bilateral and unilateral motor components [defined, re-
spectively, as absolute nonparetic hand performance and (non-
paretic–paretic) hand difference] compared with that for attention
control: i.e., resistance to distraction (Fig. 3A). First, we mapped
lesion locations associated with the highest 50% values for either
motor deficit, while excluding locations seen with the lowest 50%
deficit values (for tracking and force tasks). This showed an ana-
tomical separation of the two deficits: Bilateral motor impairments
were associated with (unilateral) lesions to the anterior striatum,
insula, medial thalamus, and anterior corona radiata whereas
unilateral motor impairments were associated with lesions to the
posterior internal capsule and pons [i.e., along the corticospinal
tract (CST)] (Fig. 3 A, ii and iii) (maps show lesion locations
common to both tracking and force analysis). Importantly, the
anatomical pattern of attention-control impairments (defined as

 interference values greater than those of controls, P < 0.05)
matches more closely the lesion pattern associated with bilateral-
motor, rather than unilateral-motor, deficits (Fig. 3 A, iv)
(Dice similarity index = 18.2 vs. 4.4, respectively; comparison
with randomly permuted lesion maps’ Dice scores: P < 0.001 and
P = 0.843, respectively; spatial correlation r: 0.309 vs. 0.107; Δr:
Z = 380, P < 0.001).
We next determined lesion locations significantly associated
with each type of performance impairment using a voxelwise
Brunner–Munzel statistical analysis. This showed that bilateral-
motor and attention-control deficits were associated with lesions
to the anterior corona radiata, anterior internal capsule, and
anterior striatum whereas unilateral-motor deficits were associ-
ated with damage to the posterior internal capsule (P < 0.05,
corrected) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
A more focused approach for investigating the anatomical bases
of motor and attention interactions was conducted by in-
terrogating how each function relates to lesion overlap of a priori

(A) Accuracy as a function of distractor number, in slow and fast versions of tracking, in right and left hands. Line gradients—i.e., distractibility—are
steeper in patients in both hands, relative to controls, even when matching groups for baseline accuracy (circled), indicating that higher interference is not
secondary to poorer performance. L, left; R, right. (B) Normalized interference values (i.e., performance decrement with 3 vs. 0 distractors), with slow and fast
tracking, and precision. The interference increases in patients relative to controls are similar comparing hands and tasks (P > 0.05). (C) Scatterplots of paretic-
hand motor performance versus normalized interference measured in nonparetic hand, in tracking and precision [both without distractors (D0)], and force. As
well as showing negative correlations for all three tasks (P < 0.001), asymmetric dissociations are also observed for all three (seen as outliers in bottom-left but
not top-right of each graph). This is also demonstrated as significantly higher variance of interference values in lowest versus highest performance tertiles (P <
0.05), or by the residuals of the regression lines shown getting progressively smaller with better paretic-arm performance (r = −0.21, −0.24; P < 0.05; tracking
and force). Regression lines shown (also in E). (D) Nonmotor version of tracking required subjects to watch a moving target T, whose features changed every
2–4 s, before being probed on T’s last features. On half of trials, they ignored three distractors (D). Interference is quantified as the recall accuracy without
distractors, minus accuracy with distractors. B, blue; D, down; G, green; N, no; P, pink; R, red; U, up; Y, yes. (E) Scatterplots of normalized interference on

lesion volume), but not with lesion volume of CST [Δr between
regions of interest (ROIs): P < 0.001] (Fig. 3 B and C). Conversely,
unilateral motor deficits correlated with CST lesion load (r2 = 0.10–
25; P ≤ 0.01, corrected), but significantly less strongly with attention-
control network overlap (Δr between ROIs: P = 0.020 and 0.13, for
tracking and force, respectively). Lesion overlap with left frontopar-
ietotemporal (30) (“praxis”) or right dorsal frontoparietal (“visuo-
spatial”) networks or corpus callosum correlated with neither motor
nor attention-control deficit (r2 = 0.00–0.01; P > 0.05 corrected).
Relationship of Motor and Attention-Control Components with
Functional Connectivity. Undistracted motor performance in pa-
tients’ paretic arm (or right hand of controls) was related to the
functional integrity of eight robust cerebral and cerebellar resting-
state networks (RSNs) (31) (n = 46). The only RSNs whose
integrity correlated with tracking or force performance, after
correction for lesion volume and age, were primary sensorimotor
and cingulo-opercular RSNs (Fig. 4 A and B and SI Appendix,
Table S9) (r2: 0.16–0.43; P < 0.05 corrected). On partialing out

 force hand difference, correlations of absolute motor performance
with sensorimotor RSN integrity became insignificant (P = 0.243)
whereas partial correlations remained significant for cingulo-
opercular RSN (P < 0.01). This can be explained by a negative
correlation between force hand difference and sensorimotor RSN
(r2 = 0.54; P < 0.01 corrected, patients only) but not cingulo-
opercular RSN integrity (r2 = 0.06; P = 0.28) (Fig. 4C). This
indicates that sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular RSNs corre-
spond, respectively, to unilateral and bilateral motor performance
components.
Since correlations between absolute, or hand-difference, per-
formance measures versus RSN integrity appear to mirror the
functional-network lesion-anatomy correlations presented ear-
lier, we tested whether RSN integrity related to lesion anatomy
profiles. A cross-correlation analysis of the eight principle RSNs
versus our earlier anatomical ROIs demonstrated significant
negative correlations between primary sensorimotor RSN in-
tegrity and CST-M1 (and, to a weaker extent, callosal) lesion
load and between cingulo-opercular RSN integrity and attention-
control ROI lesion load (SI Appendix, Table S10).
Head movement did not differ significantly between controls
versus patients, or between high versus low values of tracking accu-
racy, force grip, or hand-difference force grip [t (44) ≤ 1.92, P > 0.05].
Discussion
Movement selection and execution require inhibition of irrele-
vant or competing motor plans (12), distractor suppression (14),
and error monitoring (16)—all core functions of the attention-
control system (8). We therefore hypothesized that lesions within
the attention-control network would have consequences, not only
on cognitive performance, but also on basic motor abilities. Sup-
porting this, not only did we find consistent and strong correlations
between attention control and motor performance, correcting for
lesion size, fatigue, mood, baseline performance, and task factors,
but three key findings here suggest a causal relationship.
First, we observed asymmetric behavioral dissociations across
all four behavioral experiments, showing that, while severe motor
impairment coexists with a wide range of attention control, there
are no cases where normal or mildly impaired motor function
coexists with impaired attention control (the cutoff for attention

 impairment being stricter for dexterity than strength tasks).
Were associations between motor performance and attention
control caused by mere anatomical proximity of functionally
separate systems, then we might expect double dissociations, in
which mild motor impairment associates with severe attention-
control deficit. Although our patient sample was biased toward
subjects with clinical motor deficits (arm paresis was an inclusion
criterion), it is notable that, even among healthy aged controls,
all subjects with greater attention-control impairment had pro-
portionate (subclinical) bilateral motor impairments [parallel
impairments in cognition and physical strength with aging have
been observed previously (32)]. Furthermore, we tested 167 pa-
tients, many of whom performed grip tasks within normal limits
despite having paresis in the same arm. As motor performance
verged toward normality, so too did the range of attention con-
trol converge strictly upon normality. Lesion size tended to be
small (volume interquartile range: 3–15 cc), with 18 cases in
whom attention-control regions were damaged, while sparing
primary motor/CST regions; and a further 26 cases occurred in
whom attention-control regions were damaged in greater volume
than motor regions—together representing 38% of the patient
sample. Such lesions, in targeting executive regions exclusively or
predominantly, might be expected to result in proportionately
worse impairments in attention control than motor performance,
if motor and attention-control functions were independent—but
this was not found.
Secondly, we confirmed that the relationship between atten-
tion control and dexterity or strength, as well as asymmetric
dissociations of the kind just described, were seen equally with
distractibility during a nonmotor cognitive task. This excludes the
possibility that poor or effortful motor performance was the
cause of poor attention control (6, 7). Furthermore, this indicates
that the attention-control function underpinning low-level motor
actions is a domain-general function, explaining why strength or
dexterity is impaired by concurrent cognitive tests (7, 10, 11).
Finally, we found that one component of motor performance
(common to both arms), as well as attention control, was associ-
ated with the anatomical and functional integrity of the cingulo-
opercular network [previously implicated in higher cognitive
control (9)]. This association existed after correction for lesion size
and was specific, not being found with integrity of primary sen-
sorimotor/CST, dorsal-attention, and praxis-associated networks.
The fact that attention-control dysfunction was associated with the
bilateral motor component distinguishes our findings from that
seen in motor neglect (2), in which a unilateral (contralesional)
motor impairment is seen secondary to impairment of the spatial-
orienting system.
Relevance to Associations Between Cognitive and Motor Functions.
Our results help interpret a diverse set of studies showing that
domain-general cognition, especially executive or attention control,
is closely related to motor ability. Studies on standing or walking
efficiency, mostly in elderly subjects, show associations with ex-
ecutive functions and divided attention, independently of general
reaction time (25). Tests of manual dexterity correlate with the
ability to resist distraction and alertness (33) while impairments
in handgrip strength are preceded by, and proportionate to, re-
ductions in general cognition (34). In childhood development,
motor dexterity predicts subsequent cognitive attainment (35)
while both attentional and motor impairments are reversible
with methylphenidate (36). However, various reasons may ac-
count for associations between cognition and motor performance
that do not imply direct causation. For example, genes, aging,
disease, and drugs may affect motor and attention systems con-
jointly, rather than acting via attention alone. Furthermore, im-
pairments in motor performance due to disability or exhaustion
can have secondary effects on attention control, rather than vice
versa (6, 7). To this end, patients with focal brain injury can
provide an explanatory advantage since attention and motor
performance potentially may dissociate and functional impair-
ments can be related to lesion neuroanatomy.
Executive deficits are common following stroke (1) and cor-
relate with motor performance and recovery (3). Lesion loca-
tions associated with executive impairments occur not just in
higher frontoparietal regions (37), but also in premotor, striatal,
and thalamic regions (5), that run close to corticospinal tract.
Thus, relationships between attention control and motor per-
formance could arise because lesions frequently overlap spatially
contiguous, but functionally independent, neural systems. Our
results argue otherwise. Since high distractibility was found to be
incompatible with normal, or mildly impaired, motor perfor-
mance on formal tests of dexterity and strength, this suggests that
intact attention control is necessary for normal performance on
clinical measures of motor function. It will be beneficial to ad-
dress the question of whether naturalistic movements (e.g.,
measured by wearable sensors) are as susceptible to attention-
control impairments.
Relevance to Ipsilesional Motor Impairment and Functional-Imaging
Patterns Poststroke. Ipsilesional motor impairments are well-
described after stroke (27), and have been interpreted in terms of
bilaterally represented sensorimotor circuits, including uncrossed
corticospinal tracts (38), praxis (28), and visuospatial systems (39).
Our anatomical findings argue against ipsilesional deficits being
caused by lesions to the uncrossed corticospinal tract because ipsi-
lesional impairments (i.e., bilateral motor component) correlated
selectively with lesion load of the attention network, but not the
predecussation corticospinal tract (Fig. 3A). Furthermore the bi-
lateral, relative to the unilateral, component increased as task
complexity increased (Fig. 1C), despite movement type (grip)
remaining constant, indicating that ipsilesional motor impairment
relates to a nonmotor, cognitive, rather than praxis, function. Po-
tential confounds of apraxia and visuospatial neglect were also
minimized in our study by excluding patients who manifested such
deficits using formal testing, and by minimizing praxis requirements
(the grip was already placed in the hand by the researcher). The
fact that ipsilesional impairments were of a similar magnitude
between right and left hemiplegics also indicates involvement of a
broadly symmetric network (as for attention control), rather than
strongly lateralized networks (such as those for visuospatial pro-
cessing or praxis) (Fig. 4). Attentional impairment as an in-
terpretation for ipsilesional deficits has previously been discounted
(28) on the basis of normal bedside tests of inattentiveness or
cognition. However, our patients also passed similar cognitive tests,
suggesting that the relevant test of attention control may only be
detected by computerized tests: e.g., distractor resistance.
A further implication of our findings relates to interpreting
functional-imaging patterns after stroke, particularly the obser-
vation that hemiplegic arm use consistently activates more bi-
lateral and anterior regions, than healthy controls (40). While
these are interpreted in terms of motor-network reorganization,
an alternative account is that such additional activations reflect
attention-control network dysregulation or compensatory re-
cruitment of attentional areas. Recruitment of frontoparietal
areas occurs in healthy subjects when they attend to action or
during movements without explicit attention in elderly or disabled
subjects (19, 41, 42). Moreover, the dorsal premotor cortex—a
common site for movement-associated hyperactivation after stroke—
forms part of an executive-control network (43). Movement-
associated hyperactivation in hemiparetic stroke patients has also
been observed in anterior cingulate, lateral/inferior prefrontal
regions, and insulae (20, 21), which might reflect compensatory
up-regulation of the attention-control system or increased effort,
since such studies focus on chronic stroke, when early disability
has partly recovered. Future studies should ascertain whether
movement-related activation patterns and connectivity [including

 reciprocal inhibition (44)] are consistent with the resting-state
connectivity profiles of cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor net-
works observed here.
Relevance to Stroke Hemiparesis More Generally. To increase our
chance of discovering attention–motor dissociations, it was ad-
vantageous to use a patient sample with relatively small lesions
and to exclude subjects with additional cognitive impairments.
However, this raises the question of whether our findings gen-
eralize to subjects with larger lesions and more severe hemi-
plegia. In this regard, it is first important to realize that the
motor impairment we recorded in our experiment appears
milder than the same patients’ arm-function/clinical scores be-
cause our tasks tested power grip—that is relatively spared in
stroke arm paresis (45, 46). Secondly, 17% of our tested patients
(n = 28) had moderate-severe weakness (grip-force or arm Fugl–
Meyer score <50%), whose behavioral and anatomical–func-
tional imaging profiles extend the pattern observed in subjects
with milder weakness. Thus, as hemiplegia severity increases, so
too does the size of the ipsilesional motor impairment (Fig. 1C)
(see also ref. 28), that we have found is proportionate to both
attention-control impairment (Fig. 2C) and relative damage of
the cingulo-opercular network (Figs. 3 and 4). For example,
patients with contralateral grip weakness <65% normal (data
points below the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 1C) showed a
range of ipsilesional grip impairment (range: ∼60–100%; median
∼90%) that our results indicate was due to an attention-control
impairment acting bilaterally. Finally, we note that the median
disability of our sample [National Institute of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS): 4] is similar to that of large unselected samples
of incident stroke (e.g., ref. 47; NIHSS: 3) yet even mild motor
deficits often result in significant handicap (48).
Conclusion
Our study provides converging behavioral, lesion–anatomical,
and functional–anatomical evidence for simple motor perfor-
mance (dexterity or force) being dependent, not only upon pri-
mary motor structures, but also an intact attention-control
system. Given that attention-control deficits are common after
stroke (1), our finding suggests that one component of the car-
dinal hemiplegic syndrome after focal brain injury, measurable in
the ipsilesional limb, reflects a disorder of nonspatial attention.
Furthermore, motor assessments can be usefully parameterized
in terms of the degree to which they engage attention control, as
opposed to the unilateral primary motor system. One implication
is that executive-boosting therapies, such as “brain training” (49)
or magnetic stimulation (50), may confer secondary benefits on
physical rehabilitation.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Right-handed patients with mild-to-moderate unilateral arm
weakness due to recent unilateral stroke (<4 wk), as well as age-matched
controls, were screened. To reduce confounding explanations for impaired
motor performance, we excluded subjects with clinically manifest cognitive
impairments, as judged from history or bedside testing, including frontal
dysfunction (inability to complete the Trail-Making Part B test), apraxia
(ideational and ideomotor) (51), and neglect (Behavioral Inattention Test:
star cancellation, line bisection, figure copying, and visual inattention) (52).
Other exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) severe arm weakness (finger-
flexion MRC power grade <2), (ii) preexisting weakness in either arm, or
bilateral arm weakness or ataxia, (iii) comprehension difficulty (inability to
signal understanding of study purpose or task instructions), (iv) psychiatric
disorder, and (v) severe cerebral white-matter disease [graded using the
Fazekas score (53)] or other brain lesions.
Age-matched controls were healthy volunteers or nonstroke patients (e.g.,
migraine) who had no limb impairment or neuroimaging lesions but oth-
erwise fitted the above criteria. Subjects were excluded who were unable to
perform the tracking task with either hand with ≥10% accuracy (i.e., >95%
upper confidence interval for chance performance).
For precision and resting-state fMRI studies, we extended recruitment
to patients with severe paresis (MRC power grade of >0) to see if our
earlier results in more mildly affected subjects extended to more severely
affected subjects.
Subject characteristics for the four experiments are shown in SI Appendix,
Tables S1–S4. There were no significant differences between right-arm–
weak patients, left-arm–weak patients, and controls in terms of age, gen-
der, handedness, background cerebral white-matter disease, and anxiety,
but patients were slightly more depressed (difference: 1/15 points; P <
0.002). Comparing left-arm–weak with right-arm–weak patients, there were
no significant differences in lesion volume or function and strength of
affected arms.
Tasks. The study was approved by the United Kingdom South East Coast
Research Ethics Committee. Patients underwent informed consent.
Subjects were tested for dexterity and strength using visuomotor force
tracking and precision and maximum-force grip tasks, in each hand. Power
grip has the advantage of being a relatively less affected movement in stroke
hemiplegia and has minimal praxis requirements (the device is prepositioned
in the subject’s hand by the experimenter), and grip tracking can be achieved
relatively accurately even in the presence of significant hand or upper-arm
weakness (45, 46). This accounts for why subjects’ mean performance dif-
ference was relatively small (1–12%), yet the mean clinical score suggested a
more profound functional impairment (NIHSS motor-arm component = 2).
Tasks were run on E-Prime software, using a 15-inch laptop screen and a
digital handgrip (<100 N force; Current Designs).
The tracking task consisted of a green star (1.2°) moving up and down,
according to a polynomial sine–cosine function time course, with random
parameters, varying trial-to-trial, but fixed between subjects (Fig. 1A). Sub-
jects varied hand-grip force, that proportionately moved a crosshair, which,
when overlying the star, turned it pink. Performance was calculated as the
percentage of time that the crosshair overlay the target star, across a 16-s
trial, with 16 trials per hand, excluding the first 2 s and with 6-s rests be-
tween trials. Hand use alternated twice across a session (right-left-right-left/
left-right-left-right), order counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects prac-
ticed for eight trials before the test session. The software was calibrated so
that the maximum required grip force was ≤70% of each subject’s best.
Attention control was manipulated by varying the number of visual dis-
tractor stimuli (0,1,3), that moved according to the same pattern as the target
star in the tracking task, but asynchronously. The task also varied speed
(number of target direction changes per trial: 4–6 versus 8–12). All results
reflect slow trials, except that fast trials (of controls) were used to match
group baselines by comparison with slow trials (of patients) and to test
whether attention-control effects depend upon tracking speed.
Attention control was analyzed in two ways. First, performance accuracy
was entered as a dependent variable into an ANOVA with factors: distractor
number, hand use, speed, and group (between-subject factor). Second, we
calculated normalized interference as the difference in performance be-
tween 0 and 3 distractors, divided by baseline (0 distractor) performance. The
latter value was used as the dependent variable in an ANOVA with factors
hand use, speed, and group. One advantage of analyzing raw scores was to
allow for selection of conditions that equated baseline performance between
groups (namely, fast tracking in controls versus slow tracking in patients).
The precision task was similar to that of tracking, except that the target
was set at a random vertical level and remained stationary for 8 s (Fig. 1B).
Tracking accuracy was calculated from 2 s after target presentation to the
end of the trial. This was performed by a separate, smaller cohort of subjects
to tracking. The purpose of this was to see if results seen during tracking
generalized to a dexterity task without the visuomotor demands of a con-
tinuously moving target.
The force task required subjects to exert a power grip maximally at any
time over a 7-s measurement window, while recording peak force relative to
the device’s maximum range. Visual feedback was provided as a vertical bar
proportionate to force. Subjects were instructed as follows: “Squeeze as
hard as you can for a split second. In so doing, try to make the red bar hit the
top of the screen.” The maximum was achievable in both hands, in 19 out of
20 subjects aged <40 y (from a preliminary pilot study). Four trials per hand
were performed, split either side of the tracking task. There was no signif-
icant difference between pretracking versus posttracking values. Subjects
who undertook the tracking or precision tasks (separate cohorts) both
contributed data to the force task. Performance on this task was compared
with interference measured during the tracking or precision task.
The nonmotor task was similar to the slow tracking task, only subjects paid
attention to the star’s color (red/green/blue/pink), movement direction (up/
down), and whether a crosshair, no longer controlled by the subject, overlay

 it (yes/no) (Fig. 2D). Characteristics changed every 2–4 s. Trials varied 4–16 s in
duration, and 1 s afterward, subjects were probed for the star characteristics
just before trial termination, via three questions (subjects were told that
only response choice was important and not response time; subjects could
reply “don’t know”). Accuracy reflects the proportion of trials in which all
three characteristics were correctly remembered. Attention control was
manipulated by adding, in half of trials, three distractors. Interference was
measured as the proportionate decrease in accuracy, comparing trials with
distractors to trials without. This was compared with the same subjects’
performance on the undistracted version of the tracking task and force task.
In 46 subjects (23 patients), we also provided subjects with two visual
analog scales (1–6), rating their experience of fatigue and pain, respectively,
before and after performance of tracking and force tasks. These scores did
not correlate with motor performance or interference scores.
Statistical tests were nonparametric throughout, including permutation
ANOVAs, and were performed in MATLAB (v2012b).
Voxel–Lesion Function Mapping. Lesion analysis was performed on patients
who undertook both tracking and force tasks, as well as those undergoing
fMRI (see later) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and Table S11). Lesions were manually
delineated in MRICroN and spatially normalized in SPM software, as pre-
viously described (54). MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (and/or fluid-atten-
uated inversion recovery) images were used in all cases, except six patients in
whom the lesion was clearly discernible on computerized tomography. Im-
aging resolution for each image type was as follows: DWI: 1.4 × 1.4 ×
6.5 mm; FLAIR: 0.6 × 0.6 × 6 mm; CT: 0.4 × 0.4 × 2.4 (brainstem) or 7.2 mm
(cerebrum). Right- and left-sided lesions were flipped onto a single side
given nonsignificant differences in standard motor measures of right- and
left-hemiparetic patients and given approximately symmetric a priori re-
gions of interest (see below). Although all cases had essentially unilateral
lesions contralateral to hemiparesis, in nine cases, a tiny part of the overall
acute lesion (<5%) was seen on the opposite side. This was included within
the unilateral composite although deleting these portions was not found to
be influential to the results.
A primary question was whether the anatomical basis for one component of
motor performance related to the anatomical basis of attention control. We
first derived lesion maps specific to the bilateral and unilateral motor com-
ponents defined as absolute nonparetic-hand performance and (nonparetic–
paretic) hand difference, respectively. These maps were created by performing
median splits of patients’ performance for each component and plotting lesion
distributions for subjects in the top half (i.e., highest impairment), masking for
locations found in >10% of bottom-half (low-impairment) subjects. These two
motor component lesion maps were then compared with the lesion map for
highly impaired attention-control patients, defined as subjects with in-
terference values of >0.95 percentile relative to controls. Spatial similarities
(Dice scores) between each motor component lesion map versus attention
control were calculated, and these were compared with Dice scores of
1,000 randomly permuted “motor component” lesion maps (of the same size
as equivalent motor lesion maps, limited to voxels containing at least the
minimum number of lesions seen in the highly impaired attention-control
contrast (i.e., n > 6). We also calculated the difference between the two
spatial correlations using nonparametric Fisher Z transformation.
A secondary question was to determine the anatomical basis for each
performance measure—bilateral, unilateral motor components, and in-
terference—and, specifically, to determine how each related to a priori
functional motor and attentional networks. First, we performed voxelwise
statistical associations for each measure, using the rank-order Brunner–
Munzel test (55) and impairment cutoff thresholds as defined above. Sta-
tistical significance was set at P < 0.05 corrected and was determined from Z
thresholds using lesion permutation testing (restricted to lesion n ≥ 10) (56)
implemented in MRICroN (people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/). Secondly, we
determined correlations between each of the two motor, and one atten-
tional, measures, with lesion overlap of a priori functionally defined regions:
namely, (i) the cingulo-opercular, attention-control (or salience) network (9),
equivalent to the executive-control network described by ref. 31, (ii) the
corticospinal tract, (iii) the right dorsal frontoparietal (visuospatial atten-
tion) (57), (iv) the left frontotemporoparietal (praxis) (30), and (v) the callosal
tracts. For ROIs iii and iv, unflipped lesion maps were used while, for ROI ii,
we assessed correlations using flipped and unflipped lesions separately.
The corticospinal tract and callosal ROIs were derived from a probabilistic
white-matter atlas, thresholded at 0.10 (58). For the attention-control network
ROI, we used a mask of anatomical regions identified by resting-state network
(RSN) independent-component analysis of resting-state fMRI data (31) (n =
54 healthy controls; component thresholded at >50% peak component
weight; see below for resting-state fMRI analysis). The component chosen was
that which was most similar to a cingulo-opercular, attention-control (or sa-
lience) RSN, based upon spatial correlation with a previously published RSN
(31) (referred to as the “executive network” within that publication) (Fig. 4,
image 2), that is associated with error detection, distraction suppression, and
conflict resolution (9). The executive-control RSN was combined with a cor-
egistered probabilistic atlas of cerebral white-matter tracts that connect
executive-control network RSN nodes (29) (Fig. 3 A, v).
Right frontoparietal and left frontotemporoparietal anatomical ROIs were
identified by additional resting-state analysis components (Fig. 4, images
3 and 4), that were most spatially similar to those previously associated with
visuospatial attention (right-sided) (59), and praxis (left-sided network), re-
spectively (31). These cortical ROIs were combined with atlases of the su-
perior longitudinal fasciculus on the corresponding side.
Normalized lesions were superimposed upon each ROI, allowing de-
termination of the number of lesioned voxels within each ROI. This value was
correlated with either bilateral or unilateral components of tracking or force.
Correlations were corrected for lesion volume. Differences between corre-
lation coefficients comparing the two ROIs [i.e., (r for correlation of per-
formance with ROI1 lesion volume) − (r for correlation of performance with
ROI2 lesion volume)] were performed by permutation testing, in which the
ROI label (attention-control network or CST) was randomized with respect to
the lesion volumes for each ROI, and the r difference for each of 2,000 such
samples was compared with the correct labeling.
Resting-State Functional MRI. A group of hemiparetic stroke patients and
controls, different from those participating in the behavioral experiments,
underwent a 6.5-min MRI scan measuring blood-oxygen level-dependent
(BOLD) functional activity at rest. Resting-state functional MRI involved
the following imaging parameters: scanner type: Siemens 3T; duration:
6.5 min; volumes: 192; repetition time (TR): 2 s; echo time (TE): 25 ms; voxel
size: 3.4 × 3.4 × 4 mm; 32 slices; flip angle (FA): 90°; field of view (FOV):
220 mm. For spatial normalization and lesion masking of BOLD time-series
data, a high-resolution T1 structural image was also obtained: TR: 1,900 ms;
TE: 2.5 ms; FA: 90°; voxel-size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm; FOV: 250 mm. Subjects were
instructed to keep their eyes open and maintain fixation on a cross displayed
in the center of their visual field.
Preprocessing of resting-state BOLD time-series data using FSL software
(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki, v 3.10) (60) consisted of the following: re-
moval of nonbrain tissue, and first 6 volumes per scan; bandpass filtering
(0.01–0.2 Hz); motion correction; grand-mean intensity normalization; spatial
smoothing (Gaussian kernel FWHM 5 mm); registration to standard Montreal
Neurological Institute space; and exclusive masking with a composite of all
patients’ acute-stroke lesions (from coregistered FLAIR or DWI). To identify
resting-state networks (RSNs) of interest, we performed independent
component analysis (ICA) using MELODIC-FSL (31) on the concatenated
resting-state BOLD time series of 54 healthy subjects (median age = 51, 95%
confidence intervals: 28–76 y; males: 52%; low-pass filter: <0.1 Hz). ICA was set
to generate 20 components, which was the smallest number that enabled the
following eight well-characterized and robust RSNs (31) to be distinguished:
primary sensorimotor, attention control (salience, cingulo-opercular, or execu-
tive control), right dorsal frontoparietal (visuospatial), left frontotemporopar-
ietal (praxis), default mode, visual and auditory, and a cerebellar-brainstem
RSN. The top 0.1% component-weighted voxels—representing the anatomical
peaks of each healthy RSN—were used as masks to sample BOLD time series
from each of our test subjects. Sampled peaks did not overlap any patients’
acute lesions (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Within these masks, the mean
correlation coefficient across every voxel-pair time series was computed to
obtain a measure of functional network integrity, per subject, per RSN. Head
movement was quantified as rms error and framewise displacement of six
translational and rotational movement parameters.
Post-fMRI Tracking Task. Immediately after the resting-state FMRI block, sub-
jects performed tracking and force tasks in the scanner, similar to that described
in Tasks above. In this tracking version, only the paretic (or right hand in
controls) was tested, and only the slow, undistracted condition was used.
Combining subjects using different hands is justified from behavioral results of
the main study, showing that intersubject variation of tracking accuracy is
roughly sixfold larger than intrasubject between-hand accuracy variation (Fig.
1C). Active trials varied in length between 6 and 15 s, with rest intervals of 6–
15 s, over a 6.5-min epoch. Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of time
the crosshair overlay the target, excluding the first 2 s. Subjects were in-
troduced to, and practiced, the task for 2 min before the test session.
Functional integrity of the eight principle resting-state networks was
correlated against tracking and force accuracy, correcting for lesion volume
and age. Between-hand force differences were used to partial out the

 unilateral motor component from correlations of RSN integrity with absolute
performance in both tasks, given strong correlations between force and
tracking tasks in hand difference (r = 0.63; P < 0.001). To appreciate corre-
spondences between lesion anatomy and RSNs, we profiled patients’ lesions
in terms of volumes overlapping with anatomical ROIs (described in Voxel–
Lesion Function Mapping), and these values were cross-correlated with in-
tegrity of each of the principle RSNs. Correlations of RSN integrity with
performance, or anatomical-network overlap, were thresholded at P < 0.05,
corrected for multiple comparisons.
