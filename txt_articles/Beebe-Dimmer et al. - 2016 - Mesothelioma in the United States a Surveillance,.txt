Introduction: Mesothelioma is a rare malignancy typically associated with exposure to asbestos 
and poor survival. The purpose of this investigation was to describe mesothelioma patient char-
acteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival (OS) utilizing the National Cancer Institute’s 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database.
Materials and methods: Patients in this study were diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma 
of the pleura or peritoneum between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009 with follow-up 
for survival through December 31, 2010. We examined both patient and tumor characteristics 
at time of diagnosis and subsequent treatment patterns (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy). 
Among patients treated with chemotherapy, we determined chemotherapy regimen and OS by 
line of therapy.
Results: Of the 1,625 patients considered eligible for this investigation, the median age at 
diagnosis was 78 years. Nearly a third of patients (30%) had surgery as part of their treatment 
and 45% were given chemotherapy. The median OS was 8 months (range 1–69 months). Among 
chemotherapy patients, the most commonly (67%) prescribed regimen for first-line therapy was 
cisplatin or carboplatin (Ca/Ci) combined with pemetrexed (Pe). Among those prescribed Ca/
Ci + Pe as first-line therapy, retreatment with Ca/Ci + Pe (28%) or treatment with gemcitabine 
(30%) were the most common second-line therapies. Median OS for those receiving first-line 
chemotherapy was 7 months, and among those receiving second-line therapy median OS was 
extended an additional 5 months.
Conclusion: Irrespective of surgical resection, mesothelioma patients receiving some form 
of chemotherapy survived longer than patients who did not, with an additional survival benefit 
among those patients receiving multimodal treatment.
Keywords: mesothelioma, chemotherapy, epidemiology, outcomes, mortality, morbidity,

Introduction
Malignant mesothelioma is a rare malignancy of the membrane that covers many 
internal organs, but affects mainly the pleura of the lung. It may also arise in the 
peritoneum, and in extremely rare instances the testes or pericardium.1 Mesothelioma 
is often difficult to diagnose, which contributes to its poor prognosis; however, once 
the disease is diagnosed, it is uniformly lethal. Patients with malignant mesothelioma 
typically present with dyspnea, chest pain, and/or pleural effusion. While patients with

suspected malignant mesothelioma routinely undergo pleural 
biopsy to establish diagnosis, cytological examination of the 
pleural fluid is often nonconfirmatory, even in the presence 
of an occupational asbestos workplace history, the primary 
cause of mesothelioma.2 The “gold standard” for diagnosis 
of malignant mesothelioma is thoracoscopy.1 Similarly, 
endoscopic biopsies of other areas of the body where meso-
theliomas arise are used for confirmatory diagnoses.
About 3,000 new cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed in 
the US each year, more often in men, those aged 65 years and 
older, and whites.3 While the rate of mesothelioma increased 
between the 1970s through the 1990s, it is currently leveling 
off or even decreasing, likely due to changes in workplace 
exposure to asbestos beginning in the 1970s.4
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is the only mesothelioma 
with a formal staging system, with the American Joint Com-
mittee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) 
staging system most often used.5 While other staging systems 
have also been proposed,6 staging for mesothelioma is not a 
useful prognostic indicator. Cell subtypes, including epithe-
lial, sarcomatoid, and biphasic, are more useful. The epithelial 
subtype is the most common (50% of tumors) and has the 
most favorable prognosis.1 Other characteristics associated 
with prognosis include performance status, sex, age, white 
blood cell count, and platelet count.7
While the recommended treatment for malignant mesothe-
lioma is based on clinical stage and cell subtype,1 there is a lack 
of published population-based data describing routine treatment 
patterns for mesothelioma patients. Therefore, we assembled 
data from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER)–Medicare data files to report on initial therapies 
used for treatment of newly diagnosed mesothelioma and related 
overall survival (OS) among patients aged 66 years and older.
Materials and methods
The SEER–Medicare (http://healthservices.cancer.gov/
seermedicare/obtain/use.html) data set is a unique resource 
linking two population-based sources of data used to provide 
information about the experience of elderly patients with can-
cer in the US. The SEER program, sponsored by the National 
Cancer Institute, is a network of population-based cancer 
registries that routinely collects information on patients with 
a new diagnosis of invasive cancer, residing within one of 
the registry catchment areas. SEER is composed of 18 state-
wide or regional cancer registries, collecting data on patient 
demographics, tumor histology and pathology, first course 
of treatment, and OS. Through linking SEER registry data 
to Medicare enrollment and claims information for patients 
diagnosed in the SEER regions, the SEER–Medicare database 
provides additional information on treatment and outcomes 
of approximately 25% of elderly patients diagnosed with 
cancer in the US.8
Patients eligible for inclusion in this study were aged 66 
years and older at the time of diagnosis of primary malignant 
mesothelioma of the pleura (C38.4), lung (C34–34.9), or 
peritoneum, including omentum and mesentery (C48–48.9) 
(International Classification of Diseases from Oncology, 
third edition) between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 
2009, captured among one of 16 SEER registries (Connecti-
cut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, rural Georgia, Detroit, 
Seattle–Puget Sounds, Los Angeles, San Jose–Monterey, San 
Francisco–Oakland, greater California, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
and New Jersey). Patients captured in the specialized popula-
tion registries (Alaska Native Tumor Registry and Arizona 
Indians) are not included in SEER–Medicare. Patients aged 
66 years and older were selected in an effort to document the 
presence of any comorbid conditions (summarized using a 
modified Charlson Comorbidity Index) in the 12 months prior 
to diagnosis. Patients not continuously enrolled in both Part 
A and Part B Medicare from 12 months prior to diagnosis 
until death or December 31, 2010 were excluded, in an effort 
both to minimize misclassification of treatment regimen 
and to estimate a comorbidity index at the time of diagno-
sis. Patients who were members of a health maintenance 
organization at any point during this same period were also 
excluded, to avoid the potential for missing information due to 
claims not processed through Medicare. Additional exclusion 
criteria were 1) diagnosis from death certificate or autopsy 
only (n=63), 2) diagnosis not microscopically confirmed 
(n=189), 3) eligibility for Medicare not age related (n=203), 
4) year of birth or death from SEER and Medicare not well 
matched or missing month of diagnosis (n=39), 5) unknown 
or unconfirmed surgery (n=60), and 6) chemotherapy given, 
but agent not documented (n=47). Based upon these criteria, a 
total of 1,625 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study.
All treatments within the first month of diagnosis until death 
or end of the study were captured using Medicare claim data 
using relevant Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 diagnosis, and 
procedure and surgical codes. The most commonly adminis-
tered chemotherapy agents were cisplatin (Ci), carboplatin 
(Ca), pemetrexed (Pe), and gemcitabine, with vinorelbine less 
frequently used. These different agents were either combined 
or administered singularly and were summarized according to 
line of therapy. We combined use of either Ci or Ca into one 
line of therapy (as both are platinum-based chemotherapies), 
and these agents may or may not have been combined with Pe. 
A second-line therapy was identified, based on the presence of

additional claim data indicating chemotherapy beyond the first 
prescribed regimen with a gap of at least 3 months postconclu-
sion of first-line therapy. Surgery was considered therapeutic if 
it was performed within 9 months of diagnosis and palliative 
when performed more than 9 months after diagnosis. For the 
purposes of this study, only therapeutic surgery was consid-
ered in estimating differences in OS among different patient 
groups. The study was reviewed by the Wayne State University 
institutional review board and was granted a concurrence of 
exemption. Individual patient consent is not deemed necces-
sary by the institutional review board as only grouped data with 
more than 10 individuals represented in the group is presented.
Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The distribution of patient 
demographic (age at diagnosis, race, sex, SEER region, marital 
status, census-tract level of education and income relative to the 
poverty line) and clinical (primary site, histology, AJCC stage, 
and comorbidities at time of diagnosis) characteristics were 
determined among all patients and then stratified by receipt of 
chemotherapy. Among chemotherapy users, we determined the 
proportion of patients receiving the most common regimens 
(Ca or Ci) combined with Pe, and Pe only, and all other che-
motherapy regimens were combined to form the last group. 
As Ca or Ci with Pe was by far the most common first-line 
therapy administered, we also determined the distribution 
of  
second-line chemotherapy regimens among patients first 
receiving any platinum-based chemotherapy with Pe.
The primary outcome was OS. Median OS time and the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of these patients were calculated 
for two follow-up periods with two respective starting dates. 
The first follow-up was from the date of diagnosis to the 
date of death (using death information provided in  
Medicare 
records) or censored on December 31, 2010, the end of 
 
follow-up, whichever came first. The second follow-up was 
from the date of the start of the specific chemotherapy treat-
ment line (either first-line therapy or second-line therapy) 
to the date of death (using death information provided in 
 
Medicare records) or censored on December 31, 2010, or the 
end of follow-up, whichever came first. Median OS was deter-
mined from the start of first or second lines of  
chemotherapy, 
in order to provide context to survival rates reported in clini-
cal trials for therapies targeted for either first- or second-line 
chemotherapy. In calculating 1-year survival, patients were 
censored at death, at 12 months postdiagnosis, or December 
31, 2010, whichever came first. The proportion of patients 
surviving 1 year, as well as the associated 95% CI, was cal-
culated, using Kaplan–Meier models, by elected treatment.

Mesothelioma in the United States
among patients was 78 years (range 66–103 years). The 
majority of patients were white (91.9%), male (78%), and 
married at the time of diagnosis (62.4%). The greatest 
proportion of cases lived within the greater California and 
New Jersey SEER registries. Some form of chemotherapy 
was administered to 727 (44.7%) of patients, and those 
receiving chemotherapy were significantly younger at time 
of diagnosis, white, married, and living in higher-education 
and -income census tracts. Approximately 45% of patients 
had one or more comorbidities identified in the 12 months 
prior to diagnosis. Expectedly, the majority of patients were 
diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma (94.2%), 
with an epithelial histology (30.6%), and AJCC stage IV 
disease (29.1%). Patients receiving chemotherapy were more 
likely than those not receiving chemotherapy to have been 
diagnosed with AJCC stage II, III, or IV disease (71.3%), and 
less likely to have comorbid conditions compared to patients 
not receiving any chemotherapy. Mesothelioma clinical 
characteristics were also strongly predictive of multimodal 
treatment (chemotherapy and therapeutic surgery).
Sixty-six percent of patients received one line of 
chemotherapy, 24% two lines of therapy, and 11% more 
than two lines (Table 2). The most common first-line 
 
chemotherapy administered to malignant-mesothelioma 
patients in this study was a platinum-based agent coupled 
with Pe (67.4%), and among these patients, approximately 
18% received maintenance treatment with Pe. The second 
most common first-line chemotherapy was Pe only (22%), 
followed by 10.5% of patients receiving treatment with 
another agent. Among those receiving second-line therapy, 
almost 30% were treated with gemcitabine, while 28.1% were 
retreated with a platinum-based agent with Pe. Thirty-four 
percent of patients receiving chemotherapy also had surgery, 
and this proportion was similar for patients receiving first-line 
or second-line therapy regimens.
Median OS among patients receiving any chemotherapy 
was 12 months (range 1–69 months) and 4 months (range 
1–69 months) among patients who did not receive che-
motherapy (Table 3). Median OS was 16 months (range 
4–56 months) among patients having both surgery and

receiving more than one line of chemotherapy. The median 
OS after administration of first-line therapy was 7 months 
overall (range 1–68 months) and was extended an addi-
tional 5 months (range 1–33 months) postadministration of 
 
second-line therapy. Median OS among patients considered 
on maintenance therapy with Pe after treatment with a 
platinum-based agent plus Pe was 12 months postdiagnosis. 
Patients retreated with Pe only or Pe coupled with Ca or Ci 
survived an additional median 9 months posttreatment.
One-year OS was 48% (95% CI 45%–52%) among 
patients who received chemotherapy and 17% (95% CI 
15%–20%) among those who did not receive chemotherapy. 
One-year OS was 61% (95% CI 55%–67%) among patients 
receiving surgery and chemotherapy and 42% (37%–46%) 
among those receiving chemotherapy without surgery. 
Median OS was similar for men and women (7 months in 
men vs 8 months in women).
Discussion
This study provides a current view of the descriptive epide-
miology of malignant mesothelioma in a population-based 
sample of US males and females over age 65 years, and 
provides a description of the patterns of treatment and OS. 
The most common chemotherapy used was a platinum-based 
agent (Ci or Ca) coupled with Pe, which is consistent with 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.9 OS 
was greater for people who got chemotherapy than for people 
who were not given chemotherapy, and greatest among those 
who got chemotherapy and surgery. However, we are cautious 
in the interpretation of this finding, because the observational 
nature of this study makes it difficult to attribute differences 
in survival to regimen alone and may be explained by other 
patient-related factors. This is particularly apparent if com-
paring median OS among those patients receiving different 
lines of chemotherapy. Patients receiving two or more lines 
of chemotherapy had to have survived longer than patients 
receiving one line of chemotherapy in order to have received 
their second line of chemotherapy, thus leading to a survivor 
bias in these types of comparisons.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first population-based 
studies of treatment patterns for mesothelioma describing the 
impact of treatment on OS. It is also one of the largest studies, 
with over 1,600 patients. Previous clinical trials of mesothe-
lioma have included up to only a few hundred patients,10 typi-
cally derived from a single clinical center or a small geographic 
region. Three prior studies using SEER data only evaluated 
the influence of surgery on OS in mesothelioma patients, two 
of which suggested that cancer-directed surgery improved OS 
for patients with epithelioid histology, but not other histolo-
gies.11,12 The third13 examined the impact of cancer-directed 
surgery by race and observed similar survival for both black 
and white patients. None of the previous studies considered 
chemotherapy usage in their analyses. We also established 
that surgery is associated with improved OS, and that chemo-
therapy modified the effects of surgery. However, it is difficult 
to attribute confidently the improvement to the surgery itself, 
in that healthier patients make better surgical candidates.
In our study, we found that patients who received first-line 
chemotherapy lived about 7 more months after the receipt of 
their chemotherapy. Similarly, patients who received second-
line chemotherapy lived about 5 additional months. A recent 
systematic review by Blomberg et al14 of Phase II and Phase 
III randomized studies between systemic medical treatments or 
between systemic medical treatments and best supportive care 
(BSC) identified eight studies and four abstracts with results for 
first-line therapy. Five studies15–19 demonstrated survival lasting 
slightly more than 1 year after first-line therapy. The longest

Mesothelioma in the United States
survival was seen by Kindler et al,16 who found that patients 
treated with gemcitabine/Ci plus bevacizumab survived on 
average for 15.6 months after therapy compared to 14.7 months 
for patients treated with only gemcitabine/Ci. Only one study20 
of cyclophosphamide, imidazole carboxamide, and adriamycin 
versus cyclophosphamide and adriamycin reported survival 
as low as ours (6.7 months after therapy versus 5.5 months). 
Two randomized trials evaluated survival in second-line 
therapy for mesothelioma.21,22 Buikhuisen et al21 saw that 
patients administered thalidomide and BSC (10.6 months) 
survived no longer than patients receiving only BSC (12.9 
months) after second-line therapy. Similar results were seen in 
a trial that looked at survival among patients receiving Pe and 
BSC (median survival 8.4 months) versus patients receiving 
BSC (median survival 9.7 months).22 Recently, results from 
the Mesothelioma Avastin Plus Pemetrexed-cisplatin Study 
(MAPS) study, a randomized trial of treatment with bevaci-
zumab in addition to Pe and Ci for patients who were not good 
surgical candidates, found that the addition of bevacizumab 
resulted in a significant improvement in survival, despite an 
increase cardiovascular-related side effects or events.23 It is 
not surprising that these trials demonstrated better survival 
than our real-world study. We were limited to studying only 
patients enrolled in Medicare whose average age was higher 
than the clinical trial patients. In addition, the clinical tri-
als only included patients with a good performance status, 
whereas we included all available patients in our study.
The data were derived from the SEER–Medicare linkage. 
SEER has a highly reliable system for identifying incident 
malignant tumors, and all diagnoses are histologically verified. 
The 18 SEER registries included in this analysis represent a 
wide range of regional registries, and are not limited to one 
location or to the patient population served by any single 
medical center. The patterns of mesothelioma incidence are 
believed to be representative of the patterns in the US popula-
tion. In addition, this study derives from recent clinical data 
(diagnosis in 2005–2009, with follow-up through 2010). This 
is probably reflective of current treatment patterns, because no 
new therapies for mesothelioma have been introduced since 
2010. In fact, our results closely follow current treatment 
guidelines.9 The linkage between SEER and Medicare data 
allowed us to ascertain comorbidity in the 12 months prior to 
diagnosis of mesothelioma, which is an advantage over other 
published studies. Comorbidity is not only a predictor of which 
treatment is given to patients diagnosed with mesothelioma, 
but it is also a predictor of survival as well. No other study of 
mesothelioma survival that we are aware of has investigated 
prediagnostic comorbidity. Unfortunately, one of the limita-
tions of the SEER–Medicare database is that chemotherapy 
dose is not completely captured from claims, so determining 
dose escalation for any of the chemotherapy regimens would 
be difficult. Likewise, retreatment with the same agent as 
opposed to maintenance treatment can only be established by 
looking at patterns of therapy, particularly examining duration 
of time between administrations of chemotherapy agents and 
comparing these patterns to current evidence-based guidelines 
on the standard of care of patients diagnosed with mesothe-
lioma. In conclusion, mesothelioma patients receiving some 
form of chemotherapy survived longer than patients who did 
not, regardless of surgery, with an additional survival benefit 
among those patients receiving multimodal treatment.
