Diet-derived microRNAs: unicorn or silver
bullet?
Kenneth W. Witwer1,2*
and Chen-Yu Zhang3
Abstract
In ancient lore, a bullet cast from silver is the only effective weapon against monsters. The uptake of active diet-derived
microRNAs (miRNAs) in consumers may be the silver bullet long sought after in nutrition and oral therapeutics. However,
the majority of scientists consider the transfer and regulation of consumer’s gene activity by these diet-derived miRNAs to
be a fantasy akin to spotting a unicorn. Nevertheless, groups like Dr. Chen-Yu Zhang’s lab in Nanjing University have
stockpiled breathtaking amounts of data to shoot down these naysayers. Meanwhile, Dr. Ken Witwer at John Hopkins has
steadfastly cautioned the field to beware of fallacies caused by contamination, technical artifacts, and confirmation bias.
Here, Dr. Witwer and Dr. Zhang share their realities of dietary miRNAs by answering five questions related to this
controversial field.

What is the best evidence available, pro and con,
for the significant uptake, distribution, and
clearance of exogenous miRNAs from animal or
plant sources that is of potential functional
relevance?
Ken Witwer answers
The best evidence to date pertaining to questions of
xenomiR uptake derives from transgenic animal studies.
In animal models, endogenous RNAs can be manipu-
lated, and exposures can be completely controlled and
monitored. In the first such study [1], miR-21 knockout
mice received a diet replete with miR-21 but showed no
evidence of substantial uptake. In another study, genetic-
ally modified mice were used to alter the exposure of
pups to miR-30b in milk [2]. No difference in miRNA
levels was observed in pups that received milk from
nursing animals with elevated versus normal levels of
miR-30b. As a third example, pups from two miRNA
knockout models (miR-375 and miR-200c/141) showed
no evidence of miRNA uptake from milk of wild-type ani-
mals despite high levels of miRNAs in milk [3]. Together,
these studies provide strong evidence against biologically
meaningful uptake of dietary xenomiRs by adults or pups,
even when conspecific miRNAs, miRNA-binding proteins,
and miRNA-protective vehicles such as lipid vesicles or
other particles are involved. It should be noted that al-
though the authors of these studies used sensitive and
ligation-independent
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction (qPCR) assays, it remains possible that low levels
of uptake occurred at or below the limits of detection.
However, any such uptake remained orders of magnitude
below commonly accepted copy number thresholds in the
cell [3–5].
In contrast, positive reports of uptake and function have
been marked by apparent artifact. An initially exciting and
influential report of plant MIR168a uptake and function
[6, 7] now appears to rest on data consistent with contam-
ination, not uptake [8]. Similarly, the reported function in
the initial study [6, 7]—regulation of a single gene in-
volved in cholesterol homeostasis—has been revealed as
artifactual, a misinterpretation owing to lack of a crucial
dietary control [9]. Elsewhere, highly efficient uptake of
MIR528 was reported in humans after ingestion of 3 l of
watermelon juice [10, 11], yet watermelon, a dicot, does
not encode the monocot-specific MIR528 [12]. The chal-
lenges of spurious detection and contamination in foreign
nucleic acid studies cannot be overstated [6, 7, 13–16] and
are not limited to cross-kingdom communication. For

 example, purported uptake of milk miRNAs by mammals
[17] could not be reproduced by a different laboratory
using the same samples [18]. To the extent that bona fide
detection of transferred dietary miRNAs occurs, there is
often a startling disconnection between the concentrations
observed in vivo (if they can be credited) and those used
in functional experiments. In a typical experimental
workflow, seeming detection of vastly subhormonal (e.g.,
attomolar) levels of xenomiRs in vivo are followed by non-
physiologic (e.g., nanomolar) transfection experiments
[19]. These levels are many orders of magnitude above
what could be reached in vivo [20]. Importantly, xenomiRs
do not appear to associate with the host regulatory
machinery [21–23]; thus, canonical function would not
occur even in the improbably event that otherwise
regulation-relevant levels could be reached.
Chen-Yu Zhang responds
The mobility of small RNA molecules (siRNAs and
miRNAs) from one species to another is a newly discov-
ered mechanism for cross-talk between different organ-
isms,
even
between
species
of
different
kingdoms.
Transfer of double-stranded siRNA has been frequently
reported to occur between closely interacting patho-
genic, parasitic, or symbiotic organisms [24–28]. Single-
stranded miRNA was also found to be transferred
between host and invader [29–31]. A highly debated
issue that has not yet been resolved convincingly is
whether there is the transfer of small RNAs between
complex organisms. To date, the best evidence for the
significant uptake and distribution of functional exogen-
ous miRNAs comes from the observation of plant
miRNA-mediated cross-kingdom regulation. In 2012, we
reported
a
previously
uncharacterized
phenomenon:
ingested plant miRNAs can pass through gastrointestinal
tract, enter the peripheral blood stream, accumulate in
tissues, and exert gene regulation in mammals [6, 7].
Our follow-up study further showed a kinetic absorption
curve of dietary plant miRNAs: when volunteers are fed
watermelon juice and mixed fruits, six out of 16 selected
miRNAs showed a dynamic physiological pattern in their
plasma with an absorption rate of 0.04 to 1.31%; the
levels of dietary plant miRNAs peaked within 3–6 h after
intake in serum and tissues [10, 11].
Independent studies have provided the evidence both for
and against the dietary miRNA uptake by mammals. Two
studies reported little or low measurable uptake of plant
miRNAs by PCR in human and primates after a plant food-
feeding study [1, 16]. Dickenson et al. attempted to validate
our original research but found little dietary uptake of
miR168a or downregulation of LDLRAP1 by miR168a after
rice feeding [9]. For the contradictory detection of plant
miRNA uptake from the diet, we have emphasized several
critical issues to be carefully considered, such as the
selection of proper miRNAs, accurate normalization, suit-
able RNA isolation method, and minimized sequencing bias
(for more details, see our replies) [10, 11, 32]. On the other
hand, some evidence suggest dietary miRNA is a real
physiological phenomenon. A group showed that dietary
miRNA can survive for 36 h or longer in tissues; specific-
ally, the level of MIR172 was approximately 4.5–0.4% (2–
24 h after feeding) in the stomach, 2.4–0.2% (2–36 h) in the
intestines, 1.3–0.2% (2–72 h) in the blood, and 0.38–0.04%
(2–72 h) in the spleen [33]. Beatty et al. [34] identified
abundant nonhuman small RNA sequences derived from
dietary plant material in plasma and exosomal fraction.
Yang et al. [21–23] were able to detect MIR2911 and
MIR168a from the sera of mice fed a chow diet containing
honeysuckle and synthetic MIR168a. The plant miRNA
levels decreased to background levels after the honeysuckle
diet was replaced with a normal chow diet, proving that the
detected miRNAs are absorbed from food. Further works
by Yang et al. [21–23, 35, 36] suggested that MIR2911
exhibited
unusual
stability,
was
not
associated
with
exosomes or the Argonaute complex during circulation,
and had the stability which may be conferred by modifica-
tions from the host.
Meanwhile, some experimental results have provided dir-
ect evidence for the active function of dietary plant miRNA
in animal consumers in multiple areas, including metabol-
ism, viral infection, immune responses and cancer. Our
follow-up study showed that MIR2911 from a honeysuckle
decoction has an anti-viral effect against influenza A viruses
including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 (Zhou [37]). Chin et al.
reported that plant MIR159 was predominantly detected in
Western human sera, with the abundance of this miRNA
in the serum being inversely correlated with breast cancer
incidence and progression in patients; they further showed
that oral administration of a MIR159 mimicked signifi-
cantly suppressed the growth of xenograft breast tumors in
mice by targeting TCF7 [19]. Mlotshwa et al. [38] showed
that oral administration of tumor suppressor miRNAs re-
duced tumor burden in a mouse colon cancer model, sug-
gesting that engineered plant-expressing artificial miRNAs
can be used as dietary miRNA drugs to treat human can-
cers. Interestingly, food-derived plant miRNA could also
function in recipient cells in a sequence-independent man-
ner: evidence showed plant miRNA could dampen inflam-
mation by binding to toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) of
dendritic cells [39].
The studies of animal miRNA uptake also meet various
challenges. While plant miRNAs in animals can be accur-
ately
measured
because
of
the
sequence
difference
between plant and animal miRNAs and the specific 2′-O-
methylation in the 3′ ends of plant miRNAs, animal miR-
NAs derived from food are more difficult to measure
because of the high sequence conservation that obscures
differences between dietary and endogenous miRNAs.
Witwer and Zhang Genes & Nutrition  (2017) 12:15

 Baier et al. [17] first showed that humans absorb biologic-
ally meaningful amounts of miRNAs from nutritionally
relevant doses of cow’s milk. However, some follow-up
studies obtained contradictory results. For example, Snow
et al. [1] conducted several experiments on miR-21 null
mice but were unable to detect robust level of dietary
miR-21 in mice consuming miR-21. One explanation here
is the possible selective absorption of dietary miRNAs by
mice. The sequence, nucleotide composition, modifica-
tion,
packaging,
and
protein
association
of
dietary
miRNAs all contribute to the efficacy of uptake, yet the
exact mechanisms are still unclear. For example, intrinsic
stability conferred by the nucleotide sequence and com-
position can determine dietary miRNA absorption. To our
knowledge, MIR2911 shows significant uptake because of
its unique sequence and high GC content, leading to high
stability. Disruption of the MIR2911 sequence by just two
GC nucleotides abolishes its stability and absorption
(Zhou [37]). The structures that miRNAs packed in may
be also responsible for selective dietary miRNA absorp-
tion. Thus, miRNA abundance is not the sole determinant
of dietary miRNA uptake, and certain miRNAs enriched
in food may remain undetectable. Because the possible se-
lective absorption of dietary miRNA, randomly picking
one or two plant miRNA to measure the dietary miRNA
uptake in animal is highly risky. Exactly what sequence ar-
rangement or nucleotide composition may be accessible?
What type of miRNA modifications could produce high
efficacy of uptake and functionality of dietary miRNAs?
These issues still remain to be addressed in the future.
Ken Witwer concludes
While the Zhang group’s astute summaries, above, of
their previous claims and those of several others are
helpful and appreciated, they do not address my points
or other critiques in the peer-reviewed literature ques-
tioning the methodology and conclusions of these stud-
ies. The link of putative MIR168a uptake to LDL levels
[6, 7] has been refuted at the level of RNA uptake [1, 9,
16] and function [9], with the initial results attributed to
sequencing artifact [8]. The reportedly efficient uptake
of a specific miRNA from watermelon [10, 11]—a
miRNA that apparently does not exist in watermelon
[12]—raises questions about the interpretation and reli-
ability of that feeding study. The finding that MIR2911
is not a microRNA and does not associate with miRNA-
related regulatory machinery [21–23] suggests that ef-
fects attributed to this sequence [40] may be anomalous
phenomena that on the one hand may be worthy of
follow-up but on the other have no obvious relationship
to canonical miRNA mechanisms. The quadrillion-fold
difference between observed circulating levels of the
xenomiR MIR159a and experimental dietary exposure
[19]
highlights
the
experimental
gap
between
the
“dream” and “reality” (to borrow language from a recent
review [14]) of xenomiR-mediated regulation, which I
cover in Question 2, below. Finally, while one study [38]
claimed validation of the Zhang results, on closer exam-
ination, it did not. In this study, xenomiR levels in circu-
lation were not monitored; uptake into tissue was not
demonstrated directly; the relative levels of foreign and
endogenous miRNAs were not compared; only one in
three gavaged miRNAs could be detected in gut contents
after a single wash; well-known targets of the suppressor
miRNAs were not measured; there were no controls for
individual miRNA exposure; and effects on innate im-
mune mechanisms (including Toll-like receptor activa-
tion [41]) were not monitored. The milk feeding results
of Baier et al. [17] could not be confirmed in a replica-
tion study [18] using the same samples or even—impor-
tantly—in analysis of sequencing data from the same
group [18]. In none of the negative studies that now
challenge the xenomiR function hypothesis were one or
two miRNAs picked at random, as the Zhang group sug-
gests. Instead, study design focused on the same miR-
NAs that had previously been reported as absorbed and/
or functional. Rather than shifting the goalposts—-
whether from miRNAs to ribosomal fragments or other
non-coding RNAs or from general uptake to hypothet-
ical sequence-specific mechanisms—we should first con-
centrate
on
independent
replication
of
the
basic
observations. Of course, this has been done, with nega-
tive results. Even as I finalized this conclusion, yet an-
other investigation of multiple datasets from multiple
organisms emerged [42], in which the two most widely
mapped plant xenomiR sequences were members of the
MIR168 and MIR156 families, yet, curiously, MIR168a
was found even in single-celled organisms from lab cul-
tures that were not exposed to plants [42], confirming
the repeated observations [6–8] that detection of this se-
quence in foreign organisms is artifactual. Evidence was
also presented for the artifactual nature of MIR156 de-
tection [42]. These outcomes are disappointing to all of
us who were or are enthused by the xenomiR hypoth-
esis, but we ultimately must follow the data.
What are the gaps in experimental functional
studies of exogenous miRNA and the most
significant challenges to addressing them
successfully?
Chen-Yu Zhang answers
There are two types of “exogenous miRNAs,” including
absorbed dietary miRNAs and endogenous miRNAs se-
creted by animal tissues (to the recipient cell/tissue, those
secreted miRNAs are “exogenous”). It is important to
emphasize our working model of exogenous dietary
miRNA in adult animal that free dietary miRNAs are
absorbed by epithelial cells in the GI tract where those
Witwer and Zhang Genes & Nutrition  (2017) 12:15 
Page 3 of 10
 dietary miRNAs are then packaged into exosomes and re-
leased via exocytosis. Consequently, exosome-encapsulated
dietary miRNAs are delivered into recipient cell/tissue
where they block the expression of target genes in a work-
ing manner of endogenous secreted miRNA. Actually, the
functional studies of cross-kingdom regulation of dietary
miRNA are technically quite simple to performance both
in vitro and in vivo, and many groups have already con-
firmed
it
independently.
Moreover,
the
detection
of
absorbed dietary miRNA is also preformed and successfully
detected by many groups independently.
Therefore, the gaps in experimental functional studies
of exogenous dietary miRNA are to understand the
mechanism of absorption and to appreciate the robust
biological activity caused by such low level of secreted
miRNA (including endogenous secreted miRNA and
absorbed dietary miRNA). The most significant chal-
lenge to address them successfully is to figure out the
mechanism of absorption of dietary miRNA (indeed, we
have already identified a membrane transporter to up-
take mature miRNA). It is also helpful to understand the
whole picture of exogenous miRNA by further studying
the mechanisms of exosome packaging, secretion, and
function in recipient cell.
Ken Witwer responds
One important gap in our understanding, as Dr. Zhang as-
tutely intimates, is the gap between observation and ex-
perimentation,
which
I
also
mentioned
above.
For
example, in one rodent feeding experiment, animals were
fed with small RNAs at a level approximately 16 orders of
magnitude above what was initially detected in vivo [19]
(for more discussion, see [20]). That such massively
disproportionate amounts of xenomiRs are needed to
observe effects on biology effectively refutes xenomiR
functionality. It should be incumbent on those who
impute function to miRNAs at vastly subhormonal
concentrations to demonstrate how such action could
occur in physiological systems.
Another gap is what I would call the packaging problem:
There seems to be an assumption in much of the xenomiR
literature
that
mature
xenomiRs
float
about
freely
(whether in or outside extracellular vesicles (EVs)), enter
cells (via transporters or promiscuous EV cell fusion), and
readily integrate into host Argonautes (AGOs)/RNA-in-
duced silencing complexes (RISCs) to regulate endogen-
ous transcripts. But do free small RNAs exist in biological
systems? The mature, single-stranded siRNA is made after
being loaded in double-stranded precursor form into
AGO and does not appear to transfer between AGOs [43].
A free, single-stranded small RNA is “dead”: subject to im-
mediate degradation in vivo [44] and divorced from
effector proteins including AGO. How would a plant
xenomiR survive the mammalian system if parted from its
AGO? Or, if still protected by plant AGO, how would it
be imported into the cell as a complex and plugged into a
foreign RISC? To be sure, massive molar excess might
yield results. At micromolar concentration, synthetic RNA
can be taken up into some cells through a process known
as gymnosis [45]. Excess exogenous single-stranded small
RNAs might even bind to non-AGO proteins or be
incorporated into AGO. But now, we are back to the con-
centration gap between controlled experimental possibil-
ities on the one hand and biological reality on the other.
The packaging issue is addressed in greater depth
elsewhere [5].
Chen-Yu Zhang concludes
As I have mentioned above that the mechanism of diet-
ary small RNA absorption is a critical issue to under-
stand our observation. Our recent transporter study
(mentioned above, paper under review) supports the
working model that dietary single-strand microRNA is
absorbed by epithelial cells in the mammalian GI tract
and then is packaged into exosomes, importantly, with
host cell RISC complex. At this stage, the absorbed diet-
ary microRNA is already became “endogenous secreted
microRNA”
[6,
7,
10,
11,
40]!
Our
study
has
demonstrated that exogenous circulating plant micro-
RNAs are generally enriched in mammalian cell exo-
some [6, 7, 10, 11, 37, 40]. On the other hand, it seems
to me that Dr. Witwer confused the absorption rate of
synthetic small RNA to that of natural plant microRNA
in food. In fact, we have clearly pointed that the absorp-
tion rate of synthetic microRNAs through mouse GI
tract is much less than that of natural food microRNAs
(MIR-168, 4000 times; MIR-2911, 1800 times, respect-
ively ([6, 7, 10, 11], Zhou [37]). Moreover, we and other
groups have reported that recovery rates of certain
dietary microRNAs in the blood are from 0.04 to 1.31%
([6, 7, 10, 11], Zhou [37]) and 1.3% [34]. It is for sure
that mechanism underneath different absorption of syn-
thetic microRNA and natural dietary small RNA re-
quires further study.
What evidence, pro and con, is available for
indirect health effects in humans of exogenous
miRNA, e.g., on the human gastrointestinal
microbiome?
Ken Witwer answers
To my knowledge, no published studies to date have dem-
onstrated an effect of dietary xenomiRs on human health,
whether directly or indirectly through modulation of
gastrointestinal microbes. However, there is evidence that
dietary nucleic acids in general affect the gastrointestinal
microbiome as a source of nutrition that may be exploited
to varying extents by different microbial communities
[46]. In the mammalian gut, nucleases, proteases, and
Witwer and Zhang Genes & Nutrition  (2017) 12:15 
Page 4 of 10
 lipases act to break down nucleic acids as well as proteins
and lipids that might otherwise protect DNA or RNA.
Phosphatases and nucleosidases convert nucleotides into
nucleosides and bases (purines and pyrimidines). These
breakdown products are then imported by enterocytes:
nucleotides can be recycled directly, while other products
enter salvage pathways. The same products are also used
by bacteria. Nucleotides in food sources have been found
to promote growth of “beneficial” bacteria such as
Bifidobacterium both in vivo [47] and in vitro [48]. It is
thus not surprising that a large influx of foreign nucleic
acids would stimulate growth of microbial communities,
whether in the gut [47] or in soil [48]. It remains
incompletely understood why different bacteria, e.g.,
Bifidobacteria, appear to respond differently to environ-
mental nucleic acid breakdown products.
The effects of exogenous nucleic acids on microbes ap-
pear to be chiefly nutritional, not informational. There is
no evidence that defined foreign nucleic acid sequences,
such as those of individual xenomiRs, have specific, direct
effects on the microbiome. To be sure, the authors of one
recent publication [47] have advanced the hypothesis that
host miRNAs (not xenomiRs) affect microbes directly.
This is an intriguing concept, since the host-microbe
interaction would be subject to relevant co-evolutionary
pressures. Several lines of evidence were presented for
miRNAs affecting microbes [47]. Alternative interpreta-
tions are possible, though. Knocking out all miRNA pro-
duction in the gut, as was done [47], may have effects on
gut physiology that might explain the reported findings.
As we have seen above, adding large quantities of RNA to
bacteria, as was also done, has non-specific nutritional
effects. Finally, it is unclear that the reported effects would
be achieved at physiologic, dietary concentrations of
nucleic acids. Even gavaged, chemically modified miRNAs
are wasted on animal model studies, as they are either
undetectable or variably detected just above background
even after 30 days of gavage at quadrillions of copies per
day [38]. Much more work would be needed to interrogate
possible functional uptake of xenomiRs by microbes.
Happily, since this field is only in its infancy, its practi-
tioners will have the opportunity to avoid pitfalls from
mammalian miRNA studies, including drastically nonphy-
siologic and improperly controlled experiments [20].
Chen-Yu Zhang responds
Indeed, investigation of the uptake and functions of diet-
ary exogenous miRNAs is just at its infancy. Recent stud-
ies suggest that dietary plant miRNAs have a functional
impact on consumer organisms in a cross-kingdom man-
ner. We first showed that food-derived MIR168a can bind
to target gene LDLRAP1 and reduce its expression, lead-
ing to elevation of mouse blood LDL levels. Our follow-up
study identified MIR2911, a honeysuckle-encoded atypical
miRNA, as the most stable miRNA in honeysuckle decoc-
tion. Since honeysuckle is a well-known Chinese herb
used for the treatment of influenza A virus infection, we
showed that MIR2911 in the honeysuckle decoction dir-
ectly suppressed various influenza A viruses, including
H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 both in vitro and in vivo (Zhou
[37]). Chin et al. [19] found that Western women sera
contained plant MIR159 and that its abundance was in-
versely correlated with the incidence and progression of
breast cancer in patients. They further showed that oral
administration of a MIR159 mimicked significantly sup-
pressed the growth of xenograft breast tumors in mice by
targeting TCF7. Taking advantage of food-derived miRNA
as a new therapeutic strategy, Mlotshwa et al. [38] engi-
neered plants to express artificial tumor-suppressing
miRNAs for cancer treatment in a mouse model. Pastrello
et al. [49] confirmed the presence of plant miRNAs in
human blood and suggested that miRNAs cooperate
with other Brassica-specific compounds in a possible
cancer-preventive mechanism1. In addition, Cavalieri
et al. [39] found that plant miRNAs can serve as a novel
form of immunomodulatory agents. They showed that
plant miRNAs modify the capacity of dendritic cells to re-
spond to inflammatory agents by limiting T cell prolifera-
tion. This immunomodulatory effect was dependent
on plant miRNAs binding to TLR3 and impairing
TRIF signaling. This study indicates that exogenous
plant miRNAs may serve as a ligand and exert bio-
logical function at a relatively low concentration. In
the light of these findings, exogenous plant miRNAs
may also have indirect effects on human health from
many aspects.
Ken Witwer concludes
Since the response does not address the host microbiome
but instead repeats claims about other systemic functions
of xenomiRs on the host, I limit my conclusion to three
observations. First, as stated previously, MIR2911 is nei-
ther a miRNA nor honeysuckle-specific: it is a sequence
included in part or in whole in length-polymorphic frag-
mentation products of 26S ribosomal RNA, which is con-
served across the plant kingdom. There is no evidence
that honeysuckle contains more (or more potent) 26S
rRNA degradome sequences than potato, maize, night-
shade, and etc. Indeed, the sequence recognized by the
commercial “MIR2911” qPCR assay used by Zhou et al.
[40] differs by a nucleotide from the reported honeysuckle
sequence. Second, Mlotshwa et al. [38] did not feed mice
with plants engineered to express anti-tumor miRNAs, as
is
stated;
instead,
they
gavaged
large
quantities
of
synthetic, modified RNA in exposures that could not be
achieved through plant feeding, and with unclear results,
as mentioned above. Third, the qPCR detection method
of Pastrello et al. [49] could not have yielded meaningful
Witwer and Zhang Genes & Nutrition  (2017) 12:15 
Page 5 of 10
 results as reported, since the specified amplification
primers were designed to the same strand of the cDNA
reverse transcription product. Because of this and other
apparent problems that I and others have identified in
public
commentary
(see
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/27604570#cm27604570_30577 and https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604570#cm27604570_30673),
I would recommend that interpretation of this study be
withheld until the authors and editors have responded to
the post-publication critiques1.
Why the persistent interest on putative health
effects of exogenous miRNA?
Chen-Yu Zhang answers
There are three possible explanations: (1) People nor-
mally is in fear of new thing they have been unaware
or have not understood, especially if the new finding
is “extraordinary” or contradictory to the conventional
concept, for example, European people were afraid of
tomato
300
years
ago
when
tomato
was
firstly
imported from America; (2) the positive effect of diet-
ary miRNA has not been appreciated and advertised,
for example, plant miR2911 in honeysuckle soup can
directly shut down influenza viruses, including H1N1,
N5N1, and H7N1 in vivo; (3) people will appreciate
the finding of dietary miRNA absorption and cross-
kingdom regulation when they realize that we can
make a new type of “medical food” to treat various
diseases.
Ken Witwer responds
I agree completely with Dr. Zhang’s point number 1.
Interest in the putative health effects of xenomiRs
may indeed be rooted in part in fear of the unknown
or new discoveries. The idea of general dietary xeno-
miR function, despite having now been largely re-
futed, has been seized upon by some to question the
safety of biotechnological innovations such as targeted
crop engineering. Yet humans are exposed, with no
known consequence, to a great diversity of dietary
plant small RNAs with homology to human tran-
scripts [50], and even sequences engineered to target
an essential mammalian gene had no apparent effect
in rodent experiments [51]. These results strongly
support the safety of dietary RNA (but further contest
xenomiR functionality). Thus, on points 2 and 3, I
must respectfully disagree. MIR2911 is not a miRNA
but rather a length-polymorphic degradation fragment of
a ribosomal RNA found across the plant kingdom. No
longer classified as a miRNA by miRBase, MIR2911 is not
specific to honeysuckle and consists almost entirely of
guanines and cytosines, which may complicate accurate
detection and mapping and lead to aggregates that are
relatively resistant to degradation. The Hirschi lab has
reported that whatever the source of “MIR2911” qPCR
signal, it is not associated with AGO (20), or with EVs or
proteinase-K-sensitive complexes [35, 36]. Thus, it is diffi-
cult to credit the concept that MIR2911 could silence host
or viral transcripts through canonical RNA silencing, as
interesting as Dr. Zhang’s influenza data surely are.
In my view, interest in xenomiR function in health con-
tinues today mostly because the concept is so compelling,
fresh, and revolutionary—even if it is ultimately un-
founded. It is a concept we naturally want to prove. That
one of the most labile components in food (and who does
not love food?) could have drastic effects by communicat-
ing with the body, at practically homeopathic levels,
explaining why some foods are better than others, is truly
a fascinating idea. Interest has been further bolstered by
real and perceived funding and entrepreneurial opportun-
ities: grant programs and opportunities from public
sources and also various industry funding groups that
sponsor research into the intriguing idea of “functional
food.” Finally, around the world, there is a financial inter-
est in scientifically underpinning so-called traditional or
complementary medicine remedies, which are typically
not regulated in the same way as pharmaceuticals and
thus may offer profit opportunities.
Chen-Yu Zhang concludes
Although Dr. Witwer and I both agree that putative
health effects of exogenous miRNA is not as serious
as some people suggested, we are considering from
different aspects. Dr. Witwer believes that absorption
of dietary microRNA is not real, and thus, it should not
effect on consumer, neither good nor bad. While I tend to
reap the benefit of this discovery, for example, we have
generated
RNAi
transgenic
lettuce
directly
against
hepatitis B virus (HBV), and initial results have shown that
HBV-positive patients drunk the juice of this lettuce
displayed significantly decreased levels of virus DNA titer
and HbsAg (paper in revision).
One more issue I need to clarify clearly: The dietary
microRNA we are discussing represents all types of ex-
ogenous small non-coding RNA. MIR2911 is certainly
not a classic microRNA. However, its function is same
to that of the endogenous animal microRNA in host cell
(Zhou [37]). There are many reports that exogenous
small non-coding RNA (not classic microRNA) func-
tions as endogenous microRNA and plays important role
in host cells We have also found that a Salmonella-
encoded small RNA (70 nt) was processed to 21 nt RNA
fragment and this small RNA fragment inhibited NOSi
gene translation in mouse GI epithelial cells in a manner
of an endogenous microRNA (paper in press).
Taken together, the extracellular RNA communication
is a novel and important field which needs more investi-
gators to study.

 Dependence on various forms of self-reports of
dietary intake remains a serious challenge (due to
potential for measurement error) for many in the
field of nutrition, especially those seeking to
evaluate potential links between specific foods
and specified health outcomes. What is the
potential usefulness of microRNAs as biomarkers
of dietary intake (this could reflect endogenous
as well as exogenous microRNA) or of functional
responses to diet?
Ken Witwer responds
Hypothetical miRNA markers of dietary intake could be
endogenous or exogenous and would presumably be har-
vested from blood, urine, or feces. There is some evidence
that endogenous miRNAs in different bodily compart-
ments are modulated by dietary factors, such as glucose,
vitamins, trace elements, drugs, or simply intake of food
in general [52–54]. This modulation might occur through
miRNA regulation in cells and/or by differential release
from cells exposed to dietary components. Post-prandial
shifts of circulating lipid particle populations, for example,
would be reflected by miRNA if certain miRNAs were as-
sociated with specific lipoproteins. Specificity and timing
issues challenge the development of endogenous miRNA
markers of specific foods. First, miRNAs appear to be re-
sponsive to food components and breakdown products,
not specific foods. A glucose-sensitive miRNA, for ex-
ample, could not tell us if the donor ate an apple or used
creamer in her coffee. Second, it is unlikely that any en-
dogenous miRNA responds to dietary factors alone; abun-
dant miRNAs have been proposed as markers of a wide
variety of conditions and diseases but may be specific to
none of them [55]. Third, many abundant animal miRNAs
share 100% identity across species, such that endogenous
upregulation cannot be distinguished from influx of xeno-
miRs [56]. Fourth, the timing and design of sampling is
important. With a pre-prandial sample establishing a
baseline, a post-prandial sample should be taken within a
carefully established interval since RNAs are rapidly
cleared from circulation, with a half-life of minutes to tens
of minutes depending on protein and lipid associations.
An endogenous miRNA-based assay would be informative
just around the sampling window: unfortunately, this
when alternative metrics are least needed due to accurate
reporting of recent events or in-clinic monitoring pre-
and post-prandially. Taken together, endogenous miRNAs
may be found to act as reliable surrogate markers for
intake of classes of dietary substances. However, high-
performance blood assays are already available for these
substances.
Exogenous miRNAs—if they differ in sequence from en-
dogenous miRNAs—might offer a better opportunity for
detection of specific foods, albeit again within a short
period of time following intake. Although there is little
convincing evidence that nucleic acids are absorbed from
the diet in functionally relevant forms or amounts, and no
well-established mechanisms for such transfer, even trace
uptake could, theoretically, reveal dietary sources. But are
miRNAs the best candidates? The ideal nucleic acid
marker(s) would be stable, abundant, and information-
rich, including specificity to the food of interest. From a
stability perspective, the relative resistance of DNA to hy-
drolysis would recommend it over RNA, and ribonucleo-
protein (RNP) complexes over free RNA. However,
mechanisms for absorption of intact DNA and RNPs from
the diet are not known. The concept of abundance is re-
lated to stability: at a given degree of stability, the more
abundant molecule is more likely to survive the harsh trip
through the alimentary canal and thus be available for
hypothetical uptake. High copy number RNAs, such as
tRNAs or rRNAs, are abundant but also highly conserved,
requiring relatively large amounts of sequence to find dis-
criminatory differences. Messenger RNAs number in the
tens of thousands, are hundreds to thousands of bases
long, and often undergo alternative splicing. In compari-
son, circulating xenomiRs are disadvantaged as markers.
They are short (little information), highly conserved across
species and within kingdoms, and not particularly diverse
(only hundreds to thousands of predicted miRNAs per
species, with only a handful highly expressed in any given
cell type). A plant miRNA might reveal that a plant was
ingested, or even if it was a dicot or a monocot. However,
for many food items, complete atlases of miRNA se-
quences and expression levels are not yet reliable, nor do
we know how processing affects the availability of miR-
NAs in tissue; other than that it is quite variable. Proposed
species-specific miRNAs may be predicted in silico only,
have atypical precursor structures, and be disputed as
genuine miRNAs; in any case, the rule of thumb that con-
servation correlates with abundance suggests that low
copy number, species-specific miRNAs would be difficult
to detect. Assays sufficiently sensitive to detect rare plant
miRNAs would be expensive and prone to the pervasive
and confounding influence of contamination. Finally, dif-
ferent assays (or full sequencing) would be necessary to
identify different foods, making screening difficult and ex-
pensive compared with verification of a single food item.
In summary, body fluid miRNAs seem to be poorly
suited as markers of specific dietary intake. Circulating en-
dogenous miRNAs may serve as general nutrition indica-
tors but cannot discriminate between specific foods and
are unlikely to reveal dietary history for more than a few
hours. Endogenous miRNAs represent a drastically more
expensive and complicated alternative to existing metabol-
ite blood tests. In contrast, exogenous miRNAs may enter
the blood at very low, non-functional levels and could be
markers of recent intake of classes of foods such as plants
or even subcategories within the plant kingdom. However,
Witwer and Zhang Genes & Nutrition  (2017) 12:15 
Page 7 of 10
 other types of RNA (or DNA) are likely to be more in-
formative than short, highly conserved miRNAs. Research
programs focused on the uptake of xenomiRs as bio-
markers of dietary intake are based on false assumptions
and faulty studies and would be better channeled towards
improving subject monitoring or direct measurements of
food-specific factors in feces.
Chen-Yu Zhang responds
Although there is still no consensus on whether dietary
miRNA can be categorized as a biomarker of dietary in-
take to date, the potential of dietary miRNA as a nutri-
tional biomarker or biomarker of functional responses to
diet is beyond doubt. Philip et al. [57] confirmed that diet-
ary plant miRNAs are stably present in intact form after
storage, processing, cooking, and early digestion in vivo.
This study potentially indicates that dietary plant miRNAs
have a robustness that makes them bioavailable for being
used as a nutritional biomarker. Importantly, the correla-
tions between specific dietary plant miRNAs and specific
health outcomes have been established. We showed that
plant miRNA is correlated with blood LDL levels [6, 7].
Chin et al. [19] confirmed that plant MIR159 is inversely
correlated with breast cancer incidence and progression in
patients. Cavalieri et al. [39] reported that plant miRNAs
can serve as a novel form of immunomodulatory agents.
These studies may shed light in future research of dietary
miRNAs as new markers or components of nutrition.
For plant miRNAs serving as a biomarker of dietary
intake, although it has been shown that plasma from an
individual who reported following a vegetarian diet had
a relatively high proportion of plant sequences [34], it is
quite
difficult
to
determine
the
exact
plant
foods
consumed due to the conservation of miRNA sequences
among different plant species. Thus, miRNA can serve
as a biomarker of certain dietary state or health outcome
rather than a direct reflection of specific food intake.
Future studies in this area may screen dietary miRNAs
for biomarkers of healthy and unhealthy eating habits.
Ken Witwer concludes
Far from beyond doubt, dietary miRNAs as valid markers
of (1) intake or (2) functional effects may be contradicted
by the existing evidence and even the (albeit stimulating)
arguments provided above. For the first—intake—a useful
marker would reflect both the identity and dose of source
material. Yet my interlocutors agree that the sequence
conservation of miRNAs is incompatible with discrimin-
ation of specific food sources. Furthermore, they observe
that apparent dietary miRNA absorption is not dependent
on miRNA abundance in the source material. Indeed, in
their study [6, 7], only four plant miRNAs (all highly con-
served and abundant in plants) were detected in each of
ten samples (each sample pooled from ten humans), with
read counts varying from three to 28,000 [6, 7, 56]. Even if
these reads were not consistent with contamination, as
they are in [8], it is clear that with such tremendous vari-
ation, despite the moderating effects of pooling, they
could not be used to identify the type or amount of food
in the diet. For the second point—function—the Zhang
group presents two studies of putative function [6, 7, 19].
The LDL study [6, 7] had a curious result, since eating
raw plants is not usually associated with higher LDL
levels; indeed, a more completely controlled reproduction
study found that the increase was due to cholesterol
mobilization in a starvation state—raw rice is nutritionally
insufficient for rodents—not miRNA uptake or miRNA-
mediated gene regulation, which was not detected [9, 58].
The Chin et al. study focused on minute levels of a xeno-
miR in blood that were well below standard limits of de-
tection for miRNAs, including those used by the same
group in a previous study [59] (averaging less than three
copies per milliliter of blood). The very deep sequencing
that would be required to detect such low levels of
markers with confidence would be cost-prohibitive, not to
mention that the subsequent animal study introduced ex-
posure levels approximately 1015 times higher than what
was observed in patient blood. To conclude, there is insuffi-
cient evidence for circulating xenomiRs as markers of diet-
ary intake or response to diet. As previously stated, fecal
miRNAs could be extracted from undigested (and thus
unabsorbed) material, but other RNAs or DNA would
provide better discrimination of dietary components.
