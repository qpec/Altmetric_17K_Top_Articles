Abstract
Background: The prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic conditions continue to be challenging and costly to address
for health care systems; 71% of American adults were overweight, with 35% of men and 40% of women diagnosed with obesity
in 2014. Digital health coaching is an innovative approach to decreasing the barriers of cost and accessibility of receiving health
coaching for the prevention and management of chronic disease in overweight or obese individuals.
Objective: To evaluate the early impact of a mobile phone-based health coaching service on weight loss and blood pressure
management in a commercially insured population.
Methods: This was a retrospective study using existing registry data from a pilot commercial collaboration between Vida Health
and a large national insurance provider, which enrolled adult members who were overweight (body mass index >25 kg/m2) and
able to engage in a mobile phone-based coaching intervention. Participants received 4 months of intensive health coaching via
live video, phone, and text message through the Vida Health app. Participants were also provided with a wireless scale, pedometer,
and blood pressure cuff. Of the 1012 enrolled, 763 (75.40%) participants had an initial weight upon enrollment and final weight
between 3 and 5 months from enrollment; they served as our intervention group. There were 73 participants out of the 1012
(7.21%) who had weight data 4 months prior to and after Vida coaching, who served as the matched-pair control group.
Results: Participants in the intervention group lost an average of 3.23% total body weight (TBW) at 4 months of coaching and
28.6% (218/763) intervention participants achieved a clinically significant weight loss of 5% or more of TBW, with an average
of 9.46% weight loss in this cohort. In the matched-pair control group, participants gained on average 1.81% TBW in 4 months
without Vida coaching and lost, on average, 2.47% TBW after 4 months of Vida coaching, demonstrating a statistically significant
difference of 4.28% in mean percentage weight change (P<.001). Among 151 intervention participants with blood pressure data,
112 (74.2%) had a baseline blood pressure that was above the goal (systolic blood pressure >120 mmHg); 55 out of 112 (49.1%)
participants improved their blood pressure at 4 months by an entire hypertensive stage—as defined by the Seventh Report of the
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
Conclusions: Mobile phone app-based health coaching interventions can be an acceptable and effective means to promote
weight loss and improve blood pressure management in overweight or obese individuals. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones,

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic conditions
continue to be challenging and costly to address for health care
systems; 71% of American adults were overweight, with 35%
of men and 40% of women diagnosed with obesity in 2014
[1-5]. Being overweight and obese increases the risk of
cardiometabolic disease and overall mortality, with the
prevalence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes highly correlated
to increasing weight [6]. Weight loss as modest as 5% total
body weight in people with a body mass index (BMI) over 25
kg/m2 can significantly improve glycosylated hemoglobin, blood
pressure, and hyperlipidemia, and can reduce the progression
of hypertension and diabetes [7-9]. The United States Preventive
Task Force recently updated its recommendations to formally
include intensive, multicomponent interventions for weight loss
in patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, citing evidence showing its
benefits in cardiovascular risk reduction [10].
With primary care clinicians in increasingly short supply and
overwhelmed by burdens of the preventative and chronic care
needs of their patient panel [11,12], numerous health care
providers have sought to use trained health coaches to provide
cost-effective, culturally sensitive behavioral counseling for
weight loss and chronic disease management. There is
compelling evidence that health coach-led programs can indeed
significantly improve the control of metabolic risk factors
[13-15]. Despite provisions in the US Affordable Care Act of
mandated free obesity counseling to those who qualify and
availability of robust evidence around behavior change programs
for weight loss, uptake of behavioral-counseling weight loss
programs has been limited. This is often due to difficulties with
attending 
in-person 
sessions—offered 
by 
most
programs—caused 
by 
wide-ranging 
issues 
such 
as
transportation, childcare, work coverage, and limited availability
of such programs, especially in rural settings [16].
In addition to decreasing the barriers of cost and accessibility
for receiving health coaching, digital health coaching provided
remotely through an Internet-connected device has been shown
to be an effective approach for the prevention and management
of cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and diabetic
individuals [17,18]. Given that 92% of US adults own a
basic-feature mobile phone and 68% own an advanced-feature
mobile phone (ie, iPhone or Android) [19], mobile devices may
offer a novel continuous engagement portal for delivery of health
coaching and intensive behavioral interventions for weight loss
[20]. In addition to containing an array of sensors relevant to
core aspects of behavior change programs (eg, pedometers to
track steps, cameras to record food intake, audio and live video
to communicate with a health coach), the vast majority of mobile
phones are carried by users for the majority of their waking day,
with users engaging with apps on their mobile devices for 3
hours and 5 minutes per day, on average [21].
While studies of Web- [17,18] and short message service (SMS)
text message-based [22,23] coaching interventions have
demonstrated positive results, the few number of studies
examining mobile phone-based health coaching are limited
either by sample size, a focus on the impact of self-monitoring
rather than coaching, or a lack of clinical results beyond
self-reported weight loss [24,25]. Thus, given the limited
published research to date evaluating mobile phone-based
coaching interventions for weight loss and cardiovascular risk
reduction, the authors share here retrospective registry data from
a pilot, commercial, mobile phone-based health-coaching
program. The program was offered by a large national
commercial insurance company to its fully insured members in
the US states of Wisconsin, Georgia, and Colorado who were
overweight and self-reported diagnoses of obesity, hypertension,
prediabetes, dyslipidemia, or diabetes.
Methods
Overview
This was a retrospective study using existing registry data from
a pilot commercial collaboration between Vida Health and a
large insurance provider. Interested members under this
insurance provider were enrolled starting in November 2015 in
a commercial program using a mobile phone-based, digital
health-coaching app, Vida Health (described below). The
coaching platform was used to manage cardiometabolic
conditions such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
prediabetes. This study has received Institutional Review Board
(IRB) exemption from the University of California, San
Francisco (UCSF), IRB (IRB No. 16-19903).
Participants
The registry included adults over the age of 18 years who were
fully insured members in the US states of Wisconsin, Georgia,
and Colorado and who were overweight—BMI >25 kg/m2.
Participants had to be English speaking and own an
advanced-feature mobile phone—iPhone or Android—to ensure
they were able to engage in the Vida Health coaching program.
Participants were recruited from an email campaign by their
insurance provider offering the free program for any current
member who had a BMI >25 kg/m2. In order not to bias the
sample with individuals who would have achieved weight loss
and other health goals regardless of whether or not they worked
with a coach, the barrier to entry into the program was kept at
a minimum—simply replying to a Web form in an email
invite—with minimal exclusion criteria, including not owning

 a mobile phone and having type 1 diabetes. Clinical data
elements used for enrollment, including weight, height, and
medical history, were based on self-reported responses.
Invitations to the program were sent randomly to members in
eligible geographies and the first 1000 participants were included
in this pilot program.
Intervention
Enrollment for the Vida Health program started November 2015.
Prior to starting the Vida Health program, accepted members
were sent a package containing a Bluetooth-connected
pedometer and wireless scale. Those members with known
hypertension also received a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure
cuff. Participants received instructions on how to synchronize
their wireless devices for passive data collection through the
Vida app.
After installing the Vida app, participants were asked to
complete an onboarding survey regarding their baseline health
behaviors, past medical history, self-selected personality
preferences (ie, if they might benefit more from a “cheerleader”-
or “drill sergeant”-like coach), and general availability. Based
on these attributes, participants were matched with a short list
of Vida-recommended coaches from which they could select
their own ongoing health coach. Health coaches were
professional licensed nutritionists, physical therapists, and social
workers who are certified to provide health coaching and were
additionally trained by Vida once employed in the Vida network.
The first 4 months of the Vida program consisted of an intensive
active coaching phase followed by 8 months of maintenance
coaching. During the active coaching phase, participants had
regular consults—video chats or phone calls through the Vida
app—with their coaches ranging from weekly to monthly in
frequency. Different coaching frequencies were recommended
for each participant based on the coach’s assessment of
participants’ needs and availability. Participants were
encouraged to weigh in on a weekly basis on their wireless
scales. During this time period, coaches worked with participants
to set personalized health goals around healthy nutrition,
physical activity, stress management, and medication adherence,
carefully tailored to advance participants’ weight loss goals. In
between consults, coaches communicated with their clients via
secure text messaging in the Vida app, providing daily
accountability through quick reminders about clients’ personal
goals, motivation through inspirational content, and education
through easily understandable pieces of content.
In addition to data passively collected by the wireless scales,
pedometers, and blood pressure cuffs provided to participants,
members were also asked to enter their activity (ie, steps,
exercise, food intake, sleep, and stress levels). Participants who
had difficulty using or synchronizing the provided devices had
the option of self-entering biometric data (ie, weight and blood
pressure) directly into the Vida app. For the purposes of accurate
analyses, we excluded metric points that were deemed to be
unrealistic outliers that fell outside of the scope of clinical
weight loss or the trend of the participant. Members were not
paid for their participation. Program costs, including both the
coaching service and associated hardware devices, were covered
by their insurance provider.
Measures
The primary outcome of the study was weight loss at 4 months
as defined by percent change in total body weight (TBW) to
normalize against a range of starting body weights. Participants
were encouraged to weigh themselves weekly during the 4
months of the intensive coaching program. Weight data was
primarily collected through the direct transmission of values
via a Bluetooth scale provided as part of the intervention. Some
participants chose to self-enter data due to technical difficulties
setting up and using the Bluetooth scale. Change in TBW was
calculated as the difference between the first weight since
program enrollment and the last weight entered closest to the
end of 4 months of coaching, with the caveat that the provided
weight was recorded between 3 and 5 months after program
enrollment.
Secondary outcomes included change in systolic blood pressure
(SBP) after 4 months of intensive health coaching, as well as
the change in number of participants in each hypertensive
category (ie, normal, prehypertensive, type 1 hypertension, and
type 2 hypertension) from the beginning of enrollment to after
4 months of coaching.
Satisfaction with the intervention was summarized using
participant-reported ratings of the Vida Health app. Throughout
the program, participants were asked, “How are we doing?
Please help us improve your experience by taking a minute to
leave feedback for your coach.” Participants could input text
feedback and rate their experience on a scale of 0-10, with 10
being the highest rating.
Control Group
Given that this study was based off of registry data from an
existing pilot program, a designated control arm that did not
receive coaching was not defined. However, there was a subset
of individuals (n=73) enrolled in the program who had historic
weight data from owning Bluetooth scales prior to starting the
program. Using the Validic application programming interface,
these historic weight data points were added to the Vida app
database when individuals synchronized their devices as part
of the program. These individuals’ historic weight data 4 months
prior to starting the Vida program were used as a proxy for a
matched-pair control group, as these individuals successfully
enrolled and received coaching through the program, thereby
eliminating any bias toward motivation.
Analyses
Summary statistics describing the demographic characteristics
are provided in Table 1, including age, gender, starting BMI,
geographic state, and relevant self-reported medical history
among enrolled and active participants who have recorded
weight data.
Participant data were statistically analyzed using R version 3.3.3
(The R Foundation) using descriptive analysis and two-sided
t tests to estimate the statistical difference between the
preintervention and the postintervention measurements.
Differences were compared in categorical and continuous data
between the intervention and matched-pair control groups using
chi-square and two-sample t tests, respectively. Absolute weight

 loss and change in percent TBW were calculated at 4 months.
Change in weight was calculated as the difference between the
first weight since enrollment—no more than one month after
enrollment—and the weight between 12 and 20 weeks that was
closest to 4 months from enrollment. Paired t tests were used
to assess significance in percent weight change at 4 months in
the intervention and control groups. To assess if there was a
dose-dependent relationship between engagement and weight
loss, participants were stratified by engagement cohorts based
on number of coaching consults and text messages sent from
participant. For each cohort, mean percent weight loss was
calculated. The high-engagement cohort was defined as
participants who were at the top quartile of messages sent per
month or number of coaching consults in the 4-month coaching
period. The low-engagement cohort was defined as participants
at the bottom quartile of number of messages and video consults.
The medium-engagement cohort was defined as participants in
the 25th-75th engagement percentiles.
Similarly, baseline blood pressure was designated as the first
blood pressure reading since enrollment. Final blood pressure
was designated as the blood pressure reading taken between 12
and 20 weeks that was closest to 4 months from enrollment.
The mean change in SBP was calculated and assessed for
significance using a two-sided t test. Furthermore, participants
were stratified by hypertension stage—as defined by the Seventh
Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
(JNC-7)—based on their baseline SBP; this stratification showed
the proportion of participants whose final blood pressure placed
them in a better or worse stage.

Results
Enrollment and Demographics
Participant enrollment and retention in the program is displayed
Figure 1. Among the 1127 adults who were initially enrolled in
the program, 1012 (89.80%) participants completed 4 months
of intensive health coaching at the time of analysis. Of the 1012
enrolled, 763 (75.40%) participants, who will now be referred
to as the intervention group, had an initial weight upon
enrollment and final weight between 3 and 5 months from
enrollment. Of the 1012 enrolled, there were 73 (7.21%)
participants who had weight data 4 months prior to and after
Vida coaching, who served as the matched-pair control group.

 Figure 1. Study population including enrollment and retention.
Baseline demographics and chronic disease profiles of all
enrolled participants, intervention participants, and matched-pair
controls with weight data are reported in Table 1. Of the 1012
total enrolled participants, 337 (33.30%) were men, 368
(36.36%) were overweight, 644 (63.64%) were obese, 98
(9.68%) were prediabetic or diabetic, and 157 (15.51%) had
hypertension. These characteristics do not differ significantly
between the enrolled participants and the intervention group.
Compared to the intervention group, the matched-pair control
group had fewer men (261/763, 34.2% intervention vs 17/73,
23% control, P=.08) and more obese participants (480/763,
62.9% intervention vs 54/73, 74% control, P=.31). These
differences were not statistically significant. The only
statistically significant difference between the three populations
was the distribution of participants in each state between the
intervention and matched-pair control groups (P=.02).
Changes in Weight Loss
As shown in Table 2, participants in the intervention group lost
an average of 3.23% TBW at 4 months of coaching. Out of 763
participants, 218 (28.6%) achieved a clinically significant weight
loss of 5% or more of TBW, with a mean of 9.46% weight loss
in this cohort. In the matched-pair controls, participants gained
an average of 1.81% TBW in 4 months without Vida coaching
and lost an average of 2.47% TBW after 4 months of Vida
coaching (see Table 3), demonstrating a statistically significant
difference of 4.28% in mean percentage weight change (P<.001)
(see Figure 2).
Figure 2 shows a box plot demonstrating the mean percentage
change in weight in controls during the 4 months before Vida
coaching and 4 months after Vida coaching. The mean
percentage change in body weight and standard error for users
before Vida and after Vida are 1.81% (SE 0.41) and -2.47%
(SE 0.48), respectively. A two-sided t test was performed and
demonstrated a statistically significant difference of 4.28% in
mean percentage weight change (P<.001).
The level of engagement impacted the amount of weight loss
among study participants. There were 306 participants in the
high-engagement cohort, defined as participants who were at
the top quartile of messages sent per month or number of
coaching consults in the 4-month coaching period. There were
74 participants in the low-engagement cohort, defined as
participants at the bottom quartile of messages and video
consults. There were 383 participants in the medium-engagement
cohort. The high-engagement cohort lost the most weight,
followed by the medium- and then low-engagement cohorts
(see Table 4).

Change in Blood Pressure
Of 151 participants with blood pressure data in Vida, the
baseline average SBP was 131 mmHg and the mean change in
SBP was a 6 mmHg decrease after 4 months (see Table 5).
Among these 151 participants, 112 (74.2%) had a baseline blood
pressure that was above the goal, assuming a normal SBP of
≤120 mmHg; 55 out of 112 (49.1%) improved their blood
pressure by an entire hypertensive stage—as defined by the
JNC-7—at 4 months. Of the 76 users whose baseline SBP was
in the prehypertensive range, 27 (36%) had an SBP that was
normal and 8 (11%) had an SBP that was in a more severe
hypertensive stage after 4 months (see Figure 3). Of the 29
participants with a baseline SBP in the type 1 hypertension
range at 4 months, 22 (76%) had an SBP that was in a better
stage and none had an SBP in a worse hypertensive stage. Of
the 7 participants with a baseline SBP in type 2 hypertension,
6 participants (86%) had a 4-month SBP in a better stage and
none had an SBP in a worse stage.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of participants from each
hypertension stage at baseline that moved to a better or worse
hypertension stage after 4 months of coaching.

Discussion
In this study, a mobile phone-based health-coaching intervention
was found to be effective in reducing weight and blood pressure
in overweight and obese adults over a 4-month period, with
participants in the matched-pair control group demonstrating a
statistically significant difference of 4.28% in mean percentage
weight change.
Unlike other interventions targeting more complex conditions
[17,26], this program enrolled a broad, geographically diverse,
and relatively healthy population intended to mirror the general
overweight population of a national commercial payer. Most
participants were in their 40s, reflecting the enrollment strategy:

 a commercially insured population that is, by definition, at least
working age but largely younger than Medicare eligibility at 65
years. Similar to other digital health studies with weight loss
interventions [17,23-25], our study cohort was predominantly
female, which may suggest that women are more likely to
engage in weight loss interventions.
Key aspects of the intervention included the ability for
participants to self-monitor progress and be accountable for
goals set with their health coach. Self-monitoring is the most
common feature of mobile apps for health intervention [20,27]
and has been shown to have positive effects [25,28,29]. With
the ability to log health-related behaviors into the app (eg, food
choices and exercise duration) and the ability to see data from
wireless pedometers upload instantaneously into the app,
participants are able to keep track of their progress as they
progress 
through 
the 
intervention. 
However, 
with
self-monitoring alone, engagement and retention can be a
challenge, as most mobile apps have only simplistic capabilities
that lack complex user needs and preferences as well as the
relationship of a health care expert who can weigh in on their
progress [27]. There was high engagement in the study cohort,
with 90% of those who downloaded the app completing 4
months of coaching. This is highly important given that failure
in clinical interventions for obesity have been primarily
attributed to fluctuations in treatment adherence over time, as
patients often lack sustained motivation for primary prevention
compared to those with more complex conditions who face a
more urgent need for behavior change [30,31]. The fact that
participants were satisfied with the intervention, given their
high rating of the Vida Health app, demonstrates that the mobile
app is an effective platform for delivering health coaching.
Participants viewed their relationship with their coach favorably,
with the limitation that only 44% of those in the intervention
group provided feedback.
There was notable weight loss in the intervention group at 4
months, with an average total body weight loss of 3.23%. In
addition, 28.6% of participants achieved a clinically significant
weight loss of 5% TBW or more, with an average of 9.5% TBW
lost in this cohort. The change in weight loss is even more
significant when taking into account the fact that the intervention
began in late November through the winter holiday season when
people have the hardest time losing weight [32]. This compares
favorably to a mobile SMS text message-based weight loss
program, which produced 3.16% TBW loss in its intervention
arm after 4 months [33], and to a mobile phone-based,
self-monitoring and health consultation program, which
demonstrated 2.86% TBW loss in its intervention arm after 24
weeks [26]. Our results also corroborate findings from Chin et
al who demonstrated positive weight loss benefits in their study
of the mobile phone, health coach app, Noom, with 77.9% of
participants reporting a decrease in body weight during app
usage [25].
Unique in this analysis was the availability of 4-month pre- and
postcoaching data for a subset of participants that could act as
their own matched-pair controls, thereby controlling for the role
of intrinsic motivation and allowing the study to isolate the
impact of Vida coaching on weight loss. Given that participants
in this cohort gained 1.81% TBW over the 4 months prior to
using Vida and lost 2.47% TBW over the 4 months after starting
Vida suggests the true impact of Vida coaching to be even
greater than measured, which is due to the likely continued
weight gain in the absence of additional coaching intervention.
The dose-dependent relationship between engagement and
weight loss further demonstrates that weight loss was driven by
engagement with the coach.
In the cohort of 151 participants who had blood pressure data,
Vida coaching had a positive impact in reducing average SBP
by 5.96 mmHg and by moving significant numbers of
participants within each blood pressure stage to a better blood
pressure stage after 4 months of coaching. Overall, half of the
participants with blood pressure data improved their blood
pressure by an entire hypertensive stage after 4 months of
coaching, with greater proportions of participants improving at
higher stages of baseline hypertension. There is limited data in
existing literature regarding the impact of digital health
interventions on blood pressure in a comparable cohort. One
meta-analysis found that digital health interventions did not
have statistically significant impact on blood pressure [34].
Willey et al demonstrated a mean SBP change of 18.6 mmHg
after 12 weeks of a digital health app intervention that delivered
guided nutritional and physical exercise plans, albeit the sample
size was limited to 10 participants [35].
There were limitations to this study. Criteria for enrollment
were largely self-reported. Participants skewed toward having
more female than male participants and toward being a relatively
young cohort, making generalization to older individuals more
difficult. While participants were geographically diverse, it is
challenging to draw conclusions around the impact of the
intervention on minority populations or populations of varying
education and income brackets, given the lack of demographic
data around ethnicity and socioeconomic status. All participants
were mobile phone owners, which is associated with higher
socioeconomic status and, therefore, possibly less prevalence
of obesity and chronic disease [36,37]. However, mobile phone
ownership has high penetrance, with the majority of people
owning mobile phones even in the lowest education and income
brackets [37]. Another limitation was the lack of a true control
group, though this was addressed by using the closest proxy
available with participants who had weight data prior to
receiving coaching, albeit a small sample size. The study was
also limited by data availability and attrition. A total of 15% of
those enrolled completed the program but could not be included
in the analysis due to lack of weight data. Technical challenges
with hardware devices likely contributed to lack of weight data,
given the large number of technical assistance requests from
participants regarding their pedometers and scales. Further
analyses of clinical results and cost-effectiveness at future time
points are needed.
Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that a mobile
app-based coaching intervention can be an acceptable and
effective means to achieving desired clinical results for
overweight and obese individuals. As mobile phones continue
to penetrate the consumer market, digital health coaching may
serve as a promising model to increase access to evidence-based
behavioral coaching for obesity and related cardiovascular
conditions.
