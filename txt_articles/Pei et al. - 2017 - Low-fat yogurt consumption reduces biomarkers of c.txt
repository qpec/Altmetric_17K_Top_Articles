Abstract
The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of low-fat dairy product consumption are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine
whether low-fat yogurt reduces biomarkers of chronic inflammation and endotoxin exposure in women. Premenopausal women (BMI 18·5–27
and 30–40kg/m2) were randomised to consume 339 g of low-fat yogurt (yogurt non-obese (YN); yogurt obese (YO)) or 324 g of soya pudding
(control non-obese; control obese (CO)) daily for 9 weeks (n 30/group). Fasting blood samples were analysed for IL-6, TNF-α/soluble TNF II
(sTNF-RII), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, anandamide, monocyte gene expression, soluble CD14 (sCD14),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS binding protein (LBP), IgM endotoxin-core antibody (IgM EndoCAb), and zonulin. BMI, waist circumference and
blood pressure were also determined. After 9-week yogurt consumption, YO and YN had decreased TNF-α/sTNFR-RII. Yogurt consumption
increased plasma IgM EndoCAb regardless of obesity status. sCD14 was not affected by diet, but LBP/sCD14 was lowered by yogurt consumption
in both YN and YO. Yogurt intervention increased plasma 2-arachidonoylglycerol in YO but not YN. YO peripheral blood mononuclear cells
expression of NF-κB inhibitor α and transforming growth factor β1 increased relative to CO at 9 weeks. Other biomarkers were unchanged by
diet. CO and YO gained approximately 0·9 kg in body weight. YO had 3·6 % lower diastolic blood pressure at week 3. Low-fat yogurt for 9 weeks
reduced biomarkers of chronic inflammation and endotoxin exposure in premenopausal women compared with a non-dairy control food. This
trial was registered as NCT01686204.
Key words: Obesity: Low-fat yogurt: Chronic inflammation: Endotoxin exposure: Dairy products
Obesity is associated with increased risk of CVD, type 2
diabetes, hypertension and certain cancers(1). These comor-
bidities are associated with chronic inflammation(1). Unre-
solved, low-grade, obesity-associated inflammation originates
from the interplay between immune cells and metabolic tissues
such as adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas and brain in response
to excessive nutrient intake, leading to increased proin-
flammatory cytokine release(2). Inflammation is exacerbated by
chronic
endotoxin
exposure
resulting
from
compromised
intestinal barrier function in obese individuals(3,4). Endotoxin,
especially the Gram-negative-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
from gut microbiota, induces inflammation in humans(5). LPS
inflammatory signaling is mediated by its translocation by
lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein
(LBP)
and
membrane-
bound or soluble CD14 (sCD14) to Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)/MD2 complex(6). The endocannabinoid (eCB) system
also modulates intestinal barrier function and metabolic endo-
toxaemia associated with obesity(4).
Yogurt consumption appears to be a promising strategy to
improve obesity-associated intestinal barrier dysfunction and
prevent chronic inflammation. Consumption of Lactobacillus-
containing yogurt reduced surrogate markers of endotoxaemia
and decreased intestinal permeability in individuals with com-
promised gut barrier integrity(7,8). Smaller intervention studies

 demonstrated that yogurt consumption reduced biomarkers of
inflammation in elderly individuals and children(9,10). Epide-
miological studies have also associated increased dairy product
consumption with decreased risk of chronic diseases such as
CVD, type 2 diabetes and hypertension(11–13). However, the
effect of yogurt consumption on inflammation and endotoxin
exposure in healthy premenopausal women is still largely
unknown. We hypothesised that regular consumption of a
commercial low-fat yogurt would reduce biomarkers of chronic
inflammation
and
endotoxin
exposure
in
healthy
pre-
menopausal women. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a
randomised trial using a macronutrient- and texture-matched
non-dairy food as a control.

Participants
This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid
down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures invol-
ving human participants were approved by the Institutional
Review Boards at the University of Connecticut (no. H12-168)
and University of Wisconsin-Madison (no. 2014-0669). Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01686204. The study
inclusion criteria included: BMI from 18·5 to 27 kg/m2 or from
30 to 40 kg/m2, age 21 to 55 years, stable body weight for the
previous 2 months, willing to avoid yogurt and probiotic-
containing foods and consume the provided 339 g of yogurt or
324 g soya pudding (control treatment) for the duration of the
study, no previous diagnosis of CVD, diabetes or arthritis, not
being currently treated for cancer, not taking any anti-
inflammatory drugs or prescribed oestrogen replacement ther-
apy, not on slimming, vegetarian or vegan diets, not currently
taking dietary supplements or smoking, not allergic to soya, egg
or milk, not pregnant, lactating or seeking to become pregnant.
Dietary treatment
The dietary intervention consisted of commercially available
low-fat yogurt (Yoplait, General Mills, Inc.), and soya pudding
(unfermented) as a macronutrient and micronutrient, energy
content and texture-matched control food (ZenSoy). The
nutrients provided daily by the two test foods are described in
Table 1.
Experimental design
We performed a randomised, controlled study of parallel design to
examine how yogurt consumption affects chronic inflammation
and intestinal barrier function relative to the consumption of a
non-dairy control food. sCD14 has been used as a biomarker for
endotoxin exposure and was thus chosen as the primary out-
come(14). For the sample size calculation, an 8·2% margin of error
for sCD14 was determined for a moderate group size (n 30/group)
based on the standard deviation of sCD14 in a prior study(14).
Apparently healthy premenopausal women were recruited from
the Storrs, CT and Madison, WI area from October 2012 to April
2015. After the initial screening, 128 subjects were enrolled and
randomly assigned to either the yogurt group or the soya pudding
control group, in blocks of six(15). Participants were randomised
upon enrolment by assigning random numbers generated by
Minitab 17.0 (Minitab Inc.). To avoid confounding by probiotic or
dairy product consumption, the participants were instructed to
restrict consumption of dietary supplements, fermented foods and
limit their dairy product consumption to ≤4 servings/d for 2 weeks
before the intervention (washout period, weeks −2–0) and
throughout the intervention. From the beginning of week 0 to the
end of week 9 (intervention period), the participants consumed
339g of yogurt (12oz.) or 324g of control food daily. The lids of
consumed yogurt and pudding cups were collected weekly to
assess compliance. Participants visited the study centre at weeks 0,
3, 6 and 9 for anthropometric and blood pressure measurements.
In addition, fasting blood samples were collected from the ante-
cubital vein into evacuated tubes containing EDTA or sodium
heparin (Becton, Dickinson and Company). At weeks 0 and 9,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were immediately
isolated from 20ml of sodium heparin blood samples for later
mRNA analysis. For biomarker analysis, plasma was prepared

 from blood samples held on ice and centrifuged (4°C, 15min,
1500 g) within 20min of collection. Aliquots of plasma were
transferred to sterile cryogenic vials and snap-frozen in liquid N2.
All samples were stored at −80°C until analysis.
Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements
Body weight and height were measured on a digital physician
scale to the nearest 0·1 kg and 1cm (H150-10-5; Rice Lake
Weighing Systems). Waist circumference was determined by pla-
cing a measuring tape evenly around a bare abdomen at the iliac
crest. Blood pressure was measured using an Omron HEM-780
with ComFit cuff for non-obese participants, or an Omron BP710
with Omron H003D large adult cuff for obese participants (Omron
Healthcare, Inc.). Before readings, participants were instructed to
sit upright in a phlebotomy chair for a minimum of 5min with their
back supported, feet on the floor, legs uncrossed, bladder empty,
and their upper arm supported at heart level(16). Blood pressure
was measured twice, at least 3min apart. If readings were more
than 5mmHg apart, a third reading was taken.
Inflammatory biomarkers
IL-6 and TNF-α in EDTA plasma were measured by human high-
sensitivity ELISA kits (IL-6, catalogue no. SS600B; TNF-α, catalogue
no. SSTA00D; R&D System). Soluble TNF-Receptor II (sTNF-RII)
was measured by a human ELISA kit (catalogue no. SRT200; R&D
System). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured
by a human ELISA kit (catalogue no. BC-1119; BioCheck Inc.). All
the measurements were performed on a SpectraMax M2 micro-
plate reader (Molecular Devices), following the manufacturer’s
instruction.
Biomarkers of endotoxin exposure and intestinal
barrier function
LBP and IgM endotoxin-core antibody (IgM EndoCAb) in EDTA
plasma were measured by human ELISA kits (LBP, catalogue no.
HK315; IgM EndoCAb, catalogue no. HK504-IGM; Hycult Bio-
tech). EDTA plasma LPS was measured by the PyroGene
Recombinant Factor C endotoxin Detection System (catalogue no.
50-658U; Lonza Group Ltd). EDTA plasma zonulin was measured
by a human ELISA kit (catalogue no. K5600; Immundiagnostik
AG). Sodium heparin plasma sCD14 was measured by a human
ELISA kit (catalogue no. DC140; R&D System). All the measure-
ments were performed on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices), following the manufacturers’ instruction.
The ratio between LBP and sCD14 was calculated as a marker for
endotoxaemia. Plasma AEA and 2-AG were quantitated by UPLC-
MS/MS after protein precipitation and cleanup by Ostro pass-
through sample preparation plate. These methods are described
further in the online Supplementary material.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation and
mRNA analysis
PBMC were isolated from sodium heparin blood by gradient
centrifugation using Histopaque®-1077 and stored at −80°C. RNA
was extracted from PMBC by TRIzol reagent and further pur-
ified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). After subsequent
complementary DNA synthesis, RT quantitative PCR was per-
formed using the iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad), on a Bio-Rad CFX96 system (Bio-Rad). A detailed
description of the methodology and primer sequences are in
the online Supplementary material and Table S1.
Dietary analysis
Participants were instructed to maintain their usual dietary
pattern and energy intake, accounting for the additional 1255 kJ
(330 kcal) provided by the intervention foods. Dietary records
were used to examine if the intervention changed participants’
nutrients intakes or dietary patterns and to determine their
compliance to the requested dietary restrictions. Participants
were instructed to complete 3-d food records on two non-
consecutive weekdays and 1 weekend day of their choice
during the washout period and near the end of the intervention.
Non-consecutive days were used to include a more repre-
sentative record of foods in the dietary records(17). Participants
were given detailed instructions on how to complete the record
by study staff. The food records were reviewed by study staff
upon submission and any incomplete or inaccurate information
was corrected with participant input. The self-reported dietary
intakes were analysed by 2013 Nutrition Data System for
Research (NCC).
Statistical analysis
All results were expressed as mean values with their standard
errors. Statistical analysis was conducted on SAS 9.4 software.
The significance level was set at α = 0·05 for all tests. At base-
line, the differences of obese v. non-obese were analysed by
independent t test (PROC TTEST). Pearson’s correlation coef-
ficients of pairwise variables were determined by linear
regression modelling (PROC CORR). The effects of dietary
treatment (yogurt v. control), obesity (obese v. non-obese) and
treatment × obesity on BMI, waist circumference and blood
pressure were determined by two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA with time as a covariate (PROC MIXED). At week 9, the
difference in biomarkers between yogurt and control treatment
groups was analysed by ANCOVA with baseline as the covariate
(PROC GLM). For data analysis that required normal distribu-
tion, the Shapiro–Wilk test (PROC UNIVARIATE) was used for
testing
normality.
If
data
failed
the
normality
test,
log-
transformation was performed to achieve normality.
Results
In brief, 128 subjects were recruited. Eight subjects were
excluded or dropped from the study due to personal or com-
pliance issues. At the end of the study, sixty obese (30–40 kg/
m2) and sixty non-obese (18·5–27 kg/m2) participants com-
pleted the study, with n 30/group (yogurt obese (YO); control
obese (CO); yogurt non-obese (YN); control non-obese)
(Fig. 1). Due to the serving size, appearance and taste of
intervention food, we were unable to blind participants.
Nevertheless, all groups showed similar compliance of >95 %.

 The baseline characteristics of participants are described in
Table 2. The obese group was older and had higher blood
pressure than the non-obese group (P < 0·0001). Compared
with non-obese participants, obese participants had higher IL-6,
hsCRP, TNF-α indicating chronic inflammation, and had higher
LBP, LBP:sCD14 ratio and lower IgM EndoCAb indicating
increased endotoxin exposure (P < 0·05). Notably, baseline
sCD14 and LPS were not different between non-obese and
obese groups (P = 0·6579 and P = 0·2005, respectively). All
measured
biomarkers
for
inflammation
and
endotoxin
exposure except for sCD14 and LPS were correlated with BMI
(online Supplementary Table S2).
Fasting plasma markers of inflammation
Low-fat yogurt consumption for 9 weeks led to decreased
TNF-α
(Ptreatment = 0·0219)
and
the
TNF-α/sTNF-RII
ratio
(Ptreatment =0·0013) in both YN and YO (Table 3). Compared with
baseline levels, YO had 7% decreased TNF-α/sTNF-RII ratio. The
obesity status had no effect on TNF-α or the TNF-α/sTNF-RII ratio.

 On the other hand, neither plasma IL-6 nor hsCRP was affected by
dietary treatment or obesity status.
Fasting biomarkers of endotoxin exposure and intestinal
barrier function
After 9 weeks intervention, IgM EndoCAb increased in both
YN and YO (Ptreatment = 0·0052) (Table 3). The primary study
outcome, fasting plasma sCD14 was unchanged (Table 3).
Similarly, LBP was not affected by the dietary treatment over
9 weeks. The ratio of LBP:sCD14 was determined as an
exploratory outcome, as recent data have indicated this may be
a better marker of endotoxin exposure than either marker
alone(18,19). The LBP/sCD14 ratio was lower in the yogurt
consumption groups than in the control groups (Ptreatment =
0·0477) (Table 3). However, plasma LPS was not affected

 by the dietary treatment. A significant dietary treatment ×
obesity interaction effect on plasma 2-AG was detected
(Ptreatment × obesity = 0·0372).
Subgroup
analysis
indicated
yogurt consumption led to higher 2-AG in YO than in CO
(P = 0·0114) (Table 3). On the other hand, plasma AEA was
not changed.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells mRNA expression
Endotoxin induces the production of inflammatory cytokines
via TLR4/NF-κB pathway. We evaluated PBMC mRNA expres-
sion of key components of the NF-κB pathway in the obese
group. At baseline, YO and CO gene expression did not differ
(online Supplementary Fig. S1). After 9 weeks, YO NFKBIA
(encoding NF-κB inhibitor α (IκBα)) and encoding transforming
growth factor β1 (TGFB1) increased by 54 and 20 % from
baseline, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, the mRNA expression
of these genes did not change in CO.
Anthropometric changes
After 9 weeks intervention, BMI was affected by obesity status,
but not dietary treatment (Pobesity = 0·0084) (Table 4). BMI
increased continuously in both YO and CO. However, dietary
records did not indicate increased energy intake (online Sup-
plementary Table S3). Despite this weight gain, YO and CO
waist circumferences were unchanged. Yogurt consumption
significantly
reduced
diastolic
blood
pressure
(Ptreatment =
0·0188), but not systolic blood pressure (Table 4). Within YO,
diastolic blood pressure decreased by 2·82 (SEM 0·90) mmHg at
week 3, with less decreases at weeks 6 and 9.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that consuming two servings
of low-fat yogurt daily for 9 weeks reduced fasting bio-
markers of chronic inflammation and endotoxin exposure in
apparently healthy premenopausal women. These findings are
of significance because of the known role of compromised
intestinal barrier function and subsequent endotoxin exposure
as a mechanism of chronic inflammation, particularly in
obesity(3,4).

 Increased proinflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6, hsCRP
and TNF-α have been associated with obesity in both adults and
children(20,21). Consuming low-fat yogurt for 9 weeks resulted in
a modest, but significant reduction of the levels of TNF-α, which
may be partly explained by reduced activation of the TLR4-
mediated inflammatory pathway. Upon TLR4 activation by
endotoxin, a downstream signaling cascade is triggered that
leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway(22). IκBα (encoded by
NFKBIA) inhibits the NF-κB pathway by trapping the hetero-
dimeric complex in the cytosol(23). Since YO NFKBIA was
increased at the end of the intervention, yogurt consumption
may suppress TLR4 activation of NF-κB. TGF-β1 is an anti-
inflammatory and reparative cytokine that suppresses proin-
flammatory signaling from Toll-like receptors(24). YO TGFB1
(encoding TGF-β1) expression was increased by the interven-
tion
but
other
downstream
genes
of
NF-κB
including
PTGS2, NCF1, TNF and IFNG were not affected by the inter-
vention. Given the reduction in YO plasma TNF-α, non-PBMC
sources of TNF such as the immunocytes resident in the intes-
tine, adipose tissue, or skeletal muscle may have contributed to
this change.
Obesity is associated with subclinical endotoxaemia which
increases chronic inflammation(5). Contrary to others(25), the
obese group did not have increased LPS relative to the non-
obese group in the present study. We expected plasma LPS to
be reduced by yogurt consumption, however non-significant
increases in plasma LPS were observed after the dietary inter-
vention. Direct quantitation of LPS by the LAL method is chal-
lenging, due to its short half-life, low blood concentrations and
the difficulty of removing interference from the blood matrix(26).
The LAL assay also does not account for lipoprotein-bound
LPS(27). In addition, other bacterial compounds such as glyco-
lipids and lipoproteins derived from pathogenic Gram-positive
bacteria are pro-inflammatory(28). Therefore, it is likely that
quantitation of LPS by the LAL method does not account for
total bioactive endotoxin, and could be masked by lipoprotein
differences between experimental groups. Thus, the extent
fasting LPS values in the present study reflect intestinal barrier
function and true endotoxin load is unclear.
LBP and sCD14 have been proposed as surrogate biomarkers
of endotoxaemia because of their roles in sequestering and
translocating LPS and other bacterial compounds to inflamma-
tory signaling pathways(28). Similar to the present study, LBP
was higher in overweight/obese individuals than in normal-
weight individuals, indicating low-grade chronic endotox-
aemia(3). Serum LBP was also associated with increased
abdominal obesity and proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and
IL-8(29). However, the originally proposed primary outcome,
fasting plasma sCD14, was not different between the obese and
non-obese groups in the present study. Similarly, sCD14 was
not associated with obesity in another study population (n 420,
55 % females, age 18–92 years)(29). Therefore, sCD14 alone may
not be an appropriate biomarker for low-grade endotoxaemia.
LBP and sCD14 act together to detoxify endotoxin. Healthy men
have postprandial plasma LBP/sCD14 ratios that are correlated
with
plasma
endotoxin(18,19).
We
observed
that
obese
participants had 27 % higher plasma LBP:sCD14 ratio than the
non-obese participants at baseline, which suggested increased
endotoxin exposure. Moderate increases in LBP/sCD14 ratio
were found in control but not the yogurt-consuming groups,
suggesting
protective
effects
of
yogurt
against
chronic
endotoxaemia.
Another surrogate biomarker of endotoxaemia is IgM Endo-
CAb, which can bind to the inner core of endotoxin and protect
against endotoxin(30). In a cross-sectional study involving
ninety-three age-matched middle-aged women, IgM EndoCAb
in obese and obese diabetic women was 55 and 30 % of non-
obese participants(31). Similarly, IgM EndoCAb level in obese
participants was 69 % of that in the non-obese in the present
study. Yogurt consumption increased the IgM EndoCAb level in
both obese and non-obese participants, suggesting decreased
level
of
endotoxin
exposure
resulting
from
the
yogurt
intervention.
Intestinal barrier function is regulated in-part by eCB. 2-AG
improves the intestinal barrier, whereas AEA is associated with
decreased intestinal barrier function(4). After the 9-week inter-
vention, a modest decrease in 2-AG was observed in CO, but
not in YO. This may suggest protective effects of yogurt on
intestinal barrier function relative to the control snack.
Yogurt
directly
increased
tight
junction
proteins
and
improved barrier function in Caco-2 cells(32). A few dietary
interventions have improved intestinal barrier function in var-
ious populations. For example, consumption of 300 g/d yogurt
containing Lactobacillus johnsonii for 4 weeks decreased
plasma LBP and intestinal permeability in elderly adults with
intestinal bacterial overgrowth(7). Intervention studies on the
anti-inflammatory effects of yogurt consumption are also lim-
ited. In elderly individuals, consumption of 100 g/d yogurt
containing
Lactobacillus
acidophilus
and
Bifidobacterium
lactis
for
2
weeks
decreased
faecal
haptoglobin,
but
plasma inflammatory biomarkers were not determined(9). In
children with Helicobacter pylori, 400 ml/d yogurt containing
L. acidophilus and B. lactis for 4 weeks decreased serum
IL-6(10). The yogurt in the present study is a commercially
available product that is more representative of typical yogurt
products in the USA. Thus, probiotic fortification may not be
necessary in yogurt to modulate chronic inflammation in
apparently healthy women. Nevertheless, dietary intervention
alone might not be sufficient to manage obesity-associated
inflammation. Other strategies such as weight management and
pharmaceutical approaches should be incorporated.
In this study, obese participants gained approximately 1 kg
body weight, even though dietary records did not reveal
increased energy intake. Most obese participants reported an
energy intake below the calculated estimated energy require-
ments, indicating underreporting. The interventions supplied
54 g of sugar, which contributed to the increased sugar con-
sumption by YO and CO. It is estimated that individuals having
higher sugar intake have 0·75 kg (95 % CI 0·30, 1·19; P = 0·001)
more body weight than those consuming less sugar during
short-term interventions(33). Diastolic blood pressure was lower
in YO at week 3, but rebounded at later weeks, possibly
because of weight gain at later weeks. Thus, it is possible that
sustained increased sugar intake diminished the beneficial
effect of yogurt consumption. This study adds to the existing
evidence that increased dairy product consumption might

 reduce blood pressure in obese individuals. A meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies associated an increased daily intake
of 200 g of low-fat dairy products with decreased risk of
hypertension (RR 0·96; 95 % CI 0·93, 0·99)(34).
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting
the results of this study. Since only women were included as
participants, the results cannot be directly extended to men.
Furthermore, we did not recruit obese participants on the basis
of metabolic syndrome status, which could affect response to
dairy product interventions(35). In addition, participants self-
selected days to complete food records, which helps to improve
participant compliance to study procedures but may introduce
bias in selecting convenient days to record food intake (e.g. low
diversity of foods or skipped meals). Further studies are needed
to establish the extent regular yogurt consumption contributes
to nutrient intake and diet quality. A strength of this study was
that yogurt intervention consisted of commercially available
products within the recommended dietary guidance for dairy
product consumption. Notably, the yogurt was not fortified
with probiotics, but this study was not designed to test the
effects of fermentation. Other studies have demonstrated
specific
anti-inflammatory
and
intestinal
barrier-promoting
activity of probiotics(7,9).
A number of factors could have contributed to the benefits of
yogurt consumption in the present study. Preclinical studies
suggest milk oligosaccharides and lactoferrin promote intestinal
barrier function and have anti-inflammatory properties(36,37).
Dairy product fermentation also liberates peptides with hypo-
tensive activity, as reviewed elsewhere(6). Other simultaneous
dietary changes occurring with the intervention cannot be ruled
out for their effect on biomarkers of chronic inflammation and
intestinal barrier function.
In
summary,
this
study
demonstrated
that
consuming
339 g of low-fat yogurt daily for 9 weeks modestly reduced
chronic inflammation and inhibited markers of endotoxaemia
in
apparently
healthy
premenopausal
women.
The
anti-
inflammatory effect of yogurt consumption was partially attribu-
table to improved intestinal barrier function indicated by
EndoCAb and LBP:sCD14 in comparison to the non-dairy product
control.
