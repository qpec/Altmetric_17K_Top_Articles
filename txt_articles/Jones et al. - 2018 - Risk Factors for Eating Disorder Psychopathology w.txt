European Eating Disorders Review   2 
 
Abstract 
Many transgender people experience high levels of body dissatisfaction, which is one of 
numerous factors known to increase vulnerability to eating disorder symptoms in the 
cisgender (non-trans) population. Cross-sex hormones can alleviate body dissatisfaction so 
might also alleviate eating disorder symptoms. This study aimed to explore risk factors for 
eating disorder symptoms in transgender people and the role of cross-sex hormones. 
Individuals assessed at a national transgender health service were invited (N=563). 
Transgender people not on cross-sex hormones reported higher levels of eating disorder 
psychopathology than people who were. High body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, anxiety 
symptoms and low self-esteem were risk factors for eating psychopathology but, after 
controlling for these, significant differences in eating psychopathology between people who 
were and were not on cross-sex hormones disappeared. Cross-sex hormones may alleviate 
eating disorder psychopathology. Given the high prevalence of transgender identities, 
clinicians at eating disorder services should assess for gender identity issues. 
Key words:  transgender, eating disorder psychopathology, risk factors, cross-sex hormones,

Introduction 
Eating disorder psychopathology, which includes restrictive eating, binge eating and 
compensatory behaviours (e.g., self-induced vomiting, misuse of diet pills and laxatives), has 
been found to be more prevalent among adolescent girls and young adult women compared to 
men (e.g., Duncan, Ziobrowski, & Nicol, 2017; Fairburn & Harrison, 2003). Body 
dissatisfaction (i.e., the negative evaluation of one’s appearance; which is also more prevalent 
among adolescents and young people), has consistently been associated with eating disorder 
psychopathology in both females and males (e.g., Keel, Fulkerson, & Leon, 1997; Stice & 
Shaw, 2002; Wang, Lydecker, & Grilo, 2017). Body dissatisfaction is influenced by Western 
society’s view of beauty (e.g., Fitzsimmons-Craft, 2011). As a consequence, women who are 
dissatisfied with their bodies often strive to obtain a thin body, while men are more likely to 
strive to obtain a muscular physique (e.g., Grogan, 2016; McCreary & Sasse, 2000). There 
are certain populations that have been found to be at increased risk of high levels of body 
dissatisfaction, such as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community (e.g., 
Calzo, Blashill, Brown, & Argenal, 2017; McClain & Peebles, 2016; Morgan & Arcelus, 
2009). Within this group, transgender people are particularly vulnerable to body 
dissatisfaction due to the distress and incongruence they experience with their gender and 
body, yet this population is severely under researched in relation to eating disorders 
psychopathology (Jones, Haycraft, Murjan, & Arcelus, 2016; Witcomb et al., 2015).   
 
Transgender people experience incongruence between their gender assigned at birth 
(determined from their sex characteristics (i.e., genitals)) and the gender they identify with. 
Transgender men are assigned female at birth but identify as male, while transgender women 
are assigned male at birth but identify as female (Arcelus & Bouman, 2017a; Bouman et al., 
2017a). Cisgender people (non-transgender) do not experience such incongruence. Prior to 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people

undergoing gender affirming medical interventions (e.g., cross-sex hormone treatment 
(CHT), gender affirming surgery), many treatment seeking transgender people are 
dissatisfied with their body shape and/or weight, which may put them at risk of developing an 
eating disorder (Witcomb et al., 2015). It has been hypothesised that it is the body 
dissatisfaction (a common feature of eating disorder psychopathology), linked to the wish to 
achieve a masculine or feminine body ideal, which influences the development of eating 
disorder psychopathology, specifically drive for thinness and bulimia, among transgender 
people (Ålgars, Alanko, Santtila, & Sandnabba, 2012; Bouman & Arcelus, 2016; Khoosal, 
Langham, Palmer, Terry, & Minajagi, 2009). In addition, it has also been hypothesised that 
the wish to stop menstruation and puberty, as well as not wanting to develop a feminine body 
shape (such as the development of breasts), can also play a role in the development of an 
eating disorder in transgender males (Bouman & Arcelus, 2016). This may explain why 
disordered eating has been found to be prevalent in transgender adolescents (Watson, Veale, 
& Saewyc, 2017). For example, Diemer, Grant, Munn-Chernoff, Patterson and Duncan 
(2015) found that transgender adolescents more frequently self-reported an eating disorder 
diagnosis in the past year (15.84%), and presented with eating disorder symptoms such as the 
use of diet pills (13.50%), self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse (15.61%), compared to 
cisgender adolescents.  
 
As well as presenting to transgender health services with symptoms of an eating disorder, 
transgender people may initially present to eating disorder services. Case studies have 
reported on individuals who first present with eating disorder symptoms (e.g., food 
restriction, vomiting and body image distortion) without disclosing their transgender identity 
which, through exploration, has later been expressed as a desire to achieve a masculine or 
feminine body (different to the body associated with their gender assigned at birth) and, 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people

hence, identified as secondary to their gender identity (e.g., Couturier, Pindiprolu, Findlay, & 
Johnson, 2015; Winston, Acharya, Chaudhuri, & Fellowes, 2004). These findings are 
concerning considering that gender incongruence is not routinely assessed within eating 
disorder services given that the prevalence of transgender people is considered to be low. 
However, recently the prevalence of transgender people has increased and there has been a 
significant increase in demand for transgender health services across Europe and North 
America (Aitken et al., 2015; Arcelus et al., 2015; de Vries, Kreukels, T’Sjoen, Ålgars, & 
Mattila, 2015; House of Commons, 2016; Jones et al., 2017). Therefore, gender incongruence 
may need to be considered by clinicians working at eating disorder services.  
 
Within the cisgender population, several factors (such as body dissatisfaction (e.g., Keel et 
al., 1997; Stice & Shaw, 2002), high levels of perfectionism (e.g., Egan, Wade, & Shafran, 
2011; Tchanturia, Larsson, & Adamson, 2016), the existence of interpersonal problems (e.g., 
Arcelus, Haslam, Farrow, & Meyer, 2013), low self-esteem (Dakanalis et al., 2016), 
symptoms of anxiety and depression (e.g., Brechan & Kvalem, 2015; DeBoer & Smits, 2013; 
Fairburn, Cooper, & Shafran, 2003; Harrison, Sullivan, Tchanturia, & Treasure, 2009; Puccio 
et al., 2017) have been identified as being associated with eating disorder psychopathology 
and found to increase the risk of developing an eating disorder. Body dissatisfaction has 
consistently been found to be associated with eating disorder psychopathology (e.g., Keel et 
al., 1997; Stice & Shaw, 2002). Dissatisfaction with one’s body has been described as a core 
feature, but not sufficient to completely explain the development of eating disorders (Polivy 
& Herman, 2002). The relationship between eating disorder psychopathology and body 
dissatisfaction has been found to be complex as cognitive behavioural and emotional 
regulation theories of eating disorders have suggested that negative emotions, such as anxiety 
and depression, as well as self-esteem, mediate the relationship between body dissatisfaction 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   6 
 
and eating disorder psychopathology (e.g., Brechan & Kvalem, 2015; DeBoer & Smits, 2013; 
Fairburn et al., 2003; Harrison et al., 2009). Anxiety symptomatology has also been found to 
partially mediate the association between self-orientated perfectionism (a trait often 
associated with eating disorders; Egan et al., 2011) and eating disorder psychopathology 
(Egan et al., 2013), which suggests that anxiety plays a role in eating disorder development. 
Furthermore, interpersonal difficulties have also been linked to behaviours associated with 
eating disorders within the cisgender population (e.g., Arcelus et al., 2013).  
 
Factors associated with, and found to mediate, eating disorder psychopathology in the 
cisgender population may be particularly pertinent among transgender people. This is 
because research has consistently shown treatment seeking transgender people to report high 
levels of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression (e.g., Arcelus, Claes, 
Witcomb, Marshall, & Bouman, 2016; Bouman, Davey, Meyer, Witcomb, & Arcelus, 2016a; 
Bouman et al., 2017a; Dhejne, Van Vlerken, Heylens, & Arcelus, 2016; Millet, Longworth, 
& Arcelus, 2017), perfectionism (Khoosal et al., 2009), and interpersonal problems (Davey, 
Bouman, Meyer, & Arcelus, 2015) in comparison to cisgender people. Therefore these 
factors may be important when exploring risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology 
within the transgender population.  
 
Once a medical transition has been initiated (e.g., CHT and gender affirming surgery), body 
dissatisfaction has been found to significantly improve in transgender adults (e.g., de Vries, 
Steensma, Doreleijers, & Cohen-Kettenis, 2011, de Vries et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2014; van 
de Grift et al., 2016, 2017) and, therefore, these interventions may reduce the risk of 
developing an eating disorder or help to alleviate eating disorder symptoms. Although 
research is limited (one study date), eating disorder symptoms have been found to reduce 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   7 
 
once transgender women progress through their medical transition (Khoosal et al., 2009). 
However, this study only considered the role of surgery and not CHT. The study is also 
limited by the small sample size (N=40) and only recruiting transgender women. In light of 
this, the current study was concerned with exploring the role of CHT only and recruiting a 
larger sample comprising both men and women. In addition to this, this study was concerned 
with exploring risk factors in transgender people yet to undergo a medical transition as this 
vulnerable population may first present to eating disorder services (without disclosing their 
transgender identity). As the cisgender literature suggests that eating disorders are complex 
and multifactorial this is also likely to be the case within the transgender population. 
Variables that can mediate between identified risk factors and eating disorder 
psychopathology will be explored. These analyses within the transgender population are 
important to determine through which mechanisms gender affirming medical interventions 
(e.g., CHT) are capable of alleviating eating disorder symptoms. Taking into consideration 
some of the limitations of previous research, the study had three specific aims: 
1. To examine the role of CHT in eating disorder symptoms by determining whether 
there is a difference in eating disorder psychopathology (drive for thinness and 
bulimia) between a large sample of transgender people who are or who are not on 
CHT. 
2. To explore risk factors (age, assigned gender, body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, 
interpersonal problems, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression) associated with eating 
disorder psychopathology in transgender people who are not on CHT. 
3. To explore factors that mediate the relationship between identified risk factors and 
eating disorder psychopathology (drive for thinness and bulimia) in transgender 
people who are not on CHT.

Based on previous research it was first hypothesised that transgender people on CHT would 
have lower levels of eating disorder psychopathology compared to participants who are not 
on cross-sex hormones (e.g., Fisher et al., 2014). Second, it was hypothesised that younger 
age, identifying as female (because transgender people adopt and perform the social gender 
role (i.e., behaviours, attributes) associated with their experienced gender identity), higher 
levels of body dissatisfaction, anxiety, depression, perfectionism, interpersonal problems and 
lower levels of self-esteem would be risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology in 
transgender people who are not on CHT. Third, based on the centrality of body 
dissatisfaction to both gender incongruence (e.g., Jones et al., 2016) and eating disorders 
(e.g., Stice & Shaw, 2002), it was hypothesised that if a significant relationship was found 
between body dissatisfaction and eating disorder psychopathology (addressed in aim 2), then 
the other identified risk factors would mediate this relationship in people who are not on 
CHT.

Method 
Participants and recruitment  
All patients offered an assessment at a national transgender health service in the United 
Kingdom (UK) between 2012 and 2015 were invited to take part in the study. This 
transgender health service offers assessment and gender affirming medical interventions to 
adults aged 17 and over who are considering, or wish to, medically transition. Patients are 
assessed by a transgender health professional, which could be a psychiatrist, psychologist or 
nurse specialist. The assessment process usually occurs over three appointments, with two 
different clinicians. During the third appointment, patients are invited to bring a relative or 
friend with them. In total, 586 patients were invited for assessment during the study period 
and 563 (96%) agreed to participate (see Table 1 for characteristics of the whole sample). 
While all participants were recruited at the point of assessment, some people had initiated 
CHT prior to assessment at this service (n=139, 24.7%). Some participants may have initiated 
this intervention as their care was transferred from the child and adolescent gender identity 
development service and others might have obtained CHT through private health providers or 
via the Internet (Mepham, Bouman, Arcelus, Hayter, & Wylie, 2014). Table 1 also presents 
descriptive statistics separately for people who were and were not on CHT. In order to have 
an overall representation of patients attending a national transgender health service, no 
exclusion criteria were applied.

Procedure  
Before initial assessment, participants were invited to complete socio-demographic questions 
and a range of self-report measures. This was part of a larger study for which ethical approval 
was obtained from the National Health Service (NHS) ethics committee and from the 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   10 
 
Research and Development Department from the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS 
Foundation Trust in accordance with Health Research Authority guidance (HRA, 2013). 
Patients were informed that they could request a summary of the research findings on 
completion of the project. No patients chose to do this. 
 
Measures  
Socio-demographic information: Participants were asked to provide information about their 
age, gender assigned at birth, and stage of medical transition pre-assessment (e.g., whether 
they were on CHT or not).  They were then invited to complete the following selection of 
self-report measures. 
 
Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2; Garner, 1991) 
This questionnaire is commonly used to assess behaviours and psychological traits associated 
with eating disorder psychopathology. It has 11 subscales; three which assess eating-related 
symptoms (drive for thinness, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction) and eight which are 
associated with eating-related psychological features common in eating disorders 
(ineffectiveness, perfectionism, interpersonal distrust, interoceptive awareness, maturity 
fears, asceticism, impulse regulation, and social insecurity). In the current study, the drive for 
thinness and bulimia subscales were used to measure eating disorder psychopathology. The 
body dissatisfaction, perfectionism and interpersonal distrust subscales were also used. 
Responses are rated on a 6-point Likert scale anchored from ‘never’ to ‘always’ and a higher 
score indicates a higher level of eating disorder psychopathology. All the subscales have 
previously been found to have good reliability among patients with an eating disorder and the 
general population (e.g., Nevonen, Clinton, & Norring, 2006). In the current study, the 
Cronbach alpha values were as follows: drive for thinness (α=.85), bulimia (α=.83), body 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   11 
 
dissatisfaction (α=.85), perfectionism (α=.70) and interpersonal distrust (α=.80), showing that 
all had good reliability.  
 
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965)  
This is a 10-item self-report measure that assesses self-esteem using a 4-point Likert scale 
(‘strongly agree’ = 3 to ‘strongly disagree’ = 0). It produces a global score, which is 
calculated by summing the scores from the individual items. A high score indicates a higher 
self-esteem (highest possible score is 30). The measure has been validated and has excellent 
reliability (α=0.88-0.90; Robins, Hendin, & Trzesniewski, 2001). In the current study, the 
reliability was also excellent (α=.92).  
 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983)  
This measure has 14 items in total, seven which relate to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven which 
relate to depression (HADS-D). The HADS-A and HADS-D subscale scores are calculated 
by summing scores from the individual items. Participants are asked to rate their responses on 
a 4-point Likert Scale (‘not at all’ = 1 to ‘most of the time’ = 3). For each subscale, scores 
between 0-7 are considered normal, scores between 8-10 are considered borderline clinical, 
and scores of 11 and above are considered clinically relevant (Snaith, 2003). The highest 
score possible is 21 for each subscale. The measure has good reliability in somatic, 
psychiatric and primary care patients as well as in the general population (Bjelland, Dahl, 
Haug, & Neckelmann, 2002). In the current study, both the anxiety (α=.84) and depression 
(α=.77) subscales had good reliability.  
 
Data analysis  
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   12 
 
Data were analysed using SPSS 23 (IBM, 2015). The data were not normally distributed and 
therefore non-parametric tests were used when possible. Missing data were excluded using 
the pairwise method apart from in the Mann-Whitney U analysis where the test-by-test 
method was employed. Before the main analysis, descriptive analysis was conducted. For the 
first aim, a Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to determine whether there was a difference 
in eating disorder psychopathology between people who had taken CHT and those who had 
not. For the second aim, preliminary one-tailed Spearman Rho correlations were conducted 
between the dependent variables (drive for thinness and bulimia) and independent variables 
(age, gender assigned at birth, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, 
interpersonal distrust and perfectionism). As categorical variables cannot be entered into 
correlational analysis, a dummy variable was created for gender assigned at birth. The 
function of the Spearman’s Rho correlations was to determine which variables significantly 
correlated with the dependent variables and, consequently, to include only these variables in 
subsequent regression analysis to increase its robustness. Multicollinearity was not a cause 
for concern as no variable correlated at r ≥ .90 with the outcome variables (Pallant, 2010). As 
multiple comparisons were conducted, Bonferroni corrections were used for the correlation 
analysis (.05 ÷ 16 = .003). To determine which variables were able to explain the most 
variance in eating disorder psychopathology (drive for thinness and bulimia) in people who 
were yet to take CHT, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted. Once the 
risk factors had been established an ANCOVA was conducted to determine whether there 
was a significant difference in eating disorder symptoms between people who were and were 
not on CHT after controlling for the risk factors identified in the multiple linear regression 
analysis. For the third aim, mediation analysis was conducted to better understand the 
mechanisms that underlie the relationship between the independent variable (hypothesised to 
be body dissatisfaction) and eating disorder psychopathology (drive for thinness and 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   13 
 
bulimia). Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro in SPSS (Hayes, 
2013). Model 4, which uses the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval method, was 
employed. The level of significance used for all the analysis was p<.05.

Results  
Aim 1: Differences in eating disorder psychopathology between people who were on 
cross-sex hormones and those who were not 
A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to determine whether participants who were (n=139) 
and were not (n=416) on CHT differed in levels of drive for thinness and bulimia. The 
analysis demonstrated that transgender people who were not on CHT reported significantly 
higher levels of drive for thinness and bulimia compared to participants who were on CHT 
(see Table 2).  
 
Mann-Whitney U tests also showed that people who were not on CHT were significantly 
younger, had higher levels of body dissatisfaction and interpersonal distrust, more symptoms 
of anxiety and depression, and lower levels of self-esteem than participants who were on 
CHT (see Table 2). There was no significant difference in levels of perfectionism between 
the two groups. A Pearson Chi-Squared test was conducted to explore differences in gender 
assigned at birth based on CHT use and this test was not significant (χ2 (1) =3.01, p=.083) 
suggesting that gender assigned at birth is independent of CHT.  
 
Insert Table 2 here 
 
Aim 2: Risk factors of eating disorder psychopathology in people who were not on CHT 
Drive for thinness: Body dissatisfaction, high levels of perfectionism, the experience of 
interpersonal distrust, symptoms of anxiety and depression and low self-esteem were all 
significantly correlated with drive for thinness in people who were not on CHT (n=416; see 
Table 3) and were therefore entered into the subsequent stepwise regression analysis. 
 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   15 
 
Insert Table 3 here 
 
Overall, the stepwise regression model was significant and the significant variables explained 
30% of the total variance of drive for thinness (see Table 4). Higher levels of body 
dissatisfaction made the largest contribution to the variance followed by high levels of 
perfectionism and anxiety symptoms (see Table 4). The average VIF (variance inflation 
factor) for this model was 1.10 and the average tolerance was 0.91. The average VIF was not 
greater than 10 (Myers, 1990) and the average tolerance was not below 0.10 (Menard, 1995), 
which indicates that the assumptions of multicollinearity for this model were met and hence 
the variables were not too highly correlated.  
 
Bulimia: Body dissatisfaction, high levels of perfectionism, the experience of interpersonal 
distrust, symptoms of anxiety and depression and low self-esteem were all significantly 
correlated with bulimia in people who were not on cross-sex hormones (n=416; see Table 3). 
These six variables were therefore entered into a subsequent stepwise regression model. 
Overall, this model was significant and explained 25% of the total variance in bulimia (see 
Table 4). Low self-esteem made the largest contribution to the variance, followed by high 
levels of perfectionism, body dissatisfaction and symptoms of anxiety (see Table 4). The 
average VIF for this model was 1.38 and the average tolerance was 0.75 indicating that there 
is no multicollinearity within the model (Menard, 1995; Myers, 1990). 
 
Insert Table 4 here 
After determining the risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology in people yet to 
commence cross-sex hormones (n=416), an ANCOVA was conducted to determine whether 
there was a significant difference in eating disorder psychopathology between people who 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   16 
 
were (n=139) and were not (n=416) on CHT, after controlling for the identified risk factors. 
It was found that there was no longer a significant difference in drive for thinness between 
people who were and were not on CHT when body dissatisfaction, perfectionism and 
symptoms of anxiety were controlled for (F(1, 538) = .35, p=.885). It was also found that 
there was no longer a significant difference in levels of bulimia between people who were 
and were not on cross-sex hormones after self-esteem, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction 
and symptoms of anxiety were controlled for (F(1, 529) =.03, p=.868). 
 
Aim 3: Exploring the mediators of the relationship between risk factors and eating 
disorder psychopathology in people who were not on CHT  
In addressing aim 2, it was found that high levels of body dissatisfaction were a risk factor 
for both drive for thinness and bulimia. Due to the centrality of body dissatisfaction in both 
gender incongruence (e.g., Jones et al., 2016, van de Grift et al., 2016, 2017) and eating 
disorders (e.g., Stice & Shaw, 2002), mediators of the relationship between body 
dissatisfaction and eating disorder psychopathology were explored for people who had not 
yet commenced CHT (n=416). The remaining risk factors identified in aim 2 were explored 
as mediators (perfectionism, symptoms of anxiety and self-esteem). Mediation occurs when 
the bootstrapped lower and upper confidence intervals do not include zero.  
 
Perfectionism (model 1) and symptoms of anxiety (model 2) were explored separately as 
mediators of the relationship between body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. Self-esteem 
(model 3), perfectionism (model 4) and anxiety (model 5) were explored separately as 
mediators of the relationship between body dissatisfaction and bulimia. Figure 1 
demonstrates the five different models analysed through the direct and indirect effects. As 
can be seen by the unstandardized beta model coefficients (a, b, c) in Table 5, X (the 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   17 
 
independent variable; body dissatisfaction) always significantly predicted M (the mediator) 
depicted by pathway (a), and M always significantly predicted Y (the outcome variable; 
drives for thinness or bulimia) depicted by pathway (b), in all five models analysed. The 
direct effect (X-Y; depicted by pathway c) was also significant in all models (see Table 5). 
For the indirect effect, a bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval based on 5000 bootstrap 
sample was explored. As the bootstrapped lower and upper confidence intervals did not 
include zero it can be concluded that perfectionism (model 1) and symptoms of anxiety 
(model 2) each significantly mediated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and drive 
for thinness. This indicates that the relationship between body dissatisfaction and drive for 
thinness can be explained by the presence of perfectionism and anxiety symptoms. In 
addition, self-esteem (model 3), perfectionism (model 4) and symptoms of anxiety (model 5) 
each mediated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and bulimia (see Table 5). This 
indicates that the relationship between body dissatisfaction and bulimia can be explained by 
the low self-esteem, perfectionism and anxiety symptoms.

Discussion 
This study aimed to understand the risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology within 
the transgender population, as well as the role of CHT in eating disorder psychopathology. 
The current study found that transgender people who were on CHT had significantly lower 
levels of eating disorder symptoms than transgender people who were not. When comparing 
this finding to previous literature, people within the current study who were on CHT 
presented with similar levels of eating disorder psychopathology compared to the general 
population (Witcomb et al., 2015). In contrast, transgender people in the current study who 
were not on CHT presented with higher levels of eating psychopathology than is found 
within the general population (Witcomb et al., 2015). When the current study’s finding and 
previous research are considered together, it suggests that CHT may be able to alleviate 
eating disorder psychopathology, which is in keeping with previous research (Fisher et al., 
2014; Khoosal et al., 2009) and case studies (Couturier et al., 2015; Winston et al., 2004) that 
have supported the notion that eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people is 
secondary to gender incongruence.  
 
This study is novel in that it aimed to understand why CHT might alleviate eating disorder 
symptoms by exploring risk factors in transgender people yet to undergo a medical transition. 
The current study found that high levels of body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, symptoms of 
anxiety, and low self-esteem were all risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology as 
reported in the cisgender literature (e.g., Brechan & Kvalem, 2013; Dakanalis et al., 2016; 
Egan et al., 2011; Fairburn et al., 2003; Keel et al., 1997; Puccio et al., 2017; Tchanturia et 
al., 2016). Once the identified risk factors for eating disorder psychopathology were 
controlled for, there was no longer a significant difference in eating disorder symptoms 
between people who were and were not on CHT. This finding suggests that CHT alleviates 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   19 
 
eating disorder symptoms as it reduces levels of body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, 
symptoms of anxiety and increases self-esteem.  
 
Within the cisgender literature, body dissatisfaction has been described as a core feature of – 
though not sufficient to adequately explain - eating disorder symptoms (Polivy & Herman, 
2002) and, consequently, other factors have been found to mediate the relationship between 
body dissatisfaction and eating disorder psychopathology (e.g., Brechan & Kvalem, 2015; 
DeBoer & Smits, 2013; Fairburn et al., 2003; Harrison et al., 2009). This also appears to be 
the case within the transgender population as the current study found high levels of 
perfectionism and symptoms of anxiety to mediate the relationship between body 
dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. Additionally, low self-esteem, high levels of 
perfectionism and symptoms of anxiety were found to mediate the relationship between body 
dissatisfaction and bulimia in transgender individuals. These findings help to clarify the 
mechanisms through which CHT might be able to alleviate eating disorder symptoms. They 
suggest that CHT primarily alleviates high body dissatisfaction, which in turn reduces levels 
of perfectionism and symptoms of anxiety, and increases self-esteem. In combination, these 
factors then appear to alleviate eating disorder symptoms. This is the first study with 
transgender people that has been able to indicate how cross-sex hormones alleviate eating 
disorder symptoms, although this finding needs to be replicated with longitudinal research.  
 
Clinicians working in eating disorder services should routinely assess gender identity issues 
as this is where transgender people may first present due to experiencing high levels of body 
dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms that are secondary to gender incongruence. 
Such patients should be referred to transgender health services as this study has shown the 
positive role that CHT plays in eating disorder symptoms. CHT is likely to be more effective 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   20 
 
than interventions offered at eating disorder services in these circumstances (Ewan, 
Middleman, & Feldmann, 2014). However, there are likely to be a small number of patients 
that also require eating-related interventions. To determine whether this is suitable, the role of 
eating disorder psychopathology will need to be assessed. In our clinical experience, the 
presence of eating disorder psychopathology, such as food restriction, is engaged in to stop 
the development of secondary sex characteristics that are related to the individual’s assigned 
gender, such as breast development or menstruation. However, in some cases, CHT alone 
may not be enough to reduce eating disorder psychopathology and clinicians at transgender 
health and eating disorder services may need to work together to alleviate eating disorder 
psychopathology whilst also facilitating access to gender affirming medical interventions.  
 
When patients are referred to transgender health services with symptoms of eating disorders, 
clinicians might be reluctant to accept such patients onto the treatment programme until these 
issues are resolved. The findings of the current study indicate that for patients presenting with 
high levels of eating disorder symptoms (that are secondary to gender identity issues), timely 
initiation of CHT may likely reduce these symptoms, as well as their gender incongruence. 
Given the existence of significant barriers to accessing transgender health care (Bouman & 
Richards, 2013; Jones et al., 2017; Kanamori & Cornelius-White, 2016; Scheim, Zong, 
Giblon, & Bauer, 2017), it is imperative that access to these services is increased to minimise 
the risk of eating disorder psychopathology. In addition, although gender affirming medical 
interventions alleviate 
body 
dissatisfaction 
(a core 
feature 
of 
eating 
disorder 
psychopathology) for many, patients who report very high body dissatisfaction pre-gender 
affirming medical interventions have been found to continue to do so post-gender affirming 
medical interventions (van de Grift et al., 2017). Clinicians at transgender health services 
must consider that these patients (who report high body dissatisfaction post-gender affirming 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   21 
 
interventions) may be vulnerable to eating disorder psychopathology and therefore may 
require eating-related interventions.  
 
Within the current study, neither age or gender (assigned at birth) were found to be risk 
factors for eating disorder psychopathology within treatment seeking transgender people who 
were yet to commence CHT. This contrasts with research within the cisgender population 
which has found adolescents and young adult females to be at greater risk than males and 
older people (e.g., Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Zeiler et al., 2016) and was despite the current 
study finding that people who were yet to commence CHT were significantly younger (and 
reported more eating disorder symptoms) than people who had initiated CHT. Previous 
research with transgender people has found transgender men (assigned female at birth) to 
report very high levels of body dissatisfaction (a common feature of eating disorder 
psychopathology) that were comparable to cisgender men with an eating disorder (Witcomb 
et al., 2015). This finding was not replicated when transgender women were compared to 
cisgender women with an eating disorder (Witcomb et al., 2015). Therefore, although gender 
may not be a risk factor for eating disorder symptoms within the transgender population, 
clinicians in both eating disorder and transgender health services should be mindful that 
levels of body dissatisfaction among people assigned female at birth may mean that the 
prevalence of eating disorder symptoms is higher than in people assigned male at birth.  
 
For the first time, the current study has identified multiple risk factors for eating disorder 
psychopathology within a large sample of treatment seeking transgender people. In addition 
to this, the alleviating role that CHT plays in eating disorder symptoms has been recognised. 
This is in contrast to previous research, which has found levels of eating disorder symptoms 
in the transgender population to be higher than in the general population without 
 Eating disorder psychopathology in transgender people  
European Eating Disorders Review   22 
 
understanding why (Witcomb et al., 2015). However, the following limitations should be 
considered. First, this study is cross-sectional and therefore causality cannot be determined. 
Risk factors need to be explored with further longitudinal research. Second, the group sizes 
within the comparative analysis were different which might have impacted on the findings. 
Finally, analysis was conducted in relation to gender assigned at birth. The majority of 
transgender people will transition within the binary gender system (i.e., man or woman) but 
there are increasing numbers of transgender people who identify outside the binary gender 
system (i.e., gender neutral, non-gender, bigender, third gender) or are fluid with their gender 
identity (Arcelus & Bouman, 2017a). Therefore, future research should be concerned with 
transgender people who identify as a woman, a man, and outside the binary gender system.  
 
In conclusion, transgender people who were not on CHT reported more eating disorder 
symptoms than transgender people who were on CHT. The findings suggest that CHT may be 
able to alleviate eating disorder symptoms primarily through positively impacting on body 
dissatisfaction (i.e., increasing body satisfaction) which, in turn, reduces levels of 
perfectionism and symptoms of anxiety and increases self-esteem. Clinicians working at 
eating disorder services should incorporate the assessment of gender identity issues within 
their clinical practice and refer patients with such issues to transgender health services so that 
they can be evaluated for CHT.

Note: CHT (cross-sex hormone treatment); †People who had only taken blockers (and not 
CHT) were excluded from the cross-sex hormones group as in contrast to CHT; hormone 
blockers do not affect secondary sex characteristics. Based on this, these people were 
included within the no cross-sex hormone group.
