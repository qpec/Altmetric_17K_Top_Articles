C
ardiac rehabilitation (CR) is integral to the optimal 
medical care of patients with coronary heart disease 
(CHD).1,2 Physical exercise, medical management of ele-
vated blood pressure and lipids, nutritional counseling, and 
smoking cessation are core components of CR in this coun-
try. Although no single study has demonstrated definitively 
that exercise improves clinical outcomes in CHD patients, 
a recent meta-analysis concluded that CR reduces cardio-
vascular mortality and hospitalizations and improves qual-
ity of life.3
Clinical Perspective on p 1350
Stress management training (SMT) is not routinely 
included as a component of CR programs, despite mount-
ing epidemiological evidence that elevated levels of stress 
are associated with greater risk of death and nonfatal 
cardiac events.4–6 The fact that SMT is not offered may be 
the result of inconsistencies in the literature on the relation-
ship between stress and CHD, a lack of consensus about 
how stress is defined and measured, uncertainty about what 
approach is most effective, and limited support for the effec-
tiveness of SMT in reducing stress and in improving clinical 
outcomes in patients with CHD.7 We previously found that 
CHD patients with mental stress–induced myocardial isch-
emia receiving either SMT or exercise training had better 
clinical outcomes compared with control subjects receiving 
usual care8 and that SMT and exercise each produced com-
parable improvements in psychological functioning, as well 
as greater improvements in CHD biomarkers, compared with 
control subjects receiving usual care.9 Although these find-
ings are encouraging, the added value of combining SMT 
with exercise training was not assessed. Stand-alone SMT 
Background—Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the standard of care for patients with coronary heart disease. Despite 
considerable epidemiological evidence that high stress is associated with worse health outcomes, stress management 
training (SMT) is not included routinely as a component of CR.
Methods and Results—One hundred fifty-one outpatients with coronary heart disease who were 36 to 84 years of age were 
randomized to 12 weeks of comprehensive CR or comprehensive CR combined with SMT (CR+SMT), with assessments 
of stress and coronary heart disease biomarkers obtained before and after treatment. A matched sample of CR-eligible 
patients who did not receive CR made up the no-CR comparison group. All participants were followed up for up to 5.3 years 
(median, 3.2 years) for clinical events. Patients randomized to CR+SMT exhibited greater reductions in composite stress 
levels compared with those randomized to CR alone (P=0.022), an effect that was driven primarily by improvements in 
anxiety, distress, and perceived stress. Both CR groups achieved significant, and comparable, improvements in coronary 
heart disease biomarkers. Participants in the CR+SMT group exhibited lower rates of clinical events compared with those 
in the CR-alone group (18% versus 33%; hazard ratio=0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.95; P=0.035), and both 
CR groups had lower event rates compared with the no-CR group (47%; hazard ratio=0.44; 95% confidence interval, 
0.27–0.71; P<0.001).
Conclusions—CR enhanced by SMT produced significant reductions in stress and greater improvements in medical 
outcomes compared with standard CR. Our findings indicate that SMT may provide incremental benefit when combined 
with comprehensive CR and suggest that SMT should be incorporated routinely into CR.

interventions also may have limited real-world relevance 
because such treatments are often not available in traditional 
disease-management programs.
The present study was designed to evaluate the potential 
incremental benefit of SMT when combined with comprehen-
sive CR on a composite measure of psychological stress and 
CHD biomarkers of risk. In addition, we examined the impact 
of CR in the CR-alone and CR+SMT groups compared with 
a nonrandomized, matched-comparison group of CR-eligible 
patients who elected not to participate in CR (no-CR group) 
on adverse clinical events over a follow-up period of up to 5.3 
years.
Methods
Eligibility and Trial Overview
Enhancing Cardiac Rehabilitation With Stress Management 
Training in Patients With Heart Disease (ENHANCED) was an 
efficacy trial examining the effects of SMT when added to com-
prehensive CR on self-reported stress, CHD biomarkers, and clini-
cal outcomes. Participants underwent baseline measurement of 
stress, traditional CHD risk factors, and CHD biomarkers and were 
randomly assigned to either comprehensive CR or comprehensive 
CR enhanced by SMT (CR+SMT). Participants were reassessed 
at the completion of the 12-week program and were followed up 
for clinical events for a median of 3.2 years (range, 0.1–5.3 years). 
Assessors were blinded to patients’ treatment group assignment at 
the time of posttreatment assessments, and end points were adjudi-
cated without knowledge of patients’ treatment. The primary end 
point was a composite psychometric measure of stress. Secondary 
outcomes included CHD biomarkers and adverse cardiovascular 
events. A nonrandom sample of CR-eligible CHD patients formed a 
comparison group for the purpose of determining the event rates for 
patients with similar demographic and clinical characteristics who 
elected not to participate in CR.
This study was supported by grant HL093374 from the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the sponsor had no involvement in 
the design of the study; the collection, analysis, and interpretation 
of the data; or in the decision to approve publication of the finished 
manuscript.
Participants
Outpatients with stable CHD were referred for CR by their personal 
physicians and underwent medical screening examinations to con-
firm eligibility. Indications for CR included recent acute coronary 
syndrome, stable angina with angiographic evidence of coronary dis-
ease, and recent coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention). Exclusion cri-
teria included surgery primarily for valve replacement or repair, heart 
transplantation, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, and unrevas-
cularized left main stenosis >50%. The protocol was approved by 
the respective Institutional Review boards at Duke University and 
the University of North Carolina, and written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. The first patient was randomized on 
April 6, 2010, and the last date for medical event adjudication was 
July 15, 2015.
Assessment Procedures
Psychological Stress
A global stress measure was the primary outcome, combining the fol-
lowing components with the use of a mean rank constructed sepa-
rately for each measure at baseline and following treatment10:
Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)11: The 21-item BDI-II is a 
widely used measure of depression. Scores range from 0 to 63, with 
higher scores suggesting greater depressive symptoms. Scores ≥14 
are suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms.
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)12: The 20-item STAI 
was used to assess levels of state anxiety. Scores range from 20 
to 80; scores ≥40 suggest clinically significant anxiety in medical 
patients.13
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS) Anger14: The 8-item PROMIS Anger scale assesses sev-
eral dimensions of anger. Scores range from 8 to 40, with higher 
scores indicating greater anger.
General 
Health 
Questionnaire15: 
The 
General 
Health 
Questionnaire is a 12-item measure of general distress. Scores range 
from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating greater emotional distress.
Perceived Stress Scale16: The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale 
assesses general distress and perceived ability to adequately cope 
with current life stressors. Scores range from 0 to 40, with higher 
scores indicate greater perceived stress.
Exercise Tolerance and Physical Activity
Exercise Treadmill Testing
Patients exercised to exhaustion or other standard end points 
under continuous electrocardiographic monitoring with a 
ramped Bruce protocol.17
Accelerometry
Physical activity during daily life was quantified by record-
ing the number of steps on 2 successive days with the Kentz 
Lifecorder Plus accelerometer NL-2160 (LC; Suzuken Co 
Ltd, Nagoya Japan).
Leisure-Time Physical Activity
Participants completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise 
Questionnaire18 in which they indicated the number of times 
they engaged in mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise for 
>15 minutes.
Blood Lipids
Lipids were measured enzymatically from fasting blood samples 
(LabCorp Inc, Burlington, NC). 
CHD Biomarkers of Inflammation and Autonomic Function
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was quantified by ELISA. 
Values >10 mg/L were truncated at 10 to account for acute 
inflammatory processes that may have skewed the distribution 
of this blood marker.
Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity were 
obtained from beat-to-beat heart rate and blood pressure 
recorded from patients in the supine position with a Nexfin 
noninvasive blood pressure monitor (Nexfin model 1, 
BMEYE BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).19 Heart rate 
variability was assessed from R-R interval changes elicited 
during a 100-second controlled breathing task and during 5 
minutes of normal relaxed breathing by estimating power 
spectra with the Welch algorithm.20 Baroreflex sensitivity also 
was estimated during this 5-minute resting condition with the 
use of cross-spectral analysis to estimate the magnitude of the 
transfer function relating R-R interval oscillations to systolic 
blood pressure oscillations across the 0.07- to 0.1299-Hz, or 
low-frequency, band.
Medical End Points
Patients documented all medical encounters annually up to 5 years 
after enrollment. Medical records were reviewed, and events, cat-
egorized on the basis of American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association criteria,21 were adjudicated by a physician assistant 
and a study cardiologist blinded to treatment condition. The following 
medical events were included: all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal

 Blumenthal et al  Stress Management and Cardiac Rehabilitation  1343
myocardial infarction (MI), coronary or peripheral artery revascular-
ization, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and unstable angina requir-
ing hospitalization.
Interventions
Patients were randomized to either comprehensive CR alone or 
CR+SMT. All patients were followed up medically by their local car-
diologists or primary care physicians, who were blinded to treatment 
condition and who managed any episodes of escalating symptoms or 
evidence of disease progression.
Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation
Patients participated in CR at Duke University’s Center for Living 
(n=113) and the University of North Carolina’s Wellness Center 
in Chapel Hill (n=38). Comprehensive CR programs are similar 
throughout the state of North Carolina; patients engage in aerobic 
exercise 3 times a week for 35 minutes at a level of 70% to 85% of 
their heart rate reserve as determined at the time of their initial exer-
cise treadmill test. Patients also received education about CHD, nutri-
tional counseling based on American Heart Association guidelines, 
and 2 classes devoted to the role of stress in CHD.
SMT-Enhanced CR
Patients in the CR+SMT group received the identical compre-
hensive CR intervention plus SMT. SMT was adapted from our 
previous work,8,9 which combined education, group support, and 
cognitive-behavior therapy. The intervention was delivered in 12 
weekly 1.5-hour sessions in groups of 4 to 8 participants. The SMT 
intervention is based on a cognitive-behavioral model in which 
stress is conceptualized as an imbalance between high demands 
(often environmental but also can be self-imposed) and more 
limited coping resources. Therefore, the intervention is directed 
at reducing demands and increasing coping abilities. The initial 
sessions are designed to establish rapport, to promote group cohe-
sion and social support, and to provide a scientific basis for the 
importance of stress as a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular 
events. Strategies for reducing demands, including prioritizing, 
time management, establishing personal values, and avoiding 
stress-producing situations, are presented. Subsequent sessions 
focus on modifying responses to situations that cannot be read-
ily changed. Several sessions are devoted to training in progres-
sive muscle relaxation techniques and the use of visual imagery to 
reduce stress. Emphasis is placed on the importance of cognitive 
appraisals in affecting stress responses, with recognition of irra-
tional beliefs and cognitive distortions such as overgeneralization, 
catastrophizing, and all-or-nothing thinking. Later sessions focus 
on the importance of effective communication, including topics 
of assertiveness and anger management. Instruction in problem-
solving strategies is also provided in which participants are encour-
aged to apply the skills that they have learned to address everyday 
problems. Methods included brief lectures, group discussion, role 
playing, instruction in specific behavioral skills, and weekly home-
work assignments.
Nonrandomized, No-CR Comparison Group 
To estimate the impact of CR, with and without SMT, on clinical 
outcomes, we collected medical event data for comparison with indi-
viduals who were referred to CR during the same time period as the 
CR-alone and CR+SMT participants but who elected not to partici-
pate. Eligible patients were stratified on the basis of age, sex, history 
of MI, and date of referral. A total of 886 patients whose geographical 
location would have enabled them to participate in CR at Duke or 
University of North Carolina through CR referral records were identi-
fied, from whom 75 were randomly selected, within strata by research 
personnel blinded to patients’ medical outcome data. Patients found 
to have enrolled in CR elsewhere also were excluded, although par-
ticipation in self-initiated physical activity or stress reduction (eg, 
psychotherapy) was permitted.
Statistical Analysis
Treatment effects were evaluated with general linear models 
adjusted for baseline through SAS 9.2 (PROC GLM, SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC). For our primary analysis of change in stress, a preplanned 
rank-based global measure of stress was created with the use of the 
BDI-II, General Health Questionnaire, STAI, PROMIS Anger, and 
Perceived Stress Scale scores. In this approach, the global measure 
was created by ranking each participant on each individual stress 
measure at baseline and after treatment.10 A mean rank score was 
created by averaging across all stress measures at pretreatment 
and after treatment. Treatment effects were analyzed following the 
intention-to-treat principle, with posttreatment missing data (<5%) 
managed with multiple imputation methods available in SAS (PROC 
MI). We first examined changes in our global stress outcome and, if 
significant, explored changes in individual components of the stress 
composite in a secondary explanatory step.22 Our primary interest 
was not so much to identify which component is important but rather 
to assess the effectiveness of treatment on a single, global measure of 
stress based on the elements making up the stress construct. We did 
not correct for multiple components because, as noted by Tandon,23 
the Bonferroni correction fails to make efficient use of the collec-
tive data, especially when one expects several measures (eg, stress, 
anger, depression, anxiety) to behave similarly and there is no a 
priori reason to believe that one of these measures would be more 
significant than another. Analyses of treatment changes in CHD bio-
markers, lipids, and aerobic fitness/physical activity were conducted 
with the posttreatment value used as the outcome variable, control-
ling for the respective pretreatment level, with group assignment as 
the predictor of interest. In these analyses, a Bonferroni correction 
was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons separately within 
each outcome domain (ie, CHD biomarkers, lipids, and aerobic fit-
ness/physical activity).
For analysis of clinical events, we evaluated the effects of treat-
ment using Cox proportional hazards model (PROC PHREG) with 
dummy coding constructed to compare the CR, CR+SMT, and non-
randomized no-CR comparison groups. To account for potential treat-
ment differences in important medical predictors of clinical events, 
we controlled for age, heart failure, and treatment site in our models. 
Within our analyses of clinical event models, the first event after ran-
domization was coded as the event, and those participants with no 
events or who dropped out were censored at the time of last contact. 
We also examined the impact of treatment on clinical events among 
CR+SMT and CR-alone participants compared with the no-CR 
group. We evaluated the extent to which models met assumptions, 
including additivity, linearity, proportional hazards, and distribution 
of residuals. A priori power estimates suggested that we would have 
80% power to detect a 0.47-SD difference in the stress composite 
between the CR+SMT and CR-alone groups.
Results
Participant Flow
Figure 1 displays the flow of participants during the trial. Of 
the 577 individuals who were considered for CR, 164 met ini-
tial inclusion criteria and 151 were randomized: 75 to compre-
hensive CR and 76 to CR+SMT.
Medical outcome data also were obtained for 75 individu-
als who were referred to CR but, for a variety of reasons (eg, 
inconvenient, too busy, preferred to exercise on their own, not 
interested), elected not to participate in CR (no-CR).
Participant Characteristics
Demographic, background, and medical characteristics of 
the CR groups and no-CR patients are shown in Table 1. The 
treatment groups were similar on background clinical and 
demographic characteristics and were similar to the no-CR 
comparison group.

Treatment Adherence
Exercise attendance was similar for both CR groups. 
Participants in CR alone and CR+SMT each completed a 
mean of 33 of a possible 36 exercise sessions (92% atten-
dance). Attendance at SMT classes was excellent, with partici-
pants attending a median of 11 of 12 sessions. Six participants 
(4%) did not complete the treatment protocol: 3 from CR and 
3 from CR+SMT.
We used a modified version of the Morisky Adherence 
Scale24 to assess medication adherence before and after 
the 12-week CR program, with scores ranging from 0 to 7. 
Participants in CR-alone and CR+SMT were very adherent 
on study entry: 95% indicated that they never or rarely missed 
taking their heart medications. Adherence was maintained 
over the 12 weeks, and there was no difference in adher-
ence between the 2 groups after treatment (CR+SMT=0.30, 
CR-alone=0.36; P=0.52).
Effects of Treatment on Stress
Time and treatment changes for the stress measures are 
presented in Table 2, adjusted for the pretreatment level 
of each outcome. Both CR groups showed reductions on 
each stress component after treatment (P≤0.001). A treat-
ment group main effect was observed for the global stress 
score in which the CR+SMT group showed greater reduc-
tions compared with the CR-alone group (P=0.022). In sec-
ondary explanatory analyses, we found that the CR+SMT 
group showed greater improvements in anxiety (STAI; 
P=0.025) and distress (General Health Questionnaire; 
P=0.049) and tended to show greater reductions in per-
ceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale; P=0.063) compared 
with the CR-alone group. The univariate analyses of the 
stress components were not corrected and serve as a guide 
to interpretation of the global test results. Of note, 34 
individuals exhibited clinically elevated levels of depres-
sion before treatment (ie, BDI-II ≥14) and 48 individu-
als reported clinically significant levels of anxiety (STAI 
≥40). In supplementary analyses among this depressed 
subgroup, individuals in the CR+SMT group exhibited 
14.0-point reduction (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2–
18.8) on the BDI-II, compared with reductions of 7.8 (95% 
CI, 2.7–12.9) points in the CR group (P=0.07). Individuals 
with high anxiety in the CR+SMT group reported a 14.2-
point reduction (95% CI, 9.6–18.8) compared with a 9.8-
point (95% CI, 5.4–14.2) reduction in the CR-alone group 
(P=0.18).
CHD Biomarkers, Lipids, and Exercise Capacity/
Physical Activity
CR, alone and combined with SMT, was associated with sig-
nificant improvements in CHD biomarkers, lipids, and exer-
cise capacity/physical activity during daily life. However, 
there were no treatment group differences on any of the mea-
sures (Table 3).
Comparison of Clinical Events in the CR-Alone and 
CR+SMT Groups
Thirty-nine participants (26%) experienced a clinical event 
over a follow-up period of up to 5.3 years (median, 3.2 
years; interquartile range, 2.2, 4.3 years; Table 4). Time-to-
event models demonstrated that participants randomized 
to CR+SMT experienced a lower event rate (18%) com-
pared with individuals randomized to CR (33%; hazard ratio 
[HR]=0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.91; P=0.03). The estimated opti-
mism for model fit was modest (17%), suggesting minimal 
bias from overfitting.
Comparison of Clinical Events in the CR Groups 
and Matched No-CR Control Subjects
To assess the impact of CR on medical outcomes, we com-
pared patients randomized to the CR-alone and CR+SMT 
groups with the no-CR comparison group, which was 
matched on age, indication for referral to CR, and time of 
referral. The follow-up interval was identical for the CR 
patients and no-CR control subjects. We observed 35 clinical 
events in the no-CR group (47%) compared with 39 in the

Figure 2).
Mediators of CR and Medical Events
We also examined whether reductions in stress levels mediated 
the relationship of CR with clinical events. Greater reductions 
in stress were associated with a lower rate of clinical events 
(HR=0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.99; P=0.048). Controlling for 
reductions in stress attenuated the relationship between treat-
ment group and clinical events (HR=0.59; 95% CI, 0.31–1.14; 
P=0.11), whereas the relationship between stress and clini-
cal events became marginally significant (HR=0.60; 95% CI, 
0.35–1.02; P=0.059), suggesting that reduced stress partially 
mediated the effects of treatment group on clinical outcomes.
Discussion
Although there is substantial epidemiological evidence that 
high levels of stress are associated with worse medical out-
comes,4–6 there is considerably less evidence that interventions 
designed to reduce stress improve those outcomes.25 In the 
present trial, stress management added to comprehensive CR 
resulted in greater reductions in patient-reported stress com-
pared with CR alone. Furthermore, reductions in stress were 
associated with reduced risk of adverse clinical events, with 
an almost 50% reduction in clinical events compared with CR 
without SMT.
Participants in both CR and CR+SMT achieved 
improvements in blood lipids, heart rate variability, inflam-
mation, exercise tolerance, and self-reported leisure-time 
physical activity. In a secondary analysis, we also noted that 
CR was associated with better clinical outcomes relative to

a no-CR comparison group. The overall event rates were 
higher for patients who elected not to engage in CR com-
pared with those receiving CR alone or CR+SMT. These 
findings contrast with results from the recent Rehabilitation 
After Myocardial Infarction Trial (RAMIT) study,26 which 
found that comprehensive CR had no effect on mortality 
or cardiac or psychological morbidity and concluded that 
the evidence for the value of CR was weak. Important dif-
ferences in how CR is practiced in England and the United 
States may explain the discrepant results. In the British 
study, CR was performed weekly for only 6 to 10 weeks, 
whereas in the United States, CR is more intensive. In the 
ENHANCED trial, patients engaged in exercise 3 times 
per week for 12 weeks and participated in nutrition and 
stress classes; patients randomized to the CR+SMT group 
received an additional 1.5 h/wk of group SMT. Although 
patients in the CR+SMT group reported reduced symptoms 
of anxiety, depression, and stress, the stress reduction pro-
gram for the RAMIT trial did not reduce patients’ stress 
levels, which could account for the differences in clinical 
outcomes.
Several other large, randomized, controlled trials 
reported no benefit of SMT compared with usual care in 
reducing stress and improving clinical outcomes. Jones and 
West27 randomized 2328 post-MI patients to 7 weekly ses-
sions of SMT or usual care and followed them up for 12 
months. After 6 months, the prevalence rates of clinical 
anxiety and depression remained high, and there were no 
group differences in levels of anxiety or depression after 
treatment. Moreover, there was no difference between the 
groups in the incidence of MI, cerebrovascular accident, 
heart failure, or revascularizations. Frasure-Smith and col-
leagues28 randomized 1376 post-MI patients to a stress 
management intervention delivered over the telephone or to 
usual care. After treatment, there were no group differences 
in anxiety or depression, nor was there a difference in clini-
cal outcomes. The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart 
Disease Patients (ENRICHD) trial29 examined the benefits of 
a cognitive-behavioral intervention in 2400 post-MI patients 
who were depressed or who reported low social support. 
Results showed a modest 2-point difference in BDI scores in 
the intervention group compared with usual care, and there 
were no differences in the combined end point of all-cause 
mortality and nonfatal reinfarction. These studies also pro-
vided SMT as a sole intervention, without exercise or other 
elements of comprehensive CR. Thus, not all interventions 
designed to reduce stress are successful, and the failure to 
reduce stress may provide one explanation for the failure to 
observe improved medical outcomes.
The ENHANCED trial provided SMT to all patients 
randomized to the CR+SMT intervention, regardless of 
their baseline levels of stress, and did not specifically target 
patients in acute distress or with significant psychopathol-
ogy. Few randomized, controlled trials include only patients 
meeting a clinical threshold for psychological symptoms 
or psychiatric pathology, and in studies with and without 
patients with diagnosed psychopathology, the results are 
often not reported separately.30 Some meta-analyses suggest 
that patients with greater psychopathology at baseline show 
smaller reductions in depression with treatment compared

MI, myocardial infarction; No CR, nonrandomized comparison group who did not participate in cardiac rehabilitation; and TIA, transient ischemic attack.

myocardial infarction, cardiac or peripheral vascular 
intervention, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or 
unstable angina requiring hospitalization. Participants 
in the CR+SMT group were at significantly lower 
risk of clinical events compared with those in the 
CR-alone group (hazard ratio [HR]=0.47; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.24–0.91; P=0.025). Both 
CR groups had lower event rates compared with 
a nonrandomized, matched no-CR control group 
(HR=0.35; 95% CI, 0.22–0.56; P<0.001). Number at

with patients with less psychopathology.30 We found that 
patients with greater stress tended to exhibit larger improve-
ments. For example, depressive symptoms were reduced in 
both the CR and CR+SMT groups, which is not surprising 
given that depressive symptoms are reduced by CR31 and that 
exercise has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in 
patients with major depression,32 stable CHD,33 and heart 
failure.34 Although failing to achieve statistical significance, 
it is noteworthy that in our subset of patients with elevated 
depressive symptoms on study entry, the addition of SMT to 
CR appeared to be especially beneficial. The CR+SMT group 
exhibited a 14-point reduction in BDI-II scores compared 
with an 8-point reduction in the CR-alone group. A 6-point 
difference is considered clinically meaningful and is greater 
than the 2- to 3-point differences observed in placebo-con-
trolled trials of antidepressant medications35–37 and in trials of 
psychotherapy in CHD patients.29
Limitations
Our sample was small, and we observed few hard end points 
(eg, death and nonfatal MI). A larger sample would pro-
vide greater power to detect treatment group differences in 
specific stress components. Although the effect sizes were 
relatively modest, because comprehensive CR alone has 
been shown to produce significant improvements in qual-
ity of life,3 the incremental benefit of SMT to standard 
CR should not be underestimated. In addition, analysis of 
clinical events offered promising evidence for the value of 
CR+SMT in improving clinical outcomes, which will need 
to be confirmed in larger trials. CR participants had better 
clinical outcomes compared with patients who elected not 
to engage in CR. Patients in the no-CR comparison group 
were matched on age, sex, and history of MI; did not dif-
fer on any measured clinical or demographic characteristic; 
and continued to exhibit significantly higher rates of clinical 
events in sensitivity analyses adjusted for age, sex, ejection 
fraction, and medical comorbidities. However, it is possible 
that patients in the nonrandom comparison group may have 
differed from the CR participants in ways that we did not 
measure, which may have contributed to their higher rates 
of clinical events. We used a global measure of stress, com-
bining scores from multiple instruments. Because there is no 
universally accepted single measure of stress, we selected 
well-validated instruments on the basis of epidemiologi-
cal evidence that distress,15,38 depression,39–43 anxiety,44–46 
and anger,47,48 generally subsumed under the term stress, 
are associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes 
in CHD patients. Composite measures of stress have been 
used in other studies,6 but there is still no gold standard for 
measuring stress, and our global measure combines scores 
from well-validated instruments, each with excellent psy-
chometric properties. Adherence to the program was excel-
lent, with few dropouts. Research volunteers may have been 
especially motivated to participate in the program, which 
may limit the generalizability of our findings.
Conclusions
Patients randomized to CR enhanced by SMT had greater 
reductions in stress and had better clinical outcomes compared 
with patients randomized to CR alone. In the same way that 
exercise training does not target only those patients with low 
levels of physical fitness, the present findings indicate that 
SMT could be beneficial for all cardiac patients and suggest 
that SMT should be incorporated into comprehensive CR. A 
multisite effectiveness trial is needed to confirm the applica-
bility of these findings to the larger CR population.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) represents the standard of care for patients with coronary heart disease. Despite considerable 
epidemiological evidence that high levels of stress are associated with worse prognosis, there is limited evidence that reduc-
ing stress improves clinical outcomes. Enhancing Standard Cardiac Rehabilitation With Stress Management Training in 
Patients With Coronary Heart Disease (ENHANCED) was a randomized, clinical trial in which patients referred to CR com-
pleted a psychometric stress battery and underwent evaluation of coronary heart disease biomarkers, including measures of 
endothelial dysfunction, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and inflammation, before and after a 12-week treatment 
program of comprehensive CR alone (n=75) or comprehensive CR enhanced by stress management training (SMT; n=76). 
SMT consisted of 12 weekly 1.5-hour sessions that provided education, group support, and instruction in methods for coping 
more effectively with stress (eg, time management, progressive muscle relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, commu-
nication skills). A nonrandom sample of CR-eligible patients who declined to engage in CR formed a no-CR comparison 
group. Results showed that although both CR groups reported less stress, CR enhanced by SMT achieved greater reductions 
in stress compared with CR alone. Compared with the matched no-CR comparison group, both CR groups had fewer clinical 
events (all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary or peripheral artery revascularization, stroke/
transient ischemic attack, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization). Moreover, combining stress management training 
with CR (ie, CR+SMT) resulted in better clinical outcomes compared with CR alone. These findings confirm the value of 
CR in reducing the risk for adverse clinical events. Furthermore, SMT provided incremental value to standard CR by fur-
ther reducing stress and improving clinical outcomes. Including SMT as a routine component of standard CR, regardless of 
patients’ reported levels of stress, should be encouraged.
