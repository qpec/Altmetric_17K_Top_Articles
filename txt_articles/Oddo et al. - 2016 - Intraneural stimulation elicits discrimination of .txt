Abstract Restoration of touch after hand amputation is a desirable feature of ideal prostheses.
Here, we show that texture discrimination can be artificially provided in human subjects by
implementing a neuromorphic real-time mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT), which emulates to
some extent the firing dynamics of SA1 cutaneous afferents. The MNT process was used to
modulate the temporal pattern of electrical spikes delivered to the human median nerve via
percutaneous microstimulation in four intact subjects and via implanted intrafascicular stimulation in
one transradial amputee. Both approaches allowed the subjects to reliably discriminate spatial
coarseness of surfaces as confirmed also by a hybrid neural model of the median nerve. Moreover,
MNT-evoked EEG activity showed physiologically plausible responses that were superimposable in
time and topography to the ones elicited by a natural mechanical tactile stimulation. These findings
can open up novel opportunities for sensory restoration in the next generation of neuro-prosthetic
hands.

Introduction
One of the most remarkable characteristics of a human hand is its ability to gather a rich variety of
sensory information about the external world. In particular, tactile information conveyed by the four
classes of low-threshold mechanoreceptor afferent units in the fingertips (Johnson et al., 2000;

 Johnson, 2001; Vallbo and Johansson, 1984a; Abraira and Ginty, 2013) is fundamental for manip-
ulation activities (Edin et al., 1992; Edin and Johansson, 1995). In addition, the biological sensors
innervating the glabrous skin can provide complex types of information such as the onset of the con-
tact with an object, the level of performed grasping force, and discrimination of textural features
(Weber et al., 2013; Darian-Smith et al., 1980a).
The possibility of providing natural and rich sensory information to hand prosthesis users repre-
sents a major achievement. In fact, even though a significant research in biology, medicine and engi-
neering has produced artificial hands that progressively approached the performance of a “natural
hand”, it is a shared belief that providing a sense of touch is still the missing milestone (Kwok, 2013).
This achievement will allow the “symbiosis” between the user and interface to become more adap-
tive (to changing tasks and situations), more robust (beyond interfering stimuli), more effective (learn
from the past to anticipate or predict the future), and more natural (rapidly becoming part of the
body scheme). Therefore, the restoration of sensory perception is the crucial step to achieve in the
development of next generation of artificial limbs and hand prostheses, in particular.
Thus far, promising results have been recently achieved to restore information about the touch of
objects (Tan et al., 2014) and also the level of produced grasping force (Raspopovic, 2014). The
restoration of ability to judge textural features represents the next significant step towards the re-
establishment of close-to-natural sensory skills of a natural hand.
Here, we sought to achieve this goal via an integrated approach to mimic natural coding using a
neuromorphic, real-time, mechano-neuro-transduction (Spigler et al., 2012) (MNT) process through
a sensorized artificial finger (Oddo et al., 2011a) that integrates a Micro Electro-Mechanical System
(MEMS) tactile sensor (Beccai et al., 2005). In this framework, the temporal coding of tactile infor-
mation was based on the use of a biologically plausible neural model (Izhikevich, 2003) , which has
shown promise as a versatile and computationally efficient framework for reproducing a wide range
of phenomenological neural responses to stimuli.
In this study, the MNT process was first tested in intact subjects by delivering electrical stimula-
tion to their sensory peripheral nerve fibers during microstimulation via tungsten needle microelectr-
odes (Vallbo et al., 1984b; Torebjo
¨rk et al., 1987). Furthermore, the effects of natural mechanical
eLife digest Our hands provide us with a wide variety of information about our surroundings,
enabling us to detect pain, temperature and pressure. Our sense of touch also allows us to interact
with objects by feeling their texture and solidity. However, completely reproducing a sense of touch
in artificial or prosthetic hands has proven challenging. While commercial prostheses can mimic the
range of movements of natural limbs, even the latest experimental prostheses have only a limited
ability to ‘feel’ the objects being manipulated. Oddo, Raspopovic et al. have now brought this
ability a step closer by exploiting an artificial fingertip and appropriate neural interfaces through
which different textures can be identified.
The initial experiments were performed in four healthy volunteers with intact limbs. Oddo,
Raspopovic et al. connected the artificial fingertip to the volunteers via an electrode inserted into a
nerve in the arm. When moved over a rough surface, sensors in the fingertip produced patterns of
electrical pulses that stimulated the nerve, causing the volunteers to feel like they were touching the
surface. The volunteers were even able to tell the difference between the different surface textures
the artificial fingertip moved across.
The temporary electrodes used in this group of volunteers are unsuitable for use with prosthetic
limbs because they can easily be knocked out of position. Therefore, in a further experiment
involving a volunteer who had undergone an arm amputation a number of years previously, Oddo,
Raspopovic et al. tested an implanted electrode array that could, in principle, remain in place long-
term. This volunteer could also identify the different textures the artificial fingertip touched, with a
slightly higher degree of accuracy than the previous group of intact volunteers. Further studies are
now required to explore the potential of this approach in larger groups of volunteers.

 stimulation at the fingertip and of the MNT-based electrical stimulation were qualitatively compared
in terms of electrophysiological signals elicited in the contralateral sensory cortex of the subjects.
Moreover, we wanted to evaluate whether the results achieved during needle microstimulation
could be translated into experiments, which would be related to the real-time and longer-term use
of hand prostheses. In fact, percutaneous needle microstimulation of peripheral nerves cannot be
used in amputees as part of an effective long-term assistive device because a stable needle-to-fibers
spatial relationship cannot be maintained in a moving limb. Therefore, its use can only be limited to
a single experimental session lasting a few hours at most (Vallbo et al., 2004). Instead, implantable
neural interfaces, such as Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes (TIMEs) (Boretius et al.,
2010) , are surgically positioned and firmly stabilized to adhere to nerve fascicles and do not require
an arm rest compared with needle interfaces. Therefore, implantable neural interfaces are suitable
for long-term implants. In this study, we developed a novel computational model to investigate the
similarities between neural effects, such as in afferent nerve recruitment curves, achieved using
microstimulation with percutaneous needles and with TIME neural interfaces. This comparison
allowed verification of the possibility of extending the results achieved using percutaneous needle
stimulation to TIMEs.
The MNT process was tested in acute conditions in four intact subjects and was validated in a
TIMEs implanted subject with a transradial amputation. For the first time in human hand neuropros-
thetics, these integrated approaches allowed to show that discrimination of textural features can be
reliably provided to users in different experimental conditions using peripheral intraneural electrical
stimulation. The range of tested tactile stimuli in the current work is on the order of millimeters (0.5–
3.0 mm). Thus, these stimuli pertain to the lower boundary (towards the fine region) of stimuli that
are typically classified as coarse (Weber et al., 2013).
Results
Experiments with intact subjects using needle microstimulation of the
median nerve
The MNT process translates surface coarseness into the injection of current pulses into the nerve. It
qualitatively mimics the neuronal activity recorded during human microneurographic experiments
(Oddo et al., 2011b). The MNT approach was initially tested in four intact volunteers using percuta-
neous electrical microstimulation of the median nerve (Vallbo et al., 1984b; Torebjo
¨rk and Ochoa,
1980) (Figure 1a, Figure 2). The participants - without visual or acoustic cues about the stimuli -
were asked to discriminate surface pairs (Figure 1b) that differed in the Spatial Period (SP) of alter-
nating ridges and grooves (gratings), i.e., in the distance between consecutive ridges separated by
grooves (defined in Figure 2a), which was a constant quantity in each half grating (as shown in
Figure 1b).
Via percutaneous electrical neural microstimulation, they reported mechanical sensation pertain-
ing to the palmar side of the first four fingers of the hand. Microstimulation allowed users to reach
discrimination ability above 77% (107/138, Figure 1c, Figure 3a) during a three-alternative forced-
choice (3AFC) psychophysical procedure (Perez et al., 2010; Gibson and Craig, 2005) mediated by
the artificial touch system, which is based on the use of a MEMS sensor embedded into a human-
sized robotic fingertip (Video 1). Confidence analyses indicated that percutaneous electrical micro-
stimulation successfully induced percepts that were used to assess the coarseness of textured surfa-
ces (Figure 3b). The capability to discriminate between the two sides of the surface pairs was
correlated with the difference between their spatial periods (Figure 3c).
As described hereafter, the comparison between the EEG activity that was evoked by the natural
mechanical tactile stimulation of the real fingertip in the right hand and the one evoked by the sub-
stitutive electrical stimulation showed no significant differences in source topography, response tim-
ing, and clustering of cortical connections between the two stimulation modalities. Event-related
potentials (Figure 4a) after substitutive electrical (n = 4, estimated power 0.75, Figure 4—figure
supplement 2) and natural mechanical stimulation (n = 4, estimated power 0.79, Figure 4—figure
supplement 3) conditions did not reveal any statistical difference (Montecarlo statistics with cluster

Duncan’s multiple range test, F(1,6) = 6.48, p<0.05, comparison to the ipsilateral hemisphere) in the
clustering coefficient following the incoming sensory stimulus, regardless of its tactile or substitutive
nature (Figure 4c). Moreover, the generator sources of short-latency components of Somatosensory
Evoked Potentials (SEPs) that were elicited by the substitutive electrical stimulation were localized at
the Postcentral Gyrus (Brodmann Areas 2 and 3), which was consistent with a physiological tactile

functional source separation method (Di Pino et al., 2012).
Translatability from needle microstimulation to TIME-based stimulation
The possibility to translate results from needle microstimulation to TIMEs was investigated by devel-
oping a novel hybrid model (Raspopovic et al.,
2011) of the median nerve (Figure 6) with both
a microneedle and TIME interfaces inserted
inside the nerve trunk (Figure 7, Figure 8). The
model, which takes into account realistic ana-
tomical (Jabaley et al., 1980) and neurophysio-
logical (Vallbo et al., 1984) data, indicated that
the stimulated portion of axonal population (Fig-
ure 7), and, therefore, the type of sensation,
together with the stimulation threshold (statisti-
cally non-different: p>0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test)
were similar for the two interfaces. The range of
electric charge necessary for recruitment in both
cases was comparable (Figure 7, Figure 8).

 percutaneous microstimulation and justified the transition from the acute to implantable interface to
pursue a long-term use.
Experiments with a transradial amputee
The 3AFC psychophysical protocol used during microstimulation experiments was also evaluated
during sessions with subject DAS, a transradial amputee that was implanted with TIMEs (Raspo-
povic, 2014). The sensations elicited by temporal modulation of spiking electrical stimulation of the
median nerve through a single implanted electrode were reported by DAS as pertaining to the pal-
mar side of the index finger of the missing hand and as providing a realistic representation of the
mechanical alternation between ridges and gaps of the experimented gratings (Video 1). DAS
showed to be able to comply with the entire 3AFC psychophysical protocol via neural stimulation,
without any visual input or guidance by the experimenter, and without interruption in each session,
and in 77/80 trials (Figure 1c, Figure 9a) of trials he was able to correctly identify whether the two
sides of the surface had the same SP or which one had a larger SP (Figure 10). This performance
was significant (p<0.05 confidence, Clopper Pearson exact interval) for each presented single surface
(Figure 9b). These results indicate that the discrimination ability obtained using TIME stimulation
was higher than the one with microstimulation (Figure 1c, Figure 3). This was attributed to the pro-
longed use/training of the implanted neural interface before the present study (Raspopovic, 2014).
Analysis of neural coding strategies
The behavioral performance as a function of stimulus in subject DAS can be fit exactly (R = 1) using a
logistic function of the difference of SPs between the two halves of each surface (Figure 9c). To
understand how the very good surface discrimination, which was shown both by intact subjects with
microstimulation and by DAS with the TIME implant, was achieved (Figure 1c), we tested which neu-
ral features correlated with the difference of SPs. During the conditions of constant sliding velocity
(10 mm/s) and regulated load force (400 mN), the periodic contact between the sensor and the tex-
ture ridges generated regular patterns in the sensor output. The spiking response was given by a
sequence of bursts of reliable duration, time-locked to the alternation of ridges and grooves during
the sliding motion of gratings (Figure 10). This suggested that the Inter Burst Interval (IBI, illustrated
in Figure 10a), given by the temporal distance between the onset of consecutives bursts, might
characterize the response to each texture. Indeed, the MNT process led to linear correlation
between the stimulus SP of each texture and a highly specific IBI (ANOVA test, Tukey Kramer correc-
tion for multiple comparisons, p<0.00001) reproducing neurophysiological findings in non-human
(Darian-Smith et al., 1980a; Phillips and Johnson, 1981) and human (Oddo et al., 2011b) primate
studies with similar gratings. Consequently, the difference in IBI between the MNT output that was
elicited by the two sides of each stimulus correlated almost perfectly (R2 = 0.997) with the difference

 in SP (Figure 9d). Additionally, the behavioral responses of DAS were perfectly (R = 1) fit by a logis-
tic function of the difference in IBI.
The abovementioned results show that DAS behavioral responses may be based on the temporal
structure of stimulation. However, they do not rule out the possibility that the responses were based
simply on the count of the total number of spikes injected during each stimulus. Then, we tested
whether a rate code not taking into account the temporal structure of the response was able to lead
to comparable discrimination of stimuli as the one observed behaviorally. A commonly accepted def-
inition of a rate code is the count of spikes within the time frame of encoding window
(Theunissen and Miller, 1995; Panzeri et al., 2010) which in our case is assumed to be the 2 s pre-
sentation of each stimulus. Then, the sensor response to each stimulus, based on which we per-
formed the IBI-based analysis, was also quantified by measuring the overall average firing rate (AFR),
i.e., the ratio between the total number of spikes emitted during the sliding and the (fixed) 2 s slid-
ing duration. We found that the AFRs generated in response to different SPs were often similar
because a larger IBI was associated with a more intense bursting activity (Figure 10). In particular,
the AFRs of responses to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were not significantly different, and the AFRs of
responses to 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm were not significantly different (p<0.05 ANOVA test with multiple

 comparisons). Consequently, the difference DAFR in AFR between the two sides of a stimulus corre-
lated very weakly with the difference between their SP (R2 = 0.066 for DAFR vs R2 = 0.997 for DIBI,
compare Figure 9e and Figure 9d). Note that no logistic function of the difference in AFR was able
to fit DAS behavioral responses (R2 = 0.04, p = 0.8), which was a significant contrast with the perfect
fit achieved with DIBI. Therefore, because the total spike count was not able to encode differences
between stimuli to a degree compatible with behavioral responses, we concluded that the rate code
was not responsible for the subject perception of the presented textures. This further strengthens

 the hypothesis that the subject exploited the temporal structure of the response to discriminate the
stimuli.
Figure 10 shows the instantaneous firing rate (La
´nsky
´ et al., 2004) of different responses com-
puted as the inverse of the inter-spike interval. It is apparent that the temporal evolution of the
instantaneous firing rate matches the alternation of ridges and grooves. Indeed, it is already known
that, when sliding occurs at fixed velocity, the temporal structure of the sensor output is a linear
transformation of the spatial structure of the texture (Oddo et al., 2011b; 2011c) , at least for regu-
lar textures such as those considered here. Therefore, this is a case of temporal coding of the stimu-
lus (Theunissen and Miller, 1995; Borst and Theunissen, 1999) : the temporal evolution of the
spiking response reflects the time evolution of the stimulus rather than internal dynamics of stimulus
encoding. Because the spatial structure is highly regular and the textures primarily differ for a single
spatial variable (the SP), it is possible to discriminate between them using the corresponding single
temporal variable (the IBI). Then, this may be the feature of the injected spike trains that allows sub-
jects to precisely decode the presented stimuli.
Discussion
Recent neuroprosthetic studies showed that pressure sensation can be elicited by injecting a train of
pulses with a fixed shape and different frequencies via intrafascicular (Dhillon and Horch, 2005) or

 cuff (Tan et al., 2014; Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014) interfaces. Additionally, reconstruction of tactile
sensation of force levels and object shape was shown using multi-electrode stimulation via pulses
with current amplitude linearly increasing with sensor outputs (Raspopovic, 2014). In contrast, this
work focused on eliciting textural features by injecting a biomimetic (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015) tem-
poral structure of pulse trains with a fixed current amplitude in each experimental session. Discrimi-
nation of textural features is a remarkable skill of our somatosensory system, which is used in
everyday activities to interact with a peri-personal space. The subjects that use hand prostheses will
significantly benefit from the restoration of this sensory function, which represents the next desirable
feature after recent achievements (Tan et al., 2014; Raspopovic, 2014; Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014).
The results of this study show that the texture discrimination skills can be artificially provided to users
using both needle microstimulation in intact subjects and implantable intraneural interfaces in a
transradial amputee. Both in needle and TIME-based experiments, the subjects were able to use our
‘artificial’ feedback to perform a 3AFC psychophysical test with very good and comparable
performance.
The similarity between the needle and TIME-based stimulations was predicted by our hybrid
FEM-biophysical model, which supported the transition from acute preparation towards chronically
implanted electrodes. In addition, this result opens up interesting scientific and clinical opportuni-
ties. In the future, needle microstimulation can be used during translational experiments to test dif-
ferent types of peripheral neural coding strategies, which - if successful in this prototypal situation -
would be implemented using implantable neural interfaces in disabled patients. Furthermore, model
predictions were confirmed by the quasi-perfect discrimination (96% overall stimuli, see Figure 1c,
and see Figure 9a,b for the analysis on a per-stimulus basis) that was achieved by DAS amputee
with TIME stimulation.
The results of the present study showed that a temporal neuronal coding of spatial structure
(Weber et al., 2013) can successfully elicit tactile cues in case of coarse surfaces that were explored
under a passive- dynamic-touch protocol with a constant sliding velocity and a regulated load force,
thus, involving controlled motion of the tactile stimulus while the fingertip was not moving
(Yoshioka et al., 2001). In such passive-touch framework there is a lack of voluntary movement. This
allows decoupling of cutaneous information (which was our interest in this study) from the kinaes-
thetic afferent sensory feedback and efference copy associated with movement dynamics. Thus, it
was possible to compare the EEG activities evoked by the substitutive neuromorphic electrical stimu-
lation versus the natural mechanical tactile stimulation. No significant differences in topography or
frequency modulation clustering were shown by the EEG signals in the two cases.
The behavioral results showed that injecting the sensor output via a single stimulation channel
was sufficient to induce accurate responses (particularly from DAS) in the designed experimental
protocol with locked indentation force and tangential velocity of stimulus pairs. Additionally, these
experiments allowed us to investigate how the subjects were able to achieve these results in this
specific case. In fact, the relationship between IBI and behavioral performance seems to indicate
that responses of subject DAS were based on temporal structures of the injected stimuli (which, due
to the linearity of our MNT process in mapping the geometry of stimuli, correspond to temporal
modulation in the spiking activity captured by the IBI for regular textures), rather than on their aver-
age firing rate alone. IBI was previously shown to be given by the ratio between the surface spatial
period SP and the sliding velocity V in human (Oddo et al., 2011b) and animal (Weber et al., 2013;
Darian-Smith et al., 1980a) neurophysiological investigations and in artificial touch (Oddo et al.,
2011c) studies. Because in our protocol the sliding velocity V was fixed (10 mm/s), the IBI was

 proportional to the SP, and so were their differences (DIBI and DSP) between the two sides of the
stimuli (Figure 9d).
Our results indicate that a temporal single-channel MNT-based intraneural stimulation allows
gathering of textural features of medium-coarse surfaces with constant and slow sliding velocity.
However, for more complex texture discriminating tasks it is plausible that integration of spatiotem-
poral information from neighboring receptors distributed along the fingertip (Johansson and Flana-
gan, 2009; Jo
¨rntell et al., 2014) and, thus, multi-channel stimulation, combined with amplitude
modulation (Raspopovic, 2014), would be needed in less restrictive conditions that involve velocity
or force variations and everyday life stimuli (Weber et al., 2013; De
´peault et al., 2008;
Rongala et al., 2015).
The promising results obtained with microstimulation in four intact subjects, combined with
robust translational indications from the hybrid model and an excellent outcome from one amputee,
prompt the idea that neuromorphic stimulation could be a natural and effective tool for eliciting tex-
ture discrimination abilities via hand prostheses. Neuroprosthetic research (Tan et al., 2014; Raspo-
povic, 2014; Dhillon and Horch, 2005; Rossini et al., 2010) can in parallel contribute to the
evaluation of open neuroscientific hypotheses about tactile perception (Weber et al., 2013;
Yoshioka et al., 2001; Johansson and Flanagan, 2009; Hollins and Risner, 2000) for the advance-
ment of understanding of human somatosensory physiology.
Materials and methods
Sensorized finger
The core element of the artificial fingertip was a Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) sensor
with 4 transducing piezoresistors implanted at the base of a cross-shaped structure (Beccai et al.,
2005) (Figure 3). The MEMS was packaged with polymeric compliant material (Dragon Skin,
Smooth-On, USA). Sensor data were sampled at 380 Hz per channel by a 24-bit Analog to Digital
Converter (ADS1258, Texas Instruments, USA) integrated in the fingertip, and acquired via SPI by a
Field Programmable Gate Array (Cyclone II FPGA, Altera, USA).
Mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT) process
The FPGA streamed the acquired information via Ethernet to a PC for real-time implementation of
an artificial mechanoreceptor model emulating the tactile coding recorded during human microneur-
ography sessions carried out with surfaces and experimental apparatus as those of current study
(Oddo et al., 2011b; 2011d). To this aim, MEMS sensor signals were converted into sequences of
neural spikes via a real-time C++ implementation of the Izhikevich spiking neuron (Izhikevich, 2003).
Such model was originally conceived to emulate neuron-to-neuron signaling, whereas in this modi-
fied implementation the input is haptic rather than synaptic. As detailed in the following sections,
these transduced spike trains were injected in the median nerve as train of pulses of fixed width and
amplitude through microstimulation electrode in the case of intact subjects and through TIME inter-
face in the case of DAS amputee.
We did not model the fine details of the complex spatio-temporal mechanical interaction
between physical stimuli, soft tissues and receptors (Hayward et al., 2014), but we injected as input
current in the neuron model a signal generated from the outputs of sensors integrated in the artifi-
cial fingertip, as follows. Sensor piezoresistive outputs (Sx+ and Sx-, represented in blue and in green
in Figure 2c) belonging to opposite tethers of the cross-shaped structure were subtracted (Equa-
tion 1) to obtain a component, proximal to distal on the biomimetic fingertip, highly correlated to
the frictional shear stress (Oddo et al., 2007) arising along the direction of the stimulus sliding
motion. This component was half-rectified and amplified (Equation 2, as represented in red in
Figure 2c) in order to inject it as input current in the spiking neuron model (Ix in Equation 3). Equa-
tions 3 and 4 describe the subthreshold evolution of the membrane potential v and the recovery
variable u in the implemented artificial neuron model (Spigler et al., 2012; Izhikevich, 2003). When-
ever the membrane potential v reached the threshold level, a spike was triggered, v was set to a
reset value c and u was increased of a fixed value d (Equation 5). The spike was broadcasted by
TCP communication to successive services and graphical user interface (Labview, NI, USA).

 The computed binary response constituted the output of the neuromorphic artificial touch sys-
tem, which triggered via USB the current stimulator (STG4008, Multichannel System, Germany) each
time that a spike template had to be delivered.
The coefficients of the model (Spigler et al., 2012; Izhikevich, 2003) were tuned so to achieve a
phasic firing with respect to the moving ridges of surfaces (Gardner and Palmer, 1989). The MNT
process emulated to some extent the neural representation of stimulus spatial patterning observed
in previous non-human (Weber et al., 2013; Darian-Smith et al., 1980a) and human (Oddo et al.,
2011b) primate recordings of SA1 afferents associated to Merkel mechanoreceptors, a functionally
relevant class of tactile units able to encode medium-coarse textures (Weber et al., 2013;
Phillips and Johnson, 1981; Yoshioka et al., 2001; Darian-Smith et al., 1980b) such as the surfaces
evaluated in the present study. The MNT process coded the temporal period of the surface, a fea-
ture scaling linearly with spatial period of the grating and inversely with the stimulus tangential
velocity. The resulting firing (Figure 2) was characterized by biomimetic (Sathian et al., 1989) bursts
of multiple spikes per ridge with coarser surfaces (see 3.0 mm and 2.0 mm SP in Figure 10), by trip-
lets or duplets for surfaces with medium coarseness (see 1.5 mm and 1.0 mm SP in Figure 10),
down to a single spike per ridge with finer surfaces (see 0.5 mm SP in Figure 10), thus implementing
a neural code of stimulus geometry based on the modulation of discharge rather than on the mean
discharge frequency, resembling SA1 electrophysiological recordings under similar tactile stimulation
conditions (Darian-Smith et al., 1980a; Phillips and Johnson, 1981) (Figure 10—figure supple-
ment 1). Furthermore, the instantaneous firing rate of the implemented artificial mechanoreceptor
model achieves a modulation up to tens of spikes/s (see red traces in Figure 10), coherently with
typical values reported in the literature for SA1 units (Johnson, 2001; Phillips and Johnson, 1981).

Percutaneous electrical microstimulation of the median nerve with
intact subjects
Four intact subjects (2 males and 2 females, 25–26 years old) underwent the experiments of texture
discrimination with tactile feedback elicited by a stimulation injected through two microneurographic
electrodes (FHC UNP40GAS, shaped as needles). The enrolment was subjected to signing a written
Informed Consent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this
set of experiments took place.
A neurologist trained in microneurography performed the procedure (Hagbarth and Vallbo,
1967) , consisting of two phases of electrical stimulation, superficial and percutaneous, necessary to
identify the correct site for electrodes insertion. The reference electrode was positioned just through
the skin and the active one into the nerve.
Initially, we stimulated the skin of the right arm of the subject in an area centred 2–3 cm proximal
and medial to the elbow. A 1 Hz cathodic biphasic balanced square current was delivered to the
subject. Pulse duration was 0.2 ms, while amplitude was changed in the range 1–10 mA. The nerve
area was identified whenever a hand muscle twitch occurred in correspondence of 1–2 mA ampli-
tude. Reference and active electrodes were then inserted through subject’s skin, after cleaning.
A cathodic biphasic balanced square wave was injected through the needles with a frequency of
1 Hz. Pulse duration was 0.2 ms, while the current changed within the 1–100 mA range. The neurolo-
gist moved slightly the active electrode towards the inner of the arm seeking for a reported

Neuroscience
 sensation or a muscular twitch over/of the hand. If one of those conditions occurred with amplitude
of the injected current between 1–10 mA, the electrode impaled the nerve fiber. The neurologist
then moved the needle in the area of insertion until the subject reported a distinct tactile sensation
over one of the first four fingers.
As final evaluation of proper placement of the electrodes, the electroneurogram (ENG) was visu-
alized and acoustically identified: afferent ENG from the median nerve had to be discriminated over
the background nerve activity as some mechanical stimuli were exerted over the fingers. Acquisition
was performed by means of a system comprising a single channel amplifier (15LT Bipolar, Grass
Instrument, USA) and a 16-bit data acquisition board (PCI-6251, NI, USA) installed on a personal
computer running a custom interface (Labview, NI, USA).
The subject was instructed to avoid any voluntary movement that could alter the needle place-
ment once the nerve search procedure was completed. An experimenter-guided session of microsti-
mulation was performed in order to identify appropriate parameters to use in the upcoming 3AFC
psychophysical protocol: 500 ms trains of cathodic biphasic balanced squares were delivered while
changing frequency, pulse duration (Ts) and amplitude (As) starting from 10 Hz, 5 ms and 2 mA,
respectively. The tuning of stimulation parameters was operated heuristically among the subjects
while performing pilot trials, such as: a) subject connected to the stimulator while the experimented
touched manually the artificial fingertip, b) subject exploring the gratings with the non-stimulated
hand and then c) perceiving the same surfaces via the artificial fingertip. An additional experimental
session of recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) (Kunesch et al., 1995) at 1 Hz stimula-
tion rate was performed with subjects M3 and M4 before starting the 3AFC psychophysical experi-
mental protocol: the spike template was injected in the nerve through microstimulation. Stimulation
was delivered as square pulses lasting 200 ms at 1 Hz with a number of repetitions (180 for M3 and
700 for M4) allowing a robust Independent Component Analysis (Artoni et al., 2014) on EEG data
(as detailed in the specific session). In order to allow a better comparison among subjects, stimula-
tion amplitude was individually tailored and chosen as an amplitude that was clearly perceived by
the subject, without producing any discomfort (between 5 and 10 mA). Pilot trials of the 3AFC psy-
chophysical test with neuromorphic sensory feedback were then repeated for variable duration
among subjects just before starting the actual experimental protocol.
Intraneural stimulation of the median nerve with implanted interface in
transradial amputee
Participant DAS had suffered a traumatic transradial left arm amputation 10 years before the experi-
ments. He was selected from a group of 31 persons with hand amputation because of the stump
characteristics and his psychophysical abilities. All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committees of Policlinic A. Gemelli at Catholic University, where the surgery was performed,
IRCCS S. Raffaele Pisana (Rome), where the experiments were performed, the Ethics Committee of
Campus Bio-Medico University and the Italian Ministry of Health.
TIME neural interfaces were implanted under general anaesthesia. After superficial disinfection of
the medial aspect of the left upper limb, placed extrarotated, the skin was cut along the medial
edge of the biceps muscle for about 15 centimetres, from few centimetres below the axilla to about
6 cm above the elbow. The ulnar and the medial nerves were exposed along their course, through
careful smooth dissection of the dermal and hypodermic structures, fascial bands, and muscles. Fol-
lowing an epineurial microdissection, performed under a surgical microscope (Zeiss, Pentero) to visu-
alize the fascicles, two TIME electrodes were inserted into the nerve trunk of each nerve (median
and ulnar, only the former of which was used for electrical stimulation in the present work). Electro-
des were pulled inside the nerve, until the embedded active contacts reached the targeted location,
close in contact with the nerve fascicles. Cable segments were placed in subcutaneous pockets,
while four holes were made in close proximity of the skin incision, two medially and two laterally for
the electrode emission (Raspopovic, 2014; Di Pino et al., 2014).
The electrodes were removed after 30 days, in accordance with EU guidelines. At the time of
removal however, the TIME electrodes were still performing extremely well, and did not cause any
discomfort to the subject. The follow-up of the clinical condition of the participant almost 2 years
after the end of the protocol did not reveal any subjective or objective side effects.
Upon connection of the neural interface implanted in the median nerve with the current stimula-
tor, an experimenter-guided session of intraneural stimulation was performed in order to identify

Neuroscience
 appropriate parameters to use in the upcoming 3AFC psychophysical protocol, also capitalizing on
the information gathered during the previous days of experimental activities with DAS. Pulse dura-
tion (Ts) and amplitude (As) were initially set to 100 ms and 100 mA, respectively. The tuning of stimu-
lation parameters was operated heuristically in 33 min while performing pilot trials, such as: a) DAS
connected to the stimulator while he (with the intact hand, to have a sort of self-touch experience)
or the experimenter touched manually the artificial fingertip, b) DAS exploring the gratings with the
intact hand and then c) perceiving the same surfaces via the artificial fingertip. Pilot trials of the
3AFC psychophysical test with neuromorphic sensory feedback were then repeated for 8 min with
the selected parameters (As = 160 mA, Ts = 100 ms) just before starting the experimental protocol.
Three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) psychophysical protocol
The protocol structure was essentially the same during microstimulation of intact subjects, and stim-
ulation through implanted TIMEs in the amputee.
The artificial fingertip underwent mechanical stimulation with surface pairs that were presented
using a mechatronic platform (Oddo et al., 2011d) designed to implement standardized human and
artificial passive-touch (Jones and Smith, 2014) experimental protocols. The tactile stimuli were gra-
tings, fabricated with 3D printing of plastic material (Project HD 3000, 3D Systems), consisting of a
sequence of alternating ridges and grooves with spatial period (SP) from a minimum of 0.5 mm to a
maximum of 3.0 mm depending on the stimulus and on the half portion of the surface under test
(Figure 1b, Figure 2, Figure 10). The sequence of presented stimuli was randomized within sessions
of 16 trials composed of 4 presentations of the 4 surfaces D0.0, D1.0, D2.0 and D2.5. In each session,
the 4 trials per each stimulus were composed of 2 trials with presentation of the two surface halves
in the SP1-SP2 order (labeled +: D0.0+, D1.0+, D2.0+ and D2.5+), and 2 trials with reversed SP2-SP1
order (labeled 2: D0.0-, D1.0-, D2.0- and D2.5-). The first half-surface was indented at 400 mN on the
artificial fingertip and, after 4 s of indentation without tangential movement, it was slid at 10 mm/s
for 2 s under regulated load force. The sliding motion was followed by 2 s of indentation at 400 mN
without stimulus movement, and then the surface was detached. The same sequence was applied to
the second half-surface, starting 3 s after the end of presentation of the first half (see Figure 2 and
Video 1 for the representation of the whole stimulation sequence). At the end of the presentation of
the surface pair, the subject stated whether the first half-surface was perceived as having coarser,
finer or same spatial coarseness in comparison to the second half. During the experiment the subject
received no feedback about the correctness of the responses.
For the intact subjects who participated in the microstimulation sessions, the gratings were also
presented mechanically, via the tactile stimulation platform (Oddo et al., 2011d) , directly on the fin-
ger (fixed to the platform via a finger holder glued to the nail) that was identified as source of the
sensory perception elicited with microstimulation. During the experiment the subjects received no
feedback about the correctness of the responses.
The 95% confidence intervals for performance estimate from individual subjects responses were
computed with exact Clopper Pearson method (binofit function in Matlab) and compared against
chance level (1/3) to assess performance significance. Parameters for logistic fit of performance as a
function of stimulus features were estimated with generalized linear regression (glmfit function in
Matlab), then the optimal logistic fit function was generated (glmval function in Matlab) and its accu-
racy evaluated as the squared correlation coefficient between data and fit.
EEG signals recording
In order to investigate the neural correlates of natural and substitutive texture discrimination, EEG
signals were recorded in all microstimulation sessions using a 64 channel EEG device (SD LTM
Express, Micromed S.p.A., Italy) with a 2 kHz sampling rate. The montage was in accordance with
the 5% 10/20 system (Oostenveld and Praamstra, 2001). Careful scalp preparation granted electro-
des impedance below 5 kW in at least 90% of derivations, as measured at the experiment onset.
EEG signal processing
Data were analyzed by Matlab scripts based on the EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).
EEG signals were processed via independent component analysis (ICA) filtering to remove non-neu-
ral sources and artifacts. In order to optimize the dipolarity of the independent components (IC)

 extracted (Artoni et al., 2014) and to maximize the amount of data fed to the algorithm (while main-
taining a sufficient density of information) the EEG continuous data were epoched.
Data were high-pass filtered using a zero-phase 1 Hz, 24th order, Chebyshev type II filter and low-
pass filtered using a zero-phase, 45 Hz, 71th order, Chebyshev type II filter to remove slow drifts and
high-frequency noise respectively, then resampled at 256 Hz. Channels with prolonged prominent
artifacts (by visual inspection) or with probability more than five times the standard deviation from
the mean across all channels were removed (in the end the remaining numbers of channels were 21,
40, 59, 61 respectively for the four subjects), then a common average reference was used for the
remaining channels. Epochs containing high-amplitude artefactual potentials, high-frequency muscle
noise and other irregular artifacts, as identified by visual inspection, were removed and remaining
data were submitted to AMICA (Palmer et al., 2007), a generalization of the Infomax algorithm
(Makeig et al., 1996) to multiple mixture approaches (Lee et al., 1999) under the hypothesis that
the ICs are spatially static (general stationarity, e.g. recording environment). ICA decompositions
were performed separately on each subject over all conditions. Stereotyped artifacts such as eye
movements, eye blinks and muscle tension were removed by ICA. The ICA decomposition was then
saved and reapplied to data, pre-processed using the same described procedure, but high-passed
using a 0.5 Hz, 94th order, Chebyshev type II filter but using the pre-computed weights. This proce-
dure allowed to efficiently remove artifacts while retaining the low-frequency EEG information.
Regarding source localization, for subject M4 a realistic head model was obtained by means of
the NFT toolbox (Acar and Makeig, 2010) using a T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image of
the subject and a 4-layer model accounting for scalp (s = 0.33), skull (s = 0.0132), brain tissue (s =
0.33), and cerebrospinal fluid (s = 1.79) respectively. Electrodes positions on the head were co-regis-
tered with an optoelectronic neuronavigation system SoftAxic (E.M.S. srl, Italy) and aligned with the
Montreal Neurological Institute MNI, Canada. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the
numerical solution of the forward problem with Boundary Element Method (BEM) meshes as bound-
aries. Given the potentials distribution across the scalp, the position of a best-fitting single equiva-
lent current dipole (inverse problem) was determined using the (Dipfit toolbox of EEGLAB)
(Oostenveld and Oostendorp, 2002; Delorme et al., 2012).
EEG recording time-locked with 1 Hz intraneural median nerve microstimulation was exploited to
evidence the early somatosensory potentials, the components more strictly due to the stimulation.
SEP data epochs were selected from 20 ms before to 100 ms after each stimulation onset. Noisy
epochs were rejected by careful visual inspection. Similarly to the continuous data, the criteria for
epoch removal were the presence of high amplitude artifacts (e.g., Jaw clenching). Source localiza-
tion was then performed on the most reliable short-latency potential of cortical origin, namely the
P27 peak (Figure 5).
Event-related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the onset of either the electrical microstimu-
lation or of the sliding phase of the mechanical stimulation (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement
1). ERPs were normalized for the standard deviation of the prestimulus (1000 ms). ERP’s statistical
significance between conditions (electrical microstimulation vs. mechanical stimulation) was assessed
using a Montecarlo statistics with cluster correction for multiple comparisons (triangulation and max-
sum as clustered statistics) (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007) , adapted from the FieldTrip toolbox
(Oostenveld et al., 2011). Statistical power of ERPs comparisons between stimulation conditions
was computed for dependent groups (GPower, Duesseldorf, Germany) (Figure 4—figure supple-
ments 2–5).
EEG functional connectivity analysis and EEG graph analysis
EEG functional connectivity analysis was performed using the eLORETA exact low-resolution electro-
magnetic tomography (Vecchio et al., 2015; Pascual-Marqui, 2011; Vecchio et al., 2014a;
2014b; 2015b) software.
To obtain a topographic view of the sensorimotor network, brain connectivity was computed with
sLORETA/eLORETA software in 7 regions, positioning the center in Brodmann Areas (BAs: 1–7) sep-
arately on the left and right hemispheres.
For each subject and for each hemisphere, among the eLORETA current density time series of
the 7 Regions of Interest (ROIs), intracortical Lagged Linear Coherence, extracted using a sphere
with 19 mm of radius (Pascual-Marqui, 2011; 2007) , was computed between all possible pairs of

 the ROIs for each of the five independent EEG frequency bands: delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha
(8–13 Hz), low beta (13–20 Hz) and high beta (20–30 Hz).
A weighted network was built based on the connectivity between ROIs. The nodes of the network
were ROIs, and the edges of the network were weighed by the lagged linear coherence values.
The vertices of the network were the estimated cortical sources in the BAs, and the edges were
weighted by the Lagged Linear value within each pair of vertices.
The measure considered here was the clustering (C) that characterizes the tendency of the near-
est neighbors of a node to be interconnected. The mean clustering coefficient was computed for all
nodes of the graph and was then averaged to estimate the tendency of network elements to form
local segregated clusters. Finally, to obtain individual normalized relative measures, the values of
each mean clustering coefficient were divided by the mean values obtained by their average in all
bands of each subject.
Statistical analysis of percent clustering modulation with respect to baseline period was per-
formed with Statistica v.7 software (StatSoft Inc., USA). Greenhouse and Geisser correction was used
for the protection against the violation of the sphericity assumption in the repeated measure
ANOVA. Besides, statistical significance was determined by 3-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s
multiple range test. ANOVA was performed between three factors: stimulation mode (mechanical
and electrical; independent variable), hemisphere (left and right), and band (delta, theta, alpha, low
beta, high beta).
Hybrid electrical-biophysical model of the median nerve for the
comparison between microstimulation needle and implanted TIME
Hybrid models (Raspopovic et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2002) account for the anisotropy of extra-
cellular conductivity during the calculation of the electrical field induced by the injection of the elec-
trical current into the tissue, present in real nerves, and for the nonlinear response of cells to the
extracellular stimulation. Those two aspects were addressed by means of a finite element method
(FEM) to solve the voltage distribution generated by injected currents, and by calculating the neuro-
nal dynamics to estimate the axonal response to the electrical stimulation. The volume conductor
model implemented via multiphysics FEM (COMSOL Multiphysics, Sweden) can solve Poisson’s
equation provided by proper boundary conditions. To do so, an anatomically shaped geometrical
model of the median nerve (Jabaley et al., 1980) was generated by image segmentation (ImageJ,
USA). Coordinates of the image segmentation were exported (livelink COMSOL-Matlab) to edit a
3D nerve model (procedure illustrated in Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Perineurium had a thick-
ness of 3% of the diameter of the fascicles (Grinberg et al., 2008) , and coordinates were interpo-
lated. The nerve diameter had a maximum of 4.6 mm and minimum of 2.3 mm, as obtained from
unpublished histological data provided by Dr. Xavier Navarro and from post-mortem human cadav-
ers dissections at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain. A cylinder, representing the nerve’s
outer space, filled with saline, enclosed the nerve. Boundary optimal dimensions of cylinder were
found to be 69 mm for the diameter and 140 mm for the height, using convergence calculations
(Raspopovic et al., 2011). Electrical ground was therefore fixed in this cylindrical boundary of the
structure.
On the biophysical side, MRG model (McIntyre et al., 2002) was used to model the nerve tactile
sensory fibers. This model represents the nonlinear modified Hodgkin-Huxley Equations for the
active compartment of the axons (the nodes of Ranvier) and a detailed realistic representation of the
myelinated tracts. The model (available in NEURON model repository) is capable of reproducing sev-
eral experimental aspects of cells dynamics (McIntyre et al., 2002). Then, a fiber with 21 segments
(Raspopovic et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2002) of nodes of Ranvier was built and extracellular
stimulation procedure used to excite the cell. For a fiber of diameter D, a model had internodal
spacing L = 100D. A fiber was considered recruited when a generated action potential travelled
along its whole length (i.e., reached the last node of Ranvier). The total recruitment was calculated
as the portion of the fibers activated for the specific charge injected with respect to the total number
of fibers implemented. Furthermore, nodal length was fixed at 1 mm and nodal diameter scaled from
a previous study (McIntyre et al., 2002). A list of plausible assumptions had to be taken, during the
model construction. The sensory axon populations were constructed (NEURON, USA) by using a
probabilistic distribution of fibers diameters (Vallbo and Johansson, 1984) for different tactile units
of the human hand, resulting in two Gaussian distributions which differentiate nociceptive fibers

 from fibers responsible for pressure/touch sensation, and the latter was used. One of the assump-
tions constraining the model was that the stimulation of different fiber types, such as nociceptive
fibers, was not induced, at used current range. A total amount of 100 modeled fibers for each fasci-
cle were placed randomly in the specific target fascicle, for several placements (Figure 8), as
explained in continuation. As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown,
we assumed that fibers within one fascicle innervate the same hand area (Jabaley et al., 1980) (i.e.,
the fibers in one fascicle are innervating a single finger tip and not many of them). Moreover, since
there is an inherent anatomical uncertainty in placement and extension of fibers innervating a spe-
cific hand district, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented 9 populations
having different extensions and centroids for the same large fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the
whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are
almost touching each-other, Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Then the analysis has
been performed for the range of significant fascicle sizes, defined as median size representatives of
three groups: small (1 population implemented), medium (5 populations implemented) and large (9
populations). Different device placements were also studied: within, close, or far from fascicle, finally
resulting in n = 90 simulations for TIME and n = 45 simulations cases for microneedle (this is because
for every position of needle tip there are 2 corresponding positions of TIME: left and right).
The microstimulation needle (FHC UNP40GAS) was replicated as a cylinder with a cone-like end-
ing (Figure 6): the cylinder had 3 mm length, and cone (tip) with semi-angle 12.78˚ and shank diame-
ter 250 mm. The whole structure was insulated and had electrical conductivity of 6.67 10–14 S/m and
the tip was non-insulated with a conductivity of 1.89 107 S/m. Since in the case of microstimulation
needle the tip was un-insulated by the neurologist, imminently before the insertion, the precise un-
insulated cone dimension is not known. In order to account for this uncertainty, two models were
implemented and the results analyzed for both (Figure 8). The TIME electrode was built as a rectan-
gular structure where seven circled active sites were placed in each side of the structure (Figure 6).
Conductivity of the polyimide substrate was set to 6.67 10–14 S/m. The radius for the active sites
was 40 mm and the thickness 300 nm. The overall structure had 4 mm length, 0.35 mm width and 20
mm thickness. The electrical conductivity values used for the FEM were [0.0826i 0.0826j 0.571k] S/m
for the endoneurium (Raspopovic et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2002) , 880 mS/m for perineurium,
0.0826 S/m for the epineurium (Raspopovic et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2002) , 2 S/m for saline.
Conductivity of perineurium was recalculated from a previous study (Weerasuriya et al., 1984)
taking into account the thickness of the perineurium as 3% of diameter of the fascicle and the differ-
ence of temperature between frogs and humans. Although TIME electrode was implanted in vivo
and

saline
placed
outside
the
nerve,
this
value
was
used
as
in
previous
studies
(Raspopovic et al., 2011; McIntyre et al., 2002).
The similarity between needle and TIME is estimated by comparison of charges necessary for
10% of recruitment of fibers, for respectively 45 and 90 populations computed, by means of Kruskal-
Wallis test, with significance level fixed at 0.05.

Ethics
Human subjects: Participant DAS had suffered a traumatic transradial left arm amputation 10 years
before the experiments. He was selected from a group of 31 persons with hand amputation because
of the stump characteristics and his psychophysical abilities. All procedures were approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committees of Policlinic A. Gemelli at Catholic University, where the surgery was
performed, IRCCS S. Raffaele Pisana (Rome), where the experiments were performed, the Ethics
Committee of Campus Bio-Medico University and the Italian Ministry of Health. Four intact subjects
(2 males and 2 females, 25-26 years old) underwent the experiments of texture discrimination with
tactile feedback elicited by a stimulation injected through two microneurographic electrodes (FHC
UNP40GAS, shaped as needles). The enrolment was subjected to signing a written Informed Con-
sent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this set of experi-
ments took place.
