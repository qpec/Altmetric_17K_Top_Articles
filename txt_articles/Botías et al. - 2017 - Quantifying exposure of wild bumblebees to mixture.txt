Abstract 
10 
The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of 
11 
exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing 
12 
proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has 
13 
been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of 
14 
wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to 
15 
pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five 
16 
different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling 
17 
periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were 
18 
analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had 
19 
detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently 
20 
detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), 
21 
epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). 
22 
Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual 
23 
pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more 
24 
than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. 
25 
Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland 
26 
compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, 
27 
our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in 
28 
agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during 
29 
the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these 
30 
combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the 
31 
environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and 
32 
pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations.

bumblebees, with different levels and frequencies of detection according to the species, 
35 
sampling period and landscape context.

1. Introduction 
39 
Bees are exposed to environmental pollutants via contaminated food resources such as pollen, 
40 
nectar or water (Bonmatin et al., 2015), and through external contact with aerosols during 
41 
spraying and contaminated dust emitted during the sowing of dressed seeds as their hairy 
42 
bodies trap particulate residues (Greig-Smith et al., 1994; Pistorius et al., 2015). Many studies 
43 
have used  honeybees as relevant organisms to monitor environmental pollution (Celli and 
44 
Maccagnani, 2003; Porrini et al., 2003).  Bumblebees also forage in a great diversity of places 
45 
and strongly interact with the environment, mainly the flora, surrounding their nests in a range 
46 
of maximum foraging distances of 363 to 1650 m depending on the species (Walther-Hellwig 
47 
and Frankl, 2000; Wood et al., 2015), and are thus also suitable organisms for monitoring 
48 
landscape-based ecological pollution. 
49 
While most pesticide research has been focused on managed bees, there has been less work 
50 
on wild bee populations. For instance, the only European bumblebee that has been studied in 
51 
relation to pesticide exposure and toxicology is Bombus terrestris, simply because this species 
52 
is easy to rear in captivity and commercially reared colonies are readily available (Baron et al., 
53 
2014; Gill et al., 2012; Rundlöf et al., 2015; Whitehorn et al., 2012). 
54 
There is increasing evidence that managed bees living in agricultural landscapes are routinely 
55 
exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals (David et al., 2016; Lambert et al., 2013; Long and 
56 
Krupke, 2016; Mullin et al., 2010; Pettis et al., 2013), but little is known about the exposure of 
57 
wild bees in these environments (Hladik et al., 2016). Nevertheless, bees constitute a highly 
58 
diverse group where different taxonomic groups differ widely in their vulnerability to pesticide 
59 
exposure (Biddinger et al., 2013; Devillers et al., 2007; Piiroinen and Goulson, 2016; Thompson 
60 
and Hunt, 1999). Furthermore, bee species exhibit pronounced differences in floral 
61 
preferences and foraging habits, collecting pollen and nectar more frequently from particular 
62 
plant species according to their morphological traits (e.g. tongue length, body shape and size) 
63 
and nutritional needs (Goulson et al., 2008; Vanderplanck et al., 2014; Vaudo et al., 2016). 
64 
Such foraging choices may profoundly influence the probability of bees to be more or less 
65 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
exposed to some active compounds (Woodcock et al., 2016). Treated crop plants growing in 
66 
agricultural landscapes have often been regarded as the only source of exposure to 
67 
agrochemicals for pollinators, but recent research revealed their presence in wild plants 
68 
growing near crops (Botías et al., 2015; David et al., 2016; Long and Krupke, 2016; Mogren and 
69 
Lundgren, 2016). We would expect bees that visit flowering arable crops to have higher 
70 
exposure than those that do not, but also those that visit wild plant species may have varying 
71 
exposure depending on the ecology, physiology and morphology of their preferred flowers 
72 
(Botías et al., 2016). Therefore, it is essential to understand the possible differences in levels of 
73 
exposure among bee species, since this could reveal which are the most likely exposed and the 
74 
most frequent mixtures of agrochemicals that they are exposed to.  
75 
The widespread occurrence of mixtures of agrochemicals in bee tissues (Hladik et al., 2016) 
76 
increases concerns regarding the possible detrimental effects of simultaneous exposure to a 
77 
cocktail of compounds. In general, only the effects of single active substances are studied in 
78 
toxicity studies both for research and pesticide registration protocols, and exposure to 
79 
mixtures are only evaluated in risks assessments when they are part of the same formulation.  
80 
However, the application of two or more plant protection products during the same cropping 
81 
season is a common practice in conventional farming (Botías et al., 2015; Garthwaite et al., 
82 
2013), and hence complex mixtures of agrochemicals which are not co-formulants of a single 
83 
product can be simultaneously detected in bee forage and bee tissues (David et al., 2016; 
84 
Hladik et al., 2016; Long and Krupke, 2016). This issue is worrisome given that exposure to 
85 
mixtures might pose higher risks for animal health than the single impact of a specific class of 
86 
compounds (Cedergreen, 2014; Rizzati et al., 2016). For example, some combinations of 
87 
insecticides (e.g. pyrethroids with neonicotinoids) and of insecticides with fungicides can lead 
88 
to additive and synergistic toxicity for bees at the individual and the colony level (Gill et al., 
89 
2012; Iwasa et al., 2004; Schmuck et al., 2003; Sgolastra et al., 2016). The scarcity of 
90 
information on the field-relevant mixtures of agrochemicals and levels of exposure for bees 
91 
could lead us to overlook the possible additive or synergistic effects of pesticide mixtures when 
92 
risk assessment studies are performed, some of which have been designed to evaluate the 
93 
hazards of such combinations (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014). 
94 
Another major gap in knowledge regarding exposure of bees to pesticides is the potential 
95 
uptake and contact with these compounds in urban areas, where ornamental nursery plants 
96 
can also be treated with pesticides (Brown et al., 2013; Fevery et al., 2016) and no information 
97 
is available on their use in domestic gardens. The possible exposure of bees to harmful 
98 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
pesticides through forage collected in gardens is of high ecological concern, since these 
99 
habitats are of great value for bees, providing nectar, pollen and nest sites, and sustaining a 
100 
remarkably high pollinator species richness and abundance (Baldock et al., 2015; Kaluza et al., 
101 
2016; Samnegård et al., 2011), including bumblebees (Fetridge et al., 2008; Goulson et al., 
102 
2010). If foraging resources and nesting sites in urban habitats are contaminated with 
103 
pesticide residues, it is likely that exposure to certain active compounds could be more widely 
104 
spread in the landscape and more prolonged in time than previously assumed. 
105 
The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare exposure in different wild bumblebee 
106 
species. To do this, we analysed the levels of five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen currently-
107 
used fungicides and a pesticide synergist in tissues of five bumblebee species (B. hortorum, B. 
108 
pascuorum, B. terrestris, B. lapidarius and B. pratorum). These wild bumblebee samples were 
109 
collected in agricultural and urban habitats to compare levels of exposure in both 
110 
environments and to study distribution of agrochemicals in the landscape. The bees were 
111 
gathered in three different periods (late spring, early summer and midsummer) in order to 
112 
monitor the length of exposure to agrochemicals through the season.  
113 
Our results show evidence that wild bumblebees are frequently exposed to mixtures of 
114 
agrochemicals when they forage in arable and urban habitats, with peak concentrations 
115 
decreasing through the season.  
116 
2. Materials and Methods 
117 
2.1. Sampling sites and field collection 
118 
Wild bumblebees were collected in five farms and five urban landscapes in East Sussex (South-
119 
East England, UK), all sites being at least 2 kilometers apart from each other (Figure 1) (Table 
120 
S1). The sites selected to collect bees in agricultural land consisted of arable fields within 
121 
mixed farms, where the predominant crops were oilseed rape, winter wheat and spring barley, 
122 
and part of the land was pasture. The urban sampling sites consisted of ornamental public 
123 
gardens and parks surrounded by houses that had private gardens in most cases. Foraging 
124 
bumblebees were collected using insect nets and kept in individual labeled tubes and put on 
125 
ice during transport back to the lab, and then kept at -80°C until pesticide analysis was 
126 
performed. Specimens of five bumblebee species with different ranges of tongue length were 
127 
sampled (Brodie, 1996; Prys-Jones and Corbet, 2011): short-tongued bumblebees were B. 
128 
pratorum (6.4 - 7.1 mm), B. lapidarius (6 - 8.1 mm), B. terrestris (5.8 - 8.2 mm); medium-
129 
tongued was B. pascuorum (7.6 - 8.6 mm); and long-tongued was B. hortorum (12 - 13.5 mm) 
130

(Table 1). The flowers where the bees were foraging at the time of capture were recorded 
131 
(Tables S2a-S1c), since bumblebees exhibit a high degree of floral constancy (Wilson and Stine, 
132 
1996), and this may help predict exposure.  
133 
Bumblebee individuals were gathered during three sampling periods, spring (27/04/14 – 
134 
14/05/14), early summer (5/06/14 – 23/06/14) and midsummer (15/07/14 – 2/08/14), and 150 
135 
bee individuals were collected in total. Oilseed rape crops were in bloom during the first 
136 
sampling period (late spring), and 18 out of the 25 individuals gathered in arable sites during 
137 
that period were foraging in oilseed rape crops when collected (Table S2a). The pesticide usage 
138 
information of the crops where bees were foraging was not provided by the farmers. The EU 
139 
moratorium on the use of neonicotinoid insecticides started on the 1st December 2013, but the 
140 
oilseed rape crops that were in bloom in the 2014 spring were sown at the end of August-
141 
beginning of September 2013, so these crops were still allowed to be seed-treated with 
142 
neonicotinoids. 
143 
2.2. Pesticide analysis 
144 
Chemicals and reagents 
145 
Eight classes of contaminants were chosen to be tested in the bumblebee samples, including 
146 
the five neonicotinoid insecticides that are registered for use in the UK, based on the most 
147 
used (by weight or area treated) in UK crops including oilseed rape, wheat, spring barley, field 
148 
bean, 
strawberry 
and 
raspberry 
crops 
149 
(https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/pusstats/surveys/2014surveys.cfm) (Table S3).  Except for 
150 
certified standards of carbendazim-d3 and tebuconazole-d6, which were purchased from LGC 
151 
standards UK and carbamazepine-d10 and prochloraz-d7 from QMX Laboratories Limited UK, 
152 
all the other certified standards as well as formic acid, magnesium sulphate, ammonium 
153 
formate, sodium acetate and SupelTM QuE PSA/C18/GCB (ratio 1/1/1) were obtained from 
154 
Sigma Aldrich UK. The compound purity of the pesticide standards was > 99%, apart from 
155 
spiroxamine (98.5%), triticonazole (98.8%), piperonyl butoxide (97.9%). Isotopic purity of 
156 
deuterated standards was > 97%. HPLC grade acetonitrile, toluene and water were obtained 
157 
from Rathburns UK.    
158 
Preparation of samples and residue analysis 
159 
The extraction of pesticides from the bumblebee samples was performed as reported in David 
160 
et al., 2015.  
161 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
Briefly, individual whole bumblebee specimens (N = 150) were ground in liquid nitrogen and 
162 
weighed (mean weight ± S.D = 108 ± 46 mg; range = 21 – 236 mg). Each sample was spiked 
163 
with 10 µl acetonitrile containing the mixture of deuterated internal standards (IS) at 40 ng/ml 
164 
(400 pg of each IS). Subsequently, the extraction was performed by the addition of 400 µl of 
165 
water, 500 µl of acetonitrile, 250 mg of magnesium sulphate: sodium acetate mix (4:1) and 50 
166 
mg of SupelTM QuE PSA/C18/GCB for the dispersive solid phase extraction step (dSPE) 
167 
(QuEChERS method). After the dSPE step, the sorbent was extracted with acetonitrile/toluene 
168 
(3/1, 150 µl) and the supernatant was combined with that of the previous acetonitrile extract 
169 
and spin filtered (0.22 µm). After evaporation, reconstitution was made with 120 µl 
170 
acetonitrile:water (30:70) and the extract was centrifuged (20 min). The supernatant obtained 
171 
was stored in the dark at -20°C before analysis. 
172 
UHPLC-MS/MS analyses  
173 
Extracts of samples were analysed by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem 
174 
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) as described in David et al. (2015), using a Waters Acquity 
175 
UHPLC system coupled to a Quattro Premier triple quadrupole mass spectrometer from 
176 
Micromass (Waters, Manchester, UK). Acquisition of data was performed with the software 
177 
MassLynx 4.1 and the quantification was established by the calculation of the response factor 
178 
of each pesticide to its internal standard.  Least-square linear regression analysis of the native 
179 
analyte to deuterated internal standard (concentration ratio) versus the peak area was used to 
180 
determine analyte concentrations. Further methodological details are described in David et al. 
181 
(2015). 
182 
Table S4 reports the method detection limits (MDL) and the method quantification limits 
183 
(MQL) for all the compounds that were analysed in bumblebees. 
184 
2.3. Statistical analysis 
185 
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess whether data (i.e. concentration of pesticides detected in 
186 
the bumblebees per species, habitat, sampling period and bumblebee body mass) met the 
187 
assumptions of normality. Since pesticide concentrations did not meet the assumptions of 
188 
normality, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare this variable among the 
189 
5 different bee species and 3 sampling periods. Pairwise comparisons between bee species, 
190 
sampling periods and habitats were performed using Mann–Whitney U-tests. Bumblebee body 
191 
mass and frequencies of pesticide detection in the 5 species were normally distributed, so one-
192 
way ANOVA analyses were carried out to compare weights of the 5 species, using Bonferroni 
193 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons, and to compare the frequencies of detection among 
194 
them. For the statistical analysis, the MDL value was assigned to concentrations above the 
195 
limits of detection (≥MDL) but below the limits of quantification (>MQL), whereas those below 
196 
the MDL were considered to be zero. The software used to perform the statistical analysis was 
197 
SPSS 21. 
198 
3. Results  
199 
Ranges, frequencies and average levels of neonicotinoid and fungicide residues detected in wild 
200 
bumblebee samples 
201 
In total, 60.7% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the 
202 
compounds analysed, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (in 35.3 % of all the 
203 
bees analysed), followed by tebuconazole (27.3%), spiroxamine (18.7%), carbendazim (10.7%), 
204 
epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7.3%), metconazole (6.7%) and thiamethoxam (6%) (Table 2) 
205 
(Tables S2a-2c). In general, from all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority 
206 
(71.4%) had more than one compound, and 43.4 % of the bees contained two or more, with a 
207 
maximum of 7 different pesticides being detected in one specimen (B. lapidarius collected 
208 
from urban site 2 in June) (Table S2b). 
209 
Levels of pesticide exposure for the five bumblebee species studied 
210 
Although the combinations of pesticides detected varied notably among individuals of the 
211 
same and the other species, some combinations occurred very frequently in farmland 
212 
bumblebees. Boscalid with DMI-fungicides was the most common mixture detected in 
213 
bumblebees (64%) foraging in farmland in spring (April-May), except for B. pratorum 
214 
individuals where such combination was not detected (Table S2a). In early summer (June) 
215 
spiroxamine with DMI-fungicides was detected in the great majority of farmland bumblebees 
216 
(88%), regardless of the species (Table S2b) (Figures 2 and 3). In general, the detection 
217 
frequency of the 19 agrochemicals analysed did not significantly differ among the 5 species 
218 
(ANOVA, F (4, 25) = 0.78, P = 0.55). However, when the concentrations of pesticides detected 
219 
in the 5 bumblebee species were compared, we found that B. pratorum, the species with the 
220 
lowest body mass and shortest tongue length range (Table 1), had significantly lower residue 
221 
levels (mean ± SD = 1.7 ± 3.6 ng/g) than B. hortorum (4.7 ± 10.1 ng/g) (M-W test: U(58) = 291; 
222 
P = 0.013), B. terrestris (6.8 ± 10.4 ng/g) (U(58) = 275; P = 0.006), B. lapidarius (7.2 ± 11.8) 
223 
(U(58) = 260; P = 0.003) and also tended to have lower concentrations than B. pascuorum (2.8 
224 
± 4.9) (U(58) = 330; P = 0.056).  
225

In order to evaluate the relationship between bee body size and levels of exposure, we 
226 
compared the body mass of the five bumblebee species, and we found that B. pratorum was 
227 
significantly lighter than the two species with the highest pesticide concentrations, B. terrestris 
228 
(1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni´s multiple comparison test: P = 0.03) and B. lapidarius (P = 
229 
0.017). 
230 
Levels of pesticide exposure in arable and urban habitats 
231 
In general, bees foraging in agricultural landscapes had significantly higher levels of 
232 
agrochemicals (6.8 ± 9.5 ng/g) than those foraging in urban sites (2.5 ± 7.8 ng/g)(M-W test: 
233 
U(148) = 1635.5; Z = - 4.6; P < 0.001)(Figure 2). However, the highest levels and frequencies of 
234 
detection for neonicotinoids (10 ng/g of imidacloprid on a B. terrestris specimen) and the most 
235 
frequently detected fungicide boscalid (54.5 ng/g in a B. lapidarius specimen) were recorded in 
236 
urban bumblebees collected during the early summer (June) (Table S2b). Overall, 
237 
neonicotinoids were found in more bees in urban sites than in farmland (9.3% versus 2.7%), 
238 
with all five neonicotinoids registered for use in the UK found in at least one urban bee.   
239 
Changing levels of pesticide exposure through the season 
240 
The levels of exposure to agrochemicals for wild bumblebees were examined for the period of 
241 
highest foraging activity in the studied area (East Sussex, England), and we found that the 
242 
frequencies of detection decreased both in arable and urban habitats for the 5 species 
243 
evaluated in midsummer (July) (Figure 3), when only 28% of the bees collected had at least 
244 
one agrochemical, compared to 76% in late spring (April-May) and 78% in early summer (June). 
245 
Consequently, the average concentrations detected were lower in midsummer (July: 0.6 ± 2.3 
246 
ng/g) than in spring (April-May: 5.9 ± 7.6 ng/g) (M-W test: U(98) = 474; Z = -5.67; P < 0.001) 
247 
and early summer (June: 7.5 ± 12.4 ng/g) (M-W test: U(98) = 462.5; Z = -5.74; P < 0.001) (Table 
248 
2).

4. Discussion 
250 
Our field study revealed that free-flying wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticide 
251 
residues, with different levels and frequencies of detection according to the species, sampling 
252 
period and landscape context. Several studies have reported the presence of mixtures of 
253 
agrochemicals in honeybee matrices (Lambert et al., 2013; Mullin et al., 2010; Pettis et al., 
254 
2013), where more than 170 compounds have been detected so far (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 
255 
2014), but little is known about the exposure of wild bees. Recent research detected up to 19 
256 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
different chemicals in native bees collected from wheat fields and grassland in Colorado (USA) 
257 
(Hladik et al., 2016), reporting levels as high as 310 ng/g for thiamethoxam, 87 ng/g for 
258 
clothianidin and 82 ng/g for imidacloprid.  The maximum concentrations detected in our 
259 
bumblebee samples were much lower (i.e. 2.35 ng/g for thiamethoxam, 1.4 ng/g for 
260 
clothianidin and 10 ng/g for imidacloprid), which could be explained by the differences 
261 
between both experimental designs. While we collected free-flying bumblebees with nets and 
262 
analysed them individually, Hladik et al. (2016) performed the analysis on composite samples 
263 
containing approximately 10 individuals of different wild bee species that were collected using 
264 
bee monitoring traps. The collection and analysis of composite samples containing individuals 
265 
from different bee genera might conceivably increase the chances of including particular 
266 
specimens that could have been exposed to very high concentrations of pesticides due to their 
267 
foraging and feeding behaviour, metabolic rates and morphological traits. Although the 
268 
bumblebee species analysed in our study can present differences in their foraging distances, 
269 
they seem to use and benefit similarly from the resources available in farmland (Wood et al., 
270 
2015), while bees from other genera, specially solitary bees, may present more variation in 
271 
their foraging choices (Wood et al., 2016), and thus, a wider range of levels of exposure to 
272 
agrochemicals. On the other hand, the dissimilarities in pesticide use patterns between the UK 
273 
and the USA could partly explain the differences found, as for instance, the maximum 
274 
application rate for thiamethoxam in oil seed crops in the UK is 33.6 g a.i./ha (European Food 
275 
Safety Authority, 2013), and 157 g a.i./ha in the USA (USEPA, 2011). Studying the link between 
276 
pesticide application rates and the levels of exposure for bees, and how different bee species 
277 
can be more or less susceptible to exposure is essential for a full understanding of the risk 
278 
posed by pesticides. 
279 
The comparison of pesticide concentrations among the five bumblebee species that we 
280 
studied showed that B. pratorum, the species with the smallest body mass and tongue length 
281 
range, had lower residue levels than the other four species. Different explanations are 
282 
plausible; for example smaller bees may consume lower amounts of food, and hence they 
283 
would be less exposed to these active compounds present in pollen and nectar. Smaller body 
284 
size may lead to greater mass-specific metabolic rates (Heinrich, 1993), and so pesticides might 
285 
be metabolised faster in smaller bees such as B. pratorum, whose body mass was significantly 
286 
lower than that of the two species with the highest pesticide concentrations, B. terrestris and 
287 
B. lapidarius.

Neonicotinoid insecticides can be metabolised relatively fast, with metabolites being the main 
289 
residues detected in bees a few minutes after ingestion of the parent compound (Brunet et al., 
290 
2005; Suchail et al., 2004). Also the metabolites of some fungicides have been detected in bees 
291 
and bee-collected pollen (Jabot et al., 2016; Mullin et al., 2010; Stoner and Eitzer, 2013), so the 
292 
analysis of neonicotinoid and fungicide metabolites could have revealed the presence of other 
293 
potentially toxic compounds that bees might have been exposed to. Some neonicotinoid 
294 
metabolites have been proven to be highly toxic for bees (Simon-Delso et al., 2015; Suchail et 
295 
al., 2004, 2001), while the possible effects of both parent fungicides and their metabolites has 
296 
been scarcely studied in bees, with some reports showing detrimental effects (Bernauer et al., 
297 
2015; Pettis et al., 2013; Syromyatnikov et al., 2016; vanEngelsdorp et al., 2009). It is possible 
298 
that the action of fungicides on bees may not be directly toxic, as is the case with insecticides, 
299 
but may alter the beneficial microbiome present in the pollen and nectar (Bartlewicz et al., 
300 
2016; vanEngelsdorp et al., 2009; Yoder et al., 2013) and as a consequence, in the bee gut, 
301 
which could have important implications for bee nutrition and health (Engel et al., 2016; 
302 
Mattila et al., 2012; Pettis et al., 2013).  
303 
The tongue length of the different bumblebee species could be hypothesized as a possible 
304 
predictor of residue exposure, since this trait determines whether or not, and how fast, a bee 
305 
can manipulate a particular flower to extract nectar, and thus it is crucial for the division of 
306 
resources between different species (Brian, 2016; Cariveau et al., 2016; Goulson et al., 2008; 
307 
Harder, 2013). Long-tongued bees generally forage from long-corolla flowers, and short-
308 
tongued bees from short corolla flowers (Hobbs, 1962). In the case of B. pratorum, as a short-
309 
tongued bee, the most commonly visited flowers should be those with short corolla (e.g. many 
310 
Rosaceae and Asteraceae flowers), which have both nectaries and stamens more exposed to 
311 
environmental conditions and wind-blown aerosols. Oilseed rape flowers are shallow and 
312 
more frequently visited by short-tongued bees, even though the long-tongued bumblebee B. 
313 
hortorum often collects pollen from this plant (Stanley et al., 2013), and all our B. hortorum 
314 
specimens sampled in farmland in late spring were foraging in these crop flowers when 
315 
collected (Table S2a). Some of the pesticides analysed in this study have been reported to 
316 
degrade after exposure to sun light and/or high temperatures (i.e. some neonicotinoids, 
317 
carbendazim, carboxin, epoxiconazole and prochloraz) (Bonmatin et al., 2015; Burrows et al., 
318 
2002; Mazellier et al., 2002), so it is possible that the flowers with pollen and nectar more 
319 
exposed to the environmental conditions might have lower concentrations of the parent active 
320 
compounds. Therefore, the bees feeding on these shallow flowers would be less exposed to 
321 
them. However, the tongue length range of B. pratorum is not very different to that of the 
322 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
short-tongued bumblebees B. terrestris and B. lapidarius (Table 1). Moreover, the range of 
323 
flowers visited by the three species did not differ remarkably, since more than half (53%) of 
324 
the plant species visited by B. terrestris and B. lapidarius were also visited by B. pratorum in 
325 
May and June (i.e. when concentrations detected were higher) (Tables S2a-2b). Nevertheless, 
326 
as mentioned above, B. terrestris and B. lapidarius showed significantly higher levels of 
327 
pesticide concentrations than B. pratorum, so the tongue length doesn´t seem to be a suitable 
328 
predictor of residue exposure for the group of bumblebees species studied here. Otherwise, a 
329 
bigger sample size might be needed to test this hypothesis.   
330 
Regarding the toxicity of the pesticides detected, it is worth noting that the bumblebee 
331 
specimens collected in the present study were individually processed as whole samples to 
332 
include residues on external as well as internal parts of the bees, so it is not possible to 
333 
differentiate if the pesticides detected were on the cuticle (contact toxicity) or inside the 
334 
organism (oral). Thus, both routes of exposure should be considered when the levels detected 
335 
in the samples are compared to lethal doses reported for the compounds analysed. Moreover, 
336 
as the bee gut was not removed before processing the samples, there is a chance that some of 
337 
the residues detected were present in the nectar and pollen contained in the digestive tract, 
338 
although we consider that the bulk of the bee weights were formed by bee tissues. None of 
339 
the residues detected in bumblebees were found to overlap with contact or oral acute LD50 
340 
values tested on bumblebees or honeybees (Table 2), which is to be expected since the bees 
341 
screened for pesticides in this study were performing foraging tasks and appeared to be 
342 
healthy at the time of collection; it would be very unlikely to catch bees alive had they been 
343 
exposed to lethal doses. Additionally, we cannot determine what doses the bees had been 
344 
exposed to since pesticides are metabolized at varying rates (and we do not know the time of 
345 
exposure), so that the residues we detected represent an unknown proportion of the dose 
346 
received and actual exposures may have probably been higher. It should also be mentioned 
347 
that bees are subjected to chronic exposure when foraging on contaminated flowers, and 
348 
acute LD50s are frequently higher than chronic LD50s, particularly for neonicotinoids (Alkassab 
349 
and Kirchner, 2016; Rondeau et al., 2014). Thus, the potential risk of chronic exposure to the 
350 
levels of pesticides detected in the bumblebees cannot be ruled out. Studies where pesticide 
351 
mixtures are analysed in bees showing health problems or mortality in the field would be of 
352 
high interest (Kasiotis et al., 2014), since this could provide key information about the hazard 
353 
posed by specific mixtures and the threshold levels of risk. Nevertheless, such studies are 
354 
highly challenging to perform in the field due to sampling difficulties, and because the 
355 
detection of accurate levels at the time of death are problematic since bee samples need to be 
356

fresh to avoid degradation of pesticides following exposure to environmental factors and 
357 
microbial activity (Katagi, 2004; Liu et al., 2011). 
358 
Our results revealed that 43.3% of bees contained two or more pesticides, suggesting that 
359 
simultaneous exposure is likely to be encountered regularly in a field realistic scenario. 
360 
Although contamination with mixtures of pesticides has been detected in flower pollen, bee 
361 
collected pollen and bees (David et al., 2016; Hladik et al., 2016; Long and Krupke, 2016; Mullin 
362 
et al., 2010), evaluating the impact of the exposure to such combinations of agrochemicals 
363 
poses a major challenge and warrants more research. A few laboratory and field studies have 
364 
explored the impact of simultaneous exposure to different chemicals on bees, some of them 
365 
reporting detrimental effects of certain combinations (Gill et al., 2012; Iwasa et al., 2004; 
366 
Johnson et al., 2013; Schmuck et al., 2003; Sgolastra et al., 2016; Thompson and Wilkins, 
367 
2003). Given the mixtures detected in bees in the present study and in previous research 
368 
(Hladik et al., 2016; Lambert et al., 2013), the number of possible combinations of pesticides is 
369 
very high and variable. Therefore, focussing on the most frequent ones when performing 
370 
assays of bee exposure might be the most sensible approach. Moreover, these scenarios are 
371 
especially important to consider in cases when two or more pesticides that exhibit synergy are 
372 
detected simultaneously in bees. For instance, the toxicity of certain insecticides (e.g. 
373 
neonicotinoids and pyrethroids) can be enhanced in the presence of demethylation-inhibiting 
374 
(DMI) fungicides (e.g. epoxiconazole, tebuconazole). In our study, 55.6 % of the bumblebees 
375 
where neonicotinoid insecticides were detected also contained DMI-fungicides, so exposure to 
376 
these combinations seems to be likely in the field although it is not known if these 
377 
concentrations were high enough to induce biological effects. These DMI-fungicides can act as 
378 
synergists by inhibiting the detoxification system in bees (Iwasa et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 
379 
2013; Pilling et al., 1995), and thus the insecticide residues are metabolised or eliminated more 
380 
slowly. It is also important to remark that this is a limited list of pesticides; due to analytical 
381 
constrains, insecticides such as pyrethroids, usually detected using gas chromatographic 
382 
methods and which are known to interact with neonicotinoids and DMI-fungicides, could also 
383 
be present in these bees. 
384 
As for the differences in levels of exposure for bees living in farmland or urban habitats, we 
385 
found that concentrations of pesticides in wild bumblebees foraging in agricultural land were 
386 
higher than in urban land, as reported for commercial bumblebee colonies in a previous study 
387 
(David et al., 2016). However, the maximum values for neonicotinoids were recorded in 
388 
bumblebees collected in urban gardens (i.e. 10 ng/g of imidacloprid, 2.35 ng/g of 
389 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
thiamethoxam and 1.4 ng/g of clothianidin), even though these maximum values were high in 
390 
comparison to the levels detected for these compounds in the rest of the bee specimens 
391 
collected, so it is possible that these particular bees had been visiting freshly sprayed plants 
392 
just before they were sampled. The use of imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam has 
393 
been banned since December 2013 on ornamental plants flowering in the year of treatment 
394 
(as well as on flowering crops) (European Commission, 2013), and so the high levels of 
395 
imidacloprid in particular are hard to explain. Nonetheless, the result is corroborated by David 
396 
et al. (2016) who detected high levels (20 ng/g) of imidacloprid in pollen collected by 
397 
commercial bumblebee colonies placed in urban areas. The imidacloprid may be persisting in 
398 
urban environments from applications before the ban, or it might still be available in some 
399 
stores and presumably may be used in gardens for months or even years after the ban. 
400 
Alternatively, this exposure of bees could originate from other uses of imidacloprid; it is widely 
401 
used in baits to kill ants and for flea control in dogs and cats. Orally applied imidacloprid in 
402 
dogs and other mammals is completely eliminated in the urine (70-80%) and faeces (20-30%) 
403 
in 48 h as the main metabolites 6-chloronicotinic acid and its glycine conjugate together with  
404 
significant  amounts  of  the  parent  compound, whereas topical application spreads over the 
405 
skin for 24 hours and the compound is stored in the oil glands of the skin and slowly shed with 
406 
hair and sebum (European Food Safety Authority, 2006; Hovda and Hooser, 2002). The 
407 
environmental impacts of the use of pesticides in ornamental gardens and on pets has been 
408 
scarcely studied (Brown et al., 2013; Fevery et al., 2016). There is no policing of homeowner 
409 
use of garden pesticides to ensure that they follow label instructions, and amounts used in 
410 
gardens are not known. Similarly, we can find no information on the number of dogs and cats 
411 
treated with imidacloprid as a prophylactic flea treatment, and the environmental fate of such 
412 
chemicals has not been studied. Urban gardens are an important food source and refuge for 
413 
bees and other wildlife in cities and towns because they represent the only green space in 
414 
these large environments, and they can host a great diversity of pollinators and high density of 
415 
bumblebee nests (Baldock et al., 2015; Fetridge et al., 2008; Goulson et al., 2010), resulting in 
416 
enhanced pollination services for both urban and nearby agricultural landscapes (Kaluza et al., 
417 
2016; Samnegård et al., 2011; Theodorou et al., 2016). If bees are sometimes exposed to high 
418 
doses of harmful pesticides through forage collected in ornamental gardens, this might be a 
419 
matter of high ecological concern, meaning that more attention should be paid to this route of 
420 
contamination for bees. 
421 
The frequencies of detection and concentrations of agrochemicals in bee tissues decreased 
422 
significantly in midsummer (July), agreeing with findings reported before (Botías et al., 2015; 
423 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
David et al., 2016) where residue levels decreased in the pollen collected by bees as the season 
424 
progressed. Midsummer is usually the period for crop harvesting in the studied area, and 
425 
fewer pesticides are normally applied during this period to crops, so this may partly explain 
426 
this finding. Concurrently, the decrease in residue levels may be due to a reduction in plant 
427 
tissue concentrations, and thus on pollen and nectar collected by bees through summer 
428 
because of plant/soil metabolism, photolysis and increasing temperatures (Bonmatin et al., 
429 
2015; Lassalle et al., 2014; Mazellier et al., 2002). 
430 
Conclusions and perspectives 
431 
The extensive incidence of multiple pesticide residues and the scarcity of scientific literature 
432 
on the biological consequences of exposure to such combinations on wild bees calls for more 
433 
attention on regulatory strategies concerning monitoring procedures and registration of 
434 
agrochemicals as they relate to pollinator protection, since the combined toxicity and 
435 
synergism of all these chemicals may pose a real threat to the health and survival of managed 
436 
and wild bees. Thus, investigations on the toxicological effects of field-realistic levels and 
437 
mixtures are crucial to prevent potential exposure of bees to damaging combinations of 
438 
agrochemicals. Also, the possible impact of metabolites and of agrochemicals other than 
439 
insecticides on bees should not be overlooked, as they could have direct or indirect 
440 
detrimental effects. 
441 
Understanding the factors involved in the degree of exposure, such as the type of flowers that 
442 
tend to incorporate more residues or where certain pesticides are more persistent, as well as 
443 
the morphological and physiological traits of pollinators that makes them more or less 
444 
susceptible to the exposure, is also crucial to mitigate the damaging effects for the most 
445 
vulnerable species. 
446 
Finally, the widespread detection of pesticides in bumblebees foraging in urban areas indicates 
447 
a pressing need for further research on the prevalence and doses present in ornamental 
448 
gardens, and on the environmental fate of pesticides upon domestic uses in order to better 
449 
inform homeowners and garden centers of the potential risk the use of these products poses. 
450 
Furthermore, surveillance programs on domestic uses would improve the current lack of safety 
451 
and control in the application of agrochemicals in non-commercial agricultural situations. 
452 
Our results show evidence that wild bumblebees are frequently exposed to mixtures of 
453 
agrochemicals when they forage in arable and urban habitats, with peak concentrations 
454 
decreasing through the season. The effects of exposure to pesticide mixtures in wild bees 
455 
Accepted manuscript
  
 
 
remain to be determined, but studying the temporal distribution of such combinations in 
456 
habitats favored by bees is crucial to identify timing and routes of pesticide exposure, which 
457 
may help us to properly direct our conservation efforts regarding pesticide regulation and bee 
458 
health protection.

Table 2. Frequencies of detection (%), maximum concentrations (Max), average (Avg) and 
738 
median values (Mdn)(ng/g) of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides detected in wild 
739 
bumblebees. The analytical methods do not allow us to differentiate what fraction of the 
740 
pesticide was on the surface (contact toxicity) or inside the bumblebee (oral) since all 
741 
specimens were individually processed as whole samples. Therefore, LD50 values of contact (C) 
742 
and/or oral (O) toxicity for honeybees (hb) or bumblebees (bb), according to availability of 
743 
data (Sánchez-Bayo and Goka, 2014), are reported for each of the pesticides that were 
744 
detected in wild bumblebees.

Figure 1. Location of sites in East Sussex (UK), where wild bumblebees were collected from 
farmland sites (circles) and urban sites (squares). The sites selected to collect bees in 
agricultural land consisted of arable fields within mixed farms, where the predominant crops 
were oilseed rape, winter wheat and spring barley, and part of the land was pasture. The 
urban sampling sites consisted of ornamental public gardens and parks surrounded by houses 
that had private gardens in most cases.
