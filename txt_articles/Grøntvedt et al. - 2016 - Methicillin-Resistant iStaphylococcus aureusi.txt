Background.
Emerging livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) persist in livestock populations
and represent a reservoir for transmission to humans. Understanding the routes of introduction and further transmission is crucial to
control this threat to human health.
Methods.
All reported cases of livestock-associated MRSA (CC398) in humans and pigs in Norway between 2008 and 2014 were
included. Data were collected during an extensive outbreak investigation, including contact tracing and stringent surveillance.
Whole-genome sequencing of isolates from all human cases and pig farms was performed to support and expand the epidemiological
findings. The national strategy furthermore included a “search-and-destroy” policy at the pig farm level.
Results.
Three outbreak clusters were identified, including 26 pig farms, 2 slaughterhouses, and 36 humans. Primary introduc-
tions likely occurred by human transmission to 3 sow farms with secondary transmission to other pig farms, mainly through animal
trade and to a lesser extent via humans or livestock trucks. All MRSA CC398 isolated from humans without an epidemiological link
to the outbreaks were genetically distinct from isolates within the outbreak clusters indicating limited dissemination to the general
population.
Conclusions.
This study identified preventable routes of MRSA CC398 introduction and transmission: human occupational ex-
posure, trade of pigs and livestock transport vehicles. These findings are essential for keeping pig populations MRSA free and, from a
“One Health” perspective, preventing pig farms from becoming reservoirs for MRSA transmission to humans.
Keywords.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main causes of nosocomial
and community-acquired infections, and methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA) infections are associated with increased mor-
bidity and mortality rates and costs [1, 2]. For a long time,
MRSA was almost exclusively a healthcare-associated problem,
but the epidemiology has changed significantly since the late
1990s with dissemination of community-associated MRSA,
and with further changes since the mid-2000s caused by emerg-
ing MRSA strains with a primary reservoir in livestock [3, 4].
Livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has now spread
worldwide, especially in pig farms where it is transmitted to
humans mainly by occupational exposure [5–7]. In countries
with a low overall prevalence of MRSA in humans, such as Den-
mark and the Netherlands, LA-MRSA has greatly affected the
notification rate of MRSA in humans and is increasingly
found in persons without livestock contact [8–10].
LA-MRSA in pig holdings in Europe most commonly belong
to the clonal complex (CC) 398, but the prevalence varies great-
ly among European countries, with up to 70% of all farms pos-
itive in Denmark and the Netherlands [8, 11]. In contrast,
several surveillance programs conducted in Norway, including
the 2008 European Union baseline study and 2 more recent na-
tionwide population surveillance programs, found either an ab-
sence or a very low prevalence of LA-MRSA in pigs [12–14].
Trade in pigs has been identified as the major risk factor for in-
terfarm transmission of LA-MRSA [15, 16], including trans-
boundary transmission [17]. In the period from 2000 to 2015,
<80 live pigs were imported into the Norwegian commercial
pig population, most of these in 2 separate imports of 49 and
20 breeding animals from Finland and the Netherlands respec-
tively [18]. In the latter import, the animals were tested and
confirmed to be negative for MRSA. Thus, the Norwegian pig
population is de facto a “closed” production system.

 The objective of the present study was to describe the first
known introductions and transmission of MRSA CC398 in pig
herds and the subsequent spread to humans in Norway. As a
“One Health” initiative, the study included all identified cases of
MRSA CC398 in humans and pigs in Norway from 2008 to 2014.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MRSA Investigations in Pigs
MRSA in the Norwegian pig population was first investigated in
an European Union baseline study in 2008, which did not detect
LA-MRSA [12]. In 2011 and 2012, anonymized prevalence
studies demonstrated MRSA CC398 in a few samples from a
single slaughterhouse and a pig herd [13, 14]. In early 2013,
two independent identifiable findings of MRSA CC398 in the
Norwegian pig population initiated a public health risk assess-
ment concerning the possible impacts of an increasing preva-
lence of LA-MRSA in pigs. This prompted an investigation to
identify and control the transmission of MRSA CC398 to pig
farms and humans. Norwegian authorities implemented a strat-
egy including a farm-level “search-and-destroy” policy to pre-
vent the establishment of LA-MRSA in the Norwegian pig
population. In 2014, a nationwide surveillance program of all
sow farms (n = 986) was initiated to investigate the prevalence
of MRSA in the pig population [19].
The outbreak-related investigation collected epidemiological
data from farmers by questionnaires (Supplementary, Table 1)
and included both human and animal contact tracing. Demo-
graphic information, farm characteristics, husbandry and pro-
duction details were collected. In total, 74 pig farms and 5
slaughterhouses were included and sampled in the outbreak in-
vestigation during 2013 and 2014 (Supplementary Appendix 1).
MRSA Investigations in Humans
Human MRSA infections have been notifiable to the Norwegian
surveillance system for communicable diseases (MSIS) since
1995 and MRSA carriage has been notifiable since 2005 [20].
Humans are investigated for MRSA based on clinical signs of
infection, admission screening in healthcare facilities, contact
tracing and outbreak investigations [21]. All human MRSA
CC398 cases reported to MSIS were included.
Epidemiological data on all persons occupationally exposed
to pigs in the current outbreaks were collected (Supplementary,
Table 2). Household members were sampled if they were pa-
tients in healthcare institutions, worked as healthcare person-
nel, or if a farm or abattoir worker was found to be MRSA
positive. MRSA screening samples from humans were collected
from the vestibulum nasi, throat, and skin lesions (if present). In
total, 272 persons were included.
Bacteriological Analyses
All samples from animals and environment were investigated
for MRSA using the protocol described by the European Food
Safety Authority [22]. Human MRSA samples taken as part of
the outbreak investigation were analyzed at 7 medical microbi-
ological laboratories using slightly different methods (Supple-
mentary Appendix 2).
The national reference laboratory for MRSA confirmed pre-
sumptive MRSA isolates from human, animal and environmen-
tal samples with polymerase chain reaction detection of the
mecA, spa, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes, using poly-
merase chain reaction protocols described elsewhere [23, 24];
spa typing was performed on all isolates (http://www.
spaserver.ridom.de/). Multilocus sequence typing was per-
formed on new spa types as described by Enright et al [25].
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed, along with
detection of resistance and virulence markers and phylogenetic
analysis of MRSA CC398 from all pig farms, all human cases
reported in Norway, and selected MRSA CC398 isolates from
other countries (Supplementary Appendix 3).
Statistical Analyses
The data were collected with the objective of prevention and
control of transmission of MRSA and not as a part of a planned
scientific study. Stata software (version 13; StataCorp) was used
to calculate attack rates and odds ratios (ORs) of MRSA among
persons distributed by occupational exposure and pig farms dis-
tributed by type of pig production.

 RESULTS
Overview of MRSA CC398 in Norway
The first human case of MRSA CC398 was notified in March
2009, and by the end of 2014, a total of 84 human cases had
been reported, including human cases identified through out-
break investigations (Figure 1). The first traceable finding of
LA-MRSA in pigs occurred in February 2013, and by the end
of 2014, outbreak investigations and surveillance had identified
MRSA CC398 in 26 pig farms (Table 1), 2 slaughterhouses and
36 humans (Table 2). Epidemiological data placed these farms
and persons in 3 clusters located in, or originating from, central
eastern (outbreaks 1 and 3) and southwestern (outbreak 2) Nor-
way (Figure 2). MRSA isolates from animals, environment and
humans in these 3 clusters belonged to the following CC398-as-
sociated spa types: t034 in outbreak 1, t034 and t12359 in out-
break 2, and t011 in outbreak 3. The findings were further
supported by WGS-based phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Appendix 4). MRSA CC398 detected in samples
from a slaughterhouse in the anonymized survey of 2011
(NORM-VET 2011) was shown by WGS to be related to isolates
in outbreak 1 (Figure 3). Most pig farms in outbreak 1 regularly
supplied this slaughterhouse.
A single pig isolate from the 2012 survey and 48 human isolates
not epidemiologically linked to the 3 outbreaks described were all
genetically distinct from the isolates in the outbreak clades
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Appendix 4). Based on information
reported to MSIS, 25 (52%) of the human cases not linked to the
outbreak clusters had probably acquired MRSA CC398 abroad.
Introductions of MRSA CC398 to the Pig Population
The index cases in the 3 outbreaks were identified through sam-
ples collected from a postmortem examination of a fattening pig
in February 2013 (outbreak 1), clinical infection in a farm work-
er in June 2013 (outbreak 2) and in a national surveillance pro-
gram of sow farms in June 2014 (outbreak 3). Contact tracing
identified 2 primary case sow farms having supplied the index
case farms in outbreaks 1 and 2. The index case farm in out-
break 3 was considered the primary case farm. All primary
case farms had farm workers and/or consultants originating
from other European countries. The use of foreign labor was
common; 24 of 62 (39%) of the sow farm workers and 4 of
63 (6%) of the finishing pig farm workers were of non-Norwe-
gian nationality. The majority of foreign workers (25 of 28) were
from Eastern Europe, and the remaining 3 were from Denmark
(n = 2) or the Netherlands (n = 1). None of the farms investigat-
ed had imported pigs from abroad. WGS data from both human
and pig isolates in outbreaks 1 and 2 demonstrated a close ge-
netic relationship with isolates identified in Denmark, whereas
isolates from outbreak 3 showed genetic relatedness to MRSA
CC398 t011 strains from several European countries, including
Denmark (Figure 3).
Further Transmission
The trade of pigs was identified as the main route of MRSA
CC398 transmission from the 3 primary case farms. This was
considered the most likely route of transmission to 19 farms.
In 3 farms, the most probable explanation for transmission

One farm had 2 separate introductions of MRSA CC398
(t034 and t011), based on epidemiological information support-
ed by WGS data, and was involved in both outbreaks 2 and
3. The trade of pigs or contact through personnel was excluded
as the route of reintroduction to this farm. A livestock transport
vehicle had twice transported pigs from a MRSA CC398–positive
finishing farm to a slaughterhouse without subsequent disinfec-
tion shortly before transporting pigs to the farm involved and was
considered the most likely transmission route. Pigs from MRSA
CC398–positive farms were slaughtered at 5 slaughterhouses in

 southern Norway, and MRSA was detected in samples from pigs,
personnel, or the environment in 2 of these (Figure 2).
In total, 48 of 74 farms sampled during outbreak investiga-
tions were identified as MRSA negative. Twelve farms were
sampled because they had supplied pigs to MRSA CC398–
positive farms, and 4 farms had contact through MRSA
CC398–positive veterinary practitioners. Of the 51 farms that
had received pigs from MRSA CC398–positive farms, 32 were
MRSA negative. Of these 32 farms, 14 had received pigs from
farms in which MRSA CC398 had most likely only been recent-
ly introduced, 12 had been only sporadically supplied, and 6
had changed suppliers and had washed and disinfected the pre-
mises before the change of supplying herd.
Of the 36 human cases included in the outbreaks, 33 were de-
tected through contact tracing. Three were identified through
notification to MSIS, and subsequently linked to the outbreaks
by epidemiological data, supported by WGS results (Figure 3
and Supplementary Appendix 4). All 36 persons had direct
and regular contact with positive pigs (Table 2). No differences
in the MRSA prevalence between different types of occupational
exposure were observed.
DISCUSSION
The present study encompasses all identified cases of MRSA
CC398 in humans and pigs in Norway, between 2008 and
2014. All the traceable detections of MRSA CC398 in pig
farms and slaughterhouses were clustered in 3 separate out-
breaks. Furthermore, 43% (36 of 84) of all human MRSA
CC398 cases in the period were related to these outbreaks.
The study strongly suggests that the outbreaks were caused by
human introduction of MRSA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the introduced MRSA strains were closely related to strains
isolated in other European countries. The isolates from the pri-
mary case farms in outbreaks 1 and 2 showed close genetic re-
latedness to MRSA CC398 isolates from Denmark, and persons
linked to the 2 farms had known contact with pig farms in Den-
mark. Furthermore, the primary case farm in outbreak 3
involved farm workers from abroad, although without con-
firmed livestock contact outside Norway.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe
the importance of the human introduction of MRSA CC398
to livestock populations. Because there is virtually no import
of live pigs to Norway, human transmission of LA-MRSA
should be regarded as the most important route of introduction
into the Norwegian pig population. Our findings are therefore
highly relevant for the future prevention of LA-MRSA introduc-
tion to pig populations, at both national and farm levels.
Based on other studies, the trade of pigs has been shown to be
the predominant route of transmission of MRSA CC398 among
pigs [15, 16], including transboundary transmission [17]. Do-
mestic trade in pigs was found to be the main route of interfarm
transmission of MRSA after primary introductions, indicating
that limiting the number of farms connected through trade is
important in preventing MRSA transmission. In addition, we
found humans, and in one case a livestock truck, to be the
most likely explanation for MRSA transmission to farms not
connected through the trade of pigs. These transmission routes
may further constitute routes of dissemination to other seg-
ments of the animal population.
Our results show that 32 of 51 pig farms that had purchased
pigs from MRSA-positive suppliers were found to be MRSA
negative at the time of sampling. This may be because the sup-
plying farms were not MRSA positive when the animals were
delivered or because management practices and hygiene rou-
tines prevented MRSA from becoming established in the recip-
ient farms, the latter explanation being the most likely in at least
6 farms. This indicates that changing to a supplier with a
MRSA-negative herd (all in–all out) combined with good rou-
tines for washing and disinfecting facilities may be effective
measures to prevent MRSA establishment on finishing pig
farms. These findings are supported by results from the Norwe-
gian control strategy for LA-MRSA in the pig population and
may also be relevant for pig farms in other countries [26].
Other studies have identified direct contact with positive an-
imals as a major risk factor for MRSA CC398 in humans, and to
a lesser extent indirect contact [5, 27, 28]. In addition, an in-
creased incidence rate of MRSA CC398 in the general public
without contact with pig farms has been described from areas
with a high density of pig herds [8, 9, 29]. In the present
study, we did not observe the transmission of MRSA CC398
from the outbreaks to the general public. This may be partly ex-
plained by the relatively short exposure times, because all pigs
on MRSA CC398–positive farms were slaughtered, and the
holding facilities thoroughly washed and disinfected.
Public health surveillance data from Norway show that more
than one-third of all reported human MRSA cases have ac-
quired MRSA abroad [12, 30]. An increased prevalence of
MRSA on Norwegian pig farms could change this epidemiolog-
ical situation by constituting a new domestic reservoir for
MRSA, leading to an increase of the total public health burden
of MRSA. Such a development has been described in Denmark,
where the rapid spread of MRSA CC398 in the pig population
has led this to be the dominant clone found in humans [8]. The
rapid increase of MRSA CC398 in humans in other low-endem-
ic countries, along with results from the present study, high-
lights the importance of control measures to prevent the
introduction and further transmission of MRSA CC398 in pig
populations. The present Norwegian control strategy includes
targeted screening of personnel before working in pig herds, an-
nual national surveillance of the pig population ,and contact
tracing with eradication measures, resembling a search-and-
destroy strategy. The preliminary results of testing in herds
after the implementation of MRSA eradication measures show
that this strategy has largely been effective [26].

 Some of the data described herein were collected to control
outbreaks and, although extensive, were not fully comprehensive.
Only household contacts of occupationally exposed MRSA
CC398–positive humans were screened, so bias may have been
introduced regarding the detection of further spread. The WGS
analysis was compared to available sequences primarily from
Denmark; thus, the relatedness to isolates from other countries
was explored to a lesser extent. The major strengths of the
study are the extensive outbreak investigations and the active sur-
veillance programs in the pig population, together with manda-
tory notification of all human MRSA diagnoses, giving a near-
complete description of MRSA CC398 in Norway.
In conclusion, this study confirms that the trade of pigs and
occupational exposure are the major risk factors for transmis-
sion of MRSA CC398 between humans and pigs. However,
the primary introductions leading to the 3 outbreak clusters
cannot be explained by the trade of animals. In these cases,
both the epidemiological and the WGS data indicate that
these introductions were the result of human-to-animal trans-
mission. In addition, further transmission probably occurred
via humans and livestock transport vehicles to farms not con-
nected to MRSA CC398–positive farms through the trade of live
animals. These findings have important implications for risk
management to prevent the dissemination of MRSA CC398
among farms. In Norway, we believe that the prevention of
human introduction of LA-MRSA is of the utmost importance
if the current ambitious strategy to control LA-MRSA is to
prove feasible and successful in the longer term.
