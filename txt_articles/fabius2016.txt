Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the hypothesis that stock
market performance of companies achieving high scores on either health or
safety in the Corporate Health Achievement Award (CHAA) process will be
superior to average index performance. Methods: The stock market per-
formance of portfolios of CHAA winners was examined under six different
scenarios using simulation and past market performance in tests of associ-
ation framed to inform the investor community. Results: CHAA portfolios
out-performed the S&P average on all tests. Conclusions: This study adds to
the growing evidence that a healthy and safe workforce correlates with a
company’s performance and its ability to provide positive returns to share-
holders. It advances the idea that a proven set of health and safety metrics
based on the CHAA evaluation process merits inclusion with existing
measures for market valuation.
T
his article tests the hypothesis that the stock market performance
of companies that achieve high-scoring assessments in either
health or safety during the Corporate Health Achievement Award
(CHAA) process will be superior to average market-index perform-
ance. The CHAAwas established in 1995 by the American College of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) to recognize
the healthiest, safest companies and organizations in North America
andto raise awareness of best practices inworkplace health andsafety
programs.1 Since the introduction of the first awards in 1996, 31
companies have achieved distinction as CHAA recipients. These
companies have demonstrated outstanding achievement and excel-
lence in employee health, safety and environmental management,
outcomes, and trends. Companies that participate in the CHAA
process and at score high in just one component may receive the
CHAA Model Program Award,signifying their excellence inone area
but not overall excellence in both health and safety.
Applicants for the CHAA are judged on 17 standards in four
general categories: Leadership and Management, Healthy Workers,
Healthy Environments, and Healthy Organizations. A series of
points are awarded in each category, with the maximum number
of points possible being 1000. The 17 standards, distributed
throughout the four categories, address various aspects of workplace
safety, health, and wellness. The scoring for each standard is based
on a four-level system.
Level 1. Program Description
Organizations provide evidence that appropriate programs
exist for each CHAA standard. CHAA applicants must clearly
delineate relevant programs they have implemented, while demon-
strating how these programs meet the CHAA standards.
Level 2. Program Dissemination
Organizations provide evidence that the programs are well
deployed in all appropriate areas and departments.
Level 3. Outcome Measures
Organizations demonstrate that they have created a metrics
system for their safety, wellness, and health programs and provide
clear data on what is being measured.
Level 4. Trend Data
Organizations present trend data showing a reduction of
health risk, health-cost savings, or other impact on the business
as a result of their safety, wellness, and health programs. Trend data
demonstrate the success of these programs over time.
Points are awarded for each of the 17 standards within the
four categories and each category has a maximum number of points
of 250. Table 1 provides a comprehensive view of the categories,
standards, and scoring for the CHAA. The transparency of the
scoring system and process offers aspiring organizations insight into
what is required so that corporate leadership can better guide their
companies to success.
BACKGROUND
In recent decades, U.S. employers have made significant
progress in addressing issues of health and safety in the workplace.
Since 1970, workplace fatalities have been reduced by more than
65% and injury and illness rates have declined by 67%, according to

Worker deaths have been reduced from approximately 38 per
day in 1970 to 12 per day in 2012.2
Coinciding with these advances in safety was the rise of a
workplace wellness movement in the United States, driven in part by
rising health care costs in the 1970s and 1980s.3 As costs increased,
employers began to introduce worksite health promotion programs
on a large scale in an effort to keep their employees healthier and
thus reduce health care cost impacts on their employee health plans.
More recently, this has led enlightened employers to build a more
comprehensive approach in the workplace, creating what are termed
‘‘cultures of health and wellbeing’’ and ‘‘cultures of safety.’’4
As a consequence, among the fastest growing disciplines
within the occupational health and safety community over the last
decade has been health and productivity management (HPM)—a
strategic approach to workplace health and safety that focuses on
identifying the total impact of employee health on business results
and reducing impacts on performance and productivity costs—such
as absenteeism and presenteeism—through targeted health and
safety programming. Engaging in a comprehensive effort to
promote wellness, reduce worker safety risks, and mitigate the
complications of chronic illness within workplace populations
can produce remarkable effects on health care costs, productivity,
and performance.5
Recent studies have begun linking worker health with the
market performance of companies.6 In 2013, a seminal study
tracked the stock market performance of publicly traded companies
that had received the CHAA as a result of their strong health, safety,
and environmental programs.7 Using simulation and past market-
performance, a theoretical initial $10,000 investment in these
publicly traded companies over a 13- to-15-year span was shown
by Fabius et al7 to outperform the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500)
using four different financial models. Although correlation is not the
same as causation, the stock market performance of the award-
winning companies versus S&P 500 results consistently suggests
that companies focusing on the health and safety of their workforce
can yield greater value for their investors, demonstrating competi-
tive advantage in the marketplace (Figure 1).
The rise of interest in health and safety measures as indicators
of corporate value is gaining traction among thought leaders, who
believe a universal system of health and safety metrics reporting
could emerge as a new standard of valuation, much as social and
environmental
sustainability
emerged
as
corporate valuation
indicators via the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) in the
late 1990s.8
In August 2014, the Vitality Institute, a global research
organization focusing on workplace health, published Integrating
Health Metrics into Health Reporting, a concept paper advancing
the idea of public reporting of workforce health measures as a
means of gauging corporate performance and better informing
the investment community. In making the case for establishment
of universal health and safety metrics, Tryon et al9 noted that such a
system could help U.S. employers overcome many of the
barriers that keep them from achieving a more widespread culture
of health in the workplace. The integration of health metrics into
corporate reporting, they noted, ‘‘builds leadership and advocacy
both within organizations and outside organizations to highlight the

importance of prevention within businesses as a national strategic
imperative.’’
Otherorganizations are exploring similar ideas internationally.
InSouthAfrica,forexample,financialservicescompany Discoveryis
partnering with the University of Cambridge and RAND Europe to
assess worker health in South African companies using a healthy-
company index.The index,whichwaslaunchedin2011,measuresthe
impact of chronic disease and health and safety programming on
South African companies and provides a system for them to
measure the health status of their employees. A study of the index
by University of Cambridge and RAND Europe is underway.10
A United Kingdom led initiative of international companies
has developed a series of metrics for public reporting on employee
engagement and wellbeing known as the Business in the Com-
munity (BITC) Public Reporting Guidelines.11 The metrics will be
updated periodically to reflect best practices and is a means of
measuring, reporting, and tracking employee wellbeing as an
indicator of business success.
Workplace health and safety experts in the United States
recently published a guidance paper for employers, proposing a new
framework for integrating health and safety programs. Importantly,
the paper introduced the concept of an Integrated Health and Safety
Index (IHS Index) for employers and investors, enabling them to
more accurately measure the business value of their health and
safety programs. On the basis of the methodology of the widely used
DJSI, the IHS Index measures results across economic, environ-
mental, and social dimensions.8
Taken together, these factors suggest that companies recog-
nized for the excellence of their health and safety programs perform
better in the market. This study attempts to refine our understanding
of what factors contribute to enhanced performance in the market by
examining the impact of companies’ health and safety programs
independently: Is the stock market performance of companies with
such programs, judged separately on their merits by the CHAA,
superior to the average performance of other companies? If so,
might it be possible to use elements of the CHAA process to create
an additional data set that would help the corporate and investment
community determine market valuation?
METHODS
To objectively explore this question, we tracked the stock
market performance of companies with proven health and/or safety
programs under six different scenarios. We studied companies that
have applied for ACOEM’s CHAA, as this award program assesses
not only a company’s health and wellness activities but also its
environmental and safety programs. The methodology utilized was
similar to the method used by Fabius et al7 in the 2013 CHAA study.
The modeling entailed building portfolios of CHAA-participating
companies that scored high in either health or safety, along with
CHAA-participating companies that scored high in both categories.
The hypothetical portfolios would then be rebalanced for each year
of the study period—1997 to 2014—to reflect changes that would
have occurred over the space of those years as new high-scoring
companies were identified and added as a result of the yearly CHAA
process. Unlike the 2013 study, the dividends in this study were
reinvested annually in both the experimental and the comparison
S&P models.
The first step was to review all applicants of the CHAA from
1997 through 2014. Companies were identified that had scored over
175 or 200 in the Healthy Organizations category (which measures
health and wellness) out of a perfect score of 250 and over 350 or
400 in the Healthy Workers and Healthy Environments categories
(which measure safety) out of a perfect score of 500. A score of 200
in the Healthy Organizations category and a score of 400 in the
Healthy Workers and Healthy Environments categories represented
the median score among the applicants and award recipients. To
ensure a broader mix of companies, and to minimize the influence of
a few companies that scored extremely high in the health and safety
categories, we lowered the median score by an additional 12.5%.
Next, we determined which of these companies were publicly traded
on the stock market and developed six portfolios from these cohorts.
As all six portfolios were selected from these publicly traded high-
scoring companies, they had considerable overlap.
Using simulation and past market performance, a theoretical
initial $10,000 investment in publicly traded award winners and
applicants that scored above the thresholds in either safety or health
and wellness—or both—was followed, starting with at least five
companies on the first trading day in January 2001. The hypothetical
portfolios were then re-balanced ‘‘annually’’ on the first trading day
in July that would have occurred in each of the studied years of 1997
to 2014 to coincide with the announcement of new CHAA award
recipients. New high-scoring companies were added during the
rebalancing of investments. In some years, more than one company
was added. In other years, no new company scored high enough to
be included. The investment portfolio ended on the last day of
trading in 2014.
Several companies received the CHAA more than once.
When companies scored a second or third time with a qualifying
value, that is, above 175 in health and wellness and 350 in safety, the
portfolio doubled or tripled its investment in them and maintained
that ‘‘over-weighting’’ for the remainder of the study.
In addition, companies that were included in a portfolio but
were subsequently acquired by other companies were eliminated
from that portfolio on the last trading day of the June before the
transaction and just before adding new high-scoring companies and
re-balancing the portfolios. Finally, dividends were re-invested
quarterly in both the S&P control portfolio and the customized
portfolios. It should be noted that applicants who scored high in
either safety or health and wellness but not high enough in both to
receive the CHAAwere included in the respective portfolios but are
not disclosed in this paper.i
RESULTS
In the first portfolio, 16 companies achieving a score greater
than 175 in the health and wellness category were compared to the
S&P (Table 2). From 2001 through 2014, the portfolio’s return was
333% compared with the S&P, which had a return of 105% during
the same period (Figure 2). It is important to note that three
companies were doubly invested because they achieved a rating
of greater than 175 in two separate CHAA applications. Because
applicants that participate in, but do not receive, the CHAA are not
publicly identified; their entries in Tables 2, 3, and 4 are listed as
‘‘Company A or B.’’
We then looked at companies that scored 200 or higher in the
health and wellness category and compared their earnings to the
S&P. Of the 16 in the previous portfolio, only 11 of these companies
were in the second portfolio. The earnings level during the period
2001 and 2014 for these companies was 204%, compared with the
S&P performance of 105%.
Next, we looked at companies that scored above 350 in the
safety category and compared their earnings with the S&P (Table 3).
These companies outperformed the S&P and achieved a return of
314%, versus the S&P’s 105% (Figure 3). In this category, four
companies were doubly invested, that is, they achieved a rating of
greater than 350 in two separate CHAA applications. One company
was triply invested, having achieved a ranking of greater than 350 in
safety over three CHAA applications.
i Companies that enter the CHAA but do not receive an award are informed that
their entry into the competition will not be disclosed publicly. This is in keeping
with the aim of the CHAA to provide feedback from reviewers to promote quality
improvement and to allow companies to re-apply at a later date.

A fourth portfolio was developed that encompassed companies with
safety scores greater than 400. There were a total of 12 companies in
this portfolio and their earnings for the 2001 to 2014 period were
319%, compared with the S&P earnings of 105%.
The final two portfolios we developed examined combined
safety and health and wellness scores as follows.
Portfolio 5 included CHAA applicants with a health score of
greater than 175 and a safety score greater than 350. There were a
total of 16 companies in Portfolio 5 (Table 4).
Portfolio 6 contained those CHAA applicants that achieved a health
score greater than 200 and a safety score higher than 400. Ten
companies were included in Portfolio 6.
The return on investment for Portfolio 5 was 333% (Figure 4)
and Portfolio 6 achieved a return of 279% compared with the S&P
return of 105% during the same period. Table 5 reports the per-
formance of all six portfolios in the study (Figure 5).

The results provide evidence that the stock appreciation of
companies that are recognized for excellence in health and wellness,

safety, or both, outperforms that of other companies that have not
been so recognized. Although they did not tease out the contri-
butions that may have been made on other dimensions on which
these companies may also have excelled, these results are consistent
with—and augment—the growing body of work that is associating
excellence in health, wellness, and safety with superior financial
performance in the marketplace. When we deconstructed the CHAA
process and established portfolios among the applicants and award
winners that achieved threshold scores in either health or safety as
well as threshold scores in both, they all outperformed other
companies, using the S&P 500 standard index as a measure. There
was a considerable overlap among the portfolios and the difference
between them may be only a few companies. This may explain why
the portfolio using a threshold of 175 in the health scoring out-
performed the portfolio with a threshold of 200 and therefore the
stock performance was not linear to the health score. The few
companies that dropped out were high performing. This study
suggests that a health and wellness score of 175 and a safety score
of 400 should be recognized as thresholds going forward, as they
correlated with the highest stock performance. However, when
evaluating their combined performance, a safety score of 350
and a health and wellness score of 175 should be used.
There is increasing evidence that companies that integrate
their health and safety efforts, building a culture of health and
wellness along with a culture of safety, are likely to have a
competitive advantage in the marketplace.7,8,12–17 This information
should become increasingly important to corporate leadership and
the investment community. Although there is ample evidence that a
healthy and safe workforce can tangibly contribute to the bottom
line of most self-insured midsized and large employers, demon-
strated causality may not be necessary to inform investors. For an
investment community that is consistently seeking new correlations
to inform their strategies, the results of this paper may be sufficient
to attract their attention. Perhaps this paper can provide a stepping
stone to a future where elements of the CHAA process are incorp-
orated into a much larger list of assessment metrics that the invest-
ment community already uses to inform its decisions.
A recently published paper by Loeppke et al8 emphasized the
importance of integrating health promotion and health protection.
This paper suggests that the CHAA assessment process should be
realigned to follow the format of the DJSI. The CHAA’s current
categories of measurement would be converted to mirror the DJSI’s
categories, which include economic, environmental, and social
metrics. This would result in an Integrated Health and Safety Index
(HIS).
Imagine a future scenario in which employers of sufficient
size would be required or encouraged to publicly report on the
degree to which they have achieved a culture of integrated health
and safety. Those that report high Integrated Health and Safety
Index scores could potentially be rewarded in the marketplace with
greater investment as well as premium cost-reductions for group
health and/or workers’ compensation insurance. This would provide
a major incentive for more companies to focus on the health and
safety of their workforces and markedly aid in addressing many of
the factors that are driving the American health care crisis—
including the rise of chronic disease. If enough companies were
able to improve and sustain the health status of their workforces, it
could impact millions of Americans, providing a national tipping
point in our effort to improve health outcomes and lower costs. The
data in this paper suggest that such an effort might also contribute to
investment-oriented opportunities and company differentiation in
the marketplace.

workforces and market performance, but it does not imply

causation. We recognize that many additional factors are required
for companies to out-perform others in the stock market, including
efficient production, product development, quality management,
marketing and sales, and customer service, among others. For this
reason, it is difficult to determine whether companies that empha-
size the health and safety of their workforce are companies that also
do many other important things right or whether these healthy
workforces make it possible for companies do many other things
right.
All portfolios consisted of only a few companies at any one
time, from 5 to 22, which may allow outliers to influence the results.
This study was only able to include those companies with high
safety and health and wellness scores that were publicly traded,
eliminating approximately 15% of companies that were privately
held. Lastly, all portfolios had a considerable overlap—holding
many companies in common—making differentiation difficult.
FUTURE RESEARCH
To further clarify the influence that health and safety pro-
grams have on stock performance, it may be worth comparing
CHAA recipients to the average performance of similar companies
in their particular sector or to conduct a comparison study against
key competitors that are not CHAA recipients. This would control
for the impact of high-performing business sectors. As the number
of CHAA applicants increase, it should be possible to create
portfolios deconstruct the assessment process further in order to
determine which elements scored have the greatest influence on the
ability of a company to outperform, I as identified in this study.
Lastly, it may possible to compare the stock performance of a group
of non-CHAA companies that perform well in other business
measures (product development, marketing, and so on) with
CHAA companies that have also performed well in these other
measures—focusing on the health and safety of their workforces
to determine the additional impact this effort can have on
marketplace performance.
CONCLUSION
This study adds to the growing evidence that a healthy and
safe workforce correlates with a company’s performance and its
ability to provide positive returns to shareholders. Moreover, this
study demonstrates that employers that include in their approach to
workforce productivity significant investments in the health and/or
safety of their employees outperform the S&P 500 in the market-
place. Specifically, it shows that companies that achieve a threshold
of 175 in health and 350 in safety in the CHAA rating system
perform well in the marketplace.
These results suggest that there should be significant interest
in employers utilizing the newly proposed IHS Index—developed as
a next-generation enhancement to the CHAA and consistent with
the economic, environmental, and social domains of the DJSI—as
an important index of metrics that can correlate with financial
performance.8 Just as investors use the DJSI to distinguish organ-
izations that operate in an ethical manner with an emphasis on long-
term performance, they could use the IHS Index to assess an
employer’s commitment to workforce health and safety as they
build portfolios of sustainable companies.
