Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing isolates have become increasingly prevalent worldwide, and these or-
ganisms are often multidrug resistant, limiting the therapeutic options available for treating infections. We evaluated the activ-
ity of meropenem combined with the serine �-lactamase inhibitor vaborbactam (formerly RPX7009) against 315 serine carbap-
enemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates by use of checkerboard-designed panels to assess the optimal inhibitor
concentration (range tested, 0.5 to 32 �g/ml). Overall, meropenem alone (MIC50 and MIC90, 16 and >64 �g/ml, respectively)
inhibited only 2.2% of the isolates at <1 �g/ml (the CLSI susceptibility breakpoint) and 7.3% of the isolates at <2 �g/ml (the
EUCAST breakpoint). Vaborbactam restored meropenem activity for 72.7 to 98.1% of CPE isolates at <2 �g/ml, and maximum
potentiation was achieved with fixed concentrations of >8 �g/ml of the inhibitor (>96.5% of isolates were inhibited at <2
�g/ml of meropenem-vaborbactam). Meropenem-vaborbactam with a fixed concentration of 8 �g/ml of the inhibitor (MIC50,
<0.06 �g/ml for all organisms) inhibited 93.7% of the CPE isolates displaying elevated meropenem MICs at <1 �g/ml. Mero-
penem-vaborbactam MICs were elevated for isolates producing metallo-�-lactamases (MIC, 16 to >64 �g/ml) or displaying de-
creased expression of OmpK37 and/or elevated expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux system (MIC, 16 �g/ml). Vaborbactam
showed no antibacterial activity alone (all MICs, >64 �g/ml). Meropenem-vaborbactam appears to be a good candidate for fur-
ther development and it could increase the options for treatment of serious infections caused by carbapenemase-producing
pathogens.
C
arbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates have
been detected worldwide, and their increasing prevalence is
mainly due to the dissemination of isolates producing carbapen-
emases, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and
metallo-�-lactamases (largely NDM but also IMP and VIM) (1).
Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteria-
ceae (CPE) became a serious cause of concern among infectious
diseases and clinical microbiology professionals worldwide be-
cause these infections are difficult to manage (2–4). CPE isolates
are resistant to all or nearly all �-lactam agents, and these organ-
isms may also be resistant to other antimicrobial classes, limiting
the therapeutic options available for the treatment of CPE infec-
tions (3, 4).
CPE isolates may be susceptible only to tigecycline and/or
colistin, which have been widely used; however, there are limita-
tions to the usage of both agents (4). Low plasma peak concentra-
tions are achieved with tigecycline, and this antimicrobial agent is
not recommended for the treatment of bloodstream infections.
Furthermore, colistin use can be associated with nephrotoxicity
and occasionally neurotoxicity. CPE isolates can display colistin
or tigecycline resistance, a problem increasingly reported world-
wide (3).
The use of �-lactamase inhibitors combined with a potent
�-lactam agent has been a successful strategy for overcoming
�-lactamase-mediated resistances (5); however, older inhibitors
such as tazobactam, sulbactam, and clavulanate are generally not
effective against isolates producing various contemporary �-lac-
tamases, including KPC serine carbapenemases (5, 6). The in-
creasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms
producing KPC enzymes and other �-lactamases that are poorly
inhibited by current inhibitors suggests the need for new treat-
ment alternatives, including broader-spectrum �-lactamase in-
hibitors.
Vaborbactam (formerly RPX7009) is a cyclic boronic acid
pharmacophore �-lactamase inhibitor that displays potent inhi-
bition of KPC enzymes and other Ambler class A and C enzymes
(7). This inhibitor is in phase 3 clinical development in combina-
tion with meropenem. In this study, we evaluated the use of this
combination against 315 Enterobacteriaceae strains producing ser-
ine carbapenemases collected worldwide, including 308 KPC-pro-
ducing strains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial isolates. A total of 315 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates pro-
ducing serine carbapenemases were selected and tested. This selection
included isolates from multiple countries and years to provide genetic
diversity, and only one strain from a clonal outbreak was included. The
isolates were cultured during 2000 to 2013, mainly during 2013 (150 iso-
lates), 2010 (48 isolates), and 2007 (45 isolates), and included 12 Citro-

 bacter freundii isolates, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 39 Enterobacter
cloacae isolates, 1 Enterobacter gergoviae isolate, 21 Escherichia coli isolates,
14 Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, 208 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 1 Raoul-
tella ornithinolytica isolate, 2 Raoultella planticola isolates, and 13 Serratia
marcescens isolates.
The isolates carried genes encoding KPC enzymes (308 isolates in to-
tal; 145 for KPC-2, 117 for KPC-3, 1 for KPC-4, 1 for KPC-20, and 44 for
KPC-like), SME-2 and -3 (6 isolates), and NMC-A (1 isolate). Genes
encoding serine carbapenemases and other �-lactamases were previously
identified using various PCR and sequencing strategies or using a mi-
croarray-based assay (8, 9). Not all isolates were screened for additional
�-lactamases, and 75 isolates that were screened are listed in Table S1 in
the supplemental material.
Checkerboard susceptibility testing. MICs were determined using
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilu-
tion methodology described in the M07-A10 guideline (10). Meropenem
(concentration range, 0.06 to 64 �g/ml) and the �-lactamase inhibitor
vaborbactam (concentration range, 0.5 to 32 �g/ml) were tested in a
checkerboard configuration (11) using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton
broth. The quality control (QC) ranges were those published in CLSI
M100-S26 (12); the tested QC strains included E. coli ATCC 25922, Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
BAA-1705. All QC results were within published ranges (12). The cate-
gorical interpretations for all antimicrobials were those found in M100-
S26 (12) and on the EUCAST website (http://www.eucast.org/clinical
_breakpoints/).
Expression analysis of efflux pumps and OMPs. The expression of
acrA (AcrAB-TolC), ompK35, ompK36, and ompK37 was determined by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using DNA-free RNA prepara-
tions for three K. pneumoniae isolates displaying MICs of 16 �g/ml for
meropenem-vaborbactam with a fixed concentration of 8 �g/ml of the
inhibitor. Total RNA was extracted from mid-log-phase bacterial cultures
(cell density at an optical density at 600 nm [OD600], 0.3 to 0.5) using
RNAprotect reagent and the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
in the QIAcube workstation (Qiagen), and residual DNA was eliminated
with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Quantification
of mRNA and sample quality were assessed using the RNA 6000 Pico kit
on the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Only preparations
with an RNA integrity number (RIN) of �7 that showed no visual degra-
dation were used for experiments. Relative quantification of target genes
was performed in triplicate by normalization to an endogenous reference
gene (gyrA) on the StepOne Plus instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), using custom-designed primers showing �93.0% efficiency.
Transcription levels were compared to those of K. pneumoniae ATCC
13383 (13). Transcription levels were considered significantly different if
a �10-fold difference (higher for acrA and lower for the outer membrane
proteins [OMPs]) compared with the level for the control isolates was
noted.
Molecular typing. Seven K. pneumoniae isolates displaying MICs of
�16 �g/ml for meropenem-vaborbactam were epidemiologically typed
by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Genomic DNA prepared in
agarose blocks, digested with SpeI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA,
USA), was resolved in the CHEF-DR II apparatus (Bio-Rad, Richmond,
CA, USA). Results were analyzed by GelCompar II software (Applied
Math, Kortrijk, Belgium). Percent similarities were identified on a den-
drogram derived from the unweighted pair group method using arithme-
tic averages and based on Dice coefficients. Band position tolerance and
optimization were set at 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively.
RESULTS
Effect of different concentrations of vaborbactam on mero-
penem MIC results. Meropenem alone (MIC50 and MIC90, 16
and �64 �g/ml, respectively) (Table 1) had very limited activity
against isolates carrying genes encoding serine carbapenemases.

 This carbapenem inhibited only 2.2% of the CPE strains at the
current CLSI susceptibility breakpoint (�1 �g/ml) and 7.3%
of the isolates at the EUCAST susceptibility breakpoint (�2
�g/ml) (Table 1). By the CLSI (MIC, �4 �g/ml) and EUCAST
(MIC, �8 �g/ml) resistance interpretative category criteria,
92.7 and 79.0% of the isolates, respectively, were resistant to
meropenem (Table 1).
When meropenem was tested in combination with vaborbac-
tam at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 32 �g/ml, the mero-
penem MIC50 and MIC90 values ranged from 0.5 to �0.06 �g/ml
and from 64 to 0.25 �g/ml, respectively (Table 1). Totals of 67.6 to
97.1% of the isolates were inhibited at �1 �g/ml of meropenem
(the CLSI susceptibility breakpoint for meropenem tested alone,
used for comparison purposes) in the presence of 0.5 to 32 �g/ml
of vaborbactam (Table 1), and 72.7 to 98.1% of the isolates were
inhibited at �2 �g/ml. Additionally, 78.1 to 98.4% of the isolates
were inhibited at �8 �g/ml of meropenem combined with 0.5 to
32 �g/ml of vaborbactam (Table 1).
Higher concentrations of vaborbactam resulted in the inhibi-
tion of a greater number of tested strains; meropenem combined
with vaborbactam concentrations of 4, 8, 16 and 32 �g/ml inhib-
ited 90.2, 96.5, 98.1, and 98.1% of the isolates, respectively, at �2
�g/ml of meropenem (Table 1). The activity of meropenem was at
least 64-fold greater when this carbapenem was combined with a
fixed vaborbactam concentration of 8 �g/ml (MIC50 and MIC90,
�0.06 and 1 �g/ml, respectively), and this concentration of inhib-
itor was considered optimal for further testing. Vaborbactam
alone displayed no activity against these isolates, and all MIC re-
sults were �64 �g/ml (Table 1).
Activityofmeropenem-vaborbactamwithafixedconcentra-
tion of 8 �g/ml of the �-lactamase inhibitor. Against KPC-pro-
ducing K. pneumoniae (n � 208) (Table 2), 93.3% of the isolates
were inhibited at �1 �g/ml and 96.6% were inhibited at �4 and
�8 �g/ml of meropenem-vaborbactam with a fixed concentra-
tion of 8 �g/ml of the inhibitor. Similar to the result for the overall
collection of CPE (315 isolates), meropenem-vaborbactam
(MIC50 and MIC90, �0.06 and 1 �g/ml, respectively) was at least
64-fold more active than meropenem alone (MIC50 and MIC90, 16
and �64 �g/ml, respectively) against KPC-producing K. pneu-
moniae (Table 2).
All E. cloacae isolates (n � 39), including KPC-2, KPC-3,
NMC-A, and KPC-4 producers, were inhibited at �4 �g/ml by
meropenem-vaborbactam with a fixed concentration of 8 �g/ml
of the inhibitor, and 92.3 and 97.4% of these isolates would be
categorized as susceptible by the CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints,
respectively, for meropenem tested alone (Table 2).
Twelve of 14 KPC-producing K. oxytoca isolates were inhibited
by �0.06 �g/ml of meropenem-vaborbactam with a fixed concen-
tration of 8 �g/ml of the inhibitor, and all these isolates were
inhibited by �2 �g/ml of this carbapenem-inhibitor combination
(Table 2). KPC-producing E. coli (n � 21) and C. freundii (n�12)
isolateswereinhibitedby�0.06or0.25�g/mlofmeropenem-vabor-
bactam with a fixed concentration of 8 �g/ml of the inhibitor (Table
2). Additionally, SME- and KPC-producing S. marcescens isolates
were inhibited by �1 �g/ml of meropenem-vaborbactam with a
fixed concentration of 8 �g/ml of the inhibitor (data not shown).
Among 75 isolates carrying the genes encoding KPC and at
least one additional known broad-spectrum �-lactamase, such as
an extended-spectrum �-lactamase (ESBL), a transferable cepha-
losporinase, or a derepressed intrinsic enzyme (e.g., OXY or
AmpC) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), meropenem
(MIC50 and MIC90, 32 and �64 �g/ml, respectively) inhibited 0.0
and 1.3% of these isolates at the CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints,
respectively. Meropenem combined with vaborbactam at a fixed
concentration of 8 �g/ml (MIC50 and MIC90, �0.06 and 1 �g/ml,
respectively) inhibited 96.0 and 98.7% of the isolates at the CLSI
and EUCAST breakpoints, respectively, including 68 K. pneu-
moniae isolates and 7 additional isolates representing four other
bacterial species (Table 2).
Evaluation of intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to �-lac-
tams. All seven isolates displaying meropenem-vaborbactam
(fixed vaborbactam concentration, 8 �g/ml) MICs of �16 �g/ml
were K. pneumoniae. Four of these isolates coproduced a metallo-
�-lactamase along with KPC enzymes. Three genetically identical
isolates were recovered in Italy; these isolates carried blaKPC-3 and
blaVIM-1 and displayed meropenem-vaborbactam MICs of 16
�g/ml when tested using 8 �g/ml of vaborbactam. One strain
producing KPC-2 and VIM-4, cultured from a clinical specimen
in a U.S. hospital, had a meropenem-vaborbactam (fixed vabor-
bactam concentration, 8 �g/ml) MIC of �64 �g/ml. The remain-
ing three isolates were collected from hospitals in the United States
and Israel and exhibited MICs for meropenem-vaborbactam of 16
�g/ml. These three KPC-producing isolates were evaluated for
expression of intrinsic genes encoding OMP and an efflux pump
and showed reduced expression of ompK37 and modest-to-high
expression rates of the AcrAB-TolC resistance nodulation efflux
system. In one isolate, the expression of acrA was 22.93-fold
higher than in the control strain, and in the other two isolates,
modest increases in acrA expression were observed (7.80- and
6.62-fold compared to the level for the control) (see Table S2 in
the supplemental material).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies testing vaborbactam demonstrated favorable
precovalent and covalent binding with �-lactamases of Ambler
classes A and C, and specifically high inhibitory potency was ex-
hibited with KPC enzymes. This inhibitor has pharmacokinetics
similar to those of �-lactam agents and has displayed high efficacy
in animal model studies using KPC-producing isolates (7).
When tested in combination with various carbapenems,
vaborbactam reduced the MICs of those agents against KPC-pro-
ducing E. coli, E. cloacae, and Klebsiella spp. �64-, �32-, �16-,
and �32-fold for biapenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and imi-
penem, respectively (7). Additionally, this serine �-lactamase in-
hibitor potentiates the activity of cefepime against isolates pro-
ducing commonly detected Ambler class A and D enzymes with
extended-spectrum activity for cephalosporins, such as CTX-M,
SHV, TEM, OXA-2, OXA-1/-30, and class C chromosomally en-
coded or transferable cephalosporinases (7).
Vaborbactam tested in combination with biapenem against
300 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including strains harboring the
prevalent carbapenemase groups and isolates with a combination
of ESBL or derepressed AmpC and intrinsic resistance mecha-
nisms, demonstrated that this inhibitor potentiated the activity of
biapenem for KPC-producing isolates; however, the activity of
this combination against isolates producing Ambler class B or D
enzymes was limited (14). In a recent study, for KPC-producing K.
pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. col-
lected in a hospital located in New York City, meropenem-vabor-
bactam increased the activity of carbapenems; however, decreased

 expression of ompK36 also reduced the effect of the �-lactamase
inhibitor 8- to 16-fold compared to the level for isolates producing
the same �-lactamases (15).
In this study, we showed that vaborbactam restored the activity
of meropenem against a diverse and representative large collec-
tion of isolates producing serine carbapenemases. Higher vabor-
bactam concentrations in the combination resulted in the inhibi-
tion of a greater number of isolates than meropenem alone (Table
1). Inhibitor concentrations of 4 �g/ml or greater consistently
restored the activity of meropenem, but more-limited improve-
ments in meropenem potency were observed when 16 or 32 �g/ml
of vaborbactam was used; thus, a concentration of 8 �g/ml was
considered optimal. These results are also supported by pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) model results (16),
and those concentrations are also compatible with exposures fol-
lowing a 2-g intravenous dose.
Further studies on KPC-producing isolates that did not copro-
duce metallo-�-lactamase enzymes but still had elevated mero-
penem-vaborbactam MICs (�16 �g/ml) demonstrated that these
isolates exhibited reduced expression of the gene encoding
OmpK37 combined with elevated expression of the tripartite ef-
flux system AcrAB-TolC.
In summary, meropenem-vaborbactam demonstrated potent
activity against Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing serine car-
bapenemases that are often MDR where therapeutic options to
treat infections caused by these pathogens are compromised. As
with other �-lactamase inhibitors currently marketed or in late-stage
clinical development, vaborbactam does not inhibit class B metallo-
�-lactamases, and isolates producing these enzymes displayed ele-
vated MICs for the meropenem-vaborbactam combination.
