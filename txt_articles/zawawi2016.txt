IMPORTANCE Noise-induced hearing loss is an increasingly worrisome problem. Although
caffeine intake is common in people involved in noise-related environments, the effect of
caffeine on the recovery of hearing after a temporary threshold shift requires further
understanding.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether caffeine impairs hearing recovery in a guinea pig model
exposed to acoustic overstimulation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS This experiment at the McGill University Auditory Sciences
Laboratory used 24 female albino guinea pigs (age, 6 months; weight, 500-600 g) divided
randomly into 3 groups of 8 animals each. Group 1 was exposed to caffeine; group 2, acoustic
overstimulation events (AOSEs); and group 3, both. Data were collected from July 1, 2013, to
March 30, 2014, and analyzed from April 1 to August 1, 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Daily caffeine dose for groups 1 and 3 consisted of 25 mg/kg administered
intraperitoneally for 15 days. The AOSEs were administered on days 1 and 8 and consisted of
1 hour of 110-dB pure-tone sound.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests to
determine the audiological threshold shift and recovery were obtained at baseline and on
days 1 (1 hour after the first AOSE), 4, 8 (before and 1 hour after the second AOSE), 11, and 15.
Scanning electron and light microscopy of the cochleas were performed to determine
morphologic changes.
RESULTS The day 1 post-AOSE measurement resulted in a similar threshold shift in all animals
in groups 2 and 3 at all frequencies tested (8, 16, 20, and 25 kHz). The maximum threshold
shift was at 16 kHz, with a mean of 66.12 dB. By day 8, the threshold shift in group 2
recovered completely at all frequencies except 20 kHz, where a mean threshold shift of
20.63 dB of sound pressure level (SPL) was present. Hearing impairment in group 3 persisted
in 8-, 16-, and 25-kHz frequencies with thresholds of 21.88, 28.13, and 26.25 dB SPL,
respectively (P = .001). After a second AOSE at day 8, similar threshold shift and outcome
were recorded on day 15 compared with day 8, with a mean threshold shift at 20 kHz of
29.38 dB SPL in group 2 and mean threshold shifts at 8, 16, 20, and 25 kHz of 29.38, 35.63,
40.63, and 38.75 dB SPL, respectively, in group 3. The difference in ABR threshold recovery
was in concordance with scanning electronic and light microscopy findings for each group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A daily dose of caffeine was found to impair the recovery of
hearing after an AOSE.

oise-inducedhearinglossisacommonproblemamong
young adults and adolescents. Exposure to loud noise
is present in various settings, which can be recre-
ational or work related.1 The mechanisms of this type of hear-
ing loss are auditory hair cell trauma, promotion of a hypoxic
environment with strial atrophy, and spiral ganglion neuro-
nal degeneration.2,3
The most ingested psychoactive substance is caffeine,4
which is found in common beverages such as soda, energy
drinks, coffee, and tea. Caffeine has been found to increase the
release of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.5 Caf-
feine also has behavioral effects by increasing arousal and
decreasing fatigue. Nevertheless, caffeine has a long list of
adverse effects, including insomnia, tremors, seizures, and
anxiety.6
Teenagers and adolescents consume caffeine in alarming
amounts. Pollak and Bright7 reported a caffeine intake of as
much as 800 mg/d in eighth and ninth grade students. When
these levels of intake are compared with those of adults, a re-
cent review of the association between caffeine and urinary
incontinence noted that some patients consume more than
2.4 L of caffeine-containing drinks per day.8
Owing to the increased consumption of caffeine, interest
in the association of caffeine with hearing loss has been
growing. These studies are clinically relevant and based on
the environments and activities where regular caffeine con-
sumption occurs in noisy leisure (eg, concerts and loud
music clubs) or occupational (eg, machine works and avia-
tion industry) settings.
A recent pilot study9 has demonstrated that caffeine-
treated animals experience a delay in hearing recovery after
exposure to loud noise. Caffeine may induce such a phenom-
enon through many possible mechanisms, but none of them
is well understood. The objective of this study was to deter-
mine the effect of daily caffeine intake on hearing recovery af-
ter acoustic overstimulation events (AOSEs) in a guinea pig
model. We hypothesized that daily intake of caffeine impairs
the recovery of hearing after an AOSE.
Methods
Animals
This study was performed from July 1, 2013, to March 30, 2014.
We used 24 female albino guinea pigs (age, 6 months; weight,
500-600 g). The animals were housed at 22°C (±4°C) with a
light-dark cycle of 12 hours. They had access to food and wa-
ter ad libitum. This study was approved by the ethics review
board of McGill University and the McGill University animal
care committee.
The guinea pigs were divided randomly into 3 groups.
Group 1 (n = 8) received a daily intraperitoneal injection of caf-
feine, 25 mg/kg, for 15 days (control condition). Group 2 (n = 8)
received 2 AOSEs on days 1 and 8. Group 3 (n = 8) received a
daily intraperitoneal injection of caffeine, 25 mg/kg, for 15 days
and 2 AOSEs on days 1 and 8. The randomization process was
performed by one of us (M.M.-M.) who was not involved in the
auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing.
Caffeine Administration
The choice of caffeine dose was based on the literature review8
and previous research conducted in our laboratory.10 In the lit-
erature, a dose of greater than 25 mg/kg/d was considered an
excessive dose of caffeine that resulted in significant physi-
ologicchanges,includingurinaryincontinence.Theweightand
behavior of the animals were recorded every day throughout
the experiment. Each dose was calculated based on the daily
weight (25 mg/kg/d) of the animal and administered each day
of the study from 9 to 10 AM.
Acoustic Overstimulation Events
The study adopted the method for AOSEs used in previously
published studies.9,11,12 In a soundproof room, the guinea
pigs were anesthetized using ketamine (50 mg/kg) and
xylazine (1 mg/kg). Each AOSE consisted of a continuous
6-kHz pure-tone noise produced by a generator (Intelligent
Hearing Systems) and amplified (D-75A amplifier; Crown
Audio Inc). The tone was then projected using 2 loudspeak-
ers at a distance of 5 cm from the animal’
s head in a free field
in the soundproof room. A calibrated sound level meter
(Bruel & Kjaer) was used to monitor the sound pressure level
(SPL). The sound was amplified to 110 dB SPL and sustained
for 1 hour.9,11,12 Each animal in groups 2 and 3 (AOSEs and
AOSEs + caffeine) were exposed to AOSEs on days 1 and 8 of
the experiment.
Auditory Brainstem Response
Under general anesthesia using 5% inhaled isoflurane for
induction and 2% inhaled isoflurane for maintenance, ABR
was performed. Animals with abnormal anatomy of the ear
were excluded. Before measurement, the ABR machine was
calibrated to the industrial standard provided by the com-
pany in a similar manner to the pilot study.9 The ABRs were
measured at the following intervals: baseline (before the
start of the experiment) and on days 1 (1 hour after the first
AOSE), 4, 8 (before and 1 hour after the second AOSE), 11,
and 15.
The testing was performed only on the right ear of all ani-
mals using an evoked potentials system (SmartEP; Intelligent
Hearing System). Electrodes were placed subdermally on the
vertex(reference),thecontralateralear(ground),andthetested
right ear (active). Frequencies tested included 8-, 16-, 20-, and
25-kHz tone-burst stimuli.9
Key Points
Question: What is the effect of caffeine on hearing recovery after
an acoustic overstimulation event (AOSE)?
Findings: In this guinea pig model, animals receiving daily
intraperitoneal caffeine doses had impaired recovery of hearing in
3 different frequencies after exposure to pure-tone AOSEs. These
findings were statistically significant compared with those of
animals that did not receive caffeine.
Meaning: Caffeine exposure was found to impair the recovery of
hearing after an AOSE.

The stimuli presented to the right ear were initially pre-
sented at 100 dB SPL and then decreased to 5 dB SPL. The re-
sponses were filtered and amplified, and the mean of 1600
sweeps was calculated. The hearing threshold was consid-
ered the lowest intensity at which waves III and V were ob-
tained. A threshold shift was calculated based on the differ-
ence between the threshold at the specific time point and the
baseline at that specific frequency.
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Light Microscopy
On day 15 of the experiment after the final ABR test, all ani-
mals were killed humanely. Four randomly selected animals
from each group had their right cochleas removed, fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours, and soaked in a 0.1M
phosphate-buffered saline solution for 24 hours at 4°C. After
fixation, the cochleas were treated with osmium tetroxide for
90 minutes and dehydrated in 70% ethanol. Subsequently,
the cochlea was drilled and the organ of Corti was dissected.
The sample then was dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and scan-
ning electron microscopy was performed. To quantify the
effect on the outer hair cells (OHC), we adopted a modified
version of the 4-grade scale of Saito et al,13 where N indicates
normal; 1, 10% to 50% OHC loss or damage; 2, OHC count of
less than 50%; and 3, cuticular plate rupture and missing hair
cells. Results were obtained for the apical, middle, and basal
turns.
The other 4 animals in the each group had their right co-
chleas extracted immediately after they were killed hu-
manely. Fixation was performed with 10% formalin for 48
hours. After 3 weeks of decalcification, the cochleas were de-
hydrated using 50% to 100% ethanol and cut into 5-μm sec-
tions. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed, and the sec-
tions were mounted for light microscopy. The turns of the
cochleawerethencapturedat200 × magnificationusingadigi-
tal camera (AxioCam MR3; Carl Zeiss).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 1, 2014. Initially,
analysis of group 1 (caffeine only) was performed during the
time from baseline to day 14 to determine the effect of caf-
feine on hearing. After calculating the threshold shift for each
frequency at each time frame, the mean values of each group
were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to determine significance among all 3 groups. Next,
we used the Mann-Whitney test to determine differences be-
tween groups 2 and 3. The results were considered statisti-
cally significant at P ≤ .05. Analysis was performed using SPSS
software (version 23.0; SPSS, Inc).
Results
Threshold Shift
The baseline ABR threshold analysis showed no difference
among any of the 3 groups (P > .05). Daily intraperitoneal in-
jection of caffeine was not found to cause the ABR threshold
shift during the 15 days of injections. On day 1, 1 hour after an
AOSE, we noted a threshold shift in groups 2 and 3. This shift
was not different between the groups (P > .05, Kruskal-Wallis
analysis of variance). The maximum shift was observed on the
16-kHz frequency (66.12 dB SPL).
Group 2 (AOSEs only) ABRs showed complete recovery of
the threshold shift by day 8 at all frequencies except 20 kHz,
where a mean threshold shift of 20.63 dB SPL was present.
Similar results were obtained after the second AOSE. At day
15, the ABR of group 2 demonstrated hearing recovery at all
frequencies except 20 kHz, where a mean threshold shift of
29.38 dB SPL persisted.
In group 3 (AOSEs + caffeine), threshold shift recovery was
impaired at days 4 and 8 in all frequencies. The mean thresh-
old shifts on day 8 at 8, 16, 20, and 25 kHz were 21.88, 28.13,
36.25, and 26.25 dB SPL, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA
showed that these results were statistically significant com-
pared with the baseline values (P < .05). These results were
then reproduced at the second week of the testing. At day 15,
the mean threshold shifts at 8, 16, 20, and 25 kHz were 29.38,
35.63,40.63,and38.75dBSPL,respectively.Theseresultswere
statistically different from baseline levels (P < .05, Kruskal-
Wallis ANOVA). When we compared groups 2 and 3 during the
hearing recovery period, threshold shift differences were sta-
tistically significant at 8, 16, and 25 kHz (P < .05 for all, Mann-
Whitney test) (Figure 1).
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Light Microscopy
Based on the 4-grade scale previously mentioned, group 1
was graded N in all sections of all animals tested. Differ-
ences in these results were statistically significant when
compared with those of group 2 or 3. When we compared
groups 2 and 3 using the Mann-Whitney test, no statistical
difference between them was found except at the apex,
where group 3 was noted to have a more apparent loss of
OHC (P = .03, Mann-Whitney test). This finding was based
on a significant loss of OHC count and disarrangement of
the stereocilia. At the apex, group 3 animals had grade 2
(n = 3) and grade 4 (n = 1) damage, whereas in group 2, all 4
animals did not exceed grade 1.
Light microscopy analysis of the cochlea revealed that
the animals exposed to caffeine only (group 1) had pre-
served hair cell morphology at the organ of Corti, and the
stria vascularis appeared to be intact. In the group exposed
to AOSEs only (group 2), minimal changes were seen in the
morphology and arrangement of the Corti tunnel, whereas
the stria vascularis was preserved. In the group exposed to
caffeine and AOSEs (group 3), abnormal morphology and
arrangement of the Corti tunnel and the stria vascularis
were present, with dilation of vessels and evidence of
microscopic bleeding that might explain our results
(Figure 2).
Animal Body Weight and Behavior
All 3 groups showed similar growth and behavior with and
without daily caffeine doses of 25 mg/kg. The animals did not
experience any seizures or gastroenteritis. No significant
change in alertness or response to stimuli was noted. Kruskal-
Wallis ANOVA did not show any difference in weight gain
among the 3 groups (P > .05).

Discussion
In recent years, interest has increased in studying the effects
of caffeine on normal physiologic function and known medi-
cal conditions. This report addresses the effect of caffeine on
ABR threshold shift in a guinea pig model exposed to AOSEs.
The study initially addressed the effect of caffeine alone
on hearing. Group 1, which was exposed to caffeine for 15 days,
did not show any changes on ABR threshold or on scanning

electronic or light microscopy analysis. This finding is in ac-
cordancewithapreviouslypublishedstudyoncaffeinebyDixit
et al,14 who reported that caffeine improves the auditory path-
way transmission by reducing the latency and raising the am-
plitudes on ABR waves.
In the pilot study,9 chronic exposure to caffeine after noise
showed a change toward the delayed recovery of hearing. In
that study, recovery of hearing was delayed only on 1 fre-
quency (8 kHz) that was evident on day 14 after the noise ex-
posure. The difference between the pilot study and the pre-
sent one is that, in the pilot study, the animals were exposed
topure-toneacoustictraumathatwashigherinamplitudethan
in the present study (120 dB compared with 110 dB). This ex-
posure may have resulted in a permanent threshold shift in
multiple frequencies, which could be one of the reasons why
the difference between the groups was not more evident. Our
study has demonstrated that in 3 of 4 frequencies, complete
recovery of ABR threshold was noted by day 8 after the AOSE
in animals not receiving caffeine.
Furthermore, the present study also used a more reason-
able and clinically oriented dose of caffeine (ie, 25 mg/kg/d).
In a study comparing the effect of caffeine on autoimmune
encephalomyelitis in guinea pigs,10 a caffeine dose of 30
mg/kg/d was found to exert neuroprotection against the
disease. In addition, in a human study,8 urinary inconti-
nence was associated with higher doses of daily caffeine
intake. In fact, the groups with extremely high caffeine
intake ingested doses as high as 2.4 L per day (approximately
25-30 mg/kg/d).
The results of our study demonstrate that a daily dose of
caffeine had a negative effect on hearing recovery after
AOSEs at multiple frequencies. When we compared groups 2
and 3, the latter had impaired ABR threshold shifts at fre-
quencies of 8, 16, and 25 kHz that were found to be statisti-
cally significant (P < .05 for all, Mann-Whitney test). At 20
kHz, no difference was found between both groups, likely
owing to a permanent impairment at that frequency because
both groups did not recover well. These results are in con-
cordance with those of the previously published pilot study9
that showed increasing hearing impairment at 14 days after
pure-tone exposure.
Another important note from this study is that the ani-
mals in groups 2 and 3 recovered in a similar manner after
the first and second AOSEs. Specifically in group 2, a com-
plete ABR threshold recovery was found in 3 of 4 frequen-
cies. The importance of this finding is that it can be consid-
ered as the basis of animal models of other projects that
address AOSEs in guinea pigs. These results are also in agree-
ment with those of Fetoni et al,11 who noted hearing recov-
ery from 7 to 21 days after a pure-tone–induced hearing
threshold shift.
The scanning electron microscopy results showed in-
creased OHC damage at the apex in the group that received caf-
feine and AOSEs (group 3) compared with the group that re-
ceived AOSEs only (group 2). In addition, the Corti tunnel
and stria vascularis changes on light microscopy observed
in group 3 were more aggressive than the changes noted in
group 2. These results are in keeping with the persistent ABR
threshold shift that was noted in group 3. In the pilot study by
Mujica-Mota et al,9 the scanning electronic microscopy re-
sults showed more damage to the inner hair cell. The differ-
ence in results between this study and the pilot study could
be explained by differences in the caffeine dose and in the
sound amplitude of AOSEs.
Many mechanisms describing how caffeine affects the
auditory system in the recovery period after an AOSE
have been hypothesized. The organ of Corti, lateral wall,
spiral ganglion cells, and cochlear blood vessels contain
high-affinity adenosine receptors.15 During an AOSE,
the cochlea becomes hypoperfused and may become
ischemic.16 Adenosine receptors help to promote vascular
blood flow to aid the reperfusion of the cochlea.17,18 Caffeine
has a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist property,
which may hinder the activities of adenosine receptors,
causing further ischemia and resulting in an impaired recov-
ery of hearing.19
Another mechanism in which caffeine may have a nega-
tive effect on hearing recovery is by increasing the release of
corticosterone in response to AOSEs.20 This mechanism has
been demonstrated in a human study when caffeine intake
prevented the morning decline of cortisol concentration.21
The third mechanism is owing to the change in intracel-
lular calcium levels.22 After an acoustic trauma, a significant
rise in the intracellular calcium levels occurs22 that leads to
apoptosis of hair cells.23 Caffeine functions by releasing
additional calcium that can cause shortening of the
OHCs.24,25
Ourstudyillustratesthattheadditiveeffectofcaffeinewith
an AOSE exposure resulted in an impaired recovery of hear-
ing at multiple frequencies. These results are of clinical im-
portance. Based on the results of our study, patients who con-
tinue to injest regular caffeine while being exposed to noise
or after an AOSE may in fact be reducing their chances of full
recovery of their hearing.

Limitations to this study include the AOSE used, which
was a pure-tone sound that in real life does not represent
the more common noisy environments. Another limitation
was the use of a high dose of caffeine. Future studies should
investigate reducing the dose of caffeine so as to identify
the specific dose at which caffeine starts to affect the recov-
ery of hearing after an AOSE. Furthermore, owing to the
short follow-up (15 days), the study cannot determine the
long-term effect of caffeine. Our findings could lead to fur-
ther research to better understand the mechanism involving
the effect of caffeine on hearing after AOSEs with the goal of
lowering the general incidence of noise-induced hearing
loss.
Conclusions
Caffeine taken in a daily dose impaired recovery of the ABR
threshold shift at multiple frequencies after AOSEs in a guinea
pig model. Further studies are required to determine the ef-
fects on humans and possible prophylactic strategies for noise-
induced hearing loss.
