IMPORTANCE Randomized clinical trials have shown the superiority of endovascular therapy
(EVT) compared with best medical management for acute ischemic strokes with large vessel
occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation. However, of 1287 patients enrolled in 5 trials,
94 with isolated second (M2) segment occlusions were randomized and 51 of these received
EVT, thereby limiting evidence for treating isolated M2 segment occlusions as reflected in
American Heart Association guidelines.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate EVT safety and effectiveness in M2 occlusions in a cohort of patients
with acute ischemic stroke.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter retrospective cohort study pooled
patients with acute ischemic strokes and LVO isolated to M2 segments from 10 US centers.
Patients with acute ischemic strokes and LVO in M2 segments presenting within 8 hours from
their last known normal clinical status (LKN) from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2015, were
divided based on their treatment into EVT and medical management groups. Logistic
regression was used to compare the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated
associations with good outcome in the EVT group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin
Scale score (range, 0-6; scores of 0-2 indicate a good outcome); the secondary outcome was
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.
RESULTS A total of 522 patients (256 men [49%]; 266 women [51%]; mean [SD] age,
68 [14.3] years) were identified, of whom 288 received EVT and 234 received best medical
management. Patients in the medical management group were older (median [interquartile
range] age, 73 [60-81] vs 68 [56-78] years) and had higher rates of intravenous tissue
plasminogen activator treatment (174 [74.4%] vs 172 [59.7%]); otherwise the 2 groups were
balanced. The rate of good outcomes was higher for EVT (181 [62.8%]) than for medical
management (83 [35.4%]). The EVT group had 3 times the odds of a good outcome as the
medical management group (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI, 2.1-4.4; P < .001) even after
adjustment for age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Alberta Stroke
Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS), intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator treatment, and time from LKN to arrival in the emergency department (OR, 3.2;
95% CI, 2-5.2; P < .001). No statistical difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage
was found (5.6% vs 2.1% for the EVT group vs the medical management group; P = .10). The
treatment effect did not change after adjusting for center (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.9-5.8; P < .001).
Age, NIHSS score, ASPECTS, time from LKN to reperfusion, and successful reperfusion score
of at least 2b (range, 0 [no perfusion] to 3 [full perfusion with filling of all distal branches])
were independently associated with good outcome of EVT. A linear association was found
between good outcome and time from LKN to reperfusion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although a randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm
these findings, available data suggest that EVT is reasonable, safe, and effective for LVO of
the M2 segment relative to best medical management.

iverecentlypublishedrandomizedclinicaltrials(RCTs)1-5
demonstrated the superiority of endovascular therapy
(EVT) compared with best medical management, in-
cluding intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA)
therapy for acute ischemic strokes with large vessel occlu-
sion (LVO) in the anterior circulation. However, the RCTs’in-
clusion criteria focused on proximal occlusions involving the
distal internal carotid artery and proximal (first segment [M1])
middle cerebral artery (MCA). Patients with more distal occlu-
sions in the second-order branches (M2) of the MCA, how-
ever, were underrepresented in the trials. ESCAPE (Endovas-
cular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation
Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT [Com-
puted Tomography] to Recanalization Times),2 SWIFT PRIME
(Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary
Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke),4 and
REVASCAT (Randomized Trial of Revascularization With
Solitaire FR Device vs Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment
of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Oc-
clusion Presenting Within 8 Hours of Symptom Onset)5 re-
stricted enrollment to patients with more proximal occlu-
sions, although a few patients were misclassified as having
M1 segment occlusion by the enrolling center and were sub-
sequently adjudicated by the core laboratory as having M2
segment occlusion. MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized
Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic
Stroke in the Netherlands)1 and EXTEND-IA (Extending
the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological
Deficits–Intra-arterial)3 enrolled only a few patients with dis-
tal occlusions. Of 1287 patients enrolled in the 5 trials, only a
total of 94 patients were randomized; 51 of these patients re-
ceived EVT. Evidence from RCTs regarding the benefit of EVT
is therefore lacking for M2 segment occlusions, as reflected in
the recent American Heart Association guidelines.6
Competing issues highlight the uncertainty of how to
best treat more distal occlusions, which represent an impor-
tant subgroup of patients with LVO. Concerns have been
raised about the procedural safety of intervention in smaller-
caliber vessels, especially that data support the concept of
more distal occlusions responding better to intravenous
thrombolysis.7 However, medical management, including
administration of intravenous thrombolytics, results in lower
reperfusion rates than EVT for such large-artery occlusions,
potentially leading to large infarct volumes with severe neu-
rologic deficits. More data are needed to address whether the
risk of not intervening for an M2 segment occlusion out-
weighs the risks of treating an M2 segment occlusion with
EVT. We sought to evaluate the safety and treatment effect of
EVT compared with best medical management in patients
with acute ischemic stroke and LVO in the anterior circula-
tion isolated to the M2 segments.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Participants
A multicenter retrospective cohort was pooled from 10 par-
ticipating academic US stroke centers (listed in eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Patients with acute ischemic stroke and LVO iso-
lated to M2 segments who presented within 8 hours from the
last known normal clinical status (LKN) from January 1, 2012,
to April 30, 2015, were included. The start of the M2 segment
of the MCA was defined as the vertical segment lying within
the mesial margin of the sylvian fissure as identified on the
coronalCTangiogram,anterior-posteriorprojectionofthemag-
netic resonance angiogram, or anterior-posterior conven-
tional angiogram as read and adjudicated locally by the par-
ticipating center (eFigure in the Supplement). The study was
approved by the institutional review boards of the 10 partici-
pating centers (University of Texas, Houston; Riverside Meth-
odist Hospital, Columbus, Ohio; Texas Stroke Institute, Dal-
las; Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles, California; Cleveland
Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio; University of Tennessee, Memphis;
Saint Louis University, St Louis, Missouri; Tulane University,
New Orleans, Louisiana; Kansas University, Kansas City; and
WellStar Kennestone, Marietta, Georgia), which determined
that informed consent was not required for this retrospective
study.
Study Treatment and Intervention
Patients were divided based on their treatment into EVT and
best medical management groups. Best medical manage-
ment included IV tPA therapy in patients presenting within the
first 4.5 hours from the LKN when appropriate. Endovascular
treatment included mechanical thrombectomy by means of
stent retrievers or aspiration techniques; intra-arterial throm-
bolytics were given in some cases.
Demographics, Variables, and Measurements
Information on baseline demographics, vascular risk factors,
admission blood glucose level, and National Institute of Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (range, 0-42, with higher scores in-
dicating severe stroke) were obtained from the prospectively
collected stroke registries of the different centers. Other clini-
cal end points obtained included symptomatic intracerebral
hemorrhage (defined as a parenchymal hematoma grade 2 as-
sociated with worsening neurologic status thought to be re-
lated to the hematoma), neurologic deterioration (defined as
a ≥4-point increase in the NIHSS score), and functional out-
come at 90 days as measured by modified Rankin Scale (range,
0-6, with lower scores indicating better outcomes).8 Type of
Key Points
Question Is endovascular therapy (EVT) superior to best medical
management of occlusions of the second (M2) segment of the
middle cerebral artery?
Findings In this retrospective pooled analysis of 522 patients,
higher proportions of patients treated with EVT achieved good
clinical outcomes measured as independence at 90 days (62.8%)
than did those treated with best medical management (35.4%),
a statistically significant difference.
Meaning Endovascular therapy is effective and may be superior
to best medical management in occlusions of the M2 segment of
the middle cerebral artery.

cance (P = .10), as depicted in Table 3. Also, no difference in

thermore, rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and

Discussion
Endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke due to LVO
in the anterior circulation has been shown in 5 RCTs1-5 to
improve patients’clinical outcomes and reduce mortality
rates relative to best medical management, including throm-
bolysis with IV tPA. These studies enrolled a much higher
proportion of patients with proximal occlusions involving
only distal internal carotid artery and proximal MCA (M1 seg-
ment) compared with distal MCA (M2 segment) occlusions,
which leaves the question of best management for patients
with M2 segment occlusions open because the relative effect
size for treatment and safety of these more distal occlusions
with EVT is not as well understood. The benefit of EVT
remains uncertain even after the individual patient data–
pooled meta-analysis from the 5 RCTs,10 with the adjusted
ORs showing no significance (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.51-3.21).
These results could be attributed to the underpowered small
sample size of patients pooled from the trials because of
the trials’aforementioned inclusion criteria, which further
highlights the need for more data on this important sub-
population.
Rates of good outcomes for EVT in our data set are
higher compared with those of patients with M2 segment
occlusions from the recent trials (62.8% vs 49%). This dif-
ference could be caused by the latter representing more
proximal M2 segment occlusions than in our cohort because
those were misclassified as M1 segment occlusions at the
enrolling site.
Treating physicians face uncertainty about the effective-
ness of EVT in these patients and whether IV tPA treatment
alone would suffice. In addition, they face concerns about
complications of thrombectomy due to the smaller-caliber
vessel size and technical difficulties with access to more dis-
tal clots. We attempted to address this population by pooling
data from 10 academic centers that had treated patients with
EVT or medical management alone. Our results support the
benefit of EVT over medical management alone. Moreover,
although rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were
higher in the EVT group, this numerical difference was not
statistically significant, which supports the safety profile of
EVT for MCA M2 segment occlusions. Although our study
involved a different patient population, our results are con-
sistent with those of distal internal carotid artery and M1
occlusions in the recent trials.1-5
Consistent with prior published data, we also found that
younger age, lower stroke severity score, better imaging pro-
files with smaller baseline infarcts, and fast, successful rep-
erfusion were factors associated with a better EVT effect. Our
study shows a linear association between a good clinical
outcome and the time from the stroke ictus to reperfusion.
Other recent studies attempted to address the question of
EVT effectiveness in this subpopulation,11,12 but they lacked
a concurrent comparison group that received medical
management,11,12 included small samples of patients with M2
segment occlusions (54 and 50 patients), and in 1 case in-
volved a single-center experience.12
PatientsinourpooleddatahavehighmedianNIHSSscores,
which can be caused by multiple factors. These factors in-
clude possible clot migration from the M1 segment to the M2
segment secondary to IV tPA treatment or autologous clot ly-

sient M1 segment occlusion, leading to worse clinical symp-
toms despite recanalization. Also, the anatomical asymmetry
in the size of the M2 segments with the anterior or the poste-
rior trunk may supply most of the MCA territory. Moreover, the
inherent bias in the NIHSS toward eloquent areas supplied by
the anterior division of the MCA, particularly in the domi-
nant hemisphere where the motor strip and receptive lan-
guage areas are affected, can lead to significant deficits and
higher NIHSS scores. Stroke severity in our cohort is compa-
rable to severity reported in recent studies.12
Our study has limitations. Despite the inherent limita-
tions of the retrospective design, the 2 treatment groups
were mostly similar at baseline. Patients in the medical man-
agement group had a higher rate of tPA treatment and pre-
sented earlier than patients in the EVT group, which would
have biased the results, if any, toward a lower EVT effect. The
patients in our cohort were from 10 centers with different
EVT protocols; selection of patients for EVT and the devices
used for thrombectomy were different and based on institu-
tional protocols. These differences could have resulted in
selection bias because patients who were more likely to ben-
efit from EVT were the ones treated with the intervention.
Although ASPECTS were similar between groups, more
advanced image modalities, such as CT or magnetic reso-
nance perfusion images, might have guided treatment
choice. We could not report the proportions of those meth-
ods used, which places another limitation on our study.
Although we used a unified anatomical definition of the M2
segment owing to the lack of a central reading, the possibility
for misclassifications of the occluded segment of the MCA by
the different centers, similar to what occurred in the recent
RCTs, is a potential limitation. In addition, patients were not
randomized between medical management and EVT; thus,
we could not account for the unmeasured covariates in our
analysis. However, the data from this study are derived from
centers actively pursuing EVT and therefore reflect real-
world situations. Although the difference in symptomatic
hemorrhage rate was not statistically significant, it could
have been of clinical significance; overall, however, the study
findings support the safety of EVT in this patient population.
One strength of this study is the large multicenter bal-
anced sample that has a concurrent medical management
group. The study shows a direction of treatment effect con-
sistent with those from the recently published RCTs.1-5
Conclusions
Despite inherent limitations of our retrospective design, our
data suggest that EVT may be effective and safe for distal LVO
(MCAM2segment)relativetobestmedicalmanagement.Atrial
randomizing M2 segment occlusions to EVT vs medical man-
agement is warranted to determine the effectiveness of EVT,
particularly in patients with disabling strokes despite occlu-
sions in smaller-caliber vessels.
