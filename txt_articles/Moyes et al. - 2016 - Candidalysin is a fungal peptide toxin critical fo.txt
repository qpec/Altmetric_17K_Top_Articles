Abstract
Cytolytic proteins and peptide toxins are classical virulence factors of several bacterial pathogens 
which disrupt epithelial barrier function, damage cells and activate or modulate host immune 
responses. Until now human pathogenic fungi were not known to possess such toxins. Here we 
identify the first fungal cytolytic peptide toxin in the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. 
This secreted toxin directly damages epithelial membranes, triggers a danger response signaling 
pathway and activates epithelial immunity. Toxin-mediated membrane permeabilization is 
enhanced by a positively charged C-terminus and triggers an inward current concomitant with 
calcium influx. C. albicans strains lacking this toxin do not activate or damage epithelial cells and 
are avirulent in animal models of mucosal infection. We propose the name ‘Candidalysin’ for this 
cytolytic peptide toxin; a newly identified, critical molecular determinant of epithelial damage and 
host recognition of the clinically important fungus, C. albicans.
 Introduction
The ability of mucosal surfaces to discriminate between commensal and pathogenic 
microbes is essential to human health. The fungus Candida albicans is normally a benign 
member of the human microbiota but is also responsible for millions of mucosal infections 
each year in immunocompromised hosts, often with severe morbidity1. A defining feature of 
C. albicans pathogenesis is the transition from yeast to invasive filamentous hyphae2. 
Hyphae damage mucosal epithelia and induce activation of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) 
transcription factor c-Fos (via p38-MAPK) and the MAPK phosphatase MKP1 (via 
ERK1/2-MAPK), which trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine responses3–7. These signaling 
events constitute a ‘danger response’ against invasive hyphae, thus serving as a sensor of 
pathogenic C. albicans invasion8–14. However, it is unclear how C. albicans hyphae induce 
epithelial inflammatory responses and cell damage during mucosal infections. Here we 
identify and characterize Candidalysin, the first cytolytic peptide toxin isolated from any 
human fungal pathogen, as the hyphal factor critical for epithelial immune activation and C. 
albicans mucosal infection.
 Ece1p is critical for epithelial activation and damage
Despite the well-known association between filamentation and virulence, the molecular 
mechanism underlying hypha-driven epithelial activation and mucosal damage has remained 
obscure. To elucidate this mechanism, we screened a panel of C. albicans gene deletion 
mutants that targeted key processes, pathways and proteins known or predicted to be 
associated with the yeast-hyphal transition and pathogenicity (62 strains). Only hypha-
producing strains induced MKP1 phosphorylation (p-MKP1), c-Fos, cytokines (IL-1α, IL-6, 
G-CSF) and damage in oral epithelial cells (Extended Data Table 1). However, one C. 
albicans mutant (ece1Δ/Δ)15 formed normal hyphae but was incapable of inducing these 
epithelial danger responses. C. albicans ECE1 (extent of cell elongation) is highly expressed

 by hyphae during epithelial infection (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b) and is predicted to encode a 
secreted protein16. To probe its function we generated a panel of C. albicans ECE1mutants 
(Extended Data Table 2). The ece1Δ/Δ strain formed normal hyphae on (Extended Data Fig. 
1c), and adhered to and invaded human epithelial cells similarly to wild type C. albicans 
(Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). Indeed, ece1Δ/Δ was capable of extensive epithelial invasion, 
penetrating through multiple epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Despite this, invasive 
ece1Δ/Δ hyphae did not damage epithelia or induce p-MKP1/c-Fos mediated danger 
responses or cytokine secretion (Fig. 1a–d). Thus, Ece1p is critical for epithelial damage and 
innate recognition of C. albicans hyphae in vitro.
 Ece1p is critical for mucosal pathogenesis
We next assessed the role of ECE1 in two in vivo models of C. albicans mucosal infection. 
In murine oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC)17, mice infected with C. albicans wild type or 
ECE1 re-integrant (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1) strains exhibited disease symptoms, including extensive 
hyphal invasion of the tongue epithelium, micro-abscesses of infiltrating neutrophils and 
tissue damage (Fig. 1e, f, h, i). In contrast, tongue tissue from ece1Δ/Δ-infected animals (n = 
17/20) showed no invasive fungi and no inflammatory infiltrates or damage (Fig. 1g). We 
detected very low numbers of ece1Δ/Δ cells in only 3/20 mice (Extended Data Fig. 2a), 
which showed no evidence of local epithelial damage (not shown). Quantification of 
histology sections indicated that the percentage of epithelial surface infected was 
significantly greater with the wild type and ECE1 re-integrant strains (Extended DataFig. 
2b). In a zebrafish swimbladder model of mucosal infection18,19, neutrophil recruitment and 
tissue damage were both significantly lower following ece1Δ/Δ infection as compared with 
the wild type strain (Fig. 1j, k, Extended DataFig. 2c, d). Therefore, C. albicans Ece1p is 
critical for mucosal pathogenesis and is an innate immune activator in vivo.
 Ece1p encodes a cytolytic peptide toxin
Ece1p is an in vitro substrate for Kex2p, a Golgi-located protease that cleaves proteins after 
lysine-arginine (KR) motifs20. Ece1p contains seven KR-processing sites, suggesting it has 
the potential to produce eight secreted peptides from C. albicans20 (Extended Data Fig. 3a, 
b). Liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis confirmed 
that recombinant Kex2p (rKex2p) processes recombinant Ece1p (rEce1p) and that all eight 
peptides generated terminated in KR (and fragments thereof, showing that less efficient 
processing occurs also after a single K or R) (Supplementary information). The importance 
of Kex2p–mediated Ece1p processing was demonstrated using a kex2Δ/Δ null strain21, 
which was unable to damage oral epithelia or induce p-MKP1/c-Fos mediated danger 
responses or cytokine secretion (Extended Data Table 1). To determine which Ece1p 
peptide(s) were responsible for epithelial activation and damage, oral epithelial cells were 
incubated with peptides Ece1-I-VIII (1.5 – 70 µM). Only Ece1-III62–93 induced p-MKP1, c-
Fos, cytokines and damage (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). Notably, low Ece1-III62–93 
concentrations (1.5 – 15 µM) were sufficient to induce c-Fos DNA binding (Fig. 2d), G-CSF 
and GM-CSF (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3c), while high Ece1-III62–93 concentrations (70 
µM) were required to induce damage (Fig. 2e) and the damage-associated cytokines IL-1α 
and IL-6, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). Ece1-III62–93 could also directly lyse 
multiple human epithelial cell types and induce hemolysis of red blood cells, a classical test

 for cytotoxin activity (not shown). Neither the N-terminal hydrophobic region (Ece1-
III62–85) nor the C-terminal hydrophilic region (Ece1-III86–93) induced p-MKP1, c-Fos, 
cytokines or damage of epithelial cells, either individually or in combination (Extended Data 
Fig. 3f–h), demonstrating that the peptide containing both regions is required for activity. 
Therefore, Ece1-III62–93 is the active region of Ece1p, acting as an epithelial immune 
activator and a cytolytic agent.
To confirm that Ece1-III62–93 drives epithelial activation and fungal pathogenicity, we 
generated a C. albicans strain lacking only the Ece1-III62–93 region (ece1Δ/Δ
+ECE1Δ184–279). LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the modified protein in this strain is 
stable, secreted and processed into each of the predicted peptide fragments, with the 
exception of the deleted peptide toxin (Supplementary information). Like ece1Δ/Δ, ece1Δ/Δ
+ECE1Δ184–279 efficiently formed invasive hyphae (not shown). However, ece1Δ/Δ
+ECE1Δ184–279 was unable to induce p-MKP1, c-Fos DNA binding, cytokines, or damage 
epithelia (Extended Fig. 3i–l). In murine OPC, unlike the ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1 complemented 
strain, ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279-infected mice demonstrated absent (n = 4/10) or low (n = 
6/10) fungal burdens, with no evidence of inflammatory infiltrates or local epithelial damage 
(Fig. 2f–h, Extended Data Fig. 4a and 4b) Likewise, ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279 did not induce 
full damage in the zebrafish swimbladder model (Fig. 2i, Extended Data Fig. 4c). In 
contrast, injection of lytic doses of Ece1-III62–93 into the swimbladder induced epithelial 
damage (Fig. 2j, k). Thus, Ece1-III62–93 is both necessary and sufficient for epithelial 
immune activation, damage and mucosal infection in vivo.
The amphipathic properties of Ece1-III62–93 
(SIIGIIMGILGNIPQVIQIIMSIVKAFKGNKR) coupled with the α-helical structure of the 
N-terminal hydrophobic region (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) indicated that this fungal peptide 
may act similarly to cationic antimicrobial peptides and peptide toxins such as melittin22 
(honey bee), magainin 223 (African clawed frog) and alamethicin24 (Trichoderma viride). 
Cytolytic peptide toxins have not previously been found in human pathogenic fungi but 
bacterial cytolytic toxins are known to induce lesions after binding to target cell 
membranes25,26. To investigate the importance of lipid composition for Ece1-III62–93-
mediated cytolysis, we used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electrical 
impedance spectroscopy to analyze the interactions of Ece1-III62–93 with model membranes 
comprised of lipid bilayers of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) with or without 
cholesterol. While Ece1-III62–93 was able to efficiently intercalate into DOPC membranes 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c), Ece1-III62–93 permeabilization was enhanced in the presence of 
cholesterol (Fig. 3a,). Ece1-III62–93-induced lesions were heterogeneous and transient 
(Extended Data Fig. 5d), indicating that the peptide may damage target membranes through 
a ‘carpet-like’ mechanism27. Patch-clamp analysis of epithelial cells demonstrated that 
lesion formation by Ece1-III62–93 is rapid and causes an inward current (Fig. 3b), associated 
with calcium influx (Fig. 3c). Similar phenomena occur with bacterial cytolytic toxins, 
which are known to trigger cell activation25,26,28.
We postulated that the positively-charged C-terminal KR residues of Ece1-III62–93 might be 
critical for interacting with negatively-charged components of host membranes to promote 
lesion formation. Substitution of the KR motif to AA (alanine-alanine; Ece1-III62–93AA) did

 not affect membrane intercalation (not shown) but significantly reduced the peptide’s ability 
to permeabilize membranes, damage epithelial cells and induce calcium influx (Fig. 3c–e). 
Thus, the positive C-terminus of Ece1-III62–93 is critical for lesion formation and damage 
induction in epithelial membranes. Notably, Ece1-III62–93AA still induced p-MKP1, c-Fos 
and the non-damage associated cytokine G-CSF (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f) but not the 
damage-associated cytokine IL-1α (Fig. 3f), suggesting that Ece1-III62–93AA can be 
recognized by epithelial immunity without damaging cells. This finding is important as it 
means that epithelial cells are not only responding to damage but have evolved to 
specifically recognize the peptide.
 Ece1-III62–92K is a secreted cytolytic peptide toxin
To demonstrate that Ece1-III is generated during epithelial infection, we performed LC-
MS/MS analysis on the secretome from wild-type C. albicans hyphae grown in the presence 
and absence of epithelial cells (Supplementary information). Notably, Ece1-III was the only 
peptide detected in the presence of epithelial cells, indicating that the fungus secretes this 
toxin during mucosal infection. However, the predominant form of secreted Ece1-III 
terminated in a K residue (SIIGIIMGILGNIPQVIQIIMSIVKAFKGNK; Ece1-III62–92K) 
and not KR (SIIGIIMGILGNIPQVIQIIMSIVKAFKGNKR; Ece1-III62–93KR) (Extended 
Data Table 3). In fungi, it is known that following Kex2p processing, many proteins are 
subsequently cleaved by Kex1p29 (also in the Golgi), removing the C-terminal R. LC-
MS/MS analysis on the hyphal secretome of a kex1Δ/Δ mutant demonstrated that the 
predominant peptide secreted terminates in KR (not K) (Supplementary information). 
Therefore, Ece1p is also subject to ordered Kex2p/Kex1p processing. Accordingly, we 
confirmed that Ece1-III62–92K functioned similarly to Ece1-III62–93KR with respect to 
epithelial cell activation. Specifically, Ece1-III62–92K is also α-helical (not shown) and 
induces c-Fos, p-MKP1, cytokines (IL-1α, G-CSF), damage (LDH), membrane intercalation 
and permeabilization, and calcium influx (Fig 4a–g). Thus, the dominant peptide secreted 
from C. albicans hyphae during mucosal infection is Ece1-III62–92K, which acts as a 
cytolytic peptide toxin that activates epithelial cells.
Based on these data, we propose a model of C. albicans mucosal infection whereby invasive 
hyphae secrete Ece1-62–92K into a membrane-bound ‘invasion pocket’30,31, facilitating 
peptide accumulation (Extended Data Fig 6). During early stages of infection, sub-lytic 
concentrations of Ece1-III62–92K induce epithelial immunity by activating the ‘danger 
response’ pathway (p-MKP1/c-Fos), alerting the host to the transition from colonizing yeast 
to invasive, toxin-producing hyphae. As infection progresses, Ece1-III62–92K levels 
accumulate and elicit direct tissue damage. Mechanistically, we propose that the asymmetric 
distribution of charge along the α-helix of Ece1-III62–92K facilitates correct peptide 
orientation relative to the host membrane, enabling intercalation, permeabilization and 
calcium influx. In conclusion, our data identifies C. albicans Ece1-III62–92K as the first 
cytolytic peptide toxin in a human fungal pathogen and reveals the molecular mechanisms of 
epithelial damage and host recognition of this clinically important fungus. We propose the 
name ‘Candidalysin’ for this newly discovered fungal toxin.

  METHODS
 Cell lines, reagents and Candida strains
Experiments were carried out using the TR146 buccal epithelial squamous cell carcinoma 
line32 obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) and 
grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were routinely 
tested for mycoplasma contamination using mycoplasma-specific primers and were found to 
be negative. Prior to stimulation, confluent TR146 cells were serum-starved overnight, and 
all experiments were carried out in serum-free DMEM. C. albicans wild type strains 
included the autotrophic strain BWP17+CIp3033 and the parental strain SC531434. Other C. 
albicans strains used and their sources are listed in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2. C. 
albicans cultures were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) 
at 30°C overnight. Cultures were washed in sterile PBS and adjusted to the required cell 
density. Antibodies to phospho-MKP1 and c-Fos were from Cell Signalling Technologies 
(New England Biolabs UK), mouse anti-human α-actin was from Millipore (UK), and goat 
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were from 
Jackson Immunologicals Ltd (Stratech Scientific, UK). Ece1p peptides were synthesized 
commercially (Proteogenix (France) or Peptide Synthetics (UK).
 Generation of C. albicans ECE1 mutant strains
ECE1 deletion was performed as previously described35. Deletion cassettes were generated 
by PCR36. Primers ECE1-FG and ECE1-RG were used to amplify pFA-HIS1 and pFA-
ARG4 -based markers. C. albicans BWP1737, was sequentially transformed38 with the 
ECE1-HIS1 and ECE1-ARG4 deletion cassettes and then transformed with CIp1039, 
yielding the ece1Δ/Δ deletion strain. For complementation, the ECE1 gene plus upstream 
and downstream intergenic regions were amplified with primers ECE1-RecF3k and ECE1-
RecR and cloned into plasmid CIp10 at MluI and SalI sites. This plasmid was transformed 
into the uridine auxotrophic ece1Δ/Δ strain, yielding the ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1 complemented 
strain. For generation of the ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279 strain, the CIp10-ECE1 was amplified 
with primers Pep3-F1 and Pep3-R1, digested with ClaI and re-ligated, yielding the 
CIp10+ECE1Δ184–279 plasmid. This plasmid was transformed into the uridine auxotrophic 
ece1Δ/Δ strain, yielding the ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279 strain. All integrations were confirmed 
by PCR/sequencing and at least two independent isogenic transformants were created to 
confirm results. KEX1 deletion was performed exactly as the ECE1 deletion but using 
primers KEX1-FG and KEX1-RG for creating the deletion cassette. Fluorescent strains of 
ece1Δ/Δ and BWP17 were constructed as previously described40. Briefly, the ece1Δ/Δ and 
BWP17 strains were transformed with the pENO1-dTom-NATr plasmid. Primers used to 
clone and construct the ECE1 genes and intragenic regions are listed in Extended Data Table 
4. Strains are listed in Extended Data Table 2.
 Construction of C. albicans ECE1 promoter-GFP strain
ECE1 promoter (primers 5′ECE1prom-NarI / 3′ECE1prom-XhoI) and terminator 
(5′ECE1term-SacII / 5′ECE1term-SacI) were amplified and cloned into pADH1-GFP. 
Resulting pSK-pECE1-GFP was verified by sequencing. C. albicans SC5314 was

 transformed with the pECE1-GFP transformation cassette38. Resistance to nourseothricin 
was used as selective marker and correct integration of GFP into the ECE1 locus was 
verified by PCR. Primers for cloning and validation are listed in Extended Data Table 4. 
Strains are listed in Extended Data Table 2.
 RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
C. albicans cells grown on TR146 epithelial cells were collected into RNA pure (PeqLab), 
centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 400 µl AE buffer (50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.3, 10 
mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Samples were vortexed (30 s), and an equal volume of phenol/
chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added and incubated for 5 min (65°C) before 
subjected to 2x freeze-thawing. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the RNA 
precipitated with isopropyl alcohol/0.3 M sodium acetate by incubating for 1 h at −20°C. 
Precipitated pellets were washed (2× 1 ml 70% ice-cold ethanol), resuspended in DEPC-
treated water and stored at −80°C. RNA integrity and concentration was confirmed using a 
Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA (500 ng) was treated with DNase (Epicenter) and cDNA 
synthesized using Reverse Transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were 
used for qPCR with EVAgreen mix (Bio&Sell). Primers (ACT1-F and ACT1-R for actin, 
ECE1-F and ECE1-R for ECE1 - Extended Data Table 4) were used at a final concentration 
of 500 nM. qPCR amplifications were performed using a Biorad CFX96 thermocycler. Data 
was evaluated using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 (Bio-Rad) with ACT1 as the reference gene 
and t0 as the control sample.
 Western blotting
TR146 cells were lysed using a modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) 
containing protease (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase (Perbio Science) inhibitors41, left on 
ice (30 min) and then clarified (10 min) in a refrigerated microfuge. Lysate total protein 
content was determined using the BCA protein quantitation kit (Perbio Science). 20 µg of 
total protein was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer to nitrocellulose 
membranes (GE Healthcare). After probing with primary (1:1000) and secondary (1:10,000) 
antibodies, membranes were developed using Immobilon chemiluminescent substrate 
(Millipore) and exposed to X-Ray film (Fuji film). Human α-actin was used as a loading 
control.
 Transcription factor DNA binding assay
DNA binding activity of transcription factors was assessed using the TransAM transcription 
factor ELISA system (Active Motif) as previously described41,42. Serum-starved TR146 
epithelial cells were treated for 3 h before being differentially lysed to recover nuclear 
proteins using a nuclear protein extraction kit (Active Motif) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Protein concentration was determined (BCA protein quantitation 
kit (Perbio Science)) and 5 µg of nuclear extract was assayed in the TransAM system 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data was expressed as fold-change in A450nm 
relative to resting cells.

  Cytokine determination
Cytokine levels in cell culture supernatants were determined using the Performance 
magnetic Fluorokine MAP cytokine multiplex kit (Bio-techne) and a Bioplex 200 machine. 
The data were analyzed using Bioplex Manager 6.1 software to determine analyte 
concentrations.
 Cell damage assay
Following incubation, culture supernatant was collected and assayed for lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using the Cytox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit 
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant porcine LDH (Sigma-
Aldrich) was used to generate a standard curve.
 Epithelial adhesion assay
Quantification of C. albicans adherence to TR146 epithelial cells was performed as 
described previously43. Briefly, TR146 cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips 
for 48 h in tissue culture plates in DMEM medium. C. albicans yeast cells (2 × 105) were 
added into 1 ml serum-free DMEM, incubated for 60 min (37°C/5% CO2) and non-adherent 
C. albicans cells removed by aspiration. Following washing (3× 1 ml PBS), cells were fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde (Roth) and adherent C. albicans cells stained with Calcofluor 
White and quantified using fluorescence microscopy. The number of adherent cells was 
determined by counting 100 high power fields of 200 µm × 200 µm size. Exact total cell 
numbers were calculated based on the quantified areas and the total size of the cover slip.
 Epithelial invasion assay
C. albicans invasion of epithelial cells was determined as described previously43. Briefly, 
TR146 epithelial cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips for 48 h and then 
infected with C. albicans yeast cells (1×105), for 3 h in a humidified incubator (37°C/5% 
CO2). Following washing (3x PBS), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. All 
surface adherent fungal cells were stained for 1 h with a rabbit anti-Candida antibody and 
subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody. After rinsing with PBS, 
epithelial cells were permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min) and fungal cells 
(invading and non-invading) were stained with Calcofluor White. Following rinsing with 
water, coverslips were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of invading 
C. albicans cells was determined by dividing the number of (partially) internalized cells by 
the total number of adherent cells. At least 100 fungal cells were counted on each coverslip.
 Imaging of C. albicans growth and invasion of epithelial cells
TR146 cells (105/ml) seeded on glass coverslips in DMEM/10% FBS were infected with C. 
albicans (2.5 × 104 cfu/ml) in DMEM and incubated for 6 h (37°C/5% CO2). Cells were 
washed with PBS, fixed overnight (4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde) and stained with 
Concanavalin A-Alexa Fluor 647 in PBS (10 µg/ml) for 45 min at room temperature in the 
dark with gentle shaking (70 rpm) to stain the fungal cell wall. Epithelial cells were 
permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37°C in the dark, then washed and 
stained with 10 µg/ml Calcofluor White (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5) for 20 min at room

 temperature in the dark with gentle shaking. Cells were rinsed in water and mounted on 
slides with 6 µl of ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent, before air drying for 2 h in the dark. 
Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope, and 5 
phase images were taken per picture.
 Scanning Electron Microscopy
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, TR146 cells were grown to confluence 
on Transwell inserts (Greiner) and serum starved overnight in serum-free DMEM. After 5 h 
of C. albicans incubation on epithelial cells at an MOI of 0.01, cell media was removed and 
samples were fixed overnight at 4°C with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M HEPES 
buffer (pH 7.2) and post-fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. 
After washing, samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series before being 
critical point dried (Polaron E3000, Quorum Technologies Ltd). Dried samples were 
mounted using carbon double side sticky discs (TAAB) on aluminium pins (TAAB) and gold 
coated in an Emitech K550X sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd). Samples were 
examined and images recorded using a FEI Quanta 200 field emission scanning electron 
microscope operated at 3.5 kV in high vacuum mode.
 Zebrafish swimbladder mucosal infection model
Zebrafish infections were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines under Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol A2009-11-01 at the University of 
Maine. To determine sample size, a power calculation was done for all experiments based on 
2-tails T-test in order to detect a minimum effect size of 0.8, with an alpha error probability 
of 0.05 and a power (1 – beta error probability) of 0.95. This gave a minimum number of 42 
fish for each group. The fish selected for the experiments were randomly assigned to the 
different groups by picking them from a pool without bias and the groups were injected in 
different orders. No blinding was used to read the results. Ten to twenty zebrafish per group 
per experiment were maintained at 33°C in E3 + PTU and used as previously described40. 
Briefly, 4 day post-fertilization (dpf) larvae were treated with 20 µg/ml dexamethasone 
dissolved in 0.1% DMSO 1 h prior to infection and thereafter. For tissue damage and 
neutrophil recruitment, individual AB or mpo:GFP fish (respectively) were injected into the 
swimbladder with 4 nl of PBS with/without 25–40 C. albicans yeast cells of ece1Δ/Δ-
dTomato, ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1+dTomato, ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279+dTomato or BWP17-dTomato. 
For tissue damage, 1 nl of Sytox green (0.05 mM in 1% DMSO) was injected at 20 h post-
infection into the swimbladder and fish were imaged by confocal microscopy at 24 h post-
infection. For neutrophil recruitment, fish were imaged at 24 h post-injection. For synthetic 
peptide damage, AB or α-catenin:citrine44 fish were injected with 2 nl of peptide (9 ng or 
1.25 ng per fish) or vehicle (40% DMSO or 5% DMSO) + SytoxGreen (0.05 mM in 1% 
DMSO) or SytoxOrange (0.5 mM in 10% DMSO) and the fish imaged by confocal 
microscopy 4 h later. Numbers of neutrophils and damaged cells observed were counted and 
tabulated for each fish.
 Zebrafish swimbladder fluorescence microscopy
Live zebrafish imaging was carried out as previously described40. Briefly, fish were 
anesthetized in Tris-buffered Tricaine (200 µg/ml, Western Chemicals) and further

 immobilized in a solution of 0.4% low-melting-point agarose (LMA, Lonza) in E3 + 
Tricaine in a 96-well plate glass-bottom imaging dish (Greiner Bio-On). Confocal imaging 
was carried out using an Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope with an FV-1000 laser 
scanning confocal system (Olympus). Images were collected and processed using Fluoview 
(Olympus) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). Panels are either a single slice for the 
differential interference contrast channel (DIC) with maximum projection overlays of 
fluorescence image channels (red-green), or maximum projection overlays of fluorescence 
channels. The number of slices for each maximum projection is specified in the legend of 
individual figures.
 Murine oropharyngeal candidiasis model
Murine infections were performed under UK Home Office Project Licence PPL 70/7598 in 
dedicated animal facilities at King’s College London. No statistical method was used to pre-
determine sample size. No method of randomization was used to allocate animals to 
experimental groups. Mice in the same cage were part of the same treatment. The 
investigators were not blinded during outcome assessment. A previously described murine 
model of oropharyngeal candidiasis using female Balb/c mice45 was modified for 
investigating early infection events. Briefly, mice were treated sub-cutaneously with 3 mg/
mouse (in 200 µl PBS with 0.5% Tween 80) of cortisone acetate on days −1 and 1 post-
infection. On day 0, mice were sedated for ∼75 min with an intra-peritoneal injection of 110 
mg/kg ketamine and 8 mg/kg xylazine, and a swab soaked in a 107 cfu/ml C. albicans yeast 
culture in sterile saline was placed sub-lingually for 75 min. After 2 days, mice were 
sacrificed, the tongue excised and divided longitudinally in half. One half was weighed, 
homogenized and cultured to derive quantitative Candida counts. The other half was 
processed for histopathology and immunohistochemistry.
 Immunohistochemistry of murine tissue
C. albicans infected murine tongues were fixed in 10% (v/v) formal-saline before being 
embedded and processed in paraffin wax using standard protocols. For each tongue, 5 µm 
sections were prepared using a Leica RM2055 microtome and silane coated slides. Sections 
were dewaxed using xylene, before C. albicans and infiltrating inflammatory cells were 
visualized by staining using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and counterstaining with 
haematoxylin. Sections were then examined by light microscopy. Histological quantification 
of infection was undertaken by measuring the area of infected epithelium and expressed as a 
percentage relative to the entire epithelial area.
 Whole cell patch clamp
TR146 epithelial cells were grown in 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc) for 48 h before recordings 
at low cell density (10–30% confluence). Cells were superfused with a modified Krebs 
solution (120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 22.6 mM NaHCO2, 
11.1 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4). Isolated cells were recorded at room temperature 
(21–23°C) in whole cell mode using microelectrodes (5–7 MΩ) containing 90 mM 
potassium acetate, 20 mM KCl, 40 mM HEPES, 3 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 
(free Ca2+ 40 nM), pH 7.4. Cells were voltage clamped at −60 mV using an Axopatch 200A 
amplifier (Axon Instruments) and current/voltage curves were generated by 1 s steps

 between −100 to + 50 mV. Treatments were applied to the superfusate to produce the final 
required concentration, with vehicle controls similarly applied. Data was recorded using 
Clampex software (PClamp 6, Axon Instrument) and analyzed with Clampfit 10.
 Calcium flux
TR146 cells were grown in a 96-well plate overnight until confluent. The medium was 
removed and 50 µl of a Fura-2 solution (5 µl Fura-2 (Life Technologies)(2.5 mM in 50% 
Pluronic F-127 (Life technologies):50% DMSO), 5 µl probenecid (Sigma) in 5 ml saline 
solution (NaCl (140 mM), KCl (5 mM), MgCl2 (1 mM), CaCl2 (2 mM), Glucose (10 mM) 
and HEPES (10 mM), adjusted to pH 7.4)) was added and the plate incubated for 1 h at 
37°C/5% CO2. The Fura-2 solution was replaced with 50 µl saline solution and baseline 
fluorescence readings (excitation 340 nm/emission 520nm) taken for 10 min using a 
FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices). Ece1 peptides were added at different concentrations and 
readings immediately taken for up to 3 h. The data was analyzed using Softmax Pro software 
to determine calcium present in the cell cytosol and expressed as the ratio between excitation 
and emission spectra.
 Impedance spectroscopy of tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs)
tBLMs with 10% tethering lipids and 90% spacer lipids (T10 slides) were formed using the 
solvent exchange technique46,47 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SDx Tethered 
Membranes Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia). Briefly, 8 µl of 3 mM lipid solutions in ethanol 
were added, incubated for 2 min and then 93.4 µl buffer (100 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 
7.0) was added. After rinsing 3x with 100 µl buffer the conductance and capacitance of the 
membranes were measured for 20 min before injection of Ece1 peptides at different 
concentrations. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Signals were 
measured using the tethaPod (SDx Tethered Membranes Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia).
 FRET intercalation experiments
Intercalation of Ece1 peptides into phospholipid liposomes was determined by FRET 
spectroscopy applied as a probe-dilution assay48. Phospholipids mixed with each 1% (mol/
mol) of the donor dye NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and of the acceptor dye 
rhodamine-PE, were dissolved in chloroform, dried, solubilized in 1 ml buffer (100 mM 
KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) by vortexing, sonicated with a titan tip (30 W, Branson sonifier, 
cell disruptor B15), and subjected to three cycles of heating to 60°C and cooling down to 
4°C, each for 30 min. Lipid samples were stored at 4°C for at least 12 h before use. Ece1 
peptide was added to liposomes and intercalation was monitored as the increase of the 
quotient between the donor fluorescence intensity ID at 531 nm and the acceptor intensity IA 
at 593 nm (FRET signal) independent of time.
 Circular Dichroism spectroscopy
CD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan 
Spectroscopic Co., Japan), calibrated as described previously49. CD spectra represent the 
average of four scans obtained by collecting data at 1 nm intervals with a bandwidth of 2

 nm. The measurements were performed in 100 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 at 25°C and 
40°C in a 1.0 mm quartz cuvette. The Ece1-III concentration was 15 µM.
 Planar lipid bilayers
Planar lipid bilayers were prepared using the Montal-Mueller technique50 as described 
previously51. All measurements were performed in 5 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0 
(specific electrical conductivity 17.2 mS/cm) at 37°C.
 Hyphal secretome preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis
Candida strains were cultured for 18 h in hyphae inducing conditions (YNB medium 
containing 2% sucrose, 75 mM MOPSO buffer pH 7.2, 5 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, 
37°C). Hyphal supernatants were collected by filtering through a 0.2 µm PES filter, and 
peptides were enriched by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) using first C4 and subsequently 
C18 columns on the C4 flowthrough. After drying in a vacuum centrifuge, samples were 
resolubilised in loading solution (0.2% formic acid in 71:27:2 ACN/H2O/DMSO (v/v/v)) 
and filtered through a 10 kDa MWCO filter. The filtrate was transferred into HPLC vials and 
injected into the LC-MS/MS system. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out on an Ultimate 
3000 nano RSLC system coupled to a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher 
Scientific). Peptide separation was performed based on a direct injection setup without 
peptide trapping using an Accucore C4 column as stationary phase and a column oven 
temperature of 50°C. The binary mobile phase consisting of A) 0.2% (v/v) formic acid in 
95:5 H2O/DMSO (v/v) and B) 0.2% (v/v) formic acid in 85:10:5 ACN/H2O/DMSO (v/v/v) 
was applied for a 60 min gradient elution: 0–1.5 min at 60% B, 35–45 min at 96% B, 45.1–
60 min at 60% B. The Nanospray Flex Ion Source (ThermoFisher Scientific) provided with a 
stainless steel emitter was used to generate positively charged ions at 2.2 kV spray voltage. 
Precursor ions were measured in full scan mode within a mass range of m/z 300–1600 at a 
resolution of 70k FWHM using a maximum injection time of 120 ms and an automatic gain 
control target of 1e6. For data-dependent acquisition, up to 10 most abundant precursor ions 
per scan cycle with an assigned charge state of z = 2–6 were selected in the quadrupole for 
further fragmentation using an isolation width of m/z 2.0. Fragment ions were generated in 
the HCD cell at a normalised collision energy of 30 V using nitrogen gas. Dynamic 
exclusion of precursor ions was set to 20 s. Fragment ions were monitored at a resolution of 
17.5k (FWHM) using a maximum injection time of 120 ms and an AGC target of 2e5.
 Protein database search
Thermo raw files were processed by the Proteome Discoverer (PD) software v1.4.0.288 
(Thermo). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Candida Genome Database 
(http://www.candidagenome.org/download/sequence/C_albicans_SC5314/Assembly22/
current/C_albicans_SC5314_A22_current_orf_trans_all.fasta.gz;status: 2015/05/03) using 
the Sequest HT search algorithm. Mass spectra were searched for both unspecific cleavages 
(no enzyme) and tryptic peptides with up to 4 missed cleavages. The precursor mass 
tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Target Decoy PSM 
Validator node and a reverse decoy database was used for (qvalue) validation of the peptide 
spectral matches (PSMs) using a strict target false discovery (FDR) rate of < 1%. 
Furthermore, we used the Score versus Charge State function of the Sequest engine to filter

 out insignificant peptide hits (xcorr of 2.0 for z=2, 2.25 for z=3, 2.5 for z=4, 2.75 for z=5, 
3.0 for z=6). At least two unique peptides per protein were required for positive protein hits.
 Statistics
TransAM and patch clamp data were analyzed using a paired t-test whilst cytokines, LDH 
and calcium influx data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with all compared groups 
passing an equal variance test. Murine in vivo data was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney 
test. Zebrafish data was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple 
comparison correction. In all cases, P < 0.05 was taken to be significant.

Extended Data Figure 6. Schematic of the role of Ece1-III in C. albicans infection of epithelial 
cells
During early stage infection of the mucosal surface by C. albicans, Ece1-III (red α-helix) is 
secreted into the invasion pocket created by the invading hypha (a). Sub-lytic concentrations 
of Ece1-III trigger epithelial signal transduction through MAPK, p38/MKP-1 and c-Fos (b) 
resulting in the production of immune regulatory cytokines (c). As the severity of the 
infection increases, Ece1-III accumulates (d) and once lytic concentrations are reached, 
causes membrane damage and the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the host epithelium 
(e), concomitant with calcium influx (f). Epithelial signal transduction is maintained (g) and 
additionally induces the release of damage associated cytokines, such as IL-1α (h). Ece1-III 
may also have activity on the epithelial surface outside of the invasion pocket and on 
neighboring cells not in contact with hyphae if Ece1-III is produced in sufficient 
concentrations.

This study
*Morphology recorded 2 h post-infection on TR146 buccal epithelial cell monolayers; hyphae includes pseudohyphae.
†Data based on Western blotting.
‡Cytokines includes IL-1α, IL-6 and G-CSF.
§Damage measured by LDH assay.
║New ece1Δ/Δ also created in this study (See Extended Data Table 2). Original mutant (in red) produced by [27] using the 
URA-blaster protocol [3]. A set of ece1 mutants, including partial deletion of ECE1 and a revertant, was produced in this 
study in the same genetic background using strain BWP17 to avoid a URA3 effect based on genomic location [109110].
¶Partial activation is due to lack of adhesion.
