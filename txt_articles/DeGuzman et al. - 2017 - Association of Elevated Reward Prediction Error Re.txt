Objective: Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder of
unknown etiology. Understanding associations between
behavior and neurobiology is important in treatment de-
velopment. Using a novel monetary reward task during
functional magnetic resonance brain imaging, the authors
tested how brain reward learning in adolescent anorexia
nervosa changes with weight restoration.
Method: Female adolescents with anorexia nervosa (N=21;
mean age, 16.4 years [SD=1.9]) underwent functional MRI
(fMRI) before and after treatment; similarly, healthy female
control adolescents (N=21; mean age, 15.2 years [SD=2.4])
underwent fMRI on two occasions. Brain function was tested
using the reward prediction error construct, a computational
model for reward receipt and omission related to motiva-
tion and neural dopamine responsiveness.
Results: Compared with the control group, the anorexia
nervosa group exhibited greater brain response 1) for pre-
diction error regression within the caudate, ventral caudate/
nucleus accumbens, and anterior and posterior insula, 2) to
unexpected reward receipt in the anterior and posterior insula,
and 3) to unexpected reward omission in the caudate body.
Prediction error and unexpected reward omission response
tended to normalize with treatment, while unexpected reward
receipt response remained significantly elevated. Greater
caudate prediction error response when underweight was
associated with lower weight gain during treatment. Pun-
ishment sensitivity correlated positively with ventral caudate
prediction error response.
Conclusions: Reward system responsiveness is elevated in
adolescent anorexia nervosa when underweight and after
weight restoration. Heightened prediction error activity in brain
reward regions may represent a phenotype of adolescent
anorexia nervosa that does not respond well to treatment.
Prediction error response could be a neurobiological marker
of illness severity that can indicate individual treatment needs.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that primarily affects
young females and is associated with high mortality (1). The
diagnostic criteria include restriction of energy intake that
leads to significantly low body weight and an intense fear of
gaining weight or becoming fat (2). The etiology of anorexia
nervosa is complex,andonlyrecently have we beguntobetter
understand its underlying neurobiology.
Brain imaging studies in anorexia nervosa have implicated
central reward circuits that take part in the control of food
intake (3–5). For instance, structural and functional differ-
ences in the insula have been found between patients with
anorexia nervosa and healthy subjects (6, 7). Prefrontal and
striatal responses to monetary reward are also altered in
adults ill with or recovered from anorexia nervosa (8, 9). In
adolescent anorexia nervosa, heightened posterior caudate
response to monetary losses was associated with altered
reward learning (10). These studies provide evidence for
altered reward system function in anorexia nervosa. How-
ever, neurotransmitter-based hypotheses, which are key
to developing pharmacological interventions, are largely
lacking.
Dopamine mediates reward learning (11) and has been im-
plicated in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (3, 12, 13).
Midbrain dopaminergic neurons exhibit a phasic burst when an
unexpected reward is received (positive prediction error). They
will then shift the signal to the onset of a conditioned stimulus
that they have learned predicts reward receipt (11). A negative
prediction error (a dip in dopamine neuron activity) is evoked
when the predictedstimulus association is violated (unexpected
reward omission, negative prediction error). The prediction
error can be modeled in a temporal difference, or rein-
forcement learning, algorithm. In previous studies, we found
increased ventral striatum, insula, and prefrontal cortex re-
sponse in adult anorexia nervosa (11, 14, 15).

ARTICLES
 We applied this model in a novel monetary reward
paradigm, modeled after the taste paradigm (14). Specifi-
cally, we aimed to study dopamine-related brain responses
independent fromfoodstimuliinadolescentanorexianervosa.
Animal studies show that food restriction or weight loss en-
hances dopamine response to rewards (16), and we expected
heightened brain activity in underweight adolescent anorexia
nervosa. Using a longitudinal design, we tested whether group
differences would normalize with weight restoration. We
expected that dopamine-model-related activation would
show incomplete normalization with weight restoration.
We further expected that greater brain response using the
prediction error model would predict poor recovery, in-
dicating a more severe illness and suggesting that dopa-
mine function could be a treatment target in adolescent
anorexia nervosa.
METHOD
Participants
Twenty-one female adolescents diagnosed with anorexia
nervosa (age range, 13–20 years) and 21 healthy comparison
female adolescents (age range, 11–20 years) participated
(Table 1). The anorexia nervosa group was recruited from
partial hospitalization programs, where closely supervised
meal plans mitigated acute starvation or dehydration ef-
fects. Healthy control participants were recruited through
local advertisements. All participants in the anorexia ner-
vosa group were diagnosed with restricting type, except for
one with binge/purge type. Each participant underwent
functionalMRI(fMRI)twice:individualswithanorexianervosa
before weight restoration and at discharge to a lower level of
care, and healthy control subjects during the early follicular
phase, two menstrual cycles apart, to reduce sex hormone ef-
fects on brain reward function. Participants with anorexia
nervosa were without menstrual cycle. For participants age
18 or older, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (2) was
administered by a doctoral-level interviewer (four in the an-
orexia nervosa group, two in the healthy control group). Those
under age 18 completed the Mini-International Neuropsychi-
atricInterview(17).Allparticipantswereright-handedandhad
no history of head trauma, neurological disease, major medical
illness, psychosis, or substance use disorders. Two participants
in the healthy control group and four in the anorexia nervosa
group took oral contraceptives. In the anorexia nervosa group,
10 individuals at scan 1 and 12 at scan 2 took antidepressants,
and two at scan 1 and five at scan 2 took atypical antipsychotics.
The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board approved
the study. Participants who were age 18 and older, and the parents
of those under age 18, provided written informed consent.

REWARD PREDICTION ERROR RESPONSE AND WEIGHT GAIN IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA
 Questionnaire (19), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (20),
and the Temperament and Character Inventory (21).
Monetary Reward Task
During fMRI, participants received three monetary un-
conditioned stimuli (US): win (100 trials, 25 cents each),
no-win (100 trials), or neutral (80 trials). Participants learned
to associate unique visual conditioned stimuli (CS, geometric
shapes) with each US (see Figure S1 in the data supplement
that accompanies the online edition of this article) (15). Fixing
the first 10 trials as CS-win followed by US-win established an
initial association. All subsequent trials were fully random-
ized and CS was probabilistically associated with its corre-
sponding US: CS-win was followed in 20% of trials by no-win
(unexpected reward omission condition), and CS-no win was
followed in 20% of trials by win (unexpected reward receipt
condition).
fMRI Image Acquisition
Between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. on the study day, the anorexia
nervosa group ate their meal plan breakfast and healthy
controls ate a breakfast that was quality- and calorie-
matched to the average anorexia nervosa group breakfast
(Table 1). Brain imaging was performed between 8:00 and
9:00 a.m. on a 3-T GE scanner, with a three-plane scout
scan (16 seconds), sagittally acquired, spoiled gradient se-
quence T1-weighted (168 slices, thickness=1.2 mm, TI=450
ms, TR=10 ms, TE=3 ms, flip angle=10°, FOV=22 cm, scan
matrix=2563256) (see Figure S2 in the online data sup-
plement), and T2*-weighted echo planar imaging scans for
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional activity
during task performance (3.433.434 mm voxels, TR=2.1 seconds,
TE=30 ms, flip angle=70°, 28 axial slices, thickness=2.6 mm,
gap=1.4 mm).
fMRI Analysis
Image preprocessing and analysis were performed using
SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/).
Participants’ images were realigned to the first volume,
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template,
and smoothed at 6 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian
kernel. Data were modeled with a hemodynamic response
function-convolved boxcar function using the general linear
model, including temporal and dispersion derivatives, and
autoregression. A 128-second high-pass filter was applied for
low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations. Data were pre-
processed with slice time correction. Motion parameters
were applied as regressors in the first-level analysis. We
extracted mean parameter estimates across all voxels within
predefined anatomical regions of interest (http://marsbar.
sourceforge.net/) in order to avoid problems from small-
volume-corrected peak voxel statistics or violation of nor-
mal distribution. We explored standard a priori bilateral (22)
reward circuitry regions of interest (using the Automated
Anatomical Labeling Atlas [23]): the dorsal anterior insula,
ventral anterior insula, posterior insula, caudate body,
caudate head, ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens, sub-
stantia nigra, inferior orbitofrontal cortex, medial orbito-
frontal cortex, and middle orbitofrontal cortex (Figure 1).
Temporal difference reinforcement learning analysis. Each
participant’s prediction error signal was modeled based on
trial sequence to test reinforcement learning model-related
brain response and regressed with brain activation across
all trials (11, 14, 15). In brief, the predicted reward value (V)
at any time (t) within a trial was calculated as a linear prod-
uct of weights (wi ) and the presence of a conditioned visual
stimulus (CS) at time t, coded in a stimulus representation
vector xi(t). The predicted stimulus value at time t is updated
by comparing the predicted value at time t+1 to that actually
observed at time t, leading to the prediction error d(t) (see the
online data supplement for a full description).
Group-by-condition analysis. First-level contrast images
were analyzed using general linear models for voxel response
as a function of stimulus condition: expected receipt, un-
expected receipt, expected omission, unexpected omission,
and expected neutral condition. Three contrasts of interest
were computed: 1) CS no-win followed by unexpected win,
contrasted against CS no-win followed by no win (unexpected
receipt); 2) CS win followed by unexpected US no-win,
contrasted against CS win followed by expected win
(unexpected omission); 3) CS win contrasted against CS
no-win (win-expectation) (14).

 Statistical Analysis
Behavioral data and extracted brain activation parameter
estimates were analyzed with SPSS, version 23 (IBM,
Armonk, N.Y.).
Extracted region-of-interest parameter estimates were
tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and rank-
transformed. We conducted a mixed analysis of covariance
for each condition that included all 20 regions of interest,
group, and scan day (including age, antipsychotic and anti-
depressant use, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders
as covariates). We used the tests of within-subject effects to
determine significant group-by-scan interactions. The tests
for between-subject effects evaluated significant group or scan
effects using Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons.
Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to test behavior-
brain response relationships for age, body mass index (BMI),
treatment duration (number of days between scans), harm
avoidance, reward and punishment sensitivity, and state and
trait anxiety. Significant correlations were corrected for multi-
ple comparisons (false discovery rate) (24) and verified using
bootstrap procedures (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals).
RESULTS
Demographic and Behavioral Data
The anorexia nervosa group had a significantly lower mean
BMI and scored significantly higher on eating pathology
and anxiety than the healthy control group (Table 1).
Punishment sensitivity was significantly higher in the an-
orexia nervosa group, but reward sensitivity was not (see
Figure S3 in the online data supplement). The healthy control
group had no significant difference in BMI across scans but
significantly more days between scans than the anorexia
nervosa group. The mean BMI in the anorexia nervosa group
significantly increased from first to second scan (p,0.001).
Brain-Imaging Results
No significant group-by-scan effects were observed for any of
thecontrasts(Table2; seealso TableS1in thedatasupplement).
Temporal difference reinforcement learning analysis. There
was a significant main effect of group for prediction error
regressionweights intheleftandrightcaudatebody,theright
caudate head, the right ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens,
the right dorsal anterior, ventral anterior, and posterior in-
sula, and the left posterior insula (Figure 2A). Post hoc tests
indicated significantly greater activity in the anorexia nervosa
group when underweight compared with the healthy control
group. There was a significant left posterior insula scan effect
(p,0.020, hp2=0.15).
Group-by-condition analysis. Reward expectation analysis
showed a significant main effect of group for the right pos-
terior insula (Figure 2B).
Unexpected reward omission analysis showed a signifi-
cant group main effect in the left caudate body (Figure 2C),
with greater activity in the anorexia nervosa group compared
with the control group at scan 1.
Unexpected reward receipt showed a significant group
main effect (Figure 2D) in the left and right dorsal anterior
insula andthe right ventral anterior and posterior insula. Post
hoc analysis showed greater posterior insula activity in the
anorexia nervosa group when underweight. Left dorsal and
right ventral anterior insula activity was greater in the an-
orexia nervosa group at scan 2. Right dorsal anterior insula
activity was significantly greater in the anorexia nervosa
group at both scans.
Brain-Imaging Response and Demographic and
Behavioral Correlation Results
BMI change in the anorexia nervosa group was significantly
negatively correlated with underweight middle orbitofrontal
cortex response to reward expectation (Figure 3A). Right
caudate head prediction error regression weights were
significantly negatively correlated with discharge BMI
(Figure 3D). Sensitivity to punishment in the anorexia
nervosa group was significantly positively correlated with
underweight prediction error regression weights in the left
and right ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens (Figure 3B).
Harm avoidance in the anorexia nervosa group was signifi-
cantly positively correlated with left ventral caudate/nucleus
accumbens prediction error regression. In an additional
partial correlation analysis controlling for harm avoid-
ance, caudate/nucleus accumbens prediction error and pun-
ishment sensitivity continued to be significantly related
(p,0.020); however, there was no significant correlation
between caudate/nucleus accumbens prediction error and
harm avoidance when controlling for punishment sensitivity.
In the anorexia nervosa group, treatment duration (number
of days between scans) was significantly positively correlated
with scan 1 prediction error regression weights in the right
substantia nigra (Figure 3C). After treatment, the anorexia
nervosa group’s sensitivity to reward was significantly pos-
itively correlated with left dorsal anterior insula response to
reward expectation (r=0.6, R2=0.36, p,0.040).
Relationship Between BMI Change and Time in
Treatment
Asexpected,timeinanorexianervosatreatment(indays)was
positively correlated with weight gain (r=0.489; p,0.025).
We explored whether high or low prediction error signal-
ing at scan 1 differentially predicted rate of weight gain
(Figure 3E). The high-low split was conducted in two ways: a
low-prediction-error group with N=10 or N=11, and a high-
prediction-error group with N=11 or N=10, respectively, to
account for the uneven subject number. Correlation results
between BMI change and time in treatment for split 1 are
presented in Figure 3E; for split 2, R2 was 0.48 (p,0.017)
for the low-prediction-error group and 0.02 (n.s) for the
high-prediction-error group. BMI at scan 1 was not signifi-
cantly different between the high (mean=16.4, SD=1.1) and
low (mean=16.5, SD=1.0) prediction error response groups

DISCUSSION
This study yielded three main findings. First, brain reward
circuit responses were elevated in adolescents with anorexia
nervosa in the caudate and insula during a reward learning
paradigm that used a computational model for dopamine-
related prediction error response. Caudate prediction error
response was related to rate of weight gain during treat-
ment and could be a neurobiological marker of illness se-
verity to predict individual treatment needs. Second, after
weight restoration, elevated prediction error responses in
the striatum and insula tended to normalize but were still
elevated. This result aligns with animal models showing that
underweight is associated with increased dopamine-related
reward system responsiveness that only partially recovers
with weight restoration (25). Third, dorsal and ventral an-
teriorinsulaactivationstounexpectedmonetaryreceiptwere
alsogreateratdischargeintheanorexianervosagroup.Those
additional results support the insula’s involvement in ado-
lescent anorexia nervosa psychopathology even after weight
restoration (26). It remains to be seen whether these patients
process positive salient stimuli differently after weeks of
treatment, or whether long-term effects of low body weight
on insula function during unexpected receipt of salient stim-
uli becomes exaggerated with weight restoration.
This monetary reinforcement learning model revealed,
in adolescent anorexia nervosa, elevated striatal and insular
activity (27) comparable to prediction error taste reward
results in adults (14). The caudate and nucleus accumbens
are known to respond to salient stimuli (28) and encode
prediction error signals during stimulus reward learning,
which may suggest altered dopamine functioning in anorexia
nervosa (29). The insula contains the primary taste cortex and
integrates body perception signals, but it also contributes to
cognitive control and tracks error (30–32). Insula prediction
error signaling has been associated with flexible behavior

 control, and heightened response could alter reversal learn-
ing in adolescent anorexia nervosa. This may be especially
relevantwhenanindividual mustreverse maintainedbehavior
response to anxiety-provoking food cues. Whether dopami-
nergic neurons contributed to greater insula signaling in
anorexia nervosa is unclear, but it is likely that other neu-
rotransmitter signaling was also involved (32, 33).
Brain response in the middle orbitofrontal cortex during
reward expectation before treatment was related to weight
change during anorexia nervosa treatment. Higher activation
was associated with lower BMI increase, although the mon-
etary task did not reveal group differences in orbitofrontal
cortexactivation. Activation in this brain region during a food
cue task has been associated with a personal sense of lack of
control and thoughts of guilt, as well as control over salient
stimuli (34, 35). It is possible that high response during re-
ward stimulus expectation triggers thoughts of guilt and
strengthens control over or resistance to approach of sa-
lient stimuli. Furthermore, in the anorexia nervosa group,
the higher the caudate prediction error values were at the

REWARD PREDICTION ERROR RESPONSE AND WEIGHT GAIN IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA

This suggests that more severely altered brain function is
reflectiveofmoresevereillnessandworseoutcome.Afurther
examination of this relationship indicated that number of

the anorexia nervosa group with relatively low prediction
error signaling. In other words, individuals in the anorexia
nervosa group with prediction error activity closer to that
of healthy controls predictably gained weight, about 1 BMI
point every 20 days; however, this did not apply to individ-
uals with initially high prediction error brain activation. This
suggests that individuals with more severely dysfunctional
reward systems do not respond in the same way to the
treatment regimen with therapist and family-based meal
support. This finding has important implications for de-
veloping neurobiological markers of illness severity that can
predict treatment needs on an individual basis. It may in-
dicate a need to develop alternative or additional approaches
for the high brain response group.
Sensitivity to punishment was elevated in adolescent
anorexia nervosa, and it was positively correlated with
ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens prediction error signaling

 when underweight, but not at discharge. Bischoff-Grethe
et al. (10) found that the posterior striatum was more sensi-
tive to loss during a guessing game in adolescents with
anorexia nervosa compared with healthy subjects, which
may be in support of our finding. It should be noted, how-
ever, that our novel monetary task required participants
to learn associations to predict outcomes, rather than make
guesses. Elevated prediction error response could reflect
high dopamine-neuronal activation in anorexia nervosa,
which may drive high punishment sensitivity, especially
when underweight. Harm avoidance also is typically ele-
vated in anorexia nervosa. We further hypothesize that harm
avoidance could be a functional response to excessively high
sensitivity to negative salient stimuli (punishment), and thus
reflects an attempt to avoid such negative experiences. In
time, harm avoidance may become a learned and self-reinforcing
behavior that becomes independent from weight status and
high punishment sensitivity.
Interestingly, reward sensitivity scores were higher in
the anorexia nervosa group but not significantly different
between groups, which is in contrast to some studies but
in accord with others (36). This finding might suggest a
more flexible sensitivity to reward in adolescent compared
with adult anorexia nervosa, but adolescents with anorexia
nervosa may nevertheless find negative salient stimuli dif-
ficult to tolerate as they navigate recovery. On the other hand,
mean values for reward sensitivity in the anorexia nervosa
group were comparable to those in our previous study, and
the lack of significant group differences could be an effect of
sample size (37). We also found a pattern of reward expectation
responses in the insula, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex
positively correlating with punishment and reward sensitiv-
ity in anorexia nervosa, although it was not significant after
multiple comparison corrections. This was primarily the case
forpunishmentsensitivityatscan1,butwithrewardsensitivity
at scan 2 (see Table S4 in the data supplement). Whether there
is a balance between brain reward response and sensitivity to
salient stimuli that shifts from punishment to reward during
weight restoration is a direction of our ongoing studies.
The results of our study must be interpreted in light of its
limitations. fMRI does not directly measure brain dopamine
signaling. However, the well-studied behavior of dopami-
nergic neurons that is modeled in our computational analysis
suggests altered dopamine-related reward processing in the
brain in adolescent anorexia nervosa. The mechanism for the
elevated prediction error response is uncertain and requires
further study, but it may occur through up-regulation of
dopamine D1 or D2 receptor function (38). However, non-
dopaminergic neurons also play a role (33). Another potential
limitation was the group difference in the time between
scans. Variability in anorexia nervosa treatment duration is a
challenge in studying this patient population, and treatment
duration in the anorexia nervosa group did not exactly match
the requirement of two menstrual cycles between scans to
study healthy controls at a low estrogen state. However, a
significant increase in mean BMI was still achieved in the
anorexia nervosa group in this period. Although another
limitation is that our patient sampleusedvarious medications
and had various comorbid disorders, this group reflects a
typical clinical sample, and we did account for these variables
in our analyses. Our main findings held when the one patient
with binge/purge type anorexia nervosa was excluded from
the analyses (see Table S2 in the data supplement) and when
individuals taking antipsychotics were excluded (see Table
S3 in the data supplement).
In summary, this study suggests that reward learning in
general, and independently of primary taste reward, is im-
portant for our overall understanding of the neurobiology
of adolescent anorexia nervosa. Generalized sensitization of
brain reward responsiveness could be a result of food re-
strictionandmaylastlongintorecovery,consistentwithbasic
research (16, 25). Whether individuals with anorexia nervosa
have a genetic predisposition for such a sensitization requires
further study. Furthermore, our results suggest that elevated
prediction error response in the caudate is a marker for ill-
ness severity and predicts weight gain in a highly structured
treatment program. The mechanism for such a relationship
is unclear. However, starvation-induced altered dopamine
receptor expression could cause such a phenomenon (39).
Alternatively, metabolic dopamine-related factors could be
involved, or high prediction error may characterize a cog-
nitively severe form of adolescent anorexia nervosa that is
more “resistant” to treatment. Future studies should aim to
elucidate these mechanisms and how elevated dopamine
brain response even after weight restoration could be a risk
factor for relapse, which is common in the disorder. The
answer would have important implications for treatment
development. Specifically, reducing high dopamine-related
brain response could be a valuable treatment target (13).
To explore this relationship, future studies should include
longer-term follow-up measures. Behaviorally, sensitivity to
punishment could be related to relapse, as anorexia nervosa
behaviors are often described as “safe and predictable.”
Whether our above-discussed hypothesis that heightened
dopamine-related response triggers high sensitivity to pun-
ishment, and that high harm avoidance becomes an adaptive
behavior that persists even after weight normalization, re-
mains to be further tested. A comprehensive understanding
of the role of other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, in
these mechanisms is also needed (40). Despite those limi-
tations and the need for replication, this study provides hope
that there are biological markers for adolescent anorexia
nervosa that could be used in estimating treatment success
as well as in developing pharmacological interventions.
