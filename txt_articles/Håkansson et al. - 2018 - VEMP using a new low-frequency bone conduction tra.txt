Objective: A new prototype bone conduction (BC) transducer B250, with an emphasized low-
frequency response, is evaluated in vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) investigations. 
The aim was to compare cervical (cVEMP) and ocular (oVEMP) responses using tone bursts 
at 250 and 500 Hz with BC stimulation using the B250 and the conventional B81 transducer 
and by using air conduction (AC) stimulation.
Methods: Three normal subjects were investigated in a pilot study. BC stimulation was applied 
to the mastoids in cVEMP
, and both mastoid and forehead in oVEMP investigations.
Results: BC stimulation was found to reach VEMP thresholds at considerably lower hearing 
levels than in AC stimulation (30–40 dB lower oVEMP threshold at 250 Hz). Three or more 
cVEMP and oVEMP responses at consecutive 5 dB increasing mastoid stimulation levels were 
only obtained in all subjects using the B250 transducer at 250 Hz. Similar BC thresholds were 
obtained for both ipsilateral and contralateral mastoid stimulation. Forehead stimulation, if 
needed, may require a more powerful vibration output.
Conclusion: Viable VEMP responses can be obtained at a considerably lower hearing level with 
BC stimulation than by AC stimulation. The cVEMP and oVEMP responses were similar when 
measured on one side and with the B250 attached to both ipsilateral and contralateral mastoids.

Introduction
Bone conduction (BC) offers a well-researched parallel sound transmission path to 
the cochlea that is used in many applications.3,4 These applications range from con-
sumer listening devices and hearing implants5–8 to audiometric testing devices.9,10 Our 
research group has now started to look into vestibular testing using BC stimuli, which 
is the focus of this paper.
In vestibular testing, the end organ for the bone-conducted vibrations is not the 
cochlear hair cells but instead the hair cells in the vestibular labyrinth, with the cupulas 
in the three orthogonal semicircular canals, and the otolith organ, comprising the essen-
tially horizontal oriented macula utriculi and essentially the vertical oriented macula 
sacculi.11 A relatively new vestibular testing procedure named vestibular evoked myo-
genic potential (VEMP), has attracted increased interest in recent years. This technique, 
which was first clinically demonstrated by Colebatch and Halmagyi12 and Colebatch 
et al,13 consists of recordings of involuntary muscular response to stimulus from loud 
sound or skull vibration. In VEMP
, a human body reflex activates muscular responses 
in order to restore posture and head position after unexpected rapid spatial movement.

VEMP was originally measured by electromyography (EMG) 
recorded from electrodes on the skin over the sternocleido-
mastoideus muscle (SCM), also known as the cervical muscle 
(cVEMP). Later, EMG recordings from electrodes over the 
ocular inferior oblique orbital muscle (IOM) under the eye 
(oVEMP) were also introduced; for example, Todd et al.14 In 
the first clinical studies, air-conducted (AC) sound was used 
for excitation, but later tapping or BC sound was also used; 
for example, Halmagyi et al15 developed a reflex hammer for 
forehead excitation.
Although not yet fully explored, there seems to be a 
consensus that cVEMP predominantly reflects saccular acti-
vation via the inferior vestibular nerve,16,17 whereas oVEMP 
reflects utricular activation via the superior vestibular nerve.18 
There is scientific evidence that BC stimulation, similarly to 
AC stimulation, is evoking VEMP in guinea pigs.17,18 This 
finding opens for evoking VEMP responses with less sound 
burden than by AC and offers a possibility for patients with 
conductive hearing loss to undergo a VEMP investigation.
Detailed standardized methodologies for both cVEMP and 
oVEMP have been called for, but have yet to be established. 
In a review article, Papathanasiou et al20 presented guidelines 
regarding cVEMP
, but stated that “we do not propose a single 
methodology as clinical use of cVEMPs is evolving and 
questions still exist about its underlying physiology and its 
measurement”. The first challenge is to decide which stimula-
tion modality should be used (AC or BC) and, if BC is chosen, 
which type of transducer should be used for the excitation. 
The second challenge is to decide which signal is the most 
efficient for obtaining a VEMP response with a particular 
transducer. While it is not mentioned so often, there is also 
a question about the clinical applicability and robustness of 
the different methods. Applicability is a highly relevant issue 
if VEMP is going to be used as a standard clinical procedure 
since it should then be easy to perform and the sound level 
required should not be uncomfortably high. Several options 
including either AC or BC stimulation are available to solve 
these issues but every solution has its pros and cons.
Halmagyi et al15 used manually applied tapped mechani-
cal stimuli to evoke VEMP
, although this technique never 
went into clinical practice, most likely because that manual 
tapping was found to be difficult to control and lacked 
repeatability. To overcome these issues, an electromagnetic 
tapping device was developed by co-authors in Brantberg et 
al.21 As far as we are aware, this device was only used as a 
research tool, possibly because of the high-emitted sound as 
the patients and test personnel had to wear ear protection. 
A more standardized automatic skull-tapping setup was 
developed later based on the electrodynamic moving coil 
type of transducer (B&K Minishaker 4810; Brüel and Kjær, 
Denmark).22
While AC sound administered via an earplug in the ear 
canal is fairly effective for evoking VEMP
, sound levels as 
high as 130–145 dB peak sound pressure level reference 
20 μPa (SPL) are reported to be needed for short clicks of 
0.1 ms duration in order to evoke clinically useful cVEMP 
response.13,16,17 Such sound levels appear to be uncomfortably 
high and imply a risk of causing at least a temporary cochlear 
damage23 or even persistent hearing loss.24 In the present study, 
tone bursts have been used instead of click sounds as they have 
been shown to evoke a stronger response in VEMP using BC 
stimulation.25 The risk of hearing damage might also generally 
be less when using a burst sound rather than a click sound.26
Using BC stimulation, it remains a challenge to provide 
a sufficiently strong mechanical stimulation to be clinically 
used in a rather simple way. The conventional BC transducer 
Radioear B71, initially developed for audiometric hearing 
investigations, has been used in both human studies27 and in 
animal models.19,28 While the B71 can evoke cVEMP at 500 
Hz, it often fails at lower frequencies and in oVEMP due to 
low power output.29 As the B71 does suffer from both poor 
power output and from high distortion at low frequencies, 
it has been improved by a newer design, the Radioear B81, 
which is based on the “balanced electromagnetic separa-
tion transducer” principle invented by Håkansson,9 offer-
ing a higher force output and lower distortion.10 Previous 
VEMP studies have also proposed reducing the stimulation 
frequency in VEMP from 500 to 250 Hz and even down to 
100 Hz with the reservation that, at the lowest frequencies, 
response peaks without vestibular origin may show up.30,31
It has been shown that the Minishaker B&K 4810 is 
capable of evoking oVEMP at the forehead down to 100 
Hz,18,22,30,31 but the drawback is its size and the fact that it 
must be held and attached manually. It should be noted that 
the Minishaker weighs ~1.1 kg, which is almost 30 times 
more than the B250 and the B81. Due to this reason, it will 
be difficult to apply the Minishaker with a stand-alone steel 
spring arrangement.
A new transducer element has now been developed, which 
is based on the B81 design, but is currently only available 
as a prototype called the B250. This device is slightly larger 
than the B81 and has a lower resonance frequency, placed at 
250 Hz instead of 450 Hz, as seen in Figure 1A and B. The 
considerably larger Minishaker B&K 4810, which is based 
on the moving coil principle allowing larger deflections, is 
also included for comparative purposes (Figure 1).

VEMP using a new low-frequency bone conduction transducer
Obviously, there are already several stimulation options 
for providing BC stimuli as an alternative to AC, but it would 
be desirable if one and the same method could be used in 
both cVEMP and oVEMP
. This is one of the reasons why 
the B250 transducer is proposed for VEMP investigations 
where the design is optimized for 250 Hz chosen as a com-
promise between size, output power, and desired stimulation 
frequency. In addition, this transducer has been designed with 
an electrical input impedance that is compatible with most 
commonly used hardware for vestibular testing.
This pilot study investigates the stimulation hearing level 
required to evoke robust VEMP responses from AC and BC 
at different stimulation attachments. Potential differences in 
the clinical interpretation of the VEMP responses, such as 
variability of asymmetry ratios, inhibitory/excitatory effects, 
vestibular source of the reflex, and vestibular labyrinth dis-
orders, will not be taken into account. The clinical value of 
using the B250 will be investigated in a future study that is 
currently in the planning phase.
The overall aim of this pilot study was to measure cVEMP 
and oVEMP responses, evoked by 250 and 500 Hz tone bursts 
at different stimulation levels, using two miniaturized BC 
transducers (B250 and Radioear B81) applied to the mastoid 
and the forehead, and using AC stimulation.
The results will be analyzed and evaluated in view of the 
following research questions:
1. Is there any difference in stimulation hearing level 
required to evoke VEMP with BC and AC stimuli?
2. Can at least three typical biphasic VEMP responses be 
obtained at increasing stimuli levels with present BC 
transducers and available output levels?
3. Is there any difference between ipsilateral and contralat-
eral stimulation level using BC at the mastoid?
Materials and methods
This is a pilot study based on three subjects: S1, 64 years 
(male); S2, 29 years (male); and S3, 28 years (female). All 
subjects are working in the hearing research group at Chalm-
ers University of Technology. None of the subjects has had a 
known history of chronic ear disease or vestibular disorder. 
Placement of electrodes and bone conducting transducers are 
shown in Figure 2. Conventional skin adhesive electrodes 
(Neotrode from ConMed, Utica, NY, USA) were attached after 
the skin surface was rubbed by Nuprep Skin Prep Gel (Weaver, 
Aurora, CO, USA). The skin impedance was checked and veri-
fied to be below 2 kΩ between each of the tests to confirm the 
stability of the contact between the electrodes and the skin.
In cVEMP
, the subjects were asked to tension the SCM 
to get a better electrode contact with the muscle by leaning 
to the opposite side and slightly bending the head forward. 
In oVEMP
, the subjects were asked to gaze straight forward 
but upward as much as possible. This is found to achieve the 
highest possible oVEMP response signals with a suggested 
explanation that the measuring electrode comes closer to the 
inferior oblique muscle and that there is an increase of tonic 
extraocular muscle activity.32 The EMG signal was monitored 
by visual power meter, and the subject was asked to con-
sciously keep the level at the meter’
s “green range” throughout 
the session, which is assumed to be sufficiently high.
A static pressure of ~10 N was applied by use of a stan-
dard audiometric steel spring arrangement with an exten-
sion (an adaptor adding 2 cm laterally of the B250 and B81 
Figure 1 (A) B250 and B81 vibration transducers as well as the B&K Minishaker 4810 (shown for comparative purposes) with their relative real size shown to the left and

housing to increase the spring force). Ten Newton is twice the 
value specified for audiometric BC testing and corresponds 
to a peak force of 140 dB re 1 μN. All generator signals and 
the signal processing of measured signal were provided by 
the Eclipse EP25 including the OtoAccess software with a 
VEMP module (Interacoustics A/S, Middelfart, Denmark). 
This software was recently updated (mid-2017) and now 
includes the possibility of using 250 Hz for the BC stimula-
tion; previously, the lowest frequency was 500 Hz.
Frequency responses of the B250 (prototype from Ortofon 
A/S) and the B81 are shown in Figure 1B. These frequency 
responses were measured with a driving rod with a surface 
diameter D=15 mm (175 mm2) for the B81 and D=20 mm 
(315 mm2) for the B250, and the graphs represent the dB 
output force level (OFL) at a fixed input voltage (1 Vrms) 
swept from 100 to 10 kHz. In repeated measurements, the 
response curves (Figure 1B) were almost identical.
In this study, only the frequencies 500 Hz (optimized 
for the B71/81) and 250 Hz (optimized in the BC250) were 
used. The stimulation signals comprised four cycles (shown 
in Figure 3A and B), having a total duration of 16 ms (250 
Hz) and 8 ms (500 Hz), respectively. In the signal processing, 
averaging of 300 sequences was performed and the stimula-
tion artifact was reduced by using alternating polarity; that 
is, subtraction of 180 degrees out of phase complementary 
registration.
Output levels of the transducers were calibrated on an 
artificial mastoid B&K 4930 in order to translate the stimu-
lation to dB normalized hearing level (nHL). This measure 
is used instead of dB HL to observe that these tone bursts 
are relatively short and can be considered as transient rather 
than continuous.
The OFLs are referred to as the reference equivalent 
threshold vibratory force levels (RETVFL) available from 
Figure 2 in cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), bipolar electrodes were placed: one at sternocleidomastoideus muscle (scM) and the reference was 
placed at the upper rim of the sternum, and the ground at the upper cheek (A and B). in ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP), bipolar electrodes were 
placed: one just beneath the eye over the inferior oblique muscle (iOM) and the reference ~2 cm below, whereas the ground was placed at the upper rim of sternum (C). 
Bone-conducting transducers were applied using a steel spring arrangement either to the mastoid (Fm) just behind the pinnae at the virtual line through the ear canal opening 
and lateral eye hook or at the forehead (Fz) on the midline just below the hairline (B and C). Written informed consent has been obtained from the person in these images

VEMP using a new low-frequency bone conduction transducer
ISO 389–31 and the electrical output from Eclipse was 
then referred to the dB nHL at which the VEMP responses 
were measured. At investigation frequencies (250 and 500 
Hz), the maximum force output level from the transducers, 
when driven at maximum output from the Eclipse hardware, 
was 75 dB nHL for B250 at both frequencies, whereas for 
B81, the maximum output was 65 and 85 dB nHL for 250 
and 500 Hz, respectively. The same calibration was made 
for the AC sound where stimulation peak sound levels (dB 
nHL) are referred to the peak levels corresponding to the 
dB HL threshold levels, taken from ISO 389–22 for insert 
earphones.
In AC and mastoid stimulation, a total of 72 measure-
ments were made: three subjects, three stimulation methods 
(B250, B81, and AC), two frequencies (250 and 500 Hz), 
cVEMP and oVEMP
, ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation 
(in BC, the transducer was moved from one side to the other 
keeping the electrodes in the same place). In oVEMP
, from 
the forehead midline/hairline Fz stimulation, a total of 12 
measurements were made: three subjects, two devices (B81 
and B250), two frequencies (250 and 500 Hz).
The graphs in Figure 4 are shown in order to define the 
biphasic characteristics of cVEMP and oVEMP responses 
in the present study. In cVEMP there is a first negative 
peak (“p1”) followed by a positive peak (“n1”) occurring at 
latencies of ~13 ms (“p13”) and 23 ms (“n23”) using click 
stimulus. In this example, the latencies are rather at 22 and 
32 ms, respectively, so obviously “p13” and “n13” should 
only be regarded as names not latencies. In oVEMP
, there is 
instead a first upward peak (n1) and a subsequent negative 
peak (p1) occurring at a latency of ~10 ms (“n10”) and 15 ms 
(“p15”) using click stimulus. In this example, the latencies 
are rather in the range of 23–26 and 30–32 ms, respectively. 
These latencies may vary considerably depending on stimuli 
levels, if the stimuli is provided by AC or BC, or if click or 
burst signals are used; therefore, they are just named as n1 
and p1 in this paper.
VEMP threshold levels were determined with the 
descending technique; that is, starting with the highest sound 
level and then decreased in 5 dB steps. The VEMP threshold 
is defined as the stimulus level in dB nHL where the n1–p1 
response has a peak-to-peak amplitude, at roughly expected 
latencies, that was at least two times larger than the overall 
noise variability in the signal. The noise peak-to-peak vari-
ability was ~10 μV in cVEMP and 1 μV in oVEMP responses, 
which is actually the scale division in Figure 4. A “viable” 
VEMP response is defined as that, at least three consecutive 
increasing stimulus amplitudes (5 dB steps) result in similar 
or increasing biphasic VEMP response amplitudes. Repeated 
measurements, with weeks in between, showed that the 
VEMP thresholds were very stable and the thresholds were 
found to be within ±5 dB which indicates a variability which 
is less than that in hearing threshold testing.
It is clear from Figure 4 that the cVEMP response ampli-
tudes are considerably higher than the oVEMP response 
by the different scales (10 vs 1 μV), and that the oVEMP 
responses are noisier. Generally, oVEMP responses are there-
fore more affected by stimuli artifacts. If the burst stimulus is 
too long, these artifacts may interfere with the first peak (n1) 
in the oVEMP response, and it was found that the 16 ms for

Notes: The stimuli artifact is substantially reduced by a cancelation technique using alternated stimulation polarity and was normally not even seen in the responses, except 
for using B81 in oVEMP.

the 250 Hz burst was just on the limit of such interference 
using the B81 with Fz stimuli.
The study was conducted in accordance with the prin-
ciples stated in the Declaration of Helsinki where applicable, 
and the test subjects, who are all research personnel in the 
field of BC, signed a written informed consent before enter-
ing the study. Participation in the study was voluntary and 
no remuneration was given to the test subjects. As this is 
a pilot study in a developmental phase, no formal ethical 
approval is required in Sweden (https://www.researchet-
hics.lu.se/research-ethics-information/ethical-review/
when-is-ethical-permission-required).
Results
The left and center columns of Figure 5 show typical cVEMP 
and oVEMP responses from mastoid stimulation (Fm) in 
two subjects (S1 and S3) in order to illustrate the difference 
in hearing level required to obtain viable VEMP responses 
using B250 and AC at 250 Hz. These results show that the 
B250 with the stimulus applied at the mastoid can evoke 
viable cVEMP and oVEMP responses at 250 Hz, at a lower 
hearing level than in AC (in these examples 30–40 dB lower). 
It can also be seen in the upper-center and upper-right panels 
of Figure 5 that the oVEMP responses from BC stimulation

resulted in the same threshold level with both ipsilateral and 
contralateral stimulation (within 2 dB among all subjects 
comparing average cVEMP and oVEMP thresholds for B250 
at 250 Hz in Table 1). This indicates that attenuation of BC 
sound between the left and right vestibular organs is close to 
0 dB for 250 Hz. Viable VEMP responses were also seen in 
responses at 500 Hz, but with lower peak-to-peak response 
amplitude levels for both the B250 and the B81.
All VEMP responses were similar in shape to those shown 
in Figure 5, and they are summarized in Table 1 by the thresh-
old values in dB nHL. The average lowering in hearing levels 
using B250 versus AC stimulation among all subjects in this 
study was 39 dB for oVEMP and 32 dB for cVEMP
, calculated 
from the average values in the right most column of Table 1. 
Altogether, these results indicate that cVEMP and oVEMP 
thresholds are generally reached at a considerably lower dB 
nHL stimulation for BC versus AC stimuli at 250 Hz. At 500 
Hz, this difference is smaller, and the oVEMP threshold is on 
average ~26 dB lower with B250 than with AC.
In Table 1, those conditions that were found viable (three 
biphasic VEMP responses with same or increasing amplitude 
levels) in all subjects are marked in green. Obviously, only the 
B250 at 250 Hz could obtain viable responses in all subjects 
for both cVEMP and oVEMP
, whereas AC could do that in

VEMP using a new low-frequency bone conduction transducer
one condition at 250 Hz (cVEMP with ipsilateral stimuli) 
and three conditions at 500 Hz (cVEMP with contralateral 
stimuli and oVEMP with both ipsilateral and contralateral 
stimuli). With the B81, a clinically viable response was only 
obtained for oVEMP with ipsilateral stimuli at 500 Hz.
Comparing B81 and B250 in Table 1 reveals no dramatic 
differences in threshold levels for cVEMP at either 250 or 
500 Hz. This is expected as the main differences for these two 
BC transducers are in the maximum output capability (shown 
in Table 1 under the transducer name in the “Stimulation” 
column). This finding is also in line with the assumption that 
the threshold at a certain frequency is evoked by the same 
level of mechanical stimulation independently of the trans-
ducer type and the frequency responses in Figure 1B. The 
differences in VEMP thresholds between the two transducers 
are <5 dB, on average, and may be related to intra-subject 
variability as the stimulation amplitudes are provided in 5 
dB steps. However, it was found in the calibration procedure 
that the B81 had considerably higher distortion at 250 Hz 
compared to the B250 when driven at the highest output level. 
This is because the resonance frequency is approximately 
twice the stimulation frequency in the B81, which means 
that the second harmonic component will be considerably 
more amplified than the fundamental. This may also explain 
why in cVEMP
, B81 had a lower VEMP threshold at 250 Hz 
than at 500 Hz, whereas the B250 did not show such a large 
difference between these two frequencies.
With B250, viable responses are obtained for all subjects 
at 250 Hz (green cells in Table 1); however, it fails at 500 Hz, 
whereas the situation is reversed for the B81 (even though 
B81 has only one green condition at 500 Hz). This is most 
likely due to the difference in resonance frequencies and 
higher maximum output of 85 versus 75 dB nHL in favor of 
the B81 at 500 Hz and the opposite 75 versus 65 dB nHL in 
favor of the B250 at 250 Hz. These limitations are set generi-
cally by the transducer design and the maximum output volt-
age from Eclipse. It also appears that the VEMP thresholds 
at 500 Hz (range 68–75 dB nHL) are notably higher than the 
corresponding thresholds at 250 Hz (range 57–60 dB nHL). 
In real physical terms, however, the thresholds at 500 Hz are 
more similar to those at 250 Hz, just more annoying at 500 
Hz, as the RETVFL at 250 Hz is 67 dB re 1 μN and at 500 
Hz is 58 dB re 1 μN; that is, they differ by 9 dB in absolute 
level the other way around.

The lower right panel of Figure 5 shows a viable oVEMP 
response from Fz midline forehead position for subject S3 
using the B250 at 250 Hz. Whereas the youngest subjects 
(S2 and S3) reached their thresholds from Fz in almost all 
conditions, the oldest subject (S1) did not reach threshold in 
any condition (Table 2). Obviously, if an oVEMP response 
from Fz is desired for any physiological reason, a transducer 
with stronger mechanical output is needed if viable responses 
should be obtained in all patents.
Discussion
general discussion of present results
This paper presents results obtained using a new and rela-
tively small prototype BC transducer that has been optimized 
for being driven at 250 Hz, and is hence called the B250. We 
have shown that the B250 has the potential to be used for 
both cVEMP and oVEMP measurements and is compatible 
with conventional commercially available vestibular testing 
equipment. We have also shown that a simple headband 
arrangement (standard steel spring with adaptor extension to 
increase the static force) can be used. This transducer attach-
ment to the skull bone was more pleasant to use and easy to 
apply with the B250 than with the B81, most likely because 
it has a larger contact area (315 vs 175 mm2) and because it is 
designed with a slight concave surface to better fit the mastoid 
bone. In this study, all stimulation levels are presented in dB 
nHL in order to compare the subjective experienced sound 
level; in view of that AC stimulation is known to require 
a relatively high stimulation level to evoke VEMP
. In this 
pilot study, it was found that the VEMP threshold could be 
reached at significantly lower levels with BC stimuli than 
with AC stimuli – an average of 39 dB lower using a stimu-
lation frequency of 250 Hz in oVEMP measurements. This 
is a remarkable improvement and it was much appreciated 
by the subjects in this study as all of them experienced that 
the AC stimulus was on the verge of being painful. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, transmission via AC to the vestibular organ 
is not optimized by nature like natural hearing via AC to the 
cochlea. This could explain why BC evokes VEMP responses 
at considerably lower hearing levels than AC.
Apart from comfort and sound level aspects, another 
driving force for doing VEMP investigations by using BC 
stimulation is that patients who have a suspected or con-
firmed conductive hearing loss could also be investigated. 
This study indicates that the B250 offers such a possibility, 
but a future study on patients with conductive hearing loss 
has been planned for confirmation.
It was also seen that the B250 emitted less electromag-
netic radiation than the B81 (which is indeed known to be 
better than the B71 in this respect). Less electromagnetic 
radiation originates from the balanced transducer principle 
and the more shielding inherent with the design of the B250. 
A reduction of the electromagnetic radiation artifacts is an 
advantage not only for VEMP but also for auditory brain-
stem response measurements which will be the subject of a 
future study.
In summary, this pilot study indicates that the B250 can 
take the VEMP investigations to a new level and possibly 
form the basis for a standardized procedure. First, however, 
present pilot results must be confirmed in extended clini-
cal studies to verify normative data (thresholds, latencies, 
etc) on a larger group of normal subjects and to evaluate 
the diagnostic value in different patient groups. Interesting 
patient groups for future clinical studies are patients with 
unilateral vestibular dysfunction (such as vestibular Schwan-
noma patients) and patients with superior semicircular canal 
dehiscence.
Other differences between ac and Bc 
stimulation in 
VEMP investigations
As mentioned above, there are several reasons why AC is 
not optimal in VEMP investigations, the most important are 
the high sound levels needed and the fact that VEMP can-
not be used in patients with significant conductive hearing 
loss. These issues could be solved by a BC stimulus, which 
leads to the question of what else differs between these two 
modalities.
In this discussion, we disregard neuro-physiological 
aspects, such as from where in the vestibular organ the reflex 
originates and which neuro-muscular transmission branches 
are involved. We also assume that the cVEMP response is 
mainly affecting the SCM on the ipsilateral side, whereas 
the oVEMP is mainly caused by a crossover effect; that 
is, stimulations of the ipsilateral vestibular organ will give 
a response in the contralateral IOM. Figure 6 illustrates

VEMP using a new low-frequency bone conduction transducer
these main vibration-evoked, neuro-muscular transmission 
branches for AC and BC stimulation.
It might be expected that using AC will involve some 
cross-talk to ipsilateral IOM in oVEMP as subject 3 had same 
threshold for both contralateral and ipsilateral stimulation at 
250 Hz, and all subjects had almost the same threshold at 
500 Hz (this cross-talk is not shown in Figure 6). Without 
going into neurophysiological explanations, we just want to 
point out that this cross-talk effect from AC stimuli could 
also have BC origin. It is well known from audiology that an 
aerial sound in the ear canal and middle ear will cross over 
to the contralateral cochlea with a damping of 40–80 dB,33 
depending on conditions. This is the reason why masking is 
needed in hearing threshold testing in patients with asym-
metric hearing loss >40 dB. Therefore, it could also be that 
AC sound used in VEMP investigations can induce BC sound 
that is transmitted to the vestibular organ on the contralateral 
side, which in turn activates the ipsilateral IOM. The high 
acousto-mechanical transcranial damping (40–80 dB) can be 
compensated by a similar higher sensitivity for BC sound to 
evoke the reflex (39 dB in this study).
We also found that the attenuation between vestibular 
organs for BC was almost zero at 250 Hz. Others have 
reported similar results in investigating the transcranial 
attenuation for BC sound between the cochleae and found 
it to be in the range of 0–5 dB at 250 Hz.34,35 This fact may 
simplify the BC-VEMP procedure, as the BC transducer 
only needs to be applied to one side, whereas in AC-VEMP 
the speaker must be applied to both sides. To include all four 
identified neuro-muscular reflex branches, electrodes must 
be applied to all four muscles involved for both AC and BC 
stimulation, as also shown in Figure 6.
From the discussion here, without considering detailed 
neurophysiological aspects, it is hard to see why VEMP using 
BC stimuli should not have the same potential to reveal patho-
logical differences in the neurological–myogenic pathways 
as from using AC stimuli. In addition, VEMP response levels 
in small children might be lower due to improper tension 
of SCM and less gazing upward to expose IOM, and thus 
BC-VEMP would give a better response signal, be more 
comfortable, and expose the child to less hearing hazard.
stimulation at the forehead, Fz
Using Fz stimulation instead of mastoid stimulation might 
raise some BC aspects that need to be considered. Below the 
free resonance frequencies of the human skull (<~800 Hz), 
the skull behaves like a rigid body with the understanding that 
no external forces are connected. This was already pointed out 
by von Békésy36 and later confirmed by  others; for example, 
Håkansson et al37 and Stenfelt and Goode.4 Sometimes this 
finding is mistakenly interpreted as meaning that all parts of 
the skull move like rigid body at low frequencies and also 
when a driving force is connected. When stimulated by an 
external force at lower frequencies, attached to the skull in a 
point like Fz or to the mastoids behind the ear, not only the 
skin but also the skull bone flexes at or near the attachment 
point. The forced response is different from a free response 
as it manifests itself by a dominant low-frequency anti-reso-
nance in the mechanical impedance at the attachment point.37 
This indicates that the skull, besides translational stiff solid 
body behavior, also has a compliance that changes/deforms 
the skull geometry already at low-frequency impacts. This 
also implies that the left and right vestibular labyrinths will 
move slightly differently when a low-frequency vibration or 
impact is applied to the mastoid, as compared to when the 
stimulation is applied to the Fz or the vertex.
Figure 7 shows that an inward stimulating force is applied 
to the midline Fz or the vertex, compressing the top portion 
Figure 6 Using Bc stimuli, the vibration reaches the right (VR) and the left (Vl) vestibular organ by approximately the same intensity at frequencies around 250 hz. 
Notes: Therefore, Bc stimuli only needs to be applied from one side (BcR), whereas with ac stimuli it must be applied from both sides (acR and acl) in order to evoke 
cVEMP response in both cervical muscles (scMR and scMl) or to evoke oVEMP in both orbital muscles (iOMR and iOMl).

håkansson et al
and expanding the middle portion, thus causing the vestibular 
labyrinths on both sides to move laterally at the same time. 
This also means that the vestibular labyrinths are stimulated 
with the same amplitude but asymmetrical 180 degrees out 
of phase (see red arrows in Figure 7A). On the other hand, 
if an external impact is applied to the mastoid (Fm), both 
vestibular labyrinths are moving in the same translational 
direction mainly in phase possibly with a short delay and 
minor rotational component. These phase differences between 
accelerations of the vestibular organs with Fz and Fm stimuli, 
respectively, were also confirmed by Westin and Brantberg,22 
who also noted that the same force input level resulted in a five 
times higher lateral (interaural) acceleration if the stimulus 
was applied to the mastoids as compared to the vertex. This is 
understandable as a stimulation of the vestibular organ from 
the vertex or the Fz position relies mainly on the deformation 
of the superior part of the skull bone as the inferior part of the 
skull (the skull base) is relatively stiff in the superior–inferior 
direction due to the more or less rigid attachment to the stiff 
spinal column. In mastoid stimulation, on the other hand, the 
whole skull is fairly mobile in the lateral–medial direction, 
giving higher accelerations for a given stimulation force level 
Fm as compared to Fz, and includes both a deformation and a 
translational movement of the skull, as indicated in Figure 7.
It seems that VEMP responses from mastoid excitation 
are more natural in terms of how a postural position is nor-
mally restored after a lateral disturbance as developed by 
evolution. Events similar to Fz stimulation, caused by the 
out of phase motion of the vestibular organ, seem to be rare 
in real life and may thereby not evoke a strong response. 
However, this does not mean that Fz or vertex stimulation 
does not have a special clinical value as some neural disor-
ders may show up in Fz stimulation that is not shown in Fm 
(mastoid) stimulation, but we are not aware of any such cases. 
More clinical studies are needed before the Fz stimulation 
can be regarded as obsolete, but its potential exclusion and 
replacement by mastoid Fm stimulation would considerably 
simplify the procedures, as a bulky moving coil transducer 
like the B&K 4810 would not be needed.
Optimum stimulation frequency for 
VEMP 
investigations
Another interesting question concerns the stimuli. We believe 
the impulsive short clicks should be avoided due to hazardous 
hearing risks and because they also suffer from low signal-
to-noise ratio in the response. In early VEMP investigations, 
burst signals were used with frequencies from 500 Hz and 
upwards. When BC-VEMP was introduced, it seemed that 
500 Hz was the most popular frequency. This was most likely 
related to that resonance frequency of the Radioear B71, 
and later the B81, have their main resonance frequency in 
that frequency region. Lower stimulation frequencies were 
practically excluded due to the poor performance of these 
transducers below the resonance frequency. However, later 
studies using the B&K 4810 Minishaker indicate that lower 
frequencies can be advantageous in oVEMP when sufficient 
vibration power is generated. The most effective frequency 
for utricular activation is reported to be as low as 100 Hz, 
but still no consensus is available regarding the most optimal 
frequency.18,22
Stimulation at 100–125 Hz most likely requires a trans-
ducer of moving coil type in order to allow for larger deflec-
tions than in variable reluctance type transducers, such as 
those in B71 and B81 the maximum deflection of which is 
considerably lower and limited by relative small air gaps.10 In 
the present study, a prototype transducer B250 was developed 
with a resonance frequency of 250 Hz optimized for 250 Hz 
stimulation. The 250 Hz resonance frequency was chosen 
as a compromise between the frequently used frequency of 
500 Hz in cVEMP
, suitable for the B71/81, and 100–125 Hz 
suitable for the B&K 4810 Minishaker in oVEMP
. Lower-
ing the resonance frequency of the B250 even further is 
another viable option but that would require a considerably 
bigger transducer size, given that the resonance frequency is 
inversely proportional to the square root of the counter-weight 
mass.9 The choice of 250 Hz for the B250 was made not only 
because it allows for a reasonable size of the transducer but 
also because 250 Hz is one of the commonly used octave 
Figure 7 a simplistic view of how the skull deforms after a low-frequency impact 
from midline Fz (or vertex) and from the mastoid Fm. 
Notes: it is important to consider that the skull rests on the spinal column (sc), 
which is quite stiff in the superior–inferior direction. The response movement/
acceleration of the vestibular labyrinth (solid circle in rest and gray circles after 
impact peak, assuming no delay between sides) will be out of phase with stimulation 
at Fz and mainly in phase with stimulation at Fm (impacts indicated by the wide red 
arrows and thin red arrows showing vestibular labyrinth motion direction). The 
acceleration response with stimulation at Fm may have a short time delay of <1 ms 
between vestibular motions ipsilateral versus contralateral side.

VEMP using a new low-frequency bone conduction transducer
frequencies in audiometry where B71/B81 transducers have 
some limitations and where the B250 might be a better future 
alternative for audiometric testing.
Conclusions
In this pilot study, where the results are indicative, it was 
found that:
1. VEMP thresholds were reached at a considerably lower 
hearing level with BC stimulation than with AC stimu-
lation – as much as 30–40 dB lower. Therefore, using 
BC stimulation in VEMP investigations may be more 
comfortable for the patient and expose the patient to a 
reduced hearing hazard.
2. cVEMP and oVEMP responses were evoked at three or 
more stimulation levels in all subjects, and all conditions 
were tested with a 250 Hz burst signal and using the proto-
type B250 transducer applied with a steel spring arrange-
ment to one of the mastoids. It was noted that the B81 and 
AC stimuli performed better at 500 Hz than at 250 Hz, 
although viable responses were not obtained in all subjects.
3. It was found that ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation 
levels using BC at the mastoid were almost the same at 
250 Hz. This indicates that both vestibular organs can be 
stimulated from only one of the mastoids in order to get 
viable cVEMP and oVEMP responses on both sides.
4. Forehead stimulation Fz did not evoke oVEMP response 
in all subjects with the B81/B250, possibly because of an 
unfavorable BC transmission to the vestibular organ. If 
Fz stimulation is deemed clinically necessary, this may 
necessitate a stronger device, such as B&K 4810, driven 
at a frequency below 250 Hz.
Using BC, these results indicate that patients having a 
significant BC hearing loss can also be investigated with 
VEMP
. We believe that the results in this pilot study indicate 
the potential of using BC in VEMP investigations; however, 
future clinical studies are needed in order to confirm these 
results and evaluate the clinical value.
