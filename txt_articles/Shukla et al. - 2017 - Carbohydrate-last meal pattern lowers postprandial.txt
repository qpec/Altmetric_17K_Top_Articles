Background There are limited data regarding the timing 
of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal and postprandial 
glucose regulation.
Methods Sixteen subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) consumed the same meal on 3 days in random 
order: carbohydrate first, followed 10 min later by protein 
and vegetables; protein and vegetables first, followed 
10 min later by carbohydrate; or all components together. 
Blood was sampled for glucose, insulin, glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucagon measurements at 
baseline (just before meal ingestion) and subsequently at 
30 min intervals up to 180 min.
Results The incremental areas under the curve for 
glucose (iAUC0–180) and incremental glucose peaks were 
53% and 54% lower, respectively, when carbohydrate 
was consumed last compared with carbohydrate 
consumed first (3124.7±501.2 vs 6703.5±904.6 mg/
dL×180min, p<0.001; 34.7±4.1 vs 75.0±6.5 mg/
dL, p<0.001) and 44% and 40% lower, respectively, 
compared with the all components together condition 
(3124.7±501.2 vs 5587.1±828.7 mg/dL×180min, 
p=0.003; 34.7±4.1 vs 58.2±5.9 mg/dL, p<0.001). 
Postprandial insulin excursions were lower (iAUC0–180: 
7354.1±897.3 vs 9769.7±1002.1 µU/mL×min, p=0.003) 
and GLP-1 excursions higher (iAUC0–180: 3487.56±327.7 
vs 2519.11±494.8 pg/mL×min, p=0.019) following the 
carbohydrate-last meal order compared with carbohydrate 
first.
Conclusion The carbohydrate-last meal pattern may be 
an effective behavioral strategy to improve postprandial 
glycemia.
Postprandial hyperglycemia is an indepen-
dent risk factor for both macrovascular1 
and microvascular2 complications of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is the major 
determinant of glucose control at glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) values below 7.3%.3 
Current nutritional strategies to attenuate 
postprandial glucose excursions are based 
on the quantity and type of carbohydrate 
consumed as the primary predictors of 
glycemic response. Beyond carbohydrate type 
and amount, postmeal glucose excursions can 
be attenuated by fat and protein preloads4–7 
and by a modified macronutrient composi-
tion that includes more protein8 and dietary 
fiber.9
A study in eight subjects with T2DM demon-
strated that whey protein consumed before a 
carbohydrate meal can stimulate insulin and 
incretin hormone secretion and slow gastric 
emptying, leading to marked reduction in 
postprandial glycemia.6 These findings were

Original research
significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Limited data on nutrient order during a meal 
suggests that consuming carbohydrate last lowers 
postprandial glucose excursions compared to 
carbohydrate consumed first. Protein preload 
stimulates insulin and incretin hormone secretion 
resulting in a lower postprandial glucose response.
What are the new findings?
 
► The carbohydrate-last meal pattern reduced 
postprandial glucose excursions compared 
to consuming carbohydrate first or all meal 
components together.
 
► In contrast to protein preloads, the carbohydrate-
last meal pattern lead to lower glycemic and insulin 
excursions but higher glucagon-like peptide-1 
response.
Current research questions?
 
► Generalizability to meals with different 
macronutrient composition and different subsets of 
patients, for example, Type 1, prediabetes
 
► Effect of the sequence of nutrient ingestion on 
gastric emptying and rates of nutrient absorption
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
 
► The carbohydrate-last meal pattern may be 
an effective behavioral strategy to improve 
postprandial glucose control in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus; feasibility and effectiveness need 
to be assessed in prospective studies.

confirmed in a subsequent study of 15 subjects that 
showed a 28% reduction in postprandial glucose excur-
sions over 180 min that was accompanied by an increase in 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin responses.7 
The addition of whey to meals with rapidly digested and 
absorbed carbohydrates has also been shown to stimulate 
insulin release and reduce postprandial blood glucose 
excursion by 21% after a lunch meal consisting of mashed 
potatoes and meatballs in subjects with T2DM.4
There are limited data, however, regarding the impact 
of the temporal sequence of carbohydrate ingestion 
during a meal on postprandial glycemia.10 11 In a previous 
pilot study of 11 patients with metformin-treated T2DM, 
we demonstrated that ingestion of protein and vegetables 
before carbohydrate led to lower postprandial glucose 
and insulin excursions for 120 min, compared with 
eating the same foods in the reverse order.11 No study 
has investigated the effects of the timing of carbohydrate 
ingestion during a meal on postprandial glucose, insulin 
and incretin hormone excursions.
The aim of this study was to determine the optimal 
timing of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal that can 
lower postprandial glycemia in the setting of three real-
world meal conditions and additionally explore the effect 
of food order on insulin and incretin hormone excur-
sions. We postulated that consuming vegetables and 
protein together as the first course instead of carbohy-
drate would result in lower post-meal glucose excursions 
compared with the reverse order and consuming all meal 
components (protein, vegetables and carbohydrate) all 
together would result in intermediate effects.
ReseaRCH design and MeTHods
subject inclusion and exclusion criteria
Male and female participants between 35 and 65 years of 
age, body mass index (BMI) 25–40 kg/m2 and metform-
in-treated T2DM of less than 10 years duration with 
HbA1c ≤8% were included in the study.
Patients taking corticosteroids, antidiabetic medica-
tion other than metformin, and patients with chronic 
renal or hepatic disease or history of prior bariatric 
surgery were excluded. The study was approved by the 
Weill Cornell Medical College Institutional Review 
Board (IRB#1502015945). All participants gave written 
informed consent.
study protocol
We used a crossover design in which all participants 
consumed isocaloric meals (table 1) of the same compo-
sition on three separate days, 1 week apart, after a 
12 hours overnight fast. Participants were instructed to 
maintain their usual level of physical activity and diet 
throughout the study period and in particular the day 
prior to each test session. All meals were prepared in 
the metabolic kitchen of the Clinical and Translational 
Science Center at Weill Cornell Medical College. Each 
meal was consumed in 30 min, under the following 
conditions that were randomly assigned using research 
randomizer:
1. Carbohydrate first (CF) (ciabatta bread and orange 
juice) over 10 min, a 10 min rest interval, and 
then protein (skinless grilled chicken breast) and 
vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber with 
Italian vinaigrette) over 10 min.
2. Protein and vegetables first over 10 min, a 10 min rest 
interval, and then carbohydrate over 10 min (carbo-
hydrate last (CL)).
3. All meal components together as a sandwich with each 
half consumed with half the orange juice over 10 min 
and a 10 min interval in between (sandwich (S)).
Participants were closely monitored to ensure that 
all meals were consumed in their entirety within the 
allotted time. Blood samples were drawn from an 
in-dwelling venous cannula at baseline (just before 
meal ingestion) and at 30 min intervals up to 180 min 
after the start of the meal. Glucose concentrations were 
assessed in whole blood using a quantitative enzymatic 
photometry cassette from Alere (San Diego, California, 
USA). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of 
variation are ≤6.2% and≤5.0%, respectively. The plasma 
concentrations of insulin and glucagon were deter-
mined using quantitative immunoradiometric assay 
kits from Millipore (St. Charles, Missouri, USA). The 
intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation are 
≤4.4% and ≤6.0% for insulin and ≤4.8% and≤6.4% 
for glucagon, respectively. The measurement range is 
3.125–200.0 µU/mL for insulin and 4.7–150 pmol/L for 
glucagon. The plasma concentration of active GLP-1 was 
determined using an electrochemiluminescent assay 
kit from Meso Scale Diagnostics (Rockville, Maryland, 
USA) with collection of blood samples in the BD P800 
blood collection tube containing a proprietary cocktail 
of protease, esterase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhib-
itors which provides immediate protection of bioactive 
peptides from degradation in plasma. The intra-assay 
and inter-assay coefficients of variation are ≤11.2% and 
≤13.4%, respectively, and the measurement range is 
0.24–1000 pg/mL.

statistical analysis
Demographics for participants were described as 
mean±SD. Glucose, insulin, iGLP-1 and glucagon concen-
trations (at time intervals of interest) and their respective 
incremental areas under the curves (iAUCs) at 180 min 
were described as mean±SEM for each group. Incre-
mental glucose peaks were also described as mean±SEM. 
Linear mixed effects models accounting for correla-
tion within the same participant were implemented for 
each outcome of interest to compare the three groups. 
Post-hoc analyses were performed by Tukey's method 
with Bonferroni adjustment. p Values were two-sided with 
statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 alpha level or 
the Bonferroni-corrected 0.05 alpha level, where appli-
cable. Analyses were performed in R V.3.4.0 (Vienna, 
Austria).
ResulTs
The study population included 16 participants with 
overweight/obesity (nine female and seven male) 
with T2DM on a stable dose of metformin. The 
average (mean±SD) age and BMI were 57.7±7.6 years 
and 32.8±3.3 kg/m2, respectively. The average duration 
of diabetes among the participants was 3.8±2.4 years 
and the mean HbA1c was 6.5%±0.7%. One participant 
did not have sandwich data; however, this participant 
was not lost in analyses because mixed effects models 
handle missing values by maximum likelihood estima-
tion and are robust to missing random data. However, 
sensitivity analyses by excluding this participant did not 
change the significance of results.
There were no differences between baseline fasting 
glucose concentrations in the three meal conditions. 
Postprandial mean glucose concentrations were signifi-
cantly decreased by 20.8%, 30.2%, and 23.1% at 30, 60, 
and 90 min (figure 1), respectively, and the iAUC0–180 
was 53.4% lower (3124.7±501.2 vs 6703.5±904.6 mg/
dL×180 min, p<0.001) following the CL meal order, 
compared with CF, the reverse meal order (table 2). 
CL meal pattern showed reduced postprandial glucose 
levels compared with the S meal pattern: a decrease of 
19.8%, 25.2%, and 15.3% at 30, 60, and 90 min, respec-
tively, and a decrease in iAUC0–180 of 44.1% (3124.7±501.2 
vs 5587.1±828.7 mg/dL×180 min, p=0.003). Following 
the CL meal order, glucose levels plateaued between 
90 and 180 min postprandially, whereas, there were 
marked fluctuations in glucose concentrations in the 
CF meal condition, with the glucose level being signifi-
cantly lower than CL at 180 min. Incremental glucose 
peaks were 53.8% and 40.4% lower for the CL meal 
order compared with CF and S, respectively (34.7±4.1 
vs 75.0±6.5 mg/dL, p<0.001; 34.7±4.1 vs 58.2±5.9 mg/
dL, p<0.001) and 22.4% lower for S compared with 
CF (58.2±5.9 mg/dL vs 75.0±6.5 mg/dL, p<0.001).
The CL meal resulted in lower insulin excur-
sions; iAUC0–180 was 24.8% lower compared with CF 
(7354.1±897.3 vs 9769.7±1002.1 µU/mL×180 min, 
p=0.003). The insulin excursions were not signifi-
cantly different between the CF and S meal condi-
tions (7354.1±897.3 vs 8861.2±1050.5 µU/mL×180 min, 
p=0.137). The GLP-1 response to the CL meal order 
was 
greater 
compared 
with 
CF 
(3487.56±327.7 
vs 2519.11±494.8 pg/mL×180 min, p=0.019) and 
similar to the S meal condition (3487.56±327.7 vs 
3153.2±449.4 pg/mL×180 min, p=0.999). The glucagon 
excursions were not significantly different between the 
three meal conditions.

ConClusions
In this study, we demonstrated that the temporal sequence 
of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal has significant 
impact on postprandial glucose regulation. These find-
ings confirm and extend results from our previous pilot 
study11; the inclusion of a third nutrient order condition, 
a sandwich, had intermediate effects on glucose excur-
sions compared with CL versus CF.
Previous studies investigating the effect of premeal 
ingestion of whey protein have demonstrated that the 
glucose-lowering effect is accompanied by an insuli-
notropic response.6 7 In contrast, our results demon-
strate that consumption of protein and vegetables first, 
followed by carbohydrate, reduces both postmeal glucose 
and insulin excursions, suggesting that the CL meal 
pattern requires less insulin controlling for carbohydrate 
amount.
Modifying the rate of nutrient absorption is a ther-
apeutic principle of particular relevance to diabetes. 
A plausible explanation for the attenuated glycemic 
response observed with the CL meal pattern is delayed 
gastric emptying and consequently slower rates of carbo-
hydrate absorption, a mechanism that would not be 
entirely mediated by GLP-1. The finding of lower insulin 
iAUC in the context of increased GLP-1 excursions 
contrasts with the effect of protein preloads that augment 
both GLP-1 and insulin secretion6 7 12 and suggests a role 
for vegetable fiber in moderating this response.
The effect of food order on postprandial glycemia 
in this study is comparable to the magnitude observed 
with pharmacological agents that preferentially target 
postprandial glycemia; acarbose and nateglinide reduce 
iAUCs by 31% and 64%, respectively, compared with 
placebo.13 14 In non-insulin treated patients, managed 
with diet/oral hypoglycemic agents, pramlintide was 
shown to lower glucose excursions by 57%.15 Limitations 
of our study include the small sample size and unclear 
generalizability to meals with different macronutrient 
compositions and patient populations including those 
with type 1 diabetes and prediabetes. Further study is 
needed to explore the mechanisms, including gastric 
emptying and rates of nutrient absorption with extended 
follow-up beyond 180 min. Strengths of the study include 
stringent study design and the use of real-world meals 
that suggest practical utility. In conclusion, our findings 
suggest that the timing of carbohydrate intake during 
a meal may have major effects on postprandial glucose 
excursions comparable in magnitude to many hypogly-
cemic drugs.
