Abstract
Background
Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in patients aged 1–46 y. Severely injured
patients experience considerable blood loss and hemorrhagic shock requiring treatment
with massive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). Preclinical and retrospective human
studies in trauma patients have suggested that poorer therapeutic efficacy, increased sever-
ity of organ injury, and increased bacterial infection are associated with transfusion of large
volumes of stored RBCs, although the mechanisms are not fully understood.
Methods and findings
We developed a murine model of trauma hemorrhage (TH) followed by resuscitation with
plasma and leukoreduced RBCs (in a 1:1 ratio) that were banked for 0 (fresh) or 14 (stored)
days. Two days later, lungs were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa K-strain (PAK).
Resuscitation with stored RBCs significantly increased the severity of lung injury caused by
P. aeruginosa, as demonstrated by higher mortality (median survival 35 h for fresh RBC
group and 8 h for stored RBC group; p < 0.001), increased pulmonary edema (mean [95%
CI] 106.4 μl [88.5–124.3] for fresh RBCs and 192.5 μl [140.9–244.0] for stored RBCs; p =
0.003), and higher bacterial numbers in the lung (mean [95% CI] 1.2 × 107 [−1.0 × 107 to 2.5
× 107] for fresh RBCs and 3.6 × 107 [2.5 × 107 to 4.7 × 107] for stored RBCs; p = 0.014). The
mechanism underlying this increased infection susceptibility and severity was free-heme-
dependent, as recombinant hemopexin or pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of

 toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) during TH and resuscitation completely prevented P. aeruginosa–
induced mortality after stored RBC transfusion (p < 0.001 for all groups relative to stored
RBC group). Evidence from studies transfusing fresh and stored RBCs mixed with stored
and fresh RBC supernatants, respectively, indicated that heme arising both during storage
and from RBC hemolysis post-resuscitation plays a role in increased mortality after PAK (p
< 0.001). Heme also increased endothelial permeability and inhibited macrophage-depen-
dent phagocytosis in cultured cells. Stored RBCs also increased circulating high mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1; mean [95% CI] 15.4 ng/ml [6.7–24.0] for fresh RBCs and 50.3 ng/ml
[12.3–88.2] for stored RBCs), and anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody protected against PAK-
induced mortality in vivo (p = 0.001) and restored macrophage-dependent phagocytosis of
P. aeruginosa in vitro. Finally, we showed that TH patients, admitted to the University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham ER between 1 January 2015 and 30 April 2016 (n = 50), received high
micromolar–millimolar levels of heme proportional to the number of units transfused, suffi-
cient to overwhelm endogenous hemopexin levels early after TH and resuscitation. Limita-
tions of the study include lack of assessment of temporal changes in different products of
hemolysis after resuscitation and the small sample size precluding testing of associations
between heme levels and adverse outcomes in resuscitated TH patients.
Conclusions
We provide evidence that large volume resuscitation with stored blood, compared to fresh
blood, in mice increases mortality from subsequent pneumonia, which occurs via mecha-
nisms sensitive to hemopexin and TLR4 and HMGB1 inhibition.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Trauma hemorrhage patients receive high-volume resuscitations of stored red blood
cells (RBCs), but whether transfusion with older, compared to fresher, stored RBCs is
safe remains unclear.
• Retrospective analyses of clinical data indicate that adverse effects associated with trans-
fusion of older stored RBCs to trauma hemorrhage patients include increased risk for
nosocomial infections and mortality, but potential mechanisms underlying these associ-
ations are poorly understood.
• Our goal was to determine the mechanistic basis linking older stored RBC transfusions
and bacterial pneumonia after hemorrhagic shock, which, if elucidated, may reveal new
approaches to improve the safety of stored RBC transfusions.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used a murine model of trauma hemorrhage with transfusion of fresh or stored

 resuscitation; indices pertinent to assessing severity of bacterial pneumonia were
measured.
• We found that mice that received stored RBCs were significantly more susceptible to
P. aeruginosa–induced lung leak and death compared to mice that received fresh RBCs,
with a central role for free heme suggested by the protection afforded by administration
of hemopexin at the time of resuscitation.
• Using in vivo and cell-culture studies, we found that free heme mediates the increased
severity of bacterial pneumonia after trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation with stored
RBCs, via TLR4- and HMGB1-dependent mechanisms of increased endothelial perme-
ability and decreased macrophage-dependent bacterial clearance.
What do these findings mean?
• These data suggest that free heme is a key player in adverse effects associated with stored
RBC transfusion after trauma hemorrhage.
• These data suggest strategies to limit heme exposure or enhance endogenous mecha-
nisms to prevent heme toxicity, which may improve the safety of stored RBC
transfusions.
Introduction
Transfusion with stored red blood cells (RBCs) is an integral component of resuscitation strat-
egies for a number of clinical scenarios. Currently in the United States, RBCs stored for up to
42 d are approved for transfusion. However, several recent studies have raised questions sur-
rounding whether, even for RBCs below the 42-d threshold, transfusion with older compared
to younger RBCs is therapeutically efficacious and, more importantly, safe [1]. Specifically, the
majority of these analyses report that transfusion of older compared to younger RBCs is associ-
ated with adverse effects [2–12] in acute critical illness and surgery. In contrast, recent data
from prospective clinical studies indicate that there is no difference in outcome between trans-
fusion with younger and older RBCs in cardiac surgery and critically ill patients [13–16]. How-
ever, in these studies, patients were not receiving blood transfusions for hemorrhagic shock,
and “older” RBCs were those stored for 20–26 d, precluding assessment of potential effects of
RBCs stored for longer periods. This is important as many of the changes in stored RBCs,
including in-bag hemolysis and extravascular hemolysis (monocyte/macrophage-dependent
clearance of RBCs) post-transfusion increase significantly during the last week of storage [17–
19]. Additionally, recent retrospective analyses of clinical data indicate adverse effects in high-
risk patients with RBCs stored for >35 d [20]. Moreover, most studies do not address any RBC
dose–response effects that would normally be associated with patients receiving massive trans-
fusion. Our previous studies have shown increased risk for adverse effects in trauma hemor-
rhage (TH) patients as a function of both RBC storage age and the number of RBCs transfused
[21].
TH is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients aged 1–46 y. Severely trauma-
tized patients are often in hemorrhagic shock and thus require massive blood transfusion.
These patients may receive the oldest RBCs available in order to avoid wastage. Our previous

 studies have shown that the ability of transfused RBCs to improve microcirculatory function
and tissue oxygenation in trauma patients progressively diminishes with RBC storage age
[22]. Storage of RBCs is accompanied by biochemical and morphological changes referred
to as “storage lesion.” Key amongst these changes are hemolysis and release of free and micro-
vesicle-associated hemoglobin, free heme, and iron [23–25]. Transfusion of these molecular
species increases oxidative stress, inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, results in a pro-inflam-
matory state, and provides substrate (low molecular weight iron) for microbial growth
[17,18,26–39]. Additionally, a recent review showed that of 15 clinical retrospective studies
evaluating RBC transfusion in trauma patients between 1999 and 2013, all but 1 reported
adverse effects of older stored RBCs [40]. Retrospective analyses also demonstrate positive
associations between the storage age and number of RBC units transfused and increased end
organ injury, nosocomial infections, and mortality [11,21,22,41–43].
In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying increased risk for nosocomial infec-
tion in the setting of TH and massive transfusion with younger versus older stored RBCs and
specifically tested the hypothesis that free heme, which has emerged as a key mediator of pro-
inflammatory and pro-oxidative stress reactions in critical illnesses [7,36,44–47], plays an
important role in this increased risk for infection. We used a murine model of TH with trans-
fusion of fresh or stored mouse RBCs, followed by airway instillation of Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa and assessment of the severity of bacterial pneumonia. Complementary cell-culture
studies assessing the effects and mechanisms of heme-dependent inhibition of bacterial killing
by immune cells and observational studies measuring products of hemolysis in transfused TH
patients were also performed.

mingham (UAB) Institutional Review Board.
Reagents
All reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH) unless otherwise specified.
TAK-242 was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). Hemopexin (HPX) was purchased
from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody was a
kind gift from Kevin Tracey (Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, New York, NY). Intrali-
pid, IgG2b isotype blocking antibody, iron (III) chloride, neocuproine hydrochloride, ferro-
zine, ascorbic acid, and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint

 Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted according to the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals [48].
Rat endothelial cell isolation
Rat microvascular endothelial cells (RMVECs) were isolated and cultured as previously
described [49]. Briefly, rats were euthanized and underwent sternotomy, and heart and lungs
were excised en bloc. For RMVEC isolation, thin strips removed from the lung parenchyma
were minced and digested. Complete medium as described below was added to the isolation
mixture, and cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and plated in culture dishes. RMVECs were
removed using trypsin and cloning rings and resuspended in complete medium. Primary cul-
tures were characterized by their cobblestone morphology, uptake of 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,30,30-
tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled low-density lipoprotein, and an endothelial cell marker
panel.
Cell culture
RMVECs were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, and a murine alveolar macro-
phage cell line (MH-S cells, no. CRL-2019; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA)
was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium. Both were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were maintained at 37˚C with 5%
CO2.
Mouse blood banking
Mouse blood banking was performed as previously described with slight modifications
[36,39]. Blood from C57BL/6 male mice was collected by cardiac puncture and leukoreduced
under sterile conditions by filtering through a Sephadex G25 microcellulose column (1:3 w/w).
Columns were then washed with 10 times the volume of PBS. Preliminary studies demon-
strated >99% loss of leukocytes and 95% ± 2.4% loss of platelets (mean ± SEM, n = 3) by FACS
analyses. Briefly, 250 μl of whole blood was sampled before and after leukoreduction, acting as
its own control. Anti-CD41 was added to a final concentration of 1:500. Collected RBCs were
centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4˚C, concentrated to a hematocrit of 60% with AS-1 (Bax-
ter, Lake Zurich, IL), and then placed in a capped 1-ml syringe with no headspace. RBCs (0.4
ml total volume at 60% Hct) were stored at 4˚C for up to 14 d in the dark. Storage of murine
RBCs for approximately 2 wk is equivalent to human RBC storage for 42 d based on RBC sta-
bility and recovery post-transfusion [29,34,36,50]. In separate experiments, fresh and stored
RBCs and supernatants were separated by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 5 min at 4˚C). Then,
the RBC fraction from a fresh sample was mixed with supernatants from a stored sample, and
the RBC fraction from a stored sample mixed with supernatants from a fresh sample. Each
mixture was then used immediately in resuscitation.
Plasma collection and storage
Frozen C57BL/6 mouse plasma was purchased from Innovative Research (Novi, MI) and
stored at −20˚C in 100-μl aliquots. On the day of each experiment, plasma was thawed, mixed
with stored RBCs, and then transfused.
TH resuscitation model
The TH resuscitation mouse model was performed as previously described [36]. All surgeries
were initiated between 7 AM and 9 AM. C57BL/6 male mice (22–26 g) were anesthetized by

 inhalation of 5% isoflurane in air. The concentration of isoflurane was then reduced to the
minimal concentration for maintenance. The abdomen and groin were shaved and washed
with 10% povidone-iodine, and a 2-cm midline laparotomy was performed to induce soft tis-
sue trauma. Both femoral arteries were cannulated with catheters (Braintree Scientific, Brain-
tree, MA). Systemic arterial pressure was continuously monitored through one arterial line
while hemorrhage and resuscitation were performed via the other. Mice were bled over 30 min
to a mean arterial pressure of 30 ± 5 mm Hg. This blood pressure was maintained for a further
30 min by additional bleeding as required. All incision sites were bathed with 2% lidocaine for
analgesia and re-bathed as needed. At the end of the 60-min hemorrhagic shock period, ani-
mals were resuscitated over 30 min with 3 units (300 μl) of fresh (day 0, n = 8) or stored (day
14, n = 9) packed RBCs. Given recent results from the PROPPR trial indicating that initial
transfusion of packed RBCs and plasma should occur in a 1:1 ratio [51], we resuscitated our
hemorrhaged mice with equivalent volumes of RBCs and plasma. After resuscitation, mice
were placed into cages with a heating pad for approximately 1 h and then moved to standard
housing. When applicable, TAK-242 (7.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously immediately
after the onset of shock to allow comparison and validation of data collected with TLR4−/−
mice. Hemopexin (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously before the onset of resuscitation,
immediately prior to when heme exposure via stored RBC transfusion occurred. Anti-
HMGB1 blocking antibody (50 μg) was administered intraperitoneally before tracheal instilla-
tion of P. aeruginosa.
Measurement of hemoglobin, free heme, and non-transferrin-bound iron
At indicated times, blood was collected from the mice and immediately centrifuged (2,000 × g,
2 min, room temperature) to pellet RBCs. Plasma was separated, stored on ice and free hemo-
globin and heme measured within 1 h of collection by spectral deconvolution as recently
described [52]. Similar methods were used to assess free hemoglobin and cell-free heme
(CFH) in stored RBCs. Non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) was measured with slight modifi-
cations as described previously [53–55]. Briefly, 152 μl of iron (III) chloride standard (0, 0.1,
0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 50 μM) or mice plasma was incubated with 8 μl of 1.6 M NTA (pH 7.0, final
concentration 80 mM) for 30 min at 20–25˚C. Then 160 μl of standard or plasma sample in 80
mM NTA was ultrafiltered using Centricon (3 kDa MW; Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 10,620 ×
g (10,000 rpm) for 2 h at 15˚C. Then 120 μl of eluted standard or plasma sample was acidified
with 6.3 μl of 100 mM HCl (final concentration 5 mM) in 96-well plates and incubated for 30
min at room temperature. Then 44 μl of the iron-detection reagent (final concentration 0.5
mM ferrozine, 0.5 mM neocuproine, 0.21 M ammonium acetate, and 0.07 M ascorbic acid in
water) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Ferrous ferrozine complex was measured
at 540 nm by VICTOR plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), and plasma NTBI was cal-
culated according to iron (III) chloride standard curve. The concentration of standard was ver-
ified by extinction coefficient of ferrous ferrozine complex at 562 nm (27.9 mM−1cm−1).
Pneumonia model
The mouse pneumonia model was performed as we previously described [56]. Mice were
instilled with P. aeruginosa K-strain (PAK), a wild-type strain (a gift from Dr. Stephen Lory),
48 h after TH and resuscitation. In separate studies, PAK was administered to wild-type mice
without TH and resuscitation and immediately after TAK-242 or hemopexin administration
or 48 h post-hemopexin administration. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xyla-
zine (90–200 mg/kg/10 mg/kg intramuscularly). The mouse was laid on a board with its head
elevated at 45˚, and 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing approximately 5 × 107

 colony-forming units (CFUs) of P. aeruginosa was instilled into both lungs through the trachea
via the mouth by using a 27G gavage needle. The mouse was allowed to recover for 15 min
prior to being returned to the cage. Mice were active and appeared normal after 30 min. When
applicable, 6 h after the bacterial instillation, mice were euthanized with a larger dose of keta-
mine/xylazine. Blood samples were collected in a sterile fashion through puncture of the infe-
rior vena cava after laparotomy and bilateral thoracotomies were performed. The mouse lungs
were removed, weighed, and homogenized for lung vascular permeability or bacterial CFU
measurements.
Survival
Following procedures, mice were weighed twice a day and carefully monitored every 6 h to fol-
low the anticipated development of a systemic inflammatory response secondary to the shock
period. This response was graded using a clinical index of systemic inflammation based on the
presence of the following signs: lethargy, piloerection, tremors, periorbital exudates, labored
respirations, and diarrhea. Mice displaying signs of overt distress or respiratory distress
(coughing, gasping, insufficient gas exchange leading to hypoxia) or clearly moribund were
euthanized. Possible hind-limb ischemia secondary to the femoral artery ligations was also
monitored by examination for lack of perfusion (pink coloration and cold) and, if observed,
triggered euthanasia. Euthanasia was carried out within 15 min upon reaching end point crite-
ria. After PAK instillation, mice were checked until death or 96 h, except for experiments test-
ing the effects of anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody, where survival was monitored only for 24 h
after PAK instillation. Survival time was defined as the time between instillation and death.
Mice displaying signs of respiratory distress (coughing, gasping, insufficient gas exchange lead-
ing to hypoxia) secondary to multi-organ dysfunction were euthanized, and time of death
recorded. Therefore, survival end points reflected a composite of mortality and respiratory dis-
tress secondary to multi-organ dysfunction. To avoid unnecessary duplication and use of
mice, survival data are pooled from multiple experiments conducted over 18 mo, for a total of
42 mice. Effects of fresh and stored RBCs on this end point were assessed over this entire
period to evaluate consistency of responses across time and to allow for comparison of thera-
peutic (hemopexin, TAK-242) and TLR4 depletion effects.
Lung vascular permeability measurement
Lung endothelial permeability to protein (percent) and excess lung water (microliters) were
measured as previously described and plotted as extravascular pulmonary equivalents (EVPE)
[56]. Briefly, 0.5 μCi of 125I-albumin was injected intravenously; blood collected through punc-
ture of the inferior vena cava; lungs removed, weighed, and homogenized; and radioactivity
counted in a Wizard γ-counter (PerkinElmer). The homogenate was weighed and a fraction
centrifuged (12,000 × g, 8 min) to assay for hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant.
Endothelial permeability was calculated as the counts of 125I-albumin in the blood-free lung
tissue divided by the counts of 125I-albumin in the plasma. For these studies, mice were sacri-
ficed 6 h after PAK instillation and represent a separate group from animals used to assess sur-
vival or bacterial CFUs.
Measurement of bacterial CFUs
Lungs were collected in a sterile fashion as previously described [56]. The lungs were homoge-
nized in sterile containers, and the homogenates were serially diluted and plated in triplicate
on agar plates. For these studies, mice were sacrificed 6 h after PAK instillation and represent a
separate group from animals used to assess survival or permeability.

 Transendothelial permeability
Endothelial barrier integrity was measured using an Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing
(ECIS) system (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY) as previously described [49]. Briefly, RMVECs
were plated onto 8W10E+ arrays in normal culture medium and used when resistance reached
±900 Ohm, usually 24 h after seeding. Resistance was measured every 10 min for the duration
of the experiments. Baseline resistance was measured for 1 h before addition of TAK-242,
hemopexin, or PAK. TAK-242 and hemopexin were added 30 min before PAK.
HMGB1 measurement
Confluent RMVECs were exposed to 10 μM hemin for 6 h, and supernatants were collected
and stored at −80˚C until assayed. HMGB1 levels were measured by ELISA according to man-
ufacturer instructions (IBL International, Morrisville, NC).
Phagocytosis
The assay was performed as we have previously described [56]. Briefly, 1 × 106 MH-S cells, a
murine alveolar macrophage cell line, were exposed to 107 CFU/ml of PAK for 45 min at 37˚C.
Gentamicin (150 μg/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. The medium was
removed, and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS then lysed by adding 200 μl of hypo-
tonic buffer (pH 7.2) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Sterile water (800 μl) was added to the
cell suspension, which was serially diluted onto agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 h
at 37˚C, and the resulting colonies counted. No bacterial colonies were observed in lysates
from uninfected macrophages or when bacteria alone were incubated for 1 h with gentamicin,
indicating complete killing using this protocol.
TH patients
One hundred consecutive trauma patients admitted to the UAB ER from 1 January 2015 to 30
April 2016 were screened by the attending trauma surgeon for inclusion into the study. Inclu-
sion criteria were blunt or penetrating trauma, level I trauma activation, and systolic blood
pressure < 90 mm Hg, respiratory compromise or placement of an advanced airway, or a Glas-
gow Coma Score < 9. Patients were excluded if they were <19 y old; consent was denied, not
returned, or not obtainable due to no family available for consenting (due to the nature of the
study, investigators had 72 h from the time of admission to obtain informed consent from the
patient or an appropriate surrogate); or patients who had a bleeding diathesis or were known
to take anticoagulant medications, had known liver disease, were pregnant, were incarcerated,
or expired within 1 h of admission (n = 44). A blood sample was drawn at the conclusion of
damage control surgery and blood product resuscitation after both the surgeon and anesthesi-
ologist (where applicable) agreed that hemodynamic resuscitation was complete, an approach
implemented in the PROPPR study, for which the UAB ER was one of the recruiting centers
[51]. Generally, damage control surgery and resuscitation took no longer than 3 h to complete.
An additional 6 individuals were excluded due to incomplete sample collection or processing.
RBCs were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min, and cell-free Hb, free heme, and
NTBI in the plasma measured as described above. Also, segments were collected from all
blood bags transfused, and data analyzed for 35 patients for whom segments from each unit
transfused were available. RBCs were collected from segments and pelleted by centrifugation
(3,000 × g for 5 min at 4˚C). Supernatants were collected, and concentrations of oxyhemoglo-
bin (oxyHb), methemoglobin (metHb), and free heme determined as outlined above. All
research involving human participants was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board.

 Whole blood was collected via a central line in acid citrate dextrose vacutainers and centri-
fuged within 60 min of collection. Plasma was separated and stored at 4˚C for up to 72 h before
being rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80˚C for further analysis. Transfused
RBCs included in these analyses were predominantly stored in AS-1 (87%), with the remainder
in AS-3 (7%) or CPDA-1 (6%) storage solution.
Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin
Human haptoglobin and hemopexin were determined by ELISA sandwich assay (ab108858
and ab171576 for human; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer
instructions.
Statistical analysis
All normally distributed data were summarized as mean ± SEM. Non-normally distributed
data were summarized as median ± interquartile range. For the statistical analysis, we used
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Normality was assessed using the D’Agos-
tino–Pearson test and through visual inspections of probability plots. For normally distributed
data, 1-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test was used to compare 3 or more experimen-
tal groups; for non-normally distributed data, the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s mul-
tiple comparison test was used. Student t test was used to compare 2 experimental groups. A
Kaplan–Meier analysis followed by a log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used to compare the sur-
vival between 2 experimental groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
TH resuscitation with stored blood increases mortality, pulmonary edema
formation, and bacterial infection from subsequent P. aeruginosa
pneumonia
C57BL/6 mice underwent TH and resuscitation with fresh or stored RBCs and plasma (Fig
1A). No differences in blood pressure changes before or after resuscitation between groups
were observed, consistent with equal volume transfusions (Fig 1B). Two days after resuscita-
tion, mice had their trachea instilled with PAK (wild-type P. aeruginosa); Fig 1A illustrates the
experimental protocol. Median survival was 32 h for mice transfused with fresh RBCs (n = 12).
However, mortality significantly increased in mice resuscitated with stored RBCs (median sur-
vival 8 h, n = 9), with all mice dying within 20 h of PAK instillation (Fig 1C). In a separate
group of mice, pulmonary edema (n = 3) and bacterial CFUs (n = 3) were measured. Pulmo-
nary edema approximately doubled (Fig 1D), and lung bacterial CFUs significantly increased
(Fig 1E) in mice resuscitated with stored RBCs compared to those that received fresh RBCs.
These results indicate that in the setting of trauma with hemorrhagic shock, massive resuscita-
tion with stored RBCs may significantly impair bacterial clearance in the lung compared to
resuscitation with fresh RBCs. We also tested whether the effects of stored RBCs were due to
RBCs and/or supernatants in stored samples. Pelleted RBCs from 14-d stored RBCs were
mixed with supernatants from a fresh RBC (0 d) preparation and vice versa. Mice underwent
TH and resuscitation with these mixtures, and 48 h later PAK was instilled and survival
assessed. Fig 1C shows that mice resuscitated with fresh RBCs plus stored supernatants (n = 5)
or stored RBCs plus fresh supernatants (n = 5) had improved survival (median survival 24 h)
compared to the stored RBC group.

 Impairment of lung function secondary to TH and massive resuscitation
with stored RBCs and subsequent pneumonia is heme-dependent
There are numerous components in stored RBCs that have the potential to cause organ injury
that include, but are not limited to, free heme, free hemoglobin, iron, and microvesicles
[25,52]. Consistent with our previous studies [25,36], free oxyHb, metHb, and heme levels
were increased after 14 d of RBC storage, being 930 ± 125 μM, 40.3 ± 8.8 μM, and 168 ±
44.7 μM, respectively (mean ± SEM, n = 7). Fig 2 shows that free hemoglobin and free heme
were higher 4 h after resuscitation with stored RBCs compared to fresh RBCs (n = 3–7 as in-
dicated); NTBI level was also higher, but this difference did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.07). Levels of these mediators decreased after 24–48 h. Based on our previous studies
and studies from other groups indicating a role of free heme in mediating inflammatory end
organ injury [36,57] after transfusion with stored RBCs, we next tested the effects of exogenous
hemopexin.

 Mice (n = 5) were treated with hemopexin after hemorrhagic shock, but before massive
resuscitation with stored RBCs, followed by PAK administration 48 h thereafter. Hemopexin
improved post-pneumonia survival in mice that underwent massive resuscitation with stored
RBCs (Fig 3A). Furthermore, hemopexin improved P. aeruginosa–induced pulmonary edema
formation (Fig 3B; n = 4–7) and lung bacterial CFUs (Fig 3C; n = 5–6). These data indicate
that the increased severity of bacterial lung injury secondary to massive resuscitation with
stored RBCs is heme-dependent. Interestingly, mice transfused with stored RBCs and treated
with hemopexin had significantly lower hemoglobin levels compared to mice transfused with
stored RBCs. Free heme and NTBI levels tended to be lower at 4 h post-transfusion in hemo-
pexin-treated mice; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 2A).
Role of TLR4 cell signaling in lung bacterial infection and injury secondary
to TH and massive resuscitation with stored RBCs
Previous studies have shown that free heme can activate the TLR4 receptor [7,36,44,45]. To
determine whether the effect of resuscitation with stored RBCs is TLR4-dependent, we treated
TH mice (n = 5) with TAK-242, a TLR4 inhibitor, or with its vehicle (intralipid) after trauma
(laparotomy) and at the onset of shock. Treatment with TAK-242 improved post-pneumonia
survival (Fig 3A). Additionally, TAK-242 improved pulmonary edema formation (Fig 3B) and
decreased lung bacterial CFUs (Fig 3C). Finally, to demonstrate that our results were not due
to off-target effects of TAK-242, we confirmed our survival results in TLR4−/− mice. TLR4−/−
mice (n = 5) that underwent TH with massive resuscitation with stored RBCs had significantly
improved survival compared to wild-type mice (Fig 3A). These data demonstrate that TLR4
signaling plays a role in heme-induced exacerbation of lung bacterial infection secondary to
TH followed by massive resuscitation with stored RBCs.
Effects of hemopexin and TLR4 blockade are due to prevention of storage-
lesion-dependent toxicity
To test if the protection afforded by anti-TLR4 or anti-heme therapies was due to protection
against bacterial pneumonia infection per se, rather than storage lesion plus bacterial pneu-
monia, mice were infected with PAK in the absence of any trauma, hemorrhage, or resuscita-
tion. Fig 3D shows that mice administered PAK all died within 48 h (n = 11). TAK-242,

 administered immediately prior to PAK instillation, had no significant effect on survival (n =
3). Interestingly, hemopexin administered at the time of PAK instillation (n = 6) did improve
survival, consistent with prior reports showing that heme sequestration prevents sepsis-
induced injury [7,58]. However, hemopexin administered 48 h prior to P. aeruginosa instilla-
tion (with no trauma, hemorrhage, or stored RBC resuscitation, n = 5), which mimics the pro-
tocol for hemopexin administered in the data shown in Fig 3A, had no effect on survival after
bacterial infection.
Heme-induced increases in lung endothelial permeability are
TLR4-dependent
TH and resuscitation with stored compared to fresh RBCs not only caused increased mortality
but also significantly increased the severity of pulmonary edema induced by P. aeruginosa
pneumonia (Fig 1D). Recent studies have shown that heme induces paracellular permeability
[59,60]. To test if heme, via TLR4-dependent pathways, induces endothelial permeability,

and subsequent pneumonia is heme- and TLR4-dependent. C57BL/6 or TLR4−/− mice underwent TH with fresh or
stored red blood cell (RBC) resuscitation (with plasma 1:1) and subsequent P. aeruginosa K-strain (PAK)–induced

 RMVEC monolayers were treated with hemin. Hemin treatment significantly decreased resis-
tance (indicating increased permeability),but this decrease was prevented by TLR4 inhibition
using TAK-242 (Fig 4A) and hemopexin (Fig 4B).
Heme induces exogenous release of HMGB1 that subsequently inhibits
phagocytosis of P. aeruginosaby alveolar macrophages
HMGB1 is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that is released by a variety of cells
at trauma and tissue injury, and a known mediator of decreased bacterial clearance [61]. We
therefore hypothesized that resuscitation with stored RBCs would mediate further increases in
extracellular HMGB1 release. Fig 5A shows that extracellular serum levels of HMGB1 were
approximately 5-fold higher in mice (n = 3) resuscitated with stored RBCs compared to mice
resuscitated fresh RBCs. Furthermore, free heme also induced extracellular release of HMGB1
from RMVECs compared to vehicle control (Fig 5B). TH and resuscitation with stored com-
pared to fresh blood not only caused increased P. aeruginosa–mediated mortality but was also
associated with a significantly higher number of bacterial CFUs in the lung. To test if this
could be due to an immunosuppression effect of heme, in the next series of experiments, we
determined whether exposure to heme inhibited P. aeruginosa phagocytosis by MH-S cells, a
murine alveolar macrophage cell line. The results indicate that exposure to heme caused a 90%
inhibition of P. aeruginosa phagocytosis by MH-S cells (Fig 5C). Furthermore, when MH-S
cells were pretreated with an anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody (or isotype control) before expo-
sure to hemin, heme-mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa phagocytosis by MH-S cells was
attenuated. Finally, mice that underwent TH followed by resuscitation with stored RBCs were
injected with anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody (or isotype control) before tracheal instillation
of P. aeruginosa (Fig 5D). As seen, mice who received anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody (n = 6)
had improved survival after resuscitation with stored RBCs and subsequent P. aeruginosa
pneumonia compared to mice receiving the control antibody (n = 4). In summary, these
results indicate that heme from resuscitation with stored RBCs increases extracellular release
Fig 4. Heme-dependent decreases in endothelial barrier resistance are TLR4-dependent. Rat microvascular endothelial cell (RMVEC)
monolayers were seeded in Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) arrays as described in Methods. When monolayers reached the
appropriate resistance, monolayers were treated with vehicle or heme (10 μM, n = 3) alone or in the presence of TAK-242 (150 μg/ml TAK-242 was
added 30 min before administration of heme, n = 3) (A) or 10 μM hemopexin (n = 3) (B). Resistance was measured every 10 min for 8 h. Changes
in resistance after 8 h were calculated and vehicle effects subtracted. Decreases (i.e., negative values) in resistance indicate increases in permeability.

mortality.
Heme levels in patients after TH and resuscitation
To our knowledge, no study has assessed the amount of in vitro products of hemolysis trans-
fused into TH patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study. Table 1 shows demographic
information. Fig 6A shows the levels of plasma free oxyHb, metHb, heme, NTBI, haptoglobin
(HP), and hemopexin (HPX) measured once patients were stably resuscitated (approximately
2–3 h after initiation of resuscitation). OxyHb (median 9.2 μM, IQR 5.8–14.3 μM) and free
heme (median 10.9 μM, IQR 6.3–16.4 μM) were similar and both higher than metHb or NTBI
level, with NTBI level being approximately 5- to 10-fold lower than oxyHb or CFH. Interest-
ingly, hemoglobin and HP levels were similar, but HPX level was significantly lower than free
heme level. Fig 6B plots the ratio of HP/2:hemoglobin and HPX:free heme. The ratio of HP/2:

 hemoglobin was close to 1 (median 0.87, IQR 0.28–1.50), although variance is noted. For
hemopexin:free heme, the ratio was lower (median 0.56, IQR 0.34–0.86) and below 1 (p < 0.01
by 1-sample t test and comparison to a theoretical mean of 1). Segments attached to blood
bags that were transfused into TH patients were also collected at the time of transfusion; data
from 35 patients for whom segments from each unit transfused were available were analyzed
for supernatant levels of oxyHb, metHb, and free heme. Fig 6C plots the concentrations of
transfused oxyHb, metHb, and free heme. Levels varied 20-fold (from micromolar to close to
millimolar concentrations). The percentage of oxyHb, metHb, and free heme of total heme for
all units transfused was relatively constant, at approximately 75%, 3%, and 22%, respectively,
indicating that the total heme concentration transfused was largely dependent on the number
of RBC units transfused. Fig 6D confirms this, showing that the total heme (sum of oxyHb,
metHb, and free heme) transfused linearly correlated with the number of units transfused.
Interestingly, no correlation with the average storage age (15.3 ± 0.9 d, mean ± SEM, n = 35) of
the RBC units was observed. Fifteen of these 35 patients were massively transfused (defined as
an average rate of transfusion of >3 units per hour, assessed until stably resuscitated).
Discussion
Our findings using a mouse model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock with stored blood trans-
fusion and subsequent PAK instillation demonstrate that transfusion with older stored RBCs
increases the severity of bacterial pneumonia. Using pharmacological inhibition or genetic
ablation approaches in vivo, we further showed that free heme present in stored RBCs, or gen-
erated after transfusion with stored RBCs, triggers a TLR4- and HMGB1-dependent process
that leads to increased pulmonary microvascular permeability, higher bacterial numbers after
PAK instillation in vivo, and inhibition of bacterial clearance by immune cells in vitro. Com-
plementing these observations, we demonstrated that in addition to exposure to increased
heme, endogenous hemopexin is limited in resuscitated trauma patients and mouse models of
TH.
The safety and efficacy of stored RBCs has received much attention recently, fueled, in large
part, by retrospective analyses indicating that transfusion with older stored blood is associated
with adverse effects [1–6,8–12]. More recent data from prospective randomized research clini-
cal studies, however, indicate that transfusion with younger versus older RBCs was equivalent
in cardiac surgery and critically ill patients [13,14,16]. Notwithstanding limitations with study
design, an important question is how generalizable these conclusions are to patients receiving
stored RBCs to treat massive bleeding and hemorrhagic shock. We focused on TH patients, in

 whom associations between stored RBCs and adverse events—characterized by microcircula-
tory dysfunction, increased critical end organ injury, and inflammation and lung infection—
had been shown in multiple retrospective analyses, further supported by preclinical animal
model studies [29,36,38,57]. Using a murine model of TH with stored RBC and plasma resus-
citation, we found that transfusion with 3 units of leukoreduced mouse RBCs stored for 14 d,
which is similar to human RBCs stored for 35–42 d, increases the severity of P. aeruginosa–
induced pulmonary edema and mortality in mice. Importantly, retrospective analyses of clini-
cal data demonstrate associations between the age of blood transfused and increased risk for
lung infection [43].
The effect of stored RBCs in increasing the severity of P. aeruginosa infection was observed
up to at least 48 h post-resuscitation. To gain insights into potential mechanisms, we first mea-
sured levels of putative mediators formed during RBC storage that may increase lung vascular
permeability and/or promote bacterial infection/prevent bacterial clearance. We measured
hemoglobin (oxyHb and metHb) and free heme in the stored RBCs, and these mediators and
NTBI in mice after transfusion. We used a spectral deconvolution approach to measure heme-
containing species, which we recently showed avoids artifacts associated with widely used and
commercially available assays that do not distinguish between free heme and hemoglobin [52].
Consistent with our previous reports, levels of hemoglobin and free heme were in the

 hundreds of micromolar range in stored RBC supernatants [25,52]. These levels led to an
increase in circulating free hemoglobin, free heme, and NTBI after resuscitation, indicated by
these species being elevated after resuscitating mice with stored RBCs. However, these levels
all returned to baseline by 24–48 h, suggesting that some of these mediators may activate cell
signaling pathways that lead to increased lung vascular permeability and inhibit the host
response to a secondary lung bacterial infection. While our primary hypothesis was that free
heme is formed ex vivo by “hemolysis in the bag” before transfusion, mixtures of fresh RBCs
with stored supernatants and vice versa produced an intermediate response in terms of sur-
vival after secondary pneumonia; mice did not die as quickly as those resuscitated with stored
RBCs and tended to die earlier than those resuscitated with fresh RBCs. This suggests that
both in-bag hemolysis and heme release during intravascular hemolysis (likely via lysis of
older, more fragile RBCs), or possibly extravascular hemolysis after transfusion, are playing a
role in sensitizing mice to subsequent PAK-induced injury. These data underscore the need
for better understanding of the primary mechanisms and temporal features of free heme
release and exposure in the setting of TH with stored RBC transfusion.
There are multiple distinct molecular species that increase post-transfusion that could play
a role in stored-RBC-dependent increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa toxicity. These
include free hemoglobin, which causes microcirculatory dysfunction secondary to nitric oxide
scavenging, and NTBI, which may provide substrate for bacterial growth [17,18,32,38]. We
focused on free heme for several reasons. Stored-RBC-dependent acute lung and kidney injury
is prevented by hemopexin, heme addition promotes endothelial and epithelial injury
[36,57,59], and multiple studies have shown heme to be a mediator of acute inflammatory
injury to all major organ systems in sickle cell disease and sepsis via multiple overlapping
mechanisms including TLR4 activation, oxidative stress, immune cell dysfunction, and sup-
pression of phagocytosis [44–47,58,62,63]. Our data demonstrate that HPX completely
reversed P. aeruginosa–induced mortality in mice transfused with stored RBCs, supporting a
central role for free heme in increased infection risk in this pathological setting. Our studies
do not exclude a possible role for hemoglobin or NTBI in exacerbated injury after P. aerugi-
nosa instillation. Assessing the role of these mediators requires further studies, using targeted
approaches such as assessing the effects of haptoglobin (to scavenge free hemoglobin) or apo-
transferrin (to chelate NTBI) for example. Further underscoring the need for additional stud-
ies were data showing that HPX significantly decreased free hemoglobin levels in mice trans-
fused with stored RBCs (Fig 2). Hemopexin binds free heme with a high affinity, and thus it
was surprising that CFH levels were not significantly decreased in HPX-treated mice. This
likely reflects limitations of sampling at a single time point coupled with inherent variation in
this marker. More surprising was the observation that HPX significantly decreased free hemo-
globin levels. Hemopexin does not bind hemoglobin, and assuming that free heme is derived
from hemoglobin in this model, these data suggest that free heme mediates, in part, red cell
hemolysis and/or stimulates endogenous clearance of hemoglobin. We speculate that the pro-
oxidative properties of free heme contribute to ongoing hemolysis, providing a feed-forward
process resulting in more hemoglobin and heme release. This could also explain why the HPX
therapy is so potent, resulting in almost complete protection in this and other models of hemo-
lysis, where the toxicity is mediated not just by free heme, but also by hemoglobin. Finally, we
note that, using survival after PAK instillation as an end point, both HPX and TLR4 inhibition
or depletion showed protective effects against stored RBC toxicity that went beyond the pro-
tective effects of using fresh RBCs. All mice still died after PAK in the fresh RBC group by 40
h, but in HPX-treated and TLR4-inhibited mice resuscitated with stored RBCs, no deaths were
observed up to 48 h after PAK. Interestingly, HPX also improved survival after PAK when it
was administered 48 h after TH and fresh RBC resuscitation. This suggests that the toxicity

 that occurs with fresh RBCs is also heme-dependent. However, no differences in survival were
observed between PAK alone and PAK after TH with fresh RBCs (compare survival curves in
Fig 3A and 3D, suggesting no gain of toxic function associated with fresh RBCs). That said,
HPX administered 48 h prior to PAK, in the absence of TH and RBC resuscitation, had no
effect on survival after PAK (see below and Fig 3D). Thus, we conclude that heme is a mediator
of PAK infection with or without fresh/stored RBC transfusion after TH, but with TH and
RBC transfusion, the primary source of heme is RBC-dependent, and the severity of injury is
greater with stored RBCs. Moreover, the effects of heme occur early as treatment with HPX or
TLR4 inhibitors is sufficient to prevent subsequent effects of PAK instillation, underscoring
the critical effects of heme exposure in altering the course of subsequent injury after TH and
shock.
It is possible that the improved survival mediated by TLR4 inhibition or HPX therapy was
due to protection against bacterial pneumonia rather than against storage lesion plus bacterial
pneumonia. However, TAK-242 had no effect on survival after PAK instillation alone (in the
absence of trauma, hemorrhage, and stored RBC resuscitation), suggesting that the protective
effect of TLR4 inhibition on PAK-induced mortality after TH and stored RBC resuscitation is
due to mitigation of storage-lesion-dependent processes. These data are consistent with pub-
lished reports showing no differences in PAK pneumonia in wild-type versus TLR4-deficient
mice [64]. While HPX administered at the time of PAK instillation did show protective effects,
when administered 48 h prior to PAK instillation—mimicking the protocol used for our study
of TH with stored RBC resuscitation—no protection was observed. Therefore, we conclude
that while HPX can prevent bacterial sepsis, reproducing prior reports [7,58], the protective
effects of HPX observed in the presence of TH and stored RBC resuscitation are largely due to
protection against storage-lesion-derived heme-mediated immunosuppression.
We demonstrated that free heme promotes mortality secondary to P. aeruginosa infection,
and propose 2 parallel mechanisms underlying this effect (Fig 7). These involve induction of
endothelial permeability and inhibition of bacterial clearance mediated by TLR4 and HMGB1,
respectively. First, while the role of TLR4 in TH has been widely studied, the potential for
transfused heme as a TLR4 ligand in this setting has not been explored in detail. Heme can
bind TLR4 and activate downstream signaling. This pathway appears to be pivotal as P. aerugi-
nosa–induced mortality after stored RBC transfusion was completely reversed by TLR4
Fig 7. Proposed mechanisms for free-heme-dependent potentiation of lung infection after trauma hemorrhage. We hypothesize that when resuscitation with
stored red blood cells (RBCs) leads to increased circulating heme that is in excess of hemopexin, 2 parallel pathways are activated involving (i) release of HMGB1
and subsequent decreased immune-cell-dependent bacterial clearance and (ii) increased endothelial permeability. These combine to promote acute lung injury and
increase sensitivity to lung infection. We also underscore the potential that heme-dependent effects synergize with other components of stored RBCs, including
hemoglobin, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), and microvesicles, to mediate adverse outcomes.

 blockade during TH or by genetic ablation of TLR4. We also demonstrated in vitro that endo-
thelial TLR4 is a key mediator in heme-induced permeability. However, further studies with
tissue-selective TLR4 knockout animals are needed to test the relative role of endothelial TLR4
in mediating decreased lung bacterial clearance and alveolar macrophage phagocytosis after
TH and stored RBC resuscitation.
Extracellular HMGB1 is a damage-associated molecular pattern that elicits multiple effects
that promote end organ damage. These include increasing the severity of lung injury subse-
quent to bacterial infection [65,66], promoting neutrophil extracellular trap formation [67],
inhibiting macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils [68], and decreasing effective
bacterial killing via the inhibition of neutrophil NADPH oxidase [61]. We have shown that
plasma HMGB1 is higher in transfused trauma patients compared to those who were not
transfused [69]. We extend these observations in a mouse TH model, demonstrating that
stored RBC resuscitation results in higher plasma HMGB1 compared to fresh RBC resuscita-
tion. A recent study indicated that in non-leukoreduced RBC preparations, storage resulted in
increased extracellular HMGB1 that inhibited macrophage-dependent phagocytosis [70].
However, HMGB1 levels in supernatants are dramatically decreased in leukoreduced stored
RBCs, and since we used the latter, we suggest stored RBCs are unlikely to directly account for
the increased plasma levels of HMGB1 observed after stored RBC resuscitation. A more likely
scenario in our studies is that HMGB1 was released via cell death induced by stored RBC
resuscitation. Indeed, the latter has been shown to induce lung endothelial cell necroptosis,
leading to extracellular release of HMGB1 [71], a result we recapitulated using free heme
alone. More important, perhaps, is the fact that anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody significantly
improved survival after stored RBC resuscitation and subsequent P. aeruginosa lung infection
in vivo, suggesting that extracellular HMGB1 plays a key role in mediating decreased lung bac-
terial clearance after resuscitation with stored RBCs. This conclusion was further supported by
the finding that anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody restored the ability of macrophages to phago-
cytose in the presence of free heme. The exact mechanism linking heme and HMGB1 to inhi-
bition of macrophage-dependent phagocytosis remains to be elucidated. Recent studies
demonstrated a mechanism involving heme-dependent disruption of actin cytoskeleton
dynamics [58], but whether this involves TLR4 or HMGB1 is unclear. Taken altogether, these
data support the model proposed in Fig 7, in which heme derived from stored RBCs promotes
both endothelial permeability and immunosuppression, defined here as suppressed bacterial
clearance. The 2 pathways then converge to increase the severity of lung infection caused by P.
aeruginosa. Additional studies are required to test whether this model is applicable to other
bacterial strains and species and to test the role of pro-bacterial growth factors, including iron,
that are also increased after stored RBC transfusions. In this context, we emphasize that it is
unlikely that a single mediator or mechanism is responsible for stored-RBC-dependent
increase in lung injury and infection, and that additive or synergistic interactions between
hemoglobin, free heme, NTBI, and microvesicles are essential in adverse outcomes. Addition-
ally, it is important to remember that these species are not independent factors but intimately
related, as free heme is hypothesized to be released from free hemoglobin. Indeed, it is possible
that some of the protective effects of HP and HPX derive from preventing NTBI formation
from hemoglobin and heme degradation, as discussed above. Moreover, mechanistically, addi-
tive or synergistic effects between decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, oxidative stress,
inflammation, and immunosuppression are likely. Our studies were not designed to study the
injurious dose effect of stored blood. Indeed, in our experimental model, mice were resusci-
tated with a large amount of stored blood that mimics massive blood transfusion in humans to
treat the hemorrhagic shock. However, we were careful not to overload the mice with larger
than necessary doses of stored blood and plasma that could induce a transfusion-associated

 circulatory overload. Thus, while our mouse model of TH represents well the injury that
occurs secondary to stored RBC transfusion, it does not provide insight into the injurious dose
effect of RBCs that may be seen in trauma patients who receive only a few units of stored
RBCs. Future studies testing different RBC doses or equal volume resuscitations comprising
different numbers of fresh and stored units are warranted to assess dose-dependent effects.
Although the role of heme and other stored RBC components has been investigated in ani-
mal models of stored RBC toxicity, very little is known about these mediators in human TH
with stored RBC resuscitation. We thus measured the total amount of hemoglobin and free
heme administered to TH patients, and while the total amount varied depending on the num-
ber of units transfused, hemoglobin levels were on average approximately 4 times higher than
free heme levels. These data show that relatively high concentrations of hemoglobin and free
heme are transfused, reaching millimolar concentrations in some cases. Limitations of these
measurements include the inability to account for storage age, the varying number of units
transfused per patient, and intrinsic donor to donor heterogeneity in storage-dependent
hemolysis. Another limitation of these measures is that we sampled segments attached to the
bags transfused due to constraints limiting the ability to sample the bags directly. Previous
studies have shown that segment levels of free hemoglobin are higher than those of their paired
bags, whereas the opposite relationship has been reported for free heme [24,25], suggesting
that the relative amount of free heme administered is in fact be higher than shown.
We also measured plasma levels of free hemoglobin, free heme, NTBI, HP, and HPX in TH
patients after resuscitation and hemodynamic stability. Plasma free hemoglobin levels were
comparable to free heme levels, and both levels were higher than NTBI levels. A large variance
was observed, but the majority of patients had levels of free heme above 5 μM, concentrations
which are in the range that induce cell permeability and injury in experimental studies. The
levels of hemolysis products transfused assessed by segment sampling also varied; however,
this variation was not dependent on the average age of the units, but the number of units trans-
fused. This underscores other datasets showing that age per se is not necessarily a good predic-
tor of stored RBC quality, and that volume of RBCs transfused should be considered in
evaluating stored RBC toxicities. There are several possible confounders and limitations with
these analyses, including the fact that we only assessed a single time point post-transfusion and
there is likely some free heme generated post-transfusion by intravascular hemolysis in addi-
tion to any administered by the transfusion itself. While the absolute concentration of these
mediators is important, the relative concentrations of hemoglobin and free heme, compared to
HP and HPX, respectively, are likely of greater clinical significance; HP and HPX are the
endogenous primary defense mechanisms protecting against hemolysis-dependent injury. We
showed that HP levels were higher than HPX levels, with the HP/2:oxyHb ratio being on aver-
age close to 1. In contrast, the HPX:free heme ratio was below 1, suggesting that endogenous
protection provided by circulating levels of HPX against free heme is limited, at least over the
early time period post-resuscitation. It should, however, be pointed out that these measure-
ments were limited to 1 time point at the end of hemostatic resuscitation and that the data are
not powered to test whether there are associations between free hemoglobin, free heme, NTBI,
haptoglobin, hemopexin, and clinical outcomes, although the relative assessment of hemoglo-
bin and HP and of free heme and HPX may be of clinical importance. It is also interesting to
note that transfusion of plasma is an important component of damage control resuscitation
after severe trauma and may provide a significant amount of HP and HPX to protect against
products of stored RBC hemolysis.
Study limitations include those noted above regarding the need for a more comprehensive,
time-dependent assessment of how products of hemolysis change in both the mouse model
used and patients undergoing resuscitation after trauma and hemorrhagic shock. Also as

 noted above, our studies do not exclude roles for hemoglobin and NTBI in contributing to the
increased bacterial burden in the lung mediated by stored RBCs, and we acknowledge the
need to measure tissue iron levels and other forms of iron (e.g., transferrin-bound iron) that
may contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.
In summary, using a murine model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock, large volume resus-
citation with stored blood, mimicking massive blood transfusion, overcomes endogenous anti-
oxidant defenses and promotes lung bacterial infection. We propose that heme present in
stored blood induces lung immunosuppression, indicated by inhibition of bacterial clearance
in vitro, resulting in increased mortality from subsequent P. aeruginosa pneumonia that occurs
in a hemopexin/heme-, TLR4-, and HMGB1-dependent manner. We recognize that many
challenges and questions remain and view our data as hypothesis generating. Clinically, our
findings underscore the need to establish whether the storage age of transfused RBCs corre-
lates with increasing levels of free heme after transfusion, and whether low ratios of HPX to
free heme and/or HP to free hemoglobin are associated with adverse outcomes. If demon-
strated, this could provide markers for identifying TH patients at higher risks for adverse out-
comes. Collectively, our studies underscore the need for prospective clinical studies to test
whether the storage age and amount (dose) of stored RBCs transfused is associated with
adverse events in severely traumatized patients with hemorrhagic shock that include, but are
not limited to, an increased risk for nosocomial infections and end organ injury.
