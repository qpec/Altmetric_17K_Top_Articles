EEG delta power and low heart rate in mice  
under anesthesia

The glymphatic system is responsible for brain-wide delivery of nutrients and clearance of waste via influx of cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) alongside perivascular spaces and through the brain. Glymphatic system activity increases during 
sleep or ketamine/xylazine (K/X) anesthesia, yet the mechanism(s) facilitating CSF influx are poorly understood. 
Here, we correlated influx of a CSF tracer into the brain with electroencephalogram (EEG) power, heart rate, blood 
pressure, and respiratory rate in wild-type mice under six different anesthesia regimens. We found that glymphatic 
CSF tracer influx was highest under K/X followed by isoflurane (ISO) supplemented with dexmedetomidine and 
pentobarbital. Mice anesthetized with -chloralose, Avertin, or ISO exhibited low CSF tracer influx. This is the first 
study to show that glymphatic influx correlates positively with cortical delta power in EEG recordings and negatively 
with beta power and heart rate.
INTRODUCTION
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can move along perivascular spaces in the 
brain and spinal cord to distribute nutrients and clear waste (1, 2). 
These processes are supported by the water channel aquaporin 4 
(AQP4), which is present at high density on the vascular end feet of 
astrocytes (2–4). CSF tracer influx to the brain is higher in animals 
in the sleeping than in the awake condition (5). Previous studies of 
glymphatic function have shown that anesthesia with ketamine/
xylazine (K/X) emulates sleep in that fluorescent CSF tracer influx 
and that the rate of radiolabeled A efflux from the brain is compa-
rable to findings in naturally sleeping animals (6). Although it remains 
largely unknown whether anesthetics other than K/X influence 
fluid movement from the CSF compartment into the brain, one experi-
mental magnetic resonance imaging study showed that anesthesia 
with isoflurane (ISO) combined with the 2-agonist dexmedetomidine 
(dex) facilitated glymphatic transport of a contrast agent compared 
to ISO alone (7). The scarcity of information concerning the physio-
logical mechanisms behind CSF transport has emerged as a limita-
tion for current models and may contribute to controversy about 
the importance of AQP4 as a driver for fluid flow in the glymphatic 
system (3, 8).
Slow cortical network oscillations (delta waves) may contribute 
to the efficiency of fluid influx into the brain parenchyma and clear-
ance of waste from the brain (5, 9). Delta waves are increased in 
naturally sleeping animals, potentially due to long-term homeostatic 
changes in the neuromodulatory, metabolic, and neurochemical 
environment (10) and broad synaptic scaling (11). Some types of 
sedatives, such as the 2-adrenergic agonists xylazine and dex, in-
duce a sharp increase in electroencephalogram (EEG) delta power, 
whereas anesthesia with the volatile anesthetic, ISO, or the inject-
able -aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) agonist pentobarbital 
maintain more high-frequency components (7, 12). In addition to 
neuronal network oscillations, cardiopulmonary parameters such as 
blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate can also regulate 
glymphatic influx, and these parameters are themselves modified by 
different anesthetics in drug- and dose-specific manners (13, 14). 
Thus, anesthesia may be used to manipulate both EEG spectra and 
cardiopulmonary function and differentially regulate glymphatic 
influx. To test this hypothesis, we systematically compared glym-
phatic influx in mice under anesthesia with six anesthetic regimens. 
Groups of mice were anesthetized with K/X, pentobarbital, Avertin 
(2,2,2-tribromoethanol), -chloralose, ISO supplemented with dex, 
and ISO alone. To establish how neural activity in conjunction with 
altered cardiopulmonary function controlled glymphatic influx, we 
recorded EEG and cardiopulmonary parameters in a separate co-
hort of mice under the same anesthetic conditions. Our analysis 
demonstrates that glymphatic influx occurs in direct proportion to 
the power of cortical delta wave activity, in inverse proportion to 
heart rate, and was most pronounced under K/X anesthesia.
RESULTS
Anesthesia alters spatial distribution of CSF tracer
We investigated how a broad range of anesthesia types influences 
the movement of CSF tracer from the subarachnoid space into the 
perivascular spaces of the brain and ultimately into the parenchy-
ma. A previous analysis has shown that tracers injected into the ro-
dent cisterna magna (CM) quickly distribute to the base of the brain 
and into the perivascular space of the circle of Willis (1). To visual-
ize the perivascular space of the circle of Willis and the major cere-
bral arteries, including the middle cerebral artery, we first analyzed 
fluorescence tracer distribution at the base (ventral) and top (dorsal) 
surfaces of brains harvested under different anesthetic conditions. 
In all experiments, the tracer (bovine serum albumin, Alexa Fluor 
647 conjugate; 66 kDa) was injected into the CM and allowed to 
distribute for 30 min before brain collection. As in our previous stud-
ies, tracer signal was higher on the ventral than on the dorsal aspect 
of the brain (Fig. 1). Tracer distribution was highest, as measured by

mean pixel intensity (MPI) across the region of interest (ROI), un-
der K/X anesthesia both on the dorsal (Fig. 1C and table S1) and 
ventral sides (Fig. 1C and table S1). Mice under ISO anesthesia sup-
plemented with dex also displayed pronounced distribution of the 
tracer on the ventral and dorsal aspects of the brain, in agreement 
with previous findings (7). Pentobarbital exhibited intermediate CSF 
labeling on the ventral and dorsal brain surfaces. In contrast, mice 
anesthetized with Avertin, -chloralose, and ISO alone all displayed 
poor tracer dispersion, especially on the ventral side of the brain, 
compared to the other anesthesia regimens.
We next prepared 100-m-thick coronal sections through the 
brains and quantified the mean pixel fluorescence intensity across 
six slices collected at 600-m intervals starting at 1.1 mm anterior to 
the bregma to calculate the mean total tracer influx per entire brain 
(Fig. 2and fig. S1). This analysis showed results concurring closely 
with the dorsal and ventral analyses, with the K/X-anesthetized mice 
exhibiting significantly higher influx (Fig. 2, A and B, and table S1). 
Supplementing ISO with dex also significantly increased the MPI 
compared to the ISO alone group, whereas MPI in brain slices were 
low in mice anesthetized with Avertin, -chloralose, or ISO alone. 
Next, we tested whether tracer distribution under anesthesia varied 
according to brain region. A subregion analysis of ventral cortex, 
lateral cortex, dorsal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothal-
amus revealed a similar pattern of tracer fluorescence as the aver-
aged coronal sections across anesthetic groups (fig. S2 and table S1). 
Furthermore, to ensure that our signal is driven by tracer entering 
along the perivascular space and into the parenchyma, as compared 
to reflux into the ventricles or in the remaining arachnoid space of 
the extracted brain, we measured fluorescence specifically in the in-
terior cortex and striatum (fig. S3). As with both the coronal section 
average and the subregion analysis, K/X had increased influx com-
pared to the other anesthetic regimens in the interior brain.
We then compared dorsal and ventral fluorescent values to average 
slice fluorescence for each animal and conducted linear regression 
analysis between individual slice MPI and dorsal/ventral tracer inten-
sity, respectively. This analysis showed a slightly better correlation be-
tween ventral tracer distributions than dorsal tracer distributions with 
total slice MPI (R2 = 0.871 versus 0.817, P < 0.0001 in both cases) (Fig. 2, 
C and D). We saw similar significant linear regressions between the 
interior slice analysis and dorsal, ventral, and total slice MPIs (fig. S3), 
thus demonstrating that tracer distribution along the ventral and dorsal 
brain surface is proportional to influx into the brain parenchyma.
Because duration under anesthesia may alter how much CSF can 
move into the brain parenchyma, we anesthetized a group of animals 
with ISO for 2 hours before a standard CM injection of CSF tracer. We 
found that total tracer influx matched that in animals injected with 
CSF tracer within 15 min of anesthesia, indicating that long-term ISO 
anesthesia does not affect overall glymphatic function (fig. S4).
Delta band EEG power correlates strongly with glymphatic 
influx during anesthesia
We next asked whether neural activity patterns during anesthesia 
were proportional to glymphatic tracer influx. Previous work from 
our laboratory has demonstrated that fluid movement along the

perivascular space is increased during sleep and K/X anesthesia (5). 
We propose that this could be a consequence of the high prevalence 
of delta band power or slow 1 to 4 Hz oscillations of highly synchro-
nized neuronal activity in those conditions. To test this relationship, 
we measured EEG activity under the six different anesthesia regimens 
in a separate cohort of mice (Fig. 3 and fig. S5). Power spectrum 
analysis of the EEG recordings showed that K/X-anesthetized mice 
exhibited the highest power of delta wave oscillations (Fig. 3, A and B, 
and fig. S5A). Mice under ISO anesthesia supplemented with dex 
had significantly higher percent prevalence of delta power compared 
to the mice administered ISO alone (for exact P values, see table S1). 
There was no significant difference between the ISO and ISO sup-
plemented with dex groups for any other frequency band of the EEG. 
Mice treated with other anesthetics showed intermediate percent 
prevalence of delta band power.
To determine whether tracer influx had an overall correlation 
with EEG, we conducted a linear regression analysis of tracer influx 
(slice MPIs) across all six anesthetic agents against EEG band powers. 
The prevalence of the delta band was highly predictive of the MPI 
across the six anesthetic groups (Fig. 3B). Of the EEG bands, beta 
power (13 to 20 Hz) had the highest correlation value but made up 
less than 10% of the overall EEG signal (Fig. 3C). Neither theta (4 to 
8 Hz) nor alpha (8 to 13 Hz) power correlated significantly with 
slice MPIs across the entire group of mice (Fig. 3, D and E).
Heart rate is inversely related to glymphatic influx
Many factors can conceivably influence brain vasculature and peri-
vascular fluid movement, including intracranial pressure, blood pres-
sure, heart rate, and respiratory rate (4). However, we observed no 
significant difference in intracranial pressure between our anesthetic 
groups [analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, F (5,27) = 0.4805, P = 0.7876; 
fig. S6] and thus did not include intracranial pressure in our analyses. 
We then systematically measured blood pressure, heart rate, and 
respiratory rate under the different anesthesia conditions within the 
same animals from the EEG study (Fig. 4). Mice treated with K/X, 
the anesthetic combination associated with the greatest tracer in-
flux, had the lowest mean heart rate (fig. S7 and table S1). The only 
outcome influenced by dex was heart rate, which exhibited a signifi-
cant decrease compared to ISO alone. Pentobarbital, -chloralose, 
ISO, and Avertin mouse groups all showed intermediate systolic 
blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. To better understand 
how these anesthetic-induced cardiopulmonary changes correlated 
to CSF tracer influx, we again performed a linear regression analysis 
between the group-wise means of slice MPIs and the various pa-
rameters. Of the three parameters, only heart rate had a significant 
(negative) correlation with tracer influx (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that the choice of anesthetic agent can 
greatly influence CSF tracer influx. We probed the relationship be-
tween glymphatic influx with neuronal network activity (as mea-
sured by EEG) and cardiopulmonary parameters. Our analysis showed 
that the power of slow wave delta oscillations between 1 and 4 Hz 
was especially correlated to high influx of CSF tracers into the brain. 
Beta power also had some predictive value but accounted for less 
than 10% of the overall EEG signal. Neither alpha nor gamma wave 
powers correlated with glymphatic tracer influx. Heart rate under 
anesthesia exhibited a strong inverse relationship with glymphatic 
influx, whereas neither respiratory rate nor systolic blood pressure 
correlated to CSF tracer influx. ISO, Avertin, and -chloralose an-
esthesia resulted in the lowest amount of fluorescent tracer uptake

in the brain, whereas mice anesthetized with pentobarbital anesthesia 
showed intermediate tracer influx. Consistent with previous work (7), 
the suppression of glymphatic activity by ISO was partially counter-
acted by supplementation with the 2 agonist dex, while influx was 
highest in the K/X anesthesia group. These findings were seen con-
sistently in the dorsal and ventral brain and throughout coronal 
sections of the brain. We conclude that K/X is the preferred agent 
among those tested here for mouse studies of CSF movement into 
and through the brain parenchyma.
The glymphatic model of bulk flow of fluid through the perivas-
cular spaces in the brain has recently evoked controversies (8, 15–17). 
The publications disputing the original findings have in common their 
use of multiple different types of anesthetics. For example, one paper 
challenging the glymphatic model uses Avertin (8), which we here show 
to be a poor choice of anesthetic for promoting tracer influx. In another 
study entailing CM tracer injections under ISO anesthesia, tracer dis-
tribution decreased with increased ISO concentration. That same study 
reported no increased influx under K/X anesthesia compared to awake 
animals, yet the initial infusion of tracer was performed under ISO, 
essentially mixing anesthetics in the experimental design (17). While 
it is unclear why these different compounds, with different mecha-
nisms of action, enable or impair fluid movement within brain tissue, 
careful selection of an anesthetic agent emerges as a key factor in the 
novel biological system of glymphatic fluid transport.
The glymphatic system is regulated by the sleep-wake cycle, and 
we show that increased delta band power and decreased heart rate 
are correlated to improved glymphatic flow. In instances of sleep dis-
ruption, such as insomnia, the prevalence of the delta band in the 
first non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep of the night diminishes 
while the heart rate variability increases (18–20). Conversely, sleep 
occurring after prolonged sleep deprivation has higher incidence of 
delta power (21), and heart rate variability can be used as an accurate 
measure of EEG-scored vigilance state during sleep deprivation (22). 
By understanding the interplay between these three adjacent systems— 
neuronal circuitry, glymphatic fluid movement, and vasculature—
we can better understand homeostatic processes such as sleep and 
arousal. One important observation that can be drawn from our study 
is that the pharmacodynamics mechanism of anesthetic-induced 
unconsciousness, i.e., N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) 
antagonism or allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors, appears 
to be less important for glymphatic function than the effect of the 
anesthetics on slow delta wave or heart rate.
Of the six anesthetic agents tested here, ISO and dex are widely used 
in the clinic. Our analysis showed that anesthesia with ISO alone im-
pedes glymphatic function, while dex has the opposite effect. These ob-
servations may provide insight into the known clinical effects of ISO 
and dex. Long-term sedation in intensive care units and general anes-
thesia for surgery are associated with cognitive disturbances, especially

in the elderly population (23). Patients receiving inhalation anesthetics 
exhibit a high rate of delirium upon emergence from anesthesia (24). 
Conversely, prophylactic dex decreased the incidence of delirium in 
the postoperative setting compared with placebo (25). Several ran-
domized controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of dex to 
GABAA agonists, specifically benzodiazepines and propofol, in main-
taining cognitive performance in intensive care patients (26–28). This 
clinical finding fits well with our results that dex and xylazine both 
enhance CSF influx into the brain, while ISO reduces glymphatic 
function. Although the involvement of the glymphatic system in cog-
nitive performance and delirium remains to be established, it is com-
pelling to hypothesize that promoting CSF delivery to the brain and 
improving clearance of metabolic waste present a mechanism ex-
plaining why dex decreases the incidence, while inhalation anesthesia 
increases the incidence of delirium. Previous preclinical studies have 
shown that inhalation anesthetics increase  amyloid accumulation 
in vivo (29) and promote its oligomerization in vitro (30). Both find-
ings are consistent with a detrimental effect of ISO anesthesia on both 
glymphatic flow and neurotoxic effects of  amyloid.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the proper choice of 
an anesthetic, one which increases delta power and reduces heart 
rates, is essential for optimizing glymphatic function in preclinical 
rodent studies. Moreover, understanding ways to support proper peri-
vascular fluid flow may prove crucial for rapid cognitive recovery 
following anesthesia in the clinic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Male and female C57BL/6 mice (ages 3 to 5 months and weight between 
25 and 30 g) were acquired from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, 
MA, USA) in equal numbers for each experimental group to control for 
any potential sex differences. Mice were group-housed in a 12-hour light/ 
12-hour dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All ex-
periments were performed in the light phase of the light/dark cycle.

Center Committee on Animal Resources. All efforts were made to 
keep animal usage to a minimum.
Drugs
Anesthesia was administered as follows: a mixture of racemic ketamine 
(100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (ip), pentobar-
bital (60 mg/kg ip), 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (also known as Avertin; 
120 mg/kg ip), -chloralose (80 mg/kg ip), and ISO (initial induction 
at 4%, maintained at 1 to 2% for the duration of the experiment). 
For the -chloralose regimen, surgery was initially done under 1 to 
2% ISO and maintained at 0.5% ISO following CM injection because 
the drug is technically a hypnotic rather than a general anesthetic. 
In a separate cohort of mice, dex was given as a supplement to ISO in-
duction at 0.015 mg/kg ip, with a second equal-sized bolus adminis-
tered just before the 30-min tracer circulation period. ISO was always 
delivered with 100% oxygen. Depth of anesthesia was determined by 
the pedal reflex test. If the mouse responded to toe pinch an additional 
1/10 of the initial dosage was given and the tracer experiment was de-
layed until full unconsciousness was obtained. Directly before CM 
infusion, the animal received an additional 1/10 of the initial dosage, and 
the pedal reflex was tested every 5 to 10 min during the tracer circula-
tion time to ensure proper anesthesia throughout the study. Animals 
under Avertin anesthesia were most likely to need supplemental dos-
ing. For mechanisms of action of each drug, please see Table 1.
Intracisternal CSF tracer infusion
The fluorescent CSF tracer (bovine serum albumin, Alexa Fluor 647 
conjugate, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA; 66 kDa) 
was formulated in artificial CSF at a concentration of 0.5% (w/v). 
Anesthetized mice were fixed in a stereotaxic frame, the CM was 
surgically exposed, and a 30-gauge needle connected to PE10 tub-
ing filled with the tracer was inserted into the CM. Ten microliters 
of CSF tracer was infused at a rate of 2 l/min for 5 min with a 
syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) (31). All experiments were 
done by the same operator, in a semi-interleaved fashion. Group 
data were repeated over at least two experimental days to ensure re-
producibility. To visualize tracer movement from the cisternal com-
partments into the brain parenchyma, the animals were euthanized 
by decapitation and the brain was removed 30 min after the start of 
intracisternal infusion (note that the needle was left in place after 
the infusion). The brain was fixed overnight by immersion in 4% 
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Coronal vibratome 
slices (100 m) were cut and mounted. Tracer influx into the brain 
was imaged ex vivo by macroscopic whole-brain and whole-slice 
conventional fluorescence microscopy (Olympus; Stereo Investi-
gator Software).
Tracer influx was quantified independently by two sets of blinded 
investigators using FIJI (ImageJ) software, as described previously 
(1). Each coronal slice was manually outlined, and the mean fluo-
rescence intensity within the ROIs was measured. Average fluores-
cence intensity was calculated across six slices for a single animal, 
resulting in a single biological replicate. Equivalent slices were used 
for all biological replicates.
Population-based average intensity image generation
To allow qualitative visual comparison of the effects of individual 
anesthetics on CSF tracer influx, a population-based average com-
bining the images from all anesthesia groups was created for each of 
the image types: ventral and dorsal macroscopic images (Fig. 1) and 
coronal slices (Fig. 2 and fig. S3). First, an initial average template 
was computed as the mean of the nonaligned images. Then, all images 
were registered to this average template, and a new mean of the 
aligned images was computed. Registering and averaging were re-
peated with increasingly refined registration methods (four iterations 
of rigid registration, followed by two affine registration iterations 
and lastly by four nonlinear registration iterations), resulting in 
the final population-based average template. Last, all images were 
nonlinearly registered to the appropriate template to allow group 
comparisons. Image registration was performed using Advanced 
Normalization Tools (ANTs) 2.1.0 and scripted with Python 3.6.
EEG and cardiovascular outcomes experiment
EEG recordings were obtained by commercial telemetric electrodes 
(Pinnacle Technology). The head plate was mounted under 2% ISO 
anesthesia, and small burr holes were drilled in the skull 2.5 mm 
lateral and 2 mm posterior to the bregma on either side of the mid-
line. EEG wire leads were then inserted into the burr holes on one 
side of the midline between the skull and underlying dura. EEG leads 
were secured to the skull with dental acrylic. An electromyogram 
(EMG) lead was inserted in the neck muscle. The animals recovered 
for 7 days before EEG and EMG measurements were made.
A week after implantation and recovery, animals were anesthe-
tized, as above. The EEG and EMG signal was then recorded for 
10 min along with 10-min sessions in a blood pressure tail cuff to 
measure systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate 
recording for 5 min. The type of anesthesia was randomized through-
out the experiment, with each animal receiving a new anesthetic every 
3 days, thus reducing drug-ordering effect and giving the animal 
sufficient time to recover from deep anesthesia.
Anesthetized mice were placed on a thermostatic pad during EEG 
and EMG recording sessions. Signals were collected with Clampex 
10.2 (sampling rate, 1000 Hz). EEG data were analyzed using a custom-
ized MATLAB script. The Chronux toolbox (http://chronux.org/) 
was used to calculate relative and absolute power of each band (delta, 
1 to 4 Hz; theta, 4 to 8 Hz; alpha, 8 to 13 Hz; and beta, 13 to 20 Hz).
Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were monitored 
via the Small Animal Physiological Monitoring System (Harvard 
Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Here, heart rate and respiratory 
rate were reported as averages across 5 min of monitoring while under 
anesthesia. Blood pressure was monitored noninvasively by tail cuff 
with the CODA high-throughput system (Kent Scientific).
Intracranial pressure measurement
Intracranial pressure was measured through a catheter placed in the CM 
and connected to a pressure transducer and monitor (World Precision 
Instruments). The signals were digitized and recorded with a Digidata 
1550A digitizer and AxoScope software (Axon Instruments).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SD, unless otherwise noted. All statis-
tical analysis was performed in Python 3.6, MATLAB 9.3, or GraphPad 
Prism 7.0d. For comparisons of means in samples with normal distri-
butions and homogeneous variances (as indicated by a Levene’s test), 
ANOVA was used for comparisons between two or more means, fol-
lowed by Bonferroni P value correction for multiple comparisons. In 
cases of a non-normal distribution (as indicated by a Shapiro Wilk 
test) or unequal variances (Levene’s test), a nonparametric Kruskal- 
Wallis test was used for comparisons between two or more means,

followed by Bonferroni P value correction for multiple comparisons. 
Linear least squares regression was used for calculation of correla-
tions between group averages of EEG band powers, cardiovascular 
measures, and tracer MPIs. Significance was ascribed at P < 0.05.
