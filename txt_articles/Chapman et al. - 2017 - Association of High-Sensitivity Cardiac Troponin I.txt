IMPORTANCE High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing is widely used to evaluate patients
with suspected acute coronary syndrome. A cardiac troponin concentration of less than
5 ng/L identifies patients at presentation as low risk, but the optimal threshold is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of a cardiac troponin I threshold of 5 ng/L at
presentation as a risk stratification tool in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.
DATA SOURCES Systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science
databases from January 1, 2006, to March 18, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Prospective studies measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
concentrations in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in which the diagnosis
was adjudicated according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The systematic review identified 19 cohorts. Individual
patient-level data were obtained from the corresponding authors of 17 cohorts, with
aggregate data from 2 cohorts. Meta-estimates for primary and secondary outcomes were
derived using a binomial-normal random-effects model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was myocardial infarction or cardiac
death at 30 days. Performance was evaluated in subgroups and across a range of troponin
concentrations (2-16 ng/L) using individual patient data.
RESULTS Of 11 845 articles identified, 104 underwent full-text review, and 19 cohorts from 9
countries were included. Among 22 457 patients included in the meta-analysis (mean age, 62
[SD, 15.5] years; n = 9329 women [41.5%]), the primary outcome occurred in 2786 (12.4%).
Cardiac troponin I concentrations were less than 5 ng/L at presentation in 11 012 patients
(49%), in whom there were 60 missed index or 30-day events (59 index myocardial
infarctions, 1 myocardial infarction at 30 days, and no cardiac deaths at 30 days). This
resulted in a negative predictive value of 99.5% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.6%) for the primary
outcome. There were no cardiac deaths at 30 days and 7 (0.1%) at 1 year, with a negative
predictive value of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.7%-99.9%) for cardiac death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome,
a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration of less than 5 ng/L identified those at low
risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death within 30 days. Further research is needed to
understand the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this approach to risk stratification.

hest pain is one of the most common reasons for
presentation to hospitals worldwide.1 Despite the
majority of patients not having myocardial infarc-
tion,2 hospital admission for observation and serial car-
diac troponin testing is required in many patients to identify
those with and without myocardial infarction.3 Novel
strategies to identify low-risk patients at presentation
have been proposed to reduce hospital admissions, serial
testing, and resource utilization as well as to improve care
for patients.4,5
High-sensitivity assays are able to quantify cardiac
troponin at low concentrations and provide an opportunity
to rule out myocardial infarction at an earlier stage. In a pro-
spective study of consecutive patients with suspected acute
coronary syndrome, a risk stratification threshold was
defined using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay.
In 4870 patients, a threshold of less than 5 ng/L had a nega-
tive predictive value (NPV) of 99.6%, misclassifying less
than 1 myocardial infarction for every 200 patients tested.6
This threshold identified more than half of all patients
with suspected acute coronary syndrome as low risk, reduc-
ing the proportion of patients who require admission for
serial testing.7
Recent studies have questioned whether 5 ng/L is the
optimal threshold to risk-stratify patients and have proposed
alternative thresholds that may miss fewer patients with
myocardial infarction.8-11 To investigate these concerns, a
systematic review of all studies of high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin I testing in patients with suspected acute coronary
syndrome was undertaken and individual patient-level data
were obtained. Across multiple cohorts with varying preva-
lence of myocardial infarction, the aim was to evaluate the
performance of this threshold, to evaluate other risk stratifi-
cation thresholds, and to determine the association with
other clinical risk characteristics.
Methods
Search Strategy and Selection of Articles
A systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane,
and Web of Science databases was performed without lan-
guagerestrictionfromJanuary1,2006,toMarch18,2017,using
detailed search terms for chest pain, acute coronary syn-
drome, acute myocardial infarction, troponin, high sensitive/
sensitivity, and emergency department (Figure 1; eAppendix 1
in the Supplement contains the full search strategy). Stud-
ies were included if they met the following prespecified
eligibility criteria: (1) were prospective studies of patients in-
vestigated in the emergency department for suspected acute
coronary syndrome; (2) measured cardiac troponin using the
Abbott ARCHITECTSTAT high-sensitive cardiac troponin I
assay (Abbott Laboratories) at presentation; and (3) had an ad-
judicated end point of myocardial infarction on index hospi-
talization (eAppendixes 2 and 3 in the Supplement). All find-
ings are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual
Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD).12
Data Extraction
Two investigators (A.R.C. and K.K.L.) performed the initial
screening of titles and abstracts. Full-text reports of poten-
tially relevant articles were obtained and assessed by both
investigators using a prespecified protocol (PROSPERO reg-
ister CRD42017059128). A third investigator (A.S.V.S.) adju-
dicated all disagreements. When there were multiple
articles describing the same cohort, the article that included
the largest number of participants was included. The corre-
sponding authors of each eligible cohort were contacted
with a request for anonymized data including cardiac tro-
ponin concentrations, adjudicated diagnosis, outcomes,
and prespecified covariates (age, sex, chest pain, time from
symptom onset to presentation sample, myocardial ische-
mia on electrocardiogram, cigarette smoking, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, known angina, pre-
vious myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary inter-
vention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and stroke).
All studies were prospective and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki with approval from the
regional ethics committee or institutional review board, and
written consent was obtained where required. This approval
permitted each contributor to share individual-level data or
aggregate data for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Bias was
assessed by 2 investigators independently, with consensus
from a third, using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
Accuracy Studies version 2 (QUADAS-2) framework (eAp-
pendix 4 in the Supplement).
Analysis Population and Primary Outcome
The analysis population comprised patients with cardiac
troponin concentrations at or below the 99th percentile at
presentation (those above the 99th percentile have evi-
dence of myocardial injury and are not eligible for risk
stratification at presentation). Patients with ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction and those who presented in
cardiac arrest were excluded from this analysis. The pre-
specified primary outcome was a composite of type 1 myo-
cardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The prespeci-
fied secondary outcomes were recurrent myocardial
infarction and cardiac death at 1 year. In addition, we evalu-
ated the performance of cardiac troponin thresholds for the
Key Points
Question What is the optimal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
concentration at presentation to risk-stratify patients with
suspected acute coronary syndrome?
Findings In an individual patient-level meta-analysis of 22 457
patients from 9 countries, troponin I concentrations were less
than 5 ng/L in 49%, among whom 5 per 1000 patients had a
myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days.
Meaning Among patients with suspected acute coronary
syndrome, a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I threshold of
less than 5 ng/L identified patients at low risk of cardiac
events; further research is needed to assess the clinical utility
of this test.

 diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction on index
presentation. The number of patients available for each
analysis is shown in Figure 1.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics are summarized as mean (standard
deviation) or median (interquartile range) as appropriate.
The primary outcome measure was the NPV of a high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration of less than
5 ng/L at presentation. All cardiac troponin concentrations
were rounded to integer values in line with clinical stan-
dards for reporting. When individual patient-level data were
available, this was checked for consistency and complete-
ness, and cohort-level summary counts of patients with and
without the primary outcome were derived for a high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration of less than
5 ng/L at presentation. In cohorts in which raw data were
not available, the corresponding authors were asked to pro-
vide these summaries. The NPV was calculated at a cohort
level using a Bayesian approach, with a binomial likelihood
and beta prior (a noninformative Jeffreys prior with both
shape parameters equal to 0.5), as this produces confidence
intervals with better coverage when proportions are close to
0 or 1.13 Heterogeneity is reported using the I2 statistic.14
Survival free from cardiac death at 30 days and at 1 year is
reported for patients with cardiac troponin I concentrations
of less than 5 ng/L, 5 ng/L to the 99th percentile, and greater
than the 99th percentile at presentation.

 Prespecified Subgroup Analyses
For the primary outcome, the NPV was evaluated in pre-
specified subgroups stratified by age (≤65 or >65 years), sex,
history of ischemic heart disease, time since symptom onset
(≤2 or >2 hours), and presence of myocardial ischemia on
electrocardiogram. Most cohorts defined myocardial ische-
mia as at least 2-mm ST-segment depression in 2 consecu-
tive leads or new T-wave inversion. To explore the clinical
implications of differences in performance between sub-
groups, we undertook these subgroup analyses in patients
without myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram. Studies
have demonstrated imperfect calibration between high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin I and T assays, with up to 17.5%
of patients greater than the 99th percentile on the T assay
shown to be less than the 99th percentile on the I assay.15
Therefore, a further analysis evaluated whether the assay
used to adjudicate the index diagnosis affected the perfor-
mance of the risk stratification threshold. In addition, we
determined whether the assessed risk of bias and site of
patient recruitment affected the NPV.
Derivation of Meta-estimates
Meta-estimates of the NPV were derived in the analy-
sis population for all primary and secondary outcomes by
modeling cohort-level proportions (true negative/[true
negative + false negative]) in a binomial-normal random-
effects model, with an additional term when cohort-level
characteristics (adjudication assay, assessment of bias or
location of recruitment) were compared. We estimated
odds ratios for the difference in NPV between prespecified
subgroups, meta-analyzing this across cohorts to ob-
tain the mean odds ratio and a P value for the null hypoth-
esis of no association. For cohorts in which individual
patient-level data were available, the cardiac troponin
threshold that would identify the highest proportion of
patients as at low risk for an NPV at or above 99.5% was
determined. For this analysis, we prespecified an NPV of
99.5% as being clinically acceptable and equivalent to a
miss rate of 5 per 1000 low-risk patients.16 To evaluate how
the inclusion of a risk stratification threshold would affect
the overall diagnosis in all patients with suspected acute
coronary syndrome, meta-estimates of NPV, positive predic-
tive value (PPV), and sensitivity were derived for risk strati-
fication thresholds alone (2-16 ng/L) and in conjunction
with a nonischemic electrocardiogram result at presenta-
tion. At each threshold, the proportion of the total popula-
tion classified as low risk and the miss rate per 1000
patients was reported. All analyses were performed in R ver-
sion 3.2.2, with the meta-analyses performed using the
metafor package.17 The analysis code is available online
(eAppendix 5 in the Supplement).
Results
Systematic Review
The initial search identified 11 845 articles, of which 104
articles underwent full-text review. A total of 36 articles met
inclusion criteria, reporting observations from 19 individual
cohorts across 9 different countries (Figure 1). Five articles
reported outcomes for a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
concentration of less than 5 ng/L.6,8-10,18
Study Population
All corresponding authors from the 19 individual cohorts
identified in the systematic review agreed to provide data
for the meta-analysis. Individual patient-level data were
obtained from 17 cohorts6-9,11,18-29 and aggregate data from 2
cohorts,10,30 for a total study population of 22 457 patients
with suspected acute coronary syndrome (mean age, 62 [SD,
16] years; 41.5% women) (Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). In 11
cohorts, data were available for the prespecified primary out-
come of type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at
30 days (Table 4). In the remainder, the outcome was index
type 1 myocardial infarction (n = 1) or non–ST-segment eleva-
tion myocardial infarction on index presentation (n = 5) or
at 30 days (n = 2). The assessed risk of bias was high in 11
cohorts because of patient selection or use of a contemporary
reference standard (eAppendixes 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
Across all cohorts, the proportion with the primary outcome
was 12.4% (range, 2.4%-24.0%). The analysis population
comprised 18 248 of 22 457 patients in which high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin I concentrations were below the 99th per-
centile at presentation, and the prevalence of the primary
outcome was 3.5% (range, 0.6%-6.1%).
Meta-estimate of the Risk Stratification Threshold
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were less
than 5 ng/L at presentation in 11 012 patients (49%), with an
NPV of 99.5% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.6%) (Figure 2 and Table 2)
for the primary outcome and a total of 60 missed index or
30-day events (59 index myocardial infarctions, 1 myocar-
dial infarction at 30 days, and no cardiac deaths at 30 days)
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). The NPV was similar across
cohorts with varying prevalence of myocardial infarction.
The estimate of heterogeneity (I2) was 31.9%. Cohort-level
2×2 summary tables are provided for the analysis popula-
tion in eTable 2 in the Supplement. When data were avail-
able in the analysis population (n = 16 537 [90.6%]), we
estimated the NPV for the secondary outcome of index
non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (type 1 or
type 2 myocardial infarction). Cardiac troponin I concentra-
tions were less than 5 ng/L at presentation in 9574 patients
(48%), with an NPV of 99.4% (95% CI, 99.2%-99.6%) and
a total of 58 missed events.
Subgroup Analysis
Meta-estimates of NPV were obtained in a number of pre-
specified subgroups (Figure 3). The NPV was lower in those
with (98.2%; 95% CI, 96.4%-99.1% [n = 2178]) compared
with those without (99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%-99.8%
[n = 13 709]) myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram
(P < .001) and in those who presented within 2 hours of
symptom onset (99.0% [95% CI, 97.7%-99.5%] [n = 2303] vs
99.6% [95% CI, 99.4%-99.8%] [n = 11 101]; P = .003). Differ-
ences in the NPV were also observed between patients older

When this analysis was restricted to patients without myo-
cardial ischemia on electrocardiogram, estimates of NPV
were higher than 99% for all subgroups (eFigure 1 in the

was similar regardless of the assay used for adjudication

ure 2 in the Supplement).
Short- and Long-term Outcomes
According to the Risk Stratification Threshold
Follow-up data for cardiac death at 30 days and at 1 year
were available in 12 953 patients (57.7%) and 9271 patients
(41.3%), respectively (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
In patients with cardiac troponin concentrations of less than
5 ng/L at presentation (n = 6956), there were no cardiac
deaths at 30 days (NPV, 100% [95% CI, 99.9%-100%]; sensi-
tivity, 99.4% [95% CI, 97.7%-100%]) and 7 cardiac deaths
(0.1%) at 1 year (NPV, 99.9% [95% CI, 99.7%-99.9%]; sensi-
tivity, 96.1% [95% CI, 92.9%-98.3%]). In patients with car-
diac troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th
percentile at presentation (n = 3817), there were 19 cardiac
deaths at 30 days (0.5%) and 58 (2.1%) at 1 year. In compari-
son, in those with troponin concentrations above the 99th
percentile (n = 2180), there were 62 cardiac deaths at 30
days (2.8%) and 125 (8.2%) at 1 year. In patients with tro-
ponin concentrations of less than 5 ng/L at presentation and
an index or 30-day myocardial infarction, there were no car-
diac deaths at 30 days or at 1 year. Because the majority of
studies did not adjudicate recurrent myocardial infarction
events at 1 year, we were not able to conduct this prespeci-
fied analysis.

 Risk Stratification Thresholds and Diagnosis
of Myocardial Infarction
In all patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome for
whom individual patient-level data were available (n = 18 601
[82.8%]), we evaluated how different risk stratification
thresholds would affect the NPV and sensitivity for the pri-
mary outcome. When used in isolation, a troponin I concen-
tration of less than 5 ng/L gave an NPV of 99.5% (95% CI,
99.3%-99.7%) and a sensitivity of 98.0% (95% CI, 96.4%-
98.9%), identifying 49.1% of patients as low risk with a miss
rate of 5.4 (95% CI, 4.0-7.0) per 1000 patients. At a threshold
of less than 2 ng/L, the NPV was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.0%-
100%) and the sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 98.9%-100%),
but the proportion of patients identified as low risk was lower
at 13.7%. Although the absolute number of missed cases was
lower, the miss rate was similar at 4.1 (95% CI, 2.0-6.9) per
1000 patients (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
In a subgroup analysis combining risk stratification
thresholds and a nonischemic electrocardiogram result
(Figure 4), a cardiac troponin I concentration of less than
5 ng/L gave an NPV of 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4%-99.8%) and a
sensitivity of 99.0% (95% CI, 97.3%-99.6%), identifying

 45.9% of patients as low risk, with 4.4 (95% CI, 3.0-6.0)
false negatives per 1000 patients and a PPV of 24.5% (95%
CI, 20.3%-29.2%). The combination of a cardiac troponin I
concentration of less than 2 ng/L and a nonischemic electro-
cardiogram result gave a similar NPV of 99.9% (95% CI,
98.5%-100%) and a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 96.6%-
100%) but identified just 13.1% of patients as low risk, with
4.1 (95% CI, 1.8-7.3) false negatives per 1000 patients and
a lower PPV of 14.2% (95% CI, 11.3%-17.6%).
Discussion
In 19 cohorts across 9 countries and encompassing more than
22 000 patients, a cardiac troponin I concentration of less than
5 ng/L at presentation identified half of all patients with sus-
pected acute coronary syndrome as at low risk of myocardial
infarction or cardiac death at 30 days, with 5 false negatives
per 1000 patients tested.
There are a number of strengths to the analysis. This
was a prespecified systematic review and meta-analysis that
included individual patient-level data from all cohorts iden-
tified. The findings were consistent across a range of health
care settings and geographic regions with considerable dif-
ferences in the prevalence of myocardial infarction. Indi-
vidual patient-level data were included from more than
22 000 patients, allowing a meaningful analysis of impor-
tant subgroups. All studies were prospective, and in all
studies the final diagnosis was adjudicated according to the
universal definition of myocardial infarction.
Two recent meta-analyses have suggested an approach to
risk stratification using the limit of detection of the high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay, which identifies up to 31%
of patients with an NPV of 99.3%.31,32 The limit of detection
of the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay identifies 19%
to 27% of patients as low risk with an NPV of 99.5% or
greater.8-10 The major limitation of this approach for both as-
says is analytical, with biases and analytical variation at the

are twice that observed at 5 ng/L.33,34
In clinical practice, cardiac troponin concentrations are
interpreted in conjunction with the electrocardiogram and
clinical assessment. When a risk stratification threshold of
less than 5 ng/L was evaluated in the subgroup of patients
without myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram, the
NPV and sensitivity were excellent. To ensure that safety
estimates were conservative, performance was evaluated
not just for an index diagnosis but for a composite end point
that included events up to 30 days. Although there were 81
cardiac deaths at 30 days, none occurred in the 6956
patients with cardiac troponin I concentrations less than
5 ng/L. Furthermore, performance was similar for both
spontaneous type 1 and secondary type 2 myocardial infarc-
tion. This is relevant because the diagnosis of type 2 myo-
cardial infarction is more challenging and is associated with
a worse prognosis.35-37
At a threshold of 5 ng/L, the analytical performance of
the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay is excellent.6,38
The use of lower thresholds did not improve diagnostic
accuracy. A miss rate of 5 per 1000 patients was observed
when applying less than 5 ng/L as the risk stratification
threshold, with a miss rate of 4 per 1000 patients observed
at a threshold of less than 2 ng/L. Although the true risk of
missing an individual patient with myocardial infarction is
the same at both thresholds, lower thresholds reduce the
proportion of patients classified as at low risk; only 1 in 10
patients had a troponin I concentration of less than 2 ng/L
compared with 5 in 10 patients a with concentration of less
than 5 ng/L. Use of lower thresholds would result in more
patients without myocardial infarction being admitted for
serial testing and further investigation, with an increase in
health care expenditures.
Despite recent changes to guidelines,5 the majority of
clinicians continue to rely on the 99th percentile to rule in
and rule out myocardial infarction.39 A pathway incorporat-
ing a risk stratification threshold of less than 5 ng/L along-
side nonischemic electrocardiogram findings misses 5-fold
fewer index myocardial infarctions or 30-day events than
guideline-approved pathways based exclusively on the 99th
percentile.7 This limitation of the 99th percentile has now
been demonstrated in multiple studies.25,40 This approach
to risk stratification using low high-sensitivity cardiac tro-
ponin concentrations has major potential to improve both
the efficiency of health care delivery and patient safety and
is being formally evaluated in a prospective multicenter
clinical trial (NCT03005158).
This study has several limitations. First, not all cohorts
used identical protocols, with differences both in the inclu-
sion criteria and the diagnostic criteria used for adjudication
(eAppendix 3 in the Supplement). However, no significant
differences in NPV were observed when stratified by adjudi-
cating assay, and the NPV was high across individual cohorts,
suggesting that these findings are generalizable. Second, the
percentage of patients who presented early after onset of

 symptoms was low at just 10% of the study population.
Despite observing an NPV of 99% in this subgroup, inconsis-
tencies in the documentation of symptom onset across
cohorts may affect the analysis, and until further research is
available, serial testing is recommended in patients present-
ing within 2 hours of symptom onset.5 The greatest number
of false negatives was observed in the cohort with the short-
est median symptom onset to sample time (179 [interquartile
range, 119-349] minutes), which may explain the lower NPV
and sensitivity reported at this threshold in a previous
study.8 Third, while it is reassuring that patients with tro-
ponin I concentrations of less than 5 ng/L had a much lower
rate of cardiac death at 1 year than did patients with concen-
trations between 5 ng/L and the 99th percentile, this obser-
vation needs to be verified in prospective studies in which
patient care is guided by this approach.

 Conclusions
Among patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome,
a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration of less
than 5 ng/L at presentation identified those at low risk
of myocardial infarction or cardiac death within 30
days. Further research is needed to understand the clini-
cal utility and cost-effectiveness of this approach to risk
stratification.
