 For example, previous work at k67 (21) reported
little seasonality in leaf-scale photosynthetic
parameters, concluding that leaf-level produc-
tivity did not explain seasonality of ecosystem
productivity. However, that analysis focused on
mature leaves only, neglecting the demography
and ontogeny here shown to be critical for scal-
ing leaf-level photosynthesis to ecosystems.
At larger scales, this study supports the hy-
pothesis that leaf-demographic mechanisms un-
derlie seasonal increases in tropical vegetation
productivity seen from satellites (6, 7, 13). And,
because leaf stomates link evapotranspiration
to photosynthesis, these mechanisms may also
facilitate the dry-season maxima in water fluxes
(fig. S4). By moistening the dry-season atmo-
spheric boundary layer, these fluxes hasten tran-
sition to the wet season ahead of the southward
migration of the intertropical convergence zone
(3). Further, because dry-season water fluxes in
South America may influence the timing of the
North American Monsoon demise (22), tropical
leaf phenology may contribute to important
ecologically mediated teleconnections (23) in the
climate system.
The second implication is that leaf phenology
is needed to correctly detect, attribute, and model
climate sensitivity of tropical forests. Empirical
studies that analyze climatic sensitivity of carbon
and water fluxes without accounting for phe-
nology (24, 25) will misattribute phenological
changes to climatic causes. Models that are tuned
to match current observations while assuming
that LAI or FAPAR are aseasonal risk making
erroneous predictions of forest response to fu-
ture climate changes.
This work highlights the importance of leaf
level phenology—especially coordination of leaf
growth with senescence—in regulating land sur-
face fluxes of carbon and water, and of associated
feedbacks to climate. The causes of phenological
patterns may arise from adaptive strategies for
avoiding herbivores or pathogens (26) or for op-
timizing plant physiology for carbon gain under
seasonal resource availability (13, 27–29). Ulti-
mately, understanding the evolutionary and phys-
iological basis for phenological mechanisms may
be critical to predicting the long-term response and
resiliency of tropical forests to changing climate.

CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS
Synchronous Drosophila circadian
pacemakers display nonsynchronous
Ca2+ rhythms in vivo
Xitong Liang, Timothy E. Holy, Paul H. Taghert*
In Drosophila, molecular clocks control circadian rhythmic behavior through a network
of ~150 pacemaker neurons. To explain how the network’s neuronal properties encode
time, we performed brainwide calcium imaging of groups of pacemaker neurons in vivo for
24 hours. Pacemakers exhibited daily rhythmic changes in intracellular Ca2+ that were
entrained by environmental cues and timed by molecular clocks. However, these rhythms
were not synchronous, as each group exhibited its own phase of activation. Ca2+ rhythms
displayed by pacemaker groups that were associated with the morning or evening locomotor
activities occurred ~4 hours before their respective behaviors. Loss of the receptor for the
neuropeptide PDF promoted synchrony of Ca2+ waves. Thus, neuropeptide modulation is
required to sequentially time outputs from a network of synchronous molecular pacemakers.
C
ircadian clocks help animals adapt their
physiology and behavior to local time. The
clocks require a highly conserved set of genes
andproteins (1)operatingthroughmolecular
feedback loops to generate robust rhythms
that produce a 24-hour timing signal (2). These
clocks are expressed by pacemaker neurons, which
themselves are assembled into an interactive net-
work (3). Through network encoding and cellular
interactions, pacemaker neurons in the supra-
chiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain
coordinate many circadian rhythmic outputs (4–7).
To study how molecular clocks couple to network
encoding and how network encoding relates
to specific behavioral outputs, we conducted
an in vivo brainwide analysis of the circadian

 pacemaker network in Drosophila across an en-
tire 24-hour day.
This network contains ~150 synchronized pace-
maker neurons (8, 9) (fig. S1), yet it produces
biphasic behavioral outputs—the morning and
evening peaks of locomotor activity (Fig. 1A).
The molecular clocks are entrained by environ-
mental cues and by network interactions, for
example, by release of the neuropeptide PDF
(pigment-dispersing factor) (10). Genetic mosaic
studies indicate that morning and evening peaks
of locomotor activity are controlled by distinct
pacemaker groups (11–14) (Fig. 1B). We reasoned
that (i) synchronous signals from the pacemaker
network might diverge in downstream circuits or
(ii) the pacemaker network might itself generate
different timing signals to downstream circuits.
To explore this, we developed an in vivo imaging
assay to monitor the intracellular Ca2+ concen-
tration ([Ca2+]i) in pacemaker cell bodies over a
~24-hour period (Fig. 1C and supplementary
materials). Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics directly re-
flect amounts of neuronal activity, and Ca2+ im-
aging allows monitoring activity across neuronal
ensembles (15).
We used objective-coupled planar illumina-
tion (OCPI) microscopy (16), which illuminates an

 entire focal plane simultaneously; this method ac-
celerates volumetric imaging and reduces photo-
toxicity caused by repeated illumination. To permit
imaging, we made cranial holes in the heads of
living tim > GCaMP6s flies, which express the
Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s in all pacemaker neurons
(15) (Fig. 1C), and monitored [Ca2+]i in five of the
eight major pacemaker groups: small lateral neu-
ron ventral (s-LNv), large lateral neuron ventral
(l-LNv), lateral neuron dorsal (LNd), dorsal neu-
ron 1 (DN1), and dorsal neuron 3 (DN3) (Fig. 1D).
Each of the five groups displayed a prominent
peak of [Ca2+]i during the 24-hour recording
sessions, and each peak had distinct timing
(Fig. 1E). To test whether these Ca2+ dynamics
reflected intrinsic circadian patterning, we began
24-hour recording sessions at different zeitgeber
times (ZT). In all such recordings, the peaks of Ca2+
activity reflected the pacemaker group identity,
not the time at which recordings began (fig. S2).
Thus, Ca2+ varies in pacemaker neurons sys-
tematically as a function of the time of day ac-
cording to biologically defined rules of entrainment
(Fig. 1F).
Three Drosophila pacemaker groups (l-LNv,
s-LNv, and DN1p) show morning peaks of elec-
trical activity when measured in acutely dissected
brains (17–19). Thus, the phases of Ca2+ rhythms
we observed are roughly coincident with, or slight-
ly anticipate, their peak electrical activity. Ca2+
rhythms produced by different pacemaker groups
were similar in amplitude (Fig. 1F) but different
in waveform (fig. S3) and phase (Fig. 1G). We
confirmed our results using the fluorescence res-
onance energy transfer (FRET)–based cameleon2.1
imaging method (20), for which the ratio of fluo-
rescence between yellow and cyan fluorescent
proteins reflects [Ca2+]i independent of the abun-
dance of the sensor. [Ca2+]i estimated by this as-
say exhibited a factor of ~2 circadian variation,
with temporal patterns consistent with those ob-
tained with GCaMP6s (fig. S4). In addition, the
[Ca2+]i rhythms did not result from experimental
activation of CRYPTOCHROME (fig. S5). These ob-
servations demonstrate that the Drosophila pace-
maker network exhibits stereotyped and diverse
spatiotemporal patterns of Ca2+ activity during
the course of the 24-hour day.
We compared this diversity of Ca2+ activity pat-
terns with the diversity of pacemaker functions.
Pacemaker functions have been revealed by ge-
netic mosaic experiments, as exemplified by the
categorization of M (morning) and E (evening)
cells (11–14). These autonomous oscillators primar-
ily drive the morning and evening peaks of loco-
motor activity, respectively. The phase relationships
(YM,E) between the peaks of Ca2+ rhythms in ca-
nonical M (s-LNv) and E (LNd) cells and the two
daily peaks of locomotor activity were highly cor-
related (Fig. 1, H to J). In M cells, the Ca2+ rhythm
peaked toward the end of the subjective night,
whereas in E cells it peaked toward the end of
the subjective day (Fig. 1F). The ~10-hour phase
difference between Ca2+ rhythms in M and E
pacemakers is similar to the ~10-hour phase dif-
ference between the morning and evening behav-
ioral peaks (Fig. 1J). Thus, M and E pacemaker
Ca2+ activations precede by ~4 hours the behav-
ioral outputs they control. The distinct phases
of Ca2+ rhythms in the other three pacemaker
groups (l-LNv, DN1, and DN3) may also involve the
morning and evening behavioral peaks, or may
regulate other, distinct circadian-gated outputs.
The E category of pacemakers includes the
LNd as well as the fifth s-LNv (11–14). However,
the LNd is a heterogeneous group of neurons
that exhibits diverse entrainment properties (21);
likewise, the critical fifth s-LNv could not be un-
ambiguously identified with tim-GAL4. To better
understand the function of these subsets of E
pacemakers, we used a PDF receptor [pdfr(B)]
GAL4 driver (22); this driver restricts GCaMP6s
expression to s-LNv, to three of six LNds, and to
the single fifth s-LNv (Fig. 2A). The three PDFR-
expressing LNds and the fifth s-LNv displayed the
same basic E cell pattern of Ca2+ activity—a peak
in late subjective day—which suggests that they
both function as circadian pacemakers (Fig.
2B). Thus, the phase difference between Ca2+
rhythms in these PDFR-expressing M and E cell
groups again matched that between the morn-
ing and evening behavioral activity peaks (Fig.
2, C to F).
M and E cell categorization supports a clas-
sic model of seasonal adaptation (23) wherein
a two-oscillator system responds differentially
to light and so can track dawn and dusk inde-
pendently. For example, under long-day condi-
tions, light accelerates a “morning” clock and
decelerates an “evening” clock. If these Ca2+
rhythms are critical output features of M and E
cells, their properties may also reflect differences
in photoperiodic entrainment. We entrained flies
under either long-day (16 hours light, 8 hours
dark) or short-day (8 hours light, 16 hours dark)
conditions. In these flies, the phase difference
between the morning and evening behavioral
activity peaks tracked dawn and dusk (fig. S6).
Likewise, the phases of pacemaker Ca2+ rhythms
also tracked dawn and dusk (Fig. 3, A, B, E,
and F, and fig. S7). Regardless of the photo-
periodic schedule, the s-LNv (M cells) always
peaked around dawn, whereas the LNd (E cells)
always peaked before dusk (Fig. 3, B to D and
F to H). Thus, Ca2+ activity patterns within the
pacemaker network correspond to the circadian
temporal landmarks of dawn and dusk.

of behavioral phase shifts (Fig. 3N and fig. S9). The
phase difference between Ca2+ rhythm peaks in
perS M and E pacemakers still matched the phase
differencebetweenM andE behavioralpeaks(Fig. 3,
N and O). Thus, molecular clocks determine the
pace of Ca2+ rhythms in the pacemaker network.
To explore how synchronous molecular clocks
can have phases of Ca2+ activation that are stag-
gered by many hours, we tested whether PDF,
which mediates interactions between pacemakers,
was required. Flies bearing the severely hypomor-
phic han5304 mutation of the PDF receptor show

 unimodal or arrhythmic behavior patterns under
constant darkness (26) (fig. S11 and table S2). In
these flies, we found that the Ca2+ rhythms in M
cells (s-LNv and DN1) were unaffected, but they
were phase-shifted in LNd and DN3, such that
these two groups now produced Ca2+ rhythms
around dawn, roughly in synchrony with M cells
(Fig. 4, A and B). The phase of l-LNv did not
change, consistent with the absence of PDF sen-
sitivity by this pacemaker group (27). The phase
shifts in LNd and DN3 were fully restored by the
expression of complete pdfr from a bacterial ar-
tificial chromosome (BAC) transgene (Fig. 4, C to
E, “rescue 1,” and fig. S11). Thus, PDF, which pro-
motes synchronization of molecular clocks under
constant conditions (10, 28), is also needed to
properly stagger their Ca2+ activity phases across
the day. Whether the phases of the l-LNv and DN1
are set by other intercellular signals remains to be
determined.

at higher cellular resolution [pdfr(B)> GCaMP6s;
Fig. 2A]. The PDFR-expressing E cell groups (the
three PDFR-expressing LNd and the fifth s-LNv)
displayed phase shifts similar to those of the en-
tire LNd group (Fig. 4, F and G). When pdfr ex-
pression was restored just in these subsets of
pacemaker neurons (with GAL4-UAS), both be-
havior and Ca2+ rhythms were partially restored
(Fig. 4, H to J, “rescue 2,” and fig. S11 and table S2).
The phase of the fifth s-LNv was fully restored,
which suggests that PDFR signaling is required
for cell-autonomous setting of Ca2+ phase in this
pacemaker group. However, in rescue 2, a single
LNd typically remained active around dawn,
whereas two LNds were active around dusk (fig.
S12), which we interpret as a partial restoration or a
nonautonomous phase-setting mechanism for LNd.
Our results show that molecular clocks drive
circadian rhythms in the neural activity of pace-
makers. Temporally patterned neural activity en-
codes different temporal landmarks of the day in
a manner that reflects the different functions of
the pacemaker groups. The homogeneous molec-
ular clock produces sequential activity peaks by
a mechanism dependent on PDFR signaling. By
generating diverse phases of neural activity in
different pacemaker groups, the circadian clock
greatly expands its functional output.

SYNAPTIC VESICLES
Single-vesicle imaging reveals different
transport mechanisms between
glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicles
Zohreh Farsi,1 Julia Preobraschenski,1 Geert van den Bogaart,2 Dietmar Riedel,3

Synaptic transmission is mediated by the release of neurotransmitters, which involves
exo-endocytotic cycling of synaptic vesicles. To maintain synaptic function, synaptic
vesicles are refilled with thousands of neurotransmitter molecules within seconds after
endocytosis, using the energy provided by an electrochemical proton gradient. However, it
is unclear how transmitter molecules carrying different net charges can be efficiently
sequestered while maintaining charge neutrality and osmotic balance. We used single-
vesicle imaging to monitor pH and electrical gradients and directly showed different uptake
mechanisms for glutamate and g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) operating in parallel. In
contrast to glutamate, GABA was exchanged for protons, with no other ions participating in
the transport cycle. Thus, only a few components are needed to guarantee reliable vesicle
filling with different neurotransmitters.
A
ll synaptic vesicles (SVs) are energized by
vacuolar H+-dependent adenosine triphos-
phatases (V-ATPases) that pump protons
into the vesicle lumen (1) independently of
the neurotransmitter phenotype that they
contain. As a result, the vesicle interior acidifies,
resulting in a pH gradient (DpH) and an inside
positive membrane potential (Dy) that both con-
tribute to the free energy of the gradient (DmH+)
across the vesicle membrane. Shifting the balance
between Dy and DpH has profound influence on
the uptake kinetics of different neurotransmitters;
in vitro, uptake of negatively charged glutamate
is maximal when Dy dominates. In contrast, up-
take of positively charged monoamines requires
mainly DpH, whereas neutral g-amino butyric
acid (GABA) uses both components of DmH+ (2).
Because only a few hundred protons need to be
translocated to saturate DmH+, other ions must
compensate for the transport of the estimated
2000 to 5000 transmitter molecules (3, 4). How-
ever, it has been surprisingly difficult to unravel
such compensating ion fluxes and the responsi-
ble channels and/or transporters. In particular,
the transport mechanism for GABA has remained
enigmatic, with both GABA/H+ exchange and
GABA/Cl– cotransport having been proposed (5).
Mechanistic studies on vesicular transporters
are generally carried out by using highly purified
