ABSTRACT
Objective: A 2010 survey identified disparities in salaries by gender and underrepresented minorities (URM). With
an increase in the emergency medicine (EM) workforce since, we aimed to 1) describe the current status of
academic EM workforce by gender, race, and rank and 2) evaluate if disparities still exist in salary or rank by gender.
Methods: Information on demographics, rank, clinical commitment, and base and total annual salary for full-time
faculty members in U.S. academic emergency departments were collected in 2015 via the Academy of
Administrators in Academic Emergency Medicine (AAAEM) Salary Survey. Multiple linear regression was used to
compare salary by gender while controlling for confounders.
Results: Response rate was 47% (47/101), yielding data on 1,371 full-time faculty: 33% women, 78% white, 4%
black, 5% Asian, 3% Asian Indian, 4% other, and 7% unknown race. Comparing white race to nonwhite, 62%
versus 69% were instructor/assistant, 23% versus 20% were associate, and 15% versus 10% were full professors.
Comparing women to men, 74% versus 59% were instructor/assistant, 19% versus 24% were associate, and 7%
versus 17% were full professors. Of 113 chair/vice-chair positions, only 15% were women, and 18% were
nonwhite. Women were more often fellowship trained (37% vs. 31%), less often core faculty (59% vs. 64%), with
fewer administrative roles (47% vs. 57%; all p < 0.05) but worked similar clinical hours (mean � SD = 1,069 � 371
hours vs. 1,051 � 393 hours). Mean overall salary was $278,631 (SD � $68,003). The mean (�SD) salary of women
was $19,418 (�$3,736) less than men (p < 0.001), even after adjusting for race, region, rank, years of experience,
clinical hours, core faculty status, administrative roles, board certification, and fellowship training.

 Conclusions: In 2015, disparities in salary and rank persist among full-time U.S. academic EM faculty. There
were gender and URM disparities in rank and leadership positions. Women earned less than men regardless of
rank, clinical hours, or training. Future efforts should focus on evaluating salary data by race and developing
systemwide practices to eliminate disparities.
P
romoting equity, inclusion, and diversity within a
physician workforce is critical to ensure profes-
sional excellence and culturally competent patient care.
It is also an important measure toward successful
recruitment, engagement, and retention of high-quality
medical students, residents, and faculty.1 Even though
diversity in the physician workforce has been shown
to positively influence patient outcomes, disparities
continue to exist in salary and academic promotion
for women and underrepresented minorities (URM)
across the house of medicine.2–6
In emergency medicine (EM) specifically, survey
data collected in 2010 from academic emergency
departments (EDs) demonstrated that the salary for
female faculty was, on average, 12% less than their
male counterparts and that this difference widened as
physicians were promoted.7 The salary disparity per-
sisted across all academic ranks and most leadership
positions.3,7 Similar disparities exist in the physician
workforce by race and ethnicity. While blacks and His-
panics represent approximately 30% of the United
States population, they represent less than 6% of prac-
ticing physicians and 9% of EM physicians in the
United States.8 Whether these salary and rank dispari-
ties
continue
to
exist
among
EM
physicians
is
unknown.9,10 Data on URM in academic EM is also
sparse.
A contemporary data set that provides information
on full-time academic EM faculty is needed to answer
these questions. Prior reports have used the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual
salary survey as a conventional benchmark. The
AAMC survey, however, includes only research and
education faculty and not faculty on clinical tracks. In
addition, many EM faculty are not represented in the
AAMC data, as evidenced by significant differences in
reported salaries for EM physicians between the
AAMC and other sources.7 The Academy of Adminis-
trators in Academic Emergency Medicine (AAAEM),
an academy within the Society for Academic Emer-
gency Medicine (SAEM), annually conducts a salary
survey with characteristics and data points for clinical
faculty in addition to research and education faculty,
providing a more comprehensive overview of the aca-
demic EM workforce. The AAAEM survey therefore
allows a unique opportunity to track the current status
of the EM academic workforce in relation to gender
and race/ethnicity. Our objectives were to use data
from the 2015 AAAEM salary survey to describe the
current academic EM workforce by gender, race, and
rank and to determine whether gender disparities in
salary or rank currently exist.
METHODS
This was a cross-sectional observational study of aca-
demic EDs in the United States. This study was sub-
mitted to the institutional review board (IRB) of the
institution that maintains the data set and was deter-
mined to be exempt from IRB approval.
Participants
Survey participants included academic EDs or divi-
sions (adult and pediatric) throughout the United
States. Representatives from each department or divi-
sion were asked to provide deidentified information
regarding their individual faculty members. Potential
participants were identified by their membership in
the AAAEM or the Association of Academic Chairs
in Emergency Medicine (AACEM) and were invited to
participate in completion of the AAAEM 2015 salary
survey via the AAAEM online community e-mail sys-
tem and the AACEM online community e-mail sys-
tem.
For
participating
centers,
the
department
administrators were asked to log onto the Novi Survey
portal to provide information regarding their faculty
members for the previous academic year (July 1,
2014–June 30, 2015). A group of designated “super
users” consisting of selected administrators and/or
chairs followed up with all potential respondents dur-
ing the collection period to encourage responses,
answer questions, and enhance the response rate.
Survey Description
The AAAEM salary survey is an iteration of a salary
survey that has been periodically conducted by SAEM
since 1991.7,11 In 2009, AACEM and AAAEM
became responsible for periodically conducting the sur-
vey. The survey instrument has been revised multiple
times since its development. Each iteration has been
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE • October 2017, Vol. 24, No. 10 • www.aemj.org
1183
 approved by the SAEM Board of Directors; revisions
since 2009 have been approved by AACEM and
AAAEM leadership. Gender items were added to the
administrator’s survey in 2013, and race and ethnicity
were added to the survey in 2015. The 2015 salary
survey included items regarding demographics, aca-
demic rank, years of experience, clinical hours worked,
training and board certification, core faculty status,
administrative roles, position, and salary for faculty in
each department. Survey data were collected and main-
tained by a central site. Each data point was reviewed
if it fell on the extreme end of the range submitted
(either high or low); the accuracy of potential outliers
was confirmed with the representative from the partici-
pant’s department.
Variables/Definitions
Salaries used in the present analysis were base and/or
total salaries (base salary plus incentive compensation,
additional compensation for overtime or other clinical
premiums, and stipends for other work). Demographic
data for each faculty member included gender, race, eth-
nicity, and years as EM faculty. Race was operational-
ized into six categories: white/non-Hispanic, black/
African American, Asian, Asian Indian, other (white-
Hispanic, Pacific Islander, multiracial, some other race,
and American Indian, each of which represented < 2%
of the overall sample), and unknown. Ethnicity was cat-
egorized as Hispanic or non-Hispanic. The geographic
region of the United States (northeast, midwest, south,
west) was also reported for each department.
Academic rank was categorized as instructor, assis-
tant professor, associate professor, or professor. The
total years of experience variable was defined as total
years as EM faculty since completion of training.
Yearly hours worked were defined as clinical hours
and total hours. Fellowship trained was defined as
having completed any fellowship (ACGME or non-
ACGME
approved)
following
residency
training.
Board certified was defined as either certified or board
eligible by the American Board of Emergency Medi-
cine
(ABEM).
Core
faculty,
as
defined
by
the
ACGME, included faculty who provide clinical service
and teaching, who devote the majority of their profes-
sional efforts to the program and who have enough
protected time to meet the educational requirements of
the program. Administrative roles were defined as hav-
ing a role in the department with substantial time
spent
organizing,
managing,
or
otherwise
being
responsible for the running of a program, division,
site,
or
educational
activity.
Job
duties/positions
reported in the current analysis include chair/chief,
vice-chair, medical director, and assistant or associate
medical director.
Data Analysis
Baseline
data by gender
and race/ethnicity were
reported using descriptive statistics (frequencies/pro-
portions, means/SD, and median/interquartile range
[IQR], as appropriate). Analysis was restricted to full-
time faculty only. Mean and median base and total
salaries were reported by gender, stratified by rank and
geographic region. To protect responder anonymity,
mean salaries were not reported for categories in
which there were less than 10 faculty members. Salar-
ies for those participants in gender/rank/region cate-
gories in which there were fewer than 10 participants,
however, were reported in aggregate (reported by rank
and gender but not stratified by region) and were
included in regression models. Finally, average salaries
were reported by gender, rank, and years as EM fac-
ulty and then by gender, rank, and clinical hours,
which were divided into quartiles.
Multivariate linear regression was conducted with
total salary as the outcome and gender as the primary
independent variable. Two models were created a pri-
ori in consideration of potential confounders and
covariates on salary and number of variables in the
model. We followed a rule of thumb, ensuring that
there were at least 10 outcomes for every covariate in
order to avoid overfitting. The full model included
gender along with 11 other covariates, chosen a priori
by authors based on previous literature7 and scientific
plausibility: race/ethnicity, geographic region, academic
rank, total years as EM faculty, type of primary site,
core faculty status, administrative roles, total clinical
hours, EM residency training status, fellowship train-
ing status, and ABEM board eligible/certified. The
final model included gender and only other covariates
if they were statistically significant (p < 0.05) using a
stepwise selection approach and if they did not cause
lack of fit for the model.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted using base sal-
ary instead of total salary, again using multivariate lin-
ear regression. As in the analyses with total salary,
potential
confounders
were
chosen
a
priori
and
included in the final model using a stepwise selection
approach. A second sensitivity analysis was conducted
using total salary as the outcome but excluding chairs
from the sample using multivariate linear regression.

Madsen et al. • DISPARITIES IN ACADEMIC EM WORKFORCE
 Multivariate logistic regression was also used to
examine gender along with other potential factors asso-
ciated with associate or full professor rank. The model
included race/ethnicity, total years as EM faculty, pri-
mary site, status as core faculty, administrative roles,
EM residency training, and fellowship training; the
final model included gender and only statistically sig-
nificant factors. For the purposes of the regression
models, race was treated as a binary variable (white/
non-Hispanic vs. other) because of the small numbers
of faculty in categories other than white/non-Hispanic.
Further analysis of salary by race or ethnicity was not
attempted because of the small number of faculty
reported in each of the race categories other than
white/non-Hispanic.
A type I error rate of 0.05 was used in all analyses.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute). Model diagnostics for the
final regression models were performed using a lack-
of-fit test to determine goodness of fit of the models,
variance inflation factor to determine multicollinearity,
and an SAS diagnostic panel to identify presence of
outliers and influential data points as well as to diag-
nose violations of the normality and homoscedasticity
assumptions. Outliers, however, were not excluded
from the regression models since these outliners may
be more likely to be female and/or minority race.
RESULTS
Of the 101 departments invited to participate, 47
departments responded for a response rate of 47%.
From a total of 1,599 faculty, 86% (n = 1,371) were
full time and were included in the analyses. One male
faculty member’s salary was not reported and was thus
excluded from the study, and one faculty member was
excluded because of gender marked as “unknown.” Of
1,371 faculty in the final analytical sample, 33%
(n = 447) were women, and 22% (n = 305) were in
categories other than white/non-Hispanic.
Gender Comparison of EM Academic
Workforce
Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics of representa-
tive EM faculty by gender and race/ethnicity. Women
and men differed significantly by academic rank, fellow-
ship training, administration roles, position, and total
years as EM faculty (all p < 0.05). Fewer women than
men were professors (7% vs. 17%) and associate profes-
sors
(19%
vs.
24%),
while
more
women
were
instructors or assistant professors (74% vs. 59%). More
women than men were fellowship trained (36.9% vs.
31.1%), but fewer women had administrative roles
(47% vs. 57%). Women less often held a chair/chief or
vice-chair position (4% vs. 10%). Women worked simi-
lar
clinical
hours
as
men
(1,068.6 � 371
vs.
1,051.3 � 393), as well as total hours (clinical + teach-
ing
+
administrative;
1,928.5 � 523.7
vs.
1,899.3 � 493.9; all p > 0.05). Comparable numbers
of men and women were also EM residency trained
and board certified. Table 1A in Data Supplement S1
(available as supporting information in the online ver-
sion of this paper, which is available at https://doi.org/
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.13269/full)
shows descriptive characteristics with faculty broken
down into race/gender subgroups.
Race and Ethnicity Comparison of EM
Workforce
Significant differences by faculty race included aca-
demic rank, core faculty status, administration roles,
total hours worked, and clinical hours worked (all
p < 0.05). Table 1 shows these characteristics divided
into six categories by race. When treated as a binary
variable, comparison of white/non-Hispanic versus all
other (black/African American, Asian, Asian Indian,
other) revealed that significantly more faculty in the
“all other” category were classified in the clinical
instructor
and
assistant
professor
category:
69%
(n = 210), compared to 62% (n = 663) of white/non-
Hispanic faculty. In contrast, 15% (n = 155) of white/
non-Hispanic faculty were full professors compared to
10% (n = 30) of all other faculty. Of white/non-Hispa-
nic faculty, 55% (n = 590) had administration roles.
Among nonwhite faculty members, proportions of fac-
ulty with administration roles ranged from 44% of
black faculty to 61% of Asian Indian faculty. Of the
113 chair/vice-chair positions, 18% were filled by non-
white faculty. Both clinical and total hours also dif-
fered across racial groups with those in the “other
race” category working the most number of hours and
those with unknown race working the least mean
number of hours (Table 1).
With regard to ethnicity, 3% (n = 40) of partici-
pants were Hispanic. Of all Hispanic participants,
three were instructor, 25 were assistant, seven were
associate, and five were full professors. Of the 40 His-
panic participants, 15 were fellowship trained, 37 were
EM residency trained, 26 were core faculty, and 40
were
EM
board
certified.

Gender Comparison for Annual Salary
Table 2 shows mean and median total salary strati-
fied by gender, geographic region, and rank. The
mean and median total salary across all geographic
regions for instructors were $224,238/$225,912 for
women compared to $266,333/$264,655 for men.
For women at the assistant professor level, and mean
and median salaries were $249,105/$246,530 com-
pared to $266,991/$260,230 for men at the same
level. For women at the associate professor level,
mean and median salary was $273,441/$272,288
compared to $307,681/ $288,169 for men at the
same level. For women at the full professor level,
mean and median salary was $324,713/$294,050 for
women compared to $342,795/$315,603 for men.
With the exception of mean and median salary at
the full professor level, all of these differences were
statistically significant. Similar disparities by gender
were found in mean and median base salaries (Data
Supplement S1, Table 2A).
Table 3 shows the multivariate linear regression of
factors associated with total salary. After race, geo-
graphic region, academic rank, total years as EM fac-
ulty, primary site, core faculty, administrative roles,
total clinical hours, residency training, fellowship train-
ing, and EM board certified/eligible were adjusted for,
women

regression model with base salary as the outcome,
women
made
$13,109 � 3,298
less
than
men
(p < 0.001; Data Supplement S1, Table 3A). Finally,
when chairs were excluded from the model, results
showed
that
women
still
made
significantly
less
($18,658 � $3,075; Data Supplement S1, Table 3B,
supplement). Mean salaries for chairs and vice-chairs
by
gender
can

Comparing starting salaries by gender, we found
that women received a lower starting package at each
academic rank compared to men (p < 0.001 for
instructors, p = 0.015 for assistant professors). To
account for the influence of factors such as fellowship
training or the number of clinical commitments, we
performed a stratified analysis for these confounders.
We found that the gender disparity in starting salaries
persisted when comparing fellowship-trained physicians
(Data Supplement S1, Tables 2B and 2C; p < 0.05).
Finally, salaries for women were less than men across
almost all quartiles of clinical hours (Figure 1 and
Data Supplement S1, Table 2D).
Gender and Race Comparison of Rank
Table 4 shows the multivariate regression of factors
associated with a rank of associate or full professor.
After geographic region was adjusting for, total years
as EM faculty, primary site, core faculty, administrative
roles, residency training, fellowship training, neither
gender nor race influenced rank of associate or full
professor (p = 0.375, p = 0.202).
DISCUSSION
Using a contemporary survey, we found that the pro-
portion of women physicians in the current EM work-
force (33%) is slightly higher than previous reports
(31%).7 Despite this encouraging trend, we confirmed
that significant disparities continue to exist in repre-
sentation, rank, and salaries by gender and also by
race among academic EM physicians. The majority of
academic EM physicians were male (67%) and white/
non-Hispanic (78%). Outside of the white/non-Hispa-
nic category, no other single racial or ethnic category
comprised more than 5% of faculty. We also noted
disparities in academic rank and position; fewer
women and URM were professors, associate profes-
sors, chairs, and vice-chairs. Women on average
earned $19,000 less than their male colleagues, even
after controlling for academic rank, geographic region,

 training, clinical hours worked, years of experience,
and administrative roles. These factors help mitigate
the assumption that disparity in salary is due to less
experience, qualification, or hours worked.
Our study findings affirm a gender gap in salary
within
EM
that
has
been
demonstrated
across
specialties, demonstrate that gender gaps in salary in
academic EM have persisted over time and illustrate
that women are compensated less even after controlling
for key factors that have been speculated to contribute
to salary differences.10,12 Prior studies have suggested
that gender disparities in salary among academic

 physicians could be attenuated by adjusting for part
time status, clinical hours worked, or leave time (i.e.,
maternity leave) during the course of physicians’
careers.12 In our study, we eliminated these issues by
comparing salaries of only full-time faculty. We found
that gaps in salaries persisted despite the fact that more
women EM physicians were fellowship trained, worked
similar number of clinical hours, and were EM resi-
dency trained. Men starting at instructor position
earned 35% more than women and 10% higher start-
ing in an assistant professor position. These trends per-
sisted across increasing academic rank, each quartile of
clinical hours worked, or fellowship training.
Such gaps have consistently been reported before,7
but the primary focus on gender disparities in our
study allowed us to conduct a methodologically rigor-
ous study that controlled for potential confounding
factors. Watts et al.7 reported that women EM faculty
made 10% to 13% less than men in 2010. Concern-
ingly, the gap in starting salary has not narrowed, as
in 1995, earned 12% higher, on average, than women

 EM physicians. Consistent with previous reports, we
found fewer proportions of women in associate and
full professor academic rank.13
Reasons for salary disparities by gender are unclear
but may include gender differences in negotiation as
well as the presence of conscious and unconscious
biases. For example, previous data have shown that
women negotiate less often, are less likely to initiate
negotiations, and negotiate lower salaries compared to
men.14–16 Complicating gender differences in negotia-
tion are data showing that compared to men, women
may be penalized for initiating negotiations.17 Women
who initiate negotiations for higher compensation may
be perceived as too “demanding” or less friendly,
going against typical feminine stereotypes. Such percep-
tions may then lead to a reluctance on the part of
women to negotiate higher salaries.17 Gender differ-
ences in negotiation could affect starting salaries as
well as salary increases over time. Implicit, or uncon-
scious, biases about the value of women’s contribu-
tions to
the
workforce
could
also
contribute to
disparities in salary.18
The lack of women and URM at higher ranks is
consistent with recent cross-sectional data from the
AAMC showing that although women constitute close
to 50% of all graduating medical students, only 21%
of full professors are female.3 Women have cited
numerous reasons for leaving careers in academic
medicine, including lack of adequate mentorship, high
work–family conflict, gender discrimination, and inter-
est in teaching over research;13,19 however, failure to
advance or to receive promotion to leadership roles
may also be a factor, as our study suggests. Future
research is needed to delineate the issues of retention
and advancement.
Our study also adds to prior EM literature by includ-
ing information on race and ethnicity, presenting a
descriptive analysis of academic rank, salary, and leader-
ship positions of URM faculty.7 Our findings are con-
sistent with data showing that URM comprise a small
proportion of the academic medicine workforce and
are less likely to hold senior positions.2,8 A study of
128 academic medical centers found that black or His-
panic faculty constituted only 5% of new academic

 hires and they had significantly longer promotion time-
lines when compared to their white counterparts.2 Sim-
ilar data were found when examining promotion rates
for Asian Pacific Islander, URM (black, Mexican Amer-
ican, Puerto Rican, Native American, and Native Alas-
kan), and other Hispanic physicians. After factors such
as gender, tenure status, degree, and NIH award status
were adjusted for, URM faculty were still less likely to
be promoted at all levels.
In addition to the negative implications for aca-
demic EM physicians, a lack of diversity and equality
among academic EM faculty has consequences for
trainees and patients. A diverse workforce in EM is
more representative of the larger population, and
diverse providers can bring their unique experiences
and understanding of patient backgrounds, leading to
increased cultural sensitivity and improved care for
the diverse ED patient population. Increasing diver-
sity in our workforce has the potential to decrease
treatment disparities.20 The importance of a diverse
EM workforce has recently been highlighted by both
the
American
College
of
Emergency
Physicians
(ACEP) and the SAEM.21–23 Part of the new ACEP
strategic plan is “to promote and facilitate diversity,
inclusion, and cultural sensitivity.”21 Similarly, the
Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency
Medicine (ADIEM), on behalf of SAEM, has estab-
lished a goal of diversifying the EM physician work-
force so that it better reflects the population of
patients we serve.22,23
LIMITATIONS
There are several limitations to our analysis. First, the
response rate of 47% may have led to a bias in the
sample of departments represented by this study. It is
possible that departments that did participate were
those more confident in their hiring, salary conferral,
and promotion practices or those that had the data
readily available due to prior audits of these processes;
if so, it is possible that our study results underestimate
existing gender disparities.
Some misclassification by gender, race, or ethnicity
may have occurred because in most circumstances,
department administrators rather than individual fac-
ulty reported these characteristics. Future studies of
disparities by race and ethnicity should report race
and ethnicity as self-identified by faculty members. In
addition, there may be factors that affect promotion or
compensation that were not accounted for in our
study, including family leave time prior to the survey
which was not collected.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the prioritization of increasing diversity by lead-
ing organizations of emergency medicine, gender dis-
parities in academic rank and compensation and racial
and ethnic disparities in academic rank (and composi-
tion) among academic emergency medicine physicians
continue to exist. Further research is needed to identify
other strategies to eliminate disparities and match the
mission of ensuring inclusion, diversity, and equality in
academic emergency medicine.
