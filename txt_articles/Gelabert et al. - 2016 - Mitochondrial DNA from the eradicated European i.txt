Phylogenetic analysis of Plasmodium parasites has indicated that their
modern-day distribution is a result of a series of human-mediated
dispersals involving transport between Africa, Europe, America, and
Asia. A major outstanding question is the phylogenetic affinity of the
malaria causing parasites Plasmodium vivax and falciparum in historic
southern Europe—where it was endemic until the mid-20th century,
after which it was eradicated across the region. Resolving the identity
of these parasites will be critical for answering several hypotheses on
the malaria dispersal. Recently, a set of slides with blood stains of
malaria-affected people from the Ebro Delta (Spain), dated between
1942 and 1944, have been found in a local medical collection. We
extracted DNA from three slides, two of them stained with Giemsa
(on which Plasmodium parasites could still be seen under the micro-
scope) and another one consisting of dried blood spots. We gener-
ated the data using Illumina sequencing after using several strategies
aimed at increasing the Plasmodium DNA yield: depletion of the hu-
man genomic (g)DNA content through hybridization with human
gDNA baits, and capture-enrichment using gDNA derived from
P. falciparum. Plasmodium mitochondrial genome sequences were
subsequently reconstructed from the resulting data. Phylogenetic
analysis of the eradicated European P. vivax mtDNA genome indicates
that the European isolate is closely related to the most common
present-day American haplotype and likely entered the American
continent post-Columbian contact. Furthermore, the European
P. falciparum mtDNA indicates a link with current Indian strains that
is in agreement with historical accounts.

T
he genus Plasmodium contains two of the most significant
human pathogenic organisms. One, Plasmodium vivax, is the
most widely distributed human malaria parasite outside of
Africa, with a range that extends well into temperate zones (1),
whereas the other, Plasmodium falciparum, is the predominant
malaria parasite of humans in subsaharan Africa and the one
that causes >90% malarial deaths (2).
Although an increasing number of studies have attempted to
investigate the present-day distribution of Plasmodium parasites
using DNA sourced from modern isolates of the pathogens, their
origin and dispersal around the planet remain controversial. For
example, the current global distribution of P. vivax includes Asia,
the Middle East, South and Central America, and parts of Africa
(3) and has likely resulted from complex dispersals involving in-
tercontinental human population movements (4, 5). Although an
African origin is likely (6), the current strains from this continent
show little genetic polymorphism compared with the rest of
the world (4), a fact that has been related to the emergence of
Duffy-negative blood types—resistant to P. vivax—in human pop-
ulations from this continent (7). Alternatively, it has been suggested
that modern African parasites, at least in the Horn of Africa and
Madagascar, could have been reintroduced via the import of East
Asian/Indian P. vivax to the coastal areas of East Africa by early sea-
going traders and that this could explain their lack of diversity (4).
Intriguingly, the diversity of the American strains is comparable to
those found in Oceania and Asia (8), raising questions regarding the
origin of these strains. Some of the American strains are thought to
have been brought there from Europe by Spanish sailors and col-
onists in the last few centuries (4, 9). An alternative possibility
would imply a pre-Columbian entrance through the Bering Straits
during the initial peopling of the Americas, although this seems
unlikely due to the climatic conditions of this passage (9) and the
long Beringian standstill that likely lasted up to several thousands of
years (10). However, the existence of divergent mitochondrial
lineages in the Americas seems to rule out the possibility of a single,
recent introduction of P. vivax from Europe into this continent (8).
Significance
Previous studies have attempted to unravel the complex phy-
logeographic patterns of the malaria parasites Plasmodium
vivax and Plasmidium falciparum diversity and also to un-
derstand its evolutionary affinities. However, all these studies
are constrained by the lack of evidence from the eradicated
European strains that could be central to some dispersals. This
study successfully retrieves massive genetic data from old
slides treated with traditional staining techniques to be ob-
served under the microscope, thus providing a new material
source for the study of past pathogens that could place value in
historical medical collections. We generated sequence data
from the eradicated European malaria parasites and shed light
on the genetic diversity patterns of P. vivax and P. falciparum.

ANTHROPOLOGY
 At the nuclear level, the American isolates show geographic dif-
ferentiation but also a common clustering regarding the Old World
populations (5).
With regard to the evolutionary history of P. falciparum, ge-
netic analyses of Laveriana parasite species found in African
chimpanzees and gorillas, considered to be precursors of the
human parasites, prove an African origin (11), but the time by
which the parasite dispersed out of Africa remains controversial.
Although some suggest that the pathogen followed the original
Homo sapiens dispersals around 60,000 y ago (12), others sup-
port a recent expansion within the last 5,000–10,000 y associated
to the advent of agriculture (2). The recent analysis of 44 Indian
field isolates showed, however, a higher than expected diversity
and suggested that the Indian strains are also part of the an-
cestral distribution range of P. falciparum (13). Historical ac-
counts seem to indicate that malaria spread from India into the
Mediterranean at the time of Classical Greece; therefore, the
now extinct European P. falciparum could be genetically related
to some of these Indian parasites.
The current controversies on the recent evolutionary history of
P. vivax and P. falciparum partly relate to the lack of genetic
evidence from the European parasite that was eradicated more
than half century ago. In Spain, malaria had remained endemic
until the early 20th century, in particular in Andalucia,
Extremadura, and Ebro delta regions; it was declared oficially
eradicated in 1964 (14). P. vivax and P. falciparum have been
transmitted in southern Spain by two former malaria vectors:
Anopheles atroparvus and Anopheles labranchiae. Both were
present in the country but whereas An. atroparvus is still widely
spread, An. labranchiae has not been found since the middle of
the last century (15). An. atroparvus from different geographic
origins are infected in laboratory with different world strains of
P. vivax, whereas it is very difficult to do the same in the case of
P. falciparum (16). Thus, the lack of genetic evidence of the
former Plasmodium European parasites also hampers our un-
derstanding of their biology.
To clarify the phylogenetic position of the extinct European
Plasmodium strains, we report here the retrieval of the European
P. vivax and P. falciparum genetic data from the analysis of
three recently discovered old slides with blood drops from malaria-
infected people living at the Ebro Delta in Spain in the first half of
the 20th century that corresponds to local epidemics (Fig. 1).
Results
The three samples (CA, CM, and POS) contained Plasmodium
and human sequences. The “depleted” libraries mapped to
P. vivax nuclear genome in fold coverage values that range from
no coverage in POS sample to 0.0889× (CM) and to P. falcipa-
rum from 0.0157× (POS) to 0.0182× (CA); the captured libraries
mapped to P. vivax from 0.0013× (POS) to 0.0260 (CM) and to
P. falciparum from 0.0092 (POS) to 0.4291 (CA) (Table 1 and
Tables S1–S3). Therefore, samples CA and CM seem to be
coinfected with both malaria parasites (the former having more
P. falciparum and the latter more P. vivax), whereas sample POS
carries minimal amounts of P. vivax. The differences (being
CA the most efficient sample) do not seem to be a consequence of
the original amount of DNA present in the slides, because the
depleted libraries of the three samples mapped to the human
genome—deriving from a similar amount of sequences previously
generated—yielded similar mean nuclear depths: 0.2116× (CA),

 0.1937× (CM), and 0.2290× (POS). Additionally, these figures
indicate that the depletion strategy to remove human DNA
from the slides was not totally efficient. The high ratio of coin-
fection could be attributable to the fact that the slides are a biased
sample and likely were taken from patients that showed acute
malaria symptoms.
Both Plasmodium and human sequences display a weak but
discernible signal of ancient DNA nucleotide misincorporation
patterns (C to T substitutions at the 5′ ends and G to A at the
3′ ends) (17), reaching a deamination rate of 2.5% at the read
extremes. This observation is in agreement with values found in
museum specimens of similar age (18), which, along with the
fragmentation pattern, supports the authenticity of the analyzed
DNA sequences (Figs. S1 and S2).
Each of the three samples exhibited different, common human
European mtDNA haplogroups (CA: J2a1a1; CM: H1e1a6; and
POS: H2a2b), which indicates that each blood source had a unique
individual origin (human mtDNA coverage ranged from 6× at CM
to 24.7× at CA). Some background contamination from two people—
one of them a researcher that handled the slides—could be de-
tected in figures of 6.81% in CM, 10.86% in CA, and 23.83% in
POS. The fact that the predominant haplotypes are different among
slides supports that no major DNA mixing occurred among patients’
samples, although it cannot be totally discarded.
Although it was impossible to separate the nuclear genomic se-
quences from both parasites due to the low number of Plasmodium
nuDNA reads, the relatively higher depth of coverage in the
mtDNA genomes allowed us to map the reads either to P. falci-
parum or to P. vivax sequences (the former ranged from 2.8× in
POS to 9.9× in CA and the latter from 1.6× in POS to 3.9× in CA).
In total, 459 mtDNA reads passed the quality filters for P. vivax,
yielding a 5.02× depth of coverage and 67% of the P. vivax
mtDNA genome covered with at least two reads (total length
available of 4,045 nucleotides). We detected in our genome a
European-specific nucleotide change that cannot be attributed to
the typical C to T or G to A ancient DNA postmortem damage
(17): a T to C substitution at nucleotide position 1033. This mu-
tation is present among reads from two of the slides analyzed (CM
and POS) but is absent in four reads on this position for sample
CA. Although it is impossible to generate confident haplotypes for
each of the slides due to the low coverage, this could indicate that
CA carries in fact the haplotype without this substitution.
The P. falciparum mtDNA sequence obtained reached 14×
coverage and represented the full length of the mitochondrial ge-
nome, with 5,827 nucleotides. We found three mutations present in
the three slides that are also shared with present-day Indian indi-
viduals: 276 (G > A), 725 (C > T), and 2763 (C > T). No haplotype
differences among the three individuals were detected.
In the phylogenetic analysis, we found that the extinct Euro-
pean P. vivax mtDNA clusters close to the haplotype most com-
monly found nowadays in the Americas: also described in
some Southeast Asians from Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Thailand
and also in one Melanesian sample (Fig. 2). In the maximum-
likelihood tree, the historical sample appears relatively early in

Discussion
Previous phylogeographic analyses on mtDNA from P. vivax have
commented on the anomalous central position of the American
haplotypes, placed intermediate between Melanesian and South-
east Asian clusters (19). In fact the most common American
haplotype—in which the European isolate sequenced here differs
by only one substitution—was identified by outgroup probability
analysis as the most likely ancestral type (4), despite the presumed
African origin of the parasite. This finding led the previous au-
thors to argue that the most parsimonious explanation being that
American strains (or at least some of them) derive from the now
extinct European P. vivax, which would itself be related to an
ancient “African” stock related to modern strains found in India
and Western Asia. Furthermore, they argued that the surprising
lack of variation previously observed among a large proportion of
contemporary African samples—at least those from the Horn of
African and Madagascar—would indicate that they are relatively
young strains (1, 4) that might derive from Indian or West Asian
stocks introduced in parts of the Africa continent in historical
times (1, 4, 5), whereas the original African diversity would have
been obscured by the rise of Duffy antigen null allele.
In addition, there is substantial geographic differentiation among
P. vivax mitochondrial lineages, not only between continents, but
also between neighboring countries such as those in South America
itself (8, 19). The American data are regarded as consistent with
two alternative but not mutually exclusive hypotheses: an ancient,
pre-Columbian introduction with the original Amerindian settlers
and a recent introduction from European colonizers. There is no
solid evidence for an introduction with the original Amerindian
settlers. None of the American lineages seems to share a common
ancestry with those present in East Asian countries such as China
and Korea that would be close to the potential entrance route from
Asia into the American continent through Beringia (5, 20). In ad-
dition, it is doubtful if the climate in Beringia at the time of
people crossing from North Asia into North America would
have been sufficiently warm to allow transmission.
Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the
dominant present-day South American haplotypes were indeed
carried from Europe by post-Columbian travelers and that these
haplotypes are in fact the closest modern representatives of the
ancestral Eurasian P. vivax stock. The limitation on the genetic data
available from the putative source population implies that we can-
not know at present if all American strains derive from the Euro-
pean continent. It will be necessary to examine further P. vivax
specimens form archival medical collections from previously malaria
endemic areas of Europe to better understand the possible sources
of post-Columbian introduction of P. vivax into the Americas.
According to historical accounts, intermittent fever conditions
with the hallmarks of severe malaria—thus likely associated to
P. falciparum—spread to India about 3,000 y ago and reached

 Greece maybe 500 y later. By the beginning of the Christian
Era, it was present around all of the Mediterranean shores (2,
21). Therefore, the phylogeographic position of the European
P. falciparum isolate indicates a potential link with Indian strains
that is in agreement with these historical accounts. In contrast to
the case of P. vivax, the American strains likely derive from Africa
and took place during the slave trade (22). This finding is in
agreement with the position of the European isolate in the
worldwide haplotype network, which is clearly unrelated to the
American haplotypes (Fig. 3).
Recent studies on the nuclear genome of both parasites have
uncovered not only regional diversity patterns, especially in the case
of P.vivax, but also the signals of recent adaptive responses to an-
timalarial drugs such as sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, and other
antifolate drugs (5, 20). The European Plasmodium samples have
to predate these selective sweeps and thus could be used to test the
observed genetic signals in modern isolates. The same approach
could be used to determine the molecular resistance mechanism
underlying the fact that present-day P.vivax is increasingly resistant
to the first-line treatment, which is based on chloroquine (23). We
could also obtain a thorough estimate of the evolutionary rate of
the parasite with extra historical data from dated slides.
We are currently searching for additional malaria slides among
antique medical collections along Europe to obtain further in-
formation on the genetic diversity of the European Plasmodium
strains. With the methodology developed in the present research,
we hope we could be able to retrieve also a substantial fraction of
the nuclear genome of these parasites.
Materials and Methods
Sample Selection. Ildefonso Canicio, who was in charge of the antimalaria
center inaugurated in 1925 by the Generalitat de Catalunya at Sant Jaume
d’Enveja (Ebro Delta), worked with malaria-infected patients from the rice
fields for several decades and eventually he caught the disease himself. The
slides selected for this study were among those collected by his daughter
and his family after his death in 1961 and are dated between the years 1942
and 1944; the preserved patient records indicate these were local people
with no travel histories. We selected two slides (thereafter, labeled CM and
CA for an abbreviation of the patient’s names) stained with Giemsa, on
which some Plasmodium parasites could still be seen under the microscope
(Fig. 1), and one additional slide of anonymous dried blood (labeled POS) for
analysis from the original medical collection from Dr. Canicio. We designed
an ad hoc extraction method based on previous experiences with ancient
museum samples. The extraction procedure was done in a dedicated ancient
DNA laboratory at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona where
no previous malaria work has ever been conducted.
DNA Extraction. The slides were immersed (except for one end, to preserve the
handwritten labels) in 10–15 mL lysis solution and left in Falcon 50-mL tubes at
37 °C overnight. The lysis buffer was composed of 0.5% SDS, 0.25 mg/mL pro-
teinase K, 10 mM Tris, and 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0. The supernatant was sub-
sequently concentrated with a silica column-based method following a protocol
that was originally designed to retrieve very short and highly degraded DNA
fragments from very ancient specimens (24) (SI Materials and Methods).
Library Preparation and Amplification. Double-stranded libraries were built
using the NEBNext DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set 2 (E6070; New England
Biolabs) and Illumina specific adapters from ref. 24, following the manufac-
turer’s instructions with minor modifications to the protocol (SI Materials and
Methods). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we determined the optimal number
of cycles required to amplify the samples to get the right amount of DNA
necessary for capture experiments (100–500 ng) (SI Materials and Methods).
Capture Depletion. As tiny amounts of parasite DNA are expected to be
present in the slides, along with abundant human DNA from the hosts, we
used several strategies to increase the Plasmodium DNA yield: first, we de-
pleted the human content by performing whole genome capture with hu-
man baits and shotgun-sequenced what would normally be considered the
waste product, and second, we carried out a capture enrichment approach
using whole genome bait synthesized from P. falciparum genomic (g)DNA.
The capture-depletion experiment using whole-genome human bait was
conducted using the MYbait Human Whole Genome Capture Kit (MYcroarray)
following the manufacturer’s instructions according to manual version 3.01 (from
www.mycroarray.com/pdf/MYbaits-manual-v3.pdf).
Because we were interested in the nonhuman fraction of the samples,
after hybridizing the ancient (a)DNA libraries with the human bait for 24 h,
we let it bind to streptavidin magnetic beads for 30 min at 65 °C. Afterward,
we collected the supernatant (fraction that did not bind to the beads) and
cleaned it up using QiaQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were eluted in 30 μL elution buffer (EB)
buffer after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C.
P. falciparum Capture. P. falciparum baits were prepared according to a
previously published protocol (25). Briefly, genomic DNA obtained from the
P. falciparum African strain 3D7 in vitro culture (MRA-102G, MR4; ATCC) was
sheared and built into libraries containing a custom T7 adapter. Then,
Plasmodium T7 libraries were used to prepare biotinylated RNA baits by
in vitro transcription. Using these homemade probes, we carried out a sec-
ond capture experiment following the MyBaits manual version 3.01.
Amplification of Capture-Depleted Products. After estimating the optimal
number of cycles with qPCR, capture-depletion products were amplified for
5 cycles and P. falciparum capture products for 22 cycles using 2× KAPA
HotStart ReadyMix and reamplification primers IS5 and IS6 (26). Samples
were quantified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and
pooled in equimolar amounts. The pool was sequenced on one lane of an
Illumina HiSEq 4500 run in 80 SR mode. Library blank controls were included
and showed no evidence of contamination with exogenous P. vivax DNA.
Bioinformatic Analysis. We used AdapterRemoval (27) to remove adapter
sequences from the 3′ end of the reads and to remove stretches of consec-
utive bases with zero, one, or two quality scores. Before mapping, we dis-
carded sequences shorter than 30 bp. All reads were mapped against
P. vivax, P. falciparum, and human [National Center for Biotechnology In-
formation (NCBI) 37, hg19] reference genomes using Burrows–Wheeler
Aligner (BWA) (28) (SI Materials and Methods).
To reconstruct the P. vivax mtDNA genome, we first removed P. falcipa-
rum reads from the P. vivax mtDNA alignment files using a homemade
script. Briefly, for each sequence we recorded the edit distance to both the
P. vivax and P. falciparum mtDNA genomes and retained reads with equal or
lower edit distance to the P. vivax genome. The resulting alignment files
were visually inspected with IGV software (29). Next, to increase resolution,
we merged the mtDNA sequences from the three samples and generated a
consensus P. vivax mtDNA genome using SAMtools and bcftools, restricting
to positions with more than two reads and accepting all substitutions that
were present in more reads than alternative nucleotides. The P. falciparum
mtDNA genome was reconstructed using the same methodology.
Phylogenetic Analysis. The obtained consensus sequence and 790 additional
P. vivax sequences from different continental regions (SI Materials and Methods)
were aligned using MUSCLE 3.8 with default parameters (30). The alignments
were used to construct a haplotype network using the NETWORK 5.0.0 software
(Fluxus Technology). A median joining tree was calculated (31), and the network
was postprocessed with maximum parsimony (MP) calculation (32).
The obtained P. falciparum sequence and additional 698 mtDNA se-
quences (SI Materials and Methods) from different continents (11, 13, 33, 34)
were used to reconstruct a haplotype using the same methodology pre-
viously described with P. vivax.
Maximum-likelihood trees for both P. falciparum and P. vivax were con-
structed in PhyML 3.0 (35) under the GTR+I+G model with a BioNJ starting
tree, the best of either nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) or subtree
pruning and regraphing (SPR) tree improvement and aBayes branch support.
Public mitogenomes of Plasmodium knowlesi (AY722797.1) and Plasmodium
reichenowi (AJ251941.1) were used as outgroup for the P. vivax and the
P. falciparum phylogenies, respectively. The best estimated trees were im-
ported in R and plotted using the ape package (36).
