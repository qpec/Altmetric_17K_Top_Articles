Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are
common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and drive leukemic cell
growth and survival. Although FLT3 inhibitors have shown consider-
able promise for the treatment of AML, they ultimately fail to achieve
long-term remissions as monotherapy. To identify genetic targets
that can sensitize AML cells to killing by FLT3 inhibitors, we
performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen
that identified ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) as being synthetic
lethal with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We found that inactivating ATM or
its downstream effector glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
sensitizes AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor induced apoptosis. Examination
of the cellular metabolome showed that FLT3 inhibition by itself
causes profound alterations in central carbon metabolism, resulting in
impaired production of the antioxidant factor glutathione, which
was further impaired by ATM or G6PD inactivation. Moreover,
FLT3 inhibition elicited severe mitochondrial oxidative stress that
is causative in apoptosis and is exacerbated by ATM/G6PD inhibition.
The use of an agent that intensifies mitochondrial oxidative stress in
combination with a FLT3 inhibitor augmented elimination of AML
cells in vitro and in vivo, revealing a therapeutic strategy for the
improved treatment of FLT3 mutated AML.

A
cute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological cancer
that is characterized by the aberrant growth of myeloid
progenitor cells with a block in cellular differentiation. AML is
the most common adult acute leukemia and accounts for ∼20%
of childhood leukemias. Although frontline treatment of AML
with cytotoxic chemotherapy achieves high remission rates, 75–
80% of patients will either not respond to or will relapse after
initial therapy, and most patients will die of their disease (1, 2).
Thus, more effective and less toxic therapies for AML are re-
quired. The promise of molecularly targeted cancer therapies has
generated much excitement with the remarkable clinical success
of the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting
the oncogenic kinase BCR-ABL for the treatment of chronic
myeloid leukemia (3). However, targeted approaches for the
treatment of AML have not yet yielded major successes.
In AML, aberrant signal transduction drives the proliferation
and survival of leukemic cells. Activated signal transduction occurs
through genetic alterations of signaling molecules such as FLT3,
KIT, PTPN11, and members of the RAS family (4, 5). Given the
successful development and utilization of numerous TKIs, the FLT3
receptor tyrosine kinase has emerged as a promising target for the
treatment of AML. Indeed, activating mutations in FLT3 are one of
the most frequently observed genetic defects in AML and are
comprised predominantly of internal tandem duplication (ITD)
mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (6). FLT3-ITD mutations
are associated with poor prognosis, including increased relapse rate,
decreased disease-free survival, and poor overall survival (5, 7, 8).
The clinical significance and the strong evidence of the role of ac-
tivated FLT3 in driving leukemogenesis (9, 10) have led to the
development of FLT3-targeted TKIs, several of which have been
tested in clinical trials. The most potent and selective of these in-
hibitors, AC220 (quizartinib), demonstrated impressive activity, with
44% of patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutations achieving a com-
plete remission. However, remissions achieved by FLT3 inhibitor
therapy were always short-lived, irrespective of the FLT3 inhibitor
being used (11). Although various trials examining efficacy of FLT3
inhibitors in combination with conventional chemotherapy are still
ongoing, these trials have not as of yet demonstrated sustained re-
missions in FLT3-ITD+ AML.
The inability of FLT3 inhibitors to induce durable remissions
indicates that additional targets will be required for an effective
molecularly targeted AML therapy. To uncover such targets, we
performed a genome-wide shRNA-based synthetic lethal screen
with a FLT3 inhibitor in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Our data show
that modulation of leukemia cell redox metabolism can co-
operate with FLT3 inhibition to elicit more effective eradication
of AML cells.
Significance
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have shown impressive
activity in clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); how-
ever, these inhibitors invariably fail to achieve sustained remis-
sions. Here we demonstrate that FLT3 inhibition causes severe
deficiencies in redox metabolism and accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria of AML cells. We dis-
covered that the metabolic regulators ataxia telangiectasia mu-
tated and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase help maintain
antioxidant capacity and survival of a subpopulation of AML cells
in the face of FLT3 inhibition. Inactivation of these factors es-
calates mitochondrial ROS and enhances AML cell eradication.
Importantly, we show that the use of a drug that increases mi-
tochondrial ROS enhances the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitor therapy,
suggesting a combinatorial therapeutic strategy.

ATM and G6PD Are Synthetic Lethal on FLT3 Inhibition in FLT3-ITD+
AML Cells. To identify genes whose suppression sensitizes FLT3-
ITD+ AML cells to killing by FLT3 inhibitors, we performed a
large-scale RNAi-based screen (Fig. 1A). Briefly, FLT3-ITD+
Molm13 cells were virally transduced with a genome-wide
shRNA library (∼4–5 shRNAs per human RNA transcript) and
selected in puromycin for a period of 10 d to obtain a pure
population of transduced cells and to allow for the exclusion of
shRNAs that target essential genes. The transduced cells (rep-
licates of three) were then treated with either vehicle (DMSO)
or the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 (lestaurtinib) at 20 nM for 72 h, a
dose that eliminates ∼85–90% of the cells. The cells were cul-
tured for an additional week to allow for recovery. RNA was
isolated and reverse-transcribed, and the shRNA sequences were
amplified by PCR followed by quantitation by deep sequencing.
Hierarchical clustering of unfiltered data showed that the repli-
cates cluster by treatment condition, suggesting that shRNA
representation is dependent on the drug treatment and is not
stochastic (Fig. S1A). Computational analysis using BiNGS!SL-
seq (12) revealed 93 genes that met the inclusion criteria of at
least two shRNAs per gene, with each shRNA having a weighted
z-value of <0.1 and a mean fold change of <−10 (Dataset S1).
We refer to these genes as SLAMs (for synthetic lethal in AML),
i.e., inhibition (knockdown) of these genes significantly sensitizes
AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor-induced loss of viability. Gene
ontology analysis (Panther) showed that a large proportion of
SLAMs are involved in metabolic processes (Fig. S1B and Table
S1), including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). ATM en-
codes a serine/threonine kinase that facilitates the DNA damage
response. More recently, ATM has been shown to control cel-
lular metabolism and the response to oxidative stress (13).
To verify that inactivation of ATM is synthetic lethal with
FLT3 inhibition, we generated ATM knockdown Molm13 cell
lines using shRNAs that were unique from those used in the
screen. Western blot analysis was used to confirm effective
knockdown of ATM in 2 cell lines (designated ATM sh1 and sh2;
Fig. S1C). Control (expressing a nontargeting shRNA) and ATM
knockdown cells were treated with increasing doses of CEP-701
for 72 h, and viability was assessed, based on propidium iodide
exclusion, by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, the ATM
knockdown cells were significantly more sensitive to CEP-701–
induced loss of viability relative to control cells. Notably, the
ATM knockdown cells proliferated at a similar rate to control
cells, suggesting that ATM does not influence cell viability in the
absence of FLT3 inhibition. To determine if pharmacological
inactivation of ATM has similar effects as genetic inactivation,
we used the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933. Treatment of Molm13
cells with CEP-701 in combination with KU55933 resulted in syn-
ergistic elimination (Fig. 1C). Combination index (CI) values were
synergistic (<0.7) at all combination doses tested and were strongly
synergistic (<0.3) with several combinations (Table S2). Similar
effects were observed using KU55933 in combination with CEP-701
in two additional FLT3-dependent AML cell lines, MV4-11 and
EOL-1 (Fig. S1 D and E and Table S2). Furthermore, knockdown
of ATM or inhibition with KU55933 sensitized Molm13 cells to
treatment with AC220 (Fig. 1 D and E), a more potent and selective
FLT3 inhibitor that is currently being explored in phase III clinical
trials for AML (14). To better understand how ATM inhibition
facilitates loss of viability on treatment with a FLT3 inhibitor, cell
cycle analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. S1F, treatment of
Molm13 cells with a single dose of CEP-701 resulted in both G1
arrest (or quiescence) and apoptosis after 72 h; however, by 144 h,
apoptotic cells were mostly cleared and surviving cells began to re-
enter the cell cycle. In contrast, in cells treated with both CEP-701
and KU55933, the dominant response was apoptosis, with surviving
G1 cells barely detectable after 120 h. Similarly, analysis of apo-
ptosis using Annexin V staining revealed that ATM knockdown

RNAi-based functional genomic screening
identifies ATM as synthetic lethal on FLT3 inhibition
in AML. (A) Experimental overview. Molm13 cells
were transduced with a genome-wide lentiviral shRNA
library. After selection in puromycin, the cells were
treated with either vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or the FLT3
inhibitor CEP-701 (20 nM) for 72 h. After treatment,
the shRNAs were recovered, amplified, and quanti-
tated by next-generation sequencing. Differential
shRNA representation was compared between the
vehicle and treatment groups. (B) Molm13 AML cells
were stably transduced with shRNAs (sh1 or sh2)
targeting ATM or a negative control shRNA (ctrl).
The cell lines were treated with CEP-701 (increasing
concentrations of 0, 10, 15, and 20 nM indicated by
triangles) for 72 h, and the number of viable cells
(based on PI exclusion) was counted by flow cytom-
etry. (C) Molm13 cells were treated with CEP-701 and
KU55933 alone or in combination as indicated (tri-
angle: 0, 5, 7.5, and 10 μM KU55933) for 72 h, and
viable cells were counted. (D) Molm13 cell lines were
treated with AC220 (triangle: 0, 1, 2, and 3 nM), and
cell viability was assessed. (E) Molm13 cells were
treated with AC220 (0, 1, or 2 nM as indicated) and
KU55933 alone or in combination (as in C), and cell
viability was assessed. (F) Molm13 cell lines were
treated for 48 h (as in D), and apoptosis was mea-
sured by Annexin V staining and flow cytometry. For
B, D, and F, asterisks indicate statistical significance
(t test; *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001) for

 significantly increases apoptosis on treatment with AC220 (Fig.
1F). Thus, these data demonstrate that ATM inhibition alters the
fate of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells on FLT3 inhibition, enhancing
cell killing through increased apoptosis.
ATM is well known to regulate the response to DNA damage
in the form of double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, inacti-
vation of ATM, either by knockdown or treatment with KU55933,
did not significantly affect DNA damage levels in the presence or
absence of FLT3 inhibition as measured by Western blotting for
γ-H2AX, a biomarker for DSBs (Fig. S1G). ATM function is not
limited to the response to DSBs, and ATM has been shown to
promote an antioxidant response through activation of glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (15). It should be noted
that G6PD was identified in the RNAi screen as being synthetic
lethal, but did not qualify as a SLAM because it was only iden-
tified by a single shRNA. Thus, we examined whether inactiva-
tion of ATM influences the activity of G6PD in Molm13 cells. As
shown in Fig. 2A, G6PD activity was suppressed by ATM
knockdown and was further suppressed by inhibition of FLT3
with AC220, although not to the extent observed in a G6PD
knockdown cell line. To determine if G6PD inactivation sensi-
tizes Molm13 cells to cell killing on FLT3 inhibition, control or
two different G6PD knockdown cell lines (sh1 and sh2; knock-
down confirmed by Western blot analysis; Fig. S1C) were treated
with AC220 for 72 h, and cell viability was assessed. Indeed,
G6PD knockdown cells were significantly more sensitive to AC220
(Fig. 2B), phenocopying the effect of ATM knockdown, including
enhanced apoptosis on AC220 treatment (Fig. 2C). Moreover,
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an inhibitor of G6PD activity,
synergized with both CEP-701 and AC220 in inducing cell death at
most dose combinations tested (Fig. 2 D and E and Table S2).
Similar results were obtained using the FLT3-ITD+ AML cell line
MV4-11 (Fig. S2A and Table S2). Cell cycle analysis showed
that, similar to ATM, inhibition of G6PD reduces G1 arrest (or
quiescence) and increases apoptosis in combination with FLT3
inhibition (Fig. S2B). The sensitivity of cells to the combination
of an ATM inhibitor or G6PD inhibitor together with a FLT3
inhibitor is reliant on expression of mutant FLT3, as these combi-
nations were synergistic in 32D cells expressing FLT3-ITD but not
in isogenic vector control cells (Fig. S2 D and E). To determine if
overexpression of G6PD is sufficient to rescue the effects of ATM
knockdown, Molm13 Ctrl or ATM knockdown (sh2) cells were
transduced with empty vector or vector expressing G6PD and
treated with AC220. As shown in Fig. 2F, G6PD was able reverse
the enhanced loss of viability of ATM knockdown cells with
AC220, as well as the increased apoptosis (Fig. S2C). Taken
together, these data indicate that ATM and its key downstream
effector G6PD promote the survival of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells
on inhibition of FLT3.
AML Cellular Metabolism Is Substantially Altered by FLT3 Inhibition
and Is Further Affected by Inhibition of ATM/G6PD. Given that ATM
regulates G6PD activity and both factors are known to be in-
volved in the regulation of metabolism, we wanted to determine
what metabolic changes occur upon inhibition of these factors,
especially in the context of concomitant FLT3 inhibition, as
these changes may underlie the observed increase in cell killing.
To this end, Molm13 control, ATM, or G6PD knockdown cell
lines were treated with AC220 for 20 h, a time point that pre-
cedes the induction of apoptosis and before there are major
reductions in cellular protein content elicited by AC220 (Fig. 3A).
The cell extracts were subjected to whole metabolome profiling
using ultra-performance LC-tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS). Par-
tial least squares enhanced discriminant analysis (PLS-eDA)
showed tight clustering of ATM and G6PD knockdown cells,
indicating significant metabolic similarities, whereas treatment
with AC220 resulted in clustering of all three cell lines (Fig. 3B).
AC220 treatment caused profound and global effects on me-
tabolite levels, including severe decreases in anabolic substrates
required for proliferation (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids), en-
ergy-related metabolites (glycolytic and TCA cycle intermedi-
ates), and metabolites involved in redox homeostasis (Fig. 3C
and Fig. S3), indicating that FLT3 is a major driver of anabolic
metabolism in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. A large number of the
metabolic changes elicited by FLT3 inhibition were further ex-
acerbated in ATM and G6PD knockdown cells.
Examination of PPP metabolites revealed significant depletion
of gluconolactone 6-phosphate, which is the direct product of
G6PD, on inhibition of FLT3 (Fig. 4A). As expected, both ATM
and G6PD knockdown caused significant accumulation of the
G6PD substrate glucose 6-phosphate, as well as depletion of
gluconolactone 6-phosphate. Similarly, levels of ribose phos-
phates (pentose phosphate isobars) were significantly reduced in
ATM and G6PD knockdown cells relative to control cells and
were further reduced on FLT3 inhibition. The reactions that
produce gluconolactone 6-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate
also generate NADPH, a key cofactor used in antioxidant de-
fense. NADPH levels were largely maintained in ATM and G6PD
knockdown cells, suggesting they are able to derive NADPH from
other pathways. FLT3 inhibition caused significant reduction in
NADPH levels in control cells, and this depletion was significantly
greater in ATM and G6PD knockdown cells (Fig. 4A), indicating

 that AML cells become more dependent on the PPP for
NADPH production on FLT3 inhibition. Another major meta-
bolic pathway impeded by ATM/G6PD and FLT3 inhibition was
glycolysis. Although glucose levels were largely maintained in
control cells on FLT3 inhibition, they were significantly reduced
in ATM and G6PD knockdown cells with FLT3 inhibition (Fig.
4B), implicating these factors in maintaining glucose homeosta-
sis. Some glycolytic intermediates, such as fructose 1,6-biphos-
phate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and lactate, were severely
reduced by FLT3 inhibition regardless of ATM/G6PD status
(Fig. S4A), indicating a glycolytic blockade at an upstream step
at the hexose phosphate level. The TCA cycle was also markedly
affected by FLT3 inhibition, including severe reductions in ace-
tyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate (Fig.
S4B). Some of these components, such as acetyl-CoA and
α-ketoglutarate, were significantly further reduced in ATM and
G6PD knockdown cells.
A large number of the metabolic effects of FLT3 inhibition
may be attributed to a substantial shutdown of central carbon
metabolism, i.e., the inability to use carbon sources such as
glucose and glutamine to generate necessary precursors for
biomass and energy production via glycolysis and the TCA cycle.
Although glucose levels were largely maintained on FLT3 in-
hibition in Molm13 control cells, NMR analysis of 13C labeled
glucose showed a clear defect in glucose uptake with AC220 in
Molm13 cells (Fig. S4C). Thus, decreased glucose utilization,
due to impairment of both the PPP and glycolytic pathways,
likely accounts for why glucose fails to be depleted on FLT3
inhibition. Similarly, MS analysis of Molm13 cell supernatants
showed decreased uptake of glucose on FLT3 inhibition that is
further exacerbated in ATM knockdown cells (Fig. S4D), which
could account for the reduced glucose levels observed in ATM/
G6PD knockdown cells treated with AC220. Additionally, up-
take of glutamine was impaired on FLT3 inhibition and further
impaired with ATM knockdown. Examination of steady-state
glutamine levels after FLT3 inhibition showed a marked de-
pletion of glutamine, which was further exacerbated by either
ATM or G6PD knockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the
metabolomic data suggest that many aspects of central carbon
metabolism in Molm13 cells are substantially suppressed when
FLT3 is inhibited and that ATM and G6PD act to help support
central carbon metabolism through maintenance of glucose and
glutamine levels on FLT3 inhibition.
Glutathione Metabolism Is Impaired on FLT3 Inhibition and Further
Impaired by ATM/G6PD Inhibition. Although numerous metabolic
pathways in Molm13 cells were affected by FLT3 inhibition, one
of the pathways most severely affected was that of glutathione
metabolism. As shown in Fig. 5A, levels of the reduced form of
glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant factor, were substantially
decreased in Molm13 control cells on FLT3 inhibition and fur-
ther decreased in ATM and G6PD knockdown cells. Likewise,
levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and 5-oxoproline, a product
of GSH degradation, were similarly decreased. Thus, the observed
depletion of GSH cannot simply be explained by a defect in
NADPH-dependent glutathione recycling, which would predict
an accumulation of GSSG, or increased turnover, which would
correspond to increases in intermediates and byproducts of the
γ-glutamyl cycle: 5-oxoproline and glutamate. Decreases in the
total glutathione pool (GSH+GSSG) are instead consistent with
a defect in glutathione synthesis. Indeed, the precursors of gluta-
thione, glutamate and γ-glutamyl cysteine, were depleted on FLT3
inhibition and further depleted with ATM and G6PD inactivation,
reflective of the changes observed with glutamine and consistent

 with glutamate being derived from glutamine through gluta-
minolysis. The other precursors of glutathione, cysteine and glycine,
were similarly decreased on FLT3 inhibition. NMR analysis con-
firmed decreases in glutamine, glutamate, and glutathione in
Molm13 cells on AC220 treatment (Fig. S5A). Measurement of
total glutathione levels using a luminescent-based assay showed a
dose-dependent effect of AC220 on glutathione depletion in
Molm13 control cells that was more severe in the ATM and G6PD
knockdown cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, overexpression of G6PD was
able to rescue the enhanced depletion of glutathione in ATM
knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). In summary, multiple experiments
support the conclusion that glutathione anabolism is compromised
in Molm13 cells on FLT3 inhibition and further compromised by
inactivation of ATM or its effector G6PD.
Given that glutathione is a critical antioxidant factor that
maintains redox homeostasis in most cells, one would predict
that the glutathione depletion elicited by FLT3 inhibition would
lead to high levels of oxidative stress, which could potentially be
a major cause of cell death. To examine this possibility, Molm13
control, ATM, or G6PD knockdown cell lines were treated with
AC220 for 20 h, and total ROS levels were measured by staining
with DCFH-DA followed by flow cytometry. Surprisingly, ROS
levels were not significantly changed on treatment with AC220
(Fig. 5D). Although ROS levels were elevated to a significant
extent in both ATM and G6PD knockdown cells, ROS levels
actually went down on treatment with AC220. Similar results
were obtained using the ROS indicator dye dihydroethidium
(DHE), which specifically detects total superoxides (Fig. S5B).
Thus, despite overwhelming evidence that FLT3 inhibition
greatly decreases glutathione, effects on ROS, at least at the
global level, cannot account for the apoptosis caused by FLT3
inhibition or the influence of ATM and G6PD.
FLT3 Inhibition Causes Severe Accumulation of Mitochondrial ROS
That Is Exacerbated by ATM/G6PD Inhibition. Our results indicate
that inhibition of FLT3 and subsequent depletion of glutathione
in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells does not significantly affect global
ROS levels. However, given recent evidence showing that ATM
is functional in the mitochondria and is implicated in controlling
mitochondrial ROS (16–18), we explored the possibility that
FLT3 inhibition induces oxidative stress specifically in the mi-
tochondria. To this end, we used the ROS indicator MitoPY1, a
fluorescent dye that is targeted to the mitochondria and is used
to detect levels of hydrogen peroxide within this compartment
(19). As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of Molm13 cells with
AC220 led to substantial accumulation of mitochondrial perox-
ides over time, with increased detection evident as early as 1 h
after initiation of treatment. Use of the ROS indicator dye
MitoSOX Red, which specifically detects superoxides in the
mitochondria, showed a dramatic increase in mitochondrial su-
peroxides with AC220; however, it was not until 22 h after ini-
tiation of treatment (Fig. 6A). This observation could indicate
that mitochondrial superoxides are efficiently dismutated into
hydrogen peroxide until they reach a certain threshold where
superoxide production overwhelms the system.
To determine if the observed phenomenon of increased mi-
tochondrial ROS has implications for cell survival, cells were
treated with AC220 for 20 h, MitoPY1 “low” and “high” sub-
populations (defined as the ∼40% dimmest and brightest dye
fluorescence) were sorted and reseeded at the same concentra-
tion in drug-free media, and viability was assessed after 72 h.
Whereas surviving cells in the MitoPY1 high subpopulation were
almost completely undetectable, cells in the MitoPY1 low sub-
population retained the ability to survive and proliferate (Fig.
6B). It is worth noting that Molm13 cells treated for 72 h with
AC220 and then allowed to recover for 4 d were just as sensitive
to retreatment with AC220 as the original population (Fig. S6A),
indicating that resistance displayed by the mitochondrial ROS
low subset is transient and these cells do not represent a stable
subpopulation. Pretreatment of Molm13 cells with the lipophilic
antioxidant vitamin E significantly suppressed the levels of mito-
chondrial peroxides induced by AC220 treatment but not super-
oxides (Fig. 6C), and resulted in substantial inhibition of apoptosis
(Fig. 6D). AC220 treatment of other FLT3-dependent cell lines,
MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD+) and Mono-Mac-6 (FLT3-V592A), but
not FLT3 WT THP-1, caused significantly increased levels of

 mitochondrial peroxides (Fig. S6B), which inversely correlated
with cell viability (Fig. S6C). All together, these data suggest that
high mitochondrial peroxide levels are causative in apoptosis on
FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells.
Although inhibition of glutathione synthesis (with BSO) or
inhibition of the PPP (with DHEA) were both sufficient to in-
crease levels of mitochondrial ROS, inhibition of both was re-
quired to majorly elevate ROS levels, to the extent that reflects
FLT3 inhibition (Fig. S6D). Notably, increased mitochondrial
ROS is not a universal consequence of all TKIs, as treatment of
K562 CML with high doses of the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib that
are known to cause apoptosis (20, 21) failed to cause substantial
induction of mitochondrial ROS (Fig. S6E).
Finally, inhibition of ATM either using the ATM inhibitor
KU55933 or genetic knockdown caused further increases in
mitochondrial ROS on FLT3 inhibition with AC220 (Fig. 6E).
Similarly, inhibition of G6PD using either the G6PD inhibitor
DHEA or genetic knockdown exacerbated mitochondrial ROS
induced by AC220 (Fig. 6F). Thus, there is a strong correlation
between increased mitochondrial ROS, decreased glutathione
levels, and the increased apoptosis observed with either ATM or
G6PD inhibition. These data further support the conclusion that
mitochondrial ROS are causative in FLT3 inhibitor-induced
apoptosis. Moreover, they implicate ATM and G6PD as key
mediators of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and survival of a
subpopulation of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells on treatment with
FLT3 inhibitors.

 the ability of these cells to maintain lower levels of mitochondrial
ROS through the actions of ATM and G6PD. Although these
data advocate the targeting of ATM or G6PD as a therapeutic
strategy to improve the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in treating
FLT3-dependent AML, clinically viable drugs directly targeting
these factors are not yet available. However, if increased mito-
chondrial ROS could be achieved using alternative means, it
could be quite effective in enhancing AML cell killing. To ex-
plore this therapeutic strategy, we tested the effects of several
drugs known or suspected to cause mitochondrial oxidative stress
in leukemia cells, including phenformin and elesclomol (electron
transport chain inhibitors) (22, 23), tigecycline (inhibitor of mi-
tochondrial translation) (24), and valproic acid (shown to impair
ATM levels and induce ROS) (25) for their ability to augment
mitochondrial ROS production when combined with FLT3 inhibitor
AC220 in Molm13 cells. Elesclomol at nanomolar concentrations
was shown to be as effective as ATM or G6PD inhibitors
(KU5593 or DHEA) at inducing mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 7A)
and reducing cell viability (Fig. S7A) in combination with AC220
and thus was chosen for further study. Elesclomol, which has
been evaluated in clinical trials for melanoma, has been shown to
selectively transport copper into the mitochondria, to disrupt
multiple components of the electron transport chain, and to
promote overproduction of mitochondrial ROS (26–28). In
combination with AC220, elesclomol caused synergistic cell
killing in both Molm13 cells and MV4-11 cells (Fig. 7 B and C
and Table S2). Elesclomol treatment caused a dose-dependent
increase in mitochondrial peroxide levels in both Molm13 and
MV4-11 cells in combination with AC220 (Fig. 7D), which cor-
related with decreased cell viability (Fig. S7B). Moreover, this
drug combination caused synergistic reductions in cell viability in
multiple primary FLT3-ITD+ AML patient samples, most nota-
bly at higher drug concentrations (Fig. 7E and Table S2). In
contrast, AC220/elesclomol was not synergistic in killing FLT3
WT AML cell lines (NOMO-1, OCI-AML3, or THP-1; Fig.
S7C), FLT3 WT primary samples (AML 11 and 41; Fig. S7D), or
FLT3 D835 mutant AML (AML 30; Fig. S7D), a mutation that
prevents binding of AC220, strongly arguing that efficacy of the
drug combination is not due to off-target effects of AC220.
These results demonstrate that elesclomol can be effective at
enhancing FLT3-ITD+ AML cell elimination with a FLT3 in-
hibitor, at least in vitro.
To test the efficacy of elesclomol combined with a FLT3 in-
hibitor in vivo, we used a patient-derived xenograft model of
FLT3-ITD+ AML. Primary leukemic cells from a patient with
FLT3-ITD+ AML were engrafted into NSG mice, and after
mean leukemic burden in the peripheral blood reached ∼10%,
therapy was initiated using vehicle, elesclomol, AC220, or ele-
sclomol and AC220 in combination (n = 5/group). Although
elesclomol was ineffective by itself, leukemia cells in the pe-
ripheral blood became undetectable in the AC220 and combi-
nation groups after 1 wk of therapy (Fig. S7E) and remained so
until day 21 (Fig. 8A), at which point the mice were taken off
therapy. It should be noted that no hematopoietic or other
toxicities were observed over the course of therapy. On days 28
and 35, relapses in the AC220 monotherapy group were evident,
whereas leukemia in the combination group remained low/un-
detectable (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8B shows that, after cessation of
therapy, leukemic burden remained lower in the combination
group compared with the AC220 group throughout the course of
the experiment, demonstrating that a deeper remission was
achieved. Moreover, the combination therapy extended survival
of mice by ∼1 wk compared with AC220 therapy alone (Fig. 8C).
Although the survival improvement was modest with short-term
therapy, these data demonstrate the potential of using a pro-oxidant
drug as adjuvant therapy for improving the efficacy of FLT3 in-
hibitors in the treatment of FLT3-ITD+ AML. Other pro-oxidant
adjuvant therapies are currently being explored. The same thera-
peutic strategy should be applicable to other tumor types where
inhibition of the driving oncogene compromises glutathione me-
tabolism and impairs mitochondrial redox homeostasis.
Discussion
The promise of molecularly targeted cancer therapies has gen-
erated substantial excitement in recent years with the clinical
success of TKIs targeting oncogenic driver proteins, including
BCR-ABL for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia,
EGFR and ALK for non–small-cell lung cancer, HER2 for
breast cancer, BRAF for melanoma, and FLT3 for AML, among
others (29). However, for most TKIs, including those targeting
FLT3, the therapeutic benefit is transient due to development of
resistance and relapse, reflecting the inability of TKI therapy to
sufficiently eradicate the tumor cells. The effectiveness of on-
cogene-targeted therapy relies on a concept called “oncogene
addiction,” the phenomenon where some tumors, despite having

 an array of genetic abnormalities, are dependent on a single
dominant oncogene for growth and survival (30). Although there
have been myriad studies exploring the use of oncogene-targeted
therapies that exploit the concept of oncogene addiction for
treating various cancers, only a modicum of these studies have
attempted to explain the precise mechanism by which oncogene
inactivation causes tumor cell ablation. The data presented here
demonstrate that acute inhibition of FLT3 results in severe
metabolic deficiencies, including depletion of glutathione, lead-
ing to high levels of mitochondrial ROS that promote apoptosis.
Thus, “FLT3 addiction” in AML could be explained, at least
partly, by the reliance of tumor cells on FLT3 driven metabolism
for maintenance of mitochondrial redox homeostasis that is es-
sential for cell survival.
It has long been appreciated that cancer cells are character-
ized by an increased rate of ROS production relative to normal
cells and an altered redox state (31). Oncogenes have been
shown to promote highly anabolic cellular metabolism and the
production of ROS, which can contribute to the tumorigenic
process through the activation of various signaling pathways that
control cellular growth and proliferation (32); however, excessive
levels of ROS can also induce apoptosis (33). Indeed, there is
also evidence that oncogenes actively up-regulate antioxidant
mechanisms to avoid this fate (34). There has recently been
extensive focus on exploring ways to exploit the altered redox
state of tumor cells through the use of pro-oxidant therapies,
thus far with limited success, at least as monotherapy (35–37).
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS in most cells and are
highly dependent on mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, such as
glutathione peroxidase (about one third of glutathione peroxi-
dase is mitochondrial) to avoid their deleterious effects (38).
Given our data showing that FLT3 inhibition causes a severe
decrease in glutathione levels in AML cells, it is not surprising
that this results in a severe increase in ROS in the mitochondria.
Glutathione represents the major ROS detoxification system
in cells, and the idea of targeting glutathione as an anticancer
strategy has been explored for several tumors, including AML
(35). CD34+ AML cells were found to have aberrant glutathione
metabolism and were sensitive to therapies that further disrupted
the glutathione pathway, such as parthenolide and piperlongu-
mine, and it was proposed that AML cells are addicted to glu-
tathione (39). Our results in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells support this
hypothesis, because FLT3 inhibitors were shown to deplete
glutathione, which correlated with increased mitochondrial ROS
and the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our data strongly
support the therapeutic strategy of promoting mitochondrial
ROS in combination with FLT3 inhibition. We have shown that
FLT3-ITD+ AML cells that survive FLT3 inhibition have lower
levels of mitochondrial ROS. However, these cells may still be on
the brink of ROS induced apoptosis and thus hypersensitive to
any further oxidative stress. Because glutathione metabolism is
driven by FLT3 in FLT-ITD+ AML cells, but not in normal cells,
FLT3 inhibitors should not perturb glutathione levels in normal
cells. Furthermore, FLT3 inhibited AML cells may be sensitive
to mitochondrial pro-oxidant therapies at doses that would be
innocuous to normal cells.
Our data show that one avenue for elevating mitochondrial
ROS levels is through inhibition of ATM. ATM is well known for
its roles in mediating the DNA damage response (40); however,
a plethora of recent data implicate ATM as a first responder to a
variety of cellular stresses (41). Several studies have demon-
strated a role for ATM in the response to oxidative stress (13). It
has been shown that oxidation of ATM directly leads to its ac-
tivation (42) and that ATM activates G6PD to reroute glucose
into the PPP for the production of NADPH to combat oxidative
stress (15). In accordance with these studies, we showed that
ATM inactivation impairs G6PD activity in AML cells and fur-
ther reduces NADPH levels on FLT3 inhibition. However, ef-
fects on NADPH are insufficient to explain the observed further
depletion of total glutathione and its glutamine-derived precur-
sors in ATM/G6PD knockdown cells on FLT3 inhibition, which
is indicative of impaired de novo glutathione synthesis. We show
that ATM inactivation has widespread effects on cellular me-
tabolism in the context of FLT3 inhibition, engendering a pri-
mary defect in central carbon metabolism. ATM has numerous
substrates in the cell, and the metabolic effects of ATM in-
activation could possibly be explained through its regulation of
metabolic effectors such as AKT, AMPK and mTORC1 (43, 44).
However, the metabolic effects of ATM knockdown were largely
mimicked by G6PD knockdown, implicating G6PD as the major
metabolic effector downstream of ATM. Indeed, knockdown of
either ATM or G6PD in the context of FLT3 inhibition caused

 further decreases in intracellular glucose and glutamine, major
sources for central carbon metabolism. It has previously been
shown that a proportion of ATM is localized in the mitochondria
and that ATM deficiency is associated with increased mito-
chondrial ROS (16–18), consistent with our data from AML
cells. Together, these results suggest a model in which ATM acts
as a sentinel for mitochondrial ROS, activating G6PD and the
PPP when ROS levels become excessive, such as on FLT3 in-
hibition, to quell oxidative stress through up-regulation of glu-
tathione metabolism and possibly other pathways.
The effects of FLT3 inhibition on AML cellular metabolism have
not previously been explored. Our data strongly argue that FLT3 is a
major driver of anabolic metabolism, consistent with the normal role
of FLT3 in promoting the robust proliferation of early hematopoi-
etic progenitor cells (45). Many tumor cells are highly dependent on
glutamine for glutaminolysis, a mitochondrial pathway producing
glutamate, which can then be converted into α-ketoglutarate to fuel
the TCA cycle or used as a precursor for glutathione synthesis (46,
47). Deficient glutamine uptake could account for the decline in
glutamine/glutamate levels we observed in AML cells on FLT3 in-
hibition and the impaired glutathione production that makes them
hypersensitive to oxidative stress. This same phenomenon may occur
in other tumors that are driven by oncogenes that promote gluta-
mine uptake and catabolism, i.e., inactivation of the driving onco-
gene could lead to defective glutamine metabolism and subsequent
glutathione depletion, making the cells highly vulnerable to oxida-
tive stress. Thus, the strategy of using a pro-oxidant agent as an
adjuvant to oncogene-targeted therapy could be broadly applicable
for the improved treatment of many tumors.

FBS. 32D cell lines were obtained from C. Porter (University of Colorado, Aurora,
CO) and cultured as described previously for Ba/F3 cells (49). For generation of
shRNA-expressing cell lines, lentivirus was produced using pLKO.1 constructs
(obtained from The Functional Genomics Facility at CU Boulder), transductions
were performed as described previously (49) and cells were selected and main-
tained in puromycin (2.0 μg/mL). Cell lines expressing G6PD were generated
similarly using pLX304 constructs and with selection in 10 μg/mL blasticidin. Cell
lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat examination and tested
negative for mycoplasma using the e-Myco plus PCR Detection Kit (iNtRON).
Cell Viability Assays. Cells were seeded at 0.5–1.0 × 105/mL in triplicate wells
of 48-well tissue culture plates. Where indicated, the cells were treated with
drug for a period of 24–72 h. After treatment, a sample of cells from each well
was stained with PI (10 μg/mL), and viable cells (PI−) were counted with a flow
cytometer (Guava easyCyte 8HT). Alternatively, cells were stained using 7-AAD/
anti-Annexin V (Nexin reagent; Millipore EMD) to detect apoptotic cells.
Western Blots. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously
(49) using the following antibodies: ATM (11G12; Santa Cruz), G6PD (#8866;
Cell Signaling), Tubulin-α (Ab-2, DM1A; NeoMarkers), and Phospho-H2AX
(MA1-2022; Pierce).
Cell Metabolic Assays. To measure G6PD activity, the G6PD Activity Assay (Cell
Signaling) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To measure
glutathione levels, the GSH/GSSG-Glo or GSH-Glo Assay (Promega) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Metabolomics Analysis. Metabolomics analyses were performed as previously
reported (50). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells and 20 μL cell media were extracted in
1.0 mL and 980 μL cold lysis/extraction buffer (methanol:acetonitrile:water
5:3:2), respectively. After discarding protein pellets, water- and methanol-
soluble fractions were run through a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatog-
raphy and C18 reversed phase column (phase A: water, 0.1% formic acid; phase
B: acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Phenomenex) through an ultra-high perfor-
mance chromatographic system (Ultimate 3000; Thermo Fisher). UPLC was cou-
pled on line with a high-resolution quadrupole Orbitrap instrument run in either
polarity modes (QExactive; Thermo Fisher) at 140,000 resolution (at 200 m/z).
Metabolite assignment and peak integration for relative quantitation were
performed through the software Maven (Princeton), against the Kyoto Ency-
clopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database and an in-house validated
standard library (>650 compounds; Sigma Aldrich; IROATech). Integrated peak
areas were exported into Excel (Microsoft) and elaborated for statistical
analysis (t test, ANOVA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) through
Prism (GraphPad Software) and GENE E (Broad Institute), respectively.
ROS Measurements. Cells (1 × 105) were treated with drug as indicated,
washed in PBS, resuspended in 150 μL 5 μM dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein

Elesclomol cooperates with a FLT3 inhibitor in eliminating FLT3-ITD+ AML cells in vivo. NSG mice were engrafted with primary FLT3-ITD+ leukemia, and groups
of mice (n = 5) were treated with vehicle, elesclomol (50 mg/kg), AC220 (10 mg/kg), or elesclomol and AC220 in combination for 21 d. (A) Leukemic burden was
monitored weekly by peripheral blood (PB) draws and quantitation of leukemic cells (human CD45+, HLA-ABC+ cells) by flow cytometry on the indicated day after
therapy is shown. (B) Weekly monitoring of leukemic burden in PB indicates a deeper response in combination-treated mice relative to AC220-treated mice.
(C) Kaplan–Meier curves showing survival of mice receiving the indicated therapy. Statistical significance determined using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.

 diacetate (DCFH-DA), 10 μM DHE, 5 μM MitoSox Red, or 10 μM MitoPY1 in
serum-free media, and incubated at 37 °C for 15–60 min. Cells were washed
in cold FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer, and immediately analyzed
by flow cytometry. All dyes were from Molecular Probes/Life Technologies
except MitoPY1 (Tocris Bioscience).
Mouse Experiments. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were
obtained from The Jackson Lab and bred in-house. The patient sample for
xenograft (obtained from D. Pollyea, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO)
came from a 54-y-old female with AML expressing FLT3ITD and NPM1 mu-
tations. Four-to 6-wk-old female NSG mice were pretreated with 25 mg/kg
busulfan delivered by i.p. injection. After expansion in vivo, the secondary
leukemia was harvested from the spleen and bone marrow and sub-
sequently transplanted into 6- to 10-wk-old female NSG mice for drug
treatment; 5 × 105 cells were injected i.v., and treatment started when pe-
ripheral blast count was between 4% and 17% (mean was 9.1–10% for all
groups). AC220, which was synthesized and prepared as previously described
(20), was delivered once daily p.o. Elesclomol was dissolved in 10% DMSO/
18% (vol/vol) Kolliphor and delivered once daily i.v. For monitoring leukemic
burden in mice, blood collected into heparin was hemolyzed and stained
with anti-human CD45-FITC and HLA-ABC-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience) and analyzed by
flow cytometry. Mice were killed when leukemic burden in peripheral
blood was ≥75% and before any signs of distress. The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at CU approved all mouse experiments under protocol
41414(05)1E. Primary human AML samples were obtained under Institutional
Review Board protocol 12-0173.
Statistics. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Comparisons between two
values were performed by the Student t test, unless otherwise noted.
Combination indices were calculated using the median-effect principle and
the Combination Index-Isobologram Theorem (CompuSyn software).
