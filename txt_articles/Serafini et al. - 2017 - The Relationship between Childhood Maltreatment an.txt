introduction: Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been associated with an increased 
risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviors. However, the exact nature 
of the association between CM and NSSI is currently unclear. The present review aimed 
to systematically investigate the association between CM and NSSI in adolescence 
 
and early adulthood.
Methods: A systematic search of four major electronic databases covering both medi-
cal and social science research (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and PsycINFO) was 
conducted.
Results: Overall, 20 cross-sectional studies including a total of 22,517 individuals, 
 
3 longitudinal follow-up studies including 1,728 individuals, and 3 retrospective studies 
including 62,089 individuals were selected. It appears that CM is a significant risk factor 
for both NSSI and suicide attempts. The increased vulnerability to NSSI seems to be 
related to experiences of CM, particularly sexual abuse. Gender differences were also 
found. Generally, when compared to males, females who experienced CM seem to be 
more vulnerable to presenting with NSSI and suicidal behaviors.
Conclusion: There is a positive association between CM and NSSI. The importance of 
early detection and risk reduction of self-injurious behavior for adolescents is discussed.
Keywords: childhood maltreatment, physical/sexual abuse, emotional neglect, non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal 
behaviors
iNTRODUCTiON
Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) may be defined as the direct, deliberate destruction of one’s own 
body without suicidal intent (1), and it has been described as a serious public health concern for 
adolescents and young adults (2). Using data from community and psychiatric samples, Grandclerc 
and colleagues (3) reported that the prevalence of adolescent NSSI is between 10 and 35%. 
Individuals experiencing NSSI thoughts and those engaging in NSSI behaviors report poorer social

relationships and greater psychosocial impairment, compared 
with their counterparts (4). Importantly, NSSI is associated 
with an increased risk of psychopathological conditions (5, 6). 
 
In adolescence, a significant percentage of both community 
self-injurers and inpatients reporting NSSI attempt suicide (7, 8).
Self-harming behavior rates in those with a history of 
child 
hood maltreatment (CM) are higher than in the general 
population (9), in line with much evidence showing that the 
psychopathological potential and consequences of CM are quite 
broad (10). CM can be subdivided into the following domains 
(11): (1) physical abuse, i.e., deliberate physical harm; (2) emo-
tional abuse such as verbal aggression significantly affecting 
the child’s wellbeing, or behaviors that may humiliate, embar-
rass, or seriously threaten the child; (3) sexual abuse, i.e., any 
type of sexual contact/behavior between a child and an adult; 
 
(4) emotional neglect, i.e., the failure to satisfy vital emotional 
and psychological needs such as love and support; and (5) physi-
cal neglect, i.e., the failure to meet basic physical needs such as 
food and shelter.
Small-to-medium associations have been reported bet-
ween CM and the presence of a recent history of NSSI (12). 
Maltreatment has also been associated with an increased risk 
of adolescent suicidal behaviors, particularly in females (13). 
Some recent evidence suggests specificity in both CM and injury 
behaviors in adolescence (14), with a history of physical/sexual 
abuse being associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts 
and a history of neglect with an increased risk of NSSI. However, 
the exact nature of the association between CM and NSSI in 
adolescence and early adulthood is currently unclear (15). The 
consequences for prolonged, chronic engagement in NSSI, or for 
intermittent versus repetitive NSSI represent additional aspects 
that need to be explored.
Thus, given this background, the present review aims to 
systematically investigate the association between CM and NSSI 
in adolescence and early adulthood. We hypothesized that CM is 
associated with an increased vulnerability to NSSI, although we 
postulated that this association may be moderated or mediated 
by other factors, not necessarily linked to the characteristics of 
CM. Therefore, the present review seeks to add to the literature 
on the link between CM and NSSI, while providing a more in 
depth analysis of the paths leading to NSSI following an experi-
ence of CM.
MeTHODS
eligibility Criteria
We adopted the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
 
and Meta-Analyses” guidelines (16). We included studies that 
explicitly mentioned the association between child maltreatment 
(OR child abuse OR child neglect) AND NSSI in childhood, 
adolescence, or adulthood. When a title or abstract seemed to 
describe a study suitable for inclusion, the full-text article was 
obtained and carefully examined to evaluate its relevance for our 
work. Our exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies published 
before 1980; (2) studies without abstracts or with abstracts that 
did not explicitly mention the association between CM and 
NSSI or self-harm in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood; 
 
(3) studies that were not published in English; (4) systematic 
reviews or meta-analytic studies on the topic; and (5) studies 
 
in which maltreatment was perpetrated by other children.
information Sources
We conducted a systematic search of four major electronic 
databases including medical and social science studies (PubMed, 
Scopus, Science Direct, and PsycINFO) for titles and abstracts 
relevant to our research questions. We also examined the bib-
liographies of the retrieved articles for additional papers that 
might be relevant. Overall, the papers we examined covered the 
period between 1996 and 2016.
Search Terms
The following search query was used in all databases: “child 
maltreatment” AND “non-suicidal self-injury” OR “child 
abuse” AND “non-suicidal self-injury” OR “child neglect” AND 
 
“non-suicidal self-injury.”
Selection of Studies
Articles were screened and selected in a two-step process to 
minimize bias. First, three independent researchers (Giovanna 
Canepa, Giulia Adavastro, and Jacopo Nebbia) conducted the 
literature search. Any discrepancies between the three reviewers 
who examined the studies independently for possible inclu-
sion were resolved by consultation with the senior reviewers 
(Gianluca Serafini and Mario Amore). In the second phase, full-
text articles that met our inclusion criteria were retrieved and 
independently reviewed by Gianluca Serafini and Mario Amore, 
who discussed the design and characteristics of the studies to 
decide whether they could be included in the review. If there 
were doubts about a particular study, then that study was put 
on the list of those awaiting assessment, pending acquisition of 
more information, and was then carefully reanalyzed for pos-
sible inclusion. Any disagreements in this step were solved by 
discussion between reviewers.
Data Collection Process
Giovanna Canepa, Giulia Adavastro, and Jacopo Nebbia extracted 
the following data elements from the 37 studies screened for 
 
this review (see “Study Sample” below): author/s and publica 
tion 
year, presence/absence of control group, psychiatric diagnosis, 
study design, sample size, physical or biological assessment, 
psychometric instruments, sample characteristics, limitations, 
and main conclusions (for more details, see Table 1). Reviewers 
acquired the full-text of all 37 articles.
Summary Measures
The quality of the 26 studies eventually used for this review was 
evaluated using the following criteria: (1) representativeness of 
the sample (0–2 points); (2) presence and representativeness of 
control group (0–2 points); (3) presence of follow-up (0–2 points); 
(4) evidence-based measures of CM [e.g., Childhood Experiences 
of Care and Abuse Interview, Child Trauma Questionnaire 
(CTQ), Childhood Maltreatment Interview Schedule-Short 
Form, Comprehensive Trauma Interview, Christchurch Trauma 
Assessment, Abuse and Perpetration Inventory, Childhood

Study Sample
The searches in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and PsycInfo 
revealed, after the removal of duplicates, a total of 26 potentially 
relevant articles about CM and NSSI. Overall, the search in 
PubMed generated 34 articles for maltreatment, 32 for abuse, 
and 33 for neglect; the search in Scopus generated 7 articles 
for maltreatment, 19 for abuse, and 2 for neglect; the search in 
Science Direct generated 5 articles for maltreatment, 4 for abuse, 
and 2 for neglect, whereas the search in PsycInfo did not provide 
any article. Moreover, we extracted another 14 studies from the 
reference lists of these articles. Of all these, 115 were excluded 
because they were duplicates, or they were without an abstract, 
or they had an abstract that did not explicitly mention NSSI 
and a form of CM, or they were not written in English. Then, 11 
articles were excluded because they were on self-mutilation or 
self-harm and did not mention NSSI. Thus, 26 met our inclusion 
criteria and were therefore used for the present review. Figure 1 
summarizes the main results of the search strategy (i.e., the 
identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process) used 
for selecting studies.
Study Types and Sample Characteristics
Overall, 20 cross-sectional studies—including a total of 22,517 
individuals—3 
longitudinal 
follow-up 
studies—including 
 
1,728 individuals—and 3 retrospective studies—including 62,089 
individuals—were considered. Clinical samples included 
predominantly patients with NSSI and one of the following 
psychiatric diagnoses: major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar 
disorder, substance use disorder, eating disorders, personality 
disorders or other psychiatric disorders.
Study Quality Assessment
According to our quality score system, the mean quality score 
of the 20 cross-sectional studies was 5; the mean score of the

3 longitudinal studies was 6.3; and the mean score of the 3 
 
retrospective studies was 2.3. Most of the studies (N = 19) were of 
moderate quality, one was of good quality, and six of low quality. 
The most relevant findings derived from the 26 studies we used 
are reported below.
Cross-Sectional Studies on the 
Association between CM and NSSi
Most of the studies (N = 20) were cross-sectional in nature. 
Overall, only one study (quality score 10) was considered 
 
good quality, 16 studies were of moderate quality (mean quality 
score 5.6), and three studies were of low quality (mean quality 
score 2.3). All documented a positive association between NSSI 
and CM.
In the study of Martin and colleagues (4), NSSI thoughts were 
distinguished from NSSI actions, but both NSSI thoughts and 
NSSI actions were correlated with physical abuse. Paivio and 
McCulloch (17) highlighted the importance of severity of CM 
for NSSI. Kaess et al. (18) showed that a history of adverse child-
hood experiences (in particular maternal antipathy/neglect, and 
sexual abuse) was significantly more common in patients with 
NSSI than in those without. Similar results were documented 
by Martin and colleagues in a more recent study (19) in which 
NSSI behavior was linked with perceived CM. Bernegger et al. 
(20) analyzed a sample of adults with unipolar or bipolar affective 
disorder and found that childhood sexual abuse was a risk factor 
for suicide attempts but not for self-harm in adulthood. In that 
study, females who engaged in self-harming behavior (including 
suicidal intention) or NSSI had significantly higher CTQ scores 
than controls. Small-to-medium associations between specific 
forms of CM (in particular, sexual abuse) and the presence of 
a recent NSSI were also found in the study of Glassman and 
colleagues (12). Conversely, Swannell et al. (21) did not find 
evidence for the predictive role of sexual abuse for NSSI. In the 
study of Weierich and Nock (22), only childhood sexual abuse 
was positively associated with NSSI during adolescence.
On the other hand, Thomassin and colleagues (23) found 
that sexual and emotional abuse—but not physical abuse—were 
both positively correlated with NSSI. More recently, Kara et al. 
(24) reported that, in their sample from a forensic adolescent 
population, those who engaged in NSSI showed higher rates 
of sexual abuse and were more frequently involved in multiple 
crimes. In a large (N = 2,980) study carried out by Christoffersen 
and colleagues in 2015 (25), individuals with a history of CM, 
peer victimization at school, or other adverse experiences were 
six times more likely to report NSSI than participants without 
this history. Stewart et al. (26) confirmed that sexual abuse was 
associated with NSSI in a sample of adolescents who accessed 
mental health services. Finally, in the study of Stinson and col-
leagues (27) in a sample of 381 forensic mental health inpatients,

traumatic experiences enhanced the likelihood of self-harm 
 
and suicide attempts.
Studies Demonstrating the existence of 
Mediators/Moderators in the Association 
between CM and NSSi
Overall, six studies [of which one was of good quality (quality 
score 10), four of moderate quality (mean quality score 6.25), 
and one of low quality (quality score 3)] did not find a direct 
correlation between CM and NSSI. In the study by Weismoore 
and Esposito-Smythers (28), there was no relation between 
childhood abuse and NSSI, but the association between assault 
and NSSI was significant in youth who reported more cognitive 
errors and more negative self-views. The retrospective study of 
Zetterqvist and colleagues (29) with 816 adolescents found an 
indirect association (mediated by depressive symptoms and dis-
sociation) between childhood emotional or physical/sexual abuse 
and NSSI (see Table 1). Reichl et al. (30) showed that childhood 
adversity was associated with a steeper diurnal cortisol slope 
in the NSSI group and a flattened slope in the healthy control 
group. Analyzing a cohort of 422 young adult females with eating 
disorders, Muehlenkamp et al. (31) reported that CM likely shows 
an indirect association with self-harm behavior through low self-
esteem, psychopathology, body dissatisfaction, and dissociation 
symptoms. Shenk and colleagues (32) reported that there was 
a significant association between CM and NSSI in females, but 
this relation was mediated by post-traumatic stress symptoms. 
Stewart et al. (2) also reported indirect links (between NSSI and 
physical abuse).
Studies Not Demonstrating the 
existence of an Association between  
CM and NSSi
Only the study of Johnstone and colleagues (5), conducted in 
a sample of adult outpatients with MDD, did not demonstrate 
the existence of a correlation between CM and NSSI. In that 
study, abuse was not significantly associated with NSSI or suicide 
attempts. The authors, however, reported a correlation between 
low maternal care and suicide attempts and between low pater-
nal care and NSSI.
longitudinal Follow-up Studies on the 
Association between CM and NSSi
Overall, three studies [all of moderate quality (mean quality 
score 6.3)] prospectively investigated the association between 
CM and NSSI. Kaplan and colleagues (33) reported that 
abused individuals were at increased risk of NSSI at baseline. 
Isohookana and colleagues (13) found, in their study with 
508 adolescent inpatients, that maltreatment, and specifically 
sexual abuse, was associated with an increased risk of NSSI and 
suicide attempts, although only in females. Finally, Garisch and 
Wilson (6) conducted a prospective study of 1,162 adolescent 
students and confirmed that NSSI was associated with abuse 
history.
Retrospective Studies on the Association 
between CM and NSSi
Three retrospective studies [all of low quality (mean quality 
score 2.3)] analyzed the direct association between CM and 
NSSI. Wan and colleagues (34) demonstrated that a continuous 
experience of abuse was significantly associated with NSSI, 
independently of gender. More recently, Guvendeger Doksat 
et al. (14) found that a history of neglect significantly increased 
the risk of NSSI, whereas physical/sexual abuse increased the 
odds of suicide attempts. Finally, Vaughn et al. (35) found that, 
in a nationally representative sample including subjects who 
engaged in NSSI, the severity of CM was related to clinical 
psychiatric and personality disorders.
DiSCUSSiON AND CONClUSiON
Summary of Main Findings
This review was carried out to explore the association between 
CM and NSSI in adolescence and early adulthood. We reviewed 
26 studies that investigated the association between CM and 
NSSI. Generally, it appears that experience of CM can increase 
the risk of adverse outcomes later on, in line with much evidence 
not reviewed here (36, 37). In addition, sexual abuse in childhood 
and other factors such as emotional inexpressivity, and affect 
intensity/reactivity can be particularly significant for both suicidal 
behaviors and NSSI, in line with previous findings (38–43). Only 
one study (5) reviewed here did not find a correlation between 
CM and NSSI.
There were some noteworthy gender differences. Generally, 
when compared to males, females who experienced childhood 
traumatic experiences (particularly sexual abuse) (13, 21) were 
more vulnerable to NSSI and suicidal behaviors. However, when 
physical and sexual abuse co-occurred (37) or when the experi-
ence of abuse was continuous (14), both males and females were 
at risk of NSSI and suicidal behaviors.
Some of the studies reviewed also tested or suggested poten-
tial mechanisms underlying the association between NSSI and 
CM, such as via post-traumatic stress disorder (22), depression 
(44), and emotion dysregulation (45). For instance, Weierich 
and Nock (22) found that re-experiencing and avoidance symp-
toms can mediate the relation between childhood sexual abuse 
and self-injury, even when controlling for major depression. 
Glassman et al. (12) suggested that self-criticism and cognitive 
dysregulation could mediate the relation between emotional 
abuse and self-injury, in line with much evidence that cognitive 
styles can be directly related to NSSI and suicidal behaviors 
 
(46, 47). The association between CM and NSSI was also medi-
ated by post-traumatic stress symptoms in that of Shenk and 
colleagues (32), and low self-esteem, psychopathology, body dis-
satisfaction, and dissociation symptoms in that of Muehlenkamp 
et al. (31). These findings are in line with the suggestion that 
suicidal behaviors and NSSI may represent attempts to cope with 
dissociative symptoms or to reach a dissociative state (1, 48–50). 
For example, a recent meta-analysis (49) on the link between 
dissociation and NSSI/suicide attempts showed that those with

dissociative disorders were more likely to report both previous 
suicide attempts and NSSI, compared to those without.
The association between CM and NSSI or suicidal behaviors 
was not confirmed in all studies as already suggested in the 
meta-analysis of Klonsky and Moyer (51). The absence of a 
direct association between CM and NSSI may be explained by 
the existence of mediators, as mentioned above. Some studies 
(5, 19) also suggest that high-risk family contexts rather than 
the experience of maltreatment may play a significant role in 
suicidal behaviors and NSSI.
In conclusion, therefore, CM and childhood traumatic 
experiences appear to increase the odds of NSSI and suicidal 
behaviors either directly or via other risk factors.
Main Strengths and limitations/
Shortcomings
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systemati-
cally evaluate the relation between CM and NSSI. However, our 
findings should be considered in the light of several limitations. 
First, we could not carry out a meta-analysis because the stud-
ies identified measured CM and NSSI differently. Importantly, 
we selected studies that did not exclude self-harm, suicide 
attempts, and other suicidal behaviors; this may have intro-
duced confounding. In addition, although this review aimed to 
summarize the most relevant studies on the topic, the inclusion/
exclusion of specific studies may reflect our individual point of 
view or expertise and training. Moreover, some studies included 
may have been underpowered (some had only small sample 
sizes and small numbers of subjects who engaged in NSSI). 
Another limitation is that findings may have been hampered by 
recall bias. In addition, the severity, duration, intensity, and age 
at occurrence of CM were not taken into account in all studies; 
these aspects of CM, potentially very important, should perhaps 
be considered routinely in future studies. Finally, some of the 
included studies were heterogeneous and/or did not include 
control groups.
implications and Future Directions
In conclusion, the findings of this systematic review support 
the positive association between CM and NSSI. This informa-
tion may help to early detect and rapidly recognize those who 
experienced CM as a specific group at risk for NSSI and suicidal 
behaviors. Future research should explore systematically the 
role of vulnerability and protective factors, i.e., factors that 
may act to increase or attenuate, respectively, the association 
between CM and NSSI.
