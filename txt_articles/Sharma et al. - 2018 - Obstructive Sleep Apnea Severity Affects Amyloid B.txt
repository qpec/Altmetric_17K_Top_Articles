 ABSTRACT: 
 
Rationale: Recent evidence suggests that Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) may be a risk factor 
for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. However, how sleep apnea 
affects longitudinal risk for Alzheimer’s disease is less well understood. 
 
Objective: To test the hypothesis that there is an association between severity of OSA and 
longitudinal increase in amyloid burden in cognitively normal elderly.  
 
Methods: Data was derived from a 2-year prospective longitudinal study that sampled 
community-dwelling healthy cognitively normal elderly. Subjects were healthy volunteers 
between the ages of 55 to 90, were non-depressed and had a consensus clinical diagnosis of 
cognitively normal. CSF Amyloid beta was measured using ELISA. Subjects received Pittsburgh 
compound B Positron Emission Tomography scans following standardized procedures. 
Monitoring of OSA was completed using a home sleep recording device. 
 
Measurements and Main Results: We found that severity of OSA indices (lnAHIall [F1,88=4.26, 
p<.05] and lnAHI4% [F1,87=4.36, p<.05])  were associated with annual rate of change of CSF 
Aβ42 using linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, BMI and ApoE4 status. LnAHIall and 
lnAHI4 were not associated with increases in ADPiB-mask most likely due to the small sample 
size although there was a trend for lnAHIall (F1,28=2.96, p=.09 and F1,28=2.32, n.s. respectively). 
 
Conclusion: In a sample of cognitively normal elderly, OSA was associated with markers of 
increased amyloid burden over the 2 year follow-up. Sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent 
hypoxia from OSA are likely candidate mechanisms. If confirmed, clinical interventions for OSA 
may be useful in preventing amyloid build-up in cognitively normal elderly.

 At a Glance Commentary: 
Scientific knowledge on the subject: Recent literature in both mice and humans suggests 
that disturbed sleep leads to higher levels of brain soluble beta amyloid peptides, which 
aggregates to forms senile plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This pathological 
process might be present prior to cognitive decline, indicating that disturbed sleep can be both a 
consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. 
What this study adds to the field: This longitudinal study shows that obstructive sleep apnea, 
very common in elderly, can be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease.

 INTRODUCTION: 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are both chronic disease 
conditions that are highly prevalent, cause significant morbidity and mortality to those afflicted,1;2 
and have an enormous socio-economic impact. OSA is typified by recurrent partial or complete 
obstructions of the upper airway during sleep leading to intermittent hypoxia and/or sleep 
fragmentation. OSA is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular risk, cognitive decline3 and 
multiple inflammatory and metabolic effects4-6  (for a review see7). OSA affects up to 30-80% of 
the elderly8;9 depending on how OSA is defined. The clinical relevance of these high rates in the 
elderly is unclear, as some studies demonstrate increased rates of mortality, while others 
suggest that sleepiness, cognitive impairment, hypertension and mortality associated with OSA 
decline with age.10 However, in a recent study of older women where nocturnal 
polysomnography was collected at baseline and cognition was evaluated 5 years later, OSA 
patients were more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia at follow-up.3 
In a similar study using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we 
found that reported OSA patients had an earlier age of cognitive decline to MCI and to AD than 
non-OSA controls.11 Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies, patients with 
AD were five times more likely to present with OSA than cognitively unimpaired individuals of 
similar age.12 While OSA could be a consequence of events in the progression of AD pathology, 
alternatively, OSA may precipitate AD pathogenesis. The latter would present an exciting 
opportunity to slow AD pathology with sleep interventions.  
The link between severity of OSA and risk for AD could be mediated by an increase in 
amyloid deposition as a small number of cross-sectional studies suggest. Greater Aβ burden 
using amyloid-PET, globally and regionally in the precuneus has been associated with OSA 
severity among MCI patients.13 We also demonstrated a trend toward decreased cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) levels in cognitively normal ApoE4+ carriers with OSA,14 and

 a recent cross-sectional study showed that OSA patients had lower CSF Aβ42 levels when 
compared to controls,15 suggesting that OSA might contribute to amyloid deposition and 
accelerate cognitive decline in those at risk for AD. However, so far it has been challenging to 
verify causality for these associations as OSA and AD may share common risk factors16;17 as 
well as neurodegenerative consequences17 (e.g. vascular damage, hippocampal atrophy). 
Based on the existing literature, the aims of this study were to use the NYU Center for Brain 
Health (CBH) cohort of cognitively normal healthy elderly to investigate the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations between OSA severity and changes in CSF and PET biomarkers of 
AD. 
METHODS: 
NYU Cohort: 
The NYU cohort consists of community-dwelling healthy cognitively normal volunteers and 
was derived from 3 NIH/NIA and 1 Alzheimer’s Association supported studies. All subjects 
received medical, neurological, and psychiatric evaluations, clinical labs, home monitoring for 
OSA, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, a lumbar puncture (LP) and/or a 
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scan. As such, sleep complaints were not part of the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria of these protocols nor were subjects referred to the studies from 
any sleep disorders clinic. All subjects were administered a standard neuropsychological test 
battery which has published norm values.18 
Subjects: 
Subjects were between the ages of 55 to 90, English speaking, with a minimum of 12 years 
of education, had Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)19 scores between 25–30 (inclusive), a 
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)20 of 0, were non-depressed and had a consensus clinical 
diagnosis of cognitively normal. Due to known CSF batch variations, only values that were

 either batch corrected or from the same assay date were included. Individuals using continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) or with significant medical conditions that could affect brain 
structure or function and/or MRI evidence of intracranial mass or infarcts were excluded. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants. 
 
Sleep Evaluation: 
The sleep evaluation included a sleep interview, detailed snoring history, and self-
administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).21 Home monitoring of OSA was 
completed using either an “ARES” Unicorder (Watermark)22 or an “Embletta MPR” (Natus 
Medical Inc.)23 system during a 2-night period. For most subjects, home sleep evaluations were 
completed prior to the baseline lumbar puncture (LP) and amyloid PET scan. However, there 
were few subjects (n=21) whose sleep evaluations were done after the baseline LP and amyloid 
PET scan. Out of these 21 subjects only 5 completed their follow-up LP and amyloid PET scan 
of whom were included in the longitudinal analyses. The variables used in this study were: (1) 
the apnea/hypopnea index with 4% desaturation (AHI4%), defined as the sum of all apneas 
(>90% reduction in airflow for >10 sec) and all hypopneas (>30% reduction in airflow for 10 sec) 
associated with >4% oxygen (O2) desaturation divided by the total time where both flow and 
oximetry signals were valid; (2) the AHIall, which was defined as the sum of all apneas and all 
hypopneas identified plus events with visible reduction in airflow amplitude and presence of 
inspiratory flattening ending in breaths with normalization of airflow as a surrogate for arousal,24 
divided by the total time where there was a valid flow signal irrespective of O2 saturation; and, 
(3) mean saturation of oxygen (O2Sat) during the night. Although the systems used different 
techniques of oximetry measurement, we have previously shown that OSA indices between 
these two devices are highly correlated.22 Both systems and AHI indices have been compared 
with the recommended definitions of AHI.22 Reported total sleep time (TST) duration was

 assessed using one question: “During the past month, how many hours of sleep did you usually 
get each night?”  
 
Lumbar Puncture, CSF Collection and assays: 
The procedures for the NYU lumbar puncture (LP) are published.25;26 CSF amyloid beta 
(Aβ42), total-tau (T-tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau) concentrations were 
measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (INNOTEST, Belgium). All 
assays were conducted at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Batch wise rescaling of CSF Aβ42 
was performed using linear regression with a reference batch. Before rescaling Aβ42, the 
coefficient of variation (CV) was 20%, and was reduced to 10% after rescaling. P-tau or T-Tau 
were not rescaled because the CV between batches was already relatively low (9%). CSF 
assays were done blind to clinical or sleep data. 
PiB scans: 
All subjects received PiB PET scans following standardized published procedures.27 
Parametric standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated by normalizing PiB 
uptake by cerebellar grey matter uptake.28 PiB SUVR images were processed using automated 
regions-of-interest (ROI).27 These ROIs were used to sample AD-vulnerable brain regions from 
the PiB SUVR images, including: hippocampus (Hip), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), lateral 
temporal lobe (LTL), medial frontal gyrus (MFG), posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC), 
prefrontal cortex (PFC), occipital cortex (OCC), and thalamus (Thal). The cortical PiB meta-ROI 
retention mask (ADPiB-mask) was created by combining amyloid-vulnerable IPL, LTL, MFG, 
PCC, and PFC regions.29

 Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 23, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). 
Baseline measures between OSA groups (normal, mild and moderate-severe) were examined 
based on AHI4% cutoff values (<5, 5-14.9 and ≥15 respectively) using ANOVA with post hoc 
Tukey tests for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Regression-
based z-scores corrected for age, sex, race and education, derived from our normative 
sample,18 were used for OSA group comparisons of cognitive variables (Logic 2, Animal 
Fluency [AF], Vegetable Fluency [VF]), Boston Naming Test [BNT], Digit Symbol Substitution 
Test [DSST], Trails Making Test-A [TMT-A] and Trails Making Test-B [TMT-B]); as well as for 
correlation analyses between annual rate of change of CSF Aβ42 and annual change in 
cognitive z-scores. For comparison between OSA severity groups, univariate analysis was used 
after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ApoE4 and time interval between procedures.  
 To test whether normal elderly subjects with OSA showed evidence of positive PET/CSF AD 
biomarkers, first we calculated the correlation coefficients between AD biomarkers and OSA 
indices at cross-section. Direct and partial correlations were computed, the latter adjusting for 
relevant cofactors such as age, sex, BMI and ApoE4 status. A similar approach was used for 
longitudinal analyses using delta change in amyloid biomarkers. We decided to control for these 
factors a priori given the well documented association between decreased levels of CSF Aβ42, 
old age and the presence of ApoE4 allele. Male sex and obesity were similarly included as they 
are the most important risk factors for OSA, while female sex is also a well-known risk factor for 
AD.  
To calculate the annual rate of change of CSF Aβ42 or ADPiB-mask for each subject, we used 
the change in outcome from baseline to follow-up divided by the elapsed time from baseline to 
follow-up. We then applied a hierarchical linear regression, with annual rate of change of CSF 
Aβ42 or ADPiB-mask as dependent variables and OSA indices as independent, adjusting first 
for age, sex, BMI and ApoE4 status. To control for the type of sleep recording device, we 
included it as a covariate in the model. Due to the skewness and heavy tails in the distributions

 of ADPIB-mask, non-parametric correlations were performed for comparisons between ADPiB-
mask and OSA indices. Logarithm transformations were applied to continuous measures of 
Aβ42, P-Tau, T-Tau, delta ADPiB-mask and AHI indices due to their right-skewed distributions. All 
statistical analyses were tested for violations of the model assumptions and any conflicts and 
resolutions are reported. Statistical significance was set at p<.05 using two-sided tests. 
RESULTS: 
Baseline demographics and sleep characteristics: 
Baseline demographic and raw values of sleep characteristics are summarized in Table 1. 
Among the 208 participants, 97 were free of OSA (AHI4%<5) and considered healthy controls, 
76 had mild OSA (AHI4% 5-15), and 35 had moderate to severe OSA (AHI4%>15). Within the 
moderate to severe group only, 14 subjects had an AHI4%>30 and 6 subjects had an 
AHI4%>45. OSA patients were more commonly male and older [X2 (2,n=208)=4.26, p=.11, 
F2,205=2.36, p=0.09  respectively] and had significantly higher BMI than healthy controls 
(F2,206=9.67, p<.01). However it was not an obese group (mean BMI of 26.68±5.35 and only 14 
subjects of the 208 with a BMI>35). Moreover, using repeated measures ANOVA, BMI within 
subjects did not change significantly at follow-up (F1,105=.68, n.s.). We did not find significant 
differences across healthy controls and OSA groups in years of education, hypertension, 
diabetes, cardiovascular, thyroid disease or ApoE4 status.  Excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS) was remarkably low in the entire sample (median ESS of 5, IQR 3,8), with only 19 
subjects with an ESS>10. On univariate analysis there were no significant differences between 
OSA groups regarding TST. Overall TST was 7.03±1.12 hrs. 
Psychometric Assessment:  
Cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive characteristics of all subjects are shown in Table 
2. We did not find any statistically significant differences between OSA indices and cognition

 across healthy and OSA groups at baseline or longitudinally. To assess the relationship 
between longitudinal changes in CSF Aβ42 and cognitive performance, we performed Pearson 
correlation analyses comparing annual rate of change of CSF Aβ42 and annual change in 
cognitive z-scores. No statistically significant correlations were found: Logic 2 (r=-.12, n.s.), AF 
(r=.15, n.s.), VF (r=.09, n.s.), BNT (r=.006, n.s.), DSST (r=.16, n.s.), TMT-A (r=.001, n.s.) and 
TMT-B (r=-.08, n.s.). 
 
CSF and PET Assessment: 
From the 208 participants, 179 subjects performed a lumbar puncture (LP) at baseline. A 
second LP was obtained at follow-up in 104 subjects 2.42±0.88 years later. 86 subjects 
performed PiB scans at baseline.  A second PiB scan evaluation was obtained at follow-up in 34 
subjects 2.50±0.39 years later. 57 participants performed both the LP and the PET scans at 
baseline. 25 participants performed the LP and PET scans at both baseline and follow-up 
(Figure 5). We will refer to participants with both baseline and follow-up biomarker data 
available as “completers”, whereas subjects with only baseline biomarkers data will be referred 
to as “non-completers”. There were no differences between completers and non-completers, in 
terms of (age [t=-.27, n.s.], sex [X2=.002, n.s.], BMI [t=.40, n.s.], MMSE [t=.00, n.s.], years of 
education [t=.17, n.s.], ApoE4 status [X2=.93, n.s.], TST [t=1.18, n.s.], AHIall [t=.82, n.s.] or 
AHI4% [t=.88, n.s.]). Summary statistics of baseline, and annual changes of AD biomarkers are 
shown in Table 3. No significant associations were observed between annual changes in CSF 
Aβ42 and age (F1,93=2.23, p=.13, β=-1.68, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]= -.39 to .55, p=.13), sex 
(F1,93=.64, p=.42, β=13.64, 95% CI = -20.17 to 47.47, p=.42 ), BMI (F1,93=.16, p=.69,  β=-.61, 
95% CI=-3.67 to 2.44, p=.69) or ApoE4 (F1,93=.42, p=.51, β=-11.35, 95% CI= -46.03 to 23.32, 
p=.51). At cross-section and longitudinally, we did not find any significant differences among the 
3 OSA severity groups for CSF P-Tau or T-Tau. Similarly, no cross-sectional or longitudinal

 effects were found for CSF Aβ42 across OSA severity groups using univariate analysis. No 
significant correlation between CSF Aβ42 and AHI indices were observed at cross-section.  
However, significant correlations were observed between longitudinal change in CSF Aβ42 
levels and AHIall/AHI4 (rho=-0.24, p<.05, rho=-0.23, p<.05, respectively) and after controlling 
for age, sex, BMI and ApoE4 (rho=-0.27, p<.05, rho=-0.24, p<.05, respectively). Significant 
associations were also observed between annual rate of change of CSF Aβ42 and AHI indices at 
baseline using hierarchical linear regression model (shown in table 4), including annual rate of 
change of CSF Aβ42 as dependent and AHI indices (lnAHI4 and lnAHIall) as independent 
variables, before (F1,92=5.41, p<.05, and F1,93=4.72, p<.05 respectively)  and after accounting for 
age, sex, BMI and ApoE4 (F1,88=4.26, p<.05 and F1,87=4.36, p<.05, respectively). The effect of 
the type of sleep recording device and TST were not significant, thus we excluded them from 
the final model. Figure 1 shows the relationship between delta change in CSF Aβ42 and the AHI 
indices at baseline. Sensitivity analyses were perfomed excluding 5 subjects whose baseline 
sleep evaluation was done after their first CSF measurements. Association between lnAHI4, 
lnAHIall, and annual delta CSF Aβ42 remained unchanged. 
 
Similarly, on univariate analysis no difference in ADPiB-mask was observed between OSA 
severity groups, and no significant correlation between ADPiB-mask and AHI indices were 
observed at cross-section. However, correlations were observed between longitudinal change in 
ADPiB-mask and AHIall or AHI4 (rho=0.374, p<.05, rho=0.302, p=0.09, respectively) after 
controlling for age, sex, BMI and ApoE4. Using the same hierarchical linear regression model as 
for CSF Aβ42, no statistically significant associations were observed between annual rate of 
change of ADPiB-mask and AHIs, including annual rate of change of ADPiB-mask as dependent 
and AHI indices at baseline as independent variables after accounting for age, sex, BMI and 
ApoE4. LnAHIall and lnAHI4 were not associated with increases in ADPiB-mask most likely due

 to the small sample size as there was a trend for lnAHIall (F1,28=2.96, p=.09 and F1, 28=2.32, n.s. 
respectively). Figure 2 shows the relationship between delta change in ADPiB-mask and the 
AHIall index at baseline, both variables were corrected for normal distribution by log 
transformation.  
Further, we analyzed the association between longitudinal change in CSF Aβ42 and ADPiB-
mask. Using a Pearson correlation, a significant negative correlation between longitudinal 
change in CSF Aβ42 and ADPiB-mask was observed (r=-.44, p<.05). Using an ADPiB-mask SUVR 
≥1.4 to define presence of brain amyloid deposition (PiB+),30-32 a secondary analysis performed 
only in the initial cross-sectional cases, revealed a significant difference between the slopes of 
PiB+ and PiB- cases (Figure 3). This was confirmed by the presence of an interaction between 
PiB status and lnAHI4% (F1,29=5.54, p<.05) as well as a positive trend between AHI4% and PiB 
uptake in PiB+ subjects (rho=0.67, p=.07). Similar findings were observed for AHIall (data not 
shown). Figure 3 shows the relationships between the AHI4% and PiB SUVR uptake when 
comparing PiB+ vs. PiB- groups. 
 
DISCUSSION: 
The primary objective of this study was to determine if severity of OSA in cognitively normal 
elderly is associated with CSF and PET AD-biomarkers at cross-section and their longitudinal 
change across an approximate 2 year period. Our initial finding revealed that OSA was common 
and affected 53% of our cognitively normal community-dwelling cohort. Second, we 
demonstrated that baseline OSA severity was associated with two-year longitudinal decreases 
in CSF Aβ42 and a trend towards increases in cortical PiB-PET uptake. Such changes are 
potentially consistent with increased brain amyloid burden, which were also observed in our 
cohort (i.e., a negative correlation between longitudinal change in CSF Aβ42 and ADPiB-mask), 
suggesting that OSA may play a role in amyloid deposition in late-life. Moreover, the magnitude

 of these changes was higher than the one predicted by the presence of the ApoE4 allele alone 
(Table 4), which to date is considered the most important risk factor for sporadic AD. AHIall, 
which includes hypopneas associated with oxygen desaturation or arousals, was a better 
predictor of longitudinal increases in amyloid burden than AHI4%, which includes only 
hypopneas associated with 4% oxygen desaturation. This raises the possibility that sleep 
fragmentation is a more critical pathophysiological mechanism by which OSA contributes to AD 
risk. However, AHIall and AHI4% were highly correlated in our cohort (r=0.91, p<.01) and this 
study was unable to differentiate the individual effects of sleep fragmentation versus intermittent 
hypoxia.  
 
Although OSA severity was associated with increases in brain amyloid burden, it was not 
predictive of cognitive deterioration based on neuropsychological performance, which is in 
agreement with prior studies.33;34 This is not completely surprising given that the relationship 
between amyloid burden and cognition is probably nonlinear and dependent on additional 
factors such as tau pathology and microvascular changes. Low sensitivity of the 
neuropsychological tests used may have been another factor. Sensitivity could be increased in 
the future by employing cognitive tasks that are known to be sleep-dependent. 
Current evidence suggests that cognitive decline in AD is associated with decreases in CSF 
Aβ42 and increases in amyloid PET uptake.35 However, little is known about the temporal course 
of CSF Aβ42 in the preclinical or early stages of the disease, with some recent animal and 
human studies showing Aβ42 elevations prior to Aβ42 reductions,36;37 suggesting an intermediate 
stage of increased soluble Aβ levels prior to amyloid deposition. Interestingly, we and others 
have shown that reduced slow wave activity (SWA) at cross-section as well as one night of 
SWS disruption, are associated with increases in CSF Aβ levels, potentially as a consequence 
of increases in neuronal firing and/or decreases in amyloid clearance.38-41 It remains to be 
determined how universal a period of elevated CSF Aβ42 in humans is observed prior to a

 decline, but the above mentioned studies suggest that sleep disruption might be associated with 
elevations of CSF Aβ42 which in chronic sleep disorders such as OSA could foster its 
aggregation and manifest as longitudinal decreases in CSF Aβ42 over time such as the one 
observed in our study. This hypothesis would also explain the absence of significant 
associations at cross-section. Whether OSA-related sleep fragmentation increases AD-risk 
through disruption of SWS or other sleep stages is unknown. The ends of apneas are 
associated with arousals or awakenings that prevent sleep42 and these are more commonly 
observed in NREM1-2 and REM sleep. Apneic episodes are less common in SWS, which has 
been associated with a higher respiratory arousal threshold43;44 as well as more stable 
breathing.45 However, the temporal course of SWA has been shown to be slower in mild OSA,46 
while severe OSA patients show up to a 40% rebound in SWS duration during OSA treatment 
with CPAP,47 which suggest that changes in SWS quality may also be involved. However, a 
recent prospective study reported the association between decreased percentage of REM sleep 
and increased risk of dementia, implicating also REM sleep as a possible mediator for AD risk.48 
In addition, actigraphy-assessed arousals and circadian rhythm disruption have also been 
shown to increase the risk of MCI/dementia in the elderly,49 indicating that the relationship 
between OSA-related sleep fragmentation and amyloid deposition might not be stage-specific.  
 
Another possible mechanism by which OSA might increase amyloid deposition is through 
impairment in the CSF-ISF exchange promoted by the glymphatic system40 resulting in 
decreased clearance of ISF Aβ42. This mechanism was suggested in a recent study of 31 
controls and 10 severe OSA middle-age subjects where neuronally derived proteins were 
decreased in the OSA group when compared to controls.40 The authors propose that elevations 
in the intrathoracic and intracranial pressure as well as a sudden pressure reversal at the end of 
the apnea would impede the glymphatic flow of metabolites from ISF into CSF.40 Another 
potential pathway of impairment of CSF-ISF exchange could be cerebral edema secondary to

 intermittent hypoxia, as proposed recently in a study in which severity of OSA correlated with 
increased volume and thickness of the left lateral prefrontal cortex as well as increased 
thickness of the right frontal pole, the right lateral parietal lobules, and the left posterior cingulate 
cortex.50 Similar findings were observed as brain volume reductions after six months of 
treatment with CPAP which also suggests the existence of brain edema in OSA.51  
 
Finally, the effects of OSA directly increasing ISF Aβ42 burden as suggested by some 
intermittent hypoxia animals models,52;53 or indirectly through other intermediate mechanisms 
such as oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, inflammation, hypercoagulability, endothelial 
dysfunction or metabolic dysregulation cannot be discarded although it is feasible that these and 
other consequences of OSA may decline with age10;54 and might not be as relevant in the 
elderly as in middle age. 
 
 Among participants with initial PiB+ scans at cross-section, Figure 3 suggest that a higher 
severity of OSA is associated with greater brain Aβ deposition, while no such association is 
found in participants with PiB- scans, implying that presence or absence of amyloid burden 
might act as a moderator in these relationships.  This would be in agreement with previous 
studies showing increased amyloid deposition associated with higher AHI indices in MCI 
patients but not in cognitively normal controls at cross-section.13 We did not observe this effect 
in the CSF sample when we compared amyloid positive vs. negative cases based on the NYU 
CBH CSF bank Aβ42 cut-offs (i.e. CSF Aβ42 ng/ml <500), so this finding  should be interpreted 
with caution. It may be that the effects of OSA/hypoxia on Aβ aggregation are most pronounced 
after significant Aβ accumulation has already occurred, leading to an acceleration of further Aβ 
deposition in a feed–forward cycle13 (Figure 4) with OSA-related arousals worsening sleep 
quality and increasing amyloid deposition. In addition, 33/34 of the subjects that had PiB PET

 follow-up scans were PiB- at baseline, indicating that the observed longitudinal increases in PiB 
uptake were not dependent on amyloid status.  
 
Our observations are consistent with our hypothesis that there is an association between 
severity of OSA-related sleep fragmentation and longitudinal increase in amyloid burden in 
cognitively normal elderly. This implies that existing therapies for OSA such as CPAP could 
delay the progression to MCI or dementia in elderly with OSA, as was suggested by our 
previous epidemiological studies using the ADNI database11 and a recent cross-sectional study 
in which OSA patients showed lower CSF Aβ42 concentrations, as well as higher T-tau/Aβ42 ratio 
when compared to OSA-CPAP patients.15  
 The high prevalence of mild and moderate to severe OSA in cognitively normal elderly in 
asymptomatic adults undergoing screening for OSA as part of a protocol on memory and normal 
aging adds to the importance of these findings. Strengths of our study include that our 
community residing subjects were not recruited for the study based on sleep complaints, and 
thus should have been free of selection biases potentially affecting sleep-clinic based cohorts 
which typically include younger, more frequently male, obese and symptomatic (e.g. excessive 
daytime sleepiness, treatment resistant hypertension, etc.). We also utilized a state-of-the-art 
method for home-monitoring of OSA, as well as longitudinal standardized CSF and PET 
biomarkers. Potential weaknesses of the study were the relative short duration and the lack of 
longitudinal sleep data which did not allow us to test whether preclinical-AD brain lesions 
increase the risk for OSA, or the lack of a longer clinical assessment to test whether amyloid 
deposition is followed by cognitive decline to MCI or AD. Another limitation of the study was that 
not all subjects had a longitudinal follow up, although both completers and non-completers were 
not different in terms of sociodemographics, BMI, MMSE, AHIall or AHI4%.

 In summary, to our knowledge this study is the first to document that OSA is associated with 
longitudinal changes in amyloid burden in a sample of cognitively normal elderly. The 
implication of these findings is that we have identified a contribution of OSA in increasing the 
amyloid beta burden prior to significant cognitive decline. Our data support testing whether 
clinical interventions aimed at OSA, such as treatment with CPAP or dental appliances, could 
be implemented during the early phase in which tissue damage precedes clinical symptoms and 
neuronal dysfunction, to mitigate the progression of cognitive impairment.
