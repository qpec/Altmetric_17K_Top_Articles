Abstract
Importance—Delirium is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. The pathologic 
substrates of this association are not yet known, that is, whether they are the same as those 
associated with dementia, are independent, or are interrelated.
Objective—To examine whether the accelerated cognitive decline observed after delirium is 
independent of the pathologic processes of classic dementia.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Harmonized data from 987 individual brain donors from 
3 observational cohort studies with population-based sampling (Vantaa 85+, Cambridge City 
Over-75s Cohort, Cognitive Function and Ageing Study) performed from January 1, 1985, through 
December 31, 2011, with a median follow-up of 5.2 years until death, were used in this study. 
Neuropathologic assessments were performed with investigators masked to clinical data. Data 
analysis was performed from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. Clinical characteristics 
of brain donors were not different from the rest of the cohort. Outcome ascertainment was 
complete given that the participants were brain donors.
Exposures—Delirium (never vs ever) and pathologic burden of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid 
plaques, vascular lesions, and Lewy bodies. Effects modeled using random-effects linear 
regression and interactions between delirium and pathologic burden were assessed.
Outcomes—Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores during the 6 years 
before death.
Results—There were 987 participants (290 from Vantaa 85+, 241 from the Cambridge City 
Over-75s Cohort, and 456 from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study) with neuropathologic 
data; mean (SD) age at death was 90 (6.4) years, including 682 women (69%). The mean MMSE 
score 6 years before death was 24.7 points. The 279 individuals with delirium (75% women) had 
worse initial scores (−2.8 points; 95% CI, −4.5 to −1.0; P < .001). Cognitive decline attributable to 
delirium was −0.37 MMSE points per year (95% CI, −0.60 to −0.13; P < .001). Decline 
attributable to the pathologic processes of dementia was −0.39 MMSE points per year (95% CI, 
−0.57 to −0.22; P < .001). However, the combination of delirium and the pathologic processes of

 dementia resulted in the greatest decline, in which the interaction contributed an additional −0.16 
MMSE points per year (95% CI, −0.29 to −0.03; P = .01). The multiplicative nature of these 
variables resulted in individuals with delirium and the pathologic processes of dementia declining 
0.72 MMSE points per year faster than age-, sex-, and educational level–matched controls.
Conclusions and Relevance—Delirium in the presence of the pathologic processes of 
dementia is associated with accelerated cognitive decline beyond that expected for delirium or the 
pathologic process itself. These findings suggest that additional unmeasured pathologic processes 
specifically relate to delirium. Age-related cognitive decline has many contributors, and these 
findings at the population level support a role for delirium acting independently and 
multiplicatively to the pathologic processes of classic dementia.
Understanding the pathologic basis of cognitive impairment in whole populations is a 
prerequisite to mitigating the increasing public health burden of dementia.1 Many strands of 
investigation presuppose that Alzheimer, vascular, and Lewy body pathologic features are 
the predominant causes of dementia. This paradigm has directed the search for biomarkers, 
treatments, and potential prevention strategies. However, evidence indicates that these 
classic pathologic processes do not fully account for the clinical syndrome,2 especially in 
unselected populations of the oldest-old.3,4 For example, older people may have a large 
burden of the pathologic processes of classic dementia but no associated clinical dementia 
and vice versa.
Delirium is a syndrome of acute brain dysfunction characterized by inattention and other 
mental status impairments. It is a major public health problem that affects at least 20% of 
older inpatients and has well-documented adverse associations.5 An emerging literature 
reveals that delirium is a strong predictor of new-onset dementia and acceleration of existing 
cognitive decline.6–10 These results are consistent across several different settings: after 
hospitalization,11 in those with dementia,6,12 in postoperative patients,13 and in a 
community population.8 In multiple animal models of neurodegeneration, triggers of acute 
cognitive dysfunction, such as systemic inflammation, also exacerbate the pathologic 
processes14,15 and accelerate functional decline during longer periods.16,17 This finding 
implies that delirium and/or its causes can contribute to the overall burden of dementia. 
Moreover, research indicates that 3 of 10 cases are preventable,18 which in turn suggests 
that delirium interventions might reduce at least some cognitive decline and dementia.
Although delirium is now established as a strong predictor of cognitive decline in older 
adults,6,8,12 whether it accounts for additional, interrelated, or unexplained pathologic 
injury that contributes to dementia has not previously been examined. It is possible that 
when dementia follows delirium it has a different pathologic profile compared with 
dementia that develops without delirium. Therefore, understanding how delirium affects the 
evolution of dementia in the context of a particular burden of pathologic findings may offer 
new insights into independent mechanisms that explain cognitive decline after delirium.
In this study, the challenge was to examine a key hypothesis: that faster cognitive decline 
associated with delirium would act independently of the cognitive decline associated with 
the pathologic processes of classic dementia. Accordingly, we investigated the extent to 
which delirium and the pathologic processes of classic dementia contributed to associated

 cognitive decline in 3 unselected, population-based cohort studies with neuropathologic 
autopsy data: the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS), 
the Cambridge City Over-75s Cohort (CC75C), and the Vantaa 85+ study. These studies 
represent the entirety of such studies conducted in Europe and provide a unique opportunity 
to increase the understanding of the clinical significance of delirium and its interrelation 
with the pathologic processes of dementia in the general population.
Methods
The individual studies have previously been described in detail,19–21 and participant-level 
data have been harmonized as the Epidemiological Clinicopathological Studies in Europe 
(EClipSE) collaboration.22 Briefly, participants were sampled from general practitioners’  
registers (CFAS [1991-2011] and CC75C [1985-2011] in the United Kingdom) and the 
Population Register Centre (Vantaa 85+ in Finland [1991-2001]) from January 1, 1985, 
through December 31, 2011. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2012, through 
December 31, 2013. The CFAS recruited persons 65 years or older, the CC75C recruited 
persons 75 years or older, and Vantaa 85+ recruited persons 85 years or older. Individuals 
were assessed mostly at 2- to 4-year intervals, with some subsamples having annual 
evaluation. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)23 was performed in all 3 studies. 
Additional neuropsychological batteries were also performed, with some differences among 
the studies (eAppendix in the Supplement). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of each 
cohort. Previous work found that participants in the brain donor programs had no systematic 
differences in clinical characteristics compared with other participants in the cohorts,24 
although donors in the CFAS were selected by stratified random sampling, weighted to those 
who were older and cognitively impaired. Each study had local ethical approval (CFAS 
centers: Cambridge: North West Anglia Health Authority Local Research Ethics Committee 
[Peterborough]; Huntingdon Local Research Ethics Committee; Cambridge Local Research 
Ethics Committee; Gwynedd: Gwynedd Hospitals National Health Service Trust–North 
West Health Authority Research Ethics Committee (West); Liverpool: Liverpool Local 
Research Ethics Committee; Newcastle: Newcastle & North Tyneside Health Authority–
Joint Ethics Committee; Northumberland and Tyne & Wear Health Authority–Local 
Research Ethics Committee; Nottingham: Queen’ s Medical Centre National Health Service 
Trust Ethics Committee; Nottingham University Medical School Ethical Committee; City 
Hospital Ethics Committee; Oxford: Oxfordshire Health Authority: Central Oxford Research 
Ethics Committee; CC75C: Cambridge Research Ethics Committee; and Vantaa 85+: Ethics 
Committee of the City of Vantaa). Written informed consent was provided for each study, 
and all analyses were conducted with deidentified data.
Delirium Assessments
In the CFAS and CC75C, delirium symptoms were a feature of the standardized interview 
schedules administered by trained interviewers to participants and informants. These 
schedules assigned diagnostic groups based on validated, structured algorithms for 
psychiatric disorders, themselves based on DSM-III-R or related classifications.25 
Questions included the following: “Were there brief episodes during the 24 hours when s/he 
seemed much worse and then times when quite clear?” “Were there marked fluctuations in

 his/her level of attention or alertness?” “Could a physical illness…be sufficient explanation 
for the subject’ s mental or psychiatric symptoms (eg, delirious due to acute infection)?” A 
full list of relevant questions is given in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
At each interview in the Vantaa 85+ study, the examining neurologists assessed participants 
and informant(s) for a history of any episodes of delirium, with reference to a checklist of 
DSM-III-R criteria for delirium diagnosis.26 The reported history was corroborated with 
medical case records that were available at the time of assessment such that the study 
ascertainment of delirium was retrospectively derived from multiple sources and the overall 
diagnosis accepted if the examining neurologists judged there was sufficient evidence from 
participant and informant recall and/or indication in the medical records.
Neuropathologic Analyses
Paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples were used to assess neuropathologic markers with 
investigators masked to clinical data. Each study reported Braak stage as a semiquantitative 
measure of � neurofibrillary tangles and neocortical amyloid plaque burden from the 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’ s Disease protocol.27 The presence of 
infarcts (>10 mm), lacunes, and hemorrhage was histologically assessed using hematoxylin-
eosin. Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra were assessed with hematoxylin-eosin but also 
included immunohistochemical staining against �-synuclein (or ubiquitin in some of the 
earlier CC75C specimens) (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Consistent with previous approaches, delirium exposure was operationalized as never or 
ever.8 Change in MMSE score before death was modeled using a time-to-death random-
effects (random slopes) model.28 We were interested in estimating the final trajectory 
toward death because this approach makes associations with pathologic data easier to define. 
The mean time from the start of the trajectory identified by the model to death was 5.2 years; 
therefore, the start point (intercept) for this trajectory was set (centered) at 6 years. This start 
point is not so near the point of death that rates of change (slopes) cannot be estimated yet 
not so far from death that the pathologic findings at autopsy might not plausibly be related to 
the estimated parameters. Six years before death is also comparable to start points from 
change-point models of the final trajectory of cognitive decline29–31 and in the range 
observed in other analyses (3-8 years).32 Models were adjusted for baseline MMSE score, 
age at death (centered at a mean age of 90 years), sex (0 for men, 1 for women), years of 
education (0-3, 4-7, 8-11, or ≥12), and study. Missing data were assumed to be missing at 
random given that outcome ascertainment was essentially complete in this brain donor 
cohort.
The 4 neuropathologic variables of classic dementia that contribute the greatest population-
attributable risk for dementia4 were examined: Braak stage (neurofibrillary tangles), 
neocortical amyloid plaques, vascular pathologic findings (large artery infarcts, lacunes, or 
hemorrhage), and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. In keeping with previous methods, 
neuropathologic variables were dichotomized (0, none to mild; 1, moderate to severe).3,8,24

 were assigned a pathologic burden score based on the number of times they scored in the 
higher category for each of the 4 markers. Therefore, the overall pathologic burden score 
ranged from 0 to 4 (ie, being in the lower category for all markers [pathologic burden score 
of 0], in the upper category of all 4 markers [pathologic burden score of 4], or some 
combination). Finally, interactions between delirium and pathologic burden ([delirium 
history] × [pathologic score]) in terms of their effect on both the start point (−6 years before 
death) and rate of change of MMSE scores were calculated. Full details are given in the 
eAppendix in the Supplement. All analyses were conducted with STATA statistical software, 
version 12.1 (StataCorp). P values were calculated though tests of maximum likelihood, 
where P < .05 was considered significant. All tests were 2-tailed.
Results
There were 987 participants (290 from Vantaa 85+, 241 from the CC75C, and 456 from the 
CFAS) with neuropathologic data (mean [SD] age at death, 90 [6.4] years; 472 females 
[67%] without delirium and 210 [75%] with delirium). Table 2 describes the characteristics 
of the sample. Persons with delirium were slightly older, more likely to be women, and more 
likely to have more years of education. Neocortical amyloid plaques, vascular pathologic 
findings, or Lewy bodies were not significantly different in individuals with and without a 
history of delirium.
Results from the random-effects models that described delirium and cognitive decline are 
presented in Table 3. The median number of longitudinal observations for participants in the 
model was 2 (interquartile range, 1-4). In the fully adjusted model (including delirium and 
pathologic burden), the start point was estimated at 24.7 MMSE points. The start point 
should be interpreted as the estimated MMSE score 6 years before death in persons in whom 
all covariates are in the reference category (eg, youngest age, no delirium). For the typical 
90-year-old, the mean base rate of decline was 0.35 points per year (base rate indicates all 
covariates in the reference category, eg, no delirium, lowest pathologic score). There was no 
significant influence of study source (Vantaa 85+, CC75C, or CFAS) on the model estimates 
(eAppendix in the Supplement).
Effect of Delirium on Start Point and Rate of Change
Delirium was associated with a mean 2.8-point lower MMSE score (P < .001) 6 years before 
death. For these persons, the rate of change was an additional 0.37 points per year (P < .
001). These coefficients are additive. Therefore, for the typical individual aged 90 years at 
death with delirium, the estimated MMSE score is 24.7 points (baseline) with −2.8 points 
equaling 21.9 MMSE points, declining at 0.35 points (base rate) with −0.37 (attributable to 
delirium) equaling 0.72 points per year.
Effect of Pathologic Burden on Start Point and Rate of Change
An increasing pathologic burden score was associated with a lower MMSE score (−0.7 for 1 
instance of high dementia pathologic marker, −2.2 point for 2 markers, and −4.4 for 3 or 
more markers; P < .001). Pathologic burden conferred an additional 0.39-point decline in 
MMSE score over and above the effects of age and delirium (P < .001).

 Interaction Between Delirium and Pathologic Burden
A significant interaction between delirium and pathologic burden estimated an additional 
decline of 0.16 MMSE points per year (P = .01). Therefore, individuals with delirium and 
high dementia pathologic burden had estimated rates of decline of −0.35 points (base rate), 
−0.37 points (attributable to delirium), −0.39 points (attributable to pathologic burden), and 
−0.16 points (attributable to interaction), which equals 1.27 points per year. In comparison, 
the independent effect of age alone on the rate of MMSE score change was 0.01 points per 
year (ie, MMSE score difference of 0.05 between the ages of 85 and 90 years).
The Figure shows how the rate of cognitive decline varies by delirium and pathologic status. 
The slowest decline was seen in persons with no history of delirium and least dementia 
pathologic burden. The fastest decline was seen in persons with a history of delirium and 
most dementia pathologic burden. Intermediate rates of decline were observed in individuals 
with delirium but least dementia pathologic burden and in those with no delirium history but 
most dementia pathologic burden.
Discussion
This is the first report, to our knowledge, that people with delirium and higher levels of 
pathologic processes of classic dementia have the greatest cognitive decline. Delirium in the 
presence of dementia-related neuropathologic processes was associated with cognitive 
decline beyond that expected for delirium or the neuropathologic process itself. This finding 
means that delirium may be independently associated with pathologic processes that drive 
cognitive decline, which are different from the pathologic processes of classic dementia. 
These findings suggest new possibilities regarding the pathologic correlates of cognitive 
impairment, positioning delirium, and/or its precipitants as a critically interrelated 
mechanism.
These results are in keeping with other studies identified in a systematic review33 reporting 
that delirium is associated with faster trajectories of cognitive decline.6,8,13 A previous 
report8 from the Vantaa 85+ study raised the possibility that the pathologic processes of 
classic dementia might not mediate the observed association between delirium and 
dementia, although the analysis was underpowered. In this study, the larger sample size and 
the more precise determination of cognitive change in the 6 years before death allow us to be 
more conclusive about the interrelated effect of delirium on clinicopathologic correlations in 
dementia. Experimental data from mouse models suggest that delirium may arise through 
the interaction between systemic or central nervous system inflammation and existing 
neurodegenerative pathologic processes,34 and acute exacerbation of inflammation clearly 
leads to neuronal death,14 synaptic changes,35 and accelerated decline.36 These changes 
occur independently of increased extracellular amyloid. However, we now need to know 
whether individuals with delirium superimposed on dementia have different patterns of 
inflammation, synaptic loss, axonal pathologic findings, and/or differential loss of key 
neuronal populations of the hippocampus and cortex and of cholinergic and noradrenergic 
projection areas.37

 Strengths and Limitations
This analysis has a number of strengths. It focuses on a major question arising from the 
prevalence of cognitive impairment and aging. In terms of study design, the 3 cohorts have 
high generalizability for the oldest-old populations, who are underrepresented in dementia 
research despite having the highest prevalence of dementia.38 This is also the first article, to 
our knowledge, to examine delirium and the pathologic correlates of cognitive decline at the 
end of life in the general population; the other analysis comes from a leading study in this 
area, the Religious Orders cohort study,30 which is, however, focused on specific 
populations. Modeling change in cognitive outcomes as continua rather than simply the 
presence or absence of dementia allows for an exploration of the effect of delirium across 
the whole spectrum of cognitive function (ie, from no baseline impairment through mild 
cognitive impairment to more severe dementia severity). The power to assess such effects as 
interactions between delirium and neuropathologic processes is unique.
A number of limitations should be taken into account. Delirium was retrospectively 
ascertained and by slightly different methods. In the Vantaa 85+ study, assessments for 
history of delirium occurred at each visit, using information from participants, informants, 
and medical records. Ascertainment of data in the CFAS and CC75C relied on diagnostic 
interviews at each study visit, but these data are likely to underestimate delirium in the 
intervening period. The diagnostic classification criteria also varied, although the different 
diagnostic schedules for delirium have good agreement with DSM-III-R.39 Despite these 
differences, the results appear to be consistent across the cohorts. The implication, either 
way, is that core symptoms in delirium—acute fluctuating change in attention in association 
with acute illness—represent an adverse state for subsequent cognitive trajectories regardless 
of the exact methods for operationalizing the syndrome. As with other prospective cohort 
data, the possibility remains that residual confounding contributes to these observed 
associations. Another consideration is that only a limited range of pathologic markers and 
comorbidities could be examined in this harmonized data set. Finally, although recent 
research based on neuroimaging and neuropathologic examination suggests that insults in 
earlier life can also be malignant,40–42 this hypothesis could not be examined within this 
study.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that delirium interacts with underlying pathologic processes of classic 
dementia and so represents a potential independent but interrelated pathologic pathway to 
chronic cognitive impairment and dementia. If delirium prevention could lead to consequent 
prevention of dementia,43,44 it will be essential to understand whether certain dimensions 
of the delirium syndrome might have a greater effect on cognitive trajectories than others. 
For example, duration, severity, and/or cause (eg, medications vs acute illness, surgery vs 
sepsis) may be differently important. The degree of preexisting multimorbidity or frailty 
may have a significant bearing. Animal studies modeling different causes and severities have 
some scope to elucidate some of these questions, but greater clarity on these issues must also 
come from careful prospective studies in representative populations. Nonetheless, our 
findings indicate that clinicians need to be alert to older people’ s cognitive changes during

 Key Points
Question What is the association among delirium, the pathologic processes of dementia, 
and cognitive decline in older persons?
Findings In this cohort of 987 autopsied brains from 3 population-based cohort studies, 
delirium and the pathologic processes of dementia were associated with cognitive 
decline; however, the combination of delirium and the pathologic processes of dementia 
interacted to give the fastest trajectory of cognitive decline.
Meaning During cognitive decline in the oldest-old, delirium appears to act 
independently and multiplicatively to the neuropathologic processes of classic dementia.

 Figure. Trajectory of Cognitive Decline in Relation to Delirium and Dementia Pathologic Burden 
at Autopsy
Trajectories of cognitive decline in individuals with the most (A) and least (B) dementia 
pathologic burden (based on Braak stage, cortical amyloid plaques, infarcts, and Lewy 
bodies) according to delirium status. Individuals with delirium and more dementia 
pathologic burden have the fastest decline (line A), whereas individuals with no delirium and 
little dementia pathologic burden have slowest decline (line D). For some individuals, 
cognitive decline is driven by dementia pathologic burden (no delirium, high pathologic 
burden) (line B). For other individuals, cognitive decline is associated with delirium 
(delirium, little pathologic burden) (line C), and this condition is distinct from, but 
contributory to, classic dementia pathologic burden. P < .001 for line A vs B, P < .001 for 
line C vs D, and P = .01 for line A vs C. MMSE indicates Mini-Mental State Examination.

aData are presented as number (percentage) of patients unless otherwise indicated.
bDelirium means evidence of delirium at any time compared with those with no history of delirium.
cP values for differences in means and medians (continuous measures) were obtained by 2-sample t test or Wilcoxon test, and proportions were 
tested using �2 tests.
dSix years is the chosen intercept for this model describing the final trajectory of cognitive decline.
ePathologic measures are dichotomized. Numbers given here are for the higher category (Braak stage ranges from 0 to 6); figures are those scoring 
4, 5, or 6. Neocortical amyloid plaques scored as none, mild, moderate, or severe; figures are those scoring moderate to severe. Vascular indicates 
the presence (yes/no) of infarcts in arteries larger than 10 mm, lacunar lesions, or hemorrhage. Lewy bodies scored as none, mild, moderate, or 
severe; figures are those scoring moderate to severe. Full details are given in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
fPathologic burden score refers to the number of pathologic measures in a higher category for an individual.
gAny moderate to severe pathologic findings were scored as a pathologic burden score of 1 or higher.

aThe term dementia pathologic burden refers to classic dementia pathologic variables known to contribute to cognitive impairment (ie, Braak stage, 
amyloid plaques, infarcts, and Lewy bodies). Observations refers to the total number of longitudinal outcomes in the model. Each of the 4 columns 
represents a model of cognitive trajectories adjusted by study source. The intercept and slope are given for each model. These variables indicate the 
estimated Mini-Mental State Examination scores 6 years before death (intercept) and the rate of decline per year (slope). The intercept from 6 years
