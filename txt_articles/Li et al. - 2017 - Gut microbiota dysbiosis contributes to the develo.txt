Abstract
Background: Recently, the potential role of gut microbiome in metabolic diseases has been revealed, especially in
cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide, yet whether
gut microbiota dysbiosis participates in the development of hypertension remains largely unknown. To investigate
this issue, we carried out comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses in a cohort of 41 healthy
controls, 56 subjects with pre-hypertension, 99 individuals with primary hypertension, and performed fecal
microbiota transplantation from patients to germ-free mice.
Results: Compared to the healthy controls, we found dramatically decreased microbial richness and diversity, Prevotella-
dominated gut enterotype, distinct metagenomic composition with reduced bacteria associated with healthy status and
overgrowth of bacteria such as Prevotella and Klebsiella, and disease-linked microbial function in both pre-hypertensive and
hypertensive populations. Unexpectedly, the microbiome characteristic in pre-hypertension group was quite similar to that
in hypertension. The metabolism changes of host with pre-hypertension or hypertension were identified to be closely
linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis. And a disease classifier based on microbiota and metabolites was constructed to
discriminate pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals from controls accurately. Furthermore, by fecal transplantation
from hypertensive human donors to germ-free mice, elevated blood pressure was observed to be transferrable through
microbiota, and the direct influence of gut microbiota on blood pressure of the host was demonstrated.
Conclusions: Overall, our results describe a novel causal role of aberrant gut microbiota in contributing to the
pathogenesis of hypertension. And the significance of early intervention for pre-hypertension was emphasized.

Background
In recent decades, the potential role of the gut mi-
crobiome in altering health status of the hosts has drawn
considerable attention. Emerging evidence suggests a
link between gut microbiome and various diseases,
including colorectal cancer, liver cirrhosis, arthritis, type
2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis [1–5]. A number of mi-
crobial biomarkers specific to these diseases have been
discovered, and fecal microbiome-targeted strategies are
recommended to be a powerful tool for early diagnosis
and treatment of different diseases.
More importantly, by fecal transfer experiment and
gut microbiota (GM) remodeling, intestinal microbiome
has been further indicated to conduce to the pathogen-
esis of multiple diseases such as obesity, depressive dis-
order, chronic ileal inflammation, liver diseases, and
atherosclerosis [6–12]. Specific mechanisms underlying
the causal function of GM have been revealed. For ex-
ample, the metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary
L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, was demonstrated to

 promote atherosclerosis and lead to cardiovascular disease
risk via producing trimethylamine and trimethylamine-N-
oxide [12]. Targeting gut microbial production of trimethy-
lamine specifically and non-lethal microbial inhibitors were
confirmed to relieve diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion
development [13]. Thus GM may serve as a potential thera-
peutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular and
metabolic diseases.
Hypertension (HTN) has become a global public health
concern and a major risk factor for cardiovascular, cere-
brovascular, and kidney diseases [14, 15]. It is believed that
the etiology of HTN depends on the complex interplay of
both genetic and environmental factors [16, 17], and the
precise cause of this morbidity has not been elucidated to
date. It has been suggested that the germ-free (GF) mice,
in which the intestinal bacteria is completely absent,
present relatively lower blood pressure (BP) when com-
pared to conventional mice [18]. And therefore we sus-
pected that GM might have the potential to regulate BP.
Most recently, many lines of seminal evidence, which
for the first time demonstrate that aberrant gut micro-
bial community are linked to BP changes of the host,
support this hypothesis. For example, disordered GM as
a result of decreased microbial richness, diversity, even-
ness, and increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was
reported in hypertensive animals and seven HTN pa-
tients, as sequenced by 16S ribosomal RNA [19]. In Dahl
rats, distinct metagenomic composition have been re-
vealed between salt-sensitive and salt-resistant strains,
and the GM of salt-sensitive rats was suggested to be in
a symbiotic relationship with the host [20]. In addition,
by rat models of HTN and meta-analyses in randomized
human clinical trials, investigators have revealed that ad-
ministration of probiotics can reduce BP [21, 22]. This
drove us to speculate that the alteration in GM by pro-
biotic use may lead to BP changes. Furthermore, it has
been proved that transplantation of cecal contents from
hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea rats on high-fat diet
into recipient rats on normal chow diet lead to higher
BP levels, and a major contributor to the gut dysbiosis
of obstructive sleep apnea-induced HTN is high-fat diet
[23]. These studies have emphasized a strong correlation
between gut dysbiosis and HTN, and further implied the
significance of GM in BP regulation, yet animal models
could not perfectly substitute human disease, and the
sample size of human participants for microbial analysis
was quite limited.
In consideration of the BP levels being classified into
optimal, pre-hypertension (pHTN), and HTN according
to the most recent clinical guidelines [24], it remains ob-
scure how exactly the composition of gut microbes and
the products of microbial fermentation change in human
patients with HTN, especially in pHTN populations. In
addition, decisive evidence is still needed to determine
whether gut dysbiosis is a consequence or an important
causal factor for the pathogenesis of HTN. Fecal trans-
plantation from human samples into GF mice is re-
quired to uncover the involvement of GM dysbiosis in
pathophysiology of HTN. Collectively, these key issues
are the major goal of the present study.
To address the questions above, we performed deep
metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 196 par-
ticipants of healthy control, pHTN, and HTN; took
metabolomic analyses of their metabolic profiles, further
constructed a disease classifier for pHTN and HTN
based on GM and metabolites; and demonstrated the
crucial role of disordered GM in triggering thigh BP by
human fecal microbiota transplantation into GF mice.
Results
GM diversity and enterotype in pHTN and HTN
To identify whether gut microbial changes are associated
with HTN, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequen-
cing of fecal samples from a cohort of 196 Chinese indi-
viduals. The cohort consisted of 41 healthy controls, 56
subjects with pHTN, and 99 patients with primary HTN.
All the participants were from a cohort study among
employees of the Kailuan Group Corporation. The Kai-
luan study is a prospective cohort study focusing on the
Kailuan community in Tangshan, a large modern city in
northern China. All the subjects in the hypertension
group were newly diagnosed hypertensive patients prior
to antihypertensive treatment. Patients suffering from
cancer, heart failure, renal failure, smoking, stroke, per-
ipheral artery disease, and chronic inflammatory disease
were all excluded. Drugs including statins, aspirin, insu-
lin, metformin, nifedipine, and metoprolol were not used
on the patients, and other drug consumption was not
compared because the sample size was quite small. Indi-
viduals were also excluded if they had received antibi-
otics or probiotics within the last 8 weeks. Other than
SBP and DBP, there was no significant difference in
other clinical parameters among groups, except for fast-
ing blood glucose level (FBG) (P = 0.026, C vs H;
Kruskal-Wallis test, Additional file 1: Table S1). Bacterial
DNA was extracted from stool samples, sequenced on
the Illumina platform, and a total of 1211 Gb 125-bp
paired-end reads were generated, with an average of
6.18 ± 1.43 (s.d.) million reads per sample (Additional file
2: Table S2). For each sample, a majority of high-quality
sequencing reads (83.74–97.24%) were de novo assem-
bled into long contigs or scaffolds, which were used for
gene prediction, taxonomic classification, and functional
annotation.
To characterize the bacterial richness, rarefaction ana-
lysis was performed by randomly sampling 100 times
with replacement and estimating the total number of
genes that could be identified from these samples. The

 curve in each group was near saturation, which sug-
gested the sequencing data were great enough with very
few new genes undetected. The rate of acquisition of
new genes in control samples rapidly outpaced new gene
acquisition in disease samples, suggesting lower levels of
gene richness in the pHTN and HTN groups (Fig. 1a).
The number of genes in both pHTN and HTN groups
were significantly decreased as compared to the controls
(P = 0.024, C vs P; P = 0.04, C vs H; Kruskal-Wallis test,
Fig. 1b). Shannon index based on the genera profile was
calculated to estimate the within-sample (α) diversity.
Consistently, the α diversity at the genus level was much
lower in pHTN and HTN groups (P = 0.023, C vs P; P =
0.016, C vs H; Kruskal-Wallis test, Fig. 1c). The reduced
richness of genes and genera in the GM of pHTN and
HTN groups is consistent with previous findings [19],
suggesting possible deficiency of healthy microflora in
hypertensive patients.
To explore the difference between the microbial commu-
nities at different stages of HTN, enterotypes were identi-
fied based on the abundance of genera using Partitioning
Around Medoid (PAM) clustering method. The optimal
number of enterotypes was two as indicated by Calinski-
Harabasz (CH) index (Additional file 3: Figure S1). Then

 the most enriched genus in enterotype 2 (P = 6.31e−31 and
P = 2.09e−15, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig. 1e).
Both contributors in the two enterotypes have been re-
ported in European and Chinese populations before [2, 3].
There was a higher percentage of pre-hypertensive and
hypertensive patients distributed in enterotype 1 (48.21%
for pHTN, and 45.45% for HTN), while more healthy con-
trols (73.17%) were found in enterotype 2 (P = 0.02, C vs P;
P = 0.03, C vs H; Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 1f). These findings
suggest that enterotype 2 may represent a GM community
structure associated with healthy control, while enterotype
1 may be associated with pHTN and HTN.
Considering the higher percentage of HTN patients in
enterotype 1, we clustered the genera in this enterotype
and further explored the microbial co-occurrence net-
work by Spearman’s correlation. There was a positively
interacted network constituted by 12 genera, which were
negatively correlated with Prevotella, the core genus in
this enterotype (Additional file 4: Figure S2a). All these
genera were decreased in enterotype 1 as compared with
enterotype 2 (Additional file 4: Figure S2b). Eight out of
them were directly linked to Prevotella, while the other
four, including Oscillibacter, Faecalibacterium, Butyrivibrio,
and Roseburia, were indirectly linked to Prevotella. These
findings highlighted the possibility of Prevotella as a key
genus associated with pHTN and HTN. The difference in
gut enterotype distribution revealed profound changes of
the intestinal microbiome structure in both pHTN and
HTN, implying the significance of gut microbes in the de-
velopment of HTN.
pHTN and HTN-associated genera in GM
Genes were aligned to the NR database and annotated
to taxonomic groups. The relative abundance of gut mi-
crobes was calculated by summing the abundance of
genes as listed in Additional file 2: Table S3–S4. P values
were tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test and corrected
for multiple testing with Benjamin & Hochberg method
as others previously did [4, 25]. It is worth mentioning
that 44 genera were differentially enriched in control,
pHTN, and HTN (P < 0.1, Wilcoxon rank sum test,
Fig. 2a and Additional file 2: Table S5). Fifteen of them
were further shown in Fig. 2b. Genera such as Prevotella
and Klebsiella were overrepresented in individuals with
pHTN or HTN (Fig. 2b). Prevotella, originated from
mouth and vagina, was abundant in the microbiome of
our study cohort. The pathogenesis of periodontal
diseases and rheumatoid arthritis are thought to be
attributed to Prevotella [3, 26]. A wide range of infec-
tious diseases are known to be attributed to Klebsiella
[27, 28]. Porphyromonas and Actinomyces, which were
also elevated in the HTN group, are morbific oral bac-
teria that cause infections and periodontal diseases [29].
By contrast, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Roseburia,
Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, and Butyrivibrio, which
were enriched in healthy controls, declined in pHTN
and HTN patients (Fig. 2b). Our observations were con-
sistent with the genera negatively correlated with Prevo-
tella in the network of enterotype 1 (Additional file 4:
Figure S2), and these bacteria are known to be essential
for healthy status. For example, reduced levels of Faeca-
libacterium and Roseburia in the intestines are as-
sociated with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis [30,
31]. Both bacteria are crucial for butyric acid production
[30, 32]. Moreover, Bifidobacterium is an important pro-
biotic necessary to intestinal microbial homeostasis, gut
barrier, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduction [33].
The divergence of GM composition in each sample
was assessed to explore the correlation of microbial
abundance with body mass index (BMI), age, and gender
(Additional file 5: Figure S3). Although the gender ratio
is discrepant among groups (Additional file 1: Table S1),
we found no remarkable regularity of bacterial abun-
dance based on BMI, age or gender.
To further validate the bacterial alterations in HTN,
an independent metagenomic analysis was performed
using the sequencing data generated from a previous
study of type 2 diabetes [2]. From a total of 174 non-
diabetic controls in the study, normotensive controls
with SBP ≤125 mmHg or DBP ≤80 mmHg were en-
rolled, and HTN were elected with the inclusion criteria
of SBP ≥150 mmHg or DBP ≥100 mmHg. The FBG
levels between normotensive controls and HTN were
similar. Finally, six subjects (HTNs, n = 3; normotensive
controls, n = 3) were included in our analysis (Additional
file 2: Table S6). As expected, the microbial diversity was
decreased in HTN (Additional file 6: Figure S4a), and
there were at least 20 genera showing consistent trends
with our findings, including decreased Butyrivibrio,
Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Enterococcus, Roseburia,
Blautia, Oscillbacter, and elevated Klebsiella, Prevotella,
and
Desulfovibrio
(Additional
file
6:
Figure
S4b,
Additional file 2: Table S7).
Collectively, these results supported our hypothesis that
bacteria associated with healthy status were reduced in pa-
tients with HTN. This phenomenon together with the
overgrowth of bacteria such as Prevotella and Klebsiella
may play important role in the pathology of HTN.
Co-abundance groups enriched in pHTN and HTN
Firstly, for each gene, an OR score was calculated ac-
cording to the abundance of each gene. Then, for the
comparative analysis between control and HTN samples,
the HTN-associated genes were classified as HTN-
enriched (OR >2) or HTN-depleted (OR <0.5) as previ-
ously described [34]. When calculating HTN-associated
ORs, samples of pHTN were excluded, and samples
Li et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:14 
Page 4 of 19
 labeled as HTN were excluded as well when calculating
pHTN-associated ORs. A total of 1,120,526 genes signifi-
cantly different in relative abundance across groups were
identified (Additional file 7: Table S8). Secondly, we
clustered genes by a rather high threshold (Spearman’s
correlation
coefficient
≥0.7)
according
to
previous
methods [4, 35]. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was
analyzed by R. The cluster groups with at least 50 genes
were defined as co-abundance groups (CAGs) [4], and
used for further analysis [35]. One thousand ninety-nine
distinct CAGs were obtained (Additional file 2: Table S9–
S11 and Additional file 8: Figure S5a). Seven hundred
fourteen CAGs were assigned to known bacterial genera
based on the tracer genes, with at least 80% of the genes
mapped to the reference genome at an identity higher
than 85% (Additional file 8: Figure S5b).
CAGs were further clustered by Spearman’s correlation
based on the abundance. Compared with the controls,
there were 316 CAGs and 372 CAGs enriched in pHTN
and HTN, respectively (Additional file 2: Table S12). In
the control group, Firmicutes and Roseburia were more
abundant (Fig. 3a, b). Most CAGs enriched in pre-
hypertensive samples were originated from Enterobacter, a
disease-causing bacteria linked to obesity. Klebsiella, caus-
ally implicated in various infections, was also overrepre-
sented in pre-hypertensive and hypertensive patients [27].
Additionally, most recent studies revealed that Fusobac-
terium was enriched in the fecal samples of patients with
liver cirrhosis, colorectal carcinoma, or ulcerative colitis
[4, 36, 37]. We also detected several clusters of CAGs
assigned to Fusobacterium enriched in pHTN and HTN
groups. About 200 CAGs were different in pHTN and
HTN. Most of them in pHTN were from Enterobacter
and Klebsiella, while Prevotella and Fusobacterium were
more abundant in HTN.
To further examine the relationship between clinical
indices and CAGs of GM, physiological parameters of

 (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were included
in a Spearman’s correlation analysis. We observed that
SBP and DBP could negatively influence the CAGs
enriched in the control group, such as Firmicutes and
Roseburia, and positively interacted with Prevotella and
Desulfovibrio, which were abundant in pHTN and HTN
(Additional file 9: Figure S6). Whereas, both TC and TG
were negatively correlated with Enterobacter, that was
enriched in pHTN and HTN groups. Altogether, these
results indicated that the bacterial communities in indi-
viduals with pHTN and HTN are similar, and the col-
lective effect of these bacteria may account for intestinal
dysbiosis in HTN.
Functional alteration in GM of pHTN and HTN
Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) and Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes (CAZy) [38]
database, we evaluated gut microbial functions across
groups in our study cohort. All the genes were aligned
to the KEGG database and CAZy database, and proteins
were assigned to the KEGG orthology and CAZy fam-
ilies (Additional file 2: Table S13–S15). Principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) based on KEGG orthology revealed
striking differences in microbial functions at the first
principal component (PC1) between controls and patients
(P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig. 4a). Nearly all the
KEGG modules and CAZy families displayed a similar dis-
crepancy in pHTN and HTN when compared with the
controls (Fig. 4b, c), illustrating the common functional
features in pHTN and HTN. Sixty-five (n = 65) KEGG
modules were differentially enriched among the three
groups (adjusted P value <0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test,
Additional file 2: Table S12). The thirty-nine (n = 39) mod-
ules decreased in pHTN and HTN groups were involved in
branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and transport, ke-
tone body biosynthesis, two-component regulatory system,

 and degradation of methionine and purine (Fig. 4b). These
metabolic functions are essential for the host and have been
observed in healthy populations [4, 5, 39, 40]. Although
previous studies have found that iron, phosphate, and
amino acid transport system, GABA biosynthesis, and
methanogenesis were enriched in the patients subjected to
colorectal cancer or liver cirrhosis [4, 39], these metabolic
functions were not enriched in our patient cohort. We ob-
served seventeen (n = 17) modules elevated in pHTN and
HTN, including LPS biosynthesis and export, phospholipid
transport, phosphotransferase system (PTS), biosynthesis of
phenylalanine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and secretion
system (Fig. 4b). The capacity to synthesize and export
LPS of the gut microbiome in patients with colorectal car-
cinoma has been suggested to represent an important
mechanism whereby inflammation contributes to tumor
progression [5, 41, 42]. PTS system, phosphatidylethanol-
amine biosynthesis, secretion system, and transport of
phospholipid, which were overrepresented in pHTN and
HTN, are also linked to diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and
rheumatoid arthritis [2, 4]. Additionally, the metagenome
of patients were enriched in genes associated with
cellulose-binding domains but depleted in host glycan-
utilizing enzymes (Fig. 4c). These gut microbial functions
in hypertensive patients are commonly associated with
other diseases. Although the functional annotation ana-
lyses are predictive, it indicated that impairment of GM
may evoke a disease-linked state through interference of
physiological metabolic functions.
Metabolic profiling of GM in pHTN and HTN
Considering the aberrant function profiles of gut microbes
in disease subjects, we wondered the microbe-host inter-
actions in HTN. As some end products of fermentation
by the GM could enter the bloodstream and exert import-
ant influences on the physiology of the hosts, we explored

 the host metabolic profiling in fasting serum of a subset of
124 subjects by high-throughput liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and examined the relation-
ship between GM and metabolites in the circulation. Thirty
healthy controls, 31 pHTNs, and 63 patients of HTN from
our previous cohort were randomly enrolled. The serum
samples were subjected to LC/MS analysis in both positive
ion mode (ES+) and negative ion mode (ES−). After elimin-
ating the impurity peaks and duplicate identifications, we
identified a total of 1290 chromatographic peaks in ES+
and 2289 variables in ES− for further analyses. To discrim-
inate the metabolic profiles across groups, we performed
clustering analyses based on partial least-squares discrimin-
ant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-squares
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The serum samples from
distinct groups were largely separated according to the
PLS-DA plots (Fig. 5a). The scatter plots in pHTN group
were closer to those in HTN, suggesting a similar metabolic
mode. Furthermore, individuals in either pHTN or HTN
groups were separated from the controls as further
evidenced by the OPLS-DA score scatter plots (Fig. 5b).
The compositional changes in patients involved 167
analytes that were significantly different between pHTN
and control, and 215 analytes altered in HTN (Fig. 5c).
There were 26 metabolites which were obviously differ-
ent in both pHTN and HTN groups as compared to the
control (Additional file 2: Table S16). Notably, these me-
tabolites exhibited statistically analogous profiles of alter-
ations in pHTN and HTN, which was consistent with our
findings based on gut microbiome (Fig. 5d). Endogenous
compounds whose levels significantly decreased in pHTN
and
HTN
include
phosphatidylserine
(PS),
3,4,5-tri-
methoxycinnamic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC),
S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine, and lysophosphatidylethano-
lamine (LysoPE). 3,4,5-Trimethoxycinnamic acid is cap-
able to protect against inflammatory diseases through
suppressing cell adhesion molecules in vascular endothe-
lial cells [43]. Also S-Carboxymethyl-L-cysteine exerts
anti-inflammatory properties [44]. These observed down-
regulations could promote the inflammatory environment
associated with HTN. On the other hand, endogenous
compounds whose levels significantly increased in pHTN
and HTN include metabolites such as Nα-acetyl-L-argin-
ine, stearic acid, phosphatidic acid (PA), and glucoside. El-
evated levels of Nα-acetyl-L-arginine and stearic acid have
been previously observed in uremia and spontaneously
hypertensive rats [45, 46]. These compounds may repre-
sent possible markers for the development of HTN and
might be derived from gut microflora or their fermented
products. To explore this idea, the relationship between
26 representative metabolites and the 44 most different
genera was examined by correlation analysis (Fig. 5e).
Control-enriched trichloroethanol glucuronide was posi-
tively correlated with Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia,
but negatively linked to Prevotella. Conversely, there
was a positive association between 9,10-dichloro-octa-
decanoic acid (stearic acid) and microflora including
Klebsiella, Prevotella, and Enterbacter, which were all
overrepresented in HTN. It was accordant that both
Bifidobacterium and Roseburia negatively interacted
with 9,10-dichloro-octadecanoic acid, which was hence
considered as an important GM-influenced metabolic
product in HTN. Thus the distinguished metabolic pro-
filing in HTN was closely connected to intestinal
microflora variation, although whether these metabolic
products were directly metabolized by the intestinal mi-
croorganisms remained to be explored.
Identification of pHTN and HTN basing on gut
microbiome
To illustrate the microbial and metabolic signature of
pHTN and HTN, and further exploit the potential of gut
microbiome and metabolites in HTN identification, ran-
dom forest disease classifier using explanatory variables
of CAGs, metabolites, and species abundances were per-
formed. Tenfold cross-validation was repeated for five
times and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves for classifying pHTN and HTN patients from
controls were developed.
We could detect HTN individuals accurately based on
the gut CAGs + metabolites, as indicated by the area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of up to 0.91,
and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.75–1 (Fig. 6a).
Similarly, comparing to the other variables, the variable
of CAGs + metabolites was more effective to classify
pHTN samples from controls, showing an AUC of 0.89,
and 95% CI of 0.65–1 (Fig. 6b). Thus, we conducted a
testing set consisted of 13 randomly chosen subjects
based on CAGs + metabolites. In this assessment ana-
lysis, both pHTN and HTN patients possess remarkable
features in gut microbiome and metabolites as compared
to the controls (Fig. 6c). However, we observed poor
performance on the test set when discriminating be-
tween pHTN and HTN by lower specificity and sensitiv-
ity (AUC, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21–0.93; Fig. 6c). This further
validated the similarity of pHTN and HTN in our previ-
ous findings. Among the most discriminatory CAGs to
distinguish pHTN or HTN from control, there were
some CAGs similarly enriched in both pHTN and HTN
subjects,
including
CAG-172
(Prevotella),
CAG-197
(Prevotella),
CAG-759
(Faecalibacterium),
CAG-765
(Faecalibacterium),
and
CAG-793
(Faecalibacterium)
(Fig. 6d). These CAG markers were the common micro-
bial characteristics of pHTN and HTN and contributed
a lot to the identification of pHTN and HTN.
We also investigated the utility of the classifier based on
microbial CAGs + species. Consistently, the AUC for iden-
tifying pHTN and HTN from the controls was 0.67 (95%

 CI, 0.39–0.95) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.53–1), respectively, and
the performance on pHTN and HTN individuals was not
as satisfactory (AUC, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.19–0.75; Additional
file 10: Figure S7a). For HTN classification, CAGs and spe-
cies taxonomic annotated to Prevotella, including Prevotella
sp. CAG:5226.CAG-377, Prevotella bivia, and CAG-184
were typically important (Additional file 10: Figure S7b).
Overall, the pHTN- and HTN-associated microbial and
metabolic features captured by the classifier offered further
evidence for dysbiotic gut microbiome and highlighted
great potential ability for detection of pHTN and HTN
populations by GM and metabolites.

 High BP is transferrable by fecal transplant
Previous studies have revealed that antibiotics and pro-
biotics are potential treatment modalities for BP in both
animal models and clinical trials [19, 21, 22, 47]. We
speculated that the alterations in GM under pro/anti-
biotic use may be associated with BP changes. There is
evidence that Dahl salt-sensitive rats transplanted with
salt-resistant rat microbiota have further exacerbated BP,
which indicate that the microbiota resident within the
cecum of the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, but not the salt-
resistant rat, are in a symbiotic relationship with the
host [20]. Thus the differences between Dahl salt-
sensitive rats and the salt-resistant rats are highlighted.
Investigators have also proved that transplantation of
cecal contents from hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea
rats on high-fat diet into the same obstructive sleep
apnea recipient rats on normal chow diet lead to higher
BP similar to the donors [23]. In this study, it seems that
a major contributor to the gut dysbiosis of HTN is a
high-fat
diet.
Therefore,
direct
studies
testing
if
microbial transplantation can transmit changes in BP
from hypertensive donors to recipients are still lacking.
To further demonstrate whether alterations of GM are a
causal factor for the progression of HTN in vivo, fecal
bacteria from hypertensive patients were transplanted to
GF mice in the present work.
The donors for microbiota transplantation consisted of
two patients of HTN and one normotensive control
(Additional file 11: Table S17). They were strictly se-
lected, and fresh fecal samples from donors were inocu-
lated to recipient mice as soon as possible. Male GF
mice at 8–10 weeks were divided into groups and orally
inoculated with stool samples two times at 1-day interval
(Fig. 7a). The fecal samples of recipient mice post-
transplantation were investigated by 16S V4 region
amplicon sequencing (Additional file 2: Table S18). The
sequences were de novo clustered at 97% sequence
identity and annotated to genera. From HTN patients,
128 genera were successfully colonized in the intestine
of HTN mice, and 110 genera were transferred to

index based on the genera profile showed reduced bac-
terial diversity in HTN mice (P = 0.048; t test, Fig. 7c).
As expected, PCoA at the genus level clustered HTN pa-
tients and mice colonized with hypertensive GM into
one group, but control and control mice into a separated
group (Fig. 7d). Moreover, at the genus level, Anaero-
truncus, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Rose-
buria, Blautia, and Bifidobasterium were confirmed to
be deficient, while Coprobacillus and Prevotella were
shown to be more abundant in HTN mice, which was in
agreement with our previous observations in the meta-
genomic analyses (Additional file 2: Table S19, Fig. 7e).
At 10 weeks post-transplantation, BP of recipient mice
in HTN and control group was measured by the tail-cuff
method. Notably, the HTN mice exhibited significantly
higher SBP, DBP, and mean blood pressure (MBP) as
compared to controls (P < 0.05), as well as elevated heart
rate (P = 0.11) (Fig. 7f). Early studies have shown that
when compared to conventional controls, GF rats pos-
sess significantly lower cardiac output, relatively dimin-
ished regional blood flow, lower level of systemic BP
response after blood loss, and hypotonic microvascula-
ture [48], which might lead to a low systolic BP in the
recipient mice. These findings provided novel and direct
evidence that GM could influence the BP of host

 directly. Therefore, changes in the GM might be the
mechanism underlying the effect of antibiotics and pro-
biotics on BP control. As the number of donors for
transplantation is limited, larger number of fecal trans-
plants from hypertensive, pre-hypertensive, and normo-
tensive control participants should be carried out in the
future to further establish the magnitude of BP changes.
Discussion
To date, there are limited studies indicating a direct as-
sociation between GM and HTN, especially in human
disease. Several important gaps in knowledge of gut and
BP remain unexplored, and critical issues should be ad-
dressed, such as the microbial profiles of HTN popula-
tions in clinical trials, the metabolites signature profiles,
the microbial biomarkers for early detection of HTN,
and fecal transplantation to make clear the causal rela-
tionship between gut dysbiosis and HTN. To make up
for these blanks, we applied a strategy based on metage-
nomic and metabolomic analyses, coupled with GM
transplantation. We sequenced the total bacteria DNA
of stool samples from a cohort of 196 Chinese individ-
uals and supplemented this analysis with an additional
validation cohort. All the individuals in the present study
are from a cohort study among employees of the Kailuan
Group Corporation. The Kailuan study is a prospective
cohort study focusing on the Kailuan community in
Tangshan, a large modern city in northern China. As the
subjects were from a relatively concentrated environ-
ment, the differences in the diets were relatively small.
All the subjects in the hypertension group were newly
diagnosed hypertensive patients prior to antihypertensive
treatment. Patients suffering from cancer, heart failure,
renal failure, smoking, stroke, peripheral artery disease,
and chronic inflammatory disease were all excluded.
Drugs including statins, aspirin, insulin, metformin, ni-
fedipine, and metoprolol were not used on the patients,
and other drug consumption was not compared because
the sample size was quite small. Hence, it is not likely
that the medication use directly influenced the gut meta-
genome and metabolites, as there was no significant dif-
ference in the drugs consumed by these subjects. Our
results demonstrate that decreased diversity, altered
enterotype distribution, and variation in bacteria popula-
tions were associated with both pHTN and HTN. The
bacterial metabolic functions and GM-related metabo-
lites in pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults were
closely linked to inflammatory state. Particularly, both
pHTN and HTN individuals could be accurately distin-
guished from the controls by variables of CAGs and
metabolites. And most importantly, the direct impact of GM
composition on regulating BP was evaluated using an in vivo
model of GF mice colonized with human intestinal micro-
biota. Bacteria such as Prevotella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and
Fusobacterium are potential candidates for further bacteria
transfer experiments to explore the precise mechanisms
underlying the effect of GM in BP regulation. Our work
provides the first direct evidence that highlights the piv-
otal role of dysbiotic gut microbiome as an important
pathogenic factor for the high BP of the host. Thus GM
modulation should be considered during antihypertensive
treatment.
Researchers previously suggested that the intestinal
bacterium Prevotella copri thrives in a pro-inflammatory
environment of rheumatoid arthritis [3, 49]. The super-
oxide reductase and phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate
reductase encoded by Prevotella copri may favor the de-
velopment of inflammation. In their further demonstra-
tion, colonization with Prevotella copri enhances body
weight loss and exacerbates epithelial inflammation in
colitis mouse model [3]. Interestingly, as shown by our
data,
the
enterotype
dominated
by
Prevotella
was
enriched with pHTN and HTN populations. Moreover,
Prevotella
was
overrepresented
in
individuals
with
pHTN and HTN. And stearic acid, an important metab-
olite in HTN, was positively linked to Prevotella. Fur-
thermore, CAGs and species taxonomic annotated to
Prevotella were the common microbial characteristics of
pHTN and HTN, and contributed a lot to classification
of HTN. Thus Prevotella may play an essential role in
HTN, probably by triggering the inflammatory response.
Our findings have consolidated the potential of Prevo-
tella in the pathogenesis of diseases, and call for further
exploring whether Prevotella is a causal conducer to in-
flammation and HTN.
Concomitant with the alteration of gut microbial com-
position, we observed a dysbiosis in bacterial gene func-
tions. The metagenome of HTN patients were depleted
in genes associated with biosynthesis and transport of
amino acid, such as lysine, histidine, leucine, and serine,
which are essential for human health. Functional annota-
tion also indicated a decline of modules for fatty acid
utilization and saccharide transport, suggesting an im-
paired capacity of energy production. In agreement with
previous studies showing a dearth of microbial functions
for purine metabolism in arthritis [3], a significant de-
crease in purine-metabolizing enzymes was identified to
be related to HTN. Indeed, these metabolic functions
are quite necessary for healthy populations [3–5, 39, 40].
In contrast, the enrichment of the modules for LPS bio-
synthesis and export in patients hints at a potential role
of GM in causing low-grade inflammation. Inflammation
due to immune response triggered by LPS is the cardinal
feature of the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria,
such as Prevotella and Klebsiella [50, 51], and has been
identified as an important contributor to the pathogen-
esis of HTN. Our findings raise the possibility that the
low-grade inflammation and increase of gram-negative
Li et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:14 
Page 12 of 19
 bacteria, especially Prevotella and Klebsiella, are likely
responsible for HTN pathology. Thus, our analysis of
bacterial gene functions indicates that functional dysbio-
sis may contribute to the susceptibility to HTN, and
overproduction of LPS by gut bacteria seems to be dir-
ectly linked to HTN development, whereas amino acid
biosynthesis, fatty acid utilization, and purine metabol-
ism by bacteria might have a role in HTN prevention.
Actually, in GF mice, the tail-cuff method has been
used for assessment of BP in a recent report, suggesting
the methodology is acceptable [52]. In our study, the
tail-cuff measurement was performed as the others did
previously, and indicated a tendency for higher BP in re-
cipient mice inoculated with stool samples from hyper-
tensive donors as compared to controls. As such results
were not obtained by fecal microbiota transplantation in
conventionally raised mice, we speculate that the im-
mune inflammatory system might play a crucial role in
the pathogenesis of HTN. Further mechanism research
to make clear whether gut bacterial metabolites show a
contribution to the immune inflammatory system during
the development of HTN is being performed.
In HTN studies, most work focused on patients with a
clinical definition of HTN, who display a SBP higher
than 140 mmHg or DBP ≥90 mmHg. However, po-
pulation studies suggest that there is an intermediate
stage of BP between control and HTN defined as pHTN,
which
should
not
be
ignored.
In
our
study,
we
considered subjects with pHTN as an independent
group. Surprisingly, the bacterial diversity, enterotype,
composition, and metabolic functions, as well as classi-
fied characteristics in pHTN highly coincided with those
in HTN. As shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, there was a little
difference in the structure of gut microbiome between
pHTN and HTN, indicating that pHTN is not simply a
transition stage between normotensive and hypertensive
status upon BP levels but rather a state in which gut
dysbiosis has already occurred. Moreover, our findings
revealed indiscriminate metabolic profilings between
pHTN and HTN, consistent with a previous report that
the serum spectral profiles of the hosts were similar at a
stage of SBP ≥130 mmHg and at SBP ≥150 mmHg [53].
The close correlation of metabolic products and GM
further strengthened and highlighted the importance of
pHTN. Therefore, early treatment of pHTN has strong
clinical value. In agreement with our notion, high BP has
become one of the three leading risk factors for death
according to the Global Burden of Disease Study [54].
Moreover, our findings fully support the updated conclu-
sion by the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial
(SPRINT) research group, that controlling one’s SBP to
an optimal level lower than 120 mmHg rather than a
pHTN level below 140 mmHg leads to significantly de-
creased occurrence of cardiovascular events and death
[55]. Thus, more attention should be given to the previ-
ously neglected populations in pHTN, and early inter-
vention for pHTN is strongly appealed.
Conclusions
Taken together, we have described clearly the disordered
profiles of GM and microbial products in human pa-
tients with pHTN and HTN, established the relationship
between gut dysbiosis and HTN, and provided important
evidence for the novel role of GM dysbiosis as a key fac-
tor for BP changes. Our findings point towards a new
strategy aimed at preventing the development of HTN
and reducing cardiovascular risks through restoring the
homeostasis of GM, by improving diet and lifestyle or
early intervening with drugs or probiotics.
Methods
Study cohort and patient characteristics
All the individuals in the present study were from a co-
hort study among employees of the Kailuan Group Cor-
poration. The Kailuan study is a prospective cohort
study focusing on the Kailuan community in Tangshan,
a large modern city in northern China, where 11 hospi-
tals are responsible for the health care of the commu-
nity, all of which participated in conducting physical
examinations. All the subjects in the current work were
strictly enrolled and none of them was under antihyper-
tensive treatment. The participants were classified based
on the Internal Guidelines for HTN as described in
Additional file 1: Table S1. It was composed of 41
healthy controls (SBP ≤125 mmHg, or DBP ≤80 mmHg),
56 pHTNs (125 mmHg < SBP ≤ 139 mmHg, or 80 mmHg
< DBP ≤ 89 mmHg), 99 patients of HTN (140 mmHg ≤
SBP, or 90 mmHg ≤ DBP). BP was measured in a sitting
position by nurses or physicians. Three readings were re-
corded at 5-min intervals with a random-zero mercury
column sphygmomanometer, and the average was taken
as the final measurement.
All clinical information was collected according to
standard procedures. Patients suffering from cancer,
heart failure, renal failure, smoking, stroke, and periph-
eral artery disease were excluded, and none of the pa-
tients was under antihypertensive treatment. Healthy
volunteers had no history of diabetes mellitus or hyper-
cholesterolemia. Individuals were also excluded if they
had received antibiotics or probiotics within the last
8 weeks. The study was approved by local ethics com-
mittees (Kailuan General Hospital, Beijing Chaoyang
Hospital, and Beijing Fuwai Hospital) and informed con-
sent was obtained from all subjects.
Stool sample collection and DNA extraction
Stool samples freshly collected from each participant
were immediately frozen at −20 °C and transported to
Li et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:14 
Page 13 of 19
 the laboratory with ice pack. Bacterial DNA was ex-
tracted at Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd
using TIANGEN kit according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Metagenomic sequencing and gene catalogue
construction
All samples were paired-end sequenced on the Illumina
platform (insert size 300 bp, read length 125 bp) at the
Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. After
quality control, the reads aligned to the human genome
(alignment with SOAP2 [56], Version 2.21, parameters:
-s 135, -l 30, -v 7,-m 200,-x 400) were removed. The
remaining high-quality reads were used for further
analysis.
The assembly of reads was executed using SOAP
denovo (Version 2.04, parameters: -d 1 -M 3 -R -u -F)
[57]. For each sample, we used a series of k-mer values
(from 49 to 87) and chose the optimal one with the lon-
gest N50 value for the remaining scaffolds [4]. We
mapped the clean data against scaffolds using SOAP2
(Version 2.21, parameters: -m 200 -x 400 -s 119). Un-
used reads from each sample were assembled using the
same parameters. Genes (minimum length of 100 nucle-
otides) were predicted on scaftigs (i.e., continuous se-
quences within scaffolds) longer than 500 bp using
MetaGeneMark (prokaryotic GeneMark.hmm version
2.10). Then, a non-redundant gene catalogue was con-
structed with CD-HIT (version 4.5.8, parameters: -G 0
-aS 0.9 -g 1 -d 0 -c 0.95) [58] using a sequence identity
cut-off of 0.95, with a minimum coverage cut-off of 0.9
for the shorter sequences.
To determine the abundance of genes, reads were rea-
ligned to the gene catalogue with SOAP2 using parame-
ters: -m 200 -x 400 -s 119. Only genes with ≥2 mapped
reads were deemed to be present in a sample [59]. The
abundance of genes was calculated by counting the
number of reads and normalizing by gene length.
α diversity and rarefaction curve
To estimate the genera richness of the sample, we calcu-
lated the within-sample (α) diversity using Shannon
index based on the genera profiles. A high α diversity in-
dicates a high richness of genera within the sample.
Rarefaction analysis was performed to assess the gene
richness in the controls, pHTN, and HTN. For a given
number of samples, we performed random sampling 100
times in the cohort with replacement and estimated the
total number of genes that could be identified from
these samples by R (Version 2.15.3, vegan package).
Microbial community types (enterotypes)
The community types of each sample were analyzed by
the PAM method using relative abundance of genera.
The optimal number of clusters was estimated using the
CH index, as previously described [60]. Only genera with
an average relative abundance ≥10−4 and existed in at
least six samples were considered in the analysis. Ac-
cording to Spearman’s correlation between genera abun-
dances, the genera in enterotype 1 were clustered, and
the co-occurrence network of them was visualized by
Cytoscape (Version 3.2.1).
Taxonomic annotation and abundance profiling
To assess the taxonomic assignment, genes were aligned
to
the
integrated
NR
database
using
DIAMOND
(Version 0.7.9.58, default parameter except that -k 50
-sensitive -e 0.00001) [61]. As previously described [59],
for each gene, the significant matches, which were de-
fined by e-values ≤10 × e-value of the top hit, and these
retained matches were used to distinguish taxonomic
groups. The taxonomical level of each gene was deter-
mined by the lowest common ancestor-based algorithm
and implemented in MEGAN [62]. The abundance of a
taxonomic group was calculated by summing the abun-
dance of genes annotated to a feature.
Metagenomic analysis in the verification phase
All phenotype information of participants were listed in
the supplementary tables of Qin J et. al [2]. Subjects with
diabetes were excluded. Three HTN patients with SBP
≥150 mmHg or DBP ≥100 mmHg were enrolled, and
three normotensive controls with SBP ≤125 mmHg and
DBP ≤80 mmHg were included for the analysis.
Co-abundance gene groups
To identify the marker genes associated with pHTN and
HTN, the abundance of each gene across groups was
compared according to Greenblum S et al. [34]. As pre-
viously described [35], these marker genes were clus-
tered into groups based on their abundance variation
across groups. Clusters with more than 50 genes were
defined as co-abundance gene groups (CAGs), and used
for further analysis. CAG abundance profiles were calcu-
lated by the average gene depth signal and weighted by
gene length.
Taxonomic assignment of the CAGs was performed
according to the taxonomy of tracer genes, as previously
described [2]. Briefly, assignment to species requires 90%
of the genes in a CAG to align with the species’ genome
with 95% identity and 70% overlap of query. Assigning
CAG to a genus requires 80% of its genes to align to the
genome with 85% identity in both DNA and protein
sequences.
Co-occurrence network of CAGs
The enriched CAGs were identified according to
Greenblum
S
et
al..
These CAGs
were
clustered
Li et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:14 
Page 14 of 19
 according to Spearman’s correlation. The co-occurrence
network was visualized using Cytoscape (Version 3.2.1).
The enriched CAGs/genes were identified according to
Greenblum S et al. [34]. Briefly, for each CAG, an OR
score was calculated according to the abundance in the
set of compared samples. Then, for the comparative
analysis between control and HTN samples, the HTN-
associated CAGs were classified as HTN-enriched (OR
>2) or HTN-depleted (OR <0.5). When calculating HTN-
associated ORs, samples of pHTN were excluded from the
analysis, and when calculating pHTN-associated ORs,
samples labeled as HTN were excluded.
Association between CAGs and clinical indices
Based on the clinical indices and enriched CAG profiles,
we calculated Spearman’s correlation in all samples. The
P values were corrected for multiple testing with Holm
method by R (Version 2.15.3, psychpackage). Only 162
samples were considered in the analysis because of the
clinical data missing in 34 samples.
Functional annotation
All genes in our catalogue were aligned to the KEGG
database (Release 73.1, with animal and plant genes re-
moved) and CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org/) using
DIAMOND (Version 0.7.9.58, default parameter except
that -k 50 –sensitive -e 0.00001). Each protein was
assigned to the KEGG orthology and CAZy families by
the highest scoring annotated hits containing at least
one HSP scoring over 60 bits [63]. The abundance of
KEGG orthology/module was calculated by summing
the abundance of genes annotated to the same feature.
Metabonomics analysis based on LC/MS
One-hundred twenty-four (n = 124) individuals from our
study cohort were subjected to metabonomics analysis
based on the LC/MS method. This cohort was com-
posed of 30 healthy controls, 31 pHTNs, and 63 patients
of HTN. The whole blood samples were collected and
separated into serum by centrifugation. Each serum
samples at 100 μL were mixed with 400 μL methanol,
and the mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
15 min at 4 °C. For LC/MS analysis, 200 μL of the super-
natant was harvested.
The serum metabolic profiles were performed on a
Thermo Fisher Ultimate 3000 LC system. For chromato-
graphic separation, C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm × 1.9 μm)
reversed-phase column (Thermo Scientific, USA) pre-
heated at 40 °C was used. A prepared serum sample of
4 μL was injected and maintained at 4 °C for analysis.
The gradient conditions for metabolite elution were at
5% B for 0–1 min, 5–40% B for 1–2 min of linear gradi-
ent, 40–80% B for 2–11 min of linear gradient, and 95%
B for 11–15 min. The mobile phase for positive ion
mode (ES+) and negative ion mode (ES−) was composed
of water with 0.1% formic acid as solvent A, and aceto-
nitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B, and the flow
rate was at 300 μL/min.
For mass spectrometric assay, Orbitrap Elite mass spec-
trometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with ESI
source was used to analyze the metabolite ions. The spray
voltage was set to 3.8 kV in ES+ and 3.2 kV in ES−, the
flow rate of sheath gas, aux gas, and sweep gas was 45, 15,
and 1 arb, respectively. The ion source temperature was
300 °C, and the capillary temperature was 350 °C. Masses
ranging from 50 to 1000 ion mass (m/z) were acquired,
and the resolving power was set to 60,000.
The raw ESI data of LC/MS was converted into m/z
format and analyzed for non-linear retention time (RT)
alignment,
peak
detection,
and
filtration.
Maximal
spectrum of continuous wavelet transform was used to
correct baseline and detect peak positions. Impurity
peaks and duplicate identifications were eliminated.
Compounds significantly different between groups were
obtained at a variable influence on projection (VIP) >1.5,
and P value of t test statistics <0.05 based on the peak
intensities. The m/z values of these compounds were
used to identify the metabolites corresponding to the
featured peak in the Metlin database.
From the metabolite profile and 44 top differential
genera abundance profile, Spearman’s correlation was
performed to eliminate multi-collinearity and only one
factor will be randomly selected from high correlated
clusters (|r| ≥ 0.9) for further analysis. A stepwise regres-
sion of linear models was used for modeling the rela-
tionship between metabolites and related genera, from
the fitting value of individual metabolites, and Spear-
man’s correlation between metabolic and associated gen-
era was calculated and scaled by coefficients of each
respective linear model.
Animal experiments
GF C57BL/6L mice were obtained from Shanghai Insti-
tutes for Biological Sciences (SLAC Inc., Shanghai,
China) and housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle in the
gnotobiotic facilities. All mice were fed with sterile food
and water ad libitum, and bacterial contamination was
monitored by periodic examination of stools. For micro-
biota transplantation, the fresh fecal samples were col-
lected from donors (Additional file 11: Table S17),
resuspended with sterile saline, and centrifuged for
supernatant. Male GF mice aged 8–10 weeks were ran-
domly distributed into two groups and orally inoculated
(200 μL for each mouse) twice at 1-day interval with
prepared fecal contents from control or patients. Recipi-
ent mice transferred with microbiota were kept in differ-
ent Trexler-type flexible film isolators, fed with sterile
food and water, and bacterial contamination was strictly

 controlled. The gut microbial profiles of recipient mice
were analyzed by 16S sequencing after 7 days. We chose
a time point of 10 weeks post-transplantation for BP
measurement. An assessment of BP was performed
within 60 min after exporting the mice out of their
gnotobiotic facilities, and we could not ensure preven-
tion from bacterial contamination after the measure-
ment; the BP at other time points during 10 weeks was
not further examined. The BP was measured by the tail-
cuff method and the BP-98A system (Softron, Tokyo,
Japan), which was noninvasive and did not require sur-
gery, since using direct invasive methods such as radio-
telemetry techniques will immediately expose the mice
to a non-sterile condition, which might impact the re-
sults. To acclimatize the mice undergoing the measure-
ment procedures and improve measurement reliability, a
heat-sterilized dark cover was transported into the
germ-free mice isolator, where it was sterilized by spray-
ing with a chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant in the iso-
lator port. Before BP measurement, we have trained the
mice by placing them in the dark cover in their sterile
flexible film isolators without exporting them out at the
same time for 14 days. To minimize contamination, the
measurement was performed with UV-sterilized instru-
ments under a sterile hood within 60 min after export-
ing the mice out of their sterile environment. All animal
care and experiments were performed in accordance
with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of SLAC Inc.
16S ribosomal RNA sequencing
16S rRNA community profiles were characterized using
Illumina HiSeq sequencing of the V4 region (insert size
300 bp, read length 250 bp). Sequences were de novo
clustered at 97% sequence identity and chimeras were
removed using UPARSE [64]. For each representative se-
quence, the GreenGene Database was used to annotate
taxonomic information [65].
Statistical analysis
The Shannon index at the genera level was calculated
with QIIME (Version 1.7.0). PCA was analyzed using
the FactoMineR package in R software (Version 2.15.3).
PCoA was performed and displayed by ade4 package,
cluster packages, fpc packages, and clusterSim package
in R software (Version 2.15.3). PLS-DA was performed
using SIMCA-P software to cluster the sample plots
across groups.
Differential abundance of genes, genera, and KO mod-
ules was tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test, and P values
were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamin &
Hochberg method. Only genera with an average relative
abundance ≥10−4 and existed in at least six subjects were
considered in the analyses. Correlations between enriched
CAGs and clinical indices were tested with Spearman’s
correlation and visualized by Cytoscape (Version 3.2.1).
Using the profiles of species, CAGs, and metabolites,
the samples were randomly divided into training set and
test set. A random forest classifier was trained on 80% of
the data and tested on the remaining 20% of our data
using the random forest package in R. In order to evalu-
ate the performance of the predictive model and get
more precise curves, we used a 10-fold cross-validation
within the training set. The cross-validational error
curves (average of 10 test sets each) from five trials of
the 10-fold cross-validation were averaged. Variable
importance by mean decrease in accuracy was calculated
for the random forest models using the full set of
features. The number of variables was 1000 at the lowest
cross-validational error. Thus, the predictive model was
constructed using the 1000 most important variables,
which were further applied for ROC analysis. The
performance of the smaller models were measured as
AUC when applied to the test set, and the confidence in-
tervals for ROC curves were calculated using the pROC
R package.
