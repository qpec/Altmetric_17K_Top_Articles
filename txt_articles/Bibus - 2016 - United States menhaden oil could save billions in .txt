Summary
The United States menhaden oil annual production is sufficient to supply all of the recommended long chain Omega-3s for Americans over 55
with coronary heart disease (CHD) and pregnant and lactating women. According to a recent study, the utilization of preventable intake
levels could potentially save up to $1.7 billion annually in hospital costs alone. In addition, the remaining oil could be used to support a
culture of enough Atlantic salmon to provide every pregnant and lactating woman in the U.S. with 8-12 ounces of fish per week, as recom-
mended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), throughout the duration of pregnancy and lactation. Based on the FDA’s quantitative
assessment, this may result in a net increase of IQ by 5.5 points in children and improve their early age verbal development.
The total United States medical expenditures are the highest in the
world and have reached $ 2.8 trillion in 2012. Medical expenditures
as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have risen from
9.5% in 1985 to 17.2% in 2012, which is higher than in any other
country. By 2039, it is expected to increase to 22%.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mor-
tality in the U.S., causing more than 596,000 deaths annually. It
costs the U.S. over $ 444 billion each year in total direct and indi-
rect costs. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a subset of CVD, kill-
ing over 375,000 people in the U.S. each year. Further, it costs the
U.S. almost $ 109 billion each year in health care services, medica-
tions, and lost productivity. By 2030, the total costs are projected
to increase to over one trillion U.S. dollars. However, this projec-
tion does not have to materialize, because fortunately, CVD is a
partially preventable condition. The risk can be mitigated through
healthy lifestyle choices and proper diet, including intake of ade-
quate levels of Long-Chain (LC) Omega-3 fatty acids.
Published cost benefit analyses demonstrated that the utilization
of LC Omega-3 fatty acids at preventable intake levels among the
target population may reduce the relative risk of a CHD event and
result in potential net health savings [1, 2]. Consistent with these
reports, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that
people with documented CHD consume 1,000 mg of eicosapentae-
noic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids per day, which is
more than the typical Western diet provides.
A recent study conducted by the global consulting firm, Frost
and Sullivan, estimated that nearly $ 1.7 billion in hospital costs
could be avoided if all Americans over 55 with CHD consume the
AHA-recommended dose of LC Omega-3s [3]. Using the Frost
and Sullivan’s model, the U.S. annual menhaden oil production
(74,700 MT/yr) could be used to supply all CHD patients in the
U.S. with the recommended dosage of LC Omega-3s (Table 1 and
Figure 1), which could help realize these health cost savings.
These potential net health savings are probably only the tip of
the iceberg of what could be attained if all of U.S. menhaden oil
was used to provide the AHA-recommended amount of LC Ome-
ga-3s to Americans over 55 with CHD. The model does not ac-
count for other CHD-related expenditures, like cost of lost produc-
tivity, medications, and most importantly, value of lives saved. Ad-
ditionally, it does not capture the savings derived from positive
health effects of LC Omega-3s on other subsets of CVD, which fre-
quently accompany CHD in adults over age 55. For example, it is
well-documented that LC Omega-3s may have blood pressure ben-
efits. The costs associated with hypertension in the U.S. exceed
$ 93.5 billion a year [4]. Finally, the model does not account for
the healthcare savings that could result from the impact of fish oil
on non-CVD-related conditions, like cognitive impairment, which
affects approximately 16 million people in the U.S.
Besides cardiovascular health, LC Omega-3s support neural de-
velopment and function. DHA is a predominant structural fatty acid
in the central nervous system and retina. It cannot be efficiently
synthesized by humans from shorter-chain Omega-3s and is best
obtained through the diet, especially during rapid brain growth and
fetal neural development.
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a
quantitative assessment of the impact of fish consumption on fetal
neurodevelopment [15]. The agency reported that adequate fish
consumption by mothers during pregnancy can result in a net in-
crease of IQ by 5.5 points in children and improve their early age
verbal development [15]. It is recommended that women who are
pregnant, might become pregnant, or are breastfeeding, consume 8
to 12 ounces of fish per week [15].
In addition to the U.S. yearly menhaden oil production that could
be supplied directly to people with CHD, on average there would
be 40,401 MT of oil left for other uses. As salmon feeds currently
contain up to 9% fish oil [5], and the current feed conversion ratio
is 1.17 [5], the leftover oil could be used to support the production
of 383,672 MT of farmed salmon. After the adjustment for 68%
edible yield [5], this equates to 260,897 MT of edible salmon por-
tions. This quantity is sufficient to supply every pregnant and lac-
tating woman in the U.S. with two to three servings of oily fish per
week, as recommended by the FDA [6]. The remaining salmon can

 Table 1. The United States produces enough menhaden oil to supply all Americans over 55 with CHD with recommended quantities of EPA and DHA.
Additionally, the remaining oil could be used to help supply all pregnant and lactating women in the U.S. with recommended weekly servings of farm-
raised salmon. Furthermore, there would be enough oil left to supply 8 to 12 ounces of salmon per week to 5,962,677 to 13,336,650 individuals that
would benefit from LC Omega-3 consumption.

 be supplied to 5,962,677 to 13,336,650 additional consumers (e.g.
14,747,946 – 8,785,269 = 5,962,677; 22,121,919 – 8,785,269 =
13,336,650) that would benefit from the increased LC Omega-3
consumption.
This is a very conservative estimate for two reasons. First, we
assume that all women who become pregnant in a given year are
consuming the recommended amount of fish regardless of the out-
come of the pregnancy (only 65% of the pregnancies result in live
birth) [7]. Second, we assume that all infants are breastfed for a
whole year, as recommended by the American Academy of Pedia-
trics. According to FDA, the adequate intake of LC Omega-3 fatty
acids may result in a net increase of IQ of up to 5.5 points in chil-
dren by the time they reach the age of eight [6]. Theoretically, over
time, this could increase the average IQ of the U.S., moving it high-
er in international rankings from its current place at 19th [8, 9].
Although the remaining 32% of farm-raised salmon weight is
considered non-edible in most of the Western world, the bypro-
ducts are typically processed into the feed ingredients for other fish
and shrimp species, food animals, laboratory and zoo animals, pets,
and humans through salmon oil supplements. As to aquaculture
and salmon farming in particular, providing the LC Omega-3s to
humans by including the oil from small pelagic species in farmed
fish diets is a far more efficient method of harnessing the ocean’s
healthy nutrients than harvesting larger food fish [10]. This is be-
cause, in nature, one unit of salmon biomass increase would require
at least ten units of small pelagic prey fish [10]. However, as de-
monstrated by Bibus, only less than 0.8 units of menhaden was re-
quired in 2013 to grow one unit of farmed salmon because marine
ingredients today represent only a small fraction of the feed by
weight [11]. Further, as the inclusion rates of oil in salmon feed
have declined, a simple calculation using Bibus’ approach shows
that in 2014 it would take only 0.7 units of menhaden to produce
one unit of salmon. Thus, the leftover LC Omega-3s continue to
serve its role in human and animal nutrition, as market forces do
not allow these nutrients to be wasted.
Conclusions
Although not fully quantifiable at this time, the potential impact of
our fish oil production on the U.S. medical expenditures is astound-
ing. The magnitude of the actual current impact on healthcare costs
across various health conditions may already be close to that of the
theoretical, as almost 75% of U.S.-produced menhaden oil is cur-
rently used in production of farmed salmon and supplements,
which are the means of transferring marine LC Omega-3s through
the food chain to humans. However, the U.S. menhaden oil pro-
duction should not be evaluated merely on its ability to reduce
healthcare costs. Instead, it should be valued based on a combina-
tion of cost savings and contribution to human well-being, includ-
ing healthy life expectancy and quality of life.
