The trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for host immune recognition and
neutralization. Despite advances in trimer design, the roots of Env trimer metastability remain
elusive. Here we investigate the contribution of two Env regions to metastability. First, we
computationally redesign a largely disordered bend in heptad region 1 (HR1) of SOSIP trimers
that connects the long, central HR1 helix to the fusion peptide, substantially improving the
yield of soluble, well-folded trimers. Structural and antigenic analyses of two distinct HR1
redesigns confirm that redesigned Env closely mimics the native, prefusion trimer with a more
stable gp41. Next, we replace the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with various linkers
in the context of an HR1 redesign. Electron microscopy reveals a potential fusion intermediate
state for uncleaved trimers containing short but not long linkers. Together, these results
outline a general approach for stabilization of Env trimers from diverse HIV-1 strains.

 A
major
goal
of
vaccine
development
for
human
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is to induce
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) by vaccination1.
All bNAbs identified thus far target the envelope glycoprotein
(Env) trimer on the surface of HIV-1 virions2. The precursor Env
protein, gp160, is trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to
the Golgi and cleaved by cellular proteases of the furin family into
its mature form3. The cleaved Env trimer engages host receptors
to mediate viral entry and is the primary target of protective
humoral immune responses. The functional Env is a trimer of
heterodimers, each containing a receptor-binding protein, gp120,
and a transmembrane fusion protein, gp41, which are held
together by non-covalent interactions4. The mature Env is also
metastable, as it is poised to undergo dramatic and irreversible
conformational changes upon receptor and co-receptor binding
to
mediate
membrane
fusion.
This
inherent
metastability
facilitates immune evasion by inducing gp120 shedding5 and
generating a diverse assortment of native, more open and non-
native Env conformations6.
Various strategies have been proposed to overcome Env
metastability and to create stable, homogeneous gp140 trimers
for structural and vaccine studies. One approach involved
deletion of the cleavage site between gp120 and the gp41
ectodomain (gp41ECTO), and addition of trimerization motifs to
the C terminus of gp41ECTO to stabilize the trimer7–9. Another
approach covalently linked the cleaved gp120 and gp41ECTO
domains with an engineered disulfide bond (termed SOS),
destabilized the gp41 postfusion conformation through addition
of an I559P mutation (termed IP) and improved trimer solubility
by truncating the hydrophobic membrane-proximal external
region at residue 664 (ref. 10). This latter design, designated
SOSIP.664, when applied to clade-A BG505 (ref. 11), produced a
stable, soluble and cleaved gp140 trimer with an outstanding
antigenic profile12,13 and excellent structural mimicry of the
native spike14–16. The atomic structures of BG505 SOSIP.664
trimer
from
X-ray
crystallography14,16
and
cryo-electron
microscopy
(EM)15
provided
a
detailed
picture
of
this
long-sought vaccine target. Some bNAbs that were previously
crystallized with gp120 core and scaffolded V1V2, such as PGV04
and PG9, have now been found to interact with other structural
elements present only on the native trimer to enhance recognition
of native virions14,15,17. Using the SOSIP trimer as a sorting
probe, new bNAbs have been identified and characterized18–22.
The SOSIP design has also been extended to other HIV-1
strains23–25 and permitted the incorporation of additional
stabilizing mutations26,27. Recently, the immunogenicity of
SOSIP
trimers
in
rabbits
and
non-human
primates
was
reported, paving the way for human vaccine trials28. While the
full benefit of retaining cleavage between gp120 and gp41 has
been demonstrated for the SOSIP trimer, the utility of flexible
linkers at the cleavage site has also been successfully explored
with the design of single-chain gp140 (sc-gp140)29 and native
flexibly linked (NFL) trimers30,31.
Furin

The
complexity in production of native-like trimers has limited the
use of nucleic acid vaccine platforms32–34 and also raised the
question of whether we have adequately addressed the causes of
HIV-1 Env metastability. In this study, we investigate the primary
causes of HIV-1 Env metastability and explore alternative
trimer designs. We hypothesize that the disorder observed at
the HR1 N terminus (residues 547–569) is indicative of
metastability that could potentially be minimized by protein
engineering. To this end, we evaluate 10 BG505 gp140 trimers
with computationally redesigned HR1. These constructs show
substantially higher trimer yield and purity, with native SOSIP-
like properties demonstrated by crystal structures, negative-stain
EM and antibody binding. We next examine the structural and
antigenic effects of replacing the furin cleavage site between
gp120 and gp41 with a linker in the context of a selected HR1
redesign. Our analyses uncover the sensitivity of gp140 folding to
modification of this proteolytic site, with a potential fusion
intermediate state observed for trimers with short linkers lacking
the SOS mutation. By contrast, the HR1-redesigned trimers with
a long linker, termed uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO)
trimers, adopt a native-like conformation that retains many
salient features of the SOSIP trimer. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of a generic HR1 linker in trimer stabilization for diverse
HIV-1 strains. Our rational approach towards redesign of two
critical regions of gp140—HR1 and the cleavage site—provides
valuable insights into HIV-1 Env metastability as well as novel
platforms for trimer-based vaccine design.
Results
Ensemble-based design of the HR1 N terminus. We hypothe-
sized that the N terminus of HR1 (residues 547–569) is a critical
determinant of HIV-1 trimer metastability because it is poised to
elongate the HR1 helix during fusion and is disordered in all but
one crystal structure of the SOSIP trimer35 and one cryo-EM
structure of full-length, wild-type (WT) Env36, where it still
appears less ordered in comparison with the surrounding regions
(Fig. 1a). Such disorder at the top of the long HR1 central helix
may seem unexpected since this region resides in the core of the
Env complex; however, because this region is expected to form a
helix in the postfusion state, as in the equivalent region of
influenza hemagglutinin and other type 1 viral fusion proteins37,
it must remain less ordered or adopt a different conformation in
the prefusion state. For the SOSIP design, in addition to an
engineered disulfide bond (A501C/T605C), the I559P mutation
was introduced to destabilize the postfusion state10 and was
critical for the production of high-quality trimers, strongly
supporting the notion that this HR1 region might be related to
metastability. In this study, the HR1 bend was rationally
redesigned to stabilize the prefusion conformation rather than
to destabilize the postfusion conformation as in the SOSIP trimer
(Fig. 1b). Although this WT HR1 region consists of 21 residues,
the Ca distance between G547 and T569 is merely 24.8 Å, which
is equivalent to a fully extended polypeptide backbone of only 6.3
residues. Here we examined two loop lengths—8 and 10
residues—for the HR1 redesign, allowing for a small degree of
flexibility while markedly shortening the WT HR1 loop. We
utilized ensemble-based de novo protein design (see Methods) to
identify sequences that may stabilize the prefusion conformation
(Fig. 1c). Given a specified loop length, a large ensemble of
backbone conformations was generated to bridge the gap
between G547 and T569 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). For 8-residue
loops, the Ca root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) ranged
from 1.3 to 5.7 Å with an average of 2.3 Å, whereas 10-residue
loops exhibited an average Ca RMSF of 3.6 Å (Supplementary
Fig. 1b). After an exhaustive sampling in sequence space, all
designs were ranked by their energy scores (Supplementary
Fig. 1c). The 5 top-ranking sequences for each loop length,
totaling
10,
were
advanced
to
experimental
validation
(Supplementary Fig. 1d).

 trimer designs11,29,30. Following a similar strategy, we assessed
the 10 HR1-redesigned BG505 trimers containing the same
T332N (to restore the N332 epitope), SOS (A501C/T605C) and
R6 mutations as in the SOSIP.664 trimer (except for I559P). As
noted, different purification protocols can produce trimers of
varying quality. Here we adopted a rather simple protocol
utilizing materials that are readily available to most researchers.
All constructs were expressed transiently in HEK293F cells with
co-transfected furin as previously described11. The secreted Env
proteins were purified using a Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL)
column followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300 column.
One-litre expression produced sufficient quantities (3–7 mg) of
HR1-redesigned trimers, compared with three 2-l expressions
for the SOSIP trimer. Although GNL purification does not
yield the purest trimers24, it enables comparison of basic
properties between various trimer constructs such as monomer,
dimer and higher multimeric species (aggregates) that would
otherwise be filtered out by more sophisticated purification
methods.
We compared the SEC profiles through simple metrics,
utilizing ultraviolet (UV) 280 nm absorbance values (Fig. 2a).
The UV value of the trimer peak was used as an indicator of the
trimer yield, with the aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks
measured as percentages of their UV values versus that of the
trimer peak. The 2-l SOSIP expression showed an average UV
value of 371 for the trimer peak, with average percentages of 31%
and 49% for the aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks, respec-
tively (Fig. 2a, top). The five 8-residue HR1 redesigns showed
significantly increased trimer yield with reduced aggregate and
dimer/monomer peaks in the SEC profiles (Fig. 2a, middle).
Overall, HR1 redesigns 1 and 2 were the best performers in this
group. For example, the HR1 redesign 2 showed a near-twofold
increase in the trimer peak, with a 16 and 22% reduction for
aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks relative to SOSIP, indicative
of improvement in both trimer yield and purity. The five 10-
residue HR1 redesigns showed a similar but less pronounced
improvement (Fig. 2a, bottom). Notwithstanding, HR1 redesign
10 showed a UV value for the trimer peak that is comparable to
the SOSIP trimer from 2-l expression, with the same low level of
unwanted Env species as HR1 redesigns 1 and 2. This finding was
consistent with the blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(BN-PAGE) that showed more intense trimer bands on the gel
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). The trimer-containing fractions eluted
at 10.25–10.75 ml were used for the initial assessment of trimer

 stability by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For all 10
tested HR1 redesigns, we observed similar unfolding peaks with a
thermal denaturation midpoint (Tm) ranging from 65.7 to 69.2 �C
(Supplementary Fig. 2b), closely resembling the Tm of 68.1 �C
reported for the SOSIP trimer11.
Overall, redesign of this shortened HR1 region exerted a
positive effect on the Env trimers. While the HR1 redesigns
retained the thermal stability of parent SOSIP.664 trimer, they
also increased the trimer yield and reduced other undesirable
Env species, supporting the notion that this HR1 connecting loop
is a key determinant of HIV-1 trimer metastability.
Crystallographic analysis of two HR1 redesigns. HR1 redesigns
1 and 9 were selected for crystallographic analysis. These
two constructs differed in their redesigned loop lengths (8 versus
10 residues) and SEC profiles, with a higher dimer/monomer
peak observed for HR1 redesign 9 (Fig. 2a), which provided an
opportunity to examine how HR1 loop length and design
variation
affect
trimer
structure.
Owing
to
the
stringent
requirement of sample homogeneity for crystallization, we
prepared the HR1-redesigned
and WT SOSIP trimers
as
previously described38. In brief, all trimers were produced in
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative (GnTI–/–) HEK293S
cells and purified using a 2G12 affinity column followed by SEC
on a Superdex 200 16/600 column. For the WT SOSIP trimer, the
SEC profile displayed a notable aggregate peak of high molecular
weight with a UV value that is 58% of the trimer peak, and a
lower peak containing gp140 monomers and dimers (Fig. 2b,
upper panel). By contrast, the 2G12-purified HR1 redesigns
showed a marked improvement in trimer yield and purity
(Fig. 2b, lower panel). Of note, HR1 redesign 1 showed an
almost undetectable level of monomers and dimers, whereas
HR1 redesign 9 still contained a small fraction of impurities.
Nevertheless, the SEC profiles of 293S-expressed, 2G12-purified
trimers
are
consistent
with
those
of
the
293F-expressed,
GNL-purified trimers described above (Fig. 2a). This finding
was
further
confirmed
by
BN-PAGE
of
SEC
fractions
(Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) and thermal stability of the modified
trimers
measured
by
DSC
(Fig.
2b),
suggesting
that
the improved trimer properties are an intrinsic feature of the
HR1
redesigns
and
independent
of
the
expression
and
purification systems.
Co-crystallization with antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of
PGT128 and 8ANC195 yielded Env complex structures at
resolutions of 6.9 and 6.3 Å for HR1 redesigns 1 and 9,
respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). Overall, the
redesigned trimers showed nearly identical structures to that of
the SOSIP trimer14–16 at this modest resolution, with Ca
root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) o0.25 Å (Fig. 2c). Thus,
the results confirmed that gp140 trimers with shortened and
redesigned HR1 still adopt a native-like prefusion conformation.
The limited resolution of the crystal structure allowed us to only
determine the approximate backbone conformation of the
redesigned HR1 loop, but nevertheless provided insights into
how these two distinct designs stabilize the prefusion trimer. We
speculate that the shortened loop (8 or 10 versus 21 residues in
WT) and redesigned sequence disrupt the heptad repeat motif
that extends the HR1 helix in the postfusion state, thereby
stabilizing the prefusion form. Furthermore, both HR1 redesigns
contained proline, at positions 2 and 6 in the 8-residue loop and
at position 8 in the 10-residue loop (Fig. 2c), which likely
increases the rigidity of the backbone. Of note, Asp 6 in HR1
redesign 9 is poised to form a salt bridge with Arg 579 of the
neighbouring HR1 helix, stabilizing the slightly turned loop
(Fig. 2c, right). In conclusion, gp140 appears to be highly tolerant
of the HR1 redesign, which can enhance the efficiency of protein
production without sacrificing overall structural integrity.
Antigenic profiling of HR1-redesigned BG505 gp140 trimers.
The BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer represents a close mimic of the
native spike for immune recognition by antibodies11–13. Here we
sought to investigate whether the HR1 redesign would affect Env
trimer
binding
to bNAbs
and
non-NAbs using
bio-layer
interferometry (BLI) with immunoglobulin G (IgG). Again, we
studied trimers prepared using a simple GNL purification so that
we could compare the basic properties of different trimer
constructs.

Superdex 200 16/600 column following GNL purification was
performed to facilitate the selection of well-folded trimers for
antigenic profiling (Fig. 3a). In this context, we also characterized
the HR1 redesign 1 by negative-stain EM. In the unliganded state,
a reconstruction at B22-Å resolution displayed a morphology
closely resembling that of the SOSIP trimer prepared using the
same protocol (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). The agreement
of crystal and EM structures further confirmed the integrity of
HR1-redesigned trimers before antigenic characterization.
First, we measured trimer binding to a panel of representative
bNAbs (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5a). We utilized V1V2
apex-directed, quaternary bNAbs PGDM1400 (ref. 22), PGT145
(ref. 39) and PG16 (ref. 40) to examine whether the trimeric
structure with associated glycan shield was native-like. For
PGDM1400, HR1 redesigns 1 and 9 displayed faster on- and
off-rates than WT SOSIP, with KD (koff/kon) values ranging from 7
to 11nM. A similar pattern was observed for PG16 and PGT145.
For VRC01, a representative of a class of CD4-binding site
(CD4bs)-directed bNAbs41–44, all three trimers showed nearly
identical binding profiles, suggesting that HR1 redesign had little
effect on the presentation of this conserved site of vulnerability.
A similar pattern was also seen for NAb b12, which engages the
CD4bs with a different angle of approach than VRC01 (ref. 45).
For bNAbs targeting the V3 stem and surrounding glycans,
including N332 (PGT121, PGT128 and PGT135 (ref. 39)), and the
high-mannose gp120 glycan cluster (2G12 (ref. 46)), all three
trimers showed identical binding profiles, indicating that these
glycan epitopes remained intact upon HR1 redesign. Finally, we
measured
trimer
binding
to
two
bNAbs
that
recognize
conformational epitopes spanning regions in both gp120 and
gp41 (refs 19,21). All three trimers bound strongly to PGT151 with
a fast on-rate and a flat dissociation curve, while subtle differences
were observed in 35O22-binding kinetics.
Next, we measured trimer binding to a panel of representative
non-NAbs (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 5b). All three
tested trimers bound to CD4bs-specific b6 and F105. The
HR1-redesigned trimers displayed weaker binding to F105 than
did the SOSIP trimer, with a slightly faster off-rate detected for
HR1 redesign 1. However, no differences in kinetics were
observed for b6. For V3-specific 19b and 447-52D, all three
trimers showed fast association and slow dissociation, indicative
of some V3 exposure in the trimer preparation. Previously, 19b
was
found
to
bind
the
SOSIP
trimer
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but only to a limited extent by
EM and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)11,12. In this study, SPR
analysis of 2G12-purified BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer showed
consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 6). The differences in
experimental
set-ups
such
as
analyte
immobilization
(see
Methods and ref. 12) may have contributed to the more visible
V3 exposure by BLI. Nevertheless, the V3 exposure may be
minimized by conformational fixation as recently demonstrated
for the SOSIP trimer26,27. We then tested F240 and 7B2, which
recognize
the
immunodominant
epitopes

 gp41ECTO. The SOSIP trimer appeared to bind both antibodies at
a low level with a slight preference for F240. Interestingly, the two
HR1 redesigns showed reduced binding to F240 and almost
negligible binding to 7B2, indicating a more closed or less flexible
gp41ECTO. We also investigated two CD4i antibodies, 17b and
A32. All three trimers showed no binding to 17b in the absence of
soluble CD4 (sCD4), with HR1 redesign 1 exhibiting only a
minimal level of A32 recognition although all trimers bound very
weakly to this antibody.
Overall, the two HR1 redesigns displayed broadly similar
patterns in their recognition by bNAbs with the exception of
altered kinetics for apex-directed quaternary bNAbs. While all
three trimers showed some V3 exposure, the two HR1 redesigns
appeared to shield non-neutralizing gp41ECTO epitopes more
effectively than the SOSIP trimer. The observed binding to
non-NAbs may be attributed to the use of IgG instead of Fab that
can substantially enhance avidity and the use of a different
immobilization strategy in the BLI experiment.
Replacing the furin cleavage site with short linkers. Sharma
et al.30 reported a native-like, cleavage-independent gp140 trimer
designated NFL. In another study, Georgiev et al. replaced the
cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 with linkers of up to 20
residues
(termed
sc-gp140)29.
Although
the
presence
of
aberrant structures was speculated for sc-gp140 trimers with
short linkers29, the precise effect of cleavage site modification
on
gp140
folding
and
structure
remained
unclear.
We
addressed this critical issue in the context of HR1 redesign 1,
which had been validated both structurally and antigenically
(Figs 2 and 3).
We first examined the outcome of replacing the cleavage
site-containing region (residues 500–519) with a redesigned
connecting loop between gp120 and gp41 (Fig. 4a). The Ca
distance between R500 and F519 is 16.8 Å, equivalent to a fully
extended backbone of 4.4 residues. Ensemble-based protein
design yielded a large pool of 8-residue loops connecting R500
and F519 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Of note, this design strategy
was rather aggressive because these loops may pack differently
than the uncleaved WT sequence due to a 10-residue truncation
in this region and exclusion of the SOS mutation, as A501 was
now part of the region to be redesigned (accordingly, the T605C
mutation was reversed). The five top-ranking designs (termed
CST1-5, Supplementary Fig. 7b) were characterized by SEC on a
Superdex 200 10/300 column following transient expression in
HEK293F cells without furin and GNL purification (Fig. 4b,

 upper panel). Overall, CST1-5 showed reduced trimer yield, as
well as increased aggregates compared with the parent HR1
redesign 1, as indicated by a higher shoulder left of the main
trimer peak in the SEC profiles. For all five cleavage site truncated
(CST) constructs, an extra band was observed in BN-PAGE,
suggesting the presence of an uncharacterized Env species in the
produced proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7c).
We next examined the effect of replacing the cleavage site
508REKR511 with a near-full-length serine-glycine-serine (SGS)
linker (termed CSF) (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, CSF displayed a
notably reduced aggregate peak in the SEC profile compared with
CST1-5, which was further improved by adding back the SOS
mutation (termed CSF-SOS; Fig. 4b, lower panel). Similar to
CST1-5, an extra band was observed for the CSF trimer in
BN-PAGE of trimer-containing fractions after SEC on a Superdex
200 16/600 column (Fig. 4c), suggesting a common pattern
associated with short cleavage site linkers. To identify this
unknown Env species, we used negative-stain EM to obtain
three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions for the CSF trimer
(Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8). Remarkably, two distinct
morphologies were observed for the unliganded trimer: one in the
prefusion state (at B20 Å) similar to the SOSIP trimer and the
other in a non-prefusion state (B17 Å) that has not been
reported
previously
(Fig.
4d).
This
non-prefusion
trimer
conformation (state 2) contains an extended gp41 (B40–45 Å)
and is referred to as a putative ‘fusion intermediate’ hereafter. The
B20 Å EM reconstructions of PGV04-bound CSF trimers in the
two different states showed some unoccupied densities that could
not be interpreted at this resolution (Fig. 4d). By contrast, a single
conformation was observed for the EM reconstruction of the
CSF-SOS trimer in both unliganded (B21 Å) and PGV04-bound
(B20 Å) forms. In summary, with short cleavage site linkers the
CST and CSF trimers contained a putative fusion intermediate
state that could be effectively suppressed by the SOS mutation.
We then examined the antigenicity of CSF and CSF-SOS
trimers using a small antibody panel (Supplementary Fig. 9). For
bNAbs, we utilized PGDM1400, VRC01 and PGT151, which
target
the
V1V2
apex,
CD4bs
and
gp120-gp41
interface,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9a). CSF and CSF-SOS bound
to PGDM1400 with similar kinetics and affinities, but with a
reduced signal observed for CSF, which contains two trimer
forms. CSF and CSF-SOS exhibited identical VRC01-binding
profiles compared with SOSIP, suggesting that the CD4bs is
equally accessible in all of these trimers. For PGT151, CSF and
CSF-SOS showed reduced binding with a notable off-rate,
suggesting that the linker between gp120 and gp41 may affect
PGT151
binding, which is
cleavage dependent18,19. Three
non-NAbs were also tested (Supplementary Fig. 9b). CSF
bound more strongly to CD4bs-directed F105 than CSF-SOS
due to the presence of putative fusion intermediates. For
V3-directed 19b, both CSF trimers displayed similar binding
profiles relative to the SOSP trimer and HR1 redesign 1. By
contrast, CSF showed enhanced binding to gp41-directed F240
that was effectively reduced by the SOS mutation in CSF-SOS.
Replacing the furin cleavage site with long linkers. On the basis
of our analysis thus far and the reports on NFL and sc-gp140
trimers29,30, we hypothesized that combining HR1 redesign
with a long cleavage site linker may overcome the tendency to
form fusion intermediates and render an uncleaved prefusion-
optimized trimer. To this end, we tested two gp140 trimers based
on HR1 redesign 1 and an NFL-like linker (2 � G4S)30 (Fig. 5a).
These two constructs, termed cleavage site long (CSL) and
CSL-SOS, were transiently expressed in HEK293F cells followed
by GNL purification and SEC on a Superdex 200 16/600 column.
Both CSL trimers showed similar expression levels and SEC
profiles to those of CSF trimers (Figs 5b and 4b). For CSL,
although no extra bands were definitively identified on the BN
gel, the trimer bands appeared to be more diffuse than those
observed
for
CSL-SOS
(Fig.
5c).
To
further
characterize
their structures, we obtained negative-stain EM reconstructions
for the unliganded CSL and CSL-SOS trimers at B17 and 20 Å
resolutions, respectively (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 10). The
CSL trimer showed a somewhat different morphology than WT
SOSIP, HR1 redesign 1, prefusion CSF and CSF-SOS trimers:
the density of CSL trimer appeared to be narrower at the top of
the trimer apex with additional densities pointing outwards
and a wider bottom around gp41ECTO. The overall shape of the
CSL-SOS trimer was consistent with that of the CSF-SOS trimer.
The B20-Å reconstructions of PGV04-bound CSL and CSL-SOS
trimers resembled that of the SOSIP trimer, indicative of
stabilization on bNAb binding (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Taken
together, our results suggest that a long cleavage site linker can
reduce the formation of fusion intermediates.
We performed antigenic profiling for the CSL and CSL-SOS
trimers using the same panel of bNAbs and non-NAbs as for the
two HR1 redesigns (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 11). For
apex-directed bNAbs PGDM1400, PG16 and PGDM145, the two
CSL trimers showed similar binding kinetics and affinities to
those of HR1 redesign 1. For CD4bs-directed bNAb VRC01, NAb
b12, and glycan-reactive bNAbs (PGT121, PGT128, PGT135 and
2G12), CSL and CSL-SOS showed nearly identical binding
profiles to those of HR1 redesign 1 and the SOSIP trimer.
As
expected,
the
most
visible
difference
was
found
for
bNAbs PGT151 and 35O22. For PGT151, which binds an
epitope consisting of one gp120 and two adjacent gp41s in a
trimer18,19, the cleaved HR1-redesigned trimers and SOSIP trimer
showed flat dissociation curves (Fig. 3c). However, the CSL
trimers showed faster off-rates similar to those observed for the
CSF trimers, indicating a consistent effect caused by cleavage site
linkers (Fig. 6a). By contrast, the off-rates appeared to be
cleavage-independent for 35O22, which targets gp120 and gp41
in a single gp140 protomer21. Binding to F240 and 7B2 revealed
less accessible, non-neutralizing epitopes on gp41 for CSL-SOS
but not for CSL, consistent with observations for the two CSF
trimers (Fig. 6b).
In summary, an NFL-like long linker between gp120 and gp41
used in combination with an optimal HR1 redesign yielded an
uncleaved gp140 that retained the most desirable traits of a
prefusion trimer. Our comparative analysis of linker length also
revealed complex consequences of cleavage site modification.
Therefore, changing the linker length at the cleavage site must be
carefully evaluated in each case of trimer immunogen design.
A generic HR1 linker to stabilize diverse Env trimers. Although
cleavage site linkers might cause complications, HR1 redesign
appeared to have an overall positive effect on trimer structure and
antigenicity. In light of this finding, we revisited the strategy for
HR1 redesign by examining the utility of a simple GS linker
(Fig. 7a). If such a ‘generic’ HR1 linker (termed HR1-G) is proven
successful, it will not only confirm the role of this HR1 region in
Env metastability but also enable further development of stable
trimers for diverse HIV-1 strains. We first tested the generic HR1
linker in the context of clade-A BG505, clade-B JRFL and clade-C
DU172.17,
with
their
WT
SOSIP
trimers
included
for
comparison. For the three strains studied, the GS linker showed
consistent improvement on trimer yield and purity (Fig. 7b).
The most substantial improvement was observed for a clade-C
strain: 46% increase of trimer peak relative to SOSIP with the
aggregate and dimer/monomer peaks reduced by 34% and 37%,

 respectively. For this clade-C strain, two top-ranking HR1
redesigns from the ensemble-based protein design further
increased the trimer peak by B50% with identical SEC profiles to
HR1-G. For the two B0/C recombinant strains, CH115.12 and
CN54, similar SEC profiles with a less pronounced improvement
in trimer purity were observed for the HR1-redesigned and
CSF-SOS trimers, suggesting additional factors contributing to
the metastability of B0/C recombinant Envs (Fig. 7c). Overall,
the results indicate that the generic HR1 linker offers a general
framework for stabilization of Env while further improvement of
trimer properties can be achieved by computational design in a
strain-specific manner (Fig. 7d).
Discussion
An effective HIV-1 vaccine will likely involve immunogens that
mimic the native, prefusion trimer47. However, development of
such trimer immunogens has been hampered by the labile nature
of the Env spike and, until recently, the lack of structural details.
This
obstacle
was
spectacularly
overcome
by
the
BG505
SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer11, which facilitated high-resolution
analyses of Env structure14–16,35 and provided a rational basis
for vaccine design. Recent advances include expansion of the
SOSIP design to other HIV-1 strains23,24, incorporation of new
stabilizing mutations26 and removal of furin dependency by using
cleavage site linkers27,29,30. However, a premium is placed
on trimer purification to remove unwanted Env forms and
misfolded trimers. Trimer purification is currently achieved by
complex methods such as bNAb affinity column, negative
selection and multi-cycle SEC, which can be adapted for
industrial-scale
production
but
will
likely
require
special
considerations.
It
is
plausible
that
trimer
impurity
and
production inefficiency are linked to the fundamental causes of
Env metastability that have not been completely resolved by
previous trimer designs.
In this study, we investigated the underlying causes of HIV-1
Env metastability with a rational design strategy. We first
directed our attention to an HR1 region that undergoes drastic
conformational change during viral fusion with host cells. This
region (residues 547–569) has not been explicitly explored, with
the exception of the I559P mutation in the SOSIP design10 that
was originally speculated to destabilize the postfusion state10 and
validated by recent structural studies35,36. We shortened and
computationally optimized this region in an attempt to stabilize
the prefusion trimer conformation. Significantly, almost all HR1
redesigns showed substantial improvement in trimer yield and
purity, suggesting that this disordered HR1 region is a major site
of metastability and may indeed be a source of folding inefficiency
and sample impurity in the production of soluble Env trimers.
Structural analysis and antigenic profiling together established
HR1 redesign 1 as a primary candidate to investigate the effect
of cleavage site modification. While linker length has been
extensively examined for NFL and sc-gp140 trimers29,30, its effect
on trimer metastability has not been addressed. The major effort

 in those studies had been to remove unwanted Env species
resulting from cleavage site modification rather than to determine
their cause. We examined various cleavage site linkers in the
context of an HR1 redesign. In the uncleaved gp140 form, the
tendency for Env misfolding appeared to be inversely correlated
with linker length, as revealed by the analysis of CST, CSF and
CSL trimers. By collapsing the trimer ensemble into two
predominant states, the CST and CSF designs captured possible
fusion
intermediates
that
are
most
likely
inherent
to
uncleaved gp140 trimers but were previously inaccessible.
Future high-resolution studies of such intermediate states could
greatly
enhance
our
understanding
of
the
HIV-1
fusion
mechanism.
The results from a generic HR1 linker have important
implications.
The
high
trimer
yield
and
purity
obtained
from this simple GS linker and further improvement by
computational design suggested a general strategy for identifying
vaccine-suitable strains and designing stable gp140 trimers based
on these strains. Finally, given the presence of an HR1-like
region in most enveloped viruses using the type 1 fusion
mechanism48–50, the generic HR1 redesign is potentially a
universal strategy to stabilize soluble envelope trimers for
vaccine development.
Methods
Ensemble-based de novo protein design. We developed an ensemble-based de
novo protein design method (Fig. 1c). Given the Env trimer structure (PDB ID:
4TVP) and a specified loop length, a three-step design process was undertaken: (1)
an ensemble of backbone conformations (1,000) is generated to connect the two
anchor residues using a torsion-space loop sampling algorithm51; (2) for each loop
backbone, a starting sequence is selected from a pool of 50 random sequences based
on the RAPDF potential52 and subjected to 500 steps of Monte Carlo simulated
annealing with the temperature linearly decreasing from 300 to 10 K; (3) the
lowest-energy sequence for each backbone is recorded and all Monte Carlo
simulated annealing-derived designs are ranked based on energy at the completion
of the process. The top 20 designs are then manually inspected to facilitate selection
of 5 candidates for experimental validation. The computer code for ensemble-based
protein design can be obtained from J.Z. upon request.

antigenicity of redesigned trimers. 2G12 and b12, as well as non-NAbs F240, 7B2, 17b

Expression and purification of HIV-1 Env trimers. Env trimers were transiently
expressed in HEK293F cells (Life Technologies, CA) except for crystallographic
analysis. Briefly, 293F cells were thawed and incubated with FreeStyle 293 Expression
Medium (Life Technologies, CA) in a shaker incubator at 37 �C, with 135r.p.m. and
8% CO2. When the cells reached a density of 2.0� 106 ml� 1, expression medium
was added to reduce cell density to 1.0� 106 ml� 1 for transfection with poly-
ethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Inc). For SOSIP and HR1-redesigned trimers,
800 mg of Env plasmid and 300 mg of furin plasmid in 25ml of Opti-MEM
transfection medium (Life Technologies, CA) was mixed with 5 ml of PEI-MAX
(1.0 mg ml� 1) in 25ml of Opti-MEM, whereas for uncleaved trimers, 900 mg of Env
plasmid was used without furin. After incubation for 30 min, the DNA-PEI-MAX
complex was added to 1-l 293F cells. Culture supernatants were collected 5 days after
transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 1,800r.p.m. for 20min, and filtered using
0.45-mm filters (Thermo Scientific). The Env proteins were extracted from the
supernatants using a GNL column (Vector Labs). The bound proteins were eluted
with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 1 M methyl-a-D-mannopyranoside and then
purified by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column for initial assess-
ment, and a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 PG column (GE Healthcare) for EM
analysis and antigenic profiling. Protein concentrations were determined using
UV280 absorbance with theoretical extinction coefficients.

 BN-PAGE. Env proteins were analysed by BN-PAGE and stained with Coomassie
blue. The protein samples were mixed with G250 loading dye and added to a
4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies). BN-PAGE gels were run for 2 h
at 150 V using the NativePAGE running buffer (Life Technologies) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal melting curves of SOSIP and
HR1-redesigned trimers were obtained with a MicroCal VP-Capillary calorimeter
(Malvern). The SEC-purified glycoproteins were buffer exchanged into 1 � PBS
and concentrated to 0.5–1 mM before analysis by the instrument. Melting was
probed at a scan rate of 90 �C h � 1. Data processing including buffer correction,
normalization and baseline subtraction was conducted using the standardized
protocol from the Origin 7.0 software.
Protein production and purification for crystallization. The two HR1-
redesigned trimers, as well as the Fabs 8ANC195 and PGT128, were produced and
purified as previously described38. Briefly, all constructs were cloned into the
expression vector phCMV3. Fabs were transiently transfected into mammalian
FreeStyle 293F cells, and trimers were transiently transfected in GnTI � / � 293S
cells. One week after transfection, the supernatants of the antibody-transfected cells
were collected and purified using a LC-l and a LC-k Capture Select column
(BAC BV) for PGT128 and 8ANC195, respectively, before further purification by
ion exchange chromatography and SEC. The supernatants of the trimer-transfected
cells were purified using a 2G12 affinity column followed by SEC. The trimer
complexes used for crystallization trials were prepared by mixing the trimer
proteins with Fabs PGT128 and 8ANC195 at a molar ratio of 1.0:1.2:1.2 at
room temperature for 20 min. This mixture was then partially deglycosylated using
endoglycosidase H (EndoH) in 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 37 �C
for 1 h following the manufacturer’s protocol (New England Biolabs) before final
purification by SEC.
Protein crystallization and data collection. Two purified protein complexes
containing Fabs PGT128 and 8ANC195 bound to HR1-redesigned trimers were
prepared for crystallization by buffer exchange into 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.2. The complexes were then concentrated to 5 mg ml � 1 and passed through a
0.22-mm filter before crystal screening using the IAVI/JCSG/TSRI CrystalMation
robot (Rigaku) at the JCSG53. Similar to a previously described complex of Fabs
PGT128 and 8ANC195 with a BG505 SOSIP gp140 trimer38, the HR-1 redesigned
trimer/Fab complexes were crystallized at 25 �C in 0.05 M lithium sulfate, 0.05 M
sodium sulfate, 20% (w/v) PEG 400 and 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.7 (JCSG Core Suite
1 condition: A03, Qiagen). All crystals for X-ray data collection were cryoprotected
by brief immersion in mother liquor supplemented with 40% PEG 400 before
flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. For the HR1 redesign 1 complex, diffraction data
to 6.3 Å resolution were collected at beamline 23ID-B at the Advanced Photon
Source, processed with HKL-2000 (ref. 54), and indexed in space group I23 with
100% completeness and an hIi/hsIi of 2.3 in the highest-resolution shell. For the
HR1 redesign 9 complex, diffraction data to 6.9 Å resolution were collected at
beamline 12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, processed with
HKL-2000 (ref. 54), and indexed in space group I23 with 100% completeness and
an hIi/hsIi of 1.3 in the highest resolution shell. Data collection and processing
statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Structure determination and refinement. The HR1-redesigned gp140 trimer
structures bound to PGT128 and 8ANC195 were solved by the molecular
replacement method using Phaser55 and a search model consisting of a BG505
SOSIP.664 Env trimer bound to Fabs PGT128 and 8ANC195 (PDBID: 5C7K).
As described previously38, refinement consisted of alternating rounds of manual
model building using Coot-0.7 (ref. 56 and automated refinement as implemented
by the Phenix programme57. Given the limited resolution of the data sets, grouped
B-factor refinement for each residue was used. Furthermore, positional coordinate
refinement was enforced using a reference model set of restraints. The starting
model for each automated refinement session in Phenix was defined as the
reference model for that session. Finally, the model was minimally modified except
at the HR1 site of redesign. The final Rcryst and Rfree values converged at 28.1% and
32.2%, and 28.4% and 32.2% for the complex structures of HR1 redesigns 1 and 9,
respectively. Coordinate error was calculated by the Phenix refinement
package using a maximum likelihood (ML)-based method57,58 (see Table 1 for
final refinement statistics). Fab residues were numbered according to Kabat
nomenclature59 and gp140 was numbered using the standard HXBc2 convention.
The redesigned regions in HR1 redesigns 1 and 9 were numbered 547A-H and
547A-J, respectively.
EM sample preparation. The Env gp140 trimers alone, and in complex with Fab
PGV04, were analysed by negative-stain EM. A 3-ml aliquot containing
B0.02 mg ml � 1 of the trimers was applied for 15 s onto a carbon-coated 400 Cu
mesh grid that had been glow discharged at 20 mA for 30 s, then negatively stained
with 2% uranyl formate for 30 s. Data were collected using a FEI Tecnai Spirit
electron microscope operating at 120 kV, with an electron dose of B30 e � Å � 2
and a magnification of � 52,000 that resulted in a pixel size of 2.05 Å at the
specimen plane. Images were acquired with a Tietz 4k � 4k TemCam-F416 CMOS
camera using a nominal defocus of 1,000 nm and the Leginon package60.
Image processing and 3D reconstruction. Particles were selected automatically
from the raw micrographs (Supplementary Fig. 12) using DoG Picker and put into
a particle stack using the Appion software package61. Initial, reference-free,
two-dimensional (2D) class averages were calculated using particles binned by two
via iterative multivariate statistical analysis/multireference alignment and sorted
into classes62. Particles corresponding to trimers or to trimers bound to PGV04
were selected into a substack and binned by two before another round of
reference-free alignment was carried out using the iterative multivariate statistical
analysis/multireference alignment and Xmipp Clustering and 2D alignment
programmes63. To analyse the quality of the trimers (closed native-like, partially
open native-like and non-native), the reference-free 2D class averages were
examined by eye using the metrics previously described23. An ab initio common
lines model (Supplementary Fig. 13) was calculated from reference-free 2D class
averages in EMAN2 (ref. 64) imposing symmetry C3. This model was then refined
against raw particles for an additional 25 cycles using EMAN65. The resolutions of
the final models were determined using a Fourier Shell Correlation cutoff of 0.5.
The number of particles collected and used for the final 3D reconstructions is
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. For the CSF reconstructions (states 1
and 2), after 2D classification, unbinned particles were refined against a density
map of the unliganded trimer (Supplementary Fig. 13) filtered to a 60-Å resolution.
3D classification was then performed in RELION version 1.4b resulting in six
classes within each data set66,67. Stable classes were selected for further processing
followed by various steps of additional 3D classification. Stoichiometric classes
were selected for further refinement to generate the final maps for states 1 and
state 2, respectively. The EM maps were contoured at different threshold values to
facilitate a thorough comparison of the obtained 3D reconstructions
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
Bio-layer interferometry. The kinetics of trimer binding to bNAbs and non-NAbs
was measured using an Octet Red96 instrument (forte
´Bio, Pall Life Sciences).
All assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 r.p.m. in forte
´BIO 1 � kinetic
buffer. The final volume for all the solutions was 200 ml per well. Assays were
performed at 30 �C in solid black 96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One). A unit of
5 mg ml � 1 of antibody in 1 � kinetic buffer was loaded onto the surface of
anti-human Fc Capture Biosensors (AHC) for 300 s. A 60-s biosensor baseline step
was applied before the analysis of the association of the antibody on the biosensor
to the Env trimer in solution for 200 s. A twofold concentration gradient of trimer
starting at 200 nM was used in a titration series of six. The dissociation of the
interaction was followed for 300 s. Correction of baseline drift was performed by
subtracting the averaged shift recorded for a sensor loaded with antibody but not
incubated with trimer, or a sensor without antibody but incubated with
trimer. Octet data were processed by forte
´Bio’s data acquisition software v.8.1.
Experimental data were fitted for V1V2 apex-directed bNAbs using a global fit 1:1
model to determine the KD values and other kinetic parameters.
