Abstract 
Purpose: Experimental animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have shown that the updated 
airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) methodologies may significantly improve oxygenation, maximize lung 
recruitment, and attenuate lung injury, without circulatory depression. This led us to hypothesize that early applica-
tion of APRV in patients with ARDS would allow pulmonary function to recover faster and would reduce the duration 
of mechanical ventilation as compared with low tidal volume lung protective ventilation (LTV).
Methods: A total of 138 patients with ARDS who received mechanical ventilation for <48 h between May 2015 to 
October 2016 while in the critical care medicine unit (ICU) of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University were 
enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive APRV (n = 71) or LTV (n = 67). The settings for APRV 
were: high airway pressure  
(Phigh) set at the last plateau airway pressure  
(Pplat), not to exceed 30  
cmH2O) and low 
airway pressure (  
Plow) set at 5  
cmH2O; the release phase  
(Tlow) setting adjusted to terminate the peak expiratory flow 
rate to ≥ 50%; release frequency of 10–14 cycles/min. The settings for LTV were: target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of pre-
dicted body weight;  
Pplat not exceeding 30 cmH2O; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) guided by the PEEP–FiO2 
table according to the ARDSnet protocol. The primary outcome was the number of days without mechanical ventila-
tion from enrollment to day 28. The secondary endpoints included oxygenation,  
Pplat, respiratory system compliance, 
and patient outcomes.
Results: Compared with the LTV group, patients in the APRV group had a higher median number of ventilator-free 
days {19 [interquartile range (IQR) 8–22] vs. 2 (IQR 0–15); P < 0.001}. This finding was independent of the coexisting 
differences in chronic disease. The APRV group had a shorter stay in the ICU (P = 0.003). The ICU mortality rate was 
19.7% in the APRV group versus 34.3% in the LTV group (P = 0.053) and was associated with better oxygenation and 
respiratory system compliance, lower  
Pplat, and less sedation requirement during the first week following enrollment 
(P < 0.05, repeated-measures analysis of variance).
Conclusions: Compared with LTV, early application of APRV in patients with ARDS improved oxygenation and res-
piratory system compliance, decreased  
Pplat and reduced the duration of both mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

Introduction
Although mechanical ventilation is an essential life sup-
port for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-
drome (ARDS), it can cause lung injury due to regional 
alveolar overstretch and/or repetitive alveolar collapse 
with shearing (atelectrauma) [1]. Ideally, mechanical 
ventilation should maintain lung units open throughout 
the ventilator cycle, which minimizes lung injury due to 
repetitive alveolar collapse and/or over distention. How-
ever, the lung injury may be heterogeneous, with the dif-
ferent lesion areas possibly needing markedly different 
levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [2, 3]. 
In the conventional lung protective ventilation strategy, 
which combines low tidal volume with sufficient PEEP, 
the selection of the “optimum” PEEP level to balance the 
recruitment and over-distension for an individual patient 
is still an unresolved problem in clinical practice [3–5], 
and mortality still remains high among those receiving 
mechanical ventilation [6].
Unlike conventional ventilation which generates tidal 
volume by raising the airway pressure above the PEEP, 
airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) delivers a 
continuous positive airway pressure with a brief inter-
mittent release phase, allowing the release of only partial 
lung volume and spontaneous breathing throughout the 
high level [7]. Recent experiments have suggested that 
compared with the low tidal volume ventilation (LTV), 
the use of more physiology-driven APRV protocols in 
animals with ARDS improved alveolar recruitment and 
gas exchange, increased homogeneity, and reduced lung 
injury [8–10]. Nonetheless, data on ARDS are limited 
and usually sourced from small clinical trials in which 
variable outdated APRV settings have been used to study 
the use of APRV; consequently, the findings of these stud-
ies are controversial [11–15]. As such ARPV remains an 
unproven therapy for patients with ARDS. We hypothe-
sized that in patients with ARDS, early application of the 
updated APRV methodology would better improve oxy-
genation and respiratory system compliance and reduce 
the duration of mechanical ventilation compared to con-
ventional LTV [4].
Materials and methods
Patients
We performed this trial in the critical care medicine 
department of West China Hospital of Sichuan Univer-
sity, Sichuan province, China. This study was approved by 
the ethics committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan 
University in accordance with the Helsinki Declara-
tion. Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patients’ authorized surrogates. The clinical trial registra-
tion number was NCT02639364.
Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled 
in the study from May 2015 to October 2016: fulfilled 
the diagnostic criteria of ARDS, according to the Ber-
lin definition [16]; had a ratio of partial pressure arterial 
oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen  
(PaO2:  
FiO2) of 
≤250 during invasive mechanical ventilation [17]; had 
received endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventila-
tion for <48h prior to inclusion [17]. The exclusion crite-
ria of the study were as follows: pregnancy; anticipated 
duration of invasive mechanical ventilation for <48 h; 
intracranial hypertension (suspected or confirmed); 
neuromuscular disorders that are known to prolong the 
need for mechanical ventilation; severe chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease; preexisting conditions with an 
expected 6-month mortality exceeding 50%; presence of 
documented barotrauma; treatment with extracorpor-
eal support (ECMO) at enrollment; refractory shock; 
lack of commitment to life support; age of <18 years or 
>85 years. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 
the APRV group or to the LTV group by random selec-
tion of opaque sealed envelopes for consecutive patients 
from a box of 138 envelopes. Each envelope contained 
a number by a random allocation process using a com-
puter-generated random block design.
Ventilator setting
Respiratory therapists performed ventilator manage-
ment. All patients were initially ventilated with volume 
assisted-control ventilation (VCV) using a Puritan Ben-
nett™ 840 Ventilator (Covidien, Medtronic Inc. Minne-
apolis, MN) prior to randomization to the APRV study 
arm or LTV study arm. In both groups, the mechanical 
ventilation goals were to maintain plateau airway pres-
sure  
(Pplat) at no more than 30  
cmH2O,  
PaO2 at between 
55 and 100 mm Hg (or pulse oximeter between 88 and 
98%), and arterial pH at ≥7.30. [4, 18].
LTV group
In the LTV group, tidal volume target  
(VT) was 6 mL/
kg predicted body weight (PBW), with allowances for 
4–8 mL/kg PBW to minimize asynchrony between the 
patient and ventilator; PEEP levels were adjusted, guided 
by the PEEP-FiO2 table, and then  
VT and the respira-
tory rate were regulated to achieve the above target pH

and  
Pplat values according to the ARDSnet protocol [4, 
19]. In the setting of hypotension (mean arterial pres-
sure of <60 mm Hg) or pneumothorax occurrence, PEEP 
levels were allowed to be further modified, according 
to the individual patient’s needs; if the  
PaO2:FiO2 ratio 
was <150 with  
FiO2 > 0.6, PEEP levels could be further 
titrated by the ways of optimum respiratory compliance 
or oxygenation, at the clinician’s discretion. If the patient 
presented severe respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.15), the 
respiratory rate was increased to 35 breaths per min-
ute, with titrations made in  
VT  
(Pplat target of 30  
cmH20 
may be exceeded), according to the ARDSnet protocol 
[4]. If severe respiratory acidosis persisted (pH < 7.15), 
 
NaHCO3 could be given [Appendix in Electronic Supple-
mentary Material (ESM)].
APRV group
Patients were transitioned from their previous volume 
assist-controlled ventilation to APRV with the follow-
ing initial settings: high airway pressure  
(Phigh) was set 
at the  
Pplat measured at the previous VCV settings, not 
to exceed 30  
cmH2O; low airway pressure  
(Plow) was set 
at 5  
cmH2O (minimal pressure level was used to prevent 
atelectasis per standard practice); duration of release

phase  
(Tlow) was initially set at one- to 1.5-fold the expir-
atory time constant, and then adjusted to achieve a ter-
mination of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of ≥50% of 
PEFR; release frequency was 10–14 frequency/min; dura-
tion of  
Phigh  
(Thigh) was indirectly calculated based on the 
 
Tlow and release frequency [9, 20]; initially spontaneous 
respiratory level was targeted as spontaneous minute 
ventilation  
(MVspont), approximately 30% total minute 
ventilation  
(MVtotal) (for details on the APRV settings for 
titration, see ESM Appendix Tables 3–5).
Analgesia and sedation
In the both groups, analgesia and sedation were managed 
to achieve the desired level of analgesia and sedation. The 
analgesia target level was a Critical-Care Pain Observa-
tional Tool (CPOT) score of 0–2, and the sedation goal 
was a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score 
of − 2 to 0. If patients exhibited anxiety, agitation, and/
orrespiratory distress, or they fought the ventilator, they 
would receive deeper sedation at less than a RASS score 
of − 2. According to our local sedation procedure, RASS 
and CPOT scores were assessed and recorded every 4 h 
(or more frequently when indicated) by the nursing staff, 
who adjusted the dosages of analgesic and sedative drugs 
to maintain the analgesia and sedation target level. In the 
APRV group, respiratory therapists would further titrate 
APRV settings and dosages of analgesics and sedatives to 
achieve the target level of spontaneous breathing level 
[21] (for details, see ESM Appendix Tables 3–5).
Procedures in both groups
For patients with severe hypoxemia (with no response 
to the assigned protocol and a  
PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <100 
during invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 12 h), 
clinicians could apply other supportive therapies for 
hypoxemia (e.g., recruitment maneuvers, prone position-
ing, neuromuscular blockade, or inhalation nitric oxide) 
in both groups (see ESM Appendix for details). Patients 
could receive rescue measures (including high frequency 
oscillatory ventilation or ECMO) at the clinician’s discre-
tion, in case of any one of the following life-threatening 
events: refractory hypoxemia  
(PaO2 < 55 mm Hg with 
an  
FiO2 of 1.0), refractory barotrauma (chest tube with 
active air leak, persistent pneumothorax, and/or sub-
cutaneous emphysema despite pleural space drainage), 
refractory respiratory acidosis (pH of ≤7.15), or refrac-
tory shock (even if sufficient fluid resuscitation and usage 
of vasoactive drugs).
Additionally, physicians applied usual care inter-
ventions for the general management of critically ill 
patients, according to the current guideline standards. 
Starting the first day following enrollment, in the LTV 
group if patients received deeper sedation (RASS score 
of <−2), the physicians would once daily interrupt the 
sedation, and the respiratory therapists would manage 
patients with the Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT) 
safety screen every morning. Those patients who passed 
the SBT safety screen underwent a 30-min SBT with a 
pressure support ventilation of 5–7  
cmH2O, PEEP of 5 
 
cmH2O, and  
FiO2 of ≤40% [21]. In the APRV group, in 
the first stage, as published previously [15, 20],  
Phigh was 
gradually reduced by 2  
cmH2O, simultaneously with a 
reduction in release rate by two frequencies/min, twice 
daily unless the patient’s cardiopulmonary function dete-
riorated. In the second stage, when patients achieved the 
criteria with a  
Phigh of 20 cmH2O on 40%  
FiO2, the respir-
atory therapist immediately started to perform the same 
weaningprotocol with SBT trial as in the LTV group [17]. 
When the SBT was successful, physicians and respiratory 
therapists decided to extubate the patients (for details see 
ESM Appendix).
The primary endpoint was the number of ventilator-
free days at day 28 (if patients died during the 28-day 
period after enrollment, the number of ventilator-free 
days was zero). The secondary endpoints included oxy-
genation and respiratory mechanics, such as  
Pplat, mean 
airway pressure, respiratory system compliance at base-
line and on days 1, 2, 3, and 7, as well as clinical out-
comes [the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
and hospital, ICU mortality and hospital mortality, and 
the occurrence of adverse events].  
(Pplat and respiratory 
system compliance measurements during the APRV are 
detailed in ESM Appendix. Fig. S1).
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-
free days at day 28. The mean (± standard deviation) 
number of ventilator-free days from day 1 to day 28 
is 14.5 ± 10.4 days in the low tidal volume and lower 
PEEP group according to Brower and colleagues, the 
ARDS network [22]. Putensen reported that APRV could 
shorted the duration of ventilator support by 6 days in 
patients at risk of ARDS compared with those pressure-
controlled ventilation [11]. We conservatively estimated 
that a sample size of 110 patients would be required to 
detect an increment of 5 days in the number ventilator-
free days at day 28 in the APRV group with 80% power 
and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. In total, 138 
patients were enrolled in the study in order to manage 
the drop-outs.
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, 
and as the median and interquartile ranges (IQR), or per-
centages. Continuous variables with a normal distribu-
tion were analyzed with the Student’s t test, Continuous 
variables with non-normal distribution were compared 
with the use of the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance. 
 1652
Dichotomous or nominal categorical variables were ana-
lyzed by either the Pearson Chi-square or Fisher’s exact 
test. The trend was assessed over time in oxygenation and 
respiratory mechanics repeated measurements by com-
paring the LTV group and APRV group at baseline and 
on days 1, 2, 3, and 7, with the use of the repeated-meas-
ures analysis. A two-sided P value of <0.05 was consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
From May 2015, through to October 2016, a total of 
138 patients with ARDS were enrolled in this intention-
to-treat analysis: 71 patients in the APRV group and 67 
patients in the LTV group (Fig. 1). The proportion of 
patients with an arterial oxygenation index  
(PaO2/FiO2) 
of <150 mmHg was similar between the APRV and LTV 
groups (66.2 vs. 61.2%, respectively; P = 0.541). Most of 
the patients in the two groups were severely ill, with a 
mean APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation II) score of 22.0 ± 7.9 in the APRV group and 
20.2 ± 7.6 in the LTV group (P = 0.178) (Table 1).
Respiratory and hemodynamic parameters and analgesia 
and sedation variables at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3, 
and 7 after enrollment
Respiratory parameters and arterial blood gas measure-
ments at baseline in the APRV group were similar to 
those in the LTV group, with the exception of respiratory 
rate which was higher in the APRV group (P = 0.039) 
(Table 2). On the third therapeutic day (Table 2), res-
piratory system compliance and the  
PaO2:FiO2 ratio were 
significantly improved in the APRV group compared 
to the LTV group (P < 0.001, respectively). The ventila-
tion setting frequency was lower in the APRV group 
(P = 0.002), but the monitoring of respiratory rates was 
similar in both groups. The values of  
Ppeak, PEEP, and  
Pplat 
were significantly lower in the APRV group (P < 0.01), 
the mean airway pressure was 5.8  
cmH2O higher in the 
APRV group than in the LTV group (P < 0.001), but the 
driving pressure was similar in both groups. The mean 
spontaneous minute ventilation was 1.78 ± 1.37 L/min in 
the APRV group. The total minute ventilation was lower 
in the APRV group than in the LTV group (P = 0.001); 
however, the values of  
PaCO2 and pH were similar in 
both groups. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were 
slightly improved (P < 0.05, respectively).
On days 1, 2, 3, and 7, compared to the LTV group, 
the mean airway pressure was higher in the APRV 
group (P < 0.001, by repeated-measures analysis of 
variance) (Fig. 2b) and respiratory system compli-
ance and  
PaO2:FiO2 were significantly better in the 
APRV group (P = 0.003 by repeated-measures analysis 
of variance) (Fig. 2c, d). On day 1, the  
PaO2:FiO2 value 
was 66.3 mmHg higher in the APRV group than in the 
LTV group (P < 0.001). Heart rates were lower and mean 
arterial pressures were a little higher in the APRV group 
than in the LTV group on days 2, 3, and 7 (P < 0.05 by 
repeated-measures analysis of variance) (Fig. 2e, f). The 
average doses of norepinephrine were similar (P = 0.612) 
(Fig. 2g). Compared with the LTV group, the sedation 
depth in the APRV group was lighter (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2h), 
and the average doses of fentanyl and midazolam were 
significantly lower (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2i, j), and the average 
doses of propofol were similar (P = 0.112) (Fig. 2k).
Study Outcomes
Study outcomes are presented in Table 3. The APRV pro-
tocol was associated with an increased number of venti-
lator-free days on day 28 than the LTV protocol [median 
19 days (IQR 8–22) vs. 2 days (IQR 0–15), respectively; 
P < 0.001] (Table 3 and Fig. 3); this result was supported 
by the per-protocol analysis results which also showed a 
similar difference [median 19 days (IQR 11–22) vs. 8 days 
(IQR 0–16), respectively; P < 0.001] (ESM Appendix Table 
S5). Although there were more patients with coexisting 
chronic diseases and lower sedation depth in the APRV 
group than in the LTV group (P < 0.05), only lighter seda-
tion increased ventilator-free days at day 28, and APRV 
still significantly increased ventilator-free days at day 28 
(P < 0.001) according to the multiple linear regression 
analysis for correction of the coexisting chronic diseases 
and sedation depth differences (ESM Appendix Table 
S4). There was a higher rate of successful extubation in 
the APRV group than in the LTV group (66.2 vs. 38.8%; 
P = 0.001), and fewer patients underwent tracheostomy 
in the APRV group (P = 0.013). The APRV protocol sig-
nificantly decreased the length of ICU stay (P = 0.015). 
The ICU and hospital mortality rates and length of hospi-
tal stay were similar for both groups. During the course of 
the study, more patients in the LTV group received neu-
romuscular blockers, recruitment maneuvers, and prone 
ventilation than in the APRV group (P < 0.05). 
Discussion
The main findings of this study were that compared 
with the LTV group, there was a shorter duration of 
mechanical ventilation in the APRV group, and early 
use of APRV in patients with ARDS could significantly 
improve oxygenation and respiratory system compli-
ance, decrease plateau airway pressure, and reduce 
sedation requirement. Patients in the APRV group also 
had shorter length of stay in the ICU, higher rate of suc-
cessful extubation, and lower tracheostomy rate than 
did patients in the LTV group. However, there was no 
 1653
difference in hospital length of stay, ICU mortality, hos-
pital mortality, or incidence of pneumothorax between 
the two groups.

[8–11, 21, 23], namely, that the early use of this APRV 
protocol in patients with ARDS significantly decreased 
plateau airway pressure, elevated mean airway pressure, 
and improved oxygenation and respiratory system com-
pliance, in comparison with LTV ventilation. Further-
more, there was no difference in  
PaCO2 and pH between 
the groups, despite APRV with lower minute ventilation, 
which indirectly indicated APRV decreasing dead space 
ventilation.
However, at present, data are only available from a lim-
ited number of small randomized prospective human 
studies with different APRV settings, with some studies 
showing benefits of APRV on pulmonary function and 
others showing similarities, as compared with CPPV or 
LTV [8, 11, 12, 15]. For example, one small randomized 
prospective trial [15] showed that adult trauma patients 
with acute respiratory failure on APRV or LTV had simi-
lar physiological parameters. However, the APRV meth-
odology used in that study was outdated: the upper limit 
of  
Phigh was 40 cmH2O, while current evidence sug-
gests that inspiratory-end pressure should be limited to 
30 cmH2O [4]; the  
Tlow was set at 25–75% of the PEFR, 
while  
Tlow of <50% of PEFR could result in dynamic 
heterogeneity between inspiration and expiration [10].

According to recent experimental findings, we set the 
 
Phigh not to exceed 30 cmH2O and the  
Tlow to be at ≥50% 
of PEFR; these settings were combined with APRV set-
tings and sedation titration to achieve the spontaneous 
breath target level.
There are collateral channels of ventilation, such as 
pores of Kohn, which might be additional pathways 
to facilitate recruitment and redistribute alveolar vol-
ume (pressure) throughout the lung over time [24]. The 
results of previous studies indicate that the process of 
recruitment and decruitment of lung units should be 
determined not only by pressure but also by time [25]. 
For heterogeneous lung injury, during APRV ventilation, 
the proper elevated baseline airway pressure  
(Phigh) and 
prolonged duration of  
Phigh would optimize the recruit-
ment of alveoli gradually over time, while prevention of 
overinflation, and brief release phase  
(Tlow) could permit 
only partial lung volume loss at the release phase, avoid 
cyclic alveoli collapse, and provide dynamic homogene-
ity [10]. Recent animal experiments [8–10, 21, 23] have 
also documented that the updated APRV methodologies 
attenuate lung injury, preserve surfactant protein and 
lung architecture, and improve oxygenation, resulting in 
dynamic alveolar homogeneity without any increase in 
lung stress and strain.
Additionally, during APRV, allowing moderate spon-
taneous breath level at the  
Phigh phase (providing suf-
ficient PEEP) favored lung recruitment and improved 
ventilation/perfusion matching and lung homogeneous 
aeration, while minimizing pendelluft and its associated 
injury [20, 26–28].
Hemodynamics
The hemodynamic performance and sedation require-
ment of the patients on APRV in this study are in accord-
ance with previous study findings [11, 29, 30]. APRV 
favored hemodynamic improvement and reduced seda-
tive and paralysis use, despite the higher mean airway 
pressure. Ventilation with APRV permitting spontane-
ous breaths decreased the intrathoracic pressure, thus 
improving systematic venous return and cardiovascular 
performance and reducing sedation requirement and the 
need for paralysis, which may decrease the cardiovascu-
lar depression caused by elevated airway pressures [10, 
20, 30].
Study outcomes
This study showed that the APRV group was associated 
with more days without mechanical ventilation at day 28 
and a shorter ICU stay than the LTV group. This finding

is consistent with previously published results [11], and 
possible explanations for this finding are as follows. 
Firstly, early use of APRV improved pulmonary func-
tion, such as gas exchange and respiratory compliance. 
Recent experiments have also documented that early pre-
ventative use of APRV can more effectively block ARDS 
development than LTV [9, 21]. Putensen et al. reported 
that the use of APRV in patients with ARDS after 72 h 
on pressure-control ventilation improved but did not 
restore gas exchange and lung mechanics, and prolonged 
the mechanical ventilation and ICU stay [11]. Secondly, 
APRV allows moderate spontaneous breathing, reduces 
sedation and paralysis requirements, and decreases 
the duration of mechanical ventilation [11, 20, 30, 31]. 
In the present study, respiratory therapists titrated the 
APRV settings and dosages of analgesics and sedatives to 
achieve a moderate spontaneous breath level at the  
Phigh 
phase. Our results also show that APRV was associated 
with lighter sedation, which could increase the number of 
ventilator-free days at day 28. Thirdly, in our study there 
was respiratory therapist-guided weaning protocol with 
the SBT trial in the LTV group. In the APRV group, in 
the first stage, to avoid aggressive weaning, the weaning 
process consisted of simultaneously decreasing both  
Phigh 
by 2  
cmH2O and the release rate by two frequencies/min, 
twice daily unless the patient’s cardiopulmonary function 
deteriorated. In the second stage, when patients achieved 
the criteria with a  
Phigh of 20 cmH2O on 40%  
FiO2, res-
piratory therapists also performed the weaning protocol 
with the SBT trial as in the LTV group. Two trauma pop-
ulation studies have shown that APRV may increase the 
number of ventilator days; however, the APRV settings 
were outdated, and no formal weaning protocol was used 
[13, 15]. The current primary APRV weaning process is 
based on gradual withdrawal, using an alternate decrease 
in  
Phigh by 2 cmH2O, followed by an increase in  
Thigh of 
0.5–1.0 s [15], and extubation is assessed until the criteria 
of a  
Phigh of 12  
cmH2O on 40%  
FiO2 is achieved [10, 13, 
15, 20]. However, evidence suggests that daily SBT can 
expedite weaning and reduce the duration of mechanical

ventilation as compared with gradually reducing ventila-
tor support [32].
Limitations
There are several limitations to our study. First, the study 
was not blinded, as the ventilator settings were obviously 
different. Secondly, the sample size was small. APRV has 
evolved into a highly sophisticated, physiology-driven, 
dynamic mechanical breath profile with precise settings 
[13], thus a possibility of knowledge bias by the staff was 
another limitation. However, prior to conducting our 
study, we first conducted a single-center randomized 
controlled study and found that all of the respiratory 
therapists were well trained and skillfully used this study 
protocol. Thirdly, there were more patients with coexist-
ing chronic diseases in the LTV group than in the APRV 
group (P = 0.029). Using a multivariable analysis for the 
correction of the coexisting chronic diseases difference, 
APRV was independent of increasing ventilator-free days 
at day 28. Finally, in accordance with our APRV proto-
col, in addition to nursing staff, respiratory therapists 
were able to further titrate APRV settings and dosages 
of analgesics and sedatives to achieve the target level of 
spontaneous breathing. The results of our study show 
that APRV was associated with lighter sedation, which 
could increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 
28. However, APRV still significantly increased ventila-
tor-free days at day 28 after correcting the sedation dif-
ference. Additionally, this study did not measure the 
patient–ventilator interaction. The questions of whether 
APRV permitting spontaneous breathing could promote 
the patient–ventilator synchrony and how the patient–
ventilator dyssynchrony could affect the outcome require 
further study.
Conclusions
Compared with conventional LTV, the early application 
of APRV in patients with ARDS was associated with 
better oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, 
lower plateau airway pressure, less sedation requirement, 
more ventilator-free days at day 28, and a shorter dura-
tion of ICU stay.
