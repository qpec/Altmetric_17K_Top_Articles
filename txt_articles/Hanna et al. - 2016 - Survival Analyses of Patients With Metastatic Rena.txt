Purpose
The role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has become
unclear since the introduction of targeted therapies (TT). We sought to evaluate contemporary utilization
rates of CN and to examine the survival benefit of CN compared with non-CN patients treated with TT.
Methods
We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients with clinical mRCC treated with TT between
2006 and 2013. The intervention of interest was CN. Multivariable logistic regression predicting receipt of
CN was performed. Overall survival (OS) was examined using Cox regression models and incremental
survival analyses were performed. Sensitivity analyses using propensity scores were conducted.
Results
Of 15,390 patients treated with TT, 5,374 (35%) underwent CN between 2006 and 2013. Patients
who were younger, privately insured, treated at an academic center, and had lower tumor stage and
cN0 disease were more likely to undergo CN. The median OS of CN versus non-CN patients was
17.1 (95% CI, 16.3 to 18.0 months) versus 7.7 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 7.9 months; P , .001). In
sensitivity analyses using propensity scores adjustment in addition to other available covariates, CN
patients had a lower risk of any death (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.50; P , .001). The survival
benefit of CN was +0.7 and +3.6 months in patients who survived # 6 and # 24 months, re-
spectively, versus no CN.
Conclusion
CN is performed in three of 10 patients with mRCC who are receiving TT. Several patient and
sociodemographic characteristics were associated with receipt of CN. When feasible, CN may offer
an OS benefit when combined with TT.

INTRODUCTION
Kidney cancer is among the 10 most common
cancers in the United States, with 61,560 cases di-
agnosed in 2015.1 Despite a significant migration
toward lower-stage disease as a result of the evolution
of more sophisticated imaging, three of 10 patients
present with primary metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC).2 Historically, management of patients with
mRCC included cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in
selected patients in combination with immuno-
therapy, given the results of two randomized trials
demonstrating an overall survival (OS) advantage of
5.8 months in a combined analysis study.3
Thereafter, a better understanding of mo-
lecular pathways for RCC led to the development,
testing, and approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration of several targeted therapies (TT)
at the end of 2005.4 The significant advent of TT
has blurred the role of CN in contemporary
patients diagnosed with mRCC. Recent reports
indicate declining utilization rates of CN in the
TT era.5-7 This decreasing use of CN may be
a result of the lack of randomized trials testing the
efficacy of CN in combination with TT, the
availability of systemic options, and their signif-
icant benefit. Regardless, the most up-to-date
guidelines support the role of CN with TT in
the appropriate clinical setting.8

 Given the paucity of data on this topic, we sought to examine
the utilization rates of CN in combination with TT in patients with
primary mRCC compared with TT alone. We also sought to
identify patient and sociodemographic characteristics associated
with the use of CN in combination with TT. As a secondary end
point, we examined OS rates of patients treated with TT and CN
versus TTalone. For this purpose, we relied on the National Cancer
Data Base (NCDB), which serves as a robust quality improvement
mechanism for cancer programs participating in the American
College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) approvals
program.9 Our hypothesis stated that CN use has declined over
time and that those patients who receive both CN and TT have
more favorable OS than patients who receive TT alone.
METHODS
Data Source
A joint initiative of the American College of Surgeons CoC and the
American Cancer Society, the NCDB is a national cancer registry that was
established in 1989 and serves as a comprehensive clinical surveillance
resource for cancer care in the United States. The NCDB compiles data
from . 1,500 commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States
and Puerto Rico; it captures nearly 70% of all newly diagnosed cancers.10
Study Cohort
All patients with primary mRCC at diagnosis, who were treated with
at least one TT at any time between 2006 and 2013, were identified
(International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition: C649,
8000-8980) and American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage Manual, 7th
edition.10 Receipt of TT was recorded as single- or multiagent chemo-
therapy in the NCDB, as previously reported.11
CN patients were identified using the surgery of primary site codes
(40, 50, and 70) based on the Facility Oncology Registry Standards, which
records all primary surgical treatment provided in any NCDB-affiliated
institution. Conversely, patients with surgery of primary site code 0 were
grouped as non-CN patients. We selected 2006 as the starting point, after
the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of sorafenib and
sunitinib.4 Overall, 15,390 patients with mRCC treated with TT were
identified (Fig 1).
Covariates
Patient covariates included age, sex, race, residence location, in-
surance status, annual income, and percentage of individuals without
a high school diploma in patient’s area of residency. Comorbidity status
was determined using the Charlson-Deyo classification.12 Metastasectomy
status was extracted using “Surgical Procedure of Other Sites,” which
included surgery to regional and distant lymph nodes, as well as distant
sites. In patients who underwent CN, the timing of CN with regard to TT,
when available, was also captured and categorized as CN before TT versus
CN after TT.
Provider covariates included facility type, calculated according to the
number of patients diagnosed with RCC within 1 year, and comprised
community center (100 to 500 cases), comprehensive community cancer
center (. 500 cases), and academic (. 500 cases with available graduate
medical training). Facility location was reported as New England, Atlantic,
East Central, West Central, or West Pacific. Tumor characteristics included
histology subtype based on International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, 3rd edition codes and categorized as clear cell (8000, 8005, 8310,
8312-8316, 8359), papillary (8260), chromophobe (8270, 8290, 8317),
collecting duct (8319), and sarcomatoid (8032, 8318, 8963). Fuhrman
grade was determined from a composite variable using the NCDB’s tumor
grade variable for cases diagnosed before 2010 and the Collaborative Stage
Data Collection System Site-Specific Factor 6 for cases diagnosed in 2010
or later (Fuhrman grades 1, 2, 3, 4). Clinical tumor was classified as cT1,
cT2, cT3, or cT4 and nodal stages as cN0 or cN1. Death from any cause
following mRCC diagnosis was abstracted. Follow-up duration was
recorded from the time of diagnosis until death or lost to follow-up.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline patient, provider, and tumor disease characteristics were
compared according to CN status (CN v non-CN). The t test or x2 test were
used to assess any statistical significance between the two treatment groups
for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The proportion of

Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in the Targeted Therapy Era
 patients undergoing CN was reported for each study year, and temporal
trend analysis was evaluated using the estimated annual percentage change
mixed linear regression methodology.13
First, multivariable logistic regression models for prediction of CN
were performed (n = 15,390). This was done to identify patient, socio-
demographic, and preoperative clinical characteristics associated with
receipt of CN. Second, we compared OS rates between CN versus non-CN
patients. Because follow-up and vital status information was only available
in patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2012, survival analyses were
limited to 12,995 patients (instead of 15,390). Kaplan-Meier curves were
used to depict OS rates between the two groups. Multivariable Cox re-
gression models were performed for prediction of all-cause mortality
between CN versus non-CN patients after adjusting for all of the afore-
mentioned variables. Furthermore, generalized estimating equations were
used to account for clustering of outcomes within facility, assuming an
independent correlation structure. As a result of inherent treatment se-
lection biases associated with the CN group, sensitivity analyses were
conducted by performing a weighted propensity score analysis.
Finally, in exploratory analyses, incremental survival benefits were
compared between patients who received a CN versus those who did not in
patients who survived # 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, as previously described.14
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13.1, with a two-sided
significance level set at P , .05. An institutional review board waiver was
obtained before conducting this study, in accordance with institutional
regulation when working with de-identified administrative data.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Between 2006 and 2013, 15,390 patients were treated with at
least one TT (Table 1). Overall, 5,374 (35%) underwent CN. CN
and non-CN patients differed with respect to age, baseline
comorbidities, insurance status, and median household income, as
well as facility type, tumor stage distribution, nodal stage distri-
bution, and histologic variants (all P , .001). The utilization rate
of CN remained stable between 2006 and 2013 (range, 32% to 34%;
estimated annual percentage change, +1.01%; 95% CI, 21.64% to
3.73%; P = .39).
Factors Associated With CN
In multivariable logistic regression models for prediction of
CN (N = 15,390), patients 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years or older
(odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 0.45, and 0.18; all P ,.001) and patients
with a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) $ 2 (OR = 0.74; P ,.001)
were less likely to undergo CN than their younger (, 50 years) and
CCI 0 counterparts, respectively (Table 2). Black patients were
significantly less likely to undergo CN (OR = 0.64) compared with
white patients (P ,.001). To examine if the effect of race was driven
by other covariates, interaction terms between race and CCI, in-
surance type, facility type, and cTstage were performed, in separate
models. No examined interactions were statistically significant (all
P $ .05). Furthermore, patients without insurance (OR = 0.76), as
well as those treated at community (OR = 0.61), comprehensive
community (OR = 0.72), or integrated network programs (OR =
0.79; all P # .025), were less likely to be treated with CN than
Medicare/Medicaid-insured patients and those treated at academic
centers. Finally, higher cT stage and patients with clinically node-
positive disease were also less likely to undergo CN (Table 2).
Survival Analyses
Overall, 10,882 deaths were recorded (n = 12,995 included in
survival analyses). The mean time to any death was 32.5 months
(median, 17.1 months; 95% CI, 16.3 to 18.0 months) for CN versus
14.9 months (median, 7.7 months; 95% CI, 7.4 to 7.9 months) for
non-CN. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 62.7% (95% CI,
61.3% to 64.1%), 39.1% (95% CI, 37.7% to 40.6%), and 27.7%
(95% CI, 26.3% to 29.1%) versus 34.7% (95% CI, 33.7% to
35.8%), 17.1% (95% CI, 16.2% to 17.9%), and 9.8% (95% CI,
9.1% to 10.5%) for CN and non-CN patients, respectively (log-
rank P ,.001; Fig 2). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, CN
patients had a lower risk of any death, after adjusting for all
available covariates (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.52;
P , .001; Table 3). To minimize treatment selection biases, pro-
pensity scores were adjusted in sensitivity analyses. The findings
remained virtually unchanged (Appendix Tables A1, A2, and A3,
online only).
In a subgroup analysis focusing on individuals treated ex-
clusively with CN who had available data on timing of CN and
survival (n = 4,223), 88.4% and 11.6% received CN before and
after TT, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 61.2%,
37.8%, and 26.6% for patients who underwent CN before TT
versus 73.3%, 48.1%, and 35.3% for patients who underwent CN
after TT, respectively (log-rank P , .001; Fig 3).
Incremental Benefit Analysis
An OS benefit from CN was observed in all examined survival
times (Table 4). The longer an individual survived, the greater the

 OS benefit of CN (+0.7 months in patients who survived
# 6 months versus +3.6 months in patients who survived
# 24 months). Even after adjusting for all other covariates, CN
remained statistically significantly associated with better OS out-
comes than non-CN. Moreover, the beneficial effect of CN on
mortality increased with increasing incremental OS time: HR from
0.71 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.78) in # 6 months OS to 0.62 (95% CI,
0.59 to 0.66) in # 24 months OS; all P , .001.
DISCUSSION
According to national guidelines, CN before systemic therapy is
recommended in patients with potentially surgically resectable
primary cancer.8 These recommendations are based on the
Southwest Oncology Group and European Organisation for Re-
search and Treatment of Cancer randomized trials in patients with
metastatic disease who underwent nephrectomy followed by in-
terferon therapy versus interferon alone.15,16 Although there is an
ongoing clinical trial assessing the role of CN with TT (Clinical
Trial to Assess the Importance of Nephrectomy [CARMENA]),
existing data for CN in this context have thus far been infrequently
examined. After the immunotherapy era, the question persists of
whether CN should remain an integral part of the treatment
management of patients with mRCC. The objective of the current
study was to examine contemporary utilization rates of CN in
combination with TT within a large and robust sample cohort.
Secondary and exploratory analyses include survival and in-
cremental survival benefit.
Several findings were noteworthy. First, we found that CN use
was stable between 2006 and 2012; performance of CN was rel-
atively seldom in approximately three of 10 patients with mRCC
treated with TT. Second, several of the examined patient and
sociodemographic characteristics, unrelated to the patient’s dis-
ease, were also shown to be associated with receipt of CN. For
example, black patients and Medicare/Medicaid/uninsured pa-
tients were less likely to undergo CN. Third, our results revealed

Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in the Targeted Therapy Era
 a significant OS advantage for patients receiving both CN and TT
compared with TT alone (median OS, 17.1 months; 95% CI, 16.3
to 18.0 months v 7.7 months; 95% CI, 7.4 to 7.9 months). Finally,
the survival advantage of patients who underwent surgical re-
section was not only maintained compared with non-CN patients
but significantly augmented with increasing lengths of survival
even after adjusting for all other covariates (HR from 0.71 to 0.62;
all P , .001).
The utilization trends of CN reported in the current study
contrast with those from previous reports that showed a declining
use of CN in the TTera. For example, Conti et al,6 using the SEER
database of patients with mRCC diagnosed between 1993 and
2010, found that starting in 2005, the utilization rate of CN de-
creased by 0.6% per year (annual percentage change, 21.8%).
Although our overall rates of CN are similar, a few reasons can
explain the difference found in trends. First, our cohort was
composed of only patients who received systemic therapy; hence,
trends in systemic therapy use could have influenced our results.
Additionally, we provide a more contemporary evaluation of CN
rates, and we rely on a larger sample size of CNs per year.
Although our report suggests an overall stabilization of CN
use with TT in recent years, the overall rate of CN observed in the
current study (approximately 30%) was lower than the overall rate
of CN observed in data originating from centers of excellence
(approximately 58% to 85%).14,17,18 This may be even more
worrisome, considering that the NCDB is a sample of patients
treated by cancer-accredited programs with a minimum threshold
of 100 cases per year. The obvious contrast in utilization rates of
CN with TT in the population-based versus academic setting is
disconcerting, because it may suggest underuse of CN in the
general population. This becomes even more problematic when
considering that certain patient and sociodemographic charac-
teristics (eg, race, insurance) unrelated to clinical factors were
found to be associated with receipt of CN in the current cohort.
Regarding survival analyses, the current study corroborates
the survival benefit of CN with TT compared with TT alone, as
previously reported. Using multi-institutional data from the In-
ternational Metastatic Database Consortium, Choueiri et al19
showed that CN patients had improved OS compared with
non-CN patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor
therapy (19.8 v 9.4 months; HR, 0.44; P , .01). Similarly, an
updated report from Heng et al14 showed that the median OS of
patients with mRCC treated with TT with CN versus without CN
was 20.6 versus 9.5 months, respectively (P ,.001). Other reports
relying on population-based cohorts have also suggested improved
OS in CN patients without providing actual information on the use
of TT.20-22 Therefore, the purported survival benefit of CN
compared with non-CN patients in those reports merely assumes
that patients received TT. In addition, those reports did not contain
information on comorbidities, performance status, and other
clinical variables, which may render comparative effectiveness of
the two groups substantially unfair, because patients with poor
health are unlikely to be considered for CN.
It is noteworthy that patients who underwent CN after TT had
better OS compared with those who underwent CN before TT.
That being said, caution is warranted when interpreting such
results because of the limited sample size and significant treatment
selection bias of how clinicians opted to administer TT, that is,
before or after CN. Ultimately, the results of the EORTC-30073-
GUCG trial (NCT01099423) will be better at elucidating the
question of timing of CN with respect to TT.
To our knowledge, this study is the largest sample size to date
showing that CN has an OS benefit in patients treated with TT,
while adjusting for other factors. However, careful patient selection
remains critical in determining if patients will benefit from CN.
The surgery, although safe, is associated with non-negligible
complications and perioperative mortality rates.23-25 Patients
with poor survival outcomes or those with a rapidly progressing
disease are less likely to benefit from CN. For example, Choueiri
et al19 found that patients with poor risk features (as defined
according to the International Metastatic Database Consortium
criteria) and patients with poor performance status26 did not
benefit from CN. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines endorse the preoperative risk factors identified by Culp
et al27 that are associated with the likelihood of CN benefit, in
particular for patients with lung-only metastases, good prognostic
features, and good performance status. However, this model awaits
external validation. Unfortunately, we could not assess the presence
of the identified risk factors in previous studies, which prevented us
from validating the selection criteria developed by Culp et al.27
Nonetheless, the current study may be used to remind clinicians to
adopt a rigorous selection criteria in individuals for whom systemic
therapy is planned. Finally, it is important to reiterate that the
current findings are applicable only to patients with a potentially
surgically resectable primary tumor mass who are planning to
undergo systemic therapy. The current findings do not suggest CN
for all-comers.
The current study is not without limitations. First, the ana-
lyses are retrospective in nature; this comes with an unavoidable
selection bias that is prevalent in all nonprospective, non-
randomized studies. Specific to this point, it is essential to rec-
ognize that the NCDB only includes CoC-accredited hospitals. It
may be plausible that some patients with mRCC diagnosed at
a CoC hospital then receive treatment at a non-CoC hospital,
which would be considered as non-CN according to our analyses.
Furthermore, patients diagnosed at a CoC hospital who then

Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in the Targeted Therapy Era
 Trial to Assess the Importance of Nephrectomy [CARMENA],
NCT00930033) evaluating the role of CN with sunitinib or
sunitinib alone will represent the strongest level of evidence for CN
in the TT era. However, the trial may be underpowered to detect
a true OS benefit with the availability of many systemic therapies,
a relatively small sample size of 576 patients, and an accrual period
of 10 years.28 Hence, by the time that results are available, systemic
treatment of mRCC may have evolved.
Second, the NCDB does not contain information on im-
portant preoperative laboratory variables that have been shown
to be independent prognostic factors (eg, albumin, lactate de-
hydrogenase) and performance status. Third, the database does not
provide the exact TTused (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor or
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) nor does it provide
information on lines of treatment. Fourth, we could not examine
cancer control outcomes, such as cause-specific mortality or
progression-free survival. However, OS remains a predominant
end point for comparative effectiveness studies. Fifth, we extracted
patients with metastatic disease at the time of database entry; it is
possible that some patients had undergone CN at another center
and hence represent metachronous metastatic disease.
To conclude, our findings suggest that on a population-based
level, three of 10 patients with mRCC treated with TTundergo CN.
Several patient and sociodemographic factors were associated with
receipt of CN. OS was more favorable in patients who underwent
CN and TT compared with TT alone. Careful patient selection
remains warranted.
