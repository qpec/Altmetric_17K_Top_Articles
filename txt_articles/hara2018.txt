Analysis of tissue development from multidisciplinary approaches can result in more integrative biological
findings, and can eventually allow the development of more effective bioengineering methods. In this study,
we analyzed the initial steps of mineral formation during secondary ossification of mouse femur based on
biological and bioengineering approaches. We first found that some chondrocytes burst near the mineralized
area. External factors that could trigger chondrocyte burst were then investigated. Chondrocyte burst was
shown to be modulated by mechanical and osmotic pressure. A hypotonic solution, as well as mechanical
stress, significantly induced chondrocyte burst. We further hypothesized that chondrocyte burst could be
associated with space-making for mineral expansion. In fact, ex vivo culture of femur epiphysis in hypotonic
conditions, or under mechanical pressure, enhanced mineral formation, compared to normal culture
conditions. Additionally, the effect of mechanical pressure on bone formation in vivo was investigated by
immobilization of mouse lower limbs to decrease the body pressure onto the joints. The results showed that
limb immobilization suppressed bone formation. Together, these results suggest chondrocyte burst as a
novel fate of chondrocytes, and that manipulation of chondrocyte burst with external mechano-chemical
stimuli could be an additional approach for cartilage and bone tissue engineering.

Introduction
Cartilage is an avascular tissue mainly composed of a dense
collagenous extracellular matrix, and is an essential organ for
joint movement and other vital functions, such as breathing.
Cartilage tissue is also known to have a scaffold-like function
for subsequent development of bones, such as in the case of
primary and secondary ossification centers in long bones.1 In

this context of endochondral ossification, chondrocytes secrete
several matrix proteins (e.g., type II collagen) and mineralization
factors that optimize the environment for mineralization.
Chondrocytes eventually become hypertrophic and die (e.g.,
apoptosis), and promote space for mineral expansion.
Throughout the last few decades, numerous studies have investi-
gated the cellular mechanisms of chondrogenesis, chondrocyte
maturation and hypertrophy and mineral formation.2–5 Additionally,
bioengineering techniques have been developed for manipulation
of cells and tissues for cartilage synthesis and reconstruction.6,7
Of note, these studies have indicated that mineralization occurs
inside the bioengineered cartilaginous pellets, mainly due to
chondrocyte death (e.g., apoptosis) caused by hypoxic levels in
the inner region of the cell aggregate (pellet). Therefore, bio-
engineered cartilaginous pellets have been used for analysis of
chondrogenesis, as well as chondrocyte death and bone formation.
Nevertheless, highly tunable manipulation of cartilage tissue-
associated mineralization still remains a major difficulty.
Understanding the physico-chemical and biological factors
associated with or determining chondrocyte death and subse-
quent mineral formation is crucial for further improvement in
bioengineering techniques for cartilage tissue synthesis and
reconstruction, as well as for control of bone formation or even
further bone marrow fabrication.
In this study, we first looked at the initial process of bone
formation in the secondary ossification center of mouse femur
epiphysis, in an attempt to understand the very initial events
associated with chondrocyte fate and mineral formation. We first
identified the initial minerals at post-natal day 5.5 (P5.5) by histo-
logical staining. Next, using femur epiphysis explants, we found that
chondrocytes had burst near the mineralized area. We hypothesized
that chondrocyte burst could be associated with mineral formation
and expansion; thus, we used chemico-mechanical stimuli to induce
chondrocyte burst, and to manipulate bone tissue formation inside
the femur epiphysis in ex vivo experiments.
Materials and methods
Animals
New-born Balb/c mice were used in the experiments according to
the Guidelines for Animal Research of Okayama University, under
the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama
University (OKU-2014283 and OKU-2015542). For analysis of bone
formation labeled with calcein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
mice were injected calcein (20 mg kg�1) intra-peritoneally at least
one day before euthanasia. For lower limb immobilization experi-
ments, P3 mice had the left lower limb fixed with a plastic tube
(4.5 mm diameter � 21 mm length) and a fast-acting cyanoacrylate
adhesive (Aron alpha, Toa Gosei, Tokyo, Japan). The contra-lateral
limb was used as the control group. The animals were kept in
plastic cages, with free access to water, and received standard diet.
Time-lapse imaging and chondrocyte burst analysis
For time-lapse imaging, P6 knee joints were collected, and
the dissected femur epiphysis samples were immediately cut
fronto-distally in approximately 100 mm-thick slices, and kept
in direct contact with the glass part of glass-bottom 35 mm
dishes for approximately 30 sec, at 37 1C, to allow the tissue to
attach onto the dish surface. Tissues were maintained in
DMEM/F12 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan)
containing 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Sigma),
and were observed with a 40� optical zoom lens under a
microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Tokyo, Japan), with 5% CO2 in
air, at 37 1C. Time-lapse images were then processed to generate a
movie using ImageJ software. Mounted videos were used for
qualitative and quantitative measurements of chondrocyte burst
per 0.35 � 105 mm2. Chondrocyte burst was defined as a change in
cellular membrane conformation followed by a decrease in cell
size. If there was no visible change in cell size, the cells were not
considered as burst cells.
Effect of osmotic pressure on chondrocyte burst and mineral
formation
To analyze the effect of osmotic pressure on chondrocyte burst,
hypotonic (0.5�), normal [isotonic (1�)] and hypertonic (2�)
media were obtained by serial dilution of 10� concentrated
DMEM (Sigma), with the pH adjusted to 7.5. No change in pH
was observed during the serial dilution steps. Epiphysis cartilage
slices were then incubated in each medium type, with 5% CO2 in
air, at 37 1C, under a time-lapse microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti) for
60 min. Time-lapsed images were then processed to generate a
movie using ImageJ software, and then analyzed for the number
of chondrocyte burst.
For analysis of the effect of osmotic pressure on mineral
formation after induction of chondrocyte burst, isolated P6 femur
epiphyses were incubated in PBS solutions with different osmotic
pressure (hypertonic, isotonic (normal) and hypotonic) for 24 h,
and then in the mineralization-inducing medium (DMEM/F12
supplemented with b-glycerophosphate) for an additional 2 days.
PBS with 1.37 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4�12H2O and
1.8 mM KH2PO4 was used as normal (isotonic) solution. PBS with
no NaCl and 2.74 M NaCl were used as hypotonic and hypertonic
solution, respectively. Since mineralization is highly sensitive to
the amount of mineralization associated ions (i.e., calcium and
phosphorus), DMEM with different concentrations was not used
in the mineralization-inducing experiments in order to maintain
the concentrations of mineralization-associated ions equal in the
tissue. After incubation in the mineralization-inducing medium,
samples were fixed with 4% PFA, and submitted to bone volume
analysis by microCT. Micro-CT images of the collected epiphysis
were obtained using a SkyScan 1174 compact micro-CT (SkyScan,
Aartselaar, Belgium), at a resolution of 6.4 mm. Micro-CT sections
were reconstructed to produce the final 3D images using Nrecon
and CTVol SkyScan software. Bone volume in all epiphyses
was analyzed under the same parameters using CTAn SkyScan
software.
Analysis of the effect of external mechanical pressure on
chondrocyte burst and mineral formation
First, cartilage slices approximately 100 mm in thickness were
embedded in 2% agarose gel (SeaPlaque GTG agarose, Lonza,

Basel, Switzerland), as previously described.8 Mechanical stimu-
lation of cartilage tissue explants embedded in agarose gel was
performed by inducing a deformation in the gel of 250 mm and
500 mm from the gel surface with a micromanipulator (Narishige,
Tokyo, Japan), which was fixed on the microscope stage (Nikon
Eclipse Ti). The three arms of the micromanipulator were used to
adjust the position of a 3D-printed probe for application of
horizontal pressure to the gel. The 3D printed probe was designed
with Clay Tools software (Geomagic, NC, USA), and printed in a
desktop 3D printer (Objet 24, Stratasys, Eden Prairie, MN, USA).
A rigid and opaque white polymer (VeroWhitePlus RGD835;
Stratasys) containing an acrylic monomer and an acrylate
oligomer was used as the raw material. The support material
consisted of 1,2-propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, an acrylic
monomer, and a photo-initiator (FullCure 705, Stratasys).9
Mechanical pressure was applied for exact 60 min, with pictures
taken every second. Time-lapsed images were then processed to
generate a movie using ImageJ software, and then analyzed for the
number of chondrocyte burst (Fig. S1, ESI†).
For analysis of bone formation upon mechanical pressure-
induced chondrocyte burst, a rectangle plastic dish was used as a
mold for agarose gel fabrication. The agarose sol was poured into the
mold, and before complete gelation, the entire epiphyses were
embedded in the gel. After complete gelation, plastic blocks 1 mm
in thickness were inserted in between the plastic dish wall and the
agarose gel, to induce pressure onto the epiphysis. Epiphyses were
maintained under pressure for 3 h, and then removed from the gel
and cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with b-glycerophosphate
for an additional 48 h. Bone volume was further analyzed by micro-
CT, under the same conditions described above.
Finite element analysis (FEA)
A P5 toluidine blue-stained tissue cross section was used to capture
the 2D image data (Fig. S2A, ESI†). The photograph was trimmed
(70 � 54 pixels) and preserved as an 8-bit BMP file with Photoshop
CS5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA), and the BMP file was imported into
an image processing application programmed by the authors
with FORTRAN 95 format to construct a 2D quadrilateral model
(2785 nodes and 2667 elements). The hypertrophic region was
extracted based on the brightness of each pixel (Fig. S2B, ESI†).
The compressive pressure was applied and divided on each node of
the bottom surface, and zero boundary conditions were assigned at
each node of the upper surface. FEA was conducted to solve the
linear equation, which was obtained by using the traditional virtual
work principle approach10 for the 2D quadrilateral model under
plate strain deformation, by using a method of conjugated
gradients11 programmed by the authors with FORTRAN 95 format
under the assumption that the structures were isotropic and linearly
elastic. Young’s moduli of the normal cell region and hypertrophic
cell region were assigned to 1 kPa and 10 kPa, respectively. The von
Mises stress12 distribution calculated by FEA was visualized as
shown in Fig. S2B and C (ESI†) with ParaView 4.2.0-RC1.13
Statistical analysis
Analysis of the differences between groups was performed with
unpaired Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA followed by a
Tukey post hoc correction test, when appropriate. GraphPad Prism
5 software was used for the analyses.
Results
Identification of the initial mineralization site and analysis of
time and stage-specific changes in femur epiphysis
To identify the initial mineral deposition in the cartilage
epiphysis of mouse femur, we performed histological analysis
of calcein-injected mouse femur epiphysis. The results showed
that the initial minerals were formed in the extracellular matrix
(ECM) region of the medial side of P5.5 epiphysis (Fig. 1A and
B, left panel). Subsequently, minerals expanded towards the
lateral side from P6 to P7 (Fig. 1A and B). Concomitant with
these observations in the inorganic material formation, we
could observe morphological changes in chondrocytes in a
site-specific manner. From P5, chondrocytes became hyper-
trophic and were arranged in close contact with each other,
as depicted in ESI,† Fig. 2A (medial side). Importantly, as
shown in Fig. 1B (left panels), there were no other cells involved
in the initial mineralization steps in femur epiphysis, indicating
that the early steps of mineralization (until P6) were not based on
osteoblast activity, but mainly on that of chondrocytes.
Chondrocyte burst
In an attempt to understand the process of space making for
mineral formation and expansion, we performed a time-lapse
imaging of P6 cartilage samples. Surprisingly, we found that
chondrocytes in the vicinity of the mineralized area had slowly
burst (Movie S1, ESI†). We could observe that the chondrocyte
membrane collapsed and subsequently the cell shrank during
the following seconds, with a decrease in half of total cell area
(Fig. 2A–C). Analysis of cell burst images showed an average
bursting time of 41 s (Fig. 2E). Of note, time-lapse observation
of osteoblasts from mouse embryonic calvaria, which are
involved in intramembranous ossification, did not show any
cell burst under the same conditions (data not shown).
Another observation from the time-lapse imaging was the
extracellular space formed after chondrocyte burst (Fig. 2D),
which was identical to the shape of the minerals observed in
histological sections (Fig. 1B, arrowheads in the middle lower
panel). Therefore, since hypertrophic chondrocytes were originally
in close contact with each other, a decrease in chondrocyte
volume due to chondrocyte death (burst or apoptosis14) could
promote space for mineral expansion.
Osmotic pressure triggers chondrocyte burst and enhances
mineral expansion in vitro
In order to understand the factors that could induce chondro-
cyte burst and mineral formation, we first analyzed the effect of
osmotic pressure because previous reports have shown that a
hypotonic condition induces the burst of erythrocytes,15 due to
water influx into the cells. Likewise, we maintained slices of
cartilage epiphysis in hypotonic media for 1 h and observed
chondrocyte burst by time-lapse. As shown in Fig. 3A and

Movies S2–S4 (ESI†), a hypotonic environment strongly induced
chondrocyte burst, most likely due to water influx into the
cells.15 On the other hand, we observed no chondrocyte burst in
a hypertonic condition. In normal culture medium, there was
only a few number of chondrocyte burst (Fig. 3A).
Next, in order to investigate the effect of osmotic pressure on
chondrocyte burst-associated bone formation, the entire P6
epiphyses were cultured temporarily (24 h) in PBS with different
osmotic pressure. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, there was a
significantly higher amount of bone formation in the samples
maintained in the hypotonic condition, compared to those in
the normal or hypertonic condition.
External mechanical force triggers chondrocyte burst and
modulates endochondral ossification
Secondary ossification is a process that occurs in post-natal days
and consequently under a dynamic biomechanical condition due
to the body weight pressure onto the joints under movement.
Therefore, we hypothesized that an external mechanical force
could also induce chondrocyte burst, and consequently affect
initial mineralization in the femur epiphysis. First, we performed
simulations using FEA in an attempt to understand the pressure
possibly applied onto the joints. Based on previous studies
evaluating the mechanical stiffness of chondrocytes and the
pericellular matrix, we assigned the Young’s moduli of the normal
cell region and the hypertrophic cell region to 1 kPa and 10 kPa,
respectively.16–19 FEA could then predict that the medial side is
the region where the external force is concentrated, due to its
longer anatomical shape, compared to the lateral side (Fig. S1B
and C, ESI†). These data support the notion that mechanical
loading could be an important factor associated with initial bone
formation at the medial side of femur epiphysis.
Note that the aim for using FEA was not to calculate the
accurate pressure distribution in the cartilage, but rather to
analyze whether the pressure could concentrate in the region
rich in hypertrophic cells (medial side). Therefore, a simple

elastic 2D model was used in this study. It is also worth noting
that we cannot justify even non-elastic 3D models in micro-
scopic resolution due to the lack of parameters such as Young’s
modulus, diffusion coefficient and viscosity-related parameters
of organic matrices, cell membranes and cytoplasms of normal
and hypertrophic cells.
We then performed an in vivo experiment to reduce the body
pressure onto the joints by immobilizing the lower limb with a
plastic crutch fixed with a fast-acting cyanoacrylate adhesive at
P3, before mineralization (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, we found no
bone formation in the immobilized limb at P6, while bone
development was normal in the contra-lateral control limb
(Fig. 4B and C). Accordingly, at P7, bone volume was also
decreased in the epiphysis of immobilized limbs, confirming
a direct association between mechanical pressure and initial
bone mineralization (Fig. 4D and E).
To analyze whether mechanical pressure could also induce
chondrocyte burst, we used ex vivo slices of P6 epiphysis
approximately 100 mm in thickness, and embedded the tissue
in 2% agarose gel (Fig. 5A–C). The embedded cartilage samples
were then submitted to different levels of mechanical pressure
for 1 h, using an originally designed pressure device with a
3D-printed probe (Fig. 5A–C). For calculation of the pressure to
be applied onto the epiphysis samples, the following values
were considered. The body weight of a new born mouse is
approximately 2 g (2 � 10�3 kg). Considering the gravitational
field as 9.8 m s�2 and the joint area as 0.2 cm2, the pressure
onto each joint would be (2 � 10�3 � 9.8 C 0.2 C 4 joints =
0.0245 kgf cm�2 = 2.4 kPa). The force applied onto the
epiphysis-containing gel was 0.017 N (E 2.6 kPa) and 0.031 N
(E 4.5 kPa) upon a compression of 250 mm and 500 mm,
respectively. The authors used the distance in micrometers as a
way to better control the pressure applied onto the epiphysis
samples by using the micromanipulator. The agarose gel presented
a linear elastic property under these experimental settings (Fig. 5D).
As shown in Fig. 5E, the number of chondrocyte burst increased in
a pressure-dependent manner, indicating a direct association of
mechanical stress as a trigger for chondrocyte burst.

Finally, in an attempt to confirm whether mechanical pres-
sure could be associated with mineral formation, the entire
epiphyses were embedded in agarose and submitted to different
mechanical pressures for 3 h in vitro (Fig. 6A). Afterwards, the
epiphyses were removed from the agarose gel and cultured in
b-glycerophosphate-supplemented DMEM/F12. As shown in Fig. 6B
and C, mechanical pressure significantly induced mineral for-
mation inside the epiphysis, in a pressure-dependent manner.
Taken together, these results indicate that mechanical stress
is an important factor for chondrocyte burst and for in vivo
mineral formation, suggesting that initial mineralization in the
medial side of the femur epiphysis could be associated with
mechanical stress-triggered chondrocyte burst.
Discussion
Secondary ossification of femur epiphysis in mice initiates
during the first postnatal week, and it enables detailed observa-
tion of the dynamic changes in organic and inorganic materials
in a time- and stage-specific manner. Additionally, it is unique
in that it allows the analysis of external mechanical stress of the
body weight onto the epiphysis at the very initial mineralization
stages. In other words, it enables the investigation of the effect
of biomechanical (biophysical) forces on initial bone minerali-
zation associated with biochemical and morphological changes
in chondrocytes, in the absence of osteoblasts.
A time-lapse imaging of ex vivo cartilage epiphysis samples
showed that chondrocytes go through a bursting process. Here,
we defined cell burst not as a complete destruction of the cells,
but as a shrinkage of their volume. Previous studies have
reported the chondrocyte bursting phenomenon, using mono-
layer cells20,21 or intact ex vivo cultured cartilage tissue.22 When
chondrocytes were maintained in a hypotonic environment,
there was a marked increase in chondrocyte volume without
changes in cellular dry mass, and subsequently, the cells burst,
with marked loss in dry mass.20,21 Accordingly, we herein
demonstrated that a hypotonic condition markedly induced
chondrocyte burst. Moreover, we showed that a hypotonic
condition enhanced in vitro mineral formation inside the
epiphyses.
To the authors’ knowledge, there is no study that has
measured directly the osmotic pressure of tissues during bone
development in vivo. Osmotic pressure in vivo can be supposed
to be changed by several factors, such as by the invasion of
negatively charged blood plasma proteins (e.g., albumin) in the
extracellular region. Additionally, changes in the concentration
of specific ions [e.g., calcium, phosphorus, hydrogen (pH)]
could also be factors facilitating chondrocyte burst. It is known
that cells make use of ATP-dependent ion pumps to control
their osmolality in relation to the extracellular environment.15
Therefore, the activity of ATP or ion pump levels could be
impaired or their expression levels decreased, in comparison to
other cell types. In fact, loss of activity of ATP transporters,

which affect intracellular ion concentration, is known to affect
osmotic pressure and induce cell swelling.23 Subsequently,
cell swelling could be an important phenomenon facilitating
chondrocyte burst. Interestingly, a previous study using a
single-cell photolysis experimental model showed that intra-
cellular calcium rose prior to cellular membrane lysis induced
by 632 nm laser light, and that this early rise in intracellular
calcium was necessary for cellular membrane rupture.24
Treatment of cells with the channel blockers was effective in
either decreasing or eliminating cell burst, even under lethal
doses of photosensitizer and irradiation.24 Based on this report,
we assumed that calcium could be one strong candidate factor
facilitating chondrocyte burst. Accordingly, previous studies
have demonstrated that fluid flow-induced shear stress or
mechanical stress induced an increase in intracellular calcium
possibly through mechanosensitive channels, and that these
signals could be propagated to adjacent cells through gap-
junctions.25–27 On the other hand, in vitro experiments have
shown that high phosphate levels induce an increase in the
expression of the hypertrophic chondrocyte marker, collagen
type X, and also induce chondrocyte death, when associated
with calcium.28 Thus, the dynamic changes in osmotic pressure,
in particular after blood vessel invasion into the cartilage in femur
epiphysis, after alkaline phosphatase activity inside chondrocytes
(which would increase the intracellular phosphorus levels), and
after initial calcium-phosphate formation in the extracellular
matrix, could be altogether affecting intra- and extracellular ion
concentrations and eventually could be directly or indirectly
associated with chondrocyte burst and subsequent mineral
formation.
Hypertrophic chondrocytes, which were first observed in the
medial side of P4 and P5 epiphysis, present a 5-time increase in
cell volume and also marked changes in their stiffness.16
A previous study reported that chondrocytes maintained in
hypotonic conditions also present a significant increase in
their volume, but a marked decrease in their viscoelastic
properties associated with dissociation or redistribution of
the F-actin cytoskeleton.21 In other words, osmotic pressure
could be one potential factor associated with chondrocyte
hypertrophy, and could facilitate chondrocyte burst by decreasing
its viscoelastic properties. We then assumed that mechanical
pressure could be another important factor inducing chondrocyte
burst. In fact, mechanical pressure could significantly induce
chondrocyte burst, and could also enhance mineral formation
in the epiphysis. The pressure onto the joint (epiphysis) could
induce a concentration of force in the medial side of the
epiphysis, as simulated by FEA, and this pressure could then
induce chondrocyte burst. Consequently, following the burst of
chondrocytes, there could be permanent micro-deformation of
the cartilage, which could in turn further enhance the concen-
tration of mechanical pressure on this site. Of note, not only
the anatomical morphology of the epiphysis (medial side being
longer than the lateral side), but also biochemical modifications
in hypertrophic chondrocytes, including the formation of intra-
cellular vesicles1 (Fig. S3, ESI†), could be mechanically facilitating
factors for cell burst in the medial side. Additionally, due to the
highly charged and hydrated nature of the cartilage extracellular
matrix, mechanical loading induces exudation of the interstitial
water, resulting in dynamic changes in the interstitial osmolarity.20
Therefore, both mechanical and osmotic stress could be affecting
simultaneously the chondrocytes and induce cell burst.
The present observations of chondrocyte burst may have an
impact not only on developmental biology, but also on tissue
engineering and bioengineering fields. External mechanical
forces have been pointed out as important factors for in vitro
synthesis of cartilage tissue, as these forces are known to induce
the synthesis of ECM components by chondrocytes and strengthen
the mechanical properties of the synthesized tissue.29 Never-
theless, application of intense mechanical stress to chondrocytes
may potentially induce cell burst, and a deeper knowledge of
the parameters and thresholds of the mechano-properties of
chondrocytes, such as stiffness according to their differentiation
stage (proliferative vs. hypertrophic chondrocytes), may direct
novel methods for cartilage tissue engineering. On the other
hand, mechanical stress has also been demonstrated to be an
important factor regulating osteoblast and osteocyte activity,

system to apply pressure onto the entire femur epiphyses embedded in
agarose gels. A plastic block of 1.2 mm was inserted in the rear part of the
compartment to induce deformation of the agarose gel and apply pressure
onto the epiphyses. (B and C) Quantitative analysis (B) and microCT images

in DMEM/F12 supplemented with b-glycerophosphate. Note the pressure-
dependent increase in bone formation. *p o 0.05, **p o 0.01, ***p o

consequently affecting overall bone turnover. Previous studies
have also shown that the stiffness of the surrounding micro-
environment can control bone formation during primary endo-
chondral ossification of mouse femur.2,3,8 Therefore, it may be
possible that chondrocyte burst could be one intermediate
event in these models of cartilage-to-bone formation, and mani-
pulation of external mechanical properties of the surrounding
environment could affect not only chondrocytes but also osteo-
blasts and osteocytes.
These results suggest that chondrocyte burst could be an
event to promote space making for mineral expansion. More
interestingly, chondrocyte burst could give origin to chondrocyte
membrane nanofragments, which were shown to be nucleation
sites for mineralization.30 In other words, chondrocyte death
(e.g., apoptosis, burst) could not simply be a process for space-
making, but could allow cellular components (e.g., phos-
phoproteins) to extravasate throughout the extracellular matrix,
and could give origin to cell membrane nanofragments, which
could become materials that promote mineral formation in the
initial steps of osteoblast-independent mineralization in the
femur epiphysis.30
In summary, we introduce the concept of chondrocyte burst
as a novel fate of chondrocytes associated with initial mineral
formation in femur epiphysis, and demonstrate that manipula-
tion of chondrocyte burst with external mechano-chemical
stimuli could be an additional approach for cartilage and bone
tissue engineering.
