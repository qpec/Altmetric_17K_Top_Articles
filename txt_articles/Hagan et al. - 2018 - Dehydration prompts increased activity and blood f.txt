Current insights into the mosquito dehydration response rely on studies that examine specific 
responses but ultimately fail to provide an encompassing view of mosquito biology. Here, we examined 
underlying changes in the biology of mosquitoes associated with dehydration. Specifically, we show 
that dehydration increases blood feeding in the northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens, which was 
the result of both higher activity and a greater tendency to land on a host. Similar observations were 
noted for Aedes aegypti and Anopheles quadrimaculatus. RNA-seq and metabolome analyses in C. 
pipiens following dehydration revealed that factors associated with carbohydrate metabolism are 
altered, specifically the breakdown of trehalose. Suppression of trehalose breakdown in C. pipiens 
by RNA interference reduced phenotypes associated with lower hydration levels. Lastly, mesocosm 
studies for C. pipiens confirmed that dehydrated mosquitoes were more likely to host feed under 
ecologically relevant conditions. Disease modeling indicates dehydration bouts will likely enhance viral 
transmission. This dehydration-induced increase in blood feeding is therefore likely to occur regularly 
and intensify during periods when availability of water is low.
Dehydration represents a significant factor that impacts the geographical distribution, reproductive capacity, and 
longevity of terrestrial arthropods1–4. With more, and extended, periods of drought predicted to occur as climate 
change progresses5,6, the ability to tolerate bouts of dehydration is becoming increasingly critical to insect survival. 
Water loss for terrestrial invertebrates occurs through excretion, respiratory gas exchange, and cuticle transpira-
tion7,8. Insects residing in dry environments significantly minimize water loss through mechanisms that suppress 
rates of cuticular water loss, reduce excretion, and behaviorally by retreating into more favorable microhabitats8,9. 
If water balance cannot be maintained, a complement of mechanisms is employed to prevent damage from osmotic 
stress. These changes include increased expression of heat shock proteins3,8,10,11, shifts in osmoprotectant metab-
olites10–13, and differential regulation of aquaporins to alter the movement of water between the hemolymph and 
intracellular components14–16. Along with these physiological responses, dehydration will prompt moisture-seeking 
behavior in many insects as a means to increase the likelihood of liquid ingestion and reduce water loss3,17,18.
Dehydration resistance in mosquitoes is a significant factor in determining their ability to expand to new regions 
and also dictates their survival under periods of low water availability7,19–23. For mosquitoes that act as malaria vec-
tors, recent studies have examined molecular and physiological changes associated with dehydration or dry-season 
conditions22–24. Rearing Anopheles gambiae under dry season conditions shifted levels of specific metabolites (amino 
acids and carbohydrates), suppressed reproduction, reduced spiracle size, and reduced heart contraction rate21–27. 
Microarray analyses of dehydrated A. gambiae revealed increased expression of genes associated with stress response

and DNA repair24. Rehydration in mosquitoes can be achieved through three main routes: ingestion of free water, 
nectar feeding, and hematophagy19. For select mosquito species, specifically two of the most important disease vec-
tors, A. gambiae and A. aegytpi, individuals will forgo nectar feeding and imbibe multiple bloodmeals during each 
gonotrophic cycle28–30. Importantly, these approaches to nectar or blood feeding can vary greatly between species 
and strains of mosquitoes28–30. However, even species that have a preference for blood feeding will ingest nectar31, 
suggesting the potential for rehydration through sugar feeding for all species. Although previous studies have iden-
tified many interesting aspects associated with the dynamics between dehydration and mosquito physiology, none 
have examined the effects of dehydration bouts on mosquito biology using integrative studies that range from behav-
ior to utilization of RNA interference techniques to assess specific phenotypic changes.
In this study, we examined the effect of hydration status on the physiology and behavior of mosquitoes via 
RNA-seq analyses along with blood feeding, host landing, and physiological assays. Our hypothesis is that dehy-
dration will alter metabolism, shift activity, and increase levels of blood feeding for the northern house mos-
quito, Culex pipiens. We found that short periods of dehydration prompted an increase in transcript levels of 
genes associated with carbohydrate catabolism, increased activity, promoted mosquito host landing, and elevated 
blood feeding. Offering a source of drinking water under dry conditions or rehydration following dehydration 
suppressed these phenotypic changes, suggesting that dehydration, rather than exposure to low relative humidity 
(RH), prompts the observed phenotypes. Similar results for select experiments were noted for two other mos-
quito species, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles quadrimaculatus, suggesting that these findings are generalizable 
across mosquito species in both the Culicinae and Anophelinae subfamilies. Mesocosm-based studies indicated 
that hydration status impacts blood feeding phenotypes under field conditions even if free water sources are 
available. Furthermore, modeling of our findings provide support to the hypothesis that increased blood feed-
ing, due to dehydration, will potentially increase disease transmission. Our study indicates that bouts of dehy-
dration, either induced by dry conditions, mosquitoes not ingesting nectar or water, or a combination of both, 
alters the physiology and subsequent behavior of mosquitoes in a manner that has significant implications for 
mosquito-environment-blood feeding dynamics.
Results
Shifts in activity and blood feeding after dehydration stress. 
During initial dehydration experi-
ments, we observed that desiccated C. pipiens females appeared more active compared to control, non-dehydrated 
counterparts. Total activity for C. pipiens females was assessed under dehydrating (72–78% RH, referred to as 75% 
RH) and non-dehydrating (96–100% RH, referred to as 100% RH, or 75% RH with access to free water) condi-
tions. Exposure to dehydration significantly increased activity after 28–30 hours (~15–20% water loss, Fig. S1), 
 
and activity levels were maintained until dehydration-induced mortality occurred at a loss of ~35% water con-
tent (Fig. 1A). An additional control where water was present at 75% RH, but mosquitoes were prevented from 
drinking, showed that resting near the water source only delayed dehydration. Importantly, water content of mos-
quitoes held at 100% RH and 75% RH with access to free water were similar to those collected from the colony 
and previous studies8, suggesting that hyper-hydration does not under occur under our treatments (Fig. S2). This 
indicates that retreat to a high RH refuge will only delay and likely extend dehydration-induced phenotypes over 
a longer timeframe (Fig. S2). Thus, significantly increased activity will occur for ~12–15 hours, or even longer if 
relative humidity is slightly higher, prior to dehydration-induced mortality.
In conjunction with increased activity, the propensity of mosquitoes to land on a host mimic increased nearly 
two-fold at a loss of ~10% water content and 4- to 5-fold after losing ~15–20% of water content at 75% RH, but not 
when held under non-dehydrating conditions (100% RH) or at 75% RH with access to liquid water for ingestion 
(Fig. 1B). This indicates that dehydration stress, not dry conditions, is responsible for the observed phenotypes. 
Comparative studies using A. aegypti and A. quadrimaculatus, confirmed that dehydration-induced increases in 
both activity and host landing are likely a general response across diverse mosquito species (Fig. S1–S3). Lastly, 
the propensity of C. pipiens to ingest a bloodmeal increased significantly after a 10–15% decrease in water content 
(~15% of female feeding) and was the highest when water loss was 20–30% (~30% of females feeding; Fig. 1C). 
The baseline proportion of mosquitoes that would blood feed was ~5% before dehydration stress and remained at 
this level when mosquitoes were held at hydrating conditions.
When temperature and relative humidity were examined in relation to dehydration levels, the dehydration 
threshold of 10% and 20% water loss for C. pipiens females can be reached within as little as three to four or six 
to eight hours, respectively, at low (Fig. 1D), but ecologically relevant, RHs (60–80%) and summer temperatures 
(26–28 °C) common within the Midwestern United States. These results indicate that dehydration bouts increase 
the propensity of females to ingest a bloodmeal and this impact can be exacerbated by temperature and RH 
dynamics that will occur under ecologically relevant conditions.
Transcriptional and metabolomic changes associated with C. pipiens dehydration. 
To inves-
tigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the dehydration-induced phenotype, we utilized a combined 
RNA-seq and metabolomic approach in C. pipiens females. Dehydration exposure (15–20% loss of water) yielded 
over 1200 genes with differential transcript levels compared to fully hydrated individuals, a subset of which 
was validated through quantitative PCR (Fig. 2A, Fig. S4, Table S1). This gene set showed enrichment of Gene 
Ontology terms associated with carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 2B, Table S2). Metabolomic analyses revealed a 
substantial increase in the levels of glucose during dehydration stress, supporting our RNA-seq data (Fig. 2C). 
Trehalose content declined by over 60% and is likely the source of the increase in glucose. Of interest, nearly 
half the glucose generated by the breakdown of trehalose is likely metabolized since the conversion noted here 
is only 1:1 rather than 2:1 as expected. These results indicate that altered carbohydrate metabolism, specifically 
the breakdown of trehalose to glucose, may underlie the phenotypic changes following dehydration in C. pipiens.

Trehalose levels during dehydration and suppression of trehalose metabolism. 
Previous studies 
indicated that slow dehydration induces more pronounced physiological and behavioral responses, when com-
pared to rapid dehydration11. Similar to these metabolomic studies, glucose increased and trehalose decreased in 
C. pipiens females following dehydration exposure when measured with spectrophotometric assays (Fig. 3). The 
increase of glucose and decrease of trehalose was slightly augmented under slow dehydration (75% vs. 0% RH), 
suggesting that the rate of dehydration has a substantial impact on dehydration-induced phenotypes (Fig. 3). 
Glycogen levels in response to dehydration were examined since this reserve serves as a major source of trehalose 
(Fig. S5). We noted differences between control and dehydrated mosquitoes under slow dehydration (75% RH), 
which had a significant, albeit slight, decline in glycogen (Fig. S5). Mosquitoes held under dehydrating conditions 
with access to free water showed no reduction in glycogen levels compared to those that experienced dehydration 
stress without water (Fig. S5). Starvation is not likely serving as a major factor for our observed phenotypes in 
C. pipiens females since mosquitoes held at higher relative humidity, or allowed access to free water, survive for 
nearly four to five days before starvation-induced death (p < 0.0001, log-rank test; Fig. S6). These results suggest 
that a bout of dehydration alters trehalose and glycogen metabolism, thus generating increased levels of glucose. 
This phenotype is augmented when dehydration occurs at a slower rate.
To link metabolism of trehalose with shifts in blood feeding, we utilized RNA interference to suppress the 
levels of trehalase, the enzyme involved in the conversion of trehalose to glucose, during the course of dehydration 
in C. pipiens female. dsRNA injection targeting trehalase in adult females resulted in nearly an 80% reduction in 
transcript levels and 53% lower trehalase activity compared to control mosquitoes (Fig. 4A–C). trehalase transcript 
levels recovered 25 days after dsRNA injection (Fig. 4A). When trehalose and glucose were measured following 
trehalase knockdown, there was a slight, non-significant trehalose decrease and glucose increase following dehy-
dration stress (Fig. 4B). This lack of trehalose to glucose conversion after trehalase suppression was in stark contrast

to shifts in trehalose and glucose observed when mosquitoes were injected with dsRNA targeting green fluorescent 
protein (gfp) or when the impact of dsRNA targeting trehalase dissipated after 25 days (Fig. 4B). The proportion 
of mosquitoes that landed on a host mimic following dehydration was reduced by over 50% after knockdown of 
trehalase and the response was partially recovered 25 days after dsRNA injection (Fig. 4D). Similarly, increased 
blood feeding in dehydrated mosquitoes was suppressed following knockdown of trehalase and recovered once 
the dsRNA effects began to decline after 25 days (Fig. 4E). Thus, the inhibition of trehalose to glucose conversion 
during dehydration inhibits the dehydration-induced phenotype of increased host interactions.
Laboratory- and field-based analyses of hydration status and blood-feeding dynamics. 
To 
assess if dehydration status impacted blood feeding under field conditions, we designed a mesocosm-based study 
to assess the water content of the C. pipiens females attempting to feed on a host mimic. In addition, we examined 
if mosquitoes held under optimal laboratory conditions would have altered hydration levels in relation to blood 
feeding. Females were allowed to emerge within an outdoor mesh-enclosed mesocosm or cages within the labo-
ratory and were provided free access to water and sugar. After eight-twelve days, mosquitoes were provided access 
to an artificial host and mosquitoes that landed and probed over the first 60 minutes were collected. In addition, 
we collected ~10–20 mosquitoes at the completion of the experiments that did not respond to the host mimic. 
For the field mesocosm experiments, we performed these studies under two specific weather conditions related 
to water availability; precipitation had or had not occurred in the last 24 hours. Dry periods yielded a vapor sat-
uration deficit, difference between moisture in the air and amount in air if saturated with water, nearly five- to 
six-fold higher when compared to periods where rain occurred in the last 24 hours (Fig. S7–S8). Mosquitoes that 
landed more frequently on a host mimic had reduced water content in comparison to those that did not respond 
to the host mimic in the laboratory assays and field mesocosms (Fig. 5A). The effect of hydration status on host 
landing was exacerbated if the preceding 24 hours were dry (Fig. 5A). When examined under similar conditions 
within the lab, mosquitoes that landed on the host had lower water content compared to those that did not land 
on a host mimic (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that our laboratory-based studies related to mosquito dehy-
dration exposure are likely to occur under ecological conditions. Importantly, the presence of a sugar and water 
resource did not fully abate dehydration in mosquitoes, suggesting that even with the presence of fluids a subset 
of mosquitoes may fail to ingest sugar or water and still be dehydrated.
Disease modeling based upon increased blood feeding during dehydration. 
Lastly, to determine if 
the increased propensity to blood feed yields the potential to prompt higher disease transmission of West Nile virus 
(WNV), we incorporated the impact of short dehydration bouts into a disease transmission model (Supplemental

Materials 1). The northern house mosquito is a common vector for WNV, a flavivirus, throughout North America 
and Europe32,33. We identified that the biting rate on humans is the most sensitive parameter for our baseline model 
output, cumulated human infections (Fig. S9). Our previously described results indicated that blood feeding rate of 
C. pipiens increased following dehydration (Fig. 1), which we subsequently confirmed under different dehydration 
and rehydration protocols (Fig. S10), which allowed comparable blood-feeding rates for dehydration, control, and 
rehydrated mosquitoes. Blood-feeding rates were converted to a biting rate based on previous studies32–34. With 
these varying biting rates, we developed four models that incorporate the increased biting rate due to daily dehy-
dration, multiple bouts of dehydration, dehydration in relation to seasonal changes, and the impact of multiple 
seasons into the potential transmission of WNV (Figs 5C; and S11). Importantly, these models featured dehydra-
tion rates based on RH that C. pipiens are likely to experience in based on conditions recorded near Cincinnati, 
OH (Figs S7–S8). Under all models, dehydration bouts yielded gradual increases in disease transmission with the 
largest increase in potential disease transmission after a prolonged period (10 hours) of dehydration.
Discussion
Mosquitoes must contend with a variety of environmental conditions and dehydration acts as a critical factor in 
their distribution and survival20. This study revealed that bouts of dehydration alter the physiology and behavior 
of mosquitoes, yielding an increased level of blood feeding, when compared to fully hydrated individuals. This 
shift in activity and biting rate will likely manifest itself with an increase in the transmission of mosquito-borne 
diseases following periods of dry conditions. Molecularly, we have provided evidence for the essential role that 
the breakdown of trehalose into glucose plays in promoting the dehydration-induced phenotype in mosqui-
toes. Importantly, dehydration-induced phenotypes occur even when mosquitoes have access to sugar and water 
resources. Specifically, not all females ingest water or nectar often enough to remain fully hydrated and 10% water 
loss could likely occur within a few hours to induce phenotypic changes. Taken together, these findings indicate

that hydration levels can drastically shift mosquito phenotypes and this needs to be accounted for in studies that 
assess potential disease transmission.
A few studies have assessed metabolomic or transcriptomic changes related to mosquito dehydration21–23. 
In specific, there was an increase in glucose levels following dehydration in A. gambiae females after dehydra-
tion22, which was similar to the glucose increase seen in this study. Fluctuations in sugars and polyols have been 
documented in many insect systems12,35,36, which have been suggested to prevent additional body water loss and 
yield a reduction in potentially damaging interactions among biological molecules. Along with the conversion 
of trehalose to glucose, we noted a significant, albeit small, decline in glycogen following prolonged dehydration, 
which yields four to five units of water for each glycogen molecule metabolized37. This information indicates that 
increased glucose levels are a common physiological response following dehydration for mosquitoes and may 
occur in many other insect systems.
Outside of a potential protective role, there has not been any other role established for this glucose shift 
during dehydration. Here we show that suppression of metabolic pathways necessary to generate glucose pre-
vented dehydration-induced behaviors. Increased host landing and blood feeding following dehydration are sub-
sequently recovered once the temporal effects of dsRNA targeting trehalase have faded. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that increased carbohydrate oxidation, along with elevated levels of constituents of the TCA cycle, 
are critical in providing fuel for wing muscles during flight38–40. In A. gambiae, increased expression of genes 
associated with glycogenolytic processes have been documented when mosquitoes are exposed to dry season 
conditions22, which is comparable to our observed results in C. pipiens. Of importance, we utilized RNA-seq/
metabolomic examination of whole mosquitoes, and more directed studies on specific tissues may yield more 
precise changes. In specific, our study may have masked even more drastic differences within specific tissues.

hoc analysis where appropriate. 5d and 25d are periods following injection of dsRNA. Control, mosquitoes held

Nonetheless, whole body RNA-seq combined with the metabolomics indicates a significant shift in carbohydrate 
metabolism during the course of dehydration. This suggests that the increased sugar and amino acids may act 
beyond their roles in protection from stress and liberation of free water to potentially serve as an energy source. 
Such utilization of these nutrient stores would support behavioral shifts that could increase blood feeding as a 
source of water.
The rate of dehydration is influenced by both the temperature and relative humidity, where low RH and high 
temperature yield the highest water loss rates. Under conditions that induce dehydration rapidly (33% RH, 35 °C), 
water loss reaches a critical threshold of 10% within ~4 hours and under less severe conditions (75% RH, 25 °C) 
this threshold takes ~12–24 hours to reach. Based on weather patterns that we observed in this study, conditions 
necessary to increase blood feeding could potentially happen daily when precipitation is low. Importantly, the most 
drastic effects on glucose concentration, activity, and blood feeding occurred at a slower rate of dehydration and 
can occur after only a 10% water loss. This suggests that the findings from this study are ecologically relevant, and 
critical in the analysis of the dehydration-induced phenotypes in mosquitoes. Even if mosquitoes retreat to more 
favorable microhabitats9, it is likely that dehydration will still play a role in blood feeding if no liquid water is avail-
able to drink. This retreat is likely mimicked by activity changes observed when mosquitoes were held at 75% RH 
when water was present, but water ingestion was not possible. These favorable microhabitats will only partially sup-
press, and likely extend, dehydration-induced phenotypes unless liquid water or nectar is available for ingestion.

Of particular interest is that we show that the water content of mosquitoes landing on a host mimic is lower 
than those not landing based on both mesocosm and laboratory studies. This occurred despite mosquitoes 
having access to both sugar and water sources, which should allow individuals to remain hydrated and abate 
dehydration-induced phenotypes. This is likely due to hydration levels of mosquitoes that are not uniform (dif-
ference of 10–15%), even under stable laboratory conditions with free access to liquids. Indeed, the water content 
of female C. pipiens, although when averaged was ~65%, varied from 56–67% within our colonies (this study,19). 
Thus, individual mosquitoes, even with access to water resources, may have 10–15% lower water content than 
other conspecifics. The importance of demonstrating that hydration levels can alter host landing under stable, 
rather than drought-like, laboratory conditions is that dehydration-induced phenotypes may not require a dis-
tinct dry period. Instead, drought periods will only exacerbate shifts in phenotypes associated with dehydration, 
such as increased activity and blood feeding.
Along with the utilization of a bloodmeal or water for rehydration, nectar represents a major source of 
water that could be utilized by mosquitoes to remain hydrated41,42. Even though nectar consumption during 
periods of drought would likely occur, its availability also declines during periods of low water availability43–45. 
These conditions are likely to be exacerbated by climate change46. This suggests that nectar, similar to free water 
sources, may not be as readily available under drought conditions43–45. Furthermore, even without extended 
drought periods, mosquitoes likely fail to utilize sugar and water resources over short periods, which will yield 
dehydration-induced phenotypes of increased blood feeding. This failure to ingest fluid is likely the case as our 
field mesocosm and laboratory studies showed that the subset of mosquitoes that host landed were more dehy-
drated than those remaining off host, despite free access to sugar and water.
The increased host landing and blood feeding following dehydration is one of the most intriguing results from 
this study. Increased levels of general activity are likely a major contributing factor to the higher propensity to 
interact with a host, but there could be other underlying mechanisms. In specific, we demonstrated that dehy-
drated mosquitoes are more likely to land on a warm host mimic. Location of a host is accomplished through 
mechanisms that integrate multiple sensory cues to locate, land, and probe a host47–51. Our host mimic does not 
generate increased CO2, rather only increased heat in conjunction with basic components of perspiration and 
increased local relative humidity. This suggests that there are multiple potential sensory mechanisms that could 
be tuned in mosquitoes by dehydration, including increased temperature detection52, humidity detection17,47,53, 
host volatile detection47–51, or a combination of thermal-humidity-host cue dynamics. Thus, detection thresholds 
for sensory cues will need to be examined more in-depth following bouts of dehydration in mosquitoes.
Our modeling studies suggest that periods of dehydration are likely to impact the transmission of WNV based 
on increased blood-feeding rates. Although our increased transmission rates are minimal (~20–30 news cases 
per year within a specific area), this would present nearly three- to four-fold more cases in most states within the 
United States based upon cases reported to the CDC54. Of importance, our analyses only took into account altered 
blood feeding, excluding other factors such as impact on survival, longevity, and reproduction that could shift as 
a result of dehydration bouts1,42,55,56. Viral development and general vector competence of mosquitoes might be 
altered by the hydration status, similar to temperature57–59. Future studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the 
impact of mosquito dehydration on viral transmission based upon the combination of increased mosquito blood 
feeding during dehydration along with other altered biological parameters.
In conclusion, bouts of dehydration alter carbohydrate metabolism, which likely supports shifts in mosquito 
activity and prompts increased blood feeding. This blood feeding is not the direct result of starvation, but likely 
serves as a mechanism for immediate rehydration. Under dry periods it is likely that rehydration through host 
feeding could be more feasible than ingestion of freestanding water or nectar, since temporal water pools may be 
difficult to locate in some environments and nectar production is reduced. This increased propensity of blood 
feeding will likely increase the potential for disease transmission, due to a higher biting rate under dry periods 
with low precipitation. Recent studies have indicated that the transmission rates of West Nile virus are impacted 
by dry periods, where drought has been identified as one of the most critical factors underlying WNV out-
breaks60–65. Specifically, there have been four mechanisms where dehydrating conditions have been suggested to 
impact disease transmission dynamics. First, periods of drought likely bring mosquitoes and wild animals in close 
contact due to the scarcity of water sources66. Second, dry conditions will concentrate nutrients in water pools61,62, 
providing the resources necessary for larval development. Third, periodic drying will suppress the levels of pred-
ators and other competitors and allow mosquitoes to proliferate67. Fourth, lack of rain will allow for water to 
pool in storm drains68, which yield temporal water pools for mosquito development. In this study, we establish a 
fifth major dehydration-induced factor that will impact disease transmission, where bouts of dehydration impact 
the physiology and behavior of mosquitoes prompting increased blood feeding. This shifted biting rate, due to 
dehydration, needs to be accounted for in studies that seek to predict the prevalence and potential outbreaks of 
mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile, Zika, or Dengue viruses.

Mosquito husbandry. 
Mosquitoes were maintained in a climate-controlled facility at the University of 
Cincinnati. Ambient temperature was held between 24–28 °C and relative humidity (RH) was held between 
70–80%. A 12–12 h light-dark photoperiod was maintained for the duration of the experiment. For each species, 
eggs were harvested after oviposition. Post-emergence, larvae were separated into tanks of 75–85 individuals per 
0.5 L water to control for density during maturation. Larvae were fed finely ground fish food (Tetramin, Goldfish 
Flakes) with added yeast extract (Difco, BD 210929). Adults were kept in 12″
 x 12″
 x 12″
 mesh cages with unre-
stricted access to clean water and a 10% sucrose solution. Females were used in all subsequent experiments and 
were 10–14 days post emergence. Three species were used in this study: Aedes aegypti Benzon, Culex pipiens 
Buckeye69, and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Benzon. The colony of C. pipiens was establish in 2000 from mosqui-
toes collected in Columbus, OH, supplemented with new field collections in 2008 and 2012 to maintain the ability

to undergo diapause, and maintained at the University of Cincinnati since 2014. The A. aegypti and A. quadrimac-
ulatus were acquired from Benzon Research (Carlisle, PA, USA). The strains of A. aegypti and A. quadrimaculatus 
originated from a colony in Gainesville, FL, USA in 1993 and 2001, respectively.
Dehydration experiments. 
Mosquitoes were dehydrated by placing groups of 20 mosquitoes in a 50 ml 
centrifuge tube covered with mesh. These tubes were placed at 0% RH or 75% RH and removed after either 
10–15% water loss (17–19 hours at 75% RH or 4–6 hours at 0% RH) or 20–25% water loss (35–37 hours at 75% 
RH or 9–11 hours at 0% RH). Control mosquitoes were either held at 100% RH (generated with deionized water) 
or exposed to dehydrating conditions (75% RH, generated with saturated NaCl solutions) and allowed access to 
free water to remain fully hydrated. In addition, a subset of dehydrated mosquitoes were moved to 100% RH with 
access to free water to determine if the phenotypes induced by dehydration could be reversed when water content 
was recovered. A schematic of the dehydration experiment is included as Figure S12. This allowed comparisons 
among dehydrated, fully hydrated, and fully hydrated under dehydrating conditions to elucidate the effect of body 
water content reduction versus exposure to dehydrating conditions, which has been lacking in other studies on 
the response of arthropods to dehydration.
RNA-seq and metabolomic analyses. 
RNA-seq analyses were conducted on dehydrated (20% loss) and 
fully hydrated mosquitoes. RNA was extracted with Trizol, treated to remove DNA, and cleaned based upon 
manufacturers’ methods (Invitrogen, 15596018; Qiagen, 74104). Two independent biological libraries were pre-
pared and sequencing was conducted at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center DNA Sequencing 
and Genotyping Core. Reads were mapped to predicted genes from the Culex quinquefasciatus genome (Gene 
set version 2.1) set using CLC Genomics (CLC Bio) based upon methods used in Benoit et al.70 and Rosendale 
et al.36. Differentially expressed genes were determined using transcripts per million (TPM) with P values cor-
rected using the Bonferroni method to reduce false discovery. Gene Ontology (GO) terms were identified with 
Blast2GO71 and g:Profiler72. Specific KEGG pathways were examined for enrichment through the use of Gene 
Set Enrichement Analyses (GSEA)73,74. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was utilized to validate differences in tran-
script abundance and conducted according to previous studies36 and described in the supplemental materials 
(Supplemental materials 1; Table S3). RNA-seq data sets have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive 
(Bioproject PRJNA418113).
Metabolomics were conducted on mosquitoes after 18–20 hours of dehydration at 75% RH (Dehydrated) 
or 100% RH (Control) according to methods used by Rosendale et al.36. Briefly, mosquitoes were collected and 
dried at 0% RH and 50 °C for five to seven days (no daily changes in mass noted) to establish the dry mass, which 
was used to standardize each sample. Eight replicates of 30 to 40 mosquitoes were collected and analyzed for the 
control and dehydrated samples.
Gene knockdown. 
trehalase levels were suppressed through the use of dsRNA injection (1.0–1.5 µg/µl), 
which was generated and injected according to methods developed previously10,75. CO2-anesthetized females were 
treated at 3 days post-emergence by injection into the thorax with a pulled glass capillary needle. Knockdown was 
validated through the use of qPCR36 and a trehalase activity assay76,77. Specific details of the modeling are included 
in the supplemental information (Supplemental Materials 1).
Survival analyses. 
Mosquito survival assays were conducted to determine the time until death. Three con-
ditions were examined; dehydration, dehydration-inducing conditions with access to free water, and exposure to 
high RH (100% RH) under similar conditions as listed above for the dehydration experiments. Mosquito death 
was determined when mosquitoes failed to respond to stimulus and move. Differences in survival were assessed 
based on the LD50 determined with a Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (JMP, SAS software). Three groups of 50 
mosquitoes were used for each treatment.
Nutrient reserves. 
Levels of mosquito nutrient reserves were measured using spectophotometric methods 
on a Bioteck microplate reader (Synergy HT) according to previous studies1,31,78–80. Briefly, mosquitoes were killed 
by moving treatment tubes to −
70 °C. Three mosquitoes were combined and homogenized (6.50 m/s for 10 cycles 
with 5 sec break between cycles) with the use of a bead blaster in 250 µl of 2.0% Na2SO4. Soluble sugars were 
extracted using a 1:1 chloroform/methanol mixture. Glycogen was quantified with an anthrone (Sigma-Aldrich, 
319899) assay79. Trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich, T9531) and glucose (Sigma-Aldrichm GAHK20) assays were con-
ducted as described in Liu et al.75 Dry masses were determined for each group with no significant differences 
noted at 0, 18, or 36 h.
Landing and blood-feeding assays. 
The number of mosquitoes that landed on the host was determined 
based on techniques modified from Barnard et al.81. Mosquitoes (20–30) were released into a 60 ×
 60 ×
 60 cm 
cage (Bugdorm, BD6S610) and allowed two hours to equilibrate. An artificial host (Hemotek) was covered three 
times with Parafilm, filled with water, coated with 100 µl artificial eccrine perspiration (Pickering, 1700–0022), 
heated to 37 °C, and attached to the top of the cage. Mosquitoes that landed and remained on the artificial host for 
at least 5 seconds were used to differentiate incidental contact from exploratory (foraging) contact. The number 
of mosquitoes making foraging contact was counted at five-minute intervals for 60 minutes. A subset of landing 
assays were conducted in a blinded fashion, where the individual counting landing events did not know the 
hydration status of the mosquitoes to ensure a lack of bias. Blood feeding was measured using the same apparatus 
and setup except the Parafilm was pulled thin to allow successful probing and the feeding disk was filled with cit-
rated chicken blood (Pel-Freez, 33130-1). Relative water loss was determined for a subset of mosquitoes (N = 10) 
prior to blood-feeding assay to determine level of dehydration.

Activity assays. 
General activity of mosquitoes was assessed using a Locomotor Activity Monitor 25 (LAM25) 
system (TriKinetics, Waltham, MA) based on methods previously developed for mosquitoes82. Briefly, females 
7–10 days post-emergence (mated, but not blood fed) were moved into 25 ×
 150 mm clear glass tubes. Flight activ-
ity was recorded as the number of times a mosquito passed across an infrared beam. All recordings were conducted 
under continual light cycles to prevent confounding effects of light:dark transition on the dehydration response, 
which has been noted in other studies82,83. Four groups were analyzed: mosquitoes held under 75% RH (dehy-
drated), those held at 100% RH (fully hydrated), mosquitoes at 75% RH with access to free water (fully hydrated, 
but exposed to dehydration-inducing conditions), and lastly mosquitoes at 75% RH featuring the apparatus for 
free water that is blocked to free drinking (dehydrated with presence of free water, but ingestion is not possible).
Lab colony and field-based mesocosm studies on hydration status of blood-feeding mosqui-
toes. 
To determine if baseline differences in hydration can drive mosquito feeding, we examined if there 
is a difference in the hydration status of individuals that blood feed under laboratory or semi-field conditions 
(mesocosm studies). For field-based studies, lab-reared mosquitoes were released into a 6′
 x 6′
 x 6′
 mesh-covered 
cage (Bioquip, 1406 C) at the University of Cincinnati Center for Field Studies (39.2849 N, 84.741 W). Water 
and 10% sucrose solution were provided ad libitum and changed every two days with the last change occur-
ring 24 hours before the testing. A host mimic as previously described was introduced in the evening and mos-
quitoes that landed on the host mimic were collected and immediately frozen. Conditions where precipitation 
occured in the preceding 24 hours were required for a wet period. In addition, eight to ten mosquitoes that did 
not land of the host mimic were collected. Water content of these mosquitoes was determined according to Benoit 
and Denlinger19. For laboratory studies, the host mimic was added to a small lab colony (~50 mosquitoes) and 
mosquitoes that did or did not land on the host mimic were collected. Specific details on mesocosm design 
and weather conditions along with the laboratory colony assays are included in the supplemental information 
(Supplemental Materials 1).
Modeling of disease transmission. 
Modeling of WNV transmission was developed based on previous 
studies32–34. We applied sensitivity analysis on our model and identified important parameters that dominated our 
model output. We modified the biting rates under each model based upon proportional changes in blood-feeding 
that examined the impact of dehydration, dehydration with access to water, and those experiencing no dehydra-
tion stress on blood feeding (Fig. S9). Specific details of the modeling are included in the supplemental informa-
tion (Supplemental Materials 1).
Statistics and replication. 
Replicates throughout the experiments are biologically independent and dis-
tinct samples. Sample sizes are listed in the methods section or the appropriate figure legend. Statistical signifi-
cance between treatments and controls is indicated within each figure and/or in the figure legend. Statistical tests 
are listed within the respective figure legends. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 11 (SAS) 
or R-based packages (R version 3.1.2).
