Context: Little is known about the association between obesity and temporal trends in the incidence of
diabetes in children and young adults.
Objective: We examined the recent incidence of types 1 and 2 diabetes in relation to a high body mass
index (BMI) in UK children and young adults.
Design: Cohort and nested case-control.
Setting: A total of 375 general practices that contribute to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink
(CPRD).
Participants: A total of 369,362 participants aged 2 to 15 years at BMI measurement in CPRD from
1994 to 2013.
Intervention: None.
Main outcome measures: Incident type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnoses up to
age 25 years.
Results: A total of 654 incident cases of T2D and 1318 T1D cases were found. The incidence of T2D per
100,000 persons annually increased from 6.4 in 1994 to 1998 to 33.2 in 2009 to 2013; and that for T1D
increased from 38.2 to 52.1 per 100,000 persons during the same period. The incidence of T2D increased
in both overweight (85th to 95th percentile for age- and sex-specific BMI; P = 0.01) and obese ($95th
percentile; P , 0.01) individuals from 1994 to 2013. Obese individuals, who constituted 47.1% of T2D
cases, had a markedly greater risk of incident T2D [odds ratio, 3.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.07 to
4.57], with an incidence rate ratio of 4.33 (95% CI, 3.68 to 5.08) compared with the normal BMI category.
No positive linear association was found between obesity (greater BMI) and incident T1D cases.
Conclusions: Increasing obesity has contributed to the increasing incidence of T2D but not T1D among
UK children and young adults, with a fourfold greater risk of developing T2D in obese individuals.

 Obesity is a global health epidemic that is shifting toward children and young adults [1-3].
More than one-half of adults, aged $18 years, were obese or overweight in 2014 [4], and one
of three children leaving primary school were considered obese or overweight in 2015 [5].
The rate of increase in obesity prevalence in children and young adults might have sta-
bilized during the recent decade [6–8]; however, 37% of older children are now overweight or
obese in the United Kingdom [6]. Observational and genetic evidence from traditional
cohort studies has suggested that obesity is a well-documented risk factor for type 2 diabetes
[9–11]. However, recent evidence exploring the association of childhood obesity [defined as
the 95th percentile for body mass index (BMI)] with the presence of pediatric diabetes in a
real world primary care setting has been less well studied [12–14]. A recent prospective
study from Norway and Denmark showed a positive association between the weight in-
crease during the first 12 months of life and the development of type 1 diabetes [15],
suggesting that similar to type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes might have environmental
origins.
Another study showed that the prevalence rates of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in-
creased among children and adolescents in the United States from 2001 to 2009 [16]. In
England and Wales, 26,687 children and young adults aged #25 years receive diabetes care,
with 95% classified as having type 1 diabetes and 2% having type 2 diabetes [17]. Previous
studies of type 2 diabetes in children and young adults had included small number of
participants or been conducted in selected cohorts [18, 19]. The present study evaluated the
incidence and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and estimated the risk of
developing diabetes in association with an elevated BMI in a cohort of children and young
adults with BMI recorded from 1994 through 2013.
1. Methods
A. Study Design and Data Source
A cohort study was conducted using the electronic health records from the UK Clinical
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) [20]. The UK CPRD is one of the largest primary care
databases of electronic health records worldwide [6] and collates anonymized data on the
clinical diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory test results, referrals to specialists, and hospital
admissions [21]. Individuals were sampled from 375 English general practices that partic-
ipate in the CPRD data linkage scheme, if they were aged 2 to15 years at BMI measurement
and had BMI values recorded during the period 1994 to 2013. The Independent Scientific
Advisory Committee approved the present protocol (Independent Scientific Advisory Com-
mittee no. 13-194).
B. Demographic Information, Measurements, and Outcomes
Demographic information, including sex, date of birth, and dates of the start and end of the
record (Supplemental Fig. 1), was analyzed. We searched the database for the BMI, height,
and weight records to calculate the BMI, as previously described [6, 22, 23]. Our main
outcomes were the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which were classified according
to the medical diagnostic codes, prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs, or a hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) value. The applicable prescriptions were insulin or an oral glucose-lowering agent,
including sulfonylureas, metformin, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glitazones, acar-
bose, and glinides [24]. The first date in the record of a prescription of any of these was
assigned as the diabetes start date. Patients attributed with a diabetes diagnosis before
12 months after the start of their CPRD record were excluded because these cases were
considered to be prevalent diabetes (Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2) [24].
The patients were considered to have type 1 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of type 1
diabetes or had been prescribed insulin and had never been prescribed oral glucose-lowering
medications in the CPRD. Type 2 diabetes was defined as a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, the

 prescription of oral glucose-lowering medications only, or a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or
HbA1c $6.5% (48 mmol/mol) but no insulin prescription. Those with diabetes that could not
be classified were excluded. The excluded cases included diagnoses of both type 1 and type 2
diabetes, prescriptions for both oral glucose-lowering medications and insulin, diagnosis of
type 1 diabetes without an insulin prescription, and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with a
prescription for insulin. We also excluded women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syn-
drome or gestational diabetes (Supplemental Fig. 2).
C. Statistical Analysis
The BMI values were converted to Z-scores, adjusting for exact age and sex using the
British 1990 growth reference data population [23]. Normal weight was defined as a BMI
Z-score ,1.04 (,85th percentile on a growth chart). Overweight was defined as 1.04 to
1.64 (85th to 95th percentile) and obese as a Z-score of $1.64 ($95th percentile) of the UK
1990 reference population [23]. We calculated the present age in each calendar year and
calculated the person-years of observation from 1994 until the date of diabetes diagnosis
for incident cases of diabetes or the end of the record for the remaining individuals. We
estimated the incidence rates of diabetes (or age-standardized to the 2013 European
Standard Population for reference) [25, 26], with person-years as the exposure variable.
Incidence rates (per 100,000 persons per year) were presented for each 5-year period and
according to the present age, sex, and BMI categories. We fitted unadjusted or jointly
adjusted Poisson regression models to calculate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all
variables.
To replicate the Poisson regression models and estimate the relative risks, we also
conducted a nested case-control study in which each case with diabetes was matched for sex,
year of birth, and general practice with up to four randomly selected controls (without any
relevant records for diabetes). We fitted conditional logistic regression models to calculate the
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident diabetes in relation to an
elevated BMI. We calculated the ORs per one standard deviation (SD) change in BMI, for
overweight and obesity (normal weight as reference) or across BMI quintiles (first quintile as
reference). We applied quintile values in controls to categorize the BMI. As a sensitivity
analysis, we repeated this analysis using only data for BMI values recorded before the date of
the diabetes diagnosis to reduce the likelihood of reverse causality. All data analyses were
performed in Stata, version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and R, version 3.2.3 (R
Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Owing to the large sample size of the present study, P , 0.01
was considered statistically significant.
2. Results
A. Population Characteristics
We analyzed the data from 369,362 eligible individuals with the BMI calculated using weight
and height values (n = 321,597) or BMI as directly recorded in the CPRD (n = 47,765) from
1994 to 2013. The mean age at the last birthday before the BMI record was 8.8 6 4.3 years
(range, 2 to 15), and 49.5% were female. The median BMI Z-score was 0.36 [interquartile
range (IQR), 20.5 to 1.2]. Of the participants, 45,228 were overweight (12.3%) overweight and
61,356 were obese (16.7%). The median BMI Z-score was greater in the obese category in 2009
to 2013 compared with 1994 to 1998 (2.3; IQR, 1.9 to 2.7; vs 2.2; IQR, 1.9 to 2.7; P , 0.01). For
the overweight category, no statistically significant increase was observed (P = 0.2).
B. Incidence and Trends for Type 2 and Type 1 Diabetes
A total of 654 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and 1318 incident cases of type 1 diabetes were
found. The incidence of both type 2 and type 1 diabetes increased from 1994 to 2013 (Fig. 1).

 The mean time lag between the BMI records as exposure and the date of diabetes diagnosis
was 0.4 year (IQR, 21.5 to 4.5 years). From 1994 to 1998 through 2009 to 2013, the incidence of
type 2 diabetes per 100,000 persons per year increased from 6.4 (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.7) to 33.2
(95% CI, 29.7 to 37.1; P for trend , 0.01; Table 1). We also observed increases in the incidence
of type 1 diabetes across 5-year calendar periods: from 38.2 (95% CI, 30.4 to 47.2) in 1994 to
1998 to 52.1 (95% CI, 47.6 to 56.9) in 2009 to 2013 per 100,000 persons per year (P for trend ,
0.01; Table 1). Increasing trends in type 2 diabetes incidence were observed for both sexes, for
both children and young adults, and for those who were overweight or obese (Table 1). The
incidence of type 1 diabetes continued to increase for those aged #15 years; however, this
trend was evident for females and those with a normal BMI only (Table 1).
Figure 1. Incidence of type 2 and type 1 diabetes in UK children and young adults, 1994 to
2013. In 1997 and 2010, the diagnostic criteria for diabetes was changed (use of fasting
plasma glucose $126 mg/dL or HbA1c $6.5%, respectively).

 C. Incidence Rate and Risk Ratios
The increase in diabetes risk with time was evaluated using IRRs from Poisson regression
models. The adjusted IRRs for type 2 diabetes for 2004 to 2008 or 2009 to 2013 were 1.7 to 3.3
times as high as the rate in 1994 to 1998. For type 1 diabetes, the rates were significantly
greater in 2004 to 2008 or 2009 to 2013 compared with the rate in 1994 to 1998 (adjusted IRRs,
1.5 or 2.0; Table 2). The incidence rate of type 2 diabetes was greater in females, but type 1
diabetes was greater in males. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was more evident in those aged
11 to 15 years and in those aged .15 years compared with children aged ,5 years. In contrast,
the type 1 diabetes incidence decreased with age (adjusted IRR, 0.83 for those aged 11 to 15
years and 0.2 for those aged .15 years compared with those aged ,5 years; Table 2). The
incidence of type 2 diabetes showed an increase in overweight or obese during 1994 to 2013,

 and the type 1 diabetes incidence increased gradually in those with normal BMI (Fig. 2). For
type 2 diabetes, obese individuals had significantly greater incidence rates than those with a
normal BMI (adjusted IRR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.7 to 5.1; Table 2). We refitted models with two-way
interaction terms for BMI categories to assess effect modification by sex, age, and period.
Higher rates of type 2 diabetes with obesity were noted in those aged 11 to 15 years and in the
last two periods (P , 0.01 for interaction; Supplemental Fig. 3). We observed no similar
associations between the BMI categories and type 1 diabetes (Table 2).
The ORs, which approximate the relative risks in the nested case-control analysis, are
listed in Table 3 [27]. We observed that obese individuals constituted 47.1% (n = 308 of 654) of
type 2 diabetes cases and had approximately four times the risk of incident type 2 diabetes as
those with a normal BMI (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.1 to 4.6; Table 3). Overweight and obesity were
not similarly associated with type 1 diabetes (Table 2). We observed no association between
obesity and incident type 1 diabetes in analyses limited to diabetes cases assigned after BMI
records as exposure (Supplemental Table 1). The age-adjusted OR was 4.0 (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.3)
for type 2 diabetes when comparing the top quintile and the bottom quintile of the BMI Z-score
(Supplemental Table 2). With BMI as a continuous variable, we observed an OR of 1.6 (95%
CI, 1.5 to 1.7) per 1-SD increase in BMI Z-score. BMI was positively associated with type 1
diabetes at the middle range of BMI, and the association was nonsignificant for the top
quintile vs the bottom quintile (Supplemental Table 2). The corresponding OR per 1-SD
increase in BMI was not statistically significant (age-adjusted OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.05).
3. Discussion
The present large cohort study was based on primary care electronic health records. Our
results showed that the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been increasing
among UK children and young adults from 1994 to 2013. A greater incidence (fourfold) of type

 2 diabetes was observed in obese (constituting about one-half of cases). Given that no linear
association was found between the BMI and the incidence of type 1 diabetes and that a higher
BMI was not associated with type 1 diabetes when analyzing only those individuals with a
BMI value before the date of diabetes diagnosis, further work is needed to replicate our
observational evidence from children and young adults.
Diabetes increasingly imposes a large burden on health and society worldwide, as indicated
by estimates that 1 in 11 adults have type 2 diabetes (415 million people) and .0.5 million
children (aged #14 years) had type 1 diabetes in 2015 [28–30]. Understanding the temporal
trends and incidence of diabetes and the modifiable factors is paramount to providing timely
prevention or delaying the occurrence of diabetes during the life course [31]. Previous work
has mainly reported the burden and incidence of type 1 diabetes in children [32, 33]. Little
evidence is available concerning type 2 diabetes and little is known about the potential
association of obesity with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes in children and young adults [30,
34]. The SEARCH study for the 2002 to 2003 period has reported that type 2 diabetes in youth
is predominantly occurring in higher risk ethnic groups, accounting for 14.9% of all diabetes

 cases among non-Hispanic white adolescents aged $10 years (incidence rates ranged from 5.6
among whites to 49.4 per 100,000 persons per year among Native Americans) [35]. Other
studies, which were mainly conducted 10 years earlier in Europe, reported type 2 diabetes as
an uncommon condition in white young populations or showed no trend [34, 36]. A prospective
surveillance UK study in 2004 to 2005 reported 67 cases of type 2 diabetes of all 363 diabetes
diagnoses based on notification by pediatricians in children aged #17 years [37]. Using CPRD
data, another study analyzing the data from 0.5 million children aged 0 to 18 years showed an
eightfold increase in the prevalence of oral antidiabetic drugs, from 0.6 per 100,000 children in
1998 to 5 per 100,000 children in 2005 [38]. A relative risk for incident type 2 diabetes has been
estimated as approximately twice as large per 1-SD difference in BMI in European adults.
Recently, a longitudinal study showed an association between adolescent BMI and incident

 diabetes in adults, which was not independent of the adult BMI [30]. Another study in
Finland showed a link between a change in childhood BMI and type 2 diabetes in
adults [39].
We add to previous observational evidence that childhood or adolescent obesity is asso-
ciated with an increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (but not type 1) in children and
young adults. Moreover, increases in type 2 diabetes incidence by obese category were greater
among those aged 11 to 15 years and in the last two calendar periods. This pattern is con-
sistent with increased BMI values during the period in the obese category. Although our
estimates were greater than those previously reported in white populations, similar data are
lacking, in terms of time period and observational setting, to judge recent estimates of type 2
diabetes incidence. We observed that most children and young adults with type 2 diabetes
were overweight or obese, in line with the results of the surveillance UK study [37]. Moreover,

 we estimated that obese children and young adults have approximately four times the risk of
incident type 2 diabetes as those with a normal BMI.
Our finding of the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes in those aged #15 years is consistent
with previous studies from population-based or primary care data. Although estimates have
varied across populations and time, temporal trends have shown an increasing diabetes incidence
in children and young adults from the 1990s through the 2000s and beyond [16, 32–37, 40–42].
We, and others, have shown that the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes has increased during
recent decades [32, 38, 40, 42]. Similar to these studies, we observed that the type 1 diabetes
incidence continued to increase in female individuals and those aged #15 years from 1994 to
2013. However, our study, and other studies in Europe, has shown that the incidence of type 1
diabetes is somewhat greater in male than in female individuals [32]. Although both genetic and
environmental factors have been proposed in the etiology of type 1 diabetes, the reason for the
increase in type 1 diabetes incidence is unknown. Obviously, the improved survival in children
with type 1 diabetes and the potential for successful reproduction are contributors to this increase
[32]. No linear association was found between BMI and the incidence of type 1 diabetes in our
study. However, we observed a greater incidence among overweight children but a lower in-
cidence among obese children. The results of a few cohort or case-control studies have suggested
that weight in the first year of life is positively associated with type 1 diabetes. However, ob-
servational evidence for an association between BMI and type 1 diabetes has varied [15]. Given
that the autoimmune response encoded by the HLA class genes strongly contributes to the
etiology of type 1 diabetes, questions exist regarding whether early life obesity might have a
biologically beneficial effect on type 1 diabetes risk later in life [43]. Apart from this, it is plausible
that disease-related weight loss or a selection bias might account for an apparently paradoxical
association between obesity and type 1 diabetes in our observational study [44].
Taken together, we have updated observational evidence that the rate of type 2 diabetes
incidence, although less common than type 1, is increasing among UK children and young
adults in parallel with the increasing childhood obesity during the past decades [1, 30, 31, 45].
Our observational findings support the use of a real world practice database to broadly
estimate the risks and rates of major global health issues, such as incident diabetes in
children. Such evidence can also extend our understanding of disease burden and temporal
trends beyond surveillance from the secondary-care pediatric setting and traditional cohorts,
which have usually included a limited size and select population [46]. Our results will add
value to the research that informs policy makers to identify emerging health care needs and
how to prioritize future clinical studies for targeted management of childhood obesity
and diabetes. Children with type 2 diabetes potentially have related disorders such as
dyslipidemia and hypertension [37, 47]. Given the age of onset, it seems that childhood di-
abetes is more severe than diabetes in adults. Also, the effects of diabetes-related outcomes on
health and society will be greater throughout the life course [2, 48].

 The present study had certain limitations. First, data on BMI, height, and weight were not
available for all individuals in the CPRD. It is possible that children had their weight and height
recorded not as a part of routine practice and that a general practitioner in primary care had
decided to measure BMI because of the child’s high weight or health status [21]. In the CPRD,
the method of height and weight measurements (e.g., shoes on or off) and the quality of data
collected might be varied in each practice; however, such variance can be random, and power
can be maintained by the large numbers. Therefore, a potential for selection bias exists that one
cannot completely rule out in clinical or observational research, and randomness remains an
assumption [21]. Previous studies using the CPRD suggested the consistency of results ob-
tained from primary care data with those from cohort observations and that up-to-date BMI
values and obesity prevalence in CPRD were as close as population-based survey data [21, 22].
Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of associations of demographic information and BMI
with diabetes types, which were observed in our study, are consistent with those reported in
published studies. We also observed similar results when only data on the BMI records before
the date of a diabetes diagnosis were used as a sensitivity analysis. As previously reported, most
(~77%) children contributed one BMI observation to the CPRD [6]. It also seems plausible that
the incidence of diabetes could have been artificially increased, because we used a single
measure of BMI to constitute exposure. However, completeness of the BMI data in the
CPRD did not fundamentally vary over time among children and young adults from 1994
through 2011 [22], reducing the probability that our results occurred by chance. Although
important questions remain regarding how the BMI trajectory measured early in childhood
might contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes [31], we did not have enough in-
formation about the BMI trend between the time point the BMI was measured and the onset
date of diabetes in our study. Second, we used data from clinical cases, prescriptions for
diabetes drugs, and HbA1c tests. Nevertheless, we could have missed false-negative cases
in the remainder of the CPRD, because diabetes, in particular, type 2 diabetes, can remain
undiagnosed for several months to years [29]. Given the large size of the CPRD cohort,
combined with the low incidence of type 2 diabetes among children and young adults, we
would not expect this to have largely affected our findings [16, 20, 22, 29, 35, 36]. Although
we applied some strict criteria for the definition of diabetes types and some mis-
classification of outcomes or the onset date of diabetes is inevitable, the effect on our es-
timates was likely small [21]. Other limitations included that the present study could not
provide information on autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes, physical activity, puberty effect
on changes in the BMI, and the extent of glycemia control. Finally, generalization of these
findings is limited, because the data in the UK CPRD are predominantly from those of
European ancestry.
In conclusion, the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among UK children and young
adults continued to increase from 1994 to 2013 in both sexes and in those aged #15 years. An
increasing trend in the incidence of type 2 diabetes was more evident among the overweight
and obese. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was four times as high among obese individuals
(constituting about one-half of cases) as among those with a normal BMI. No linear asso-
ciation was found between the childhood BMI and the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Further
work is needed to explore potential targets for the prevention of childhood obesity and early-
onset type 2 diabetes.
