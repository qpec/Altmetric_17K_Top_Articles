ABSTRACT
Background and hypothesis Recently, the world
has experienced a rapidly escalating outbreak of
infectious syphilis primarily affecting men who have sex
with men (MSM); many are taking highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-1 infection. The
prevailing hypothesis is that HAART availability and
effectiveness have led to the perception among both
individuals who are HIV-1 infected and those who are
uninfected that HIV-1 transmission has become much
less likely, and the effects of HIV-1 infection less deadly.
This is expected to result in increased sexual risk-taking,
especially unprotected anal intercourse, leading to more
non-HIV-1 STDs, including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and
syphilis. However, syphilis incidence has increased more
rapidly than other STDs. We hypothesise that HAART
downregulates the innate and acquired immune
responses to Treponema pallidum and that this
biological explanation plays an important role in the
syphilis epidemic.
Methods We performed a literature search and
developed a mathematical model of HIV-1 and
T. pallidum confection in a population with two risk
groups with assortative mixing to explore the
consequence on syphilis prevalence of HAART-induced
changes in behaviour versus HAART-induced biological
effects.
Conclusions and implications Since rising syphilis
incidence appears to have outpaced gonorrhoea and
chlamydia, predominantly affecting HIV-1 positive MSM,
behavioural factors alone may be insufficient to explain
the unique, sharp increase in syphilis incidence. HAART
agents have the potential to alter the innate and
acquired immune responses in ways that may enhance
susceptibility to T. pallidum. This raises the possibility
that therapeutic and preventative HAART may
inadvertently increase the incidence of syphilis, a
situation that would have significant and global public
health implications. We propose that additional studies
investigating the interplay between HAART and
enhanced T. pallidum susceptibility are needed. If our
hypothesis is correct, HAART should be combined with
enhanced patient management including frequent
monitoring for pathogens such as T. pallidum.
INTRODUCTION
STDs, HIV-1 and men who have sex with men
In British Columbia (BC), Canada, from 2005 to
2014, infectious syphilis case reports (primary, sec-
ondary and early latent) rose 90.6% (288–549),
chlamydia 39.9% (9540–13 348) and gonorrhoea
63.8% (1100–1802), corresponding to rate changes
per 100 000 population of +72.4%, +33.9% and
+47.6%,
respectively.1
Female
syphilis
cases
decreased while male cases jumped from 202 to
524, accounting for 95% of all 2014 cases. Men
who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for
60.4% (122) of cases in 2005, rising to 88.9%
(466) in 2014. There was a fourfold increase in
MSM syphilis from 2010 to 2014 (115–466 cases),
including 112 reinfections (24%) in 2014. The
HIV-1 coinfection rate in MSM during this period
was 50%–75%. From 2005 to 2014, the male
infectious syphilis rate increased 235% (9.7–22.8)
compared with a much smaller increase for chla-
mydia
(56.9%;
141.7–222.4)
and
gonorrhoea
(42.1%; 39.7–56.4) in men.
Comparatively larger increases in syphilis cases
were also observed in the USA from 2005 to 2014.
Primary and secondary syphilis cases rose 128.1%
(8724–19 999), chlamydia 47.7% (976 445–1 441
789) and gonorrhoea 3.1% (339 593–350 062),
corresponding
to
rate
changes
of
+117.2%,
+38.5% and −3.4%, respectively.2 Males contribu-
ted an increasing proportion of syphilis cases,
accounting for 91% in 2014. From 2007 to 2014,
among the 27 US states that collected sex partner
data for ≥70% of males, MSM cases increased
steadily to 82.9%. In Los Angeles County between
January and May, 2010, 76% of 537 early syphilis
cases were MSM and ≥58% of these were HIV-1
positive.3 HIV-1 infection in US MSM has also
been statistically associated with repeat syphilis
infection.4
In the UK from 1998 to 2013, new syphilis cases
in MSM rose from 23 (26.0% of all cases) to 2546
(71.3% of all cases). From 2009 to 2013 in
England, the odds of being diagnosed with syphilis
increased
from
2.71
(95%
CI
2.41
to
3.05,
p<0.001) to 4.05 (95% CI 3.70 to 4.45, p<0.001)
in

relative
to

 second-line and third-line alternative agents. In BC, 86.1% of
patients take two NRTIs with a boosted PI (34%), NNRTI
(30%), InSTI (19%) or fusion/entry inhibitor (1%).6 Common
NRTIs include TDF (64%), FTC (59%) and 3TC (40%). An
additional 11% (741 patients) take InSTIs in other HAART
combinations. In total, 30% (2056) take InSTIs. HAART usage
has grown steadily including a 288% increase in InSTI usage
from 2010 to 2015 (530–2056 patients).
Because HAART stimulates and supports immune system
recovery from HIV-1-related immunosuppression, one might
expect HAART to be associated with declining infection rates
for
most
pathogenic
organisms.
However,
several
studies
support the hypothesis that HAART may be associated with
syphilis acquisition. Receiving HAART (adjusted HR=1.81
(95% CI 1.25 to 2.62, p<0.002)), older age and MSM status
were independent risk factors for syphilis seroconversion by
multivariate logistic regression analysis in 1010 people who
were infected with HIV in Northeast China from 2009 to
2013.7 Using Poisson regression analysis, Park and coauthors8
found that the period-specific incidence rate of early syphilis in
539 patients receiving HAART in Korea significantly increased
in proportion to the years after starting HAART (p<0.001).
These two studies were conducted in stable cohorts but they did
not control for specific sexual risk behaviours.
Additional studies have reported a significant proportion of
new syphilis cases in persons receiving HAART
, including
32.7% of all 1089 new syphilis cases in France from 2000 to
2003 and 71% of the 502 cases who knew their HIV-1 positive
status.9 Among 104 early syphilis and 36 late or indeterminate
latent syphilis cases in a Malaga study from 2004 to 2011, 65
of 85 (76.4%) with prior known HIV-1 infection were taking
HAART
.10 A retrospective, descriptive study at the University of
Alabama found 40 incident syphilis cases from 2004 to 2007 in
1544 patients who were HIV-1 positive.11 T
wo-thirds were
receiving HAART when syphilis was diagnosed including all five
patients with primary syphilis. The proportion of the entire
cohort on HAART was not reported. Among 3448 patients fol-
lowed in a Parisian Hospital Infectious Disease Service from
January 2000 to December 2002, 48 of 71 (67.6%) patients
with a new diagnosis of syphilis were taking HAART
.12 For BC,
over 8000 males have tested HIV-1 positive, and HAART usage
in MSM is more than 80%.1 6 However, the percentage taking
HAARTwhen syphilis was diagnosed is unknown.
Behavioural change
One explanation for high rates of syphilis in MSM is increased
risky sex, often in the context of optimistic risk perception.
Similarly, any association between syphilis and HAART might
be a surrogate marker for risky sex in individuals treated with
HAART rather than an effect of HAART itself. Seroadaptive
behaviours to prevent HIV-1 transmission, such as serosorting
(ie, selective unprotected sex with partners of the same HIV
status), have also been implicated in increasing STD incidence
including syphilis.13 What then is the evidence for HIV-1 treat-
ment optimism and behavioural change in MSM and persons
on HAART?
Several studies support treatment optimism including a 2013
literature review, which concluded that quantitative studies were
‘largely in support’ of an association between optimistic beliefs
and HIV-1 transmission risk.14 However, other studies have
shown no change or decreased risky behaviour and/or no lessen-
ing of risk perception, as discussed later in this section.
Many HIV-1-infected MSM believe they have a responsibility
to protect their sex partners,15 and many eliminate or reduce
HIV-1 transmission behaviours after HIV-1 diagnosis. A 2005
US meta-analysis concluded that high-risk sexual behaviour with
partners who were HIV-1 negative was significantly reduced
(68%, 95% CI 59% to 76%, p<0.001) after HIV-1 diagnosis.16
Persson used the Swiss Consensus Statement that people on
effective HIV-1 treatment cannot transmit HIV-1 as a surrogate
for HIV-1 treatment optimism in interviews of HIV-1 discord-
ant couples. Participants were highly sceptical of the Statement’s
prevention message and not one described it as having any
direct relevance to their sexual decision making.17
Much of the HIV-1 treatment optimism literature focuses on
behavioural change in persons on HAART and subsequent to
HAART
initiation.
In
512
patients
receiving
HAART
in
Bangkok, unprotected sex risk was found in only 27 patients
(5%) and multivariate analysis showed no association with
beliefs about HIV-1 transmission while taking HAART
.18 A
2009
meta-analysis
of
unprotected
anal
intercourse
(UAI)
among HIV-1 diagnosed US MSM found no association with
HAART15 and a cross-sectional study of 420 London men who
were HIV-1 positive showed that men on HAART had fewer
sexual partners and less UAI.19 Among 456 HIV-1 positive US
MSM, Remien et al20 found no increased sexual risk behaviour
and substantial ongoing perception of HIV-1 transmission risk
while on HAART
. Using data from a prospective behavioural
study nested in a randomised controlled trial of early HAART
(T
emprano), Jean et al21 found significant decreases over
24 months in sexual activity (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92),
multiple partnerships (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.79), unpro-
tected sex (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75) and risky sex (OR
0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76).
W
e could find only one study that found a link between
increasing syphilis incidence and seroadaptive behaviours such
as serosorting in individuals treated with HAART with unsup-
pressed viral load, but this would not explain rising syphilis inci-
dence out-of-proportion to other STDs.13
Some studies have implicated core groups in this syphilis out-
break,22 while other studies have shown little or no significant
increase in risky sex, number of contacts or concurrency among
core group members. In a retrospective study of syphilis among
MSM in San Francisco, number of sex partners, illicit substance
use, partner meeting venues and commercial sex were not asso-
ciated with repeat syphilis infection.4 In the Alabama, Bangkok
and T
emprano cohorts referenced earlier, similar core group
characteristics were not associated with incident syphilis, unpro-
tected sex risk or multiple partnerships, respectively.11
18 21
Finally, a mathematical model of behaviour in a core group pre-
dicted a transient spike in unprotected sex that was counteracted
by other pathways on longer timescales, leading to lower rates
of unprotected sex on the whole.23
Modelling studies conducted herein to test our hypothesis are
in support of both behavioural change and HAART treatment
being able to increase syphilis prevalence, with the combined
effect being more than additive (figure 1). Specifically, we devel-
oped a mathematical model of HIV-1 and T
reponema pallidum
coinfection in a population with two risk groups and assortative
mixing between groups. Susceptible individuals acquire infection
from a partner who is infected with a fixed probability per
sexual encounter. In the case of HIV-1, the infection probability
is lower if the partner who is HIV-1 positive is on HAART
versus untreated, but it is higher if the partner who is either
HIV-1 negative or HIV-1 positive is already infected with T. pal-
lidum versus uninfected. Individuals who are infected receive
treatment at a constant rate dependent on the pathogen.
Individuals lose their treated status at a disease-dependent rate.

 Individuals infected with HIV-1 have a disease-imposed mortal-
ity rate that is lower for individuals on HAART
.
W
e numerically simulated the model using baseline para-
meters taken from the literature.24 W
e initialised each simulation
with a small number of individuals who are infected and intro-
duced HAART 20 years later. W
e explored effects on syphilis
prevalence of HAART-induced changes in behaviour versus
immunology. For behavioural change, we assumed that indivi-
duals on HAART adopt more risky sexual behaviours by increas-
ing their partnership formation rates, which increases their
ability to transmit T. pallidum. For immunological change, we
assumed that individuals on HAART have a higher susceptibility
to T. pallidum than individuals who are untreated. The simula-
tion results show that either behavioural (figure 1, left panel,
blue and red lines) or immunological (figure 1, right panel,
black line) change alone can produce syphilis outbreaks with
peak prevalence that is substantially higher than baseline.
Strikingly, the peak prevalence of the syphilis outbreak produced
by both behavioural and immunological changes (figure 1, right
panel, blue and red lines) is larger than the sum of the peaks of
outbreaks produced independently by either type of change
(figure 1, left panel, blue and red lines; right panel, black line).
Therefore,
the
immunological
effects
of
HAART
and
HAART-induced behavioural change can in principle act syner-
gistically to increase syphilis prevalence by amounts comparable
with that observed in the ongoing outbreak.
DISCUSSION
Biological plausibility
Protection against the extracellular pathogen T. pallidum, the
causative agent of syphilis, is dependent upon T cell expansion
and the generation of an early Th1-stimulating, interferon γ
(IFN γ)-producing host proinflammatory response that potenti-
ates
the
primary
clearance
mechanism
of
T.
pallidum,
macrophage-mediated opsonophagocytosis.25 The latter process
is dependent on unperturbed mitochondrial function to ensure
peak metabolic activity within macrophages,26 opsonic antibody
production
and
IFN
γ-mediated
macrophage
activation.27
Opsonic antibody quality is reduced in individuals infected with
HIV-128 and certain HAART agents significantly suppress mito-
chondrial
function,26
the
proinflammatory
response29
and
macrophage activation,30 leading to reduced treponemal clear-
ance via opsonophagocytosis. InSTIs have been shown to sup-
press the proinflammatory response in cohort studies29 and
opsonophagocytosis is reduced in vitro following treatment
of macrophages with NRTIs, consistent with mitochondrial
damage.26
Further, the well-documented depletion of CD4+ memory T
cells in individuals infected with HIV-130 would enhance their
susceptibility to syphilis reinfection. NRTIs, especially TDF,
have been shown to inhibit telomerase activity leading to accel-
erated shortening of telomerase length in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs),31 which may lead to the accumula-
tion of replicative senescent cells32 with limited ability to
protect against pathogens such as T. pallidum. Reciprocally,
upregulation of monocyte expression of CCR5 receptors by
treponemal lipoproteins enhances the susceptibility of mono-
cytes to HIV-1 infection,33 further weakening the innate and
adaptive immune responses to T. pallidum.
Collectively, these observations provide viable explanations
for (1) an enhanced susceptibility of individuals infected with
HIV-1, especially those on HAART
, to syphilis infection and
reinfection and (2) higher syphilis incidence among individuals
treated with HAART compared with chlamydia and gonorrhoea,
infections caused by pathogens that are less reliant on opsono-
phagocytosis for clearance.
Potential approach for hypothesis testing
HAART decreases the proinflammatory response in patients
infected
with
HIV-1,29
but
this
may
result
from
an
HAART-induced reduction of lymphocytes’ ability to upregulate
inflammatory markers, in line with our hypothesis, or from the
disappearance of a major cause of inflammation (ie, a fall in
HIV-1 viral load). These different effects can be teased apart
using experiments in macaques, which have been used as
models for human infection with T. pallidum34 and develop
AIDS-like disease following simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV) infection. T. pallidum challenge after specific HAART
administration with or without prior SIV infection can provide
insight into how HAART affects the proinflammatory response
and
syphilis
susceptibility
in
the absence
or
presence
of
retrovirus.
Prospective cohort studies can compare opsonophagocytic
activity of macrophages and susceptibility to syphilis among
healthy individuals who are HIV-1 negative receiving preventa-
tive
pre-exposure
prophylaxis
(PrEP),
healthy
controls,
untreated patients with HIV-1 and patients with HIV-1 receiving
Figure 1
A susceptible-infective-treated model of HIV-1 and
Treponema pallidum epidemiology predicts that both highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and behavioural change substantially
boost syphilis prevalence above baseline. The model used two risk
groups and assortative mixing between groups. Using baseline
parameters from the literature,24 we varied parameters quantifying
HAART effects and partnership formation rates on susceptibility to and
transmission of T. pallidum. We introduced HAART at 20 years and
plotted syphilis prevalence without (left panel) and with (right panel) a
threefold effect of HAART on susceptibility to T. pallidum, under
different assumptions about the effect of HAART on partnership
formation rates (for details and code, see https://github.com/dushoff/
Syphilis_and_ARVs). Compared with the baseline of no effect (left
panel, black line), the combined effect of increased susceptibility and
behavioural change (right panel, coloured lines) is larger than the sum
of the effects of behavioural change alone (left panel, coloured lines)
and increased susceptibility alone (right panel, black line).

 the same HAART as healthy individuals. To determine the effect
of HAART on CD4+ memory T cells, one can measure the
number of CD4+ memory T cells by flow cytometry in PBMCs
of persons on and off HAARTwith particular attention to TDF.
A retrospective case–control and/or a prospective cohort
study comparing the prevalence and epidemiological features of
infectious syphilis cases among patients who are HIV-1 positive
and treated with HAART
, patients who are HIV-1 positive and
untreated and patients who are HIV-1 negative, including the
usage of specific HAART agents, would be enlightening. Syphilis
databases without HAART information could be linked to treat-
ment

factors

HAARTusage.
CONCLUSION
Clinicians and researchers typically view HAART suppression of
the proinflammatory response positively because it decreases
HIV-1-associated pathological sequelae. However, this immune
dampening may have detrimental effects including enhanced
susceptibility to infection with T. pallidum and the occurrence
of unusual clinical manifestations such as ocular syphilis. The
possibility also exists that HAART-mediated immune dampening
may predispose an individual to other conditions that are non-
infectious in origin and depend upon a particular immune
response for control, including certain types of cancer. In this
regard, it is of interest to note that HAART treatment has been
suggested to be associated with a higher risk of anal cancer and,
potentially, other non-AIDS-defining cancers.35 Overall, these
findings suggest a possible link between HAART and an
increased risk for selected diseases of infectious and non-
infectious origin, a potential unforeseen consequence that war-
rants further study. If borne out, it will be imperative that the
highly exciting and efficacious global implementation of PrEP
be carried out with awareness towards the potential need for
enhanced patient management.
Key messages
▸ The number of new syphilis cases has risen dramatically
worldwide in recent years, with repeat infections within a
single individual a frequent occurrence.
▸ The syphilis outbreak has outpaced new cases of chlamydia
and gonorrhoea and is primarily affecting men who have sex
with men and who are taking highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART).
▸ Mathematic modelling suggests both behavioural change
and HAART contribute to the increasing syphilis prevalence,
with the combined effect being more than additive.
▸ If experimentally confirmed, HAART administration and
pre-exposure prophylaxis implementation will require
enhanced patient management guidelines to mitigate the
increased risk of developing selected infectious and
non-infectious diseases.
