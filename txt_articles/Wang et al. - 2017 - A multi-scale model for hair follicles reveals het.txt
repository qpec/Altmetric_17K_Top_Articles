Abstract The control principles behind robust cyclic regeneration of hair follicles (HFs) remain
unclear. Using multi-scale modeling, we show that coupling inhibitors and activators with physical
growth of HFs is sufficient to drive periodicity and excitability of hair regeneration. Model
simulations and experimental data reveal that mouse skin behaves as a heterogeneous
regenerative field, composed of anatomical domains where HFs have distinct cycling dynamics.
Interactions between fast-cycling chin and ventral HFs and slow-cycling dorsal HFs produce
bilaterally symmetric patterns. Ear skin behaves as a hyper-refractory domain with HFs in extended
rest phase. Such hyper-refractivity relates to high levels of BMP ligands and WNT antagonists, in

 part expressed by ear-specific cartilage and muscle. Hair growth stops at the boundaries with
hyper-refractory ears and anatomically discontinuous eyelids, generating wave-breaking effects. We
posit that similar mechanisms for coupled regeneration with dominant activator, hyper-refractory,
and wave-breaker regions can operate in other actively renewing organs.

Introduction
Featuring prominent growth cycles, the hair follicle (HF) is a model system of choice for studying tis-
sue regeneration. At the level of cellular activities, the hair growth cycle consists of three consecutive
phases: anagen, phase of active proliferation; catagen, apoptotic involution phase; and telogen, rela-
tive quiescence phase (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2010; Paus and Foitzik, 2004; Schneider et al., 2009;
Stenn and Paus, 2001). Cyclic regeneration is sustained by the bulge stem cells, located at the base
of the permanent HF portion (Cotsarelis et al., 1990). During anagen initiation, signals from the
niche, including the dermal papilla (DP), stimulate bulge stem cells and adjacent hair germ (HG) pro-
genitors to proliferate (Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010; Greco et al., 2009; Legrand et al., 2016).
Activated progenitors generate all lower HF structures, including the outer root sheath (ORS) and
hair matrix. During catagen, a widespread apoptotic program remodels the HF back toward a telo-
gen state (Botchkarev et al., 2001b; Fessing et al., 2006; Foitzik et al., 2000; Lindner et al.,
1997; Mesa et al., 2015). Conceptually, since the bulge produces downward migrating progeny
(Hsu et al., 2011), it effectively serves as a progenitor source, while the matrix functions as a sink,
and the ORS as a channel for progenitors transiting between them.
The signaling mechanisms that time these coordinated cellular activities during hair regeneration
remain incompletely understood (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2014; Bernard, 2012; Lin et al., 2009;
Paus et al., 1999). The putative ‘hair cycle clock’ is thought to be composed of one or several activa-
tor/inhibitor pairs acting to time key cycle phase transitions at set thresholds of their activities.
Accordingly, cycle pace will depend on the speed at which activators and inhibitors reach their
respective thresholds (Chen et al., 2015). Importantly, HFs exist as large populations and at least in
the dorsal skin they interact to coordinate growth cycles (Hodgson et al., 2014; Plikus et al., 2011,
Plikus and Chuong, 2008a, Plikus et al., 2008b). Such coordination implies that at least some of
the activators and inhibitors should be present between HFs, in the so-called skin macro-environ-
ment. Previous work on dorsal skin indicates that BMP and WNT pathways constitute important
components of the hair cycle clock. Indeed, defects in either of these pathways can dramatically
change hair cycle progression (Botchkarev et al., 2001a; Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004;
Choi et al., 2013; Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010; Kandyba and Kobielak, 2014; Kandyba et al.,
2013; Kobielak et al., 2003, 2007; Sharov et al., 2005, 2006), and ligands and antagonists for
both pathways mediate macro-environmental coordination between HFs (Chen et al., 2014;
Plikus et al., 2011; Plikus and Chuong, 2014). Additionally, FGF, PDGF, TGFb, TNFa and other
pathways can modulate hair cycle (Chen et al., 2015; Festa et al., 2011; Higgins et al., 2014;
Ito et al., 2003; Kimura-Ueki et al., 2012; Leishman et al., 2013; Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012; Pli-
kus, 2012; Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2016). Importantly, the combined signaling activities for the
above pathways partition the hair cycle in the dorsal skin into four functional phases, each with its
distinct activator/inhibitor profile: propagating anagen (P), autonomous anagen (A), refractory telo-
gen (R) and competent telogen (C) (Hodgson et al., 2014; Plikus and Chuong, 2014; Plikus et al.,
2008b). Interactions between HFs enable hair regeneration across dorsal skin to self-organize into
dynamic patterns. Critical for this self-organization are the following HF-to-HF interactions: P-phase
HFs can induce neighboring C-phase HFs to enter anagen via diffusible activators, leading to hair
growth coupling, while A-phase anagen or R-phase telogen HFs cannot couple due to high levels of
inhibitors (Murray et al., 2012; Plikus et al., 2011; Plikus and Chuong, 2014; Plikus et al., 2008b).
It remains unknown, however, whether this self-organization mechanism and its underlying WNT/
BMP signaling activities is a general feature of all body skin or a special case for dorsal skin only.
Integrative understanding of large-scale hair regeneration requires a systems biology approach.
Previous modeling on HFs include cellular automaton models (Halloy et al., 2000; Plikus et al.,
2011), feedback-control model (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2012) and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) excitable
medium model (Murray et al., 2012). Here, we present a unified three-dimensional and stochastic

 modeling framework for the HF that captures: (i) activator/inhibitor signaling dynamics in a single
HF, (ii) cyclic growth of a single HF, and (iii) coupling between multiple HFs through diffusive signals.
Using this model, we reveal that skin as a whole behaves as a heterogeneous regenerative field,
where: (a) dominant hair cycle waves start in the ventrum, (b) propagate dorsally in a bilateral pat-
tern, (c) stop at the boundary with hyper-refractory ear skin, and (d) break at non-propagating ana-
tomical landmarks, such as eyelids and ears. We also show that WNT and BMP serve as a universal
activator/inhibitor signaling pair, whose varying activities underlie distinct hair regeneration dynam-
ics in all anatomical locations studied. These results provide new understanding of how the entire
skin of the animal manages all of its hair regeneration.
Results
A multi-scale model recapitulates a single growing HF, as well as HF-to-
HF communication
First, in modeling the geometry of a single HF, we considered four key expression sites for activator/
inhibitor ligands, antagonists, and receptors along the HF axis: bulge, HG, matrix, and DP
(Figure 1A). During the cycle, the bulge (assigned as Region I) remains relatively static, whereas the
DP moves up and down along the HF axis. Also dynamic are the HG and matrix. The former only
exists during telogen, while the latter only exists during anagen. The HG grows down to make matrix
during anagen onset, whereas during catagen, the matrix collapses, and a new HG reforms. Simplis-
tically, cyclic HGfimatrixfiHG dynamics are coordinated with the DP; thus, in the model we identify
them jointly as Region II. Next, we considered that both regions produce signaling factors. Although
a biological simplification, we assumed that Region I does so at a rather constant rate, while Region
II shows distinct temporal dynamics (Appendix 2—table 4). We also assumed that Region II is essen-
tial for sending hair cycle-promoting signal(s), while Region I is the primary signal target. In short, we
hypothesized that the essential temporal molecular dynamics in the HF operate as follows: Region II
generates a signaling ligand (L) gradient; Region I detects it and transmits it into ligand-bound
receptors (LR) that then, through a series of intermediate signaling steps not captured in the model
directly (such as activities of the downstream signaling pathways and involvement of additional cell
eLife digest Skin includes hundreds of thousands of hair follicles that cycle through different
stages of activity. Each follicle grows hair, sometimes (in the case of long hairs like human head hair
and horse tail hairs) for several years, before losing it. The follicle then goes through a resting stage
before starting to grow another hair. To achieve high hair density, the follicles need to coordinate
their hair-making activities. If they all worked independently from one another, bald patches would
inevitably form that would compromise how effectively the skin works.
Groups of cells can communicate using a variety of chemical signals. It was not known whether
cells in hair follicles from different regions of the skin rely on the same signals to communicate, and
whether follicles in neighboring regions are able to ‘understand’ one another.
Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental results from mice, Wang, Oh
et al. now show that hair follicles across the body use a common signaling system. This system
consists of a pair of signals: ‘activators’ that stimulate hair growth, and ‘inhibitors’ that prevent it.
The balance between these two signals affects the pattern of hair growth. For example, higher levels
of activators allow fur to grow thickly on the belly of the mouse, likely to protect against heat loss
and injuries from the ground. By contract, higher levels of inhibitors make the hairs on the ear
sparse, which may prevent them from interfering with hearing.
There is little evidence that hair follicles on the scalp communicate in adult humans. Learning to
activate and control communication between these follicles could provide a way to treat male
pattern baldness and similar conditions. Understanding how hair follicles communicate may also
help researchers to develop ways of regenerating other fast-renewing organs, such as the gut and
bone marrow.

(1)
q
qt ½LR� ¼ Reaction of L and R þ Degradation þ Extra Source
(2)
where L, R and LR stand for ligands, receptors, and ligand-bound receptors, respectively. In the
dynamics of LR (Equation 2), the ‘Extra Source’ describes stochastic signaling effects due to noise,
and potential signaling contributions from Region I (Appendix 2-Governing equations for activators
and inhibitors). As Equations 1 and 2 show, ligand-receptor interactions in the model take place
only for the same signaling pathway, and no direct pathway cross-talk is set to occur. This, again, is a
biological simplification. Recently, evidence for pathway interactions have emerged (Kandyba et al.,
2013), and its effect is explored in Appendix 2-Possible interactions between the activator and inhib-
itor pathways do not qualitatively alter the HF dynamics.
Our model integrates key signaling features of the hair growth cycle: strong activator signals
enhance HF growth, while strong inhibitor signals prevent it. We modeled HF growth through the
spatial average of LR concentration differences between the levels of activator and inhibitor in
Region I (Equation 7 in Appendix 2-Modeling HF phases by concentration difference). We assumed
the hair cycle has two critical ‘checkpoints’: (i) the event in late competent telogen, when production
of activator starts to increase (Chen et al., 2014; Greco et al., 2009; Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012;
Plikus et al., 2008b), and (ii) the event of anagen termination, when the HF starts to involute. Thus,
our model recognizes two phases determined by these checkpoints: ~anagen, starting from the
moment of activator amplification until anagen termination, and ~telogen, lasting until the next acti-
vator amplification event. In the context of the conventional hair growth cycle, ~anagen incorporates
the late portion of competent telogen and the entire anagen, while ~telogen includes catagen,
refractory telogen and the remainder of competent telogen (Plikus et al., 2011; Plikus and Chuong,
2014; Plikus et al., 2008b) (Appendix 2-Modeling HF phases by concentration difference; Appen-
dix 2—figure 2).
Model simulations produce several emergent behaviors. The cycle becomes autonomous – that
is, it displays stable periodicity and excitability emerges naturally without a built-in ‘clock’
(Figure 1B). Cycling is maintained within a range of parameter values, allowing testing for various
intrinsic and extrinsic signaling scenarios (Figure 1C). Associated with these dynamics are periodic
changes in the system’s geometry – the signaling source in Region II moves cyclically. Simulations
indicate that the moving HF geometry in the model is critical, greatly contributing to the regulation
of the cycle. In a single HF model, activator/inhibitor diffusion occurs only along the HF axis. When a
HF population is modeled, hair-to-hair communication emerges naturally as ligand diffusion from
neighbors supplements intrinsic HF ligand levels. As such, hair cycle pace depends on interactive sig-
naling between neighboring HFs – a feature that we explore below.

 HF cycling emerges from the growth-mediated coupling of activator
and inhibitor
Our model predicts that HF cycling occurs only within a certain range of signal strengths, that is the
excitable regime (Figure 1C, white region). Within this regime, activator and inhibitor are predicted
to inversely modulate duration of both ~telogen and ~anagen phases. At certain, either too high or
too low signal strengths, the excitability is predicted to break down and the HF is expected to enter
a non-cycling state of equilibrium (Figure 1C, grey regions). For example, when inhibitor levels are
very high, the HF is predicted to equilibrate in an extended telogen (Appendix 2—figure 5A), while
extended anagen is predicted for the opposite signaling condition (Appendix 2—figure 5B).
Next, we used bioinformatic and experimental approaches to validate the model’s key prediction
that the same activator or inhibitor pathway can inversely modulate telogen and anagen phase dura-
tion. Considering the established roles for BMP and WNT as respective inhibitor and activator path-
ways regulating telogen duration in the dorsal skin, we explored if they can also regulate anagen
duration in the same skin region in a model-predicted fashion. First, we found that model-predicted
temporal dynamics for inhibitor and activator during ~anagen (Figure 1D and 1E) match the actual
anagen expression dynamics for multiple BMP and WNT pathway members established on a highly
temporally resolved whole-tissue dorsal skin microarray dataset (Lin et al., 2009) (Figure 1D–E’’;
Appendix 1-Identifying model predicted hair cycle activators and inhibitors). We also show that per-
turbing BMP (for details see Appendix 1-Validating model-predicted roles for BMP signaling in hair
cycle control) and WNT in transgenic mice (for details see Appendix 1-Validating model-predicted
roles for WNT signaling in hair cycle control) alters dorsal anagen phase duration and leads to hair
length defects in a way that is consistent with the model’s predictions. Overall, this data shows that
our model generates biologically meaningful outcomes and that its predictive power is robust.
Model reveals skin is a heterogeneous regenerative field
Next, we set out to explore novel aspects of hair regeneration at the population level. For this pur-
pose, we modeled a linear array of HFs (i.e. two-dimensional organization; Appendix 2—figure 4A)
and a grid of HFs (i.e. three-dimensional organization; Appendix 2—figure 4B). In both cases, the
diffusion of activators and inhibitors accompanying each HF during growth naturally led to HF cou-
pling (Appendix 1-Validating model-predicted roles for BMP signaling in hair cycle control) and
emergence of several known features of collective hair growth behavior, including spontaneous ana-
gen initiation and anagen wave spreading (Appendix 2—figures 11, 12). We then focused on the
phenomenon of bilaterally symmetric hair growth that is prominent in young mice (Plikus et al.,
2008b) yet remains unexplained. Conventionally, first anagen in the dorsal skin of newborn mice is
considered synchronous. On the other hand, adult mice display fully asynchronous and asymmetric
dorsal hair growth patterns (Chen et al., 2014; Plikus and Chuong, 2008a; Plikus et al., 2009).
This, however, is preceded by prominent bilateral symmetry, which often persists into the fourth hair
cycle (Plikus and Chuong, 2008a). We now show that in the three-dimensional model where all HFs
are assumed to be identical, full asynchrony evolves within just one cycle, and bilateral symmetry
cannot be achieved (Appendix 2-Dorsal and ventral HF patterns; Appendix 2—figures 11, 12;
Appendix 2—video 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that first anagen is inherently asynchronous as a
result of spatially patterned HF development. Indeed, spatial distribution of early anagen HFs in the
dorsal skin of newborn mice (Figure 2A–D) reveals head-to-tail and subtle lateral-to-medial asyn-
chronies. We modeled the impact of these asynchronies on hair growth pattern evolution. Simula-
tions

patterns;
Appendix 2—figures 14, 15; Appendix 2—video 3); however, it persisted for at least 10 cycles,
which is far more than the 3–4 cycles observable in mice. Moreover, prominent bilateral symmetry
failed to form.
We note that the above and previous simulations (Murray et al., 2012; Plikus et al., 2011) were
performed on homogenous HF populations, where all HFs are assumed to be identical. We then
considered that novel patterns might develop upon interaction of two or more HF populations,
whose activator/inhibitor signaling levels are inherently different. In principle, dorsal skin HFs can
interact with HFs from other body regions, such as ventral skin, where hair cycle dynamics are poten-
tially distinct. Because all skin is continuous and forms an approximation of a cylinder, we modeled it
as an unrolled sheet, where two Ventral sub-domains flank a rectangular Dorsal domain (Figure 2E).

 For initial modeling conditions (Appendix 2-Dorsal and ventral HF patterns), we considered that: (i)
the first cycle on the dorsal skin has built-in head-to-tail asynchrony, and that (ii) ventral HFs develop
with a 3- to 4-day delay relative to dorsal HFs (Appendix 1—figures 7–9). Because ventral HFs are
known to produce distinctly shorter hairs (Candille et al., 2004), in the model we assumed that they
have faster cycle dynamics compared to dorsal HFs (Appendix 2-Changes in the total amount of acti-
vator and inhibitor receptors results in different sensitivity of ~anagen and ~telogen lengths
to signaling changes, Appendix 2-Dorsal and ventral HF patterns; Appendix 2—figures 8,
9). Indeed, in this configuration, our model readily reproduced patterns with aspects of bilateral
symmetry already in the second cycle as the result of dominant waves spreading from the Ventral to
the Dorsal domain (Figure 2F, t68-78.5). Importantly, after the second cycle, the effect of the initial
built-in head-to-tail asynchrony started to disappear. Instead, the interaction between Ventral and
Dorsal HFs continued to produce prominent bilateral symmetry in the third (Figures 2F, t130-145)
and later cycles (Appendix 2—video 4). Taken together, the model predicts that rapid hair growth
pattern evolution requires interaction of two or more skin domains with distinct hair cycle
parameters.
Ventral-dorsal interactions produce bilaterally symmetric hair growth
patterns
Next, we imaged Flash mice, whose luciferase reporter produces skin-specific WNT activity signal
and allows to sensitively and non-invasively determine the location and percentage of anagen HFs
across the entire body (Hodgson et al., 2014) (Figure 3A–C). Luminescence levels were measured
both dorsally and ventrally and mice were followed up until day P119, encompassing up to five hair
growth cycles. Combined analysis from multiple mice reveals prominent phase advancement in ven-
tral over dorsal anagen, specifically during the second, third, and fourth hair cycles (Figure 3B, blue
area). Additionally, the spatial luminescence signal mapping reveals distinct ventral-to-dorsal anagen
propagation with features of bilateral symmetry during second (Figure 3C; Appendix 1—figure 6)
and third cycles (Figure 3C’), supporting the patterning mechanism predicted by the model
(Figure 2F). We also mapped body-wide hair growth patterns on the basis of anagen HF pigmenta-
tion between days P0-P55 (Figure 3D–G; Appendix 1—figures 7–12). This analysis confirms ventral
over dorsal anagen phase advancement starting from the second cycle and provides the following
additional insights:
(i) Ventrally, anagen phase is the shortest in the ‘chin domain’, ending around P10. It is longer in
the ‘ventral domain’ proper, ending in the genital area around P14 and in the chest area around P17
(Figure 3D).
(ii) Dorsally, anagen is the shortest in the ‘cranial domain’, ending around P14. In the ‘dorsal
domain’ proper it ends as a head-to-tail wave between P15-P20 (Figure 3D; Appendix 1—figures
10, 11).
(iii) First ventral telogen is shorter than dorsal telogen. Second anagen initiates in the chin and
ventral domains already between P21-24 and then spreads toward ventral-dorsal boundaries in form
of two bilaterally symmetric waves (Figure 3E; Appendix 1—figure 12). Second anagen also ends
faster in the ventral skin, maintaining ventral-dorsal asynchrony and bilateral symmetry (Figure 3F).
(iv) Third anagen initiates the fastest in the chin domain, as early as P42 (Figures 3G and 4H).
When transplanted onto the back of pigmented SCID mice, chin skin grafts (n = 8) showed faster
cycling compared to dorsal skin grafts (n = 8). While first post-transplantation anagen started with

with higher levels of total available activator and inhibitor receptors, allowing shorter ~anagen and ~telogen duration. Furthermore, hair cycle
asynchrony was introduced into Dorsal domain to model the initial head-to-tail asynchrony. In simulations, interactions between HFs across domain
boundaries result in bilateral symmetry during the second cycle (simulated time t68-78.5). Also, initial asynchrony breaks down in the cycle 3 (t130), and
partial bilateral symmetry maintains into the late cycles (see Appendix 2—video 4). Scale bars: A, A’, D – 5 mm. Images on A, A’ and D are

 similar timing in both chin and dorsal grafts, consecutive anagen started significantly faster in chin
grafts (Figure 3H and I; Appendix 1—figure 13). Furthermore, in many instances, grafts induced
anagen in the surrounding dorsal host skin. Taken together, these data support that dominant ven-
tral-to-dorsal hair wave spreading drives rapid hair growth pattern evolution and bilateral symmetry.
Underlying this behavior are faster hair growth cycle dynamics in chin and ventral HFs, a property
that is partially maintained upon skin grafting.
Next, we asked if faster hair cycle dynamics in chin and ventral domains correlate with distinct
molecular dynamics in putative activators and inhibitors. We performed RNA-seq profiling of whole
skin from chin, ventral and dorsal domains at six hair cycle time points: first (aka competent) telogen,
early anagen, mid-anagen, late anagen, catagen and early second (aka refractory) telogen. Analysis
revealed non-overlapping transcriptomic trajectories of the hair cycle between the three domains
(Figure 4A–B’’) and domain-specific expression patterns for multiple putative activator and inhibitor
genes at all hair cycle time points (Appendix 1—figures 14–19; Dataset 2). We then asked if refrac-
tory properties of early telogen differ between the domains. Differential gene expression analysis
(Figure 4C–D) revealed enrichment in chin and ventral domains for gene ontologies related to mac-
rophage function and lipid storage, and enrichment in chin domain for muscle-related genes
(Figure 4E). Consistently, chin skin shows more contractile cells around HFs, and chin and ventral
skin have thicker dermal adipose tissue and substantially more CD11b+;F4/80+ macrophages as
compared to dorsal skin (Appendix 1—figures 20, 21). Furthermore, dorsal early telogen skin shows
gene expression changes consistent with higher refractivity – it is enriched for several BMP ligands,
and depleted for BMP antagonists and WNT ligands (Figure 4F). Consistently, in Axin2-lacZ WNT
reporter mice, many more HFs with WNT-active DPs are seen in chin and ventral as compared to
dorsal skin at P36 (Figure 4G; Appendix 1—figure 22A). WNT activity increases in dorsal skin to
the levels of ventral skin only by P42 (Figure 4H; Appendix 1—figure 22B). Furthermore, in P42
BRE-gal BMP reporter mice, many more HFs with BMP-active bulges are seen in dorsal as compared
to chin and ventral skin (Figure 4I; Appendix 1—figure 22C). In Krt14-Wnt7a mice, spontaneous
anagen initiation sites in dorsal skin overrun ventral-to-dorsal wave dominance (Figure 4J; Appen-
dix 1—figure 23). In contrast, in Krt14-Bmp4 mice, ventral-dorsal hair growth waves stall and asym-
metric anagen patches form instead (Figure 4K). Together, this data confirms that lower refractivity
and the underlying differences in BMP and WNT activities form the bases for ventral-dorsal hair
growth dominance.
Ear pinna behaves as a hyper-refractory skin domain
Our model also predicts conditions when hair cycling stops and HFs equilibrate in an extended telo-
gen, such as due to high levels of inhibitors (Appendix 2-Hyper-refractory domain; Appendix 2—fig-
ure 5A, 16). We profiled mouse skin for the existence of such behavior and found ears to match
such prediction. In the ear skin, HF morphogenesis begins between days P2-P4, and HFs remain in
anagen until about P15 (Figure 5A). After first anagen, and for at least three months, they remain in
an extended telogen, while at the same time dorsal HFs have already reached their third cycle
(Figure 5B and C). Seldom, solitary anagen HFs can be found, but no coordinated hair growth
waves, characteristic to other skin regions, are observed (Figure 5B, day P95). Moreover, anagen
waves spreading from cranial skin could not propagate into ear skin (Figure 7E). These observations
are consistent with the possibility that ear skin is hyper-refractory. Next, we examined ear HFs’
responses to several potent anagen inducers: cyclosporin A (Maurer et al., 1997; Paus et al.,
1989), smoothened agonist (SAG) (Paladini et al., 2005) and hair plucking (Chen et al., 2015). We
show that while dorsal telogen HFs readily respond to cyclosporin A (Appendix 1—figure 27B), ear
HFs remain quiescent even 3 weeks after treatment (Figure 5F). Anagen can be induced in response
to SAG; however, this response occurs late, after 3 weeks, and remains restricted to the medial side
of the ear (Figure 5E). This is contrasted by rapid SAG-induced anagen in dorsal skin (Appendix 1—

 figure 27A). Plucking induces anagen along the medial side of the ear; however, there is no anagen
wave spreading into the unplucked region, a feature common in dorsal skin (Chen et al., 2015)
(Figure 5D; Appendix 1—figures 25A-B, 26). Furthermore, whole ear plucking experiments reveal
very sparse anagen activation along the lateral side (Appendix 1—figure 25C). These data demon-
strate that physiologically, adult ear HFs equilibrate in a hyper-refractory telogen state, yet in princi-
ple remain capable of regenerative cycling in response to selective external stimuli.
To understand how ear HF hyper-refractivity relates to activator and inhibitor signaling lev-
els, we compared on RNA-seq refractory telogen dorsal skin with telogen ear skin and, addi-
tionally, cartilage/muscle complex, a structure unique to ears. We show that, transcriptionally,
these three tissue types are distinct (Figure 6A), containing large number of differentially
expressed genes (Figure 6B; Dataset 3) enriched for distinct gene ontologies (Figure 6C).
Analysis of the signaling pathways implicated in the hair cycle control revealed a number of
differentially expressed WNT and BMP pathway ligands and antagonists (Figure 6D). Compared
to dorsal skin, ear skin is enriched for transcripts for several WNT antagonists, including Dkkl1,

(Matsumura et al., 2016). Cartilage/muscle complex is prominently enriched for Bmp5, and
multiple WNT antagonists, including Frzb, Sfrp2, Sfrp5 and Wif1. Additionally, it showed upre-
gulated expression of other known hair cycle inhibitors Fgf18 (Kimura-Ueki et al., 2012;
Leishman et al., 2013) and Ctgf (Liu and Leask, 2013).
We validated WNT and BMP changes from RNA-seq by studying relevant pathway reporters and
measuring changes in ear hair cycling in mutant mouse models. Using Axin2-lacZ reporter mice, we
show isolated sites of WNT activity in ear skin dermis, and a lack of activity in telogen HFs as well as
in the cartilage and muscle (Figure 6G and G’). Using BRE-gal reporter mice, we show high levels of
BMP activity in telogen ear HFs (in the bulge), as well as in the cartilage and muscle (Figure 6F and
F’). Overexpression of the BMP antagonist Noggin in Krt14-Noggin mice partially rescued the
hyper-refractory state – substantially more spontaneous anagen HFs can be found in Krt14-Noggin
ears as compared to wild-type control (Figure 6H and H’; Appendix 1—figure 28B, D). Wnt7a over-
expression in Krt14-Wnt7a mice also reactivated anagen in ear skin, albeit to a lesser extent com-
pared to Noggin overexpression (Figure 6H’’; Appendix 1—figure 28C, D). Together, these results
support that hyper-refractivity of ear HFs depends on higher levels of BMP ligands and WNT antago-
nists, in part produced by the cartilage/muscle complex (Figure 6E).
Hair growth waves distort around hyper-refractory and hairless skin
regions
Lastly, our model predicts that hair growth waves can form distorted patterns around non-propagat-
ing skin regions, such as hyper-refractory hair-bearing skin or hairless skin (Figure 7A and B; Appen-
dix 2-Hyper-refractory domain and Wave breaker; Appendix 2—figure 17; Appendix 2—video 5).
We considered that pattern distortion could occur in the cranial skin at the boundaries with hyper-
refractory ears and eyelids – naturally occurring physical breaks in the skin. Indeed, we observe that
hair growth waves prominently break around the eyelids and ears – anagen waves propagate faster
through the hair-bearing skin around the eyelids and ears, and then distort into the spaces in front

at P36, but increases by P42. (I) Analysis of P42 BRE-gal skin shows that many more dorsal HFs have BMP-active bulges as compared to chin and ventral

 of these anatomical structures (Figure 7C and E). Similar patterns are also observed for the ventral-
to-dorsal hair growth wave around the limbs (Figure 7D). We conclude that distortions of hair
growth waves around anatomical structures with temporary or permanent non-propagating proper-
ties contribute to rapid body-wide hair growth pattern evolution.

 Discussion
Growth-regulated parallel signaling makes the HF an excitable medium
Previous mathematical models have recapitulated cycling of a single HF (Al-Nuaimi et al., 2012;
Halloy et al., 2000) or in HF populations in two dimensions (Murray et al., 2012; Plikus et al.,
2011). Here, we developed a multiscale model where coupling of activator and inhibitor signals with
the movements of a HF in a three-dimensional space simulates cyclic growth and communication
between neighboring HFs. In a single HF regime, our model faithfully predicts the effects that
changes in WNT and BMP signaling can exert on the length of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.

model produces simulations with distorted anagen spreading wave front (green). (C, E) Distortions in the geometry of hair growth waves are commonly
seen in the head region at the boundaries with the hyper-refractory ears and eyelids, the physical breaks in the skin. Seldom, similar distorted patterns
can be seen around limb skin (D). Hair growth patterns on C-E are accompanied by color-coded schematic drawings. Colors are defined at the bottom.
Hair growth distortion patterns shown were documented in ten mice each.

 Similar to the FHN generic excitable media model (Murray et al., 2012), our model also recapitu-
lates several known population-level features of the HF system such as spontaneous hair growth initi-
ation and hair wave spreading. Importantly, however, only our model allows incorporation of
differential HF growth in space, a feature required for simulating heterogeneous skin properties
such as interactions between skin domains with different hair cycle frequencies or the hair wave dis-
tortion effect. Thus, while the multiscale nature and non-linearity make our model more difficult to
derive analytical results, its heterogeneous domain feature allows studying complex skin-wide hair
growth dynamics (see Appendix 2-Comparison with FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model).
HF morphogenesis across mouse skin is spatially asynchronous
Hair growth in newborn mice is commonly thought to occur simultaneously across the entire skin. In
fact, we show that the first cycle is already distinctly patterned: at birth, anagen HFs in dorsal skin
have head-to-tail and lateral-to-medial asynchronies, while first anagen entry by ventral HFs is
delayed by approximately 3 days and proceeds as a concentric lateral-to-midline wave. Similarly
delayed by 6 days are ear HFs. First anagen naturally follows the process of HF morphogenesis,
which is known to be temporarily asynchronous, and to occur, at least in the dorsal skin, in three suc-
cessive waves (reviewed in Clavel et al., 2012). Pattern-wise, development of HFs relies on reaction-
diffusion (Sick et al., 2006) and on space-filling expansion-induction mechanisms (Cheng et al.,
2014). Importantly, models for both mechanisms assume spatially synchronous HF morphogenesis.
Our findings of spatial asynchrony of the first anagen indicate spatial asynchrony of HF morphogene-
sis. Future studies will be required to understand the modeling and signaling aspects of such
phenomenon.
Hair cycle patterns evolve from the interaction of heterogeneous skin
domains
Our data reveal prominent regional differences in hair cycle dynamics and show that interaction
between HFs across domain boundaries drives rapid evolution of complex hair growth patterns. Spe-
cifically, we show that during early postnatal cycles, chin and ventral domains become the dominant
sources of skin-wide anagen waves. Such dominant behavior of chin and ventral domains is accom-
panied by distinct activity dynamics for WNT and BMP, putative hair cycle activators and inhibitors,
respectively. Transgenic mouse studies further confirm the functional importance of differential WNT
and BMP activities in setting distinct hair growth pace across discrete anatomical skin regions.
Admittedly, an in-depth follow-up study will be necessary to identify and verify the major site-spe-
cific cellular sources for WNT and BMP ligands and antagonists.
We also show that ear skin behaves as a hyper-refractory domain, where telogen HFs are resistant
to anagen-inducing stimuli and cannot participate in hair growth wave propagation. We reveal that
such hyper-refractivity relates to high levels of BMP ligands and WNT antagonists, in part produced
by the cartilage/muscle complex, a structure unique to the ear skin. Thus, novel behaviors can be
produced by the cooption of signals from new tissue modules, rather than by the modification of
preexisting ones. This finding parallels the modulatory effects of non-HF cell types on the dorsal skin
hair cycle, including adipose progenitors (Festa et al., 2011; Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2016), mature
adipocytes (Plikus et al., 2008b), and resident macrophages (Castellana et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2015). Finally, we show that anatomically defined structures that cannot propagate hair growth
waves, namely ears and eyelids, can generate a ‘wave-breaker’ effect. Similar distortion effects are
likely to occur around other anatomical structures, such as the tail and genitals, and around skin
defects, such as scars, and can jointly contribute to rapid hair growth pattern evolution.
Taken together, our study reveals that the skin as a whole functions as a complex regenerative
landscape with regions of fast, slow, and very slow hair renewal (Appendix 1—figure 29). We show
that this behavior produces a fur coat with variable hair density, which likely serves an adaptive role,
such as in thermoregulation. Mechanistically, we show that the WNT/BMP activator/inhibitor signal-
ing pair modulates hair regeneration in all skin regions studied. This suggests that the WNT/BMP
‘molecular language’ for hair growth is general, rather than a special case for a specific body site. Its
generality allows for hair-to-hair communications to arise across anatomic domain boundaries, which,
in turn, enables novel hair growth dynamics not obvious from prior work – fast cycling skin regions
(such as chin skin) function as a kind of hair growth pacemaker. Furthermore, our findings on ear hair

 cycle expand the repertoire of tissues with signaling macro-environment function to include any
closely-positioned anatomic structures with signaling properties, such as cartilage.
We posit that some of the newly found hair regeneration features can have analogs in other
organs. For instance, dominant anatomically defined pacemakers are common in the electrically cou-
pled muscle-based tissues, including heart and stomach, where they generate directional contractile
rhythmicity. Other actively regenerating organs, such as the intestines and bone marrow, can likely
contain anatomic regions of faster and slower regeneration and, conceivably, they can be coupled
to work in coordination. Knowledge learned from the skin system in the current study can guide the
search for regenerative landscapes in these and other organs. Because coordination principles
observed in the skin may be universal, the likelihood of them operating in other organs is substantial
despite prominent anatomical differences.
Materials and methods
Computational modeling
The modeling framework is based on a hybrid approach, with individual HFs modeled as an expand-
ing or contracting one-dimensional line and with the diffusive molecules described in reaction-diffu-
sion equations (Appendix 2, Equations 1–4). The latter are solved using a finite difference scheme
with the standard central difference approximation on the diffusion (see Appendix 2-1-dimensional
(1D) HF model to Numerical methods in Appendix 2).
Experimental mouse models
Krt14-Noggin (Plikus et al., 2004, 2005), Krt14-Bmp4 (Guha et al., 2004), Krt14-Cre;Wnt7bfl/fl
(Kandyba and Kobielak, 2014), Krt14-Wnt7a (Plikus et al., 2011), Krt5-rtTA;tetO-Dkk1 (Chu et al.,
2004), 220bpMsx2-hsplacZ reporter (Brugger et al., 2004), BRE(Bmp response element)-gal BMP
reporter (Javier et al., 2012), Axin2-lacZ (Lustig et al., 2002), and Flash WNT reporter mice
(Hodgson et al., 2014) were used. For Dkk1 induction, P30 Krt5-rtTA;tetO-Dkk1 mice were placed
on 2 mg/ml Doxycycline-containing water ab libitum, and skin was collected at P44 for histology and
at P50 for hair length measurements.
Skin grafting
5 � 5 mm skin grafts from chin and dorsal domains of P21 C57BL/6J male mice were transplanted
onto the dorsum of gender-matched pigmented P50 SCID recipients. At the time of grafting, donor
skin was in first telogen and recipient skin was in second telogen.
Hair plucking
In dorsal skin, club hairs were plucked from 5 � 5 mm areas. In the ear pinna, plucking was done on
the caudal skin. For quantitative plucking, approximately 500 club hairs we plucked along the medial
ear side.
Topical drug treatment
Cyclosporin A: for the dorsal skin, 100 ul of Cyclosporin A solution (1, 5, and 10 mg/ml) was applied
topically once a day for 7 days. For the ear pinna, caudal skin was treated with 100 ul of 10 mg/ml of
Cyclosporin A once a day for 7 days. Smoothened agonist (SAG): for the dorsal skin, 120 uM of SAG
in DMSO/acetone was applied topically once a day for 4 days as described (Paladini et al., 2005).
For the ear pinna, caudal skin was treated with 25 ul of SAG solution once a day for 4 days.
Hair length measurements and club hair counting
Guard, awl, auchene and zigzag club hair types were photographed, traced and calibrated using
Adobe Illustrator software. See Appendix 1—table 1. Club hair density was evaluated on whole-
mount telogen skin samples that were pre-treated with 1 mg/mL Collagenase/Dispase and counter-
stained with hematoxylin.

 Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histology was performed on 4% PFA-fixed sections. For BRE-gal and Axin2-lacZ specimens, whole
mount lacZ staining was performed first followed by histology. The primary antibodies used were
rabbit anti-keratin Krt5 (1:250, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-perilipin (1:750; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-a
SMA (1:200; Abcam). Actin was detected with phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes).
Whole mount in vivo bioluminescence imaging
Whole body imaging of Flash mice was performed as previously described (Hodgson et al., 2014).
Briefly, mice were injected with 150 mg/kg of firefly D-luciferin substrate and imaged with the Xeno-
gen IVIS Spectrum system.
FACS and analysis
Second telogen skin from C57BL/6J male mice was treated with Dispase to separate epidermis from
dermis. Epidermis was digested with Accutase and dermis with Collagenase. Epidermal and dermal
cell suspensions were combined and stained with anti-CD11b (eBioscience) and anti-F4/80 antibod-
ies (eBioscience). Due to small tissue size, chin skin cells from three mice were combined for each
experiment. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo.
RNA-sequencing and analyses
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples with RIN >8.0 were con-
sidered for cDNA library preparation. Full-length cDNA library amplification and tagmentation was
performed as previously described (Picelli et al., 2014). Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced
as paired-end on an Illumina Next-Seq500 platform. Paired-end reads were aligned to the mouse
genome (mm10/gencode.vM8) and quantified using the RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization algo-
rithm (RSEM) with standard parameters (version 1.2.25) (Li and Dewey, 2011). Samples were batch-
effect corrected. EdgeR (version 3.14.0) was employed to identify differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) across samples of interest. FPKM values were taken as inputs for PCA analysis and DEG anal-
yses. Data is available at GEO: GSE85039.

Experimental: A multi-scale model for hair follicles reveals
heterogeneous domains driving rapid spatiotemporal hair
growth patterning
Identifying model predicted hair cycle activators and inhibitors
To find out which signaling pathway activities fit the temporal dynamics of activator and
inhibitor predicted by the model (Figure 1D and E), we examined a highly temporally
resolved whole-skin microarray dataset, which includes nine consecutive time points: five for
anagen, three for catagen, and one for telogen (Lin et al., 2009). We identified two sets of
236 and 122 genes whose temporal dynamics recapitulate those of the simulated activator
(Figure 1D’ and D’’) and inhibitor signals (Figure 1E’ and E’’; Dataset S1), respectively.
Focusing on major signaling pathways, we show that multiple members of WNT and BMP
are represented in each gene set. The putative activator set includes WNT ligands (Wnt2,
Wnt9a, Wnt7b), soluble WNT activator r-Spondin1, multiple WNT-specific Tcf transcription
factors, and soluble BMP antagonists, Follistatin and Sostdc1. The putative inhibitor set
includes multiple BMP ligands (Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6, Bmp7), BMP receptors (Bmpr1a,
Bmpr1b and Bmpr2), BMP-specific transcription factors (Smad2, Smad5 and Smad7), and
soluble (Wif1, Sfrp1), transmembrane (Kremen1), and intracellular WNT antagonists (Nkd2,
Prickle1).
Validating model-predicted roles for BMP signaling in hair cycle
control
For BMP signaling, we examined Krt14-Bmp4 (Guha et al., 2004) and Krt14-Noggin mice
(Plikus et al., 2004, 2005) overexpressing BMP ligand and soluble antagonist, respectively.
Consistent with the notion of BMP acting as anagen inhibitor, Krt14-Bmp4 mice show
shortened pelage, prominently on their ears, tail, and paws, and partial baldness on the
trunk (Appendix 1—figure 1A, 2). Fully grown dorsal hairs in Krt14-Bmp4 are significantly
shorter compared to control across all hair types by 35–47% (p<0.05) (Appendix 1—figure
1B). This is accompanied by the shortened anagen duration as established by histology on
day P15 (Appendix 1—figure 3B). In contrast, Krt14-Noggin mice show a general increase
in hairiness, prominent on their ears, tail, and paws (Appendix 1—figure 1A, 2), and
significantly longer than WT dorsal hairs: 12% longer for guard (p<0.01) and 7% longer for
auchene type (p<0.01) (Appendix 1—figure 1B). In parallel, we observe longer anagen
phase duration as revealed by histology on day P19 (Appendix 1—figure 3A). Hair length
changes in Krt14-Noggin mice were not statistically significant for the zigzag and awl types.
Validating model-predicted roles for WNT signaling in hair cycle
control
For WNT signaling, we examined Krt14-Cre;Wnt7bfl/fl (Kandyba and Kobielak, 2014) and Krt5-
rtTA;tetO-Dkk1 mice (Choi et al., 2013), with constitutive skin-specific deletion of the WNT
ligand Wnt7b and conditional overexpression of the soluble WNT antagonist Dkk1,
respectively. Wnt7b follows model-predicted activator expression pattern (Figure 1D’’) and
consistent with the previous report (Kandyba and Kobielak, 2014), Wnt7b-deficient mice
display short first anagen (Appendix 1—figure 5A) and short pelage (Appendix 1—figure
4A’, B’). We now show that, intriguingly, during the following hair growth cycle, Krt14-Cre;
Wnt7bfl/fl mice compensate for the initial defect (Appendix 1—figure 4A), and hair length
increases between cycles by an average of 22% (p<0.05) (Appendix 1—figure 4B, B’). In
Krt5-rtTA;tetO-Dkk1 mice, induction of Dkk1 overexpression during telogen prominently

 blocks HFs in an extended telogen (Choi et al., 2013) – a scenario equivalent to ‘Equilibrium
II’ in our model (Figure 1C). Induction of Dkk1 overexpression during anagen leads to early
anagen termination (Appendix 1—figure 5B) and shortened hairs (Appendix 1—figure
4A’’, B’’). Compared to control, club hairs in Krt5-rtTA;tetO-Dkk1 mice across all four types
shorten by 22–25% (p<0.05). Taken together, our modeling and experiments confirm that
WNT and BMP serve as a core hair cycle activator/inhibitor pair, affecting both telogen and
anagen phase timing.

 Appendix 2
Modeling: A multi-scale model for hair follicles reveals
heterogeneous domains driving rapid spatiotemporal hair
growth patterning
1-dimensional (1D) HF model
Geometry of a hair follicle
The 1D HF model is on a computation domain along the z-axis: z 2 ½Z; 0� (Appendix 2—figure
1). HF growth, characterized by elongation of the bottom part of the HF, ranges in a region
½hmin; hmax� � ½Z; 0�. Region I is the bulge region, which does not move associatively with HF
growth, and is located at ½hI; hI þ dI�. Region II includes HG and DP during telogen, or matrix
and DP during anagen. Region II is the bottom region of the HF, hence it constantly moves
in association with HF growth. Computationally, Region II is located at ½hðtÞ; hðtÞ þ dII�, where
hðtÞ marks the bottom tip of the HP. We have the following relation: hmin ¼ hI � dII.
Equations for activators and inhibitors
The dynamical system consists of the diffusion of activator (ActL) and inhibitor ligands (InhL), the
reactions between ligands and receptors of the same species, where ActR/InhR denotes the
free activator/inhibitor receptors; and ActLR/InhLR, which denotes the activator/inhibitor
ligand-bound receptors. We assume that the total amount of free and bound receptors for
either activator or inhibitor are preserved at any z-level, i.e.,
½ActR�ðz;tÞ þ ½ActLR�ðz;tÞ � RA
tot;
½InhR�ðz;tÞ þ ½InhLR�ðz;tÞ � RI
tot
The dynamical system includes the following equations:

Modeled HF growth relies on DðtÞ, subject to the following rules: during telogen, HF rests at
its minimum length, meanwhile D progressively increases; once D exceeds a certain
threshold Dþ at very late telogen, the activator senses it and amplifies its own production
(i.e. positive feedback). The latter results in a quick increase in D, which in turn induces
anagen initiation and HF growth toward its maximal length. At that point in time, inhibitor
starts to accumulate while activator degrades, leading to a decrease of D. Once D deceases
back to D� ¼ 0 (i.e., activator and inhibitor levels balance out), HF starts to involute toward
its original minimal length. In other words, HF completes its cycle and returns to telogen
(Appendix 2—figure 2). There are two critical time points associated with these dynamics:
tþ, the moment when D reaches Dþ and activator production amplifies; and t�, the moment
of anagen termination, when D decreases back to D�. On these bases, we divided modeled
hair growth cycle into two phases: the period from a tþ to its following t� and referred to as

 ~ anagen, which includes very late competent telogen (C) and the full of anagen — both
propagating (P) and autonomous anagen (A); and the period from a t� to the next tþ is
referred to as ~ telogen, which includes catagen (Cat), refractory (R) telogen and most of
competent telogen (Appendix 2—figure 2).
Modeling the production of ligands
The production rates of ActL and InhL are modeled in relative to the follicle growth hðtÞ based
on experimental observation presented in Appendix 2—table 4, where we qualitatively
evaluate the activity strengths of activator/inhibitor ligands (L), antagonists (A), receptors (R),
and ligand-bound receptors (LR), in region I and region II during different phases within a
full HF cycle.
We simplify our model by eliminating the antagonist (A in Appendix 2—table 4), and
estimate the net ligand production rate using the following formula:
NetProductionRate ¼L � A þ LR
2
(8)
where the values of L, A and LR are from Appendix 2—table 4, depending on the phase of
hair growth. Appendix 2—figure 3A shows the temporal pattern estimated from the above
equation, produced by data from Appendix 2—table 4.
The production rates of activator (IA) and inhibitor (II) are given by the following equations:

reasonable.
The parameter values are given in Appendix 2—table 5.
Modeling of HF growth
hðtÞ gives the location of the bottom tip of the follicle, thus �hðtÞ ¼ jhðtÞj gives the length of the
follicle. hðtÞ is modeled as follows, with parameter values given in Appendix 2—table 5:
1. A follicle has a minimum length �hmin ¼ �hI þ dII (i.e., the length of the follicle during
telogen): hðtÞ � hmin.
2. Upon tþ, the follicle starts growing:

until it returns to the minimum length �hmin.

2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) HF models
The dynamics of 2D and 3D HF models are the same as the 1D HF model; however, in the 1D
model we are considering a single HF in a computation domain of ½Z; 0�, whereas in the 2D
and 3D models we consider an array of HFs in a computation domain of ½0; X� � ½Z; 0�
(Appendix 2—figure 4A) and of ½0; X� � ½0; Y� � ½Z; 0� (Appendix 2—figure 4B), respectively.

Parameter values used in 2D and 3D simulations are given in Appendix 2—table 1 - 3, 5.
Numerical methods
In 1D and 2D model, we use implicit finite difference to discretize the diffusion term and
forward Euler methods to discretize the production and reaction terms. For example, the
discretized equation of Appendix 2-Equation (1) is in the form of

2-Equation (1). It is unconditionally stable, and the truncation error is OðDtÞ þ OðDx2Þ in 1D,
or d ~ OðDtÞ þ OðDx2Þ þ OðDy2Þ in 2D.
In 3D model, implicit finite difference method is not practical, since it requires solution of a
system of Nx � Ny � Nz equations. Instead we use explicit finite difference method. The
truncation error is d ~ OðDtÞ þ OðDx2Þ þ OðDy2Þ þ OðDz2Þ. To make this method stable, we
require that

 For the discretization parameter values we used in simulations (Appendix 2—table 3), we
have n ~ 0:13, which satisfies the stability requirement.
Effects of noise on HF dynamics
As we discussed in the main text, cycling occurs only within a range of signal strengths
(Figure 1C, white region), and when activator/inhibitor signals are either too strong or too
weak (Figure 1C, grey regions), HF reaches a stable equilibrium state and fails to cycle.
When inhibitor is very strong or activator is very weak, the signal difference threshold
required for spontaneous excitation cannot be reached (Appendix 2—figure 5A), and HF
equilibrates in a prolonged telogen-like state. On the other hand, when inhibitor is very low,
it fails to catch up with the activator, and HF equilibrates in a prolonged anagen-like state
instead (Appendix 2—figure 5B).
Within the excitable region on which the HF can cycle, we used noise-free model to show
the effects of signal levels on ~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths: higher inhibitor level results
in shorter ~ anagen and longer ~ telogen (Figure 1C, yellow and magenta lines).
Qualitatively similar results were also obtained in the stochastic regime with multiplicative
noise in both activator and inhibitor signaling (Appendix 2—figure 6A).
We investigate how noise in signaling might affect the HF growth by adding multiplicative
noise with different strengths in both activator and inhibitor signaling. Simulations show that
strong signaling noise shortens the average length of both ~ anagen and ~ telogen, and at
the same time, increases their variability (Appendix 2—figure 6B). This is interesting,
although not surprising, because both ~ anagen and ~ telogen checkpoints are largely
determined by the differential level between the activator and inhibitor signals. Stronger
noise is likely to increase the probability of the signal reaching the critical differential level,
advancing HFs to the next phase - an irreversible process.
Next we repeat the above simulations with additive noise instead. With additive noise
added to both activator and inhibitor LR equations, ~ anagen is shortened while ~ telogen is
extended, the same as Appendix 2—figure 6A Appendix 2—figure 6B. However, the
change of Std of additive noise is not as much as when it is from multiplicative noise
(Appendix 2—figure 6C,D). On the other hand, for medium inhibitor level but different
noise strength, stronger additive noise also leads to shorter ~ anagen and ~ telogen, but the
change is not as large as it is for multiplicative noise - mostly due to the reason that we
choose same noise strength lA and lI for both multiplicative and additive noise to make a
comparison, in which case multiplicative noise would cause bigger effects on the activator
and inhibitor levels.
Finally we would like to point out that we use multiplicative noise in all 2D and 3D
simulations. However, if additive noise is adopted instead, the results will not change
essentially. For example, we repeat the simulation of interaction between dorsal and ventral
HF waves with additive noise having strength lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:05. Similar to that with
multiplicative noise (Figure 2F), interaction between dorsal and ventral HF waves last for
two cycles, then breaks into more stochastic waves with bilateral symmetry (Appendix 2—
figure 7).
Changes in the total amount of activator and inhibitor receptors
results in different sensitivity of ~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths to
signaling changes
While higher inhibitor levels or lower activator levels always result in shorter ~ anagen and
~ telogen, we find that by altering certain background parameter values, HF may achieve
different sensitivity to such signal changes. One such pair of parameters we find is the total
amount of activator and inhibitor receptors (RA
tot and RI
tot).

 We investigate ~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths with either both low amounts of activator
and inhibitor receptors (RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 6), or both high amounts (RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 60). The result is
shown in Appendix 2—figure 8. First, under the same signaling levels, high RA
tot and RI
tot
always result in both short ~ anagen and ~ telogen. This difference between receptor levels
in ventral and dorsal domains was used in the 3D modeling of HF wave interactions across
dorsal and ventral domains (see Appendix 2-Dorsal and ventral HF patterns); as shown by
experimental observations, ventral HFs have both shorter anagen and telogen than dorsal
HFs. Next, these two modeling HF types also show different sensitivity to inhibitor signaling
changes. When the receptor levels are both low, both ~ anagen and ~ telogen phases react
more dramatically to changes in signaling (Appendix 2—figure 8A,B, solid bars). For
instance, after the same net increase in the inhibitor ligand value, simulated ~ anagen phase
decreased by ~ 16 days and ~ telogen phase increased by ~ 23.8 days under low RA
tot and
RI
tot regime. However, under high RA
tot and RI
tot regime, ~ anagen phase decreased by ~ 6.4
days and ~ telogen phase increased by ~ 14.8 days. Appendix 2—figure 8C,D exemplifies
changes in activator/inhibitor LR profiles and accompanying changes in HF growth dynamics
under low RA
tot and RI
tot regime, while Appendix 2—figure 8E,F under high RA
tot and RI
tot
regime. Based on this, we speculate that higher RA
tot and RI
tot abundance confers HFs with
better ability to read out signal changes, and increases the robustness of ~ anagen and
~ telogen durations.
We also explore all four possible combinations of low vs. high activator and inhibitor
profiles. From the results in Appendix 2—figure 9 we see that each combination gives
different ~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths, and that each combination results in different
sensitivity to inhibitor level changes.
Possible interactions between the activator and inhibitor pathways
do not qualitatively alter the HF dynamics
In our model the temporal patterns of activator and/or inhibitor ligand activities are dependent
on HF growth, which is based on experimental observation. This is a phenomenological
description, part of which may come out from any interaction between the pathways.
Recently, Kandyba et al. (2013) discovered the inhibition from BMP (inhibitor) to WNT
(activator); other than this, so far there is no solid support that other interactions between
activator and inhibitor exist. We incorporate this inhibitory interaction into our model in two
ways:
1. the inhibitor LR inhibits the ligand-receptor binding of activator (Appendix 2—figure
10A):

or
2. the inhibitor ligands inhibits the production of activator ligands (Appendix 2—figure

(15)
However, in either way, please be aware that the original model which gives the
phenomenological description already involves possibly existing interactions, and adding
such an inhibitory feedback only enhances the effect.
In either Appendix 2-Equation (14) or (15), we run simulations with m ¼ 2; bI ¼ �4 for a
wide range of a, where small/large a corresponds to weak/strong inhibition of the inhibitor

 (BMP) to the activator (WNT), with a ¼ 0 indicating that the inhibition does not exist, and the
dynamics return to Appendix 2-Equation (1-4). Simulation results show that in either mode
of inhibition, ~ anagen length will decrease and ~ telogen length will increase.
(Appendix 2—figure 10C,D). Moreover, as the inhibition becomes stronger, ~ anagen
length quickly reaches a minimum (Appendix 2—figure 10C,D, green lines); however,
~ telogen length increases gradually (Appendix 2—figure 10C,D, red lines). Observing the
dynamical patterns of HF growth and activator and inhibitor LR, we find that when the
inhibition is extremely strong, the inhibition of the inhibitor to the activator push the
activator LR almost flat (Appendix 2—figure 10E, green line), while the inhibitor LR still
shows the hill-valley pattern (Appendix 2—figure 10E, red line).
When the activator is inhibited, a single HF is still able to present three dynamic regimes
upon changes of signal levels: an excitable one and two equilibrium ones, the same as in
Figure 1C. Appendix 2—figure 10F gives the profile of the excitable regime, from which
we see that the dynamics react to inhibitor levels in a same way as before, with the only
difference that the excitable regime requires a weaker inhibitor level now: bI 2 ½�13; �4�
with the inhibitory feedback in L-R binding with a strength a ¼ 10, compared to bI 2 ½�9; 0:5�
without any feedback (Figure 1C).
2D and 3D modeling details
Dorsal and ventral HF patterns
It is observed on mouse dorsal skin that during the first 2-to-3 cycles, synchronized anagen
waves propagate from head to tail, followed by more spontaneous, asynchronous waves
from the fourth cycle onwards, while still showing some bilateral symmetry. To study the
cause of such patterns, we propose four scenarios. The first three of them consider a
uniform HF domain simulating the dorsal domain only, and they are simulated by both the
2D and 3D models. The fourth scenario involves interactions between different HF domains:
that is simulating the interactions between dorsal and ventral domains; hence, it is only
simulated in the 3D model. Below we list certain modeling details of the 3D simulations, with
the 2D simulations designed in similar ways:
1. Consider only the dorsal domain, where all HFs have equal probability of anagen
initiation. To simulate this scenario, we consider on a 60 � 100 domain, we add multiplicative
noise terms sA and sI (lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:035) to the activator and inhibitor LR Appendix 2-
Equations (3, 4) (Appendix 2—figure 11 for 2D, Appendix 2—figure 12 and
Appendix 2—video 1 for 3D simulation). In this case, we see spontaneous HF waves from
the very first cycle without any bilateral symmetry.
2. Consider only the dorsal domain, where HFs near the head have higher built-in levels of
activator signaling. Again we simulate this scenario on a 60 � 100 domain, adding
multiplicative noise terms sA and sI (lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:02) to the activator and inhibitor LR
Appendix 2-Equations (3, 4). To simulate the built-in high level of activator near head, for
all HFs on the top row (y ¼ 100), we give them constant increase in their activator production
(IA ! IA þ 50). In addition, we set a small threshold Dþ (Dþ ¼ 1:8) for anagen activation
(Appendix 2—figure 13, Appendix 2—video 2). In this case, wee see highly successive
wave patterns steadily propagate from head to tail, which may last for many cycles. This
scenario is referred to as ’target pattern’ (Murray et al., 2012).
3. Consider only the dorsal domain, where HFs near the head have built-in temporal phase
advancement. To simulate this scenario, for all HFs on the top row (y ¼ 100), we give a one
time increase (at t ¼ 0:1) in the activator production (IA ! IA þ 3000). The noise terms are the
same as in the first scenarios (lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:035). In both 2D and 3D simulations, the first few
waves steadily propagate from head to tail (Appendix 2—figure 14 for 2D, Appendix 2—
figure 15 and Appendix 2—video 3 for 3D simulations). Spontaneous initiations gradually

 show up in later waves. However, the initial head-to-tail wave pattern persists for at least 10
consecutive cycles despite constant disruption from spontaneous initiations, which violates
biological observation where the steady head-to-tail pattern breaks down as early as the
third wave. Moreover, 3D simulation shows no bilateral symmetry.
4. Finally we consider the scenario where dorsal HFs interact with ventral HFs, where dorsal
HFs near the head have built-in temporal phase advancement than other dorsal HFs.
Moreover, the first anagen entrance of ventral HFs occurs later than in dorsal HFs, and
ventral HFs have shorter anagen and telogen phases. We consider a 100 � 100 domain,
where the 60 � 100 area in the middle is to simulate the dorsal domain, with its HFs having
less available receptors (RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 15) resulting in longer anagen and telogen; the two
side-domains, each with a size of 20 � 100 simulate the ventral domain, which flank the
dorsal domain and are connected via periodic boundary condition, and HFs in them have
more available receptors (RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 50). In the beginning, for all HFs on the top row in the
dorsal domain (20 � x � 80; y ¼ 100), we give a one time increase in the activator production
(IA ! IA þ 1000), and we block the growth of ventral HFs by setting all HF length h ¼ hmin in
these areas during t � 14. Multiplicative noise terms sA and sI (lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:02) are added to
the activator and inhibitor LR Appendix 2-Equations (3, 4). In this case, we see wave
patterns similar to those in our biological observations, shown in Figure 2F and
Appendix 2—video 4 and discussed in the main text.
Hyper-refractory domain
In studying the ear pinna skin behaving as hyper-refractory HF domain, we model two
phenomena: 1) the high level of inhibitor in ear skin results in hair cycling termination, and
HFs equilibrate in an extended telogen; 2) anagen waves spreading from dorsal skin could
not propagate into the ear skin due to its hyper-refractory state.
We model the first phenomenon on a 100 � 100 domain, with parameter values given in
Appendix 2—table 1 (3D dorsal column), 1 and 5, except Dþ ¼ 3, lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:05, a1
I ¼ 22
and
bAðtÞ ¼ 2 þ
1:8
t þ 0:2
(16)
Noise is able to randomly initiate the first HF growth cycle, but the high inhibitor levels
prevent HF wave propagating, and no other HF cycles appear, HFs stay in an extended
telogen (Appendix 2—figure 16).
For the second phenomenon, that is no HF wave propagating from dorsal skin into the ear
skin, we model on a 100 � 100 domain. Parameter values are given in Appendix 2—table 1
3D Dorsal column, with lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:02, and the region ½30; 70� � ½30; 60� and with elevated
inhibitor level (a0
I ¼ 2 in this region) to simulate the ear skin, while the other part the dorsal
domain. We stimulate a top-to-bottom HF wave by giving a one-time increase (at t ¼ 0:1) in
the activator ligand production in the top row (IA ! IA þ 1000 at y ¼ 100). We see steady HF
wave propagate through the dorsal region for several cycles along with stochastic initiations;
however, no HF wave is able to propagate into the ear skin (Appendix 2—figure 17).
Wave breaker
Hairless skin domains and physical breaks in the skin can break homogenous wave spreading.
To model this wave-breaker phenomenon, we consider a 100 � 100 domain to simulate the
Cranial domain, with parameter values given in Appendix 2—table 1 (the 3D dorsal
column), 3 and 5, with lA ¼ lI ¼ 0:02. The ½30; 72� � ½56; 60� region is ’cut-off’ (Figure 7A,
black region), that is no HF growth permitted and no molecules are allowed to diffuse into
this region. Additionally, we apply no-slip boundary conditions to the four boundaries of this

 strip. We stimulate the top row of HF growth at the beginning of the simulation by giving it
a short-time increase in activator production (for 0 � t � 0:1, set IA ! IA þ 400 for y ¼ 100),
which creates a steady HF wave propagating from top to bottom. The ‘eyelid’ region breaks
the wave propagation, creating the distortion-like effect which is particularly clear during the
first few cycles.
In comparison, we also model another wave-breaker scenario: while still no HF growth is
allowed in the wave-breaker region, molecules are allowed to diffuse into this region. This
might be a similar scenario to a skin where a part of it has the HF growth impaired. We
block the HF growth in this region by setting hðtÞ � hmin at all times. Other parameter values
are the same as in the previously described scenario. Simulation results show that such a
growth-impaired region also creates a distortion-like effect which is quite similar to the
’eyelid’ simulation results (Appendix 2—figure 18).
Sensitivity test of parameters
In this part, we test the sensitivity of several crucial parameters in our model.
Threshold Dþ
At single HF level, Dþ has great effect on ~ telogen length, but little effect on ~ anagen length.
For instance, whereas increasing Dþ greatly increases ~ telogen length, it slightly increases
~ anagen length (Appendix 2—figure 19). For different values of Dþ, increasing inhibitor
level will always result in shorter ~ anagen and longer ~ telogen, although to different
extents (Appendix 2—figure 20).
Threshold D�
On the other hand, at the single HF level, increasing D� greatly decreases ~ anagen length
while slightly decreasing ~ telogen length (Appendix 2—figure 21). For different values of
D�, increasing inhibitor level will always result in shorter ~ anagen and longer ~ telogen,
although to different extents (Appendix 2—figure 22).
Growth parameters Hþ; H�; mþ; m�
Parameters Hþ; mþ determine the growth rate of a HF during phase P, while H�; m� determine
its degeneration rate during catagen. The HF dynamics are not sensitive to these
parameters. With fixed activator and inhibitor levels, changing either of these four
parameters have little effect on ~ anagen/ ~ telogen length (Appendix 2—figure 23).
Increasing inhibitor level will always result in shorter ~ anagen and longer ~ telogen, and the
pattern does not change much under different values of these parameters (Appendix 2—
figure 24).
Maximum HF growth length hmax
At the single HF level, increasing hmax will decrease ~ telogen length, with a relatively slight
effect on ~ anagen length (Appendix 2—figure 25). For different values of hmax, increasing
inhibitor level will always result in shorter ~ anagen and longer ~ telogen, although to
different extents (Appendix 2—figure 26).
At HF wave level, we test the effect of hmax in noise-free 3D model on a 60 � 100 domain,
with parameter values given in Appendix 2—table 1 (3D dorsal column), 3 and 5, except
lA ¼ lI ¼ 0, and Dþ ¼ 2:6 or 2:7 as shown above. At t ¼ 0:1, we give a one time increase in
the activator production (IA ! IA þ 3000) for all HFs on the top row (y ¼ 100) to generate
steady head-to-tail HF waves. We tracked the time when the second HF wave reaches y ¼ 60
and y ¼ 40 (denoted as T2
60 and T2
40); when it leaves y ¼ 40 (denoted as T
2
40); and when the

 third HF wave reaches y ¼ 40 (denoted as T3
40). We measured the wave speed, wave interval
and wave length in the following way:
WaveSpeed ¼

WaveInterval ¼T3

for different values of hmax. Simulation results show that longer HF (i.e., larger jhmaxj) results
in a longer wave interval and a wider wave, but the wave speed is hardly affected
(Appendix 2—figure 27).
Total available receptors RA
tot and RI
tot
As we discussed in section Section 5, the total amount of activator and inhibitor receptors
results in different ~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths, and we use this property to model the
difference between dorsal and ventral HFs. In Figure 2F, the dorsal-ventral interaction is
simulated with RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 15 for the dorsal and RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 50 for the ventral domains,
which leads to an interaction lasting for 2–3 cycles. To test the effects of RA
tot and RI
tot on the
dorsal-ventral interaction behavior, we keep RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 15 for the dorsal while using RA
tot ¼
RI
tot ¼ 20; 30; 40 for the ventral domain.
Simulations show that with RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 20; 30; 40 for the ventral domain, the HF wave
interactions during the first 3 cycles are similar to Figure 2F where RA
tot ¼ RI
tot ¼ 50 for the
same domain. However, during later cycles, with large ventral RA
tot and RI
tot, there is clearly a
delay between ventral and dorsal HF wave development (Appendix 2—figure 28, 29, 30).
Comparison with FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model
The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a 2D model that describes an excitable medium, and it has also
been used in the study of HF behavior (Murray et al., 2012). Below we provide a detailed
comparison between the FHN model and our model. While there are many similarities
between the two models in predicting experimental observations, we do find there are
several important differences between them at both single and population HF levels. The
codes and parameters of the FHN model are based on the original ones from Murray et al.
(2012).
Single HF
Main differences between our model and the FHN model at the single HF level:
1. FHN model cannot predict reasonable anagen and telogen times as observed in
experiment. Plikus et al. (2008b) reported 14 and 28 days for anagen and refractory
telogen for WT mice, respectively, while competent anagen may vary in the range of 0–60
days. It is reported in Murray et al. (2012) that such a time scale cannot be reached: ’. . .in
order for the proposed model to yield stochastic excitations at a rate in agreement with
observations we find that Tc (competent telogen time) in the model must be of the order of
105 days. . .’ ’A notable feature of our simulations is that competent telogen times must be of
the order of ~ 105 days such that the frequency of stochastic excitations across a population
of follicles is comparable to the population scale patterns measured by Plikus et al.
However, at the single follicle scale Plikus et al. have measured competent telogen times in
the range of 0–60 days. In fact, when we used these much shorter competent telogen times
the simulations are dominated by stochastic excitations in a manner inconsistent with
population scale measurements from wild-type mice (data not shown).’

 However, we would like to point out that Chen et al. (2014) use the FHN model and reach
biologically observed time scales, as shown in Chen et al. (2014), with a specific choice of
parameters, the authors reach TPA (propagating anagen) ~ 15 days, TR (refractory telogen)
~ 30 days and TC (competent telogen) ~ 10 days. However, we fail to reproduce their results
without further information about parameter values. Moreover, to reach such a state it
needs to sacrifice the sensitivity of telogen length - in particular, that of competent telogen
length - with respect to the change of activator level.
2. The dynamics of the FHN model are either periodic or excitable. In the periodic regime
there is no competent telogen phase, while in the excitable regime sustained excitability
relies on noise or exogenous activating factors, which makes the competent telogen too
sensitive to certain core parameters. Our model, however, in its periodic dynamics provides
competent telogen with variable length, and noise and/or external factors affect the length
of different phases instead of determining the system moves on to the next cycle. In the
FHN model, when the nullcline _
w ¼ 0 intersects with the other nullcline _
v ¼ 0 in its first piece,
that is vss < v0, which is the scenario shown in Appendix 2—figure 31A, the system
becomes an excitable medium. This is the scenario discussed in Murray et al. (2012), and to
end the competent telogen, the noise has to be strong enough to pass over the threshold
(Appendix 2—figure 31B). For such an excitable scenario, the mean time spent in
competent telogen is estimated by Murray et al. (2012). When the noise is not strong
enough, the system will stay in competent telogen for a long time. In contrast, when the
inhibitor nullcline _
w ¼ 0 intersects the activator nullcline _
v ¼ 0 in its second piece
(Appendix 2—figure 31C), that is v0<vss<v1, the system will deterministically undergo cycles,
since there is no more threshold to pass over that relies on the help of noise. Appendix 2—
figure 31D shows the deterministic trajectory (black line) which clearly goes in cycles, unlike
the stochastic trajectory in Appendix 2—figure 31B which has to wait in competent telogen
for a long time waiting for excitation.
To study a HF system with all four phases (PARC) using the FHN model, it has to be in the
excitable regime and depend on noise and/or external factors to get the system excited. In
contrast, most simulations of our model are done in the periodic regime, which also provide
the competent regime that is missing from a periodic FHN model. In addition, the length of
the competent regime in the periodic regime of our model can vary a lot, allowing noise
greatly to adjust the length of different phases (Figure 1C).
3. Subjected to changes in the activator/inhibitor production rate (I=J), in FHN model
refractory telogen reacts differently to experimental observations, while competent telogen
acts too sensitively. Plikus (2012) showed that anagen, refractory and competent telogen
lengths change associated to activator and/or inhibitor level changes. Such an activator/
inhibitor level change can be simulated via changes of activator/inhibitor production rate
I=J, or the positive feedback in the activator pathway a1 — the latter will be discussed later.
Regarding change of I, we did not find published data. For change of J, as is pointed out in
Murray et al. (2012) or shown in Chen et al. (2014), ’a notable feature of the (FHN) model
is that a decrease in the parameter J does not yield the reduced refractory telogen times
observed by Plikus et al.’
We reproduced the phase time to I=J relation using FHN model based on parameter values
provided in Murray et al. (2012), shown in Appendix 2—figure 32 for different values of
a1.
When the positive feedback in the activator pathway a1 is not too low, refractory telogen
length (dashed line, TR) barely changes with activator/inhibitor production rate change I=J
(Appendix 2—figure 32B,C,E,F), which is stated in Murray et al. (2012) and against
experimental observations. For small a1, refractory telogen length increases as activator
production rate increases (Appendix 2—figure 32A) and decreases as inhibitor production
rate increases (Appendix 2—figure 32D), also against biological observations.

 Competent telogen length (dash-dot line, TC) reacts dramatically to activator/inhibitor
production rate changes: it decreases from the order of 104�5 down to 0 quickly as I
increases (Appendix 2—figure 32A,B,C) or as J decreases (Appendix 2—figure 32D,E,F).
The change rate of TC is affected by the value of a1: with bigger a1 (Appendix 2—figure
32C,F) the change rate is slightly milder comparing to extremely abrupt change when a1 is
small (Appendix 2—figure 31A,D). In fact, indicating by Appendix 2—figure 32, only
within a small window of (I; J) could TC stay in a reasonable scale. Although the reaction
trends coincide with experimental observations – TC decreases as I increases or J deceases;
however, it might be too sensitive to changes of I and/or J, comparing to a reasonable
change of TPA. If we restrict to the small window of (I; J) where TC behaves reasonable, then
TPA reacts too insensitive to changes in I and/or J.
4. The FHN model is unable to reach an extended anagen scenario. Our model gives two
equilibrium regimes besides the excitable regime (Figure 1C): one relates to extended
telogen achieved with high inhibitor or low activator level (Appendix 2—figure 5A), which
can also be achieved in FHN model; however, the other equilibrium regime relates to
extended anagen achieved with low inhibitor or high activator level (Appendix 2—figure
5B), this scenario may explain phenomena such as human scalp hair anagen, which can last
for years, or the long hair observed in angora rabbits. The FHN model is unable to simulate
such an extended anagen scenario.
5. In order to reach both short anagen and telogen in the FHN model, it needs many
parameter values changed, while in our model we can easily achieve this state by changing
one or two parameters. Thus, our model is a convenient tool to model the interactions
between dorsal and ventral domains. In vivo experiments support fast hair cycle dynamics in
the ventral domain, more specifically, ventral HFs are short in both anagen and telogen
lengths. While in both the FHN and our model we discover parameters that result in short
anagen and long telogen (or vice versa), in our model we also have parameters that can be
modified to alter anagen and telogen length, RA
tot and RI
tot (Appendix 2—figure 8, 9), or
hmax (Appendix 2—figure 25). In contrast, in the FHN model we do not know if by adjusting
one or two parameters we could obtain such a fast cycling HF type. This directly affects the
simulation of the interaction between ventral and dorsal domains.
Below are some similarities between the FHN model and our model at a single HF level:
1. Subjected to changes in the activator/inhibitor production rate (I=J), anagen length reacts
similar to what is predicted by our model. Despite the noncoincidence of refractory and
competent telogen to experimental observations and our model predictions, in FHN model,
anagen length increases as activator production rate increases (Appendix 2—figure 32A-C)
and decreases as inhibitor production rate increases (Appendix 2—figure 32D-F), which
qualitatively coincides with our model predictions. Moreover, the change rate of anagen
length to I or J is not greatly affected by the value of a1.
2. Anagen/telogen length change subjected to the positive feedback in the activator
pathway a1 coincides with experimental observations. In the FHN model, if the anagen/
telogen length change is adjusted via a1 instead of the production rates I=J, the simulation
results coincide with experimental observations. However, since in our model there is no
direct cross-talk between the activator and inhibitor pathways, there is no way to directly
compare the two models regarding such a positive feedback effect.
As summarized in Murray et al. (2012), ’increased positive feedback in the activator
dynamics results in the observed phenomena of faster activation wavefronts, shorter
refractory and competent telogen times, unchanged anagen time, increased spontaneous
initiation rates and the emergence of target patterns at the population scale.’
We reproduce the simulation results of phase length to positive feedback (a1) relation under
different values of I and J, shown in Appendix 2—figure 33.

 As a1 increases, anagen length (solid line, TPA) increases slightly while refractory telogen
length (dashed line, TR) clearly decreases; both coincide with experimental observations.
Depending on the base values of I and J, competent telogen length shows totally different
reactions to changes in a1. When J is not high compared to I (Appendix 2—figure 33A-C),
the competent telogen length mostly stays at 0, that is, the system dynamics are periodic,
absent of competent telogen. On the other hand, when J is relatively high to I, that is, the
inhibitor level is high in the system (Appendix 2—figure 33D), competent telogen increases
dramatically as a1 decreases. That is, in a system where inhibitor level (J) is high, as the
positive feedback in the activator pathway (a1) gets weaker, the mean time spent for the
system waiting to get excited increases extremely fast. However, there are certain values of
I and J that allow the system - in particular, competent telogen reacts in a similar way to
what is observed experimentally or predicted in our model (Appendix 2—figure 33E,F). In
these scenarios, competent telogen length decreases at a rate comparable to that of
refractory telogen as a1 increases.
In Appendix 2—figure 34, we present the nullclines and trajectories in v � w phase
corresponding to values of I, J and a1 in Appendix 2—figure 33.
HF wave
Main differences between our model and the FHN model at the HF wave level:
1. In the context of the heterogeneous two-domain model (i.e. dorsal and ventral domains),
the dorsal head-to-tail asynchrony resulted from dorsal-ventral interactions breaks down
within approximately 2–3 cycles in our model, which is consistent with the biological
observations. Similar breakdowns take many more cycles to achieve in the FHN model.
Experimental observations show ventral-dorsal interactions leading to dorsal head-to-tail
asynchrony in the first 2–3 cycles, which quickly degrade into spontaneous initiations yet
possessing bi-lateral symmetry.
Our model simulated similar patterns (Figure 2F) - the dorsal head-to-tail asynchrony
resulted from dorsal-ventral interactions lasts for approximately 2–3 cycles, after which it
turns into spreading waves with centers located on the ventral-dorsal borders showing
bilateral , together with spontaneous initiations. Using the FHN model, we see the similar
results; however, the dorsal-ventral interaction always lasts for more cycles (Appendix 2—
figure 35, dorsal-ventral interactions persists for five cycles). We tried different parameter
values but the dorsal-ventral interaction always lasts for more than three cycles, as is
observed experimentally or predicted by our model.
A possible reason behind this might be that while our model allows us to modulate
~ anagen and ~ telogen lengths by adjusting RA
tot and RI
tot to approximate ventral HF
behavior, that is shorter ~ anagen and ~ telogen, the FHN model has no easy way to
modulate them. Therefore, we have to set HFs in ventral domain to have shorter telogen in
sacrifice of slightly longer anagen compared to dorsal HFs.
2. In the wave-breaker simulations, we are able to investigate two scenarios using our
model: a physical region cut-off from the HF wave domain (like eyes, ears), or a region
permeable to signal molecules with disabled HF growth (by wound, for example). The FHN
model is unable to distinguish these two scenarios.
Please refer to Appendix 2-Wave breaker, Figure 7A and Appendix 2—figure 18.
3. Experiments also imply ventral HFs are shorter than dorsal HFs, combined with our single
HF analysis that within a region, short HF have shorter anagen and telogen (Appendix 2—
figure 25), in the future extension of our study, we will investigate the interaction between
dorsal and ventral domains characterized by different HF length. The FHN model does not
permit for this.

 4. In a homogeneous domain with HFs near the head having temporal phase advancement
built-in, both models reproduce the head-to-tail hair cycle asynchrony during early cycles,
which will degenerate into random initiations with no bilateral symmetry (Appendix 2—
figure 14, 15, Appendix 2—video 3, Appendix 2—figure 36). However, the early head-to-
tail steady pattern fades quickly in the FHN model while in ours it degenerates gradually.
Simulations show that in our model simulations, even after 10 cycles, the wave may still
resemble the early head-to-tail pattern. This is because we are sitting in a periodic state with
non-zero competent telogen length, and noise is still able to initiate waves allowing the
system show excitable properties, and the memory of an early wave pattern can persist
through later waves.
On the other hand, in the FHN model, the early head-to-tail pattern may be lost as early as
the 2nd cycle. Appendix 2—figure 36 shows the time course of a typical simulation by the
FHN model, in this simulation, the head-to-tail pattern persists for the first three cycles,
while stochastic initiation takes over starting in the fourth cycle. The reason for such a quick
loss of the early memory in the FHN model is because for the early head-to-tail pattern to
survive, the system should possess a periodic property; however, the system is in an
excitable regime where stochastic effects dominate, hence the stochastic initiations quickly
wash away the head-to-tail pattern.
Below are some similarities between the FHN model and our model at HF wave level:
1. In a homogeneous domain, if all HFs are synchronized in telogen, they have equal
probability of anagen initiation, in both models we see stochastic initiations dominate and
there is no bilateral symmetry (Appendix 2—figure 11, 12, Murray et al., 2012).
2. In a homogeneous domain, when HFs near the head have higher built-in levels of activator
signaling, both models show highly successive waves, that is target-like pattern
(Appendix 2—figure 13, Figure S4 in Murray et al., 2012).

 Appendix 2—figure 10. With inhibitory pathway from inhibitor to activator incorporated to the
model, the dynamics are still stable. (A, B) The inhibitor pathway is incorporated either as
inhibitor LR inhibiting the activator ligand-receptor (A, Appendix 2-Equation (14)) or
inhibitor ligands inhibiting the production of activator ligands (B, Appendix 2-
Equation (15)). (C, D) In either type of inhibitory pathway, ~ anagen (green line) is shortened
and ~ telogen (red line) is lengthened; moreover, as the inhibition becomes stronger (larger
a), ~ anagen length quickly drops to a minimum while ~ telogen gradually reaches a
maximum. (E) With very strong inhibition, the activator LR is pushed almost flat while the
inhibitor LR still shows the hill-valley pattern, however, the HF growth (blue line) still cycles.
(F) With the inhibitory pathway incorporated into our model (in the activator ligand-receptor
binding with strength a ¼ 10), changing the inhibitor ligand levels affects the ~ anagen,
~ telogen and cycle lengths in a qualitative similar way as no pathway incorporated
(Figure 1C), although the excitable regime is being switched from bI 2 ½�9; 0:5� down to
bI 2 ½�13; �4�.

 Appendix 2—figure 15. 3D modeling of HF growth pattern evolution with head-to-tail hair
cycle asynchrony. Initial asynchrony was introduced into the field by assigning a group of HFs on
one end with a one-time increase in activator ligands. Simulations faithfully reproduce head-
to-tail asynchrony of the first few cycles. However, this asynchrony fails to degrade quickly,
and persists during multiple consecutive cycles. In addition, no clear bilateral symmetry is
observed. This differs from rapid HF growth pattern evolution observed in mice. Also see
Appendix 2—video 3 and see Appendix 2—tables 1 - 3 and 5 for parameter values,

the ear skin due to the hyper-refractory state. We simulate a domain of dorsal skin, with a small
patch (the region inside the box) having high inhibitor level in simulating the hyper-
refractory ear skin. Steady HF waves propagate through the dorsal region for several cycles
together with a few stochastic initiations, however, no HF wave is able to propagate into the
ear skin due to the hyper-refractory state.

 Appendix 2—figure 35. Dorsal-ventral interaction simulation by the FHN model. In comparison
to Figure 2F. Dorsal temporal advancement is built-in, the HFs have shorter telogen in the
ventral domain than in the dorsal. Figure shows the activator activities (white-low, black-
high). Interaction between the domains with the dorsal domain showing head-to-tail
asynchrony caused by the built-in temporal advancement last for several cycles, until it
breaks into waves propagating from ventral to dorsal showing bilateral symmetry, which
lasts during the following few cycles. Using the FHN model, we cannot obtain the quick
degradation of the early dorsal head-to-tail asynchrony as early as the third or fourth cycle,
as observed in experiments or simulated by our model.

HF growth is allowed in this region and no molecules are allowed to diffuse into it. As the HF
wave propagates, the black region breaks the wave spreading, creating a distortion-like effect.
