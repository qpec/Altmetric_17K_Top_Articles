This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploit-
ing community-wide experimental variation in school-based deworming. The
program increased labor supply among men and education among women,
with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten years after de-
worming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years
of primary school, work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in non-
agricultural self-employment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and
miss one fewer meal per week. Women who were in treatment schools as girls
are approximately one quarter more likely to have attended secondary school,

 halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into
cash crops and nonagricultural self-employment. We estimate a conservative

that mass deworming may generate more in future government revenue than it
costs in subsidies. JEL Codes: I10, I20, J24, O15.
I. Introduction
The question of whether—and how much—child health gains
affect adult outcomes is of major research interest across disci-
plines and is of great public policy importance. The belief that
childhood health investments may improve adult living stan-
dards currently underlies many school health and nutrition pro-
grams in low-income countries.
Existing research suggests several channels through which
increasing child health investments could affect long-run earn-
ings. Grossman’s (1972) seminal health human capital model in-
terprets health care as an investment that increases future
endowments of healthy time. Bleakley (2010) further develops
this theory, arguing that how the additional time is allocated
will depend on how health improvements affect relative produc-
tivity in education and labor. Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan
(2012) (PRH) further note that time allocation will also depend
on how the labor market values increased human capital and
improved raw labor capacity, and this in turn may vary with
gender. They present a model in which exogenous health gains
in low-income economies tend to reinforce men’s comparative ad-
vantage in occupations requiring raw labor while leading women
to obtain more education and move into more skill-intensive oc-
cupations, and they provide evidence consistent with this model.
We examine the case of intestinal worms, which globally
affect approximately 2 billion people according to the World
Health Organization (WHO 2014). Worms (helminths) are
spread when fecal matter containing eggs from infected individ-
uals is deposited in the local environment. Intense infections lead
to lethargy, anemia, and growth stunting (Stephenson et al. 1993;
Stoltzfus et al. 1997; Guyatt et al. 2001; Silva et al. 2003) and may
weaken the immunological response to other infections (Kjetland
et al. 2006; Kirwan et al. 2010). Chronic parasitic infections in
childhood may lead to inflammation and elevated cortisol that
produce adverse health consequences later in life (Crimmins
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1638
 and Finch 2005), as well as increased maternal morbidity, low
birth weight, and miscarriage (Larocque et al. 2006; Hotez 2009).
There is ongoing debate about whether it is appropriate to
carry out mass deworming treatment programs in endemic re-
gions. Because treatment is safe and cheap but diagnosis is expen-
sive, WHO recommends periodic mass school-based deworming in
high-prevalence areas (WHO 1992). Several other groups also
highlight deworming as a cost-effective investment (Disease
Control Priorities Project 2008; Hall and Horton 2008; Jameel
Poverty Action Lab 2012; Givewell 2013). In contrast, a recent
Cochrane Review argues that although treatment of those
known to be infected may be warranted, there is ‘‘quite substan-
tial’’ evidence that mass deworming program does not improve
average nutrition, health, or school performance outcomes
(Taylor-Robinson et al. 2015).1
Because of its selection criteria focusing on medical-style
randomized control trials, the Cochrane Review includes numer-
ous studies subject to well-known methodological limitations
(Bundy et al. 2009) and excludes rigorous social science evidence.
For instance, the review excludes Bleakley (2007), which esti-
mates the community-wide impact of deworming in the early
twentieth-century U.S. South using quasi-experimental differ-
ence-in-difference methods. That study finds that mass deworm-
ing improved literacy and raised long-run adult income by 17%;
extrapolating to the higher infection rates in tropical Africa,
Bleakley (2010) estimates deworming could boost income there
by 24%.2
The present article exploits community-wide experimental
variation in a deworming program for children in Kenyan pri-
mary schools, combined with a longitudinal data set tracking
these children into adulthood, to causally identify the effect of
1. The Cochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of primary research in
human health care and health policy. They are influential among health policy
makers.
2. A small body of social science research studies the impact of deworming on
labor outcomes. In addition to Bleakley (2007, 2010), early work by Schapiro (1919)
using a first-difference research design found wage gains of 15–27% on Costa Rican
plantations after deworming, whereas Weisbrod et al. (1973) observe little contem-
poraneous correlation in the cross section between worm infections and labor pro-
ductivity in St. Lucia. We discuss the related literature estimating deworming
impacts on educational outcomes later.

 improved child health on later life outcomes. At the time of treat-
ment, program participants had already passed the age window
considered most critical for early childhood development, sug-
gesting that the time endowment and time allocation effects em-
phasized in Bleakley (2010), Grossman (1972), and PRH (2012)
may be the most relevant channels of impact. Indeed a survey
conducted one to two years after treatment found no cognitive
gains. However, consistent with Grossman (1972), treatment
led to large gains in school participation, reducing absenteeism
by one quarter (Miguel and Kremer 2004). There was also evi-
dence for epidemiological externalities within this primary
school-age population: untreated children in treatment schools
as well as children living near treatment schools had lower
worm infection rates and higher school participation (Miguel
and Kremer 2004, 2014), and children less than one year old
(who were not eligible for treatment) in treated communities
showed cognitive gains in later tests (Ozier 2014).
As discussed in Miguel and Kremer (2014), the original
Miguel and Kremer (2004) paper contained several rounding er-
rors and a coding error in the estimation of cross-school external-
ities. Correcting this coding error indicates that short-run, one-
year epidemiological externalities extend out to 3 km or 4 km,
rather than 6 km (Aiken et al. 2015; Clemens and Sandefur
2015; Miguel, Kremer, and Hicks 2015). This coding error has
been resolved in the current article. Davey et al. (2015) express
concerns that there were differences across schools in the number
of visits to measure school attendance in Miguel and Kremer
(2004). As noted in Hicks, Kremer, and Miguel (2015), there is
no statistical evidence for any imbalance in data collection pat-
terns across treatment and control schools, and the Miguel and
Kremer (2004) results are robust to weighting each individual
equally in the analysis. This issue is not relevant to the current
article, which employs a different data set than Miguel and
Kremer (2004).
In the current analysis, we examine health, education, and
labor market outcomes a decade later, at which point most sub-
jects were young adults 19–26 years of age. We find improve-
ments in self-reported health, but not in height. Consistent
with PRH, we find important gender distinctions in long-term
deworming impacts. Men who were in treatment schools as
boys work 3.5 more hours each week (on a base of 20.3 hours),
spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment, and are
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1640
 more likely to hold manufacturing jobs with higher wage earn-
ings. Their living standards improve as well, with men in treat-
ment schools eating one more meal per week on average. Women
who were in treatment schools spend more time in school as girls
and are approximately one quarter more likely to have passed the
secondary school entrance exam and to have attended secondary
school. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture to non-
agricultural self-employment and are also more likely to grow
cash crops. Estimated effects on labor hours and living standards
are larger for those who were older than 12 years of age (the
median age) at baseline, who are much more likely to be out of
school by the follow-up survey.
In line with Miguel and Kremer (2004), we also find evidence
of positive epidemiological externalities on long-run outcomes
across a range of outcomes using a seemingly unrelated regres-
sion framework. We report point estimates using the linear ap-
proach to estimating externalities employed in that paper, and we
develop a procedure for bounding the impacts of deworming valid
under the more general monotonicity assumption that the direct
and epidemiological externality effects on labor market outcomes
have the same sign.
Last, the estimated impacts of deworming on labor market
outcomes, combined with other data, allow us to estimate fiscal
impacts. We find that the additional net government revenues
generated by increased work hours caused by deworming subsi-
dies may be greater than the direct subsidy cost, suggesting that
in the case of deworming, health human capital subsidies are
potentially Pareto-improving. At a minimum, this suggests that
the expected costs to taxpayers are less than would be suggested
by multiplying program costs by 1.2 or 1.4 or some other standard
multiplier for the deadweight loss of taxation. We also estimate
an annualized financial internal rate of return to deworming sub-
sidies of 32%, a high return.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section II dis-
cusses the Kenyan context, the deworming project, and the data.
Section III presents the estimation strategy. Section IV discusses
the main results. Section V combines the results on the price re-
sponsiveness of take-up and long-run impacts to assess the fiscal
impacts of deworming subsidies, and computes the internal rate
of return. The final section concludes. All supplementary mate-
rial is in the Online Appendix.

 II. Data
This section describes the study area, the deworming pro-
gram, and the survey, including our respondent tracking ap-
proach and sample summary statistics.
II.A.
Study Area and Local Labor Markets
The primary study area is Busia District, a densely settled
farming region in western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria that is
somewhat poorer than the national average. Outside labor
market opportunities for children are meager, and boys and
girls typically attend primary school, with dropout rates rising
in grades 7 and 8 (the final two years of primary school). Primary
school completion, when children in the study area are typically
between 15–18 years of age, is a key time of labor market transi-
tion. Secondary education in Kenya, like tertiary education in the
United States, depends on exam performance, requires a sub-
stantial financial outlay, and often involves moving away from
home. In our data, just over half of control group males and just
under one third of females continue to secondary school.
Occupational and family roles differ markedly by sex, with cer-
tain occupations, such as fishing, driving bicycle taxis, and
manufacturing,
overwhelmingly
male
and
others,
such
as
small-scale
market
trading
and
domestic
service,
largely
female. The model in PRH (2012) suggests that labor market op-
portunities will affect gender-specific educational and labor re-
sponses to health investments.

The Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP)
In1998thenongovernmentalorganization(NGO)International
Child Support (ICS) launched the Primary School Deworming
Program(PSDP)intwodivisionsofthedistrict,in75primaryschools
with a total of 32,565 pupils. Parasitological surveys indicated that
baseline helminth infection rates were over 90% in these areas.
Using modified WHO infection thresholds, over a third of the
sample had moderate to heavy infections with at least one helminth
(Miguel et al. 2014), a high but not atypical rate in African settings
(Brooker et al. 2000; Pullan et al. 2011).
The schools were experimentally divided into three groups
(Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were first strat-
ified by administrative subunit (zone), zones were listed alphabet-
ically within each geographic division, and schools were then listed
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1642
 in order of pupil enrollment within each zone, with every third
school assigned to a given program group. Figure I presents the
project research design and describes the timing of data collection.
Online Appendix section A contains a detailed description of the
experimental design, provides further information on the sample,
and shows that the three groups were well balanced along baseline
characteristics (Online Appendix Table S1).
Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the
schools were phased into deworming treatment during 1998–2001:
2007-09: Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS) Round 2 data collection (Wave 1 2007-08, 
Wave 2 2008-09), N=5,084.

Wave 2 2004-05), N=5,211.

 Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming and health educa-
tion in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 in 2001.
Children in Group 1 and 2 schools were thus assigned 2.41 more
years of deworming than Group 3 children on average (Online
Appendix Table S2), and these early beneficiaries are the treatment
group in the analysis. Take-up rates were approximately 75% in the
treatment group and 5% in the control group (Miguel and Kremer
2004). In 2001, the NGO required cost-sharing contributions from
parents in a randomly selected half of the Group 1 and Group 2
schools, substantially reducing take-up, and in 2002–2003 it pro-
vided free deworming in all schools (Kremer and Miguel 2007).
II.C.
Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS) Data
The Kenya Life Panel Survey Round 2 (KLPS-2) was collected
during 2007–2009 and tracked a representative sample of approx-
imately 7,500 respondents who were enrolled in grades 2–7 in the
PSDP schools at baseline. Survey enumerators traveled through-
out Kenya and Uganda to interview those who had moved out of
local areas. The effective survey tracking rate in KLPS-2 is 82.5%,
and 83.9% among those still alive (see Online Appendix sections A
and C for further details on survey methodology, tracking rates,
and attrition). The effective tracking rate is calculated as a fraction
of those found or not found but searched for during intensive track-
ing, with weights adjusted appropriately, in a manner analogous
to the approach in the U.S. Moving to Opportunity study (Orr et al.
2003; Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007).
These are high tracking rates for any age group over a decade,
especially for a mobile group of adolescents and young adults.
Tracking rates are nearly identical and not significantly different
in the treatment and control groups (Online Appendix Table S2).
III. Estimation Strategy
In this section, we define the quantities of interest, describe
how to bound them in the presence of potential epidemiological
externalities, and present our econometric strategy.
III.A.
Bounding Deworming Treatment Effects in the Presence of
Externalities
We need to account for the possibility of externalities in em-
pirically estimating the impact of deworming subsidies. Recall
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1644
 that deworming subsidies were assigned at the school level rather
than the individual level. It is therefore worth distinguishing
within-school and cross-school externalities. In the potential
presence
of
within-school
epidemiological
externalities,
we
cannot separately identify the labor market impact of individual
deworming status and of deworming status of others within the
school. We can, however, identify the aggregate school-level labor
market effect of the deworming subsidy. Therefore we classify all
individuals in schools with a deworming subsidy as ‘‘treated’’ in
the empirical analysis.
The remaining issue is cross-school epidemiological external-
ities. In the remainder of this subsection, we first show that under
the relatively weak assumption that the sign of cross-school epi-
demiological effects on labor market outcomes is not opposite to the
sign of direct effects, the difference in outcomes between treatment
and control communities is a lower bound on the true total impact
of a mass deworming program. For expositional clarity, and to
parallel Miguel and Kremer (2004), we start with a discussion of
externality effects after one period but generalize them below to
longer timeframes. We consider a simple epidemiological model in
which worm infection can spread only � km in a single year, for
instance, due to the natural movement of and interaction among
the local population. Miguel and Kremer (2004, 2014) and Hicks,
Kremer, and Miguel (2015) estimate substantial and significant
short-run (after one year) cross-school externalities on worm infec-
tions within 3 km of treatment schools.
Consider an outcome Yijt for individual i in school j at time t,
for example, a labor market outcome. Yijt is a function of lagged
school-level
deworming
subsidy
treatment
assignment,
Tj;t�1 2 f0;
1g, and the proportion of other individuals in commu-
nities within � km of that school also received deworming,
Pj;t�1;� 2 0;

½
�. This proportion captures the local ‘‘saturation’’ of
the program. This local treatment rate is a function of both the
program’s ‘‘coverage’’, Rj;t�1;�—that is, the fraction of pupils in
nearby schools assigned to the deworming subsidy treatment,
as determined by the research design—and the deworming
take-up rate, which is a function of the deworming subsidy
level, Q S

and take-up, Pj;t�1;� ¼ Rj;t�1;�Q S

up in the zero subsidy control group is Q 0

(2007) found empirically that control group take-up was very
close to zero, implying that Pj;t�1;� ¼ Rj;t�1;�Q S
ð Þ is a reasonable
WORMS AT WORK
1645
 approximation.3 For now we focus on saturation, which is the
epidemiologically relevant quantity, and we return to the distinc-
tion between saturation and coverage in the empirical implemen-
tation later.
The first quantity of interest, �t 1
ð Þ, is the expected overall
impact of a mass deworming program, namely, the difference in
expected outcomes between individuals in treated communities
fully exposed to other treatment communities (Pj;t�1;� ¼ 1) versus
individuals in untreated communities surrounded by untreated
communities:

The second quantity of interest, �t p
ð Þ, is the impact of a pro-
gram, such as the one we study, in which the share of nearby
population receiving deworming is Pj;t�1;�¼p;p2 0;1
ð

quantity of interest we may also be interested in scaling impact
by
cost,
that
is,
�t 1
ð Þ=ðCost of Pj;t�1;�¼1Þ and
�t p
ð Þ=ðCost of Pj;t�1;�¼pÞ.
Define the expected outcome in untreated communities sur-
rounded by other untreated communities (i.e., ‘‘pure control’’ com-
munities uncontaminated by exposure to nearby treatment
schools) as y0;t � E YijtjTj;t�1 ¼ 0; Pj;t�1;� ¼ 0

and define the dif-
ference in expected outcomes between treated and untreated
communities at a given local treatment saturation proportion p

 neighbors’ treatment at time t � ~
t should thus reduce own worm
load at t. This is captured in our first assumption (where to make
the notion of monotonicity concrete, the first inequality estab-
lishes that the direct effect of treatment on Y is positive, without
loss of generality):

In a setting with real-world saturation level p, analysis that
does not account for cross-community spillover effects focuses on
estimating l1t p

bound on both quantities of interest, �t 1
ð Þ and �t p

E YijtjTj;t�1 ¼ 1; Pj;t�1;� ¼ p

This is greater than or equal to 0 by the monotonicity
assumption, implying that �t 1

show
that

� E YijtjTj;t�1 ¼ 0; Pj;t�1;� ¼ 0

� 0. The result follows.
It is possible to tie this result more closely to the empirical
analysis by taking into account the fact that local saturation rates
actually differ across communities. Allow Pj;t�1;� to be distributed
across communities as Pj;t�1;� � F, with density f. Then in prac-
tice the average difference in outcomes across treated and

 Since the result in Proposition 1 holds for all p 2 ð0;

for this expression, which is effectively a weighted average
across different saturation proportions p in this set.
The foregoing discussion abstracts away from other covari-
ates. As we discuss later, their inclusion in a regression analysis
is important given the nature of the experimental design and
stratified sampling and potentially improves statistical preci-
sion. One covariate that we include in the empirical analysis is
the local density of all primary school pupils (in all schools,
treatment and control). We show in Table S2 of the Online
Appendix and in Miguel and Kremer (2004) that the local num-
bers of all primary school pupils and treatment school pupils are
unrelated to treatment school assignment, although there is a
statistically significant but small difference in the treatment
saturation proportion; the fact that this proportion is slightly
lower in treatment schools implies that the treatment school
versus control school difference is once again likely to be a
lower bound on true impacts. Drug take-up rates in treatment
schools are also not significantly correlated with the local den-
sity of either treatment schools or of all schools (Miguel and
Kremer 2004, Appendix Table A.II). Taken together, these pat-
terns imply that any potential bias in the coefficient estimate on
the treatment school indicator would again lead us to understate
deworming impacts.
Note that the bound above will still be valid, albeit looser, if
the geographic spread of epidemiological externalities over time
means that even ‘‘pure control’’ (i.e., T ¼ 0 and P ¼ 0) schools
are subject to some spillover from the program. Those whose
infection intensity falls due to cross-school spillovers could
themselves generate positive spillovers for other nearby schools,
which would then lead to less local reinfection with worms, and
so on.
Denote worm prevalence at location j at time t by !jt. Given
the geographic spread of worm infections by � km per year, !jt will
be a nondecreasing function of worm prevalence at time t � ~
t at
all locations within radius �~
t. Thus, given the results in Miguel
and Kremer (2004), worm infection prevalence after the decade-
long gap between treatment and the follow-up survey in our study
will potentially be reduced by worm treatment within a distance
of at least 30 km (= 10 years � 3 km a year) and perhaps beyond.
Of course, these effects may fade over time, but no school in our
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1648
 study area of roughly 15 km � 40 km can be considered a ‘‘pure
control’’ in the presence of these externalities.
It is straightforward to generalize the bounding result above
to the empirically relevant case of an extended follow-up period.
Denote the time period of the original deworming program as
t ¼ 0, and subsequent years take on values of t ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . t�,
where t� is the period of the follow-up survey. While in the
short run (as in Miguel and Kremer 2004) the cross-school local
treatment saturation measure due to the deworming program
(Pj;0;�) is likely to fairly accurately capture the magnitude of the
externality impacts, over time the infection ‘‘feedback’’ effects
generated in all directions among nearby schools would lead us
to understate the magnitude of the true cross-school externali-
ties. Determining the magnitude of all these externality effects is
beyond the scope of this article, as the spatial and temporal var-
iation in our data do not allow us to precisely estimate the wide
range of potentially relevant parameters, but in Online Appendix
B we prove that the bounding result still holds in this case.
As noted, Miguel and Kremer (2004) report cross-school ex-
ternalities up to 3 km from the school and at 3–6 km. There was a
statistical program coding error in the construction of the cross-
school externality term in Miguel and Kremer (2004) limiting the
analysis to the 12 closest schools. Correcting the coding error does
not substantively alter the estimated effects of externalities be-
tween 0–3 or 0–4 km, because there were never more than 12
schools within 4 km, but does lead to less precisely estimated
overall effects between 3 and 6 km from a school; Miguel and
Kremer (2014) and Ahuja et al. (2015) contain a complete discus-
sion of the updated empirical results. We consider cross-school
externalities up to 6 km in the analysis in this article for two
reasons. First, spillover effects are likely to diffuse spatially
over time, as discussed already. Second, we consider externality
effects out to 6 km because an F-test in a seemingly unrelated
regression (SUR) framework rejects the hypothesis that the ex-
ternality effects are 0 in the 3–6 km range for the outcomes we
consider (p-value < .001), indicating that their inclusion is appro-
priate (see Online Appendix B2 for details). The main results are
largely unchanged using alternative specifications for the cross-
school externality effect, including dropping these terms from the
analysis entirely, as we discuss later.

Estimation
The econometric approach relies on the PSDP’s prospective
experimental design, namely, that the program exogenously pro-
vided individuals in treatment (Groups 1 and 2) schools two to three
additional years of deworming. We focus on intention-to-treat esti-
mates, since compliance rates are high, and previous research
showed that untreated individuals within treatment communities
experienced gains (Miguel and Kremer 2004), complicating estima-
tion of treatment effects on the treated within schools. Since PRH
suggest potentially different labor market effects of health invest-
ments on men and women in low-income ‘‘brawn-based economies,’’
occupations are sharply differentiated by gender in our data, and
roughly twice as many women in our sample have children com-
pared to the men, we follow the tradition in the labor market liter-
ature of examining prime-age women and men separately (Altonji
and Blank 1999; Bertrand 2011).4
The dependent variable is outcome Yij, for individual i in
school j, in the KLPS-2 survey:
Yij ¼ � þ l1Tj þ l2Pj þ X0
ij;0� þ "ij
ð4Þ
The outcome is a function of the assigned deworming program
treatment status of the individual’s primary school (Tj), the
treatment saturation proportion among neighboring schools
within 6 km during the original treatment phase of the PSDP
(Pj), a vector Xij;0 of baseline individual and school controls, and
a disturbance term "ij, which is clustered at the school level.
The Xij;0 controls include school geographic and demographic
characteristics used in the PSDP ‘‘list randomization,’’ the stu-
dent gender and grade characteristics used for stratification in
drawing the KLPS sample (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009), a
preprogram average school test score to capture academic qual-
ity, the 2001 cost-sharing school indicator (described below), the
total number of primary school pupils within 6 km of the school,
and survey month and wave controls. Estimates are weighted
to make the results representative of the full PSDP sample
originally in grades 2–7, taking into account the sampling for
KLPS and the tracking strategy.
4. This study is registered on the American Economic Association RCT regis-
try (#AEARCTR-0001191). We did not register a preanalysis plan, as they were
uncommon in economics when data collection for this study was completed in 2009.
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1650
 One issue with employing local saturation rates as an ex-
planatory variable in practice is that they are a function of the
local treatment decisions of households in the relevant area, lead-
ing to possible endogeneity concerns, for instance, if take-up is
higher in areas where people have unobservably better labor
market prospects. To address these concerns, we construct the
local saturation measure Pj as a function of the local coverage
rate Rj of treatment school pupils within 6 km of school j, which
is exogenously determined by the experimental design, times the
average take-up rate of deworming drugs in the entire sample at
the full subsidy level. This implies that variation in the local sat-
uration variable is driven entirely by the experimental design,
with the average take-up rate serving as a useful ‘‘rescaling’’ to
allow for a more meaningful interpretation of the magnitude of
estimated effects.
The main coefficient of interest is l1, which captures gains
accruing to individuals in treatment schools relative to the con-
trol; because deworming was assigned by school rather than at
the individual level, some of the gains in treatment schools are
likely due to within-school externalities. This is an attractive co-
efficient to focus on because it is a lower bound on the overall
effect of deworming (Proposition 1). Another coefficient of some
interest is l2, which captures the spillover effects for nearby
schools, following the approach in Miguel and Kremer (2004), in
which cross-school externalities are estimated by taking advan-
tage of variation in the local density of treatment schools induced
by the randomization. As explained further in that paper, since
reinfection rates are high in the area, the magnitude of external-
ity effects may be either larger or smaller than the effect of own-
school treatment. We have analyzed other specifications, includ-
ing interactions between treatment and local saturation, and
nonlinearities in saturation (Online Appendix B), but we cannot
reject that Tj and Pj are additively separable and enter in
linearly.
The direct treatment effect estimates and externality effects
are locally relevant to the infection rates and treatment satura-
tion rates in the setting we study, and although we do not find
evidence of interaction effects or nonlinear externalities, it re-
mains possible that such effects would emerge at treatment
levels outside the support of values we observe. One case of po-
tential interest is one where treatment coverage rates are even
higher than those observed in our setting, for instance, if all local
WORMS AT WORK
1651
 schools were assigned to treatment (rather than approximately
two thirds, as in our case). In this case, it is possible to place
bounds on the cost-effectiveness of deworming using our data
under the highly conservative assumption that there are no ad-
ditional benefits from boosting deworming treatment saturation,
that is, in the notation above that � p
ð Þ ¼ � p0
ð
Þ and l2 p
ð Þ ¼ l2 p0
ð
Þ
for all p0 > p.
For concreteness, consider the case in which all estimates are
based on local treatment saturation rates in the neighborhood of
p < 1 and program coverage R < 1. Due to externalities, program
benefits are experienced in the schools assigned to treatment and

schools
and
can
be
represented
as
R� p
ð Þ þ 1 � R
ð
Þl2 p
ð Þ ¼ Rl1 p
ð Þ þ l2 p
ð Þ. Then under an assumption
of constant marginal per capita treatment costs (which again is
likely to be conservative given the fixed costs of setting up a treat-
ment program), the cost of expanding local program coverage to
all schools in the area (R ¼ 1) is 1
R times the cost of covering pro-
portion R of the population. In our case, this is implemented by
multiplying the baseline costs of deworming treatment by
1
ð2=3Þ ¼ 1:5, whereas the total benefits are assumed to remain
unchanged. We present bounds using this approach in Section V.5
IV. Results
After briefly discussing long-run health effects, we present
impacts on education, labor outcomes, and living standards, by
gender. Results are broadly consistent with the PRH model.
IV.A.
Long-Run Health Impacts
Although treatment dramatically reduced moderate-heavy
infections in the short run (Table I), adult helminth life spans
are typically between one and four years (Hotez et al. 2006), so
the direct effects of treatment will no longer be present a decade
later in the data used in this analysis. Any long-run effects would
likely instead be due to effects on other diseases through an im-
munological channel or to the effects of changes in schooling or
labor outcomes.
5. Of course, if � p
ð Þ ¼ � p0
ð
Þ and �2 p
ð Þ ¼ �2 p0
ð
Þ for all p0 > p, policy makers have
the option of replicating a program like that implemented in this study, in which
case the relevant cost-effectiveness calculations would be based on the costs and
benefits at coverage and saturation levels found in our data.

Notes. The sample includes all individuals surveyed in KLPS-2 (2007–2009), except for the moderate-heavy worm infection data, which is from the 2001 PSDP parasitological
survey. Each entry in columns (1)–(3) is from a separate OLS regression, except the miscarriage outcomes, which are marginal probit specifications in which each observation is a
pregnancy. All observations are weighted to maintain initial population proportions, except for the 2001 moderate-heavy worm infection results. Standard errors are clustered by
school. Significant at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence. The coefficient on the deworming treatment indicator term is l1 in equation (1). The cross-school externality term is the
‘‘saturation rate’’—the number of treatment group (Group 1, 2) pupils within 6 km divided by the total number of primary school pupils within 6 km, multiplied by the average
deworming take-up rate in the sample—demeaned, and the coefficient on the externality term is l2 in equation (1). All regressions except for the first include controls for baseline
1998 primary school population, geographic zone of the school, survey wave and month of interview, a female indicator variable, baseline 1998 school grade fixed effects, the average
school test score on the 1996 Busia District mock exams, total primary school pupils within 6 km, and the cost-sharing school indicator. The first row includes controls for baseline
1998 primary school population, geographic zone of the school, a female indicator variable, baseline 1998 school grade fixed effects, the average school test score on the 1996 Busia
District mock exams, and total primary school pupils within 6 km. Self-reported health ‘‘very good’’ takes on a value of 1 if the answer to the question ‘‘Would you describe your
general health as somewhat good, very good, or not good?’’ is ‘‘very good,’’ and 0 otherwise. Sixteen unreasonably low values for height are dropped, but the height results are
substantively the same if these are not dropped. Sixteen unreasonably high values (at 98 and above) for BMI are dropped (these are the same 16 observations that were dropped for
height); note that the female BMI effect estimate is not statistically significant at traditional confidence levels if these observations are retained (not shown).
WORMS AT WORK
1653
 Although we find no long-term effects on height or body mass
index in the full sample, there is some evidence of persistent
health gains in terms of self-reported health and reduced miscar-
riage. Respondent reports that their health was ‘‘very good’’ rose
by 4.0 percentage points (std. err. 1.8, p < .05), on a base of 67.3%
in the control group. We cannot reject equal effects for both gen-
ders, but gains are slightly larger for women. We detect gains in
body mass index among treated women (p<.05). Furthermore,
deworming reduced miscarriage rates among treatment group
women by 2.8 percentage points (std. err. 1.3, p < .05) on a base
of 3.9% in a probit analysis (where each pregnancy is the unit of
observation). The lack of miscarriage impact among the partners
of men in the treatment group suggests a health (rather than a
living standards) channel for the impacts estimated among
sample women.
IV.B.
Education Impacts
The medium-run follow-up (Miguel and Kremer 2004) found
increased primary school participation among both boys and
girls, consistent with the idea that health investment increased
the endowment of healthy time (Grossman 1972), and that for
children, this increased time went into schooling rather than
working. The long-run follow-up data show that treatment con-
tinued to boost boys’ primary school enrollment, but average ac-
ademic performance did not improve, with higher enrollment
translating into higher rates of grade repetition but no increase
in educational attainment and no significant differences between
the treatment and control groups in rates of passing the second-
ary school exam or enrolling in secondary school (Table II). We do
not have data on whether increased primary school enrollment
improved noncognitive skills, a possible channel for later labor
market impacts (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006). Recall that
in the models in Bleakley (2010) and Pitt, Rosenzweig, and
Hassan (2012), deworming would not increase secondary school-
ing if attractive work opportunities emerged around the time of
primary school completion (roughly ages 15–18) and if health in-
vestments raised the marginal return to work as much as the
discounted return to secondary schooling.
In contrast, our primary specification suggests that deworm-
ing leads to marked academic gains for girls, increasing the rate
at which girls passed the secondary school entrance exam by 9.6

 percentage points (p < .05) on a base of 41%. This increase of
roughly one quarter reduces the existing gender gap in exam
performance by half. Consistent with the model in PRH (2012),
in which positive health shocks disproportionately induce women
to allocate more time to human capital acquisition, treatment also
halved the gender gap in secondary school entry, increasing girls’
secondary enrollment by 0.325 years, or a third (Online Appendix
Table S3), and increasing overall years of school enrollment for
women by 0.354 years (std. err. 0.179, p < .10) (Table II). The
estimated increase in girls’ educational attainment is 0.261 years
(std. err. 0.171, p = .13), as some of the increased enrollment
translated into increase grade repetition, as was the case for
males.
IV.C.
Impact on Labor Hours and Occupation
Average weekly hours worked in the control group are quite
low, at 20.3 for men and 16.3 for women (although many women
in our sample are engaged in home production or child-rearing
activities, and time spent on these activities was not systemati-
cally collected in KLPS-2). Among men, deworming increased
time spent working by 17%, or 3.49 hours a week (std. err. 1.42,
p < .05, Table III, Panel A). In contrast, estimated effects on
nonhousehold work hours among women are small. It is worth
noting that one quarter of both the treatment and control groups
were still in school by the time of the survey (Table II), and labor
market outcomes are less meaningful for this group. We next
focus on a subpopulation that is largely older than school age,
which we operationalize as those who were older than 12 years
(the median age) at baseline, and thus at least 22 or 23 years of
age at follow-up: only 5% of control individuals in this age group
were still enrolled in any school at follow-up, compared with 39%
among younger control individuals. In this older subpopulation,
average hours worked per week in the control group is somewhat
higher: 28.2 hours for men and 21.7 hours for women. For this
subgroup among both sexes, deworming increased time spent
working by 13.0%, or 3.29 hours a week (std. err. 1.80, p < .10),
and treated men worked 3.74 more hours a week (p < .10).
Treated women worked 2.01 more hours a week, and although
we cannot reject the hypothesis of no effect for women, we also
cannot reject the hypothesis of equal treatment effects by gender.

 Deworming changes how work hours are allocated across
sectors and occupations, with important distinctions by gender
(Table III, Panel B). Considering the genders together, hours in
nonagricultural self-employment increase by 45% (p < .01), and
results are shown by gender in Figure II (Panels A and B). There
are no statistically significant changes in hours worked in agri-
culture or wage employment.
Breaking results down by gender, point estimates suggest
that deworming leads men to increase total work hours, and we
cannot reject the hypothesis of equal percentage increases across
sectors (Table III, Panel B). In contrast, women increase time in
nonagricultural self-employment by 1.86 hours (std. err. 0.81, p <
.05) on a base of 2.7 hours, nearly 70%, and reduce hours worked
in agriculture by 1.27 hours (std. err. 0.56, p < .05). This shift
from agricultural work into nonagricultural self-employment
could potentially be interpreted as consistent with PRH, although
the evidence is not dispositive. Seventy-seven percent of self-
employed women work in retail, which seems less physically in-
tensive than agriculture, and there is evidence that retail profits
are tied to math skills (Kremer et al. 2013). However, there is no
significant difference in education levels between women working
in agriculture and those in nonagricultural self-employment.
Deworming treatment also leads to shifts in occupational
choice (Table III, Panel C). Treatment respondents are three
times more likely to work in manufacturing (coefficient 0.0110,
p < .05) from a low base of 0.005. On the flip side, casual labor—
which typically does not require regular work hours—falls signif-
icantly (p < .05). Manufacturing jobs require more hours a week
than other occupations: they average 53 hours a week, compared
with 42 hours for all wage-earning jobs, 34 hours for self-
employment,
and
15 hours
for
agriculture.
Workers
in
manufacturing tend to miss relatively few work days due to
poor health, at just 1.1 days in the past month (in the control
group), compared with 1.5 days among all wage earners.
Manufacturing jobs are highly paid, with average earnings
more than double those in casual labor (Table S17). Deworming
also leads to an increase in cash crop cultivation for the entire
sample (Table III, Panel C), with a gain of 1.36 percentage points
(p < .05) on a low base of 0.73%.
Estimates of occupational effects by sex are less precise, but
there are significant increases in manufacturing among men and
in growing cash crops among women. The particularly large effect

manufacturing employment among men is consistent with the
PRH model. There is suggestive evidence of a shift into high
work hour occupations for men but not women (see Online
Appendix C).
The increase in secondary education, nonagricultural self-
employment, and cash crop cultivation among women may reflect
a desire to engage in higher productivity activities within existing
family and social constraints, which may complicate moves into
manufacturing or other lucrative male-dominated jobs. More
speculatively, these may pay off in the form of higher future earn-
ings, even if not yet apparent in our data.
IV.D.
Impact on Living Standards
Living standards can be assessed using data on either con-
sumption or earnings. We do not have data on overall consump-
tion, but we do have data on the number of meals consumed.
Treatment respondents eat 0.095 more meals per day (std. err.
0.029, p < .01, Table IV, Panel A). The increase in meals eaten is
larger for men, at 0.125 meals/day (p < .01) than for women (0.051
meals), implying that treatment males miss just under one fewer
meal each week than control males. Treatment effects are parti-
cularly large for the older than school age subsample (across both
genders), at 0.119 more meals per day (p < .01).
Total earnings are the sum of earnings in wage labor, in
nonagricultural
self-employment,
and
in
agriculture,
each
weighted by the proportions working in each sector. We begin
by considering total nonagricultural earnings (the sum of wage
labor earnings and nonagricultural self-employment profits),
which are likely to be more accurately captured than agricultural
production in this setting. Those with no nonagricultural earn-
ings are included in the analysis (with zero earnings). In the full
sample, treatment respondents’ total nonagricultural earnings
are 15.0% higher (112 shillings, std. err. 96, Table IV, Panel A),
although the effect is not statistically significant. In the older
than school age subsample, the effect is considerably larger at
22.6% (278 shillings, std. err. 167, p = .101).
We next consider each source of income separately. In prin-
ciple, the proportions working in different sectors could differ by
treatment group, but note that there are no significant differ-
ences by treatment status (Online Appendix Table S5, odd

Notes. For details on the regressions, see the notes for Table I. Each entry in columns (1)–(3) is from a separate OLS regression, except for ‘‘total employees hired’’ in Panel C,
which uses a negative binomial regression. ‘‘Older than school age’’ denotes those older than 12 years of age (the median age) at baseline in 1998. Real earnings measures account
for the higher prices found in the urban areas of Nairobi and Mombasa. We collected price surveys in both rural western Kenya and in urban Nairobi during KLPS-2, and base the
urban price deflator on these data; results are unchanged without this price adjustment. The total nonagricultural earnings measure in Panel A includes those with zero reported
earnings and profits. The wage, earnings, and profits results in Panels B and C are among those who reported wage employment or nonagricultural self-employment, respectively.
When computing wages, we exclude those with fewer than 10 hours a week to address division bias from noise in estimation of number of hours worked. ‘‘Total employees hired’’ is
among those who are self-employed. Significant at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence.

Notes. The deworming cost is US$0.59 per year, and the average number of years treated was 2.41 years. Figures in Panels B and C are relative to the ‘‘no subsidy’’ case. We
use a starting hourly wage rate (w) of $0.17, a weighted average of wages by sector with weights corresponding to control group mean hours per sector (Table IV). We use Suri’s
(2011) mean wage of $0.16 as the agricultural wage, and the control group mean of $0.23 (Table IV, Panel A) for those working for wages. Self-employed wages are calculated by
dividing control group monthly profits (Table IV, Panel B) by 4.5 times the hours worked a week among those working in self-employment, for a wage of $0.14. The public finance
data is from the Kenyan Central Bank website and the World Bank Development Indicators. The NPV of per person lifetime earnings in the no subsidy and no health spillovers case
is $1,509.96. We assume that earnings start 10 years after deworming treatment and continue for 40 years. Life cycle earnings profiles for Kenya are created using data from the
1998/1999 Kenya Integrated Labour Force Survey, by regressing individual earnings on age, age squared, and indicator variables for female, attained a schooling level of primary/
secondary/beyond, and province of residence. Future earnings are also assumed to increase by the average per capita GDP growth rate in Kenya during the 2001–2011 period,
namely, 1.52% per annum (World Bank Development Indicators).
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1666
 columns). Although weighted earnings by sector can always be
summed to generate total earnings, the treatment versus control
differences within particular sectors presented above reflect a
combination of treatment and selection effects. Treatment and
control individuals work as wage laborers at similar rates and
have similar selection patterns along observable dimensions
(Tables S5, S14–S15), but there are significantly different pat-
terns of selection into wage employment and nonagricultural
self-employment by treatment status (Table S5). This suggests
that selection concerns are potentially important and that it
may not be appropriate to interpret the differences between treat-
ment and control individuals within employment sectors as
causal impacts. Recall that the consumption and total nonagri-
cultural earnings results above (in Table IV, Panel A) are based
on the full sample and the issue of sorting across employment
sectors does not apply.
Those working in wage employment likely have the best mea-
sured data. The distribution of log wage earnings is shifted to
right for both men (Figure II, Panel C) and women (Panel D) in
the treatment group relative to control. Log earnings (Table IV,
Panel B) are 26.9 log points (std. err. 8.5, p < .01) greater. The
estimated differences in earnings are larger than those of hours,
consistent with the hypotheses that treatment leads men to shift
into jobs that require more work hours and pay better. Log wages
computed as earnings per hour worked (among those who work at
least 10 hours a week) are 19.7 log points (std. err. 10.2, p < .10)
greater in the treatment group. Wage earnings differences be-
tween treatment and control are also positive among the larger
number of respondents who had ever earned wages since 2007,
with an average difference of 22.5 log points (p < .01) during the
most recent earnings period.
The data on self-employment profits are likely measured
with somewhat more noise. Monthly profits are 22% larger in
the treatment group, but the difference is not significant
(Table IV, Panel C), in part due to large standard errors created
by a few male outliers reporting extremely high profits. In a ver-
sion of the profit data that trims the top 5% of observations, the
difference is 28% (p < .10).
With no changes in the proportion of respondents in different
sectors, and estimated increases in earnings of more than 20%
among wage earners—and similar (if less precisely estimated)
profit increases among the self-employed—treatment will have
WORMS AT WORK
1667
 increased overall earnings unless agricultural earnings declined.
Unfortunately, we lack sufficient data on agricultural earnings to
perform a direct test. However, several patterns suggest that it is
unlikely agricultural earnings declined, and highly unlikely that
they declined sufficiently to outweigh the gains in other sectors.
Recall that cash crop cultivation increased and hours worked in ag-
riculture did not change. Most important, if agricultural productivity
had declined, one might expect that food consumption among those
working in agriculture would decline, but there is in fact an increase
of 0.065 meals (std. err. 0.033) in this group (Online Appendix C).
IV.E.
Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Alternative
Specifications
Although statistical power is limited, we do not find strong
evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects on education, labor
market, or living standards outcomes by baseline school grade,
local treatment saturation, or the presence of schistosomiasis (as
proxied for by distance to Lake Victoria, see Online Appendix
Section C.4 and Tables S6–S13).
Estimated deworming impacts are largely robust to whether
we account for the cross-school spillovers at all and to accounting
for cross-school externalities at different distances (Online
Appendix Tables S6–S9, column (5)). Online Appendix Figure
S4 shows that effects typically remain statistically significant
across alternative specifications of the externality effects for
key outcome measures (although for the ‘‘passed primary exam’’
outcome for women, p-values range from .02 to .26). The exter-
nality results are similar if we focus on the number of local pupils,
rather

schools
(Online
Appendix Tables S6–S9, column (2)).
IV.F.
Accounting for Multiple Inference
To further assess robustness, we next account for multiple
inference, and then examine two additional sources of variation
in exposure to deworming.
Online Appendix Tables S18–S21 present the false discovery
rate adjusted q-values (analogues to the standard p-value) that
limit the expected proportion of rejections within a set of hypotheses
that are Type I errors (Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli 2006;
Anderson 2008). Key results are robust to this adjustment: taking
both genders, the deworming impact on meals eaten and labor
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
1668
 earnings is statistically significant at the 1% level (q-value < 0.01),
on total hours worked in nonagricultural self-employment and
manufacturing employment is significant at the 5% level, and the
reduction in casual labor jobs, the increase in cash crops, and
trimmed self-employed profits are significant at the 10% level.
There is less power with the gender subsamples, but most key results
continue to hold at the 10% level (Online Appendix Section C.5).
IV.G.
Variation in Cost Sharing
Because the temporary 2001 deworming treatment cost-shar-
ing program substantially reduced take-up, it provides an addi-
tional orthogonal source of variation in treatment, albeit with
less statistical power. Reassuringly, the estimated effect of cost
sharing has the opposite sign of the main deworming treatment
effect for 26 of the 30 outcomes presented in Tables I–IV (excluding
the first outcome in Table I, which was measured before cost shar-
ing was introduced), and this pattern seems extremely unlikely to
occur by chance. In addition, stacking the data and using seem-
ingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation across outcomes, we
reject the hypothesis that the cost-sharing coefficients are 0 (p <
.001); see Online Appendix Section B for further details.
IV.H.
Cross-School Treatment Externalities
Cross-school externalities provide a third source of exoge-
nous variation in exposure to deworming. Several of the external-
ity effect estimates in Tables I–IV are significant and large in
magnitude, including for miscarriage, manufacturing employ-
ment, and meals eaten (p < .05). Under the null hypothesis of
no epidemiological externalities, there should be no correlation
with the direct treatment effect. In 26 of the 30 post-2001 speci-
fications in Tables I–IV, the sign of the treatment effect and the
cross-school externality effect are the same, which is extremely
unlikely to occur by chance; an alternative test estimates a cor-
relation of 0.750 between the t-statistics for the direct effect and
the externality effect across outcomes (p < .001); and using SUR,
we reject the hypothesis that the 0–6 km cross-school externality
effects are 0 (p < .001); see Online Appendix B. The existence of
cross-school externalities provides additional evidence on the ro-
bustness of the deworming impacts and reassurance that esti-
mated effects are not simply due to some form of reporting bias
in the treatment schools.

 V. The Rate of Return and Fiscal Impacts of Deworming
Subsidies
The estimated impacts of deworming on labor market out-
comes, combined with other data, allow us to estimate the internal
financial rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming subsidies.
We observe only a snapshot of labor market outcomes at the
time of the follow-up survey, rather than the whole path of future
hours and earnings, and thus the calculations in this section are
somewhat speculative by necessity. We adopt what we consider to
be a reasonably conservative approach in bounding the effect of
lifetime income. In particular, we base our calculations on differ-
ences in hours worked between the treatment and control groups.
This is likely to be conservative for a number of reasons: (i) esti-
mated differences in earnings among wage workers are larger
than differences in hours (Table IV, Panel B); (ii) among
women, treatment is associated with greater educational attain-
ment and higher test scores, and it seems plausible that this could
lead to higher future earnings, particularly if education and ex-
perience are complements (Card 1999); (iii) there is increased
nonagricultural self-employment, particularly among women,
and it seems plausible that some of this consists of investments
that could pay off in increased earnings later; and (iv) estimated
effects on hours worked and nonagricultural earnings are larger
among those who are older and more likely to be out of school.
For projections about the future path of earnings and thus

The left-hand side is the fiscal cost to the government of in-
creasing a deworming subsidy from S1 to S2, which in turn may
affect deworming take-up Q; take-up is nondecreasing in the
subsidy. To compute this, we use information on take-up at
different price levels from Kremer and Miguel (2007), and cur-
rent estimates of per pupil mass deworming treatment costs
(provided by the NGO Deworm the World) of $0.59 per year.
The total direct deworming cost then is the 2.41 years of
average deworming in the treatment group times this figure,
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 or M = $1.42 per person treated and $1.07 per pupil in a de-
worming treatment school, given average take-up of 75%.
Under partial deworming subsidies, as implemented in the
2001 cost-sharing program, individuals paid an average of
$0.27 for the medicines, so the direct cost to the government
would be $1.15 for each fully dewormed individual over 2.41
years. In Table V, Panel A, we compare these subsidy levels
with the default case of no subsidies, S1 ¼ 0.
The right-hand side captures the implications for govern-
ment revenue of increasing the subsidy from S1 to S2. N� is the
fraction of individuals in the sample of type � 2 �, which we oper-
ationalize as gender, following the empirical analysis. The first
term in the square brackets captures the increase in tax revenue
generated by any increase in work hours: � S1
ð
Þ is the prevailing
tax rate; r is the per period interest rate; wt is the wage rate in
year t; l1;� is the estimated deworming impact on work hours in
treatment schools for gender �; l2;� is the estimated externality
effect; and p and R denote the program’s saturation and coverage,
as above. These gains are captured over an individual’s working
life, which we take to be 50 years.
The second term in the square brackets accounts for the fact
that improved child health may lead the government to accrue ad-
ditional educational expenditures, for instance, if secondary school-
ing rates increase for type �, which we find for females. Let K
capture the cost of an additional unit of schooling, and �E�t
S1; S2
ð
Þ denote the average increase in schooling for type �
when the deworming subsidy increases from S1 to S2. To compute
the right-hand side of equation (5), we use a combination of esti-
mates from this article and other Kenyan data. The hours worked
estimates (Table III) indicate that treatment group males work
3.49 more hours per week (l1;male ¼ 3:49), whereas the treatment
effect estimate for women is near zero (l1;female ¼ 0:32). The point
estimate of the increase in work hours due to epidemiological
externalities is 10.20 hours/week for an increase in treatment sat-
uration from 0% to 100%, and we combine this information with
each school’s local density of treated pupils to determine pl2;�.6
Because this externality estimate is not significant at conven-
tional levels, we focus on the case of no epidemiological external-
ity (l2;� ¼ 0) in Panel B, and present results in Panel C assuming
6. Results are similar when externalities are disaggregated by gender (not
shown).

 the externality has the estimated magnitude for completeness.
We examine the impact of a program that treated two thirds of
local schools, as in the PSDP, and scale up externality gains by
the inverse of the coverage rate (1
R) since the control group also
benefits from externalities.
At the time of writing, the government of Kenya pays 11.85%
interest on its sovereign debt and inflation is approximately 2%, so
we set the real cost of capital r to 9.85%.7 We assume that the
sample population begins working 10 years after they first began
receiving deworming and retires after 40 years of work.8 From
year 10 post-treatment onward, we combine estimated l1;� and
l2;� values from Tables III–IV with the pattern of life cycle earn-
ings reported in the most recent publicly available data, the 1998/
1999 Kenya Integrated Labour Force Survey, and assume recent
Kenyan economic growth trends continue. This forward projection
of earnings is necessary given the limitations of existing data and
implies that the calculations that follow are somewhat speculative.
We also assume the initial starting wage w is $0.17 an hour, which
is a weighted average of wages by sector in our data and the mean
Kenyan agricultural wage in Suri (2011), with weights correspond-
ing to control group mean hours per sector (Table IV).9 Kenyan
taxes (mainly on consumption) absorb roughly 16.6% of GDP, so
we set the tax rate under no subsidy to 16.6%.10
7. See
http://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/bonds/manualresults.aspx
and World Bank Development Indicators. This is a conservative assumption be-
cause other potential funders of deworming subsidies (e.g., international organi-
zations, private donors) are likely to face lower interest rates; use of a lower interest
rate greatly increases the returns to deworming in the calculations described later.
8. This 10-year gap roughly corresponds to the time elapsed from the start of
PSDP until the KLPS-2 survey (2007–2009). By ignoring the time before KLPS-2
data were collected, it underestimates gains due to greater work hours prior to the
survey. Yet it misses any reduction in work hours due to substitution of school for
work. However, existing estimates of child labor productivity suggest these forgone
earnings are likely to be small (Udry 1996).
9. In Suri (2011), the mean agricultural wage is $0.16, and the control group
mean is $0.23 (Table IV, Panel B) for those working for wages. Self-employed wages
are calculated by dividing control group monthly profits (Table IV, Panel C) by 4.5
times the hours worked per week among those working in self-employment, for a
wage of $0.14.
10. From World Development Indicators, government expenditures are
roughly 19.5% of GDP, and from http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/three-
myths-about-aid-to-kenya about 15% of government expenditure is financed from
donors, thus 0.195 * 0.85 = 0.166.

 We estimated deworming impacts on school enrollment by
gender and year (Online Appendix Table S3) and gathered de-
tailed information on current teacher salaries and class sizes
from the Ministry of Education, allowing us to estimate per
capita schooling costs K for both primary and secondary school-
ing. Because the PSDP program did not increase the number of
teachers or classrooms in primary schools, and there is no reason
to believe the Kenyan government adjusted these factors in re-
sponse to the program (based on our observations as well as on
discussions with local officials), any costs of increased classroom
congestion at the primary level due to deworming would have
been incurred by students in these schools and thus is already
captured in the labor market outcomes in our data. We therefore
focus on measuring the fiscal costs to the government of increased
secondary school enrollment, since these costs would be incurred
either by the government (by paying for additional teachers) or by
secondary school students. Teacher salaries constitute the bulk of
recurrent government education spending, at over 90% of second-
ary school spending (Otieno and Colclough 2009), and most other
expenses are traditionally covered by tuition and local parent
fees. We factor in the costs the government would need to incur
to maintain the secondary school pupil-teacher ratio using our
estimated per student secondary school teacher cost of $116.85
per year (Table V, Panel A).
Assuming no externality gains, P

$142.43, implying that individuals gain an average of $119 in
take-home pay and the net present value (NPV) of government
revenue increases by $23 per person (Table V, Panel B). The ad-
ditional public educational costs incurred are estimated to be ap-
proximately $10.71, so the net increase in government revenue is
$12.90, far greater than the $1.07 subsidy. If deworming also
generates positive externalities, the earnings gains are much
larger, with a per capita net increase in government revenue of
$102.97 (Panel C).
A policy-relevant case is one in which the coverage (R) of the
population assigned to deworming increased from the roughly
two thirds in our study sample up to all local primary schools,
as in a national mass treatment program. In that case, the rela-
tive cost-effectiveness of the program could depend on the degree
to which total program treatment effects depend on local treat-
ment saturation, that is, on the shapes of both � p

ð Þ,
something we cannot directly estimate (the 10–90 range for
WORMS AT WORK
1673
 saturation rate Pj in our data is 0.427 to 0.599). However, we can
bound the cost-effectiveness of a program that covered the entire
population under the conservative assumption that there are no
additional net benefits from boosting the treatment rate. The cost
per treatment school student (under full subsidies) would rise by
50% from $1.07 to $1.60 while the NPV net increase in govern-
ment revenue would remain unchanged at $12.90, implying that
a program treating all schools would also be cost-effective.
In terms of other extensions, our model assumes a linear
income/consumption tax, but the result is robust to a range of
alternative assumptions on taxation, including the possibility of
a lower tax rate in our predominantly rural sample; see Online
Appendix Section C for further discussion.
A standard approach to assessing the desirability of a program
is to calculate the social internal rate of return (IRR), which solves
for the interest rate that equates the NPV of the full social cost and
all earning gains, taxed or untaxed: in the above notation, MQ S

The annualized social IRR with no health spillovers (l2;� ¼ 0) is
very high at 31.8%, and with health spillovers is a massive 51.0%.
These fiscal and IRR calculations are speculative for several
reasons, including the projection of future earnings, as noted.
This exercise also ignores broader general equilibrium effects of
a mass national deworming program on wage levels and the cap-
ital stock; these macroeconomic effects could theoretically either
increase or decrease the effects we present in this section, al-
though they seem unlikely to overturn the main patterns
(Online Appendix C contains a discussion). They are also rela-
tively imprecisely estimated: we bootstrapped standard errors
(with 1,000 runs), and find that net revenue gains are less than
zero 29% of the time for the case of no health spillovers. So al-
though estimates indicate that the expected net revenue effects of
deworming are large, there remains considerable uncertainty
around these estimates.
Yet these calculations are conservative in several dimensions.
For one thing, note that even in cases where the net revenue effects
are not positive, the gains in the labor market due to deworming
help partially offset the original expenditure outlay on deworming
subsidies, substantially reducing their net fiscal cost. The fiscal
and IRR exercises also only rely on income and ignore any welfare
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 gains through other channels. It is plausible that those who had
better health and nutrition as a result of deworming benefited from
an increased endowment of healthy hours, and experienced direct
utility gains from simply feeling better; the same could be said for
any inherent welfare benefits of increased schooling. Finally, we do
not incorporate recent evidence that positive deworming external-
ities extend beyond those in our sample to other age groups: Ozier
(2014) finds that living in a deworming treatment community early
in life (birth to age 2) leads to improved cognitive and academic
performance 10 years later. Older individuals in the area also plau-
sibly benefited from the health spillovers of treatment, but we lack
data to quantify any such gains.
VI. Conclusion
Previous work (Miguel and Kremer 2004) found that a pri-
mary-school deworming program increased school participation.
This article shows that some education and labor market out-
comes improve a decade after deworming. These gains could
have substantial positive welfare impacts for households living
near subsistence, like many in our Kenyan sample. A conserva-
tive estimate of the annualized financial IRR to deworming is
high at 31.8%. Our best estimate is that deworming subsidies
will generate more in future government revenue than they
cost in up-front expenditures.11
The high rate of return to deworming in our Kenyan context is
consistent with the finding of sizable deworming impacts on edu-
cation and incomes in the twentieth-century U.S. South (Bleakley
2007, 2010) and recent evidence on positive long-run educational
impacts in East Africa in Ozier (2014) and Croke (2014). Of course,
there is uncertainty around our estimates, and returns could differ
in other environments, but even given some uncertainty, or sub-
stantial weight on priors that the returns to deworming are smal-
ler, this growing body of evidence suggests that the expected
financial rate of return would likely exceed conventional hurdles
for public health investment (Ahuja et al. 2015).
The results also have implications for several related litera-
tures. Many studies argue that early childhood health gains in
11. Some have argued that certain other public health investments could also
have this property, including tobacco cessation (Lightwood and Glantz 2013) and
reduced drunk driving (Ditsuwan et al. 2013).
WORMS AT WORK
1675
 utero or before age three have the largest impacts (Almond and
Currie 2010), and some have argued that interventions outside a
narrow window of child development will not have major effects.
Our evidence suggests that health interventions among school-
aged children, which are too late in life to affect cognition or
height, can have long-run impacts on labor outcomes by affecting
the amount of time people spend in school or work.
Although there is a literature on differences in work hours
across wealthy countries (Prescott 2004), the determinants of
labor hours in poor countries are less studied. Work hours are
quite low in some low-income settings (Fafchamps 1993), includ-
ing among our control group. The findings here suggest that poor
child health may be one factor behind this low adult labor supply.
Finally, our analysis does not account for potential negative
externalities from deworming through drug resistance. Geerts
and Gryseels (2000, 2001) highlight mass deworming policy
approaches that could minimize the development of resistance,
and although there is limited current evidence on drug resistance
related to human deworming, it has been documented in livestock
(Albonico, Engels, and Savioli 2004). Despite their concerns,
Geerts and Gryseels (2001) still conclude that community-based
mass deworming treatment makes sense in high-morbidity set-
tings, such as our Kenyan study area, and we agree it is unlikely
that resistance would be large enough to overturn the case for
subsidies. Worm prevalence is likely to decline over time with
economic development, as more people have sanitation facilities,
wear shoes, and take other actions to avoid infection, and it is
therefore unlikely to be optimal to hold back on treating the sick
today to ‘‘save’’ the drug for later. Moreover, if there is a need to
cut back on drug administration to reduce the risk that resistance
will develop, cutting back on veterinary use in high-income coun-
tries may be a more appropriate initial response.
