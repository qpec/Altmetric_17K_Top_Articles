Abstract
An individual’s chronotype reflects how the circadian system embeds itself into the 24-h day
with rhythms in physiology, cognition and behavior occurring accordingly earlier or later. In
view of an increasing number of people working at unusual times and linked health and
safety risks, the wide range in human chronotypes may provide opportunities to allow peo-
ple to work (and sleep) at times that are in synch with their circadian physiology. We aimed
at estimating the distribution of chronotypes in the US population by age and sex. Twelve
years (2003–2014) of pooled diary data from the American Time Use Survey were used to
calculate chronotype based on mid-point of sleep on weekends (MSFWe, n = 53,689). We
observed a near-normal distribution overall and within each age group. The distribution’s
mean value is systematically different with age, shifting later during adolescence, showing a
peak in ‘lateness’ at ~19 years, and shifting earlier thereafter. Men are typically later chrono-
types than women before 40, but earlier types after 40. The greatest differences are
observed between 15 and 25 for both sexes, equaling more than 50% of the total chrono-
type difference across all age groups. The variability in chronotype decreases with age, but
is generally higher in males than females. This is the first study to estimate the distribution
and prevalence of individual chronotypes in the US population based on a large-scale,
nationally representative sample. Our finding that adolescents are on average the latest
chronotypes supports delaying school start times to benefit their sleep and circadian align-
ment. The generally wide range in chronotypes may provide opportunities for tailored work
schedules by matching external and internal time, potentially decreasing long- and short-
term health and safety risks.
Introduction
The human circadian system actively synchronizes (entrains) to the 24-h day via environmen-
tal signals of light and darkness. Individuals entrain differently depending on exogenous (i.e.,
light exposure) and endogenous (i.e., circadian response characteristics) factors that produce
different phenotypes, known as chronotypes [1]. Chronotype refers to the phase of

 entrainment of an individual, reflecting how the circadian system embeds itself into the 24-h
day. Rhythms in physiology, cognition and behavior reach their peaks and valleys accordingly
earlier or later, thereby creating individual temporal niches that can be separated by as much
as ten hours [2]. These differences are apparent in rhythms of sleep and wake with late chrono-
types exhibiting later sleep times, the ability to extend their sleep into the day (e.g., after a night
shift), as well as more flexible day-to-day sleep times [3].
An increasing number of people are working unusual hours. Currently 30% of the U.S.
workforce has to alternate, rotate or extend shifts, or follow on-call duty [4]. These unusual
work schedules are linked with increased risks for health and safety [5–8]. Finding ways to fos-
ter a safe and healthy environment for all workers is both a legal and a social responsibility.
The wide range in chronotypes in the population may provide opportunities to synch workers
to their individual optimal working times that align external demands and internal rhythms,
thereby minimizing potentially adverse health effects. Vetter et al. [9] demonstrated that sleep
and circadian alignment improved in a rotating shift schedule that was tailored to employees’
individual chronotypes. These findings may translate into long-term health benefits: another
study by Vetter et al. [10] showed in a cohort of 64,615 nurses that the mismatch of chronotype
and working time (i.e., late types working daytime schedules) significantly increased the risk
for type 2 diabetes. However, to better inform interventions, we need to understand the popu-
lation distribution of chronotypes, as well as to what extent chronotype varies by age for males
and females. Previous studies on this topic are scarce, and mainly only cover rather small sam-
ples (n < 1,000).
The first large-scale study to describe age- and sex-related differences in human chrono-
types was conducted by Roenneberg and colleagues in 2004 [11]. Based on an Internet survey
of ~25,000 individuals in predominantly German-speaking countries, they described distinct
age and gender-related patterns: Children were most frequently early chronotypes with adoles-
cent age groups being progressively later and showing a maximum in ‘lateness’ at around the
age of 20. After 20, chronotype was earlier again with increasing age. Roenneberg and col-
leagues also reported women to be earlier chronotypes than men for most of adulthood; how-
ever, this difference disappeared after the age of 50. In a separate study of 8,972 individuals
from Northern Italy (age range 10–85 years), Tonetti and colleagues reported similar ages for
the peak in ‘lateness’ in men (~21 y) and women (~17 y), as well as the absence of chronotype
differences between the sexes beyond age 55 [12]. In 2011, Randler [13] obtained a similar pat-
tern of results for the age range of 12–23 years in a sample of 7,480 participants in Germany:
the change from delaying (‘becoming a later chronotype’) to advancing (‘becoming an earlier
chronotype’) was apparent in both sexes (around the age of 21), yet this turn occurred earlier
in females than males. Furthermore, while the delaying proportion was very rapid and pro-
nounced, the turn back to advancing was smoother. Another population-based study in Fin-
land (n = 10,503, aged 25–74 years) showed similar results: with advancing age, the proportion
of early chronotypes increased and the proportion of late types decreased [14].
Only two studies of comparable size were conducted outside Europe. Paine and colleagues
showed in a sample of 2,526 New Zealand adults that participants aged 30–34 years were more
likely to be definite evening types and less likely to be moderate or definite morning types
compared to the age group 45–49 years [15]. Duarte and colleagues assessed diurnal prefer-
ences in a sample of 14,650 Brazilians (5-year age bins from <20 to �60) [16]. Compared to
Roenneberg et al. [11] and Tonetti et al. [12], they observed a different interaction between age
and sex: although women were also earlier chronotypes than men up to the age of 30, this was
reversed in age groups older than 45 (no significant sex-differences were found from 30 to 45
years of age). The inconsistencies in chronotype by age and gender between the European vs.
Brazilian studies might be population-specific, e.g., geographical location and the associated

 variations in sunrise, sunset and day length are important factors for entrainment of the circa-
dian clock, and thus for chronotype [17]. They may also be due to the use of different instru-
ments to assess chronotype. While Duarte et al. applied the MEQ (Morningness-Eveningness-
Questionnaire [18]), Roenneberg et al. and Tonetti et al. both used the MCTQ (Munich
ChronoType Questionnaire [19]). The MEQ asks about the preferred daily timing for a range
of activities (e.g., physical exercise, eating) producing an arbitrary score, whereas the MCTQ
asks and utilizes the actual sleep-wake times on work and work-free days to determine chrono-
type by the mid-point of sleep on days off.
No study to date has described the distribution and influencing factors (i.e., age, sex) of
chronotypes on a nationally representative scale in the United States or North America. Our
aim was therefore to close this gap and provide estimates of the distribution of chronotypes
(based on mid-sleep times) in a large, nationally representative US population sample using
diary data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).
Materials and methods
Study data
For our study sample, we pooled data over a period of 12 years (2003–2014) from the Ameri-
can Time Use Survey (ATUS), which is an annual probability-weighted, cross-sectional and
nationally representative survey used to measure how, where, and with whom Americans
spend their time. Each month, approximately 2,100 people (aged 15 years or older) are ran-
domly selected from a subset of households that have completed their eighth and final month
of interviews for the Current Population Survey, which is the primary source of labor force sta-
tistics for the United States. Response rates for the ATUS were between 50% and 58% for
2003–2014. Respondents participate in an interview via telephone, after first completing a
structured component that gathers information on demographics, work, and home life
characteristics.
In a separate diary component, respondents are asked to provide start and end times of
every activity they participated in during the 24-hour period prior to the interview. Respon-
dents are asked to recall and report every activity they participated in from 4:00 am the day
before the survey through 4:00 am on the day of the survey. Since most people are sleeping at
4:00 am, the end times for the final activity are also recorded (allowing the total duration of the
final activity, which is sleep in many cases, to be determined). We included respondents that
reported being employed (“at work” or “absent”), unemployed (“on layoff” or “looking”) or
retired in the last week, and excluded those not in the labor force due to disability because of a
higher prevalence of sleep disturbances in people with disabilities [20].
Chronotype calculation
An individual’s chronotype can be assessed by mid-sleep on work-free days (MSF) [1]. Mid-
sleep is calculated as the halfway point between sleep onset and sleep offset, for example,
assuming an 8h sleep duration, a chronotype of 4:00 falls asleep at midnight and wakes up at
8:00 the next day. Work-free days (instead of workdays) are used to reduce the influence of
external demands on sleep-wake behavior. Mid-sleeps on workdays tend to be earlier than
those on days off, because many people end their sleep prematurely using alarm clocks to get
up in time for work [2]. Mid-sleep on work-free days is therefore seen as a more accurate
proxy for when sleep is supposed to occur naturally, and has been shown to correlate well with
dim-light melatonin onset, a sleep-facilitating hormone under regulation of the circadian
clock [21–23].

 Optimally, chronotype is calculated from sleep times where sleep offset (waking up) occurs
on a work-free day with no use of alarm clocks. While ATUS allows for determining whether
or not the day of the diary was a work-free day, no such information is available for the follow-
ing day. It is thus unknown if sleep ended on a workday or a day off, or if people woke up by
themselves or if they were woken up. To circumvent this limitation, we assumed that the likeli-
hood for work-free days is highest on weekends (Saturday/Sunday), and therefore only used
mid-sleep times from respondents that completed the diary component on a Friday or a Satur-
day (meaning that sleep offset was on either a Saturday or a Sunday). Accordingly, for the pur-
poses of this study, chronotype was assessed by the mid-point of sleep on weekends (MSFWe).
Although unemployed and retired respondents may have no workdays per definition, the
social structure is often different on weekdays vs. weekends. Chronotype calculation was there-
fore based on only Fri/Sat diary days for all labor force subgroups (i.e., employed, unemployed,
retired) to maximize their comparability.
Since respondents may report several sleep bouts per 24 hours including naps during the
day, we considered only the bout with the longest duration within each individual and
excluded sleep bouts that occurred during the daytime (i.e., mid-sleeps between 12:00 and
20:00). Of these, only sleep bouts with durations between 3h and 14h were considered for
chronotype calculation in order to minimize the risk of including respondents suffering from
insomnia or hypersomnia or due to data error.
Data analyses
Data handling, processing and analyses were conducted in SAS/STAT1 and R [24]. Mid-
sleeps were plotted by age and sex, and a polynomial smoothing function (6th order) was fitted
in R. To test for the influence of age and sex on chronotype, a multiple linear regression model
was computed with age, sex and their interaction term age�sex as independent variables,
adjusted for labor force status (employed (at work, absent) vs. unemployed (on layoff, looking,
retired)), diary day (Friday vs. Saturday) and diary month (Jan–Dec), and duration of the sleep
bout that was used for mid-sleep calculation. T-tests, respectively their non-parametric equiva-
lent, were performed for 2-group comparisons (e.g., females vs. males in the age group 15-
19y). We report mean values and standard deviations within age bins and by sex but given the
cross-sectional design of the study (no repeated measures), standard deviations are not avail-
able when reporting difference values, e.g., magnitude of change in chronotype from age 15 to
20. For analysis purposes, mid-sleep times were linearized, transforming mid-sleeps between
20:00 and 24:00 into values between -4.00 and 0.00. All analyses are weighted using the appro-
priate ATUS weights, which compensate for the survey’s oversampling of certain demographic
groups, the oversampling of weekend day diaries, and differential response rates across demo-
graphic groups. IRB approval was not needed because this was a public database study and no
participants were involved. The ATUS multi-year data files used in this study can be down-
loaded from the ATUS database: https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles_0314.htm. The webpage

Results
Sample description
The ATUS is a federally administered survey interviewing respondents in detail about their
activities (including sleep times) during the last 24 hours. Of initially 55,075 respondents in
the ATUS (pooled over a 12-year period) that reported sleep on a Friday to Saturday or

 Saturday to Sunday (weekend sleep), 53,689 (97.5%) were considered evaluable based upon
our inclusion criteria to analyze their chronotype (assessed by mid-point of sleep on weekends,
MSFWe, see Methods for inclusion criteria). Among the 53,689 persons in the MSFWe group,
there were 30,226 (56.3%) females and 23,463 (43.7%) males, of which 63.2% were employed
(“at work” or “absent”), 5.0% were unemployed (“on layoff” or “looking”), and 31.8% were
retired. Average sleep duration was 8.1h ±1.5h, showing a bell-shaped distribution with
few respondents sleeping very short (4.6% less than 5h) or very long (5.8% more than 11h)
(Fig 1a).
Distribution and variability of chronotype
The overall distribution of chronotypes (MSFWe, see Methods for calculation details) follows a
near-normal distribution with a slight positive skew (Fig 2a). The range of chronotypes in our
sample spans almost 10 hours (MSFWe
earliest = 0:00, MSFWe
latest = 9:53). Twenty-five percent
show a chronotype earlier than 2:24, 50% fall between 2:24 and 4:15, and another 25% show a
chronotype later than 4:15. Chronotype showed no relationship with sleep duration (univari-
ate regression model: b = -0.0004, p > 0.05). Variance in chronotype appeared slightly higher
for short and long sleep durations but the number of respondents was also much lower for
these durations (Fig 1b). Importantly, we observe this bell-shape not only for the overall sam-
ple but also within each age group (5-year bins), meaning that extreme early and late chrono-
types exist at every age (see Fig 2b for comparison of age groups 20-24y and 70-74y). However,
the variability in chronotype (measured as standard deviation of mid-sleep times) is different
according to age: increased during adolescence and largest in the age group 20–24 years (2.36h
in women and 2.65h in men), differences in chronotype are decreased for older age groups
showing a minimum variation of 1.66h in women between 75–79 years and 1.57h in men at 80
and older (Fig 3a). Accordingly, men show a greater variability in mid-sleep times than
women before the age of 60–64 indicating that extreme chronotypes at both ends are more fre-
quent in men than women for most of their lives (see Figs 2c and 3a). Performing a sensitivity
analysis restricting sleep durations to 5-11h (instead of 3-14h) did not change the findings:
MSFWe
3-14h = 3:26 ±2.31h vs. MSFWe
3-14h = 3:25 ±2.26), p > 0.05 (see Fig 1c).
Influence of age and sex on chronotype
Chronotype shows a distinct relationship with age and sex (Fig 3b): progressively later MSFWe
are observed in both men and women during childhood and adolescence reaching a peak in
‘lateness’ at the age of 18.4 years (MSFWe = 4:27) in females and 19.2 years in males (MSFWe =
4:40) (based on smoothing functions; maxima of average values are much later: 4:52 and 5:02,
respectively) (see also Fig 2d for comparison of males and females in the age group 15–19
years). This peak marks a sharp turn from increasingly later to increasingly earlier MSFWe
with advancing age, showing similar chronotypes in seniors and children (MSFWe
70y = 2:49,
MSFWe
10y = 3:09; extrapolated data). The linear slope is steepest for both sexes between 15 and
20, equaling an average difference (delay) in chronotype of 0.76h in girls and 1.01h in boys (bfe-
males = 0.14h/8min per age group, bmales = 0.18h/11min per age group). The subsequent
advance to a similar chronotype of age 15 takes approximately the same time in women but
about twice as long in men (bfemales = -0.26h/16min per age group, bmales = -0.12h/7min per
age group). Importantly, chronotype differences are largest between the ages 15 and 25, where
we see a total difference of 1.85h in women (0.76h delay and 1.09h advance) and of 1.89h in
men (1.01h delay and 0.88h advance). Across all age groups in our sample, the chronotype
range (MSFWe
latest−MSFWe
earliest) spans 2.12h in women and 2.46h in men but equals a total
difference (adding delay and advance proportions) of 2.88h and 3.47h, respectively. In other

 words, 64% (females), respectively, 55% (males) of this total difference is observed in the age
groups 15–25 years. The difference between males and females is largest at 21.6 years (0.27h/
16min, based on smoothing functions) and disappears at 41.4 years (2nd intercept), only to
become evident again shortly thereafter. While after the peak gradually earlier MSFWe are
observed in both sexes with increasing age (groups 20-70y), women show a rather long plateau,
with little or no difference in chronotype between 35 and 55. The plateau is also observed in
men but for a much shorter period (40-50y). After the age of 41, women show on average a
later chronotype than men (0.26h/16min), reversing the pattern prevailing before the age of
41. This sex difference disappears again at 79.1 years (3rd intercept). Average mid-sleep times
are shown in Table 1 for all ages separately for men and women.

(n = 30,226) and males (n = 23,463), and d) for males (n = 1,809) and females (n = 1,698) in the age group 15–19 years. Although bell-
shaped at all ages, older age groups show leptokurtic distributions with the distribution average shifted to the left (earlier chronotypes) (panel
b). Extreme early (MSFWe < 2:00) and extreme late (MSFWe > 6:00) chronotypes are more frequent in men than women (panel c). While
frequencies are higher for girls than boys (15-19y) among early chronotypes (i.e., MSFWe < 3:00), they are higher for boys among late types
(i.e., MSFWe > 6:00), overall resulting in a slightly advanced chronotype for girls in this age group (MSFWe
females = 4:24 ±1.97h vs.
MSFWe
males = 4:31 ±1.99h, p = 0.051) (panel d).

 Computing a multiple regression model adjusted for labor force status, sleep duration, and
day and month of the diary confirms the significant impact of age (b = -0.21h, p < 0.001), sex
(b = -0.31h, p < 0.001) and their interaction term (bage�sex = 0.05h, p < 0.001) on chronotype
(Table 2). Sleep duration, diary day and labor force status are also statistically significant fac-
tors (b = -0.04, b = 0.22h and b = 0.08h, all p < 0.001): mid-sleep times are on average 2 min-
utes earlier for every hour more sleep, 13 minutes later for sleep between Saturday and Sunday

 than for sleep between Friday and Saturday, and 5 minutes later for unemployed compared
with employed respondents.
To test whether the year of the survey might have influenced our results (i.e., cohort effect),
we examined the relationship of chronotype with age and sex by survey year (2003–2014). The
same pattern was observed in every year, showing a peak in adolescent groups and earlier
MSFWe in older age groups (Fig 3c). Later survey years (2011–2014) showed a trend towards
earlier chronotypes on average based on smaller peaks (earlier MSFWe) in adolescent groups
but this was not significant (linear regression model; survey year: b = -0.001, year�age: b =
-0.0002, year�sex: b = -0.016, year�age�sex = 0.002, all p > 0.05).
Discussion
This is the first study to estimate the distribution of individual chronotypes in the US popula-
tion based on diary data in a large-scale, nationally representative sample from the American
Time Use Survey. Self-reported sleep times were used to calculate mid-sleeps on weekends as a
proxy for chronotype (MSFWe). A near-normal distribution is observed both overall and in
each age group indicating that very early and very late chronotypes are present at all ages, how-
ever mean values change systematically across the lifespan. Chronotype becomes later in both
sexes throughout adolescence, reaching a peak in ‘lateness’ at ~18 years for women and ~19
years for men. Men delay faster between the ages of 15 and 20 and advance more slowly
between 20 and 40, resulting in a later chronotype on average than women during this period.
This pattern is reversed beyond 40 years of age, when men show earlier chronotypes than
women (by approximately the same magnitude of ~15min). More than 50% of the lifelong
chronotype change occurs during adolescence and early adulthood, while variability decreases
with age.
Adolescents are on average the latest chronotypes
Our findings are generally consistent with previous studies showing a peak in lateness during
late adolescence/ early adulthood and a steady advance in chronotype thereafter [11–13, 16].
This marked turn has been proposed as a marker for the “end of adolescence” suggesting the
involvement of hormones interacting with the circadian system [11]. Young people, including
senior high school students, are on average the latest chronotypes in society, and their delayed
sleep-wake rhythms clash with school start times resulting in pronounced discrepancies
between sleep-wake behavior and associated physiological rhythms. They produce a strong
weekly structure in sleep-wake behavior alternating between short and early sleep during the
school week and long and late recovery sleep on weekends. This is essentially the same phe-
nomenon as jetlag that occurs when traveling across time zones, and has even been termed
“social jetlag” [25, 26]. According to the CDC, 82.3% of public schools in the US (with an esti-
mated total enrollment of 4.2 million students) start school at 8:30 a.m. or earlier [27]. Our
study shows an average chronotype of 4:30 a.m. in the group of 17- and 18-year olds, suggest-
ing that senior high school students get up and go to school in their biological night. Sleep
plays a vital role in adolescents’ physical and mental health, and performance [28–30], and the
American Academy for Sleep Medicine recommends 8–10 hours of sleep on a regular basis for
adolescents aged 13 to 18 to promote optimal health [31]. Our findings suggest that adoles-
cents’ chronotypes are on average too late for school start times before 8:30 a.m., i.e., many
may not be able to advance their sleep enough to get sufficient sleep, which is in line with
another CDC report showing that 68.8% of US high school students sleep less than 8h during
an average school night [32]. Evidence is mounting that one simple and effective (yet not the
only) way to benefit adolescent sleep is to delay school start times [33].

 Men and women are different chronotypes–depending on age
Previous studies have reported the disappearance of a sex difference in chronotype around the
age of 50 [11, 12] and attributed this to changes in the endocrine system, coinciding with the
average onset of menopause in women. In contrast to their findings, and in line with Duarte
et al. [16], we observed an interaction between sex and age: women were on average earlier
chronotypes than men until the age of 40 but later types thereafter. Importantly, women over
40 were later chronotypes relative to men, but not relative to women before the age of 40. This
reversed chronotype difference between males and females over 40 in our data is mainly due
to the rather long plateau in the chronotype profile of females (between 35–50 years). Hor-
monal changes might act as modulators for an aging circadian system, causing a slow-down in
women between 35 and 50 (and a speed-up in men aged 55 to 65). Studies examining circadian
differences between males and females usually report an earlier phase of core body tempera-
ture (CBT) and melatonin rhythms in women than men [34–38]. These studies, conducted
with younger subjects (<30yrs), are consistent with our results and previous findings that sug-
gest that women are earlier chronotypes than men during adolescence and early adulthood.
Only one study looked at circadian period (estimated from CBT and melatonin data) in both
younger (<35yrs) and older (>50yrs) individuals observing no interaction between age and
sex: women had, on average, a shorter period than men in both age groups [39]. Although cir-
cadian period is one factor impacting upon phase (shorter periods result in earlier phases
[40]), other factors such as circadian amplitude might account for further variance [41]. Differ-
ences in chronotype between females and males as well as among different age groups may
also have non-hormonal causes, e.g., differences in family life (e.g., typically-‘female’ responsi-
bilities such as household chores and childcare), work regimes (e.g., shift work) as well as
somatic and mental disorders (e.g., depression [14]), that may feed back onto the circadian
clock via modification of internal bodily processes and/or light-dark exposure (‘zeitnehmer
loop’ [42]).
Chronotype differs largely among individuals at any age but is less
variable in older individuals and women
The large differences in chronotype are up to 10h among individuals of any age, consistent
with previous studies (e.g., [2]). The average chronotype for people between 25 and 65 years
lies between 3:58 (±2.49h) and 2:58 (±1.98h), and assuming 8-h sleep need, optimal sleep for
these chronotypes falls between 0:00 and 8:00, respectively, between 23:00 and 7:00. Assuming
35min for morning routine and taking into account an average US commute time of 25min
[43], a worker requiring 8h of sleep would need to be as early as 3:00 a.m. for a work start time
of 8:00 a.m. Our findings show that as much as 60% have a later chronotype, and probably suf-
fer from at least some amount of social jetlag and sleep loss. The extent may vary with age, sex,
social responsibilities, job schedule (i.e., night and shift work) and importantly, individual
sleep need (i.e., similar to chronotype, sleep duration shows a large inter-individual variance
[2, 44], as was also observed in this study) but is likely to be the highest among adolescents.
Although the wide range of chronotypes can be observed across all ages, the variability in
chronotype decreases with increasing age (resulting in leptokurtic distributions in older age
groups). This might be due to age-related differences in the likelihood of sleep at different cir-
cadian phases meaning that the range of times at which older individuals can readily sleep is
narrower, thus limiting the variance in chronotype [45]. However, again this observation
could be related to less variability in social responsibilities such as when individuals get older
there may be less variability in what they need to get up for on a weekend (such as taking care
of children and children’s activities). The men in our sample showed on average a greater

 range of chronotypes (MSFWe
latest−MSFWe
earliest) as well as a greater range of chronotype vari-
ability (sdlargest−sdsmallest) than women, suggesting that their sleep-wake behavior (and proba-
bly circadian system) might be more variable. Two studies looked at sex differences in
circadian amplitude, and found lower melatonin amplitude in males than females [36, 46].
Lower amplitude may reflect a weaker intrinsic oscillator, thus accounting for a higher vari-
ability in the output, i.e., phase of behavioral rhythms. However, this finding is inconsistent
across studies as one study reported that the amplitude of CBT was larger in men than women
[36].
Sleep duration, employment status and diary day influence chronotype
With each additional hour of sleep, chronotype was 2 minutes earlier; among unemployed
respondents, chronotype was on average 5 minutes later than that of employed respondents.
Both effects were significant but are negligible differences (note that sleep duration was signifi-
cant only when adjusted for other variables, including age and sex). When chronotype
(MSFWe) assessment was based on Fri-Sat sleep, mid-sleep times were significantly later by 13
minutes than for Sat-Sun sleep. Assuming the majority of people work weekdays and have
weekends off, this may be due to Fri-Sat sleep being influenced by work on Friday: getting up
earlier for work increases the time awake and thus homeostatic sleep pressure, advancing sleep
onset and accordingly mid-sleep times. Moreover, because of Friday being a workday for
many people, Saturdays are often used for social events offering a night between two days off.
A study assessing dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), considered a phase marker of the circa-
dian master clock, showed that DLMO delayed progressively over the weekend [47]. Although
mid-sleep times derived from Saturday diaries seem better suited for determining chronotype,
we argue MSFWe derived from Friday diaries is still a more accurate chronotype estimate than
mid-sleep on weekdays (MSW). Both sleep on- and offset used to calculate MSW are influ-
enced by workdays while it is mainly sleep onset for MSFWe on Fridays with the opportunity
to sleep in on Saturdays.
Limitations
One important limitation of our data is the lack of information regarding the next day after
the diary day (i.e., workday/work-free day and use of alarm clocks/wake-up mode). This may
have resulted in an over-estimation of early types in our sample. Indeed, when choosing cut-
offs from earlier studies to classify chronotypes as early (<3:00), intermediate (3:00–5:00) and
late (>5:00) [2], we find 40% early, 44% intermediate and only 16% late chronotypes. Cut-offs
are sensitive to the study population (e.g., race/ethnicity [48, 49]) and other differences need to
be examined, such as latitude and longitude [50], position within a time zone [17], and work
schedules (day work vs. shift work) [51, 52]. Thus, cut-offs should be interpreted with caution.
The response rate in the ATUS was only fair (50–58%) with no information about non-
responders and may indicate there could be time use bias as we might expect that those who
are busier may not have as much time available to participate. However, we note that the distri-
bution of hours worked and hours slept in the ATUS is overall representative of the national
population, as reported elsewhere [53], and therefore we believe that any non-response bias
would have little effect on our analyses. Furthermore, because we excluded respondents not in
the labor force due to disabilities, the study sample is not nationally representative of the gen-
eral population but representative of employed, retired and non-disabled unemployed
respondents.
Mid-sleep times calculated from self-reported sleep times may be subject to recall bias or
individual rounding to systematic increments. Sleep bouts used for chronotype calculation

 were restricted to durations between 3h and 14h to minimize the risk of including people suf-
fering from sleep disorders or data errors, however this may lead to misclassification, e.g.,
short sleep durations that reflect work-related sleep (before or after a shift). This would result
in an over-estimation of extreme early or late chronotypes. Likewise, because information
about previous sleep is not available in the ATUS, we could not apply the mid-sleep correction
for sleep loss on workdays [26], which may have resulted in over-estimating the proportion of
late chronotypes. Yet, given that the distribution of chronotypes in our study is highly similar
to previous findings and that our findings did not change when restricting sleep durations to
5-11h, we argue that the extent of misclassification was minimal overall.
We interpret the age-specific chronotype pattern as changes over time as have studies
before ours [11, 16] but given the cross-sectional nature of the data we cannot exclude that the
actual age course might be different. Middle-term evidence for an age effect comes from a
study that followed adolescents for 2.5 years showing that DLMO indeed delayed over this
period [54]. First long-term support is provided by Broms and colleagues who analyzed the
age-standardized chronotype of 567 male individuals in Finland, assessed in 1985 and 2008
[55]. They found that in most individuals, chronotype shifted towards ‘more morningness’, i.
e., 66% of evening types and 47% of somewhat evening types advanced. They also found that
chronotype changed in only very few from clearly evening to clearly morning and vice versa,
suggesting that the relative position of an individual within the distribution is fairly stable. Fur-
thermore, because of the cross-sectional study design and the limited survey period of twelve
years, we cannot distinguish a cohort effect from an age effect. There is some evident that the
proportion of late chronotypes has grown larger over the past decades [26, 55], possibly due to
the increased use of light-emitting devices such as laptops and smartphones. Their use espe-
cially in the evening, and thus exposure to blue-enriched light after dark, has been shown to be
associated with melatonin suppression, and delayed circadian phase and sleep patterns [56,
57]. Nevertheless, Roenneberg et al. [11] found a similar age-specific chronotype profile when
looking at yearly entries in their large database between 2003 and 2012, providing some evi-
dence for an age- vs. cohort- effect. We confirmed their finding in our study, observing the
same age- and sex-pattern for each year of survey (2003–2012).
Conclusions
Given the cross-sectional design of all large-scale chronotype studies, longitudinal data collec-
tion is needed to characterize individual trajectories. Future studies looking at working time,
sleep and health are encouraged to include a chronotype measure to account for potential
effect modification, especially in samples with great age spans. Our finding that adolescents on
average are the latest chronotypes of all age groups argues for debate on delayed school start
times that may benefit sleep and circadian alignment. The generally wide range in chronotypes
of up to 10h is both challenge and opportunity in a 24/7-society. Great diversity implies that
not everyone can be accommodated but contrary to “one size fits all”-approaches, it also pro-
vides opportunities for flexible work arrangements and tailored shift schedules that make use
of individuals’ temporal niches to increase the match between work and circadian time, and
thus decrease long and short-term health and safety risks.
