Abstract
Background—In Western populations, a higher level of fruit consumption has been associated 
with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but little is known about such associations in China, 
where the consumption level is low and rates of stroke are high.
Methods—Between 2004 and 2008, we recruited 512,891 adults, 30 to 79 years of age, from 10 
diverse localities in China. During 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, 5173 deaths from 
cardiovascular disease, 2551 incident major coronary events (fatal or nonfatal), 14,579 ischemic 
strokes, and 3523 intracerebral hemorrhages were recorded among the 451,665 participants who 
did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or antihypertensive treatments at baseline. Cox 
regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios relating fresh fruit consumption to disease rates.
Results—Overall, 18.0% of participants reported consuming fresh fruit daily. As compared with 
participants who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit (the “nonconsumption” category), those who 
ate fresh fruit daily had lower systolic blood pressure (by 4.0 mm Hg) and blood glucose levels (by 
0.5 mmol per liter [9.0 mg per deciliter]) (P<0.001 for trend for both comparisons). The adjusted 
hazard ratios for daily consumption versus nonconsumption were 0.60 (95% confidence interval

 [CI], 0.54 to 0.67) for cardiovascular death, and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.75), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 
0.79), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74), respectively, for incident major coronary events, ischemic 
stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. There was a strong loglinear dose–response relationship between 
the incidence of each outcome and the amount of fresh fruit consumed. These associations were 
similar across the 10 study regions and in subgroups of participants defined by baseline 
characteristics.
Conclusions—Among Chinese adults, a higher level of fruit consumption was associated with 
lower blood pressure and blood glucose levels and, largely independent of these and other dietary 
and nondietary factors, with significantly lower risks of major cardiovascular diseases. (Funded by 
the Wellcome Trust and others.)
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide and is 
responsible for more than 17 million deaths annually, with approximately 80% of the disease 
burden in low- and middle-income countries, such as China.1 A low level of fruit 
consumption is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, accounting for an estimated 
104 million disability-adjusted lifeyears worldwide in 2010,2 including approximately 30 
million in China.3 However, these estimates were based mainly on findings from Western 
studies, with little reliable evidence from China and other developing countries, where diet, 
lifestyle factors, and disease patterns differ substantially from those in Western populations.
3–5 Moreover, most previous studies tended to involve a combination of fresh and processed 
fruit (frozen, dried, or canned fruit or fruit juice), with limited data specifically on fresh 
fruit, which is usually consumed raw as a snack in China. Furthermore, the associations of 
fruit intake with stroke subtypes, especially hemorrhagic stroke, are less well established 
than the association with ischemic heart disease,3,6,7 underscoring the importance of 
performing studies in China, where rates of stroke (particularly hemorrhagic stroke) are 
high. We examined the association of fresh fruit consumption with risks of major 
cardiovascular events in China, where fresh fruit consumption is low, although fresh 
vegetable consumption is high.8
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The China Kadoorie Biobank Study is a nationwide, prospective cohort study involving 10 
diverse localities (regions) in China, which is jointly coordinated by the University of 
Oxford and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The study design and methods have 
been reported previously. 9,10 Approval of the study was obtained from ethics committees 
or institutional review boards at the University of Oxford, the Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention (China CDC), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and all 
participating regions. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, 
preparation of the manuscript, or the decision to submit it for publication.
Baseline Survey
We selected 10 regional study sites (5 urban and 5 rural) in order to cover a wide range of 
risk exposures and disease patterns, taking into account the accuracy and completeness of 
death and disease registries for each region and the local capability to gather the necessary

 study data. Between June 2004 and July 2008, all nondisabled, permanent residents of each 
region who were 35 to 74 years of age were invited to participate in the study. Of the total of 
approximately 1.8 million eligible adults in these regions, almost 1 in 3 (33% in rural areas 
and 27% in urban areas) responded. Overall, 512,891 persons were recruited, including a 
few who were just outside the targeted age range, and all provided written informed consent.
At the local study clinics, trained health workers administered a laptop-based questionnaire 
on sociodemographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption, diet, physical 
activity, and medical history; measured height, weight, waist circumference, and blood 
pressure; and performed spot random blood glucose testing using the SureStep Plus System 
(Johnson & Johnson). Blood pressure was measured at least twice with the use of an 
automated digital blood-pressure monitor (model UA-779, A&D Medical) after at least 5 
minutes of rest in a seated position; the mean of two satisfactory measurements was used for 
analyses.11,12
Dietary data covered 12 major food groups: rice, wheat products, other staple foods, meat, 
poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit, and 
soybean products. Respondents were asked about the frequency of habitual consumption 
during the previous 12 months and chose among five categories of frequency (daily, 4 to 6 
days per week, 1 to 3 days per week, monthly, or never or rarely [the reference category]). In 
a subsample of 926 participants, the survey questionnaire was repeated within a year after 
the baseline assessment (mean interval, 5.4 months) in order to assess the reproducibility of 
the responses.
Resurveys
After completion of the baseline survey, we randomly selected 5 to 6% of the original 
participants for two resurveys, using procedures similar to those at baseline. The first 
resurvey took place from July through October 2008, with 19,788 participants resurveyed, 
and the second was conducted from August 2013 through September 2014, with just over 
25,000 participants resurveyed. In addition to questions about the frequency of consumption, 
the second resurvey questionnaire asked about the amount consumed for each food group, 
which was used as a proxy measure to estimate the average consumption at baseline for each 
of the five frequency categories (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org).
Follow-up and Outcome Measures
The vital status of each participant was determined periodically through the Disease 
Surveillance Points (DSP) system of the China CDC.13 The DSP vital-status data sets were 
checked annually against local residential records and health insurance records and were 
confirmed with street committees or village administrators. In addition, information about 
major diseases and episodes of hospitalization was collected through linkages with disease 
registries (for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes) and national health insurance 
claims databases. The Chinese National Health Insurance scheme provides electronic 
linkage to all hospitalization data.

 Fatal and nonfatal events were documented according to the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), by coders who were unaware of the baseline 
characteristics of the study participants.10 The four main outcome measures that were 
examined were cardiovascular death (ICD-10 codes I00 to I25, I27 to I88, and I95 to I99) 
and the incidence of major coronary events (fatal ischemic heart disease [codes I20 to I25] 
plus nonfatal myocardial infarction [code I21]), hemorrhagic stroke (code I61), and ischemic 
stroke (code I63). Other ischemic heart disease (i.e., ischemic heart disease not meeting the 
criteria for a major coronary event) and other cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-10 codes I60, 
I62, and I64 to I69) were analyzed separately. For analyses of incident disease, only the first 
cardiovascular event was counted.
Statistical Analysis
For the current study, we excluded persons who had a history of cardiovascular disease 
(23,132 persons) or antihypertensive treatment (48,174 persons) at baseline. Baseline 
characteristics of the remaining 451,665 participants were described as means and standard 
deviations or percentages in each category of fruit consumption, with adjustment for age, 
sex, and region as appropriate, by means of either multiple linear regression (for continuous 
outcomes) or logistic regression (for binary outcomes). The marginal mean values and 95% 
confidence intervals for body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, and 
blood glucose according to frequency of fruit consumption were estimated separately for 
men and women with the use of multiple linear regression models adjusted for baseline 
covariates.
Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for relative 
risks in relation to fruit consumption, with adjustment for baseline covariates and with 
stratification according to age at risk (in 5-year intervals), sex, and region. For analyses 
involving more than two exposure categories, the floatingabsolute- risk method was used, 
which provides the variance of the logarithm of the hazard ratio (i.e., to compute a 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio) for each category (including the reference category) 
to facilitate comparisons among the different exposure categories.14 Conventional 
(unfloated) analyses were also performed so that the results of the two methods could be 
compared. We calculated the hazard ratio for cardiovascular death with nondaily fruit 
consumption as compared with daily consumption in order to estimate the population-
attributable fraction, using the formula Pe(HR − 1) ÷ [Pe(HR − 1) + 1],15 where Pe is the 
prevalence of nondaily consumption of fresh fruit in the Chinese population, and HR is the 
hazard ratio. Additional information about the statistical analyses is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patterns of Fresh Fruit Consumption
Among the 451,665 participants included in the study, the mean age was 50.5 years (range, 
30 to 79); 58.8% of the participants were women, and 42.5% were from urban areas (Table 
1). Overall, 18.0% of participants reported consumption of fresh fruit on a daily basis, 9.4% 
reported consumption 4 to 6 days per week, and 6.3% reported no or rare consumption (also

 referred to as nonconsumption). The proportion of participants with regular fruit 
consumption (i.e., 4 to 6 days per week or more) was inversely associated with age among 
rural participants and urban women (Fig. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Among urban men, however, the association was U-shaped, with men who were 50 to 55 
years of age (preretirement age in China) reporting the lowest consumption. There was no 
south-tonorth gradient in fruit consumption, with two urban areas (Qingdao and Harbin) 
having the highest consumption and two rural areas (Henan and Hunan) having the lowest 
consumption (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Spearman correlation 
coefficient of 0.55 between responses a few months apart indicated moderate reliability of 
the measure of fruit-consumption frequency (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Participants who consumed fresh fruit more frequently (as compared with those who 
consumed it less frequently) were more likely to be women and to live in urban areas, were 
younger, had a higher level of education and higher household income, and were less likely 
to smoke or drink alcohol regularly and more likely to consume dairy products and meat, but 
they had similar levels of consumption of preserved and fresh vegetables (Table 1). Our 
participants had an overall mean BMI (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the 
height in meters) of 23.5 and overall mean systolic blood pressure of 128.8 mm Hg. As 
compared with participants who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit, the BMI of daily 
consumers was 0.5 points higher, the waist circumference 0.9 cm larger, the blood pressure 
4.0 mm Hg systolic lower and 1.4 mm Hg diastolic lower, and the blood glucose level 0.5 
mmol per liter (9.0 mg per deciliter) lower (Fig. 1). These associations were largely 
unchanged after additional adjustment for potential confounders or mediators, except for 
systolic blood pressure, for which the association was attenuated by about one fifth (to 3.3 
mm Hg in men and to 2.2 mm Hg in women).
Association of Fruit Consumption with Cardiovascular Outcomes
During 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, there were 5173 cardiovascular deaths, 2551 
major coronary events (plus 16,563 other ischemic heart disease events), 14,579 ischemic 
strokes, and 3523 hemorrhagic strokes (plus 11,054 other cerebrovascular disease events) 
recorded. The risks of these major cardiovascular events were strongly and inversely 
associated with the level of fruit consumption (P<0.001 for trend, for all comparisons) (Fig. 
2 and Table 2). As compared with nonconsumption, the adjusted hazard ratios for daily 
consumption were 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.67) for cardiovascular 
death, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.75) for major coronary events, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.79) 
for ischemic stroke, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74) for hemorrhagic stroke. After correction 
for regression dilution bias, the associations were approximately log-linear; the hazard ratios 
for one daily portion of fruit were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.72), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.83), 
0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.85), and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.81), respectively. The level of fruit 
consumption was also significantly and inversely associated with risks of other ischemic 
heart disease and other cerebrovascular diseases, although the associations were less strong 
(Table 2, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
With the exception of ischemic stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, the associations 
between the level of fruit consumption and the risk of major cardiovascular events did not

 appear to be modified by baseline characteristics such as sex, age, region, or season of 
enrollment (Fig. 3, and Fig. S5 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). For ischemic 
stroke, the association appeared to be somewhat greater among men, participants from urban 
areas, those who drank alcohol regularly, those with higher educational levels, and those 
with higher blood glucose levels (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). None of the 
associations or interactions were materially attenuated by additional adjustment for BMI, 
waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and blood glucose level (Fig. S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In our study, approximately 95% of participants reported daily consumption of fresh 
vegetables. Additional adjustment for consumption of fresh vegetables and other dietary 
variables did not alter the risk estimates for fresh fruit consumption (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Likewise, the exclusion of the first 2 years of follow-up in order 
to further reduce the effect of reverse causality did not materially change the observed 
associations (data not shown).
Population-Attributable Fraction of Low Fruit Consumption
The hazard ratio for cardiovascular death with nondaily versus daily fruit consumption was 
1.30 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.46). In our second resurvey, about 65% of the participants reported 
nondaily fruit consumption (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), which was in line 
with the proportion in the most recent China Health and Nutrition Survey, conducted in 
2011.16 We performed an exploratory analysis to estimate the effect of fruit consumption on 
cardiovascular death under the assumption that there is a causal association. On the basis of 
this assumption, our data suggest that 16% (95% CI, 10 to 23) of deaths from cardiovascular 
causes could be attributed to low fruit consumption. Applying this proportion to national 
data on cardiovascular mortality17 suggests that about 560,000 (95% CI, 350,000 to 
800,000) deaths from cardiovascular causes each year, including about 200,000 before 70 
years of age, could be prevented if daily consumption of fresh fruit were universal in China. 
However, it is difficult to establish causality reliably in observational studies of dietary 
factors that have such moderate relative risks and potential for confounding.
Discussion
In our study involving more than 450,000 men and women in China without prior 
cardiovascular disease or antihypertensive treatment, higher fresh fruit consumption was 
associated with significantly lower levels of blood pressure and blood glucose. Largely 
independent of blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and other dietary and nondietary 
factors, higher fruit consumption was also associated with significantly lower risks of 
cardiovascular disease, including cardiovascular death, major coronary events, hemorrhagic 
stroke, and ischemic stroke. These associations were consistent across 10 regions and in 
various subgroups of participants defined by various baseline characteristics. If these 
associations are largely causal, the potential health gain from increased consumption of fresh 
fruit in China would be substantial.
Several large prospective studies of mostly Western populations have assessed the 
association of fruit consumption with cardiovascular disease.18–25 Most of them showed an

 inverse association, but the magnitude of the benefit varied considerably, and the association 
was typically weaker than that observed in the current study. For example, in a recent meta-
analysis of six studies involving nearly 680,000 participants and 10,000 cardiovascular 
deaths, each additional serving (80 g) of fruit per day was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 0 
to 9) lower risk of cardiovascular death, which is not good evidence of a real protective 
effect.19 Only one previous prospective study in China has shown an association between 
fresh fruit consumption and cardiovascular risk. In that study, involving approximately 
130,000 adults from Shanghai and approximately 1600 cardiovascular deaths during follow-
up, the risk of cardiovascular death among people in the highest quintile of fruit 
consumption was about 30% lower than among those in the lowest quintile,26 but no overall 
association with the incidence of major coronary events was observed, perhaps in part 
because of the small number of such events (365).27 Information on the association between 
fruit consumption and stroke subtypes is limited, 18 especially for hemorrhagic stroke, 
which is relatively uncommon in Western populations. In our study, which involved more 
than 3500 hemorrhagic strokes, we found that higher consumption of fresh fruit was 
associated with a significantly lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, largely independent of 
blood pressure.
The association between the level of fruit consumption and cardiovascular risk in our study 
(a 40% lower risk of cardiovascular death and a 34% lower risk of major coronary events 
among participants who consumed fresh fruit daily as compared with those who never or 
rarely consumed fresh fruit) was much stronger than the associations observed in previous 
studies. Several factors may account for this difference. First, unlike many previous studies, 
our study focused on fresh fruit, which is universally consumed raw in China, perhaps 
maximizing its potential benefits.23,28 Moreover, the average level of fruit consumption in 
the Chinese population is very low,8 and there is evidence that the association of fruit 
consumption with disease risks may be particularly strong at the low end of the range of 
intake (i.e., fewer than two servings per day).19 In addition, our analyses excluded not only 
persons with a history of cardiovascular disease but also those receiving antihypertensive 
treatment, thereby reducing confounding by medication use. Our analysis also takes into 
account regression dilution bias,29,30 whereas previously, few large, prospective studies 
have dealt with this important issue.20
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not collect information on processed fruit 
because its consumption is extremely low in China. Second, we were unable to properly 
examine the association of fresh vegetables with cardiovascular risk because daily 
consumption is almost universal in our study population. Third, fruit consumption at 
baseline was assessed with the use of a simple qualitative food-frequency questionnaire, and 
information on mean consumption amounts was estimated indirectly on the basis of data 
from resurveys (under the assumption that there were no large changes between the baseline 
survey and the second resurvey). Fourth, we did not collect information about types of fruit 
consumed, which is likely to vary greatly according to season and region (although the most 
commonly consumed fruits in China are apples, citrus fruit, and pears). Fifth, our study was 
not exactly nationally representative, and the questionnaire used has not been validated 
against another dietary measure. Finally, and perhaps most important, fruit consumption in 
our study was closely correlated with socioeconomic status, which in turn has been closely 
Du et al.

 associated with health status and the risk of cardiovascular disease.31 Although we adjusted 
carefully for several variables related to socioeconomic status (i.e., region, educational level, 
and income) and analyses stratified according to these variables showed consistent findings, 
residual confounding by socioeconomic status is still possible.
Our study does not permit reliable inference of causality, but the observed inverse 
association between fruit consumption and cardiovascular risk could be causal,32,33 given 
that fruit is a rich source of potassium, dietary fiber, folate, antioxidants, and various 
bioactive phytochemicals, each of which has potential cardioprotective effects,34 and 
contains little sodium and fat and few calories. The association may be mediated through 
conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and overweight.35 
However, in our relatively lean study population (mean BMI, 23.5), fruit intake was 
associated with higher, instead of lower, adiposity, perhaps through improved nutrition, since 
a stronger positive association was observed among those with a lower BMI, and adjustment 
for blood pressure and blood glucose levels attenuated the association only slightly, 
suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms.36
In conclusion, our evaluation of the relationship between fresh fruit consumption and 
cardiovascular disease in China showed that the level of fruit consumption was inversely 
associated with blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Largely independent of blood 
pressure, blood glucose levels, and other dietary and nondietary factors, higher fruit 
consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of major cardiovascular events.

*Hazard ratios were adjusted for educational level, income, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, survey season, and 
consumption of dairy products, meat, and preserved vegetables and were stratified according to age at risk, sex, and region. The floating-absolute-
risk method provides the variance of the logarithm of the hazard ratio for each category (including the reference category) to facilitate comparisons 
among the different exposure categories.14
