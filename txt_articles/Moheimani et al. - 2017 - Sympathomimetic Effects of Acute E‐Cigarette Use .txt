Background-—Chronic electronic (e) cigarette users have increased resting cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and increased
susceptibility to oxidative stress. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of nicotine versus non-nicotine
constituents in e-cigarette emissions in causing these pathologies in otherwise healthy humans.
Methods and Results-—Thirty-three healthy volunteers who were not current e-cigarette or tobacco cigarette smokers were
studied. On different days, each participant used an e-cigarette with nicotine, an e-cigarette without nicotine, or a sham control.
Cardiac sympathetic nerve activity was determined by heart rate variability, and susceptibility to oxidative stress was determined
by plasma paraoxonase activity. Following exposure to the e-cigarette with nicotine, but not to the e-cigarette without nicotine or
the sham control, there was a significant and marked shift in cardiac sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance.
The decrease in high-frequency component and the increases in the low-frequency component and the low-frequency to high-
frequency ratio were significantly greater following exposure to the e-cigarette with nicotine compared with exposure to the
e-cigarette without nicotine or to sham control. Oxidative stress, as estimated by plasma paraoxonase, did not increase following
any of the 3 exposures.
Conclusions-—The acute sympathomimetic effect of e-cigarettes is attributable to the inhaled nicotine, not to non-nicotine
constituents in e-cigarette aerosol, recapitulating the same heart rate variability pattern associated with increased cardiac risk in
multiple populations with and without known cardiac disease. Evidence of oxidative stress, as estimated by plasma paraoxonase
activity, was not uncovered following acute e-cigarette exposure. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e006579. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.

T
he electronic (e) cigarette, first introduced in 2006, is
the fastest-rising tobacco product in the United States,
especially among young people.1,2 Although e-cigarettes
deliver vastly lower concentrations of carcinogens compared
with tobacco cigarette smoke,3 they typically deliver nicotine,
therefore the e-cigarette has generated significant contro-
versy within and without the medical community. E-cigarettes
have either been reviled as a new source of nicotine addiction
that may serve as a gateway for nonsmokers to become
tobacco cigarette smokers, or conversely, embraced as a
lower risk alternative to lethal tobacco cigarettes.4–6
The belief that nicotine is generally safe, as suggested in
the adage that “People smoke for the nicotine but die from
the tar,” led to the development of nicotine replacement
therapies in the 1970s.7 Nicotine, although not a carcinogen,
is a sympathomimetic drug.8 Increased cardiac sympathetic
nerve activity (SNA) is associated with increased cardiovas-
cular mortality in virtually every cardiac population studied, as
well as in populations without known cardiac disease.9–16
Cardiac SNA, as measured noninvasively by heart rate
variability (HRV), has been demonstrated to have a dose-
response relationship, with the most severe HRV abnormal-
ities conferring the greatest cardiovascular mortality.9,12
Thus, the safety of long-term inhaled nicotine delivered by
e-cigarettes is uncertain.
“Tar,” referred to above, is the combusted organic matter
in tobacco cigarette smoke that generates the particulate
matter, which includes over 7000 constituents, many of which

 are known carcinogens.17 Further, each puff of tobacco
cigarette smoke contains an abundance of reactive oxygen
species, imposing a significant oxidative stress burden.18
Oxidative stress is a key contributor to the development of
atherosclerosis.19 In contrast, constituents in e-cigarette
liquid are not combusted. Constituents include nicotine,
although this is not obligatory, as well as flavoring(s) from
over 7700 available choices, and propylene glycol and/or
vegetable glycerin, which are solvents that facilitate the
formation of a heated aerosol, exhaled as a large, smoke-like
cloud.20 When heated, the non-nicotine components in e-
cigarette liquid generate far lower levels of carcinogens, if any
at all, compared with the level of carcinogens in tobacco
cigarette
smoke.3,21,22
However,
like
tobacco
cigarette
smoke, e-cigarette aerosol has been shown to contain
particulate matter comparable in size and concentration to
the levels present in tobacco cigarette smoke.21,23 Addition-
ally, some,24,25 but not all,26 studies have found that e-
cigarette aerosol delivers reactive oxygen species and gen-
erates oxidative stress comparable to tobacco cigarette
smoke. Heavy metals, with uncertain cardiovascular toxicity,
have
also
been
detected
in
e-cigarette
aerosol, likely
originating from the device itself, and exceeding levels
detected in tobacco cigarette smoke.27 It remains unknown
whether the inhaled nicotine and/or non-nicotine con-
stituents in e-cigarette emissions are responsible for acute
physiological effects of e-cigarettes.
We have recently reported that chronic e-cigarette users
have increased resting cardiacSNAand increased susceptibility
to oxidative stress.9 The purpose of the present study of acute
e-cigarette exposure is to determine the role of nicotine versus
non-nicotine constituents present in e-cigarette emissions in
causing these pathologies. We studied healthy volunteers who
were not current e-cigarette or tobacco cigarette smokers. On
different days, each participant used an e-cigarette with
nicotine, an e-cigarette without nicotine, or a sham control, to
distinguish the role of inhaled nicotine versus non-nicotine
constituents in increasing cardiac SNA and/or oxidative stress.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This is an open-label, randomized, crossover study. In random
order, each participant underwent the following 3 exposure
sessions, each separated by a 4-week washout: (1) e-cigarette
with nicotine; (2) e-cigarette without nicotine (same flavoring
and solvent as the “with nicotine” exposure); and (3) sham
control consisting of puffing on a device without e-liquid.
Study Population
Healthy volunteers between the ages of 21 and 45 years were
eligible for enrollment in the nonuser group if they met the
following criteria: (1) no current (within 1-year) e-cigarette or
tobacco cigarette smoking; (2) nonobese (≤30 kg/m2 body
mass index); (3) no known health problems; (4) alcoholic
intake ≤2 drinks per day and no illicit drug use (determined
through screening questionnaire); and (5) not exposed to
secondhand smoke, or using licensed nicotine replacement
therapies. Participants who were former e-cigarette or
tobacco cigarette smokers were eligible for the study if they
had quit smoking >1 year before the study. The experimental
protocols were each approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of California, Los Angeles (Los
Angeles, CA) and written, informed consent was obtained
from each participant.
A total of 39 participants meeting the above criteria were
enrolled in this study. Six subjects (2 scheduling conflicts with
work, 3 personal reasons, and 1 illness) completed only 1 of
the 3 study visits, and so were eliminated, leaving 33
participants. Of these 33 participants, 29 (88%) completed all
3 sessions.
E-Cigarette Device and Topography
Fifteen subjects used the Greensmoke cigalike device (the
highest rated e-cigarette brand in the United States sold
online at the time of the study design28) with tobacco-flavored
liquid, vegetable glycerin/propylene glycol solvents, with 1.2%
nicotine and 0% nicotine (on different days) content. After
using the Greensmoke cigalike e-cigarette with 1.2% nicotine,
only 5 of 15 of the subjects had detectable nicotine and/or
cotinine in plasma, so the final 18 subjects used a more-
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The acute sympathomimetic effect of electronic cigarettes
is attributable to the inhaled nicotine, not to non-nicotine
constituents in electronic cigarette aerosol.
• Acute exposure to electronic cigarettes with nicotine
increases cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in a pattern
of heart rate variability that recapitulates the same heart
rate variability pattern associated with increased cardiac
risk in multiple populations with and without known cardiac
disease.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Although reassuring that non-nicotine constituents may not
have acute sympathomimetic effects, these findings chal-
lenge the concept that inhaled nicotine is benign and
without significant cardiac risk.

 efficient nicotine delivery system, the second-generation pen-
like device (1.0 O, eGo-One by Joyetech, Irvine, CA), with
strawberry flavoring, vegetable glycerin/propylene glycol
solvents, with 1.2% nicotine and 0% nicotine (on different
days) content.
E-cigarette topography was standardized: Participants
were verbally cued every 30 seconds with a recording:
“Ready, set” (place e-cigarette in mouth), “go, 2, 3” (inhale
3 seconds), “hold, 2, 3” (hold aerosol in), then exhale. No
plasma nicotine/cotinine was detectable in the first 6
subjects who used the cigalike device for 10 minutes, so
the acute exposure was increased to 30 minutes (60 puffs)
for the final 27 subjects.
Heart Rate Variability
To avoid the potential influence of circadian rhythm or
menstrual cycle phases on autonomic tone,29 subjects were
studied mid-day (usually between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM), and
women were studied during the early follicular phase, con-
firmed by plasma estrogen and progesterone levels. All women
had a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of the study.
ECG electrodes were placed on the chest, and the subjects
then rested, undisturbed for 10 minutes. The ECG was then
recorded for up to 10 minutes during quiet rest. Five-minute
ECG recordings were analyzed using standard commercial
software (LabChart7; ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) in the
frequency domain according to published guidelines.30 Three
main spectral components were distinguished: high frequency
(HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz), low-frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz), and
very low frequency (VLF; 0.003–0.04 Hz). HRV is presented in
normalized units in order to correct for differences in total
power between the groups.30
Blood Tests
Blood was drawn by trained University of California, Los
Angeles Clinical Translational Research Center nurses into
preiced heparinized vacutainers and placed on ice. Blood was
centrifuged to separate plasma samples, which were frozen at
�80°C in a cryopreservative solution31 for later analysis for
the following antioxidant parameters: (1) paraoxonase-1
activity, (PON-1 activity), a protective ester hydrolase enzyme
associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in blood that
prevents the formation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein,32
assayed by its ability to hydrolyze paraoxon substrate,33
described in detail below; (2) low-density lipoprotein oxidiz-
ability, indicative of susceptibility of apolipoprotein B–con-
taining lipoproteins to oxidation as previously reported34; and
(3) HDL antioxidant/anti-inflammatory capacity, expressed as
a HDL antioxidant index, which assesses the ability of HDL to
inhibit
low-density
lipoprotein
oxidation
monitored
by
conversion
of
nonfluorescent
dihydrodichlorofluorescein
probe into the fluorescent dichlorofluorescein, performed as
previously reported.33,35 Low-density lipoprotein oxidizability
and HDL antioxidant index assays were performed only in
participants who used the cigalike device.
PON-1 enzymatic activity
The enzymatic activity of human plasma PON-1 was deter-
mined by its capacity to hydrolyze paraoxon substrate to p-
nitrophenol. Assays were performed in duplicate in clear, flat-
bottomed, 96-well plates (Corning Costar), and measurements
were conducted using the BioTek Synergy (BioTek Instru-
ments, Inc, Winooski, VT) Mx microplate reader and Gen5
software. From each plasma sample, 5 lL was incubated with
paraoxon (catalog # N-12816-100MG; Chem Service Inc,
West Chester, PA) in the assay buffer (0.1 mol/L of Tris-HCl
buffer at pH 8.5, with 2 mol/L of NaCl and 2 mmol/L of
CaCl2) at room temperature. Kinetics of p-nitrophenol forma-
tion
were
immediately
measured
every
15 seconds
at
405 nm for a total of 4 minutes in the BioTek microplate
reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc). The absorbance readings
(OD/min) were converted into nanomoles p-nitrophenol/
min/mL with the use of the molar extinction coefficient for p-
nitrophenol, determined to be 16 734 M-1 cm-1 at a pH of
9.18, and a path length of 0.58 cm.
Blood was also sent to the University of California, Los
Angeles Clinical Laboratory for measurement of: (1) nicotine
(t1/2 1–2 hours) and the nicotine metabolite, cotinine (t1/2
20 hours); and (2) inflammatory markers, including C-reactive
protein and fibrinogen. The assay for plasma nicotine and
cotinine was run by the commercial laboratory, Quest
Laboratories (Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Madison, NJ),
with a limit of quantitation of 2 ng/mL for both plasma
nicotine and cotinine.
Experimental Session
After abstaining from caffeine and exercise for at least
12 hours, participants were placed in a supine position in a
quiet, temperature-controlled (21°C) room in the Human
Physiology Laboratory located in the University of California,
Los Angeles Clinical Translational Research Center. No cell
phones or digital stimuli were allowed, and during data
acquisition, talking was minimized. The participant was
instrumented, blood was drawn, and after a 10-minute rest
period, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and the
ECG was recorded for 10 minutes. The subject then under-
went the assigned exposure (e-cigarette with nicotine, e-
cigarette without nicotine, or sham control). After reposition-
ing, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and the
ECG was recorded for 10 minutes, blood was drawn, and the
study was concluded.

 Statistical Analysis
Data from cigalike and pen-like e-cigarettes were analyzed as
a single e-cigarette group, distinguished only by liquid with
and without nicotine. Mean postexposure minus baseline
differences were compared across sham control, e-cigarette
without nicotine, and e-cigarette with nicotine using a
crossover repeated-measure (mixed) ANOVA model adjusting
for session and order. The post hoc ordered trend test across
the 3 ordered groups was computed under this model. Normal
quantile plots (not shown) were examined and the Shapiro–
Wilk statistic computed to confirm that the model residual
errors followed the normal distribution. Means and standard
errors (SEM) were adjusted by session and order effects, if
any.
All data were analyzed as “intention to treat,” regardless of
whether an increase in plasma nicotine was detectable or not.
Because many of the participants did not have detectable
plasma nicotine levels after using the e-cigarette with
nicotine, a further subgroup analysis was performed to
investigate the role of nicotine on these variables (HRV,
hemodynamic, and oxidative stress markers). Thus, this group
was further subdivided into subjects with and without
detectable nicotine/cotinine plasma levels, and then variables
in these 2 subgroups were compared to variables following e-
cigarette without nicotine exposures, and sham control.
Associations
between
2
continuous
variables
were
assessed using the nonparametric Spearman correlation (rs)
because the relation was monotone, but not necessarily
linear. Differences or associations were considered statisti-
cally significant when P≤0.05.
Sample-Size Calculation
Sample size was based on end points of HRV. Because there
were no data regarding the acute effects of e-cigarettes on
HRV components, we used the reported pooled SD of acute
oral administration of nicotine (nicotine lozenge) on HRV in
healthy young nonsmokers.36 Using the reported SD of 0.3 to
2 for HF, LF, and LF to HF ratio for acute exposure to 4 mg of
oral nicotine, and assuming similar SDs with e-cigarette
exposures, we calculated that a sample size of only 8 subjects
was required for 80% power using a 2-sided alpha=0.05. Our
final analysis included 33 subjects.

Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the 33 participants are displayed in
Table 1. Fourteen of the 33 subjects participated in our
previous study.9
Nicotine delivery
In the subjects who used the cigalike device for 10 minutes
(n=6), none had an increase in plasma nicotine/cotinine. In the
subjects who used the cigalike device for 30 minutes (60 puffs),
5 of 9 (56%) had a measurable increase in plasma nicotine and/
or cotinine. The mean nicotine increase was 1.33�0.29 ng/mL
(range, 0–5). In the subjects who used the pen-like device for
30 minutes (60 puffs), 13 of 18 (72%) had a measurable
increase in plasma nicotine and/or cotinine. The mean nicotine
increase was 4.17�0.91 ng/mL (range, 0–29).
Changes in HRV Following Acute Exposures
HRV components were analyzed for the HF component, an
indicator of vagal activity, the LF component, a mixture of
both vagal and sympathetic activity, and the ratio of the LF/
HF, reflecting the cardiac sympathovagal balance (Figures 1
and 2).30 The use of an e-cigarette containing nicotine led to a

 statistically significant and striking shift in cardiac sympatho-
vagal balance toward sympathetic predominance. Specifically,
the HF component decreased, the LF component increased,
and the ratio of LF to HF increased. No changes in cardiac
sympathovagal balance were observed after the use of an e-
cigarette that did not contain nicotine or after sham puffing on
an empty e-cigarette.
When the group who used the e-cigarette with nicotine was
further subdivided into those with and without an increase in
plasma nicotine/cotinine, the shift in cardiac sympathovagal
balance toward sympathetic predominance became even
more striking and significant in the nicotine subgroup
(Figure 2). Conversely, in the subgroup without an increase
in nicotine, sympathovagal balance was not different com-
pared to the sympathovagal balance after the use of an
e-cigarette that did not contain nicotine or after sham puffing
on an empty e-cigarette (Figure 2). HRV components changed
the least following the sham control, and the most in the
subgroup in which there was a detectable increase in
nicotine/cotinine.
Changes in Hemodynamics Following Acute
Exposures
The increase in heart rate was significantly greater following
use of the e-cigarette with nicotine compared with the
e-cigarette without nicotine or sham control (Figure 1). There
was no difference in the changes in heart rate following use of
the e-cigarette without nicotine compared with the sham
control. Although the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial
blood pressures increased following use of the e-cigarette
with nicotine and decreased following use of the e-cigarette
without nicotine or the sham control, these changes did not
reach significance (Table 2).
Figure 1. Changes in HRV variables and heart rate in participants following acute exposures. Following exposure
to e-cigarettes with nicotine compared with e-cigarettes without nicotine or sham control, the sympathovagal
balance was significantly shifted to sympathetic predominance. Cardiac vagal tone, as estimated by the high-
frequency (HF) component (A), significantly decreased, and sympathetic tone as estimated by the low-frequency
(LF) component (B) and LF to HF ratio (C), significantly increased. Similarly, heart rate (D) significantly increased
following exposure to e-cigarettes with nicotine compared with e-cigarettes without nicotine or sham control. bpm

 When the group who used the e-cigarette with nicotine was
further subdivided into those with and without an increase in
nicotine/cotinine, the difference in heart rate was signifi-
cantly greater in the nicotine subgroup compared with the use
of an e-cigarette that did not contain nicotine or sham puffing
on an empty e-cigarette (Figure 2). Additionally, there was no
difference in changes in heart rate between the subgroup in
whom nicotine did not increase compared with changes after
using the e-cigarette without nicotine or the sham control
(Figure 2). Heart rate changed the least following the sham
control, and the most in the subgroup in which there was a
detectable increase in nicotine/cotinine.
Correlation of HRV and hemodynamics with acute
e-cigarette exposure
Following the use of the e-cigarette with nicotine, plasma
nicotine was significantly correlated with change in each of
the HRV components: plasma nicotine was inversely related
to the decrease in HF component (rs=�0.25; P=0.02) and
directly related to the increase in LF component (rs=0.26,
P=0.01) and the LF to HF ratio (rs=0.27; P=0.008). Similarly,
plasma nicotine was directly related to the increase in systolic
blood pressure (rs=0.21; P=0.04) and heart rate (rs=0.21;
P=0.04), but not to diastolic or mean blood pressure.
Changes in Oxidative Stress and Inflammation
Following Acute Exposures
Following use of the e-cigarette with nicotine compared with
the e-cigarette without nicotine, there were no differences in
changes in any measures of oxidative stress or inflammation
compared with sham control (Table 2). For PON-1, the cohort
of 33 participants would be sufficient to detect mean
differences equal to, or greater than 76% of the pooled SD
Figure 2. E-cigarette exposure group subdivided by plasma nicotine/cotinine levels. When the group who used
the e-cigarette with nicotine was further subdivided into those with and without an increase in plasma nicotine/

but not without, a detectable increase in plasma nicotine/cotinine, compared with e-cigarettes without nicotine or

and sympathetic tone as estimated by the low-frequency (LF) component (B) and LF to HF ratio (C), significantly
increased only in the group with—not without—detectable nicotine/cotinine compared with exposure to e-

 between the sham control and the e-cigarette with nicotine
exposures, with 80% power. The observed mean difference
between the sham control versus e-cigarette with nicotine
exposures was only 6.3%. That is, the mean difference
between exposures was only approximately one sixteenth as
large as the variation from subject to subject.
Discussion
In this study of the acute effects of use of e-cigarettes with
and without nicotine, the major findings are that only
e-cigarettes with nicotine, but not e-cigarettes without
nicotine, acutely increase cardiac SNA. Furthermore, in
contrast to past reports of acute e-cigarette exposure,37 we
found that neither e-cigarettes with nicotine nor without
nicotine had any detectable acute effect on oxidative stress
burden. These findings support the concept that the increase
in cardiac SNA is attributable to the inhaled nicotine, rather
than the non-nicotine constituents, in e-cigarette emissions.
Although it is not surprising that acute inhaled nicotine use
increases cardiac SNA, what is surprising is that acute use of
an e-cigarette without nicotine does not. When habitual
smokers smoke a tobacco cigarette, or when nonsmokers are
exposed to secondhand smoke, cardiac autonomic balance
acutely shifts toward sympathetic predominance.38 The
relative contribution of nicotine versus non-nicotine com-
busted organic constituents to this sympathetic activation is
unknown and merely speculative. Interestingly, exposure to
air pollution, which also contains combusted organic con-
stituents with many similarities to tobacco cigarette smoke,
but without the nicotine, also produces an acute increase in
cardiac SNA.39,40 Evidence from preclinical models supports
the concept that constituents and reactive oxygen species in
air pollution activate lung vagal afferent C fibers leading to a
reflex increase in cardiac SNA.41–44 Although particulate size
and number in e-cigarette emissions have considerable
overlap with air pollution and tobacco smoke, the levels of
toxicants in e-cigarette aerosol are orders of magnitude
lower.3,22,45,46 Our findings support the concept that it is the
nicotine, not the non-nicotine constituents generated from the
flavorings, solvents, and/or contaminants, that is responsible
for
the
acute
sympathetic
activation
associated
with
e-cigarette use.
Nicotine is a sympathomimetic drug that acts on nicotinic
receptors located throughout the autonomic nervous system
to increase sympathetic tone and catecholamine release.
Thus, it is not surprising that acute exposure to e-cigarettes
with nicotine increased cardiac SNA as measured by HRV.
Other,36 but not all,47 investigators have also reported an
increase in cardiac SNA with acute nicotine exposure. Sjoberg
et al36 reported that in healthy nonsmokers, a 4-mg nicotine
lozenge significantly decreased the HF component, and
increased the LF component and LF to HF ratio, consistent
with an acute increase in cardiac SNA. The acute pharmaco-
logical effect of nicotine likely explains this predictable
sympathomimetic effect. In contrast, in a double-blind,
placebo controlled, crossover study in habitual cigarette
smokers who refrained from smoking during the study, Lucini
et al47 compared cardiac SNA after 3 days of the placebo
patch versus 3 days of the nicotine patch. Cardiac SNA, as
estimated by HRV parameters, was not different on days that
the placebo patch was worn compared with the nicotine
patch. Interestingly, after tobacco cigarette smoking, cardiac
SNA was significantly increased compared with the placebo or
nicotine patch.
The increase in cardiac SNA attributable to inhaled nicotine
in e-cigarettes must not be considered benign. Other common
stimulants, such as coffee or caffeine, do not increase cardiac
SNA, and in fact may increase cardiac vagal tone, as
measured by HRV.48–51 In virtually every population studied,
including patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease,
cardiomyopathy, congenital or acquired arrhythmias, diabetes
mellitus, or even large unselected populations without known
cardiac disease, increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity

Sympathomimetic Effects of Acute E-Cigarette Use

 confers increased cardiovascular risk.10–15 Nicotine replace-
ment therapies and smokeless tobacco, such as snus, are
thought to be safer than tobacco cigarettes from the cardiac
standpoint, given that they do not contain the combusted
toxicants.52,53 However, large, randomized studies of long-
term nicotine replacement therapy for safety end points are
lacking.54 A recent observational study in almost 2500 snus
users who had suffered a myocardial infarction found that
cessation of snus compared with continued snus use
following hospital discharge was associated with a decrease
in mortality by 50%—on par with benefits associated with
smoking cessation following myocardial infarction.55 It is
possible
that
the
increased
cardiac
SNA
induced
by
e-cigarettes may, in fact, be harmful.
Carnevale
et al37
reported
that
brief
exposure
to
e-cigarettes
(unspecified device
type)
in
nonusers
and
tobacco cigarette smokers produced findings, by many
measures, consistent with increased oxidative stress. In
contrast, increased oxidative stress, as estimated by PON-1,
was not detected following the acute exposures in the present
study. In the present study, the acute exposure protocol was
over 6-fold as intense as the one by Carnevale et al (9 versus
60 puffs), so a lesser exposure to e-cigarette aerosol does not
explain our disparate findings. In the present study compared
with the Carnevale et al study, different indicators of oxidative
stress were measured, which may explain the differing results.
PON-1 was measured in the present study because it is a
biologically relevant biomarker that has been correlated with
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, PON-1
activity is known to be reduced in tobacco cigarette
smokers.33,56–58 In both the Carnevale et al study and the
present study, oxidative stress markers were only measured
at 1 time point (within 30 minutes of acute exposure) after
the acute exposure, but perhaps additional time points would
have provided additional information. Whether e-cigarettes
acutely generate acute oxidative stress in humans, and if so,
whether it is the nicotine, or non-nicotinic, constituents that
underlie this pathology, remains an open question, and further
studies are needed.
We recently reported that habitual e-cigarette users, even
in the absence of acute nicotine exposure, had increased
cardiac SNA and susceptibility to oxidative stress.9 The
current study adds to these observations by confirming that
the nicotine, not non-nicotine constituents, underlies this
increase in cardiac SNA. We speculate that acute increases in
cardiac SNA, mediated by acute nicotine exposure, may then
set in motion a cascade of effects. As described in preclinical
studies, increased cardiac SNA increases oxidative stress,
which, in turn, increases SNA, and these become mutually
reinforcing processes.41–43 Similarly, Stein et al59 reported
that transdermal nicotine patches used in tobacco cigarette
smokers who desired to quit were associated with an
intermediate level of cardiac SNA, lower than precessation
levels, but remaining higher than levels of cardiac SNA once
all nicotine products had been discontinued. Interestingly,
following 4 weeks’ cessation of all nicotine products, cardiac
SNA still remained elevated compared with nonuser controls,
consistent with ongoing nonpharmacological sympathoexci-
tatory effect.
Limitations
The plasma levels of nicotine were quite low in this study—
likely lower than are observed in a habitual nicotine user
during “steady state.” Nonetheless, despite these low levels,
significant increases in cardiac SNA were detected. In future
studies, it would be interesting to generate an e-cigarette
dose-response (cardiac SNA) curve. The hemodynamic effects
of nicotine saturate at relative low levels of nicotine.60 It
would be interesting to determine whether the acute increase
in cardiac SNA during exposure to e-cigarettes with nicotine
also saturates at relatively low nicotine levels. This has clinical
relevance, given that it has been shown that the cardiac
mortality associated with tobacco cigarette smoking is
nonlinear.46 In fact, it is almost binary, with 1 to 3 cigarettes
per day conferring almost as great a cardiac risk as 20
cigarettes per day.46
We have reported that habitual e-cigarette users have
increased cardiac SNA even in the absence of acute e-
cigarette use.9 It is quite possible that e-cigarettes may not
have an acute effect on HRV in habitual e-cigarette users,
given that their SNA is already increased. In the present study,
we enrolled only nonusers, but it would be of interest to
repeat this acute exposure study in habitual e-cigarette users.
We only tested 1 flavor, strawberry, but there are an
estimated 7700 e-cigarette flavors available.20 It is unknown,
but conceivable, that 1 or more of these flavors could, in fact,
generate constituents that have sympathomimetic effects.
The markers of cardiac risk and oxidative stress measured
in this study are biologically relevant and important, but not
exhaustive. Although we did not uncover a change in PON-1
activity, this does not mean that there was no change in
oxidative stress. Because of the large interindividual variations
in PON-1 activity, our study was only powered to detect
differences of ≥76% between exposures, and smaller differ-
ences, if present, cannot be confirmed. Clearly, further studies
investigating
additional
cardiac
risk
markers,
such
as
endothelial function using brachial artery flow-mediated
dilatation and additional markers of oxidative stress, and
with even larger sample sizes, are warranted.
In conclusion, the acute sympathomimetic effect of e-
cigarettes is attributable to the inhaled nicotine, not to non-
nicotine constituents in e-cigarette aerosol. Although we did
not uncover evidence of oxidative stress following acute e-

 cigarette exposure, further studies are necessary to exclude
this possibility. Although reassuring that non-nicotine con-
stituents may not have acute sympathomimetic effects, these
findings challenge the concept that inhaled nicotine is benign,
without significant cardiac risk.10 Acute exposure to e-
cigarettes with nicotine increases cardiac SNA in a pattern
of HRV that recapitulates the same HRV pattern associated
with increased cardiac risk in multiple populations with and
without known cardiac disease.
