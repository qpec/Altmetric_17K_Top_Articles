BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate to provide annual updates
on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. METHODS: Incidence data were obtained from the CDC-funded and NCI-
funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the
National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all can-
cers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicity were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the
annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rec-
tum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. RESULTS: Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to
2014 decreased by 2.2% per year among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015
decreased by 1.8% per year among men and by 1.4% per year among women. Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-
year period (2010-2014) decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015) decreased for 11 of the 18
most common types. Among women, incidence rates declined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14
of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, including lung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal
(men and women), female breast, and prostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women); pancreas (men and
women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oral cavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men
only); nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higher among men than among women for all racial
and ethnic groups. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared with other
racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men
and women had higher incidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-year survival for cases diagnosed from
2007 through 2013 ranged from 100% (stage I) to 26.5% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1% (stage I) to 12.6% (stage IV)
for colorectal cancer, from 55.1% (stage I) to 4.2% (stage IV) for lung and bronchus cancer, and from 99.5% (stage I) to 16% (stage IV)
for melanoma of the skin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8% per year from 2010 to 2014, and overall
cancer death rates decreased by 1.5% per year from 2011 to 2015. CONCLUSIONS: For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence
rates decreased among men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates
among both men and women. Differences in rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality
has not occurred for all sites. Examining stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage highlights the potential benefits associated
with early detection and treatment. Cancer 2018;124:2785-800. V

 INTRODUCTION
The American Cancer Society (ACS), Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Insti-
tute (NCI), and North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries (NAACCR) have collaborated annually
since 1998 to provide updates on cancer incidence and
mortality patterns in the United States.1-19 This report
uses a single database to estimate delay-adjusted incidence
to monitor population-based cancer trends. In addition to
reporting on incidence and mortality trends overall and
for common cancer sites, this year’s report highlights 4
cancer sites (female breast, colon and rectum [colorectal],
lung and bronchus, and melanoma of the skin) by pre-
senting the percentage of cases by stage at diagnosis and 5-
year survival estimates by stage at diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Cancer incidence data
Population-based cancer incidence data by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity were obtained from 42 state registries that
participate in the CDC’s National Program of Cancer
Registries (NPCR) and/or the NCI’s Surveillance, Epi-
demiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The data
satisfied the NAACCR’s data quality criteria and repre-
sented cases diagnosed from 1999 through 2014,20 cover-
ing 89% of the US population. Information on incident
cases came primarily from the abstracts of inpatient and
outpatient medical records but also from a variety of other
sources, including pathology reports and death certifi-
cates. This database of 42 registries was used to derive all
incidence statistics presented in this report.
Anatomic site and histology were coded according
to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncol-
ogy (ICD-O) edition in use at the time of diagnosis and
were converted to the third edition (ICD-O-3) coding21
and categorized according to SEER site groups.22 Only
cases defined as malignant under ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3
were included in this report, with the exception of bladder
cancer. In situ and malignant cancers were combined
when reporting bladder cancer incidence rates. All case
counts and rates were adjusted for delay in reporting.23
After adjusting for reporting delay, the 5-year fixed inter-
val incidence rates are based on 3.6 million male cases and
3.5 million female cases diagnosed between 2010 and
2014.
Cancer mortality data
Although cancer incidence data were available through
2014, an additional year of data was available for analysis
of mortality. Cause of death by age, sex, and race/ethnicity
(1999-2015) came from the National Vital Statistics Sys-
tem and was based on death certificate information
reported to state vital statistics offices and compiled into a
national file covering all states in the United States by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).24 Catego-
rization methods for cause of death have been described in
previous reports.19
Race/ethnicity data
In this report, information on race and ethnicity was
based on medical records for incidence or death certifi-
cates from the NCHS for mortality. Race was categorized
as white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and Ameri-
can Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). Race information for
AI/AN, however, was considered reliable only for geo-
graphic areas covered by the Indian Health Service Con-
tract Health Service Delivery Areas (CHSDA)10,25,26;
therefore, incidence and mortality data for AI/AN were
based only on these areas. Overall, 83% of the AI/AN
population lived in CHSDA areas between the years 2010
and 2014. This percentage varied by geographic area,
with 100% or close to 100% of the AI/AN population liv-
ing in CHSDA areas in Alaska, the Pacific Coast, the
Southern Plains, and the East; 67% living in the Northern
Plains; and 60% living in the Southwest. Hispanic ethnic-
ity included individuals from all races identified as His-
panic. Although the accuracy of race and ethnicity
reporting has improved over time, recent studies have
demonstrated that reporting of race in medical records
remains less accurate for API, Hispanic, and AIs/ANs
than for whites and blacks.27,28 We present incidence and
mortality data separately by race and by Hispanic ethnic-
ity. The number of cases included in the 5-year incidence
rate calculation ranged from 12,000 male and 13,500
female AIs/ANs residing in CHSDA areas to almost 3
million white men and women.
Population data
The population estimates used as the denominators to cal-
culate incidence and death rates were a modification of
the intercensal and Vintage 2015 annual times series of
July 1, county population estimates by age, sex, race, and
Hispanic origin produced by the US Census Bureau’s
Population Estimates Program in collaboration with the
NCHS and with support from the NCI.29 The estimates
incorporate intercensal (for July 1, 2000-2009) and Vin-
tage 2015 (for July 1, 2010-2015) bridged, single-race
estimates that are derived from the original multiple-race
categories in the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, as specified in

 the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for
the collection of data on race and ethnicity.30,31 Some
additional adjustments were made to refine the July 1
population estimates, as with previous reports.19
Survival data
Estimates for 5-year relative survival were calculated for
cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013. We used 34
central cancer registries (33 states and 1 metropolitan
area, referenced hereafter as states) compiled by the
NAACCR (covering 70% of the US population) to
examine survival differences by sex and cancer stage at
diagnosis for cancers of the lung and bronchus, breast,
colon and rectum, and melanoma of the skin.32 These
34 states were considered to have sufficient vital status
follow-up to conduct survival analyses, because they
either conducted recent National Death Index linkages
or they routinely conduct active vital status follow-up of
all cases.33 Cancers that were identified by death certifi-
cate or autopsy only were excluded from the survival
analysis, as were patients who died so soon after diagno-
sis that their survival time was not measurable. The first
site-specific cancer of the analysis period (2007-2013)
was used in the analysis. Patients were followed for vital
status through December 31, 2013, because not all regis-
tries had complete information on vital status through
December 31, 2014.
Statistical Methods
Cancer incidence and death rates and trends
Cross-sectional incidence (2010-2014) and death (2011-
2015) rates for all ages combined were calculated for all
cancer sites combined and for the most common cancer
sites by sex, race, and ethnicity. These rates were calcu-
lated with their 95% confidence intervals using SEER*-
Stat software, version 8.3.4.34,35 Incidence rates were
adjusted for delay in reporting.36 Similarly, we calculated
overall cancer incidence and death rates for children (ages
0-14 years). All rates were age-standardized to the 2000
US standard population and were expressed per 100,000
persons.34 Rates based on fewer than 16 cases were
deemed to be statistically unstable and were suppressed.
Temporal trends in age-standardized, delay-adjusted
cancer incidence (1999-2014) and death (1999-2015)
rates were estimated using joinpoint regression,37,38 with
a maximum of 2 joinpoints (3 line segments) allowed in
each model for incidence and 3 joinpoints (4 line seg-
ments) allowed in each model for mortality. The maxi-
mum number of joinpoints is based on the number of
data points in the series.39 The resultant trends were
described by the annual percent change (APC). The 5-
year average APCs (AAPCs) for 2010 through 2014 (inci-
dence) and for 2011 through 2015 (mortality) were calcu-
lated using a weighted average of the slope coefficients of
the underlying joinpoint regression line, with the weights
equal to the length of each segment over the interval. The
AAPC was equal to the APC when the AAPC was entirely
within the last joinpoint segment.40 Two-sided statistical
significance (P < .05) for the APC and the AAPC was
determined using a t test for the APC and for the AAPC
when it lay entirely within the last joinpoint segment; and
a Z test was used when the AAPC extended beyond the
last joinpoint segment.39
In describing trends, the terms increase and decrease
are used when the slope of the trend (APC or AAPC) was
statistically significant; otherwise, the term stable is used.
Trends based on fewer than 10 cases in any of the data
years (1999-2014 for incidence and 1999-2015 for mor-
tality) were considered statistically unstable and were
suppressed.
RESULTS
Cancer Incidence Rates for All Sites Combined
and for the Most Common Cancers
Figure 1 illustrates trends from 1999 to 2014 in age-
standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all cancer
sites combined among men and among women. Incidence
rates among men decreased throughout the study period,
with the decrease accelerating from 0.6% (on average) per
year during 1999 to 2008 to 2.2% (on average) per year
during 2008 to 2014. In contrast, over the same 15-year
period, incidence rates among women were stable.
Figure 2 presents average annual incidence rates and
5-year AAPCs (2010-2014) for the 17 most common can-
cers among men and the 18 most common cancers among
women. Among men, incidence rates decreased for 7 of
the 17 most common cancers: prostate (5-year AAPC,
27.6%), lung and bronchus (22.4%), colon and rec-
tum (colorectal) (21.9%), urinary bladder (bladder)
(20.8%), esophagus (21.6%), brain and other nervous
system (20.2%), and larynx (22.3%) (Table 1 and Fig.
2). In contrast, incidence rates among men increased for
8 cancers: melanoma of the skin (5-year AAPC, 2.3%),
kidney and renal pelvis (kidney) (1.1%), leukemia
(1.6%), oral cavity and pharynx (1.3%), pancreas (1.0%),
liver and intrahepatic bile duct (liver) (2.8%), myeloma
(2.5%), and thyroid (2.4%). Incidence rates were stable
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and stomach cancer.
Among women, incidence rates decreased for 7 of
the 18 most common cancers: lung and bronchus (5-year

 AAPC, 21.2%), colorectal (21.7%), NHL (20.4%),
ovary (21.6%), bladder (20.8%), cervix uteri (cervix)
(21.0%), and brain and other nervous system (20.7%).
However, incidence rates increased for 10 cancers: breast
(0.4%), corpus and uterus not otherwise specified (uterus)
(1.2%), thyroid (1.9%), melanoma of the skin (1.2%),
leukemia (1.4%), kidney (0.4%), pancreas (1.1%), oral
cavity and pharynx (0.8%), myeloma (1.6%), and liver
(3.8%). Incidence rates remained unchanged for stomach
cancer (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Liver cancer replaced thyroid
cancer as the most rapidly increasing incident cancer
among women. For most cancer sites, the increasing or
decreasing trends from 2010 to 2014 among men and
among women were continuations of past trends (Sup-
porting Table 1).
At the end of this Results section, incidence and
mortality trends for female breast cancer, colorectal can-
cer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the
skin are discussed in greater detail—along with stage at
diagnosis and survival by stage. Prostate cancer inci-
dence and mortality are examined in detail in Part II of
this report.
Cancer Death Rates for All Sites Combined
and for the Most Common Cancers
Figure 1 illustrates trends in death rates from 1999 to
2015 for all cancer sites combined, by sex. Death rates
decreased during this period by 1.8% on average per year
among men and by 1.4% on average per year among
women.
Figure 3 presents average annual death rates and 5-
year AAPCs (2011-2015) for the 18 most common can-
cers among men and the 20 most common cancers among
women. Among men, death rates during this period
decreased for 11 of the 18 cancers: lung and bronchus (5-
year AAPC, 23.8%), prostate (22.2%), colorectal
(22.5%), leukemia (22.2%), NHL (22.0%), esophagus
(21.1%), kidney (20.5%), stomach (21.6%), myeloma
(20.9%), melanoma of the skin (23.0%), and larynx
(22.5%). In contrast, death rates among men increased
for cancers of the pancreas (0.2%), liver (1.6%), brain and
other nervous system (0.5%), oral cavity and pharynx
(1.0%), nonmelanoma skin (2.8%), and soft tissue
(including heart) (0.8%). The death rate among men was
stable for bladder cancer (Fig. 3 and Table 2).
Figure 1. Trends in age-standardized incidence (1999-2014) and mortality rates (1999-2015) are illustrated for all cancer sites
combined, all races/ethnicities combined, and by sex. An asterisk indicates that the annual percent change (APC) or the average
APC (AAPC) is statistically significantly different from zero (2-sided t test; P <.05). UNK indicates unknown. Rates were age-
standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Bureau of the Census. Current Population Reports, Publication
25-1130. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office; 2000 [Census 25-1130]). Scattered points indicate observed rates, and
lines are fitted rates according to joinpoint regression. Incidence rates were delay-adjusted and covered 89% of the US popula-
tion, and mortality covered the entire United States. The following registries were included for incidence: Alabama, Alaska, Ari-
zona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The AAPC is a weighted average of the APCs over the fixed interval (2010-2014 for inci-
dence; 2011-2015 for mortality) using the underlying Joinpoint model for the period from 1999 to 2014 for incidence and the
period from 1999 to 2015 for mortality. Joinpoint models with up to 2 joinpoints for incidence and up to 3 joinpoints for mortality
are based on rates per 100,000 persons age standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census P25-
1130). For joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program was used (version 4.5.01; Bethesda, MD: Statistical Research and
Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute; June 2017).

 Among women, during the same time period, death
rates decreased for 14 of the 20 most common cancer
types: lung and bronchus (5-year AAPC, 22.4%), breast
(21.6%), colorectal (22.7%), ovary (22.3%), leukemia
(22.3%), NHL (22.7%), kidney (21.4%), stomach
(21.8%), cervix (20.7%), bladder (20.5%), melanoma
of the skin (22.6%), esophagus (21.6%), oral cavity and
pharynx (21.3%), and gallbladder (21.3%) (Fig. 3 and
Table 2). In contrast, death rates among women increased
for cancers of the pancreas (0.2%), uterus (1.9%), liver
(2.7%), and brain and other nervous system (0.5%).
Death rates among women were stable for myeloma and
soft tissue (including heart). Like the incidence trends,
increases or decreases in death rates for most cancers
among men and women were continuations of past trends
(Supporting Table 2).
Current Cancer Incidence Rates and Trends
by Sex, Race, and Ethnicity
Table 1 lists average annual age-standardized, delay-
adjusted incidence rates and trends for the most recent 5-
year period (2010-2014) by cancer site, sex, race, and eth-
nicity. For all cancer sites combined, rates were higher
among men than among women overall (all races/ethnici-
ties combined; 502.0 vs 420.6 per 100,000 persons) and
among persons in every racial/ethnic group. Black men
and white women had higher overall cancer incidence
rates than other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and
women had higher incidence rates than those of Hispanic
ethnicity. API men and API women had the lowest rates
relative to other racial and ethnic groups. In every racial
and ethnic group, prostate cancer among men and breast
cancer among women were the most frequent incident
cancers, followed by lung and bronchus cancer, and colo-
rectal cancer, except among Hispanics. Among Hispanic
men and Hispanic women, colorectal cancer was more
frequent than lung and bronchus cancer. Rankings for
several other cancers varied substantially by race and eth-
nicity among both men and women. Among men, for
example, melanoma of the skin ranked fifth in whites and
19th in blacks; and liver cancer ranked 11th in whites,
sixth in blacks, and fourth in APIs.
Among men in each racial/ethnic group, incidence
trends during 2010 to 2014 for all cancer sites combined
and for each of the 17 most common cancers were gener-
ally similar in direction (decrease or increase) to those for
all races/ethnicities combined (Table 1). Incidence rates
among men in each racial and ethnic group decreased for
all cancers combined and for each of the 3 most common
cancers (prostate, lung and bronchus, colorectal), except
that the rate was stable for lung and bronchus cancer
among AIs/ANs. Rates also decreased among men in each
racial/ethnic group for cancers of the bladder, stomach,
Figure 2. Age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates
and recent trends (2010-2014) are illustrated for the 17 most
common cancers in men and the 18 most common cancers in
women for all races/ethnicities combined and by sex. The 5-
year average annual percent change (AAPC) is based on the
joinpoint trend from 1999 to 2014. An asterisk indicates that
the AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (2-
sided t test or Z test; P <.05). Rates were age-standardized to
the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census P25-
1130), were delay-adjusted, and covered 89% of the US popula-
tion. The following registries were included in the analyses: Ala-

Arkansas,
California,
Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,

New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Caro-
lina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wiscon-
sin, and Wyoming. The AAPC is a weighted average of the
annual percent changes (APCs) over the fixed interval (2010-
2014) using the underlying joinpoint model for the period from
1999 to 2014. Joinpoint models with up to 2 joinpoints are
based on rates per 100,000 persons age standardized to the
2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census P25-
1130). For joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program
was used (version 4.5.0.1; Bethesda, MD: Statistical Research
and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute; June 2017).

a Source: National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results areas reported by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries as meeting high-quality inci-
dence data standards for the specified time periods.
b The following registries were included in the incidence rates (2010-2014) and Joinpoint models (1999-2014) for all races/ethnicities, white, black, AI/AN, API, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic (42 states): Alabama,
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Mon-
tana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
c White, black, API, and AI/AN (CHSDA 2012 counties) include Hispanic and non-Hispanic; the race and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. AI/AN (CHSDA 2012) statistics exclude data from Kansas.
d Cancers are sorted in descending order according to sex-specific rates for all races/ethnicities. More than 15 cancers may appear under males and females to include the top 15 cancers in every race/ethnicity
group.
e Rates are per 100,000 persons and were age standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; US Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Publication 25-1130. Washington, DC:
US Government Printing Office; 2000 [Census P25-1130]).
f The AAPC is the average APC and is a weighted average of the APCs over the fixed interval from 2010 to 2014 using the underlying Joinpoint model for the period from 1999 to 2014. Joinpoint models with up
to 2 joinpoints are based on rates per 100,000 persons and age standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census P25-1130). For joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program
was used (version 4.5.0.1; Bethesda, MD: Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute; June 2017).
g For all sites, myelodysplastic syndromes are included for the rate calculations but not for the APC calculations; they are excluded from cancer-specific analysis. Ovary excludes borderline tumors.
h The AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (two-sided P <
.05).

among AIs/ANs, were stable for stomach cancer among

Figure 3. Age-standardized death rates and recent fixed-
interval trends (2011-2015) are illustrated for the 18 most
common cancers in men and the 20 most common cancers
in women, for all races/ethnicities combined, and by sex. The
5-year average annual percent change (AAPC) is based on
the joinpoint trend from 1999 to 2015. An asterisk indicates
that the AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero
(2-sided
t
test
or
Z
test;
P <.05).
Rates
were
age-
standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age
groups; Bureau of the Census. Current Population Reports,
Publication 25-1130. Washington, DC: US Government Printing
Office; 2000 [Census P25-1130]). The AAPC is a weighted
average of the annual percent changes over the fixed interval
(2011-2015) using the underlying joinpoint model for the
period from 1999 to 2015. Joinpoint models with up to 3 join-
points are based on rates per 100,000 persons age standard-
ized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups;
Census
P25-1130).
For
joinpoint
analysis,
the
Joinpoint
Regression Program was used (version 4.5.0.1; Bethesda, MD:
Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer
Institute; June 2017).

b White, black, API, and AI/AN (CHSDA 2012 counties) include Hispanic and non-Hispanic; the race and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive.
c Cancers are sorted in descending order according to sex-specific rates for all races/ethnicities. More than 15 cancers may appear under males and females to include the top 15 cancers in every race/ethnicity
group.
d Rates are per 100,000 persons and are age standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups: ages < 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, . . ., 80-84 years, � 85 years; US Bureau of the Census. Current
Population Reports, Publication 25-1130. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office; 2000 [Census P25-1130]).
e The AAPC is the average APC and is a weighted average of the APCs over the fixed interval from 2011 to 2015 using the underlying Joinpoint model for the period from 1999 to 2015. Joinpoint models with up
to 3 joinpoints are based on rates per 100,000 persons and are age standardized to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census P25-1130). For joinpoint analyses, the Joinpoint Regression Program
was used (version 4.5.0.1; Bethesda, MD; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute; June 2017).
f The APC is statistically significantly different from zero (1-sided P <
.05).
g The statistic could not be calculated. The APC change is based on <10 cases for at least 1 year within the time interval.

 cancer among blacks. Incidence rates among men
increased in each racial and ethnic group for leukemia,
myeloma, and cancers of the kidney, thyroid, pancreas,
and liver, except that rates were stable for kidney and liver
cancers among Hispanics and for leukemia, myeloma,
and pancreas cancer among AIs/ANs.
Among women, overall cancer incidence rates inc-
reased during 2010 to 2014 among blacks, APIs, and AIs/
ANs but remained stable in whites, Hispanics, and non-
Hispanics. Incidence rates increased for female breast can-
cer in each racial and ethnic group (Table 1). Incidence
rates among women also increased for cancers of the thy-
roid, liver, and uterus in each racial and ethnic group,
except that rates remained stable for thyroid cancer and
liver cancer among APIs. Incidence rates among women
decreased for lung and bronchus cancer and colorectal
cancer in each racial and ethnic group, except that rates
were stable for lung and bronchus cancer among APIs and
for colorectal cancer among Hispanics. As with men, for
most cancer sites incidence trends for women in each
racial and ethnic group were similar in direction to those
for all women combined.
Current Cancer Death Rates and Trends by Sex,
Race, and Ethnicity
Average annual death rates and trends from 2011 to 2015
are presented by cancer site, sex, race, and ethnicity in
Table 2. For all cancer sites combined, similar to inci-
dence rates, death rates (per 100,000 persons) were higher
among men than among women overall (196.7 vs 139.5
for all races/ethnicities combined) and in every racial and
ethnic group. Black men and black women had the high-
est cancer death rates of any racial group for all cancer sites
combined, for 8 of the most common cancers in men, and
for 9 of the most common cancers in women. Non-
Hispanic men and women had higher overall cancer death
rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Among men, lung
and bronchus cancer was the leading cause of cancer death
in every racial and ethnic group, followed by prostate and
colorectal cancer in black, white, and Hispanic men; liver
and colorectal cancer in API men; and colorectal and
prostate cancer in AI/AN men. Among women, lung and
bronchus, breast, and colorectal cancers were the leading
causes of cancer death in every racial and ethnic group
except Hispanics, in whom breast cancer replaced lung
and bronchus cancer as the leading cause.
During 2011 to 2015, death rates declined overall
and for the most common cancers (lung and bronchus,
prostate, colorectal, breast) among men and women in all
racial and ethnic groups, except that breast cancer death
rates were stable among API and AI/AN women, colorec-
tal cancer death rates were stable among AI/AN men and
women, and prostate cancer death rates were stable among
AI/AN men (Table 2). Death rates for most of the other
cancer sites declined or were stable among men and
women in each racial and ethnic group. However, death
rates increased for some cancers in some racial and ethnic
groups: liver cancer in white men and women, black
women, AI/AN men, Hispanic women, and non-
Hispanic men and women; pancreas cancer in white men
and women and non-Hispanic men and women; uterus
cancer in white, black, API, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic
women; brain cancer in white men and women, non-
Hispanic men and women, and API women; oral cavity
and pharynx cancer in white men and non-Hispanic men;
nonmelanoma skin cancer in white men and non-
Hispanic men; and soft tissue (including heart) cancer in
white men and non-Hispanic men and women.
Incidence and Mortality Trends, Survival by
Stage, and Stage at Diagnosis for Female
Breast Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Lung and
Bronchus Cancer, and Melanoma of the Skin
Figure 4 illustrates delay-adjusted incidence (1999-2014)
and mortality (1999-2015) trends, 5-year survival esti-
mates by stage (2007-2013), and the stage distribution at
diagnosis for female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung
and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. We focus
on these 4 cancer sites because they are among the 5 sites
that have the highest number of expected cases in 2017.41
In addition to these 4 cancer sites, prostate cancer is
among the top 5 sites based on the number of expected
cases, but we do not include prostate cancer here because
it is examined in detail in Part II of this report.
Female breast cancer incidence had been declining
before 2004 but has increased since then at an average rate
of 0.4% per year (Supporting Table 1). Female breast can-
cer mortality decreased during 1999 to 2015 (Supporting
Table 2). Seventy-eight percent of cases were diagnosed at
stage I or II, for which 5-year survival was high (100%
and 92%, respectively) (Fig. 4). Approximately 6% of
cases were diagnosed at stage IV, for which 5-year survival
was 26.5%.
Colorectal cancer incidence rates decreased during
1999 to 2012 among men and women, although rates
have been stable since 2012 (Supporting Table 1). Colo-
rectal cancer mortality decreased during 1999 to 2015

 cases) to 12.6% for cases diagnosed at stage IV (20% of
cases) (Fig. 4).
Lung and bronchus cancer incidence and mortality
rates remain higher among men than among women, but
men have experienced a longer and more pronounced
decrease in both rates over time (Fig. 4, Supporting Tables
1 and 2). Among women, lung and bronchus cancer inci-
dence decreased during 2006 to 2014, and lung and bron-
chus cancer mortality decreased during 2002 to 2015
(Supporting Tables 1 and 2). Lung and bronchus cancer
survival (men and women combined) was low, ranging
from 55.1% for stage I (21% of cases) to 4.2% for cases
diagnosed at stage IV (44% of cases) (Fig. 4).
The incidence of melanoma of the skin increased
substantially
since
1999
among
men
and
among
women, although the rates of increase among women
began slowing in 2005 (Fig. 4 and Supporting Table
1). Melanoma mortality was stable during 1999 to
2015 in women; in men, it was stable during 2009 to
2013 and decreased during 2013 to 2015 (Supporting
Table 2). Sixty-two percent of cases were diagnosed
with stage I disease and 12% were diagnosed with stage
II disease, for which the 5-year survival rates were
99.5% and 75%, respectively. Four percent were diag-
nosed at stage IV, for which the 5-year survival rate was
16% (Fig. 4).

 Cancer Incidence and Mortality Among Children
The most common cancer sites for children vary by age.
Overall, the most common sites are leukemia, brain and
other nervous system, soft tissue, NHL, and kidney and
renal pelvis. Bone and joint cancer and Hodgkin lym-
phoma are more common in older children. Among chil-
dren ages birth to 14 years, the average annual, age-
standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates (all cancer
types combined; per 100,000 persons) during 2010 to
2014 ranged from 12.6 among AIs/ANs to 17.3 among
whites (both sexes combined) (Table 3). The average,
annual age-standardized death rates during 2011 to 2015
ranged from 1.7 among APIs to 2.2 among whites. Inci-
dence rates increased during 2010 to 2014 for all racial/
ethnic groups combined (0.8% per year) and among chil-
dren in 4 racial/ethnic groups (APIs, 1.1% per year; non-
Hispanics, 1.0% per year; whites, 0.7% per year; and His-
panics, 0.4% per year). Among AI/AN and black chil-
dren, incidence rates were stable. In contrast, death rates
among children during 2011 to 2015 decreased overall
(21.5% per year; all races/ethnicities combined) and
among children in every racial and ethnic group, except
that the AAPC for AIs/ANs could not be calculated
because of sparse data (Table 3). The greatest decrease in
cancer mortality was observed among API children
(22.4%), and the smallest decreases were among white
children and non-Hispanic children (21.4% in each
group).
DISCUSSION
Cancer incidence rates for all races/ethnicities combined
continued to decline among men and were stable among
women. Incidence rates from 2010 to 2014 decreased for
7 of the 17 most common cancers among men and for 7
of the 18 most common cancers among women, and rates
increased for 8 cancer sites among men and 10 sites
among women.
The largest increases in incidence rates were ob-
served for liver cancer, myeloma, melanoma of the skin,
thyroid cancer, and leukemia. Additional cancers with ris-
ing incidence trends during the most recent years include
kidney and female breast. The increase in thyroid cancer
incidence rates is largely thought to be caused by increased
detection of small and indolent tumors through imag-
ing42,43; however, the rates increased for both small and
large tumors, suggesting a role for unidentified risk factors

 in the rising trend.44,45 It is believed that the increase in
kidney cancer incidence rates in part reflects increased
detection resulting from wider application of imaging
techniques46 as well as the obesity epidemic.14 For all can-
cer sites combined, men had higher incidence rates than
women within every racial and ethnic group. Overall,
black men and white women had higher rates than other
racial groups, and non-Hispanic men and women had
higher rates than Hispanic individuals. These racial and
ethnic differences were driven largely by the incidence of
prostate cancer, female breast cancer, and lung cancer.
The increase in the breast cancer incidence rate con-
tinues the 0.4% increase observed in last year’s report.19
After decreasing in the early 2000s after cessation of
hormone-replacement therapy,47,48 the increase from
2004 to 2014 may in part reflect the obesity epidemic.17
Increased detection through mammography is unlikely to
have contributed to the recent trend, because mammogra-
phy rates remained unchanged during the corresponding
period.49 The continued increase in melanoma incidence
rates is thought to reflect increased harmful recreational
sun exposure and tanning bed use, as well as increased
detection.50 The survival rates for early stage breast cancer
and melanoma of the skin are extremely high (100% and
99.5% for stage I breast cancer and melanoma, respec-
tively), suggesting the influence of screening on survival.
These high survival rates may result from a combination
of better prognosis because of early detection, some level
of overdiagnosis associated with screening, and individu-
als with screen-detected disease being healthier than the
general population.51
Overall cancer death rates have continued to dec-
rease among both men and women for all major racial and
ethnic groups, with the greatest decrease among black
men and the smallest among AI/AN men. From 2011 to
2015, death rates for all races/ethnicities combined
decreased for 11 of the 18 most common cancers among
men and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among
women, including lung and bronchus (men and women),
colorectal (men and women), female breast, and prostate.
In contrast, cancer death rates increased for liver, pan-
creas, and brain and other nervous system among men
and women; for oral cavity and pharynx, nonmelanoma
skin, and soft tissue (including heart) among men; and for
uterus among women. Black men and black women had
the highest cancer death rates of any racial group during
the most recent 5-year period. Except for female lung can-
cer, black men and black women had the highest death
rates for cancer sites with the highest mortality in the over-
all population: lung, prostate, female breast, colorectal,
and pancreas. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher
overall cancer death rates than men and women of His-
panic ethnicity.
Factors that have contributed to the continued
decreases in cancer death rates for the 4 most common
cancers have been discussed in previous reports.14-19
Briefly, the sustained decrease in lung and bronchus can-
cer death rates since the early 1990s among men and since
the early 2000s among women has been attributed to the
reduction in cigarette smoking over the past 5 decades.11
Between 1964 and 2012, cigarette smoking decreased by
about 50% because of public health policies against
tobacco use (eg, increased excise taxes on cigarette smok-
ing, smoke-free air laws) and increased awareness about
the health hazards of smoking.52 However, cigarette
smoking still accounts for over one-quarter of cancer
deaths in the United States.53-55
The continued decreases in death rates for female
breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer largely
reflect improved early detection and more effective treat-
ments.14-19 Because mammography use has been stable
since the early 2000s,48 the recent decrease in breast cancer
death rates may largely reflect improvement in treatments,
such as targeted therapies.56 The use of prostate-specific
antigen testing has substantially decreased following the
US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations
against routine testing for men aged 75 and older in 2008
and for all ages in 2012,57,58 which may have contributed
to the less rapid decline in prostate cancer death rates dur-
ing the most recent years compared with the previous
period. See Part II of this report for details on prostate
cancer rates and prostate-specific antigen testing patterns.
In contrast, it is believed that the rapid decrease in colorec-
tal cancer death rates over the past decades is because of
increased colonoscopy use59,60 after reimbursement of the
procedure was granted by Medicare for high-risk individu-
als in 1998 and for all eligible persons in 2001.61 Unlike
increases in breast cancer screening, which resulted in a
large percentage of cases being diagnosed with stage I dis-
ease, increased colorectal cancer screening—because it
detects precancerous polyps so they can be removed before
becoming cancer—has instead resulted in decreases in
incidence.
In addition to the decreases for the 4 most common
cancers, death rates decreased for many other cancers.
These include larynx (men), bladder (women), and esoph-
agus (men and women)—mainly because of reductions in
cigarette smoking and other tobacco use—and leukemia
(men and women) and NHL (men and women) because
of improved treatments.19

 We have observed that death rates continued to
increase for several cancers, including liver (both sexes),
pancreas (both sexes), uterus, and oral cavity and pharynx
cancer (men only). The increase in liver cancer death rates
has been associated with the high prevalence of hepatitis C
virus infection among Baby Boomers caused by sharing of
contaminated needles for intravenous drug use from the
1960s through the 1980s, as well as the obesity epi-
demic.18 It is also believed that the obesity epidemic has
contributed to the increase in endometrial (uterus lining)
and pancreas cancer death rates.14 It is estimated that obe-
sity accounts for 25% and 68% of pancreas and uterus
cancer deaths, respectively, in the United States.62 The
recent increase in oral cavity and pharynx cancer death
rates among men, confined to whites, is thought to be
associated with an increase in human papillomavirus
infection.63 A recent study estimated that approximately
11 million men and 3.2 million women have oral human
papillomavirus infection in the United States.64
The incidence of childhood cancers continues to
increase, whereas mortality is decreasing. The cancers
occurring in children represent a heterogeneous group of
cancer sites that vary by age. To better understand the fac-
tors influencing the rates, a careful examination of specific
cancer sites within this age group would be necessary.
Limitations
A limitation of this report is misclassification of race/eth-
nicity information in medical records (incidence), death
certificates, and the Census. Since 2000, the Census has
given respondents the option to self-select multiple race/
ethnicity categories; this has created incompatibility with
race/ethnicity information in medical records and death
certificates, which often have single race/ethnicity catego-
ries. To address this problem, the US Census Bureau, in
collaboration with the CDC’s NCHS and the NCI, have
developed methods to generate single-race population
estimates—but with some uncertainties about the popula-
tion estimates and resultant rates.65 Furthermore, race/
ethnicity information on death certificates is underascer-
tained for AI/AN, API, and Hispanic populations,27,28
leading to an underestimation of cancer rates. In addition,
cancer rates for broad racial and ethnic groups (eg, His-
panics and APIs) may mask important variations in cancer
burden by country of origin.
Conclusions
For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates
decreased among men but were stable among women.
Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer
death rates among both men and women. Differences in
rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress
in reducing cancer mortality has not occurred for all sites,
the most notable exceptions being liver cancer and uterus
cancer. Examining stage distribution and 5-year survival
by stage highlights the potential benefits associated with
early detection and treatment. The continued monitoring
of national statistics identifies areas for potential interven-
tion and control to reduce the burden of cancer in the US
population.
