abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hospital readmission rates are increasingly used to assess quality. 
Little is known, however, about potential preventability of readmissions among children. 
Our objective was to evaluate potential preventability of 30-day readmissions using 
medical record review and interviews.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 305 children (<18 years old) readmitted within 30 
days to a freestanding children’
s hospital between December 2012 and February 2013. 
Interviews (N = 1459) were conducted with parents/guardians, patients (if ≥13 years old), 
inpatient clinicians, and primary care providers. Reviewers evaluated medical records, 
interview summaries, and transcripts, and then rated potential preventability. Multivariate 
regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with potentially preventable 
readmission. Adjusted event curves were generated to model days to readmission.
RESULTS: Of readmissions, 29.5% were potentially preventable. Potentially preventable 
readmissions occurred sooner after discharge than non–potentially preventable 
readmissions (5 vs 9 median days; P < .001). The odds of a readmission being potentially 
preventable were greatest when the index admission and readmission were causally 
related (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0–6.8) and when 
hospital (AOR: 16.3; 95% CI: 5.9–44.8) or patient (AOR: 7.1; 95% CI: 2.5–20.5) factors were 
identified. Interviews provided new information about the readmission in 31.2% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 30% of 30-day readmissions to a children’
s hospital may be potentially 
preventable. Hospital and patient factors are associated with potential preventability and 
may provide targets for quality improvement efforts. Interviews contribute important 
information and should be considered when evaluating readmissions.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Hospital 
readmission rates are increasingly used as measures 
of hospital quality. Limited information is available 
on whether pediatric readmissions are potentially 
preventable; however, no studies in children have 
incorporated medical record review and interviews in 
assessing potential preventability of readmissions.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Nearly 30% of 30-day 
readmissions to a children’s hospital were potentially 
preventable. Hospital and patient factors were often 
identifi
 ed for these readmissions. Parent and provider 
interviews, in combination with medical record 
reviews, provided important information about 
potential preventability of readmissions.

Hospital readmissions are disruptive 
to patients and families and costly 
to our health care system. Given 
that studies in adults suggest that 
preventable readmissions can 
result from the care received during 
the index (ie, initial) admission, 
inadequate discharge planning or 
postdischarge follow-up, or poor 
coordination among providers, 
adult readmission rates are widely 
used as a quality measure for public 
reporting and pay-for-performance. 
1, 
 
2 
Increasingly, pediatric hospital 
readmission rates are also being used 
as a quality measure. 
3, 
 
4 The Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) and many state Medicaid 
agencies have levied financial 
penalties for hospitals with high 
30-day readmission rates. Although 
the CMS does not apply financial 
penalties for pediatric readmissions, 
a growing number of states are 
applying penalties for pediatric 
readmissions.5

A common criticism of using 
readmission rates as a health 
care quality measure is that many 
readmissions are not causally related 
to the hospital care provided during 
the index admission; rather, they may 
represent worsening of underlying 
chronic disease. 
12, 
 
13 In addition, some 
argue that hospitals should not be 
held accountable for readmissions 
because factors that contribute 
to readmissions often are not 
hospital factors (eg, postoperative 
complication) but instead are 
outpatient (eg, nurse unable to visit 
home) or patient (eg, not taking 
prescribed medications) factors and 
thus beyond the hospital’
s direct 
control. 
14, 
 
15
Currently, 3 main strategies 
for ascertaining the potential 
preventability of hospital 
readmissions include the following: 
claims-based algorithms, medical 
record review, and structured 
interviews. Claims-based 
algorithms are perceived to be 
limited in identifying reasons for 
readmission. 
16, 
 
17 Medical record 
review and structured interviews 
may offer more information. 
Although interviews provide 
opportunities to obtain even more 
detailed information, it is unclear 
whether interviews enhance 
information obtained from medical 
records or are duplicative. Because 
interviews are time intensive and 
costly, it is important to understand 
their value.
It remains unclear how many 
readmissions in children may be 
preventable and whether factors 
contributing to preventable 
readmissions can be identified. 
Furthermore, no previous study 
in children has compared medical 
record review and structured 
interviews in assessing readmissions. 
Thus, our study aimed to determine 
the potential preventability 
of unplanned 30-day hospital 
readmissions, to identify factors that 
contribute to readmissions, and to 
assess whether structured interviews 
add substantial valuable information 
beyond medical record review.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a cross-sectional 
study of unplanned 30-day hospital 
readmissions at a freestanding 
children’
s hospital. Patients <18 
years old who were readmitted 
between December 10, 2012, and 
February 22, 2013 (ie, discharged 
from the same hospital in the 30 
days before the readmission), were 
potentially eligible for the study. 
Exclusion criteria included the 
following: planned readmissions 
(eg, scheduled surgeries or 
chemotherapy), psychiatric 
readmissions, and readmissions 
for end-of-life care. Patients 
were only included once during 
the study period. For 2 common 
conditions (fever and neutropenia 
in oncology patients, bleeding after 
tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy), 
only a random subsample (1 of 
every 3 readmissions) was included. 
Of the 928 patients readmitted 
during the study period, 378 
were potentially eligible on the 
basis of study exclusion criteria. 
Thirty-nine patients with 1 of the 
2 frequently occurring conditions 
were randomized out. Parents 
declined participation or could 
not be contacted for 9 patients. An 
additional 25 patients were excluded 
for other reasons (eg, possible child 
abuse). In total, the study included 
305 patients.
Data Collection
Research nurses and research 
assistants conducted 1192 
semistructured interviews with 
parents or caregivers, henceforth 
referred to as “parents” (n = 
305), adolescent patients (n = 
42), inpatient nurses (n = 297) 
and attending physicians at time 
of readmission (n = 304), social 
workers (n = 91) and case managers 
(n = 104) who were involved in the 
index admission, and subspecialists 
who comanage children with 
medical complexity (n = 49). Parent 
and adolescent interviews were 
conducted by using a semistructured 
interview script, recorded, and 
transcribed. The inpatient provider 
interviews were conducted by using 
a structured interview form. We 
conducted training sessions and a 
9-day pilot before the collection of 
actual study data to refine the study 
logistics and survey instrument. 
Study data were collected and 
managed by using REDCap, a secure, 
Web-based application. 
18 
A pediatrician conducted telephone 
interviews with primary care 
providers (PCPs; n = 267) with the 
use of a structured interview form. 
Thirteen PCPs were unreachable 
or declined participation. PCP 
interviews were excluded for 
international patients (n = 13), 
patients without a designated PCP

(n = 8), and incomplete PCP 
interviews (n = 4).
Four pediatric physician reviewers 
(3 inpatient/outpatient providers 
and 1 outpatient provider) who 
did not conduct interviews 
independently conducted structured 
medical record reviews for all 
readmissions. Reviewers received 
standardized training in which they 
were presented with guidelines 
for assessing preventability and 
related factors by using Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement background 
frameworks. 
19 After completing 
medical record review, the physician 
reviewers assessed the readmission, 
examined transcripts and interview 
summaries, and determined 
whether the interviews changed 
their assessment of the readmission. 
Subsequently, a consensus 
review process was conducted 
that included the physician 
reviewer(s) and an academic general 
pediatrician with >1 decade of 
postgraduate experience. Because 
of the complexity of assessing 
preventability, we used a consensus 
review process similar to that used 
in other readmission-preventability 
studies. 
13, 
 
20, 
 
21 Each case had 1 
primary reviewer, with no fewer than 
3 pediatricians participating in the 
consensus review. In circumstances 
in which the readmission involved 
significant subspecialty care 
(eg, congenital heart disease 
postoperative management), relevant 
subspecialists were consulted.
Main Outcomes
The primary outcome measure 
was potential preventability of the 
readmission using a 4-point Likert 
scale (very likely to have been 
preventable, somewhat likely to have 
been preventable, somewhat unlikely 
to have been preventable, and very 
unlikely to have been preventable). 
Additional dichotomous outcomes 
included the following: causal 
relationship between index 
admission and readmission; index 
admission and readmission related 
by chronic illness; and presence 
of hospital, PCP, or patient factors 
contributing to the readmission. We 
characterized the contributing factors 
by using the overarching categories 
from the Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement’
s STAAR (STate Action 
on Avoidable Rehospitalizations) 
Readmissions Diagnostic Worksheet: 
“typical failures associated with 
patient assessment, 
” “typical failures 
found in patient and family caregiver 
education, 
” “typical failures in 
handover communication, 
” and 
“typical failures following discharge 
from the hospital.” 
22 We created 3 
additional categories: postoperative 
complication/hospital-acquired 
condition, contributing social 
factors/parental anxiety, and other. 
Secondary outcome measures 
covered whether the addition of the 
interviews to the medical record 
review changed the reviewers’
 
assessment of preventability (eg, 
from somewhat likely to have 
been preventable to somewhat 
unlikely to have been preventable) 
or enabled identification of new 
contributing factors for readmission 
(eg, new hospital contributing factor 
identified).
Covariates of Interest
Child demographic covariates 
included age in years (<1, 1–4, 
5–8, 9–12, and 13–17 years), sex, 
race/ethnicity (Asian, black/non-
Hispanic, Hispanic, white/non-
Hispanic, and other), and preferred 
language (English or non-English). 
To identify children with chronic 
disease, we used the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ) Chronic Condition Indicator 
(CCI), a classification system based 
on International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. 
23 
In addition, we counted the number 
of CCIs present for each patient 
(0, 1, 2, or ≥3).
Data Analysis
The 4-point scale for preventability 
was collapsed into a binary 
variable: potentially preventable 
(somewhat/very likely to have 
been preventable) and potentially 
nonpreventable (somewhat/very 
unlikely to have been preventable). 
First, we examined whether 
preventability was associated with 
patient characteristics. We then 
examined whether potentially 
preventable readmissions were 
associated with the following: (1) 
the readmission being causally 
related to the index admission, (2) 
the readmission being related to 
the index admission by underlying 
chronic disease, and (3) the presence 
of identifiable contributing factors. 
We examined the association 
between preventability rating 
and the presence of different 
chronic conditions (measured by 
CCI category). We also assessed 
whether patients with chronic 
conditions were more likely to have 
certain contributing factors in their 
readmissions. Bivariate associations 
were tested by using Fisher’
s 
exact tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests as appropriate; multivariate 
associations were tested by using 
multivariate logistic regression 
models adjusting for additional 
covariates.
The overall crude 30-day 
readmission rate for the hospital 
was calculated for the study period 
by using the AHRQ-CMS Pediatric 
All-Condition Readmission Measure 
SAS program. 
4 We compared the 
mean days to readmission by using 
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the 
following conditions: (1) potentially 
preventable and not preventable, 
(2) causally related and not causally 
related, (3) due to underlying chronic 
disease and not due to underlying 
chronic disease, and (4) contributing 
factor and no contributing factor 
identified. As an illustration of 
time to readmission, we generated 
adjusted event curves on the basis of 
3

Downloaded from 
  
TOOMEY et al 
Cox proportional hazard models to 
adjust for age, sex, language, and CCI 
count; and the model coefficient Wald 
tests were used to compare the event 
curves between groups.
We assessed the change in perception 
of potential preventability and the 
addition of contributing factors with 
the inclusion of the semistructured 
interviews. Statistical analysis was 
conducted by using SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and 
Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX). The Boston Children’
s 
Hospital Institutional Review Board 
determined that this study was 
exempt.
RESULTS
The overall readmission rate for the 
hospital during the study period was 
6.5%. Of the readmissions included 
in the study, 29.5% were determined 
to be potentially preventable: 
11.8% very likely, 17.7% somewhat 
likely, 16.1% somewhat unlikely, 
and 54.4% very unlikely. In 
bivariate analysis, potentially 
preventable readmissions and 
non–potentially preventable 
readmissions did not vary 
significantly on the basis of patient 
age, sex, language, or race/ethnicity 
( 
Table 1). Although potentially 
preventable and non–potentially 
preventable readmissions did not 
vary significantly by number of 
chronic conditions, for 2 of the 
18 chronic condition categories, 
neoplasms (2.2% vs 9.8%; P = .03) 
and diseases of blood/blood-forming 
organs (1.1% vs 8.8%; 
P = .01), readmissions were more 
likely to be considered non–
potentially preventable. In contrast, 
readmissions for congenital 
anomalies were more likely to be 
considered potentially preventable 
(40.0% vs 22.3%; P = .002).
Of all readmissions, 48.9% were 
deemed to be causally related to 
the index admission and 63.8% 
were deemed to be due to a chronic 
disease. Potentially preventable 
readmissions were more often 
causally related to the index 
admission (74.1% vs 38.6%; 
P < .001); however, no association 
between chronic disease and 
preventability was observed 
(P = .59).
At least 1 contributing factor 
was identified more often for 
potentially preventable than 
for non–potentially preventable 
readmissions (86.7% vs 20.4%; 
P < .001). Potentially preventable 
readmissions more often had 
hospital (77.1% vs 16.7%; P < .001), 
PCP (14.5% vs 0.5%; P < .001), and 
patient (39.2% vs 9.2%; P < .001) 
contributing factors identified. 
Among all readmissions, 36.2% 
were associated with hospital 
factors, 4.6% with PCP factors, 
and 18.1% with patient factors.

Hospital factors were most often 
related to “patient assessment” 
(37.4%) and postoperative 
complications/hospital-acquired 
conditions (28.0%); PCP factors 
were most often related to 
“patient assessment” (58.3%) 
and “handover communication” 
(25.0%); and patient factors were 
most often related to “following 
discharge from the hospital” 
(60.4%) ( 
Table 2).
In multivariate analyses adjusting 
for age, sex, language, and CCI count, 
potentially preventable readmissions, 
when compared with non–potentially 
preventable readmissions, had 
increased odds of being causally 
related to the index admission 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.6; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.02–6.75). Potentially preventable 
readmissions also had increased odds 
of identification of a hospital (AOR: 
16.3; 95% CI: 5.94– 44.81) or patient 
(AOR: 7.1; 95% CI: 2.45–20.48) factor 
( 
Table 3).
The mean days to readmission 
( 
Fig 1) was shorter for potentially 
preventable readmissions than 
for non–potentially preventable 
readmissions (4 vs 9 median 
days; Wilcoxon test, P < .001). 
Similar findings were observed for 
readmissions that were causally 
related to the index admission (4 vs 
14 median days; Wilcoxon test, P < 
.001) and for readmissions for which 
a contributing factor was identified 
in comparison with readmissions 
where one was not (5 vs 10 median 
days; Wilcoxon test, P < .001). The 
time to readmission was significantly 
longer for readmissions that were 
related to underlying chronic disease 
(9 vs 5 median days; Wald test, 
P < .001). These comparisons of the 
curves between preventable and 
nonpreventable and the other factors 
were also significant (Wald test, P < 
.01).
New information was learned 
from the interview regarding the 
readmission in 31.2% of all cases. 
For instance, a complicated patient 
was readmitted with respiratory 
distress 1 week after discharge. 
We learned from the physician 
that the family declined to have 
their child go to a rehabilitation 
center after the index admission. 
In another example, a patient 
readmitted with gastrostomy-tube 
cellulitis was initially discharged 
without a visiting nurse. However, 
we learned from the parent that 
they were frequently checking the 
gastrostomy-tube site and that 
the cellulitis developed rapidly 
and would not have been picked 
up earlier had a visiting nurse 
been coming to the home. In 
another case, we learned from the 
parent that because of delays in

factors in 15.1% of cases. In 11.8% 
of all cases, new information 
learned from the interviews 
changed the final assessment of 
potential preventability of the 
readmission. In cases in which the 
reviewers’
 opinion regarding the 
potential preventability changed 
after the interview review, 
47.2% of cases were revised 
from potentially nonpreventable 
to potentially preventable 
and 8.3% from potentially 
preventable to nonpreventable. For 
the remaining cases, the assessment 
shifted without changing the 
direction of the preventability 
rating (eg, a change from somewhat 
to very likely to have been 
preventable). New information 
learned from the interviews was 
predominantly gained from parents 
(21.6%), attending physicians 
(14.8%), PCPs (11.1%), and 
inpatient nurses (7.2%). The 
information learned was mainly 
about the hospital (19.0%), parents 
(15.1%), patients (7.9%), and 
PCPs (4.6%).
DISCUSSION
We found that 29.5% of all-cause, 
unplanned, 30-day readmissions to a 
tertiary care children’
s hospital were 
potentially preventable. Potentially 
preventable readmissions were 
more likely to be causally related 
to the index admission and have 
an associated contributing factor 
identified than were readmissions 
that were non–potentially 
preventable. Hospital and patient 
factors were strongly associated 
with potentially preventable 
readmission. Although many 
children with underlying 
chronic disease are readmitted, 
preventability was not associated 
with the presence of an underlying 
chronic disease.

Our findings are largely consistent 
with the few studies that assessed 
the preventability of readmissions 
in the pediatric setting. One 
study on unplanned pediatric 
readmissions found that the most 
common reasons cited for them 
were disease progression and 
procedural complications. 
24 The 
rate of potentially preventable 
readmissions has varied across 
pediatric studies. For instance, 
1 study that performed medical 
record reviews of 200 patients 
readmitted to a tertiary care 
children’
s hospital within 15 days 
of discharge found that 20% of 
readmissions were considered 
likely to be preventable. 
13 
In another study, 42.6% of 
readmissions or revisits to the 
emergency department within 
90 days of discharge after an 
appendectomy admission were 
deemed potentially avoidable. 
25
In comparison with other methods 
for calculating potentially 
preventable readmissions in 
pediatric settings, our rate of 
potentially preventable readmissions 
is lower than previously reported 
rates that used claims-based 
software algorithms but higher 
than those that used medical 
record review. 
26, 
 
27 Discordance 
between automated and manual 
review of readmissions has been 
previously noted. 
28 Claims-based 
algorithms may overestimate 
the preventability by not fully 
accounting for patient characteristics 
(eg, severity of chronic condition) 
and planned readmissions. 
29, 
30 
Medical record review, on the 
other hand, may provide added 
clinical detail but may be limited 
in ascertaining the contribution of 
sociodemographic characteristics 
that may not be documented in the 
medical record (eg, unmet social 
needs, medication adherence) or 
may occur outside of the hospital 
(eg, missed appointments, 
transportation barriers), thereby 
leading to underestimation of the 
likelihood of preventability. 
13, 
 
25, 
 
31 
– 
34 
Interviews in combination with 
medical record review may provide 
a more global understanding of 
these circumstances leading up to, 
and after, a child’
s hospitalization. 
Due to the complexity of assessing 
preventability, we chose to use a 
multistep approach that culminated 
in a consensus review.
In contrast to other studies 
that have shown an association 
between clinical characteristics 
and readmissions in other settings, 
our study did not observe an 
association between certain 
patient clinical characteristics 
and potentially preventable 
readmissions. 
13, 
 
24 
– 
26, 
31, 
 
32, 
 
34 
 
– 
38 This 
difference may be related to the 
high overall prevalence of chronic 
illness in our sample. Chronically ill 
children may be more vulnerable to 
potentially preventable readmissions 
due to medical fragility and increased 
care needs after discharge (eg, 
specialty appointments, multiple 
medications); however, their parents 
may be more comfortable navigating 
the health care system. Further 
research is needed to examine the 
role of chronic illness in potentially 
preventable readmissions.
Potentially preventable readmissions 
occurred sooner after hospital 
discharge than did non–potentially 
preventable readmissions. We 
observed a strong association 
between hospital factors and 
potential preventability and also 
found that readmissions with hospital 
contributing factors were more 
likely to occur sooner after hospital 
discharge than readmissions without. 
Our findings suggest that readmissions 
occurring closer to the index admission 
are more likely to be preventable.
A majority of potentially preventable 
readmissions had an identified 
hospital contributing factor. Previous 
studies have identified hospital 
and clinician factors as a 
large portion of potentially 
preventable readmissions. 
39, 
 
40 
Hospital factors may serve as 
targets for quality improvement 
initiatives. In particular, we found 
that hospital factors were often 
related to patient assessment, such 
as failure to recognize worsening 
clinical status. Hospital factors 
were also often related to patient 
and family education and handover 
communication. Addressing these 
areas through improved discharge 
preparation and planning might 
help hospitals decrease preventable 
readmissions.
Our study has limitations. 
The retrospective interviews are 
subject to response bias. In addition, 
we conducted the study with children 
hospitalized at a tertiary care 
children’
s hospital, 
so this may limit the generalizability 
to non–children’
s hospitals. Because 
it was a single hospital, we were 
unable to examine characteristics of 
the treating hospital such as nurse 
staffing ratios, which have been 
shown to be associated with pediatric 
readmission rates. 
41
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that nearly 30% 
of readmissions were likely to have 
been prevented with better care 
delivery and that interviews provided 
new information about readmissions 
in nearly one-third of all cases. 
Although they are not the majority of 
readmissions, potentially preventable 
readmissions are prevalent enough 
to warrant monitoring readmission 
rates and to provide targets for 
quality improvement. Interviews 
led to a change in the assessment 
of the potential preventability and 
provided important information 
regarding the reasons for and 
contributing factors to readmissions 
in a substantial proportion of cases. 
On the basis of this study, targets for 
reducing readmissions might include

addressing hospital factors, such 
as the need for improved caregiver 
education, meeting social needs, and 
increasing rates of postdischarge 
follow-up. More broadly, parent and 
provider interviews offer important 
information regarding potential 
preventability and contributing 
factors for preventability.
