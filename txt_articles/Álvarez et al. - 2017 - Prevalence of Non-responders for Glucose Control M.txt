Background: Exercise training improves performance and biochemical parameters on
average, but wide interindividual variability exists, with individuals classified as responders
(R) or non-responders (NRs), especially between populations with higher or lower levels
of insulin resistance. This study assessed the effects of high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) and the prevalence of NRs in adult women with higher and lower levels of insulin
resistance.
Methods: Forty adult women were assigned to a HIIT program, and after training were
analyzed in two groups; a group with higher insulin resistance (H-IR, 40 ± 6 years; BMI:
29.5 ± 3.7 kg/m2; n = 20) and a group with lower insulin resistance (L-IR, 35 ± 9 years;
27.8 ± 2.8 kg/m2; n = 20). Anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, and performance
variables were measured at baseline and after 10 weeks of training.
Results:
There were significant training-induced changes [delta percent (�%)] in
fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) scores in the H-IR group (−8.8, −26.5, −32.1%, p < 0.0001), whereas
no significant changes were observed in the L-IR. Both groups showed significant
pre-post changes in other anthropometric variables [waist circumference (−5.2, p
< 0.010, and −3.8%, p = 0.046) and tricipital (−13.3, p < 0.010, and −13.6%,
p < 0.0001), supra-iliac (−19.4, p < 0.0001, and −13.6%, p < 0.0001), and
abdominal (−18.2, p < 0.0001, and −15.6%, p < 0.010) skinfold measurements].
Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in the L-IR group (−3.2%, p <
0.010). Both groups showed significant increases in 1RMLE (+12.9, p < 0.010, and
+14.7%, p = 0.045). There were significant differences in the prevalence of NRs
between the H-IR and L-IR groups for fasting glucose (25 vs. 95%, p < 0.0001)
and fasting insulin (p = 0.025) but not for HOMA-IR (25 vs. 45%, p = 0.185).

Non-responders to High-Intensity Interval Training
Conclusion:
Independent of the “magnitude” of the cardiometabolic disease (i.e.,
higher vs. lower insulin resistance), no differences were observed in the NRs prevalence
with regard to improved HOMA-IR or to anthropometric, cardiovascular, and muscle
performance co-variables after 10 weeks of HIIT in sedentary adult women. This research
demonstrates the protective effect of HIIT against cardiometabolic disease progression
in a sedentary population.

INTRODUCTION
Exercise training is a strategy for the prevention and treatment
of several inactivity-related metabolic diseases, such as insulin
resistance (Álvarez et al., 2014) and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM)
(Alvarez
et
al.,
2016).
Similarly,
exercise-based
interventions, including resistance training (RT), together
with pharmacological, and dietary interventions, represent the
cornerstones of T2DM management (ADA, 2011). In addition
to the beneficial effects on glycemic control (Umpierre et al.,
2013) and other risk factors of T2DM (Chudyk and Petrella,
2011; Figueira et al., 2014), physical exercise is effective in
improving muscle strength (Dunstan et al., 2002), cardiovascular
function (Cano-Montoya et al., 2016), and functional capacity
(Cadore and Izquierdo, 2015). In this regard, combining RT and
endurance training is an effective intervention to promote overall
physical fitness in T2DM patients (Balducci et al., 2012). More
recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT, i.e., repeated
short bursts of high intensity activity with rest breaks in between
each bout of exercise) is a time-efficient exercise modality
that has emerged as an alternative to continuous traditional
endurance exercise training to improve cardiometabolic health
(Gibala et al., 2012).
However, despite the frequent reports of “average” exercise-
related changes, there is wide interindividual variability in the
results of exercise training (Astorino and Schubert, 2014). Under
the same stimulus, some subjects, termed responders (R), achieve
benefits after training, while others, termed non-responders
(NRs), show an unchanged or worsened response (Bouchard
et al., 2012; Bonafiglia et al., 2016; Álvarez et al., 2017). In
the literature, this phenomenon has been characterized using
several terms, such as low/high responders (Davidsen et al.,
2011), non-responders/responders (Sisson et al., 2009), or as an
adverse response (Bouchard et al., 2012); in these studies, similar
but slightly different methodological criteria have been applied
for identifying R and NRs. Genetic (Stephens et al., 2015) and
environmental factors (Bouchard and Rankinen, 2001) have been
suggested to be responsible for this variability, although not all of

the potential environmental factors (e.g., different health status,
magnitude of disease, or different mode of exercise training) have
been explored.
Furthermore, the prevalence of these unchanged or worsened
responses, known as NRs prevalence (i.e., percentage of subjects
who do not improve/show a worsened response with regard to
a variable), has been reported predominantly after endurance
training (Sisson et al., 2009; Bouchard et al., 2012) and RT (Moker
et al., 2014; Churchward-Venne et al., 2015). There have been
no studies reporting the NRs prevalence associated with risk
factors for T2DM after HIIT, which has been shown to improve
anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, and performance
variables in different cohorts (Astorino and Schubert, 2014;
Alvarez et al., 2016). For example, in one study of insulin
resistance adult women, there were reductions of −12 to −14%
in fasting glucose, −27 to −37% in fasting insulin and ∼40% in
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
scores after 8 weeks of HIIT (Álvarez et al., 2014). In another
study of T2DM subjects, there was a decrease of ∼14% in
fasting glucose, with additional decreases of ∼4 mmHg in blood
pressure, ∼2% in body mass, ∼4% in waist circumference, and
∼19% in subcutaneous fat after 16 weeks of HIIT (Alvarez et al.,
2016). Notably, another study showed that only 2 weeks of HIIT
decreased the average 24 h fasting glucose level by approximately
−13% (Little et al., 2011). Finally, a study of subjects with poor
glucose control showed an improvement (−12%) in the area
under the curve for the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results
and a 4.2 kg decrease in fat mass after 10 weeks of HIIT (Mancilla
et al., 2014).
Latin America has experienced an epidemiological transition
characterized by an increasing burden of cardiometabolic disease
due to physical inactivity and shifts in diet and lifestyle
patterns (Rivera et al., 2014). Evidence in Chilean adults
suggests similar associations between low physical activity
levels and cardiometabolic risk factors and between health
status and overweight/obesity (Vio et al., 2008). Thus, the
aim of the present study was to assess the effects 10 weeks
of HIIT and the NRs prevalence (as indicated by glucose
control variables) in groups with higher and lower levels
of insulin resistance. A second aim was to assess other
anthropometric, cardiovascular, and performance variables. We
hypothesized that independent of the magnitude of the metabolic
disease [i.e., higher (HOMA-IR > 5.0) or lower (HOMA-
IR < 3.0) levels of insulin resistance], there would be no
differences in the NRs prevalence for changes in glucose
control parameters after HIIT between women with higher

and lower levels of insulin resistance using the HOMA-IR
criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The first stage of the study was to recruit, using a short telephone
survey, adult patients who were previously identified at their last
clinical exam as at risk for T2DM and who had dropped out
from their regular appointments at the healthcare center. In this
first stage, 168 sedentary adult women (aged ≥18 years) with
no background of regular exercise training volunteered to be
screened.
Screening and Preliminary Testing
First, subjects were screened for insulin resistance based on a
HOMA-IR > 2.6 using both fasting glucose and fasting insulin,
and after intervention the subjects were separated into two
groups and analyzed based on differences in the “magnitude”
of insulin resistance (i.e., a group with a higher level of insulin
resistance: HOMA-IR > 5.0, and a group with a lower level
insulin resistance: HOMA-IR < 3.0). In the first screening
before intervention, 65 individuals classified as “higher insulin-
resistance” subjects (n = 65) were excluded for multiple reasons
(16 due to age > 40 years; 2 due to being recently physically
active; 5 due to a diagnosis of hypertension; 5 due to a diagnosis
of hypothyroidism; 3 due to musculoskeletal injury; 21 due to
no history of T2DM; 6 due to stationary asthma/respiratory
disease; and 7 due to having a rural address). Similarly, 25 subjects
identified as “lower insulin-resistance” subjects (n = 25) were also
excluded for similar reasons (6 due to age ≥40 years; 12 due to
being physically active; 2 due to a diagnosis of hypothyroidism;
and 5 due to having a rural address). Finally, 78 screened subjects
with a higher level of insulin resistance (n = 78) were assigned to
10 weeks of a HIIT program and were analyzed after intervention
in two different groups: a group with a higher level of insulin
resistance (H-IR, n = 20) and a group with a lower level of
insulin resistance (L-IR, n = 20). None of the subjects were taking
oral hypoglycemic medications to improve metabolic control
of glucose because they all had been recently diagnosed with
insulin resistance by our research team. Subjects with < 70%
attendance at training sessions were excluded from all statistical
analyses after the intervention; after excluding those subjects, the
characteristics of the analyzed subject groups were as follows: H-
IR group, age 40 ± 6 years, n = 20; L-IR group, age 35 ± 9 years,
n = 20 (see flow chart in Figure 1). The treatment allocation is
described in the flow chart in Figure 1.
All participants were informed about the experimental
procedures and about possible risks and benefits associated
with participation in the study. Written informed consent was
obtained before any of the assessments were performed. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board for
the use of human subjects of the local Ethics Committee of the
University of los Lagos (Comité de Revisión Científica y Ética
Institucional del Departamento de Ciencias de la Actividad Física
de la Universidad de Los Lagos). Characteristics of the study
participants are provided in Tables 1, 2.
Eligibility criteria included the following: (a) diagnosed with
insulin resistance based on the HOMA-IR metabolic marker
method and using a cut-off point of HOMA-IR ≥2.6 in a Chilean
population (Garmendia et al., 2009), (b) physical inactivity (≤150
min/week of low-moderate physical activity or <75 min/week of
vigorous physical activity; O’Donovan et al., 2010), (c) no familial
(parents/siblings) history of T2DM, (d) living only in urban areas,
and (e) with care provided under the public Chilean healthcare
system (i.e., not a private healthcare system). Exclusion criteria

(g) utilization of drugs that modulate metabolic or respiratory

Classification of Responder (R) and
Non-responders (NRs)
Using previous criteria applied in exercise-based interventions
(Bonafiglia et al., 2016), the interindividual variability in the
response to exercise training of the subjects was used to categorize
them as responders (R) or non-responders (NRs) using the
typical error measurement (TE). Thus, the TE was calculated
for all independents variables 3 weeks before the pre-test
measurements as described previously (Álvarez et al., 2017) using
the following equation:
TE = SDdiff /√2
(1)
where SDdiff is the variance (standard deviation) of the difference
in scores observed between the two repeats of each test. A non-
responders participant for HOMA-IR assessments, as well as
for all other included co-variables, was defined as an individual
who failed to demonstrate a decrease or increase (in favor of
beneficial changes) that was greater than two times the TE from
zero. A change greater than two times the TE means that there
is a high probability (i.e., 12 to 1 odds) that this response is a
true physiological adaptation beyond what might be expected
to result from technical and/or biological variability (Hopkins,
2000).
Procedures
Anthropometric and Cardiovascular Assessments
Anthropometric and blood pressure assessments were carried
out during the first week of the allocation stage. Body mass
was assessed using a digital scale with an accuracy of 0.1 kg
(Omron HBF-INTTM, Omron Healthcare Inc., Lake Forest,
IL, USA). Height was assessed with a professional stadiometer
(Health o MeterTM
Professional, Sunbeam Products Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm, and body
mass index (BMI) was calculated according to the following
formula:
kg/m2.

et al., 2006).
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed using an
automatic monitor (Omron HEM 7114TM, Omron Healthcare
Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) in triplicate (2-min interval between
measurements) after 15 min of rest and with the subjects in

a seated position following standard classification procedures
(Chobanian et al., 2003).
Plasma Metabolic Markers
The metabolic measurements were carried out in the second
week. Subjects arrived at the laboratory of the Riñihue clinic
between 8 and 10 in the morning after a 10 h overnight fast.
Blood samples (approximately 3.5 mL) were collected in tubes
with specific anticoagulant gels for fasting glucose and fasting
insulin measurements at baseline and at the 10 week follow-up.
Samples were placed on ice and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm (1,700 ×
g) for 5 min at 4◦C. Plasma samples were immediately transferred
to pre-chilled microtubes and stored at −20◦C for later analysis.
Plasma glucose was analyzed via enzymatic methods using
standard kits (Wiener Lab Inc., Rosario, Argentina) on an
automatic analyzer (Metrolab 2300 PlusTM, Metrolab Biomed
Inc., Buenos Aires, Argentina). Fasting insulin was measured
via RIA (DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The HOMA-IR index
was calculated using the Matthews equation (Matthews et al.,
1985): HOMA-IR = [Fasting glucose (mg/dL) × Fasting insulin
(µU/dL)]/405). The same blood sampling and preparation
procedure was performed at the end of the 10 week follow-up 48
h after the last exercise session in the morning to avoid possible
acute effects of exercise.
Familiarization with the Exercise Training Program
In weeks 3 and 4, in three sessions, the subjects in both the H-
IR and L-IR groups underwent a familiarization period for the
HIIT protocol, as well as for the 1RMLE- and 1RMUR-tests. In
the first and second sessions, the subjects were educated about
the cycling machines and the free weights, as well as the exercise
machine used for the strength test. In the following four sessions,
the subjects underwent HIIT.
One-Repetition Maximum Test
In week 5, after a familiarization process with the test and
before the intervention, both groups performed one-repetition
maximum strength tests to establish 1RMLE- and 1RMUR-values
as previously described (Izquierdo et al., 2004). The 1RMLE-
test involved an exercise machine (OXFORDTM, model EE4002,
Santiago, Chile), and in the 1RMUR-test, free weights with bars
were used. In brief, for the 1RMLE-test, the subjects began by
lifting a load of weights on the machine with both legs. For
the 1RMUR-test, the subjects adopted a body flexion angle of
90◦, grabbed a bar with weights and plates, and with both arms
extended, lifted the bar to approximately knee height. The highest
load from three attempts per exercise was reported.
Experimental Protocol
The HIIT program was started in the sixth week and was
performed three times per week, for a total of 30 sessions,
using exercise bikes (OXFORDTM, model BE2601, OXFORD Inc.,
Santiago, Chile). Each participant performed a range of 8–12
cycling intervals during the intervention period. The time of each
cycling work interval was 60 s, with 120 s of passive rest (sitiing
on the bicycle without movement) between work intervals. This
rest period was progressively decreased (2 min weeks 1–2, 1.45

min weeks 3–5, 1.30 min weeks 6–8, and 1.15 min weeks 9–10),
reaching a time of 1.15 min in the tenth week. Cycle revolutions
were maintained at a range of 50–70 rpm and a speed between 20
and 40 km/h during each work interval. Subjects were required to
cycle at levels between 8 and 10 points on a modified 0–10 Borg
scale during the work interval (Ciolac et al., 2015). This subjective
intensity corresponds to a range of 70–100% of the maximum
heart rate according to the Karvonen formula (Karvonen and
Vuorimaa, 1988). All subjects had good exercise tolerance, and
none of the participants reported an injury. Exercise compliance
was 82.0 ± 3% in the H-IR group and 79.3 ± 4% in the L-IR
group.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions for all data
were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk-test and Levene’s-test,
respectively. The Wilcoxon-test was used for non-parametric
data. One-way ANOVA was performed to test differences
between groups at baseline. An ANCOVA was conducted to
analyze variables that were significantly different at baseline.
A repeated-measures ANOVA (group × time) was used to
determine differences in all dependent variables between pre-
and post-tests using each group × time. A chi-square test (X2)
was used to determine differences between categorical variables
for R and NRs by group (H-IR × L-IR). After the intervention,
the typical error (TE) were calculated for the pre-post changes
for each dependent variable. The subjects were categorized as
a R or NRs according to the previously described criteria of a
change greater than two times the TE (Bonafiglia et al., 2016).
The Bonferroni post-hoc test was applied to establish differences
among groups. Additionally, Cohen’s-test was used to detect
effect sizes (ESs), with threshold values at 0.20, 0.60, 1.2, and
2.0 for small, moderate, large, and very large effects, respectively
(Hopkins et al., 2009). ES-values are presented as the mean with
95% confidence limits. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to assess
differences in dichotomous NRs variables between groups. All
statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software
version 18 (SPSSTM Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The alpha level
was fixed at p ≤ 0.05 for determining statistical significance in all
cases.
RESULTS
Anthropometric Measurements
At baseline, there were significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences between
groups for abdominal skinfold thickness (Table 1). There were
significant (p ≤ 0.05) pre-post changes [presented as delta
percent (�%)] in waist circumference (−5.2, −3.8%) and in
tricipital (−13.3, −13.6%), supra-iliac (−19.4, −13.6%), and
abdominal skinfold thicknesses (−18.2, −15.6%) in both the
H-IR and L-IR groups (Table 1).
Cardiovascular Measurements
At baseline, there were no significant (p > 0.05) differences
between the groups for diastolic or systolic blood pressure
(Table 1). After intervention, the L-IR group showed significant
pre-post changes in systolic blood pressure (−2.3%) (Table 2),
whereas there were no significant changes in diastolic blood
pressure in any group (Table 2).
Metabolic Measurements
At baseline, there were significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences between
the groups for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-
IR scores (Table 2). After intervention, there were no pre-post
changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, or HOMA-IR scores
in L-IR group (Table 2). There were significant (p ≤ 0.05)
pre-post changes [presented as delta percent (∆%)] in fasting
glucose (−8.8%), fasting insulin (−26.5%), and HOMA-IR scores
(−32.1%) in the H-IR group (Table 2). The ES-values were high
for fasting glucose (−1.65; 95%CI −2.07, −1.22) and HOMA-IR
scores (−1.23; 95%CI −1.60, −0.85) in the H-IR group (Table 2).

Muscle Performance Measurements
At baseline, there were no significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences
between groups for 1RMLE and 1RMUR (Table 2). After
intervention, there were significant (p ≤ 0.05) pre-post changes
in 1RMLE in the H-IR (+12.9) and L-IR (+14.7%) groups
(Table 2), whereas 1RMUR remained unchanged in both groups.
The ES-value was high for 1RMLE (1.25; 95%CI 1.04, 1.45) in the
L-IR group (Table 2).
Differences in NRs Prevalence between the
H-IR vs. L-IR Groups with Respect to
Glucose Control Variables
There were significant differences between the H-IR vs. L-IR
groups in NRs prevalence with regard to improved fasting
glucose (25.0 vs. 95.0%, p < 0.0001) and fasting insulin (25.0
vs. 60.0%, p = 0.025). There were no significant differences
between the H-IR vs. L-IR groups in NRs prevalence with regard
to a decrease in HOMA-IR scores (25.0 vs. 45.0%, p = 0.185;
Figure 2).
Differences in the NRs Prevalence between
the H-IR vs. L-IR Groups with Respect to
Other Anthropometric, Cardiovascular, and
Performance Variables
There were no significant differences between the H-IR vs.
L-IR groups in NRs prevalence with regard to improvements
in anthropometric parameters (i.e., body mass, BMI, waist
circumference,
and
tricipital,
supra-iliac,
and
abdominal
skinfolds), muscle performance (i.e., 1RMLE and 1RMUR), or
cardiovascular parameters (i.e., systolic/diastolic blood pressure;
Table 3).
The OR analysis for NRs prevalence detected a high risk
of being a NRs (>2-fold) associated with improved waist
circumference (OR: 2.1, 95%CI 0.1, 3.2), diastolic blood pressure
(OR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.5, 2.9), fasting glucose (OR: 4.0, 95%CI 2.2,
14.4), and 1RMUR (OR: 2.1, 95%CI 0.5, 9.0; Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The present study was designed to assess the effects 10 weeks
of HIIT and NRs prevalence (as indicated by glucose control
parameters) in adult women with higher and lower levels of
insulin resistance to test if the “magnitude” of a metabolic disease
play a role in increasing or decreasing the NRs prevalence. The
major findings of this study indicate that (i) HIIT promotes
significantly more benefits in training-induced changes in fasting
glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR scores in adult women
with higher insulin resistance; (ii) the NRs prevalence was
significantly different between the H-IR vs. L-IR groups with
regard to improve fasting glucose and fasting insulin but
not for HOMA-IR scores; and (iii) both the H-IR and L-IR
groups experienced similar positive training-induced changes
and similar NRs prevalence with regard to anthropometric (body
mass, BMI), cardiovascular (systolic/diastolic blood pressure),
and muscle strength performance (1RMLE, 1RMUR) measures.
Several environmental factors related to NRs prevalence have
been reported after training interventions. For example, a recent
report assessed the effects of RT at different frequencies (3
and 2 days/week) to tests the effect of frequency in older NRs
subjects for 12 and 24 weeks. Major differences between both
training regimens were found for body mass, which decreased
by ∼4.5% at 12 weeks and 23% at 24 weeks. Interestingly, other
results included increases in type I (+34.5 vs. +29.4%) and type
II muscle fibers (+22.7 vs. +21.1%), as well as increasing leg
strength in extension exercises (+0.9 vs. +1.17%) at 12 and 24
weeks, with relatively similar results obtained independent of the
training frequency. These results indicated that the frequency of
training was not necessarily related to the NRs prevalence for
some variables (Churchward-Venne et al., 2015).
There is limited evidence about interindividual variability in
exercise training with regard to the NRs prevalence in subjects
with low glucose control, and there are several methodological
differences in studies comparing the NRs prevalences observed
in previous studies (Boulé et al., 2005; Gremeaux et al., 2012;
Yates et al., 2013; Moker et al., 2014; Winett et al., 2014;
Higgins et al., 2015). For example, for glucose control variables,
several authors have observed that after 3 months of strength
training (2 days/week, 2 strength exercises at maximal effort),
the NRs prevalence for improvements in an OGTT in pre-
diabetic patients was 44%. In the present study, we found a
NRs prevalence of 15 and 25% in the H-IR and L-IR groups,
respectively, for decreased fasting glucose, with no significant
difference between the groups (to see Table 3; Winett et al.,
2014). Regarding HOMA-IR, the HERITAGE study (Boulé et al.,
2005) showed that after 20 weeks of endurance training [30–50
min/session, 55–75% maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) for
20 weeks], 42% of subjects were NRs for a decrease in HOMA-
IR scores. We found similar results regarding a decrease in
HOMA-IR scores, with a NRs prevalence of 15 and 20% for
the H-IR and L-IR groups, respectively (Figure 2). Therefore,
considering our 10 weeks of HIIT-based exercise vs. the 20 weeks
of endurance exercise in the abovementioned study (Boulé et al.,
2005), increasing the environmental “volume” factor of exercise
may not necessarily be related to a decrease in the NRs prevalence
for improved glucose control variables such as HOMA-IR scores.
In a different study (Yates et al., 2013), NRs prevalence of 3%
was reported for decreased fasting glucose after 12 months of
exercise-based intervention. Similarly, when T2DM subjects were
tested after 9 months of endurance training, RT or concurrent
training in another study (Stephens et al., 2015), 21% of subjects
were NRs for decreased glycated hemoglobin, as well as other
body composition and protein markers.
Understanding the NRs prevalence after exercise modes such
as HIIT and including populations with higher and lower risks
of T2DM, such as those with higher and lower levels of insulin
resistance, can be useful for designing more efficient exercise
interventions: in this case, populations with higher levels of
insulin resistance, such as the H-IR group, defined based on
fasting glucose and HOMA-IR scores, are less likely to be
NRs after 10 weeks of HIIT. This altered baseline, which we
termed previously as “higher insulin resistance,” may be in
some way related to potential factors for predicting responses

in future long-term studies. Collectively, and in combination
with previous reports (Hecksteden et al., 2013b), these findings
indicate that the “magnitude” of changes in response to an
acute exercise session can be a potential factor for predicting
responses to chronic exercise-based interventions. In this study,
the magnitude of changes in plasma variables after volitional
exercise was very similar to results from another study where
subjects showed decreased fasting insulin after chronic exercise
training [walking/running at 60% peak oxygen consumption
(VO2peak) for 4 weeks].
Another study (Moker et al., 2014) exploring another
co-variable, blood pressure, showed that after 5 months of
endurance training (65–80% VO2peak, walking/jogging), RT (8–
12 repetitions per set, 8 exercises, 70–85% of their one-maximum
repetition value), or concurrent training, approximately ∼60%
of subjects were NRs for a decrease in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure. In our study, we found a NRs prevalence of
20 and 15% for decreased systolic blood pressure in the H-IR
and L-IR groups, respectively, as well as a more pronounced
NRs prevalence of 30 and 45% for decreased diastolic blood
pressure in the H-IR and L-IR groups, respectively (Table 3).
Because none of the intervention groups were diagnosed
with hypertension, we hypothesized that genetic together with
environmental factors, such as time of intervention, mode
of training, and non-hypertensive baseline profiles, may be
responsible for these results. However, these results were more
positive after 10 weeks of HIIT than the 60% NRs prevalence
observed in the aforementioned study following 5 months of
intervention. Thus, the volume of training does not appear
to play a role in NRs prevalence for decreases in systolic or
diastolic blood pressure. Evidence has shown the benefit in terms
of decreased systolic blood pressure after HIIT interventions
(Ciolac, 2012); however, in this non-hypertensive cohort, we did
not observe significant training-induced changes in systolic or

diastolic blood pressure (Table 2). In other studies, there was an
∼60% NRs prevalence for decreased systolic or diastolic blood
pressure after 6 weeks (Higgins et al., 2015) or 6 months (Moker
et al., 2014) of HIIT. Interestingly, a study that explored the
magnitude of the changes in blood pressure after an acute exercise
session reported that this response can be used as a predictive
factor for decreases in blood pressure after long-term exercise
training (Hecksteden et al., 2013a).
In this study, we found significant training-induced changes
in 1RMLE-test results in the H-IR (+12.9%) and L-IR (+14.7%)
groups (Table 2). Similarly, we found a 10% NRs prevalence
for an increase in 1RMLE results in the H-IR group and no
NRs (0%) in the L-IR group (Table 3). However, in previous
studies, RT (10–15 repetitions, four sets of leg extension, 60–80%
of the one-maximum repetition value) resulted in a minimum
NRs prevalence of ∼1% for an increase in 1RMLE after 12 and
24 weeks of RT (Churchward-Venne et al., 2015). Additionally,
despite the fact that our HIIT mode of training is very different
methodologically than what was reported in previous studies,
the HIIT protocol was able to increase the strength of the lower
limbs. These findings are consistent with a previous HIIT-based
study (90 s, 6 bouts, 6 weeks), in which HIIT improved several
parameters related to power cycling in the lower limbs in adult
men (Ziemann et al., 2011).
We observed different ranges of NRs prevalence for other
anthropometric (5–30%), blood pressure (55–100%), metabolic
(25–95%), and performance (0–35%) variables. These results are
consistent with literature reports for blood pressure (59–60%)
(Moker et al., 2014), metabolic (7–44%) (Boulé et al., 2005; Yates
et al., 2013; Winett et al., 2014; Osler et al., 2015; Stephens
et al., 2015), and performance (1%) variables (Churchward-
Venne et al., 2015). Finally, our study has some important
limitations. Our sample size was limited, but it is similar to
the sample sizes used in other exercise training studies (∼10–
20 subjects). Additionally, we lacked a true no-exercise control
group, and we did not control the physical activity patterns and
diet of subjects after training, although subjects were reminded
each week to maintain their baseline patterns of activity and food
consumption. The strengths of this study were that we included
both the effects of HIIT and NRs prevalences for changes in
anthropometric, cardiovascular, and metabolic risk factors and
in performance variables. We also included a statistical estimate
of the ES for each variable studied.
