Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Hearing loss in the US adult population is linked to hospitalization, poorer self-
reported health, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use. As iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a 
common and easily correctable condition, further understanding the association between IDA and 
all types of hearing loss in a population of United States adults may help open new possibilities for 
early identification and appropriate treatment.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the association between sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and 
conductive hearing loss (CHL) and IDA in adults aged 21–90 years in the United States.
DESIGN—The prevalence of IDA and hearing loss (ICD-9 codes 389.1 (SNHL), 389.0 
(conductive hearing loss), and 389 (combined hearing loss)) were identified in this retrospective 
cohort study. IDA was determined by low hemoglobin and ferritin levels for age and sex. 
Associations between hearing loss and IDA were evaluated using Chi squared test. Logistic 
regression modeled the risk of hearing loss among those with IDA.
SETTING—Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA.
PARTICIPANTS—Adults 21–90 years of age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Hearing loss

 RESULTS—Out of 305,339 patients in the study population, there was a 1.6% (n=4,807) 
prevalence of hearing loss and 0.8% (n=2,274) prevalence of IDA. Both SNHL and presence of 
combined hearing loss was significantly associated with IDA. Logistic regression confirmed 
increased odds of SNHL (adjusted OR 1.82 [95% CI 1.18–2.66]) and combined hearing loss 
(adjusted OR 2.41 [95% CI 1.90–3.01]) among adults with IDA, after adjusting for sex.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—IDA was associated with SNHL and combined hearing 
loss in a population of adult patients. Further research is needed to better understand the potential 
links between IDA and hearing loss, and whether screening and treatment of IDA in adults could 
have clinical implications in patients with hearing loss.
In 2014, about 15% of adults reported difficulty hearing, with the highest prevalence among 
white men.1 Hearing loss increases with each decade of life, affecting 40–66% of adults 
older than 65 years-old and 80% of those older than 85 years-.2,3 Risk factors for earlier 
onset of adult hearing loss include hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use.3,4 Sudden 
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is characterized by a rapid deterioration in hearing 
function that occurs in less than a 72-hour period. The etiology is unknown, but a recent 
study by Chung et al. found a significant association between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) 
and sudden SNHL [OR: 1.34 (95% CI: 1.11–1.61), p<0.01], which was most prominent in 
patients under 60 years-old.5 IDA is a subset of anemia in which patients exhibit low 
hemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum iron, and increased soluble transferrin receptor. In United 
States adults, IDA is usually a result of blood loss, and usually responds well to reversal of 
the source of blood loss and oral iron supplementation.6
While the role of iron on the inner ear has not been clearly established, blood supply to this 
area is highly sensitive to ischemic damage. Sudden SNHL may have a vascular etiology 
potentially exacerbated by IDA as described in a rat model of iron deficiency and sudden 
SNHL. This study identified defects in the cochlea, including strial atrophy7 and reduced 
spiral ganglion cells with effects on the stereocilia of the inner and outer hair cells.7,8 The 
role of iron in the vasculature and nervous system raises the possibility of its association 
with other common types of adult hearing loss beyond sudden SNHL. As IDA is a common 
and reversible condition, further understanding the association between IDA and all types of 
hearing loss in a population of United States adults may open new possibilities for treatment. 
Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the association between IDA and SNHL, 
conductive hearing loss (CHL), and all hearing loss among a cohort of adult patients 21–90 
years-old. Based on previous reports with sudden SNHL and the mechanical component 
involved in CHL, the hypothesis was that IDA would demonstrate a stronger association 
with SNHL compared to CHL.
Methods
Study Population
This study was a retrospective cohort study using data obtained from de-identified electronic 
medical records from the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. The 
study was determined to be exempt by the Pennsylvania State University College of 
Medicine Institutional Review Board. Data was extracted using the National Institutes of 
Schieffer et al.

 Health-supported Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) electronic 
medical records query tool9,10. Patients were included if they were 21–90 years of age with 
at least one outpatient, inpatient, or emergency department visit between January 1, 2011 
and October 1, 2015. Patients with sickle cell disease (identified as at least one ICD-9 code 
for 282.6) were excluded due to previous studies linking sickle cell anemia with hearing 
loss.11–17
Individuals with IDA were identified based on the presence of at least one low serum ferritin 
(<12.0 ng/dl) value and one low serum hemoglobin value between January 1, 2011 and 
October 1, 2015. Low hemoglobin values were defined in a previous National Health and 
Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) III study by an expert panel : males ages 21–49 
years-old <13.7 g/dl, males ages 50–69 years-old <13.3 g/dl, males ≥70 years-old <12.4 
g/dl, females ages 21–69 years old <12.0 g/dl, females ≥70 years-old <11.8 g/dl.18
Patients were identified as having hearing loss if they had at least one encounter associated 
with one of the following spectrum of ICD-9 codes: CHL 389.0, SNHL 389.1, or hearing 
loss 389. Patients meeting these criteria for hearing loss were categorized as CHL, SNHL, or 
combined hearing loss. Combined hearing loss is defined as CHL, SNHL, those with 
combined CHL and SNHL, deafness, and other unspecified hearing loss. Covariates 
included age (21–69 and ≥70 years) and sex (male and female). Hearing loss related ICD 
codes may have been added by a primary care provider, otolaryngologist, or audiologist 
following a visit with a hearing related complaint. Formal audiogram testing would not be 
required in order for a clinician to select one of these codes.
Statistical Analysis
Prevalence of IDA and hearing loss are reported. Chi squared test (two-sided) and odds 
ratios were performed via 2x2 contingency tables. Additionally, multivariate conditional 
logistic regression analysis (adjusted for sex) were performed to obtain adjusted odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals. All statistics were performed using R software (The R Project 
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Demographics
Overall, a total of 305,339 individuals 21–90 years of age were identified in the study 
population. This cohort of subjects was identified as having at least one outpatient, inpatient, 
or emergency department visit at Penn State Hershey Medical Center from 2011–2016. The 
prevalence of IDA was 0.8% (n=2,274). Consistent with published data19, IDA was more 
prevalent in females (prevalence: 1.1%) compared to males (prevalence: 0.3%, p <0.001). 
The prevalence of combined hearing loss was 1.6% (n=4,807) and SNHL (0.7%) was more 
prevalent than CHL (0.2%). IDA was positively associated with both SNHL (p=0.005) and 
presence of combined hearing loss (p<0.0001) (Table 1).

 Association of IDA and Hearing Loss
After adjustment for sex, IDA remained associated with an increased odds of combined 
hearing loss, adjusted OR: 2.41 (95% CI: 1.90–3.01). Similarly, IDA was also associated 
with increased odds of SNHL (adjusted OR: 1.82 [95% CI: 1.18–2.66]) in the adjusted 
analysis (Table 2). Serum ferritin and hemoglobin are not commonly tested unless the 
diagnosis warrants it; to account for this potential underrepresentation of individuals with 
IDA, a sensitivity analysis was performed using an IDA prevalence of 3% for females and 
1% for males. Overall, similar results were seen indicating increased odds of both SNHL 
and combined hearing loss with IDA (data not shown).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates increased odds of hearing loss among adults ages 21–90 with IDA. 
These findings are consistent with another observational study in Taiwan that identified an 
association between IDA and sudden SNHL most prominently in individuals under 60 years-
old.5 Recent studies suggest several potential mechanisms by which IDA may affect hearing 
health; however, it is unknown whether early diagnosis and treatment of IDA could 
positively impact the overall health status of adults with hearing loss.
The cochlea is highly susceptible to ischemic damage since only the labyrinthine artery 
supplies blood to this area.20 IDA has been demonstrated to be a potential risk factor for 
ischemic stroke due to lower hemoglobin levels leading to impaired oxygen carrying 
capacity.21,22 Individuals with vascular disease have been shown to have higher risk for 
developing sudden SNHL.5,23–27 Another potential vascular mechanism linking IDA and 
hearing loss is the increased risk of IDA patients for reactive thrombocytosis.28,29 Iron is a 
regulator of thrombopoiesis and previous associations between blood loss and 
thrombocytosis have been established.30,31 This hypothesis is further substantiated by a case 
report which demonstrated acute SNHL in a patient with marked thrombocytosis reversed 
following plasmapheresis.32 Iron deficiency results in the degradation of lipid saturase and 
desaturase, impairing energy production, and consequently, myelin production.33 Damage to 
the myelin surrounding the auditory nerve impairs conduction velocity resulting in noise-
induced hearing loss34, possibly due changes to sodium channel density.35
This study found an association between IDA and hearing loss. IDA is easily treated with 
several months of oral iron supplementation.6 A study using the NHANES data from 1999–
2002 found that those with healthier dietary habits were able to detect higher frequency 
noises.36 Treatment of IDA will naturally improve anemia and replenish iron stores. IDA is 
associated with a large number of related morbidities (fatigue, reduced work capacity), 
which are also likely to improve with treatment.37–56 Additional studies are needed to 
determine whether there is a link between iron supplementation and hearing status.
There are limitations to this analysis which should be considered. The use of laboratory 
results (i.e., serum ferritin and hemoglobin) increased the specificity of the IDA definition 
our study but reduced the sensitivity. With the wide availability of laboratories not affiliated 
with this institution and with i2b2 unable to include data that is not internal, the prevalence 
of IDA and hearing loss in this study may be falsely reduced. A sensitivity analysis was

 performed to address this limitation. Using an IDA prevalence of 1% for males and 3% for 
females, the same analyses were performed. The data remained significant, indicating that 
although the sensitivity of the analysis is reduced by the current analysis methods, the 
positive association between IDA and HL still remains (data not shown). Additionally, 
identifying whether iron deficiency or anemia alone is associated with hearing loss is unable 
to be accurately performed with this analysis since hemoglobin and serum ferritin are not 
commonly tested in the general population. Therefore, distinguishing between iron 
deficiency, anemia, and IDA would not be definitive.
The prevalence of hearing loss, SNHL and CHL were also lower than has been reported in 
the literature.3 An analysis using NHANES data from 2001–2008 reported a prevalence of 
3.2% (95% CI: 1.4–5.1%) of bilateral and unilateral hearing loss >25 dB among 20–29 year-
olds, increasing with each decade of life with a prevalence of 89.1% (95% CI: 86.1–92.0) for 
those ≥80 years old. In contrast, this was an observational study of health care seeking 
adults; and the results may not be generalizable to the rest of the population.57 Patients with 
hearing loss in this analysis were defined by ICD-9 code, thus there are no diagnostic values 
for comparison. There were likely instances in which hearing loss was not consistently 
coded due to human error during data entry, neglecting to include the ICD-9 code for 
hearing loss in the patients’ chart, or exclusion from the query due to billing prior to January 
2011. Similarly, adjusting for potential risk factors, such as smoking status, is unable to be 
performed in i2b2 due to non-inclusion in the database. Adjusting for other potential risk 
factors, such as diabetes and hypertension is possible with our model but the results would 
be uninterpretable due to the high collinearity between age and these confounding co-
morbidities.
Conclusions
An association exists between IDA in adults and hearing loss. Next steps are to better 
understand this correlation, and whether promptly diagnosing and treating IDA may 
positively impact the overall health status of adults with hearing loss.
