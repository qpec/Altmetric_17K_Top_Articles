ABSTRACT  
Background & Aims: Patients with celiac disease should maintain a gluten-free diet (GFD), 
excluding wheat, rye, and barley. Oats might increase the nutritional value of a GFD, but 
their including is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
evaluate the safety of oats as part of a GFD in patients with celiac disease. 
 
Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and 
EMBASE databases for clinical trials and observational studies of the effects of including 
oats in GFD of patients with celiac disease. The studies reported patients’ symptoms, results 
from serology tests, and findings from histologic analyses. We used the GRADE approach to 
assess the quality of evidence. 
 
Results: We identified 433 studies; 28 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 6 were 
randomized and 2 were not-randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 661 patients—
the remaining studies were observational. All randomized controlled trials used 
pure/uncontaminated oats. Oat consumption for 12 months did not affect symptoms 
(standardized mean difference: reduction in symptom scores in patients who did and did not 
consumed oats, -0.22; 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.13; P=.22), histologic scores (relative risk for 
histologic findings in patients who consumed oats, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.8; P=.35), 
intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (standardized mean difference: 0.21; 95% CI, reduction of 
1.44 to increase in 1.86), or results from serologic tests. Subgroup analyses of adults vs 
children did not reveal differences. The overall quality of evidence was low. 
 
Conclusions: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found no evidence that addition 
of oats to a GFD affects symptoms, histology, immunity, or serologic features of patients 
with celiac disease. However, there were few studies for many endpoints, as well as limited 
geographic distribution and low quality of evidence. Rigorous double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized controlled trials, using commonly available oats sourced from 
different regions, are needed.

INTRODUCTION 
Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, triggered by gluten and related prolamins in 
genetically susceptible individuals1. CD primarily affects the proximal small intestine, where 
it progressively leads to villous atrophy. The cornerstone of treatment for CD is a gluten‐free 
diet (GFD), which excludes wheat, barley and rye2. This diet enables CD patients to control 
their symptoms and avoid intestinal and extraintestinal complications, including osteoporosis 
with associated increased risk of bone fractures, and development of certain types of cancer 3.  
Celiac patients react adversely if they consume gluten, which is the storage group of proteins 
in certain cereal grains. The protein fractions considered to be the constituents of most 
concern in celiac patients include the alcohol-soluble fractions (prolamins) of wheat 
(gliadins), rye (secalins) and barley (hordeins)4. The prolamine fraction in oats (avenins) is 
structurally different from other prolamin fractions,  and  represents only a small proportion 
of total oats protein5. 
Van de Kamer et al.6 were the first to suggest that oats may be harmful for CD patients. Some 
later studies, however, pointed to a lack of oat toxicity7. While oats are included in the list of 
gluten-free ingredients specified in some countries’ regulations, such as Canada8, the safety 
for CD patients remains controversial. Although GFD containing oats has been reported to 
improve CD symptoms in some studies9, others have detected intraepithelial lymphocytosis10 
and the development of avenin-reactive mucosal T-cells in a small proportion of patients11. 
The general consensus is that pure oats are safe for most patients with CD, however 
contamination with other cereal sources needs to be avoided4.  
Although adherence to GFD is the only available treatment for CD, it does not always ensure 
adequate nutrition. Oats may increase nutritional value3,9, improve palatability, texture, and 
fiber content of the GFD11,12. Indeed, oats contain a higher percentage of protein of superior 
amino acid balance, vitamins and minerals as compared with other cereals13,14. On the other

hand, up to 70% of those with CD experience either voluntary or inadvertently ingest gluten15 
indicating the diet is difficult16. Thus, oats could also improve GFD compliance and quality 
of life, although contamination with prolamins from toxic cereal grains is a concern3,5,9. 
Traditional commercial oats are often contaminated with other gluten-containing grains, 
however oats grown and processed without contamination, or even cleaned of contaminating 
grains, so called pure oats, are available6,17. 
Previous systematic reviews7,18-21 attempted to address these outstanding controversies; 
however, none of them were able to perform a quantitative analysis. Therefore, we performed 
a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis on the symptomatic, serological and 
histological response to dietary oats in patients with CD and DH. 
 
METHODS 
We included studies evaluating the effect of oats in patients with CD or DH on a GFD. For 
CD diagnosis, we used any accepted criteria (duodenal biopsy and/or compatible serology 
and HLA DQ2/8 positivity, where reported). For DH, we considered any criteria reported, 
such as IgA deposits in skin biopsies. Any intervention involving any amount and type of 
oats (pure, non-pure, kilned, unkilned) along with GFD was considered and the control group 
had to receive GFD alone or placebo (negative control) or gluten challenge (positive control). 
Any other type of comparison and non-controlled studies (before and after comparison) were 
included in the review but not considered for quantitative synthesis. We considered the 
following outcomes: improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms (significant decrease in 
gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) score, visual analogue scale (VAS) or other 
questionnaire), improvement or stable CD autoimmunity (no increase in the levels of CD 
specific serology), improvement or stable  duodenal histology (defined by Marsh

classification, villous/crypt ratio, and/or IEL counts), and symptomatic, serological and 
mucosal response to oats during long-term follow-up (>1 year).  
 
Types of studies 
For the systematic review, we included observational studies (cohort or case-control studies) 
or clinical trials (randomized controlled trials, RCTs) up to January 2017. Case reports or 
case series were excluded. Only results from RCTs were pooled in meta-analysis. We 
considered cross-over trials only if the results were available before cross-over, so that the 
study could be evaluated as a parallel group. We considered publications regardless of 
language and publication status. We included published abstracts only if we could obtain 
further details from the investigators. We excluded duplicate studies, or those in which the 
diagnosis of CD was not confirmed by either serology or biopsy. The search strategy is 
outlined in supplementary Table 1. 
 
Selection of studies 
To ensure that we captured all eligible studies, two authors (MIP and NCC) screened the 
titles and abstracts and selected the studies. Obvious duplicate studies were removed at this 
stage. The same reviewers performed the full text screening independently, using the full text 
of articles and translation of foreign language articles, where required. Data were entered into 
an Excel sheet and results were compared. We calculated the agreement at each step (1: title 
and abstract screening, 2: full text screening and 3: data extraction) by using Kappa statistics 
(GraphPad software). Raw agreement was reported in percentage and Kappa as fair 
agreement (k=0.4-0.59), good agreement (0.6-0.74) or excellent agreement (≥0.75). In cases 
of disagreement, a third author (PM) with experience in the topic was consulted for the final 
decision. All these steps were properly documented in a table of excluded studies. The two

reviewers (MIP and NCC) independently extracted the data and a form was developed to 
collect information regarding study design, population, intervention, control intervention and 
outcomes. The form included information on authors, setting (primary, secondary or tertiary 
care), funding source (industry sponsored, grant sponsored, investigator funded), CD activity 
(information 
on 
specific 
serology 
and/or 
biopsy), 
source 
(pure/uncontaminated/ 
contaminated) and quantities of oats consumed, number of patients, and adverse events. 
Patient demographics, treatment, outcomes and adverse events were recorded as a mean and 
standard deviation (SD) for continuous data, or proportions with the outcome of interest for 
dichotomous data. Randomization, concealment, blinding of participants and outcome 
assessors, incomplete outcome data, and evidence of selective reporting were collected in 
order to assess risk of bias. The first author entered the information in RevMan software 
(RevMan 5.3, Cochrane collaboration) for further analysis and the second author checked for 
consistency of data.   
 
Assessment of Risk of bias for included studies  
We used the GRADE system22 to assess the quality of the body of evidence according to 
study design, consistency, directness, imprecision and reporting bias.   
 
Measures of treatment effect 
Total number of participants who did or did not develop the outcome in each arm at each 
time point, and the amount of oats consumed, were collected and reported as the number over 
the total sample population (n/N). Comparison of dichotomous data was reported as a relative 
risk (RR), with an associated 95% confidence interval (CI). For quantitative analysis, we 
performed a meta-analysis using RevMan V5.3. Data were pooled using a random effects 
model. Statistically significant heterogeneity was assessed through the I2 statistic test and the

Chi-squared test. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and larger values denote 
heterogeneity. Significant heterogeneity was considered present when either the I2 value was 
>30%, or the P value for the Chi-squared test was <0.1022. In order to address the most 
important possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis considering the 
effect of oats consumption on CD activity according to age (children vs adults). 
 
RESULTS 
The literature search identified 433 citations, and two additional ones were identified by a 
recursive bibliography search. Three hundred and ninety-five citations remained after 
removing duplicates. From these, 342 were excluded at the title and abstract screening stage, 
and 53 were eligible for full-text screening (Figure 1). A very good inter-reviewer agreement 
was found at the title and abstract screening stage (k= 0.85) and in the full text screening step 
(k= 0.96). After full text review, 25 papers were excluded. The reasons for exclusion are 
detailed in supplementary Table 2. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for qualitative synthesis and data was extracted from them. The studies included in 
the systematic review are summarized in Table 1 and supplementary Table 2. Excluded 
studies are shown in supplementary Table 3. A graphical representation of the summary of 
risk of bias and the risk of bias for individual studies is shown in Figure 2. 
 
Characteristics of included studies 
Of the 28 studies, twelve were clinical trials; six were RCTs (three in children23-25; three in 
adults11,26,27), two non-RCTs,28,29 and four post-hoc analyses from RCTs27,30-32. There were 
also 10 before and after comparison studies5,33-41 and six observational studies. Of the 
observational studies, two involved long-term follow-up of patients exposed or non-exposed 
to oats that had participated in previous RCTs42,43 and four had a cross-sectional design12,44-46.

Further details on geographical distribution and sample size are described in Table 1 and 
supplementary Table 2.  
No study compared the effect of regular versus pure/uncontaminated oats on the outcomes 
assessed. Five of the 28 studies failed to report whether oats were from a contaminated or 
uncontaminated source29,42,43,45,46. However, only one of them46 showed increased IELs in a 
proportion of patients after oats consumption. The effect of oats over 1 year was assessed by 
14 studies11,12,23,25-27,30-46,34,40,44. Six studies25,11,26,30,41,45 evaluated the impact of oats on 
symptoms, 12 on serological and histological responses. 
 
The effect of oats on gastrointestinal symptoms 
Twelve papers evaluated the effect of GFD plus oats on gastrointestinal symptoms. Three 
RCTs11,24,26 involving 168 patients, reported symptomatic responses to GFD plus oats, 
compared with GFD alone. Two studies11,24 used GSRS scores, and the other26 a VAS. In a 
double-blind placebo-controlled trial, Gatti et al.24 found a significant decrease in 
gastrointestinal symptoms in both groups after 6 months, however, the results were published 
while the study was still blinded. Therefore, we excluded this study from the meta-analysis. 
The meta-analysis was based on only two studies in adult patients with CD that reported no 
symptomatic differences after 12 months of GFD with or without oats12,21 (SMD: -0.22; 95% 
CI -0.56 to 0.13; p=0.22) (Figure 3a). 
Two RCTs compared GFD with oats with other positive control (i.e gluten free diet or 
another type of oat). The first study.25 assessed the symptomatic response to a challenge with 
gluten-free oats versus a “gluten challenge” that allowed the consumption of wheat, rye and 
barley in children with CD on a strict GFD. In the oat-challenged group, 4 out of 10 patients 
had symptoms that resolved while continuing the consumption of oats and none of whom 
showed signs of CD activity. In the gluten-challenged group, 4 out of 10 patients developed

abdominal symptoms coincident with small bowel histological deterioration. All of the 
patients included became asymptomatic during an oat-containing GFD25. In the second study, 
Kemppanien et al.27 randomized patients to GFD plus kilned or GFD plus unkilned oats, and 
found no difference in symptoms between the groups (RR: 1.88; 95% CI: 0.57-6.19; p=0.30).   
Of the remaining 7 studies, six were small, and before and after comparison trials, five in 
adults5,35,38-40 and one in children37, and one had a cross-sectional design 45. None of them 
demonstrated CD activity after oat consumption. Further study characteristics are 
summarized in Table 1 and supplementary Table 2.  
Overall the quality of evidence for the effect of oats on gastrointestinal symptoms was very 
low. There were two RCTs, involving 131 patients, that were at high risk of performance and 
detection bias and one study was at high risk of attrition bias. We detected serious risk of 
indirectness, as the effect estimates were in both directions and had large CIs. Therefore, we 
have very little confidence in the effect estimate, and the true effect is likely to be 
substantially different from the estimate of effect. Summary of findings are shown in Table 2. 
 
The effect of oats on duodenal histology 
Villous atrophy:  
Seventeen studies evaluated the histological response to oats in patients with CD. Of these, 
five were RCTs, two of which were conducted in children23,25 and three in adult 
patients11,26,27. Three out of five RCTs compared GFD with and without oats11,26,27, one 
compared a challenge with oats versus a gluten challenge in patients on a GFD25, and one 
investigated GFD with kilned and unkilned oats27. Two of the studies reported histological 
lesion graded according to Marsh classification23,27, two as villous/crypt (V/C) ratios11,25 and 
one as histopathological grade index26. Two out of five studies11,26 reported histological 
response as a continuous measurement in adult patients with CD treated with GFD plus 50g

of oats/day versus GFD without oats, for 12 months. One of these studies11 reported no 
difference in villous structure between the groups (mean for intervention versus control 2.5 
and 2.4 respectively; P=NS), although a SD was not provided. The authors were contacted, 
however the information was not provided, therefore this study was not included in the meta-
analysis. Data were therefore available from one paper21, which reported no change in 
histological index in patients with CD treated with GFD with/without oats after 12 months 
(MD: -0.0; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; p: 0.92; Figure 3b). 
Three out of the five RCTs11,23,27 reported on the proportion of patients with either 
histological improvement or no deterioration as a dichotomous outcome. Hogberg et al.23 
compared the histological response during GFD with/without pure oats for 12 months in 116 
children with CD. A similar proportion of patients in both groups had histological remission 
(Marsh) (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.01-4.81; p=0.35). Kemppanen et al.27 compared the histological 
response to GFD plus kilned vs unkilned oats after 12 months, and found no differences in 
the proportion of patients with histological remission, according to Marsh criteria, after 
treatment (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.12-3.24; p=0.58). Holm et al.25 compared the effect of a 
challenge with gluten-free oats versus a gluten challenge on histological remission. The 
response was significantly different, as all patients challenged with oats, but none of the 
patients challenged with gluten, maintained histological remission after the study period (RR 
0.04; 95%CI 0-0.66; p=0.02). 
Of the 12 remaining studies, seven were before and after comparison trials, six in adults33-
36,38,39 and one in children37. One was a non-RCT28, two were cross sectional studies45,46, and 
two were post hoc analyses of RCTs31,32. None of them showed CD activation after oats. The 
characteristics of these studies are summarized in Table 1 and supplementary Table 2. 
The quality of evidence for the effect of oats on histology was low, and was downgraded due 
to the fact that the only study included was not blinded, and had high dropout rates, and was

12
therefore at high risk of attrition bias (Table 2). There was also some imprecision detected, as 
the study was small and had large CIs. 
 
 
Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts: 
Thirteen studies evaluated changes in IELs in response to oat consumption. Of them, three 
RCTs (two in adults11,26; one in children23) assessed changes in IELs after moderate 
consumption of oats for 1 year. A meta-analysis was performed on these studies. There were 
no differences in IEL counts in patients with CD on a GFD consuming, compared with those 
not consuming, oats (overall SMD 0.1; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.35; Figure 3c). One RCT25 
assessed histological response to oat challenge compared with challenge with wheat, rye and 
barley (“gluten challenge”) in children with CD. After 2 years, IEL density decreased in the 
oat-challenged group, but increased in the gluten-challenged group.  
In the 10 remaining studies, there were three post-hoc analyses from RCTs 30-32; four before 
and after comparisons (three in adults33,35,40; one in children37), one non-RCT study28, one 
cross sectional45 and one cohort study46 evaluating the effect of GFD plus oats in CD 
patients. The amount of oats and the length of the study period differed between studies. 
Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and supplementary Table 2. 
The quality of evidence on the effect of oats on IEL counts was rated as low due to high risk 
of attrition bias in one study, and imprecision and indirectness in both studies. Therefore, we 
are moderately confident in the effect estimate and the true effect is likely to be close to the 
estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.  
 
The effect of oats on CD serology 
Four RCTs assessed the effect of oats on tTGA (three in children23-25; one in adults11). Two 
studies, one performed in adults in remission11 and the other in newly diagnosed children23, 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

13
compared GFD with pure oats and GFD without oats, for 12 months. There was no 
significant difference in tTGA between the groups (RR 1.71; 95% CI 0.62-4.71; p=0.89). 
One double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing GFD with and without oats reported 
that tTGA was measured, but no actual values were shown24.  
Four RCTs assessed the effect of oats on EmA (two in children23,25; two in adults 11,42). 
Two11,23 out of the four studies compared the effect of a GFD with and without oats. There 
was no significant difference in EmA between the groups (RR 1.45; 95% CI 0.77-2.74; 
p=0.25; Figure 3d).  
One RCT20 compared the effect of challenge with oats with a gluten challenge. The results 
were in favor of oats, as tTGA and EmA were normal in all patients after oat challenge and 
elevated in all patients after gluten challenge (RR 0.04; 95% CI: 0-0.57 p=0.02), (RR 0.11; 
95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.005). 
Three RCTs assessed the effect of oats on AGA IgA (two in children23,25; one in adults30). 
Two studies23,30 compared the effect of a GFD with and without oats for 12 months. Hogberg 
et al.23 evaluated the effect of GFD with a median of 25g of pure oats compared with a GFD 
without oats in 116 children. After 3 months of diet, AGA were below the cut-off for the 
majority of children in both groups. Janatuinen et al.30 evaluated the effect of GFD with and 
without oats in 52 adult patients with CD in remission and in 40 newly diagnosed CD 
patients at 12 months. AGA IgA and IgG did not change significantly at any point during the 
study in the oats group compared with the control group. Holm et al. performed a study in 36 
children with either previously diagnosed, or newly detected, CD who were challenged with 
oats or with gluten. Two patients had borderline-positive values after 2 years of oat-
containing GFD.  
Two studies evaluated the effect of GFD with and without oats on anti-avenin antibodies. 
Emanuel et al.47 assessed 32 children with biopsy-proven CD and 10 non-celiac controls.

Both groups were treated with two types of oats: ancient grains or imported oats. Patients 
with CD showed a different immune reaction to avenin proteins compared with controls. 
Guttormsen et al.44 investigated 136 adult CD patients on a GFD, 82 of whom had been 
consuming oats for 6 months or more. All patients had increased levels of IgA against wheat, 
oats and tTG compared with healthy controls, but no significant differences were found in 
IgA against oats between oat- and non-oat consuming patients.  
There were no studies evaluating the effect of GFD with oats on deaminated gliadin peptides 
(DGP) antibodies. Further study details are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. 
The quality of evidence for the effect of oats on serological response was low, and was 
downgraded due to the fact that the outcome assessors were not blinded in one study, but also 
had high dropout rates, and therefore was at high risk of attrition bias. There was also some 
imprecision detected, as the study was small and had large CIs. Summary of findings for each 
individual outcome are shown in Table 2. 
 
The effect of oats on dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) 
Three non-RCT studies in adult patients assessed the effect of oats on DH, all with different 
study design. Reunala et al.28 enrolled 22 CD patients with DH in remission on a GFD. 
Eleven patients were treated with GFD plus 50g of pure oats, and 11 without oats, for 6 
months. There was no difference in terms of the recurrence of skin lesions in DH patients on 
GFD with and without oats after the study period. Kaukinen et al.45 found 13 patients with 
DH in a cross-sectional study; nine were on a GFD with oats (mean 60g/day; purity of oats 
not confirmed) and four on GFD without oats. There was no difference in the recurrence of 
skin lesions in DH patients on GFD with and without oats. Finally, Hardman et al.31 
performed a before and after comparison trial in which 10 patients with DH were treated with 
GFD plus pure oats (mean 62g/day) for 12 weeks. None of the patients reported pruritus,

rash, or recurrence of DH during this period. Further details are shown in Table 1 and 
supplementary Table 2. 
Long-term effect of oats  
No study compared the effect of regular versus pure/uncontaminated oats on any of the 
outcomes assessed. Five of the 28 studies did not report whether oats were from a 
contaminated or uncontaminated source29,42,43,45,46 however, only one of them46 showed 
increased IELs in a proportion of patients after oats consumption. The long-term effect of 
oats over 1 year was assessed by 14 studies11,12, 23,25-27,30-46,34,40,44. Six studies11,25,26,30,41,45 
evaluated the effect of oats on gastrointestinal symptoms and 12 on serological and 
histological responses. There was no change on any of the previous outcomes after long term 
consumption of oats.

DISCUSSION  
There is still uncertainty regarding the effect of oats in CD despite previous reviews7,8,49-52. In 
our updated review of the literature, we found no deterioration in gastrointestinal symptoms 
in CD patients consuming oats for 12 months. Although the evidence on oats and lack of 
symptom induction in adult patients comes from RCTs, the quality was rated as very low. Of 
six small, before and after comparison studies, two reported more frequent gastrointestinal 
symptoms after oats intake5,40. These had limitations due to small sample size, lack of control 
group and unclear assessment of diet compliance. Furthermore, there was no clear association 
between the presence of symptoms and CD activity making it unclear whether symptoms 
were related to mild CD activation or to the increased fiber contained in oats46. 
Studies investigating changes in histological parameters have mostly shown no change or, 
slight improvement in Marsh scores, V/C ratios, and IEL counts. Once more, the quality of 
evidence from RCTs was low, due to attrition bias detected in one of the studies and also 
imprecision in the results. 
There were no RCTs evaluating the effect of oats in DH patients. However, the results of the 
3 non-RCTs suggest that skin manifestations were not worsened after consumption of oats. 
All serologic markers associated with celiac autoimmunity are gluten-dependent, and a rise in 
their values suggests exposure to gluten48. Our review found no difference in the levels of 
tTG, AGA or EmA antibodies in CD patients on GFD with or without oats. However, the 
values were increased after gluten challenge25. The results were confirmed by non-controlled 
studies in both adults and children. Although the RCTs overall suggest that pure oats do not 
trigger immune activation, this should be taken with caution, as the overall quality of 
evidence was low. A position statement by the Canadian Celiac Association4 suggested that 
screening for tTG or EmA may not identify the rare patient who reacts to oats, as these tests 
may not be sufficiently sensitive for detecting ‘mild’ dietary transgressions, especially with 
 MANUSCRIPT

17
short-term challenge. Therefore, a positive tTG or EmA result helps to confirm celiac disease 
activity, but a negative test may not exclude it4. 
Only one RCT involving 60 patients43 evaluated the effect of kilning process. Kilning is an 
industrial heating process performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen 
its shelf life49. Both kilned and unkilned oats were tolerated by CD patients49, however, the 
results will need to be confirmed in future studies.  
There are numerous aspects to consider when comparing studies evaluating the safety of oats, 
such as the compliance with GFD, amount and frequency of oats consumption, as well as the 
cultivars used in the production of pure oats18. This information was often omitted. Similar to 
previous reviews18, we found that the available studies differed in study design, number of 
subjects, time period, and clinical and biological parameters used. Furthermore, there was 
disparity and lack of information regarding the quantity, source and the cultivar(s) of oats18. 
Accuracy of assays measuring oat immunotoxicity was out of the scope of this review but is 
an important area for future research since there is no accepted standard for detection of 
immunoreactive proteins. 
The purity of oats will depend on the country of origin and local regulations. While the 
majority of gluten-free products containing oats have been confirmed safe in countries like 
Finland, and Norway44, regular oats in North America are likely to be contaminated with 
wheat and barley50-54. For this reason, oats used in gluten-free foods should be 
produced/processed under protocols that ensure purity during all phases of production. 
Ensuring safety will depend on reliable testing measures that consistently guarantee less than 
20ppm of gluten17. Recently, oats that have been optically or mechanically  cleaned to 
eliminate other grains have been used to produce gluten-free cereal products for the mass 
market. These are available and have, in some cases, been determined to be gluten-free (<20 
ppm of gluten). None of these oat products have as yet been subjected to clinical studies. All

RCTs published to date investigating the safety of pure oats consumption in CD were 
conducted in Europe, which emphasizes the urgent need for studies in North America and 
other regions of the world where CD is prevalent. Results from studies in Europe using 
locally sourced oats cannot be extrapolated to North America. 
The methodology of our systematic review and meta-analysis, including the search and 
selection of studies, data extraction and final analysis of results, was rigorous. We attempted 
to increase the scope of our review and reducing the risk of biases in all steps of this process. 
We acknowledge that the data are not robust enough to make definitive, evidence-based 
recommendations on the safety of oats for CD patients at this point. In this sense, we endorse 
the recommendations by the North American Society for the Study of Celiac Disease 
NASSCD55 to support the use of pure oats in CD, but to monitor levels of tTGA before and 
after their introduction into the diet. Persistent or recurrent symptoms should prompt an 
assessment that may include an intestinal biopsy17. 
In conclusion, the results of our systematic review evaluating oat safety in adults and children 
with CD are reassuring, and suggest that non-contaminated oats are tolerated by the great 
majority of patients. However, our confidence is limited by the low quality and limited 
geographic distribution of the data. Current evidence suggest that non-contaminated oats can 
be used in patients with CD but there is still a need for more rigorous data from well-
designed RCTs evaluating the effect of pure oats in the short and long-term, in both children 
and adult patients with CD. Ideally, relevant information regarding the source of oats 
including cultivars and amount of oats consumed and compliance to GFD should be 
provided.
