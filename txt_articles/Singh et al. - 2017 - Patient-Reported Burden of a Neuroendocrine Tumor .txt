Patient-Reported Burden of a
Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Diagnosis:
Results From the First Global Survey of
Patients With NETs
abstract
Purpose Despite the considerable impact of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) on patients’ daily lives, the
journey of the patient with a NET has rarely been documented, with published data to date being limited to
small qualitative studies. NETs are heterogeneous malignancies with nonspecific symptomology, leading
to extensive health care use and diagnostic delays that affect survival. A large, international patient survey
was conducted to increase understanding of the experience of the patient with a NET and identify unmet
needs, with the aim of improving disease awareness and care worldwide.
Methods An anonymous, self-reported survey was conducted (online or on paper) from February to May
2014, recruiting patients with NETs from > 12 countries as a collaboration between the International
NeuroendocrineCancer Alliance and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Survey questions captured information on
sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, NET diagnostic experience, disease impact/management,
interaction with medical teams, NET knowledge/awareness, and sources of information. This article
reports the most relevant findings on patient experience with NETs and the impact of NETs on health care
system resources.
Results A total of 1,928 patients with NETs participated. A NET diagnosis had a substantially negative

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse
group of malignancies that arise from neuroendo-
crine cells throughout the body.1-3 Although NETs
are uncommon, incidence rates continue to in-
crease, partly because of greater awareness of the
disease and increased accuracy of diagnosis.3,4
The incidence of NETs in the United States has
increased five-fold over the past 30 years, with five
out of every 100,000 people being diagnosed with
NETs annually.3 Although NET incidence varies
across geographic regions (higher in the Nether-
lands [4.9 per 100,000]4 and Canada [5.86 per
100,000]5; lower in Japan [2.10 per 100,000]6
and Taiwan [1.51 per 100,000]7), an overall trend
toward increasing incidence is evident.4,5,7 This
increasing global incidence, together with the
considerable number of people living with NETs
(estimated prevalence: 35 per 100,000),8 high-
lights the importance of improving awareness of
this disease, increasing accurate diagnosis, and
optimizing disease management.
NETs are generally graded on the basis of mitotic
count and proliferative index.9 NETs can be di-
vided into functional (clinically symptomatic, typ-
ically characterized by the hormones they secrete)
and nonfunctional (silent/nonsecretory, free of
hormone-related symptoms, and generally iden-
tified incidentally) tumors,1,10 although current
evidence indicates that diagnosis and treatment

 strategies should follow the same principles re-
gardless of functional status.11 The symptoms
associated with NETs may be nonspecific or ab-
sent until more advanced stages,1,2,12 often lead-
ing to delays in diagnosis.2,12 Indeed, NET-related
symptoms may persist for long periods (median,
9.2 years) before an accurate diagnosis is made,2
thus potentially placing a substantial burden on
both the patient and the health care system.
Because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms,
there seems to be no clear pathway of care for
patients with NETs; patients may be seen by
multiple specialists and undergo extensive and
repetitivetesting, leadingto varyingandpotentially
conflicting treatment recommendations and con-
tributing to delays in an accurate diagnosis.13 The
resulting psychological and emotional burden
may at least partially contribute to the reported
worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) out-
comes among patients with NETs compared with
the general population.14
Despite the considerable impact of this disease on
patients’ daily lives, the journey of the patient with
a NET has rarely been documented, with pub-
lished data being limited to small qualitative
studies.15,16 These studies highlight the lack
of a standard care pathway for patients with NETs
and identify a number of potential challenges,
including difficulty in achieving a NET diagnosis,
limited access to information about NETs and to
NET-specific treatment centers, and inadequate
ongoing support.
Patient experience and patient-reported out-
comes are becoming increasingly important end
points in oncology. The Institute for Healthcare
Improvement has introduced an initiative, called
the Triple Aim, to help address insufficiencies in
health care and thus optimize health care system
performance. These linked goals are to improve
the patient experience of care, improve the health
of populations, and reduce the per capita cost of
health care.17 It is believed that these goals must
be addressed simultaneously to achieve health
care reform, and one facet of this effort is to em-
power individuals and their families in the context
of their health care.17 As oncology care moves
toward a more patient-centered care focus, it is
important that clinicians understand the experi-
ence of NETs from the perspective of the patient.
The International Neuroendocrine Cancer Alliance
(INCA) consists of a network of 18 independent
charitable organizations and patient groups for
individuals with NETs from 15 countries around
the world. INCA, which aims to be the global voice
in support of people living with NETs, collaborated
with Novartis Pharmaceuticals to conduct the first
global survey to gather data about the experience
of patients with NETs from multiple countries. To
our knowledge, this has been the first endeavor to
collect information on the patient experience with
NETs. The aim of this patient-reported survey was
to increase understanding of the views and expe-
riences of patients with NETs, including their
needs and challenges with regard to diagnosis,
management of NETs, interactions with medical
teams, knowledge and awareness levels of the
disease, and information sources.
The findings of this survey expand the knowledge
base regarding NETs from a patient perspective,
with the goal of improving disease awareness
and patient care. Collecting and reporting such
patient-centered data, in addition to directing im-
provements in patient experience and care prac-
tice,canhaveoverarchingbeneficialeffectsonthe
health care system as a whole.18
In this publication, we present findings most rel-
evant to the impact of NETs on patients’ daily lives
and on the health care system, and highlight un-
met needs from the patient perspective.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
Patients were primarily recruited online via the use
of flyers, Web site postings, e-mails, and social media
channels of the INCA member organizations/patient
advocacy groups. For transparency, the Novartis
logo was clearly displayed on all survey materials to
indicate that Novartis was involved in the survey,
and all materials stated that the sponsoring com-
pany or the INCA patient group partners may use
the data for disease awareness purposes.
Survey Details
Survey domains and key questions were initially
generated at a roundtable meeting of the INCA
leadership held during the 10th annual Euro-
pean Neuroendocrine Tumor Society confer-
ence in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2013. Hall &
Partners, a research organization, was used to
construct a detailed survey to assess patients’ ex-
periences with NETs on the basis of the meeting
discussions and a review of the NET literature.
Fourteen NET patient health consumer groups
within INCA had direct input into question devel-
opment, and the final questionnaire was reviewed
and edited by all members of INCA and by Novartis
between May and October 2013. This anonymous
survey was developed to be primarily conducted
online, with an approximate time for completion of
44 Volume 3, Issue 1, February 2017

 25 minutes on the basis of length. Paper surveys
were also generated and distributed via patient
advocacy groups and health care professionals
(HCPs) to reach patients without Internet access.
Both the online and paper surveys were available
in eight languages: Bulgarian, Dutch, English,
French, German, Japanese, Norwegian,andsim-
plified Chinese. Hall & Partners fielded the survey
from February to May 2014 and analyzed the
results.
Patient-reported data on sociodemographic infor-
mation (eg, age, sex, educational background),
clinical characteristics (eg, NET type, years since
diagnosis, functional status, tumor grade), burden
of NETs on daily life and work, desired improve-
ments, and information sources were collected. In
this survey, data were purposefully self-reported to
maximally reflect the patient’s voice. The ques-
tionnaire covered patients’ overall awareness of
NETs, the diagnostic experience throughout their
disease course, burden of disease, ongoing man-
agement, interactions with health care providers,
experiencewithandaccesstoNETtreatments,and
resources used for education about NETs. Ques-
tions were categorized as follows: initial screening,
patient’s current status, diagnosis, quality of life,
NETmanagement,NETtreatment,NETeducation,
and demographics (the full survey appears in the
Data Supplement). With the exception of certain
questions designed to gather numerical informa-
tion, survey questions were closed ended; partic-
ipantswere provided optionsfromwhichtochoose.
When patients were asked to rate a particular
parameter,responsesincludedthegradeddescrip-
tors not at all, somewhat, very, and extremely, and
when asked the degree to which they (dis)agreed
with a particular statement, the descriptors strongly
and somewhat were added to response choices.
Data Analyses
Global data were analyzed using the MERLIN
(Merlinco, London, UK) survey software package.
Survey responses were summarized using de-
scriptive statistics, including means, medians,
and percentages. Statistical significance is shown
at a 95% CI level (P , .05). In some instances,
responses are presented as the top two responses
(eg, somewhat agree/strongly agree; a moderate
amount/a lot).

 online sources (51%). These patients were re-
cruited from . 12 countries in the Americas
(United States [n = 758], Canada [n = 164], and
other countries in North, Central, and South Amer-
ica [n = 6]), Asia (Japan [n = 81], Singapore, and
other countries in Asia [n = 18]), Europe (Germany
[n = 311], United Kingdom [n = 156], France [n =
117], Norway [n = 54], Belgium [n = 29], Bulgaria
[n = 18], and other countries in Europe [n = 78]),
and Oceania (n = 138). The exact number of
countries could not be determined because some
respondents identified the general region in which
they lived rather than a specific country. Overall,
themajorityofrespondentswerefromNorthAmer-
ica (n = 922; 48%) and Europe (n = 763; 40%).
Patient-reported sociodemographic parameters
and clinical characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The mean age was 56.8 years, and 64%
were women. Close to half of the patients (45%)
had a bachelor’s degree or higher, and two-thirds
had a caregiver (ie, a close family member or friend
to help them manage day-to-day NET-associated
activities).Only39%ofpatientswerecurrentlywork-
ing (full-/part-time employment or self-employed)
and 18% had a self-identified medical disability
(not further specified). GI NETs were the most
common NET type (54%), followed by pancreatic
NETs (22%) and lung NETs (12%). Of the patients
who knew their functional status (n = 1,551), 55%
reported having functional disease. Of those who
knew their tumor grade (n = 1,242), 91% reported
havinggrade1or2tumors;35%ofallpatientseither
did not know or had not been told their tumor grade.
Diagnostic Delays and Use of Health Care
Resources
Mean patient-reported time from first symptom
onset todiagnosis was 52months;29%of patients
required > 5 years for a NET diagnosis, and 58%
ofpatientshadmetastasesatthetimeofdiagnosis.
Patients saw a mean of 6.2 HCPs across a mean of
11.8 doctor visits in the period of first onset of
symptoms before receiving their NET diagnosis
(Figs 1A and 1B).
On average, approximately three HCPs were in-
volvedintheongoingmanagementofpatientswith
NETs, with oncologists/hematologists (70%) and
general practitioners (58%) seen most often after
diagnosis. Annually, patients reported having a
mean of 5.5 NET-related tests, with 28% receiving
tests six or more times per year after diagnosis.
Impact of NETs on Patients’ Personal and Work
Lives
Living with NETs seemed to have a considerable
impact on patients’ personal and work lives. Al-
though on a scale of 1 to 6 (1 = very poor health,
6 = excellent health), patients reported a mean
health score of 4, a relatively large proportion
(37%) reported very poor to fair health. Patients
reported experiencing numerous ongoing NET-
related symptoms, such as general fatigue/muscle
fatigue/weakness (56%), diarrhea (48%), and
abdominal pain or cramping (41%; Fig 2). Many
of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis.
Most survey participants (71%) reported a mod-
erate to substantial negative impact of NETs on
their daily life, including overall energy levels
(70%), finances (50%), and the ability to perform
everyday household chores (45%) or care for
family (39%; Fig 3A). A large proportion of pa-
tients believed that living with NETs substantially
affected (a moderate amount/a lot) their emo-
tional health (60%), the emotional health of
family/friends (48%), and their relationships with
family/friends (34%/34%).
Most patients (92%) reported making one or more
lifestyle changes as a result of NETs, including
dietary changes (58%), increased time/money
spent on traveling to or from their medical appoint-
ments (52%/51%), and seeing a therapist for
emotional aspects of the disease (20%; Fig 3B).

 NETs had a significant impact on work life. Almost
halfofpatients(49%)reportedtakingdaysofffrom
work, 27% asked their employer to make accom-
modations, and 24% reduced their work hours
because of NETs (Fig 3C). Of the 440 patients not
currently employed or unable to work because of
medical disability, 82% reported having to stop
working as a direct result of their NETs.
Access Issues
Despite the high frequency of physician visits
and medical tests, survey findings revealed nu-
merous unmet needs with regard to NET man-
agement. The majority of patients desired better
availability of a wider range of NET-specific
treatment options (60%) and access to NET
experts or a NET specialist center (56%). Close
to half believed that more knowledgeable NET
medical providers (47%) and a better coordinated/
aligned NET medical team (45%) would improve
NET care (Fig 4). In addition, many patients
lacked access to treatments they know exist
(Table 2). In all cases, the percentage of patients
with knowledge of particular treatment options
was greater than the percentage of patients with
access to those options. Patients also reported
having to travel an extended distance to see their
NET medical providers (mean distance, 126 miles
[median, 25; range, 1 to 9,942; standard deviation,
439.35] or 182 km [median, 40; range, 1 to
9,656; standard deviation, 503.38]).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large, global
study that attempts to characterize the impact
of NETs from the patient perspective. To date,
there is a scarcity of published data on the
experiences and perspectives of patients with
NETs, which may be in part due to the rarity of
this cancer as well as difficulties in collecting
patient-reported data from an international per-
spective. For this survey, the extensive use of
online social media sources through local/
regional advocacy groups enabled recruitment
of a large number of patients with NETs in a
relatively short period of time.
Findings from this survey brought to light the
substantial impact of NETs on patients’ daily
lives, including their physical and emotional
well-being, financial stressors, and impaired
interactions with family and friends. The NET-
related burden resulted in lifestyle changes
and substantial financial strain and had a neg-
ative impact on patients’ ability to work. Although
validated HRQoL assessment tools were not
used in this survey, the findings are consistent
with previously conducted surveys in Norway and
the United States, which reported worse HRQoL

 scores in patients with NETs versus the general
population, as expected.19,20 A previous US sur-
vey of cancer survivors also reported poorer
HRQoL in this group compared with adults with-
out cancer.21
This survey also highlighted numerous unmet
needs for patients with NETs, including the desire
for better access to NET-specific medical teams
(ie, NET experts and specialist centers), as well as
NET-specific treatments and information. A need
for increased awareness of NETs among the med-
ical community was also demonstrated, reflected
by a desire for patients to have better access to
more knowledgeable NET medical providers as
well as a better coordinated NET medical team.
Indeed, the finding that 35% of patients did not
know or had not been told their tumor grade may
reflect a lack of communication between patients
and physicians regarding NETs. These findings
are aligned with results of previous survey-based
oncology studies, particularly with regard to ac-
cess to information about NETs from physicians,
NET-specific treatment centers, and disease-
specific support.15,16 Clearly, there is a need for
better coordination and accessibility of care for
patients with NETs.
It has been established that not only are pa-
tients more likely to be compliant with treatment
if they are actively involved in their own health
care, but also they are more likely to have a better
outcome if they are well informed and assertive
regarding their treatment.18,22 Since 2001,
when a report by the Institute of Medicine pro-
posed that patient-centeredness should be one
of the aims of the US health care system,23
increasing efforts have been made to provide
more patient-centered care, in part by custom-
izing that care according to the individual pa-
tient’s needs and values and placing patients in
control of their own care.24 The findings from
this survey emphasize the need for more stan-
dardized pathways of NET patient care that
address ongoing issues and challenges identi-
fied by patients. Patients often reported a sub-
stantial delay in diagnosis and extensive use of
health care resources (involving large numbers
of HCP visits and numerous tests) and also
voiced the desire for better coordinated care
from medical providers. Lack of these elements
potentially contributes to excessive use of health
care resources, affecting both patients and the
health care system. This scenario is the inverse of
thetripleaimpromotedby theInstitutefor Health-
care Improvement report on patient-centered
care.17,23 Success with patient-centered ap-
proaches to NET care (improved outcomes
and quality of care) are increasingly being
demonstrated in multidisciplinary specialist
centers.25

 recall bias, given the fact that findings are solely
based on patient responses to closed-ended
questions and not confirmed by medical re-
cords. In addition, the survey was qualitative
in nature; standardized, validated HRQoL as-
sessments were not used. Finally, most patients
were recruited online (Web sites, 31%; social
media, 20%) and through patient advocacy
groups (37%). Respondents may have been
more likely to be highly engaged, motivated
care seekers. There was also a preponderance
of female respondents, and nearly half of the
participants (45%; Table 1) had higher educa-
tion levels. As such, the survey population may
not be fully representative of a heterogeneous
NET population. However, comparison of the
disease characteristics (site of origin, func-
tional status, and grade/differentiation) of the
patient population that participated in this sur-
vey to those included in pivotal phase 3 clini-
cal trials on NETs revealed similarities (Data
Supplement).26-32
These limitations notwithstanding, a key strength
of this global patient-reported survey is that find-
ings directly reflect patients’ perspectives on
NETs. Having an understanding of how patients
experience their disease is unique and of signif-
icant value, because it directly aligns with the new
movement in health care toward patient-centered
care.17,23 A concerted effort from clinicians and
HCPs at various levels is needed to effectively
interpret the data and successfully implement
appropriate care processes to bring these im-
provements in the quality of patient-centered care
to fruition.33 Regional and country-specific ana-
lyses of these survey data have also been con-
ducted; INCA is currently working with their local
organizations to use this information to help better
inform NET patient care according to geographic
region.
In conclusion, this large, global patient survey
demonstrates the considerable burden of NETs
with respect to symptoms, impact on work and
