ABSTRACT
Background Labral repair and biceps tenodesis are 
routine operations for superior labrum anterior posterior 
(SLAP) lesion of the shoulder, but evidence of their 
efficacy is lacking. We evaluated the effect of labral 
repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery on SLAP 
lesions.
Methods A double-blind, sham-controlled trial was 
conducted with 118 surgical candidates (mean age 
40 years), with patient history, clinical symptoms and 
MRI arthrography indicating an isolated type II SLAP 
lesion. Patients were randomly assigned to either labral 
repair (n=40), biceps tenodesis (n=39) or sham surgery 
(n=39) if arthroscopy revealed an isolated SLAP II lesion. 
Primary outcomes at 6 and 24 months were clinical 
Rowe score ranging from 0 to 100 (best possible) and 
Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) 
ranging from 0 (best possible) to 2100. Secondary 
outcomes were Oxford Instability Shoulder Score, change 
in main symptoms, EuroQol (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), patient 
satisfaction and complications.
Results There were no significant between-group 
differences at any follow-up in any outcome. Between-
group differences in Rowe scores at 2 years were: biceps 
tenodesis versus labral repair: 1.0 (95% CI −5.4 to 
7.4), p=0.76; biceps tenodesis versus sham surgery: 1.6 
(95% CI −5.0 to 8.1), p=0.64; and labral repair versus 
sham surgery: 0.6 (95% CI −5.9 to 7.0), p=0.86. Similar 
results—no differences between groups—were found 
for WOSI scores. Postoperative stiffness occurred in five 
patients after labral repair and in four patients after 
tenodesis.
Conclusion Neither labral repair nor biceps tenodesis 
had any significant clinical benefit over sham surgery for 
patients with SLAP II lesions in the population studied.

InTRoduCTIon
The superior glenoid labrum of the shoulder is a 
common site of injury and degeneration, which can 
cause both pain and disability.1 2 Snyder et al1 used 
the term SLAP (superior labrum anterior posterior) 
to describe a combined detachment of the long 
head of biceps tendon and the superior labrum 
from the glenoid rim (figure 1). The diagnosis is 
controversial; the validity of clinical tests,3 and 
even arthroscopy and MRI arthrography is ques-
tioned.4–8 In addition, a high prevalence of SLAP 
lesions has been reported in a middle-aged asymp-
tomatic population.9
Labral repair is the most common procedure 
to treat labral tears, but because of high rates of 
complications and poor outcomes,10–17 it has been 
suggested that indications should be narrowed.10–17 
Recent reports show a decrease in the number of 
labral tears performed and a decrease in the age 
of the patients undergoing these operations.18 19 
Release of the biceps tendon (tenodesis or tenotomy) 
is increasingly used as an alternative13 18–22 to SLAP 
repairs in select patients, but the evidence for it is 
weak.13 20–22 One non-controlled study reported 
better results after tenodesis compared with labral 
repair,13 but no randomised trials have compared 
these procedures. Very little evidence about 
non-operative treatment for type II SLAP lesions 
was available when the present study was designed. 
Recent non-controlled studies suggest that non-op-
erative treatment including graded exercise therapy 
is beneficial, and the postoperative rehabilitation 
in the present study followed those rehabilitation 
principles.23–25
Our aim was to conduct a randomised, double-
blind, sham-controlled trial to assess the clinical 
effectiveness of labral repair and biceps tenodesis in 
patients with a type II SLAP lesion.
MATeRIAlS And MeThodS
design
This blinded, three-armed randomised, sham-con-
trolled study with a 2-year follow-up was 
conducted at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital, Oslo, 
Norway, from January 2008 to January 2014. The 
study protocol has been published previously.26 
The patients, the treating physiotherapists/manual 
therapists and the persons collecting and analysing 
the data were blinded to the study group assign-
ments. The first author was not blinded to group 
assignment, but had no role in the follow-up of the 
patients.
Participants
We enrolled patients 18–60 years of age who had 
shoulder pain (>3 
months) that was unresponsive 
to conventional non-operative treatment (phys-
iotherapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
and/or corticosteroid injections) and had a history, 
clinical findings and MRI arthrography indicating a 
SLAP lesion. Patients were informed that final study 
inclusion and randomisation would be performed 
during arthroscopy if an isolated type II SLAP lesion 
was confirmed. Exclusion criteria included previous 
shoulder surgery, SLAP lesions with concomitant

labral cysts,27 clinical and radiological signs of arthritis of the 
acromioclavicular (AC) or glenohumeral joint,28 and tears of 
the rotator cuff or the long head of the biceps tendon. Detailed 
criteria are described in the published study protocol.26
diagnostic arthroscopy
Arthroscopic examination of the shoulder was performed in 
all patients under general anaesthesia, with the use of standard 
posterior and anterior portals. The orthopaedic surgeon (CPS) 
evaluated both the subacromial space and the glenohumeral joint 
and noted the intra-articular findings (figure 1), and a video was 
created for each patient.
Randomisation
Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented 
to take part in the trial were randomised to receive either 
(1) labral repair, (2) biceps tenodesis or (3) sham surgery. An 
independent statistician used the permuted block method of 
randomisation. Concealed allocation was organised by an 
independent secretary who distributed sealed opaque-num-
bered envelopes to the head nurse in the operating room. The 
nurse opened the envelope when a patient was confirmed to 
be eligible by arthroscopic diagnostic evaluation. Following 
confirmation of an isolated type II SLAP lesion, the patient 
was included in the randomisation procedure.
Interventions
A detailed description of each intervention is provided in the 
published protocol.26 A single experienced shoulder surgeon 
performed all arthroscopic evaluations and treatments.
operative and postoperative procedures
During the labral repair, the superior glenoid rim was debrided 
with a motorised shaver, followed by a percutaneous place-
ment of a drill guide and anchors through the myotendinous

junction of the supraspinatus. All anchors were placed poste-
rior to the biceps root, and single circular sutures were used.
The biceps tenodesis was done with a mini-open technique. 
Under arthroscopic vision, a spinal needle was placed as later-
ally as possible and with a 90° angle central in the biceps 
tendon and a tenotomy was performed at the biceps insertion. 
With less than 2 cm skin incision (to mimic the scars in the 
other two groups), the spinal needle was followed down to the 
biceps pulley, the pulley was split and the biceps tendon was 
lifted out. The groove was debrided, a double-loaded metal 
anchor was placed in the inferior part of the groove, and the 
tendon secured with two sutures, each passing twice through 
the tendon. The proximal part of the tendon was excised and 
the wound closed.
For the sham surgery, standard diagnostic shoulder arthros-
copy was performed. In addition, a 5 
mm skin incision was made 
to mimic a labral repair. The patient was kept in the operation 
theatre for the amount of time required to perform an actual 
arthroscopic index shoulder surgery.
All operative procedures were recorded on video. For all 
patients, a sling was placed before they left the operating room, 
and standard postoperative care and instructions were provided.
Postoperative rehabilitation
Patients in all three groups had a standardised, but individu-
ally adjusted rehabilitation. Elbow, wrist, and finger mobilisa-
tion and gentle pendulum exercises were conducted, starting 
on the first day. A sling was used for 3 weeks. Local physio-
therapists, blinded to the allocation of the patient, provided 
treatment after discharge from the hospital. Passive tech-
niques, such as massage and stretching, core stability exer-
cises and general physical training, were used during the first 
3 weeks. Exercises to improve the scapula-humeral rhythm, 
coordination and mobility were performed using sling exer-
cise therapy.29 Gradual biceps loading was started at 12 
weeks. Exercises to improve functional stability and scapula 
muscles were progressively emphasised after 6 weeks. Sports 
and job-specific rehabilitation were provided on an individual 
basis, usually starting 3 months postoperatively. Rehabilitation 
was continued for 3–6 months and included 12–16 sessions 
with a therapist and 20 self-administered exercises.
outcome measures
The two primary outcome measures were the Rowe score30 and 
the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI)31 at 6 
and 24 months after surgery. The 1988 version of the Rowe score 
and the WOSI were validated for use in the present study.32–34 As 
recommended by Rowe, patient satisfaction was assessed sepa-
rately using a self-reported question with response alternatives 
of poor, fair, good and excellent.35
Secondary outcomes were: WOSI and Rowe at 3 and 12 
months, the Oxford Instability Shoulder Score (OISS),36 the 
EuroQol (EQ-5D, EQ-VAS) for generic health-related quality of 
life37 and change of the main symptom (pain) from baseline to 
all follow-ups.38 The EuroQol and OISS are validated for use in 
patients with SLAP lesions.33 34
A single-blinded observer assessed all participants and 
administered questionnaires at baseline and all postoperative 
follow-ups. Patient characteristics were assessed at baseline 
and included self-reported manual labour (yes/no); physical 
activity (1=competitive sports/2= frequent physical activity 
(three to four times a week)/3=occasional or none); domi-
nant shoulder (yes/no); Apprehension test (positive/negative); 
Crank test (positive/negative); and O’Brien test (positive/nega-
tive). Blinding was evaluated by a question asking the patients 
if they thought they were operated or had sham surgery. 
Adverse events were classified as serious if the patient needed 
prolonged inpatient hospital care, hospitalisation or death, 
and considerable if the patient had painful shoulder stiffness 
(capsulitis) with external rotation and forward flexion <30° 
and abduction <90°.39
Sample size and statistical analysis
The study was designed to detect a clinically important detect-
able difference of 10 points in mean Rowe score. To detect 
this difference among treatment groups (SD=15, α=0.05, 
β=0.80, one-way analysis of variance), the study required 36 
patients in each group. Assuming 10% dropout, we planned to 
include 40 patients in each group. In a later study,32 we found 
the minimal clinically important change for Rowe score to be 
17. At 6 months there were no crossovers and the results were 
analysed and interpreted blindly, as recommended by Järvinen 
et al.40
Continuous variables are presented as mean values with 
95% CI and categorical values as numbers and percentages. 
We used a mixed models approach to analyse the effect of the 
interventions on primary and secondary variables at 6 and 24 
months. For each model, we included a core set of adjustment 
variables as covariates: age, sex, time, frequency of physical 
activity, manual labour and dominant arm. In addition, the 
baseline measurement was included as a covariate to eliminate 
regression towards the mean for the estimated changes over 
time of the different treatments and for pairwise comparisons. 
The final model was tested for confounding with the covari-
ates not included in the final main effects model. Confounding

was defined as a change in the estimate of at least 25% when 
a term was added to a model. Finally, we tested for interac-
tions between covariates and all outcomes at the 0.05 level 
only. If a significant difference was found, we applied Tukey’s 
test for multiple comparisons. The assumptions were explored 
using Cook’s distance, covariance ratio and trace statistics to 
assess the validity of the model. To ascertain the robustness of 
findings, we performed a bootstrap regression analysis with 
1000 replications, adjusting for the baseline values and the 
variables mentioned above. Likewise, we performed multiple 
imputation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The 
analysis was performed with the missing data as is and with 
the imputed values. For categorical variables, we applied the 
mixed models with a multinomial distribution. For sensitivity 
analysis, we performed per protocol analysis comparing results 
in those who adhered to the protocol. Post hoc analyses were 
used to compare primary outcome scores at 6 months in those 
who crossed over from sham surgery with scores in a similar 
number of patients with the most inferior scores of patients 
randomised to biceps tenodesis and labral repair. The analyses 
were performed in Statistical Analysis System (SAS, V
.9.4) and 
R V
.3.1.1.
ethics and registration
Ethics approval (IRB00001870) was received from the Ethics 
Committee Health Region Southeast, Oslo, Norway. The 
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. 
They were informed that they might undergo sham surgery 
and that their group assignment could be unblinded after 6 
months if they were not satisfied with their shoulder func-
tion. The study was also registered with  
ClinicalTrials. 
gov 
(NCT00586742).
ReSulTS
Patient characteristics
Of the 445 patients eligible for inclusion, 262 were excluded 
before arthroscopy. Of the 183 patients who had arthroscopy, 
65 were excluded peroperatively (figure 1). A total of 118 
patients were randomised; 39 were assigned to sham surgery, 
39 to biceps tenodesis and 40 to labral repair. The mean age was 
40 years, ranging from 18 to 64. One patient aged 64 years was 
mistakenly included. The baseline characteristics are described 
in table 1.
Four patients were lost to follow-up at 2 years; two in the 
sham group and one in each of the other two groups.
Primary outcomes
There was a significant improvement from baseline to 6 and 
24 months for all three study groups (figure 2 and table 2). 
Age, sex, trauma, manual work, frequency of physical activity, 
duration of pain and dominant shoulder were not significantly 
associated with primary outcomes at follow-up. The only

significant covariates were the baseline Rowe (p<0.001) and 
WOSI (p<0.002) scores.
There were no significant between-group differences in the 
change from baseline to 6 or 24 months in any primary outcome, 
neither for the adjusted nor for the unadjusted results (table 3). 
Unadjusted results were marginally different and imputation did 
not materially change between-group differences.
Secondary and other outcomes
All three groups improved on the secondary outcomes from 
baseline to 6 and 24 months (table 2), and there were no 
significant differences among the groups (table 3). In the sham 
group, 31/37 (84%) patients reported excellent or good results 
at 1-year follow-up, in the labral repair and biceps tenodesis 
groups the numbers were 29/35 (83%) and 34/38 (89%), 
respectively. The first 25 patients did not receive the blinding 
question. After sham surgery, 19/26 (73%) patients believed 
they were repaired, in comparison to 31/32 (97%) after biceps 
tenodesis and 31/35 (89%) after labral repair.
There were no serious adverse events, infections or nerve inju-
ries. Ten patients experienced prolonged postoperative stiffness 
(capsulitis); five after labral repair, four after biceps tenodesis and 
one after sham surgery (due to trauma 3 weeks postoperatively).
Per protocol analysis
There were no significant differences in the changes between 
groups for any primary or secondary outcomes in the per 
protocol analysis. At 6 and 24 months, respectively, the mean

Rowe scores for the three groups were: biceps tenodesis 76.1 
and 87.0; labral repair 76.2 and 85.9; sham surgery 81.4 and 
89.0. The mean WOSI scores were: biceps tenodesis 690 and 
437; labral repair 552 and 339; sham surgery 428 and 338.
Crossovers
Fourteen patients in the sham group were reoperated between 
the 6 and 24 months of follow-up, 12 with labral repair and 2 
with a biceps tenodesis. Six patients in the biceps tenodesis and 
four in the labral repair group were reoperated; two patients 
had capsular release, three had a labral repair and one patient 
had an AC joint resection in the tenodesis group, while three 
biceps tenodesis and one AC joint resection were performed 
in the labral repair group. The mean Rowe and WOSI scores 
at 6 and 24 months in the 14 patients who crossed over from 
the sham group were not significantly different from the 14 
patients with the lowest scores in the labral repair and biceps 
tenodesis groups. At 24 months of follow-up, 8 of the 14 
patients in the crossover group had a Rowe score over 80 and 
7 of them rated the shoulder as good or excellent.
dISCuSSIon
In this three-armed randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled 
trial comparing labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery for 
symptomatic, isolated SLAP II lesions of the shoulder, we found a 
significant improvement in objective and subjective shoulder scores 
for all three groups, but no significant group differences at either 
the 6 or 24 months of follow-up. As there is no previous sham-con-
trolled trial of the clinical effectiveness of shoulder surgery, we 
discuss the results of the present sham surgical trial in the context 
of sham surgical trials in knee patients with knee pain.41 42
Clinically relevant outcome measures
The choice of outcome measures is an important issue. The 
scores used in this study were validated for use on patients

with a SLAP lesion32–34 and capture the most important 
aspects of shoulder function.43 Both the clinician-based and 
the patient-based scores showed comparable results and differ-
ences between groups were much smaller than the different 
scores are able to detect.
Potential limitations
Issues related to sample size, blinding, the population studied and 
external validity are possible limitations of the present study. This 
is a small study, but the CIs of the observed between-group differ-
ences indicate that the study was adequately powered to detect 
clinically relevant differences between the three groups. For Rowe 
scores, the CIs did not include 10, which the trial was designed to 
detect. That only 73% of patients in the sham group believed that 
they had been repaired may have biased the results. Unfortunately, 
data did not provide enough information to calculate a blinding 
index.44 The primary follow-up time of 6 months was selected 
mainly for ethical reasons. Given that the patients were referred for 
surgery and that we hypothesised better results after surgical repair 
compared with sham surgery, it was our opinion that it would be 
unethical to maintain patient blinding much beyond 6 months. 
Therefore, we advised patients that it would take time to recover 
from surgery and informed them that it was our aim to maintain 
the blinding as long as possible. However, if they were not satisfied 
by 6 months, their group assignment could be unblinded.
Our results at 2 years confirm the 6-month results with no 
statistically significant differences between the three groups. 
In addition, the comparison of crossovers with a similar 
number of patients with inferior results in the biceps tenodesis 
and labral repair groups suggests that the threshold for reop-
eration was lower in the sham group. However, it cannot be 
ruled out that the higher rate of reoperation in the sham group 
was related to unblinding rather than to differences in treat-
ment failure. Even though there was no significant difference 
in mean Rowe score in the crossover group after reoperation, 
it is worth noting that 8 of the 14 patients had a Rowe score 
over 80.
We assessed 445 patients and included 118 according to strict 
inclusion criteria. This introduces a risk of selection bias but 
improves the internal validity of the study in order to assess isolated 
SLAP II lesions. Both athletes and patients with work-related inju-
ries were included. Results were adjusted for frequency of physical 
activity and manual labour, but do not apply to a specific popula-
tion. Future studies should compare non-operative and operative 
treatments in athletes, including return to sports in addition to the 
validated outcomes applied in the present study.
The choice of method regarding the biceps tenodesis may 
be questioned. Surgeons currently use several methods, both 
arthroscopic and open, with a variety of fixation devices.45 46 
The point of fixation of the biceps tendon may be in the bicipital 
groove, subpectoral humeral fixation or transferred to the conjoint 
tendon. We fixed the biceps with a mini-open technique using a 
suture anchor low in the bicipital groove. Systematic reviews and 
randomised studies comparing different tenodesis techniques have 
not shown any differences in outcome.45 46
Strengths of this study
The study has several strengths: randomisation; inclusion of a 
sham surgery control; blinded assessments, analysis and inter-
pretation of results; validated outcome measures; no crossovers 
at 6 months; and minimal loss to follow-up. Strict inclusion 
criteria were applied to increase the internal validity for evalu-
ating the efficacy of the surgical procedures. The use of locally 
available physiotherapists and manual therapists for the post-
operative exercise programme of these patients enhances the 
external validity of the study.
The physiotherapy provided to all groups (the sole treatment in 
the sham group) followed current guidelines.47 However, the study 
does not provide information about the effectiveness of physio-
therapy with supervised exercises without diagnostic arthroscopy. 
Ideally, the study should have included an arm with patients not 
receiving any treatment (natural course), or an arm with physio-
therapy without placebo surgery. We discussed this and decided 
that the inclusion of a fourth group would be too difficult to 
implement. Although physiotherapy might have contributed to the 
results in all groups, the impact of placebo, the natural course and 
regression to the mean should not be underestimated.
Clinical implications
The results of our trial extend previous reports12 19 of possible 
overtreatment of SLAP lesions and indicate a need to narrow 
indications. Patient age is debated and authors advocate that 
SLAP repair should be reserved for the young and active 
patient.11 48 There were no significant differences in function, 
patient satisfaction or complications by age in this study, but 
the groups are too small to perform subgroup analysis and 
identify factors associated with failures. The present study 
does not support either labral repair or biceps tenodesis for 
type II SLAP lesions in this population, as we found no signif-
icant difference between treatments in any outcome. Consid-
ering the lack of high-quality trials in this field, the results of 
this study should be interpreted with caution.
Based on this study, we believe future patients should be 
informed about the long recovery and possible complications 
after surgery, and that non-operative treatment has a good prob-
ability of success. Future studies should evaluate non-operative 
treatments and predictors of success.
We conclude that at 6 and 24 months of follow-up, there were 
no significant differences between labral repair, biceps tenodesis 
and sham surgery for patients with a type II SLAP lesion in the 
population studied.
What are the findings?
Labral repair, biceps tenodesis and sham surgery for patients 
with an isolated SLAP II lesion all led to significant improvement 
in both objective and subjective scores. There was no significant 
difference among (1) labral repair, (2) biceps tenodesis and (3) 
sham surgery in the population studied.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Patients should be told that non-operative treatment has a good 
probability of success, but further studies are needed to establish 
what treatment is the best for the young active patient.
