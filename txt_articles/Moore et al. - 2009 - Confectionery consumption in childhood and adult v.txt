 Childhood factors that influence the expression of violence in
adulthood are numerous and include economic, ecological and
individual factors (such as personality traits).1 Diet has been
causally associated with population mortality rates, neurocognitive
deficits, disruptive behaviour, antisocial and aggressive behaviour,
and offending behaviour in a prison population.2–5 Furthermore,
decision biases, such that rewards are subjectively overweighted
and punishment underweighted, are associated with delinquency.6
Confectionery (sweets/chocolates), often used as a quick reward
for children, has also received attention,3,7 although studies have
mostly focused on the short-term effects of diet on behaviour:
the long-term effects have yet to be determined. The objective
of our study was to extend what is currently known about
childhood risk factors for violence by also considering the role
of confectionery. We hypothesise that excessive confectionery
consumption increases the likelihood of violence in adulthood.
Method
Our analysis included data on the births and families of babies
(respondents, hereafter) born in the UK in one particular week
(n = 17 415) derived from the British Cohort Study which began
in 1970. Information was requested on all babies born (alive or
dead) after the 24th week of gestation from 00:01 on Sunday
5th April to 24:00 on Saturday 11th April 1970. It is estimated that
not more than 5% and not less than 2% of all births were missed.
Since 1970 there have been seven data collections designed to
monitor respondents’ health, education, social and economic
circumstances. These additional waves took place when respondents
were aged 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34 and 42 years. We used data from the
age 10 wave when respondents were asked how frequently they
consumed confectionery, and the age 34 wave, when self-report
violent offending data and additional information on socio-
economic status were collected. Additional data were taken from
the age 5 wave that characterised respondents’ early development,
including parenting style. Respondents were coded positive for
perpetration of violence (violence, hereafter) if the most recent
offence, between the age 30 and age 34 surveys, for which they were
found guilty involved violence. Violence data were collected using
a reliable self-report computer-assisted interview methodology.8
Confectionery consumption was reduced to a binary variable
(every day = 1, less often or never = 0) owing to small numbers
in the violence variable. To check the robustness of estimates we
regressed confectionery consumption onto violence and then
incrementally added control variables. With no substantial change
in either the sign or significance of the effect of eating confectionery,
we then sought the most parsimonious model by removing
control
variables
that

no
significant
association.
Numerous control variables were entered into initial models,
including information on: the child’s behaviour at home at age
5 years and maternal circumstances based on the Rutter A Scale
of behavioural deviance (completed by a parent, usually the
mother,
and
designed
to
measure
behaviour-adjustment
problems) and the Malaise Inventory (a 24-item self-completion
scale designed to assess psychiatric morbidity);9 aggression and
impulsivity at age 10 years, assessed by the child’s class teacher;
mental ability at age 5 years, derived from figure drawing and
vocabulary tests, reduced to a single mental ability score using a
procedure described by Batty10 and validated against a health
visitor’s subjective assessment of ability. Forty-three questions
were used to assess parental attitudes in the age 5 wave and
iterated principal factor analysis with an oblique rotation
method11 (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy
0.88) yielded three factors: an authoritarian attitude to parenting,
mothers’ perceptions of their rights, and a parenting style that is
more liberal and affords children greater freedom. Across all
models
the
association
between
eating
confectionery
daily
remained statistically significant. As the binary outcome variable,
violence, is a rare event (0.47%) and the statistical analysis of rare
events (55%) presents problems, particularly for logistic models,12
a rare event logistic model12 with cluster correction on government
office region was the preferred analytic strategy.
Results
Overall, 69% of respondents who were violent by the age of 34
years reported that they ate confectionery nearly every day during
childhood, compared with 42% who were non-violent. Table 1
presents statistics from the final regression model. Tests for
collinearity in independent variables yielded variance inflation
factors less than 1.05. Spearman correlation coefficients suggested
weak (r50.1 and P50.001 for each comparison) positive
associations between being male and not having educational
qualifications after the age of 16; eating confectionery daily and
being male; access to motorised transport at the age of 34 and
being male; parents’ attitudes towards parenting and eating
confectionery daily; access to motorised transport at 34 years;
and living in a rural area at age 34 years. Weak negative
associations between living in a rural area at age 34 years and
eating confectionery daily (r = 70.06), and parents’ attitudes
towards parenting and access to motorised transport at age 34

Confectionery consumption in childhood
and adult violence

Summary
Diet has been associated with behavioural problems,
including aggression, but the long-term effects of childhood
diet on adult violence have not been studied. We tested the
hypothesis that excessive consumption of confectionery at
age 10 years predicts convictions for violence in adulthood
(age 34 years). Data from age 5, 10 and 34 years were used.
Children who ate confectionery daily at age 10 years were
significantly more likely to have been convicted for violence
at age 34 years, a relationship that was robust when
controlling for ecological and individual factors.

Short report
 years (r = 70.03) were also observed. Marginally more substantial
associations were observed between not having educational
qualifications after the age of 16 and eating confectionery daily
(r = 0.11), and parents’ attitudes towards parenting and not
having educational qualifications after the age of 16 (r = 0.12).
The rare events logistic regression model (Table 1) yielded a
significant relationship between eating confectionery at age 10
years and violence at age 34 years. This association was consistent
across all models where ecological, childhood and other controls
were included. Other significant relationships between control
variables and violence included a child’s gender and parents’
attitudes towards parenting. Health visitor screening during
childhood protected against adult violence. Having access to
motorised transport at age 34 years protected against adult
violence, whereas living in a rural area at age 34 years increased
the risk of violence. Attrition and non-response bias mean that
the data available for analysis may not be characteristic of the
larger population, which might affect our conclusions.
Discussion
Analysis of the British Cohort Study has the advantage of a large
sample size and the opportunity to control for numerous potential
confounds. However, as a general population cohort study it was
not designed to specifically examine the nature of diet and how it
might be related to behaviour in the long-term. Exogeneity,
whereby a third unmeasured variable promotes both dietary
choice and violence across the lifespan (e.g. a genetic factor), is
unlikely because dietary choices for 10-year-olds are primarily
governed by their immediate circumstances, in particular their
parents and primary carers, and these factors are already
accounted for in the model presented here. Moreover, self-report
data provide an accurate source of behavioural information8 and
having controlled for numerous control variables suggest that the
relationship between confectionery consumption and violence is
both novel and robust.
Candidate mechanisms linking confectionery consumption to
adult violence must account for enduring changes into adulthood.
One plausible mechanism is that persistently using confectionery
to control childhood behaviour might prevent children from
learning to defer gratification, in turn biasing decision processes
towards more impulsive behaviour, biases that are strongly asso-
ciated with delinquency.6 Furthermore, childhood confectionery
consumption may nurture a taste that is maintained into adult-
hood, exposing adults to the effects of additives often found in
sweetened food,3 the consumption of which may also contribute
towards adult aggression. Moreover, although parental attitudes
were associated with adult violence, the effect of diet was robust
having controlled for these attitudinal variables. Irrespective of
the causal mechanism, which warrants further attention, targeting
resources at improving childhood diet may improve health and
reduce aggression.
