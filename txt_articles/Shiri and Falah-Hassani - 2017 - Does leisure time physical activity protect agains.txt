AbstrAct
background There are plausible mechanisms whereby 
leisure time physical activity may protect against 
low back pain (LBP) but there have been no quality 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the subject.
Objective This review aims to assess the effect of 
leisure time physical activity on non-specific LBP.
Methods Literature searches were conducted in 
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Google 
Scholar databases from their inception through July 
2016. Methodological quality of included studies 
was evaluated. A random-effects meta-analysis was 
performed, and heterogeneity and publication bias were 
assessed.
results Thirty-six prospective cohort studies 
(n=158 475 participants) qualified for meta-analyses. 
Participation in sport or other leisure physical activity 
reduced the risk of frequent or chronic LBP, but not LBP 
for >1 day in the past month or past 6–12 months. Risk 
of frequent/chronic LBP was 11% lower (adjusted risk 
ratio (RR)=0.89, CI 0.82 to 0.97, I2=31%, n=48 520) 
in moderately/highly active individuals, 14% lower 
(RR=0.86, CI 0.79 to 0.94, I2=0%, n=33 032) in 
moderately active individuals and 16% lower (RR=0.84, 
CI 0.75 to 0.93, I2=0%, n=33 032) in highly active 
individuals in comparison with individuals without 
regular physical activity. For LBP in the past 1–12 
months, adjusted RR was 0.98 (CI 0.93 to 1.03, I2=50%, 
n=32 654) for moderate/high level of activity, 0.94 (CI 
0.84 to 1.05, I2=3%, n=8549) for moderate level of 
activity and 1.06 (CI 0.89 to 1.25, I2=53%, n=8554) for 
high level of activity.
conclusions Leisure time physical activity may reduce 
the risk of chronic LBP by 11%–16%. The finding, 
however, should be interpreted cautiously due to 
limitations of the original studies. If this effect size is 
proven in future research, the public health implications 
would be substantial.
IntrOductIOn
Low back pain (LBP) is a major global health 
problem.1 The prevalence of LBP in the past 
 
12  months ranges between 25% and 40%2–5 and 
that of chronic LBP ranges between 4% and 25%.4 6 
Both the prevalence and incidence of LBP increase 
with age.2 6 7 Of lifestyle risk factors, smoking8 9 and 
obesity10 11 are associated with increased risk of LBP 
and clinically verified sciatica. The role of leisure 
time physical activity in LBP is uncertain.
Leisure time physical activity is any bodily 
movement produced by the contraction of skel-
etal muscles that requires energy expenditure, 
such as walking or climbing stairs.12 Exercise is a 
specific form of leisure time physical activity that 
is a purposeful, planned and repetitive activity 
(eg, swimming, cycling or running), often with the 
goal of improving or maintaining physical fitness 
or other health benefits.12 In general, the inten-
sity of leisure physical activity is light to moderate 
and that of exercise is moderate to strenuous.13 To 
date, several systematic reviews of observational 
studies found either no evidence for a relation-
ship between leisure time physical activity and 
LBP14–17 or an increased risk of LBP in active indi-
viduals.18 Some systematic reviews showed no asso-
ciations of leisure time physical activity with new 
episodes of LBP
,15 LBP intensity, disability due to 
LBP or healthcare utilisation for LBP
.16 Moreover, 
a systematic review found no evidence for an asso-
ciation between sedentary lifestyle or prolonged 
sitting during leisure time and LBP
.19 On the other 
hand, another systematic review of observational 
studies found an increased risk of LBP in individ-
uals performing strenuous physical activity during 
their leisure time.18
LBP is a common recurrent condition. There may 
be a reverse causation between leisure time physical 
activity and LBP
. Individuals with LBP may limit their 
leisure time physical activities due to fear of pain.20 
Individuals with LBP may also practice physical 
activities during leisure time due to medical recom-
mendation. Many previous reviews14 16 18 on leisure 
time physical activity combinedboth cross-sectional 
and cohort studies or combinedthe results of studies 
conducted exclusively in patients with LBP with the 
results of studies conducted in individuals without 
LBP
. Cross-sectional studies are more prone to 
reverse causation bias than prospective cohort 
studies.21 In a meta-analysis of prospective cohort 
studies,22 we found that moderate to high level of 
physical activity during leisure time protects against 
the development of lumbar radicular pain, while 
in a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies,22 we 
found an increased prevalence of lumbar radicular 
pain in active individuals compared with inactive 
participants. In the current systematic review and 
meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the effects 
of moderate and high levels of leisure time phys-
ical activity on different types of non-specific LBP
. 
To limit reverse causation bias, we restricted our 
meta-analysis to prospective cohort studies only.

review
search strategy
The PRISMA statement23 was used when developing the review 
protocol and meta-analysis. Comprehensive literature searches 
were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, 
Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases from their incep-
tion through July 2016, using predefined combinations of 
Medical Subject Headings terms (PubMed, see online Supple-
mentary table 1), Emtree terms (Embase) and text words. There 
were no restrictions on language and age or sex of participants. 
The reference lists of included articles were also hand-searched 
for additional reports that might be relevant. The full text of 
studies on body mass index and smoking in relation to LBP were 
also looked at in case they reported results for leisure time phys-
ical activity.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The titles, abstracts and full texts of potentially relevant reports 
were screened to identify studies on the association of leisure 
time physical activity/inactivity with LBP
. Only prospective 
cohort studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if they 
studied the effect of leisure time physical activity on non-spe-
cific LBP and at least some of the participants were free from 
LBP at baseline. We excluded studies on specific low back disor-
ders such as sciatica, spinal stenosis or other spinal pathologies; 
studies that enrolled exclusively patients with LBP; studies on 
back pain combined with neck pain; studies on muscle-strength-
ening exercise and pregnancy-related LBP; and studies that did 
not report quantitative data to estimate a relative risk. The corre-
sponding authors of eight studies24–31 were contacted for addi-
tional results; of them, six26–31 provided us with the new results.
Outcome
Following the outcomes used in the eligible studies, LBP 
outcomes of interest were as follows: LBP in the past month, 
LBP in the past 6–12 months, frequent (recurrent) LBP; chronic 
LBP; sick leave due to LBP and hospitalisation for LBP
. Chronic 
LBP was defined as pain that lasts for 3 
months or longer or pain 
for more than 30 days in the past 12 months.32
exposure
Following the approach of studies that were eligible for inclu-
sion, being physically active was defined as participation in 
a sport or other physical activity during leisure time,33–45 at 
least 1–2 times a week,5 27 29–31 46–50 at least 0.5–1.0 
hour per 
 
week4 51 or being in the middle or upper third of the distribution of 
leisure time physical activity in a study sample.7 26 28 52–55 Moderate 
level of physical activity was defined as participation in such activity 
1–3 times a week,5 29 31 49 1–3 hours per week48 51 or being in the 
middle third of the distribution of leisure time physical activity in a 
study sample.7 26 28 53–55 High level of physical activity was defined 
as participation in leisure time physical activity, ≥ 3–4 
times per 
week,5 29 31 49 56 more than 2–4 
hours per week3 24 35 51 57 or being 
in the upper third of the distribution of such activity in a study 
sample.7 26 28 53–55 We conducted meta-analyses comparing active 
versus inactive, moderate versus low activity, high activity versus 
low activity and high versus low or moderate activity.
Quality assessment
The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed 
independently by both reviewers using criteria adapted from the 
Effective Public Health Practice Project tool.58 We assessed four 
sources of bias: selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias 
and confounding (see online Supplementary table 2). Disagree-
ments between raters were resolved through discussion.
Meta-analysis
From each study, we abstracted maximally adjusted risk esti-
mates for the exposures and outcomes of interest, together with 
their 95% CIs. For the prospective cohort studies that reported 
ORs, we converted ORs into risk ratios (RRs).59 For one study52 
that did not report a CI for the HR, the SE was calculated using 
the following formula: SE=log(HR)/Z value.60
Several studies4 5 38 42 43 48 52 used high or moderate/high level 
of physical activity as a comparison group and explored the 
associations of inactivity versus activity, low versus high and 
moderate versus high level of leisure time physical activity with 
LBP
. An RR for high level of physical activity was calculated by 
inversing the RR for physical inactivity, and an RR for moderate 
level of physical activity by dividing the RR for moderate activity 
by the RR for inactivity. The SE of the estimate for physical 
inactivity was then used to calculate 95% 
CI for high level of 
activity. For moderate level of activity, its own SE was used. SE 
and 95% 
CI were calculated using natural logarithm of lower 
and upper limits of the CI. A reanalysis of data from two31 54 of 
the included studies showed that this approach is valid.
Some studies reported two or more risk estimates for the 
associations of different types of sport activities with LBP
,36 49 50 
two or more risk estimates for the association between physical 
activity and LBP for different follow-up periods24 or the associ-
ation of physical activity with two or more outcomes.42 In these 
studies, some participants contributed data to more than one 
risk estimate. In this case, results were combined by a fixed-ef-
fect meta-analysis to give an overall pooled estimate for physical 
activity versus physical inactivity for the study. Moreover, the 
variance of the pooled estimate was corrected using a method 
suggested for combining multiple outcomes or multiple time-
points within a study.61
A fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to combine the indepen-
dent subgroups of a single study and a random-effects meta-anal-
ysis was used to combine the estimates of different studies.60 The 
presence of heterogeneity across the studies was assessed by the 
I2 statistics.62 An I2 statistic less than 25% indicates small incon-
sistency and more than 50% indicates large inconsistency.63 
Sensitivity analyses were performed with regard to the presence 
or absence of LBP at baseline, age of participants, adjustment for 
confounding factors and other methodological quality of included 
studies. Meta-regression64 was used to explore, whether study-
level covariates accounted for the observed heterogeneity and to 
test for differences in the RR between two or more subgroups. 
The influence of each individual study on the summary estimate 
was examined by repeating the meta-analysis with one study out 
at a time. A funnel plot was used for exploring publication bias, 
and Egger’s regression test was used for examining funnel plot 
asymmetry. Furthermore, the trim and fill method was used to 
adjust for missing studies due to publication bias.65 66 Stata, V
.13, 
was used for the meta-analyses.

Our electronic searches of multiple databases identified 12 
434 
publications (see online Supplementary figure 1). We screened 
the full text of 561 relevant publications on the association 
between physical activity and low back disorders. Of 52 eligible 
studies on LBP
, we excluded five on back pain combined with 
neck pain, seven with insufficient data to estimate an RR, one

that assessed both physical activity and LBP at follow-up, one 
that combined leisure time physical activity with physical activity 
at work, one on muscle-strengthening exercises and, lastly, one

partici-
pants)3–5 7 24 26–31 33–57 67 on relationship between leisure time 
physical activity and LBP qualified for meta-analyses. The coun-
tries with the largest number of included studies comprised 
Finland (n=7), Denmark (n=6), UK (n=4), USA (n=4), Nether-
lands (n=3), Norway (n=3), Australia (n=2) and Israel (n=2). 
Canada, France, Italy, Hong Kong and Thailand provided one 
study each (see online Supplementary table 3).
leisure time physical activity
Of 36 included studies, 26 inquired participation in organ-
ised sport or other leisure time physical activities and 10 
studies7 24 28 31 33 38 41 43 48 67 participation in organised sport 
activities only (see online Supplementary table 3). Only two 
studies26 55 measured physical activity by an accelerometer, and 
only three studies28 52 54 defined the levels of physical activity 
by using a physical activity index or metabolic equivalent of 
task (MET). Seven studies27 29 30 34 41 47 49 defined the levels of 
physical activity based on frequency of weekly physical activity, 
five24 35 43 45 51 defined the levels based on number of hours per 
week, seven3 4 37 39 42 53 57 defined the levels based on number 
of hours and intensity of activity, four5 7 46 48 defined the levels 
based on frequency and duration of activity, one31 defined the 
levels based on frequency and intensity of activity and one56 
defined the levels based on frequency, duration and intensity 
of activity. Moreover, participation in sport or other leisure 
time physical activities was based on a yes/no question in six 
studies,33 36 38 40 44 67 which only one36 considered duration and 
one44 considered intensity of activity.
Methodological quality of included studies
Eight studies were rated as having low risk of selection bias, 19 
studies were rated as having moderate risk and nine were rated 
as having high risk of selection bias (see online Supplementary 
table 3). Nine studies were assessed as having low risk of perfor-
mance bias, 23 were assessed as having moderate risk and four 
were assessed as having high risk of performance bias. Fifteen 
studies were rated as having low risk of attrition bias, 14 were 
rated as having moderate risk and seven were rated as having 
high risk. T
wenty-eight studies controlled their risk estimates for 
some confounding factors such as age, sex and body mass index.
Association between leisure time physical activity and low 
back pain
Low back pain in the past month and low back pain in the past 
6–12 months
Leisure time physical activity was neither associated with LBP 
in the past month (table 1 and figure 1) nor associated with 
LBP in the past 6–12 months (table 1 and figure 2). Compared 
with individuals with no regular physical activity, pooled RR of 
LBP for >1 
day in the past 1–12 months was 0.98 (CI 0.93 to 
1.03, I2=50%, 16 studies, n=32 
654 participants) for physically 
active individuals, 0.94 (CI 0.84 to 1.05, I2=3%, eight studies, 
n=8549) for moderately active individuals and 1.06 (CI 0.89 to 
1.25, I2=53%, nine studies, n=8554) for highly active individ-
uals in a meta-analysis of studies that controlled their risk esti-
mates for some potential confounders (table 2). The association 
of leisure physical activity with LBP in the past 6–12 months did 
not differ between men and women (table 1).
Five studies3 4 24 57 67 on LBP in the past 6–12 months compared 
participants with high level of leisure time physical activity 
with those with low or moderate level of activity. The pooled

RR across these five studies was 1.01 (CI 0.89 to 1.15, I2=7%, 
n=6151, figure 2). Of the five studies, four3 4 57 67 controlled 
their risk estimates for some confounding factors.
Frequent or chronic low back pain
Of two studies46 47 on frequent LBP and seven4 33 34 37 39 51 52 
studies on chronic LBP
, eight studies inquired participation in a 
sport or other leisure time physical activity and one33 participation 
in an organised sport activity only. Three studies4 37 39 defined the 
levels of leisure physical activity based on number of hours per 
week and intensity of activity, two34 47 were based on frequency of 
weekly physical activity, one51 was based on number of hours per 
week, one46 was based on frequency and duration of activity, one52 
was based on a physical activity index and one33 was based on a 
yes/no question. Of two studies on frequent LBP
, one46 defined it as 
experiencing at least 10 times LBP
, while the other study47 did not 
report the frequency of pain. In the latter study,47 however, 61% of 
the participants had pain on a daily or weekly basis.
Participation in a sport or other leisure time physical activity 
was inversely associated with frequent or chronic LBP (table 1 
and figure 3). In a meta-analysis of six studies that controlled 
their risk estimates for some potential confounders, the risk of 
frequent or chronic LBP was lower by 11% (RR=0.89, CI 0.82 
to 0.97, I2=31%, six studies, n=48 
520, table 2) in physically 
active individuals, 14% (RR=0.86, CI 0.79 to 0.94, I2=0%, two

(RR=0.84, CI 0.75 to 0.93, I2=0%, two studies, n=33 
032) in 
highly active individuals in comparison with individuals with no 
regular physical activity. All the six studies controlled the esti-
mates for age, five controlled also for sex and body mass index, 
two controlled for smoking,37 51 one controlled for educational 
level,37 one controlled for job demands,34 one controlled for

social class33 and one controlled for occupation.51 Excluding the 
largest study51 did not change the main results (table 2). The 
associations of moderate and moderate/high levels of physical 
activity with frequent or chronic LBP were statistically signifi-
cant in both men and women, whereas the effect of high level 
of physical activity was statistically significant in men only 
(RR=0.68, CI 0.46 to 0.99 for men, and RR=0.82, CI 0.55 
to 1.20 for women). One39 of the included studies recruited a 
representative sample of twins and conducted a co-twin control 
design to control for environmental and genetic factors. The 
analysis of twins' pairs discordant for high level of physical 
activity at baseline showed a strong protective effect of physical 
activity against chronic LBP (see online Supplementary table 3).
Sick leave and hospitalisation for low back pain
Leisure time physical activity was not associated with sick leave 
or hospitalisation due to LBP
. In both sexes combined, the pooled 
RR of sick leave due to LBP was 0.97 (CI 0.77 to 1.22, I2=0%, 
two studies, n=5106) for active compared with inactive. Pooled 
RR of hospitalisation due to LBP for participation in a sport club 
was 1.04 (CI 0.90 to 1.21) for males, 1.26 (CI 0.73 to 2.17) 
for females and 1.07 (CI 0.84 to 1.35, I2=50%, two studies, 
n=66 
424) for both sexes.
heterogeneity and publication bias
Overall, the level of heterogeneity was low to moderate. Hetero-
geneity across studies on frequent or chronic LBP was explained 
fully by selection bias and adjustment for confounding factors 
(tau-square=0, adjusted R2=100%, I2 residual=0%). The pooled 
RR across four studies33 37 46 51 with low or moderate selection 
bias that controlled their risk estimates for some confounders 
was 0.86 (CI 0.82 to 0.91, I2=0%, n=44 
146) for active versus 
inactive. Heterogeneity across studies on LBP in the past 1–12 
months was partly explained by selection bias.
Egger’s test did not show publication bias for LBP in the past 
1–12 months as well as for frequent or chronic LBP
. For LBP in 
the past 1–12 months, p value for Egger’s test was 0.78 for 20 
studies on active versus inactive (see online Supplementary figure 
2), 0.12 for 12 studies on moderate versus low physical activity 
and 0.89 for 13 studies on high versus low physical activity. The 
trim and fill method did not impute any missing studies due to 
publication bias showing no or harmful effect for leisure time 
physical activity (table 2), whereas it imputed three missing 
studies showing protective effect for moderate level of physical 
activity on LBP in the past 1–12 months (see online Supplemen-
tary figure 3) and the pooled RR reduced to 0.92 (95% CI 0.83 
to 1.02) after adjustment for missing studies. p Value for Egger’s 
test was 0.38 for nine studies on frequent or chronic LBP for 
active versus inactive (see online Supplementary figure 4). The 
trim and fill method, however, imputed three missing studies 
due to publication bias (see online Supplementary figure 4), and 
the pooled RR increased to 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.96) after 
adjustment for publication bias.
sensitivity analysis
An adjustment for funnel plot asymmetry using the trim and fill 
method did not change the pooled estimates for both LBP in the 
past 1–12 months and frequent or chronic LBP (table 2). The 
pooled RR of frequent or chronic LBP for active versus inactive 
was stronger in elderly (70+) than in adults (RR 0.73 vs 0.90, 
table 2). However, all five studies4 33 34 37 51 in adults controlled 
their risk estimates for some confounders, whereas none of the

factor. The studies that did not adjust their risk estimates for 
any confounding factor reported a stronger inverse association 
between physical activity and frequent or chronic LBP than the 
studies that controlled their estimates for some confounders. 
Other methodological quality of the included studies had no 
impact on the pooled estimates (table 2).
Of the six studies on frequent or chronic LBP that controlled 
the estimates for some confounding factors, only two33 51 were 
rated as having low risk of both selection bias and attrition bias. 
The combined RR across these two studies was 0.87 (CI 0.81 
to 0.94, I2=25%, n=39 
210) for active compared with inac-
tive. Both studies controlled the estimate for age, sex and body 
mass index; one33 controlled further for social class and one51 
controlled for occupation and smoking. However, one51 of the 
studies defined the levels of leisure time physical activity based 
on the number of hours spent on physical activity per week, and 
the other one33 was based on a yes/no question only.
dIscussIOn
This meta-analysis suggests that moderate to high level of 
physical activity during leisure time protects against frequent 
or chronic LBP by 11%–16%. However, leisure time physical 
activity is not associated with changes in risk of LBP in the past 
month or in the past 6–12 months.
chronic low back pain
In the current meta-analysis, the studies on chronic LBP
, except 
one, included participants free from chronic LBP at baseline in 
the analysis. The possibility of reverse causation bias is there-
fore less likely. However, individuals may have had LBP before 
entering into the studies. Individuals with a history of frequent 
or chronic LBP are more likely to become less active during their 
leisure time than those without LBP
.20 Furthermore, a history of 
LBP is a strong predictor of future LBP
.34 In line with the current 
review, in a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, we 
found that high level of leisure time physical activity reduces the 
risk of lumbar radicular pain by 16%.22 Physical activity during 
leisure time may have a role in preventing chronic LBP
.
The mechanisms underlying the preventive effect of physical 
activity against chronic LBP are unclear. Physical activity inter-
ventions for LBP are commonly proposed to work by changing 
things like posture and muscle activation. Yet, there is a lack 
of evidence linking the effects of exercise in LBP to changes in 
the musculoskeletal system.68–70 However, changes are seen in 
variables like fear, catastrophising, self-efficacy and beliefs.71 72 
There is now strong evidence that LBP is best understood from 
a biopsychosocial perspective as it can involve combinations of 
different psychological, social, lifestyle and physical factors.73 
Therefore, future research on physical activity interventions for 
LBP should involve measuring an array of biopsychosocial vari-
ables to further our understanding of mechanisms of effect of 
physical activity in this population.
Other types of low back pain
Leisure time physical activity has no preventive effect on LBP for 
≥1 
day in the past month or LBP in the past 6–12 months. LBP 
for a day within a year is a common condition with a prevalence 
of 25%–40% in the general population.2–5 This type of outcome 
is non-specific and can be a part of a healthy lifestyle. We also 
found no association between leisure time physical activity and 
sick leave or hospitalisation due to LBP
. The current meta-analysis 
had low statistical power for sick leave or hospitalisation. There

What this study adds?
 
► Leisure time physical activity has no preventive effect on low 
back pain for >1 day in the past month or past 6–12 months.
 
► Leisure time physical activity may provide modest protection 
against frequent or chronic low back pain.
 
► The protective effect of leisure physical activity on chronic 
low back pain is seen in both men and women as well as in 
both adults and older people.

were only two studies on hospitalisation and two studies on sick 
leave due to LBP
. One49 of these studies was large (n=57 
408), 
but only 1.1% of the study population had been hospitalised for 
LBP during 11 years follow-up. Furthermore, the studies on sick 
leave or hospitalisation looked at different types of sport activ-
ities and did not consider all leisure activities using a physical 
activity index or MET. Of the four studies, one41 defined inac-
tive as practising physical activity <2 
times per week and one43 
as <3 
hours per week. This misclassification can underestimate 
the effect of leisure time physical activity on sick leave or hospi-
talisation due to LBP
.
limitations
The current meta-analysis had some limitations. The included 
studies recruited various population groups. Due to a small number 
of cohort studies conducted in adolescents and elderly people, this 
meta-analysis had a low statistical power to determine whether 
age modifies the association between leisure time physical activity 
and LBP
. In older people, inactivity is more likely to be a conse-
quence of chronic LBP
.17 Our sensitivity analysis, however, showed 
similar association in adults and elderly people. Furthermore, 22% 
of included studies did not control their risk estimates for any 
confounding factor. The pooled estimates, however, changed only 
slightly after excluding the studies that reported unadjusted esti-
mates only. Of studies on frequent or chronic LBP
, only very few 
controlled the estimates for smoking and occupational physical and 
psychosocial risk factors, and none controlled for depression and 
fear avoidance beliefs. Individuals with physically strenuous jobs,74 
smokers74 and those with depression75 are less likely to engage in 
leisure time physical activity than individuals with non-manual 
jobs, never smokers or those without depression. Occupational 
factors,76 smoking8 and depression77 are also risk factors for LBP; 
thus, not adjusting the estimates for these known determinants of 
both leisure time physical activity and LBP may have led to overes-
timation of protective effect of leisure physical activity on frequent 
or chronic LBP
.
The included studies classified the levels of leisure time phys-
ical activity in different ways and used different cutpoints for 
moderate and high levels of leisure time physical activity. Several 
studies classified individuals with 2–3 
hours per week physical 
activity during leisure time as inactive. This type of exposure 
misclassification can lead to underestimation of an association 
between leisure time physical activity and LBP
. We recalculated 
RRs where possible to compare moderate versus low physical 
activity and high versus low physical activity. However, some 
studies allowed classification to active versus inactive only. 
These studies did not, therefore, contribute to meta-analyses 
comparing moderate with low physical activity and high with 
low physical activity.
Only a few studies objectively measured leisure time phys-
ical activity, computed total weekly leisure physical activity or 
considered physical activity during commuting to work. Physical 
activity assessment methods may have a significant impact on 
the association between leisure time physical activity and LBP
. 
To date, there is little information on the selection of an appro-
priate physical activity assessment tool for large epidemiological 
studies.78 However, self-reports of physical activity can overesti-
mate as well as underestimate the levels of physical activity.79 80 
Individuals with LBP may also underestimate or overestimate 
their level of physical activity.80 81 It is therefore unclear whether 
using self-reported measures of physical activity have led to 
underestimation or overestimation of the observed association 
between leisure time physical activity and LBP
.
Implications and recommendations for research
Consistent assessments of both physical activity and LBP across 
studies are needed to understand the effect of physical activity 
on LBP
. In addition to new episodes of LBP
, future prospective 
studies should also explore the effect of leisure time physical 
activity on LBP severity, chronicity and disability. Studies on 
LBP should consider not only all dimensions of physical activity 
(type, frequency, duration and intensity) but also all domains of 
physical activity (leisure time, household, commuting and work). 
The levels of leisure time physical activity should be defined 
based on total weekly moderate-intensity physical activity and 
vigorous-intensity physical activity. Furthermore, future studies 
should control the association between physical activity and LBP 
for all known confounding factors, including age, sex, education, 
social class, smoking, body mass index, occupational physical 
and psychosocial factors, depression and fear avoidance beliefs.
cOnclusIOns
Leisure time physical activity may have a modest protective 
effect on the development of frequent or chronic LBP
. The 
results, however, should be interpreted cautiously due to limita-
tions of the original studies.
