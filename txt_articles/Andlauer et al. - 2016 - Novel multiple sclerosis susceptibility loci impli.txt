We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility in German cohorts
with 4888 cases and 10,395 controls. In addition to associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
region, 15 non-MHC loci reached genome-wide significance. Four of these loci are novel MS susceptibility loci. They
map to the genes L3MBTL3, MAZ, ERG, and SHMT1. The lead variant at SHMT1 was replicated in an independent
Sardinian cohort. Products of the genes L3MBTL3, MAZ, and ERG play important roles in immune cell regulation.
SHMT1 encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of a carbon unit to the folate cycle.
This reaction is required for regulation of methylation homeostasis, which is important for establishment and
maintenance of epigenetic signatures. Our GWAS approach in a defined population with limited genetic substructure
detected associations not found in larger, more heterogeneous cohorts, thus providing new clues regarding MS
pathogenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central ner-
vous system. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, located within
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, have been iden-
tified as major genetic determinants for the disease (1, 2). In addition,
more than 100 non-MHC MS susceptibility variants have been de-
scribed (3, 4). Many of the genes carrying known susceptibility variants
are involved in the regulation of either immune cell differentiation or
signaling (4–8). However, because the heritability of MS is limited (9),
environmental contributions to disease etiology are also important
(10). Environmental influences can alter gene expression via epigenetic
mechanisms (11). Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation or
histone modifications, have been observed in tissues and cells of MS
patients (8, 12–14). Nevertheless, the impact of epigenetic regulation
in MS is not yet understood.The known genetic variants outside the
MHC region have predominantly been established in large international
collaborative studies. To achieve large sample sizes with the power to
detect associations, these studies have combined sample sets from
diverse ethnic populations (4–6). So far, the variants affecting MS
susceptibility identified in these studies account for only 25% of disease
heritability under an additive model of heritability (3), warranting for
additional studies to fully unravel the genetic contribution to disease
susceptibility. In contrast to the previously investigated large interna-
tional cohorts, we have strived to examine the genetic contribution to
MS susceptibility in a more homogeneous population, focusing entirely
on German cases and controls. The genetic substructure among
Germans is low (15). We therefore expected to have sufficient power
to detect novel associations with moderate effect sizes in a data set
showing little population stratification. Using a total of 4888 cases
and 10,395 controls, we had 80% power to detect genome-wide signif-
icant associations with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 involving common
variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 21%. For rare single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (MAF, 1%), the power surpassed
80% for an OR of 1.9.
RESULTS
Genome-wide association analyses
We recruited patients with either MS or clinically isolated syndrome
(CIS) from MS centers throughout Germany and combined them
with controls from several German population–based cohorts (Table 1).
After quality control (QC), the data set DE1 consisted of 3934 cases
and 8455 controls (control/case ratio, 2.15; table S1). We also compiled
a second data set, called DE2, based on an independent group of

Downloaded from 
 German cases previously used in the IMSGC/WTCCC2 (International
Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium/Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium 2) MS study (Table 1) (5), and additional German controls,
mostly from population-based cohorts. The data set DE2 contained
954 cases and 1940 controls after QC (control/case ratio, 2.03; table S2).
We observed only moderate population substructure within these data
sets (figs. S1 and S2), confirming previous genetic analyses of the
German population (15).
Both data sets were imputed separately to the 1000 Genomes Phase
1 reference panel using SHAPEIT2 and IMPUTE2 (16–18). The re-
sulting data sets contained more than 8 million high-quality variants
with MAFs of at least 1% each. We separately conducted genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) on both data sets using sex and the first
eight multidimensional scaling (MDS) components of the genetic simi-
larity matrix (GSM) as covariates, to control for any remaining popu-
lation substructure. After assuring that the median genomic inflation
of the two GWAS was in the expected range (table S3), results were
combined using a fixed-effects pooled analysis. In this pooled analysis,
the genomic inflation l1000,1000 outside the extended MHC region was
1.017 (table S3) (19).
Associations within the MHC region
The variant showing the strongest association in the pooled analysis of
DE1 and DE2, rs3104373 [OR, 2.90; confidence interval (CI), 2.72 to
3.09; P = 1.3 × 10−234], lies within the MHC region between the
genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1. This SNP is in strong linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) with the HLA allele DRB1*15:01 (r2 = 0.99) and thus
corresponds to the established major MS risk locus (1, 2). To confirm
this finding, we imputed classical HLA alleles from our genotyping data
(20). After QC, we obtained high-quality imputed alleles for a total of
3966 cases and 8329 controls from DE1 and DE2 (median accuracy,
96.1%; median call rate, 97.4%). Using stepwise conditional logistic
regression (1, 2, 5), seven HLA alleles (Table 2) reached genome-wide
significance (that is, P < 5 × 10−8). As expected, the most significantly
associated allele was DRB1*15:01 (OR, 2.85; CI, 2.66 to 3.06; P = 1.0 ×
10−191). All seven alleles have been described as associated with MS in
a recent detailed analysis of the MHC region (2).
Previous analyses of the MHC region have also identified associa-
tions between HLA alleles and age at onset of the disease, mainly with
DRB1*15:01 (2, 5). We confirmed this finding in a subset of patients
from our data set DE1. Age at onset was known for 1519 patients; for
1196 of them, imputed HLA alleles were available. Because the age at

 onset was not normally distributed, rank-based inverse normal trans-
formation was applied. The HLA allele most strongly associated with
transformed age at onset was DRB1*15:01 (effect size, −0.21; P = 7.6 ×
10−6). When conducting a genome-wide analysis of transformed age
at onset in all 1519 patients, no variant passed the threshold for
genome-wide significance (fig. S3, A and B). The most strongly asso-
ciated SNP was rs4959027 (effect size, −0.20; P = 1.5 × 10−7; fig. S3,
C and D), which is in LD with DRB1*15:01 (r2 = 0.72). After condi-
tioning for DRB1*15:01 in the subset of cases with both age at onset
and imputed HLA alleles available, the P value of rs4959027 was in-
creased from 1.1 × 10−6 to 4.8 × 10−2. We conclude that our findings
for the MHC region are very well in line with previous studies and con-
centrated further analyses on associations with case/control status
outside this region.
Associations outside the MHC region
Variants at 15 loci outside the MHC region showed genome-wide sig-
nificance (Fig. 1, figs. S4 and S5, Table 3, and table S4). Ten of these
loci have already been established in previous large MS GWAS (3, 4, 6).
One more locus, DLEU1 (deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1), was
only recently confirmed to be associated with MS in a candidate gene
study (21). The remaining four signals are thus novel candidates for
MS susceptibility loci. The lead variants at all 15 non-MHC loci showed
P < 5 × 10−6 in DE1 and lower P < 5 × 10−8 in the pooled analysis of
DE1 and DE2 and have thus replicated in DE2. We could not detect
any significant interaction among the 15 top non-MHC variants or
between them and SNP rs3104373 within the MHC region.
For validation of our findings, we compared our results to the largest
study on MS genetic susceptibility published to date (Fig. 2) (4). Of the
108 non-MHC variants showing genome-wide significant or suggestive
associations with MS in the published study, 104 variants were present
in our data and could be analyzed. All of them showed the same direction
of effect (P = 5 × 10−32, binomial sign test; CI, 0.97 to 1.00), 84 with
nominal (P < 0.05) and 10 with genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8).
Fifty-eight of the variants had lower ORs and 35 had higher ORs in
our data than in the published data set (4). It was expected to observe
more signals with lower ORs than previously reported due to regression
toward the mean.

 Next, we examined the four novel loci and DLEU1 not found at
genome-wide significance in a GWAS before in more detail. We in-
vestigated whether the five lead variants at these loci are significantly
associated with MS in our German cohort only or whether they rep-
licate in Sardinians, a genetically distinct population with low genetic
heterogeneity. This independent Sardinian cohort consisted of 2903 cases
(69.2% female, 1.2% PPMS) and 3323 controls (control/case ratio, 1.15)
(22–24). Two of the variants (rs2812197 and rs4925166) replicated with
P < 0.01 in the Sardinian data set; two more (rs34286592 and rs2836425)
showed the same direction of effect but did not reach nominal signif-
icance (Table 3, table S4, and fig. S6).
SHMT1 as a novel MS susceptibility gene
The association of rs4925166 constituted the strongest signal among
the novel variants. It showed an OR of 0.85 (CI, 0.81 to 0.90) and a
P value of 2.7 × 10−9 in the pooled analysis of German data sets (Table 3).
This variant replicated in the Sardinian cohort with a joint P value of
7.4 × 10−12 (fig. S6D). SNP rs4925166 is located on chromosome 17 in
an intron of the gene TOP3A, coding for the DNA topoisomerase IIIa.
However, strongly associated SNPs in this genomic region spread over
several neighboring genes (Fig. 3A). We therefore conducted an expres-
sion quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using a subset of 242 pa-
tients from data set DE1 to functionally link variants to nearby genes.
We examined transcripts within a cis window of 1 million base pairs
upstream and downstream of the lead variant for an association of
blood gene expression levels with allele configuration (table S5). The
variant rs4925166 and proxy SNPs (r2 > 0.7) were found to be part of
Table 3. Genome-wide significant loci outside the MHC region and the top variant within the MHC region. Bold font in the left half of the
table indicates novel loci, whereas bold font in the right half indicates variants that replicated in Sardinians. All P values shown are two-sided. Gene
names of known loci are as listed by Sawcer et al. (3). C, chromosome. For additional details, see table S4.

Fig. 2. Comparison of results from the pooled analysis of Germans to
associations found in an IMSGC study. One hundred and four of the
108 variants showing genome-wide significant or suggestive associations
with MS in the study published by the IMSGC in 2013 (4) were present in
the pooled results of DE1 and DE2. All 104 variants showed the same
direction of effect (P = 5 × 10−32, binomial sign test). Fifty-eight variants had
lower ORs and 35 higher ORs compared to the published data set. P value–
based categories labeled with different dots represent exclusive bins that

Downloaded from 
 a strong eQTL with the gene SHMT1 in DE1 samples [false discovery rate
(FDR), 2.99 × 10−10; Table 4 and fig. S7, A to C]. This eQTL was replicated
in two independent control data sets [Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry
(MPIP) data (25) and Grady Trauma Project (GTP) (26–28)] and in the
publicly available GTEx eQTL database (29) (Table 4).
To investigate how rs4925166 influences the expression of SHMT1, we
conducted an association analysis of the SNP with DNA methylation
levels in blood. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism
for regulation of gene expression. We tested the association between
rs4925166 and DNA methylation levels at CpG sites in the two non-
MS data sets MPIP and GTP. Methylation levels at 157 CpG sites that
mapped to SHMT1 were examined for an association with genotype.
We observed eight significant (FDR <0.05) methylation QTLs (mQTLs)
between rs4925166andCpGsinSHMT1withintheMPIPdataset.Three
of these associations could be replicated in the GTP data set (table S6
and fig. S7, D and E).
We wondered whether the CpG site showing the strongest associ-
ation with rs4925166 (cg26763362) could fully explain the observed
association between the SNP and SHMT1 expression (causal direction:
rs4925166→cg26763362→SHMT1 expression) using mediation anal-
ysis (Table 4, tables S7 and S8, Fig. 3) (30). We observed partial me-
diation of the effect of rs4925166 on SHMT1 expression by DNA
methylation status of CpG site cg26763362. The association pattern
indicates that an additional factor influences the relationship between
the SNP, the CpG, and the gene expression (see the Supplementary
Materials). Thus, we conclude that the genotype of rs4925166 affects
the expression of SHMT1 in a complex fashion, partially involving
rs4925166-dependent DNA methylation.
Additional novel candidate loci associated with MS
Three loci showed genome-wide significance in the pooled analysis of
German data sets DE1 and DE2 but not in Sardinians (Table 3). The
strongest association, SNP rs4364506, was found on chromosome 6
and is located in an intron of the gene coding for the transcriptional
regulator L3MBTL3 [Lethal(3)malignant brain tumor–like protein 3;
fig. S5G). SNP rs2836425 on chromosome 21 constituted the second
strongest signal identified in Germans only. This variant maps to an
intron of the gene ERG, coding for a transcription factor (fig. S5P). The
third SNP rs34286592 is located in an intron of the gene MAZ on chro-
mosome 16, coding for the transcription factor MYC-associated zinc
finger protein (fig. S5N). It maps to binding sites for transcription
factors (fig. S8G).
When conditioning for the lead variants at the four newly identi-
fied MS-associated loci, no evidence for secondary signals was found.
Thus, the lead variants also constitute the most likely causal variants.
These variants all map to introns of genes. This makes a functional link
between each variant and the gene it is located in probable. To further
explore the functional connections between SNPs and genes, we con-
ducted an eQTL analysis of the 15 loci showing genome-wide signif-
icant associations. We thereby identified four cis-eQTLs with FDR
<0.05 in MS cases (table S5). In addition to the eQTL of rs4925166
and SHMT1 already described above, three more significant eQTLs
involved variants at two previously known MS susceptibility loci
and three transcripts of the genes MMEL1 and ANKRD55.

 DLEU1, have been described previously as associated with MS in three
large studies (4–6), yet the variants did not show genome-wide signif-
icance in any of them. The association of rs806349 has recently been
confirmed in a candidate-driven follow-up analysis of suggestive MS
associations (21). However, the variant rs806349 reached a P value of
only 2.7 × 10−4 in our analysis (Table 5). Instead, a different SNP
(rs2812197) in weak LD with rs806349 (r2 = 0.4) showed genome-wide
significance in the pooled analysis of DE1 and DE2 and also replicated
in Sardinians (Tables 3 and 5, and fig. S5K). The association of previ-
ously described rs806349 is completely dependent on the more strongly
associated rs2812197 (Table 5). Thus, it is unlikely that rs806349 is the
causal SNP at this locus. The same is true for rs806321 (5), which is not
independent of rs2812197 either (Table 5).
The DLEU1 locus contains evidence for a second signal, rs9591325
(Table 5 and fig. S5L), in poor LD with rs2812197, but in high LD
with rs9596270, which was identified by Patsopoulos et al. (6) as a sug-
gestive MS-associated variant. The two signals were partially independent
of each other (Table 5). SNP rs9591325 is located in a clearly function-
al region with binding sites for many transcription factors, which is not
the case for the other four variants (fig. S8, B to F). Although rs2812197
shows the overall strongest association at DLEU1, the functional data
indicate that rs9591325 might be either the actual or a second causal
variant. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to fully
answer this question.
DISCUSSION
The present study constitutes the largest GWAS on MS conducted in a
single population to date. By pooled analysis of 3934 cases in data set
DE1 and 954 cases in data set DE2, we identified strong associations in
the MHC region with a P value of up to 1.3 × 10−234. In addition, 15
loci outside the MHC region were associated at a genome-wide signif-
icant level (Fig. 1 and Table 3). Associations in the MHC region were
examinedusingimputedHLAalleles.Stepwiseconditionallogisticregres-
sion identified DRB1*15:01 and six more associated HLA alleles (Table 2),
in line with results from previous studies (2). All genome-wide significant
and suggestive non-MHC MS susceptibility variants published by the
IMSGC in 2013 (4) and present in our data (n = 104) were replicated
regarding direction of effects in our samples (P = 5 × 10−32; Fig. 2).
Four of the 15 non-MHC loci have not been found to be associated
with MS in previous studies. One more locus, DLEU1, did not reach
genome-wide significance in previous GWAS but has recently been
confirmed as MS-associated in a candidate SNP study (21). The lead
variants at DLEU1 and at the novel locus SHMT1 replicated in an
independent Sardinian cohort containing 2903 cases (Table 3 and
fig. S6). Variants at the other three novel loci did not reach nominal
significance in Sardinians, yet two of them showed the same direction
of effect. Because of their consistency and replication within the German
cohorts, these three associations can nevertheless be considered as
plausible. As the Sardinian population is genetically distinct from
Germans, future studies are required to replicate these findings in
other cohorts.
Previous genetic analyses of MS susceptibility have indicated im-
mune system–related processes as relevant for the development of
MS (4). Functions of known MS susceptibility genes have been
mapped to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathways Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcrip-
tion (JAK/STAT) signaling, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and T cell
receptor signaling (7). Accordingly, MS-associated genes are predom-
inantly expressed in immune cells (7, 8). The five genes examined in
detail in our study (L3MBTL3, DLEU1, MAZ, ERG, and SHMT1) are
associated with regulatory mechanisms in immune cells as well.
The gene L3MBTL3 encodes a Polycomb group protein that main-
tains the transcriptionally repressive state of genes (31) and is frequently
deleted in several forms of acute leukemia, including AML (32). Genes

 associated with AML constitute one of the most significant pathway
categories linked to MS susceptibility variants (7). The murine ortholog
of L3MBTL3, MBT-1, has been found to regulate maturation of myeloid
progenitor cells (33). The regulatory long noncoding RNA DLEU1 is
often deleted in cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle
cell leukemia (34). This locus regulates the expression of NF-kB (35), a
transcription factor implicated in MS pathology (4, 36, 37). MAZ is
an inflammation-responsive transcription factor (38) up-regulated during
chronic myeloid leukemia (39). It binds to the promoter of the gene
MYC, which is associated with MS (5). The transcription factor ERG
is important for hematopoiesis (40), and the expression of this onco-
gene is associated with both AML and acute T cell lymphoblastic
leukemia (41). ERG regulates the expression of MS-associated NF-kB
(42), as DLEU1 does. Finally, SHMT1 is a serine hydroxymethyltrans-
ferase acting in the folate cycle. It catalyzes the transfer of a carbon unit
subsequently used for synthesis of both nucleotides and methionine.
SHMT1 is thus an essential component in the metabolism of the sub-
strate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl group donor
during both protein and DNA methylation (43, 44). By this effect
on regulation of gene expression, one-carbon metabolism plays an
important role in oncogenesis. Lack of SHMT1 function is, among
other effects, associated with acute lymphocytic leukemia (44–46).
Thus, each of the five genes is involved in regulatory processes of the
immune system.
Although a clearer picture has already emerged regarding the cell
types and broad pathways relevant for the etiology of MS (3, 7), little is
still known about the mechanisms by which risk genes act. Analysis of
the known functions of the five genes examined in this study revealed
that four of them regulate transcription, especially of immune-related
genes. Moreover, indirect evidence suggests that they could all be
linked either directly or indirectly to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms:
L3MBTL3 recognizes epigenetic histone lysine methylation (31) and
ERG interacts with ESET, a histone H3–specific methyltransferase (47).
The best known regulatory target of the transcription factor MAZ is
MYC (48), a regulator of epigenetic chromatin state that is associated
with MS (5, 49). DLEU1 is strictly regulated by DNA methylation at
its promoter region (35). Finally, SHMT1 is essential for maintaining
methylation homeostasis in the cell by catalyzing an important reaction
in the generation of the methyl donor substrate SAM. Accordingly,
the establishment of SHMT1 as an MS risk factor further puts epige-
netic regulation by methylation in the focus of MS susceptibility.
In recent years, several studies have addressed the role of DNA
methylation in the etiology and progression of MS. Methylation dif-
ferences between MS cases and healthy controls have been analyzed in
small, cross-sectional studies. Despite negative results in CD4+ cells
(12, 50), Bos and colleagues (12) recently observed significant differ-
ences in overall DNA methylation levels in CD8+ T cells. Another
study demonstrated differentially methylated and expressed genes in
brain tissue of MS patients compared to controls (14). Furthermore,
differential methylation of the major risk locus HLA-DRB1 was ob-
served in MS patients (51). Several groups have found either hyper-
methylation or hypomethylation of specific genes to be associated with
inflammation or demyelination in MS patients (11).
In summary, these studies argue in favor of DNA methylation being
relevant for the development of MS. By finding novel risk genes with
potential roles in epigenetic regulation, our study adds further indica-
tion that epigenetic mechanisms might be important for MS suscep-
tibility. A disturbed homeostasis of methyl donors, caused by an altered
expression of SHMT1, is likely to have an impact on the disease. As
epigenetic mechanisms constitute a major route for environmental risk
factors to influence expression of disease-associated genes (11), regu-
lation of DNA and protein methylation is an interface where genetic
and environmental risk factors for MS might intersect. Detailed analy-
ses of DNA methylation patterns and their interaction with MS sus-
ceptibility genes in larger cohorts and among different cell populations
and tissues are now required to better understand the role of epige-
netic mechanisms in MS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study samples
Two cohorts of cases, referred to as DE1 and DE2, were analyzed.
Both data sets included patients with CIS, bout-onset MS, and PPMS.
For cohort DE1, 4503 cases were recruited across multiple sites in
Germany (for details, see the Supplementary Materials). For cohort
DE2, 1002 cases were recruited across multiple sites in Germany
(see the Supplementary Materials). The latter cohort was used in a
previous publication (5). Controls for these cohorts were obtained
from several population-based cohorts across Germany to match the
different geographical regions where cases were recruited: KORA from
the southeastern Germany region of Augsburg (52, 53), HNR from
central western Germany (54), SHIP from the northeastern region of
West Pomerania (55), DOGS from Dortmund in central western
Germany (56), and FoCus (57) and PopGen (58) from Kiel, northern
Germany. In addition, controls from two studies on depression con-
ducted in southeastern Germany were included (59, 60). For a more
detailed description of control cohorts, see the Supplementary Materials.
All responsible ethics committees provided positive votes for the indi-
vidual studies. All study participants gave written informed consent. In
case of minors, parental informed consent was obtained.
Genotyping and QC
Samples of cohort DE1 were genotyped using the Illumina Human-
OmniExpress-24 v1.0 or v1.1 BeadChips. Samples of cohort DE2 were
genotyped using the Illumina Human 660-Quad platform. For both
cohorts, identical, stringent QC was conducted on samples and var-
iants. QC steps on samples included removal of individuals with
genotyping rate <2%, cryptic relatives (relatedness ≥1/16), and genetic
population outliers. QC steps on variants included removal of variants
with call rate <2% and MAF <1%. For a full description of QC, see the
Supplementary Materials. Each set of cohorts was combined with
controls genotyped on similar arrays, producing case/control data sets
DE1 and DE2. QC was repeated on the merged data sets, leading to
final figures of 3934 cases and 8455 controls for DE1 (table S1), as well
as 954 cases and 1940 controls for DE2 (table S2).
Imputation
Prephasing (haplotype estimation) of genotype data was conducted
using SHAPEIT2, followed by imputation using IMPUTE2 in
5–megabase pair (Mbp) chunks (16–18). The 1000 Genomes Phase
1 June 2014 release was used as a reference panel. Imputed variants
were filtered for MAF (≥1%), INFO metric (≥0.8), and HWE (P ≥ 10−6).
For additional details, see the Supplementary Materials.
HLA alleles were separately imputed from genotyping data for DE1
and DE2 using HIBAG v1.6.0 (20). Alleles with a posterior probability

 >0.5 were converted to hard calls. Results were validated using HLA
typing of 442 patients from DE1 (see the Supplementary Materials).
Statistical analyses of genotype data
GWAS was conducted on data sets DE1 and DE2 using PLINK2
v1.90b3s (61). Sex and the first eight MDS components were used
as covariates in logistic regression. Data sets were combined using a
fixed-effects model in METASOFT (62). For maximum precision,
logistic regression and meta-analysis of lead SNPs were repeated in
R v3.2.3 using package meta v4.3.2. All follow-up analyses (for example,
conditional and interaction analyses) were conducted in R. Locus-
specific Manhattan plots were generated using LocusZoom with
European samples of the 1000 Genomes March 2012 reference panel
on the hg19 build (63). For analysis of HLA alleles, stepwise logistic
regression was conducted in R as previously described (1, 2, 5).
Gene expression and methylation data
For a subset of 242, mostly treatment-naïve patients from data set DE1
(73 male and 169 female) whole-blood RNA was collected using Tem-
pus Blood RNA Tubes (Applied Biosystems). RNA was hybridized to
Illumina HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) and further
processed as described in the Supplementary Materials. In summary,
QC was conducted in R 3.2.1 using the packages beadarray and lumi
(64, 65). Probes were transformed and normalized through variance
stabilization and normalization (66). Probes, which showed a detection
P < 0.05 in more than 10% of the samples, which could not be mapped to
a known transcript, or which were identified as cross-hybridizing by
the Re-Annotator pipeline (67), were removed. This left 20,302 tran-
scripts from 242 samples. Technical batch effects were identified by in-
spectingtheassociationofthefirsttwoprincipalcomponentsofexpression
levels with amplification round, amplification plate, and amplification
plate column and row, as well as expression chip. The data were then
adjusted using ComBat (68). Gene expression and methylation data of the
two control cohorts MPIP and GTP were published and described previ-
ously and are summarized in the Supplementary Materials (25–28).
Statistical analysis of gene expression and methylation data
For each of the 15 genome-wide significant loci, all 429 transcripts
beginning or ending within 1 Mbp upstream or downstream of a lead
variant were determined. Associations between genotype and expres-
sion levels were examined in data set DE1 by linear regression using sex,
age, and three MDS components as covariates. To account for multiple
testing, P values were first corrected for the number of transcripts per
cis window, followed by calculation of the FDR for the total number of
variants tested. Replication of eQTLs with an FDR <0.05 in data set DE1
was conducted in control cohorts MPIP and GTP. For MPIP, the covari-
ates sex, age, body mass index (BMI), disease status, and three MDS com-
ponents were used in linear regression. For GTP, covariates were sex, age,
and four MDS components. eQTLs were also looked up in the GTEx
database (29). Here, only associations in whole blood were considered.
For analysis of the association of rs4925166 with DNA methylation
at SHMT1, 210 CpG probes were identified in data set MPIP that
mapped to SHMT1. After removing the quartile of probes showing
the lowest variation in methylation status, 157 CpGs remained. As-
sociation of DNA methylation with imputed genotype was assessed
by linear regression using sex, age, BMI, disease status, three MDS
components, and estimated cell counts as covariates. The eight CpG
probes showing an FDR <0.05 were replicated in data set GTP, using
sex, age, four MDS components, and estimated cell counts as covariates.
Mediation analysis was conducted as outlined in the Supplementary
Materials, including nonparametric bootstrap for estimation of CIs
and P values (30).
Replication of the results in a Sardinian cohort
The replication case group consisted of 2903 unrelated Sardinian MS
patients that were diagnosed and selected using the McDonald criteria
(22–24). Only 35 of these patients were diagnosed with PPMS (1.2%).
Two thousand ten (69.2%) cases were female, and 893 (30.8%) were
male; the average age at onset was 32 years. The matching control
group of healthy individuals is composed of 2880 unrelated adult
volunteer blood donors from the same locations where the cases
were collected, as well as 443 Affected Family BAsed pseudo-Controls
(AFBACs) derived from 242 MS and 201 type 1 diabetes family trios
(23). AFBAC allele and haplotype frequencies were constructed using
the two alleles in each trio that are not transmitted from the parents to
the affected child. These familial pseudo-controls are matched to the
cases for ethnic origin and are thus robust to population stratification.
All individuals were genotyped using the Illumina ImmunoChip
array. In addition, 2040 (962 cases and 1078 controls) were genotyped
with the Illumina HumanOmniExpress array and 3917 (2111 cases and
1806 controls) with the Affymetrix 6.0 array. One hundred seventy-four
individuals (170 case and 4 controls) were genotyped using both
HumanOmniExpress and Affymetrix 6.0 (22). After QC, we used
883,557 SNPs as baseline for imputation (17) of 20.1 million untyped
SNPsusingaSardinian-specificreferencepanel,including3514Sardinian
individuals sequenced to an average coverage of 4.16-fold (69).
