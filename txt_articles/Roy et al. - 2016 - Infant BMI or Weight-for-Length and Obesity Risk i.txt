BACKGROUND: Weight-for-length (WFL) is currently used to assess adiposity under 2 years. We 
assessed WFL- versus BMI-based estimates of adiposity in healthy infants in determining 
risk for early obesity.
METHODS: Anthropometrics were extracted from electronic medical records for well-
child visits for 73 949 full-term infants from a large pediatric network. World Health 
Organization WFL and BMI z scores (WFL-z and BMI-z, respectively) were calculated up to 
age 24 months. Correlation analyses assessed the agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z and 
within-subject tracking over time. Logistic regression determined odds of obesity at 2 years 
on the basis of adiposity classification at 2 months.
RESULTS: Agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z increased from birth to 6 months and 
remained high thereafter. BMI-z at 2 months was more consistent with measurements at 
older ages than WFL-z at 2 months. Infants with high BMI (≥85th percentile) and reference 
WFL (5th–85th percentiles) at 2 months had greater odds of obesity at 2 years than those 
with high WFL (≥85th percentile) and reference BMI (5th–85th percentiles; odds ratio, 
5.49 vs 1.40; P < .001). At 2 months, BMI had a higher positive predictive value than WFL 
for obesity at 2 years using cut-points of either the 85th percentile (31% vs 23%) or 97.7th 
percentile (47% vs 29%).
CONCLUSIONS: High BMI in early infancy is more strongly associated with early childhood 
obesity than high WFL. Forty-seven percent of infants with BMI ≥97.7th percentile at 2 
months (versus 29% of infants with WFL ≥97.7th percentile at 2 months) were obese at 2 
years. Epidemiologic studies focused on assessing childhood obesity risk should consider 
using BMI in early infancy.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends that weight-
for-length (WFL) be used for children under age 2 
years to identify those at risk for obesity. Studies 
have suggested that BMI may be an accurate index of 
adiposity in infancy and may better predict obesity 
risk.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Discordance between WFL 
and BMI more frequently occurs during ages 0 to 6 
months, but the 2 are concordant thereafter. Having 
a high BMI (versus a high WFL) at age 2 months is 
more predictive of obesity risk at age 2 years.

ROY et al 
Over one-third of US adults 
are obese.1 Prevention of adult 
obesity requires identifying at-risk 
individuals at a time in life when 
interventions may be most effective, 
even as early as infancy.2–5
A major challenge in identifying 
infants at highest risk for obesity is 
that there is currently no accepted 
definition for excess adiposity in 
infants under age 2 years.6 BMI is 
used to assess obesity in children 
and adults, 
6 and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) has published 
BMI standards for infants.7 However, 
weight-for-length (WFL), rather than 
BMI, is the current anthropometric 
standard used to assess nutritional 
status in the first 2 years of life in the 
United States, as recommended by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP).8 WFL is also the predominant 
standard used worldwide.9 The 
relationship between weight 
and length varies as a function of 
age during infancy, and the WFL 
percentile curves do not reflect this 
age-dependent variation in infant 
growth.10 Recent studies have 
suggested that BMI may be a useful 
index of adiposity in infancy that also 
provides information about future 
obesity risk.11–17 To our knowledge, 
no studies have evaluated the relative 
performance of BMI versus WFL 
with respect to estimating future 
obesity risk in full-term infants. It 
is unknown whether these metrics 
agree with each other in identifying 
risk for excess adiposity in infancy. 
Thus, the aims of the current study 
were the following: (1) to determine 
the consistency between BMI- versus 
WFL-based estimates of adiposity 
in healthy infants and (2) to assess 
how BMI and WFL, measured during 
infancy, relate to early childhood 
obesity.
METHODS
Study Sample
The sample included healthy, 
full-term infants with at least 1 
simultaneous length and weight 
measurement between ages 0 and 
26 months enrolled in the Pediatric 
Care Network Study while receiving 
clinical care at The Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). 
The Pediatric Care Network Study 
investigated the prevalence of obesity 
and included children who had at 
least 1 well-child check between 
January 1, 2006, and December 
31, 2011. Data were excluded 
from any clinic sites at which the 
recumbent length board was not 
used for measuring infant lengths. 
The institutional review board at 
CHOP reviewed the protocol and 
determined it was exempt given that 
only completely deidentified records 
were used.
Electronic Medical Record 
Measurements and Clinical 
Characteristics
Simultaneous height and weight 
measurements were extracted from 
visits corresponding to ages at which 
prescribed well-child checks occur: 
0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 
months; and both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal data were investigated. 
The closest measurements were 
included ±2 weeks for ages 0 to 2 
months, ±4 weeks for ages 4 to 15 
months, ±6 weeks for age 18 months, 
and ±8 weeks for age 24 months. 
All height and weight z scores were 
within WHO parameters for plausible 
data (within 6 SDs for height z, and 
both greater than −6 SDs and less 
than +5 SDs for weight z).18 WHO 
WFL and BMI z scores (WFL-z and 
BMI-z, respectively) were calculated 
at each age according to published 
standards.19
Additionally, all available 
sociodemographic characteristics 
were extracted from the electronic 
medical record for each child: 
gender, race, ethnicity, and Medicaid 
status at each visit (receiving or not 
receiving assistance for payment of 
medical bills in individuals below 
a certain income threshold). As 
non-Hispanic black (NH black) 
persons have the highest age-
adjusted rate of adult obesity, 
20 
and given our large proportion of 
NH black participants, we classified 
ancestry as NH black versus nonblack 
(all others). Birth weight information 
was not consistently available for all 
participants, so WHO weight z score 
closest to 14 ± 7 days of life was used 
as a proxy for birth weight, because 
infants usually regain their birth 
weight by ~2 weeks of age.21
Statistical Analyses
Prevalence and Persistence of 
Agreement and Discordance Between 
BMI-z and WFL-z
Prevalence of discordance between 
WFL-z and BMI-z measurements 
at each age was investigated. 
All measurements classified as 
underweight by any metric (<5th 
percentile for either BMI-z or WFL-
z) were excluded from subsequent 
analyses, because the primary 
purpose of this study was to 
investigate discordance in metrics 
related to future obesity risk. 
Measurements were classified into 
1 of 4 adiposity classification groups 
on the basis of measurements at 
age 2 months for further analyses: 
group 1 (reference range for both 
WFL and BMI, [WFLref_BMIref], both 
WFL and BMI 5th–85th percentiles); 
group 2 (high WFL and reference 
range BMI, [WFLhigh_BMIref], WFL 
≥85th percentile and BMI 5th–85th 
percentiles); group 3 (reference 
range WFL and high BMI, [WFLref_
BMIhigh], WFL 5th–85th percentiles 
and BMI ≥85th percentile); and 
group 4 (high for both WFL and 
BMI, [WFLhigh_BMIhigh], WFL ≥85th 
percentile and BMI ≥85th percentile). 
The 85th percentile was chosen 
as a threshold for “high” values as 
an extrapolation of “overweight” 
status from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) 
curves22 because there is no clearly 
established percentile classification 
of overweight status using the WHO

curves and as WHO BMI-for-age 
charts display the 85th percentile.7
Pearson correlation analyses were 
used to assess agreement between 
WFL-z and BMI-z at different ages. 
A measure that yields consistent 
results over time is more clinically 
useful; thus, the within-subject 
Pearson correlations of both WFL-z 
and BMI-z were investigated at 
various time intervals (2 and 6 
months, 2 and 12 months, 2 and 
18 months, and 2 and 24 months). 
Fisher r to z transformation was 
used to compare BMI-z tracking 
correlations with WFL-z tracking 
correlations at the corresponding 
time interval.23 Age 2 months 
was chosen as the reference age 
range for this analysis along with 
subsequent analyses because of 
the relatively higher proportion of 
discordance between WFL and BMI 
at this age and to avoid the highly 
variable weight measurements 
during the neonatal period.
Factors Associated With Discordance in 
Adiposity Classifi
 cation on the Basis of 
Adiposity Classifi
 cation at Age 2 Months
Bivariate analyses (χ2 analyses and 
2-sided t tests) assessed differences 
in gender, ancestry, Medicaid status, 
and weight z at 14 ± 7 days (birth 
weight proxy) between discordant 
groups (group 2 [WFLhigh_BMIref] 
vs group 3 [WFLref_BMIhigh]) and 
between each discordant group 
compared with the group with 
measurements in the reference 
range of WFL and BMI (group 2 
[WFLhigh_BMIref] vs group 1 [WFLref_
BMIref] and group 3 [WFLref_BMIhigh] 
vs group 1 [WFLref_BMIref]). Then 
logistic regression analysis assessed 
the odds of group 2 discordance (vs 
group 1), group 3 discordance (vs 
group 1), and group 3 discordance 
(vs group 2 discordance), 
first assessing the effects of 
sociodemographic factors followed 
by the additional effect of weight z at 
14 days (birth weight proxy).
Growth Pattern in the First 2 Years on 
the Basis of Adiposity Classifi
 cation at 
Age 2 Months
Growth patterns through the 
first 2 years of life were plotted 
by using mean raw values of BMI 
along with the components used 
in the calculation of BMI: weight 
and length. This was done to more 
clearly appreciate the impact of 
both weight and length on the 
net BMI trajectory, according to 
adiposity classification. Generalized 
estimating equation regression 
analyses assessed differences in BMI, 
length, and weight at all visit ages 
by infant adiposity classification 
group; age-by-adiposity classification 
group interactions assessed how 
measurements between adiposity 
groups differed at each age. Posthoc 
linear combinations of estimators 
were calculated to better understand 
the effect of adiposity classification 
group on these metrics. Analyses 
were performed separately by gender 
given the distinct growth trajectories 
of male and female infants.11
Adiposity Classifi
 cation at Age 2 Months 
and Risk of Obesity at Age 2 Years
Logistic regression was used 
to investigate how adiposity 
classification at 2 months impacted 
odds of obesity at age 2 years, first 
accounting for sociodemographic 
characteristics and then assessing 
the effect of adiposity classification 
group before and after the addition 
of weight z score at 14 ± 7 days 
(birth weight proxy). Postestimation 
likelihood ratios were performed to 
test differences between adiposity 
classification groups. Finally, the 
positive and negative predictive 
values of WFL or BMI cutoffs of the 
85th percentile and 97.7th percentile 
at age 2 months on obesity status 
at age 2 years were calculated. The 
85th percentile was chosen as an 
extrapolation of overweight status 
from the CDC curves22 because there 
is no clearly established percentile 
classification of overweight status 
using the WHO curves and as WHO 
BMI-for-age charts display the 85th 
percentile.7 The 97.7th percentile 
was chosen because it is considered 
the upper bound (+2 SDs) of the 
normal range for the WHO growth 
charts.18
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The sample consisted of 73 949 
participants with a total of 346 939 
simultaneous weight and length 
measurements between the ages of 
0 to 2 years (Table 1). The sample 
was 49% girls, with 33% black 
and 45% white participants; 5% 
of all ancestries were of Hispanic 
ethnicity, and 32% of the sample was 
NH black. Thirty-one percent were 
receiving Medicaid at age 2 months. 
12 630 participants (17%) had 
anthropometric data available at 2 
years of age. Analysis of participants 
with and without anthropometric 
data at age 2 years revealed no 
differences in gender (P = .509), 
but there were more NH black 
participants and more participants 
receiving Medicaid on the basis of 
their classification at age 2 months 
(P < .001) than expected in the group 
with 2-year data available. Two-year 
analyses were restricted to those 
with complete data.
More measurements were ≥85th 
percentile by WFL than by BMI 
(25% vs 23%, P < .001). As shown 
in Fig 1, percentage of discordance 
ranged from 14% to 18% between 
ages 0 and 2 months to 3% to 6% 
at visits from ages 4 to 24 months. 
The number of measurements by 
category at each visit age is shown in 
Supplemental Table 7.

up to a correlation of r = 0.998 (P <

correlations remained high at r = 
0.98–0.99 from ages 6 to 24 months 
(P < .001).
Within-subject correlations 
(Table 3) evaluated the consistency 
of each child’s WFL and BMI 
z scores as she or he got older at 
various intervals starting from 
age 2 months. Within-subject 
correlations were significantly 
greater for BMI than for WFL at 
every interval between 2 and 24 
months of age, with the greatest 
difference noted between ages 2 
and 6 months (z = 15.2, P < .001, 
n = 28 156).

Bivariate Analyses of Factors 
Associated With Discordance 
Between WFL and BMI in Infancy on 
the Basis of Adiposity Classifi
 cation 
at Age 2 Months
Group 2 discordance (WFLhigh_BMIref) 
versus group 1 (WFLref_BMIref) 
was seen more frequently in boys, 
NH black participants, those on 
Medicaid, and individuals with lower 
weight z at 14 days (P < .001). Group 
3 discordance (WFLref_BMIhigh) 
versus group 1 (WFLref_BMIref) 
was marginally more frequent in 
nonblack participants (P = .072) 
and significantly more frequent in 
those with higher weight z at 14 
days (P < .001), but there was no 
difference on the basis of gender or 
Medicaid status. Those with group 
3 (WFLref_BMIhigh) versus group 2 
(WFLhigh_BMIref) classification had 
higher weight z at 14 days (P < .001) 
and were more likely girls (P = .021), 
nonblack (P < .001), and not on 
Medicaid (P < .001).
Multivariable Analyses of Factors 
Associated With Discordance Between 
WFL and BMI in Infancy on the Basis of 
Adiposity Classifi
 cation at Age 2 Months
Consistent with bivariate results, by 
logistic regression, female gender, 
nonblack ancestry, and non-Medicaid 
status were each significantly and 
independently associated with higher 
odds of being classified as group 
3 (WFLref_BMIhigh) compared with 
group 2 discordance (WFLhigh_BMIref; 
P < .05 for all; Table 4, Model 1). The 
odds of group 3 adiposity (WFLref_
BMIhigh) was increased by 16.5 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 11.4–23.7, 
P < .001; Table 4, Model 2) for every 
SD increase in the proxy birth weight 
measurement (weight z score at 14 ± 
7 days). Logistic regression analysis 
of the odds of being classified as 
a discordant group (group 2 or 
group 3) versus the reference group 
(group 1) also revealed directionally 
consistent results to those found by 
bivariate analysis (Supplemental 
Tables 8 and 9). Sensitivity analyses 
restricting data only to subjects 
with complete data are shown in 
Supplemental Tables 10, 11, and 12 
and showed consistent directionality.
Growth Patterns of BMI, Length, and 
Weight on the Basis of WFL and BMI 
in Early Infancy
BMI and WFL classification were 
most discordant at age 2 months. To 
examine the long-term implications 
of discordance at age 2 months, we 
examined growth patterns of BMI 
for each of the groups (Fig 2A). Both 
male and female infants in group 3 
(WFLref_BMIhigh) at age 2 months 
had a persistently higher BMI from 0 
to 24 months of age compared with 
those in the reference ranges for 
both WFL and BMI (WFLref_BMIref; 
P < .001). There was no significant 
difference in BMI between group 
3 (WFLref_BMIhigh) and group 4 
(WFLhigh_BMIhigh) for the majority of 
visits (except age 2 months in girls 
and ages 2 to 6 months in boys, P < 
.01 for all).
Mean weight and length were 
also plotted for each group on 
the basis of their classification at 
age 2 months. As shown in Fig 2 
B and C, for both male and female 
infants, group 3 (WFLref_BMIhigh) 
had the highest weight and length 
throughout (P < .001 for all visit 
ages), whereas those in group 2 
(WFLhigh_BMIref) had a lower weight 
(P < .05 for all visit ages) and shorter 
length throughout (P < .001 for all 
visit ages).
The odds of obesity at age 2 years 
on the basis of sociodemographic 
characteristics and adiposity 
classification at age 2 months was 
then assessed (Table 5). Medicaid 
status at age 2 months was found to be 
significantly associated with obesity 
at age 2 years (Table 5, Model 1). 
Infants in group 3 (WFLref_BMIhigh) at 
age 2 months had a higher likelihood 
for obesity at age 2 years than infants

Positive and Negative Predictive 
Values of WFL and BMI at 2 Months 
With Obesity at 2 Years
The positive predictive values (PPVs) 
and negative predictive values (NPVs) 
of WFL and BMI cutoffs of 85th 
percentile at age 2 months with obesity 
at age 2 years were calculated (Table 
6, Columns 1–2) and revealed that BMI 
≥85th percentile at age 2 months had a 
higher PPV (31%; 95% CI: 27%–34%) 
than WFL ≥85th percentile at age 2 
months (23%; 95% CI: 21%–26%) for 
obesity at age 2 years. However, the 
NPV for both WFL and BMI at the 85th 
percentile cutoff at age 2 months were 
the same at 90%.
The PPV and NPV of both WFL and 
BMI cutoffs of 97.7th percentile at 
age 2 months with obesity at age 2 
years were also calculated (Table 
6, Columns 3–4); BMI ≥97.7th 
percentile at age 2 months had a 
higher PPV (47%; 95% CI: 37%–
57%) than WFL ≥97.7th percentile 
at age 2 months (29%; 95% CI: 
23%–36%) for obesity at age 2 years. 
Again, the NPV for both BMI and WFL 
at cutoffs of 97.7th percentile were 
the same at age 2 months (88%).
DISCUSSION
The recent recommendation of the 
AAP’s Committee on Nutrition is to 
use WHO WFL charts for children 
less than 24 months of age to identify 
those at risk for developing obesity.8 
To our knowledge, ours is the first 
report to compare WHO WFL and BMI 
in a large, diverse, urban, longitudinal 
cohort of full-term infants at high risk 
for childhood obesity to determine 
whether they differ in identifying 
children at risk for early childhood 
obesity.24 We illustrate that in early 
infancy, BMI has a significantly higher 
PPV for later obesity risk than does 
WFL. The relatively high proportion 
of discordance between WFL and BMI 
in the first few months of life and the 
disparate risks of later obesity on 
the basis of adiposity classification 
group at age 2 months indicates that 
(1) future obesity risk may manifest 
as early as 2 months of age and that 
(2) BMI may be a better indicator 
of future obesity risk than WFL in 
early infancy, particularly when 
discordance exists between the 2 
metrics. After age 6 months, however, 
concordance between WFL and 
BMI is consistently high, indicating 
that either may be a reasonable 
anthropometric measure in later 
infancy with regard to assessing 
early childhood obesity risk. Notably, 
consistency between within-subject 
BMI measurements over time is 
significantly higher than that of 
within-subject WFL measurements 
over time, providing further support 
for the stability of BMI with time 
compared with WFL.
Examination of length and weight 
trajectories provides insight into 
the superior performance of BMI at 
age 2 months as an indicator of later 
obesity. We show that young infants 
with high WFL (≥85th percentile) 
and BMI in the reference range 
(5th–85th percentile) tend to be 
short for their age. Because WFL 
charts do not take age into account, 
an infant with shorter length-for-
age will be compared with children 
of younger ages who are likely 
to have lower weights, and thus 
classified as having a relatively high 
WFL. Adiposity increases rapidly in 
infancy reaching a peak around age 
6 months.25 Thus, evaluation of WFL 
relationships optimally accounts for 
age-specific patterns of gain in both 
weight and length. The advantage 
of BMI-based standards is that they 
account for the distributions of 
weight and length at a given age.
The methods by which the WHO 
growth standards were constructed 
may provide further insight into the 
observed differences between BMI

and WFL; outliers (> or <2–3 SDs) 
for WFL measurements, but not BMI 
measurements, were removed from 
this international reference sample, 
18 
thus, introducing a potential 
ascertainment bias into the growth 
standards.
Notably, our study was consistent 
with other studies that demonstrate 
the effects of birth weight and 
socioeconomic status on later obesity 
risk, 
26, 
27 because we also found that 
a higher weight z score at 14 ± 7 days 
(proxy birth weight measurement) 
along with Medicaid status at age 2 
months were each associated with a 
higher odds of obesity at age 2 years.
A great strength of our study was 
the inclusion of over 70 000 children 
and a large number of measurements 
from which to estimate rates of WFL 
and BMI. However, our study had 
a few inherent limitations. There 
were more non-Hispanic black 
participants than expected in the 
group with 2-year anthropometric 
data available. This may relate to 
the timing of implementation of 
electronic medical health records 
at various CHOP locations with 
different sociodemographic profiles. 
Consistent follow-up information 
on participants in this data set was 
only available through the first 
2 years of life; thus, assessment 
of long-term obesity risk was 
limited. However, many recent 
studies have provided evidence 
that anthropometric parameters 
as early as 6 to 9 months of age 
are associated with childhood and 
even late adolescent obesity risk.12, 
15, 
28, 
29 Future prospective studies 
should investigate how infancy BMI 
performs in estimating obesity risk 
later in life when combined with 
other factors, in particular parental 
characteristics, feeding patterns, or 
body composition data, which were 
not available in the current study.
Both WFL and BMI have high NPVs 
in early infancy, suggesting a low risk 
for early childhood obesity if infancy 
WFL or BMI is <85th percentile. It is 
remarkable that 31% of individuals 
with BMI ≥ the 85th percentile (vs 
23% by WFL) and 47% with BMI 
≥ the 97.7th percentile (vs 29% by 
WFL) at age 2 months will be obese 
at age 2 years. Indeed, it has been 
suggested that BMI in early infancy 
represents a potentially helpful 
metric for epidemiologic research.30 
As BMI is the anthropometric 
measure routinely assessed from 
age 2 years into adulthood, 
8 we 
recommend that clinicians consider 
introducing parents to the WHO 
BMI growth chart, in addition to the 
currently recommended WFL growth 
chart, even in early infancy. A high 
BMI, even with WFL in the reference 
range, may indicate a higher 
risk for later obesity, providing 
an opportunity for preventative 
counseling in early infancy. Our 
findings in a large cohort of healthy, 
full-term children provide further 
support for the utility of infancy BMI 
in longitudinal studies of childhood 
obesity.
