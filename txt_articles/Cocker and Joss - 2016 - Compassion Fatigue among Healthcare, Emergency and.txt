Abstract: Compassion fatigue (CF) is stress resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual.
CF has been described as the convergence of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and cumulative
burnout (BO), a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by a depleted ability to cope with
one’s everyday environment. Professionals regularly exposed to the traumatic experiences of the
people they service, such as healthcare, emergency and community service workers, are particularly
susceptible to developing CF. This can impact standards of patient care, relationships with colleagues,
or lead to more serious mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
anxiety or depression. A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce CF in
healthcare, emergency and community service workers was conducted. Thirteen relevant studies
were identified, the majority of which were conducted on nurses (n = 10). Three included studies
focused on community service workers (social workers, disability sector workers), while no studies
targeting emergency service workers were identified. Seven studies reported a significant difference
post-intervention in BO (n = 4) or STS (n = 3). This review revealed that evidence of the effectiveness
of CF interventions in at-risk health and social care professions is relatively recent. Therefore, we
recommend more research to determine how best to protect vulnerable workers at work to prevent not
only CF, but also the health and economic consequences related to the ensuing, and more disabling,
physical and mental health outcomes.

1. Introduction
The compassion and empathy shown by healthcare, emergency and community service
professionals can prove psychically, mentally and economically costly. In short, exposure to patients or
clients experiencing trauma or distress can negatively impact professional’s mental and physical health,
safety and wellbeing, as well as that of their families, the people they care for, and their employing
organizations. The term compassion fatigue (CF) was coined to described the phenomenon of stress
resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual rather than from exposure to the trauma itself [1].
An often extreme state of tension and preoccupation with the emotional pain and/or physical distress
of those being helped can create a secondary traumatic stress (STS) for the caregiver [2,3], and, when
converged with cumulative burnout (BO), a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by a
depleted ability to cope with one’s everyday environment [4–6], CF results.

CF is characterized by exhaustion, anger and irritability, negative coping behaviours including
alcohol and drug abuse, reduced ability to feel sympathy and empathy, a diminished sense of
enjoyment or satisfaction with work, increased absenteeism, and an impaired ability to make decisions
and care for patients and/or clients [7]. The negative effects of providing care are aggravated by
the severity of the traumatic material to which the caregiver is exposed, such as direct contact with
victims, particularly when the exposure is of a graphic nature. This places certain occupations, such as
healthcare, emergency and community service workers, at an increased risk of developing CF and
potentially more debilitating conditions such as depression and anxiety [8], and even posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) [9]. These conditions are known to increase sickness absence, psychological
injury claims, and job turnover, and negatively impact productivity.
Compassion fatigue (CF) has been variously defined, and the related concepts of BO, STS
and vicarious traumatisation (VT) are often used interchangeably and incorrectly to describe the
phenomenon. BO and STS are related to CF, but as defined by Stamm, they are two distinct outcomes
of exposure [10]. As demonstrated by Figure 1, BO and STS arise from separate failed survival
strategies [11]. BO arises from a assertiveness-goal achievement response and occurs when an
individual cannot achieve his or her goals and results in “frustration, a sense of loss of control, increased
willful efforts, and diminishing morale” [11]. Alternatively, STS arises from a rescue-caretaking
response and occurs when an individual cannot rescue or save someone from harm and results in
guilt and distress [11]. Subsequently, STS and BO lead to CF if the aforementioned symptoms are not
mediated by a third, equally important concept of compassion satisfaction (CS). CF and CS can be seen
as the positive and negative consequences of working with individuals who have experienced or are
currently experiencing trauma or suffering [10]. As a result, a substantial amount of evidence suggests
CS is an important part of the whole [12], thus increasing the significance of building resiliency and
the transformation from negative to positive aspects [10,13,14].
The most commonly used definition of CF was developed by Figley [1] and describes the concept
as “a state of exhaustion and dysfunction biologically, psychologically, and socially as a result of
prolonged exposure to compassion stress and all it invokes” (p. 253). This definition more effectively
encompasses the multiple dimensions of CF. Lynch and Lobo [15] defined the attributes of CF as an
established relationship between the caregiver and the patient/client all associated with the caregiving
role and the psychological and physical responses it arouses [15]. Yoder et al. [16] identified triggering
events based on nurses taking care of patients who were experiencing serious life-threatening situations
and cases involving futile or palliative care. Lynch and Lobo [15] also identified system issues or
organisational factors, such as physical and emotionally demanding assignments and extra work
days as risk factors for CF, while Najjar et al. identified that empathy is vital to the development of
CF, as the caregiver must have the ability to perceive and understand what their patient/client is
experiencing and be able to communicate this understanding [17]. Finally, the psychological response
to the conflicting elements of empathy and suffering provides the foundation for ongoing stress and
subsequent CF [15]. In summary, CF results from “the change in empathetic ability of the caregiver in
reaction to the prolonged and overwhelming stress of caregiving” [15].
CF is most commonly measured using the validated Professional Quality of Life (ProQoL)
scale. The overall concept of ProQoL is a complex milieu of characteristics of the work environment
(organization, tasks), the individual’s personal characteristics, and their exposure to primary and
secondary trauma in the work setting. In short, ProQoL refers to the quality one feels in relation to
their work as a caregiver, and both the positive and negative aspects of doing one’s job. As such, the
ProQoL scale measures both pre-cursors of CF (BO and STS), and CS.
Since the mid-1990s [1,18–20] the emotional, cognitive, and physical consequences of providing
professional services to trauma victims and survivors have been addressed in the literature and several
conceptual models have been developed in attempt to explain them. However, the majority of research
to date has focused on identifying the prevalence and predictors of CF in a unique occupational group
such as nurses [21,22], therapists [23,24], community service workers, and healthcare professionals in

hospital emergency departments or intensive care units [25]. While these studies have gone some way
to illuminate how CF can be addressed, their findings cannot be generalised to working populations
beyond the healthcare sector. Furthermore, despite the identification of modifiable individual and
organisational risk factors used to inform the development of interventions and programs to prevent
and treat CF, few studies have attempted to examine and interrogate the quality of these preventive
measures. These include workload intensity, inadequate rest time periods between shifts, task
repetitiveness [3], low control and low job satisfaction [26], poor resilience, lack of meaningful
recognition, and poor managerial support [27]. As a result, employers and managers in the healthcare,
emergency and community services sectors have very little conclusive evidence as to the best way
to prevent CF, and physical and mental health outcomes, when its known risk factors—exposure
to traumatised patients and clients—are inherent in the type of work that the employees supervise
and undertake.

The ultimate goal of CF research is to create healthy caregivers that are able to master the art of 
resiliency and return quickly to high-functioning behaviours, both at work and outside the 
workplace, after exposure to the traumatic experience of a patient or client. As experiencing 
secondary trauma could be considered an inherent risk for the occupations of interest in this paper, 
the actual job exposures may be difficult to modify. Therefore, interventions that promote individual 
resilience and educate at-risk workers about effective coping strategies in response to these adverse 
job exposures are equally important and likely to have significant health and economic benefits, as 
they reduce not only STS, BO and CF, but also the risk of more serious mental health disorders such 
as anxiety and depression, the quality of life and productivity consequences of which are well 
documented. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to: (i) identify existing evidence on 
interventions to reduce CF in healthcare, and emergency and community service professionals; and 
(ii) determine the most effective workplace-based strategies for reducing CF, directly or via 
modifying its recognised individual and organisational risk factors and/or promoting Compassion 
Satisfaction. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Search Strategy 
The following search strategy was carried out using the major relevant database search engines 
(i.e., EMBASE, CINHAL, PsychInfo, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus). Search terms were 
divided into four groups. Group 1 related to CF, related concepts, and variants or derivatives such as 
VT or STS. Group 2 included at-risk occupation types commonly exposed to known risk factors for 
CF such as frontline health, emergency and community service workers. Group 3 included terms 
related to the study design, for which we used the Cochrane search terms for identifying 
interventions and trials (e.g., intervention or training or program or efficacy or randomized control

The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 1990 and
December 2015. Both authors (Fiona Cocker and Nerida Joss) screened article titles and abstracts
to determine eligibility. In addition, a hand search of key journals and reference lists of all studies
selected for inclusion in the analysis was conducted. Appendix A Table A1 contains a summary of the
search strategy.
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria dictated that the studies contained a quantitative evaluation of an
intervention that reported outcomes on a standardized and validated measure for compassion fatigue.
This measure could be any of the validated versions of the most commonly used Professional Quality
of Life (Pro-QoL) or a less common, but equally valid measure of CF. Alternatively, the outcomes
could be one of the sub-scales of the Pro-QoL; CS, a protective factor, or STS or BO, both of which are
known risk factors for CF. Finally, the outcome could be a subscale of a general health measure that
has evidence of validity as a CF, BO, STS, or CS screening tool (e.g., Maslach Burnout Scale [29], or
The Resilience Scale [30]). The intervention had to target CF directly or indirectly through a known
risk factor for CF, such as those reviewed in the introduction (lack of meaningful recognition, years of
experience, higher job satisfaction, and poor psychosocial work climate). The intervention settings
could be in work or non-work settings. Studies were excluded if they did not report on CF, focused on
prevalence of CF only, or used a qualitative methodology.
2.3. Data Extraction
The variables extracted covered intervention descriptors, sample characteristics, implementation
characteristics, quality of the research design (use of control group, random allocation), and outcome
indicators. We did not use a quality rating score in the analysis, as it introduces subjectivity and is
prone to incomplete data. Coding instructions and guidelines were developed by the first and second
authors in order to reduce the subjectivity of decisions made. On completion of the coding, the first
author (Fiona Cocker) independently checked the coding of each of the papers. Instances in which
disagreement with the initial coding decisions occurred were resolved by consensus between both
authors (Fiona Cocker and Nerida Joss).
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Our primary outcomes were the components of the ProQoL: BO, STS and CS. Due to the small
number of studies identified (n = 13), no statistical analysis was undertaken, and meta-analysis was
not possible.
3. Results
Figure 2 presents the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses) flow diagram summarizing the inclusion and exclusion decisions made by both
authors (Fiona Cocker and Nerida Joss). Due to the small number of hits generated (229), all articles
were carefully inspected to determine whether they met criteria for inclusion, as opposed to making
exclusion decisions solely on the basis of the initial title screening. Following this review, two duplicate
articles were removed, and 216 articles were excluded. The majority of the studies (n = 198, 91.6%)
were excluded, as they focused solely on prevalence of CF, or a CF risk factor, within a particular
occupational group. The remainder of articles were excluded, as they did not evaluate the effectiveness
of a CF prevention or intervention program, their primary focus was not CF, or they did not have
a specific, validated measure of CF or factors which contribute to CF. For example, studies were
excluded if they had a PTSD or stress-related outcome measure, measures of general psychosocial
functioning, or well-being scales that have not been established in the literature as valid indicators of
CF. The application of these inclusion criteria resulted in a total of 13 studies being deemed suitable for
the detailed, systematic review and data extraction.

3.1. Characteristics of Included Studies 
Characteristics of included studies (n = 13) are presented in Table 1. Of the included studies n = 11 
(84.6%) were conducted in the USA [31–41], one in Australia [42], and one in Israel [43]. Ten of the 
thirteen studies included nurses (76.9%), with three studies specifically focusing on oncology nurses 
[32,34,35], one on pediatric nurses [43], and one on emergency nurses [39]. Other occupational groups 
represented were social workers (n = 2, 15.4%) [31,33], chaplains (n = 1, 7.7%) [33], hospice workers  
(n = 1, 7.7%) [40], disability sector workers (n = 1, 7.7%) [42], and miscellaneous medical staff (n = 3, 
23.1%) [37,38,41]. No studies targeting emergency service workers were identified. The 13 studies 
included represented a total sample size of 671 (M = 52, SD = 43), with sample sizes for the individual 
studies ranging from seven [36] to 154 [34]. Of those that reported mean age (n = 7, 53.8%) 
[31,34,35,38,40,42,43], averages ranged from 40.5 years [35] to 49.3 years [43], and of those which 
reported sex distribution (n = 11, 84.6%) [31–36,38–40,42,43], the majority of subjects were female 
(58.8% [42]–100% [43]). All included studies had a follow-up period ranging from three weeks [31] to 
six months [35] post-intervention. 
3.2. Outcome Measurements 
Ten (76.9%) of the included studies used a version of the Professional Quality of Life Scale 
(ProQoL) [10] to measure CF, as well as its subscales CS, BO and STS. Other measures of CF used 
were The Compassion Fatigue Scale (CFS), both original [1] and revised [44] versions, designed to 
assess both secondary trauma and job burnout, and the Compassion Satisfaction and Fatigue Test 
(CSFT) [12]. Three (23.1%) of the included studies [31,32,39] measured only one type of outcome 
(e.g., ProQoL, Version 5, Manufacturer, City, Country). The remaining ten included articles [33–
38,40–43] measured the following outcomes in addition to CF (Table 1): (i) burnout [34,35,38,42,45]; 
(ii) team building [33]; (iii) impact of traumatic events [34]; (iv) satisfaction with work or life [34,42]; 
(v) empathy [36]; (vi) resilience [36,41]; (vii) depression, anxiety, stress, or perceived stress [36–
38,42]; (viii) self-efficacy [43], self-esteem [43]; mastery and hope [43]; mindfulness [37,38], 
healthcare consumer assessment [37], general health [42]; grief [40]; work environment [40]; and 
coping [41].

3.2. Outcome Measurements
Ten (76.9%) of the included studies used a version of the Professional Quality of Life Scale
(ProQoL) [10] to measure CF, as well as its subscales CS, BO and STS. Other measures of CF used were
The Compassion Fatigue Scale (CFS), both original [1] and revised [44] versions, designed to assess
both secondary trauma and job burnout, and the Compassion Satisfaction and Fatigue Test (CSFT) [12].
Three (23.1%) of the included studies [31,32,39] measured only one type of outcome (e.g., ProQoL,
Version 5, Manufacturer, City, Country). The remaining ten included articles [33–38,40–43] measured
the following outcomes in addition to CF (Table 1): (i) burnout [34,35,38,42,45]; (ii) team building [33];
(iii) impact of traumatic events [34]; (iv) satisfaction with work or life [34,42]; (v) empathy [36]; (vi)
resilience [36,41]; (vii) depression, anxiety, stress, or perceived stress [36–38,42]; (viii) self-efficacy [43],
self-esteem [43]; mastery and hope [43]; mindfulness [37,38], healthcare consumer assessment [37],
general health [42]; grief [40]; work environment [40]; and coping [41].
3.3. Intervention Design
All of the interventions evaluated in the included studies were individually focused, and
the majority (n = 7, 53.8%) focused on stress reduction using yoga and/or mindfulness [31,37,42],
structured meditation [32,39], music therapy [33], or a combination thereof [38]. Of the remaining
four included studies, two evaluated interventions focused on building individual resilience [34,35],
one aimed to build professional self-efficacy [43], and Stanton et al. [36] used Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation to increase resilience and empathy, and reduce stress.
Eleven studies
described single-faceted interventions focusing on yoga, mindfulness, meditation, or music
therapy [31–33,37,38,40,42], resilience and coping [34,35,41], or transcranial magnetic stimulation [36].
In contrast, Berger et al. [43] and Flarity et al. [39] described more complex interventions involving on
multiple, interactive sessions focused on promoting professional self-efficacy, improving theoretical
knowledge, and assigning homework tasks, and individual and group exercises, guided imagery,
take home materials including print-outs, DVDs and music CDs, and access to educational resources
and publications, respectively. The included studies differed in their methodology; ten studies
(76.9%) [31–37,39,41,42] used a pre/post design, two studies (15.4%) used randomised controlled
designs (RCTs), one with a waitlist control group [38], the other with a no treatment, concurrent control
group [40]. Finally, Berger et al. [43] used a quasi-random control trial with a wait list control group.
Intervention periods of the included studies ranged from three to twelve weeks (M = 6.1, SD = 2.7),
session length ranged from 16 to 240 min (M = 78.9, SD = 58.6), and the frequency of sessions ranged
from once a week to five times a week (M = 1.5, SD = 1.2). None of the included studies assessed
intervention quality using a validated measure, and the majority of studies (n = 10, 76.9%) used
unrepresentative, convenience samples.
3.4. Effect of Interventions to Prevent or Manage Compassion Fatigue
The follow-up intervals ranged from three weeks [31], immediately post-intervention, to
6 months [35] after the baseline measurements. Eight (61.5%) of included studies reported a significant
difference post-intervention in either CF, or one of the ProQoL subscales BO, CS, or STS. More
specifically, five studies (38.5%) [32,34,35,39,41] reported significantly reduced BO and STS, risk factors
for CF, and three studies (23.1%) [38,39,43] reported significantly increased CS, a protective factor
in the development of CF. Flarity et al., the one study to achieve reduction in BO and STS and an
increase is CS, conducted an intensive, two-level intervention amongst emergency nurses involving,
firstly, a four hour, interactive group seminar focused the “ . . . origin of CF, the physiological effects,
signs and symptoms of CF and BO, as well as the factors associated with emergency nursing that
may lead to CF and BO”, as well as providing information about how to prevent and treat CF
using the five elements identified by Gentry et al. [44]; self-regulation, intentionality, perceptual
maturation/self-validated caregiving, connection and self-care. Secondly, participants were given
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 618
11 of 18
multimedia resources such as printed seminar handouts, a guided imagery CD, access to a website
with CF, CS and resiliency educational resources and publications, and DVD which informed them
of Gentry’s [44] aforementioned five elements. This is, by far, the most comprehensive intervention
evaluated by the included studies and, not surprisingly, has the most significant, positive outcomes.
Unlike the other twelve interventions evaluated, this intervention focuses on teaching participants:
(i) about CF; (ii) how to recognise, and actively prevent and treat CF in themselves and their colleagues;
and (iii) provides them with tools and resources to consolidate these learnings which is likely to
increase the probability of these positive outcomes remaining long term. However, this is yet to
be determined.
4. Discussion
This systematic review identified the evidence on interventions designed to reduce CF in health,
emergency and community service workers to determine the most effective workplace based strategies
for reducing CF directly or via modifying its recognised individual and organisational risk factors.
Despite the significant attention given to measuring the prevalence of CF in this cohort of workers,
there is a lack of information and evidence about effective interventions designed to reduce CF in these
occupational groups. We have found that, despite recognition of the threat exposure to secondary
trauma poses to the mental health and wellbeing of certain at-risk occupational groups, and the
established existence of wellness programs to combat CF and related concepts, rigorous, academic
evaluation of evidence on this topic has only recently emerged in the last few years, with the earliest
study published in 2011 with a group of 80 pediatric nurses in Israel, thus indicating the relative novelty
of interventional research in this area. By consolidating the small amount of evidence available we
have been able to identify promising interventions in this area as well as the evidence gaps and areas in
need of research attention in the future. In doing so, the subsequent evidence based workplace-based
interventions have the potential to reduce CF and more serious, chronic and economically costly
mental disorders, to the benefit of individual workers, employers and the broader society and economy
through the retention of healthy, productive workers who service those in need of healthcare and
social assistance.
4.1. Study Population Characteristics
The majority of studies identified in our search have been generated from the US (n = 11),
with nurses as the occupational group of interest (n = 10). As such, nurses were disproportionally
represented, limiting the generalizability of findings to other equally at-risk occupations such as police,
fire fighters, paramedics and other health and community service workers. Further, the majority
of subjects represented in the included studies were female (58.8% [42] to 100% [43]), which, while
reflective of the healthcare and social assistance industry to which many of the at-risk populations
belong [46], once again, reduces the level of generalizability as other occupational groups at-risk of
CF, such as the male-dominated emergency services [46] are not included. Older workers were also
disproportionally represented, with averages ranging from 40.5 years [35] to 49.3 years [43], thus
limiting applicability of the findings to younger workers who may be at risk of developing CF. More
specifically, evidence has identified that both age and years of professional experience were protective
factors for STS, CF, or BO [47–49]. In addition to the over-representation of several demographic
characteristics, some individual characteristics (e.g., educational attainment) and organisational factors
(e.g., long work hours and caseloads with high percentages of trauma patients) which have been
associated with an increased incidence of STS and CF [50,51], were not considered.
4.2. Study Design and Methodological Quality
Comparison between studies was difficult given the heterogeneity of the interventions themselves
and the lower level of methodological quality for the majority of studies. The majority of studies were
of low to moderate quality (n = 11), with only two RCT studies included in our review [38,40]. The
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 618
12 of 18
majority of studies (n = 10) employed a pre-post design, most of which did not include a long-term
follow up (ě8 weeks). Additionally, the length of the intervention period varied considerably from a
single four hour session [39] to six, one hour sessions once a week for 12 weeks [43]. This is a concern,
as significant behavioural and personal routine modification is required in some cases, without any
complementary changes being made to the work-related risk factors such as reduced exposure to
traumatised patients or clients or increased rest between shifts. Change is also unlikely within this
short time period [52,53], thus making significant improvement in CS or a significant decrease in BO
and/or STS similarly improbable. Finally, in addition to highly variable methodological design and
quality, most studies included (n = 12) have small sample sizes with less than 100 subjects, which
reduce statistical power, increase the possibility of type II error, and reduce the ability for statistical
tests to detect significant differences between values.
4.3. Effectiveness of CF Interventions
The thirteen included studies in our search demonstrated mixed or no effects. While ten studies
reported significant improvement in at least one element of CF, no study reported positive change
on all three indicators (STS, BO, CS) and only one study had a follow up period of longer than eight
weeks. This makes it difficult to determine with any certainty whether these effects were likely to be
sustained over time.
When we considered the findings of the included studies by the content of the interventions
evaluated, didactic and ecologic music therapy interventions were shown to be ineffective, as was grief
resolution, which involves expression of grief feelings, connecting socially with colleagues experiencing
similar feelings, and participation in a grief ritual to farewell patients who had died, Transcranial Direct
Current Stimulation, and mindfulness education. In contrast, structured meditation using an audio
CD [32], and interactive group seminars followed by individual and group exercises such as guided
imagery, and multimedia resources (printed handouts, DVD, guided imaging/music CD, a website
with CF and CS, and resiliency educational resources and publications) resulted in a significant decrease
in BO. However, the most promising trend was for the effectiveness of interventions involving an
element focused on teaching and/or bolstering resilience [35,39,41], all of which showed improvement
in BO, and two of which demonstrated a reduction in STS and BO, and an improvement in CS. These
findings are encouraging, as they suggest that workers in at-risk occupational groups can be taught to
cope with the known risk factors for the development of CF, which are also, unfortunately, unavoidable
parts of their job. It also suggests a need to invest in programs such as the Accelerated Program for
Compassion Fatigue (ARP), developed by Gentry et al. [44], a five-session model for the treatment
of the deleterious effects caregivers experience as a result of their care giving work [54] through the
promotion of resilience and self-efficacy. Participants in the ARP not only report a reduction in CF
symptoms, they also feel more empowered, more energetic, and have a stronger sense of self-worth.
Designed to reduce the intensity, frequency and duration of symptoms associated with Compassion
Fatigue, ARP aims to help at-risk workers identify symptoms of CF, recognise CF triggers, identify
and utilize existing available resources, review personal and professional history to the present day
to identified those at increased risk, master arousal reduction methods, resolve any impediments to
efficacy, initiate conflict resolution, and initiate a supportive aftercare plan-in collaboration with their
employer or supervisor.
The ARP program borrows from PTSD literature and focuses on the restorative quality of personal
self-awareness and promotes the sharing of stories and debriefing to assist those experiencing CF
in rebuilding their professional and personal life quality. The ARP also advocates the promotion
of self-compassion in order to encourage individuals to challenge a negative internal dialogue and
focus on shifting their automatic thoughts and beliefs to reflect more positive outlook. Finally, the
program promotes the development of a combination of “Resiliency Skills” of “Antibodies” which,
have been shown to be correlated with lessened CF, greater job satisfaction, better quality of life
and lessened anxiety [54,55]. They are as follows: (i) self-care and revitalisation; (ii) connection and
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 618
13 of 18
support; (iii) intentionality, or eradicating stress and shifting from reactive to intentional behavior [56];
(iv) self-regulation, which involves developing the ability to intentionally control the activity and
lessen the energy of the Autonomic Nervous System while engaged in the activities of daily living.
For some, this may prove as simple as relaxing the muscles while encountering the myriad of perceived
threats that emerge throughout each workday; and (v) perceptual maturation, which is a cognitive skill
and involves maturing the perceptions of self towards resiliency and the perceptions of the workplace,
to render them less toxic.
4.4. Limitations
While a thorough search strategy was designed to undertake this systematic review, limitations
should be considered in the interpretation of results. As with any search, despite searching six major
databases, some studies may have been missed. Our search was limited to only search English language
journals, and, therefore, studies published in a language other than English might have missed.
4.5. Implications for Future Research
This review indicates that there is some promising evidence emerging about interventions to
reduce CF, in particular in nurses. However, given the small number of published studies to date,
it is difficult to determine the impact on this or other occupations. The review has shown that in
particular, there is a gap in research conducted in many emergency occupations such as police and fire
fighters, and other health community services such child protection and disability support workers,
and disability and human service workers, and further research is needed using more rigorous study
designs and representative samples. These groups are particularly susceptible to developing CF due
to the nature of their work. In addition, future research could focus on the impact of CF interventions
in a more diverse range of at-risk occupation groups, over-sample younger aged workers and men
in order to the determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce CF, or prevent and
manage known risk factors, in these established at-risk populations.
This can be best understood if we consider CF, or its risk and protective factors BO, STS, and CS, as
upstream determinants of common mental disorders such as a depression and anxiety, the health and
economic cost of which can be considerable within the employed population [57–59]. More specifically,
by reducing the incidence of CF, future cases of depression and anxiety could be prevented, thus
reducing the related health and economic consequences of these conditions. The effectiveness of this
approach was demonstrated in the work of LaMontagne et al. [60], who estimated that the potential
cost saving of eliminating job strain as an avoidable predictor of depression was $730 million AUD for
one year and $11.8 billion AUD over a lifetime. However, it must be noted that, although workplace
psychosocial stressors, such as job strain, have been linked to poor mental and physical health in a
growing body of scientific evidence, the exploration of CF in such a relationship is a relatively newer
concept. Therefore, future work is required to: (i) establish the degree to which, if any, CF increases
a worker’s future risk of depression or anxiety, after accounting for other known risk factors; and
(ii) establish whether CF can be effectively reduced or eliminated by a combination of work- and
worker-directed interventions across occupational groups. Once established, the epidemiological and
economic modelling approach used by LaMontagne et al. [60] could be used to highlight the financial
value of investing in the mental health workers at-risk of CF in addition to the existing legal or moral
motivators, to the ultimate benefit of employers, workers, and the patients and clients they serve.
Furthermore, there has been minimal effort made to apply the aforementioned findings about
health, allied health, and community service workers to reduce CF and its negative health, wellbeing
and safety consequences. Therefore, we recommend a systematic review be conducted to determine
the prevalence of CF across occupation types to assist in identifying those most at risk, and, therefore,
in most need of intervention. Finally, although it is difficult to make definitive conclusions due to the
quality of the evidence in this review, the interventions that contain at least one element of resilience
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 618
14 of 18
training appeared to have the most effect on CF. Therefore, we suggest researchers, employers and
managers consider this when designing interventions to reduce CF in the future.
5. Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first review to attempt to evaluate the evidence of the effectiveness
of CF interventions in at-risk health, emergency and social care professions. Results revealed that,
despite an awareness of the prevalence of CF in these at-risk workers, there is a lack of information
and evidence about effective workplace based strategies to reduce CF in these occupational groups via
modifying its recognised individual and organisational risk factors. Therefore, we recommend more
research to determine how best to protect vulnerable workers in order to prevent CF, as well as the
potentially more significant health and economic consequences related to the subsequent physical and
mental health outcomes.
