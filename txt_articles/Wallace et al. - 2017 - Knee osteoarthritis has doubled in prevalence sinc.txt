Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is believed to be highly prevalent today
because of recent increases in life expectancy and body mass index
(BMI), but this assumption has not been tested using long-term
historical or evolutionary data. We analyzed long-term trends in
knee OA prevalence in the United States using cadaver-derived
skeletons of people aged ≥50 y whose BMI at death was docu-
mented and who lived during the early industrial era (1800s to
early 1900s; n = 1,581) and the modern postindustrial era (late
1900s to early 2000s; n = 819). Knee OA among individuals esti-
mated to be ≥50 y old was also assessed in archeologically derived
skeletons of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and early farmers (6000–
300 B.P.; n = 176). OA was diagnosed based on the presence of
eburnation (polish from bone-on-bone contact). Overall, knee OA
prevalence was found to be 16% among the postindustrial sample
but only 6% and 8% among the early industrial and prehistoric
samples, respectively. After controlling for age, BMI, and other
variables, knee OA prevalence was 2.1-fold higher (95% confi-
dence interval, 1.5–3.1) in the postindustrial sample than in the
early industrial sample. Our results indicate that increases in lon-
gevity and BMI are insufficient to explain the approximate dou-
bling of knee OA prevalence that has occurred in the United States
since the mid-20th century. Knee OA is thus more preventable
than is commonly assumed, but prevention will require research
on additional independent risk factors that either arose or have
become amplified in the postindustrial era.

O
steoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease and a
leading source of chronic pain and disability in the United
States (1) and other developed nations (2). Knee OA accounts
for more than 80% of the disease’s total burden (2) and affects at
least 19% of American adults aged 45 y and older (3). Sub-
stantial evidence indicates that knee OA is proximately caused
by the breakdown of joint tissues from mechanical loading (4)
and inflammation (5), but the deeper underlying causes of knee
OA’s high prevalence remain unclear and poorly tested, hin-
dering efforts to prevent and treat the disease. Two recent public
health trends, however, are commonly assumed to be dominant
factors (6, 7). First, because knee OA’s prevalence increases with
age (8), the rise in life expectancy in the United States since the
early 20th century is thought to have led to high knee OA levels
among the elderly, with the presumption that, as people age,
their senescing joint tissues accumulate more wear and tear from
loading (9). Second, high body mass index (BMI) has become
epidemic in the United States in recent decades and is a well-
known risk factor for knee OA (8), probably because of the
combined effects of joint overloading and adiposity-induced in-
flammation (10). Whether increases in longevity and BMI are
responsible for current knee OA levels has never been tested, but
this assumption has led many to view the disease’s high preva-
lence as effectively unpreventable, since aging is untreatable, and
the high BMI epidemic is intractable (8, 11).
One underused yet potentially powerful way to identify and
assess the risk factors responsible for current knee OA levels is to
examine long-term changes in the disease’s prevalence by com-
paring contemporary with historic and prehistoric populations
(12). Epidemiological studies of present day populations are
valuable but are limited in their ability to analyze risk factors that
are now pervasive but used to be less common. It is difficult to
find large samples of living Americans whose lifestyles, including
physical activity levels and diet, resemble those of past genera-
tions. Although many variables cannot be measured and thus
controlled in epidemiological studies of people living in the past,
a major benefit of analyzing populations over historical and
evolutionary time is to assess known risk factors under different
environmental conditions and thus bring to light the effects of
risk factors that might not be apparent or testable in modern
populations alone. Furthermore, although knee OA is known to
be ancient (12), we know very little about changes in its preva-
lence over time. Low levels of knee OA have been reported for
some historic and prehistoric populations (13–17), suggesting
that the disease’s prevalence has recently increased, but these
studies used different diagnostic criteria than those used to di-
agnose knee OA in living patients, used samples composed mostly
of younger individuals, and did not account for BMI, complicating
comparisons with modern epidemiological data.
Here, we investigate long-term trends in knee OA prevalence
in the United States and evaluate the effects of longevity and
Significance
Knee osteoarthritis is a highly prevalent, disabling joint disease
with causes that remain poorly understood but are commonly
attributed to aging and obesity. To gain insight into the eti-
ology of knee osteoarthritis, this study traces long-term trends
in the disease in the United States using large skeletal samples
spanning from prehistoric times to the present. We show that
knee osteoarthritis long existed at low frequencies, but since
the mid-20th century, the disease has doubled in prevalence.
Our analyses contradict the view that the recent surge in knee
osteoarthritis occurred simply because people live longer and
are more commonly obese. Instead, our results highlight the
need to study additional, likely preventable risk factors that
have become ubiquitous within the last half-century.

 BMI on levels of the disease by comparing the prevalence of
knee OA among people who lived during the early industrial era
(19th to early 20th centuries) with that of people from the
modern postindustrial era (late 20th to early 21st centuries). We
studied knee OA in the largest available collections of cadaver-
derived skeletal remains of people of documented age, BMI, sex,
and ethnicity. To further consider knee OA levels from an evo-
lutionary perspective, we also analyzed knee OA in a large
sample of archeological skeletons of prehistoric Native Ameri-
can hunter-gatherers (6000–300 B.P.) and early farmers (900–
300 B.P.). Although BMI is undocumented for prehistoric skel-
etons, the age at death and sex can be estimated, allowing us to
assess the prevalence of knee OA among older individuals in
these populations. The skeletal collections used in this study are,
by necessity, samples composed of individuals who could not be
randomly selected and for whom we lack comprehensive de-
mographic and contextual information. Despite these limitations,
these samples constitute the best available evidence for knee OA
levels in the United States during earlier time periods to test if
prevalence of the disease is higher today than in the past.
Materials and Methods
Study Samples. The early industrial and postindustrial samples studied in-
cluded complete skeletons of people aged 50 y and older who lived in major
urban areas in the United States (Table S1). All individuals were documented
as being of either European-American or African-American ancestry. Early
industrial individuals (n = 1,581) were inhabitants of Cleveland, Ohio and
St. Louis, Missouri who died between 1905 and 1940. BMI at death was
recorded for 84% of these skeletons (n = 1,334). Postindustrial individuals
(n = 819) lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Knoxville, Tennessee and
died between 1976 and 2015. BMI at death was recorded for 64% of these
skeletons (n = 525). All cadavers were acquired by academic institutions for
the purposes of medical and anatomical education and research. Early in-
dustrial cadavers were of individuals whose bodies were unclaimed at local
morgues or became property of the state; postindustrial cadavers were
gathered through body donation programs. Occupation was documented
for only 23% of individuals (n = 544), but records indicate that differences
between samples reflect shifts in the US workforce between early industrial
and postindustrial times, with the early industrial sample comprising pri-
marily highly physically active laborers and the postindustrial sample in-
cluding more service sector workers with less physically demanding jobs (SI
Text). Cause of death was documented for 80% of individuals (n = 1,918),
and differences between samples evince the epidemiological transition be-
tween early industrial and postindustrial times, with most deaths among
early industrial individuals caused by infectious diseases, such as pneu-
monia and tuberculosis, whereas most deaths among postindustrial indi-
viduals were caused by noninfectious diseases, such as cancer and
atherosclerotic heart disease (SI Text). Skeletons with knee joint articular
surfaces that were severely damaged postmortem were excluded from the
study as were individuals with lower limb amputations.
The prehistoric sample included skeletons from eight archeological sites (in
Alaska, California, New Mexico, Kentucky, and Ohio) of people estimated to
be aged 50 y and older who were hunter-gatherers (n = 116) and early
farmers (n = 60) (Table S1). Only skeletons sufficiently preserved to examine
both the right and left knees were included. Sex assignment was based on
dimorphic characteristics of the pubis that have been shown to be 96%
accurate (18). Individuals were estimated to be ≥50 y old based on age-
related changes in the configuration of the auricular surface of the ilium
(19). This method has been shown to correctly exclude individuals
younger than 50 y of age with 100% accuracy (20). Unfortunately, esti-
mating age precisely beyond 50 y is not possible with available osteo-
logical methods, and it is not possible to estimate accurately BMI at
death from skeletal remains.
Knee OA Diagnosis. Diagnosis of knee OA was based on visual identification of
the presence of eburnation on the articular surfaces of the right or left distal
femur, proximal tibia, or patella. Eburnation is a sclerotic, ivory-like reaction
of subchondral bone that occurs from bone-on-bone contact at sites exposed
by advanced cartilage erosion (12, 21). In pathology studies of skeletal re-
mains, eburnation is considered pathognomonic for moderate to severe OA
(12, 22–24). Although it was not possible to assess knee OA blinded to the
skeleton’s collection of origin, eburnation can be identified with negligible
interobserver variation (SI Text). To avoid false-positive diagnoses, individuals
exhibiting knee eburnation but also osteological signs of non-OA arthritides,
such as rheumatoid arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and
spondyloarthropathy, were excluded. Osteophytes, bone spurs that often
form at the margins of osteoarthritic joints (22–25), were generally large and
expansive on eburnated knees but were not used as a diagnostic criterion
for knee OA because interobserver variation in identifying osteophytes in
skeletal samples is high (26), and they can lead to false-positive diagnoses
(12); also, arthroplasty prostheses were not used to diagnose the disease among
postindustrial individuals. Knee OA prevalence estimates for our samples are
therefore underestimates of total disease prevalence, because they do not
include mild (or early) cases of knee OA [e.g., cases that would be classified
as two on the Kellgren–Lawrence scale (25)] or cases of the disease where
arthroplasty prostheses obscure underlying eburnation.
Statistical Analyses. Log-binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) were
used to estimate adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios for knee OA,
which are reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Prevalence is a
measure of effect size that varies as a function of the values of predictors.
Here, we predict prevalence over a range of values of the predictor of interest
while holding all other covariates constant at the sample mean. A prevalence
ratio is a measure of effect size that is constant over the range of the predictor
of interest while controlling for other covariates. Since prevalence ratios are
multiplicative, they denote a rate of change (percentage change) of the
response per unit increase in the predictor of interest. Model goodness of fit
was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow χ2 test, with significance of in-
dividual estimates determined through two-sided Wald tests with an alpha
level of 0.05 (Table S2).
Three separate GLMs were performed with a binary response variable
indicating presence or absence of knee OA for each individual but including
different explanatory variables. The first analysis included the prehistoric,
early industrial, and postindustrial samples and controlled only for sex effects,
since age and BMI were undocumented for prehistoric individuals. The second
and third analyses included only the early industrial and postindustrial
samples and additionally controlled for age, BMI, and ethnicity. The second
analysis used all available individuals weighted equally, whereas the third
analysis incorporated a subset of individuals who were differentially
weighted based on optimal matching of covariate values between the early
industrial and postindustrial samples. The analysis of matched data was
performed as a sensitivity check to assess whether inferences were robust to
sampling bias between the early industrial and postindustrial samples. This
bias was evidenced by the large differences in average covariate values
between these two samples in the unmatched data (Table 1). The purpose of
matching is to approximate an experimental template, where the matching
procedure mimics blocking before random group assignment to balance
average covariate values between “target” and “comparator” groups.
Separation of the estimation procedure into two steps simulates the re-
search design of an experiment where no information on outcomes is
known at the point of experimental design and randomization. The non-
parametric matching procedure is therefore a data preprocessing step that
replicates a randomized experiment with respect to observed covariates
(27). Preprocessing was achieved by matching individuals from the early
industrial and postindustrial samples that had a similar propensity to be
included in the postindustrial sample based on covariate values (SI Text).
Pruning nonmatches increased similarity in average covariate values be-
tween the early industrial and postindustrial samples (Table 1) and reduced
model dependency and bias (28). Weights for each individual were con-
structed to estimate the average effect of interest on the postindustrial
sample, with the early industrial sample weighted to look like the post-
industrial sample. Analyses were conducted using R, version 3.3.2 (29).
Results
Long-Term Change in Knee OA Prevalence. Across all individuals
analyzed (n = 2,576), the prevalence of knee OA was markedly
higher among individuals from the postindustrial era compared
with individuals from early industrial and prehistoric times, with
females more affected than males (Fig. 1 A and C). After con-
trolling for sex, knee OA prevalence in the postindustrial sample
(16%; 95% CI, 14–19%) was 2.6 times higher (95% CI, 2.1–3.4;
P < 0.001) than in the early industrial sample (6%; 95% CI, 5–
7%) and 2 times higher (95% CI, 1.3–3.3; P = 0.003) than in the
prehistoric sample (8%; 95% CI, 5–13%). Among postindustrial
individuals with knee OA, 42% (64/151) had the disease in both
knees, a 2.5-fold higher proportion (Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.042)

 whom age and BMI were documented (n = 1,859). Individuals
from the postindustrial group were, on average, 6 y older and
had 41% higher BMIs than their early industrial counterparts
(Welch’s t test: P < 0.001 for both the age and BMI comparisons)
(Table 1). Only 1% (13/1,334) of early industrial individuals were
obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 6% (74/1,334) were overweight (25 ≤
BMI < 30) compared with 25% (132/525) and 24% (126/525) of
postindustrial individuals who were obese and overweight, re-
spectively (Fisher’s exact test: P < 0.001 for both the obese and
overweight comparisons). Nevertheless, in a model controlling for
age, BMI, and other variables, knee OA prevalence in the post-
industrial sample (11%; 95% CI, 8–14%) remained 2.1 times higher
(95% CI, 1.5–3.1; P < 0.001) than in the early industrial sample
(5%; 95% CI, 4–7%) (Fig. 1 B and D). Age and BMI were posi-
tively associated with knee OA prevalence (P < 0.001 for both
variables) (Fig. 1D), but at all ages, knee OA prevalence was at least
twice as high in the postindustrial sample than in the early industrial
sample, even after controlling for BMI (Fig. 2).
Temporal Change in Knee OA Prevalence Assessed Using Matched
Samples. Matching individuals from the early industrial and
postindustrial samples by propensity score increased covariate
balance by 99% for age, 100% for BMI, 71% for sex, and 95%
for ethnicity (Table 1). In a model using these matched samples
and additionally controlling for age, BMI, and other variables,
knee OA prevalence in the postindustrial sample (15%; 95% CI,
12–19%) remained approximately twice as high (prevalence ra-
tio: 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5; P < 0.029) compared with the early
industrial sample (8%; 95% CI, 5–13%) (Fig. 1 B and D).
Discussion
To gain insight into the current high prevalence of OA in the
United States and other developed nations, this study examined
long-term trends in knee OA levels in the United States from
prehistoric times through the early industrial era to the modern
postindustrial era. These data show that knee OA long existed at
low frequencies, but since the mid-20th century, knee OA has ap-
proximately doubled in prevalence, even after accounting for the
effects of age and BMI. Our analyses therefore indicate that, al-
though knee OA prevalence has increased over time, today’s high
levels of the disease are not, as commonly assumed, simply an in-
evitable consequence of people living longer and more often hav-
ing a high BMI. Instead, our analyses indicate the presence of
additional independent risk factors that seem to be either unique to
or amplified in the postindustrial era.
Retrospective studies cannot directly test causation, but the
dramatic increase in knee OA prevalence in recent times raises the
question of what these additional risk factors might be. Alleles of
genes, such as GDF5, have been shown to influence knee OA
susceptibility (30), but the approximate doubling of knee OA
prevalence in just the last few generations proves that recent envi-
ronmental changes have played a principal role. The results of this
study are thus clinically significant because they indicate that knee
OA may be more preventable than is currently supposed. Given
evidence that nearly all knee OA is associated with loading-induced
damage to joint tissues (4), either because the loads are abnormal or
the tissues are structurally weak, one especially important source of
environmental change that warrants greater attention is whether
and how joint loading has altered. Trauma has presumably always
predisposed some individuals to knee OA (8), as suggested by the
predominance of unilateral knee OA since prehistoric times (31),
and while joint overloading from high BMI has become common
only recently, our results indicate that the majority of knee OA
today is not caused by high BMI per se. Although altered loads
generated by walking more frequently on hard pavements (32) or
with certain forms of footwear (33) might be factors, another pos-
sibility that merits more study is physical inactivity, which has be-
come epidemic during the postindustrial era. Less physically active
individuals who load their joints less develop thinner cartilage with
lower proteoglycan content (34, 35) as well as weaker muscles re-
sponsible for protecting joints by stabilizing them and limiting joint
reaction forces (36). Chronic low-grade inflammation, which is ex-
acerbated by physical inactivity (37), modern diets rich in highly
refined carbohydrates (38), and excessive adiposity (10), can further
magnify and accelerate loading-induced damage to joint tissues and
may also directly affect knee OA pathogenesis (5). Evaluating which
of these or additional features of modern environments are re-
sponsible for today’s high knee OA levels is necessary.
This study has important limitations that need to be considered.
First, the samples analyzed, although large for their kind, were
constrained by the availability of well-curated skeletal collections in
the United States, and it is plausible that these collections exhibit
levels of knee OA that differ from the actual US population prev-
alence. Second, BMI recorded at death is likely to underestimate
average lifetime BMI, especially for individuals whose cause of
death was associated with somatic wasting. While discrepancy be-
tween lifetime and postmortem BMI introduces error into the re-
lationship between BMI and knee OA, such error is likely to have
been systematic rather than specific to a particular time period.
Third, although it is reasonable to infer that the postindustrial in-
dividuals studied here were, on average, less physically active and
consumed more proinflammatory diets than those from earlier
periods (39), direct data on these and other potential risk factors are
not available for the individuals studied. Fourth, although socio-
economic status was undocumented for individuals in this study,
the early industrial group likely included more relatively low-
income individuals than the postindustrial group. This differ-
ence, however, partly reflects important sociodemographic
shifts that occurred across the epidemiological transition be-
tween time periods (40). Fifth, BMI was unknown for pre-
historic individuals, and although sex is reliably determined, age
estimates beyond 50 y old are imprecise. Thus, the prehistoric
samples could not be included in regression models that used
age and BMI as predictor variables, and although the modal age of
adult death in living hunter-gatherers is 68–78 y old (41), we
cannot reject the hypothesis that knee OA levels are lower among
prehistoric individuals than among postindustrial individuals,
partly because prehistoric individuals were, on average, younger or
had lower BMIs.
Although the causes of OA in general and knee OA in partic-
ular are still not fully understood, the most important conclusion

ANTHROPOLOGY
 of this study is that the recent increase in knee OA levels cannot
simply be considered an inevitable consequence of people living
longer, but instead is the result of modifiable risk factors, in-
cluding but not limited to high BMI, that have become more
common since the mid-20th century. From an evolutionary
perspective, knee OA thus fits the criteria of a “mismatch dis-
ease” that is more prevalent or severe because our bodies are
inadequately or imperfectly adapted to modern environments
(39). Intriguingly, other well-studied mismatch diseases, such as
hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, and type 2 diabetes
(39), that also have become epidemic during the last few decades
are strongly associated with knee OA (42), suggesting com-
mon causes and risk factors. Susceptibility to knee OA and other
mismatch diseases is undoubtedly influenced by intrinsic factors,
including age, sex, and genes, but the historical and evolutionary
perspective afforded by our data underscores that many modern
cases of knee OA may be preventable. Prevention, however, will
require a reappraisal of potential risk factors that have emerged
or intensified only very recently. As with other mismatch dis-
eases, it is likely that any effective prevention strategy will in-
volve adjusting physical activity patterns and diets to approximate
more closely the lifestyle conditions under which our species
evolved.
