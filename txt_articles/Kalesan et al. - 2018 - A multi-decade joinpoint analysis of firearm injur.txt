background Non-fatal firearm injuries constitute 
approximately 70% of all firearm trauma injuries in the 
United States. Patterns of severity of these injuries are 
poorly understood. We analyzed the overall, age-, sex- 
and intent-specific temporal trends in the injury severity 
of firearm hospitalizations from 1993 to 2014.
Methods We assessed temporal trends in the severity 
of patients hospitalized for firearm using Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS) data over a 22 year period. 
Firearm hospitalization was identified using assault 
(E965x), unintentional (E922x), intentional self-harm 
(E955x), legal (E970) and undetermined (E985x) 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD9) codes. Injury severity was 
measured using the computed New Injury Severity Score 
(NISS). We used survey weighted means, SD and annual 
percent change (APC), and joinpoint regression to 
analyze temporal trends.
results A weighted total of 648 662 inpatient 
admissions for firearm injury were analyzed. Firearm 
injury severity demonstrated a significant annual increase 
of 1.4% (95% CI=1.3 to 1.6), and was driven by annual 
increases among young adults (APC=1.4%, 95% 
CI=1.3 to 1.5), older adults (APC=1.5%, 95% CI=1.3 
to 1.6), female (APC=1.5%, 95% CI=1.3 to 1.6) and 
male (APC=1.4%, 95% CI=1.3 to 1.6) hospitalizations. 
The annual increase among assault/legal injuries was 
1.4% (95% CI=1.3 to 1.5), similar to unintentional 
(APC=1.4%, 95% CI=1.3 to 1.6), intentional self-harm 
(APC=1.5%, 95% CI=1.4 to 1.6) and undetermined 
(APC=1.4%, 95% CI=1.3 to 1.6).
Conclusions The severity of hospitalized firearm injuries 
increased significantly from 1993 to 2014. This annual 
increase reflects a move towards hospitalization of more 
serious injuries, and outpatient management of less 
serious injuries across the board, suggesting a mounting 
burden on the US healthcare system.
Level of evidence Level IV.
bACkground
The majority of injuries related to traumatic inju-
ries caused by firearms in the US result in non-fatal 
firearm hospitalizations.1 2 Roughly 30% of these 
people will die after being shot, about 30% are 
treated and discharged from hospital emergency 
departments, and the roughly 40% who remain 
sustain more severe injuries and are hospitalized for 
further treatment.3 4 Injury severity is often greater 
among firearm hospitalizations as compared with 
other traumatic injury hospitalizations.5 6 
National data that have accumulated for over two 
decades may now permit new analyses and a new 
understanding of previously unreported, long-term 
trends and changes in firearm hospitalization.7 8 
We broadly know that national firearm hospital-
izations rates per 100 
000 hospitalizations declined 
after the year 2000 and there has been little change 
in assault-related firearm hospitalizations in that 
same time period.8 9 We also know that there are 
substantial age-, gender- and intent-specific differ-
ences in firearm hospitalizations.3 8 10 Most firearm 
hospitalizations victims are male and most firearm 
hospitalizations are due to assault. Younger adults 
between the age of 16 and 45 years hospitalized 
for firearm injury were more likely to be injured by 
assault7 11 as compared with older adults who are 
hospitalized for self-inflicted injuries.12Older youth 
between 16–19 years of age had firearm injury 
profile similar to that of adults,13 particularly with 
respect to firearm homicide rates.
However, very little is known regarding the 
patterns of injury severity in firearm hospitaliza-
tions over time, and by age, sex and intent of injury 
subgroups. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
analyze temporal trends in injury severity of firearm 
injury hospitalization over a multi-decade period. 
We also assessed the magnitude of firearm hospital-
izations and compared the differences in temporal 
trends of injury severity across age, sex, and intent 
of injury subgroups.

data source
We used inpatient hospitalization dataset, the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare 
Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality from 1993 to 
2014.14 The NIS data are nationally representa-
tive claims based data and contains information on 
hospital stays in 1000 hospitals sampled to represent 
a 20% stratified sample of US community hospitals 
from 47 states. Survey weights are provided to esti-
mate weighted counts and estimates. Trend weights 
are provided for calculation of trends. We used 
trend weights for the analysis. Each year of the NIS 
provides information on approximately 9 
million 
inpatients records.
study design
This study used a subset of all firearm hospitaliza-
tions from NIS from 1993 to 2014 and we used 
a repeated cross-sectional study design to assess 
temporal trends of injury severity of firearm

study cohort
The flow chart of data inclusion and exclusion is represented in 
online supplementary figure 1. There was a total of 789 782 871 
weighted hospitalizations from 1993 to 2014. First, we excluded 
524 
270 hospitalizations, that were missing information on age, 
leading to remaining 789,258,601 hospitalizations. Second, we 
restricted in each year of NIS, those hospitalizations that had 
a secondary diagnosis International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes (ICD-9 CM) of 
assault (E9650, E9651, E9652, E9653, E9654), unintentional 
(E9220, E9221, E9222, E9223, E9224, E9228, E9229), inten-
tional self-harm (E9550, E9551, E9552, E9553, E9554, E9556, 
E9559), legal (E970), war (E991) and undetermined (E9850, 
E9851, E9852, E9853, E9854, E9856) traumatic injuries. All 
injuries are captured as secondary diagnosis codes. For analytical 
purposes, we included legal under the assault category. There-
fore, we excluded 788 535 952 non-firearm hospitalizations 
resulting in 722 
649 firearm hospitalizations. We restricted the 
firearm hospitalizations to those admitted from ER, in attempt 
to use only those hospitalizations that are new events rather 
than a re-hospitalization due to a prior firearm injury. After 
excluding those hospitalizations admitted without a prior ER 
visit (n=73 
987), the final weighted count of firearm hospital-
izations was 648 
662. Each record refers to a single hospitaliza-
tion; as a result, a person may have multiple hospitalizations, 
and unique patient records may not be identified.
Variables
We used Computed New Injury Severity Score (NISS) as a 
measure of overall injury severity on a continuous scale.15–17 NISS 
is a continuous variable measuring the firearm injury severity 
ranging from 0 to 75.16 Age groups used in the analysis were 
0–15 (pediatric), 16–45 (young adult) and 46 and older (older 
adults) and sex into two groups of male and female. Intent of 
injury was categorized into assault (includes legal intervention), 
intentional self-harm, unintentional and undetermined.
The other patient variables we used were race/ethnicity, 
defined in NIS data as white (non-Hispanic white), black, 
Hispanic, other (includes Asian or Pacific Islander, Native 
American and others), and unknown (which have missing 
race/ethnicity data), type of insurance (private insurance/
Medicare, self-pay, and Medicaid/no charge/other), median 
neighborhood income quartiles ($1–$24,999, $25,000–
$34,999, $35,000–$44,999, $45 000 and above) and co-mor-
bidities. Elixhauser comorbidity score was calculated from 29 
co-morbidities identified based on ICD-9 CM codes.18 The 
hospital-level characteristics were location (rural and urban), 
teaching status (teaching and non-teaching), size of the hospital 
(small, medium and large) and US census regions (Northeast, 
Midwest, South and West).
statistical analysis
First we used package ICDPIC Version 3.0 to calculate the 
new injury severity scores, NISS, for each firearm hospital-
izations in each NIS data from 1993 to 2014.19 We used the 
primary scores of NISS for further analyses. Second, we used 
survey weighted multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear 
model (Gaussian family) with NISS as a linear dependent 
variable, year as a factor term and stratum as the random 
coefficient. We then obtained Bayesian shrinkage estimates as 
a way to decrease classification error of stratum, by shrinking 
the estimates towards the average estimated effect in each 
stratum.20 Third, we assessed the breakpoints and temporal 
changes in injury severity of firearm hospitalizations from 
1993 to 2014 using Joinpoint Regression Programme version 
4.5.0.1.21 Joinpoint regression is used to assess temporal 
trends by using an algorithm to test whether a segmented line 
is significantly better than a straight line. The regression is 
performed on a log scale and the points where the segments 
joint is called joinpoints or breakpoints. We used the predicted 
shrinkage Bayes estimates to calculate the annual mean, the log 
of the annual mean and the SE for Joinpoint analysis. For the 
Joinpoint analysis, the minimum number of observations from 
a joinpoint to either end of the data (excluding first or last 
joinpoint if it falls on an observation) was set 2. The number 
of points to place between adjacent observed x values in the 
grid search was set at 0. The number of joinpoints were set 
ranging from 0 to 4. The model selection method was based on 
permutation test, where the overall significance level was set 
at 0.05, and the number of randomly permuted data sets was 
4499. Fourth, annual percent change (APC) was obtained for 
each segment along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). 
All P values were two-sided and significance level was <0.05. 
STATA MP 14.2 (StataCorp LP
, College Station, Texas; 2009) 
was used for data analyses.
resuLTs
descriptive characteristics
Between 1993 and 2014, there were a weighted total of 
648 
662 inpatient admissions of firearm injury. The majority 
were of assaultive intent (389 
506, 60.1%), followed by unin-
tentional (n=157 
225, 24.2%), intentional self-harm (55 601, 
8.6%) and undetermined (46 330, 7.1%). Table 1 presents the 
overall demographic characteristics of firearm hospitalizations 
and by 4 
year time periods. firearm hospitalizations were more 
likely to be between 16–45 years of age, black, men, reported 
to have either private or Medicare as private insurance, from 
low income neighborhoods. The characteristics of the hospi-
tals where firearm injuries were treated were more likely to be 
urban, teaching, large and located in the south of the country. 
Each comorbidity by the same time periods are presented in 
online supplementary table 1.
distribution of firearm hospitalizations
Of the 648 
662 firearm hospitalizations, 5.6% were among chil-
dren, 82.3% among young adults and 12.1% among older adults. 
Across the years the proportion of those 0–15 
year-old firearm 
hospitalizations ranged from 7.7% in 1993 to 3.7% in 2014, 
among 16–45 
year-old firearm hospitalizations ranged from 
84.6% to 78.7% and among >=46 
year-old firearm hospitaliza-
tions ranged from 7.7% to 17.5%. The weighted stacked propor-
tions of firearm hospitalizations across the years by age group 
are presented in online supplementary figure 2. The proportion 
of firearm hospitalizations that were male ranged from 88.6% 
in 1993 to 88.1% in 2014 and that were female ranged from 
11.4% to 11.9% in the respective years. The weighted stacked 
proportions of firearm hospitalizations across the years by sex 
are presented in online supplementary figure 3. The weighted 
stacked proportions of firearm hospitalizations across the years 
by intent of injury are presented in online supplementary figure 
4. Assault/legal firearm hospitalizations ranged from 55.6% to 
58.9%, unintentional firearm hospitalizations from 30.6% to

findings. First, both males and females and all types of intents 
of firearm injury demonstrated a comparable significant increase 
in national trends in firearm hospitalizations injury severity. 
Second, although the magnitude of injury severity was lower in 
children than adults, there were increasing temporal trends in 
injury severity from 1998 to 2014 among children as compared 
with a consistent increase among adults.
Our main finding of increasing severity of injury among 
firearm hospitalizations across years was concordant with a 
smaller study that assessed fatalities and severity of firearm inju-
ries at one city trauma center from 2000 to 20134 and other 
studies that showed increasing injury severity among other 
forms of injury related hospitalizations over time.22–24 Another 
trauma center study reported a similar uptrend of severity in 
an urban pediatric population.25 The increase in firearm injury 
severity observed in our study is in concordance with an increase 
in length of stay reported using the same nationally representa-
tive hospitalization data in another study.26 Increasing lethality 
of civilian firearms, such as increase in the caliber of pistols may 
be another explanation in the observed increase in severity of 
firearm injuries.27 This finding is consequential in the context of 
an increasing national non-fatal firearm injury rate.2 Increasing 
severity of firearm injuries, potentially reflects both changes in 
firearm injury and in hospitalization patterns, may result in long 
term morbidity and disability, thereby increasing overall health-
care costs.
Our study also demonstrated comparable increasing trends 
among both men and women and in all intents of injury. 
However, we also found that the proportion of these subgroup 
firearm hospitalizations differed greatly. About 88% of firearm 
hospitalizations were male, which is similar to majority of studies 
that reported a similar proportion to be males.2 28 We found that 
majority of firearm hospitalizations were of assault and unin-
tentional intent. Our finding of increasing injury severity during 
this study time period being driven by the increasing trends of 
injury severity among assault firearm hospitalizations is similar 
to a finding about firearm hospitalization attributed to assaul-
tive firearm injuries in a study using national hospitalization 
data.8 Our findings are also in concordance with the overall 
increasing severity related to firearm injury and may be due 
both to better medical care that saves more lives, resulting in 
increasing severity of injuries in firearm hospitalizations,29 30 and 
injuries being better treated and discharged in the emergency 
room and trauma centers without being hospitalized.28 31 Inten-
tional self-harm firearm hospitalizations have a slightly greater 
injury severity and may be explained by the results of a study 
that used data over 5 
year period of gunshot to the brain that 
found an increasing survival rate from 10% to 46% with aggres-
sive management,31 which is also indicative of the potential long-
term physical and health consequences in the context of very 
severe injuries.
We report changes in temporal trends only among children 
with a large annual increase between 1993 and 1995, which then 
plateaued briefly between 1995 and 1998 and followed by a 
more steady but smaller annual increase from 1998 to 2014. The 
large increase may be indicative of acute care improvements in 
trauma centers.31 Our results are concordant with a retrospective 
review of assault in children admitted to trauma centers found 
that the risk of mortality was high among children, suggestive 
of an increased injury severity among children.32 Additionally, 
an analysis of emergency room visits found that firearm injuries 
increased 31.7% between 2006 and 2012,33 corroborating our 
results of increasing injury severity on subsequent hospitaliza-
tion. The increase in such injuries in our study among young 
adults indicates the potential for prolonged disability and loss of 
productivity in young people.
Additionally, our investigation indicates that more than half of 
the firearm hospitalizations are assaultive firearm injuries corrob-
orating other reports using hospitalization data and overall 
non-fatal data.2 8 Recent reports have reported that the increase 
in assault related non-fatal firearm injuries are an artifact of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) publicly 
available non-fatal data due to systematic error in misclassifi-
cation of 40% of assault injuries as undetermined injuries from 
just two hospitals.34 35 Our results using firearm hospitalizations 
indicate the reverse, demonstrating an increasing proportion of 
assault-related firearm hospitalizations from 55.6% to 58.9% of 
all firearm hospitalizations along with a decline in undetermined 
injuries from 9.1% to 4.6% from 1993 to 2014. Therefore, our 
results remain in concordance with the reports using the publicly 
available CDC data.
Our results should be interpreted with caution due to some 
limitations. The central limitation is the lack of patient specific 
identifiers to identify index versus re-hospitalizations that is 
inherent in the design of such nationally representative claims 
based surveys that are exclusively based on hospitalizations alone. 
Firearm injury has a high risk of re-hospitalizations especially in 
patients with greater severity, which increases their likelihood of 
rehospitalizations.36 A second limitation is the lack of detailed 
integrated information regarding emergency department visits, 
where they were treated and released without hospitalization. 
Of all the non-fatal firearm injuries, about 40% are treated 
and released in the emergency department, while the rest are 
hospitalized. Improvement of trauma care and policies may have 
contributed to changes in hospitalization from emergency room 
treatment across the years. A third limitation is the missing race/
ethnicity information that ranges between 31.2% to 5.2% from 
1993 to 2014. That limits further exploration by race/ethnicity. 
The fourth limitation is that the enrolment of states was not 
similar across years; there were fewer states in earlier years. A 
final limitation is that the NISS, and the older injury severity 
score from which it evolved, have also potentially changed in 
usage and application over time, as has potentially the recording 
of anatomic injury information that is used to calculate these 
scores.37 Although the findings here may represent temporal 
trends in enhanced medical recorder skills, it is unlikely that this 
played a large role in what we found given the long-standing 
standardization of and education around the recording of injury 
and ICD data.
In conclusion, our data show growing injury severity among 
firearm hospitalizations over time. The increase in severity of 
firearm injury hospitalizations from 1993 to 2014 suggests an 
increasing healthcare burden related to firearm violence survi-
vorship. This increasing challenge is primarily driven by assaul-
tive intent particularly among young adults. It seems likely 
that these shifts reflect a move towards hospitalization of more 
serious injuries,22–25 and outpatient management of less serious 
injuries across the board.
