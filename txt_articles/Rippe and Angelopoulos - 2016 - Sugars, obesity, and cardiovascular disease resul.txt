sucrose. The purpose of this review is to present data from 
recent RCTs and findings from recent systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses related to sugar consumption and its 
putative health effects. This review evaluates findings from 
recent randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses into the relationship of sugar consumption 
and a range of health-related issues including energy-reg-
ulating hormones, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
and accumulation of liver fat and neurologic responses. 
Data from these sources do not support linkages between 
sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet 
and various adverse metabolic and health-related effects.

The world is in the midst of twin epidemics of obesity and 
diabetes often lumped together as diabesity (T2D) [1–6]. It 
has been estimated that there are over one billion individuals 
worldwide who are currently obese [1]. This number is antici-
pated to rise to 1.5 billion individuals by the year 2030 if cur-
rent trends continue [1]. In the USA, it has been estimated 
that 33.8 % of adults, over 66 million individuals, are obese, 
while an additional 74 million are overweight [7]. The preva-
lence of obesity grew a shocking 40 % over the last 30 years 
[8]. The obesity epidemic is truly global. In European coun-
tries, obesity ranges from 20 to 30 % and is even higher in 
Australia, South America, Middle-East, and Polynesia [1].
The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 
there are over 300 million individuals currently living with 
diabetes [5]. This number is predicted to double by the 
year 2035 [6, 7]. Heart disease remains the leading cause 
of mortality worldwide and accounts for over 37 % of all 
mortality in the USA on an annual basis [9]. Non-alcoholic 
Abstract  The relationship between sugar consumption 
and various health-related sequelas is controversial. Some 
investigators have argued that excessive sugar consump-
tion is associated with increased risk of obesity, coronary 
heart disease, diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome, non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, and stimulation of reward 
pathways in the brain potentially causing excessive caloric 
consumption. These concerns have influenced organiza-
tions such as the World Health Organization, the Scientific 
Advisory Committee on Nutrition in England not to exceed 
5 % of total energy and the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans Advisory Committee 2015 to recommend upper limits 
of sugar consumption not to exceed 10 % of calories. Data 
from many randomized control trials (RCTs) do not sup-
port linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels 
within the human diet and various adverse metabolic and 
health-related effects. Fructose and glucose are typically 
consumed together in roughly equal proportions from high-
fructose corn syrup (also known as isoglucose in Europe) or

fatty liver disease (NAFLD) now represents the leading 
cause of liver failure and the need for liver transplantation 
worldwide [10, 11]. Multiple studies have now showed that 
these metabolic conditions are inter-related.
With these grim statistics in mind, it is not surprising 
that investigators have looked at various aspects of nutri-
tion to delineate potential underlying associations and 
causes and recommend possible ways of ameliorating these 
inter-related metabolic conditions. Recent attention has 
been focused on the consumption of sugars, in general, and 
fructose containing sugars in particular [12, 13]. Some epi-
demiologic studies have linked consumption of added sug-
ars to increased risk of weight gain and obesity [14–16], 
increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
[17] including hypertension [18–20] and dyslipidemia [21, 
22], and increased risk factors for diabetes [23–25].
Potential linkages between added sugars and various 
diseases have not only public health implications, but also 
impact on public policy. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that added 
sugars should constitute no more than 5 % of overall calo-
rie consumption [26]. The Scientific Advisory Commit-
tee on Nutrition in England (SACN) [27] has also recom-
mended an upper limit not to exceed 5 %, while the 2015 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2015 DGAC) in 
the USA has recommended an upper limit not to exceed 
10 % of calories [28]. The Food and Drug Administration 
in the USA has followed the lead of the 2015 DGAC and 
recommended an upper limit of no more than 10 % of calo-
ries from added sugars [29]. In contrast, the European Food 
Safety Authority (EFSA) [30] found no harm in fructose 
consumption up to 25 % of total calories which is also con-
sistent with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) carbohydrate 
report which found no harm in fructose containing sugars 
up to 25 % of calories [31].
In this contentious and controversial debate, it is impor-
tant that members of the scientific community have to 
stand on firm ground and base opinions on the best avail-
able science. The purpose of the current review is to pro-
vide evidence from recent randomized controlled trials 
conducted in our research laboratory and others as well as 
findings from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
related to sugar consumption and its putative health effects. 
We conclude that high quality evidence does not support 
a unique link between added sugars and various adverse 
health effects when consumed at normal levels, particularly 
in isocaloric settings.
Theoretical concerns
It has been known for many years that fructose and glucose 
are handled differently in the human body. Ninety percent 
of fructose is metabolized in the liver on first pass [32]. 
In contrast, glucose can be metabolized in multiple cells 
throughout the human body. Both fructose and glucose are 
transported into hepatocytes utilizing the facilitator glucose 
transporter GLUT2. Once inside the hepatic cells, however, 
the pathways for metabolism for fructose and glucose are 
considerably different.
First, fructose does not increase glycemia in contrast 
to glucose and, hence, does not stimulate insulin release. 
Fructose is phosphorylated into fructose-1-phosphate with 
phosphate donated by ATP which is metabolized into ADP 
and ultimately to AMP and finally to uric acid. The accu-
mulation of uric acid has been argued to play a role in the 
development of high blood pressure [33]. This will be dis-
cussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this review. 
Fructose is phosphorylated by the enzyme fructokinase and 
subsequently cleaved into the triokinase phosphorylates 
glyceraldehyde to glyceraldehyde phosphate. It is impor-
tant to note that at the level of glyceraldehyde phosphate, 
the metabolism of fructose and glucose metabolism is 
interactive [32]. Fructose cannot be utilized for cells in the 
body, and thus, there are pathways to convert it into glucose 
and other metabolizable molecules. Over half of fructose is 
converted to glucose, another 15 % to glycogen, 15–20 % 
to lactate, and a few percent to carbon dioxide [32]. This 
has been demonstrated in multiple tracer studies as sum-
marized by Sun and Empie [34]. A small percentage of 
ingested fructose can ultimately be converted into free fatty 
acids which are ultimately packaged into triglycerides (TG) 
and carried into the blood stream complexed with very low-
density lipoprotein (VLDL). The amount of fatty acids that 
are produced through this mechanism called de novo lipo-
genesis has been estimated in elegant studies by Hellerstein 
et al. [35] to be on the order of 1–5 % of ingested fructose 
even under settings of extreme overfeeding. The amount of 
fat produced though this process is in the order of one gram 
per day compared to the 100–125 g typically consumed 
each day in the human diet. Nonetheless, some investiga-
tors have argued that de novo lipogenesis is an important 
pathway leading from fructose consumption to fatty liver 
and insulin resistance.
Energy‑regulating hormones
The differences in metabolism between fructose and glu-
cose in humans have led a number of investigators to 
explore the impact of these two monosaccharides on 
energy-regulating hormones including insulin, leptin, and 
ghrelin [36, 37]. Teff et al. [36] reported that consuming 
either fructose sweetened beverages or glucose sweetened 
beverages at the level of 25 % of calories was resulted in 
lowering of 24 h concentrations of circulating insulin, 
 S47
Eur J Nutr (2016) 55 (Suppl 2):S45–S53 
1 3
glucose, and leptin and decreased postprandial suppression 
of plasma ghrelin concentrations. Other investigators have 
utilized a similar model in overweight or obese subjects 
and demonstrated that fructose sweetened beverages, when 
compared to glucose sweetened beverages, when consumed 
at 25 % of energy, were resulted in increased postprandial 
triglyceride concentrations in overweight/obese subjects 
compared to normal weight subjects [37]. These effects 
were more pronounced in men than women. It should be 
noted that in this model, the sugars are given as monosac-
charides—namely, either glucose or fructose— despite the 
fact that neither of these monosaccharides is consumed 
in isolation to any appreciable degree in the human diet. 
This has created confusion since a number of scientists 
have speculated that these observed differences in energy-
regulating hormones could create an environment resulting 
in increased hunger, food consumption, and obesity when 
consuming fructose [38, 39].
The differences between fructose and glucose effects on 
energy-regulating hormones have also led to further specu-
lation that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) might be more 
obesogenic than sucrose. This speculation was based on 
the misperception that HFCS contains considerable higher 
amounts of fructose when compared to sucrose. The proper 
comparison, however, is HFCS (isoglucose) versus sucrose 
since both contain approximately 50 % of fructose and 
50 % of glucose. (HFCS-55, which is the most commonly 
utilized form of HFCS in beverages, contains 55 % of fruc-
tose, while HFCS-42, which is the most commonly utilized 
form of HFCS in baked goods and other applications, con-
tains 42 % fructose [40]. The rest of both of these forms of 
HFCS is glucose or glucose polymers).
Our research laboratory has conducted four trials look-
ing at the effects of either HFCS vs sucrose or HFCS vs 
sucrose, glucose or fructose on energy-regulating hor-
mones. In the trial published by Melanson et al. [41], we 
demonstrated that there we no different acute impacts 
(24 h) when comparing 25 % of calories either from 
HFCS or sucrose on insulin, glucose, leptin, or ghrelin in 
non-smoking women 20–60 years of age with body mass 
indexes of 19–25 kg/m2. Subsequent research trials in our 
laboratory evaluated energy-regulating hormones in obese 
individuals and found no differences between HFCS and 
sucrose [42].
A third study in our laboratory showed that there were 
no differences when comparing 8 % of calories from either 
HFCS or sucrose (25th percentile population consump-
tion level) to 18 % of calories from these two sugars (50th 
population level in the United States) and 30 % of calories 
from these two sugars (90th percentile population con-
sumption level) over a 10 week period [43]. We have subse-
quently shown that there are no differences in energy-regu-
lating hormone responses when comparing average levels 
of consumption of fructose (9 % of calories to glucose, 9 % 
of calories from glucose, 18 % of calories from HFCS or 
sucrose), (unpublished data). Thus, assertions that meta-
bolic differences between fructose and glucose can lead to 
an environment that promotes weight gain and obesity must 
be treated with extreme caution particularly when these 
two monosaccharides are evaluated at levels far beyond the 
normal human consumption level and in isolation in con-
trast to how they are normally consumed in the human diet 
which is invariably together.
Sugars and obesity
The modern concern about a potential role of sugars as a 
unique cause for obesity seems to have originated with a 
review article published in the American Journal of Clini-
cal Nutrition in 2004 by Bray, Nielsen and Popkin [39]. 
This article raised the provocative question of whether 
there was a unique relationship between HFCS consump-
tion and the rapid increase in the obesity epidemic in the 
USA. These researchers noted a temporal relationship 
between increasing consumption of HFCS and obesity 
and argued that the metabolism of fructose could result in 
increased likelihood of overconsumption of calories lead-
ing to obesity and associated metabolic diseases including 
CVD, T2D, and metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Multiple subsequent studies from research laboratories 
have not demonstrated any unique properties of HFCS 
compared to sucrose with regard to energy-regulating hor-
mones, appetite or weight gain both in normal weight and 
obese individuals [41, 43–45]. Both the Academy of the 
Nutrition and Dietetics [46] and the American Medical 
Association [47] have issued statements concluding that 
there are no differences between HFCS and sucrose with 
regard to the likelihood of causing obesity.
The literature related to sugars and obesity has subse-
quently shifted to a consideration of whether any fructose 
containing sugars such as sucrose, HFCS, or concentrated 
fruit juices may contribute to obesity. Several meta-analy-
ses have suggested that sugar sweetened soft drinks (SSBs) 
are associated with weight gain and obesity in both chil-
dren and adults [14, 15]. There have been three recent sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs on sugar con-
sumption or SSB consumption and body weight [48–50]. 
These trials have suggested that increasing energy con-
sumption by increasing sugar intake in adults may lead to 
modest weight gain; however, the weight gain appears to 
be due to the increased energy consumption rather than any 
unique aspect of sugars per se.
The systematic review and meta-analysis by Te Morenga 
et al. [49] included 30 randomized controlled trials (19 of 
which were ad libitum and 11 were isoenergetic) and 38 
 S48
Eur J Nutr (2016) 55 (Suppl 2):S45–S53
1 3
prospective cohort studies. The “ad libitum” randomized 
controlled trials and cohort studies agreed with each other 
that when individuals either reduced or increased sugar 
consumption a “small but significant” effect on body 
weight occurred. On average, individuals in the ad libitum 
trials and cohorts studies lost 0.8 kg and when they reduced 
their sugar intake, and gained an average of 0.75 kg when 
they increased their sugar consumption. The 11 isoca-
loric trials, however, showed no association between body 
weight change and sugar intake. This caused these inves-
tigators to conclude “the most obvious mechanism by 
which increased sugars might promote weight gain is by 
increasing energy consumption to an extent that exceeds 
energy output and restores energy balance… we observed 
that isoenergetic replacement of dietary sugars with other 
macronutrients resulted in no change in weight. This find-
ing strongly suggested that energy balance is a major deter-
minant of the potential for dietary sugars to influence meas-
ures of body fatness… the data suggests that the change in 
body fatness that occurs from modifying intake of sugars 
results from in alteration in energy balance rather than 
physiologic or metabolic consequence of monosaccharides 
or disaccharides.” [49].
It should also be noted that between 1970 and 2010 
in the USA average total energy intake increased by 474 
calories per person [51]. Virtually all of this increase in 
energy intake (approximately 94 %) can be attributed to an 
increase in flour and cereal products and added fats, while 
added sugars only contributed 7 % of the total increased 
caloric intake. Thus, data related to added sugar intake as 
a potential significant contributor to weight gain and obe-
sity must be treated with great caution. Moreover, public 
policy attempts to limit sugar consumption as a mechanism 
for helping individuals control weight seem unlikely to 
succeed.
Sugars and cardiovascular disease
There are, to our knowledge and for obvious reasons, no 
reported RCTs examining the effect of sugar consump-
tion on CHD itself. Three prospective cohort studies have 
examined the association between SSB consumption and 
incident of CHD [52–54]. Eshak et al. [52] reported a large 
prospective cohort study and found no association between 
SSB consumption and myocardial infarction. de Kon-
ing et al. [53] reported data from the Male Health Profes-
sional Follow-up Study and found a significant association 
between CHD events and the highest quintile of SSB con-
sumption compared to the lowest. Fung et al. [54] reported 
data from the Nurses’ Health Study and found significant 
elevated risks associated with CHD comparing greater than 
or equal to two servings of SSB per day compared to <1 
serving per month. Te Morenga and colleagues reported 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 trials most 
of which had high levels of sugar consumption—typi-
cally >95th percentile population consumption [55]. These 
investigators reported no increase in systolic blood pressure 
and a small increase in diastolic blood pressure although 
the absolute value of increase was low (1.4 mmHg).
Most RCTs exploring sugars and CHD have focused on 
risk factors for CHD rather than CHD itself.
Blood pressure
Several RCTs have examined whether fructose itself or 
fructose containing sugars contribute to increased blood 
pressure. Brown et al. [56] administered 15 subjects an 
acute load of fructose (60 g in 500 mL of water), glucose, 
or pure water and found a significant increase (approxi-
mately 3 mmHg) over the 120 min of the study following 
fructose consumption compared with either glucose or 
water. Raben et al. [57] randomly assigned 21 overweight 
individuals to supplements of either sucrose or artificial 
sweeteners for 10 weeks. Blood pressure increased more 
in the sucrose group than the group consuming artificial 
sweeteners. These data, however, are confounded by the 
fact that these individuals also gained on an average 2.6 kg 
more than controls.
Other studies have not found increases in blood pressure 
related to fructose administration. These include studies 
by Le et al. [58], Maersk et al. [59], and studies from our 
research laboratory at levels up to the 90th percentile popu-
lation consumption level of fructose which have not shown 
increases in blood pressure [60–62]. Moreover, Ha et al. 
[63] performed a meta-analysis of 13 randomized and non-
randomized controlled feeding trials where subjects were 
given an isocaloric exchange of fructose for carbohydrates 
and found no increases in blood pressure.
Lipids
A number of studies have explored the potential linkage 
between consumption of added sugars and dyslipidemia 
[55, 64, 65]. As a result of these studies, the American 
Heart Association recommended restricting consumption of 
fructose containing sugars as a mechanism for controlling 
triglycerides (TGs) [66]. Data to support this, however, are 
inconclusive [67–69]. In isocaloric trials, even large doses 
of fructose containing sugars have been reported to not 
show lipid abnormalities [70]. In hypercaloric trials, how-
ever, in which fructose was supplemented to background 
diets thereby creating excess energy, increases in LDL cho-
lesterol and triglycerides have been reported [67–69]. In 
RCTs in our laboratory individuals who consumed either 
sucrose or HFCS at 10 or 20 % of calories in an isocaloric 
 S49
Eur J Nutr (2016) 55 (Suppl 2):S45–S53 
1 3
diet over 10 weeks in a free living trial, no increases in total 
cholesterol, TGs, or LDL cholesterol [71] occurred. In a 
mildly hypercaloric trial, however, a 10 % increase in TGs 
occurred driven largely by individuals who consumed 30 % 
of those calories from either HFCS or sucrose [60, 61].
Despite the conflicting data in this area, the American 
Heart Association has issued guidelines recommending that 
males consume no more than 150 kcals each day of added 
sugars and females no more than 100 kcals [72]. (These 
recommendations limit sugars to 5–7 % of total calories). 
The 2015 DGAC [28] recommended the upper limit of cal-
ories from added sugars to not exceed 10 % citing evidence 
for increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with 
added sugar consumption as “moderate.” Given the mixed 
nature of RCTs and meta-analyses in this area, however, it 
appears that these recommendations should be taken with 
considerable caution.
Sugars and diabetes
To our knowledge, there are no RCTs examining the effect 
of sugars on diabetes. Therefore, studies that have been 
relied upon to suggest a linkage between sugars and diabe-
tes are either lower forms of evidence, (e.g., epidemiologic 
and ecological studies) or studies which explore risk fac-
tors for diabetes.
Several recent ecological analyses have reported that the 
prevalence of diabetes is correlated with sugar consumption 
in various countries [24, 25]. Ecological analyses, however, 
are considered to be a weak form of evidence. Furthermore, 
as pointed out by Van Buul et al. [73] in one of these stud-
ies, in European countries, the authors confused sugar con-
sumption with sugar production. In European Union coun-
tries, commodities such as sugar flow freely across borders 
thus production is very different from consumption. Fur-
thermore, other ecologic analyses have shown markedly dif-
ferent results. For example, in Australia, a 10 % decrease in 
the contribution of sugar in beverages has recently occurred 
despite increases in obesity and diabetes [74]. This has been 
labeled the “Australian Paradox.” Similar “paradoxes” have 
been seen in the USA [75] and Canada where a 15 % sugar 
consumption decline has occurred over the past decade, 
while both obesity and diabetes have increased.
Prospective cohort studies provide mixed evidence con-
cerning sugar consumption and diabetes [16, 76]. Malik 
et al. [16] reported a meta-analysis of cohort studies related 
to SSBs and incident diabetes. Of the eight studies these 
investigators reported, four did not find a significant effect 
of SSBs on the incidence of diabetes and five did not adjust 
findings for energy intake and body weight. Moreover, 
another study published by the same group did not show a 
relationship between sugar consumption and diabetes risk 
[76]. A study reported from the US Professionals Health 
Study Follow-Up cohort showed no association between 
SSB consumption and diabetes once data were adjusted for 
total energy intake [77].
Meta-analyses also have generated few data to support 
an association between sugar intake and diabetes [78–80]. 
Cozma et al. [81] reported a systematic review and meta-
analysis of RCTs and non-randomized controlled trials of 
fructose and diabetes and reported no adverse impact on 
glycemic control. Most randomized controlled studies in 
non-diabetic patients where sucrose or fructose have been 
substituted in a control diet have not shown adverse effects 
of multiple risk factors for diabetes [82–86].
Insulin resistance is an established risk factor with dia-
betes often preceding T2D by 10–20 years [87]. A recent 
research trial reported by our laboratory compared three 
fructose containing sugars (fructose itself, HFCS and 
sucrose), to glucose and unsweetened controls at average 
consumption levels for fructose [88]. This study demon-
strated that added sugar consumed at median American 
intake levels did not produce changes in measures of insu-
lin sensitivity or glucose tolerance and that no sugar had 
more deleterious effects than others.
Another RCT from our research group looked at total 
body insulin sensitivity and hepatic insulin sensitivity using 
the Matsuda Index and found no increases in either vari-
able after 10 weeks of consumption of average amounts of 
fructose containing sugars compared to glucose [89]. A 
report by Johnston et al. [90] showed that overweight men 
with increased abdominal girth had no increase in either 
hepatic or total body insulin resistance when studied in a 
weight stable environment. Nor were there any differences 
between fructose and glucose when delivered at 25 % of 
calories. In a second portion of this study, where these 
same individuals were overfed and gained weight, increases 
in liver fat occurred. There were, however, no differences 
between fructose and glucose with regard to this parameter.
Thus, when the totality of high quality evidence is 
taken into account, there is little support for a relation-
ship between sugar consumption and diabetes. In hyperca-
loric trials, however, there does seem to be some signal for 
harm—more likely due to added calories rather than some 
unique property of sugar per se.
Sugar and liver fat accumulation
As already indicated, NAFLD has been steadily increasing 
worldwide over the past 20 years and represents the leading 
cause of chronic liver failure and the need for liver trans-
plantation [10, 11].
It has been argued that fructose containing sugars 
may contribute to NAFLD though the process of de novo 
 S50
Eur J Nutr (2016) 55 (Suppl 2):S45–S53
1 3
lipogenesis [33]. However, as already discussed, the 
amount of fatty acids generated through the metabolism 
of fructose is relatively small—on the order of 1—5 % 
of fructose consumed and approximately 1 % in quantity 
when compared to ingested fats [34, 35].
Several investigators have suggested that large doses of 
fructose may contribute to ectopic fat deposition in the liver 
[37, 38, 91–93]. Stanhope et al. [37] reported that individu-
als who were given 25 % of their caloric intake as fructose, 
showed increased liver fat after fructose consumption. Le 
et al. [94] gave descendants of diabetics 3.5 g/kg lean body 
weight of fructose and found some increased accumulation 
of liver fat. It should be pointed out that both of these stud-
ies used dosages far in excess of normal amounts of con-
sumption of fructose and both used fructose by itself which 
is normally not consumed in isolation in the human diet. 
Maersk et al. [66] reported increases in liver fat in individu-
als who consumed a one liter serving of sugar sweetened 
beverage compared to diet beverage, milk, and water over a 
6 month period. These findings, however, were confounded 
by weight gain in the cohort.
Other investigators have not found increases in liver fat 
in short-term studies utilizing either fructose or sucrose. A 
RCT from our research laboratory which compared either 
8, 18, or 30 % of calories from HFCS or sucrose did not 
find any accumulation in liver fat over a 10 week, free liv-
ing trial [95]. Thus, there seems to be little evidence for 
a unique effect of fructose containing sugars leading to 
NAFLD in typical amounts and ways normally consumed 
by humans.
Sugars and neurologic responses
Some animal experiments have suggested differences in 
brain responses to fructose compared to glucose [96, 97]. 
However, these experiments must be treated with great cau-
tion since animal brains (particularly rodents, which were 
utilizing many of these studies) differ in numerous signifi-
cant ways from the human brain.
Recent studies in humans have utilized functional MRI 
(fMRI) to look at potential different neurologic responses 
to various sugars in human beings [98–100]. Page et al. 
[99] compared a 75 g oral bolus of fructose to 75 g oral 
bolus of glucose in 20 young, healthy volunteers and 
reported differences in hypothalamic blood flow with glu-
cose suppressing this blood flow and fructose not suppress-
ing blood flow when assessed by arterial spin labeling. Pur-
nell et al. [100] explored neurologic responses to 25 g of 
either fructose or glucose delivered as intravenous boluses. 
Blood flow to hypothalamus was not different between 
fructose and glucose but there were reported differences 
in blood flow to the cerebral cortex. Both of these studies 
should be viewed with considerable caution since both 
utilized monosaccharides rarely consumed in isolation in 
human beings and, in the instance of Purnell et al., utilized 
an atypical delivery route (intravenous). Unfortunately, 
these preliminary experiments have lead some scientists 
to speculate that fructose containing sugars may lead to a 
form of “addiction” although the scientific basis such spec-
ulation remains very much in doubt [101–103]. A study 
conducted in our research laboratory examined HFCS or 
sucrose given at 18 % of calories compared to 9 % of fruc-
tose or glucose in low-fat milk compared to unsweetened 
milk in the context of mixed nutrient meals and showed no 
differences in hypothalamic blood flow [104].
Summary and conclusions
Multiple RCTs, as well as recent systematic reviews meta-
analyses, have suggested that when sugars are substituted 
isocalorically for other carbohydrates and consumed in 
the normal range of human consumption there is nothing 
unique in regard to sugar consumption and health conse-
quences. Questions remain from research trials where fruc-
tose containing sugars have been substituted in ad libitum 
or hypercaloric research designs. Further studies will be 
necessary to settle issues in this area.
For now, we believe it is safe to state that the current 
literature provides little support for a unique relationship 
between consumption of fructose containing sugars, risk 
factors, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or NAFLD at nor-
mally consumed amounts in the normal ways that added 
sugars are typically consumed in the human diet (e.g., 
sucrose or HFCS). It is important to point out that, how-
ever, abundant evidence exists suggesting that consump-
tion of all energy dense nutrients, including added sugar, 
represents an important step along with decreased physical 
activity in increasing the risk of interrelated metabolic dis-
eases such as obesity, CHD, T2D, and NAFLD.
