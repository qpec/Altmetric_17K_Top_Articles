Abstract
Approximately 3 million healthcare workers per year 
receive an injury with an occupational instrument, with 
around 2000000 exposures to hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
and 1000000 to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although an 
effective HBV vaccine has been available since the 
early eighties, and despite the worldwide application 
of universal vaccination programs started in the early 
nineties, HBV still remains a prominent agent of mor-
bidity and mortality. There is no vaccine to limit the 
diffusion of HCV infection, which progresses to chronicity 
in the majority of cases and is a major cause of mor-
bidity and mortality worldwide due to a chronic liver 
disease. Healthcare workers are frequently exposed by a 
mucosal-cutaneous or percutaneous route to accidental 
contact with human blood and other potentially infec-
tious biological materials while carrying out their occu-
pational duties. Mucosal-cutaneous exposure occurs 
when the biological material of a potentially infected 
patient accidentally comes in contact with the mucous 
membranes of the eyes or mouth or with the skin of a 
healthcare worker. Percutaneous exposure occurs when 
an operator accidentally injures himself with a sharp 
contaminated object, like a needle, blade or other sharp 
medical instrument. About 75% of the total occupational 
exposure is percutaneous and 25% mucosal-cutaneous, 
the risk of infecting a healthcare worker being higher 
in percutaneous than in mucosal-cutaneous exposure. 
All healthcare workers should be considered for HBV 
vaccination and should meticulously apply the universal 
prophylactic measures to prevent exposure to HBV and 
HCV.

Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection in 
healthcare workers
 (HBV) or hepatitis C virus infection from source patients 
to healthcare workers is of vital importance in all 
healthcare settings worldwide, since these workers are 
exposed daily to these infections over a period of almost 
four decades. Needle pricks with contaminated needles, 
cuts from sharp instruments and blood splashes to the 
conjunctiva are the most frequent causes of exposure, 
injuries largely preventable by taking the standard 
universal precautions. HBV vaccination of anti-HBs-
negative healthcare workers is recommended in all 
countries, but numerous healthcare workers remain 
exposed to infection because they have eluded HBV 
vaccination.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
are responsible for the two most widespread forms 
of chronic hepatitis worldwide
[1-3]. Healthcare workers 
are exposed to the risk of acquiring HBV and HCV 
infection through mucosal-cutaneous exposure (eyes 
or mouth mucosa or skin) to potentially infectious blood 
or blood products or through percutaneous exposure 
to contaminated sharp objects (needles, blades, etc.). 
T
wenty-five percent of the total occupational exposure is 
mucosal-cutaneous and 75% percutaneous
[4]. The risk 
of HBV or HCV infecting a healthcare worker is higher 
in percutaneous than in mucosal-cutaneous exposure. 
According to the data provided by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), there are approximately 36 million 
healthcare workers worldwide, of whom around 3 million 
per year receive an injury with a sharp instrument, thus 
resulting in 2000000 subjects contaminated with HBV 
and 1000000 with HCV
[4]. Other studies estimated that 
the incidence of injuries to healthcare workers caused by 
sharp objects ranges from 1.4 to 9.5 per 100 healthcare 
workers per year
, resulting in 0.42 HBV infections per 
100 sharp-object injuries per year
[5].
This review article will focus on the risks of healthcare 
workers acquiring HBV and HCV chronic infections while 
carrying out their occupational duties.
HBV INFECTION
HBV infection is a global health problem since 240 to 
350 million
[6-9] people worldwide are estimated to be 
chronically infected, of whom 312000 die annually of 
advanced cirrhosis and 341000 of liver cancer
[7].
T
en genotypes of HBV have been identified to date, 
from A to J, based on a genetic diversity of at least 8% 
in the viral genome
[10,11]. HBV genotypes show a peculiar 
geographical distribution
[12]. Genotype A predominates in 
Northern Europe and North America, genotypes B and C 
in central Asia, genotype D in Mediterranean countries, 
genotype E in sub-Saharan Africa and in Madagascar
, 
genotype F in South and Central America, genotypes 
G and H in Mexico and some countries in Central 
America
[13,14] and genotypes I and J in Eastern Asia
[15].
The age at the time of infection modulates the 
progression to chronicity of HBV infection, which occurs 
in around 90% of babies born to hepatitis B e antigen 
(HBeAg)-positive mothers, a rate that progressively 
decreases with the increase in age up to 2%-5% in the 
adult population
[16].
The endemicity of HBV infection in a geographical 
area is classified according to the prevalence of subjects 
with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity in 
the general population as, high (> 8%), intermediate 
(2.0%-7.9%) and low (< 2%)
[11]. These categories 
reflect the predominant patterns of transmission and 
outcomes of HBV infection. In geographical areas with a 
high HBV endemicity, such as some countries in Eastern 
Asia or in sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of HBsAg-
positive individuals acquired HBV infection at birth or 
in early childhood, when the risk of progression to 
chronicity is very high
[7,15]. In geographical areas with 
an intermediate HBV endemicity, such as countries in 
Northern Africa, the Middle East and Southern Asia, and 
Eastern Europe, the majority of HBsAg-positive subjects 
acquired HBV infection in childhood or early adulthood, 
and family transmission plays an important role in the 
spread of HBV infection. Finally, in most countries in 
Western Europe, North, Central and South America and 
Australia the prevalence of HBsAg-positive individuals 
is below 2%
[6,7,14], the impact of vertical and horizontal 
transmission in childhood is low, and most HBsAg-
positive individuals acquired HBV infection through 
sexual contact, intravenous drug use (IVDU) or other 
parenteral exposure to infected blood
[17,18].
HCV INFECTION
HCV infection progresses to chronicity in 70% of cases, 
a condition that may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepa-
tocellular carcinoma
[19,20]. According to a WHO report
[21], 
130-150 million people are chronically infected with 
HCV
. HCV epidemiology shows considerable regional 
differences. In some geographical areas the endemicity 
is high, with more than 3.5% of the population having 
an HCV chronic infection, such as some countries in the 
Middle East and Central and Eastern Asia and Northern 
Africa. Several countries in Southern Asia, sub-Saharan 
Africa, the Andean territories, Central and South 
America, the Caribbean area, Oceania, Australasia and 
central and Eastern Europe have a moderate endemicity, 
with 1.5%-3.5% of subjects carrying HCV infection. The 
areas considered at low endemicity (< 1.5% of HCV 
chronic carriers) include countries in the Asian Pacific regi-
ons, tropical Latin America, North America and Western 
Europe
[22].

Coppola N et al. Viral hepatitis infections in healthcare settings
 HCV strains have been classified to date into 
seven genotypes, namely from 1 to 7, on the basis 
of phylogenetic and sequence analyses of the whole 
viral genome
[23]. The global geographical distribution 
of HCV genotypes is complex. HCV genotype 1 is the 
most prevalent worldwide, comprising 83.4 million 
cases (46.2% of all HCV chronic carriers), of whom 
approximately one-third live in Eastern Asia. HCV 
genotype 3 is the second most prevalent, and genotypes 
2, 4 and 6 are responsible for the majority of the 
remaining cases worldwide. Eastern Asia has the largest 
number of carriers with genotype 2 and genotype 
6, while Northern Africa and the Middle East have 
the largest number of carriers with genotype 4. HCV 
genotype 5 is responsible for around 1.4 million chronic 
infections (< 1% of all HCV cases worldwide), of which 
the vast majority in Southern and Eastern sub-Saharan 
Africa
[22-26]. Worthy of note, HCV genotypes 1 and 3 
generally predominate irrespective of the economic 
status, while the largest proportions of chronic carriers of 
HCV genotypes 4 and 5 live in low-income countries.
RISK FACTORS FOR THE ACQUISITION 
OF HBV AND HCV INFECTION
HBV circulates in peripheral blood of infected subjects 
and any parenteral or mucosal exposure to potentially 
infected blood or blood contaminated material can be 
considered a risk for HBV transmission to non-immune/
non-infected subjects
[18,27]. In addition, the virus is 
present at infectious concentrations in semen and 
cervical secretions, and, consequently, HBV is frequently 
transmitted also by sexual and vertical routes
[8,16]. The 
impact of the various routes of transmission varies 
significantly from one country to another
[8,16]. In coun-
tries with a high endemicity level, HBV infection is 
prevalently acquired at birth from an HBeAg-positive 
mother
, in which case it becomes chronic in around 
90% of cases, or by horizontal transmission in early 
childhood through household contact, with a progression 
to chronicity from 10% to 40% of cases. Promiscuous 
unprotected sexual activity and IVDU are the major risk 
factors for acquiring HBV infection in areas with a low-
prevalence, such as the United States
[28]. 
Worthy of note, the screening of blood donors for 
markers of HBV infection has dramatically reduced 
the risk of HBV transmission through the transfusions 
of blood and blood products. At present, this risk is 
estimated as 1-4 cases per million blood components 
transfused in low-prevalence areas
[29] and around 1 
case per 20000 blood transfusions in high-prevalence 
regions
[30]. 
The transfusion of infected blood and blood products 
was the most prominent route of transmission of HCV 
infection until 1989
[1,31]. Routine mandatory screening 
of blood donors for circulating antibodies to HCV that 
started in the early 1990s has drastically reduced the risk 
of HCV transmission due to the transfusion of blood and 
blood products, currently estimated between 1/500000 
and 1/1000000 blood units
[32]. Some concern for HCV 
transmission through blood transfusion remains only for 
some geographical areas with limited resources
[33]. In 
developed countries, the sharing of injection equipment 
among IVDUs is one of the major risk factors for the 
acquisition of HCV infection, as demonstrated by the 
high anti-HCV seroprevalence found (70% or more in 
some studies) in this subset of subjects
[34]. Conversely, 
in low-income countries, HCV transmission is frequently 
due to re-using equipment for injection and other inade-
quately sterilized therapeutic instruments
[35]. HCV is 
rarely acquired through sexual intercourse
[36], but some 
outbreaks of acute HCV infections occurring in men 
having sex with men in the last decade have attracted 
the interest of the scientific community on this route of 
transmission, particularly in human immuno-deficiency 
virus (HIV)-infected individuals
[37]. Perinatal transmission 
of HCV infection from HCV-monoinfected mothers 
occurs infrequently (around 3% of the cases), whereas 
it reaches 20% among HIV-coinfected mothers
[38]. Other 
risk factors for the acquisition of HCV infection have 
been described, including acupuncture, tattooing, body 
piercing, some cosmetic procedures, sharing of shaving 
razors, nail scissors and other personal effects, and 
needle-stick injury for healthcare workers
[28].
MODES OF EXPOSURE AND FACTORS 
ASSOCIATED WITH HBV AND HCV 
TRANSMISSION IN HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS
Healthcare workers are exposed to human blood and 
other potentially infectious biological material more 
frequently than the general population. Among the 60 or 
more agents responsible for blood-borne transmissible 
infectious diseases, HCV and HBV are those most 
frequently transmitted to healthcare workers. Contact 
with potentially infectious material occurs in most cases
through mucosal-cutaneous or percutaneous exposure. 
In mucosal-cutaneous exposure, a patient’s blood, 
blood derivative or other potentially infected biological 
material accidentally enters into contact with the mucous 
membranes of the eyes or mouth or with the skin, 
healthy or non-intact, of a healthcare worker
[39]. Percu-
taneous exposure occurs when an operator receives 
an injury with a sharp contaminated object, such as a 
needle, blade or piece of glass. Around 75% of the total 
occupational exposure is percutaneous and the remaining 
25% mucosal-cutaneous. The risk of HBV or HCV 
infecting a healthcare worker is higher in percutaneous 
than in mucosal-cutaneous exposure. The rate of trans-
mission of HCV infection can be five times higher in 
percutaneous than in mucosal-cutaneous exposure, but 
the risk of acquiring these infections through conjunctival 
exposure is also high.

The transmission of HCV infection occurs in nearly 
10% of the healthcare workers after parenteral exposure 
to the blood of an HCV-RNA-positive source patient, 
a rate that may vary according to the HCV load of the 
source patient
[39,42]. 
PRE-EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT
The prevention of exposure remains the primary strategy 
for reducing occupational infections by blood-borne 
pathogens. The healthcare organizations should make 
available for their personnel a system that includes written 
protocols for prompt reporting, evaluation, counseling, 
treatment, and follow-up of occupational exposures
[39]. 
Healthcare workers should be trained to adopt effective 
measures to prevent infections from occupational 
exposure to blood, i.e., eliminating unnecessary injections, 
implementing universal precautions, eliminating needle 
recapping and disposing of the sharp into a sharps 
container immediately after use, use of safer devices such 
as needles that sheath or retract after use
[50].
Furthermore, healthcare workers should be aware 
that any person at risk of contact with blood, blood-
contaminated body fluids, other body fluids, or sharps 
should be vaccinated against HBV
[51]. The vaccination 
should happen early after the start of their career to 
avoid infection and development of carrier status. 
The healthcare workers should be vaccinated with a 
standard vaccination schedule and the serum anti-
HBs should be assessed 1-2 mo after completion of a 
3-dose vaccination series
[52]. The HBV vaccination is, 
therefore, an essential part of prevention and control 
of HBV infection for healthcare workers and its use was 
one of the causes of drastic reduction of its prevalence in 
healthcare workers.
POST-EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT 
Although the primary prevention constitutes the first 
line of defense against the risk of occupational infections 
by blood-borne viruses, the adequate management of 
exposures with the post-exposure prophylaxis constitutes 
a key element in managing and limiting the transmission 
of these infections to staff exposed. 
Regarding HBV infection, the risk of infection and the 
post-exposure management depends on the HBV status 
of the source and of the healthcare worker
. 
The risk of developing clinical hepatitis or serological 
evidence of HBV infection is high (22%-31% and 
37%-62%, respectively) if the source is HBsAg and 
HBeAg positive, and low (1%-6% and 23%-37%, respec-
tively) if it is HBsAg positive and HBeAg negative
[28]. 
Moreover
, it needs to evaluate the serological status 
of the healthcare worker: If HBsAg, anti-HBs (or titer 
less than 10 IU/mL) and HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) 
are negative, the healthcare worker is at risk to HBV 
infection. Precisely, in this case it should be taken in 
account the post exposure prophylaxis with a first dose 
of HBV vaccine and anti-HBV-specific immunoglobulin 
is also played by the degree of infectiveness of the 
contaminated biological material to which the healthcare 
worker has been exposed
[40-42]. The highest rates of 
transmission of HBV or HCV infection follow exposure to 
blood or its products, but transmission can also occur
, 
generally at a lower rate, after exposure to ascites, 
cerebrospinal fluid or solutions from cell cultures. HBV 
and HCV transmissions have never been observed 
following exposureto feces, urine, sweat, vomitor tears.
Other main factors significantly affecting the like-
lihood of transmission of infecting agents are the extent 
and depth of the cutaneous or mucosal wound and 
the volume of blood transferred
[40-43]. All punctures 
from contaminated needles and sharp objects may be 
responsible for the transmission of infections. However
, 
the medical devices used to access the blood vessels 
directly cause most of the conversions to positivity of 
HCV and HBV serum markers worldwide. Such conver-
sions are less frequent after the intramuscular or subcu-
taneous use of hollow needles or the use of lancets 
for capillary blood collection, due to the lesser amount 
of organic material present on their surface. Nurses 
generally perform these clinical practices and are the 
occupational group with the highest risk of needle-stick 
injuries
[40-43].
The risk of exposure is also related to the medical 
procedure performed. For example, of the 99 percu-
taneous injuries observed by T
okars et al
[44] during 1382 
surgical operations in five different wards (general, 
orthopedic, gynecologic, traumatic and cardiac surgery), 
most (73%) were related with the suturing. Risk factors 
for percutaneous injuries included the performing an 
emergency procedure, a patient blood loss greater than 
250 mL, and a duration of surgery procedure greater 
than 1 h
[45].
The HBV load in the source patient may influence 
the risk of transmission of HBV infection to non-immune 
healthcare workers. In these cases, the risk of HBV 
transmission is estimated at 19%-30%, if the source 
patient is HBeAg-positive or shows an HBV load > 10
6 
IU/mL and at 5% if the source patient is HBeAg-negative 
or has a lower HBV load. The anti HBV vaccination of 
healthcare workers was introduced in the 1980s in 
most countries, but a substantial number of healthcare 
workers worldwide have eluded vaccination and, despite 
the excellent immunogenicity of the vaccine, about 20% 
of vaccinated subjects show anti-HBs titers lower than 
10 IU/mL. It is common opinion, however
, that HBV-
vaccinated subjects with an anti-HBs titer below 10 
IU/mL and those who have become anti-HBs-negative 
can be considered protected against HBV infection, 
since the immunological memory for HBsAg may 
persist even in these cases and ensure a rapid rise in 
protective antibodies in the case of an HBV assault
[46-48]. 
Nevertheless, a highly infectious HBV inoculum might 
overpower a low antibody titers against HBsAg (anti-HBs) 
titer during the long professional life of a healthcare 
worker
. In these cases, the administration of a booster 
dose of HBV vaccine could be considered
[49].

(HBIG), that should be initiated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 24 h of exposure and not more than 7 
d. If the healthcare worker is vaccinated with protective 
antibody response (≥ 10 IU/mL) or is anti-HBc positive, 
no treatment is needed.
Currently, there is no prophylaxis for HCV infection: 
In fact, immunoglobulin and antivirals are not recom-
mended and only the observation is indicated. However
, 
recently the available of the second and third wave 
direct antiviral agents enhanced the efficacy and tole-
rability of anti-HCV treatment
[53]; consequently, the 
traditional management of HCV infection after exposure 
in healthcare workers probably should be revised.
STUDIES ON HBV INFECTION IN 
HEALTHCARE WORKERS
The rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc positivity in healthcare 
workers reported in several studies published in the last 
three decades
[54-70] range from 0.1% to 8.1% and from 
6.2% to 73.4%, respectively, depending on the age of 
the subjects investigated, the spread of HBV infection in 
their country of origin and on the prevention strategies 
used by the healthcare workers (T
able 1).
Of 5813 healthcare workers tested in Italy in 1985, 
21.5% were found to be anti-HBc-positive and 1.8% 
HBsAg-positive
[65]. A logistic regression analysis showed 
that the exposure to HBV infection was associated with 
male sex, an older age, history of blood transfusion, 
dental treatment, needle-stick injury and working in a 
healthcare setting (surgeons and nurses vs others). A 
similar rate of HBsAg positivity (1.5%) was observed in 
a study on 960 healthcare workers tested in Denmark 
in 1998
[59]. A much higher HBsAg prevalence (8.1%) 
was detected in 480 healthcare workers investigated 
by Kondili et al
[62] in 2004 in Albania, in accordance 
with the widespread of HBV infection in this country. 
In this study, the highest rates of HBsAg positivity 
were found in the youngest age group (11.4% in the 
aged 20-30) and in the auxiliaries (12.6%), but a high 
HBsAg prevalence (7.2%-7.5%) was also found in 
the healthcare workers aged over 30. The anti-HBc 
seroprevalence was also extremely high (70%) in this 
study and was associated with an age over 40 (OR = 2.9; 
95%CI: 1.9-4.6).
In a study performed in Lybia in 2008 on 601 health-
care workers, the rate of HBsAg positivity was 1.8%, 
higher in nurses (2.3%) and lower in physicians (0.7%) 
and laboratory staff (0.8%)
[54]. Of 237 healthcare 
workers tested in Cameroon, 6.3% were HBsAg-positive 
and 73.4% anti-HBc-positive, in accordance with the 
wide spread of HBV infection in this geographical area
[60]. 
Seroprevalence studies conducted in Asia showed 
varying results. Aziz et al
[57], Rehman et al
[66] and Sarwar 
et al
[68], in three different studies conducted in Pakistan, 
reported that 2.4%, 5% and 2.4% of the healthcare 
workers, respectively, were HBsAg-positive. 
Low rates of HBsAg positivity were found in two 
seroprevalence studies conducted on healthcare workers 
in the United States (0.1%) and Brazil (0.8%)
[63,70]. 
Some case-control studies allowing a comparison of 
the HBsAg prevalence in the healthcare workers with 
that of the general population provided contrasting 
results. Rehman et al
[66], in a small case-control study 
performed in Pakistan, enrolled 95 healthcare workers 
and 91 volunteer blood donors as controls and observed 
higher rates of HBsAg (14% vs 5%) and anti-HBc 
(36% vs 28%) positivity in the control group. Instead, 
in a case-control study conducted in Turkey
[64], the 
rate of HBsAg positivity was similar in 702 healthcare 
workers and 5670 blood donors (3% vs 2.1%), and 
in the Philippines, Arguillas et al
[56] found 6.5% of 123 
healthcare workers and 2.2% of 382 blood donors to be

HBsAg-positive. Finally, in the United States, Thomas et 
al
[70] observed the same HBsAg-positivity rate (0.1%) 
in 943 healthcare workers and 104239 blood donors, 
whereas they found a higher rate of anti-HBc positivity 
in the healthcare workers, 6.2% vs 1.8%, indicating a 
greater exposure to HBV in these subjects, but expo-
sure was not followed by a chronic infection, most 
probably because it occurred in adulthood.
STUDIES ON HCV INFECTION IN 
HEALTHCARE WORKERS
The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity in healthcare 
workers
[54-74] ranges from 0% to 9.7% in different studies 
worldwide: 9.7% in the Philippines, 8% in Egypt, 3.2%-
5.6% in three studies in Pakistan, 5% in Georgia, 0.14% 
in Denmark, 0.8% in Poland, 0.7% in the United States, 
0.6% in Albania and 0.3% in T
urkey (T
able 2).
The majority of 1386 healthcare workers investigated 
in Georgia in 2006
[58] stated an episode of occupational 
exposure to HCV infection, including accidental needle-
stick injuries in 45% of cases, cuts with contaminated 
instruments in 38% and blood splashes in 46%. For the 
healthcare workers who received a cut, this unfavorable 
event occurred during the reassembling of tools or 
when receiving tools from a colleague in the majority 
of the cases, and the highest proportion of needle-stick 
injuries occurred when recapping used needles, more 
frequently in nurses (39%) than in physicians (22%).
In a cross-sectional study performed on 1770 health-
care workers in Egypt in 2008
[74], the anti-HCV seropre-
valence was 8.0%, the estimated incidence of HCV 
infection 7.3 per 1000 persons-year and the risk factors 
independently associated with HCV seropositivity were 
an older age, performing a manual job, having a history 
of blood transfusion or a history of parenteral treatment 
for schistosomiasis.
Only five case-control studies compared the preva-
lence of HCV infection in healthcare workers and in the 
general population of the same country
[56,64,66,70,72]. Four 
of these 5 studies showed similar prevalences of anti-
HCV positivity in the two groups of subjects: 0.3% 
vs 0.4%, respectively, in a study from Turkey on 702 
healthcare workers
[64] and 5670 blood donors, 1.6% in 
123 healthcare workers and 2.2% in 382 blood donors 
investigated in the Philippines
[56], 1.2% in 407 healthcare 
workers and 0.8% in pregnant women studied in Italy
[72]
and 0.7% in 943 healthcare workers and 0.4% in 104239 
blood donors in the United States
[70]. Unexpectedly, but 
similarly to what was observed for HBsAg by Rehman et 
al
[66] in a study in Pakistan (see above), they observed 
that the 95 healthcare workers less frequently than the 
91 blood donors were anti-HCV positive (4% vs 14%). 
The results of this study are of difficult interpretation.
CONCLUSION
Mucosal-cutaneous and percutaneous exposure to 
human blood or bloodstained medical instruments occurs 
more frequently in healthcare workers than the general 
population. A major role in the transmission of HBV or 
HCV infection is played by the virus concentration on the 
infecting materials, high in blood and blood products, 
much lower in ascites and in cerebrospinal fluid and at 
non-infectious concentrations in feces, urine, sweat, 
vomit and tears.
The characteristics of the wound received by a 
healthcare worker and the volume of blood transferred 
are other main factors influencing a possible trans-
mission of HBV or HCV infection. In fact, the devices

used to access the blood vessels directly, more fre-
quently than cable needles used for intramuscular or 
subcutaneous treatments, are responsible for HBV and 
HCV transmission because of the higher amount of 
organic material carried on their surface. 
The transmission of HBV infection from a source 
patient to a healthcare worker is also influenced by the 
natural or vaccine-induced immunological protection 
against HBV in the healthcare worker
. Although HBV 
vaccination of anti-HBs-negative healthcare workers is 
highly recommended in all countries, some healthcare 
workers have eluded vaccination and some were low- 
or non-responders to the vaccine, indicating that a 
highly infectious HBV inoculum might overpower low 
immunological protection. 
Since no anti-HCV vaccine is at present available to 
counteract HCV transmission, healthcare workers should 
protect themselves by meticulously applying all the 
universal prophylactic measures whenever potentially 
exposed.
