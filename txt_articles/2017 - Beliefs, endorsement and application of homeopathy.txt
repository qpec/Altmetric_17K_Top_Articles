homeopathy disclosed: a survey among
ambulatory care physicians

Summary
BACKGROUND: Explanation models for the effectiveness
of homeopathy are not supported by natural sciences and
the aggregated evidence from clinical trials is unconvinc-
ing. From this standpoint, placebo effects seem the most
obvious explanation for the therapeutic effects experi-
enced in homeopathy. Still, many physicians continue to
prescribe homeopathic treatments.
OBJECTIVES: Whether physicians who prescribe homeo-
pathic treatments aim to achieve placebo effects or actu-
ally believe in specific effects is poorly understood. How-
ever, this distinction has important educational and ethical
implications. Therefore, we aimed to describe the use of
homeopathy among physicians working in outpatient care,
factors associated with prescribing homeopathy, and the
therapeutic intentions and attitudes involved.
METHODS: All physicians working in outpatient care in
the Swiss Canton of Zurich in the year 2015 (n = 4072)
were approached. Outcomes of the study were: associ-
ation of prescribing homeopathy with medical specialties
(odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]
from multivariable logistic regression); intentions behind
prescriptions (to induce specific or nonspecific/placebo ef-
fects); level of agreement with specific attitudes; and views
towards homeopathy including explanatory models, rating
of homeopathy’s evidence base, the endorsement of indi-
cations, and reimbursement of homeopathic treatment by
statutory health insurance providers.
RESULTS: The participation rate was 38%, mean age 54
years, 61% male, and 40% specialised in general inter-
nal medicine. Homeopathy was prescribed at least once a
year by 23% of the respondents. Medical specialisations
associated with prescribing homeopathy were: no medical
specialisation (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.7-9.0), specialisation in
paediatrics (OR 3.8 95% CI 1.8-8.0) and gynaecology/ob-
stetrics (OR 3.1 95% CI 1.5-6.7). Among prescribers, on-
ly 50% clearly intended to induce specific homeopathic
effects, only 27% strongly adhered to homeopathic pre-
scription doctrines, and only 23% thought there was scien-
tific evidence to prove homeopathy’s effectiveness. See-
ing homeopathy as a way to induce placebo effects had
the strongest endorsement among prescribers and non-
prescribers of homeopathy (63% and 74% endorsement
respectively). Reimbursement of homeopathic remedies
by statutory health insurance was rejected by 61% of all
respondents.
CONCLUSION: Medical specialties use homeopathy with
significantly varying frequency and only half of the pre-
scribers clearly intend to achieve specific effects. More-
over, the majority of prescribers acknowledge that effec-
tiveness is unproven and give little importance to tradition-
al principles behind homeopathy. Medical specialties and
associated patient demands but also physicians’ open-
ness towards placebo interventions may play a role in
homeopathy prescriptions. Education should therefore ad-
dress not only the evidence base of homeopathy, but also
ethical dilemmas with placebo interventions.
Key words: homeopathy, survey, acceptance, health ser-
vice, placebo, ambulatory
Introduction
Since its creation, homeopathy has appeared to divide the
medical community between supporters and opponents,
and has spurred discussion about its effectiveness. Up to
now, the mainstays of homeopathic doctrine have contra-
dicted established principles of natural sciences, and com-
prehensible models consistently explaining how homeopa-
thy could cause specific effects are lacking [1]. Nonethe-
less, homeopathy remains popular not only among the gen-
eral public, but also among a considerable proportion of
medical professionals [2–4]. In Switzerland, as in other
countries, homeopathy is even integrated into national
health systems and health plans [5–8].
Scientifically, most accepted explanations for people’s per-
ception of the beneficial effects of homeopathy are built
around placebo effects, i.e. either simply by knowing that
they are receiving treatment, or from the effects of home-
opathic consultation [9, 10]. Interestingly, several studies
have addressed attitudes towards placebo treatments both
from the caregivers’ and patients’ points of view, and
found high acceptance if certain conditions are met [11,

 12]. Instead of or (depending on their beliefs) in addition
to specific effects, physicians may therefore use homeopa-
thy intentionally or without reflection to achieve placebo
effects.
Distinctions between intentions and beliefs behind home-
opathic prescriptions are important from ethical and edu-
cational perspectives. Prescribing homeopathy solely with
the intention of achieving placebo effects and without in-
forming the patient to this effect is considered deceitful,
and is prohibited by ethical authorities. However, if the
prescribing physician believes in the specific effects of
homeopathy, the matter of deception ceases to exist, and
there are no further ethical implications to consider. In or-
der to believe in specific effects, physicians somehow need
to give credibility to the concept either by their own ap-
praisal of the evidence base, or by believing in any of the
explanatory models for the effectiveness of homeopathy
(the most eminent being the Law of Similars including the
method of “potentization” by ultra-dilution).
Little is currently known about the beliefs and intentions
of physicians who prescribe homeopathy. While in public,
homeopathy is commonly discussed by extreme propo-
nents and adversaries, the point of view of the majority of
physicians is unknown. Knowledge about these perspec-
tives, however, is needed to foster a productive dialogue
and discuss the role of homeopathy in real-life clinical
practice. Therefore, the aims of this study were:
1.
To provide data on use of homeopathy in outpatient
care including factors associated with prescribing
homeopathy (i.e., medical specialties). Among pre-
scribers, to determine whether there was an intention
to induce specific or non-specific/placebo effects and
the degree of adherence to classical homeopathic doc-
trine.
2.
Among all respondents: to quantify existing beliefs in
explanatory models for homeopathy and rate the evi-
dence base of homeopathy’s effectiveness
3.
Among all respondents: to assess the endorsement of
different indications and justifications of homeopathy
use, including the political view of whether homeopa-
thy should be reimbursed by statutory health insurance
providers.
Materials and methods
Design and participants
A cross-sectional mixed modes survey among all practice-
based physicians in the Canton of Zurich from every med-
ical specialisation was performed between November and
December 2015. Mixed modes means that addressees were
contacted by letter but could choose to return the complet-
ed questionnaire either by mail (postpaid envelopes were
provided), fax, or using an online survey platform (Sur-
veymonkey®). Eligible physicians were identified using
the local physicians’ association’s (Aerztegesellschaft des
Kantons Zürich, AGZ) registry. The search was restrict-
ed to physicians at least partly working in outpatient care
(and excluding physicians solely working in inpatient set-
tings). From this registry, address data were used to send
a postal letter containing the paper survey, along with a
stamped and addressed envelope and an explanatory letter.
The letter contained a link to give access to the online sur-
vey platform. Responses received via mail were entered in-
to the online database by study staff members, in order to
compile all data within a single spreadsheet. Four weeks
after the initial circulation, non-respondents received an-
other invitation. After eight weeks, the survey was closed.
As an incentive to encourage participation, a prize draw
for a weekend at a local spa (total value CHF 1000) was
launched. Participation in the draw was possible without
responding to the survey. According to Swiss federal law,
surveys among physicians do not require the approval of
an ethical committee.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was self-administered and specifically
designed for the study purposes. It included knowledge
from previous surveys on homeopathy use by general prac-
titioners in Germany [13]. The questionnaire was German
and was composed of 24 items: homeopathy application
behaviour (items 1 to 8); observation of and beliefs in ef-
ficacy (items 9 and 10); endorsement of indications for
homeopathy (item 11); justifications to use homeopathy
(item 12); appraisal of evidence (items 13 and 14); patient
factors (items 15 and 16), physicians’ demographics and
working environment (items 17 to 23); and view on re-
imbursement of homeopathy by statutory health insurance
providers (item 24). 14 items were designed as multiple-
choice questions with a set of minimum 2 and maximum
5 answer options. One item was designed as a multiple re-
sponse item, and 3 items were related to a 5-point Likert
scale. The original questionnaire is provided in appendix
A, which is available in a separate file for downloading.
It was pilot-tested by 11 physicians representing the target
group. Testers completed the questionnaire and marked or
noted uncertainties, or any general comments. Improve-
ments were made according to the feedback provided.
Outcomes
Outcomes of the study were:
− Use of homeopathy among physicians measured by the
proportion of participants prescribing homeopathy (sub-
sequently referred to as prescribers; participants not pre-
scribing homeopathy are subsequently referred to as non-
prescribers, see definitions below), and, in addition, the
associations of medical specialties with use of homeopathy
− Prescribers’ intentions to induce specific or non-specific/
placebo effects and their level of adherence to homeopath-
ic doctrine (see definitions below)
− Beliefs of all respondents in explanatory models for
homeopathy, their ratings of the evidence base of home-
opathy’s effectiveness, and the need for more research
− All respondents’ endorsement of different indications for
homeopathy as first- or second-line treatment, their agree-
ment with different statements justifying use of homeopa-
thy, and their political view of whether homeopathy should
be reimbursed by statutory health insurance providers.
Definitions
In the following, specific outcome measures are defined,
and a number of homeopathy-specific terms (italics) are
used. Detailed explanations of these terms is provided in
appendix B.

 Prescribers of homeopathy
All participants having prescribed homeopathic remedies
or having referred patients to homeopathic treatment by
other therapists within the preceding 12 months were clas-
sified as prescribers. All others were classified as non-pre-
scribers.
Adherence to homeopathic doctrine
Adherence to homeopathic doctrine was a composite out-
come of answers to questions on attitudes to use of treat-
ment, namely consideration of miasm theory, remedy
preparation, and remedy selection techniques.
Strong adherence was assumed in physicians who revealed
either that they consider miasm theory for their treatments,
or that they predominantly use single remedies and choose
homeopathic remedies according to the techniques of total
consideration, hierarchisation and repertorisation of pa-
tient symptoms. Moderate adherence was assumed in
physicians
either
predominantly
prescribing
complex
remedies or selecting remedies according to proven indi-
cations but not considering miasm theory. Non-adherence
was assumed when neither miasm theory nor the above-
mentioned preparations and selection techniques were con-
sidered in treatment.
Intentions behind prescriptions
Prescribers’ intentions when prescribing homeopathic
treatment were assessed based on beliefs in explanatory
models for the effectiveness of homeopathy. Prescribers
were asked to rate different proposed models on a 5-point
Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). If par-
ticipants agreed or strongly agreed with at least one of the
following explanatory models for efficacy, they were as-
sumed to intend specific effects from using homeopathic
remedies: Law of Similars, water memory, cybernetic mod-
el, chaos theory or quantum physics. Intending placebo
effects was assumed if participants disagreed or strongly
disagreed with the above explanatory models, and if they
agreed or strongly agreed with at least one following ex-
planatory models: placebo effect, strengthening the rela-
tionship between patient and physician, satisfaction of pa-
tient expectations, or transference/counter-transference
model. Not intending any effects was assumed if pre-
scribers disagreed or strongly disagreed with all explana-
tory models. The remaining respondents were those giving
least one “undecided” (but no higher) rating to any beliefs
in explanation models. Therefore such respondents seem to
hold weak beliefs in effects, or at least do not rule them out
completely. These respondents we classified as having am-
biguous intentions when prescribing homeopathy.
Statistics
We describe categorical variables with counts and propor-
tions, numerical variables with means and standard devia-
tions (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) as ap-
propriate. For bivariate group comparisons, we used Fish-
er’s exact test or chi-squared test for categorical variables,
and the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Student’s t-test for nu-
merical variable according to distributions.
Association of categorisation as a prescriber of homeopa-
thy and physician’s medical specialisation were examined
using multivariable logistic regression. We adjusted for
age, perceived proportion of patients requesting homeopa-
thy, perceived proportion of patients with symptoms that
could not be treated satisfactorily (we hypothesise this to
be a key factor in explaining physicians’ use of homeopa-
thy), organisation of workplace (single-handed or group
practice/emergency department/hospital ward), socioeco-
nomic status of practice postal code regions (average per
capita income from public taxation register [14]). We re-
port odds-ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and
p values. A p level of <0.05 is considered statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical analyses were performed with R
(version 3.2.0, The R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Participants
All 4072 physicians from the AGZ database registered
as working full- or part-time in outpatient care were ad-
dressed and all except 14 letters were deliverable. We re-
ceived 1531 responses corresponding to a response rate of
37.7%. However, 19 respondents made an opt-out state-
ment on their questionnaire and were excluded from analy-
sis. Thus, the responses of a total of 1512 participants were
analysed (see flowchart of in- and exclusions in appendix
C). Mean age of the participants was 54.1 (SD 9.25) years
and 61.0% of the participants were male. Detailed charac-
teristics of survey participants are given in table 1.
Use of homeopathy and associations with medical spe-
cialties
From all participants, 22.8% (n = 345/1512) were classi-
fied as prescribers and 76.7% (n = 1160/1512) were classi-
fied as non-prescribers of homeopathy. In 0.5% of cases (n
= 7/1512) missing data made such categorisation impossi-
ble. The prescriber proportions and percentages of patients
treated with homeopathy by medical specialty are present-
ed in table 2. Thirty-seven (2.4%) participants had already
acquired a certificate in homeopathy and another 35 (2.3%)
were currently acquiring or planning to gain this certifi-
cate. Prescribers estimated that they used homeopathy in a
median of 5% (IQR 1−20%) of their patients.
When it came to associations of prescribing homeopathy
with medical specialties, in the multivariate regression
model we found a strong positive association for paediatri-
cians (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.8–8.0) and gynaecologists/ob-
stetricians (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5–6.7), but the strongest
positive association was found for those without further
medical specialisation (i.e., a Swiss “Praktischer Arzt”:
OR = 3.9, 95%CI = 1.7–9.0). Significant associations were
noted with the following control variables: perceived pro-
portion of patients with unsatisfactorily treatable symp-
toms, perceived proportion of patients requesting home-
opathy, respondent sex, organisation of workplace, but not
physicians’ age and socio-economic status of practice
postal code regions (see table 3 for details).
Intentions behind prescriptions and level of adherence
to homeopathic doctrine
According to the predefined classification criteria, 50.4%
of the prescribing physicians intended specific effects from
homeopathy, 21.4% intended non-specific/placebo effects,
16.5% had ambiguous intentions, and 1.2% didn’t intend
any effects at all. Incomplete responses prohibited this

 classification in 10.4% of participants. Applying the crite-
ria for adherence to homeopathic doctrine, we found that
27.2% of the prescribers showed strong adherence to
homeopathic doctrine, 54.4% moderate adherence, and
18.4% non-adherence. Detailed results of use of homeopa-
thy are given in table 4.
Beliefs in explanatory models and rating of the evi-
dence available
Prescribers of homeopathy agreed most often with the Law
of Similars to explain the efficacy of homeopathy (41.7%).
Placebo effects came in second place (35.1%) followed
by other interpersonal effects (satisfaction of patient ex-
pectations, strengthening of relationship between patient
and physician, transference/counter-transference). Quan-
tum physics and water memory were seen as explanatory
models by 19% of prescribers. Agreement with each ex-
planatory model is shown in table 5. By contrast, non-
prescribers agreed in 0.9−6.7% of cases with explanatory
models for specific effects, and in 40.3−72.4% of cases
with explanatory models advocating interpersonal or
placebo effects. Among prescribers, 22.6% thought the ev-
idence base of homeopathy proved effectiveness, versus
2.6% of the non-prescribers. The need for more research
in homeopathy was expressed by 76.0% of the prescribers
and 42.4% of the non-prescribers.
Endorsement of indications, justification and view on
reimbursement
Endorsement of homeopathy as a first-line treatment was
greatest for non-specific symptoms where no causative
treatment was available (agreement from 53.8% of partici-

*When 0% is given this means that physicians either reported prescribing homeopathy in fewer than 0.5% of their patients, or that they were classified as prescribers of home-
opathy not because of writing their own prescriptions, but because they referred patients to homeopathic treatment by a different healthcare provider.

 pants). The least endorsement was seen regarding self-lim-
iting diseases (agreement from 31.4% of participants). Fig-
ure 1 shows endorsement of all indications for homeopathy
as a first-line treatment stratified by prescribers and non-
prescribers.
Endorsement of homeopathy as a second-line treatment
was greatest in situations where conventional medicine
alone had insufficient effects on symptoms (agreement
from 51.2% of participants). The least endorsement was
seen regarding the prevention of metaschematism (see ap-
pendix B) with 20.6% of participants showing agreement.
Figure 2 shows endorsement of homeopathy as a second-
line treatment, stratified according to prescribers and non-
prescribers.
Among commonly used justifications for homeopathy use,
the greatest agreement from participants referred to home-
opathy’s possible role in fostering placebo effects. Overall,
71.6% of participants agreed with this statement and differ-
ences between prescribers and non-prescribers were small-
est compared to all other Likert-type items in this chapter.
To consider homeopathy to be at least as effective as con-
ventional medicine but with fewer side effects was the least
accepted statement, with only 14.6% of participants show-
ing agreement. This item featured the greatest between-
group difference of all items in this chapter. Figure 3 vi-
sualises attitudes towards commonly used arguments to
justify homeopathy use, stratified by prescribers and non-
prescribers.

 A prolongation of the legal decree assuring reimbursement
of homeopathic remedies by statutory health insurance was
welcomed by 29.3%, and rejected by 61.0% of the partici-
pants. 9.6% were undecided.
Discussion
This cross-sectional survey among practice-based physi-
cians aimed to explore homeopathy’s use across medical
specialties and assess physicians’ views and attitudes to-
wards homeopathy. The results show that one out five
physicians prescribed homeopathic treatment at least once
a year and that prescribing homeopathy was associated

 with specific medical certifications. Half of the prescribing
physicians clearly intended specific effects with home-
opathy and a fifth clearly intended non-specific/placebo
effects only. Over 4000 practice-based physicians in the
Canton of Zurich (full census) were approached and the re-
sponse rate was 37.7%. Gender distribution and medical
specialisation of participants corresponded to the expected
proportions based on the corresponding census data of
Swiss ambulatory care [15, 16]. The proportion of practis-
ing homeopaths identified among physicians in the outpa-

tient sector was in the middle of the expected range from
other countries’ reports [2–4, 8, 17, 18].
Hahnemann’s Law of Similars continues to be the predom-
inantly believed explanatory model for homeopathy, with
almost half of the prescribing physicians supporting this
thesis. In contrast, all explanatory models containing non-
specific effects (such as placebo) ranked next on the scale,
and are believed by a quarter to a third of the prescribers.
Other more recent explanatory models for specific effects
(such as water memory) gained the least credibility among
prescribers. The majority of prescribers were also clearly
detached from homeopathic doctrine with only one in four
still distinguishing different qualities of preparations and
applying traditional techniques for remedy selection, or
considering the theory of miasms. The majority of pre-
scribers made more liberal use of homeopathy, and either
partially or completely disregarded the doctrine. Ultimate-
ly and most astoundingly, only one in five prescribers rated
evidence that proves the effectiveness of homeopathy. In
summary, these findings allow for the interpretation that a
majority of prescribing physicians use homeopathy liberal-
ly, have heterogeneous confidence in the underlying theo-
ries explaining homeopathy, and acknowledge that there is
no evidence for specific effects of homeopathy. An impor-
tant proportion of the prescribing physicians may therefore
be vulnerable to the criticism of using homeopathy to prac-
tice placebo medicine. This, however, seems to apply only
to about one in five prescribing physicians openly intend-
ing non-specific effects only. One out of six prescribers
seems to be ambiguous (i.e., sceptical about believing in
any effects of homeopathy but apparently not ruling them
out completely). These physicians therefore have no ex-
clusive or straightforward intention of achieving only non-
specific effects, and possibly retain a low level of confi-
dence that specific effects might still occur.
In this study, we found that the perceived prevalence of
patients with symptoms that could not be treated satisfac-
torily with conventional medicine was indeed strongly as-
sociated with prescribing homeopathy. Three out of four
prescribers thought homeopathy to offer treatment options
when conventional medicine showed limits. Such limits
are manifold and include non-existing treatments, or treat-
ments just unavailable or unknown to the respective physi-
cian, or the potential of adverse reactions and harm. This
points to a possible explanation regarding our finding of
specific medical specialties being more inclined to home-
opathy. Gynaecologists/obstetricians and paediatricians
treat pregnant women and children who are both especially
vulnerable to adverse effects from conventional treat-
ments. Naturally, these physicians more often need to with-
hold effective but potentially harmful treatments because
the risks outweigh the potential benefits. Prescribing
homeopathy instead might be a delicate but understandable
path in such situations, allowing a treatment for demanding
patients (ut aliquid fiat) but without exposing them to po-
tential harm (primum nihil nocere). This hypothesis is sup-
ported by three out of four prescribing physicians who
use homeopathy as an opportunity to meet patients’ ex-
pectations without exposing them to unnecessary side-ef-
fects. Working in a single-doctor practice and responding
to patients’ requests for homeopathy were also associated
with prescribing homeopathy, which suggests that social
phenomena are also associated with homeopathy prescrip-

 tions. This might also hold true for the association between
prescribing homeopathy and the female sex, a finding in
line with previous observations [19–21]. Altogether how-
ever, these associations are still poorly understood and hy-
potheses need to be formulated and tested in dedicated
studies before firm conclusions can be drawn.
Interestingly, most non-prescribers did not reject homeopa-
thy outright, but acknowledged placebo- and other inter-
personal effects inherent to homeopathic treatments. Many
non-prescribers even endorsed use of homeopathy in the
case of certain indications, particularly in situations where
the possibilities of conventional medicine were exhausted
or did not exist. These findings possibly reflect a certain
openness of most physicians to accept homeopathy as a
placebo intervention, an attitude that two thirds of pre-
scribers and three quarters of the non-prescribers directly
agreed upon in our survey. This, however, also points to the
need for specific and practicable ethical guidance, which
will assist physicians who risk being perceived as deceitful
by their patients.
Certain strengths and limitations to this study must be ac-
knowledged. The response rate was 37.7% and even if
physicians’ demographics matched the latest census data,
we cannot exclude bias from selective answering. Strict
opponents of homeopathy in particular may have tended to
refuse survey participation. Thus, our survey likely overes-
timates use and endorsement of homeopathy among physi-
cians. Simultaneously, however, proportions within the
group of homeopathy prescribers would suffer less from
this possible selective-answering bias. Furthermore, this is
a full census and the absolute numbers produced in this
survey can still be faithfully used as minimal estimations
(e.g., “At least 345 out of 4072 physicians in the canton
of Zurich prescribed homeopathy at least once a year.”).
Another limitation originates from missing items in spe-
cific sections of the questionnaire. The questions that re-
quired understanding of homeopathic doctrine were left
out by up to 20% of the participants. Here we assume se-
lective omission by physicians unfamiliar with homeopa-
thy, therefore we expect real-life adherence to homeopathic
doctrine to be even lower than this study shows. Ultimate-
ly, this study summarises a broad spectrum of attitudes and
views on homeopathy represented by a broad spectrum of
physicians. Thereby this study might contribute to the on-
going political debate concerning homeopathy that usually
and unproductively tends to be dominated by extreme pro-
ponents and extreme adversaries.
We conclude that medical specialties use homeopathy with
significantly varying frequency and only half of the pre-
scribers clearly intend specific effects when issuing home-
opathic treatments. Hypotheses need to be tested to deter-
mine why exactly physicians give credibility to the concept
of homeopathy despite training in natural sciences, and
why exactly physicians prescribe homeopathy when they
don’t even expect specific effects to be achieved. Not on-
ly does knowledge about natural sciences pay a role in
perceptions of homeopathy, but so too does physicians’
openness towards placebo interventions. Educational ef-
forts should therefore address not only the evidence base
of homeopathy, but also ethical dilemmas with placebo in-
terventions.
