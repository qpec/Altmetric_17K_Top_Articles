IMPORTANCE Sleep is vital to children’
s biopsychosocial development. Inadequate sleep
quantity and quality is a public health concern with an array of detrimental health outcomes.
Portable mobile and media devices have become a ubiquitous part of children’
s lives and may
affect their sleep duration and quality.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether there is an
association between portable screen-based media device (eg, cell phones and tablet devices)
access or use in the sleep environment and sleep outcomes.
DATA SOURCES A search strategy consisting of gray literature and 24 Medical Subject
Headings was developed in Ovid MEDLINE and adapted for other databases between
January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. Searches of the published literature were conducted
across 12 databases. No language restriction was applied.
STUDY SELECTION The analysis included randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and
cross-sectional study designs. Inclusion criteria were studies of school-age children between
6 and 19 years. Exclusion criteria were studies of stationary exposures, such as televisions or
desktop or personal computers, or studies investigating electromagnetic radiation.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Of 467 studies identified, 20 cross-sectional studies were
assessed for methodological quality. Two reviewers independently extracted data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were inadequate sleep quantity, poor
sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness, studied according to an a priori protocol.
RESULTS Twenty studies were included, and their quality was assessed. The studies involved
125 198 children (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [2.2] years; 50.1% male). There was a strong and
consistent association between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity
(odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.42-3.32) (P < .001, I2 = 90%), poor sleep quality (OR, 1.46;
95% CI, 1.14-1.88) (P = .003, I2 = 76%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR, 2.72; 95% CI,
1.32-5.61) (P = .007, I2 = 50%). In addition, children who had access to (but did not use)
media devices at night were more likely to have inadequate sleep quantity (OR, 1.79; 95% CI,
1.39-2.31) (P < .001, I2 = 64%), poor sleep quality (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.11-2.10) (P = .009,
I2 = 74%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.54-3.35) (P < .001,
I2 = 24%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To date, this study is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis of the association of access to and the use of media devices with sleep
outcomes. Bedtime access to and use of a media device were significantly associated with the
following: inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness. An
integrated approach among teachers, health care professionals, and parents is required to
minimize device access at bedtime, and future research is needed to evaluate the influence of
the devices on sleep hygiene and outcomes.

S
leep is crucial to the development of physically and psy-
chologicallyhealthychildren.Sleepdisturbanceinchild-
hood is known to lead to adverse physical and mental
health consequences. Short- and long-term detrimental health
outcomes include poor diet, sedentary behavior, obesity, re-
duced immunity, stunted growth, mental health issues (eg, de-
pression and suicidal tendencies), and substance abuse.1-3
Despite its importance to health, insufficient sleep and re-
sultant daytime sleepiness are prevalent among the pediatric
population and increase throughout adolescence.4,5 In the
United States, 75% of those 17 to 18 years old report insuffi-
cient sleep, which is consistent with the findings in other de-
veloped countries.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics has
highlightedfactors,includingelectronicmediadeviceuse,early
school start times, and increase in caffeine consumption, that
contribute substantially to this trend of insufficient and dete-
riorating sleep in the pediatric population.4,5
Studies7,8 during the past decade have demonstrated that
the use of conventional electronic devices, such as televi-
sions, gaming consoles, and computers, negatively affects
sleep. Newer portable mobile and media devices, including
smartphones and tablet devices with broader capabilities (eg,
internet and social networking), provide a different type of ex-
posure because they allow real-time interaction and there-
fore continuous stimulation for children, unlike older station-
arydevices.8Herein,thesenewerportablescreen-basedmobile
and media devices are termed media devices.
Thepresenceofmediadevicesisalmostubiquitousamong
children: 72% of all children and 89% of adolescents have at
least 1 device in their sleep environment, with most used near
bedtime.3,6 Such devices are hypothesized to adversely affect
sleep through various pathways.7,8 First, they may nega-
tively influence sleep by directly displacing, delaying, or in-
terrupting sleep time. Second, the content can be psychologi-
cally stimulating, and, third, the light emitted from devices
affects circadian timing, physiological sleep, and alertness.9
However, the association between media device use and poor
sleep outcomes has been underexplored because the speed at
which these devices have been developed has outpaced re-
search capabilities.8,9 A previous literature review8 reported
a suspected association between screen time and poor sleep
outcomes and stimulated debate to assess the quality of
evidence and quantify the magnitude of the potential
relationship.7 To our knowledge, we present the first system-
atic review to quantify the influence of media device use on
sleep outcomes in a meta-analysis.
Methods
Study Selection
This study was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items
forSystematicReviewsandMeta-analyses(PRISMA)guidelines10
andwasperformedaccordingtoanaprioriprotocol.Allexperi-
mental and observational study designs, in any language, pub-
lishedbetweenJanuary1,2011,andJune15,2015,wereincluded.
The time frame was selected to reflect the interactive nature of
media devices now used. The inclusion criteria were studies of
children and adolescents of school age between 6 and 19 years.
Theexclusioncriteriawerestudiesofstationaryexposures,such
as televisions or desktop or personal computers, or studies in-
vestigating electromagnetic radiation.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
A search strategy consisting of 24 Medical Subject Headings
was developed in Ovid MEDLINE and adapted for other data-
bases (eTable 1 in the Supplement). On June 15, 2015, searches
of the published literature were conducted across 12 data-
bases, including the British Education Index, Cumulative In-
dex to Nursing and Allied Health database, Cochrane Library,
Educational Resources Information Center, International
Biography of Social Sciences, Ovid MEDLINE (EMBASE,
MEDLINE, and PsycINFO), PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus,
and Web of Science. The gray literature was searched using the
OpenGrey online database. Bibliographies of included stud-
ies and conference abstracts were hand searched, and au-
thors of included studies were contacted to identify any on-
going or unpublished studies.
Device Exposure Categories and Sleep Outcomes
Cohorts of children with access to media devices less than 3
times a week were combined with children who had no me-
dia device access and were categorized as having no access to
a media device. Children with bedtime access to a media de-
vice at least 3 times a week were categorized as having access
to a media device. Children who used media devices around
bedtime were categorized as those who used a media device.
Outcomes were the proportion of children who experienced
inadequate sleep quantity (defined as <10 hours of daily sleep
for children and <9 hours of daily sleep for adolescents5,11,12),
poor sleep quality (defined as frequent difficulty in sleep ini-
tiation or sleep maintenance or nonrefreshing sleep13), and ex-
cessive daytime sleepiness (defined as poor daytime function-
ing as a result of both sleep quantity and quality14).
Study Screening and Quality Assessment
Titles and abstracts identified from searches were screened for
relevance, and duplicates were excluded. The full texts of all
relevant articles were retrieved, and their eligibility for inclu-
sion was assessed. Two reviewers (D.B. and M.S.P.) indepen-
dently assessed the methodological quality of all full-text ar-
ticles, and discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer
(B.C.).Thequalityassessmenttoolconsistedof13domainsthat
Key Points
Question Is there an association between screen-based media
device access or use in the sleep environment, and sleep quantity
and quality?
Findings A systematic review and meta-analysis showed strong
and consistent evidence of an association between access to or
the use of devices and reduced sleep quantity and quality, as well
as increased daytime sleepiness.
Meaning An integrated approach among teachers, health care
professionals, and parents is needed to improve sleep hygiene.

appraised the overall evidence of a study.15 Each domain was
determined as having a low risk of bias (RoB), an unclear RoB,
or a high RoB. If a study had all domains with a low RoB, it was
assessed as being of good quality. If a study had at least 1 do-
main with a high RoB, it was assessed as being of low quality.
Alternatively, if a study was assessed as having a combina-
tion of low and unclear RoB domains, it was determined to be
of unclear quality. Methodologically flawed studies were ex-
cluded, and the reasons for exclusion were stated. A Grading
of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evalu-
ation (GRADE) was performed on all findings.16
Data Extraction
Two reviewers (P.R. and M.S.P.) independently extracted data,
and a third reviewer (B.C.) resolved discrepancies. Study au-
thors were contacted if incomplete data had been reported and
to provide aggregate or individual participant data (IPD).
Measures of Association Between Media Device Use
and Sleep
Included studies measured the association between expo-
sure to a media device and the influence on sleep using either
linear regression slopes (β), correlation coefficients (r), or odds
ratios(ORs).Toensureconsistencyininterpretation,onlystud-
iesthatreporteddichotomousdataorlogisticregressionanaly-
ses were pooled in a meta-analysis.
Data Synthesis
Ifstudydesigns,populations,interventions,andoutcomeswere
deemed to be clinically homogeneous, the data were pooled in
a random-effects meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel
method.17,18 If dichotomous data were not available but study
analyses were reported, the analysis data were pooled with the
dichotomous data using a generalized inverse variance
approach.19 If IPD were available and considered to have exter-
nalvalidity,alogisticregressionmodelwasfitted,accountingfor
thestudyastherandomeffect,andadjustedforparticipantage.20
Assessment of Subgroups and Statistical Heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
Heterogeneity exceeding 85% was explored using subgroup
analyses.19 All meta-analysis data were presented as OR with
the associated 95% CIs, P values, and I2 summary data. Pre-
specified subgroups to explore heterogeneity included qual-
ity assessment (high-quality vs unclear and low-quality stud-
ies), age of children (6-11, 12-15, and 16-18 years), and type of
media device (cell phone vs tablet).
Results
Identified Studies and Quality Assessment
A total of 467 studies were identified, and 69 full texts were
reviewed, leading to 49 being excluded (Figure 1). Of 20 stud-
ies involving 125 198 children (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [2.2] years;
range, 6-18 years; 50.1% male) that were assessed for meth-
odological quality, 17 were included, with 3 excluded be-
cause of poor methods conduct or reporting21-23 (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Two studies13,24 were of good quality,
6 studies3,25-29 were of low quality, and 9 studies30-38 were
of unclear quality (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

(n = 3),24,36,37 and Australasia (n = 3),29,32,34 (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). Six studies13,24,26,27,30,33 assessed the associa-
tion between media device use and sleep during weekday pe-
riods only. Five studies3,25,28,32,34 assessed sleep separately on
weekdays and weekends, and 6 studies29,31,35-38 aggregated
weekly data.
Media Device Exposure Categories
Media device investigations were categorized into 2 expo-
sure groups, namely, studies3,13,24,27,28,30-33,35,37,38 that re-
ported bedtime media device use and studies3,25-27,31,32,35 that
described children who had access to (but did not use) media
devices at night. One study36 presented data on the use of me-
dia devices throughout the entire day, which is not reported
herein. Individual study results grouped by device exposure
category are listed in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Bedtime Media Device Use Compared
With Not Having Access to a Device
We identified 12 studies that investigated the use of media de-
vices near bedtime (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Eight studies
reported that bedtime media device use was significantly asso-
ciatedwithinadequatesleepquantity(P < .05).Sevenofthestud-
ies reported an association between bedtime media device use
andpoorsleepquality(P < .05),and1study35reportedthatbed-
timemediadeviceusewasassociatedwithimprovedsleepqual-
ity. Four studies that presented data on excess daytime sleepi-
ness demonstrated statistically significant results (P < .05).
Inadequate Sleep Quantity
In 7 studies,3,13,27,30-32,35 the prevalences of inadequate sleep
quantity among the 2 groups were 45.4% (children having bed-
time media device use) and 31.5% (children not having access
to a device). The pooled OR was 2.17 (95% CI, 1.42-3.32)
(P < .001,I2 = 90%)(Figure2).Thelargeheterogeneitywasdue
to the study by Chahal et al,31 which recruited only 10-year-
oldand11-year-oldchildren.Afterthatstudywasexcluded,the
OR was 2.52 (95% CI, 1.79-3.55) (P < .001, I2 = 72%). Two
studies3,27 were included in an IPD meta-analysis, and the age-
adjusted OR (aOR) was 3.06 (95% CI, 2.01-4.70) (P < .001).
Poor Sleep Quality
Fivestudies3,13,27,32,35reporteddichotomousdataonpoorsleep
quality, and the prevalences of poor sleep quality among the 2
groups were 52.1% (children having bedtime media device use)
and34.4%(childrennothavingaccesstoadevice).Twoadditional

OR was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.88) (P = .003, I2 = 76%) (Figure 3).
There was an increased odds of poor sleep quality in those who
used a media device near bedtime. The IPD meta-analysis aOR
was 1.92 (95% CI, 1.27-2.90) (P = .002) from 2 studies.3,27

Having Access to a Media Device Compared
With Not Having Access to a Device
Most studies reported statistically significant evidence of an
associationbetweenthepresenceofamediadeviceinthesleep
environment near bedtime and inadequate sleep quantity
(6 of 7 studies), poor sleep quality (4 of 6 studies), and exces-
sive daytime sleepiness (3 of 4 studies). These results are sum-
marized in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Inadequate Sleep Quantity
There were data from 6 studies3,25,27,31,32,35 that investigated
inadequatesleepquantity,andtheprevalenceswere41.0%(chil-
dren having access to a bedtime media device) and 31.5% (chil-
dren not having access to a device). The OR was 1.79 (95% CI,
1.39-2.31)(P < .001,I2 = 64%)(Figure4).Therewasanincreased
odds of inadequate sleep quantity among children who had ac-
cess to a media device near bedtime. The IPD meta-analysis
aOR was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.46-2.42) (P < .001) from 2 studies.3,27
Poor Sleep Quality
Dichotomous data were available from 4 studies3,25,27,32 that
investigated poor sleep quality, and the prevalences were 44%
(children having access to a bedtime media device) and 32.4%
(children not having access to a device). The OR was ex-
tracted from 2 studies.26,35 The pooled OR for poor sleep qual-
ity was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.11-2.10) (P = .009, I2 = 74%) (eFigure 2

Subgroup Analyses
There were no subgroup associations found owing to the qual-
ity of included studies or type of media device. Similarly, there
was no subgroup association for the age of the children, al-
though most were between 10 and 18 years old.
GRADE Assessment
The GRADE assessment of included studies was low because
of their nonrandomized nature. The assessment of the find-
ingswasupgradedowingtothelargeeffectsizesfoundbutwas
downgraded because of the substantial heterogeneity. There-
fore, the level of evidence is low, meaning that the results may
change on publication of further evidence.
Discussion
Summary of the Findings
To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis to quantify the association of media device ac-
cess and use with children’
s sleep. We found that bedtime de-
vice use was associated with an increase in the odds of inad-
equatesleepquantity,poorsleepquality,andexcessivedaytime
sleepiness. Media device presence in the bedroom (even with-
out use) was also associated with an increased odds of detri-
mental sleep outcomes.
This study is the first systematic review and meta-
analysis to date to include a robust quality assessment that
quantified the association of media device access and use with
poor sleep outcomes.8 Our study provides supporting evi-
dence for an interaction between media device use and psy-
chophysiological arousal as a key mechanism of effect.33 Our
findings support recommendations that interventions should
be developed and evaluated to reduce media device access and
use at bedtime. Specifically, we support age-specific guid-
ance for media device access and use33 and parent-led initia-
tives to reduce device access and use in collaboration with
teachers and health care professionals.39
These findings herein support current clinical opinion that

limitations of research in this area include measurement er-
ror of self-reported data, difficulty in ascertaining causality,
isolation of the influences of specific exposures, technologi-
caldevicesoutpacingresearch,andweaknessesinherenttoob-
servationalstudydesigns.Substantialheterogeneitywasfound
in many of the meta-analyses and is likely a reflection of the
included nonrandomized studies. Therefore, a degree of cau-
tion is needed when interpreting these findings.
Implications for Policy and Practice
The deleterious association between screen-based media use
and sleep in children and adolescents is a major public health
concern. Given the evolving technological landscape and the
replacement of textbooks with media devices in schools,
screen-based media device access and use are likely to rise. It
is imperative that teachers, health care professionals, par-
ents, and children are educated about the damaging influ-
ence of device use on sleep. Policy-led population-level health
promotiontonotstigmatizeindividualchildrenbutguidecom-
munitiestopromotetheimportanceofsleephygieneisneeded.
In addition, we encourage screening of children during rou-
tine clinical visits (by health visitors, school nurses, or family
physicians) to identify those with inadequate sleep to ex-
plore device use as a potential cause and target sleep hygiene
promotion.
Implications for Research
Multidisciplinary interventions to improve sleep hygiene have
been investigated40,41; however, pragmatic studies are needed
to understand the mechanism of action and causal pathway
between device use and sleep using objective data collection
methods. Interventions could be delivered by family physi-
cians as a part of routine care for those seen with health con-
cerns and by teachers who introduce devices into education.41
Device technologists should investigate software and parent-
led interventions, such as automatic time switches to restrict
access to media devices near bedtime. Interventions and poli-
cies must be developed, evaluated, and implemented at the
population level to raise awareness of the potential health haz-
ard to improve sleep hygiene through an integrated approach
involving teachers, health care professionals, and parents.
Conclusions
Media device access and use at bedtime are significantly as-
sociated with detrimental sleep outcomes and lead to poor
health outcomes. We recommend that interventions to mini-
mize device access and use need to be developed and evalu-
ated. Interventions should include a multidisciplinary ap-
proachfromteachersandhealthcareprofessionalstoempower
parents to minimize the deleterious influence on child health.
