Current influenza vaccines provide limited protection against circulating influenza A viruses.
A universal influenza vaccine will eliminate the intrinsic limitations of the seasonal flu
vaccines. Here we report methodology to generate double-layered protein nanoparticles as a
universal influenza vaccine. Layered nanoparticles are fabricated by desolvating tetrameric
M2e into protein nanoparticle cores and coating these cores by crosslinking headless HAs.
Representative headless HAs of two HA phylogenetic groups are constructed and purified.
Vaccinations with the resulting protein nanoparticles in mice induces robust long-lasting
immunity, fully protecting the mice against challenges by divergent influenza A viruses of the
same group or both groups. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating both
structure-stabilized HA stalk domains and M2e into a universal influenza vaccine to improve
its protective potency and breadth. These potent disassemblable protein nanoparticles
indicate a wide application in protein drug delivery and controlled release.

utant viruses acquire the ability to escape from pre-
vailing herd immunity by antigenic drift and shift,
which necessitates the yearly update of the composition
of seasonal influenza vaccines to match the newly circulating
viruses1. The protective efficacy of the seasonal vaccines does not
always live up to expectation. The outbreak of 2009 H1N1 pan-
demic caused 200,000 deaths during the first 12 months of its
circulation2. Low vaccine effectiveness was also observed recently
during the 2012–2013 and 2014–2015 flu seasons3,4. The sporadic
human cases of fatal zoonotic H5N1 and H7N9 infections are also
serious public health threats5–7. A universal influenza vaccine
which induces broad cross protection against divergent viruses is
urgently needed to eliminate these threats. Conserved determi-
nants from influenza antigenic proteins are potential immuno-
gens for such universal influenza vaccines. The HA stalk domain
is relatively conserved compared to the variable globular head
domain8,9. Accompanying the isolation and artificial generation
of broadly neutralizing antibodies10–16, some HA stalk domain-
based immunogens have been constructed and proven protective
to some extent in vivo17–19.
The amino acid sequence of influenza matrix protein 2 ecto-
domain (M2e) is highly conserved among human seasonal
influenza A viruses20. Natural human influenza A virus infections
induce only weak anti-M2e antibody responses of short dura-
tion21. A possible explanation for this low immunogenicity is the
small size of M2e and the low abundance of M2 in virions
compared to the large glycoproteins, HA, and NA22. Therefore,
M2e is often constructed with a larger carrier or presented as a
soluble tetramer antigen to enhance anti-M2e immune responses
in vaccination experiments23,24. Multiple copies of M2e in a
construct can dramatically enhance the M2e specific antibody
responses25. Clinical trials have demonstrated that M2e based
vaccines are safe and immunogenic in humans20,26,27. Human
passive immunization with humanized anti-M2e monoclonal
antibody TCN-032 proved to be efficient in reducing virus
replication, demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccine-driven
anti-M2e
antibody-based
immunity28.
Clinical
trial
results
have shown that the overall induced M2e antibody responses in
M2e-HBc vaccinated volunteers faded away rapidly within
10 months20.
Successful applications of nanotechnology hold great promise
for the development of new generations of influenza vaccines.
Large self-assembling motifs can enable 24-mer17,29 and even
60-mer30 protein nanoparticle (PNp) assembly. However, self-
assembly motifs increase the risk of off-target immune responses
due to their high immunogenicity. Desolvated PNp core coated
with viral antigen on the surface represents a convenient solution
to these issues and does not require encapsulation materials.
In this study, we found that layered PNps composed of
structure-stabilized HA stalk domains from both HA groups, and
novel constructed M2e, are highly immunogenic to induce
immune protection against homosubtypic and heterosubtypic
influenza A virus challenges. The double-layered PNps have the
potentials to be developed into a universal influenza vaccine. The
physiologically activated disassembly of PNps after the uptake
into cells implies a wide utilization for protein drug delivery and
controlled release.

 stabilized soluble tetramer protein containing four tandem copies
of M2e (4MtG) and trimeric head-removed (hr) HAs from
representatives of both HA phylogenetic groups (designed hrH1
and hrH3). To increase the potency and breadth of protection,

viral

sequences
(Fig.

sequences in Supplementary Table 1). The generation of hrHA
representatives from both phylogenetic groups is essential to
formulate a vaccine that can elicit a genuinely universal protective
response.
Starting with the HA sequences of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934
(H1N1, PR8) from group 1 and A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2, Aic)
from group 2, a series of structure-based mutations was
introduced. Due to its metastable conformation, HA2 expressed
independently from the HA1 subunit will spontaneously adopt a
low-pH conformation31. Here, hrH1 and hrH3 antigens are
composed of the stalk region of HA1 and the ectodomain of HA2
(Fig. 1a, bottom; Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The polymerization
of 4MtG and hrHAs was demonstrated by bis [sulfosuccinimidyl]
(BS3) crosslinking followed by SDS-PAGE Coomassie Blue
staining or Western blots (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Strong
binding of 4MtG to mAb 14C2 indicated the antigenicity of the
purified 4MtG protein (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The antigenicity
of hrH1 and hrH3 was evidenced by the strong binding of hrH1
to conformation-specific mAb C179 and hrH3 to linear-epitope-
recognizing mAb 12D1 and conformation-specific mAb 9H10 in
sandwich ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g). This indicates that
the recombinant hrH1 and hrH3 proteins were folded in a similar
fashion to the corresponding region in HA in the neutral pH
structure.
We
generated
double-layered
PNps
by
desolvation
and
3,3′-dithiobis
(sulfosuccinimidyl
propionate)
(DTSSP)
crosslinking32–34. This approach produced PNps composed
almost entirely of the antigens of interest and did not include
carriers, avoiding off-target immune responses to vectors17,29,35.
Desolvated M2e PNps proved remarkably immunogenic34, and
coated double-layer HA PNps better retained HA hemagglutina-
tion function32. Thus, we desolvated 4MtG into PNps (designated
Uni4MC) as the core as diagrammed in Fig. 1b and crosslinked
hrHA as a coating layer to resemble virion size and surface
antigen display, as diagrammed in Fig. 1c (hrH1-coated double-
layer PNps designated Uni4C1; and hrH3-coated PNps desig-
nated Uni4C3).
PNp size expanded with increasing amounts of DTSSP used
during desolvation (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) but was weakly
influenced by the desolvation ratio (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).
We have shown that PNps with small sizes induce significant
upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β from
dendritic cells compared to soluble antigens, potentially enhan-
cing specific immune responses33.

inactivated Aic H3N2. (n = 10) b Radar diagram depicting breadth of immune serum binding to HA subtypes. Because frequent human infection with fatal
zoonotic influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses in recent years represents possible emerging pandemics, the binding activities of immune sera to H5,
H7, and H10 were tested. The waning human herd immunity against H2N2 influenza strain and low mutation rate make it likely that a new pandemic could
arise from the current circulating H2N2 strain among birds and swine. H2 was included in the serum binding assay. The squares besides HA subtypes

 To minimize the PNp size, the core was not crosslinked until
after the addition of soluble hrHA during the coating process
because proteins self-assembled into smaller PNps in the absence
of a crosslinker (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis showed an average hydrodynamic diameter of 178
nm for Uni4MC, 194.8 nm for Uni4C1, and 228.5 nm for Uni4C3
(Fig. 1d). Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) showed that the
particles were relatively spherical with irregular surface morphol-
ogy (Fig. 1e). Quantification analysis (by using ImageQuantTL
software) of the PNps sizes showed the range of distribution of
Uni4MC from 80 nm to 260 nm with 96% PNp in the range of
120–240 nm, Uni4C1 from 120 nm to 300+ nm with 87% PNp in
the range of 160– 240 nm, and Uni4C3 from 80 nm to 300+ nm,
with 85% PNp in the range of 120–240 nm (Supplementary
Fig. 3f). There was no significant difference among the three
nanoparticle types (Supplementary Fig. 3g).
Uni4MC can be completely disassembled and reduced into
monomers, and blotted by anti-M2e serum in Western Blot
(Fig. 1f). Intensity analysis of the protein bands in Coomassie
Blue stained gel estimated the overall percentages of hrH1 and
hrH3 coatings to be 11.5 and 14% in the resultant double-layer
PNps, respectively (Fig. 1g).
The unbound hrHA molecules and self-crosslinked hrHAs
cannot be pelleted by high-speed centrifugation36. In the pull-
down assay, we found that no uncoated 4MtG PNps existed in
Uni4C1 and Uni4C3 samples (Supplementary Fig. 3h). Immuno-
gold labelling and transmission electronic microscopy imaging
showed C179-stained gold spotted Uni4C1, 12D1-stained gold-
spotted Uni4C3 and unspotted Uni4MC (Supplementary Fig. 3i),
demonstrating the coating of hrHAs onto particle surfaces.
PNps induce robust immunity conferring complete protection.
To evaluate the protective efficacy of the resulting PNp vaccines,
mice were intramuscularly immunized twice with PNps in the
absence of adjuvants. Strong seroconversion against M2e, H1N1
(PR8), and H3N2 (Aic) was elicited after boosting immunizations
(Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 4a). The induced M2e antibodies
showed strong cross-reactivity to diverse M2e peptides including
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1, p09) M2e, A/Vietnam/1203/2004
(H5N1, Vtn) M2e and A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9, SH) M2e
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Both
Uni4C1- and Uni4C3-elicited sera bound strongly to HA
homologous to the vaccine strain but weakly to heterologous HA
(Fig. 2a, b). Of note, Uni4C13 (cocktail of Uni4C1 and Uni4C3)
elicited sera strongly and broadly reactive to various HA antigens,
including inactivated PR8, Aic, reassortant Vtn (rVn), or reas-
sortant SH (rSH), or full length (FL) HAs from J57 H2N2 (strain:
A/Japan/305/1957) or GD H10N8 (strain: A/duck/Guangdong/
E1/2012) expressed on HEK293T cell surfaces in cell surface
ELISA (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 4c). Antibody isotypes against
M2e, inactivated PR8 and Aic were evaluated (Supplementary

 Fig. 4d). IgG2a-biased antibody responses were induced, as evi-
denced by the IgG1:IgG2a ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4e).
Cellular responses are also important for the generation and
regulation of effective immunity and contribute to the killing of
pathogens37,38. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Uni4C13 group
demonstrated broad cellular responses, and induced significantly
more IFN-γ secreting splenocyte populations after re-stimulation
with diverse antigen peptide pools.
Prophylaxis potency was evaluated by challenge studies. Four
weeks after the boosting immunization, 6 × 50% mouse lethal
doses (mLD50) of mouse-adapted influenza A viruses were used
for intranasal challenges. Uni4C1 and Uni4C3 immunizations
conferred complete homologous protection against death and
weight loss (Fig. 3a, b), whereas Uni4MC-immunized mice
suffered severe weight loss. The OVA PNp-immunized mice did
not survive challenges and experienced a similar weight drop to
the Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) group, exclud-
ing the possible role of non-specific particulate motifs in
providing protection. Immunizations with Uni4C13 but neither
Uni4C1 nor Uni4C3 provided universally complete protection
against lethal viral challenges (Fig. 3c–f). Both challenge strains
reassortant H5N1 (rVn) and H7N9 (rSH) bear internal genes
from PR8 H1N1, including the same PR8 M2e sequence
(Supplementary Table 1). The conservation between divergent
subtypes of HA is quite limited (Fig. 4a–c). Moreover, the
Uni4C13 immunization dramatically reduced lung virus titers at
day 5 post infection compared to the mock-immunization
(Fig. 5a, b). Histological analysis showed significantly decreased
leukocyte infiltration in infected lungs from Uni4C13 immunized
mice (Fig. 5c, d), and the score for leukocyte infiltration in this
group was significantly lower than other groups (Fig. 5e, f).
Antibodies correlate with immune protection. We next inves-
tigated
the
antibody-mediated
effector
mechanisms.
No
hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activities were detected with
pre-challenge sera (Table 1). Measurement of serum neutraliza-
tion (NT) revealed appreciable NT activity in Uni4C1 and
Uni4C3 immune sera against homologous strains. Uni4C13
immune sera showed NT activity against both H1, H3 and
H5 subtypes (Table 2). NT activity against rSH was undetectable.
Besides direct viral NT, Fc-mediated effector mechanisms such
as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) contribute
substantially to protection against influenza challenges10,39. In

 accordance with the binding data, Uni4C13 induced serum
antibodies with wide ranging ADCC potency against target cells
expressing M2, FL H1 or FL H3 (Fig. 6a–c). We passively
transferred immune sera from mice immunized with DPBS,
Uni4MC or Uni4C13 to three groups of naïve mice (n = 5). After
24 h, mice were intranasally challenged with 3 × mLD50 of PR8 or
Aic (Fig. 6d, e). In contrast to mice that received mock-sera, mice
that received sera from Uni4C13-immunized mice were protected
significantly, indicating that serum antibodies played critical roles
in the protection conferred by Uni4C13.
Clodronate-loaded liposomes were intra-tracheally adminis-
tered for selective depletion of alveolar macrophages (AM).
Passively transferred Uni4C13 serum in both PBS-loaded and
clodronate-loaded liposome treated mice have similar antibody
titers as evidenced in M2e peptide based ELISA (Fig. 6f).
Challenge
results
showed
that
only
mice
receiving
Uni4C13 serum and without the AM depletion were fully
protected against lethal dose Phi H3N2 challenge, indicating an
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) mechanism
(Fig. 6g). An antibody titer follow-up study shows that PNp-
induced antibodies specific to human M2e, PR8, and Aic were
durable up to 4 months after the last immunization in mice
(Fig. 7), implicating a long-lasting protection.
Discussion
An influenza vaccine which induces broad cross protection
against various influenza viruses has been a scientific challenge
for more than a half century40,41. With the recognition that
immunity specific to conserved epitopes in influenza antigenic
proteins is the “holy grail” of such protection, increasing evidence
indicates that the conserved HA stalk region and M2e have the
potentials to be developed into a universal influenza vaccine, if
these epitopes can be appropriately presented and sensed by the
host immune system35,42,43. A promising approach is to express a
standalone HA stalk domain without the highly immunogenic

 and strain-specific head domain, and a stabilized M2e with high
epitope density. It was reported that HA stalk sera strongly bind
HA from the same phylogenetic group but not the heterosubtypic
HA from the different groups. Increasing evidence also showed
that influenza genome of human isolates contained M2 gene
segment from swine and avian origins, like p09 H1N1, human
H5N1, and H7N9. Therefore, we started generating HA stalk
constructs from PR8 H1 (group 1) and Aic H3 (group 2), as well
as the M2e construct expressing tandem copies of M2e from
human, swine, avian, and domestic fowl influenza.
Our study provides insights into a novel format of particulate
influenza vaccines, which contain only antigenic proteins of
interest and can induce robust and long-lasting immunity. We
fabricated PNps approximately the size of the influenza A virions
with a core of M2e displaying a shell of conserved hrHA domains.
The binding of soluble hrHA to the desolvated PNps is speculated
to be mediated through interaction of hydrophobic residues and
fixed by DTSSP crosslinking primary amines. To our knowledge,
this design avoids the risk of instability shown by virus-like
particles under osmotic stresses or during changes in salt con-
centration and prevents off-target immune responses against self-
assembly motifs, such as the ferritin17,29 or hepatitis B core35
protein used in some PNp designs.
DTSSP is a water-soluble, thiol-cleavable and primary amine-
reactive cross-linker44. The crosslinked PNp with higher density
than water can be pelleted after high speed centrifugation. Due to
the reducibility of DTSSP, the cross-linker can be compromised
by the abundance of intracellular thiols, thus PNps can slowly
release free protein molecules after uptake by APCs. Enhancing
redox responsiveness has been shown to be effective in boosting
the immune response to reduced antigens45. The physiological
activated release of antigenic proteins from PNps may sig-
nificantly contribute to the broad immune protection seen.
Immunization with Uni4C13 PNp induced remarkably high
level of hrHA-specific and M2e-specific immune responses. It was
found that nanoparticulate antigens are more efficiently taken up
by phagocytes than soluble antigens, promoting dendritic cell
(DC) maturation and stimulating IL-1β production in bone
marrow derived DC32. Less actin polymerization was required in
PNp uptake by DC than soluble antigen. It was reported that
sustained antigen releasing shapes memory T cells and is
responsible for long-term immunity46. However, the immuno-
modulatory effects of PNp have been shown to be a function of
many aspects, including size47,48, shape49,50, charge51, surface
chemistry52 and administration route32,34. There is no universal
particulate design principle yet.

 We have shown that PNp vaccines based on both M2e and HA
stalk domains protect BALB/c mice mainly through ADCC and
ADCP. This result is consistent with previous findings on the
M2e-based and HA stalk-based immunity mechanism18,53–56.
BALB/c mouse IgG2a is more efficient than IgG1 in Fc-mediated
effector functions, capable of interacting with all activating FcγRI,
FcγRIII, and FcγRIV57. Our data indicate an IgG2a-biased anti-
body response after M2e PNp vaccination and IgG1-biased
antibody response after H7 PNp immunization32,34.
In conclusion, the structure-based designs of hrHA and 4MtG
recombinant proteins and the novel PNp structures provide
proof-of-concept for a universal influenza vaccine. Moreover, the
potent disassemblable PNps indicate a wide application for the
development of vaccines against other pathogens, and for protein
drug delivery and controlled release. Coating PNps with immune
cell receptor ligands such as CD154, complement receptor 1/2
ligands and so on, or with protein adjuvants such as fusokines,
TLR ligands and C–C motif chemokine ligands, is another avenue
to facilitate targeted protein drug delivery and to enhance
immune responses. In addition, the abiotic nature of PNps also
enhances their amenability to cold chain-independent storage for
3 months at room temperature, a desirable property for vaccine
transport to low-income countries.

 University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol
number A16024. Female BALB/c mice (six- to eight-week old) were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory and were housed in the animal facility at Georgia State
University. Bleeding, infection, and sampling were performed under light anes-
thesia via inhalation of isoflurane to reduce mouse suffering.
Design of 4MtG recombinant protein. Tetrameric tandem M2e polypeptides (4
copies) were stabilized by introducing a foreign tetramerization motif (tetra-)
GCN4 at the C-terminal of the recombinant 4MtG protein, as diagrammed in
Fig.1a58. The encoding gene of 4MtG was generated by primer extension with
overlapping Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A signal peptide encoding sequence
from honeybee melittin was employed to facilitate protein expression and secretion
in insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells (Sf9, ATCC, CRL-1711). A hexa-Histidine
tag sequence was added after the GCN4 motif sequence. In each M2e copy of
4MtG, the two site-mutations C17S and C19S were made. The nucleotide sequence
of 4MtG is shown in Supplementary Note 1. The four copies of different M2e
sequences and their order in 4MtG are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1a.
These consensus M2e sequences were made based on 11732 human, 5920 swine,
6267 avian, and 3270 domestic fowl influenza virus M2 sequences deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databank. Molecular
evolutionary genetics analysis version 6.0 (MEGA6) was used to align and analyze
sequences59. 4MtG was purified from recombinant baculovirus (rBV)-based pro-
tein expression in insect cells. In brief, the 4MtG encoding sequence was cloned
into the transfer vector pFastBac-1 (Invitrogen) for the rBV generation. 4MtG was
purified from the rBV-infected insect cell Sf9 culture supernatants by affinity
chromatograph.
Design of head-removed HA recombinant proteins. According to previous
results, trimerization motifs facilitate HA oligomerization in the absence of the HA
transmembrane domain17,18. A C-terminal sequence containing 6G3S or PGS
linker, trimerization motif (tri-) GCN4 and hexa-Histidine tag were added fol-
lowing the hrH1 or hrH3 sequences for oligomerization and purification purposes
(diagrammed in Fig. 1b). The coding sequence of the major head domain of H1
HA (GenBank Protein Accession: CAA24272.1, amino acids S53-P321) and the
major head domain of H3 HA (GenBank Protein Accession: BAF37221.1, amino
acids S61-P322) were replaced with a linker sequence encoding four glycines (4G),
which is predicted to be a flexible linker and not disrupt the folding of the
remainder of the molecule18,60. To inhibit the conformational shift to the post-
fusion form, the residues between F61 and L89 in HA2 of H1 and the residues
between F63 and I77 in HA2 of H3 were replaced with flexible non-hydrophobic
4G2S and 5G3S linkers, respectively. The F63 and V73 hydrophobic residues in
HA2 are largely responsible for stabilizing the coil of the low pH structure61. In the
neutral pH conformation, these deleted residues are a part of loop B connecting
helix A and helix C, and participate in the formation a single long helix ABC in the
low pH conformation. The deletion of part of loop B can block the formation of the
long helix ABC, fixing the protein structure in the pre-fusion state61. The region
between R76 and H106 is highly conserved among H3 viruses62. Therefore, the
loop B truncation in hrH3 ended at the hydrophobic residue I77 to retain the most
conserved regions. To further stabilize the hrH3 construct, an intra-disulfide bond
was introduced in H3 by site-mutagenesis at V325C in HA1 and S438C in HA2.
The encoding gene was generated from the full-length HA genes by overlapping
PCR. Recombinant hrH1 and hrH3 were purified from rBV-based insect cell
protein expression as done for the 4MtG purification.
Bis [sulfosuccinimidyl] (BS3) crosslinking. The oligomeric statesof purified
4MtG, hrH1, and hrH3 proteins were determined using the soluble Bis [sulfo-
succinimidyl] (BS3) crosslinker (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a cross-
linking reaction to fix the polymeric structures of proteins followed by reducing
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(Supplementary Fig. 5a, b) and Western blot using anti-His antibody at 1 µg/ml
(Cat. No. ab18184, Abcam) (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d), as described previously32.
Briefly, 1 μg recombinant protein was incubated at room temperature in the pre-
sence of 4 mM BS3 for 30 min. The crosslinking reaction was stopped by the
addition of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM.
PNps fabrication. PNps were made as previously described with modification32.
To make the 4MtG core PNps (Uni4MC), the 4MtG protein solution in DPBS
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was desolvated with a 4:1 volume ratio of
absolute ethanol to protein solution. 4.8 ml absolute ethanol was dripped at a
constant rate of 1 ml/min into 1.2 ml of 3.2 mg/ml 4MtG protein solution under
constant stirring by magnetic stir bar at 600 rpm at room temperature, followed by
centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature to pellet the PNps. The
PNp pellet was resuspended by sonication in either 1 ml 2.8 mg/ml hrH1 in DPBS,
1 ml 3.1 mg/ml hrH3 in DPBS, or 1 ml DPBS to generate hrH1 coated double-layer
PNps (Uni4C1), hrH3 coated double-layer PNps (Uni4C3) and uncoated PNps
(Uni4MC), respectively. The water-soluble, thiol-cleavable and primary amine-
reactive crosslinker 3,3′-dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP; Cat
No.21578, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to stabilize the resulting
PNps. Crosslinking reactions were performed in 5 mM DTSSP for 1 h while stirring
at 4 °C, and were quenched with 30 mM Tris-HCl solution at pH 7.4 for 15 min.
Following collection by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, PNps were
resuspended by sonication in 1 ml DPBS. The fabrication of OVA PNps was
described previously33.
PNp characterization. Nanoparticle size distribution was assessed by DLS with a
Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Westborough, MA). Protein
concentration in the PNp solution was assessed with a BCA assay per the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). PNps were resuspended
in water, air-dried, and sputter-coated with carbon prior to visualization with a
Zeiss LEO 1450vp scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 5.0
kV. Uni4C1, Uni4C3, and Uni4MC PNps were labelled with 1 µg/ml mouse
monoclonal antibody C179 (Cat No. M145, TaKaRa), 2 µg/ml 12D1 and the
antibody mixture of C179 and 12D1, respectively, and were then labelled with the
EM grade gold-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (15 nm, Cat No.
25133, AURION). Ten microliter droplets of stained PNp suspension were
adsorbed on a carbon/formvar coated 300-mesh copper grid for 5 min, followed by
removal of the remaining liquid with filter paper. Transmission electron micro-
scope LEO 906E (Carl Zeiss) was employed for visualization.
Antigen content of Uni4MC was analyzed in Western blot using anti-M2e
antibody at 1 μg/ml (14C2, Cat. No. MA1082, Invitrogen) (Supplementary Fig. 5e),
while Uni4C1 and Uni4C3 were analyzed in 10% SDS-PAGE (Supplementary
Fig. 5f).
Pull-down assay. The pull-down experiment was performed with Dynabeads
Protein G (Cat No. 10003D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 µl of Dynabeads protein G suspension was
incubated with rotation with 10 µg of C179, 12D1 or a mixture of these two
antibodies in 200 µl DPBS with 0.02% Tween-20 for 10 min at room temperature.
Tween-20 was used to avoid aggregation. The tube was placed on a magnet and
then the supernatant was removed. After removal of the tube from the magnet, 200
µl DPBS with 0.02% Tween-20 was added to resuspend the beads-Ab complex. To
avoid co-elution of antibody, 1 mM BS3 crosslinker reagent was added into the
beads-Ab complex and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the super-
natant was removed and collected (Pre-wash sample), 5 µg PNps Uni4C1 or
Uni4C3 were added to separate tubes containing beads-Ab complex and incubated
with rotation for 1 h at room temperature to allow PNps to bind to the beads-Ab
complex. When the tube was placed on the magnet, the supernatant was trans-
ferred to a clean tube for further analysis (Unbound fraction sample). The beads-

 Ab-PNp complex was washed three times using 200 µl DPBS for each wash, then
was resuspended in 100 µl DPBS and transferred into a clean tube. After removal of
the supernatant, 20 µl elution buffer (50 mM Glycine at pH 2.8) was added and the
beads-Ab-PNp complex was gently resuspended and incubated with rotation for 2
min at room temperature to dissociate the complex. The tube was placed on a
magnet and the supernatant containing eluted PNp was transferred to a clean tube
(Eluent sample). The collected Pre-wash, unbound fraction and eluent samples
were immediately analyzed using Western blot, where 8 µg/ml rabbit anti-His
polyclonal antibody (Cat No. PA1-983B, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for
blotting (Supplementary Fig. 5g).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding of hrHA to HA stem-specific
monoclonal antibodies C179 (Cat No. M145, Clontech Labratories, CA), 12D1 and
9H10 (12D1 and 9H10 monoclonal antibodies are kind gifts from Dr. Peter Palese,
Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai, New York) was tested using a sandwich-
ELISA method described previously19. C179, 12D1, and 9H10 were used as coating
antibodies. In 12D1 or 9H10 coated plates, 50 µl of 1:3 serially diluted FL H3
ectodomain protein, hrH3 and 4MtG were added for binding. In C179 coated
plates, diluted inactivated PR8 H1N1, hrH1, and 4MtG were added for binding. A
monoclonal anti-His-tag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(Cat No. R931-25, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used as the detection
antibody. The binding of 4MtG to M2e-specific monoclonal antibody 14C2
(Invitrogen) was tested using a sandwich-ELISA method. Monoclonal antibody
14C2 was used as the coating antibody.
Antibody titers were analyzed using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) as described previously36. M2e specific antibodies were titrated in
immunoplates coated with diverse M2e peptides from human consensus M2e
(huM2e), p09, Vtn, and SH. All M2e peptides were synthesized by Synpeptide Co
Ltd., Shanghai. PR8 H1, Aic H3, Vtn H5, and SH H7 specific antibodies were
titrated in immunoplates coated with different formalin-inactivated viruses,
including PR8 H1N1, Aic H3N2, rVn H5N1, and rSH H7N9. The IgG isotype titers
were determined by incubating with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Cat No. 1071-05, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) or
IgG2a secondary antibodies (Cat No. 1081-05, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL).
Antibodies cross-reactive to J57 H2 or GD H10 were titrated in cell-based ELISA.
HEK293T cells (ATCC No. CRL-1573) were transfected with engineered pCMV3
plasmid encoding FL H2 (strain: A/Japan/305/1957; Cat No. VG11088-UT, Sino
Biological. Inc.) or FL H10 (strain: A/duck/Guangdong/E1/2012; Cat No.
VG40351-UT, Sino Biological. Inc.) in Lipofectamine 2000 (Cat No. 11668019,
Invitrogen). The transfected HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 per
well in 96-well plate and was fixed by 80% acetone for 10 min at room temperature
prior to serum inoculation.
Immunization and influenza A virus challenges. Mice (BALB/c strain, female,
6–8-week-old) received intramuscular (i.m.) immunizations twice, at a 4-week
interval, in the hind leg with 50 μl of vaccine mixture in DPBS containing 10.5 μg
Uni4MC, 12 μg Uni4C1, 12 μg Uni4C3, 12 μg Uni4C13 (a formulation comprising
a mixture of 6 μg Uni4C1 and 6 μg Uni4C3 in DPBS) or 12 μg OVA PNps. Fifty
microliter DPBS was used as a placebo. Blood samples were collected at 1 day prior
to priming, 3 weeks after priming and boosting and 4 months after boosting to
examine the effects on long-term immunity. Four weeks after the boosting
immunization, mice were challenged intranasally with 6 × mLD50 of mouse
adapted (m.a.) influenza A virus strains in 50 μl DPBS. The m.a. strains used for
these challenges were PR823, p0934, Aic63, A/Philippines/2/1982 (Phi, H3N2)34,
rVn (rVtn; HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes were derived from Vtn, and the
remaining backbone genes from PR8) or rSH (rSH; HA and NA genes were derived
SH, and the remaining backbone genes from PR8).
The rVn H5N1 and rSH H7N9 reassortant viruses were generated and rescued
as previously described64,65. The backbone plasmid system for generating
reassortant virus was based on PR8 virus and generously provided by Dr. Robert
Gordon Webster. The H5 HA and N1 NA genes with non-coding regions derived
from H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) were chemically synthesized and cloned into
the pHW plasmids64. Plasmids pDZ with genes encoding H7 HA and N9 NA
derived from A/Shanghai/2/2013 were previously described65 and kindly provided
by Dr. Adolfo García-Sastre. The eight plasmids with 6:2 reassortant viral gene
segments were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). At day three post transfection, the virus-containing cell culture
supernatants were inoculated into the allantoic cavities of ten-day-old embryonated
chicken eggs. The rescue of reassortant viruses was determined by
hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells. Virus titers were determined by
plaque-forming units on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (Cat. No.
PAT-6500, ATCC).
Body weight loss and survival rates were monitored daily for 14 days post
infection. Weight loss of ≥20% was used as the endpoint at which mice were
euthanized per IACUC guidelines.
Interferon gamma (IFNγ) ELISpot procedures. The number of IFNγ secreting
cells after restimulation was evaluated using an ELISpot method described pre-
viously34. Briefly, 3 weeks after boosting, splenocytes were isolated from all
immunization groups. Each well in a 96-well filtration plate (Catalog Number:
MSIPS4W10, Fisher Scientific) was loaded with 5 × 105 splenocytes for restimu-
lation and a final concentration of 2 µg/ml of an M2e peptide pool (comprised of
equal amounts of huM2e, p09, Vtn, and SH M2e peptides), H1 peptide pool (NR-
15433 Peptide Array, H1N1 A/California/4/2009, Beiresources, NIAID), H3 pep-
tide pool (NR-19246 Peptide Array, H3N2 A/Brisbane/10/2007, Beiresources,
NIAID), or mock-restimulation. The developed plates were rinsed with purified
water and air dried before counting using a Bioreader-6000-E (Biosys, Germany).
Determination of lung virus titers. Three mice per immunization group were
euthanized at day 5 post 1 × mLD50 PR8 or Aic infection. Determination of lung
virus titers were described previously29. The presence of virus in the supernatant
was assayed by measuring the hemagglutinating activity in the supernatant, using
the Reed and Muench method for calculation66.
Histological analysis. Three mice per immunization group were euthanized at day
5 post 1 × mLD50 PR8 or Aic infection. Lung tissues were isolated and fixed with
10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixed lung tissues were embedded in paraffin and
processed for Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Three sections with 10 μm
thickness from three different parts of the lungs were stained with H&E and
examined microscopically by three unbiased pathologists. The severity of the
inflammation in the examined lung sections was scored on a scale of 0 to 5 (with
0.5 interval). Scores were given as absent (0), subtle (1), mild (2), moderate (3),
severe (4), and massive (5).
HAI assay. HAI titers of mouse immune sera were assayed as previously descri-
bed18 with viruses PR8, Aic H3N2, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (p68, H3N2), rVn or
rSH. The lowest serum dilution able to inhibit virus hemagglutination is shown.
Neutralization assay. The neutralization assay was described previously67. Pooled
serum samples were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C. Mixtures of virus with
final concentrations of 100 × TCID50 virus per mixture and two-fold serial diluted
serum samples (final serum dilution from 1:10 to 1:1280) were incubated for 2 h at
376 °C, 5% CO2 in 50 µl virus medium (DMEM, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin), then were subsequently added to the MDCK cells and incubated for
72 h at 376 °C, 5% CO2. A standard hemagglutination assay was performed to
measure virus inhibition.
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) surrogate assay. An ADCC
surrogate assay was performed according to the kit manufacturer’s protocol (Cat
No. M1211, Promega) with modification. Briefly, HEK293T cells were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin stock solu-
tion at 376 °C, 5% CO2. Two days before the experiment, HEK293T cells were
transfected with plasmid DNA encoding FL H1 (Cat No. VG11684-UT, Sino
Biological. Inc.) or H3 proteins (Cat No. VG1707-UT, Sino Biological. Inc.), using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The M2-expressing
MDCK cell68 culture medium was supplemented with 10 µM Amantadine (Sigma)
to support cell growth, 7.5 µg/ml of puromycin (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS at 376 °
C, 5% CO2. One day before the assay, transfected HEK293T and M2-expressing
MDCK cells were harvested and seeded in sterile white 96-well plates (Costar).
After 24 h, serum samples were heat inactivated for 30 min at 566 °C and then
serially diluted in assay buffer (4% ultra-low IgG FBS [Promega] in RPMI 1640
[Gibco]). Serum dilutions and a stable Jurkat cell line expressing mouse FcγRIV
(Cat No. M1211, Promega) were added and incubated for 6 h at 376 °C at a target-
effector ratio of 1:5. Cells were equilibrated to room temperature for 15 min before
Bio-Glo Luciferase assay substrate (Promega) was added. Luminescence was read
out after 10 min on a GloMax (Promega). Data are expressed as luminescence RLU
of signal in the absence of serum.
Depletion of AM. Depletion of AM was performed as described previously56.
Briefly, BALB/c mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with
ketamine/xylazine and then 100 µl PBS-liposomes or clodronate-liposomes were
administered slowly intratracheally (i.t.). Twenty-four hours after liposome
administration, mice were injected i.p. with 400 µl pre-immune serum or
Uni4C13 serum. After 24 h, mice were bled to determine serum titers by using M2e
peptide ELISA, and then were challenged with 3 × mLD50 Phi H3N2.
Statistical analysis. All data plotted with error bars are expressed as means with
standard derivation. The P values were generated by analyzing data with a two-tail
unpaired t test using the Prism 5 program (GraphPad software). Survival rate
statistical analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
