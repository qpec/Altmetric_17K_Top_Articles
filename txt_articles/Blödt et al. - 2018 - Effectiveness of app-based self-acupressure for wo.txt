Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea is common among women of reproductive age. Non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptives are effective treatments, although the failure
rate is around 20-25%.
Therefore additional evidence-based treatments are needed.
In recent years,
the use of smartphone applications (apps) has increased rapidly and may support individuals in self-
management strategies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of app-based self-
acupressure in women with menstrual pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-armed randomized
pragmatic trial was conducted from December 2012 to April 2015 with recruitment until August 2014
in Berlin, Germany, among women aged 18-34 years with self reported cramping pain ￿6 on a numeric
rating scale (NRS) for the worst pain intensity during the previous menstruation. After randomization
women performed either app-based self-acupressure (n=111) or followed usual care only (n=110) for six
consecutive menstruation cycles. The primary outcome was the mean pain intensity (NRS 0-10) on the
days with pain during the third menstruation. Secondary outcomes included worst pain intensity during
menstruation, duration of pain, 50% responder rates (reduction of mean pain by at least 50%), medica-
tion intake, sick leave days and body efficacy expectation assessed at the 1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd), and 6(th)
menstruation cycle. RESULTS: We included 221 women (mean age 24.0 (sd 3.6) years). The mean pain
intensity difference during the third menstruation was statistically significant in favor for acupressure
(acupressure: 4.4 95% CI [4.0; 4.7]; usual care 5.0 [4.6; 5.3]; mean difference -0.6 [-1.2; -0.1], p=0.026).
At the sixth cycle, the mean difference between the groups -1.4 [-2.0; -0.8] (p<0.001) reached clinical
relevance. At the third and sixth menstruation cycle, responder rate was 37% and 58% respectively in
the acupressure group in contrast to 23% and 24% in the usual care group. Moreover, the worst pain
intensity (group difference -0.6 [-1.2; -0.02] and -1.4 [-2.0; -0.7]), the number of days with pain (-0.4 [-0.9;
-0.01] and -1.2 [-1.6; -0.7]) and the proportion of women with pain medication at the third and sixth
menstruation cycle (odd ratio 0.5 [0.3; 0.9] and 0.3 [0.2; 0.5]) was lower in the acupressure group. At the
third cycle hormonal contraceptive use was more common in the usual care group than in the acupressure
group (odds ratio 0.5 [0.3;0.97]), but not statistically significant different at the sixth cycle (odds ratio
0.6 [0.3;1.1]). The number of sick leave days and body efficacy expectation (self-efficacy scale) did not
differ between groups. On a scale from 0-6, mean satisfaction with the intervention at the third cycle was
3.7 (sd 1.3), recommendation of the intervention to others 4.3 (1.5), appropriateness of acupressure for
menstrual pain 3.9 (1.4), and application of acupressure for other pain 4.3 (1.5). The intervention was
safe and after the sixth cycle two third of the women (67.6%) still applied acupressure on all days with
pain. CONCLUSION: Smartphone app delivered self-acupressure resulted in a reduction of menstrual
pain compared to usual care only. Effects were increasing over time and adherence was good. Future
trials should include comparisons to other active treatment options.

INTRODUCTION 
Primary dysmenorrhea1 affects up to 81% of reproductive women,2, 3 
with approximately 15% suffering from severe pain.2 Menstrual pain 
has a relevant impact on quality of life,4 and results in a 
substantial economic loss.5, 6 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptives are 
effective treatments,7 although the failure rate is around 20-25%5, 8, 
9 due to side-effects7, 10 and lack of effectiveness.10-12 Additional 
evidence-based treatments are needed.13 70% of women with menstrual 
pain practice self-management.10 A few studies have investigated the 
effect of self-acupressure for dysmenorrhea, mostly as an add-on to 
therapist-administered acupressure.13-16 Although results showed a 
beneficial effect for self-acupressure,17-21 the evidence is unclear 
due to risk of bias (mostly due to performance and attrition bias).13  
In recent years, the use of smartphone applications (apps)22 has 
increased rapidly. Mobile and electronic health solutions are 
already widely used in the general public and are seen as a valuable 
tool for various health problems22-25 and self-management26. Mobile 
health (mHealth) solutions might have improved the autonomy and 
participation of users already,26 for example by facilitating the 
search for information and health services, as well as by 
structuring of information and data. Health data is increasingly 
being collected via smartphones and portable devices (so-called 
wearables) and can be shared with doctors and other service 
providers. Individual behavior can be positively influenced with the 
help of behavioral change techniques and used, for example, for 
smoking cessation or weight control.27, 28 Only few mHealth solutions 
have been investigated in randomized controlled trials to date and 
the majority of available apps do not report any health care 
professional involvement in their development22, 25 Nevertheless, a 
strong increase in mHealth solutions and increasing integration into 
usual care is expected. App-based self-acupressure might be 
innovative to support women with menstrual pain, however up to now 
its effectiveness in a usual care setting is unclear.  
We aimed to investigate whether app-based self-acupressure is more 
effective in reducing pain than usual care for women with menstrual 
pain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Design 
We performed a two-armed, randomized pragmatic trial with a 
treatment duration and observation time of 6 menstruation cycles per 
woman. The design of the trial and the development of the smartphone 
app ‘AKUD’ were shaped by stakeholder engagement (see previous 
publication29). A statistician not involved in the study used 
‘ranuni’ random number generator of the SAS/STAT software (version 
9.2. SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to generate the randomization list 
(1:1 ratio). The list was transferred into a secured database 
(Microsoft Office Access 2010® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, 
USA)) and hidden behind the interface so that it was not accessible 
to anyone involved in the random allocation or treatment. Eligible 
women were randomized by clicking a button of the database 
interface. The result could not be changed, which ensured allocation 
concealment.  
This study followed the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki 30 
and the ICH-GCP guidelines, and was approved by the respective 
Ethics Committee (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin EA1/027/12). 
All patients gave oral and written informed consent. The trial was 
registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01582724) and the study 
protocol was published.29  
Participants and Setting 
Women were recruited in Berlin, Germany from December 2012 to August 
2014, using information materials (posters, flyers, and leaflets), 
the intranet platforms of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and 
students’ email-lists. Additionally, the study was advertised on two 
Berlin subway lines for 5 months. Telephone interviews were used for 
participants’ pre-screening. To facilitate recruitment, a financial 
compensation of 30 EUR was introduced after eight months.  
Participants were eligible for the trial if they fulfilled the 
following inclusion criteria: female; 18-25 years of age (criterion 
broadened to 18-34 years after eight months of recruitment to 
facilitate recruitment); having dysmenorrhea defined as self-
reported cramping pain during every menstrual cycle; no prior 
history of a gynecological disease that could be a reason for 
dysmenorrhea; having had menstruation in the last six weeks and a

duration of a menstruation cycle between 3 and 6 weeks; moderate or 
severe pain, defined as a score equal to or higher than 6 on a 
numeric rating scale (NRS, 0 to 10) for the worst pain intensity 
during the last menstruation; written and oral informed consent. 
Participants had to own a smartphone (iOS or Android) and to agree 
to enter study data through the app. Patients were not eligible for 
the trial if they fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria: 
already using or planning to use: acupressure, acupuncture, shiatsu 
or/and tuina massage in the following 8 months; known pregnancy or 
planned pregnancy in the following 8 months.  
Intervention and control group 
Both treatment groups received the app AKUD (Software development: 
Smart Mobile Factory, Berlin, Germany), which included a 
visualization of the menstrual cycle, questionnaires and diaries for 
both groups.  
Acupressure specific features were only available for the 
acupressure group. These included explanations of the acupressure 
procedure, drawings, videos, and photos of the acupressure points, 
as well as a timer to guide the one-minute acupressure of each 
point. The acupressure intervention (points, duration, setting) 
resulted from a written Delphi consensus with international 
acupuncture experts from China, Germany and the USA.29 The 
acupuncture points SP6 (Sanyinjiao), LI4 (Hegu), and LR3 (Taichong) 
were used on both sides. In the acupressure group a health care 
professional introduced the acupressure based on the instruction of 
the app at the baseline visit (Table 1). The women were reminded by 
the app every noon to apply acupressure starting five days before 
the anticipated menstruation. User could switch off the reminders 
within the app. To keep the intervention standardized, the app 
received no major updates. 
Women in the control group did not receive any study specific 
intervention. After the sixth menstruation cycle, i.e. end of the 
study, the acupressure features were activated within the app and a 
personal face-to-face introduction to acupressure was offered. 
The acupressure and the control groups could continue with usual 
care during the study, which was defined as all medical and non-
medical treatments with the exception of tuina, shiatsu, and 
acupuncture because of the use of similar pressure points.

Outcome measurements 
The primary outcome measure was the mean pain intensity on the days 
with pain during the third menstruation on a numerical rating scale 
(NRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) assessed 
retrospectively after the third menstruation.31 The NRS and the time 
point were chosen based on the stakeholder process in preparation of 
the trial29 and previous literature on acupressure on dysmenorrhea14. 
The NRS is easy to apply and well suited for implementation in a 
smartphone app and three months seem long enough to allow the 
development of an acupressure effect without risking recruitment or 
study adherence because of a relatively long study duration. 
Secondary outcomes were assessed during and after the first, second, 
third, and sixth menstruation cycle by the app in both groups and 
included worst pain intensity during menstruation (NRS), duration of 
pain (number of days with pain), responder rates (50% reduction of 
mean pain intensity on the days with pain compared to the 
corresponding baseline value), pain medication, sick leave (days of 
absence from work or school due to menstrual pain), body efficacy 
expectation,32 adverse events and suspected adverse reactions 
(intervention group only). Women in the acupressure group were also 
asked at the third cycle about satisfaction with the intervention. 
On the days where acupressure was recommended women were asked to 
record the number of acupressure sessions and the time they spent 
for the acupressure.  
At baseline, self-reported data were collected by paper pencil. All 
other questionnaires and diaries were imbedded into the app. Most 
outcomes were collected by questionnaires within the app at the end 
of the menstruation, however data on pain medication and time spent 
for acupressure were collected by the app’s diary. Women were 
reminded by app notifications every day at noon during the 
menstruation to fill in the questions of the diary. In addition they 
were reminded at the respective time point to complete the 
questionnaires at the last day of menstruation at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 
and 6th menstruation. In the acupressure group this notification was 
combined with the reminder to apply acupressure.

Statistical analysis 
The study was designed to detect an effect size of 0.5 for the 
primary outcome measure (menstrual pain), with a power of 90% and a 
significance level of 5% using a two-sided t-test. Based on previous 
acupuncture studies, we assumed a mean of 5.5 in the control group 
and 4.0 in the intervention group, with a pooled standard deviation 
of 3 resulting in a total of 86 participants per group. Taking a 
potential drop-out rate of about 20% into account, 220 participants 
(110 per group) were planned. The primary analysis population was 
the full analysis set (FAS, with available data for the respective 
analysis) based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle of 
including each woman into the analysis according to her 
randomization group regardless of her adherence to the assigned 
intervention. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with the treatment as fixed effect, the baseline 
NRS value as fixed covariate and a two-sided significance level of 
5%. Secondary outcomes were analyzed similarly, i.e. ANCOVA, or 
logistic or Poisson regression (depending on the scale and 
distribution of the data), adjusted for the respective baseline 
value (if available).  
As sensitivity analysis multiple imputation techniques were done 
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation and FCS (fully 
conditional specification) methods.33 The imputation model included 
all variables for the primary and secondary outcomes and age. 
Furthermore, in case of relevant differences in baseline variables 
between the treatment groups, those unbalanced variables were used 
as covariates for the analysis of the primary outcome. Additionally, 
we evaluated the subgroups of i) women with hormonal contraceptive 
use at baseline, ii) women with a migration background, and iii) age 
≥ 26 vs. < 26 years. Subgroups were evaluated using the interaction 
term of the respective subgroup with the treatment group in the 
analysis model. 
As further supportive analysis, mixed models for repeated measures 
(MMRM) was fitted to compare the treatment groups with respect to 
changes in the primary outcome over time. The model included terms 
for treatment (acupressure vs. control) and time as fixed main 
effects, an interaction term for treatment by time, the baseline 
value as covariate, and the subject as a random effect.

Analysis was done using SPSS 21.0 and SAS 9.4 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
USA). 
 
RESULTS 
Participants  
The study was conducted between December 2012 and April 2015 with 
recruitment from December 2012 until August 2014.  
Out of 446 screened women, 221 were eligible for the study and gave 
consent and were randomized either to self-acupressure (n=111) or to 
usual care (n=110)(Figure 1).  
The women had a mean age of 24.0 (sd 3.6) years, were highly 
educated, with 89.6% having 12 or more years of school education 
(Table 2). 37 women (16.7%) had a migration background. At baseline, 
the mean pain intensity on the days with pain on the NRS was 6.2 (SD 
1.6) and most women (81.0%) had taken medication during their last 
menstruation. The following group differences with possible 
relevance were seen at baseline: fewer women in the usual care group 
(65.1%) had a partner (acupressure group 78.4%) and more women in 
the usual care group used oral contraceptives (36.4% vs. 23.4%).  
Outcomes 
Both groups showed a reduction in pain at the third and sixth 
menstruation cycle. The primary outcome measurement (mean pain 
intensity on the days of pain during the third cycle after therapy 
start) showed a statistically significant difference in favor for 
the acupressure group (acupressure: 4.4 95% CI [4.0; 4.7]; usual 
care 5.0 [4.6; 5.3]; mean difference -0.6 [-1.2; -0.1], p=0.026; 
(Table 3 and Figure 2). At the sixth menstruation cycle, the mean 
difference between the groups increased (-1.4 95% CI [-2.0; -0.8], 
p<0.001) and was considered clinically relevant34. The effect size 
(Cohen’s d) for the mean pain intensity was 0.24 at the third cycle 
and 0.63 at the sixth cycle. Moreover, the chance to be a responder 
was higher for women in the acupressure group after the first, the 
third, and the sixth cycle with odds ratios of 2.3 [1.0; 5.2], 2.0 
[1.1; 3.6], and 4.4 [2.5; 7.9], respectively.  
At the third and sixth menstruation cycle the worst pain intensity 
(group difference -0.6 [-1.2; -0.02] and -1.4 [-2.0; -0.7]), the

number of days with pain (-0.4 [-0.9; -0.01] and -1.2 [-1.6; -0.7]), 
and the proportion of women with pain medication (odd ratio 0.5 
[0.3; 0.9] and 0.3 [0.2; 0.5]) was lower in the acupressure group. 
Hormonal contraceptive use was more common in the usual care group 
than in the acupressure group at the third cycle (odds ratio 0.5 
[0.3;0.97]), but not statistically significant different at the 
sixth cycle (odds ratio 0.6 [0.3;1.1]). The number of sick leave 
days and body efficacy expectation (self-efficacy scale) did not 
differ between groups (Table 3).  
On a scale from 0-6 mean satisfaction with the intervention at the 
third cycle was 3.7 (SD 1.3), recommendation of the intervention to 
others (4.3 (1.5)), appropriateness of acupressure for menstrual 
pain (3.9 (1.4)), and application of acupressure for other pain (4.3 
(1.5)). 
Findings were similar and no relevant difference between results of 
primary, sensitivity and subgroup analyses could be observed. The 
baseline characteristics of women in both groups, who dropped out 
before the third menstruation cycle, did not differ relevantly from 
those who did not drop out. 
 
Safety data 
In the self-acupressure group, 15 women reported having had at least 
one suspected adverse reaction (SAR). Over all cycles, the following 
SARs were mentioned: bruises (n=5), deterioration (n=3), pain in the 
hand (n=1), pressure pain (n=1), shift in menstruation cycle (n=3), 
dizziness (n=1), nausea (n=1), pain in the legs (n=1), tingling in a 
finger (n=2). Of those who mentioned a SAR, 10 women experienced a 
SAR at one cycle, 3 at 2 cycles, and 2 at 3 cycles. With the 
exception of one woman, all continued to apply self-acupressure. 
This woman stopped applying self-acupressure at the sixth cycle 
because of bruises, pressure pain, and tightness in the breast. She 
had already mentioned pressure pain at the first cycle, which had 
made it difficult to continue self-acupressure, though she did not 
state any SAR at the second and third cycles.  
Two serious adverse events occurred in each treatment group (self-
acupressure: hip surgery, hospitalization due to dizziness; usual 
care: surgery of the nose, appendix surgery). None was considered 
related to the trial or the trial intervention.

Overall adherence was good, but declined slightly over time. At the 
first cycle, 108 (97.3%) of the women stated that they had practiced 
acupressure on at least one day during the menstruation cycle, and 
at the sixth cycle this number was 92 (82.9%). Fewer women practiced 
acupressure on all days with pain (first cycle 102 [91.9%]; second 
cycle 89 [80.1%]; third cycle 91 [82.0%]; sixth cycle 75 [67.6%]). 
The mean duration of one practice session was similar over all 
cycles (first cycle: before menstruation 5.3 minutes (mean) (SD 
2.1), during menstruation 5.4 (1.7); sixth cycle: before 
menstruation 5.4 (1.5), during menstruation 5.3 (1.5), Table 3). 
Women spent about 82.5 minutes [95%CI: 73.2-91.7] for acupressure 
during the first cycle, and 78.8 minutes [68.8-88.8], 76.8 minutes 
[67.3-86.4], and 68.7 minutes [57.7-79.7] for the second, third and 
sixth cycle, respectively.

COMMENT 
Participating women with menstrual pain who applied self-acupressure 
supported by a smartphone app experienced statistically significant 
different pain relief after three menstruation cycles in comparison 
to women who received usual care. After 6 menstruation cycles, in 
the intervention group pain further decreased, resulting in a 
clinically relevant difference between both groups. 
The strengths of this trial include the randomized study design, the 
high number of participants for an interventional randomized trial 
on acupressure, and the high adherence and follow-up rates. By using 
a smartphone app for the delivery of the intervention and for data 
collection, the trial used a novel study approach. Moreover, we 
consider the results to be transferrable to standard care settings 
because this pragmatic trial resulted from an extensive stakeholder 
engagement process.29 
However, the results of our trial might have been influenced by the 
selection of our sample. Although we aimed at a diverse sample by 
advertising on public transport almost ninety percent of 
participants had at least twelve years of school education which is 
more than the average population. Furthermore, one third of the 
screened women failed eligibility. These aspects do impact the 
generalizability of the results. Our outcome assessment was reduced 
to a minimum29 because stakeholders suggested that the outcome 
assessment should be short and patient-relevant, and data should be 
collected by an app.  
The whole trial duration, including the preparation for the app, 
took 4.5 years which is a long time for a trial on consumer 
technology.35 In contrast, a longer follow-up time might have 
provided more insight about long-term use. Based on the development 
of the primary outcome over time a longer follow-up might have shown 
an even higher effect. However, due to the relatively short follow-
up time it is also possible that we have over-estimated the impact 
of treatment. Recruitment for this trial was difficult, and a longer 
study duration might have had a further inhibiting impact on 
recruitment. For future studies, ways to accelerate recruitment are 
needed. To keep the intervention standardized, our app received no 
major updates. However, an advanced development of the app for 
future studies is already in progress.

Considering the large number of available mobile Health (mHealth) 
apps for smartphones, only few have been evaluated in an RCT 
setting.27, 28, 36, 37 To our knowledge, no RCT evaluating a smartphone 
app using acupressure or targeting menstrual pain had previously 
been conducted. According to the updated Cochrane Review 
“Acupuncture for dysmenorrhoea,” which included acupressure trials, 
evidence is insufficient to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture 
or acupressure are effective in treating primary dysmenorrhea due to 
the methodological limitation of the included studies.13 Although our 
rigorously designed trial might support the evidence base in favor 
of acupressure, it might also be associated with a high risk of bias 
because of the lack of blinding.38 However, we think that our trial 
can contribute valuable data to its effectiveness in usual care. 
Our results might have practical implications, because they could 
add a self-care option to the recommended treatment options of oral 
contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, 
which are effective but have limitations due to side-effects7, 10 and 
failure rates,5 Moreover, self-care treatments such as rest, 
medication, heating pads, tea, exercise, and herbs are already 
practiced by women with menstrual pain.10 Therefore an additional 
non-drug and self-care treatment option might fit well into women’s 
perceptions of how to treat menstrual pain39 and might further 
support self-empowerment of affected women.  
In our trial, for self-care acupressure the effect increased over 
time showing clinical relevance on the pain scale after six cycles34 
and a responder rate of about 60%. A similar increase was also shown 
by a trial from Chen et al.19 However, most trials on acupressure and 
dysmenorrhea had shorter follow-ups.14 That the adherence was still 
high after three months and the effect increased over time is 
encouraging. Regarding the high prevalence of menstrual pain, a 
treatment option with a modest to moderate effect and a good safety 
profile might have a considerable public health impact and should be 
further evaluated. It would be interesting to compare app-based 
self-acupressure with other active treatment in future research. 
To conclude, self-acupressure supported and evaluated by a 
smartphone app could achieve a sustainable reduction in pain and 
medication in comparison to usual care. This self-care intervention 
showed a high retention rate and was safe. We suggest that future

Table 1. Instructions for applying the acupressure 
Carrying out acupressure 
Find a comfortable sitting position. The right point will feel more 
sensitive than the surrounding area, it can be that you feel a 
slight soreness. When you have found the point, massage the area 
with the thumb using medium force (strong enough, but not so strong 
that you injure yourself) in small circles. Pay attention that you 
use circular movements and do not rub back and forth. While 
massaging, you should notice a distinct sensation, e.g. slight 
soreness, tingling, hypersensitivity, or heaviness. 
Method 
Concentrate on the points as you are massaging them. Massage the 
points on both sides consecutively for one minute each. Start the 
timer. 
Application 
Begin 5 days before you get your period. As a function of the app, 
you will receive a reminder of when you should begin the 
acupressure. Before your period, carry out the acupressure twice a 
day if possible; on days when this is not possible, carry out the 
acupressure at least once a day. During your period, on the painful 
days carry out the acupressure at least twice a day. If you like, 
you can repeat the acupressure up to 5 times.
