Alcohol drinking patterns and liver cirrhosis risk: analysis of 
the prospective UK Million Women Study

Summary
Background Alcohol is a known cause of cirrhosis, but it is unclear if the associated risk varies by whether alcohol is 
drunk with meals, or by the frequency or type of alcohol consumed. Here we aim to investigate the associations 
between alcohol consumption with meals, daily frequency of consumption, and liver cirrhosis.
Methods The Million Women Study is a prospective study that includes one in every four UK women born between 
1935 and 1950, recruited between 1996 and 2001. In 2001 (IQR 2000–03), the participants reported their alcohol 
intake, whether consumption was usually with meals, and number of days per week it was consumed. Cox regression 
analysis yielded adjusted relative risks (RRs) for incident cirrhosis, identified by follow-up through electronic linkage 
to routinely collected national hospital admission, and death databases.
Findings During a mean of 15 years (SD 3) of follow-up of 401 806 women with a mean age of 60 years (SD 5), without 
previous cirrhosis or hepatitis, and who reported drinking at least one alcoholic drink per week, 1560 had a hospital 
admission with cirrhosis (n=1518) or died from the disease (n=42). Cirrhosis incidence increased with amount of 
alcohol consumed (≥15 drinks [mean 220 g of alcohol] vs one to two drinks [mean 30 g of alcohol] per week; RR 3·43, 
95% CI 2·87–4·10; p<0·0001). About half of the participants (203 564 of 401 806) reported usually drinking with 
meals and, after adjusting for amount consumed, cirrhosis incidence was lower for usually drinking with meals than 
not (RR 0·69, 0·62–0·77; p<0·0001; wine-only drinkers RR 0·69, 0·56–0·85; all other drinkers RR 0·72, 0·63–0·82). 
Among 175 618 women who consumed seven or more drinks per week, cirrhosis incidence was greater for daily 
consumption than non-daily consumption (adjusted RR 1·61, 1·40–1·85; p<0·0001). Daily consumption, together 
with not drinking with meals, was associated with more than a doubling of cirrhosis incidence (adjusted RR 2·47, 
1·96–3·11; p<0·0001).
Interpretation In middle-aged women, cirrhosis incidence increases with total alcohol intake, even at moderate levels 
of consumption. For a given weekly intake of alcohol, this excess incidence of cirrhosis is higher if consumption is 
usually without meals, or with daily drinking.

Introduction
Alcohol is a known cause of liver cirrhosis, with its 
incidence increasing in relation to the total amount of 
alcohol consumed.1–7 Evidence for how cirrhosis risk is 
affected by drinking habits, such as whether or not 
alcohol is usually drunk with meals or is consumed 
every day or less often, or by the type of alcohol 
consumed, is scarce.7–12 For example, we found only one 
report that had examined associations with drinking 
with meals—a cross-sectional study of 35 cases of 
cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer.8 Drinking with meals 
and the frequency of consumption are correlated with 
the total intake of alcohol, so large numbers of study 
participants are needed to examine the separate effects 
of different drinking practices reliably, allowing for the 
effects of the correlated exposures.
The Million Women Study includes one in every 
four UK women born between 1935 and 1950.13 In this 
prospective study, the weekly amount of alcohol 
consumed has been shown to be a strong predictor of 
cirrhosis incidence, even at the moderate levels of alcohol 
intake that are typical for UK women of this generation.6 
Information on other drinking habits was also collected 
in this study. Our aim was to investigate associations 
between liver cirrhosis risk and alcohol consumption 
with meals, the number of days per week alcohol was 
consumed, and the type of beverage drunk, taking careful 
account of total alcohol intake, other related drinking 
habits and possible confounders.
Methods 
Study design and participants
The Million Women Study is a prospective study that 
includes 1·3 million UK women, mostly between age 50 
and 64 years when they were recruited from May 1, 1996, 
to Dec 31, 2001, through the UK National Health Service 
(NHS) Breast Screening Programme by completing an 
initial study questionnaire.13 The women have been sent 
postal re-survey questionnaires every 3–5 years thereafter. 
Every questionnaire asks about alcohol consumption.

Questions about drinking with meals and the number of 
days per week alcohol was consumed were asked for the 
first time about 3 years after recruitment, in median 
year 2001 (IQR 2000–03), and this 3-year re-survey was 
the baseline for these analyses. The questionnaires and 
data access policies can be viewed on the study website.14 
From 2010 onwards, women who provided a valid email 
address were also asked to complete a 24-h recall of diet, 
including alcohol consumption, on a randomly selected 
day of the week.15
Women were excluded from the analyses if, before 
baseline, they were registered with cancer, except non-
melanoma skin cancer (n=47 378), or if, at or before 
baseline, they self-reported or had a hospital admission 
with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis (WHO International 
Classification of Diseases tenth revision [ICD-10] 
 
codes K70, K73, and K74; n=1369) or viral hepatitis 
(ICD-10 B15–B19; n=723).16 Women were also excluded 
if, at baseline, they did not report the number of 
alcoholic drinks they consumed per week (n=106 329) or 
if they did not report whether they usually drank the 
alcohol with meals (n=42 114).
The study was approved by the Oxford and Anglia 
multicentre research ethics committee, and all participants 
provided written consent for follow-up. Access to hospital 
admission data was approved by NHS Digital in England 
and by the Information Services Division in Scotland. 
Procedures
Women were asked the number of alcoholic drinks they 
consumed per week; if they usually drank alcohol with 
meals, without meals, or if it varied; and the number of 
days per week on which they usually drank alcohol. 
Participants were requested to report zero if they drank 
less than one alcoholic drink per week and they are 
defined here as non-drinkers. Drinkers are defined as 
those who reported drinking one or more alcoholic 
drinks per week. One drink was specified in the 
questionnaire as one glass of wine, half a pint of lager, or 
a tot of spirits. Separate questions about the consumption 
of wine, spirits, and lager, beer, or cider were asked at 
recruitment but not repeated 3 years later.
Drinkers were grouped into four categories of reported 
alcohol consumption (drinks per week) at baseline: 
one to two, three to six, seven to 14, and 15 or more. To 
allow for changes in alcohol consumption over time, 
measurement error and regression dilution bias, repeat 
measures of alcohol intake were used to derive mean 
intakes in g/week within each of the four baseline groups 
(appendix p 4).17 The repeat measures were taken from 
alcohol intake reported online in a 24-h recall of diet, 
which included questions about alcohol intake, sent to 
participants on randomly selected days of the week; 
responses were completed for the day specified 
by 19 293 analysis participants, in 2010–17, a mean 
of 11 (SD 2) years after they completed the baseline 
questionnaire (appendix p 4).
The analyses focused on women who reported drinking 
at least one alcoholic drink per week, because the majority 
of women reporting drinking less than one drink per 
week were likely to be ex-drinkers (in a subsequent 
questionnaire, completed 9 years after baseline for these 
analyses, only about one out of every seven who reported 
drinking no drinks per week at baseline were lifelong 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE with a mixture of MeSH subject 
headings and keywords (“alcohol”, “alcohols”, “ethanol”, 
“alcohol consumption”, “alcoholic beverages”, or “alcohol 
drinking”) and (“hepatic cirrhosis” or “liver cirrhosis”) for 
meta-analyses or prospective studies with more than 100 cases 
of cirrhosis in humans from 1946 to Jan 20, 2018. Because of 
the small number of prospective studies with relevant results 
on mealtime habits and frequency of consumption, we 
expanded the search to any study if relative risks or the 
equivalent were given. Further searches were done by reading 
papers identified as suitable from database and other searches. 
Many prospective studies and two meta-analyses from 2004 
and 2010 reported increasing risks of cirrhosis with increasing 
levels of alcohol consumption. However, there was little 
published information on associations with mealtime habits or 
the frequency of consumption.
Added value of this study
This large prospective study with long follow-up permitted 
detailed examination of cirrhosis risk in relation to the amount 
of alcohol consumed, consumption with meals, and the 
frequency of consumption, adjusted for drinking patterns and 
other potential confounding factors. During a mean of 15 years 
(SD 3) of follow-up of 401 806 UK women who consumed 
alcohol, 1560 developed or died from cirrhosis. As expected, 
cirrhosis risk increased with the amount of alcohol consumed. 
After allowing for the amount consumed, the excess risk of 
cirrhosis was consistently lower among those who usually 
drank alcohol with meals, both overall (RR 0·69, p<0·0001) 
and separately in women who drank wine only and all other 
drinkers. Among women who drank seven or more alcoholic 
drinks per week, the excess risk of cirrhosis was greater with 
daily consumption than with less frequent consumption 
(RR 1·61, p<0·0001). Drinking daily and not with meals was 
associated with a doubling of cirrhosis risk.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study confirms that even moderate levels of alcohol 
consumption increase the risk of cirrhosis. It also shows that, 
after adjusting for the amount of alcohol consumed, this excess 
incidence of cirrhosis is higher if consumption is usually 
without meals or with daily drinking.

non-drinkers). Ex-drinkers might have stopped drinking 
because of poor health and could differ from drinkers in 
ways that might be hard to measure but are potentially 
linked to the development of cirrhosis.18
Using each individual’s unique NHS number, par-
ticipants were followed by electronic record linkage to 
routinely collected NHS data on deaths, emigrations, and 
hospital admissions (by NHS Digital in England19 and 
by the Information Services Division in Scotland20). 
Diagnoses were coded to ICD-10.16
Outcomes
Participants were classified as having liver cirrhosis 
(ICD-10 K70 or K74) if they had either a hospital 
admission where cirrhosis was recorded or if the disease 
was listed as the underlying cause of death.
Statistical analysis
For the 401 806 women included in this analysis, person-
years were calculated from the date that the baseline 
questionnaire was completed to the earliest of the 
following: hospital admission with cirrhosis, emigration, 
death, or end of follow-up, which was March 31, 2017 (the 
last date when follow-up was complete).
Cox proportional hazard models were used, with time 
since baseline as the underlying time variable, to estimate 
the hazard ratios (referred to as relative risks [RRs]) and 
their 95% CIs for cirrhosis. When more than two groups 
were compared, group-specific CIs were calculated to 
allow direct comparison between any two groups.21 
Conventional CIs are quoted in the text.
To ensure that comparisons were made within women 
who were as similar as possible, all analyses were 
stratified by single year of birth (1930 or earlier, individual 
years from 1931 to 1949, 1950 or later) and single year of 
completing the baseline questionnaire (2000 or earlier, 
2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 or later), and were adjusted for 
five regions of residence in the UK (London and 
Southeast, Southwest, Midlands, Northern England, 
Scotland), deprivation quintile (according to the 
Townsend index22), smoking (never, past, or current; if 
current, <ten, ten to 19, ≥20 cigarettes per day), oral 
contraceptive use (ever or never), hormone replacement 
therapy use (never, past, current, or ever), and body-mass 
index (BMI; <22·5, 22·5–24·9, 25·0–27·4, 27·5–29·9, or 
≥30 kg/m²). Adjustment variables were from baseline 
except for deprivation, oral contraceptive use, and height 
for BMI, which were from recruitment. So that the same 
women were included in all analyses, the small numbers 
with missing data for each adjustment variable were 
included as a separate category. Where appropriate, 
analyses were also adjusted for the number of alcoholic 
drinks consumed per week reported at baseline (one to 
two, three to six, seven to 14, and ≥15), type of alcohol 
usually consumed (wine-only drinkers or all other 
drinkers), mealtime habits (usually consume alcohol 
with meals; do not usually consume alcohol with meals, 
or it varies), and frequency of consumption (daily or 
non-daily).
For analyses of the amount of alcohol consumed, those 
who reported drinking one to two alcoholic drinks per week 
were the reference category. For analyses of RR associations 
with mealtime habits, the reference category was women 
who reported drinking without meals. For analyses of 
associations with the frequency of consumption, those 
consuming fewer than seven drinks per week were 
excluded (as their typical daily intake would, by 
definition, be less than one drink a day) and the reference 
category was women who reported non-daily consumption.

For comparisons of the combined effect of frequency and 
mealtime habits, the reference category was non-daily 
consumption of alcohol, usually with meals.
We did sensitivity analyses for the effect of mealtime 
habits and frequency of consumption, including women 
with missing values for alcohol intake at baseline by 
substituting reported alcohol intake at recruitment. We 
also assessed these associations separately in subgroups 
defined by women’s BMI (<25 kg/m² vs ≥ 25 kg/m²) and 
smoking status (current smokers vs never smokers).
Stata, version 15.1, was used for all analyses. All 
statistical tests were two-sided. Statistical significance 
was defined at a p value of less than 0·05.

Results
Among the 401 806 women without previous liver 
disease who reported consuming at least one alcoholic 
drink per week, 71 649 (18%) reported consuming one to 
two drinks per week, 149 523 (37%) three to six drinks 
per week, 142 762 (36%) seven to 14 drinks per week, and 
37 872 (9%) 15 or more drinks per week. For each of 
these four baseline categories we calculated the mean 
daily alcohol intake (g/day) based on 24-h recall of 
alcohol intake on randomly selected days of the week, 
reported 11 years after baseline (figure 1). For every 
baseline consumption category, the average daily intake 
was greater on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays than on 
other days. For every baseline category, weekly intakes 
assessed 11 years after baseline agreed with the weekly 
baseline intakes, with slight regression to the mean: for 
one to two, three to six, seven to 14, and 15 or more 
drinks per week, the mean remeasured values were 2·5, 
5·2, 10·0, and 18·0 drinks per week, respectively; ie, 30, 
62, 120, and 216 g/week. Information on the type of 
alcohol consumed at recruitment also agreed with that 
reported 11 years after baseline; for example, among 
wine-only drinkers at recruitment who reported at 24-h 
recall that they had drunk alcohol the previous day, 3480 
(78%) of 4486 reported drinking wine and no other 
alcohol type that day.
During 5 835 149 person-years of follow-up, a mean of 
15 (SD 3) years per woman, 1560 had a first record of 
cirrhosis at a hospital admission (n=1518) or as the 
underlying cause of death (n=42). Cirrhosis risk increased 
with the total amount of alcohol consumed per week 
(figure 2). The adjusted RR of cirrhosis for 15 or more

versus one to two drinks per week (ie, for an average of 
220 g vs 30 g of alcohol per week) was 3·43 (95% CI 
2·87–4·10; p<0·0001).
Overall, about half of the women (203 564 [51%] of 
401 806) reported usually drinking with meals and the 
remaining half reported not usually drinking with meals, 
or in a varied manner. Women who usually drank with 
meals consumed slightly less alcohol (83 g/week) than 
women who did not usually drink with meals (95 g/week) 
at baseline; they were also less likely to be current 
smokers and live in deprived areas (table). These factors 
are, however, considered in analyses of mealtime 
drinking and cirrhosis risk. The intakes within each 
baseline category reported at 24-h recall were similar for 
those who, at baseline, reported usually drinking with 
meals and for those who reported drinking without 
meals (appendix p 6).
At every level of alcohol consumption, cirrhosis 
incidence was lower in women who usually drank with 
meals compared with those who did not (figure 3). After 
adjusting for the amount of alcohol consumed (one to 
two, three to six, seven to 14, and ≥15 drinks per week) 
and the six other potential confounding factors (ie, 
region, deprivation quintile, smoking, BMI, past oral 
contraceptive use, and use of menopausal hormones), the 
RR for cirrhosis associated with usually drinking with 
meals compared with not drinking with meals was 0·69 
(95% CI 0·62–0·77; p<0·0001). Type of alcohol consumed 
had been reported by 393 900 (98%) of 401 806 women 
included in the analyses. Consumption of wine and no 
other alcohol type was more common in women who 
drank with meals (87 360 [44%] of 200 246) than in those 
who did not (48 268 [25%] of 193 654). Nevertheless, both 
among wine-only drinkers and also among all other 
drinkers, cirrhosis risk was lower in women who usually 
drank with meals than in women who did not (figure 4). 
After adjustment for the amount of alcohol consumed 
and the other factors, the RRs associated with drinking 
with meals were similar in drinkers of wine only 
(RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·56–0·85) and in all other drinkers 
(RR 0·72, 0·63–0·82); RRs associated with meals also did 
not differ significantly by women’s adiposity (RR 0·68, 
0·57–0·81 for BMI of <25 kg/m² and 0·68, 0·59–0·79 for 
BMI ≥25 kg/m²) or between current and never smokers 
(RR 0·84, 0·66–1·06 and 0·67, 0·56–0·80). Examination 
of the separate effect of every adjustment factor indicated 
that the main confounding was by the total amount 
of alcohol consumed and by cigarette smoking 
(appendix p 7).
Among the 175 618 women who reported drinking at 
least seven drinks per week and also reported frequency 
of consumption, those who drank daily had greater total 
intakes of alcohol (161 g/week) than non-daily drinkers 
(134 g/week; table). There was little difference in other 
characteristics between the two groups. For a given 
alcohol intake, the RR of cirrhosis was greater in those 
who reported drinking alcohol daily than those who drank 
less often than daily (figure 5). After adjustment for the 
total amount consumed (seven to 14, 15–21, and 
≥22 drinks per week), mealtime habits, and type of 
alcohol, the RR for cirrhosis for daily versus less frequent 
consumption was 1·61 (95% CI 1·40–1·85; p<0·0001). 
Examination of the separate effect of each adjustment 
factor indicated that the greatest confounding was by the 
total amount of alcohol drunk and if consumption was 
with meals (appendix p 8). RRs did not differ significantly 
by women’s adiposity (RR 1·51, 1·21–1·89 for BMI 
of <25 kg/m² and 1·67, 1·37–2·03 for ≥25 kg/m²) or 
between current (RR 1·52, 1·18–1·97) and never smokers 
(RR 1·54, 1·18–2·01). Among women consuming at least 
seven drinks per week, the adjusted RR associated with 
drinking on 4–6 days versus fewer than 4 days per week 
was 1·27 (95% CI 1·01–1·59; p=0·041). 
When mealtime habits and frequency of consumption 
were considered simultaneously, the RR of cirrhosis 
associated with drinking daily and not with meals more 
than doubled, after additional adjustment for type 
and amount of alcohol consumed (RR 2·47, 95% CI 
1·96–3·11; p<0·0001).
In sensitivity analyses using reported alcohol at 
recruitment as a substitute for missing values of alcohol 
intake at baseline, the RRs for cirrhosis by mealtime 
habits or frequency of consumption were similar to the 
main results reported here (appendix pp 10, 11).
Among the 393 900 women for whom the types of 
alcohol consumed were recorded, most (225 766 [57%]

of 393 900) reported consuming more than one type of 
alcohol; 135 628 (34%) of 393 900 reported drinking wine 
only, and relatively few reported consuming spirits only 
(22 020 [6%] 393 900) or lager, beer, or cider only (10 486 
[3%] of 393 900; appendix p 9). The risk of cirrhosis for 
women drinking more than one type of alcohol compared 
with women drinking wine only was similar (RR 1·17, 
1·03–1·32; p=0·013). The personal characteristics and 
drinking habits of the spirit-only and lager, beer, or 
cider-only drinkers differed substantially from those of 
the wine-only drinkers, in that only one in every seven 
drank with meals compared with two in every three wine-
drinkers and they were about three to four times more 
likely to be smokers and live in deprived areas. This limits 
reliable assessment of cirrhosis risk in the small sub-
groups who reported consuming just spirits or just lager, 
beer, or cider, since considerable residual confounding by 
measured or unmeasured factors, or both, is likely.
Discussion
In this large prospective study of UK women aged in 
their 50s and 60s at baseline, we found that the incidence 
of cirrhosis increased with the amount of alcohol 
consumed, even at moderate levels of consumption 
typical for women of this age.23 However, for a given 
amount of alcohol consumed, the excess risk of cirrhosis 
was lower, by about a third, if alcohol was usually 
consumed with meals than without meals (RR 0·69). In 
addition, among those consuming seven or more drinks 
per week, after adjusting for the amount drunk, whether 
or not it was with meals and type of alcohol consumed, 
the excess risk of cirrhosis was about two-thirds 
higher with daily than with less frequent consumption 
(RR 1·61). For a given amount of alcohol consumed, 
daily consumption together with not usually drinking 
with meals was associated with more than a doubling of 
cirrhosis incidence.

The large size of our study and its prospective design, 
along with the in-depth examination of associations with 
different patterns of alcohol consumption, offer insights 
into the effect of drinking habits that previous studies 
have been unable to provide. Mealtime drinking habits 
and the frequency of consumption are correlated with 
the total amount of alcohol consumed. With the large 
numbers of cases in this study, it was possible to show 
clearly that the lower excess risks associated with 
consumption with meals and non-daily alcohol intake 
were evident at every level of total consumption.
To ensure that similar women were compared, our 
analyses were routinely stratified by exact year of birth 
and calendar year when alcohol intake was reported, and 
were also adjusted for six potential confounding factors 
(ie, region of residence, deprivation, smoking, BMI, 
past oral contraceptive use, and use of menopausal 
hormones). Although different methods were used to 
assess total alcohol intake at baseline and 11 years later, 
the mean intakes in the baseline categories were similar 
to the means 11 years later, with slight regression to the 
mean. Assigning the reassessed mean value to each 
baseline category allowed for changes in drinking habits 
over time, measurement error, and regression dilution 
biases.17 For each pattern of alcohol consumption 
examined, results were also adjusted for other drinking 
habits. Confounding by the other drinking habits was 
generally found to be greater than confounding by the 
six other adjustment factors.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to 
report on the association between mealtime alcohol 
consumption and incident liver cirrhosis. Our results, 
based on 1560 incident cases among drinkers, appear to 
concur with findings from a small cross-sectional study8 
of just 35 cases of cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer, 
which reported an increased risk for the two conditions 
combined in those not drinking with meals.
Regarding frequency of alcohol consumption, only 
two other prospective studies, one including 622 cases of 
cirrhosis,7 and the other including 285 cirrhosis deaths in 
alcohol misusers,9 provided estimates of risk and both 
suggested a possible increased risk of cirrhosis associated 
with daily consumption of alcohol in men. However, risk 
estimates were not adjusted for drinking with meals, 
which was an important confounding factor in our 
analysis.
More than half the women reported drinking more 
than one type of alcohol and a third reported drinking 
wine only and there was little difference in their risk of 
cirrhosis. The small proportions who reported drinking 
spirits only, or lager, beer, or cider only, differed sub-
stantially from the wine-only drinkers and drinkers of a 
mixture of alcoholic beverages both in terms of their 
personal characteristics and their drinking habits, which 
limits comparison of cirrhosis risk, because residual con-
founding by measured or unmeasured factors, or both, is 
possible. Findings from other studies on associations 
with the type of alcohol consumed are varied and 
inconsistent.7–12
The mechanisms that underlie the associations observed 
here are unclear. With respect to the effect of meals, it has 
been suggested that delayed gastric emptying occurs in 
the presence of food, and that alcohol is absorbed more 
slowly in the intestine, leading to lower blood alcohol 
concentrations.24 For non-daily con 
sumption, one possible 
explanation is that the break from alcohol consumption 
allows the liver time to recover after each episode of 
drinking.
Regarding limitations, although we were able to adjust 
each aspect of alcohol consumption by weekly alcohol 
consumption and other drinking habits, as well as by 
other potential confounding factors, some residual 
confounding cannot be excluded. We did not study men 
and did not have information about drinking habits at 
younger ages.25 Other limitations are that this cohort did 
not include large numbers of heavy drinkers, so we could 
not assess the effect of different patterns of irregular 
heavy drinking.
Strengths of this cohort, such as its large size and 
completeness of follow-up, have been detailed previously.6 
The prospective design of the study should largely 
eliminate differential recall of alcohol intake between 
those who developed and did not develop cirrhosis during 
follow-up. Applying levels of alcohol consumption re-
assessed 11 years after baseline helped to minimise effects 
of changes in alcohol consumption over time, measure-
ment error and regression dilution bias (figure 1).17 
Analyses were restricted to drinkers who reported con-
suming at least one alcoholic drink per week at baseline. 
Only one in every seven non-drinkers at baseline were 
lifelong non-drinkers, and the rest were ex-drinkers who 
could have stopped drinking because of poor health, but 
for whom we do not have information on when or why 
they stopped; hence, excluding non-drinkers at baseline 
from the analyses would minimise reverse causation 
biases. 
In conclusion, liver cirrhosis risk increases with 
amount of alcohol drunk, but for a given weekly alcohol 
intake, this excess incidence of cirrhosis is lower if the 
alcohol is consumed with meals and not every day.
