Introduction Beyond their impact on health, vaccines 
can lead to large economic benefits. While most economic 
evaluations of vaccines have focused on the health impact 
of vaccines at a national scale, it is critical to understand 
how their impact is distributed along population subgroups.
Methods We build a financial risk protection model to 
evaluate the impact of immunisation against measles, 
severe pneumococcal disease and severe rotavirus 
for birth cohorts vaccinated over 2016–2030 for three 
scenarios in 41 Gavi-eligible countries: no immunisation, 
current immunisation coverage forecasts and the current 
immunisation coverage enhanced with funding support. 
We distribute modelled disease cases per socioeconomic 
group and derive the number of cases of: (1) catastrophic 
health costs (CHCs) and (2) medical impoverishment.
results In the absence of any vaccine coverage, the 
number of CHC cases attributable to measles, severe 
pneumococcal disease and severe rotavirus would be 
approximately 18.9 million, 6.6 million and 2.2 million, 
respectively. Expanding vaccine coverage would reduce 
this number by up to 90%, 30% and 40% in each case. 
More importantly, we find a higher share of CHC incidence 
among the poorest quintiles who consequently benefit 
more from vaccine expansion.
Conclusion Our findings contribute to the understanding 
of how vaccines can have a broad economic impact. In 
particular, we find that immunisation programmes can 
reduce the proportion of households facing catastrophic 
payments from out-of-pocket health expenses, mainly in 
lower socioeconomic groups. Thus, vaccines could have an 
important role in poverty reduction.
IntroduCtIon
In September 2015, leaders across the world 
adopted the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) that will guide international 
development policy through 2030.1 These 
goals build on the Millennium Development 
Goals and maintain eliminating poverty as 
one of the overarching goals in the decades to 
come, for example, SDG1 of ‘ending poverty 
in all its forms everywhere’.1 According to 
current estimates, approximately 800 million 
people still live in extreme poverty, and one 
in five individuals in developing regions 
is considered extreme poor, that is, living 
on less than $1.90 (2011 Purchasing Power 
Parity, PPP) a day.2 Furthermore, it was 
Key messages
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Vaccines have a large beneficial impact beyond 
health and provide important returns on 
investments.
 
► Scale up of vaccines could have a large role in 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and 
reducing poverty.
What are the new findings?
 
► We develop a methodology that evaluates the 
financial risk protection (FRP) benefits of vaccines 
across income quintiles, thus adding equity and 
distributional components to previous evaluations.
 
► The FRP benefits of vaccines are mostly accrued 
by households in the lowest income quintiles, thus 
emphasising the role of vaccines as a pro-poor 
intervention.
recommendations for policy
 
► Including equity components into economic 
evaluations will allow policy makers to opt for 
interventions that target specifically the most 
vulnerable populations.
 
► Comparisons across interventions can now be done 
by integrating fairness arguments by which groups 
they impact more.
 
► Vaccines represent a valuable pro-poor intervention 
that not only improves health but also protects poor 
households from catastrophic and impoverishing 
health expenditures.

estimated that over 150 million people annually suffer 
from catastrophic costs when paying for their family’s 
healthcare between 1990 and 2003.3 These estimates and 
current population growth in these regions emphasise 
the magnitude of the challenge of eradicating poverty by 
2030 represents. Furthermore, this highlights the need 
for evidence-based policy making that identifies areas 
where larger benefits can be attained.
One area that has gained impetus as a cause of poverty 
and financial hardship is healthcare expenditure. A 
number of studies have identified that out-of-pocket 
(OOP) healthcare payments are important predictors 
of financial hardship and poverty.3–6 The importance 
of healthcare payments as a cause of financial hardship 
was acknowledged by world leaders when establishing 
financial risk protection (FRP) as one of the targets 
within the goal of universal health coverage (UHC) 
including measures against catastrophic health expendi-
tures and medical impoverishment due to health.7–9 In 
particular, this is true for lower-income households that 
are often at greater risk from experiencing catastrophic 
health expenditures—health expenditures surpassing a 
certain threshold of total consumption expenditures or 
income.10 This not only highlights the role of healthcare 
payments in increasing catastrophic health costs (CHCs) 
but also generates an explicit link between the goals of 
eradicating poverty and UHC. Consequently, there is a 
need to identify both health and non-health interven-
tions that can ultimately contribute to reducing health-
care expenditure (increasing FRP) and the incidence of 
poverty.
One set of health interventions with particularly great 
potential is vaccination due to its preventive nature and 
usually lower cost compared with treatment. In May 
2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global 
Vaccine Action Plan highlighted vaccinations as essen-
tial tools for improving individual-level health globally.11 
The widespread attention that vaccines have received 
during the last decade, such as the public endorsement 
from WHO member states of the Global Vaccine Action 
Plan, highlights the role that vaccines can play in the 
broader development agenda. However, despite over-
whelming evidence on their efficacy and health impact, 
the rather limited evidence on their broader distribu-
tional economic benefits may constrain their expansion 
in low-income and middle-income countries that see 
some vaccines as relatively expensive, especially when 
many governments are resource-constrained.
Studies that have evaluated the economic benefits of 
vaccines have found overall large effects.12 In particular, 
a recent analysis found that immunisation programmes 
could yield substantial financial returns that range from 
10 to 25 times that which was invested.13 One limitation 
was, however, the focus on aggregate economic benefits 
and little discussion on the distributional impact (eg, 
per socioeconomic group) of vaccines. Current evidence 
from the literature has shown that morbidity and mortality 
of vaccine-preventable diseases are disproportionally 
reduced among the poor when vaccination programmes 
are implemented.14–16 This is mirrored at the interna-
tional level where vaccine-preventable diseases have 
a higher impact on low-income and middle-income 
countries.17 The combination of both the within and 
between country evidence hints that vaccines could have 
important distributional economic benefits, and that 
therefore, expanding vaccine coverage could contribute 
to poverty reduction.12 18
As the international community seeks to achieve the 
SDGs, vaccines may be able to contribute substantially 
to the post-2015 poverty reduction agenda. This paper 
develops a cost-epidemiological simulation model to esti-
mate the distributional FRP benefits of three vaccines 
(measles, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate), in 
low-income and middle-income countries.
MetHods
In this paper, we develop methods to estimate the effect 
of three vaccines–measles, rotavirus and pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine–on FRP in low-income and middle-in-
come countries. We then illustrate these methods and 
apply them to the estimation of the number of cases 
of (1) medical impoverishment and (2) CHCs in 41 
countries eligible for funding from Gavi, the Vaccine 
Alliance (online supplementary appendix table A1) for 
birth cohorts born over the time period 2016–2030. We 
restricted our analysis to a subset of the total Gavi-eligible 
countries for which Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) data were available after 2010 to develop a distri-
butional analysis by socioeconomic group (ie, income 
quintile). With regard to medical impoverishment, a 
poverty event is counted when household income minus 
healthcare costs falls below the World Bank poverty 
line of $1.90 per day—assuming household income 
was previously above the poverty line.19 Alternatively, a 
case of CHC is counted when OOP healthcare costs are 
larger than 20% of household income. These measures 
of household economic well-being are routinely used by 
WHO and World Bank to evaluate the financial impact of 
health policies on households.2 3 20
We estimate these two metrics at the monthly level 
for three immunisation coverage scenarios: (1) no 
immunisation, (2) the current forecasted immunisation 
programmes, that is, the current trends of immunisa-
tion coverage without any additional funding (‘current 
trends’) and (3) the current trends of immunisation 
coverage enhanced with Gavi funding support for the 
expansion or implementation of new vaccines (‘best 
case’). These scenarios rely on the model predictions 
developed by a series of experts, including Gavi, on the 
long-term volume of vaccines likely to be required among 
Gavi-eligible countries in the future.21 Online supplemen-
tary appendix figure A1 presents the average coverage 
rate of each vaccine for scenarios 2 and 3 in cohorts 
born between 2000 and 2030. For each scenario, we use 
a simulation model to obtain aggregate estimates of cases

of poverty and CHC over 2016–2030 across income quin-
tiles in each country. Per quintile, FRP is calculated as 
the difference in terms of cases of either poverty or CHC 
between either scenario (2) or (3) and the base case (1).
Modelling approach
The FRP model can be described in four steps. First, we 
obtain the number of incident cases for each disease from 
disease-specific models (measles, rotavirus and pneumo-
coccal disease) by country. For rotavirus, the cases consid-
ered only include severe rotavirus defined by moderate or 
severe dehydration attributable to rotavirus.22 For pneu-
mococcal disease, cases considered included severe pneu-
mococcal pneumonia, meningitis and non-pneumonia/
non-meningitis excluding non-severe pneumonia, otitis 
media and meningitis sequelae.23 Severe pneumococcal 
pneumonia was defined according to WHO definition 
of coughing and difficulty breathing.24 Further detail on 
the disease models that provide the disease case inputs 
for this study is described elsewhere.23 25 26 These incident 
cases are then distributed across income quintiles in each 
country population. For this, we use a distributional risk 
approach that varies by specific disease (measles, severe 
rotavirus or severe pneumococcal disease) developed by 
Chang et al.27 This approach uses the prevalence and rela-
tive risk of a set of risk factors as well as the vaccination 
coverage gradient to distribute the number of disease 
cases across income quintiles. Finally, using DHS data, 
we derive ‘healthcare utilisation’ likelihoods, that is, the 
differential probability in healthcare utilisation across 
income quintiles, to estimate the disease cases treated 
in each income quintile. Due to the paucity of data on 
disease incidence within a household, we assumed only 
one disease case per household.
In step 2, we estimate the total health-related costs 
incurred by households that can be attributed to each 
treated disease case. We include OOP direct medical 
costs: treatment costs for the disease, transportation costs 
as well as indirect costs for caretaking due to time losses. 
For this purpose, we use estimates of country treatment 
provider costs,2 28–42 the average hospitalisation length 
per disease, the proportion of cases that are hospitalised 
and transportation costs from/to the health facility.42 
Additionally, we consider indirect costs defined as the 
product of hospitalisation or outpatient duration with 
the hourly wage data for each country.34 43 The direct 
medical costs represent the total cost for the health 
system; therefore, we use the share of OOP expenditures 
to total health expenditures2 as a proxy for the fraction 
of the costs that would be borne by individuals. With this 
data, we estimate total expected (correcting for utilisa-
tion) healthcare expenditures for each disease. All costs 
figures are expressed in $ 2011 PPP in order to follow the 
World Bank standard of poverty measurement.2
In the third step, we define the CHC and poverty 
cases. For that, we count a CHC case when total health 
costs exceed 20% of the monthly household income per 
capita44 and a case of poverty when monthly household 
income per capita minus health costs becomes lower 
than the $1.90 2011 PPP per day poverty line. Monthly 
household income is drawn from a simulated gamma 
distribution whose shape and scale parameters are based 
on the country’s gross domestic product per capita and 
Gini coefficient.45 46
Finally, we aggregate the number of cases (either CHC 
or poverty), annually and cumulatively over 2016–2030, 
for all 41 countries. Thus, per scenario and per disease, 
we obtain numbers of cases of CHC and poverty accu-
mulated in this period across income quintiles. All anal-
yses of FRP (CHC and poverty) were pursued using the R 
Studio V.1.0.143 (www. 
r- 
project. 
org).
Input data
Table 1 lists all the inputs used in the simulation model, 
including the average number of annual disease cases in 
all countries under the three different coverage scenarios 
over 2016–2030 (no vaccination, current trends and best 
case), the average patient cost across all countries that 
an individual would face with each disease and disease 
incidence and utilisation gradients.
sensitivity analysis
First, we conduct two univariate sensitivity analyses. For 
CHC, we vary the threshold from 10% to 40% of house-
hold income per capita, instead of 20% (base case). The 
second univariate analysis evaluates the role of health-
care utilisation and obtains estimates of CHC and poverty 
cases assuming that all individuals in the country have 
equivalent utilisation to those of the highest income 
group. Finally, we conduct a probabilistic sensitivity anal-
ysis using Monte Carlo simulations (n=1000 trials), where 
case distribution, utilisation and costs were varied simul-
taneously using truncated normal distributions with the 
inputs’ means and 20% of the means as SD. This allows 
us to extract the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles to determine 
95% uncertainty ranges (URs) that are incorporated into 
our results.
results
Figure 1 presents the number of CHC and medical impov-
erishment cases attributable to measles for those born 
from 2016 to 2030 in 41 Gavi-eligible countries by house-
hold income quintile. We estimate that approximately 
18.9 million households (95% UR 16.4–21.4) would have 
CHC attributable to measles in the absence of any vacci-
nation coverage. This represents approximately 35% of 
the birth cohort born in these countries in 2016 assuming 
one susceptible child per household. The number of 
CHC decreases to 3.4 million households (2.9–3.4) that 
is approximately 5% of the 2016 birth cohort in these 
countries if the current coverage forecasts remain and to 
2.6 million (2.2–3.0) if coverage was enhanced with Gavi 
support. For medical impoverishment, the number of 
households that would fall under the poverty line due to 
medical expenditures attributable to measles would be 
5.3 million (4.8–5.3) in the absence of any vaccination

coverage, 0.7 million (0.6–0.8) under the current trends 
of immunisation coverage and 0.5 million (0.4–0.6) if 
Gavi support was provided. Overall, the results show that 
vaccine coverage can reduce by approximately 90% the 
incidence of CHC attributable to measles.
Figures 2 presents similar estimates attributable to 
severe pneumococcal disease. We find that approximately 
6.6 (6.3–6.9) million households would suffer from 
CHC between 2016 and 2030 in the absence of vaccine 
coverage. In contrast to measles, under the current 
prevailing conditions of vaccine coverage, the number 
of CHC cases would only decrease slightly to 6.4 million 
(6.1–6.7) and is explained by the common absence of the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in current country vacci-
nation programmes. This represents approximately 13% 
of the 2016 birth cohorts of these countries. This vaccine 
will be implemented or expanded with Gavi support in 
some countries, and under this scenario, the number of 
households with CHC cases would decrease to 4.6 million 
(4.4–4.8) representing a decrease of approximately 30%. 
A similar conclusion is drawn from the medical impov-
erishment estimates where without vaccine coverage, 
0.8 million (0.7–0.9) households would fall under the 
poverty line. This value is similar under the current fore-
casts, but with Gavi support, the number of households 
that fall under the poverty line due to healthcare expen-
ditures would decrease to 0.6 million (0.5–0.6).
Figure 3 presents the estimated number of CHC and 
medical impoverishment cases attributable to severe rota-
virus by household income quintile. The numbers are 
considerably lower than in the cases of measles and severe 
pneumococcal disease. Without any vaccine coverage, 
we estimate 2.2 million CHC cases (2.1–2.4) and 0.6 
(0.6–0.7) million medical impoverishment cases. These 
numbers would not significantly decrease under the 
current forecasts: to 2.1 million (2.0–2.4) and 0.6 million 
(0.6–0.7), respectively. This is because very few countries 
have introduced the rotavirus vaccine. Nevertheless, the 
implementation and expansion of the rotavirus vaccine

In the case of measles and severe rotavirus, the figures 
above also show that the share of CHC and medical 
impoverishment cases is larger in households from the 
lower-income quintiles. From the estimates above, we 
calculate the number of CHC cases averted under the 
current prevailing conditions with and without Gavi 
support (table 2) and estimate the share of averted 
cases in each quintile. Table 2 shows that of the approxi-
mately 12.5 million cases of CHC attributable to measles 
that will be averted under current coverage trends, 75% 
(95% UR 70–81) of them will occur in the households 
from the lowest income quintile. The value for severe 
rotavirus is lower, 40% (30–51), but is nevertheless the 
largest across income quintiles. This gradient is even 
smaller for severe pneumococcal disease. However, 
enhancing the coverage of vaccines to the best-case 
scenario would not only lead to a larger number of CHC 
cases averted but also increase the share of protected 
households in the lowest quintile. For example, with 
increased Gavi funding, 57% (53–61) of all the averted 
CHC cases attributable to severe rotavirus would occur 
in the lowest income quintile. These results highlight 
that not only can vaccines decrease considerably the 
number of CHC cases but they also have the potential 
of disproportionately improving the financial condi-
tions of the poor. The estimates for medical impov-
erishment lead to similar conclusions with the share 
of averted cases decreasing with income quintile and 
emphasising the pro-poor financial benefits of vaccines 
(online supplementary appendix tables A2 and 3).
Figures 4–6 also show the total OOP expenditures 
attributable to measles, severe pneumococcal disease 
and severe rotavirus by income quintile for birth cohorts 
from 2016 to 2030. In contrast to the results for FRP, 
expenditures are larger in the highest income quintiles 
in line with their higher healthcare utilisation. These 
estimates, however, show that expanding the coverage of 
vaccines leads to an important reduction in total OOP 
expenditures. Under the current vaccine coverage fore-
casts, the amount of OOP expenditures averted would be 
4.3 billion (4.1–4.7) 2011 International $ PPP for measles, 
$36 million (30–43) for severe pneumococcal disease and 
$70 million (58–82) for severe rotavirus (online supple-
mentary appendix table A4). The averted expenditures 
further increase to $4.6 billion (4.2–5.0) for measles, 
$168 million (156–181) for severe pneumococcal disease 
and $200 million for severe rotavirus (184–215) when 
including Gavi support (online supplementary appendix 
table A4). In line with the figures, the larger share of the 
total OOP health expenditures averted would occur in 
the higher-income quintiles as shown in online supple-
mentary appendix table A5.

supplementary appendix figures A2,3 and 4), we find 
that, as expected, increasing the threshold leads to a 
lower number of cases. However, the results still show 
large number of CHC cases and most importantly in the 
bottom income quintiles. One important aspect to note 
is that if we used a threshold of 10%, the total number 
of CHC cases in the absence of immunisation would be 
49 million, 7 million and 5 million for measles, severe 
pneumococcal disease and severe rotavirus, respec-
tively. This would represent approximately 100%, 15% 
and 10% of the 2016 birth cohort of these 41 countries. 
Under the best-case scenario, the number of cases using 
the 10% threshold would decrease to 6 million, 3 million 
and 3 million, respectively, emphasising the importance 
of vaccines even when considering different thresholds. 
Online supplementary appendix figures A5 to 7 present 
the results assuming that all income quintiles achieve the 
highest utilisation observed in the country. As expected, 
the number of CHC and poverty cases increases since 
individuals are more likely to use healthcare if ill while 
facing similar OOP costs. The effects are substantial and 
show an increase under the 20% threshold to approxi-
mately 23 million cases for measles, 8 million cases for 
severe pneumococcal disease and 3 million for severe 
rotavirus. As before, under the best-case scenario, the 
numbers decrease to 3 million, 6 million and 2 million, 
respectively. The similarity of the conclusions emphasises 
the importance of vaccines and their role in protecting 
households financially from OOP health expenditures. 
Finally, online supplementary appendix figures A8 to 10 
show that TFR adjustments across quintiles do not lead to 
important differences in the results.
dIsCussIon
This paper develops a methodology to estimate how 
cases of CHC and medical impoverishment incurred 
by vaccine-preventable diseases would be distributed 
across socioeconomic status and to quantify the likely 
FRP benefits of immunisation programmes. We find that

that is, including Gavi funding for the expansion and 
implementation of new vaccines, the incidence of CHC 
could decrease to 3 million, 5 million and 1 million, 
respectively. Similar estimates are obtained when consid-
ering other indicators of FRP such as cases of medical 
impoverishment. These results emphasise the funda-
mental role that vaccines can have in the global agenda 
to protect households’ financial well-being as well as 
reduce the incidence of medical impoverishment.
Furthermore, not only the burden of CHC and medical 
impoverishment would be greater in the lowest income 
quintiles but also the expanding vaccine coverage could 
provide larger FRP to the poorest quintiles. An important 
protective gradient could incur where the share of 
averted cases in relation to the total number of cases 
averted would be larger in the lowest income quintiles. 
Consequently, vaccines not only could enhance financial 
protection from OOP health expenditures but also could 
benefit more those that are worst off.
Finally, we estimate that under the best-case scenario, 
current coverage trends with enhanced Gavi funding, 
the amount of OOP health expenditures averted would 
surpass $4.5 billion (2011 International $) attributable 
to measles, $168 million attributable to severe pneumo-
coccal disease and $200 million attributable to severe 
rotavirus. Therefore, expanding vaccine coverage would 
improve household financial well-being by increasing 
disposable income that could further improve their living 
conditions.
Overall, this paper provides additional information for 
decision makers to consider when setting national prior-
ities and can help place poverty reduction as a major 
outcome of health interventions with the objective of 
achieving the SDGs by 2030. In particular, this method-
ology helps incorporating poverty reduction and FRP 
as a criterion to design a basic health benefits package 
including publicly financed immunisations, where 
both FRP and cost-effectiveness are taken into account, 
consistent with extended cost-effectiveness analysis 
methods47–49 and frameworks of multicriteria decision 
analysis.50 Our approach also quantifies cost-effective 
health-policy investments in terms of poverty reduction 
that can be included in discussions outside of the health 
sector such as agriculture or education and for ministries 
of finance and development.51
Our analysis presents, nevertheless, several limitations. 
First, data on OOP expenditures and impoverishment 
are lacking substantially, and therefore, we had to rely 
on information available for a small set of countries and 
imputed data.52–55 Additionally, there is paucity of infor-
mation on treatment costs and OOP costs that emphasise 
the need of further studies in this area. Our CHC and 
poverty cases estimates rely on disease case outputs from 
disease and forecast models that have their own limita-
tions.21 25 26 42 Furthermore, one may need to repeat these 
analyses as forecasts evolve to estimate the future finan-
cial protection benefits of vaccines. As a consequence, 
our results are related to the assumptions in these models

such as the type of vaccines considered. Nevertheless, we 
pursued sensitivity analyses, and our results were robust 
to different sets of parameter assumptions that could 
have more importance on medical impoverishment and 
CHCs. Second, there are modelling assumptions from our 
financial protection simulation model itself with regard 
to the distributions of income and costs in the different 
populations. Some of our results, therefore, need to be 
interpreted with caution and also call for better data 
collection in the domain of OOP healthcare costs, access 
to healthcare and on risk factors to understand the distri-
bution of cases across income quintiles. Furthermore, we 
presented a relatively simple FRP model, but one could 
develop more complexity that includes discounting and 
income growth over time (currently not incorporated 
in our model), as well as other social benefits or costs, 
for example. Another limitation is that we have chosen 
specific measures of FRP that rely on income-based 
thresholds to quantify the number of cases of CHC and 
poverty.44 This simplification also implies that the coun-
terfactual excludes the possibility that these households 
would fall below the poverty line for other reasons during 
the same month. A final limitation of this analysis is the 
paucity of data concerning incidence of disease within a 
household.
Overall, our paper suggests that immunisation not only 
would have an important effect on economic well-being 
of a country but also would prevent disease-related hospi-
talisation, associated impoverishment and could provide 
significant financial protection to households, particu-
larly the poorest who are at higher risks, have reduced 
access to healthcare and bear significant economic costs 
due to disease treatment. As the world aims to eliminate 
poverty by 2030, immunisation could play a key role in 
setting policy for the poverty reduction agenda.
