IMPORTANCE Physicians often must decide whether to treat patients with acute stroke locally
or refer them to a more distant Primary Stroke Center (PSC). There is little evidence on how
much the increased risk of prolonged travel time offsets benefits of a specialized PSC care.
OBJECTIVES To examine the association of case fatality with receiving care in PSCs vs other
hospitals for patients with stroke and to identify whether prolonged travel time offsets the
effect of PSCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries
with stroke admitted to a hospital between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. Drive
times were calculated based on zip code centroids and street-level road network data. We
used an instrumental variable analysis based on the differential travel time to PSCs to control
for unmeasured confounding. The setting was a 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service
claims.
EXPOSURES Admission to a PSC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Seven-day and 30-day postadmission case-fatality rates.
RESULTS Among 865 184 elderly patients with stroke (mean age, 78.9 years; 55.5% female),
53.9% were treated in PSCs. We found that admission to PSCs was associated with 1.8%
(95% CI, −2.1% to −1.4%) lower 7-day and 1.8% (95% CI, −2.3% to −1.4%) lower 30-day case
fatality. Fifty-six patients with stroke needed to be treated in PSCs to save one life at 30 days.
Receiving treatment in PSCs was associated with a 30-day survival benefit for patients
traveling less than 90 minutes, but traveling at least 90 minutes offset any benefit of PSC
care.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hospitalization of patients with stroke in PSCs was associated
with decreased 7-day and 30-day case fatality compared with noncertified hospitals.
Traveling at least 90 minutes to receive care offset the 30-day survival benefit of PSC
admission.

S
troke is one of the leading causes of death and long-
term disability in the United States.1,2 In an effort to
maximize positive outcomes, referral centers have been
established to ensure adherence to guidelines and efficient
delivery of disease-specific care.3 The backbone of this effort
isthecertificationofPrimaryStrokeCenters(PSCs)byTheJoint
Commission (TJC). Several groups have demonstrated a small
case-fatality benefit from stroke center hospitalization for
patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.4-6 However,
previous investigations were either based on regional centers
of excellence (not certified by a national agency)6 or did not
adjust for unmeasured confounders.
Positive outcomes for patients with stroke depend on the
timely administration of thrombolytics, evaluation for endo-
vasculartreatment,neurosurgicalconsultationincasesofhem-
orrhage, and targeted neurocritical care. The implementa-
tion of regionalization incentives (directing all patients with
stroke to PSCs), similar to other areas of medicine,7-10 can have
a significant effect on travel times and outcomes, which is of
particular importance when considering the well-recognized
access disparities for PSCs across states.11-14 Therefore, the po-
tential benefit of an admission to a PSC needs to be weighed
againsttheeffectoflongertraveltimes.Toourknowledge,pre-
vious literature15 has not addressed this question, leaving a
critical knowledge gap for the emergency systems involved in
the care of patients with stroke.
WeusedanationalcohortofMedicarebeneficiariestoiden-
tify how much the increased risk of longer travel time offsets
potential benefits of specialized PSC care. We used real-
world US road network information for travel time calcula-
tions and evaluated the association of 7-day and 30-day case-
fatality rates with receiving care in a PSC using an instrumental
variable analysis based on the differential travel time to a PSC
vs a non-PSC institution.
Methods
Cohort Creation
This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Dart-
mouth College Committee for Protection of Human Sub-
jects. Informed consent was waived because we used
deidentified data. We used data from a 100% sample of
Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service programs
or non–risk-bearing health maintenance organizations from
January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013, to identify stroke
cases, classified as International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) primary
inpatient codes 430.xx, 431.xx, 433.xx, or 434.xx, in inpa-
tient Medicare claims. Exclusion criteria are shown in the
eFigure in the Supplement.
Data Sources
A PSC certification is awarded by TJC based on guidelines
from the Brain Attack Coalition and the American Heart
Association/American Stroke Association. The list of TJC-
certified PSCs is publicly available and was accessed via the
web for the year 2010 (http://www.jointcommission.org).
Admission to a PSC was determined by the certification status
of the first hospital to which the patient was admitted and not
by subsequent transfers.
Although we had no information on the patient’
s loca-
tionatthetimeofthestroke,theFraminghamStudy16hasdem-
onstrated that most strokes happen at home. Population-
weighted zip code centroids (points) were used to represent
patient origins (2010 data; Maponics).
Latitude and longitude coordinates of hospitals using the
2010AmericanHeartAssociationhospitalfilewereusedaspos-
sible destinations. Primary Stroke Center locations were
matched to American Heart Association hospital locations. All
zip code centroids were referenced to the WGS84 datum.
Outcome and Covariates
Our primary outcomes were 7-day and 30-day postadmission
case fatality. The date of death was determined based on the
Medicare denominator file. Age categories (65-69, 70-74, 75-
79, 80-84, and 85-99 years), race/ethnicity categories (white,
black,Asian,andotherbasedonself-reporting),andstroketype
(ischemic, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hem-
orrhage) were recorded. We created quintiles of zip code in-
come based on a 5-year panel (2007-2011) of the American
Community Survey. Poverty rate (based on American Com-
munity Survey data) was also included to reflect the differing
distribution of income within the zip code.
Comorbidities for which outcomes were adjusted
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) included myocardial infarc-
tion, cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, hyperlip-
idemia, coagulopathy, hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, tobacco use, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and chronic renal failure. Comorbidities were determined
based on the immediately prior 6-month lookup period.
Hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) during the 6
months before admission were created based on the SAS
software code provided by the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services. While the purpose of HCCs was to create a
risk-adjustment approach for expenditures, they are also a
highly predictive measure of case fatality.17 The HCCs were
divided into quintiles for the analysis. We used ICD-9-CM
codes to identify the use of thrombolytics (code 99.10) and
mechanical thrombectomy (code 39.74).
Key Points
Question How much does the increased risk of prolonged travel
time offset benefits of specialized Primary Stroke Center (PSC)
care?
Findings In a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries
with stroke admitted to a hospital between 2010 and 2013, we
found that admission to PSCs was associated with lower 7-day and
30-day case fatality. Receiving treatment in PSCs was associated
with a 30-day survival benefit for patients traveling less than 90
minutes, but traveling at least 90 minutes offset any benefit of
PSC care.
Meaning Traveling at least 90 minutes to receive care offset the
30-day survival benefit of PSC admission.

Assessment of Ground Travel Times
Street-level network data (StreetMap North America, version
10.2;Esri)wereusedtocalculatetheoptimaltraveltimeroutes.
Travel time paths and their distances between origin and des-
tinationpointswerecalculatedtofindtheoptimalroutesusing
a software program (ArcGIS with the Network Analyst ex-
tension; Esri). Total travel time calculations were adjusted for
population density12 (eMethods in the Supplement).
To comply with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices reporting requirements, a minimum of 11 patients
with stroke per zip code was required for maps showing
geographic location of patients with stroke. The patterns are
similar to those with no minimum cell size.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis examined the association of receiving
treatmentinaPSCwiththe7-dayand30-daycase-fatalityrates,
with all analysis done at the individual patient level. Classic
observational techniques are limited by nonrandom selec-
tion of patients to hospitals. For example, if patients with more
unobserved confounding factors are more likely to be trans-
ferred to PSCs, the estimated benefit of PSCs will be biased
downward. We attempted to address this unmeasured con-
founding using an instrumental variable analysis, which has
been used in multiple prior studies18-20 of comparative effec-
tiveness research.
Given the likelihood that patients with stroke will be taken
to the nearest hospital, we use the differential travel time of
the patient to the closest PSC vs the closest non-PSC institu-
tion as a “natural randomization” to assign patients to a PSC
(treatment) or non-PSC (control) institution. It is calculated by
subtracting the travel time of the patient’
s location to the clos-
estPSCfromthetraveltimeofthepatient’
slocationtotheclos-
est non-PSC institution. Differential travel time is the most
widely accepted instrument used in the literature and is a
strong predictor of hospital admission.18,21,22 The standard
rule23 for a strong instrument is that the F statistic for the as-
sociation of the instrument with exposure exceeds 10. In our
case, it exceeded 1600 for all analyses.
The second key assumption is that our instrument is not
associated with unmeasured health status (exclusion restric-
tion criterion). We consider the plausibility of this assump-
tion by testing whether those living closer to PSCs have simi-
lar underlying measured illness compared with those living
farther from PSCs. For this purpose, we used our full set of risk
adjusters to estimate predicted mortality based on factors like
age, HCC scores, stroke type, and others. We then compared
our mortality risk “index” between the half of the sample liv-
ing closest to PSCs and the half living farthest away, clustered
at the regional (hospital referral region) level.
Before controlling for unmeasured confounders, we in-
vestigated the association of PSC admission with mortality
using a probit regression controlling for all known confound-
ers in our data. Subsequently, our instrumental variable analy-
sis model was based on a 2-stage approach with a probit func-
tion in the second stage to account for the binary dependent
variable. Probit is similar to a logistic regression but allows an
estimate of the differential probability of the outcome (rather
than an odds ratio) by calculating the marginal effects (partial
derivative) after adjusting for all independent variables.24 For
sensitivity analysis, we also considered an instrumental vari-
ablePoissonmodeltoestimatetheriskratios.Inalltheseanaly-
ses, we controlled for the sociodemographic and comorbid-
ity variables mentioned previously, including stroke type.
To investigate whether the effect of longer travel time
offset the benefit of treatment in a PSC, we stratified the analy-
sis above with respect to the following 5 prespecified catego-
ries of patient travel time: less than 20 minutes, 20 to 39 min-
utes, 40 to 59 minutes, 60 to 89 minutes, and at least 90
minutes. Additional sensitivity analysis stratified our base-
line models for separate regions of the United States (Mid-
west, Northeast, West, and South), for older (>75 years) or
younger (65-74 years) patients, and for urban or nonurban resi-
dence. In post hoc sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analy-
ses for the subgroups of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hem-
orrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, although our study
was not individually powered for these subcategories. We also
considered an analysis that excluded hospital transfers. We did
not adjust for multiple comparisons.
The mean imputation for patients with missing urbanic-
ity and income data (6.5% of the sample) did not affect the re-
sults,sothesepatientswereexcluded.Numbersneededtotreat
were calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction
as appropriate. All probability values were the result of 2-sided
tests, and the significance level was set at .05. Software
programs (SAS, version 10; SAS Institute Inc and Stata, ver-
sion 14; StataCorp LP) were used for statistical analysis.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
The eFigure in the Supplement shows the creation of our
cohort. During the study period, 865 184 Medicare fee-
for-service beneficiaries (mean age, 78.9 years; 55.5%
female) were seen with a stroke. There were 976 PSCs across
the United States, with 466 334 (53.9%) patients from our co-
hort being treated in PSCs. Almost one-fourth (24.0%) of the
cohort resided closer to a PSC than to a non-PSC institution.
Thedistributionofpatientcharacteristicsstratifiedbywhether
theyreceivedtreatmentinPSCsissummarizedinTable1.There
was significant regional variation in access to PSCs, as shown
in the Figure.
Differences in interventions and hospitalization charac-
teristics between patients admitted to PSCs and those admit-
ted to non-PSC institutions are summarized in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. Patients admitted to a PSC were more likely to
receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (6.0% vs
2.8%) or undergo mechanical thrombectomy (1.0% vs 0.2%)
for ischemic stroke compared with their counterparts in non-
PSC institutions. Final disposition of patients with stroke is
summarized in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Case Fatality and Treatment in a PSC
In the first 7 days after admission for acute stroke, there were

31 097 (13.3%) deaths among patients hospitalized in non-
PSC institutions. The corresponding 30-day deaths were 75 151
(30.8%) in PSCs and 61 397 (26.3%) in non-PSC institutions.
In multivariable regression analysis controlling for all
healthstatusandsociodemographicfactors,admissiontoaPSC
was associated with 0.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.8%) higher 7-day
case fatality and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.7%) higher 30-day case
fatality. However, this estimate is potentially biased because
it does not control for unmeasured confounding.
To address this limitation of unmeasured confounding, we
used differential travel time as an instrument (Table 2 and
eTable 4 in the Supplement). Differential travel time was a
stronginstrumentforPSCadmission.WhenthePSCwasatleast
1 hour closer than the nearest non-PSC institution, 87.5% of
patients were admitted to a PSC. When the PSC was 1 hour far-
ther from the non-PSC institution, only 38.8% of patients were
admitted to a PSC. We did not find evidence that those who
lived nearest to a PSC were sicker than those living far from a
PSC: predicted mortality in the former was 15.8%, while that
in the latter was 15.7% (P = .57).
Our analysis suggested that PSC admission was associ-
ated with −1.8% (95% CI, −2.1% to −1.4%) lower 7-day case fa-
tality (Table 2). Similarly, PSC admission was associated with
−1.8% (95% CI, −2.3% to −1.4%) lower 30-day case fatality. The
number needed to treat (NNT) in PSCs to save one life at 30
days after admission for acute stroke was 56 patients.
PSC Survival Benefit and Travel Time
Receiving treatment in a PSC was associated with a 30-day sur-
vival benefit for patients traveling less than 20 minutes (ad-
justed difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.5%-3.9% [NNT, 37 pa-
tients]), 20 to 39 minutes (adjusted difference, 1.8%; 95%
CI, 1.3%-2.2% [NNT, 56 patients]), 40 to 59 minutes (adjusted
difference, 2.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-2.8% [NNT, 38 patients]), and
60 to 89 minutes (adjusted difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.2%-
2.4% [NNT, 59 patients]). Traveling at least 90 minutes to re-
ceive care yielded no net benefit of PSC admission (adjusted
difference, 0.1%; 95% CI −3.1% to 3.3%). Similar associations
were observed for 7-day outcomes, with travel time offset-
ting the effect of PSC admission at 60 minutes (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analysis
Weconsideredrelativeriskestimatesfor7-dayand30-daycase
fatality using an instrumental variable Poisson regression with
the same covariates (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The risk ra-
tios for admission to a PSC were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88) for
30-day case fatality and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78) for 7-day case
fatality, implying roughly similar absolute differences in case
fatality as those in the primary analysis. We stratified the in-
strumental variable analysis for case fatality along several di-
mensions (Table 2). We observed regional variation for the 4
regions of the United States. Estimates stratified by age or ur-
ban residence were similar to those at baseline.

Discussion
Among Medicare beneficiaries, treatment in a PSC was asso-
ciated with decreased 7-day and 30-day postadmission case
fatality compared with noncertified institutions. Traveling at
least 90 minutes to receive care offsets the 30-day survival
benefit of PSCs (60 minutes for the 7-day survival benefit).
These results are statistically significant and are clinically sig-
nificant, implying one life saved for every 56 treated in a PSC.
With the current distribution of PSCs, 16.4% of patients are lo-
cated at least 90 minutes by ground transportation from the
nearest PSC.
Prior studies have investigated the association of hospi-
talization in PSCs with stroke outcomes. Lichtman et al,5 in a
national cohort of patients with ischemic stroke, demon-
stratedthathospitalizationinPSCswasassociatedwithslightly
lower 30-day case fatality compared with noncertified hospi-
tals, although the difference was not statistically significant.
In addition, in a separate study,4 Lichtman and colleagues
showed that patients with hemorrhagic stroke receiving care
in PSCs had significantly improved 30-day case fatality com-
pared with their counterparts admitted to non-PSC institu-
tions. The authors4,5 recognized that the major limitation of
their results is the presence of unmeasured confounding be-
cause of selection bias.18,19 Proximity, severity of disease, and
insurance coverage can be some of the factors that might affect
patient disposition.
To address these limitations and account for such con-
founders, we used an instrumental variable analysis using the
differentialtraveltimeasaninstrument.Differentialtraveltime
has been used before in similar observational studies18,19 of
comparativeeffectiveness.Inaregionalcohort,Xianetal6used
an instrumental variable analysis to demonstrate superior out-
comes for patients with ischemic stroke hospitalized in local
centers of excellence. Their analysis focused on locally certi-
fied hospitals (different from the PSCs, which are certified by
TJC) and is specific to New York State.
GiventhepotentialforimprovedstrokeoutcomeswithPSC
admissions, identifying the optimal time frame to receive care
in these institutions is of central importance. To our knowl-
edge, this question has not been addressed before in the lit-
erature. Our time calculations build on the work by Albright
et al12 and others13,14 who investigated the access of all US resi-
dents(regardlessofageandwhethertheyhadastroke)toPSCs.
The advantage of our analysis lies in using a large comprehen-
sivecohortofpatientswithstroke.Inaddition,contrarytoprior
work12-14 using straight-line distance calculations of ground
travel time, we used real-world road network data for the con-
terminous United States contemporary to the study years.
These data simulate closely the ground path through which
the patient could reach a PSC, taking into account the effect
of natural obstacles like mountains or rivers.
Travel times of at least 90 minutes appear to negate 30-
day mortality gains arising from admission to a PSC. As sug-
gested by our finding of higher thrombolytic and mechanical
thrombectomy rates in PSCs, superior outcomes in PSCs likely
reflect organized, disease-specific, efficient care, as well as the
timely administration of the optimal treatments and efficient
blood pressure optimization. Among those living between 60
and 89 minutes from a PSC, the finding that PSC benefits arise
only after 30 days (but not at 7 days) could reflect additional
postacute services available through PSCs.
The access map (Figure) of the United States demon-
strates that a significant proportion of patients with stroke are
outside of this 90-minute window. These access disparities
have stimulated discussions about more thoughtful creation
of stroke centers within the confines of a single state25 or
nationally.12 The establishment or certification of new cen-
ters can be prohibitive from a cost perspective. Building on the
experience of trauma care, the optimal use of air services with
theexistingPSClocationscouldexpandaccesswithinthistime
frame for almost all patients with stroke. This alternative is just
one approach from a plethora of available options to address
disparities in access and follow the recommendations of the
Institute of Medicine26,27 to maximize the use of local refer-
ral centers. Other potential solutions include expanding tele-
medicine applications, enhancing smaller hospitals into Acute
Stroke–Ready Hospitals, and creating broader hospital
networks.28,29 Further investigations are necessary to iden-
tify the best combination of approaches to treat patients with
stroke.
The present study has limitations. First, coding inaccura-
cies can affect our estimates, although several studies30,31
have demonstrated that coding for stroke has good associa-
tion with medical record review. Second, residual confound-
ing can bias our results, for example because of differences
in time from stroke onset and because of stroke severity
unmeasured in the Medicare claims data. We attempted to
minimize such bias in an instrumental variable analysis,

which simulates randomization by balancing the treatment
and control groups in terms of unmeasured confounders. It is
reassuring that our predicted mortality index was so similar
for the group living near a PSC (most likely admitted to a PSC)
and the control group living far from a PSC (least likely to be
admitted to a PSC).
A third limitation is that we cannot necessarily identify
what it is about PSCs that reduces mortality rates. These vari-
ables could include factors like emergency department de-
lays, availability of telestroke, timing of interventions, with-
drawal of care, rehabilitation during hospitalization, and the
use of emergency medical transportation. Fourth, our data are
based on the Medicare population, with potentially different
results for the commercially insured. However, three-
quartersofallstrokeshappeninpatients65yearsorolder,most
of whom are covered by Medicare.1
Fifth, we underestimate the potential risks of longer travel
time in ambulances because patients who die in the ambu-
lance may not appear in the Medicare claims data. In a recent
study32 of urban patients with stroke treated in ambulances,
the incidence of any death in the ambulance was only 0.2%
(12 of 7098 patients), suggesting that the incremental effects
oflongerambulancerideswouldnotreverseourfindings.Sixth,
assigning populations to zip code centroids may give falsely
low travel times for some patients, while overestimating travel
times in others. To adjust for this limitation, we integrated in
our travel time calculations previously validated indicators of
average traffic delays based on the urbanicity of the patient’
s
residence. Seventh, we recognize that our estimate of no ben-
efit for patients traveling at least 90 minutes carries with it a
wide 95% CI. Eighth, the scope of this analysis included only
PSCs certified by TJC and excluded state-certified hospitals or
those participating in national quality improvement pro-
grams. Ninth, we had no information on the neurologic sta-
tus of our patients at the time of discharge; therefore, we could
not analyze the differences between PSCs and noncertified in-
stitutions for these outcomes. Tenth, causality cannot easily
be established based on ecologic data, despite the use of an
instrumental variable analysis.
Conclusions
Among Medicare beneficiaries with stroke, treatment in a PSC
was associated with decreased 7-day and 30-day postadmis-
sion case-fatality rates. Traveling at least 90 minutes to re-
ceive care offset the 30-day survival benefit of PSCs. Further
investigations are necessary to identify the best combination
of approaches to improve access to centers of excellence and
stroke outcomes.

Invited Commentary
Admitting the Patient With Acute Stroke to the Right House—
Lessons From the Sorting Hat of Hogwarts
Lee H. Schwamm, MD
The goal of any prehospital sorting function is to allocate pa-
tients to the most appropriate destination that will maximize
their outcomes as defined by their preferences, goals, needs,
and resources. In much the same way, the Sorting Hat at Hog-
warts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry in J. K. Rowl-
ing’
s world of Harry Potter
seeks to place each student in
the proper “house.” Just as there are competing schools of
wizardry, there are also multiple organizations1 that seek to
certify stroke centers by differing criteria, although The Joint
Commission (JC) Primary Stroke Center (PSC) program is by
far the oldest and largest.
In their article in this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine,
Bekelis and colleagues2 examine the effect of patients with
stroke being “sorted” to admission at a JC PSC vs a non–JC PSC
on the outcome of death by 7 and 30 days. Their main inter-
est was in determining the additional travel distance neces-
sary beyond the hospital nearest to a patient’
s home for ad-
mission to a PSC after which no difference in outcomes would
be evident. Among patients who entered this complex maze
of stroke care from 2010 to 2013, they found higher mortality
after multivariable adjustment for patients assigned to a house
that was JC PSC certified vs one that was not, but this effect
reversed when using instrumental variable analysis to ac-
countforunmeasuredconfounding.After90minutesofadded
travel, no benefit was gained by admission to a JC PSC. Within
the limits of their Medicare (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services [CMS]) fee-for-service claims data source, they did an
elegant job of trying to control for measured and unmea-
sured confounding introduced by the nonrandom allocation
of patients.
Ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke have different
clinical trajectories: hemorrhagic stroke has greater mortal-
ity, less diagnostic uncertainty, greater likelihood of transfer,
and relatively few patients for whom treatment in the “golden
hour” dramatically alters the outcome. Unlike many serious
acute diseases, stroke mortality is largely predicted by one (ie,
stroke severity) rather than many covariates. The CMS risk-
standardized model of hospital rankings on 30-day ischemic
stroke mortality does not adjust for stroke severity. Addition
of this unmeasured confounder has a dramatic effect on re-
classificationofhospitalperformance,3andallmeasuresofper-
formance that relate to functional outcomes or mortality must
include severity. In models of in-hospital mortality using data
in the Get With The Guidelines–Stroke Program,4 almost all of
the fully adjusted model’
s C statistic is due to the National In-
stitutes of Health Stroke (NIHSS) score alone. Fortunately, the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion will soon include a mechanism for collecting NIHSS se-
verity into claims data, and the CMS has proposed modified
versions of its 30-day risk-standardized measures to include
these data.
