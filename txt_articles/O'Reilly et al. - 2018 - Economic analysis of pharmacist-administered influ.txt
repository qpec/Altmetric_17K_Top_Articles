Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pharmacist administration of 
influenza vaccine in Ontario on: 1) vaccination-associated costs related to the number of people 
vaccinated; 2) annual influenza-related outcomes and costs; and 3) change in productivity costs.
Methods: Using available data for Ontario, the total number of vaccinations given by provid-
ers in the 2011/12 influenza season (pre) was compared to the 2013/14 influenza season (post). 
Vaccine costs and provider fees for administration were assigned for both periods. An economic 
model was created to estimate the impact of the change in influenza vaccination volume on 
influenza-related outcomes and on the health care costs associated with treating influenza-related 
outcomes. Productivity costs due to both time off work due to getting vaccinated and influenza 
illness were considered. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to assess parameter uncertainty.
Results: The number of vaccinations received by Ontarians increased by 448,000 (3% of the 
population), with pharmacists vaccinating approximately 765,000 people/year. The increased 
cost to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care was $6.3 million, while the money 
saved due to reduced influenza-related outcome costs was $763,158. Productivity losses were 
reduced by $4.5 million and $3.4 million for the time invested to get vaccinated and time off 
work due to influenza illness, respectively.
Conclusion: After two influenza seasons, following the introduction of pharmacist-adminis-
tered influenza vaccinations, there was a net immunization increase of almost 450,000, which 
potentially saved $2.3 million in direct health care costs and lost productivity in the province.

Introduction
Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. On average, 12,200 hospital-
izations and 3,500 influenza-related deaths occur annually in Canada.1 Increasing 
influenza vaccinations can lead to considerable cost savings through a reduction in 
the utilization of health care services associated with influenza. An estimated 2.5% 
increase in the influenza vaccination rate of elderly Canadians results in a $16 million 
reduction in health care costs.2
In October 2012, as an initiative to increase accessibility to influenza vaccines and 
increase overall vaccination rates in Ontario, Canada (population 13.9 million3), the 
Universal Influenza Immunization Program (UIIP) authorized trained pharmacists to 
administer influenza vaccines to those aged 5 years and older.4 In the second influenza 
season following the implementation of pharmacy-administered influenza vaccinations, 
764,922 individuals were vaccinated by community pharmacists.5 As pharmacists 
continue to expand their scope of practice,6 it is important to estimate the economic

impact of pharmacist-administered vaccinations. Specifically, 
we evaluated the resource use and costs associated with the 
introduction of pharmacist-administered influenza vaccina-
tions in Ontario.
Methods
The economic analysis was composed of the following three 
components: 1) evaluation of vaccination-associated costs 
due to the changing number of people vaccinated; 2) impact 
of the change in vaccinations on influenza-related outcomes 
and costs; and 3) productivity costs associated with vaccina-
tion in the pre- and post-pharmacist-administered influenza 
vaccination periods. The main analysis was conducted from 
a public payer perspective, with a societal perspective consid-
ered in the productivity-related analysis. Targeted literature 
searches were conducted to identify relevant information 
for the clinical and economic data required to populate the 
economic model. All costs are reported in 2016 Canadian dol-
lars. All analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel (2011).
Changes in vaccination-associated costs
Pharmacist and physician billing data and public health 
influenza vaccination distribution data for two influenza 
seasons (2011/12 and 2013/14)7,8 were available and used to 
determine the number of influenza vaccinations administered 
by providers. The goal was to examine the number of vaccina-
tions administered by pharmacists in community pharmacies 
relative to those given by physicians and public health nurses 
and to estimate the costs of administration before and after 
the inclusion of pharmacists in the UIIP
.
The 2011/12 influenza season was prior to the inclusion 
of pharmacists and thus represented the “pre” pharmacist 
vaccination period.7 Since only a fraction of Ontario pharma-
cists participated in the first year of the program (2012/13) 
owing to the training requirements and approvals needed to 
participate, the 2013/14 influenza season was the first year 
of widespread adoption of pharmacist-administered vacci-
nations and represented the “post” pharmacist vaccination 
period.7 The change in the number of vaccinations admin-
istered over this period was calculated and categorized by 
health care provider.
Vaccination-associated costs were calculated by multiply-
ing the vaccine dose cost by the number of vaccinations by 
the provider combined with the professional billing fee for 
vaccine administration.
Wholesale vaccine costs for the five influenza vaccines 
available in Ontario (ie, Agriflu®, Fluviral®, Influvac®, Fluad®, 
and Fluzone Quadrivalent®) were obtained from an indepen-
dent community pharmacy. The average cost per dose was cal-
culated to be $9.45. To account for the tendering of vaccines, 
a 42.5% reduction was applied, representing the median of 
the 25–60% discount in market price provided to the Ontario 
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care across manufacturers. 
The final average vaccine cost per dose was $5.43.
For the physician billing fees for influenza vaccine admin-
istration, we assumed that the following two scenarios were 
possible: 1) the patient receives the vaccine during a physi-
cian visit concerning another matter, with a billing cost for 
vaccine administration of $4.50 (intervention code G590)9; 
and 2) the physician visit is solely for the vaccination, with 
a billing cost of $9.60 (intervention codes G590 [$4.50] and 
G700 [$5.10])9. It was assumed that 75% of the physician-
provided vaccinations were given during visits that were 
solely for vaccination.2 Thus, we used a weighted average 
of $8.33 per vaccination for physicians.
The pharmacist reimbursement fee was $7.50,10 and the fee 
per vaccination provided by a public health nurses was $5.00.11 
For providers that were classified as “Other”, the vaccination 
fee was assumed to be the same as for public health nurses. 
The resulting costs associated with the influenza vaccination 
by each health care provider were as follows: physicians, 
$13.76; pharmacists, $12.93; and public health unit and other 
nurses, $10.43.
impact of change in vaccinations on 
influenza-related outcomes and costs
A mathematical model was created in Excel to estimate the 
impact of the change in influenza vaccination volume in 
Ontario on influenza-related outcomes and associated health 
care costs. Variables and assumptions used in the model are 
summarized in Table 1. Baseline rates of influenza-related 
deaths and hospitalizations were based on influenza surveil-
lance data for Ontario.12–14 Annual rates of influenza-related 
physician visits and emergency room visits were based on 
Ontario-specific data.7 The annual probability of contracting 
influenza was estimated for those aged 5–64 years and those 
aged ≥65 years, based on published data.15
It was assumed that receiving a vaccination would reduce 
the rate of all influenza-related outcomes by a factor of 0.69 
for individuals aged 5–64 years and by 0.60 for individuals 
aged ≥65 years.15
The baseline risk of each of the influenza-related out-
comes was multiplied by the relative reduction of influenza 
outcomes from vaccinations to estimate the number of out-
comes avoided per 100,000 people vaccinated. For example, 
the baseline number of influenza-related hospitalizations 
for people aged ≥65 years was 115.07 per 100,000 indi-
viduals.12–14 This was multiplied by the relative reduction of

Economic analysis of influenza vaccination administered by pharmacists
influenza outcomes from vaccination for this age category 
(0.60) to estimate the number of hospitalizations avoided 
(115.07×0.60=64.09). Similar calculations were used to 
estimate the number of hospitalizations avoided per 100,000 
individuals aged 5–64 years (10.88×0.69=7.51).
Based on unpublished data from the Ontario Pharmacy 
Evidence Network (OPEN) on the age distribution of indi-
viduals vaccinated in pharmacies, we assumed that 73.4% 
of the individuals vaccinated were aged 5–64 years, while 
26.6% were aged ≥65 years. To estimate the impact of the 
change in number of influenza vaccinations on influenza 
outcomes, the number of outcomes avoided per 100,000 
individuals by age category was weighted by the proportion 
of individuals vaccinated by age category. The age-weighted 
number of outcomes avoided per 100,000 individuals was 
further increased by a factor reflecting the change in num-
ber of patients vaccinated following the introduction of the 
pharmacist vaccination program.
To estimate the health care savings from avoiding the 
various influenza-related outcomes, the number of each type 
of influenza outcome avoided was multiplied by the cost per 
 
outcome16 (Table 1) and inflated to 2016 Canadian dollars 
using the health care component of the Canadian consumer 
price index.17
Productivity costs
In addition to vaccine and health care resource costs, esti-
mates were made on the impact of the pharmacist-adminis-
tered vaccinations on productivity costs. The following two 
 
situations were considered in this analysis: 1) time invested 
related to time taken off from work to get vaccinated; and 2) 
time lost related to time missed from work owing to illness 
from catching influenza.
Time taken off from work to get vaccinated
To calculate the change in productivity costs due to time 
invested, the provider-specific change in the number of vac-
cinations was multiplied by provider-specific per-vaccination 
productivity costs. These were estimated considering: 1) the 
percentage of vaccinations assumed to occur during work 
hours; 2) the percentage of individuals vaccinated who are 
in the workforce; 3) the number of hours taken off work for 
an influenza vaccination; and 4) the average hourly wage in 
Ontario (Table 1).

O’Reilly et al
To estimate the annual change in productivity costs due to 
time lost, the number of annual influenza cases avoided after 
the inclusion of pharmacists in the UIIP was multiplied by the 
per-influenza case productivity cost. The per-influenza case pro-
ductivity cost integrated: 1) the percentage of influenza illnesses 
that would lead to a work absence (for those who are employed); 
2) the percentage of individuals who were vaccinated that are 
in the workforce; 3) the number of hours taken off work for 
influenza illness; and 4) the average hourly wage in Ontario.
Given that pharmacies in Ontario are generally open out-
side regular work hours (ie, evenings and weekends), it was 
assumed that pharmacist-administered influenza vaccinations 
would not require taking time off from work. Since family 
physician offices are primarily open during regular work 
hours, it was assumed that all the physician-administered 
influenza vaccinations would require time off work. A review 
of the hours of operation of public health influenza vaccina-
tion clinics in the region of Waterloo, Ontario, in the years 
2011/1218 and 2012/1319 found that the clinics were open on 
weekdays between 2:00 pm and 8:00 pm. Assuming that the 
workday ends at 5:00 pm, it was assumed that half of the 
influenza clinic hours occurred during regular work hours. 
Therefore, it was assumed that half of the public health nurse-
administered influenza vaccinations occurred during regular 
work hours. It was also assumed that half of the vaccinations 
by “other” providers occurred during regular work hours.
Data from Statistics Canada20 were used to derive the per-
centage of the population employed by age category (5–64 years, 
≥65 years). It was assumed that no individuals under the age of 
15 years would be employed full time. These data were com-
bined with Ontario 2016 population census data3 to estimate 
that 63% of the individuals aged 5–64 years are employed while 
13% of the individuals aged ≥65 years are employed full time. 
It was assumed that every influenza vaccination that resulted in 
a work absence would result in 2 hours of productivity loss.21
Assuming that all vaccinations administered by a pharma-
cist were done outside work hours and that all vaccinations 
administered by physicians were done within work hours 
would result in a reduction in productivity costs being incurred 
and thus favor the intervention and the best case scenario.
Time lost due to influenza-related illness
It was assumed that all influenza episodes result in a work 
absence among people who were employed for an average 
of 14 hours per case.22
scenario and sensitivity analyses
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to 
assess the overall uncertainty of the cost estimates. In PSA, 
the model results are simulated a large number of times. In 
each simulation, different values of the model inputs were 
chosen based on specified parameters and distributions. 
For the current analysis, beta distributions were applied 
to proportion-based variables, gamma distributions were 
applied to costs, and normal distributions were applied to 
non-proportion-based continuous variables (eg, hours of 
work per influenza illness). Parameter values for each vari-
able were approximated based on the findings from their 
source reference (eg, variation, number of patients). For cost 
variables with no information on variation, the lower and 
upper ranges were assumed to correspond to a 25% change in 
costs. The ranges provided in Table 1 represent the 95% CIs 
resulting from the parameters used for each variable in the 
PSA. Variables based solely on assumptions were not varied 
in the PSA. The model results were simulated 1,000 times.
In a hypothetical scenario analysis, the changes in influ-
enza-related health care outcomes and costs were estimated 
by altering the proportion of patients vaccinated in the ≥65 
age category. In the base case, the percentage of people vac-
cinated by age category was based on what was observed 
among pharmacist-provided vaccinations (73.4% aged 5–64 
years, 26.6% aged ≥65 years) (unpublished data from OPEN). 
In the scenario analysis, this value was replaced with the per-
centage of individuals vaccinated by age category observed 
among physician-administered vaccinations (ie, 59.1% aged 
5–64 years, 40.9% aged ≥65 years) (unpublished data from 
OPEN). By reducing the proportion of younger people get-
ting vaccinated, it reduces the number of people taking time 
off work vaccination as well as reducing the time taken off 
work if they contract influenza compared with the base case. 
This would essentially result in the intervention not being as 
favorable (ie, less money saved due to productivity losses).
In addition, one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted 
by changing one model variable at a time. The lower and 
upper range of values used in each one-way sensitivity analy-
sis is shown in Table 1. These ranges correspond to those used 
in the PSA. The one-way sensitivity analyses are presented 
in a tornado diagram, which plots the range of incremental 
costs estimated when each variable is varied on its own.

Economic analysis of influenza vaccination administered by pharmacists
number was 3.1 million, a net increase of 448,278. Phar-
macists administered approximately 765,000 vaccinations, 
while the number of vaccinations administered by physicians, 
public health, and others decreased (Figure 1).
The estimated incremental increase in direct expenditures 
associated with vaccinating the additional 448,278 people 
was $6.3 million (Table 2). This value includes both the 
cost of the vaccine and the billing fees for administering the 
vaccine by the health care provider.
impact of change in vaccinations on 
influenza-related outcomes and costs
Given that the number of hospitalizations avoided per 
100,000 individuals was estimated to be 7.51 for 5–64-year 
olds and 64.09 for those aged ≥65 years, the age-weighted 
number of hospitalizations avoided owing to vaccinations 
was estimated to be (7.51×73.4%) + (64.09×26.6%)=23.9. 
This number was further increased by a factor of 4.448278 
to reflect the impact of total change in annual vaccinations 
(448,278) in the post period on influenza-related hospital-
izations (23.9×4.44278=107.13) (Table 3). The increased 
number of vaccinations corresponded to 20,063 fewer 
influenza cases.
Given the reductions in health care service utilization, 
the corresponding cost saving in direct health care costs was 
estimated to be about $717,000 for influenza-related hospi-
talizations (Table 3). The increase in vaccinations translated 
into an overall saving of $763,158 when combining doctor’s 
office visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations.
Productivity costs
Time taken off from work to get vaccinated
With a large proportion of people using pharmacists’ services 
to get vaccinated and the likelihood of taking fewer hours 
off work relative to the period before pharmacists were 
permitted to administer influenza vaccines, the estimated 
productivity cost of the time invested was reduced by $4.5 
million (Table 4).
Time lost due to influenza-related illness
Based on the assumption of 14 hours’ lost work time per 
influenza case, and adjusting for the age-weighted propor-
tion of the population employed, it was estimated that 20,063 
influenza cases avoided by the increase in the number of 
people vaccinated would result in 131,007 fewer hours 
taken off work and productivity savings of $3.4 million in 
the program year.
Total change in annual costs
Compared to the 2011/12 influenza season, the incremental 
cost in administering an additional 448,278 vaccinations 
was $5.5 million. When the productivity costs are taken into 
account, the total estimated reduction in costs was approxi-
mately $2.3 million (Table 5).
scenario analysis
altering the proportion of patients vaccinated in 
each age category
If the percentage of those vaccinated by a pharmacist who 
were elderly (≥65 years of age) increased from 26.6% to 
40.9%, there would be a greater reduction in influenza-related 
outcomes and an additional savings of almost $270,000 
in influenza-related health care costs. However, this also 
resulted in $423,000 less productivity cost savings than the 
base-case scenario.

savings. Using the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the PSA 
simulations, incremental costs of pharmacist-administered 
vaccinations ranged from increased costs of $2.46 million 
to savings of $10.15 million.
A tornado diagram showing the incremental costs (sav-
ings) when varying the values in the five one-way sensitivity 
analyses is presented in Figure 2.
As shown in Figure 2, the variables that had the biggest 
impact on the incremental cost estimates were the prob-
ability that a pharmacy-administered vaccination takes 
place during work hours, the probability of contracting 
influenza for those aged <65 years, the number of hours 
taken off if a person is sick with influenza, and the propor-
tion of employed patients assumed to take time off work if 
they get influenza. The variables that are associated with 
productivity costs generally have a bigger impact on the 
results than variables that are not.
Discussion
After the introduction of the pharmacist-administered influ-
enza vaccination program, there was an increase of almost 
450,000 (3%) Ontarians vaccinated compared to the influenza 
season before the program. This is consistent with data from 
other provinces in Canada that support the benefit of pharma-
cists’ involvement in influenza vaccination programs.23–26 The 
increase in immunizations was associated with an increase of 
$6.3 million in expenditure to pay for the incremental vac-
cines and their administration. However, this improvement in 
vaccination numbers potentially saved $0.7 million in direct 
health care costs and $7.9 million in productivity costs. This 
results in a potential overall saving of $2.3 million. With a 
goal set by the Government of Canada to vaccinate 80% of 
all adults aged ≥65 years and adults aged 18–65 years with 
chronic medical conditions by 2025,27 the net increases in 
the number of individuals vaccinated against influenza that 
have been realized following the introduction of pharmacist-
administered influenza vaccination programs represent an 
additional strategy to help achieve this target.
There are limitations to the analysis. First, we relied on 
billing claims data for influenza vaccination counts. These 
claims data collect information at an individual level; there-
fore, the composition of family units and other individu-
als sharing the same household could not be determined.

Economic analysis of influenza vaccination administered by pharmacists
A greater risk of exposure to the virus from an infected 
household member could not be accounted for. In addition, 
productivity losses incurred by parents and other caregivers 
to a child with influenza were not included in the model, 
thereby underestimating productivity losses reported in this 
study. A provincial review of the administrative data set used 
also estimated that approximately 1 million doses were not 
accounted for and were probably doses administered by 
nurses in Family Health Teams.28 In addition, the distribution 
data used in the data calculation did not account for any wast-
age (eg, doses drawn up in error, multi-dose vials that had to 
be discarded). Also, we did not have the ability to account 
for two doses required for immunizing younger children. 
The increased number of individuals seeking immunization 
may also have been influenced by deaths related to H1N1 
reported in Canada in January 2014,29 thus providing a one-
time increase in uptake that year. This economic analysis 
should be replicated with vaccination counts observed from 
the 2014/15 influenza season onward to account for annual 
shifts in vaccination rates. At the time of writing, more recent 
data have not been published. The cost of the vaccine dose 
was also based on an average estimated price and discount 
and is an estimate of the actual cost to the Province of Ontario. 
Furthermore, given that we used modeling techniques to 
estimate the change in costs associated with the increase in 
influenza vaccinations, a number of assumptions were made 
using published data from the literature for risk variables, 
outcomes, and productivity costs. We used various scenario 
analyses and sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of 
these assumptions on the results.
Furthermore, this evaluation did not consider the fact 
that influenza is an infectious disease and easily transmitted 
from one person to another. For example, if more people were 
vaccinated there would be benefits for those who do not get 
vaccinated, resulting in fewer infections, leading to fewer 
days off work and less health care resource utilization. As a 
result, it is possible that the cost estimates found in this study 
are an underestimate of the true cost savings.
As of December 2016, nine of the ten provinces in 
Canada, but none of the three territories, had passed legisla-
tion that allowed pharmacists with appropriate certification 
to administer select vaccinations, including influenza vac-
cine.30 As of 2016, approximately, 9,229 of the 14,824 Part 
A pharmacists in Ontario had obtained certification.31
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
estimate the economic impact of the introduction of the

O’Reilly et al
pharmacist-administered influenza program in Ontario. 
Uptake of this service by younger adults is likely to reflect 
the convenience of receiving vaccinations from community 
pharmacists. While these individuals may be at lower risk of 
hospitalization or death from influenza than older patients, 
costs due to lost productivity can be significant and dem-
onstrate a societal benefit of convenient access to a UIIP 
including community pharmacists. The observed productivity 
benefits are significant at the individual patient level, relating 
to one’s ability to work and perform other necessary duties, 
at the health care provider level, by ensuring the availability 
of a healthy workforce to provide essential health services 
and reduced resource expenditure on influenza-related visits 
and sick-note documentation, and at the societal level, by 
minimizing the impact of influenza illness across all sectors. 
As influenza season recurs annually, even small impacts 
observed each year could translate to billions in productivity 
saved over a few years as pharmacist-administered influenza 
immunization programs continue to be introduced nationwide.
Conclusion
The policy of allowing pharmacists to administer influenza 
vaccinations was associated with an increase in vaccine uptake 
and a decrease in influenza-related health care resource utiliza-
tion and costs. When productivity costs are taken into account, 
the investment in the additional vaccinations was cost saving.
