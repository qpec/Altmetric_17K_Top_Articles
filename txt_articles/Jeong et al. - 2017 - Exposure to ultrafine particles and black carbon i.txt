Ultrafine particle (UFP), black carbon (BC) and lung deposited surface area (LDSA) concentrations
measured during 43 trips on diesel-powered commuter trains revealed elevated exposures under some
conditions. When the passenger coaches were pulled by a locomotive, the geometric mean concentra-
tions of UFP, LDSA, and BC were 18, 10, and 6 times higher than the exposure levels when the locomotive
pushed the coaches, respectively. In addition, UFP, LDSA, and BC concentrations in pull-trains were 5, 3,
and 4 times higher than concentrations measured while walking on city sidewalks, respectively. Expo-
sure to these pollutants was most elevated in the coach located closest to the locomotive: geometric
means were 126,000 # cm�3 for UFP, 249 mm2 cm�3 for LDSA, and 17,800 ng m�3 of BC; these con-
centrations are much higher than those previously reported for other modes of public transportation.
Markedly high levels of diesel exhaust are present in passenger trains powered by diesel locomotives
operated in pull-mode. Thus, it is recommended that immediate steps be taken to evaluate, and where
needed, mitigate exposure in diesel-powered passenger trains, both commuter and inter-city.

1. Introduction
Diesel exhaust was recently recognized as carcinogenic to
humans and has been associated with a wide range of other health
outcomes (IARC, 1989; Benbrahim-Tallaa et al., 2012; Straif et al.,
2013).
This
complex
mixture
of
particle
and
gas
phase
compounds contains components that can facilitate detection and
assessment of associated exposures. The particle phase for
example, contains elevated concentrations of ultrafine particles
(UFP, < 100 nm) and black carbon (BC), both of which can be
measured in high time resolution with handheld instruments.
Furthermore, both these components are toxic in their own right.
Some toxicological studies have suggested that UFP may be more
harmful than larger particles (>100 nm) due to increased surface
area for adsorption and condensation, higher deposition rates in
lung alveoli, and greater ability to translocate through organs

 (Oberd€
orster et al., 2002, 2005; Geiser et al., 2008). The surface
area of UFP has also been proposed as an appropriate exposure
metric for predicting pulmonary inflammation (Brown et al.,
2001; Oberd€
orster et al., 2005). Furthermore, fresh UFP from
traffic emissions can induce DNA damages via systemic oxidative
stress (Br€
auner et al., 2007; Møller et al., 2008). In epidemiological
studies, BC exposure has been associated with detrimental effects
to respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems (Suglia et al.,
2008; Baja et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2010; Janssen et al., 2011;
Heal et al., 2012). Commuting may constitute short but elevated
exposures on a regular basis, and likely contributes substantially
to overall daily exposure. Recent epidemiological evidence sug-
gests that even short-term exposures to UFP may have measurable
impacts on cardiorespiratory morbidity (Weichenthal, 2013;
Hemmingsen et al., 2015). In addition to the impact of exposure
time, routine exposures (e.g., daily commuting) could be a factor
with considerable ability to predict health effects (Pope III, 2007).
Individuals are exposed to variable levels of different air pollut-
ants depending on their mode of transit. Acute exposures to UFP
and BC while commuting by different modes (i.e., car, bus, rail,
bicycle, and waking) have been increasingly investigated in recent
years (Knibbs et al., 2011; Karanasiou et al., 2014). The surface area
of UFP can be used to derive the alveolar lung-deposited surface
area (LDSA), a possible health-relevant metric that has gained
attention in recent years (Buonanno et al., 2013; Spinazz�
e et al.,
2015; Geiss et al., 2016; Hudda and Fruin, 2016). The LDSA of
UFP is defined as the particle surface area weighted by the
deposition efficiency of particles in the alveoli based on a model
proposed by the International Commission for Radiological Pro-
tection (ICRP, 1994).
Past research supports that commuting to and from work often
accounts for a large portion of individuals' daily exposure to BC
and UFP and that the level of exposure is dependent on transit
mode (Knibbs et al., 2011; Karanasiou et al., 2014). In terms of rail
systems, most studies have focused on the exposure in electrified
train systems such as subways and light rail (Seaton et al., 2005;
Aarnio et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2009; Knibbs and de Dear,
2010; Dons et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015). Many North Americans
take commuter trains from the suburbs to the downtown core of
large cities. According to the 2011 National Household Survey in
Canada, 11% of public transit users commuted by commuter train
or streetcar (Statistics Canada, 2011). In the greater Toronto area
alone, approximately 180,000 passengers travel by commuter
train on an average weekday (Go Annual Report, 2012). Further-
more, similar diesel locomotives are used for public trans-
portation in Canadian and U.S. cities such as Vancouver, Chicago,
San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle.
All commuter trains in 18 out of 26 transit agencies in Canada and
the U.S. are hauled by diesel locomotives, while 6 transit agencies
use both diesel locomotives and electric locomotives (or electric
multiple units). The status of the electrification of commuter
trains in Canada and the U.S. has been summarized in the Sup-
porting Information. However, there is little quantitative infor-
mation that exists regarding in-transit exposure of passengers
commuting by diesel-powered trains; to the authors’ knowledge,
only one previous study has reported on this potentially impor-
tant source of UFP and BC exposure (Hill and Gooch, 2010).
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate exposure to UFP, LDSA,
and BC in trains pulled/pushed by a diesel locomotive during
routine morning and evening commuting trips. The exposure
levels in different positions of passenger trains were also exam-
ined in this study. The in-train exposure levels were compared to
pollutant levels measured while walking on urban sidewalks.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Study location and design
The concentrations of UFP and BC were measured inside
commuter trains linking suburban Richmond Hill and Union Sta-
tion in downtown Toronto, the most densely populated city in
Canada with an estimated population of 6 million people for the
metropolitan area (Statistics Canada, 2011). Trains on the Richmond
Hill line consist of 10 bi-level passenger coaches (26 m long � 3 m
wide � 5 m high) pulled or pushed by a diesel locomotive capable
of 4 000 hp. The locomotive is powered by ultra-low sulfur diesel
fuel with a maximum sulfur content of 15 mg/kg. Each coach has
two heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units: one at
each end of the coach. Outdoor air is introduced into recycled air
upstream of filters. The mixed air passes through these filters and
into the HVAC unit before being blown into the coach, which has
sealed windows. The outdoor air fan works to maintain positive
pressure within the coach when the doors are closed, and auto-
matically shuts off when the doors are opened at stations. There is
no change in the operation of the recycled and outdoor air systems
between summer and winter.
The measurements were conducted in the upper level of the
passenger coaches. Inbound trips to Toronto between 7 a.m. and 10
a.m. and outbound trips between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. were under-
taken on weekdays from July 6 to August 21, 2015. A total of 43 trips
were completed during the measurement period. Walking mea-
surements (38 trips) were taken between the University of Toronto
and Union Station immediately before or after the in-train mea-
surement. A single route was chosen for the in-transit (~33 km) and
walking (~3 km) trip, which typically required ~50 min and ~30 min
per one-way, respectively. The walking route consisted of sidewalks
on University Avenue for ~20 min from Union Station and nearby 4-
lane arterial roads (e.g., McCaul Street) for ~10 min. University
Avenue is a busy 8-lane road in downtown Toronto with approxi-
mate annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 48,000 vehicles per day.
Sampling was completed using portable UFP and BC samplers
(described in more detail later) carried in a backpack along with a
GPS device. The in-train and walking measurements were made on
days without rain; ambient temperature and relative humidity
ranged from 16 �C to 29 �C with a mean of 23 �C and 34%e84% with
a mean of 57%, respectively.
2.2. Black carbon measurement
Black carbon was measured every 10 s using a microAeth (AE51,
AethLabs, USA). The optical attenuation of light from an 880 nm
LED source is estimated by comparing light intensities though a
reference blank spot and the spot of aerosol on the filter strip of
AE51 (Weingartner et al., 2003). All filter absorption photometers
are affected by loading effects, which is related to a nonlinear ab-
sorption response to filter loading. BC concentrations measured by
the AE51 erroneously decrease as the filter loading increases. The
filter strip of the AE51 was changed every trip and the attenuation
was kept below 80. In addition, all BC data were post-processed to
correct the loading effect. The loading effect correction and the
performance evaluation of the AE51 are given in the Supporting
Information (Fig. S1).
2.3. Ultrafine particle number concentrations and surface area
measurement
The real-time number concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP)
were measured using a DiscMini (Testo AG, Germany), which is
based on unipolar charging of the aerosol and detection in two

and
filter.
A
detailed
description of the DiscMini can be found elsewhere (Fierz et al.,
2011). The DiscMini measured particles in the size range of
~10e700 nm every second with ±30% accuracy. In addition, the
DiscMini provides reasonably accurate LDSA measurements for
particles in the size range of 16e240 nm (Fierz et al., 2011). More
experimental details for the performance evaluation of the particle
counting efficiency and LDSA measurements by the DiscMini are
described in the Supporting Information (Fig. S2).
2.4. Statistical data analysis
UFP and BC measurements in two commuting modes, in-train
and walking, were compiled. For in-train measurements, the sta-
tistical analysis distinguished between when the locomotive pulled
the train (“pull-train”) and when the train was pushed by the
locomotive (“push-train”). For the pull-mode, measurements were
collected at a “front” location, in the first passenger coach located
just behind the locomotive, and at a “middle” location in the 5th or
6th coach, 120e150 m from the locomotive. Values for both the
front and middle locations were compiled and average values for
the pull-mode were determined by combining the front and middle
location measurements. One-minute averaged UFP and BC data
were tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test and found to be
skewed to the right (p < 0.01). Thus, geometric means of UFP, LDSA,
and BC were reported along with arithmetic mean and median. An
independent sample t-test was performed to test differences in UFP
and BC concentrations between push-train and pull-train modes. It
was also used to test differences between front and middle coaches.
A significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. More
details about data analysis are given in the Supporting Information.
3. Results and discussion
Descriptive statistics of the UFP, LDSA, and BC measurements for
train modes and walking modes are summarized in Table S2. Box-
whiskers plots of exposure levels for train commuting and walking
modes are depicted in Fig. 1 (Fig. S3 on a logarithmic scale). There
were substantial differences in UFP and BC concentrations in the
train between the two train modes. Across 28 trips, the average
concentrations of UFP, LDSA, and BC in pull-train mode were
greater than those in push-train mode by factors of 18, 10, and 6,
respectively. The elevated concentrations in the pull-mode along
with the difference between the push-train and pull-train mea-
surements suggest that locomotive emissions were the predomi-
nant source of in-train air pollution. The observed concentrations in
pull-trains were statistically significantly higher than concentra-
tions measured while walking on busy downtown streets. For the
walking commuting between Union station and the SOCAAR lab,
geometric mean concentrations of UFP, LDSA, and BC were 14,100 #
cm�3, 35 mm2 cm�3, and 2100 ng m�3, which were lower than the
average concentrations in pull-trains by factors of 5, 3, and 4,
respectively. Even higher concentrations were found when travel-
ling in the front coach of pull-trains (Train_Pull_Front in Table S2).
The UFP, LDSA, and BC averages in the front coaches were 34, 22,
and 14 times higher than those measured in push-trains, respec-
tively. The exposure levels of UFP, LDSA, and BC in the front coach
were 9, 7, and 9 times higher than the street levels, respectively.
Fig. 2 depicts the comparison of UFP, LDSA, and BC levels be-
tween the front and middle (5th or 6th coach) coaches of pull-
trains across 28 trips. Overall geometric mean concentrations of
UFP, LDSA, and BC in the front coach of pull-trains were 126,000 #
cm�3, 230 mm2 cm�3, and 17,800 ng m�3, respectively, whereas the
concentrations in the middle coaches were 49,600 # cm�3,
72 mm2 cm�3, and 4800 ng m�3. The UFP concentrations ranged
from 2000 to 693,800 # cm�3 with the 95th percentile of 407,400 #
cm�3, while the maximum BC concentration was 76,300 ng m�3
with the 95th percentile of 43,000 ng m�3 in the front coach of pull-
trains. These highly elevated concentrations in front coaches

 support the hypothesis that the exhaust plume from the locomotive
is penetrating into the train coaches through their air ventilation
system; this issue is particularly relevant in coaches located in close
proximity behind the locomotive in pull-mode. Concentrations of
the three measured pollutants were 3e4 times lower in middle
coaches than the levels in first coaches; however, the middle coach
concentrations were still notably higher than the exposure levels in
push-trains and on the downtown streets.
Fig. 3 illustrates how the concentrations of UFP and BC fluctu-
ated with train acceleration and speed during a typical pull-mode
morning commute. The train speeds dropped to zero at three
suburban stops before the express portion of the trip to the final
destination (i.e., Union Station). During this express portion, the
train travelled at essentially a constant speed and the UFP and BC
concentrations slowly rose, suggesting accumulation. Before de-
parture, the background pollutant levels in the coach were low:
7500 # cm�3 for UFP, 25 mm2 cm�3 for LDSA, and 2500 ng m�3 for
BC. These levels started to rise within 4 min of departure. During
the morning commuting ride (7:00 a.m. - 7:45 a.m.), UFP levels
ranged from 57,500 to 215,900 # cm�3 with a geometric mean of
155,900 # cm�3. Elevated BC concentrations were also observed,
ranging from 14,400 to 34,700 ng m�3 with a geometric mean of
21,600 ng m�3. The UFP and BC variations tended to closely follow
the train speed with a delay for 10e40 s. This may indicate higher

 emissions during train acceleration, with increased engine loadings
yielding higher concentrations of UFP and BC in the diesel engine's
exhaust. The relationship between UFP and BC are discussed in the
Supporting Information (Figs S4-S5). Regardless of the cause, it
appears that the chemical characteristics of the diesel exhaust
mixture varied over the duration of the trip, which could poten-
tially further influence variability in exposures inside passenger
coaches of pull-trains. Much more detailed chemical analyses will
be required to explore this potentially important secondary effect.
For a comparison, a time series plot of UFP and BC during a morning
commute in a push-train are shown in the Supporting Information
(Fig. S6). No strong increases of UFP and BC were observed in the
push-train mode.
Concentrations of UFP and BC in passenger commuter trains
were compared to the average concentrations encountered in
alternate modes of public transit (i.e., bus, subway, train) based on
concentrations given in the literature (Dennekamp et al., 2002;
Aarnio et al., 2005; Kaur et al., 2006; Asmi et al., 2009; Hill and
Gooch, 2010; Knibbs et al., 2011; de Nazelle et al., 2012; Dons
et al., 2012; Kingham et al., 2013; Ragettli et al., 2013; Li et al.,
2015; Lim et al., 2015; Moreno et al., 2015; Vouitsis et al., 2015;
Yang et al., 2015). On average, the arithmetic mean concentration
of UFP in the public transit was 32,700 # cm�3, ranging from 2800
to 137,400 # cm�3 (Fig. 4), indicating that the arithmetic mean UFP
concentration in pull-trains in this study was 3 times (5 times for
the front coach level) higher than the average UFP level in public
transit found in the literature.
In the literature, the highest UFP concentration was found to be
in diesel trains, followed by levels in diesel buses and subways. To
the best of our knowledge, only one other study has determined
concentrations of UFP in commuter trains, reporting values be-
tween 13,600 and 137,400 # cm�3 (Hill and Gooch, 2010). This is
comparable to concentrations measured in our study. The UFP
concentrations in buses including public and school buses ranged
from 2800 to 117,600 # cm�3 with a mean of 32,200 # cm�3, which
was clearly lower than the mean UFP concentration in pull-trains
but higher than those for push-trains. The UFP concentrations in
subways were also substantially lower than the levels in this study.
The BC measurements reported in the literature ranged from 2000
to 11,600 ng m�3 with an arithmetic mean of 6300 ng m�3, making
the mean BC concentration in pull-trains in this study 1.7 times
higher than that for other modes of public transit. Hill and Gooch
(2010)
reported
high
BC
concentrations
ranging
from
2000e7700 ng m�3 in diesel trains, which is in accordance with the
push- and pull-train BC levels in the study. The highest BC con-
centrations in the literature were found in diesel buses (i.e.,
11,600 ng m�3) and subways (i.e., 11,000 ng m�3) reported by Yang
et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2015), respectively; the median BC con-
centration (21,600 ng m�3) in the front coach of pull-trains was still
double this value. Velasco et al. (2013) reported elevated levels
(15,000 to 411,000 ng m�3) of BC inside boats in Bangkok, Thailand.
These boats differ from commuter ferries typically used in North
America but given these high levels, further investigation appears
warranted. Literature on LDSA measurements in public transit is
very limited, but LDSA concentrations of 30e90 mm2 cm�3 in urban
atmospheres provides one point of comparison (Albuquerque et al.,
2012; Gomes et al., 2012; Eeftens et al., 2015; Reche et al., 2015;
Spinazz�
e et al., 2015). Mean LDSA levels of up to 78 mm2 cm�3
were measured in diesel buses in Italy (Spinazz�
e et al., 2015); the
mean LDSA in the front coach of pull-trains in our study was higher
than this literature level for diesel buses by a factor of up to 4.
4. Conclusions
The aim of this study was to provide and compare UFP and BC
exposure concentrations in commuter trains, as indicators of the
exposure of passengers to diesel exhaust. Concentrations measured
using portable monitors during morning and evening commuting
trips revealed elevated exposures under some conditions. Specif-
ically, the position (push vs. pull) of a diesel locomotive relative to
the passenger coaches markedly affected the exposure levels.
Elevated in-coach concentrations in the pull-mode indicated that
exhaust from the locomotive was entering the ventilation system of
coaches. As a result, the concentrations of UFP and BC in pull-trains
were 18 and 6 times higher than the levels in push-trains, and 5 and
4 times higher than the concentrations measured while walking on
city sidewalks during rush-hour, respectively. In addition, these
UFP, LDSA, and BC exposure levels in pull-trains were substantially
higher than those for other commuter options reported in the
literature.
Overall, these results clearly indicate that some passengers on-
board pull-mode trains are being exposed to elevated level of
diesel exhaust. Hence, it is recommended that immediate steps be
taken to evaluate and where needed mitigate exposure in all diesel-
powered passenger trains, both commuter and inter-city. In-
stallations of high efficiency filters in the ventilation system of each
coach may offer a relatively quick opportunity to reduce in-train
exposure. In the interim, public health officials should consider
advising susceptible individuals to travel near the rear of pull-mode
commuter trains as a precaution. The coach selected by commuters
can reduce exposure in pull-trains; the concentrations in coaches in
the middle of the train were 3 and 4 times lower than those in the
coach closest to the locomotive; passengers with existing cardiac or
respiratory conditions may as a precaution want to travel near the
rear of pull-mode trains. Longer term electrification or the adoption
of more modern Tier IV engines should help to achieve much better
air quality and hopefully thereby eliminate this issue.
UFP, LDSA and BC were used as easily measurable indicators of
exposure to diesel exhaust. While these provided clear evidence
that elevated exposure is occurring under some conditions, no
related standards or guidelines exist for comparison. Moreover,

values, respectively. Red stars denote the mean concentrations from this study of UFP

 diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of gas and particle phase
compounds. Thus additional measurements of gaseous pollutants,
particulate matter mass and its chemical speciation in terms of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace metals should also be
performed on more railways and during other seasons to better
understand the severity of this exposure along with the potential
health implications. Finally, more research is needed so as to better
evaluate
the
current
and
historic
exposure
of
long-term
commuters.
