ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To investigate the practice of post-marketing studies in 
Germany during a three year period and to evaluate 
whether these trials meet the aims specified in the 
German Medicinal Products Act.
Design
Survey of notifications submitted to German regulatory 
agencies before post-marketing studies were carried 
out, 2008-10.
setting
Notifications obtained through freedom of information 
requests to the three authorities responsible for 
registering post-marketing studies in Germany.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Descriptive statistics of post-marketing studies, 
including the products under study, intended number 
of patients, intended number of participating 
physicians, proposed remunerations, study plan and 
protocol, and availability of associated scientific 
publications and reports on adverse drug reactions.
results
Information was obtained from 558 studies, with a 
median of 600 (mean 2331, range 2-75 000) patients 
and 63 (270, 0-7000) participating physicians per 
study. The median remuneration to physicians per 
patient was €200 (€441, €0-€7280) (£170, £0-£6200; 
$215, $0-$7820), with a total remuneration cost of 
more than €217m for 558 studies registered over the 
three year period. The median remuneration per 
participating physician per study was €2000 (mean 
€19 424), ranging from €0 to €2 080 000. There was a 
broad range of drugs and non-drug products, of which 
only a third represented recently approved drugs. In 
many notifications, data, information, and results 
were, by contract, strictly confidential and the sole 
property of the respective sponsor. No single adverse 
drug reaction report could be identified from any of the 
558 post-marketing studies. Less than 1% of studies 
could be verified as published in scientific journals.
COnClusiOns
Post-marketing studies are not improving drug safety 
surveillance. Sample sizes are generally too small to 
allow the detection of rare adverse drug reactions, and 
many participating physicians are strictly obliged to 
maintain confidentiality towards the sponsor. High 
remuneration and strict confidentiality clauses in 
these studies could influence the physicians’ reporting 
behaviours of adverse drug reactions.
Introduction
Post-marketing studies are a major activity in the life 
cycle of a licensed drug/medicinal product and are reg-
ularly conducted by pharmaceutical companies and 
contract research organisations. Regulatory agencies 
rely on such industry funded studies for surveillance of 
drug safety. In particular, the detection of “rare” (1 in 
1000) and “very rare” (1 in 10 000) adverse drug reac-
tions is often possible only with post-marketing studies.1
According to the German Medicinal Products Act 
(Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG) all companies initiating a 
post-marketing study in the German drug market are 
required by law to register their study. The act specifies 
that the purpose of such studies is to investigate the use 
of medicinal products in daily routine, to assess rare 
adverse drug reactions, and to improve long term drug 
safety.2  To our knowledge there is no such law in other 
countries requiring all post-marketing studies to be reg-
istered, and there is considerable variation in the defi-
nition of such studies and the scope of registration in 
other EU countries.3  In this context, it should be of note 
that drug licensing and pharmacovigilance activities 
have been harmonised in the EU since 2001.4
In the US, regulatory approval and registration of 
some post-marketing studies is required (such as inter-
ventional studies that must be registered under the US 
Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 
20075), but, unlike Germany, not all post-marketing 
studies have to be registered.
In light of the documented lack of knowledge about 
rare adverse drug reactions from pre-marketing ran-
domised controlled trials6  and systematic under-re-
porting of spontaneous reporting schemes,7  German 
regulators,8  physician bodies,9 
10  and statutory health 
insurers11 have re-emphasised the importance and

WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Post-marketing studies are not serving as a key tool for drug safety surveillance, at 
least among those registered in Germany
Sample sizes are generally too small to allow for the detection of rare adverse drug 
reactions, and many participating physicians are strictly obliged to maintain 
confidentiality towards the sponsor about all data, including adverse drug reactions
The post-marketing studies analysed are doing no measurable good to patients and

necessity of post-marketing studies for evaluating 
newly authorised drugs.
Despite Germany requiring the registration of all 
post-marketing studies, little is known on their size, 
cost, and nature. We therefore initiated freedom of 
information requests to obtain registration documents 
to understand the current state of post-marketing stud-
ies and evaluate whether these studies meet the aims 
specified in the Medicinal Products Act, particularly 
their potential to assess rare adverse drug reactions and 
thus help improve long term drug safety.
Methods
Registration of post-marketing studies in Germany 
takes place with three different authorities: the 
 
Statutory Health Insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversi-
cherung, GKV), the National Association of Statutory 
Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenärztliche Bundes-
vereinigung, KBV), and the drug regulator (Bundesin-
stitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, BfArM).
Before a post-marketing study is started, the law 
requires a company to submit a notification to the three 
authorities, including time, location, duration, pro-
posed number of patients and physicians, remunera-
tions of physicians per patient, and drug/medical 
device under study. These notifications inform the 
agencies of a sponsor’s intention to initiate a post-mar-
keting study. In 2009, the Medicinal Products Act was 
revised to additionally require the inclusion of a study 
plan and final report a year after the study ended. The 
content of these notifications has not been publicly 
accessed or analysed before.
Data sources
In June 2011 we sent out identical freedom of information 
requests to the three authorities responsible for the regis-
tration of post-marketing studies in Germany, requesting 
the notifications received by these institutions from 1 Jan-
uary 2008 to 31 December 2010. We also requested access 
to documents to assess, for each reported study, the 
issuer of the notification, be it the drug manufacturer 
itself or a contract research organisation, and the pro-
posed starting date and duration of the study.
In December 2011, GKV provided a tabulated listing of 
requested items on 48 pages, excluding physician remu-
nerations; no access to original documents was granted. 
KBV and the drug regulator initially denied our requests 
with the rationale that answering our questions would 
mean too much work for their responsible officers and 
moreover interfere with the agreements on confidential-
ity and protection of business secrets included in the 
contracts signed by the involved parties. Transparency 
International Germany (of which some of us are mem-
bers) therefore sued both KBV and the drug regulator 
and, in June 2012, prevailed in the lawsuit against KBV in 
the administration court of Berlin and, in July 2014, over 
the drug regulator in the administration court of Cologne. 
As a result of the lawsuit against KBV, we received 6925 
paper copies of original documents, representing a mix 
of emails, letters, pre-study documents such as con-
tracts, details of the studies, study plans, and lists of par-
ticipating physicians. All documents were those received 
by the KBV; none were documents that originated from 
the KBV (that is, those sent by the KBV to the company 
that submitted the notification), though we requested 
such documents as well. This could be an indication that 
the KBV does not correspond with the companies regard-
ing post-marketing studies. Personal data such as physi-
cians’ names and addresses and names of contract 
research organisations were redacted by KBV. At a later 
stage, however, KBV gave us the names of contract 
research organisations on a separate list, complying with 
our request. In April 2015, the drug regulator released to 
us 142 tabulated electronic pages of items related to 
 
post-marketing study notifications during 2008-10, but 
again denied access to original documents.
The German Medicinal Products Act requires that a 
company initiating a post-marketing study must file an 
identical notification of the study with three authori-
ties—namely, KBV, GKV, and the drug regulator. Under 
the law, the three authorities should receive and there-
fore report the same number of notifications for the 
three year period 2008-10. The fact that the three 
authorities disclosed a range in number of post-market-
ing studies (499 from the drug regulator, 558 from KBV, 
and 598 from GKV) was unexpected. As only KBV was 
forced by the court ruling to provide us with original 
notification documents, we decided that the KBV data 
are the most reliable data source.
We used the AMIS website of DIMDI (Deutsches Insti-
tut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information12 ) 
and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) database on 
medicines13  to determine each drug’s year of marketing 
authorisation, and we searched the drug regulator’s 
pharmacovigilance database of adverse drug reactions14 
 
to determine if any of the publicly reported reactions 
could be linked with a registered post-marketing study 
by searching for the respective drug within the time 
frame of the study. We defined a “newly authorised 
drug” as a drug that was approved no longer than two 
years before the start of the study. This cut off was cho-
sen to capture the early post-marketing phase of a drug, 
the period when previously unknown adverse drug reac-
tions tend to show up with a high probability of detec-
tion.15 To assess the extent to which registered 
post-marketing studies are published, we searched Med-
line and PubMed from 2008 to 2015 with the following 
search strategy: “non-interventional PMS OR post-mar-
keting NIS OR company observational PMS OR industry 
funded post-marketing trial OR adverse drug reaction 
AND (when available) the study ID AND drug name”.
Furthermore, we asked the drug commission of the 
German Medical Association (DCGMA) to search their 
adverse drug reaction database16 from 1 January 2009 to 
31 December 2012 for solicited reports on the drug dab-
igatran etexilate and to link these reports to the respec-
tive post-marketing study identification numbers.
Patient involvement

developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-

tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
analysis
As original documents could be obtained only from the 
KBV, we used these data for all analyses. We extracted 
data on the drugs/medicinal products under study, the 
intended number of patients, the intended number of 
physicians, the proposed remunerations, and purpose 
of study (study plan).
Experienced data managers from the Comprehensive 
Cancer Centre Aachen independently performed dou-
ble entry of the complete dataset of original documents. 
The revised dataset was analysed with descriptive sta-
tistics, providing counts, percentages, ranges, means, 
and medians.
Results
The drug regulator, KBV, and GKV reported different 
numbers of post-marketing studies during the same 
time period, 2008-10. The drug regulator reported 499, 
KBV 558, and GKV 598. The following results are based 
on the 558 studies reported to the KBV. Table 1 sum-
marises key characteristics of the post-marketing stud-
ies, stratified by year of registration.
During 2008-10, each year 185-188 post-marketing 
studies were initiated, sometimes more than one on the 
same drug. This is why the summary figure for the vari-
able “unique drugs” adds up only to 330. Often a spon-
sor initiated several post-marketing studies.
Out of the 558 post-marketing studies, 445 were 
planned to take place only in Germany, 41 in Germany 
and the EU, and 25 multinationally, including the US and 
other countries outside the EU. Information on location 
was missing in 47
. About a half were conducted by con-
tract research organisations, which were responsible for 
data handling, reporting to the sponsor, and notifying 
the regulatory authorities about the conduct of the study.
Fifty four percent (304/558) of the notifications were 
fewer than 10 pages long, with 11% (63/558) fewer than 
three pages. Notifications with 10 or more pages 
increased to 55% in 2010. Table 2 shows the large range 
of length per notification. Over the full study period, 
72% of notifications had no study plan or protocol. 
Though study plans have been required for notifica-
tions since 2009, only 21% in 2009 and 40% in 2010 had 
a study plan or protocol. Notifications also sometimes 
lacked other fields such as intended number of patients 
(17% missing), intended number of physicians (15%), 
and physicians’ remuneration (35%).
Table 2 also shows the requested and obtained infor-
mation on the 558 notifications registered by the KBV. 
The median number of patients covered by a post-mar-
keting study was 600 (mean 2331), with a broad range 
from two to 75 000. The median number of participating 
physicians was 63 (mean 270), ranging from 0 to 7000. 
We calculated a ratio of patients to physicians for each 
study, with a median of eight and a mean of 85 patients 
per physician, and a range of one to 10 000 patients per 
physician. The reported median patient based remuner-
ation was €200 (mean €441, range €0-€7280). Total 
remuneration costs per study were more than €500 000 
on average, and overall remuneration costs were more 
than €217m for 558 studies registered in a three year 
period. The calculated remuneration per physician per 
study amounted to a median of €2000 (mean €19 424; 
range €0-€2 080 000).

number of patients per study—that is, 1-100, 101-500, 
501-1000, 1001-10 000, and >10 000 patients. Of the 558 
studies, 55% (306) comprised fewer than 1000 patients 
per study, and only 4% (21) intended to include more 
than 10 000. Again, studies of newly authorised drugs 
had rather small sample sizes, with 54% (93/171) enroll-
ing <1000 patients per study. Only about a third of the 
studies for newly authorised drugs were designed for 
more than 1000 patients, with just 15% (26/171) includ-
ing more than 3000 patients.
In contrast with the planned patient enrolment, the 
notification documents showed that the intended num-
ber of participating physicians per study was relatively 
high, with substantial variability across proposed study 
sample sizes. While more than half (306) of all studies 
intended to enrol fewer than 1000 patients, nearly half 
(147/306) of these studies included more than 20 physi-
cians (table 4), leading to a low ratio of patients to phy-
sicians per study.
Although mandatory by law, information on numbers 
of participating patients and/or physicians was lacking 
in 33% (182) of post-marketing studies (table 4).
Figure 1 shows the calculated physicians’ remunera-
tion per post-marketing study by different categories of 
patient enrolment. Across all enrolment categories the 
range of remuneration was wide, with no clear trend 
between study size and calculated remuneration. With 
up to 1000 enrolled patients, the most common category 
of physician remuneration was €1000-€10 000, with 
about 10% of physicians earning up to €50 000. In larger 
studies, 16% of physicians were paid more than € 10 000, 
some of them earning more than €200 000 per study.
As shown in figure 2, the 558 post-marketing studies 
covered a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-drug 
products: biologicals, oncology drugs, antipsychotic 
drugs, antivirals, contrast agents, hormonal treat-
ments, antihypertensives, haematology drugs, and 
orphan drugs as well as non-prescription drugs. A third 
of the studies covered recently authorised drugs (less 
than two years before the start of the post-marketing 
study); in these studies remuneration for physicians 
was on average twice as high compared with studies of 
other medicinal products (data not shown).
Among the 158 study plans submitted to the KBV we 
found contracts on the duties and obligations of physi-
cians and sponsors, including confidentiality clauses.
Figure 3 shows an example of a confidentiality agree-
ment, explaining that data, information, and results of 
a post-marketing study are strictly confidential and the 
sole property of the respective sponsor. Finally, we were 
not able to identify any reports on adverse drug reac-
tions from the 558 post-marketing studies in the drug 
regulator’s public adverse drug reactions database. For 
only five of all 558 post-marketing studies were we able 
to find a respective paper in a scientific journal.
discussion
Principal findings
Our analysis of previously inaccessible original notifica-
tion documents on post-marketing studies registered 
2008-10 shows the extensive use of human and financial 
resources. In this three year period more than a million 
patients and over 126 000 physicians (not necessarily 
unique) were estimated to have participated in 558 
post-marketing studies, sponsored by 148 manufacturers 
of drugs or medicinal products. These companies spent 
more than €217m on physicians’ remunerations alone.
The practice of post-marketing studies we describe 
takes place in many EU countries, such as Italy, France, 
Spain, and Austria.3 In contrast with these other coun-
tries, however, only in Germany do all such studies have 
to be registered. We therefore think there is good reason 
to believe that the German data we analysed are repre-
sentative of post-marketing studies across the EU.
The quality of the documentation was low, and there 
were substantial deviations from legal requirements 
specified in the German Medicinal Products Act with 
respect to the aims and conduct of post-marketing stud-
ies. The large range in length of notification documents 
reflects the considerable heterogeneity of sponsors’ 
approach to registration requirements. The median of 
eight pages raises questions about whether studies are 
being sufficiently described before they start.
Looking at the study plans, which were present in only 
158 of 558 notifications, the designs mostly consisted of 
case series,17  often labelled with ambiguous terms such

as single arm cohort studies or prospective studies. In the 
context of drug safety research, arbitrarily selected case 
series of patients receiving the study drug without a suit-
able comparison group are prone to bias and make inter-
pretation of the results difficult, if not impossible.17
Compared with a descriptive study of premarket trials 
underpinning drug approval,18  we found that post-mar-
keting studies had lower patient enrolment (median 
760 enrolled in trials versus 600 planned in studies) but 
were of considerably longer duration (98 days for 
pre-market trials versus 480 days for post-marketing 
studies). For example, according to EMA information,19 
 
lenalidomide (Revlimid) has been investigated with two 
randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2000 
patients, one comparing lenalidomide with placebo, 
the other against a standard treatment for multiple 
myeloma. In the post-marketing study on lenalidomide 
only 100 patients and 18 physicians were involved. Dab-
igatran etexilate (Pradaxa)20  has been investigated with 
two main studies comparing the drug with enoxaparin, 
another anticoagulant, in patients who had undergone 
a hip or knee replacement. The first study involved 2101 
patients who had had a knee replacement operation, 
and the second involved 3494 patients who had had a 
hip replacement. In our dataset we found two post-au-
thorisation safety studies (PASS) on dabigatran (PASS 
1160.84 and PASS 1160.85). These studies were man-
dated post-marketing studies because of specific safety 
concerns raised by regulatory agencies during drug 
approval. In PASS 1160.84, 300 patients with renal 
impairment were undergoing knee or hip replacement. 
PASS 1160.85 included 2036 patients with normal renal 
function undergoing hip or knee replacement. These 
few examples illustrate that the median number of 
patients enrolled in our sample of post-marketing stud-
ies (600 patients) tends to be smaller than the respec-
tive numbers (760 patients) recently described for 
pre-marketing randomised controlled trials.18  Less than 
a third of post-marketing studies, including those on 
newly authorised drugs, planned to include more than 
1000 patients. Given that the probability of discovering 
one rare adverse drug reaction with an incidence of 1 in 
10 000 requires a large sample size of at least 30 000 
patients (achieving a power of 95%),6 these enrolment 
figures seem far too small to meet the specified objec-
tives of post-marketing studies to contribute to pharma-
covigilance and drug safety. With respect to the 
regulators, it is unclear what authorities do with the 
notifications they receive, considering that many of the 
notifications we obtained were missing required fields. 
The GKV and the KBV entered the information into a 
post-marketing study database, which they use for 
internal purposes. Until 2015, however, the drug regula-
tor did not systematically file the notifications but 
instead registered them as a regular postal document in 
consecutive order of daily mail arrivals.
Our attempts to identify reports on adverse drug reac-
tions from the 2008-10 post-marketing studies in the 
adverse event database (Unerwünschte Arzneimittel-
wirkung (UAW)14 ) were unsuccessful. The drug regula-
tors’ UAW database contains spontaneous reports from

individual physicians and solicited reports—that is, 
adverse drug reaction reports provided by manufactur-
ers from pre-marketing or post-marketing studies or 
other sources—without linking of these solicited reports 
to post-marketing study notifications. To our knowledge 
the drug regulator, KBV, and GKV did not receive indi-
vidual patient documents from any study. Of the 558 
post-marketing studies we were able to find only five 
journal articles that reported results of these studies in 
the databases we searched up to 2015. As only less than 
10% (53) of studies were planned to finish after the end 
of 2013 we think there should have been enough time 
for most to be published. Even in the publicly accessible 
study registries of the Association of Researching Phar-
maceutical Manufacturers (Verband der forschenden 
Arzneimittelhersteller), or the clinicaltrials.gov registry, 
final reports or references to publications of the 558 
post-marketing studies were sparse with hardly any 
agreement between the different trial registries. Our 
findings suggest that it is not only regulators in the 
automotive sector who “have to ask tougher questions 
about how their rules are being implemented.”21
Purpose of post-marketing studies
Post-marketing studies have been criticised for their low 
scientific value.22  The main criticism relates to what Mar-
cia Angell has called “marketing masquerading as 
research,”23 —that is, studies that are carried out for com-
mercial reasons, not scientific ones, raising questions 
about their ethical basis.24 
25  In addition, the more expen-
sive drugs used in so called “seeding trials”—sometimes 
called marketing trials—impose considerable extra costs 
to the healthcare system without measurable benefit to 
patients.26  The existence of seeding trials has been veri-
fied by confidential documents accessible to medical 
experts testifying in legal proceedings,27 
28  but gauging 
their prevalence has been difficult.29  The low ratio of 
patients to physicians that other authors have observed 
in seeding trials27 
28  was also observed in our study and is 
conducive to low data quality as the training and moni-
toring of many physicians, each treating only a few 
patients, is cumbersome and inefficient.28
adverse event reporting
Bearing in mind that spontaneous reporting is thought to 
cover 10% of all serious adverse drug reactions and less 
than 5% of non-serious ones,30  the current practice of 
post-marketing studies is likely to aggravate the under-re-
porting of adverse drug reactions. Our data show that par-
ticipating in a post-marketing study is acceptable among 
a considerable proportion of physicians in Germany. In 
the contracts we reviewed we found confidentiality 
clauses requiring physicians to report adverse drug reac-
tions exclusively to the sponsor rather than to the sponta-
neous reporting scheme. This raises the question of 
whether such contracts represent a conflict of interest 
with the physicians’ professional code of conduct31  as it 
would necessarily diminish their individual, direct role in 
reporting of such events. Furthermore, we were unable to 
assess whether adverse drug reactions occurring within 
our sample of studies were also reported by the sponsor to 
the respective authorities. In the above mentioned study 
on dabigatran etexilate, for example, we found indica-
tions that adverse drug reactions occurring within 
post-marketing studies might have never or only partially 
been reported. Shortly after market authorisation of dab-
igatran, a new anticoagulant licensed in 2008 for preven-
tion of thrombosis in patients after hip and knee 
replacement, the manufacturer initiated two post-au-
thorisation safety studies, which were among the notifi-
cations to the KBV (PASS 1160.84 and PASS 1160.85). 
Severe side effects of dabigatran, especially bleeding 
complications and death, have been reported, especially 
in elderly patients with impaired renal function.32  In 
addition, previously undisclosed data from pre-market-
ing trials on dabigatran had shown that the risk of bleed-
ing and the necessity of measuring plasma concentrations 
in patients taking dabigatran were downplayed by the 
manufacturer.33  In contrast with PASS 1160.85, compris-
ing 2036 patients with normal renal function, PASS 
1160.84 intended to enrol 300 patients with moderate 
impairment of renal function. While we could find a link 
to the tabulated final synopsis on PASS 1160.85 published 
in 2013 in the clinicaltrials.gov database,34  PASS 1160.84 
was not finished at the projected date (1 February 2012) 
nor was any final report or reference to results or side 
effects retrievable from Pharmacovigilance Risk Assess-
ment Committee (PRAC) reports or other sources before 
2015. Instead, by June 2014, more than two years after the 
scheduled end date, the drug regulator and KBV received 
a change notification of the termination date to 2014. 
Based on the  
documents that were provided it seemed 
that neither the drug regulator nor other authorities had 
taken notice of the course of PASS 1160.84. When we 
attempted to obtain specific information on adverse drug 
reactions on PASS 1160.84 between 2009 and 2012 from 
the solicited reports to the DCGMA database it turned out 
that the 68 severe adverse drug reactions could not be 
linked to any PASS/post-marketing study on dabigatran.35 
 
It was not until June 2015 that a tabulated result section 
including adverse drug reactions of PASS 1160.84 was 
added to the respective clinicaltrials.gov study page.36  No 
reference to time of occurrence of serious adverse events 
was provided. Considering the legal obligation of report-
ing serious adverse events within 15 days after learning 
about the event,37  it is of concern that PASS 1160.84 was 
not terminated at the projected date but three years later, 
without any explanation why the study period was so 
much prolonged and with no traceable hints to PASS 
1160.84 in PRAC reports during 2009-15. It is worth noting 
that after the initiation of a post-authorisation safety 
study, oversight by PRAC with periodic reporting is 
required.4  Our findings, however, highlight the fact that if 
reporting of adverse drug reactions from a post-authorisa-
tion safety study/post-marketing study is delayed or 
occurs in such a way that does not allow a determination 
of whether events listed in a pharmacovigilance database 
occurred under a post-marketing study or not, this is con-
cerning from a transparency and public health perspec-
tive. Our research points out that not only in sponsor 
directed randomised controlled trials38 but also in 
post-marketing studies, withholding of data on adverse

drug reactions or other information by the sponsor is a 
problem that so far has not been adequately dealt with.
Data from the UK and the US have shown that by the 
mid-1990s, 5% of hospital admissions and 0.1% of 
deaths of medical patients and 0.01% of deaths of surgi-
cal patients were caused by adverse drug reactions.6 
 
Some 20 years later drug prescribing habits of doctors 
have skyrocketed,39  with prescription patterns follow-
ing industry payments.40-42  Some authors have docu-
mented that the number of reports of adverse drug 
reactions decreased by 58% in some areas of the UK 
during the past two decades.43  This study found a 
strong correlation between high prescription rates and 
low spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions by 
GPs in the UK.43  Assuming that industry payment for 
participation in post-marketing studies is one reason 
for increased prescribing of drugs, as suggested by the 
literature on seeding trials,25 27 28  the decreases in 
reporting of adverse drug reactions over time should be 
of concern as a possible unintended consequence of 
post-marketing studies. We cannot exclude that signing 
of post-marketing study confidentiality contracts in 
combination with the high remunerations could influ-
ence physicians’ attitudes and practice of reporting 
adverse drug reactions, in particular when contracts 
require physicians to report reactions exclusively to the 
sponsor, as we found was the case in our study. From 
the patients’ and public health perspective, such influ-
ences on physicians are detrimental as they undermine 
the prominent and irreplaceable role of GPs/clinicians 
in detecting, diagnosing, and reporting adverse drug 
reactions for continued drug safety monitoring.6
strengths and limitations of study
For the first time we have analysed previously inaccessible 
original notification documents provided by 148 manufac-
turers of drugs or medicinal products over a three year 
period on their post-marketing study activities. In particu-
lar, we found contracts with strict confidentiality clauses 
that had not been available for public scrutiny before. 
These were obtained after two lawsuits and administrative 
court rulings granting freedom of information rights on 
notification data from post-marketing studies.
Our study has limitations. As mentioned before we 
analysed original notification documents but not real 
study data. The notification documents provide data on 
planned studies, but we do not know how these 
post-marketing studies were carried out in reality. For 
example, we do not know if the intended numbers of 
patients or physicians were really achieved in the 
course of the study. Our calculated number of 126 000 
participating physicians is likely to be an overestimate 
because physicians can participate in several post-mar-
keting studies. Nor do we know anything about data 
quality and checks of data quality in these studies. We 
cannot be sure either, whether the physicians received 
more or less remuneration than envisaged. Our finding 
that most post-marketing studies were not published by 
2015 in the databases we searched cannot exclude pub-
lications elsewhere. In light of the scientific purpose of 
post-marketing studies, however, published results of 
these studies should be traceable in established medi-
cal literature databases. Similarly our inability to con-
nect the notifications with adverse drug reaction reports 
in the UAW database is because there is no tagging of 
the respective reaction reports with specific post-mar-
keting studies. Therefore we cannot know whether the 
adverse drug reactions database contains reports from 
our sample of post-marketing studies.
Being aware that we looked only at original notifica-
tions rather than the real study documents and that the 
completeness of the given information was far from sat-
isfactory, our results should be seen as a first estimate 
of the magnitude and potential risks incurred with cur-
rent post-marketing study activities.
Conclusions and policy implications
Our findings do not support the aspiration of the Ger-
man Medicinal Products Act that post-marketing stud-
ies serve to improve long term drug safety surveillance. 
In contrast, we found evidence that drug safety could 
be jeopardised by the current practice, as post-market-
ing studies are expected to contribute to pharmacovigi-
lance, but in reality their data and results are treated as 
business secrets. Our data support the view that the 
high remunerations paid by the sponsor to the partici-
pating physician could be serving commercial purposes 
rather than transparent and effective pharmacovigi-
lance. In our opinion the major problem with 
 
post-marketing studies is the confidentiality clauses in 
the contracts between physicians and sponsors. These 
contracts impose a major obstacle to scientific evalua-
tion and discussion of post-marketing studies. In the 
interest of drug safety and public health, post-market-
ing surveillance should become more transparent. Data 
about and from such studies should no longer be con-
sidered confidential business information but should 
be made available to independent scientific evaluation 
and public scrutiny. Such increased transparency 
would allow future researchers to evaluate whether the 
changes in 2012 to EU pharmacovigilance legislation44 
have been associated with any material improvements 
in the situation.
The importance of advising GPs and clinicians on their 
indispensable role in detecting, diagnosing, and report-
ing adverse drug reactions cannot be overestimated.
