Abstract In two studies, the SCRABBLE skill of male and
female participants at the National SCRABBLE Champi-
onship was analyzed and revealed superior performance for
males. By collecting increasingly detailed information
about the participants’ engagement in practice-related
activities, we found that over half of the variance in
SCRABBLE performance was accounted for by measures
of starting ages and the amount of different types of
practice activities. Males and females did not differ sig-
nificantly in the benefits to their performance derived from
engagement in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone (pur-
poseful practice). However, gender differences in perfor-
mance were fully mediated by lower engagement in
purposeful practice by females and by their rated prefer-
ence for playing games of SCRABBLE—an activity where
more extended engagement is not associated with increased
SCRABBLE performance. General implications from our
account of gender differences in skill acquisition are dis-
cussed, and future research is proposed for how the
duration of engagement in effective deliberate practice can
be experimentally manipulated.
Gender gaps in academia, particularly in STEM fields, are
currently of great national concern. In 2014, the then
President Barack Obama framed gender differences as a
matter of national economic interest, stating:
‘‘There’s so much talent to be tapped if we’re
working together and lifting it up. Right now, fewer
than one in five bachelor’s degrees in engineering or
computer science are earned by women. Fewer than
three in ten workers in science and engineering are
women. That means we’ve got half the field – or half
our team we’re not even putting on the field. We’ve
got to change those numbers. These are the fields of
the future. This is where the good jobs are going to
be. And I want America to be home for those jobs.’’
(White House, 2014)
President Obama assumes that men and women have
equal or, at least similar, abilities to succeed in these fields
and that lower participation rates by women imply that the
United States is not maximizing its potential. Despite
Obama’s influential view, the cause of differences in pro-
fessional success between men and women is hotly debated
in the social sciences. One view is that discriminatory glass
ceilings cause these differences (Raggins, Townsend, &
Mattis, 1999) or other social and psychological barriers
(e.g., stereotype threat; Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999).
Another view is that while there are limited differences in
average ability, the variability of individual differences
among males is greater than among women, which leads to
more men being represented at the highest end of the dis-
tribution (Hedges & Nowell, 1995). Another view is that

 differences in life choices among men and women cause
the differences in performance (Ceci & Williams, 2010;
Ferriman, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009).
For people to reach their career goals, they must suc-
cessfully pass through several barriers, and the selection of
admitted applicants at many career stages is never solely
based on objective ability and capacity to succeed.
Unearned
favorable
opportunities
can
cause
lasting
advantages for members of favored groups (Merton, 1968),
and the accumulation of these small advantages can then
interact to create substantial differences in professional
prospects and attainment (Martell, Lane, & Emrich, 1996).
These biases are particularly problematic when success is
defined by subjective evaluations by supervisors and peers.
It is, therefore, essential that the performance of profes-
sionals is measured objectively, which is difficult to do
within and especially across STEM domains.
Our approach to studying gender differences follows the
expert-performance approach (Ericsson, 2006; Ericsson &
Ward, 2007), where we identify domains with objective
measures of performance. There are domains of perfor-
mance requiring reasonably similar abilities to those nec-
essary for success in professional STEM domains, which
do not have most of the barriers associated with profes-
sional training and performance. This paper will study the
competitive domain of SCRABBLE to assess if there are
gender differences and, if so, to attempt to identify the
determining factors. The domain of expertise in SCRAB-
BLE is particularly interesting for research on gender
because there are more female competitors than male.
SCRABBLE also has an objective rating system based on
the chess rating system designed by Elo (1965). Addi-
tionally, SCRABBLE has very few barriers to entering
competitions because the fees in top tournaments are low—
even the world championship has an entry fee of no more
than £150 (Mind Sports International, 2014).
In this paper, we will discuss how our knowledge about
the acquisition of expert performance during individuals’
lives may help us identify factors influencing gender dif-
ferences in attained level of intellectual performance. We
first review our current knowledge about gender differ-
ences in elite performance and associated differences in the
distribution of individual differences in performance for
females and males. We will then review evidence for
individual differences in the development of performance
resulting from particular types of experiences in the
domain and domain-specific practice activities. This paper
examines how differential engagement in activities may
account for individual differences in attained performance
in SCRABBLE and if such differential engagement might
account
for

differences
in
attained
performance.
Gender differences in high levels of performance
in domains emphasizing intellectual activity
There are domains emphasizing cognitive activity, such as
chess, go, and bridge, where the best male players typically
outperform the best female players to such a degree that the
genders sometimes compete separately and some compe-
titions are restricted to only females. Charness and Gerchak
(1996) proposed that gender differences in chess could be
accounted for by the vastly larger number of active male
players in comparison to female players and thus might not
reflect differences in ability between males and females.
For example, even when the underlying ability distribution
of the two genders is identical, one would find the average
ability of the top 10 from a sample of 100,000,000 men
would be much higher than that for the top 10 from a
sample of 50,000 women.
Another explanation for gender differences in perfor-
mance is that males are more motivated than females to
perform well during competitions. For example, laboratory
studies show that when a task is modified to increase
competitive pressure, males improve their performance
while females’ performance does not change significantly
(Croson & Gneezy, 2009).
Finally, stereotype threat (Spencer et al., 1999) has been
offered
as
an
explanation
of
gender
differences
in
chess performance. An experimental study by Maass,
D’Ettole, and Cadinu (2008) found that women chess
players who played matches against male players on a
computer with the same chess ratings performed worse
than their rating would predict when they were made aware
that they were playing against a male opponent. This
reduced performance is surprising because the participant’s
chess ratings were based on tournament performance, that
would have included many matches against males. Until
research shows that female chess players perform worse
when they play male players in tournaments, this expla-
nation cannot account for gender differences in chess rat-
ings and outcomes in chess tournaments.
Our review found only a few studies analyzing person-
ality measures to account for gender differences in com-
petitive performance. For instance, Duckworth and Quinn
(2009) found no gender differences on the Grit Scale,
which is hypothesized to measure perseverance and
determination, when they analyzed an Internet sample and
a sample of West Point cadets. Similarly, a study con-
ducted at the National Spelling Bee found no differences
between females and males in Grit or competition perfor-
mance (Duckworth, Kirby, Tsukayama, Berstein, & Eric-
sson, 2011). Finally, Marsh et al. (2013) found no
differences between genders for Harmonious Passion

Gender differences in expert scrabble
performance
In SCRABBLE tournaments, males perform at a higher
level than females. The National Tournament divides
players into six ranked divisions, and males dominate at the
highest levels of performance. In 2002, 86% of competitors
in the division with the best SCRABBLE players were
male, while in the division with the lowest performance
only 31% of competitors were male (McCarthy, 2008).
Given that most players in SCRABBLE tournaments are
female (Fatsis, 2001; Tierney, 2005), the higher ratio of
female to male players cannot explain the male advantages
in SCRABBLE—in fact, one would predict females should
be more prevalent than men at the top level.
The gender distribution of high levels of SCRABBLE
performance is similar to those in STEM fields where the
predominance of males increases at higher levels of
achievement (Lubinski & Benbow, 2006). Consequently,
SCRABBLE is a domain with objective measures of per-
formance and virtually unrestricted entry requirements,
where many proposed general accounts of the gender gap
described earlier are highly unlikely.
In a previous questionnaire research study on SCRAB-
BLE tournament players, Halpern and Wai (2007) reported
significantly lower SCRABBLE ratings for women with
d = -0.26
(Study
1),
d = -1.25
(Study
2),
and
d = -0.58 (Study 3). Consistent with male domination at
higher levels, Study 2 had the highest average SCRABBLE
ratings of the three studies and also a greater male
advantage. There is some evidence that the gender differ-
ences in SCRABBLE are surprising. A recent survey of
graduate students in a class on gender differences in cog-
nition found that, on average, the students incorrectly
predicted there would be more female than male champi-
ons (Halpern, Straight, & Stephenson, 2011), when in fact,
the past ten World Champions in SCRABBLE were all
males.
The effect of experience on attained objective high-
level performance
When we are interested in assessing potential gender dif-
ferences in ability, it is essential that we study objective
performance. In STEM fields, nearly all judgments of an
individual’s achievement are made by predominately male
individuals, such as male teachers, male administrators, or
male peers (Brink & Benschop, 2014). Consequently, these
males may be susceptible to making biased judgments of
performance as well as bias in their support and encour-
agement of students and trainees. In this paper, we will
adopt the expert-performance approach (Ericsson, 2006;
Ericsson & Ward, 2007), where we focus on measures of
objective performance.
In a review of factors associated with attaining expert
levels of objective performance, Ericsson, Krampe, and
Tesch-Ro
¨mer (1993) found that acquisition of high levels
of
competitive
performance
requires
engagement
in
extended teacher-guided practice activities specifically
designed
to improve current
performance.
(Ericsson,
2006, 2016). We refer to teacher-guided purposeful prac-
tice as deliberate practice, where the term purposeful
practice refers to individualized practice with a particular
goal, in which the individual engages in practice tasks with
opportunities for feedback, repetition, and refinement
(Ericsson & Pool, 2016). Deliberate practice requires that
the individual meets regularly with a teacher, who can
assess his or her current performance level, recommend
appropriate targets for improvement and then describe
training activities that the individual can engage in by
themselves with opportunities for feedback, repetition, and
refinement. Without the supervision of a teacher or coach,
the individual must select practice activities in the absence
of domain knowledge, often accumulated over centuries,
that
has

effective
in
maximally
improving
performance.
Subsequent research has found that motivated young
chess players study the recommended openings of chess
games and attempt to select the best next move for par-
ticular chess positions (Charness et al., 1996, 2005; Eric-
sson et al., 1993). The latter activity meets the criteria for
purposeful practice because the move selected by a player
can be immediately compared to the best move generated
by a chess computer. The player can repeat this move
selection for many chess positions with immediate feed-
back to improve the planning processes mediating the
selection of moves.
Outline of studies
The current studies investigate the effects of gender in
SCRABBLE within the framework of the acquisition and
maintenance of expert performance. SCRABBLE was
invented relatively recently in 1931 by Alfred Butts (Na-
tional Public Radio, 2002), so there is much less knowl-
edge about the nature of effective practice compared to
other classic games with many centuries of history. In
Psychological Research
123
 contrast to chess, the domain of SCRABBLE is a recently
developed domain, and it lacks professional coaches and a
large body of written knowledge about training. SCRAB-
BLE players, therefore, must decide for themselves which
types of training activities that they think are effective for
improving their performance. Consequently, SCRABBLE
players cannot engage in deliberate practice, but only
purposeful practice and other types of practice.
There are two published studies of SCRABBLE tourna-
ment players and the relation between their performance
and practice history. Halpern and Wai (2007, Study 1)
estimated ‘‘the total number of hours the experts had prac-
ticed or played SCRABBLE’’ (p. 83) averaged 1904 h
(SD = 2532). This combined estimate of hours of practice
was significantly related to participants SCRABBLE rating
(r = 0.22, p \ 0.05), but this analysis did not evaluate the
possibility that the benefits for improving performance from
an hour of playing SCRABBLE might be different from an
hour of solitary study specifically aimed at improving
SCRABBLE skill. In an experimental study with elite and
average SCRABBLE tournament players, Tuffiash, Roring,
and Ericsson (2007) assessed separate estimates of the
amount of studying and also playing SCRABBLE per week
for every year since the start of playing SCRABBLE. For
the most recent year of playing SCRABBLE, they also
asked participants to estimate the number of hours that they
had spent in different study activities per week. Tuffiash
et al. (2007) found that elite players spent significantly more
time studying (M = 11,128 h) than the average tournament
players (M = 3696 h). The current study includes similar
data from a larger representative sample than Tuffiash et al.
(2007) to permit a more robust investigation of the effects of
playing SCRABBLE games and practice alone (study) and
their relations to gender differences. We will also control for
variables that have been shown to predict skill in past
studies such as current age, starting age, and age of the
beginning of serious play (Campitelli & Gobet, 2008;
Charness, Krampe, & Mayr, 1996).
Study 1: gender differences in SCRABBLE skill
while controlling for practice and other important
variables
With our goal of understanding the factors determining
differences between males and females’ SCRABBLE rat-
ings, we will first determine if the hypothesized gender
differences are significant. We will then evaluate whether
skill differences due to gender will be significant even after
controlling for individual differences in practice and other
background factors. At the same time using a mediation
analysis, we will test what variables explain a significant
amount of the gender differences in skill.
Procedure
Participants
During registration at the 2004 National SCRABBLE
Championship tournament, participants were offered a
survey along with an envelope with postage to allow it to
be mailed back to the investigators. Participants were told
that any received surveys would be entered into a raffle for
a prize. We received surveys from 291 participants, and a
total of 153 participants returned the survey to us. Of the
returned surveys, 14 participants did not completely fill out
the survey, and an additional six participants gave highly
implausible answers, defined as reporting over 100 h of
SCRABBLE-related activity per week or over 50 h of
tournament play weekly. We restricted the current analysis
to the remaining 133 surveys.
A subsequent analysis of the tournament listings showed
that there had been 682 participants in the tournament. An
examination of the players’ names and their pictures led to
an estimation that 319 females and 363 males had partic-
ipated. The response rate was higher among males than
females v2(1) = 7.05, p \ 0.01.
Our final sample contained 48 females and 85 males.
The sample was highly educated with the average years of
education reported being equal to 17.22 (SD = 2.94).

r(130) = -0.03,
p = 0.08 or age r(130) = 0.01, p = 0.95. Each participant
had a SCRABBLE rating, which is updated after each
tournament and derived based on prior rating and tourna-
ment performance, previously developed for chess (Elo,
1965). Means and standard deviations for all variables used
are given in Table 1.
Materials and procedures
The survey asked participants to estimate how many hours
per week they had engaged in two activities for each year
from birth to their current age as has been done in previous
studies (Ericsson et al., 1993; Charness, Tuffiash, Krampe,
Reingold, & Vasyukova, 2005). The two activities were
serious study of SCRABBLE alone, and playing SCRAB-
BLE seriously or studying SCRABBLE with others. An
estimate for the number of hours of cumulative practice
activities was calculated by multiplying the weekly esti-
mates by 52 and adding the sums for all years (Co
ˆte
´,
Ericsson, & Law, 2005; Ericsson et al., 1993). In a sub-
sequent section of the survey, participants were asked
about their current level of practice during a typical week.
They were asked about how many hours per week the past
year they engaged in several different activities (See
‘‘Appendix’’). They also completed ratings of how effort-
ful, enjoyable, and relevant to improving their skill these
Psychological Research
123
 activities were. These ratings will be examined later in this
article in the context of Study 2B. Only one item about
practice was omitted from analysis. This item asked if they
were currently taking lessons. Only 6 of 133 reported
taking lessons, and 4 of them reported durations of 1 h or
less. Finally, they were asked demographic questions about
gender, current age, age they started playing SCRABBLE,
and age they first played in a SCRABBLE tournament.
It is challenging to estimate the reliability of SCRAB-
BLE ratings at the time of the tournament. To obtain an
estimate we capitalized on the fact that there were two
segments in the competition (16 games and 15 games
respectively). The correlation between the ratings for the
two segments was r(120) = 0.84, p \ 0.001.
Plan for data analysis
First, we estimated the overall effects of gender on
SCRABBLE rating. Then we analyzed practice activities
and how to best form composite measures of them in a
hierarchical
multiple
regression—consistent
with
past
studies of purposeful and deliberate practice. The main
analysis involved a mediation analysis of the relationship
of gender and SCRABBLE ratings through the covariates
of the composite variables measuring practice, first tour-
nament age, starting age, and age. Our analysis uses the
indirect method of Preacher and Hayes (2008) which uses
the bootstrap method to calculate 95% confidence intervals
for the indirect effects.
Results
Being female was significantly negatively correlated with
SCRABBLE ratings, r(131) = -0.35, p \ 0.001 (Supple-
mentary Online Materials, Table 1, subsequently referred
to as Table SOM1), which corresponds to d = -0.74.

A complete correlation table with all variables is
reported in Table SOM1. Cumulative SCRABBLE study
alone and cumulative serious play were significantly rela-
ted to SCRABBLE ratings. Current practice activities were
described by several variables and could be best accounted
for by three variables: SCRABBLE play, general word
study (studying dictionaries and word lists), and SCRAB-
BLE-specific practice alone (anagramming and analyzing
SCRABBLE games). Our ‘‘Appendix’’ describes which
questions provided information for the three groups of
practice activities. For a validation of dividing current
activity into three variables see SOM-A1 and Table SOM2.
We also conducted a hierarchical multiple regression
analysis
predicting
SCRABBLE
ratings
(see
details
reported in SOM-A2 and Table SOM3).
Finally, we conducted a mediational analysis of the
relation between gender and SCRABBLE ratings (for
detailed results see Table 2). When all predictor variables
were tested as mediators of gender effects using the boot-
strap method (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) we found that three
variables had significant indirect effects. Age had an
indirect effect tending to diminish the effect of gender.
First tournament age had an indirect effect that tended to
increase the effect of gender. Finally, current SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone also had a significant indirect effect
whereby SCRABBLE-specific practice alone tended to
decrease the effect of gender. The set of variables included
in the analysis predicted 64% of the variance in SCRAB-
BLE rating. All variables statistically significantly related
to rating in the final model except cumulative SCRABBLE
study, including gender. It is particularly noteworthy that
the amount of current general vocabulary study negatively

 related to rating. We should note that there was no evi-
dence of a response bias in the estimates of females in
comparison to males on their time inventories. An analysis
of the two cumulative variables does not show a signifi-
cant between-subject gender difference F(1,133) B0.01,

being insignificantly higher on both.
Discussion
Our study replicated and greatly extended the findings
reported by Halpern and Wai (2007). We found a signifi-
cant difference in SCRABBLE ratings between men and
women (d = -0.74), replicating Halpern and Wai (2007)
findings of effects ranging from d = -0.26 (Study 1) to
d = -1.25 (Study 2). Halpern and Wai (2007) collected
data on the estimated life-long accumulation of hours of
SCRABBLE play and study only in Study 1. This study
found a significant correlation (r = 0.22, p \ 0.05), which
explains only 5.0% of the variance of the SCRABBLE
ratings.
One of the reasons was that our study represents prac-
tice in a much more complex way. One of the most
interesting findings of Study 1 is that the effect on
SCRABBLE skill of engagement in different study activ-
ities conducted alone differs as a function of the particular
type of activity performed alone. In fact, the hours of
studying vocabulary alone was a negative predictor of
SCRABBLE skill, whereas solitary practice analyzing
SCRABBLE games and practicing anagrams were strong
positive predictors of SCRABBLE skill.
Asking participants to report a single overall estimate
for practice alone for each year would provide a sum of
these durations, and thus could not predict attained
SCRABBLE ratings as accurately as possible. In fact,
although the cumulative amount of practice alone was
found to be correlated with SCRABBLE rating in our
sample (See Table SOM1), this variable does not predict
significant independent variance in SCRABBLE ratings as
seen in Table 3. The negative regression weight for the log-
transformed amount of general word study should not be
interpreted as an active cause of lower SCRABBLE per-
formance. In fact, the zero-order correlation between
SCRABBLE skill and log-transformed amount of general
word
study
is
not
significantly different
from
zero
r(131) = -0.09, p = 0.16. An alternate explanation of the
negative prediction of rating is that the amount of esti-
mated study time for general vocabulary serves as a sup-
pressor variable because there is a correlated bias in our
estimates of the amount of practice activity (Conger, 1974).
In this case, the general word study variable would either
be unrelated to skill acquisition, or possibly very slightly
harmful. If general word study is unrelated to skill acqui-
sition, it would still share irrelevant information with our
other practice variables. By allowing unrelated variance to
be statistically controlled, it would reveal a stronger rela-
tionship between purposeful practice and skill—closer to
their true relationship.

 Our study found large gender differences in SCRAB-
BLE skill that are comparable to Halpern and Wai (2007).
The primary goal of our study was to examine if females’
SCRABBLE skill would remain systematically lower than
the males even after controlling for all differences in
experience, practice, and career trajectories. We found that
after the statistical control of these other factors the gender
differences remained significant.
The mediation analysis shows that there are multiple
indirect effects of gender on rating. Two of the demo-
graphic variables seemed related to the gender differences
in SCRABBLE skill. The first is age, females were on
average in this sample older, and that was associated with
diminishing the gender difference. Females also began
tournament play at a later age and this difference was
associated with increased gender differences in ratings.
However, the fact that we were unable to estimate all
variance attributable to practice raises the possibility that
with more detailed data on past practice a larger portion of
the gender differences would be accounted for, perhaps all
reliable gender differences might be ultimately explained.
This is particularly possible since current SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone appears to significantly decrease the
effect of gender according to the mediation analysis.
Study 2: accounting for gender differences
by differential involvement in practice
Study 1 showed that after controlling for practice, expe-
rience,
and
starting
age,
the
effect
of
gender
on
SCRABBLE ratings was reduced from a large advantage
to a medium-sized advantage favoring males. We also
found that all of the time spent in SCRABBLE-related
activities conducted alone may have met the criteria for
purposeful practice, yet the amount of engagement in
them
differentially
influenced
attained
performance.
Consequently, if we could collect estimates of engage-
ment in particular types of practice alone, we might be
able to find that differential engagement in practice
activities by males and females might account for the
gender differences in attained SCRABBLE skill.
Without a valid body of knowledge about the differ-
ential effects of different types of practice activities for
improving SCRABBLE performance, there could be no
purposeful practice designed and guided by teachers and
coaches (cf. the definition of deliberate practice as
described in Ericsson et al. (1993) and Ericsson and Pool
(2016)). In SCRABBLE, the best available approach to
finding effective purposeful practice involves drawing
analogies from other domains of expertise. In line with
previous research on expert performance in chess and
music, we would predict a significant effect of the amount
of time spent on practice activities conducted alone.
Consistent with the hypothesis that duration of engage-
ment in practice activities designed to improve domain-
specific performance mediates skill acquisition, we found
in Study 1 that analyzing actual SCRABBLE games and
training re-arranging letter sequences into words (anagram
problem solving) were significant positive predictors of
SCRABBLE ratings. In contrast, the correlation between
vocabulary study and SCRABBLE rating was non-sig-
nificant before controlling for other variables.

 In Study 2 we asked separate questions on engagement
in each of the different types of practice-alone activities,
hypothesizing that these data would successfully account
for most of the gender differences in SCRABBLE ratings.
If this were the case, we need to be able to answer a new
question: why would females prefer to engage in practice
activities that are less effective than those engaged in by
men? We thus separated the analyses of Study 2 into two
parts. The first part focused on accounting for gender dif-
ferences in SCRABBLE ratings by differential engagement
in practice activities. The second part analyzed ratings of
different practice activities and whether any differences in
personality account for the differential preferences of
female players for engaging in effective practice activities.
Study 2A: gender and age differences in skill
with better control for practice
To test the hypothesis that differential engagement in
practice activities can account for gender differences in
attained
SCRABBLE
skill,
we
conducted
a
second
empirical study with a revised questionnaire. Study 2A
collected estimates of engagement in a more varied set of
possible SCRABBLE-related activities that could differ-
entially influence the development of skill. These activities
included SCRABBLE-specific practice alone, general word
study, and playing/studying SCRABBLE with others,
along with several other activities (see Table 4 for a
complete list with means and standard deviations). We
asked participants to recall their current engagement in this
new set of activities (as was done in Study 1 for the three
activities). We also asked them to recall their engagement
in these activities during the first year they played
SCRABBLE
and
during
the
year
of
their
highest
SCRABBLE skill (NSA rating). By averaging these three
values for each activity and multiplying the average by the
number of years they had participated in the domain, an
estimate of the cumulative amount of this activity across
their career was derived. This estimate was then given a
logarithmic-transformation before the data analysis. The
primary goal of Study 2A was to develop a method of
measuring the engagement in different types of experiences
and practice activities so we would have a rich and varied
set of factors that can predict the current level of
SCRABBLE skill. We hypothesized that this method
would permit us to develop a better set of measures of
practice activities, which would permit statistical control of
individual differences between men and women in their
engagement
in
practice
and
experience
related
to
SCRABBLE.
Methods
Participants
At the National SCRABBLE tournament in 2008 (four
years after the 2004 national tournament studied in Study
1), 260 participants were handed the questionnaire. 148
participants returned our questionnaire and were entered
into a raffle for a prize. After 26 participants’ question-
naires had been eliminated by the same criteria as in Study
1, 122 questionnaires were submitted to the analyses. The
average
age
of
this
sample
was
50.36 years
with
SD = 14.40.
The
average
starting
age
for
playing
SCRABBLE was 13.02 with SD = 8.61. The average age
at the first participation in a SCRABBLE tournament was
38.78 with SD = 12.84. Our sample contained 63 females
and 59 males. At the tournament, there were 312 females
and 350 males according to our hand coding of names and
pictures suggesting similar response rates v2(1) = 1.01,
p = 0.31. The improved response rate of women was likely
due to the third author making a more explicit effort to
recruit females given the disproportionate response rates
and gender differences noted in Study 1 and the dispro-
portionate response rates. Again the sample was highly
educated reporting 18.13 (SD = 2.91) years of education,
which again was unrelated to rating r(118) = -0.03,

Materials
The questionnaire used in Study 2A differed from the pre-
vious questionnaire used in Study 1. The current question-
naire asked about the estimated engagement in more specific
practice activities. To answer all questions about activities
for every year of their life would take a great deal of time;
consequently, participants were asked to make their esti-
mates for three time points in their careers, namely at the
current time, at the time of their highest SCRABBLE skill
rating, and the year when they started playing SCRABBLE.
To assess the relation between our new method used in
Study 2A and the traditional method eliciting retrospective
estimates of engagement in each activity for each year, we
conducted a few preparatory analyses on data from other
studies which had collected yearly estimates for every year
of participation. Based on data on practice alone in a chess
study by Charness et al. (2005), we calculated our new
measure based solely on data from 3 years: the first year of
participation, the current year, and the year of highest chess
rating during each participant’s career. Our new measure
was based on only three highly correlated estimates
[r(348) = 0.81, p \ 0.001], with the estimate based on the
aggregation of data from each year of the chess players’
careers. We also conducted an analysis of the data set from
our Study 1. There were 125 participants in Study 1 who
reported data on their best year, starting year, and current
year so we could calculate the estimates used for cumula-
tive practice alone in Study 1 and via the new method. The
correlation between the two measures was r(123) = 0.73,
p \ 0.001. The relatively high correlation between data
collected with the old method used in Study 1 and our new
method supported our decision to use the new abbreviated
method. Again information from the item of taking lessons
in SCRABBLE was omitted because only three out of 122
participants reported currently doing that and all three re-
ported less than an hour a week.
Outline for the data analysis
Our analysis follows the same general structure as the one
reported in Study 1. First we estimated the gender differ-
ences by comparing the SCRABBLE skill of males and
females without controlling for any other variables. Then,
we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to
assess the structure and relations between the large number
of variables measuring practice. The goal was to confirm
that a unitary model of practice is not appropriate, as we
argued in Study 1, and, more importantly, to identify the
most accurate measurement model possible to predict skill
from the variables measured in our dataset. Once we
identify the factor structure of our measured practice
variables, we will use a structural equation model to test
how the best practice model predicts skill and how the
demographic factors can account for SCRABBLE skill
over and above practice. Based on our findings in Study 1,
we predict that among the practice variables, only increases
in SCRABBLE-specific study alone will be associated with
increases in SCRABBLE skill, while increases in general
word study will be associated with decreases in skill. We
predict that with this more detailed description of practice
activities, experience, and career history with SCRABBLE,
the effects of gender might no longer be significant. We
will also replicate the mediation analysis using the sum
scores identified by factor analysis to assess if the pattern is
similar to that found in Study 1. Our analysis will be based
on scores summed across variables measuring the same
type of practice variables (as determined by the factor
solution from the CFA) to avoid potential issues with
known problems of indeterminacy of estimated factor
scores.
To confirm that practice is not a unitary construct, we
will run three confirmatory factor analyses. However, given
the main interest is gender differences, it is important to
have a strong measurement model as the basis for the
structural equation model. Therefore, if variables have a
low extraction (less than 0.2) after the three-factor solution,
those variables will be grouped together for an additional
factor or allowed to be independent if necessary.
Results
We first examined correlations between demographic
variables and SCRABBLE rating to assess whether the
pattern from Study 1 was replicated. The correlation
between being female and rating was -0.33 (p \ 0.01)
compared to -0.35 (p \ 0.01) in Study 1. The mean
SCRABBLE rating for males was 1410.15 (SD = 291.98)
compared
to
1215.21
(SD = 269.44)
for
females,
d = -0.69 thus replicating the earlier observed gender
differences, and again being among the largest gender
differences studied in cognitive psychology. The zero-
order correlations of the participants’ gender, SCRABBLE
ratings, first tournament age, and current age are reported
in Table SOM2. Table 4 shows the means for all variables
for both males and females.
All variables measuring practice activities and other
types of domain-related activities in SCRABBLE were
submitted to a CFA. The results from the CFA are dis-
played in Table 5 and Fig. 1. The single-factor model
assumes that all practice reflects the same construct and
had a good fit to the data by the v2/df and SRMR, while the
TLI, v 2, CFI, and RMSEA suggested an inadequate fit. The
Psychological Research
123
 two-factor model involved splitting practice into either
practice alone, on the one hand, or playing SCRABBLE
and practicing with someone else, on the other, failed to
improve on the one-factor model v2(2) = 1.40, p [ 0.05.
The three-factor model involved separating practice alone
into two types, namely SCRABBLE-specific practice alone
and general vocabulary study, and this model had a better
fit than both the two-factor model with v2(2) = 15.86,
p \ 0.001
and
the
one-factor
model
v2(4) = 18.35,
p \ 0.01. For the three-factor model, v2/df and SRMR
suggested a good fit to data, the RMSEA a moderate fit, but
the TLI, v2, and CFI suggested inadequate fit. The statis-
tically significant improvement in the model fit supports
the hypothesis that all types of practice alone do not rep-
resent the same theoretical construct. Given our main
interest is to mediate gender differences, to improve the fit
of the model, we generated a four-factor model by creating
a new variable measuring engagement in games that were
not part of actual SCRABBLE competitions, including
other word games and games against oneself. This model
also improved on the model fit over the three-factor model
v2(2) = 18.91, p \ 0.001 given a good fit for all measures
except for the TLI and CFI, which suggested some misfit.
Finally, we generated a five-factor model where playing in
a SCRABBLE tournament was considered a separate factor
because this activity differs from other types of SCRAB-
BLE play. This model also significantly improved model fit
v2(3) = 8.1, p \ 0.05 over the four-factor model and gave
good or better fit to data on all measures of model fit.
When the demographic variables were added to the five-
factor model and a structural equation model was tested
predicting skill, the resulting final model had a good fit to
the data with the v2/df and SRMR, the RMSEA a moderate
fit for the TLI, while v2 and CFI suggested an imperfect fit.
Overall,
the
fit
suggests
that
we
have
an
inter-
pretable model as shown in Table 6 (see Fig. 1). In our
final model, current SCRABBLE skill was predicted by
starting SCRABBLE at a younger age, starting SCRAB-
BLE tournament play younger, and being older. When
practice and experience are accounted for, the duration of
involvement in SCRABBLE benefits skill, whereas current
age is not associated with a decline of skill. Consistent with
the pattern observed in Study 1, SCRABBLE practice
alone positively predicted skill and general word study
negatively predicted skill; no other study variables were
significantly related to skill.
Most interestingly, our final model showed no signifi-
cant relation between gender and skill. To better under-
stand how we explained the gender effect, we examined the
partial co-variances within the model. According to this
model females were found to study SCRABBLE alone
significantly less than males (p \ 0.01), but again this did
not reflect an overall gap in domain engagement, as
females played non-tournament SCRABBLE games sig-
nificantly more (p \ 0.01) than males. Factor loadings for
this model are in Table SOM5.
Finally, the mediation analysis from Study 1 was
replicated using the variables in Study 2A. In this analysis,
to be consistent with Study 1, sum scores were generated
based on the five-factor model identified previously. This
analysis found the same pattern as in Study 1, with age
having a positive indirect effect of b = 72.43 with 95% CI
(15.90, 155.85), and where age also significantly increased
the effect of gender. Tournament age had a negative indi-
rect effect of b = -86.12 with 95% CI (-168.62, -29.99),
where first tournament age significantly accounted for the
lower SCRABBLE ratings of females. Finally, SCRAB-
BLE-specific practice alone had a significant indirect effect
b = -25.40
with
95%
CI
(-73.66,
-3.39),
where
increased SCRABBLE-specific practice alone by males
significantly accounted for the lower ratings of females.
Consistent with Study 1, no other variables were signifi-
cantly related to gender differences in performance. The
detailed results are reported in Table 6. There was no
evidence of a general response bias in the reporting of
hours in males compared to females on their time inven-
tories. An analysis of the combined gender effect of the
five practice activities shows no overall gender difference
F(1,120) = 0.64, p = 0.43 with females reporting an
insignificantly larger amount.
Discussion
When the effects of our more refined measures of experi-
ence and practice activities were statistically controlled in
Study 2A, we found no significant residual effect of

The

correlation
between
female
gender
and
SCRABBLE
skill
is
likely
attributable to less engagement in SCRABBLE-specific
practice alone over the course of the lifetime and more
engagement in other activities that give less benefit for
improving SCRABBLE skill. In Study 2A we were able to
trace the differences in types of practice during the entire
developmental career, and after statistical control for
demographic and practice variables, the residual relation to
gender was reduced to below statistical significance
(p = 0.15). It is essential to measure separately the
engagement in different practice activities during the
development of SCRABBLE skill to identify and measure
differential engagement by females and males. We did not
find any differences in overall engagement in SCRABBLE-
related activities. Both Study 1 and Study 2A found types
of activities where females are more engaged and types of
activities where males are more engaged. Of the activities
we measured, females had spent significantly more time in
three of these activities whereas males spent more time in
three of the other activities (see Table SOM4).
In Study 2A we were more able to account for the role
of estimated accumulated SCRABBLE-specific practice
than in Study 1, where the participants gave a single esti-
mate for practice alone that included both SCRABBLE-
specific practice and general vocabulary learning. We are
confident that our findings in Study 2A are consistent with
the findings from Study 1. When we regressed the accu-
mulated estimates of all types of practice alone in Study 1,

 alone was 0.12, p [ 0.05; in contrast, the corresponding
regression weights for cumulative SCRABBLE-specific
practice was 0.46, p \ 0.001 and for cumulative general
word study was -0.45, p \ 0.001. As skill increases,
players engaging in practice activities directly related to
SCRABBLE spend relatively less time building their
vocabularies, as demonstrated in both concurrent activities
in Study 1 and cumulative estimates in Study 2A. While
the factor analysis identified five different independent
factors to describe the shared variance in engagement in
many SCRABBLE-related activities, only two of these
factors were statistically significantly related directly to
SCRABBLE skill in our Study 2A model. These were the
two types of practice identified in Study 1, with general
vocabulary study (an activity that is done alone) being
negatively related to skill and SCRABBLE-specific prac-
tice alone being positively related to skill.
Study 2B: gender differences in subjective ratings
of practice activities and personality tests
Individual differences in the engagement in SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone and starting age were able to
account for all of the statistically significant differences in
SCRABBLE ratings attributable to gender in Study 2A.
The lower SCRABBLE ratings for women could be
accounted for by women’s decisions to engage more in
practice activities where increased engagement was not
related to effective improvement of SCRABBLE perfor-
mance. To better understand these differences, we analyzed
additional data collected for Study 2 in the last part of the
questionnaire. We collected data on the participants’ sub-
jective perceptions of the relevance, enjoyment, and effort
of a set of practice activities. After the questionnaire, we
asked participants to fill out several additional personality
measures that Duckworth et al. (2011) had found to be
related to purposeful practice in preparation for competi-
tions in spelling, such as Harmonious and Obsessive Pas-
sion (Vallerand et al., 2007) as well as Grit (Duckworth &
Quinn, 2009). By collecting information on all of these
additional personality characteristics, and subjective per-
ceptions of various domain-related activities, we attempted
to uncover factors that might account for gender differ-
ences in engagement in alternative types of practice
activities with differential effects on improving SCRAB-
BLE skill.
Method
Participants
Nearly all of the 122 participants in the analysis for Study
2A completed the personality tests. All but one participant
answered the Grit questionnaire and all participants
answered the Harmonious and Obsessive Passion ques-
tionnaire. All participants answered at least one question
about the relevance of each category of practice, 114

with various practice activities. Because the largest dif-
ferences between the participants answering different
questions was t = 0.25, p = 0.80 for age, and v2 \ 0.01,
p = 0.96 for gender, we felt comfortable treating the data
as having values missing at random and used multiple
imputations using 10 imputations to replace the missing
data (Scheffer, 2002).
Materials and procedures
In the last part of the questionnaire, the participants were
asked to rate a set of SCRABBLE related activities on
scales of 0–10 according to their relevance for performance
improvement, the amount of effort, and intrinsic enjoy-
ment. This type of rating has been collected in research on
deliberate practice from its beginning to provide perceived
characteristics of practice alone in music (Ericsson et al.,
1993). In Study 2A we identified the 5 latent factors dis-
tinguishing different activities. If a participant answered at
least one question for a given variable for any of the rated
activities, we then assigned that score or an average score
based on all available ratings for the associated variable.
Data analysis
The mean ratings of relevance, enjoyment, and efforts for
practice activities as a function of gender are given in the
Table SOM6, and the mean scores for the personality tests
are given in Table 7. First, we analyzed the ratings of the
practice activities with a repeated-measure ANOVA to
assess whether the ratings differed between the practice
activities. We then used hierarchical logistic regression to
identify individual differences that were related to gender.
In the final step, we conducted analyses that only included
variables as mediators that had contributed unique signifi-
cant variance to prediction of the target variables, namely
SCRABBLE skill and gender. We applied the bootstrap-
ping method (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). These variables
were examined in mediation models relating gender and
engagement in current practice activities.
Results
Analyses of subjective ratings as a function of practice
activity
In a repeated-measures ANOVA, participants’ ratings of
the relevance to improvement of different practice activi-
ties were found to differ significantly from each other
F(3.51,425.21) = 96.13, p \ 0.001. Bonferroni-corrected
post hoc testing of mean differences between all pairs of
practice activities (Table 8) showed that tournament play
was rated as significantly more relevant for improvement
than all other activities. Players rated playing SCRABBLE
as more relevant than any activity other than tournament
play. Playing other types of word games was rated as
significantly less relevant than all other activities.
The repeated-measures ANOVA of inherent enjoyment
found that practice activities differed significantly in their
rated
inherent
enjoyment
F(3.38,408.52) = 134.56,
p \ 0.001. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests of all pairs
of activities (see Table 8) showed that tournament play was
rated as more enjoyable than all other activities. Playing
SCRABBLE was rated as more enjoyable than all activities
except tournament play. Playing other types of word games
was rated as more enjoyable than SCRABBLE-specific
practice alone and general word study.
Finally, ratings of effort significantly differed for the
practice activities, F(3.42, 414.09) = 86.67, p \ 0.001.
Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests (see Table 8) showed
that tournament play was rated as more effortful than other
activities. Playing SCRABBLE was rated as more effortful
than all other activities except for tournament play.

sion analysis involving only the ratings of enjoyment
showed that females rated SCRABBLE-specific practice
alone less enjoyable than males, while they rated playing
SCRABBLE outside of tournaments more enjoyable than
males. No other effects were significant. This finding
suggests that enjoyment ratings are also relevant to dis-
criminating between males and females. The same set of
variables was used to predict SCRABBLE skill instead of
gender. Again enjoyment ratings were the only significant
predictors (See Table SOM7).

 Mediating engagement in practice as a function of gender
differences using enjoyment ratings
We hypothesize that enjoyment ratings predict both skill
and gender. However, the enjoyment of particular practice
activities should not directly change SCRABBLE skill but
instead should influence engagement in relevant practice
activities and that engagement would change performance.
If females enjoy SCRABBLE-specific practice alone less
than males (as shown in Table 9), that might explain why
they spend less time in that activity as shown in Study 1
and Study 2A. A mediational analysis of the relation
between gender and amount of accumulated SCRABBLE
play found a direct effect of gender on SCRABBLE play
(p = 0.02), where females played SCRABBLE for more
hours. The mediational analysis of the relation between
gender and hours of engagement in SCRABBLE-specific
practice alone found no direct effect of gender on the
amount of SCRABBLE-specific practice alone (p = 0.32).
However, the indirect path via enjoyment was significant
(p = 0.01), with lower values of enjoyment for females.
This satisfies the criterion for full mediation (Table 10).

 like similar to the ratings made in Study 2B. A regression
analysis predicting SCRABBLE skill from the subjective
ratings found a significant effect of ratings of enjoyment,
and ratings of enjoyment accounted for a significant
amount of variance in SCRABBLE skill (R2 = 0.07,
p \ 0.05). Better players rated SCRABBLE-specific prac-
tice alone as more enjoyable t = 2.80, p \ 0.01 and gen-
eral word study as less enjoyable t = -2.42 p = 0.02.
Ratings of enjoyment also discriminated males from
females significantly, v2 (3) = 15.21, p \ 0.01. Again,
females rated SCRABBLE-specific practice alone as less
enjoyable p \ 0.01 and rated playing SCRABBLE as more
enjoyable p = 0.02.
We also tested whether gender differences in enjoyment
of SCRABBLE-specific practice alone were related to
differences in the other ratings of SCRABBLE-specific
practice alone. Again, we found no direct effect of gender
but a significant indirect effect through enjoyment, satis-
fying the criterion for full mediation. (See Table SOM4).
Individual differences in personality and gender
There were no significant differences in Grit and Harmo-
nious Passion between the two genders (See Table 7). Only
Obsessive Passion was significantly greater for males
(M = 2.83, SD = 1.07) than for females (M = 2.39,
SD = 1.24), t(120) = 2.13, p = 0.03). As a final check we
tested if Obsessive Passion might predict the difference in
enjoyment of SCRABBLE-specific practice alone. While
in this model gender predicted passion t(120) = 2.13,
p = 0.04)
and
enjoyment
t(120) = -3.34,
p \ 0.01),
Obsessive Passion did not have a direct effect on enjoy-
ment t(120) = -1.08, p \ 0.28. Therefore, the indirect
relationship was not significant z \ 1, with bootstrap con-
fidence intervals showing a non-significant result.
Discussion
Our goal with Study 2B was to search for variables that
could explain the gender differences in engagement in
effective practice activities, namely SCRABBLE-specific
practice alone, which we previously established to be
related to the acquisition of higher SCRABBLE skill. We
followed the logic that variables that predicted gender and/
or skill would be the best candidates to mediate the
behavioral differences (which we had found in Study 2A)
to be most pivotal in accounting for the gender differences
in SCRABBLE skill.
We found that personality measures, such as Grit and
Harmonious Passion did not differ between the genders and
that Obsessive Passion was not a significant mediator of the
association between gender and enjoyment in SCRAB-
BLE-specific practice alone. Each of the personality vari-
ables significantly correlated with SCRABBLE ratings.
Grit was significantly correlated with skill r(120) = 0.22,
p = 0.02. Harmonious Passion was negatively related to
skill r(120) = -0.20, p = 0.03. Obsessive Passion was
positively related to skill r(120) = 0.20, p = 0.03. Finally,
the personality variables did not significantly predict either
skill or gender when other ratings, particularly the influ-
ential ratings of enjoyment, were statistically controlled.
Our analysis of the participants’ ratings of practice-re-
lated activities revealed surprising findings. The activity
judged by the participants to be most relevant to improving
one’s skill was playing SCRABBLE, which players rated
much more relevant than SCRABBLE-specific practice
alone. These ratings are inconsistent with the correlations
in Study 1 and Study 2A, which found that amount of
engagement in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone, but not
SCRABBLE play, correlated with SCRABBLE skill. Our
most important finding was that only the ratings of
enjoyment of SCRABBLE practice activities predicted
unique variance in gender and provided a full mediation of
the observed significant relations between gender and
amount of engagement in SCRABBLE activities, particu-
larly SCRABBLE-specific practice alone.
The most important finding of Study 2B was that the
rated subjective enjoyment of the different practice activ-
ities accounted for significant unique variance in gender
and fully mediated the relation between gender and the
engagement in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone. In
sum, the ratings of enjoyment explain the gender difference

General discussion
Our studies supported the hypothesis that individual dif-
ferences in skilled performance, at least in SCRABBLE,
attributed to gender reflect gender differences in career
history, defined by current practice, past practice, and prior
experience. We found that individual differences in
engagement in particular types of practice activities are
correlated with gender, and when these effects of practice
are statistically controlled, the gender-related effects were
reduced (Study 1) and were no longer statistically signifi-
cant (Study 2A). In Study 2B we found that gender dif-
ference
in
the
involvement
of
different
activities,
particularly
SCRABBLE-specific
practice
alone,
was
accounted for by perceived differences in enjoyment of
those activities. While males and females did not signifi-
cantly differ in their ratings of the relevance of these
activities for improving skill or their difficulty, males
reported finding them relatively more enjoyable, though
neither group found the activities particularly enjoyable
compared to other SCRABBLE-related activities. We
believe that our findings are relevant to the study of indi-
vidual differences in a large number of recreational and
professional activities, where confirmed knowledge about
practice activities that reliably improve performance is
limited or completely lacking.
Identification of practice activities that influence
the development of SCRABBLE skill
For domains with a long tradition of training with profes-
sional instructors, there is a large body of research showing
that a substantial proportion of individual differences in
skilled performance is attributable to the differences in
accumulated deliberate practice. Given that SCRABBLE
does not have this body of developed knowledge about
effective training, our study was forced to take an alter-
native and more inductive approach. Therefore, we col-
lected information on the amount of engagement during
their careers in a more diverse set of practice and play
activities conducted alone or conducted with others. Our
analyses in Study 1 showed that the amount of current
engagement in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone was
statistically significantly related to SCRABBLE skill, but
the amount of time spent playing SCRABBLE was not.
Our Study 2A showed that accumulated amount of
SCRABBLE-specific practice alone was the best predictor
of SCRABBLE ratings. The activities of SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone match the practice activities in chess
that have been found to be predictive of chess skill
(Charness et al., 2005).
Our studies provide strong converging evidence for a
basic model of skill acquisition in SCRABBLE, empha-
sizing SCRABBLE-specific practice activities alone and
deemphasizing activities designed to build general vocab-
ulary knowledge. This demonstrates that various practice
variables had very different relationships with SCRABBLE
skill ranging from positive (b = 0.46), to non-significant,
to negative (b = -0.45) after controlling for the other
practice variables. There have been recent attempts to
propose a much simplified definition of deliberate practice
as any structured domain activity (Macnamara, Hambrick,
& Oswald, 2014). In contrast, our study suggests that
purposeful practice cannot be measured by just any oper-
ationalization of practice hours, but that effective practice
is much more specific and directly related to training
activities that focus on changing aspects of the target per-
formance (Ericsson, 2016; Ericsson et al., 1993). Some
activities appear to be acting as suppressor variables with
negative regression weights, which is inconsistent with the
practice of measuring purposeful and deliberate practice by
summing up all experience in the domain as proposed by
Macnamara et al. (2014).
Study 2A offered an innovative approach for identifying
practice-related activities where the amounts of engage-
ment predicted attained skill. We collected data on many of
these activities in SCRABBLE and conducted a factor
analysis to identify different factors of co-varying levels of
engagement in practice activities across the participants’
career in the domain. Our factor analysis identified five
different types of practice activity factors, and our struc-
tural equation model showed that only the amount of
engagement in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone posi-
tively related to SCRABBLE skill. In contrast, general
vocabulary study was negatively predictive of attained
SCRABBLE skill. Study 2A also identified factors asso-
ciated
with
playing
word
games,
non-tournament
SCRABBLE play, and playing in SCRABBLE tourna-
ments. Engagement in any of these three playing activities
did not significantly correlate with attained SCRABBLE
skill. Future research is needed to confirm if these factors
are consistently identified and if they have a stable relation
or lack of relation with skill across the full range of skill.
A theoretical analysis of appropriate, purposeful prac-
tice begins with an analysis of the target performance,
namely superior performance during competition and
tournaments. By generating actions in SCRABBLE situa-
tions for which superior actions are available, it is possible
to identify cases where a given player does not find the best
actions. Either by replaying published SCRABBLE games
by elite players or consulting a SCRABBLE computer
Psychological Research
123
 program, the player can get feedback on the quality of their
move. If the selected move is not optimal, then the player
needs to review how they generated their action and
determine how they would have needed to proceed to
generate the superior actions. This described activity cor-
responds well with the variable SCRABBLE-specific
practice, for which we found that more engagement cor-
related with attained SCRABBLE skill.
In Study 2A we identified two factors related to practice
one of which helped account for gender differences in
tournament SCRABBLE. Females more frequently played
SCRABBLE outside of tournaments than males and
engaged less in SCRABBLE-specific practice alone. These
differences in time allocation were sufficient to reduce and
mediate the superior performance of males.
There are studies of individual differences in component
skills and abilities that might provide insights into the
acquisition and structure of superior performance in
SCRABBLE. Tuffiash et al. (2007) measured different
basic verbal abilities and verbal skills and showed that the
only ability that distinguished experts from non-experts
was solving anagrams (rearranging letters into words)—a
task that experts reported practicing by themselves for a
significantly longer duration than non-experts. Recently,
Hargreaves, Pexman, Zdrazilova, and Sargious (2011)
found that the superior verbal fluency of expert SCRAB-
BLE players was only observed for tasks related to
SCRABBLE.
How can differences in engagement in different
types of practice activities be explained
There are several different approaches to account for
individual differences in engagement in practice activities.
One approach is to collect data on how different partici-
pants perceive their practice activities regarding their rel-
evance for improvement, the amount of effort required, and
the amount of inherent enjoyment of those activities. An
alternative approach is to search for correlations with dif-
ferences in general personality traits. We collected data on
three personality measures: Grit, Harmonious Passion, and
Obsessive Passion. Our analysis found that the variables
which uniquely explained variance in SCRABBLE skill
involved perceptions of enjoyment of two types of practice
activities, including the key variable of SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone. In fact, enjoyment of SCRABBLE-
specific practice alone fully mediated the gender differ-
ences in that activity.
Pinker’s (2008) general argument that males put more
obsessive focus into their careers and competitive domains
might explain males higher involvement than females in
the more effective learning activities. This argument is also
consistent with significantly higher Obsessive Passion
scores of males compared to females. One problem with an
account based on competitiveness is that we are not sure
how to objectively measure competitiveness. The studies
mentioned in the introduction experimentally manipulated
competitive vs non-competitive situations, but SCRAB-
BLE rating is based only on competitive situations. The
closest objective measure we can think of is how often one
plays SCRABBLE, and it is interesting that in Study 1
females engaged in statistically significantly more current
SCRABBLE play (Table SOM1) while in Study 2A, there
were no differences in the amount of tournament play. The
only statistically significant differences we found in terms
of reaction to competitive situations were that males
reported Tournaments being more effortful while females
reported playing SCRABBLE was more enjoyable. This
could reflect a different approach to competition/playing
SCRABBLE that might warrant further investigation.
Generalizations of our study’s findings to other
fields
Differences
between
genders
are
observed
in
some
domains with expert performance, but not others. One
domain without consistent gender effects is music. The
domain of music is a domain with a very long history of
training with developed curricula and professional teachers
who start supervising training at a very young age. Ericsson
et al.’s (1993) study of violinists found that all three groups
of students at a music academy engaged in supervised
practice, meeting the criteria for deliberate practice. In that
domain, all groups had started practice at young ages—
around age seven. All groups rated the relevance of prac-
tice alone as the most beneficial activity for improving
skill. There is a significant body of knowledge about how
to best improve at chess as well, and relatively few pro-
fessional teachers who start supervising practice at more
advanced levels with older players. In studies of the
acquisition of expert performance in chess, Charness et al.
(2005) found a stronger relation between chess skill and the
age at the beginning of serious play than at the age of
starting in the domain. Additionally, they found generally
non-significant, positive effects of tournament play across
different samples and types of samples. Most importantly,
Charness et al. (2005) found evidence for an independent
effect of engagement in purposeful practice for chess skill,
even after controlling for other types of practice activities.
Gobet and Campitelli (2007) also found that the amount of
group practice (defined as playing chess, working with a
tutor, or studying with another person) was a strong pre-
dictor of attained skill. When tournament chess players
rated the relevance of different practice activities, Charness
et al. (1996) found the average rating for analysis of games
alone to be high (5.9 on a seven-point scale), whereas
Psychological Research
123
 relevance of playing chess games outside tournaments and
against chess computers was low, 3.6 and 3.2, respectively.
Even more interesting, Charness et al. (1996) found that the
ratings for the relevance of analyzing games alone were
significantly
correlated
with
chess
ratings positively,
whereas the ratings for the relevance of playing games
were significantly negatively related. The relevance ratings
show that the more skilled chess players knew which
activities were associated with improved performance. In
the recently established domain of SCRABBLE, we found
hardly any evidence that players were able to accurately
judge the relevance of different practice activities for
improving performance. The players even rated playing
SCRABBLE games outside tournaments as being more
relevant than SCRABBLE-specific practice alone.
Gender differences in the amount of deliberate and
purposeful practice have also been found in research on
runners, where more men are distance runners, and male
runners train more than female runners (Deaner, 2013). For
instance, Ceci and Williams (2010) argue that the most
important cause of the difference in professional outcomes
is different preferences by women. Our studies have pre-
sented significant evidence that differences in performance
between females and males are related to differences in the
amount of engagement in particular types of practice
activities, and that those differences in engagement in
practice activities are related to differences in rated
enjoyment of those activities. With our current evidence,
we can only speculate about the causes of the difference in
rated enjoyment of deliberate and purposeful practice.
Limitations
There are a few important limitations to our studies. The
most significant limitation concerns the correlational nature
of the study. We cannot make statements about correlations
with variables that we did not measure, including tests of
basic abilities and other practice activities. In spite of our
efforts to describe practice activities in SCRABBLE in more
detail than previous research, there are several weaknesses in
our use of retrospective reports of practice. It would, there-
fore, be significant to start collecting longitudinal informa-
tion about players’ training. In a longitudinal study it would
be possible to collect detailed diaries of SCRABBLE-related
practice and perhaps discover other types of effective train-
ing activities. One potential problem with longitudinal
studies is that training activities in new domains, such as
SCRABBLE, may change over time as the domain matures
and prize money is increased. For example, it is possible that
individual tutoring may become more common and the
amount of tutoring may become an important predictor of
individual differences in performance.
Our study did not have our participants take tests of
basic ability and intelligence, which merits discussion.
Both Study 1 and Study 2 involved concurrence with
experimental
research
on
a
smaller
subsample
of
SCRABBLE players. Tuffiash et al. (2007) reported the
results of the intensive study of the subsample, which was
collected concurrently with Study 1. The corresponding
data from the subsample examined in Study 2 have not yet
been published. The general findings reported by Tuffiash
et al. (2007) were that abilities predictive of SCRABBLE
performance were closely related to SCRABBLE perfor-
mance. These findings have been supported by Hargreaves
et al. (2011), and in a recent neurological study by van
Hees et al. (2016) where activities that are directly related
to SCRABBLE show large differences as a function
SCRABBLE skill, but other abilities or activities show
very few significant relationships.
It is reasonable to speculate if the gender difference in
SCRABBLE skill could be explained by differences in
basic abilities. A compelling account of these differences
regarding basic abilities would need to show a strong
correlation between these abilities and SCRABBLE skill,
ideally even within each gender. There are very few cog-
nitive differences between females and males (Hyde,
2005). A very recent meta-synthesis found the average
absolute value of cognitive gender difference is d = 0.22
with the biggest difference concerned mental rotation with
d = -0.57 (favoring males) (Zell, Krizan, & Teeter,
2015). It is noteworthy that the gender differences observed
in both our studies (-0.74 and -0.69) were numerically
larger than any cognitive ability identified in the meta-
synthesis. Spatial skills such as mental rotation seem to be
a leading candidate because it shows consistent large
gender differences in the population. In addition, Halpern
and Wai (2007) reported significant correlation with
SCRABBLE performance in their study. It should be noted
though that if we statistically control for gender in the
paper-folding task based on correlations reported by Hal-
pern and Wai (2007), paper folding is no longer signifi-
cantly related to rating (p = 0.053). On the other hand, if
we control for performance on the paper-folding task, the
correlations between gender and SCRABBLE rating is still
significant
(p \ 0.001).
Duffy,
Ericsson,
and
Baluch
(2007) similarly found that height, reach and gender were
correlated with performance on darts. However, when
gender was statistically controlled, height and reach were
not significantly related to dart performance, yet when
controlling for height and reach the relation between gen-
der and dart performance remained highly significant. Both
of these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the
developmental history involving training differs between
genders and is a more likely source of the performance
differences than these gender differences in height or
Psychological Research
123
 paper-folding performance. Only future research will be
able to provide deeper insights concerning if and how
individual differences in basic abilities and attributes
between males and females influence the acquisition of
SCRABBLE performance.
Future directions
Our Study 2B found that both males and females are acting
quite rationally given how they reported their perception of
the relevance of different types of practice for improved
performance in SCRABBLE. We found that enjoyment
was the main driver of gender differences in practice
behavior. Future research might include experimental
interventions attempting to change the perceptions of rel-
evance and examine if such changes will change ratings of
enjoyment and most importantly their engagement in the
beneficial practice activities and ultimately associated
increases in their performance during SCRABBLE tour-
naments. A more ambitious goal would be to promote the
accumulation of knowledge about how SCRABBLE skill
can be effectively trained under the supervision of qualified
teachers (c.f. deliberate practice, Ericsson et al., 1993;
Ericsson & Pool, 2016).
Another interesting direction would be to study other
domains of expertise, where valid knowledge has not yet
been developed about how individualized training with
teachers can lead to high levels of performance. It is pos-
sible that such an approach might be useful when
researchers study the extended preparation of engineers
and scientists in STEM fields. Any intervention that helps a
person come closer to maximizing their potential must
obviously be offered to males as well, and there is no
guarantee that, for instance, informing people of the ben-
efits of fully concentrated study with opportunities to
feedback will increase the amount of purposeful practice
by females more than males.
Conclusion
Research on SCRABBLE may provide us with insights and
hypotheses about causes of gender differences in profes-
sional domains where measurement of performance is
based nearly exclusively on subjective evaluations by
supervisors and managers. This paper shows that a gender
gap can arise in a domain with very few barriers to entry
and where the common expectation is that women should
prosper,
as
Halpern
et
al.
(2011) demonstrated
for
SCRABBLE. We believe that domains of reproducibly
superior expertise that exhibit a gender gap offer unique
opportunities to study with objective measures how
preferences, personality and, in our opinion most impor-
tantly, behavioral differences in the engagement in effec-
tive practice activities can produce a gender gap. We are
excited about the possibility to study if and how prefer-
ences for engaging in effective practice can be influenced
experimentally and if experimental manipulation can lead
to increased long-term engagement in particular types of
effective practice activities, which we hypothesize would
lead to associated improvements in performance.
We have reviewed evidence supporting the claim that
females and males gain roughly equivalent benefits from
domain activities in SCRABBLE and are roughly equiva-
lently able to succeed in the domain. The domain of
SCRABBLE is likely similar to other domains of expertise
where experts acquire unique domain-specific representa-
tions and cognitive processes (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995).
At this time, we have not found evidence for gender dif-
ferences in the basic ability to acquire those representa-
tions. Therefore, we have proposed how large gender
differences can be attributed to differences in the methods
of skill acquisition as opposed to the capacity for skill
acquisition or the rates of skill acquisition. We found that
those differences appear to be due to preferences for
engaging in certain types of domain-related activities.
Future research is required to understand how these pref-
erences originate, and most importantly, how those pref-
erences can be changed by interventions.
