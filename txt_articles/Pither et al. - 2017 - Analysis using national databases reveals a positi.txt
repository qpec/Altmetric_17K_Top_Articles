Abstract
In recent years, dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have increased in parallel to sed-
entary behavior and diabetes across the world. To test any putative association between
dietary PUFA and sedentary behavior or diabetes in females, we obtained country-specific,
cross-sectional data on sedentary activity and diabetes prevalence from European Cardio-
vascular Statistics 2012. Age and gender-specific, nutritional data from each country were
obtained from nutritional surveys as well. Socioeconomic (GDP), physical environment
(urbanization index) and climatic confounders were accounted for each country. Upon analy-
sis, we found a strong, positive association between sedentary lifestyle in 11-yr old girls
(> = 2 hours of TV/ weekday) and dietary PUFA across 21 European countries. Further, a
weak association of dietary PUFA and a strong relationship of per-capita GDP was estab-
lished with elevated fasting blood glucose [(> = 7.0 mmol/L; or on medication] among 25+ year
old adult females across 23 countries in Europe. In summary, we present novel ecological evi-
dence that dietary PUFA is strongly associated with sedentary behavior among pre-teen girls
and weakly associated with diabetes among adult women across Europe. In the latter group,
per-capita GDP was a significant predictor for diabetes as well. Therefore, we recommend
that prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) be implemented to evaluate if ubiquitous
presence of dietary PUFA and low socioeconomic status are possible confounders when inter-
vening to treat/prevent sedentary lifestyle or diabetes in female subjects in Western nations.
Introduction
Observational studies have suggested that an improper diet and sedentary behaviour are inde-
pendent risk factors for chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [1,
2]. However, the inter-relationship between diet and physical activity, if any remains unclear.
Traditionally, spontaneous physical activity is recognized to be a function of either total caloric
intake or the overall macronutrient composition of the diet [3]. However, whether the chemi-
cal type of macronutrients alter physical activity remains unknown.

 We reported recently that in Canada, increases in dietary fat between the 1970’s and 2000’s
are attributable to increased consumption of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA) but not saturated fatty acids (SFA) [4]. Indeed, to protect against cardiovas-
cular diseases, SFA has been deliberately removed from our food supply in favour of MUFA
and PUFA [5–7]. In a recent worldwide survey of dietary fat intakes between 1990 and 2010,
both North America and parts of Europe demonstrate a higher intake of PUFAs whereas satu-
rated fat intakes remained similar [7]. In this time frame, USA demonstrated a 318% increase
of its diabetic population from 6.5 million to 20.7 million patients [8] and European diabetes
rates also increased [9, 10]. The incidence of diabetes in the Western population was indeed
paralleled by also a rise in sedentary behavior. North American children and youth spend
between 40–60% of their waking hours in sedentary pastimes like TV watching, video games
etc. [11, 12]. In a recent European study, a third of the children across eight nations in the IDE-
FICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children
and infants) survey, demonstrated increased sedentary behavior which correlated the most
with increased TV watching as an indicator [13]. Is it possible that sedentary behaviour is
caused by dietary unsaturated fats? Indeed, 4–8 yr old children in USA and Canada increas-
ingly consume a diet rich in unsaturated fats [14, 15]. Most recently, we also showed that even
sources of saturated fats like butter which are preferred at a younger age in the Western world,
now have increasing n-6 PUFA [16]. Therefore, we hypothesized a possible biological link
between unsaturated fat diets and rising sedentary behaviour and diabetes.
With its genetically concordant yet nutritionally diverse population [17], the European
region provides a more suitable setting to test for such associations. In Europe, populations
demonstrate varied PUFA and MUFA intakes. Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Italy
and Spain have higher MUFA intakes through olive oil [18], whereas n-6 PUFA consumption
in Central and Eastern European countries are the highest [19]. Nevertheless, even in the
European context, the relationship between dietary MUFA, PUFA and metabolic outcomes
such as diabetes, remains unclear. For example: (i) in a mixed sex population in England,
administration of MUFA or PUFA rich diet for 24 days did not influence insulin sensitivity in
type 2 diabetic subjects [20], whereas (ii) a study from Spain involving insulin-resistant females
reported the opposite finding [21]. Furthermore, in earlier studies, (iii) high n-6 PUFA was
positively associated with insulin resistance in the Israeli population [22], whereas (iv) MUFA
was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in Spanish women [23]. In contrast, (v) in a recent
study, 6-week MUFA diet in a healthy Portugese population did not demonstrate any changes
in biomarkers of diabetes [24].
Controlling for confounders like urbanization, per-capita GDP or climatic variables which
alter physical activity levels in humans, we show that sedentary behaviour in pre-teen girls in
Europe is significantly associated with PUFA intakes. With respect to adult European women,
despite PUFA intakes demonstrating an association, per-capita GDP emerged as the only sig-
nificant predictor for elevated blood glucose. We suggest that more attention be paid to dietary
PUFA and socioeconomic status as potential confounders, when planning lifestyle interven-
tions to treat/correct sedentary behaviour and diabetes, at least in female subjects.
Methods
Sedentary behaviour, PUFA intakes and weight gain in European
children
While the biological effects of MUFA is gender-neutral, a clear sex difference exists with the
metabolic effects of PUFA in vivo. PUFA desaturation and bioconversion to carcinogenic
eicosanoids as well as its oxidative modification is higher in females [25]. Consistent with this

 notion, reports have linked countries with high PUFA intakes like Israel and the USA, with a
high rate of female cancers [26, 27]. In basic research, we also demonstrated significant loss of
spontaneous activity and elevated insulin resistance in mice fed PUFA diets irrespective of
either total food intake or body weight [4]. Therefore, we focussed our analysis to the female
sex, taking advantage of published data concerning European females from across Europe.
TV watching (screen time) is a prime, universal indicator for sedentary behaviour in pre-
teens and adolescents [28, 29], especially in Europe [13]. Among adolescents, sedentary behav-
iour and screen time increases with age [30]. According to a recent analysis of 161 studies,
there was an increase of 30 mins of sedentary behavior with each increasing year among ado-
lescents [31]. Because we wanted to see biological effects of diet and not age, we evaluated TV
watching data on the youngest females (i.e. 11 years) reported in the European Cardiovascular
Statistics 2012 database (https://www.escardio.org/static_file/Escardio/Press-media/press-
releases/2013/EU-cardiovascular-disease-statistics-2012.pdf).
A pre-teen age group has the added advantage of being shielded from a well-known effect
of advancing age on loss of physical activity among older adolescents or adults [32]. Moreover
as girls also rapidly lower their physical activity levels as they age, biological differences due to
dietary variations could be lost in girls in a higher age group, even as early as 13 years [33].
Data about national sedentary behaviour patterns (Table 6.5 in [34]) and prevalence of
overweight/obesity (Table 10.3 in [34]) among 11 yr old female children were obtained from
the most recent version of European Cardiovascular Statistics 2012 [34]. We used 2009/10 data
for TV watching, except for Bulgaria and Italy, for which 2009/10 values were missing, but
2005/06 values were provided. For these two countries, we predicted 2009/10 values based on a
highly significant model-II regression relating 2009/10 values to 2005/06 values for the other
19 countries; the regression R-square was 0.80, and had slope and intercept estimates of 0.929
(95% confidence limits: 0.73, 1.17) and 0.325, respectively.
Estimates of sex-specific PUFA and MUFA intakes were obtained from a comprehensive
report of nutritional intakes in European children [35]. The report assessed both macro and
micronutrient analysis as obtained from both local and national surveys and opinions among
experts across Europe. The surveys included in the study had to be a) published, b) based on
individual dietary intakes, c) with adequate information available to evaluate its accuracy, d)
obtained after 1987, e) with a narrow age window to provide age and sex-specific data, f) of a
sample size of at least 25, representative of the national population. MUFA and PUFA intake
data in female children was obtained from twenty-one such surveys across various ages across
Europe (page S175 and S176 for MUFA and PUFA data respectively in [35]). Sedentary behav-
ior, prevalence of overweight/obesity and nutritional data for female children across Europe
are also summarized in Table 1.
Diabetes, PUFA intakes and weight gain in European women
Insulin resistance can be undetected for years before it turns into overt diabetes. Thus, to gain
insights regarding the incidence of diabetes from epidemiological data, we used data about the
prevalence of elevated blood glucose in adult females (25+ yrs old). Similar to pre-teen female
data, data about prevalence of elevated glucose across Europe (page 113, Table 11.2 in [34]),
and prevalence of female obesity (page 104, Table 10.1 in [34]) were obtained from the Euro-
pean Cardiovascular Statistics 2012. Estimates of sex-specific adult intakes of total fat, MUFA
or PUFA [page 232, Table 1 in [36]] in adults were obtained from a recent report providing
dietary FA intakes among inviduals above 18 years of age across the world [36]. Sample size of
respondents from each country on MUFA or PUFA intakes were also obtained from the same
table. Data describing the mean dietary fat composition, incidence of obesity and elevated

are presented in Table 2.
Socioeconomic and geographical confounds
The relationship between dietary fats and physical activity in humans is potentially con-
founded by socioeconomic [37], built environment (such as urbanization [38]) and climatic
(e.g. sunlight hours, mean temperature [39]) factors. Moreover, restricting analyses to a single
population may encompass little variation, thereby limiting power of such analysis. As an
example, in North America, where intake of PUFA is extensive [36], the lack of a control popu-
lation consuming less PUFA may hide a specific effect of PUFA on physical activity. In con-
trast, Europe provides a suitable system for conducting analysis of such relationships because:
(i) European populations are among the most genetically homogenous in the world [17]; (ii)
detailed and extensive data about diet and disease are available for many European countries
(see below); (iii) dietary PUFA and MUFA intakes vary considerably among European coun-
tries, and (iv) so too do socioeconomic indicators and climate. Level of urbanization and asso-
ciated physical environments, which can deter or encourage physical activity through access to
parks, open spaces and use of non-motorized transport wasincluded as a confounding variable

 in our analyses. We did so using the urbanization index of the countries, as published by the
United Nations World Urbanization Prospectus 2011 Revision, which describes the percent-
age of the total population living in urban areas. Average physical activity has been associated
with the average affluence of a nation [37]. To account for this confounder, per capita GDP
data were obtained from the 2011 World Bank data in US dollars.
Physical activity has also been associated with a variety of climate and weather-related vari-
ables [40]. Wikipedia, which reports data from country-specific meteorological organizations,
was the source for the following climate variables, corresponding to countries’ capital cities:
their latitudes, average annual sunshine hours, the average July daily maximum temperatures,
and mean annual temperature, which is now depicted in S1 Fig. Data for each European coun-
try are summarized in Table 3.
Statistical analyses
Data regarding children and women were analyzed separately. All analyses were conducted
using R package [41]. We used a Bonferroni adjustement when conducting multiple tests. Pair-
wise associations between all variables were visually assessed using scatterplots, and were sta-
tistically evaluated using Spearman (rank) correlation. For each response variable of interest,

 we conducted multiple regressions, each time including per-capita GDP, climate variables,
and urbanization index as confounders, and MUFA and PUFA as predictors of interest [42].
With N between 21 and 23 countries (depending on analysis), we (i) used latitude as a single
proxy for climate variables, as it was strongly correlated with each of mean annual tempera-
ture, maximum July temperature, and annual hours of sunlight (S1 Fig), and (ii) excluded
MUFA as a predictor variable as initial Spearman’s correlation analyses revealed no associa-
tions with any of the other variables of interest. This strategy further served to increase sample
size and thus power, because some countries were missing MUFA data (Table 1).
For the analyses of adult data, the dietary report provides sample sizes associated with esti-
mates of MUFA and PUFA intakes [36]. As these sample sizes varied considerably among
countries (from 434 in the UK to 20942 in Greece), we conducted weighted regressions, with
log-transformed sample sizes providing the weighting factor. Regression assumptions were
assessed via standard residual diagnostics.

 intake was not correlated with any variables. Prevalence of overweight/obesity among Euro-
pean 11-year-old girls was negatively associated with the latitude of the country’s capital city at
the unadjusted alpha level (Spearman rho = –0.45, N = 20; P = 0.045), but not with any other
variables (Fig 1).
After accounting for confounders, mean PUFA intake was found to be a highly significant
predictor of sedentary behaviour among European 11-year-old girls (Fig 2A; Table 4). On
average, for every percentage increase in PUFA, and holding all other variables constant, there
was a predicted increase of 3.95% in the prevalence of sedentary behaviour (90% confidence

 limits: 2.25, 5.53). In a least-squares regression that includes only mean PUFA intake as a pre-
dictor (thus not accounting for potential confounders), a remarkable 50% of the variation inse-
dentary behaviour is accounted for (Fig 2B; regression intercept and slope: 30.71 and 3.93,
respectively; F1,19 = 21.35, P = 0.002).
In our model of prevalence of overweight among European 11-year-old girls, latitude of the
capital city of a country was a significant negative predictor (P = 0.02), though the overall mul-
tiple regression was not significant (Table 4): On average, for every degree increase in latitude
of the capital city, and holding all other variables constant, there was a predicted decrease of
0.63% in the prevalence of overweight (90% confidence limits: –1.20, –0.21). Such effects of lat-

 Blood glucose in adult European females and dietary PUFA
Among 25+ year old women, we found that raised fasting blood glucose (> = 7.0 mmol/L) or
on medication was positively associated with adult PUFA intakes (Fig 3; Spearman rho = 0.44;
N = 23;P = 0.037), but this association was not significant at our Bonferroni-adjusted alpha
level of � 0.005. Nevertheless, given our limited sample size (N = 23 countries), we consider
this finding noteworthy. Prevalence of obesity among 25+ year old European women was not
significantly associated with any of the covariates (Fig 3).

 In the multiple regression analyses, residual diagnostics revealed Norway to be a strong out-
lier (due to its extremely high per capita GDP; Table 3), so it was excluded from subsequent
analyses. Conclusions were qualitatively identical with it included. Per-capita GDP was a sig-
nificant negative predictor of raised fasting blood glucose (> = 7.0 mmol/L) or on medication
in adult women. On average, for every $1000 (USD) increase in per-capita GDP, and holding
all other variables constant, there was a predicted decrease of 0.08% in the prevalence of raised
glucose (90% confidence limits: –0.120, –0.009) (Table 5). Lastly, as observed in our analyses
of children data, none of the variables tested were significant predictors of obesity among
women (Table 5).
Discussion
Over the last 40 years, a synergistic effect of improper diet and lack of physical activity has
been blamed for the rapid rise in various chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and cancer [1].
A high fat diet and sedentary behaviour is considered obesogenic and detrimental. However,
the literature remains divided over their inter-relationship. Contrary to common belief, higher
caloric intake either does not influence or induces higher spontaneous activity in rodents [43].
In lean humans, excess energy provision is also balanced by increased spontaneous activity
and thermogenesis, at least in the short-term [3]. It is increasingly recognized that a low carbo-
hydrate diet (i.e. high in fat) has either no effect on type 2 diabetes in women or is actually ben-
eficial [44–46]. Therefore, rather than total fat, the fat composition of a diet may be vital in
influencing sedentary behaviour and diabetes in women.
Besides PUFA and MUFA intakes, in our analyses, we incorporated data from European
countries with varied climate (Italy vs. Norway), urbanization (Slovenia vs. England), per-cap-
ita GDP (Bulgaria vs.Germany) and geography (Austria vs. Spain). We first demonstrate that
sedentary behaviour among 11 year old European female children is significantly positively
associated with mean PUFA intakes, after controlling for the significant negative effect of per-
capita GDP. Although the underlying biological causes are not clear, there is considerable evi-
dence of clinical depression in women with a high n-6 PUFA diet [47]. Interestingly, depres-
sion in teen females is strongly associated with 2 or more hours of TV watching behavior as
well [48]. Most recently, we demonstrated that a high n-6 PUFA but not MUFA rich diet,

 promotes loss of spontaneous activity and insulin resistance in mice [4]. Most interestingly, it
has been demonstrated that muscle phospholipid n-6 PUFA content increases with a sedentary
profile even in healthy humans [49].
Although sedentary activity data was available, data on diabetes in 11 year was unavailable
as insulin or blood glucose values are not usually measured in this age group. As sedentary
behavior can be a factor in causing diabetes, we evaluated the incidence of elevated blood glu-
cose in 25+yr old adult females from across Europe. In Spearman’s rank correlation analysis,
we found evidence of a positive association between the prevalence of elevated glucose in adult
females with reported adult PUFA intakes (Fig 2), but given the limited sample size, this asso-
ciation was not significant at our stringent Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level (0.005). Following
multiple regression analysis, per-capita GDP emerged as the sole significant predictor of the
incidence of elevated glucose in adult females. Socioeconomic status can be a strong predictor
of diabetes, and this relationship is stronger for women than in men [50–52]. The probable
causes identified involve chronic stress, smoking, poor housing conditions, lack of exercise
and education, all of which are related to worsening metabolic profiles. It is also known that
low socioeconomic status encourages consumption of cheaper vegetable oils containing high
PUFA [53]. In contrast, a direct relationship between breast milk MUFA and higher socioeco-
nomic status is also known [54].
Interestingly, in both young girls and adult women, neither sedentary behaviour nor ele-
vated blood glucose could be associated with the incidence of overweight/ obesity in the popu-
lation. Despite common perceptions, the relationship between sedentary behavior and obesity
is not straight forward in children and adolescents as extensively reviewed earlier [28, 55]. The
link between media time and BMI is weak at best in this particular age group. With regards to
our analysis, an age of 11 years can also be an insufficient time biologically to accumulate body
fat in pre-teen females, even in those with an increased screen time. With respect to adult 25
+ yr old females, there is extensive under reporting of obesity in self-report surveys which
could have prevented detection of an association [56]. Moreover, with respect to diabetes, it
has been known for quite some time that the relationship of adiposity to insulin resistance is
confounded in the female sex during reproductive years due to the protective effects of sex
hormones [57]. Unfortunately, we feel that the same hormones that prevent against insulin
resistance due to general adiposity, often leads to detrimental effects of PUFA specifically by
enhancing its bioconversion [25].
PUFA subtypes like n-3 or n-6 PUFAs were not discriminated in our study due to the lack
of such differentiations in our databases. At least in the US and most Western nations, both n-
3 and n-6 PUFA appear to have increased in recent years with increasing use of vegetable oils
like soybean (n-6 and n-3 PUFA at 10 and 50% of total fatty acids) and canola (n-6 and n-3
PUFA at 9 and 21% of total fatty acids) [6, 7]. In a 2015 study, dietary n-3 PUFA was identified
as a causative factor for lowering physical activity during class time in iron-deficient South
African school children aged 6–11 years, which could not be reversed following iron supple-
mentation [58]. A recent meta-analysis reports that n-3 PUFA supplementation might be
related to lowering of aggression in humans which deters spontaneous activity as well [59].
In parallel, dietary n-6 PUFA has been linked to a loss of physical activity in an aged Italian
cohort [60]. Regarding diabetes, an example at the population level is illustrated by India. In
2000, there were 31.7 million diabetic cases in India which doubled to more than 62 million
individuals within a decade [61]. However, in a national study on the prevalence of diabetes
between 1972–1975 involving 35,000 Indians above 14 years of age, diabetes prevalence was
only 1.5–2.1% of the population surveyed [62]. Currently, in cities like Kolkata, India, 11.6%
of the population suffers from diabetes [61]. It has been speculated for a long time that the ris-
ing incidence of diabetes in India is linked to a ’switch’ to unsaturated vegetable oils from

 traditional tropical, saturated oils [63, 64]. In a recent survey involving 27,012 South Indians
who traditionally used palm and coconut oils (rich in saturated fats, 9% PUFA) as the chief
cooking medium, introduction of sunflower oil (~70% PUFA) was identified as the major
cause for developing metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia
[65].
Study limitations
As with any ecological study, associations established using population-level data do not neces-
sarily reflect any causality. In a perfect world, prospective, individual level data from the same
year would be obtainable from the entire European cohort in both nutritional intake and sed-
entary behaviour patterns, which would lead to definitive answers to our question. However,
rarely do any one nutritional or behavioral survey cross national boundaries, much less in
the same or similar years. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to find associations
between PUFA or MUFA intakes and rising sedentary behaviour or diabetes in European pop-
ulations. To avoid any potential bias on our part, we used a single published database of nutri-
ent intake both for adult [36] and children [35]. These are the most up to date, comprehensive
nationwide databases available for these age groups available currently. We also used a single
database i.e. the European Cardiovascular Statistics database 2012 [22] for sedentary behaviour
and blood glucose data.
Overall, this study provides evidence for a positive ecological association between excess
dietary PUFA intake across Europe with sedentary behaviour among female children and mar-
ginal associations with elevated blood glucose in adult females. A negative association between
PUFA intake and per-capita GDP in adult females was also established in this analysis. Consid-
ering all confounders, lower per-capita GDP emerged as the strongest predictor for diabetes in
adult females. In light of such results, we call for prospective RCTs evaluating a possible link of
dietary PUFA and socioeconomic status on inducing sedentary behaviour and insulin resis-
tance in female subjects.
