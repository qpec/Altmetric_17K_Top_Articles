Fetoplacental glucocorticoid overexposure is a significant mecha-
nism underlying fetal growth restriction and the programming of
adverse health outcomes in the adult. Placental glucocorticoid
inactivation by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-
HSD2) plays a key role. We previously discovered that Hsd11b2−/−
mice, lacking 11β-HSD2, show marked underdevelopment of the
placental vasculature. We now explore the consequences for fetal
cardiovascular development and whether this is reversible. We
studied Hsd11b2+/+, Hsd11b2+/−, and Hsd11b2−/− littermates from
heterozygous (Hsd11b+/−) matings at embryonic day (E)14.5 and
E17.5, where all three genotypes were present to control for ma-
ternal effects. Using high-resolution ultrasound, we found that
umbilical vein blood velocity in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses did not un-
dergo the normal gestational increase seen in Hsd11b2+/+ litter-
mates. Similarly, the resistance index in the umbilical artery did
not show the normal gestational decline. Surprisingly, given that
11β-HSD2 absence is predicted to initiate early maturation, the E/A
wave ratio was reduced at E17.5 in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, suggesting
impaired cardiac function. Pravastatin administration from E6.5,
which increases placental vascular endothelial growth factor A and,
thus, vascularization, increased placental fetal capillary volume, ame-
liorated the aberrant umbilical cord velocity, normalized fetal weight,
and improved the cardiac function of Hsd11b2−/− fetuses. This im-
proved cardiac function occurred despite persisting indications of in-
creased glucocorticoid exposure in the Hsd11b2−/− fetal heart. Thus,
the pravastatin-induced enhancement of fetal capillaries within
the placenta and the resultant hemodynamic changes correspond
with restored fetal cardiac function. Statins may represent a useful
therapeutic approach to intrauterine growth retardation due to
placental vascular hypofunction.
placenta | 11β-HSD2 | glucocorticoids | fetal heart | developmental
programming
L
ow birth weight is associated with an increased risk of car-
diometabolic disorders in adulthood (1). Frequently underlying
this association is elevated fetal exposure to “stress hormones”—
glucocorticoids. Endogenous glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans,
corticosterone in rodents) are a key signal in late gestation, which
alter developmental trajectories of fetal tissues, predominantly from a
proliferative to differentiated state, in preparation for extrauterine life
(2). Fetal overexposure to glucocorticoids in humans, primates, and
rodents is detrimental for placental and fetal growth and develop-
ment, and “programs” higher risk of cardiometabolic disease in later
life (3–8). Recent data suggest that the detrimental effects of excess
glucocorticoids on fetal growth and development result from direct
glucocorticoid actions on the placenta and on the fetus itself (9, 10).
The fetus and the placenta are maintained in a low gluco-
corticoid environment by the abundant expression of fetopla-
cental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), an
enzyme that inactivates the much higher levels of glucocorticoids
arriving from the maternal circulation (11, 12). In humans and in
animal models, placental 11β-HSD2 expression is reduced in
adverse situations, including poor maternal nutrition or maternal
stress (13–15). Bypass of this protective enzyme, be it through
synthetic glucocorticoids that are poor substrates (9, 16), in-
hibition (by liquorice), or genetic ablation of Hsd11b2 that en-
codes 11β-HSD2 (10), reduces placental weight. This bypass is
accompanied by reduced fetal capillary volume, surface area
density, length, and diameter in the placental labyrinth zone.
Underlying these placental changes is a striking reduction in pla-
cental expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A
(9, 10) a major driver of placental angiogenesis.
Recent evidence suggests that altered placental function, in-
cluding its hemodynamics, has a direct impact on the development
of fetal organs, particularly the heart (17–22). If compromised
placental vascular development due to glucocorticoid excess can be
rescued, this raises the possibility of a treatment for adverse effects
of placental dysfunction on the fetal heart and circulation. We
therefore assessed placental and umbilical blood velocity and heart
growth and function in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses and then took advantage
of the placental VEGF-releasing effects of pravastatin (23) to de-
termine whether it might rescue or ameliorate the effects of fetal
glucocorticoid overexposure.
Results
Hsd11b2−/− Fetuses Fail to Show the Normal Gestational Maturation
in Umbilical Cord Blood Velocity and Fetal Heart Function. To eval-
uate maturational changes in umbilical cord blood velocity and
heart function, fetuses of all three genotypes from male and
female Hsd11b2+/− matings underwent ultrasound analyses at
embryonic day (E)14.5 [maximum of labyrinth zone 11β-HSD2
Significance
Environmental challenges in utero perturb fetal growth and
alter subsequent adult health outcomes. The role of the pla-
centa is uncertain. We use a genetically modified mouse model
of fetoplacental glucocorticoid excess, which exhibits decreased
placental vascularity and fetal growth restriction. We show that
this model associates with retarded fetal heart development.
Strikingly, treatment with pravastatin restores placental vas-
cularity and reverses retarded fetal growth and cardiovascular
development. These results highlight the potential of statins to
remedy placental vascular insufficiency and enhance fetal
outcomes in compromised pregnancy.

 expression (11, 12) and before fetal adrenal gland steroidogen-
esis starts (24)], and at E17.5 (as placental 11β-HSD2 falls,
around peak fetal plasma glucocorticoid levels, and just before
birth, typically E18.5 in Hsd11b2+/− mice; ref. 10). Umbilical vein
blood velocity normally increases over gestation, as exemplified
by the 1.4-fold increase between E14.5 and E17.5 in wild-type
(Hsd11b2+/+) fetuses (Fig. 1A). Although not different from
control littermates at E14.5, umbilical vein blood velocity in
Hsd11b2−/− fetuses did not undergo the normal gestational in-
crease, such that by E17.5 umbilical vein blood velocity was 24%
less than wild type (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the normal gestation
decline in umbilical artery resistance (resistance index; RI =
systole/[systole+diastole]), apparent in Hsd11b2+/+ and Hsd11b2+/−
fetuses (18% decrease between E14.5 and E17.5), did not occur in
Hsd11b2−/− fetuses (Fig. 1B). Thus, there was an interaction be-
tween gestational age and genotype for both umbilical vein blood
velocity and RI. Heart function matures between E14.5 and E17.5,
and as the fetal heart becomes more compliant, left ventricle (LV)
filling becomes more dependent on passive filling (the E wave) and
less dependent on LV filling due to active contraction of the atria
(the A wave) (25); this clearly occurs in both Hsd11b2+/+ and
Hsd11b2+/− fetuses but did not occur in Hsd11b2−/− fetal hearts
(Fig. 1C). In contrast, myocardial performance index, a com-
bined measure of systolic and diastolic function (25), was un-
altered by genotype (see Table S1 for myocardial performance
index and a breakdown of each of the cardiac components
assessed by ultrasound).
These functional changes were not due to altered gross mor-
phology of the heart. Thus, at E17.5, there were no differences in
overall cardiac volume (Hsd11b2+/+: 3.9 ± 0.1, Hsd11b2+/−: 3.8 ±
0.2, Hsd11b2−/−: 3.4 ± 0.3 mm3) or number of cardiomyocytes
(Hsd11b2+/+: 4.1 ± 0.3, Hsd11b2+/−: 4.1 ± 0.2, Hsd11b2−/−: 3.8 ±
0.1 × 106). Perhaps analogously, cardiac function is altered in the
absence of gross morphological alteration in mice with car-
diomyocyte and vascular smooth muscle-specific deletion of the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (26).
Altered blood velocity in the Hsd11b2−/− umbilical cord
prompted us to explore whether this could be attributed to al-
tered umbilical cord structure or function. Histology revealed no
significant differences between Hsd11b2+/+ and Hsd11b2−/− in
luminal area or wall thickness of the umbilical artery or vein
(Table
S2).
Functionally,
isolated
umbilical
arteries
from
Hsd11b2−/−mice tended to be more responsive to vasoconstric-
tors and have lower basal release of endothelium-dependent
mediators. With loss of Hsd11b2, there was no significant alter-
ation in maximal contractile response to high potassium (Fig.
S1B), whereas the thromboxane agonist, U46619, reduced max-
imal contractile response (Fig. S1C). The maximal contraction
(Kmax) to U46619 was significantly lower in vessels from
Hsd11b2−/− compared with controls (2.41 ± 0.24 mN vs. 3.61 ±
0.45 mN, respectively), although the sensitivity to U46619 (EC50)
did not differ between genotypes. Basal endothelial function
(basal release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin) was explored
through contractile response to L-NAME and indomethacin in
the presence of an EC50 dose of U46619.
L-NAME + in-
domethacin caused a further 25–50% transient contraction of
vessels ∼2 min after addition, returning to baseline within 5 min
(Fig. S1D). The contractile response was greatest in the umbilical
arteries from control fetuses and lowest in arteries from
Hsd11b2−/− (19 ± 2% vs. ±39 ± 7%, P < 0.05). Acetylcholine, an
endothelium-dependent vasodilator, did not relax umbilical ar-
teries (Fig. S1). The ability of umbilical arteries to relax to other
vasodilators was confirmed by a concentration-dependent re-
laxation response to the nitric oxide donor drug, sodium nitro-
prusside (Fig. S1E), with no differences in response between
genotypes. This pattern of response concurs with the in vivo
findings. Although increased umbilical artery vasoconstriction
and reduced endothelium-dependent functions likely contribute
to reduced fetal blood supply in 11β-HSD2 null fetuses, the
differences between genotypes and magnitude of the changes
were modest and other factors are likely also to be involved (i.e.,
vascular resistance).
Gene Expression Patterns in Hsd11b2−/− Fetal Hearts Reflect Glucocorticoid
Overexposure and Earlier Maturation. To investigate glucocorticoid
exposure and probe mechanism underlying altered cardiac function
in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, we measured levels of mRNA encoding
glucocorticoid-responsive genes and genes important for contrac-
tile function. Cardiac expression of Tsc22d3 (also known as glu-
cocorticoid-induced leucine zipper; GILZ, a mediator of
antiinflammatory and perhaps other glucocorticoid actions) ex-
pression
exhibited
a
normal
gestational
increase
(26)
in
Hsd11b2+/+ and Hsd11b2+/− fetuses (Fig. 2A). Hsd11b2−/− fetuses
(gestational age and genotype interaction) had elevated levels at
E14.5, consistent with higher glucocorticoid exposure in midgestation.
Expression of Myh6 (encoding myosin heavy chain-α, MYHCα,
the major contractile protein in the adult heart) normally in-
creases between E14.5 and E17.5 (26), as exemplified by the 1.7-
fold increase between E14.5 and E17.5 in Hsd11b2+/+ and Hsd11b2+/−
fetal hearts (Fig. 2B). Whereas this gestational increase was exag-
gerated in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, Myh6 mRNA levels reduced (58%)

 at E14.5 and increased 1.4-fold at E17.5 compared with Hsd11b2+/+
littermates (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern of expression was observed for
the Atp2a2 gene encoding the calcium-handling protein SERCA2a
(Fig. 2C). The down-regulation of both Myh6 and SERCA2a
genes at E14.5 appears at variance with higher glucocorticoid
exposure of Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, predicted to cause early cardiac
maturation. This finding raises the possibility that either pre-
mature glucocorticoid exposure fails to mimic the normal mat-
urational effects of glucocorticoids upon the heart, or that
indirect dysmaturational effects predominate. Secretion of car-
diac natriuretic peptide A (ANP; encoded by Nppa) is stimulated
by stretch of the myocardium (27) and is considered a marker of
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (28). Its expression increases with
gestation, as apparent in Hsd11b2+/+ fetuses (1.8-fold between
E14.5 and E17.5) (Fig. 2D). However, neither Hsd11b2−/− nor
Hsd11b2+/− fetuses showed this developmental increase in ANP
expression in the heart. This finding suggests the Hsd11b2−/−
fetal heart tissue is less compliant, as shown by ultrasound
in vivo. Thus, overall Hsd11b2−/− fetuses show complex, gene-
specific patterns of premature, exaggerated, or reversed matura-
tion of glucocorticoid-sensitive transcripts in the myocardium.
Pravastatin Increases Labyrinth Zone Vegfa Expression and Fetal
Capillary Volume in all Genotypes. To determine whether the ad-
verse effects of glucocorticoid overexposure on the placental
vasculature can be overcome and whether this might beneficially
impact on fetal heart development, we administered (intraperi-
toneally) either pravastatin or saline from E6.5 onwards with the
aim of stimulating placental vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) production and, thereby, enhancing vascularization.
Consistent with its reported effects on placental VEGF (23),
pravastatin up-regulated expression of labyrinth zone Vegfa in all
genotypes (Fig. 3A). The increase in Hsd11b2−/− placentas was
greater (genotype × treatment), eliminating the genotype dif-
ference in placental Vegfa expression. Despite its role in regu-
lating Vegfa expression (29), labyrinth zone Pparg expression
levels did not correspond with Vegfa patterns (Fig. 3B); prava-
statin had no effect on Pparg mRNA expression, and a reduction
in Pparg mRNA was apparent in both saline- and pravastatin-
treated Hsd11b2−/− placentas.
Corresponding with increased placental Vegfa, placental weight
increased with pravastatin (Table 1). Stereological assessment of
labyrinth zone volume showed that whereas Hsd11b2−/− saline-
treated placentas appeared smaller, this was not statistically signif-
icant (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, there was only a trend (P = 0.0536)
for labyrinth zone volume increase with pravastatin (Fig. 3C).
Detailed investigation of fetal capillary volume provided a
clearer insight into placental vascular development. Thus, prav-
astatin modestly increased the volume of fetal capillaries within
the labyrinth zone of Hsd11b2+/+ and Hsd11b2+/− fetuses (Fig.
3D) but completely rescued the deficit in Hsd11b2−/− placentas,
with a significant interaction between treatment and genotype.
There were no effects of pravastatin on maternal body weight,
organ weight, or litter size (Table S3).
Pravastatin Strikingly Attenuates Fetal Growth Restriction and Reverses
Adverse Umbilical Flow and Cardiac Function in the Hsd11b2−/− Placenta
and Fetus. In saline-treated pregnancies, Hsd11b2−/− fetuses were
lighter than littermate controls as reported (10) (Table 1). Prava-
statin treatment increased fetal weight across all genotypes, al-
though Hsd11b2−/− remained lighter than their Hsd11b2+/+ and
Hsd11b2+/− littermates (Table 1). However, pravastatin ameliorated
the growth retardation in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses such that they were
the same weight as Hsd11b2+/+ controls.
Pravastatin had a marked effect on placental blood velocity
and fetal heart measures. Overall, pravastatin increased umbili-
cal vein blood velocity (Fig. 4A), decreased umbilical artery re-
sistance index (Fig. 4B), and increased fetal cardiac E/A wave
ratio (Fig. 4C) in all genotypes. Notably, pravastatin “normalized”
the aberrant phenotype of Hsd11b2−/− fetuses such that there were
no genotype differences in umbilical vein blood velocity or fetal
cardiac E/A ratio in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses from pravastatin-treated
dams (Fig. 4 A and C). In contrast, the resistance index remained
increased in both saline-treated and pravastatin-treated Hsd11b2−/−
fetuses, albeit to a lesser extent in the pravastatin-treated Hsd11b2−/−
fetuses compared with saline treated (Fig. 4B).
The effects of pravastatin on cardiac functional changes were
not accompanied by gross morphological changes. Thus, there
were no differences in overall cardiac volume, ventricular lumen
volume, or the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to lumen volume
(Table S4).
Pravastatin Markedly Alters Fetal Cardiac Ace and Some Collagen
mRNAs. Expression of glucocorticoid-responsive Tsc22d3 mRNA
was not altered by pravastatin (Fig. 5A), consistent with increased
glucocorticoid exposure and reflecting similar findings from the
initial untreated cohort at E17.5 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the alter-
ations in Hsd11b2−/− fetal heart function are likely independent of

 direct cardiac glucocorticoid action. Similarly, expression of Mhyc6
and Atp2a2 was unaffected by pravastatin in all genotypes (Fig. 5 B
and C). Although there was no effect of pravastatin on cardiac Nppa
expression in Hsd11b2+/+ fetuses (Fig. 5D), it increased in prava-
statin-treated Hsd11b2−/− and Hsd11b2+/− fetuses. Thus, pravastatin
rescued cardiac Nppa expression in Hsd11b2+/− and partially res-
cued Hsd11b2−/− fetuses. Expression of Ace was decreased in fetal
hearts of all genotypes with pravastatin (Fig. 5E), abolishing the
genotype difference seen in saline-treated fetuses.
Collagen is a key contributor to cardiac wall stiffness. In
fetuses from saline-treated dams, there was an increase in the
cardiac expression of Col1a1 (which determines rigidity) (30) in
Hsd11b2−/− and Hsd11b2+/− fetuses, compared with Hsd11b2+/+
littermates (Fig. 5F). This difference was not evident in fetuses
from pravastatin-treated dams. Col3a1, which determines elas-
ticity (30), showed a reciprocal effect; Col3a1 mRNA levels were
reduced in hearts of saline-treated Hsd11b2−/− and Hsd11b2+/−
fetuses compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 5G). However,
although pravastatin had no effect in Hsd11b2+/+, it increased
Col3a1 mRNA levels in Hsd11b2−/− and Hsd11b2+/− fetuses.
These expression patterns correspond with the changes in cardiac
function. For Col4a1 (Fig. 5H), there was no effect of genotype or
treatment, but a significant interaction. Thus, pravastatin increased
Col4a1 expression in hearts of Hsd11b2+/+ fetuses by 8.5-fold, but
decreased it in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses (68% decrease). Pravastatin did
not alter Vegfa and Pparg in the fetal heart. These data demonstrate
that although pravastatin does not reverse cardiac glucocorticoid
overexposure in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, it does change key collagens
and other endocrine genes in a pattern that corresponds with en-
hancement of Hsd11b2−/− fetal heart function.
Discussion
Pravastatin treatment dramatically ameliorates the adverse
phenotype of Hsd11b2−/− fetuses; placental labyrinth zone mor-
phology, umbilical blood velocity, fetal weight and fetal heart
function, and gene expression are, for the most part, normalized.
Thus, despite persistently increased placental and fetal glucocorti-
coid exposure in Hsd11b2−/− fetuses, it is possible to counter these
adverse outcomes, including the “intrauterine growth restriction”
(IUGR) phenotype. These findings highlight the crucial role of the
placenta in informing fetal development and suggest statins as a
potential therapy for IUGR with placental vascular insufficiency.
Despite the “maturational” effects of antenatal glucocorti-
coids, we surprisingly found that Hsd11b2−/− fetuses exhibit
delayed or impaired cardiac functional maturation. Whether
these changes in fetal heart function alter cardiac function in
adulthood will be important to uncover in the future, although in
this experimental model, adult heart function is likely to be
influenced by the effect of lifelong absence of 11β-HSD2 upon
salt regulation, blood pressure, and renal function (31), con-
founding interpretation. Pravastatin treatment then eradicated
the impaired Hsd11b2−/− fetal cardiac maturation in conjunction
with normalizing placental vascular parameters. We postulate
that placental and umbilical cord hemodynamics could be an
important factor directly influencing fetal heart development;
intervention is required to demonstrate this. However, recent
evidence supports the view that the placenta directly influences
the development of specific fetal organs, notably the heart. Thus,
human placental size and shape are epidemiologically associated
with the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later life (17, 32,
33). Thornburg et al. proposed (18) that because the fetal heart
beats directly against the resistance of the placental bed, changes
in placental blood velocity must impact on fetal heart develop-
ment. Placental insufficiency (albeit severe—with absent or re-
versed diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery) results in
increased loading of the right ventricle (19). Importantly, ex-
tensive work in genetically modified mouse models has revealed
the necessity of a functional placenta for optimal heart devel-
opment; the cardiac defects exhibited in Pparγ and p38α null
embryos are rectified by targeted placental normalization (21,
22, 34). Furthermore, mice with genetic disruption of HOXA13,
which is not expressed in the heart but is an important transcrip-
tional regulator of placental Tie2 (and, thus, placental vascular
branching) show abnormal placental endothelium that is associated
with reduced ventricular wall thickness in the fetal heart (20),
presumably occurring secondarily to the placental defect.
Pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that reduces
cholesterol biosynthesis, is currently contraindicated in pregnancy,
because of its potential effects in altering NO bioavailability in the
fetal circulation, with detrimental consequences for the fetal brain
sparing response to acute hypoxia, as may happen intrapartum (35).
However, pravastatin in various mouse models of preeclampsia
appears to ameliorate preeclamptic pathology (23, 36), and prava-
statin is the subject of a randomized control trial to ameliorate
severe preeclampsia (37). Three biological compartments are ex-
posed to pravastatin in our model: (i) the maternal, although our
experimental design controls for alteration in maternal physiology
because all fetal genotypes are generated within the one pregnancy,
(ii) the placental and (iii), the fetal. Restoration of vasculogenesis in
preeclamptic placentas following pravastatin has been variously at-
tributed to stimulation of placental VEGF release, soluble Flt-1
(sFlt-1; a VEGF receptor), and placental growth factor (36, 38).
Here, pravastatin enhanced labyrinth zone Vegfa expression in all
genotypes. Accordingly, fetal capillary volume, umbilical vein ve-
locity, and umbilical resistance index underwent corresponding
changes. Pravastatin will doubtless have placental actions beyond
Vegfa. Indeed, in human first trimester placental explants, prava-
statin inhibits insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor function with
adverse implications for trophoblast differentiation (39). With
regard to the fetus, the levels of pravastatin achieved within the fetal
circulation in this current study are unknown, but earlier studies
have demonstrated that transfer of pravastatin in ex vivo human
placenta occurs albeit to a limited extent (40, 41). However, it is of
interest to note that we observed no induction of Vegfa expression in
Hsd11b2−/− fetal heart, suggesting that if pravastatin is eliciting di-
rect effects on the fetus, it may be via different pathways. Although
we cannot discount the potential for direct effects of pravastatin on
the fetus, the intriguing possibility is thus raised that the changes in
cardiac parameters are primarily due to effects of pravastatin on
enhancing the placental vasculature, with effects on the fetal heart
occurring secondarily.
Further specific investigations are required to dissect this
potential placenta–cardiac axis. Placenta-specific removal of
Hsd11b2 and manipulation of VEGFA specifically in the placenta
will be useful to determine how placental vasculature impacts on
fetal heart development and function. Nevertheless, our findings
suggest the intriguing possibility that using extrinsic factors to
enhance placental vasculature in compromised pregnancies could

 have beneficial impact on fetal heart development and in IUGR
more generally. Indeed, other gestational insults, such as fetal
hypoxia, which also cause IUGR and cardiovascular programming
can be overcome by administration of vitamin C (42, 43). However,
the mechanism is likely different; whereas oxidative stress was at-
tenuated by vitamin C, placental labyrinth zone volume remained
unaltered (42, 43).
Overall, these data add to the growing body of evidence that
placental vasculature has a key role in fetal development and
programming outcomes. Moreover, enhancement of placental
vasculature in compromised pregnancies may be beneficial for
fetal heart development and in IUGR.
Methods
Animals. Male and female Hsd11b2+/− mice, congenic on the C57BL/6J
background (44), were mated overnight, and the morning of the day the
vaginal plug was identified was designated E0.5. The resultant pregnancies
were only analyzed if each of the possible offspring genotypes was repre-
sented in the litter: Hsd11b2+/+ (“control” littermates), Hsd11b2+/−, and
Hsd11b2−/−. This approach controls for alteration in maternal physiology
because all fetal genotypes are generated within the one pregnancy. Ani-
mals were given standard chow, water, and housing arrangements, and all
studies were conducted in the strictest standards of humane animal care
under the auspices of the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act, 1986 and local ethical committee approval.
Two groups of dams were used for this study. Group 1 underwent char-
acterization of changes in placental and umbilical blood velocity and fetal
heart development over gestation. A subset of group 1 dams underwent
ultrasound analyses at E14.5 or E17.5 (n = 8 at each timepoint). Following
imaging, the pregnant dam was euthanized in situ, and scanned fetuses
were excised following identification by corroboration of position with the
ultrasound images. Fetuses were fixed and umbilical cords were collected for
subsequent myography studies. Placental and fetal tissues were collected from a
further subset of dams (n = 8 at each timepoint) for gene expression analysis.
Group 2 were injected with either saline (Sal) or 20 μg/kg of pravastatin
sodium salt (Prav; Cayman Chemical) intraperitoneally daily from E6.5 on-
wards. At E17.5, a subset underwent ultrasound analyses and placentas were
collected for stereological analysis (n = 8), whereas an additional cohort (n =
6–8) was generated for placental and fetal gene analysis.
Umbilical cords were placed in ice-cold Krebs–Henseleit solution before
subsequent myography studies. For RNA extractions, placentas were dissected
rapidly over wet ice and separated into junctional and labyrinth zones before
freezing on dry ice. Fetal hearts were dissected and immediately frozen on dry
ice. For histological investigations, whole placentas, umbilical cords, and fetuses
were fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded. Fetal tails were collected in all
cases for genotyping and gendertyping by PCR as described (10). However, sex
was not taken into account in the final analyses because of an insufficient
number of each sex for each possible genotype to reach statistical power.
High-Resolution Ultrasound Analysis. In vivo ultrasound assessment was per-
formed by using a Vevo 770 ultrasound biomicroscope (Visualsonics) using a
RMV707B 30 MHz center frequency transducer. Pregnant mice were scanned
as described (26). Fetal-placental units were imaged over a strict 20-min time
period, with a minimum of three units being analyzed in each pregnancy.
Blood velocity within the umbilical artery, vein, and placenta was measured
(45). Fetal hearts were visualized in B-mode and Doppler measurements
were undertaken to determine the E/A wave ratio and myocardial perfor-
mance index (MPI) (26). Images were recorded for offline analysis.
Placental and Umbilical Cord Morphology. Placental stereological investiga-
tions were conducted as described (10). Umbilical cord morphology was
ascertained from four cross-sectional hemotoxylin and eosin-stained sections
taken from the midline of the umbilical cord, 80 μm apart. The umbilical artery
and vein area and perimeter were calculated by manually tracing the outer
smooth muscle outline and lumen perimeter by using Nikon NIS Elements Im-
aging Software v4.10. (Nikon Instruments). All measurements were performed
by an observer blind to genotype. Treatment and intraobserver error was <5%.
Cardiac Morphology. Serial H&E-stained sections were assessed by using
Nikon NIS Elements Imaging Software v4.10. (Nikon Instruments). Cardiac
tissue volume and cardiomyocyte number were determined by using ste-
reological investigations as described (46). Ventricle wall thickness was
assessed by measuring the thickness of the wall at the point perpendicular
from the center of the longest axis of the ventricle.
Umbilical Vessel Myography. The contractile and vasodilator capacity of
umbilical vessels was assessed by myography, based on modifications of
previously established protocols. Umbilical arteries were carefully dissected,
cut into lengths of ∼1.5 mm, then mounted on a wire myograph (610M;
Danish Myo Technology) by using 25-μm-diameter wire. Vessels were placed
at 2 mN pretension, allowed to equilibrate for 30–60 min, before estab-
lishing vessel viability with high K+ physiological saline solution (K+PSS) +
noradrenaline (10 μM). Arteries with a contraction of 1 mN or less were
excluded from the analysis. Vessels were contracted with increasing doses of
thromboxane mimetic (U46619). EC80 of U46619 were chosen to precontract
arteries, before carrying out concentration response curves to the endothelium-
dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine (ACh), and the endothelium-independent
vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). To assess basal endothelial activity,
vessels were partially precontracted with EC50 U46619, before addition of the
eNOS inhibitor, Lω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 200 μM), and the
cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 μM). The data from force trans-
ducers were processed by a MacLab/4e analog–digital converter and displayed
through Chart software, version 3.4.3 (AD Instruments).
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from tissue by using QIAzol Lysis
reagent (Qiagen Sciences) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA
(1 μg) was reverse transcribed by using Mouse Moloney leukemia virus re-
verse transcriptase and random primers (Promega). The cDNA was sub-
sequently purified with Ultraclean PCR Cleanup kit (MoBio Laboratories).

MEDICAL SCIENCES
 Specific mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR on the
Rotorgene 6000 system (Corbett Research) using QuantiTect SYBR Green
Mastermix (Qiagen Sciences). Primers for Vegfa, peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-γ (Pparg); glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ, for
Tsc22d3); myosin heavy chain 6-α (Myh6); sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic re-
ticulum calcium ATPase 2 (Atp2a2); natriuretic peptide A (Nppa); angioten-
sin I converting enzyme (Ace); collagen, type I, α-1 (Col1a1); collagen, type III,
α-1 (Col3a1); and collagen, type IV, α-1 (Col4a1) were purchased as Qiagen
QuantiTect primers with the exception of the internal standards, Tbp, Ppia,
and Sdha, which were designed by using Primer-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov). Primer pairs for all genes are listed in Table S5. Standard curves were
generated through 10-fold serial dilution of purified PCR products for each
gene with analysis by using Rotorgene 6000 Software. All samples were
normalized against Tbp, Sdha, and Ppia by using the GeNorm algorithm (47).
Statistical Analysis. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM, with each litter
representing n = 1, with no more than 1 representative pup per litter analyzed.
For fetal and placental weights, n = 14–20. Fetal sex was noted but was not
taken into account in analyses, including fetal weight, because statistical power
was insufficient for analysis by gender and genotype. For ultrasound (n = 8),
values were normalized to fetal weight. For heart and umbilical cord morphol-
ogy and gene expression studies, n = 6–8. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
post hoc test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test were used as
appropriate. P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
