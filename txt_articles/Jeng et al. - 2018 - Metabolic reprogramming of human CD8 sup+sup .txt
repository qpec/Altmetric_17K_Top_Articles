IntroductIon
The loss of the T cell coreceptor CD28 is a prominent hall-
mark of immune aging. In umbilical cord blood, virtually all 
CD8+ T cells express CD28 (Azuma et al., 1993). However, 
with repeated exposure to antigens over the course of an in-
dividual’s life, a majority of CD8+ 
T cells in human peripheral 
blood will become progressively differentiated and eventu-
ally lose CD28 surface expression (Effros et al., 1994; Posnett 
et al., 1994; Fagnoni et al., 1996). This process is accelerated 
in response to persistent viral infections, such as CMV and 
HIV (Saukkonen et al., 1993; Dutra et al., 1996; Effros, 2005; 
Wertheimer et al., 2014). Functionally, CD8+CD28– T cells 
have an impaired proliferative response to antigen-specific 
activation, but they remain very cytotoxic, acquiring high ex-
pression of natural killer cell receptors and producing greater 
levels of effector molecules, such as granzyme B (GZMB), 
perforin (PRF1), and IFN-γ, under resting and activated con-
ditions (Tarazona et al., 2001; Weng et al., 2009). Given the 
ubiquitous presence of CD8+CD28– T cells and their con-
nection to aging, a better understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms driving their uncontrolled production of effec-
tor molecules is needed.
Human sirtuins (SIRT1–7) are highly conserved proteins 
that regulate cellular processes linked to metabolism and or-
ganismal longevity (Guarente, 2011; Houtkooper et al., 2012). 
Enhancing the expression of the ancestral SIR2 protein in yeast 
and worms promotes organismal life span extension (Kae-
berlein et al., 1999; Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001). Silent 
mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1), 
the closest mammalian homologue of SIR2, is a nuclear nic-
otinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)–dependent protein 
deacetylase that targets many transcription factors involved in 
different cellular processes (Chang and Guarente, 2014). SIRT1 
levels decrease with age in the brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and 
white adipose tissue of rodents, possibly contributing to the 
aging processes in these tissues (Quintas et al., 2012; Gong et 
al., 2014; Cho et al., 2015). Conditions that activate SIRT1 ac-
tivity (e.g., treatment with the phytoalexin resveratrol [RSV]) 
improve symptoms associated with metabolic dysfunction and 
protect against age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegen-
eration, and cardiovascular disease (Jin et al., 2008; 
Tanno et al., 
2010; Hall et al., 2013). Similarly, boosting SIRT1 activity with 
the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside in aged mice results 
in improved mitochondrial and stem cell function and a mod-
est life span extension (Cantó et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016). 
Although several fate-determining functions of SIRT1 have 
emerged in regulatory, proinflammatory, and anergic CD4+ 
and activated CD8+ effector 
T cells (van Loosdregt et al., 2010; 
the expansion of cd8+cd28– t cells, a population of terminally differentiated memory t cells, is one of the most consistent 
immunological changes in humans during aging. cd8+cd28– t cells are highly cytotoxic, and their frequency is linked to many 
age-related diseases. As they do not accumulate in mice, many of the molecular mechanisms regulating their fate and function 
remain unclear. In this paper, we find that human cd8+cd28– t cells, under resting conditions, have an enhanced capacity to 
use glycolysis, a function linked to decreased expression of the nAd+-dependent protein deacetylase SIrt1. Global gene ex-
pression profiling identified the transcription factor Foxo1 as a SIrt1 target involved in transcriptional reprogramming of 
cd8+cd28– t cells. Foxo1 is proteasomally degraded in SIrt1-deficient cd8+cd28– t cells, and inhibiting its activity in resting 
cd8+cd28+ t cells enhanced glycolytic capacity and granzyme B production as in cd8+cd28– t cells. these data identify the 
evolutionarily conserved SIrt1–Foxo1 axis as a regulator of resting cd8+ memory t cell metabolism and activity in humans.

Beier et al., 2011; Kuroda et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2012; Lim et 
al., 2015), its role in CD8+ memory 
T cells remains unknown.
Here, we show that SIRT1 expression is markedly 
down-regulated in terminally differentiated CD8+CD28− 
memory 
T cells, a population that accumulates during human 
aging (Fagnoni et al., 1996). Loss of SIRT1 and enhanced 
proteasomal degradation of the downstream transcription 
factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) promote an en-
hanced glycolytic capacity and increased GZMB secretion 
under resting conditions, pointing to the SIRT1–FoxO1 axis 
as an important mechanism for preserving resting memory T 
cell metabolism and function.

down-regulation of SIrt1 in cd8+cd28– t cells
Given the known roles of SIRT1 in organismal aging and 
T cell function, we examined SIRT1 expression in human 
CD8+CD28– T cells. We found SIRT1 protein expression 
markedly down-regulated in freshly isolated, nonactivated 
CD8+CD28– T cell populations when compared with naive 
or CD28+ memory T cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Of note, we 
found the percentage of effector T cells in the CD28– popu-
lation to be <5% as previously described (Amara et al., 2004; 
Miller et al., 2008). Reduced SIRT1 levels were consistent 
across samples from multiple individuals (Fig. 1 C). SIRT1 
mRNA levels were not significantly different (Fig. 1 D), im-
plying that SIRT1 transcription was not affected. Importantly, 
expression of other nuclear sirtuins, SIRT6 and SIRT7, was 
unchanged in CD8+CD28– T cells (Fig. 1 E).
T
o test whether the down-regulation of SIRT1 is caus-
ally linked to the loss of CD28 coreceptor expression, we 
performed a long-term culture of sorted CD8+CD28+ 
T cells 
(99.9% purity) in the presence of IL-15, a memory T cell 
survival and proliferation cytokine, which led to a significant 
loss of CD28 surface expression (Fig. 1, F and G; Chiu et 
al., 2006). When CD8+CD28+ and CD8+CD28– T cells were 
resorted after 20 d of culture, we observed no differences in 
SIRT1 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of 
SIRT1 was specific to blood-derived CD8+CD28– T cells 
and not causally related to loss of CD28 (Fig. 1 H).
loss of SIrt1 correlates with metabolic reprogramming
Metabolism is a key driver of T cell function. Although 
naive and resting memory T cells depend primarily on mi-
tochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxida-
tion, activated T cells rapidly shift their metabolism toward 
aerobic glycolysis to support their full effector function 
(Pearce et al., 2013). Because SIRT1 regulates mitochon-
drial function in skeletal muscle (Sack and Finkel, 2012), 
and defective mitochondrial function has been reported in 
senescent terminally differentiated RA+ effector memory 
T cells (TEMRA cells; Henson et al., 2014), we investigated 
whether low SIRT1 expression changed the metabolism 
of T cells. Using Seahorse technology, we first measured 
the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in naive, CD28+, 
and CD28– human CD8+ memory T cells with a stan-
dard mitochondrial stress test, which included treatments 
with oligomycin (an inhibitor of ATP synthase), carbonyl 
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; an 
uncoupling agent), and a combination of antimycin A and 
rotenone (inhibitors of complex III and complex I, respec-
tively). We found no difference in OCR between resting 
CD8+ naive, CD28+, and CD28– T cells with or without 
the addition of the mitochondrial toxins (Fig. 2 A), indi-
cating that mitochondrial oxygen consumption was undis-
turbed in T cells with low SIRT1 expression.

In contrast, CD8+CD28– T cells exhibited a distinctive 
glycolytic profile, highlighted by their markedly elevated ex-
tracellular acidification rate (ECAR) after exposure to oligo-
mycin (Fig. 2 B). The ECAR response to oligomycin, called 
glycolytic capacity, measures how well cells are primed to use 
glycolysis when ATP production from oxidative phosphory-
lation is impaired. One function of this capacity is to support 
the glycolytic gene program in CD8+ effector memory 
T cells 
(TEM cells) immediately after activation (Gubser et al., 2013). 
In resting CD8+CD28– T cells, we found that the glycolytic 
capacity (maximum ECAR after oligomycin injection) was 
consistently increased among various donors (Fig. 2 C), pro-
ducing a unique energy profile (OCR vs. ECAR plot) de-
fined by a characteristic shift in ECAR, but not OCR, in 
response to oligomycin (Fig. 2 D). This increased glycolytic 
capacity depended on the presence of extracellular glucose 
(Fig. 2 E and Fig. S1 A) and was accompanied by increased 
levels of lactate, as expected (Fig. 2 F). A consistent increase 
in glycolytic capacity in CD28– over CD28+ memory T cells 
was unique to the resting state and was not observed after ac-
tivation with CD3 antibodies when CD28+ T cells increased 
their glycolytic activities to the same level as CD28– T cells 
(Fig. 2 G and Fig. S1, B and C).
T
o determine whether low SIRT1 levels and high 
glycolytic capacity were linked in CD8+CD28– T cells, we 
treated resting cells with RSV to enhance SIRT1 activity 
(Hubbard et al., 2013). With little toxicity (Fig. S1 D), RSV 
lowered the glycolytic capacity (Fig. 2, H and I; and Fig. S1 
E) and shifted the energy profile (Fig. 2 J) of CD8+CD28– T 
cells closer to levels in CD8+ naive and CD28+ memory T

cells. Similar results were obtained after treatment with the 
NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside, independently link-
ing the control of glycolytic capacity to SIRT1 activity in 
CD8+CD28– T cells (Fig. 2 K).
Altered Foxo1 target gene expression in cd8+cd28– t cells
Because the switch to a glycolytic program in activated 
T cells 
is associated with extensive changes in gene expression (Man 
and Kallies, 2015), we performed microarray analysis to define 
the global gene expression profiles of resting CD8+CD28+ 
and CD28– T cells isolated from three individual blood do-
nors. 
This analysis revealed differential regulation of 159 genes 
within resting CD8+CD28– T cells (log2 fold change ≥1.0; 
false discovery rate [FDR] ≤0.05). Down-regulated genes 
included CD28 and previously reported T cell homing re-
ceptors, such as C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) 
and l-selectin (CD62L), as well as long-term survival cyto-
kine receptor IL7R (Fig. 3 A and Table S1; Hamann et al., 
1997; Sallusto et al., 1999; Joshi et al., 2007). Several natural 
killer receptors, including killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 
(KLRG1), and cytolytic granzymes were up-regulated (Hen-
son et al., 2009). Supporting previous studies (Fann et al., 2005; 
Sun et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013), we found that under non-
activated conditions, terminally differentiated CD8+CD28– 
T cells expressed markedly higher GZMB mRNA and intra-
cellular GZMB protein levels (Fig. S2, A and B). PRF1 and 
IFNG transcripts were also increased (Fig. S2 A).
Using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), we generated 
a list of upstream transcription factors (ordered from most 
to least significant p-value) that were predicted to regulate 
the variable gene expression between the two populations 
(Fig. 3 A). 
The top candidate was FoxO1 (P = 2.97 × 10−6), a 
SIRT1 substrate implicated in regulating multiple metabolic 
pathways in other cell types (Gross et al., 2008). FoxO1 also 
binds and regulates the expression of multiple genes that con-
trol T cell homing, homeostasis, tolerance, and memory dif-
ferentiation (Ouyang et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2012; Kim et al., 
2013; Staron et al., 2014), and the FoxO homologue DAF-16 
is a substrate of SIRT1 in Caenorhabditis elegans aging (Lin 
et al., 1997; Berdichevsky et al., 2006).
With quantitative RT
-PCR (qRT
-PCR) and flow cy-
tometry, we verified the down-regulation of canonical FoxO1 
target genes in CD8+CD28– T cells, including lymph node–
homing receptors CCR7 and CD62L and the growth fac-
tor IL7 receptor (IL7R; Kerdiles et al., 2009). CD8+CD28– T 
cells also expressed increased KLRG1, a marker of terminal T 
cell differentiation that is inversely related to FoxO1 expres-
sion in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3, B and C; Michelini et al., 2013).
SIrt1 regulates Foxo1 protein expression in cd8+ t cells
FoxO proteins are targets of the deacetylase function of 
SIRT1 (Brunet et al., 2004; Motta et al., 2004). We con-
firmed that this is also the case with FoxO1 in CD8+ T 
cells by performing mass spectrometry on freshly isolated 
T cells treated with the SIRT1 inhibitor 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-
tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide (Ex-527) and his-
tone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). The latter 
inhibitor was used to increase overall acetylation levels. We 
identified 831 acetylated lysine-containing peptides, among 
them Lys262-acetylated FoxO1, a site that regulates DNA 
binding of FoxO1 in human liver carcinoma cells (Matsuzaki 
et al., 2005). Lys262-acetylated FoxO1 was 10 times more 
abundant in 
T cells treated with 
TSA and Ex-527 than in cells 
treated with TSA alone, indicating that it is a specific SIRT1 
target site in CD8+ T cells (Fig. S2 C). FoxO1 hyperacetyl-
ation in response to SIRT1 inhibition is linked to enhanced 
FoxO1 degradation via protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)–me-
diated phosphorylation, as it attenuates the DNA-binding 
affinity of FoxO1 and facilitates its nuclear export and degra-
dation (Daitoku et al., 2004; Frescas et al., 2005). Accordingly, 
FoxO1 protein levels were decreased in both nuclear and cy-
toplasmic compartments of CD8+CD28– T cells (Fig. 3 D). 
Down-regulation of FoxO1 was consistently observed among 
different donors and exhibited a pattern of gradual decline 
in protein expression similar to SIRT1 from naive > CD28+ 
> CD28– T cell populations (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. 3 E). 
No significant differences in FoxO1 mRNA levels were ob-
served, supporting that FoxO1, like SIRT1, is posttranscrip-
tionally down-regulated in CD8+CD28– T cells (Fig. 3 F). 
Indeed, treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 res-
cued protein expression of FoxO1 in CD8+CD28– T cells 
to approximately half of its levels in CD28+ T cells (Fig. 3, 
G and H), supporting the model that FoxO1 is proteasom-
ally degraded in the absence of SIRT1. In contrast, SIRT1 
levels did not respond to MG132 treatment, implicating that 
expression of FoxO1 and SIRT1 proteins is distinctly regu-
lated in CD8+CD28– T cells.
We also examined SIRT1 and FoxO1 protein levels 
in sorted CD8+ memory T cell subsets using CCR7 and 
CD45RA as additional differentiation markers (Fig. S2 D). 
We found a progressive down-regulation of both proteins 
in CD28+ central memory (TCM) and transitional memory 
(TTM) T cells, mirroring the progressive loss of the FoxO1 
target CCR7 in these cells (Fig. S2, D–G). Both proteins were 
most down-regulated in the TEM and TEM/TEMRA populations 
identified in CD8+CD28– 
T cells, with no difference detected 
between TEM and TEMRA populations (Fig. S2, D–G). The 
same was observed when intracellular staining for FoxO1 was 
performed in unsorted cells, and no difference was observed 
between cells isolated from CMV+ or CMV– donors (Fig. S2 
H). Throughout all cell subsets, SIRT1 and FoxO1 proteins 
levels were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.8197), supporting the 
model that SIRT1 and FoxO1 protein levels are linked in 
human CD8+ memory T cells (Fig. S2 I).
To confirm that SIRT1 acts upstream of FoxO1, we 
performed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeat (CRI 
SPR) editing of the SIRT1 gene in CD8+ T cells 
using nucleofection of purified CRI 
SPR-associated protein 
9 (Cas9) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing 
guide RNAs specific for SIRT1. This method is highly effi-

cient in primary human T cells and was used in CD4+ T cells 
for host factor gene editing in HIV infection (Schumann 
et al., 2015; Hultquist et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017). When 
SIRT1 protein expression was efficiently decreased with two 
independent guide RNAs, FoxO1 levels were reproducibly 
decreased (Fig. 3, I and J). Conversely, SIRT1 overexpression 
using T cell nucleofection with recombinant SIRT1 protein 
led to a modest but consistent increase in FoxO1 levels as 
early as 18 h after nucleofection (Fig. 3, K and L). These data 
support the model that SIRT1 expressed in human CD8+ 
memory T cells stabilizes FoxO1 protein levels.
Inhibition of Foxo1 reprograms t cell 
metabolism and cytotoxicity
To determine whether FoxO1 is the downstream target of 
SIRT1, thereby preventing increases in glycolytic capacity 
and cytotoxic activity in resting CD8+ memory T cells, we 
treated resting CD8+ naive or CD28+ memory T cells with 
the compound AS1842856. AS1842856 blocks FoxO1 tran-
scriptional activity by selectively binding its dephosphory-
lated active form (Nagashima et al., 2010). Inhibiting FoxO1 
with AS1842856 consistently enhanced the glycolytic capac-
ity (Fig. 4 A) and shifted the energy profile (Fig. 4 B) in 
Figure 3. Altered Foxo1 gene expression in cd8+cd28– t cells. (A) Microarray analysis in CD8+CD28+ and CD28– T cells, predicting FoxO1 as an al-

both cell populations, replicating the phenotype observed in 
CD8+CD28– T cells with reduced FoxO1 expression.
AS1842856 had no effect on cell viability (Fig. S3 A) 
and, as expected, suppressed expression of the FoxO1 tar-
get genes CD62L and IL7R in resting human CD8+ T cells 
(Fig. 4 C and Fig. S3 B). In contrast, AS1842856 signifi-
cantly and dose-dependently increased basal GZMB mRNA 
and intracellular protein levels in CD8+CD28+, but not in 
CD8+CD28–, T cells, supporting the model that metabolic 
and cytotoxic characteristics of CD8+CD28– T cells are 
linked via FoxO1 (Fig. 4, C and D; and Fig. S3 C). Treat-
ment with AS1842856 did not cause T cell activation (Fig. S3 
D), but required glucose consumption (Fig. 4 E) as reported 
by others (Cham et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2013), further 
linking glycolytic and cytotoxic capacities of CD8+ T cells 
under resting conditions.
Collectively, we identify the SIRT1–FoxO1 axis as 
a novel regulator of metabolic reprogramming in human 
CD8+ T cells as they first progress from naive T cells to 
CD28+ central and transitional memory cells, and ultimately 
to CD28– TEM and TEMRA cells. The accumulation of these 
terminally differentiated CD8+CD28– T cells is a consistent 
immunological change in aging humans (Fagnoni et al., 
1996). Although these cells are a product of repeated anti-
gen stimulation and have been linked to pathology because of 
their uncontrolled production of effector molecules (Vallejo, 
2005; Weng et al., 2009), our molecular and metabolic un-
derstanding of how CD28– T cells differ from their naive and

CD28+ memory T cell counterparts and of their causal link 
to aging is still limited.
We propose a model in which reduced levels of SIRT1 
destabilize the expression and function of FoxO1 to enhance 
the glycolytic and cytotoxic (i.e., GZMB producing) capac-
ities of resting CD8+CD28– T cells, thereby contributing to 
immune dysfunctions observed in this cell type (Fig. 4 F). 
Beyond its well-characterized role of inducing apoptosis in 
virally infected cells, continuously circulating GZMB de-
grades extracellular matrix proteins and propagates inflam-
matory signaling, thus possibly playing a pathophysiological 
role in age-related chronic inflammatory diseases (Darrah and 
Rosen, 2010; Hiebert and Granville, 2012).
We show that SIRT1 levels diminish with increased T 
cell differentiation status and find a strong correlation with 
FoxO1 expression in human CD8+ T cells, thereby adding 
new insights into the regulation of FoxO1-mediated lineage 
determination and metabolic reprogramming (Kerdiles et al., 
2010; Gubser et al., 2013; Michelini et al., 2013). FoxO1 is 
known to control GZMB transcription through the repres-
sion of the transcription factor T box transcription factor 21 
(T
-bet) before antigen stimulation (Rao et al., 2012). We ex-
tend these findings by linking them to the upstream regulatory 
role of SIRT1 and the metabolic state of resting CD8+ 
T cells.
Although this represents a new role for the SIRT1–
FoxO1 axis in human CD8+ T cells, previous studies have 
found this axis to be involved in regulating other cellular 
processes, such as maintenance and growth of skeletal muscle 
(Lee and Goldberg, 2013), apoptosis in senescent cardiomyo-
cytes (Sin et al., 2014), intracellular signaling in tissues (Gross 
et al., 2008; Sin et al., 2015), and regulating the hippocampal 
homeostasis in aging mice (Jenwitheesuk et al., 2017). In C. 
elegans, the homologous SIR2–DAF-16–FOXO pathway, 
when strengthened, extends organismal life span (Tissen-
baum and Guarente, 2001).
Our new findings now connect this evolutionarily 
conserved pathway with T cell metabolism and cytotoxicity. 
Strengthening the SIRT1–FoxO1 axis may provide a poten-
tial therapeutic intervention to reprogram terminally differ-
entiated memory T cells and delay the immune aging process 
(Guarente, 2011; Houtkooper et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016).
MAterIAlS And MethodS
human donors and t cell population sorting
Blood samples were collected at the Blood Centers of the 
Pacific in San Francisco, CA. All donors were kept anony-
mous and provided written informed consent. T
otal human 
CD8+ T cells were enriched via negative selection using the 
RosetteSep human CD8+ T cell enrichment cocktail (15063; 
Stemcell). The following antibodies were used to stain pe-
ripheral blood mononuclear cells or enriched CD8+ naive, 
CD8+CD28+ memory, and CD8+CD28− T cells: CD3-
PECy5 (555334; BD Biosciences) and CD3-APC-H7 
(560176; BD Biosciences), CD8-V450 (560347; BD Biosci-
ences), CD28-PE (12–0289; eBioscience), CD45RA-APC 
(17–0458; eBioscience), and CCR7-PECy7 (557648; BD 
Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed on an LSR 
II or 
Calibur DxP8 flow cytometer (both BD Biosciences) and was 
analyzed with FlowJo software. Sorting was performed on an 
ARIA II (BD Biosciences).
Intracellular flow
CD8+ T cells were cultured for 1 h in complete RPMI in 
the presence of brefeldin A and subsequently stained for via-
bility using the viability dyes eFluor 506, 520, or 780 (eBio-
science), according to the provided protocol. After surface 
marker staining, cells were permeabilized and fixed using 
the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabiliza-
tion Concentrate and Diluent kit (eBioscience). Intracellu-
lar GZMB-FITC (515403; BioLegend), FoxO1-PE (14262; 
Cell Signaling T
echnology), and isotope control (5742; Cell 
Signaling T
echnology) staining was performed in FOXP3 
perm/wash buffer for 1 h at 4°C. After washing and fixa-
tion of the cells in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS, cells were an-
alyzed by flow cytometry.
t cell culture and treatment conditions
T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 
with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomy-
cin. RSV (R5010; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 25 or 50 µM 
for 48 h. FoxO1 inhibitor AS1842856 (344355; Calbiochem) 
was used at 25, 50, or 100 nM for 48 h. MG132 (M7449; 
 
Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 20 µM for 6 h. Nicotinamide ribo-
side was obtained from A.A. Sauve’s lab (Weill Cornell Medi-
cal College, New 
Y
ork, NY) and used at 0.5 or 1 µM for 48 h.
t cell transduction using crI 
SPr cas9–rnP nucleofection
CD8+ T cells, enriched as described under the Human do-
nors and T cell population sorting section, were activated 
with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 µg/ml) and soluble an-
ti-CD28 (5 µg/ml) for 48 h before nucleofection. Electro-
poration was performed using the Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 
96-well Nucleofector kit and 4D-Nucleofecter (Lonza). 
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein with a double nuclear 
localization tag at the C terminus was obtained from QB3 
MacroLab (University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, 
CA). CRI 
SPR RNA (crRNA) for SIRT1 was designed to 
target all known isoforms and exons while avoiding single 
nucleotide polymorphisms, and the associated trans-activat-
ing crRNA (tracrRNA) were chemically synthesized (IDT). 
Mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1, crRNA and tracrRNA were 
incubated for 30 min at 37°C to generate 40 µM hybrids. 
An equal volume of 40 µM Cas9-NLS was carefully added 
to the duplexes and incubated for 15 min at 37°C, yielding 
a 20 µM Cas9–RNP complex mixture. For each reaction, 
1–3 × 105 T cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 µl P3 
buffer (Lonza). 4 µl of 20 µM Cas9–RNP mix was added 
directly to these cells, and the entire volume was quickly 
transferred to the 96-well reaction cuvette. Cells were elec-
troporated with the Amaxa 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza). Im-

58
mediately after nucleofection, 80 µl of prewarmed, complete 
RPMI was added to each reaction, and the cells were al-
lowed to recover for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then restim-
ulated using the human T Cell Activation/Expansion kit 
(Miltenyi) and 80 U/ml of human IL-2.
Purification of recombinant SIrt1 protein
In short, 293T cells were transfected at 70–80% con-
fluency with a Flag-SIRT1 vector using calcium phos-
phate. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS 
and harvested in CelLytic M buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) sup-
plemented with HALT protease/phosphatase inhibitors 
(ThermoFisher) before affinity purification using the Flag 
M Purification kit (CEL 
LMM2; Sigma-Aldrich) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified protein was 
kept in wash buffer (50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl) at 
−80°C until further use.
t cell nucleofection with recombinant SIrt1 protein
Approximately 3 × 105 resting CD8+ 
T cells and recombinant 
SIRT1 (1 µM final concentration) were mixed in 20 µl P3 
buffer before quickly being transferred into a 96-well reac-
tion cuvette (Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 96-well Nucleofector 
kit). Cells were electroporated as described under the T cell 
transduction . . . section and recovered in complete RPMI for 
18 h before being processed for Western blotting.
Metabolic assays
OCR and ECAR were determined using a Seahorse XF96 
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). The in-
strument was a gift from the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation to 
the Gladstone Institutes. Resting or 3-h anti-CD3–activated 
T cells (5 × 105 per well) were seeded onto Cell-Tak–coated 
wells (354240; Corning) in nonbuffered RPMI 1640 me-
dium (R1383; Sigma-Aldrich), glucose depleted or supple-
mented with 11 mM glucose and 2 mM sodium pyruvate. 
Measurements were obtained under basal conditions and 
after adding 1 µM oligomycin, 0.5 µM FCCP
, 0.5 µM rote-
none/antimycin A (103015-100; Seahorse Bioscience), and 
2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) at a final well concentration of 
50 mM (Agilent Technologies). Lactate measurements were 
detected using the primary metabolism screen conducted 
by the West Coast Metabolomics Center. In brief, sorted 
T cell populations were treated with 1 µM oligomycin and 
harvested at various times (0, 15, and 60 min). Samples were 
run on a mass spectrometer (ALEX-CIS GC-TOF; GER 
STEL), and metabolites were quantified by peak heights 
and reported by retention index, quantification mass, bio-
chemical database identifiers, and full mass spectra. Refer 
to Fiehn et al. (2008) for further details regarding data ac-
quisition and processing.
Microarray and IPA
CD8+CD28+ and CD8+CD28– T cells were sorted from 
three human donors, and total RNA was extracted using the 
RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Microarray experiments were performed 
using the Affymetrix platform, and 159 significant genes 
were identified using a cutoff of ≥1.0 log2 fold change and 
≤0.05 FDR (adjusted p-value). Using IPA software on the 
differentially expressed genes, a list of possible upstream 
regulators was generated based on the literature compiled in 
the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Refer to the manufacturer’s 
website (http 
://www 
.ingenuity 
.com) for further details. The 
complete array datasets can be viewed in the GEO database 
(accession no. GSE105150).
cell viability
Using the alamarBlue Cell Viability Assay (88951; Thermo-
Fisher), cells were incubated with alamarBlue reagent, and the 
percent reagent reduction was calculated according the man-
ufacturer’s instructions.
rnA extraction and qrt-Pcr
Total RNA from samples was extracted using the RNeasy 
Plus Mini kit (74136; Qiagen). cDNA was generated using 
50–500 ng of total RNA with Superscript III Reverse tran-
scription (18080-044; ThermoFisher) and oligo(dT)12-18 
(18418-012; ThermoFisher). The SYBR green qPCR re-
actions contained 5 µl of 2× Maxima SYBR green/Rox 
qPCR Master Mix (K0221; ThermoFisher), 5 µl of diluted 
cDNA, and 1 nmol of both forward and reverse prim-
ers. The reactions were run using the following condi-
tions: 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 
40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s. See Table S2 
for a qRT-PCR primer list.
Western blot
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buf-
fer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented 
with protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 
min at 4°C, or subcellular fractions were extracted using 
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents 
(78835; ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer for 
SDS-PAGE. For chemiluminescent detection, we used en-
hanced luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate (ECL) 
and ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham).
Antibodies
The following primary antibodies were used: SIRT1 
(ab104833; Abcam; 8469S; Cell Signaling T
echnology), 
SIRT6 (12486; Cell Signaling T
echnology), SIRT7 (5360; 
Cell Signaling T
echnology), β-actin (A5316; Sigma-Aldrich), 
FoxO1 (2880S; Cell Signaling T
echnology), Sp1 (sc-14027; 
Santa Cruz), CD25-APC (17-0259-42; Affymetrix eBiosci-
ence), and CD69-APC (310910; BioLegend). For mass spec-
trometry analysis, a total anti-acetyllysine antibody was used 
(ICP0388-2MG; ImmuneChem).

Mass spectrometry analysis
Acetyllysine-containing peptides were enriched from cellular 
lysates as previously described (Downey et al., 2015). Analysis 
was performed in technical duplicates on an Orbitrap Fusion 
mass spectrometry system (Easy nLC 1200 ultra performance 
liquid chromatography with Nanospray Flex; ThermoFisher). 
Samples were injected on a C18 reverse phase column (25 
cm × 75 µm packed with ReprosilPur C18 AQ 1.9-µm par-
ticles). Peptides were separated by an organic gradient from 
5 to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 120 min at a 
flow rate of 300 nl/min. The mass spectometer continuously 
acquired spectra in a data-dependent manner throughout the 
gradient, acquiring a full scan in the Orbitrap (at 120,000 res-
olution with an automatic gain control target of 200,000 and 
a maximum injection time of 100 ms), followed by as many 
tandem mass spectrometry scans as could be acquired on the 
most abundant ions in 3 s in the dual linear ion trap (rapid 
scan type with an intensity threshold of 5,000, higher-energy 
collisional dissociation energy of 29%, automatic gain control 
target of 10,000, a maximum injection time of 35 ms, and an 
isolation width of 1.6 m/z). Dynamic exclusion was enabled 
with a repeat count of 1, an exclusion duration of 20 s, and an 
exclusion mass width of ±10 ppm.
Raw mass spectrometry data were assigned to human 
protein sequences, and MS1 intensities were extracted with 
the MaxQuant software package (version 1.5.5.1; Cox and 
Mann, 2008). Data were searched against the SwissProt 
human protein database (downloaded on January 11, 2016). 
Variable modifications were allowed for N-terminal protein 
acetylation, methionine oxidation, and lysine acetylation. A 
static modification was indicated for carbamidomethyl cyste-
ine. The Match between runs feature was enabled to match 
within 2 min between runs. All other settings were left using 
MaxQuant default settings.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons for two groups were calculated using a paired 
(comparing populations derived from the same donor) two-
tailed Student’s t test. Comparisons for more than two groups 
were calculated using one-way ANO 
VA, followed by Tukey’s 
multiple comparison tests. Data are presented as mean ± SD 
for technical replicates or mean ± SEM for biological repli-
cates. Statistical significance is indicated in all figures by the 
following annotations: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 
0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.
