CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) -
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating web-
based and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, electronic 
games (incl multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and other interactive 
and/or networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all subitems under item 5 - 
description of the intervention) may also be applicable for other study designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be  
a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs,  
b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in the 
Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scienti�c societies endorsing the 
checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT (non-pharmacologic 
treatment) items.  
Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clari�cations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that you 
also RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
THE CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *.  
In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - 
please include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS,  
or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on why 
the item was not relevant for this study. 
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS  A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION IN 
JMIR AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED). 
Please �ll in these questions diligently. Information will not be copyedited, so please use proper 
spelling and grammar, use correct capitalization, and avoid abbreviations.

Woebot is a fully automated chatbot that we designed as an intervention for 
participants. However, a therapist consistently checked participants' 
conversations to intervene in case of adverse events or active suicidality.

METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. of�ine), e.g., from an open access website or from a
clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based trial,
or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say if
outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In traditional
of�ine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the researchers and
participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use “blinded” or “unblinded”
to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials usually refers to “open
access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what the main paper is reporting.

Describe the problem and the type of system/solution that is object of the study: intended as stand-alone
intervention vs. incorporated in broader health care program? Intended for a particular patient population?
Goals of the intervention, e.g., being more cost-effective to other interventions, replace or complement other
solutions? (Note: Details about the intervention are provided in “Methods” under 5)

Internet interventions for anxiety and depression have empirical support 
with outcomes comparable to therapist­delivered CBT. Our objective was to 
"assess the feasibility of delivering CBT in a conversational interface via an 
automated bot in a way that facilitates engagement and reduction in 
symptoms".

viewpoint is the study performed, potential impact of �ndings [2]. Brie�y justify the choice of the

We hypothesized that conversation with a therapeutic process­oriented 
conversational agent would lead to greater improvement in symptoms, and 
that receiving psychoeducational material in a conversational manner 
would be more acceptable to those who received it when compared to an 
Informational Control group.

After the study commenced, we noticed an influx of fake spam bot 
registrations. Thus, "to guard against compromise e.g., from malicious 
bots, all potential participants were sent an email requesting that they 
respond denoting their confirmation."
3b-i) Bug �xes, Downtimes, Content Changes
Bug �xes, Downtimes, Content Changes: ehealth systems are often dynamic systems. A description of
changes to methods therefore also includes important changes made on the intervention or comparator
during the trial (e.g., major bug �xes or changes in the functionality or content) (5-iii) and other “unexpected
events” that may have in�uenced study design such as staff changes, system failures/downtimes, etc. [2].

Participants were recruited "using a flyer posted on social media websites 
targeting a US university community". This was a purely web­based trial 
with no face­to­face components. Participants were anonymous, though 
email address was used for confirmation and for payment purposes. We

Information given during recruitment. Specify how participants were briefed for recruitment and in the

The Life Ninja project was founded in July 2016 as a company building 
evidence­based innovative scaleable mental health services for young 
people.  They began creating psychologically­themed video games, and 
created a  conversational agent that was highly popular among an initial 
cohort of college students.

"In the case of individuals disclosing suicidal ideation or self­harm (n=2), 
Woebot sent a link to an evidence­based free app based on attention 
retraining principals "tec­tec" (http://tectectech.com/) that was designed to 
help individuals feel better about themselves and worse about self­harm

"Univariate ANCOVA revealed a significant treatment effect on depression 
revealing that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced PHQ­9 
score while those in the information control group did not (F1, 48 = 6.03; 
p=.01) (see Figure 2). This represented a moderate between­groups effect 
size (.44).  This effect is robust after Bonferonni correction for multiple 
comparisons (p=.04)." 
 
These results are reflected in Table 2.

In addition to primary/secondary (clinical) outcomes, the presentation of process outcomes such as

While this study suggests that certain process variables normally 
demonstrated in a traditional therapeutic relationship were present here 
after 2 weeks, future research should explore this question empirically, 
adopting a standardized instrument such as the Working Alliance Inventory 
to replicate the work of Bickmore and colleagues.
20) Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias,
imprecision, and, if relevant, multiplicity of analyses
20-i) Typical limitations in ehealth trials
Typical limitations in ehealth trials: Participants in ehealth trials are rarely blinded. Ehealth trials often look
at a multiplicity of outcomes, increasing risk for a Type I error. Discuss biases due to non-use of the
intervention/usability issues, biases through informed consent procedures, unexpected events.

that created the intervention (“Woebot”) that is the subject of this trial and
