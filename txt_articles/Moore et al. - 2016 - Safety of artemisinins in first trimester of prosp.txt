Summary
Background Artemisinins, the most eff
 ective antimalarials available, are not recommended for falciparum malaria 
during the fi
 rst trimester of pregnancy because of safety concerns. Therefore, quinine is used despite its poor 
eff
 ectiveness. Assessing artemisinin safety requires weighing the risks of malaria and its treatment. We aimed to 
assess the eff
 ect of fi
 rst-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on miscarriage and major congenital 
malformations.
Methods In this observational study, we assessed data from antenatal clinics on the Thai–Myanmar border between 
Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013. We included women who presented to antenatal clinics during their fi
 rst trimester with 
a viable fetus. Women were screened for malaria, and data on malaria, antimalarial treatment, and birth outcomes 
were collected. The relationship between artemisinin treatments (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, or artemether) and 
miscarriage or malformation was assessed using Cox regression with left-truncation and time-varying exposures.
Findings Of 55 636 pregnancies registered between 1994 and 2013, 25 485 pregnancies were analysed for fi
 rst-trimester 
malaria and miscarriage, in which 2558 (10%) had fi
 rst-trimester malaria. The hazard of miscarriage increased 
1·61-fold after an initial fi
 rst-trimester falciparum episode (95% CI 1·32–1·97; p<0·0001), 3·24-fold following 
falciparum recurrence (2·24–4·68; p<0·0001), and 2·44-fold (1·01–5·88; p=0·0473) following recurrent symptomatic 
vivax malaria. No diff
 erence was noted in miscarriage in fi
 rst-line falciparum treatments with artemisinin (n=183) 
versus quinine (n=842; HR 0·78 [95% CI 0·45–1·34]; p=0·3645) or in risk of major congenital malformations 
(two [2%] of 109 [95% CI 0·22–6·47] versus eight (1%) of 641 [0·54–2·44], respectively).
Interpretation First-trimester falciparum and vivax malaria both increase the risk of miscarriage. We noted no evidence of 
an increased risk of miscarriage or of major congenital malformations associated with fi
 rst-line treatment with an 
artemisinin derivative compared with quinine. In view of the low effi
  cacy of quinine and wide availability of highly eff
 ective 
artemisinin-based combination therapies, it is time to reconsider fi
 rst-trimester antimalarial treatment recommendations.

Introduction
The associations between fi
 rst-trimester malaria, treatment, 
and miscarriage remain poorly documented because these 
events often occur before women present to antenatal 
care.1,2 A single fi
 rst-trimester malaria episode is associated 
with miscarriage,3 and women with fi
 rst-trimester malaria 
who are not adequately treated are at high risk of placental 
malaria.4 Because women are usually not protected by 
preventive interventions until the second trimester,3 early 
diagnosis and eff
 ective treatment of fi
 rst-trimester malaria 
are essential to limit the deleterious eff
 ects of malaria.5
Artemisinin derivatives (hereafter referred to as 
artemisinins) are the most eff
 ective antimalarials available. 
Artemi 
sinin-based combination therapies are recom-
mended by the WHO for fi
 rst-line treatment of falciparum 
malaria, except during the fi
 rst trimester of pregnancy.6 
Animal studies have raised concerns about the safety of 
artemisinins in the fi
 rst trimester, but data for human 
beings are scarce. In animals, artemisinins are embryotoxic 
and 
teratogenic 
because 
they 
deplete 
embryonic 
erythroblasts, causing miscarriage and congenital malfor-
mations 
(mainly 
cardiovascular 
and 
skeletal).7 
If 
artemisinins are also embryotoxic or teratogenic in human 
beings, the embryo-sensitive period is predicted to be 
between 6 weeks’ and 13 weeks’ gestation when 
erythroblasts are the primary form of circulating red blood 
cells.8 Because of these safety concerns, quinine is still 
recommended for uncomplicated fi
 rst-trimester falciparum 
malaria rather than artemisinins, despite being an inferior 
treatment.6 Available data for fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
safety comes from observational studies of inadvertent 
treatments, which are common but rarely documented.2 
No specifi
 c adverse eff
 ects have been noted in human 
beings in 935 documented fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
treatments (appendix p 1),9–18 which although reassuring, 
has 
not 
been 
suffi
  cient 
to 
change 
treatment 
recommendations.6
The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) screens 
pregnant women frequently for malaria because there are 
no eff
 ective preventive interventions (appendix p 3).19

Since 1986, prospective data have been collected on 
confi
 rmed malaria infections, antimalarial treatment, 
and pregnancy outcomes of women attending SMRU 
antenatal clinics, providing an important source of 
observational evidence on fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
safety. In this setting, a single fi
 rst-trimester malaria 
episode (falciparum or vivax) increased the odds of 
miscarriage, but fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatment 
was not associated with miscarriage.3 However, for 
analytic clarity in this earlier study women with recurrent 
infections were excluded, which reduced the number of 
artemisinin treatments to 44 and overestimated the eff
 ect 
of malaria, because a recurrent infection in pregnancy 
depends on the fetus surviving the initial infection. Here, 
we extend this seminal study by including women with 
recurrent malaria, which might be either novel, 
recrudescent, or a relapse in the case of vivax malaria, and 
added 3 further years of data. Assessment of the safety of 
artemisinins requires weighing the risks of malaria and 
its treatment. Therefore, we sought to assess the eff
 ect of 
both fi
 rst-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on 
miscarriage and major congenital malformations.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this observational study, we assessed data from 
antenatal clinics on the Thai–Myanmar border between 
Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013. We included women who 
presented to antenatal clinics during their fi
 rst trimester 
with a viable fetus. Women were screened for malaria, 
and data for malaria, antimalarial treatment, and birth 
outcomes were collected. The Oxford Tropical Research 
Ethics Committee granted ethical approval for audits of 
SMRU clinical records (OXTREC 28-09), and the Tak 
Province Community Ethics Advisory Board provided 
local permission (T-CAB-4/1/2015). Data for fi
 rst-trimester 
malaria from some of the records included in this analysis 
have been published previously.3,19–22
Procedures
At SMRU antenatal clinics, women are encouraged to 
present early and return weekly throughout their 
pregnancy for malaria screening, consisting of a fi
 nger-
prick blood sample that is examined by trained 
microscopists using Giemsa stained thick and thin blood 
fi
 lms (appendix p 3).5 Women are also encouraged to 
present if they feel unwell, and to deliver at SMRU 
clinics. The fi
 rst consultation involves taking obstetric 
and medical histories, a detailed clinical examination, 
and gestational age estimation.23 With each positive 
screen, 
information 
about 
species, 
parasitaemia, 
symptoms, and treatment are recorded. Women are also 
asked about recent antimalarial treatments at out-
patient 
clinics, 
and 
these 
treatments

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Scopus and PubMed for articles published up to Oct 5, 
2015, in any language, that addressed the association between 
fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatment and miscarriage using the 
search terms: “malaria or plasmodium”, “pregnan*”, “*artemisinin* 
OR ACT* OR artesunate OR artemether OR Coartem”, 
“fi
 rst-trimester OR ‘fi
 rst trimester’ OR ‘early pregnancy’”, and 
“miscarriage* OR abortion”. One study reported on the association 
between a single fi
 rst-trimester malaria episode and miscarriage. 
No randomised controlled trials of fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
treatment were identifi
 ed. No studies have reported on the 
association between recurrent fi
 rst-trimester malaria and 
miscarriage. Ten observational studies of fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
treatment were identifi
 ed totalling 935 documented treatments, 
and a systematic review published in 2007. These studies showed 
no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or major congenital 
malformations associated with fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
treatment. Importantly, only one published study examining the 
association between fi
 rst-line artemisinin treatment and 
miscarriage accounted for left truncation, which is necessary when 
women present at varying gestations due to the declining risk of 
miscarriage as a pregnancy progresses, and few were able to 
account for confounding by indication and disease severity.
Added value of this study
Assessment of the safety of artemisinin derivatives requires 
weighing the risks of falciparum malaria against those of its 
treatment. We noted that fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria 
increases the risk of miscarriage, especially after recurrence. 
However, there was no evidence that fi
 rst-line treatment with 
an artemisinin derivative in the fi
 rst trimester was associated 
with an increased risk of miscarriage or congenital 
malformations compared with fi
 rst-line quinine, which is 
currently recommended by the WHO. We compared fi
 rst-line 
treatment with an artemisinin derivative with fi
 rst-line 
quinine in women with fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria in 
an area of low seasonal transmission, and accounted for 
confounding by indication and disease severity, thereby 
separating the eff
 ects of infection from the eff
 ects of 
treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst 
to estimate the association between recurrent fi
 rst-trimester 
malaria and miscarriage, and contributes a further 
183 documented fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatments. Left 
truncation, which adjusts for the temporally changing risks of 
miscarriage and varying gestation at presentation, was also 
accounted for and is essential to avoid signifi
 cant bias.
Implications of all the available evidence
Eff
 ective treatment of fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria is 
imperative. Our results add to a growing body of observational 
evidence that artemisinins, the most eff
 ective antimalarials 
available, are safe in the fi
 rst trimester of pregnancy.

mefl
 oquine–artesunate [MAS] for P falciparum) are 
recorded retrospectively. Presumptive malaria treatment 
is not used, and pregnancy termination is unavailable.
First-trimester non-malaria febrile morbidity was 
defi
 ned as fever (temperature ≥37·5oC) not associated 
with malaria. Malaria was defi
 ned as the presence of 
asexual stages of plasmodia parasites in the peripheral 
blood, counted per 500 white blood cells or 1000 red blood 
cells. Hyperparasitaemia was defi
 ned as 4% parasitaemia 
or greater, and severe malaria was defi
 ned according to 
signs of vital organ dysfunction. Symptomatic malaria 
was defi
 ned as patent parasitaemia and a history of fever 
(past 48 h) or temperature 37·5oC or greater. Vivax malaria 
was treated with oral chloroquine. Falciparum malaria 
was treated with oral quinine in the fi
 rst trimester, or an 
artemisinin-based treatment in the second and third 
trimester (either artesunate, artemether–lumefantrine, 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, or mefl
 oquine–arte-
sunate). Mefl
 oquine monotherapy was given for 
falciparum malaria until 1996. Clindamycin was added to 
quinine and artesunate 7-day treatments in 2007 to 
augment effi
  cacy. According to WHO recommendations, 
artemisinins were given in the fi
 rst trimester for quinine 
failures, hyperparasitaemia, severe malaria, or if the fetus 
was no longer viable.6 Details on treatment regimens and 
drug manufacturers are given in the appendix (p 4).
Outcomes
Primary exposures were malaria and fi
 rst-line artemisinin 
treatment in the fi
 rst trimester, defi
 ned as less than 
14 weeks’ gestation. The primary outcome was miscarriage, 
defi
 ned as fetal death before 28 weeks’ gestation because 
infant respiratory support is unavailable. The ability to 
determine gestation and fetal viability at SMRU improved 
after ultrasound was introduced in 2002 (appendix p 3).23,24 
The date of miscarriage was recorded consistently as the 
date of expulsion of the uterine contents, either 
spontaneously or through surgical intervention, which 
can occur some time after intrauterine death. The 
secondary outcome was major congenital malformations. 
A surface examination was done on all newborns by 
trained staff
 ; a physician verifi
 ed all malformations, except 
for some early neonatal deaths. Artemisinin-based 
treatments were fi
 rst deployed in the general population 
in 1994. Therefore, we included women who presented to 
antenatal clinics during their fi
 rst trimester with a viable 
fetus between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013.
Statistical analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards models accounting for 
left truncation (appendix p 5) and time-varying exposures 
for all miscarriage analyses, with censoring at the gestation 
time of miscarriage, gestation time when last seen, or 
28 weeks’ gestation. To assess the association between 
malaria and miscarriage, women entered the analysis at 
the gestation time of their fi
 rst antenatal visit. Multivariable 
models adjusted for year of fi
 rst consultation, gravidity, 
smoking, 
and 
fi
 rst-trimester 
non-malaria 
febrile 
morbidity. To assess the association between fi
 rst-line 
artemisinin treatment and miscarriage (primary analysis), 
we included women with fi
 rst-trimester falciparum 
malaria, and compared fi
 rst-line quinine treatment 
(including quinine plus clindamycin) with fi
 rst-line 
mefl
 oquine monotherapy, artemisinin treatment (all 
derivatives) following quinine failure (ie, artemisinin 
rescue), 
and 
fi
 rst-line 
artemisinin 
treatment 
(all 
derivatives). Women entered the analysis at the gestation 
time of their fi
 rst falciparum malaria episode. Treatments 
given after determination of fetal non-viability were 
excluded. Multivariable models adjusted for year of fi
 rst 
consultation, disease severity pertaining to the fi
 rst 
falciparum malaria episode (asymptomatic, symptomatic, 
or hyperparasitaemic or severe), and fi
 rst-trimester non-
malaria febrile morbidity. The prevalence of major 
congenital malformation was described by fi
 rst-trimester 
falciparum malaria and fi
 rst-line treatment. Malformations 
were grouped by organ system to increase the likelihood 
of detecting teratogenic signals.25 Data were analysed with 
Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Results
Between Jan 1, 1994 and Dec 31, 2013, 55 636 pregnant 
women presented to SMRU clinics, of whom 25 485 (46%) 
presented during their fi
 rst trimester with a viable fetus 
(fi
 gure 1). Of these, 2257 (10%) of 23 118 miscarried, 2367 
(9%) of 25 485 were lost to follow-up before 28 weeks 
gestation, and 2558 (10%) of 25 485 had fi
 rst-trimester 
malaria (fi
 gure 1). Women with fi
 rst-trimester malaria 
were more likely to miscarry or be lost to follow-up and 
tended to present for antenatal care earlier, be younger, 
be primigravid, and smoke compared with women 
without fi
 rst-trimester malaria (all p<0·0001; table 1).
Of the 2558 women with fi
 rst-trimester malaria, 
1207 (47%) had falciparum malaria, 1532 (60%) had vivax 
malaria, and 181 (7%) had both vivax and falciparum 
(either separate or mixed infections). Recurrent fi
 rst-
trimester falciparum malaria occurred in 162 (13%) of 
1207 women, and recurrent fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria in 
139 (9%) of 1532. Most (971 [80%] of 1207) women with 
fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria were treated initially 
with quinine and 183 (15%) of 1207 were treated initially 
with artemisinin (ie, fi
 rst-line artemisinin treatment; 
table 1). Of the 971 women who received fi
 rst-line quinine 
treatment, 129 (13%) were rescued with artemisinin 
(usually artesunate monotherapy or artesunate plus 
clindamycin) following recurrence. Of the 183 fi
 rst-line 
artemisinin treatments, 37 (20%) were for hyper-
parasitaemia (administered orally) or severe disease 
(administered parenterally). First-line treatment of fi
 rst-
trimester falciparum malaria occurred at a median of 
8·2 gestation weeks (IQR 5·3–11·1). Loss to follow-up was 
similar between antimalarial treatment groups, except 
women receiving mefl
 oquine–artesunate were less likely 
to be lost (p=0·0417; appendix p 6). Rates of falciparum 
malaria during pregnancy and miscarriage and the 
frequency of fi
 rst-line quinine and artemisinin treatments 
in fi
 rst trimester over time are shown in fi
 gure 2.
Of 1207 women with fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria, 
165 (17% of 983 followed until 28 weeks’) miscarried and 
224 (19%) were lost to follow-up compared with 1963 (9%) 
of 20 978 and 1949 (9%) of 22 927 in women with no fi
 rst-
trimester malaria, respectively. In multivariable analyses, 
the hazard of miscarriage increased 1·61-fold (95% CI 
1·32–1·97; p<0·0001) with an initial fi
 rst-trimester 
falciparum malaria episode, and 3·24-fold (2·24–4·68; 
p<0·0001) with recurrent fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria 
(fi
 gure 3). This association was stronger in women with 
symptomatic falciparum malaria than in women with 
asymptomatic falciparum malaria (fi
 gure 2). A single 
fi
 rst-trimester hyperparasitaemic or severe falciparum 
malaria episode increased the hazard of miscarriage 
4·21-fold (95% CI 2·43–7·29; p<0·0001; fi
 gure 3). An initial 
fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria episode, either asymptomatic 
or symptomatic, increased the hazard of miscarriage 
slightly (fi
 gure 3). Recurrent symptomatic fi
 rst-trimester 
vivax malaria increased the hazard of miscarriage 2·44-fold 
(95% CI 1·01–5·88; p=0·0473; fi
 gure 3).
Of the 1207 women with fi
 rst-trimester falciparum 
malaria, 1179 (98%) had a known fi
 rst-line antimalarial 
treatment and a viable fetus at the time of treatment 
(fi

Figure 3: Association between initial and recurrent fi
 rst-trimester malaria and miscarriage
Models include women lost to follow-up before 28 weeks (until gestation time last seen), but percentage calculations for delivered or miscarried do not. Models for 
falciparum malaria (1–4) include women that might have also had fi
 rst-trimester vivax, malariae, or ovale malaria. See appendix p 8 for associations in women with only 
fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria. Models for vivax malaria (5–6) exclude women who also had fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria. Models 2 and 5 exclude women with 
symptomatic malaria. Models 3 and 6 exclude women with asymptomatic infections. Model 4 excludes women with uncomplicated infections. Models were adjusted for 
year (by stratifi
 cation due to non-proportional hazards [p<0·001]), gravidity, current smoking status, and non-malaria febrile morbidity in fi
 rst trimester. Age and 
previous miscarriage were omitted from multivariable models due to collinearity with gravidity. Adjusted results for gravidity, current smoking status, and febrile 
morbidity in fi
 rst trimester are shown from Model 1. 146 women had recurrent fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria (136 had two and ten had three episodes). 13 women 
had recurrent (two) asymptomatic fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria. 81 women had recurrent symptomatic fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria (75 had two, and six had 
three episodes). 17 women had recurrent (two episodes) asymptomatic fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria, and none miscarried. 38 women had recurrent (two) symptomatic 
fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria. See appendix p 8 for a table version of this fi
 gure, including univariable associations.

quinine (including quinine plus clindamycin), 129 (11%) 
of 1179 received fi
 rst-line quinine followed by artemisinin 
(artemisinin rescue), 25 (2%) of 1179 received fi
 rst-line 
mefl
 oquine monotherapy, and 183 (16%) of 1179 received 
fi
 rst-line artemisinin. First-line artemisinin treatment 
was not associated with miscarriage when compared with 
women who received fi
 rst-line quinine only (HR 0·78 
[95% CI 0·45–1·34]; p=0·3645; fi
 gure 4). Five (3%) of 
183 women received two fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin 
treatments; one miscarried, and four delivered.
Because animal studies suggest a theoretical embryo-
sensitive window in human beings of 6–13 weeks’ 
gestation, we also estimated the association between 
fi
 rst-line artemisinin treatment and miscarriage before, 
during, and after this window.9 First-line artemisinin 
treatments before the embryo-sensitive window were 
associated with a non-signifi
 cant decrease in the hazard 
of miscarriage (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·25– 1·15]; p=0·1108), 
whereas treatments during the embryo-sensitive window 
were not associated with a changed hazard of miscarriage 
(1·15 [0·46–2·87]; p=0·7602; fi
 gure 4).
Of note, a high proportion of women who received fi
 rst-
line mefl
 oquine–artesunate miscarried (15 [21%] of 71), 
and most miscarriages in the artemisinin treatment group 
(15 [63%] of 23) were in women who received mefl
 oquine–
artesunate specifi
 cally. Further, a third of women who 
received mefl
 oquine–artesunate during the embryo-
sensitive window miscarried (eight [33%] of 24). However, 
this might be explained by the circumstances of this 
treatment: women received mefl
 oquine–artesunate from 
outpatient clinics (rather than antenatal clinics) where they 
presented because of illness before they became aware of 
their pregnancy. Additionally, mefl
 oquine–artesunate 
treat 
ments at outpatient clinics were given at earlier 
gestations than for the other treatments when women are 
at greater risk of miscarriage (mefl
 oquine–artesunate: 
3·8 weeks [IQR 1·9–7·4]; quinine: 10·1 [7·5–11·8]; other 
artemisinins: 12·4 [9·0– 13·3]; appendix p 7).
20 628 women presented for antenatal care between 1994 
and 2013 and gave birth to a singleton newborn, of whom 
175 (1%) of 20 628 (95% CI 0·73–0·98) had newborns with 
a major congenital malformation (fi
 gure 1). The prevalence 
of congenital malformations in the newborn babies of 
women with no fi
 rst-trimester malaria was 0·84% 
(158/18 803 [95% CI 0·71–0·98]; table 2). The prevalence of 
congenital malformations was similar in the newborns of 
women with fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria (0·59% [95% CI 
0·22–1·27]). In the newborn babies of women with 
uncomplicated 
fi
 rst-trimester 
falciparum 
malaria, 
malformation prevalence was slightly higher (1·29% 
[10/773]; [95% CI 0·62–2·37]), but did not diff
 er between 
the newborn of women who received fi
 rst-line quinine 
(1·25% [8/641; [95% CI 0·54–2·44]) and those of women 
who received fi
 rst-line artemisinin (2/109 [microphthalmia; 
imperforate anus]; 1·83% [95% CI 0·22–6·47]; p=0·7551; 
table 2). Two other newborns of mothers who had 
hyperparasitaemic or severe fi
 rst-trimester falciparum 
malaria had a malformation (syndactyly; cleft lip and palate; 
9·09% [2/22]; [95% CI 1·12–29·16]); both were of mothers

Discussion
First-trimester falciparum malaria increases the risk of 
miscarriage, especially after recurrence, but this large 
prospective observational study found no evidence that 
fi
 rst-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative was 
associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or 
congenital malformations. Assessment of the safety of 
artemisinin treatment during pregnancy requires 
weighing the risks of falciparum malaria against those of 
its treatment. This is the fi
 rst study to estimate the eff
 ects 
of initial and recurrent fi
 rst-trimester malaria, its 
symptomatology, and its treatment on miscarriage.
Legitimate ethical concerns regarding randomised-
controlled trials of fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatment 
have meant that only observational studies have been 
done to date, and these have not adjusted for confounding 
by indication and disease severity in assessing risks and 
benefi
 ts.26 A major strength of this study is that it was 
possible to adjust for these important confounders by 
comparing with nearly 1000 women who received 
quinine treatment (appendix p 5). Left truncation, which 
adjusts for the temporally changing risks of miscarriage 
and varying gestation at presentation, was also accounted 
for since this is essential to avoid bias.27 Nevertheless, 
this study still has limitations common to observational 
designs. Data were collected over a long period of time, 
relatively few fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatments 
were given, toxicities other than miscarriage and major 
mal 
formations 
detectable 
at 
birth 
from 
surface 
examination were not captured, and all artemisinin 
derivatives were analysed together. Several associations 
of considerable magnitude had wide CIs that crossed 
null, and we cannot rule out potential confounding 
eff
 ects of time and unmeasured variables, or residual 
confounding by disease severity. Furthermore, women 
with fi
 rst-trimester malaria were more likely to be lost to 
follow-up, raising the possibility of informative right 
censoring, but this would underestimate the eff
 ect of 
malaria (appendix p 5).
We noted no evidence that fi
 rst-line treatment with an 
artemisinin derivative increased the rate of miscarriage 
compared with fi
 rst-line treatment with quinine. There 
was a higher risk of miscarriage in women who received 
an artemisinin derivative during the putative embryo-
sensitive window, but this might be explained at least in 
part by the administration of mefl
 oquine–artesunate at 
earlier gestations to symptomatic women in the routine 
outpatient clinics compared with the active surveillance 
of antenatal clinics. In rats, embryotoxicity of artesunate 
was attenuated when co-administered with mefl
 oquine.28 
Primates, including human beings, might be less 
sensitive to the eff
 ects of artemisinins because of 
diff
 erences in placentation and the visceral yolk sac, 
which could result in diff
 erent levels of embryonic 
exposure to artemisinins.7,29 Additionally, a 3-day 
artemisinin regimen means that the exposure period is 
relatively short in human beings because organogenesis 
is 3 days in rats but 3 months in human beings.7,29 
Therefore, artemisinin-induced depletion of embryonic 
erythro 
blasts severe enough to cause miscarriage in rats 
might not translate to human beings, but could still 
cause congenital malformations.
We cannot draw fi
 rm conclusions on the possible eff
 ects 
of fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatment on congenital 
malformations because of relatively small numbers of 
treatments and cases. Furthermore, the prevalence of 
major congenital malformations is most likely an 
underestimation because only those detectable at birth 
from surface examination and heart auscultation were 
recorded routinely, and major malformations (particularly 
cardiovascular) are often not detected or confi
 rmed until 
later in life. Only four newborns whose mother received 
fi
 rst-line artemisinin treatment during fi
 rst trimester had 
a major congenital malformation, and the organ systems 
involved were inconsistent with the types of malformations 
induced by artemisinins in animal studies.
These results have important implications for malaria 
treatment and control policies, and future studies of 
artemisinin safety. Recurrent fi
 rst-trimester vivax malaria 
is associated with miscarriage, yet radical cure is not 
possible during pregnancy with currently available drugs. 
First-trimester falciparum malaria is strongly associated 
with miscarriage, especially after recurrence. We noted 
no evidence of harm associated with fi
 rst-line artemisinin 
treatment of fi
 rst-trimester falciparum malaria. Quinine 
is comparatively poorly tolerated and associated with a 
shorter time to recurrence than artemisinin in pregnant 
women.30 Furthermore, women who received artemi-
sinins following quinine failure were more likely to 
miscarry than those who received fi
 rst-line artemisinin 
treatment. Early and eff
 ective antimalarial treatment is 
imperative, 
especially 
because 
current 
preventive 
measures do not adequately cover early pregnancy.3 
Artemisinins are the most eff
 ective antimalarials 
available and have been recommended as fi
 rst-line 
treatment in the general population by the WHO since 
2006. Yet, artemisinin safety in fi
 rst trimester is still a 
concern. This study contributes a further 183 well-
documented fi
 rst-trimester artemisinin treatments, and 
adds to a growing body of observational evidence 
supporting the use of artemisinins in the fi
 rst trimester 
of pregnancy.3,11,12,14–18,22,31 In view of the wide availability of 
artemisinin-based combination therapies, their excellent 
tolerability and effi
  cacy, the likely reduced future 
availability of quinine, and the rarity of congenital 
malformations, now might be the time to endorse the 
use of artemisinin derivatives for the treatment of fi
 rst-
trimester falciparum malaria, accompanied by robust 
pharmacovigilance.
