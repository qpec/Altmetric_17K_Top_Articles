Abstract
Background: Influenza A viruses cause life-threatening pneumonia and lung injury in the lower respiratory tract.
Application of high GM-CSF levels prior to infection has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from pathogenic
influenza infection in mice, but the mechanisms of protection and treatment efficacy have not been established.
Methods: Mice were infected intranasally with influenza A virus (PR8 strain). Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF were
induced in the airways using the double transgenic GM-CSF (DTGM) or littermate control mice starting on 3 days post-
infection (dpi). Assessment of respiratory mechanical parameters was performed using the flexiVent rodent ventilator.
RNA sequence analysis was performed on FACS-sorted airway macrophage subsets at 8 dpi.
Results: Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF conferred a survival benefit, arrested the deterioration of lung mechanics,
and reduced the abundance of protein exudates in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid to near baseline levels. Transcriptome
analysis, and subsequent validation ELISA assays, revealed that excess GM-CSF re-directs macrophages from an “M1-like”
to a more “M2-like” activation state as revealed by alterations in the ratios of CXCL9 and CCL17 in BAL fluid, respectively.
Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted that GM-CSF surplus during IAV infection elicits expression of anti-inflammatory
mediators and moderates M1 macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling by Type II interferon (IFN-γ).
Conclusions: Our data indicate that application of high levels of GM-CSF in the lung after influenza A virus infection
alters pathogenic “M1-like” macrophage inflammation. These results indicate a possible therapeutic strategy for respiratory
virus-associated pneumonia and acute lung injury.

Author summary
Using a transgenic mouse model where we can induce
GM-CSF in the airways (BAL levels approximately
300 pg/mL) of WT mice with doxycycline administra-
tion during active influenza infection, we achieve levels
of GM-CSF that prevent mortality from lethal influenza
A virus infection. The GM-CSF excess rescued mice
from an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like
illness
and
stabilized
lung
mechanical
parameters,
improved clearance of exudate protein, and discon-
nected M1 activation by type II IFNγ.
Background
Each year, influenza A virus (IAV) affects a significant
proportion of the population [1] and causes pathologic
changes both through direct cellular toxicity causing
desquamation, de-ciliation, and cell death, and through
indirect effects by stimulating an anti-viral immune

 response leading to collateral injury [2]. This combin-
ation can lead to an ARDS-like syndrome characterized
by increased capillary leak, oxygen diffusion difficulty
and ventilation/perfusion mismatch [1]. Immune strat-
egies that protect the host’s lung function while still
allowing for an adequate immune response to clear the
viral load and resolve virus-induced pneumonia are
needed. A number of pre-clinical studies have tested
prophylactic GM-CSF both as vaccine adjuvant and local
supplementation against IAV infection with encouraging
results [3–6].
The effect of local elevation of GM-CSF on IAV infec-
tion in the lung has been investigated in transgenic
models with expression of GM-CSF under the control of
constitutive or doxycycline-inducible promoters in lungs
of alveolar or small airway epithelial cells of GM-CSF
knockout (csf2−/−) mice [3, 4]. Differential effects on mor-
bidity and mortality from IAV infection in these studies
was associated with increased alveolar macrophage (AM)
numbers in the constitutive GM-CSF expression models
[3, 5] and AM differentiation in the GM-CSF-inducible
model [4]. Differential results on morbidity and survival
were also obtained after prolonged or brief administration
of supra-physiological levels of GM-CSF before or at the
onset of IAV infection [6].
The question of whether therapeutic administration of
GM-CSF to the airways after establishment of the infec-
tion would confer protection has never been addressed. In
this study we use a more clinically relevant model to
examine whether supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF in
the airways, induced after IAV infection at the peak of
virus replication, provided therapeutic benefit. Using GM-
CSF-inducible mice on the WT C57BL/6 genetic back-
ground we show that airway GM-CSF over-expression
starting at 3 days post infection (dpi) provides protection
from mortality and prevents the degeneration of multiple
lung mechanical properties. To examine the mechanism
of protection conferred by therapeutic GM-CSF levels, we
measured respiratory and biochemical parameters of
lower airway disease, and analyzed the transcriptome of
FACS-sorted AMs and exudative macrophages (EM) from
IAV-infected mice. Our findings demonstrate that GM-
CSF restores proteostasis of exudate proteins and redirects
responsiveness of AMs and EMs from an M1-like to an
M2-like activation state, and prevents mortality from
influenza-induced ARDS.
Methods
Animals and infections
The double transgenic GM-CSF (DTGM) mice were
bred as previously described [4], but this time on the
wild-type C57BL/6 J background. Littermate control
(LM) mice were defined as being single transgenic litter-
mates of DTGM mice that were only positive for the
SCGB1A1-rTA and thereby did not have the CMV-GM-
CSF gene, which may potentially be virally induced in
the absence of tetracycline (doxycycline) [7]. DTGM
mice and LM controls were exposed to 1 mg/mL doxy-
cycline in drinking water, and doxycycline-containing
drinking water was replenished every 2–3 days. Both
male and female mice were used for all experiments; all
mice were sex- and age-matched to control mice. The
influenza strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus was a
kind gift of Dr. Kevan Hartshorn, and was grown in the
chorio-allantoic fluid of ten (10) day old specific patho-
gen free avian supplies (SPAFAS) chicken eggs pur-
chased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA) and purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient
as previously described [8]. Mice were anesthetized with
ketamine/xylazine and intranasally (i.n.) infected with
IAV virus in 40 μL of PBS. Mice were infected in a BSL2
biosafety cabinet and housed within filter-top micro-
isolator cages in the Pulmonary Immunology and Physi-
ology (PIP) core, a BSL2 facility in the Department of
Comparative Medicine’s animal facility at Penn State
University College of Medicine. Mice were observed at
least twice daily during infections to assess morbidity
and mortality. Based on our experience at our facility in
the last 2 years and the variable clinical presentation of
the influenza infection, we used other metrics to moni-
tor morbidity in addition to mouse body weight curves
[9]. Mice that exhibited immobility, ruffled hair, and
labored breathing that had no chance of recovery, coin-
ciding with approximately 30% of body weight loss, were
euthanized by ketamine/xylazine overdose and cervical
dislocation, and counted as dead. Alternatively, mice
that were sleeping but had normal breathing and body
appearance, i.e., no ruffled hair or labored breathing,
reached up to 35-40% body weight loss and then began
to recover normally. Mice with favorable prognosis but
with 30% body weight loss or greater were provided
supportive care with food and hydrated gel packs at the
bottom of the cage. We have not found a pattern of clin-
ical disease specific to mouse genotype or gender in
untreated mice.
Mouse ventilation and the measurement of oxygen
saturation and lung mechanics
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (130 mg/kg
and 10 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). The trachea was cannu-
lated via tracheostomy with a 19G blunt needle and the
cannula was secured in place with a suture. Mice were
kept sedated using isoflurane inhalation (maintenance
dosing, 1-5% of inspired air) through the flexiVent and
were paralyzed with 1 mg/kg vecuronium i.p. Mice were
ventilated using baseline settings of positive end expira-
tory pressure (PEEP) 3 cm H2O, tidal volumes (Vt)
10 mL/kg, respiratory rate (RR) 150 breaths per minute

 (bpm) and an fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21.
Oxygen saturations were measured using the MouseOx
Plus pulse oximeter (Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA,
USA) via the thigh sensor. Lung mechanic parameters were
generated from the flexiVent rodent ventilator using the
forced oscillation technique as previously described [10].
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein measurements
BAL samples were collected as previously described, and
after centrifugation at 150 g for 10 min, BAL supernatants
were removed and immediately frozen at −80°C until
batch analysis. Proteins were measured with kits as
detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1. ELISA plate absorb-
ance was measured at 450 nm with a SpectraMax M2
UV/Vis/Fluorescence
96-384
plate
reader
(Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cytokines were measured by
ELISA as described above or by ProcartaPlex cytokine &
chemokine 36-plex mouse panel 1A (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) via Luminex Magpix multiplex array (Luminex).
Quantitative RT-PCR for IAV M1 copies per lung
After IAV infection, the entire lung was removed from each
mouse and placed in 2 mL of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, Waltham MA), weighed, homogenized on ice using a
polytron homogenizer for 15-30s intervals, and frozen in ali-
quots at -80 °C until RNA extraction. DNA was then
extracted using chloroform and RNA was precipitated using
isopropanol. Quantitative RT-PCR for IAV M1 copies per
lung was performed as previously described [11] using the
following primers: influenza A/8/Puerto Rico/34 M1 gene
sense: 5’-AAGACCAATCCTGTCACCTCTGA-3′ and anti-
sense: 5’ CAAAGCGTCT-ACGCTGCAGTC -3′ primers,

Flow cytometric cell surface staining and sorting
Single cell suspensions were prepared from BAL and lung
as described in Supplemental Methods. Single cell suspen-
sions from lung digests were placed at 4°C and then sur-
face stained in Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS)
with 3% FBS with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal
antibodies (Additional file 2: Table S2), and then stained
with a fixable viability dye. For FACS-sorting, BAL cells
were recovered and placed at 4°C and then surface stained
in Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) with 3% FBS
with
fluorochrome-conjugated
monoclonal
antibodies
(Additional file 2: Table S2) and 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AAD) was used to assess viability just prior to acquisi-
tion. All flow cytometric data were collected in the Penn
State Hershey Flow Cytometry Core Facility using an LSR
II (Becton Dickinson, BD) instrument, and all FACS-
sorting was performed using a FACSAria (BD) High Speed
cell sorter. Cells were sorted directly into RNA-Bee to
isolate RNA for further RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All
FACS data analysis was performed using FlowJo version
9.9 (Treestar, Mountain View, CA).
RNA preparation, library construction and sequencing
RNA was phase separated using chloroform and the aque-
ous phase containing RNA was removed following centri-
fugation and precipitated overnight at −20°C using ice
cold isopropanol. RNA was washed with 75% ethanol then
solubilized in RNase-free water. Optical density values of
extracted RNA were measured using NanoDrop (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) to confirm an A260:A280 ratio above
1.9. RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured using
BioAnalyzer (Agilent) RNA 6000 Pico Kit to confirm RIN
above 7. The cDNA libraries were prepared using the
SMARTer® Ultra® Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing - v3
(Clontech) followed by Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit
(Illumina) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The
unique barcode sequences were incorporated in the adap-
tors for multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. The
final product was assessed for its size distribution and
concentration using BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA
Kit (Agilent Technologies) and Kapa Library Quantifica-
tion Kit (Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were diluted to
2 nM in EB buffer (Qiagen) and then denatured using the
Illumina protocol. The denatured libraries were diluted to
10 pM by pre-chilled hybridization buffer and loaded onto
TruSeq SR v3 flow cells on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illu-
mina) and run for 50 cycles using a single-read recipe
(TruSeq SBS Kit v3, Illumina) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Illumina CASAVA pipeline (released
version 1.8, Illumina) was used to obtain de-multiplexed
sequencing reads (fastq files) passed the default purify
filter. Additional quality filtering used FASTX-Toolkit
(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit)
to
keep
only
reads that have at least 80% of bases with a quality score
of 20 or more (conducted by fastq_quality_filter function)
and reads left with 10 bases or longer after being end-
trimmed with reads with a base quality score of b20 (con-
ducted by fastq_quality_trimmer function).
RNA-sequencing alignment and differential gene
expression analysis
A bowtie2 index was built for the mouse reference genome
(GRCm38) using bowtie version 2.1.0. The RNA-seq reads
of each of the 38 samples were mapped using TopHat ver-
sion 2.0.9 [12] supplied by Ensembl annotation file;
GRCm38.78.gtf. Gene expression values were computed
using fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads
(FPKM). Differential gene expression was determined using
Cuffdiff tool which is available in Cufflinks version 2.2.1
[13] supplied by GRCm38.78.gtf. Normalization was per-
formed via the median of the geometric means of fragment
counts across all libraries, as described in Anders and
Halstead et al. Respiratory Research  (2018) 19:3

 Huber [14]. Statistical significance was assessed using a
false discovery rate threshold of 0.05.
Functional annotation enrichment analysis
We arbitrarily chose to further analyze the 5% most highly
expressed gene transcripts in AM or EM cell populations
from IAV-infected DTGM or LM mice using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) to
identify upstream signaling pathways. Significance was
measured by Fisher’s exact test with a q < 0.2 cut-off.
Statistics
All statistical analysis was performed using JMP 12.0.1
software (SAS, Cary, NC). Normally distributed data
were analyzed using student’s t-test, and non-normally
distributed data using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Sur-
vival analysis was calculated by using the log-rank test.
All data points are means ± standard error of the mean
(SEM) unless otherwise stated. Graphs were created
using Prism 6 for Mac OS X (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
Results
Doxycycline-inducible airway GM-CSF over-expression
confers protection against severe IAV infection
To characterize the pathogenicity of our H1N1 PR8 IAV
preparation virus, wild-type C57BL/6 J mice (The Jack-
son Laboratory, MA) were purchased and we deter-
mined the lethal dose 50% (LD50) of our PR8 IAV
preparation. Female wild-type mice were much more
susceptible than males with an LD50 approximately 5-
fold lower than males (728 vs. 3728 FFU, female and
males respectively, Additional file 3: Figure S1A-D).
Airway GM-CSF levels were conditionally increased
following IAV infection using a doxycycline inducible
promoter in the DTGM mouse model, formerly named
the tet-GM+/+, as previously described [4]. In this condi-
tional transgenic mouse model GM-CSF is expressed
and secreted by airway club cells via the club cell 10
(CC10, Scgb1a1) promoter after oral administration of
doxycycline (1 mg/mL in water ad libitum) (Fig. 1a).
Importantly, in the absence of infection, BAL fluid levels of
GM-CSF in DTGM mice are near the limit of detection,
similar to littermate controls (Additional file 4: Figure S2a),
and their alveolar macrophages appear identical by multi-
parameter flow cytometry. Once doxycycline is adminis-
tered, BAL levels of GM-CSF peak after approximately 48 h
reaching levels of approximately 500 pg/mL in 2.5 mL of
recovered BAL fluid and in preliminary experiments the
DTGM mice were either administered or not administered
doxycycline to create a condition of elevated vs. wild-type
levels of airway GM-CSF, respectively [4]. However, these
preliminary experiments demonstrated that low levels of
GM-CSF from the Scgb1a1 promoter in DTGM mice were
endogenously induced by interferons during IAV infection
(Additional file 4: Figure S2A), a finding that has previously
been reported [15]. Therefore, all subsequent experiments
compared the DTGM to LM groups, both exposed to
doxycycline, to examine the effect of elevated (DTGM) as
opposed to wild-type (LM) levels of airway GM-CSF, while
also controlling for any off-targets effects of doxycycline.
To address our research question of whether “treat-
ment” with GM-CSF during severe IAV infection would
improve survival, DTGM and LM mice were infected
i.n. with approximately 1 LD50 (differential dosing based
on sex) of PR8 IAV and were administered doxycycline
in drinking water. GM-CSF overexpression (DTGM)
conferred a significant survival advantage as compared
to wild-type levels (LM, Fig. 1b, **p < 0.005). Weight loss
and recovery were similar in the two groups, however,
because of survivor bias likely artificially elevating the
average weights of surviving LM mice (Fig. 1c). Of note,
doxycycline treatment of LM mice had no effect on sur-
vival whereas doxycycline-untreated DTGM mice dem-
onstrated a survival advantage over untreated LM mice,
suggesting that even low levels of GM-CSF can confer
some survival benefit (Additional file 4: Figure S2B).
GM-CSF does not improve oxygenation but prevents
deterioration of several lung mechanical parameters
Lower respiratory tract IAV infection can lead to impaired
oxygenation due to V:Q mismatch and decrease lung
compliance due to the infiltration of inflammatory cells
and an increase in lung water weight [16]. Given the abil-
ity of GM-CSF to confer survival, we expected elevated
GM-CSF levels to improve arterial oxygen saturations (%
SpO2). However, GM-CSF did not significantly increase
median oxygen saturations (% SpO2) levels as compared
to LM mice at either 7 or 10 dpi (data not shown).
To gain insight into whether GM-CSF conferred any
lung mechanical benefits, lung mechanics scans were per-
formed by the forced oscillation technique and PV loop
curves were generated (Fig. 2a, b). As expected, the PV
curve flattens with IAV infection due to decreased static
compliance (Cst), but we were surprised that compliance
continued to fall from days 7 to 10 (Fig. 2a-c). While GM-
CSF did not affect Cst (Fig. 2c) or total system resistance
(Rrs, Fig. 2d), DTGM mice demonstrated less tissue
damping or peripheral airway resistance (G, cmH2O/mL,
Fig. 2e), and significant preservation of Newtonian or
central airway resistance (Rn, cmH2O*s/mL, Fig. 2f) and
curvature of the deflation limb of the PV curve, a measure
of maintenance of alveoli and small airway recruitment
(K, 1/cmH2O, Fig. 2g) at 10 dpi.
GM-CSF decreases BAL protein levels late during infection
but does not alter viral load
Given that two of the lung mechanical parameters that
are maintained by GM-CSF, K and G, are correlated with

 dynamic processes at the small airway or alveolar level,
namely alveolar size [17] and changes in tissue physical
properties of small airways [18] respectively, and which
can change with lung interstitial edema [19], we hypoth-
esized that GM-CSF may improve lung capillary barrier
function and/or enhance alveolar fluid clearance. As
surrogate of alveolar fluid content, we measured the
concentration of total protein in BAL fluid and found
that GM-CSF overexpression decreased BAL fluid total
protein levels at 10 (peak inflammation) and 14 dpi
(early resolution phase) (Fig. 3a). To further investigate
this difference in BAL fluid protein content, we examined
the concentration of various serum and lung-specific pro-
teins including mouse serum albumin (69 kDa), as well as
two
larger
proteins,
alpha-2-macroglobulin
(180
kDa
monomer, 720 kDa tetramer) and immunoglobulin M
(IgM, 194 kDa monomer, 970 kDa pentamer) as markers of
capillary leak [20]. GM-CSF significantly decreased alpha-2-
macroglobulin levels at 14 dpi (Fig. 3b), but did not signifi-
cantly decrease other markers of capillary leak including
albumin or IgM (Additional file 5: Figure S3A-B). We also
directly assayed the lung epithelial barrier function with
FITC-labeled dextran (MW 10,000), but surprisingly no
differences in epithelial barrier function could be detected
at 10 dpi (data not shown).
Additionally, we also investigated whether GM-CSF over-
expression during IAV increased BAL levels of the epider-
mal growth factor family member, amphiregulin. GM-CSF
overexpression in uninfected mice elevated levels of
amphiregulin, though IAV infection also induced amphire-
gulin and GM-CSF did not further increase these levels
(Fig. 3c). Lastly, we assessed whether elevated GM-CSF
levels during active infection affected viral clearance. At 7
dpi, the peak of virus levels in our model, we recovered 2-
3 × 108 M1-copies total lung copies of IAV PR8 matrix 1
(M1) via RT-PCR and the viral copies decreased to 0.8-2 ×
107 by 10 dpi, though there was no statistically significant
difference with GM-CSF overexpression (Fig. 3d).
Effect of GM-CSF overexpression on airway macrophages
Alveolar macrophages have been shown to be necessary
for protection from IAV [21–27]. GM-CSF is known to
mediate the proliferation and differentiation of monocytes
and macrophages; studies using constitutive expression or
GM-CSF administration before IAV infection models both
documented an increase in AM numbers [5, 6, 28]. There-
fore we hypothesized that GM-CSF would protect SiglecF
+ AMs from viral-induced depletion and would increase
numbers of total airway (BAL-recovered) macrophages.
To investigate this immune cells were characterized and
enumerated in single cell suspensions of BAL and lung
enzymatic digests by multi-parameter flow cytometry
using a 12-color panel of macrophage and granulocyte
surface markers (Fig. 4a). We specifically focused on the
two predominant airway macrophage populations present
during active IAV infection: F4/80+, CD11bneg/dim, SiglecF
+ cells to discriminate alveolar macrophages (AMs) and
F4/80+, CD11b+, SiglecFneg/dim cells that have been termed
exudative macrophages (EMs) [29]. Our typical yield of
AMs recovered from BAL fluid of an uninfected mouse is
approximately 600,000 cells. At 10dpi, at the height of the
inflammatory response to IAV, the number of AMs

on survival and body mass during IAV infection. To simulate a therapeutic model of GM-CSF administration doxycycline was administered to both
DTGM and LM control mice starting 3 days after i.n. infection with PR8 IAV. Doxycycline-containing water was protected from light and changed
every three days (a). DTGM (n = 23, red circles/lines) and LM control (n = 15, black squares/lines) mice were administered approximately 2 LD50 of
IAV PR8 virus i.n. and administered doxycycline in water starting on +3 dpi, and the effects on survival and body weight are shown. Mice were euthanized
if they lost >30% body weight and were moribund. GM-CSF over-expression (DTGM mice) conferred a significant survival benefit (b) but not a significant
effect on weight loss/recovery (c) as compared to wild-type levels (LM mice). Results shown represent three independent experiments (**p < 0.005)

 recovered was much lower, and GM-CSF overexpression
did not serve to increase this number (Fig. 4b). In contrast,
EMs become the predominant airway macrophage during
IAV infection at this time point, but again, GM-CSF over-
expression did not affect EM cell numbers (Fig. 4b).
Transcriptome analysis of airway macrophages during IAV
infection
While GM-CSF overexpression did not change the num-
ber of macrophages, we hypothesized that it changed their
phenotype. This is not a new concept as the primary func-
tion of GM-CSF on AMs is to induce differentiation and
activation [4, 30, 31]. Despite attempting to discriminate
the macrophage populations by multiple cell surface
markers, we could not distinguish the IAV-responding
macrophages further than alveolar and exudative macro-
phages as described in Fig. 4a. Therefore, we sought to
determine whether GM-CSF affected the transcriptomes
of the AM and EM populations independently by first
FACS-sorting the airway macrophages. FACS-sorted air-
way macrophages from BAL fluid were obtained at 8 dpi,
the time point where the survival curves of the DTGM
and LM mice begin to diverge, and next generation RNA-
sequencing was performed on the sorted AM and EM
populations. Using an unbiased approach, we identified
the transcripts that were significantly affected by GM-CSF
over-expression during IAV infection by comparing the
mean value of each transcript from the DTGM and LM
groups. For direct comparisons, transcripts that had a
mean value of zero (0) FKPM in one of the groups were
not analyzed. Of the 43,628 genes available in the refer-
ence genome, in the AM population 23 transcripts were
significantly different between the groups with GM-CSF
over-expression leading to up-regulation of the chemo-
kines Ccl17, Cxcl3, and CCL6, and the down-regulation of
Cxcl9, and Arg1, the prototypic marker of M2 macrophage
polarization (Fig. 5a) [32]. In comparison to AMs, in EMs
GM-CSF induced more transcripts than it inhibited. Only

 six transcripts were down regulated by GM-CSF including
Lipg, Cxcl10 and Ccl12, while GM-CSF overexpression
induced multiple transcripts in EMs including Dcstamp,
Retnla, Irgc1, Mmp12, and Ccl6 (Fig. 5b). Our unbiased
analysis demonstrated that GM-CSF overexpression during
IAV led to the up-regulation of some transcripts associated
with M2 macrophages including matrix metalloprotease 12,
MMP12, and CCL17, and the down-regulation of some M1
macrophage-associated transcripts such as CXCL9 and
CXCL10. Therefore we examined the effect of GM-CSF on
multiple canonical and novel macrophage polarization
markers [33]. Interestingly, while GM-CSF tended to down-
regulate M1 transcripts and up-regulate M2 transcripts, this
effect was not absolute in either AMs or EMs (Fig. 5c-f).
BAL protein validation of RNAseq data
To validate these macrophage transcript differences we
measured the chemokines CCL17 and CXCL9, and the
M2-associated metalloprotease, MMP12, in BAL fluid by
ELISA. CCL17 was significantly induced by GM-CSF (not
only during IAV infection, but also when GM-CSF was
induced in the absence of IAV (Fig. 6A). In comparison,
negligible amounts of CXCL9 were present in uninfected
mice regardless of GM-CSF induction, whereas with IAV
Fig. 5 Characterization of the changes in transcriptome patterns of airway macrophages during IAV infection. BAL airway macrophages were sorted using
the gating strategy described in Fig. 4a and next generation RNA-sequencing was used to profile the complete transcriptome data of AMs (a, orange bars)
and EMs (b, blue bars) at 8 dpi, the time point at which the survival curves diverge (n = 5 mice per group). The effect of supraphysiologic GM-CSF levels
on each of the 43,628 sequenced macrophage genes was examined: differential gene expression was determined using with transcripts having a q-value
<0.2 being included. The relative expression of each transcript was calculated using the equation, Log2 Expression Ratio (DTGM:LM) = Log2 ðX transcriptDTGM)
- Log2 (X transcriptLM), and the differential expression of transcripts is shown. To investigate the impact of GM-CSF on M1/M2 macrophage polarization, the
Log2 Expression Ratios were plotted against known M1 and M2 macrophage-associated transcripts from AMs (c, d) and EMs (e, f)

 infection GM-CSF overexpression there was a trend
toward decreased expression (Fig. 6B, p = 0.09). The con-
centration of MMP12 was approximately 6-fold higher in
GM-CSF overexpressing mice at 10 dpi as compared to
LMs (Fig. 6C, p < 0.01). We also examined the ratio of the
two chemokines (CXCL9: CCL17) as an intrinsic property
of the BALF to probe macrophage polarization by chemo-
kine expression and supra-physiologic GM-CSF levels
significantly decreased this ratio more than ten-fold in
IAV-infected mice (Fig. 6D, p < 0.005).
Ingenuity pathway analysis of GM-CSF altered transcripts
in airway macrophages
Lastly, we attempted to determine which signaling path-
ways were affected by GM-CSF overexpression during
IAV infection by analyzing our transcriptomes with
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen). We
analyzed the effect of GM-CSF overexpression on the
mean log2 expression ratios for the 5% most expressed
genes in each of the macrophage type groups (AM vs.
EM). The IPA software allows the construction of an
upstream analysis that calculates the likelihood that an
upstream regulator is involved given the gene set pro-
vided (p-value of overlap), as well as a composite score
of activation depending on the state of downstream
genes being increased or decreased in quantity (activa-
tion z-score). For both the upstream regulator analysis,
and the subsequent canonical pathway analysis, we used
a stringent p-value of overlap cutoff of 1E-10.
IPA predicted that GM-CSF activates (Table 1A) several
upstream regulators of signaling pathways in both AMs
and EMs including IL-10 receptor alpha (IL10RA), tran-
scription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24),
and the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2). Con-
versely, IPA predicted that GM-CSF over-expression
inhibited multiple inflammatory signaling pathways in
both AMs and EMs including interferon regulatory factor
3 (IRF3), IRF7, interferon gamma (IFNG), interferon
alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR), TIR domain-containing
adapter molecule 1 (TICAM1, or TRIF), signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), rapamycin-in-
sensitive companion of mammalian target of rapamy-
cin (RICTOR), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), DExD/H-
box helicase 58 (DDX58, or retinoic acid-inducible
gene

[RIG-1]),
and
inhibitor
of
nuclear
factor
kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKBKB).
In terms of canonical pathway analysis one pathway,
"eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signaling", was acti-
vated in both AMs and EMs, whereas "Fc-γ receptor-
mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes"
was inhibited in both populations (Table 1C, D). “Inter-
feron signaling” was inhibited in EMs (Table 1D), and
trended towards significance in the AM population
[−log(p-value) 7.66, z-score − 1.5], even though the levels
of type I, II and III interferons were unchanged in

Discussion
In this study we examined the effect of elevated GM-CSF
levels during IAV infection on clinical, lung physiologic and
biochemical markers in a mouse model, and then used
RNA-sequencing to ascertain the differential effects of
elevated GM-CSF levels on the transcriptomes of the two
predominant airway macrophages present during the peak
of IAV infection. Our finding that elevation of airway GM-
CSF during active IAV infection confers protection from
mortality from IAV is novel. Multiple preclinical mouse
studies have described the observations that the absence of
GM-CSF increases susceptibility to IAV [3, 4, 25], while
supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF achieved by constitu-
tive overexpression or exogenous administration are benefi-
cial [5, 6, 28]. Importantly, however, the publications that
have demonstrated positive effects of supra-physiologic
levels of GM-CSF against IAV infection have used either
constitutive expression models [3–5] or have administered
GM-CSF either before [6, 28] or on the day of infection [5].
To our knowledge this is the first description of the use of
a therapeutic model of GM-CSF wherein it is “adminis-
tered” to the airways well after establishment of the infec-
tion (+3 dpi) and still confers protection.
Table 1 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predictions of the effects of supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF on airway macrophages during IAV. BAL
airway macrophages were sorted and RNA-sequencing was performed to compare the gene expression between IAV-infected LM (n = 5 mice)
and DTGM (n = 5 mice) treated with doxycycline at 8 dpi. Using the means of each group, the 5% (2181 genes) most expressed transcripts from
each of the genotypes, DTGM and LM, were analyzed using Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA was used to identify
differential upstream regulators between AMs (A) and EMs (B) of DTGM and LM mice, and upstream regulators were included in the
table if their p-value of overlap was <1E-10 and the activation z-score was < −2 or > +2. IPA was also used to identify differential effects
of GM-CSF on canonical pathways of AMs (C) and EMs (D). Ingenuity canonical pathways were included in the table if their -log(p-value)
was >10 and the z-score of pathway activation was < −2 or > +2

 GM-CSF over-expression led to an increase in macro-
phage expression and BAL fluid levels of CCL17 and
MMP12, whereas a decrease in CXCL9 or monokine
induced by gamma interferon (MIG). These protein
data, in addition to our macrophage transcriptome data,
suggest that high levels of GM-CSF push the typically
classically activated M1-like monocytes/macrophages in
the lung during IAV towards an M2-like phenotype.
Interestingly, a recent investigation showed that the
presence of M1-like monocytes are a major determinant
of IAV pathogenicity in patients and strengthened this
notion with a mouse model demonstrating that adoptive
transfer of M2 as opposed to M1 macrophages results in
better outcomes [34]. The observation that GM-CSF is
pushing macrophages towards an M2-phenotype is in
stark contrast to a large body of in vitro literature that
defines M1 monocytes/macrophages as being induced
by GM-CSF, whereas M2 monocytes/macrophages are
differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(M-CSF) [35–37]. On the other hand, alveolar macro-
phages from GM-CSF-deficient csf2−/− mice exhibit a
mixed M1/M2 phenotype, not a strictly M2 phenotype
as in vitro data would suggest [38]. And our data also
suggests that the polarization was not at all absolute:
e.g., in AMs, GM-CSF led to lower transcript levels of
the prototypic M2 macrophage marker, Arg1 (Fig. 5a).
Thus, while the M1/M2 macrophage polarization schema
has been helpful [39, 40], perhaps a more nuanced view of
macrophage polarization [41], where their intrinsic differ-
entiation plasticity allows them to attend to specific needs
of their local immune environment [42], could explain
these results. IPA also predicted the activation of the
IL-10 receptor alpha-chain in both AMs and EMs.
Given that IL-10 levels in BAL fluid were not ele-
vated in DTGM as compared WT mice (Additional
file 6: Figure S4D), it is possible that GM-CSF over-
expressing during IAV somehow potentiates IL-10 sig-
naling in the lung microenvironment.
The role of interferons during IAV infection is also
nuanced. While it has been shown using IFNAR−/− and
IFNGR1−/− mice that interferon signaling is necessary for
protection from IAV [43], it is possible that this require-
ment only extends to epithelial cells. Interferon-γ may not
be necessary during IAV infection and may in fact be detri-
mental, e.g., nitrogen oxide synthase 2 deficient (NOS2−/−)
mice are more protected from IAV [44], and Sun and Metz-
ger demonstrated that treatment with an anti-IFNγ mAb
clone XMG1.2 had little effect on the course of the viral in-
fection, but inactivation of IFN-γ protected against second-
ary bacterial pneumonia [45]. Recently, Califano et al.
showed that IFNγ−/− mice on both the Balb/c and C57BL/6
backgrounds demonstrated improved survival to lethal IAV
infection [34]. In their model, IFNγ serves to restrict pro-
tective innate lymphoid cell group 2 (ILC2) function, whose
production of IL-5 and amphiregulin may improve lung
barrier function. Another group has also demonstrated that
GM-CSF can induce amphiregulin in a smoke model of
COPD followed by IAV infection [46], however our data
(Fig. 3c) suggest that pretreatment with GM-CSF is neces-
sary for this effect on amphiregulin levels. Furthermore, our
GM-CSF over-expression is started after IAV infection,
amphiregulin levels at 10 dpi were not different in GM-CSF
over-expressing mice, and therefore amphiregulin is likely
not an active player in our model. It is possible that our
inducible GM-CSF model may be replenishing GM-CSF
that otherwise would be produced by ILC2s whose func-
tions have been restricted by IFNγ [34].
Our data suggest that high levels of GM-CSF inhibit
interferon signaling in airway macrophages, though the
mechanism is not clear. Canonically, GM-CSF signaling
acts through JAK2/STAT5 [47], though the beta-chain
itself can activate NF-kB, and this activation is dependent
on TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [48, 49], an E3 ubi-
quitin ligase with multiple immune functions [50]. Inter-
estingly, our upstream analysis predicts that GM-CSF
activates TRIM24, (aka TIF1α), a negative regulator of
interferon signaling that acts by binding the retinoic acid-
responsive element of the Stat1 promoter [51], thus
inactivating multiple interferon pathways. TRIM24 is also
an E3-ubiquitin ligase, and the tumor suppressor protein,
p53, serves as a ligand for both ligases: TRIM24 targets
p53 for degradation [52] while TRAF6 restricts p53 mito-
chondrial translocation [53]. Furthermore, a recent micro-
array study examining the relative pathogenicity of a
mouse adapted strain of IAV (MA-CA/04) described
negative inhibition of TRIM24 and early sustained inter-
feron responses as important factors [54]. However, we
detected only very low levels of Trim24 transcripts in our
sorted airway macrophages, but GM-CSF over-expression
did lead to increased expression of another TRIM family
member, Trim16, that also acts as a E3 ubiquitin ligase
that can heterodimerize with other TRIMs [55]. Future
studies are needed to determine the exact cellular signal-
ing pathways linking GM-CSF and interferon.
GM-CSF enhanced exudative macrophage expression,
and 8 dpi BAL fluid levels of MMP12, or macrophage elas-
tase, which is best known for its requirement for the devel-
opment of smoke-induced emphysema in mice [56].
However, it may also regulate acute inflammatory responses
by proteolysis of chemokines [57], and through its divergent
effects on IFN-α signaling depending on its intracellular
(activating) vs. extracellular (inactivating) localization [58]. A
recent report demonstrated in two separate mouse models
inflammation (peritonitis and arthritis) that macrophages
resolve inflammation through multiple mechanisms via
MMP12 including dampening neutrophil infiltration, clear-
ing actin and fibrin from NETs, terminating complement
activation, and by activating prothrombin thus exhibiting

 procoagulant activity [59]. CD4+ T cells and STAT4/6, at
least in a mouse model of pneumocystis pneumonia, are
necessary for M2 macrophage MMP12 expression and
RELM-α and CCL17 production [60]. While our data sug-
gest that GM-CSF may block M1-like polarization in the
lung during IAV infection, it is not yet clear what in the
lung microenvironment could promote M2-like macro-
phage responses. Recently it was shown that macrophage
polarization may be pushed towards a IL-4 dependent path-
way in the lung and liver by the presence of surfactant
protein A (SP-A) and complement component C1q, re-
spectively [61]. The relationship between supraphysiologic
GM-CSF levels and SP-A during IAV infection remains to
be investigated and will be the subject of future studies.
Our current model of GM-CSF induction on the wild-
type background differs from our previous work using the
inducible model generated on the GM-CSF knockout
(Csf2−/−) genetic background [4]. The present study is not
confounded by prior immaturity of AMs and defective
surfactant catabolism, nor potential defects in migratory
dendritic cell subsets, NK cells, and other myeloid cells
outside the alveolar compartment in the lung and in other
tissues of Csf2−/− mice [62–65], or disruption of GM-CSF
secretion by immune and non-immune cells that may
elaborate GM-CSF in response to infection. Studies in
Csf2−/− /SPC-GM mice, in which T2AECs express high
levels of GM-CSF constitutively, came to disparate conclu-
sions as to the role of AMs, dendritic cells and epithelial
cells [3, 5] in host resistance to IAV infection. However,
the life-long overexpression of GM-CSF in the SPC-GM
+/+ model results in non-physiological proliferation of
both T2AEC cells and AMs [66] that obscures assessment
of temporal responses to IAV. The SPC-GM+/+ model also
illustrates that prolonged lung exposure to supraphysiolo-
gic levels of GM-CSF leads to desquamative interstitial
pneumonia (DIP) [4]. We did not observe any similar
findings of DIP in our model, but this is not surprising
given our model creates only a temporary doxycycline-
induced overxpression, and the overriding inflammatory
effects of IAV infection likely masks any differences. In
our model, the ability of supra-physiologic levels of GM-
CSF to beneficially alter disease progression after IAV
infection delineates a time frame for possible future thera-
peutic intervention to arrest development of acute lung
injury. In this regard, administration of GM-CSF in
humans has shown promise in the treatment of ARDS
[67]. Concentration-dependent signaling via the GM-CSF
receptor affecting differentiation, proliferation, activation,
and function of different effector cells has been studied
extensively [68–71].
Conclusions
Our data demonstrate that in vivo high airway levels of
GM-CSF profoundly rescue mice from lethal influenza
pneumonia. While in vitro GM-CSF is canonically
described as an M1-polarizing cytokine, our data dem-
onstrates that in vivo, during IAV infection, GM-CSF
instead temporizes the type II interferon-induced M1
polarization of airway macrophages. The exact mechan-
ism through which high levels of GM-CSF block M1-
macrophage polarization is still not known, and is the
focus of our ongoing research.
