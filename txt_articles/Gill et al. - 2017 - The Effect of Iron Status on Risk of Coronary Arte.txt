ron serves in several fundamental processes, including 
erythropoiesis and cellular metabolism.1 Although iron 
status has been implicated in cardiovascular disease,1 the evi-
dence for this is mixed. In support of a detrimental effect of 
higher iron status on cardiovascular risk, a reduced incidence 
of heart disease in premenopausal women as compared with 
men and postmenopausal women has been attributed to lower 
levels of stored iron.2 Higher iron stores have also been posi-
tively associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, 
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.3 Furthermore, genetic muta-
tions resulting in hereditary haemochromatosis are associated 
with an increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity,4 and 
chelation of heavy metals using disodium EDTA in patients 
that have experienced a recent myocardial infarction reduced 
adverse cardiovascular outcomes.5 However, these findings 
contrast with the results of a meta-analysis of observational 
studies that suggests a protective effect of higher iron status 
on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).6 In addition, iron 
deficiency has been associated with increased mortality in 
patients with heart failure.7
It can be difficult to disentangle causal effects from spuri-
ous associations attributable to confounding and reverse cau-
sation in observational study. The Mendelian randomization 
(MR) approach can overcome these issues by using genetic 
variants, such as SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) as 
proxies or instruments for a phenotype or exposure of inter-
est.8 It is because genetic variants are allocated randomly at 
the time of conception that this approach is not typically con-
founded by environmental factors, lifestyle factors, or reverse 
causation. If the underlying assumptions of MR analysis are 
met,8 SNPs associated with iron status can be used as instru-
ments in an investigation of the causal effect of iron status on

Objective—Iron status is a modifiable trait that has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. This study uses the Mendelian 
randomization technique to investigate whether there is any causal effect of iron status on risk of coronary artery disease 
(CAD).
Approach and Results—A 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach is used to estimate the effect of iron status on CAD 
risk. Three loci (rs1800562 and rs1799945 in the HFE gene and rs855791 in TMPRSS6) that are each associated with 
serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and transferrin in a pattern suggestive of an association with systemic iron 
status are used as instruments. SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism)-iron status association estimates are based on a 
genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 48 972 individuals. SNP-CAD estimates are derived by combining the 
results of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 60 801 CAD cases and 123 504 controls with those of a meta-
analysis of 63 746 CAD cases and 130 681 controls obtained from Metabochip and genome-wide association studies. 
Combined Mendelian randomization estimates are obtained for each marker by pooling results across the 3 instruments. 
We find evidence of a protective effect of higher iron status on CAD risk (iron odds ratio, 0.94 per SD unit increase; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.88–1.00; P=0.039; transferrin saturation odds ratio, 0.95 per SD unit increase; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.91–0.99; P=0.027; log-transformed ferritin odds ratio, 0.85 per SD unit increase; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73–0.98; P=0.024; and transferrin odds ratio, 1.08 per SD unit increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.16; P=0.034).
Conclusions—This Mendelian randomization study supports the hypothesis that higher iron status reduces CAD risk. These 
findings may highlight a therapeutic target.

risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This principle has pre-
viously been adopted to explore the causal effect of iron status 
on atherosclerosis,9 and a similar approach has also been taken 
to show that red blood cell (RBC) traits are associated with 
risk of CHD.10
The instruments used in an MR study must influence the 
intermediate phenotype of interest,8,11 which in this case is 
systemic iron status. Various correlated markers of iron status 
are available, including serum iron, transferrin saturation, fer-
ritin, and transferrin.1,12–15 Genetic instruments for iron status 
that are used in an MR study should have a concordant asso-
ciation with each of these markers, and specifically SNPs that 
are deemed to increase systemic iron status should be associ-
ated with increased levels of serum iron, transferrin saturation 
and ferritin, and decreased levels of transferrin.9,11,16 Another 
potential limitation of the MR approach concerns pleiotropy, 
where genetic variants affect the outcome (CAD risk) through 
pathways that are independent of the intermediate phenotype 
of interest (iron status), thus, violating a fundamental assump-
tion of MR to bias the causal effect estimates generated.8,17 In 
this study, we select instruments for systemic iron status and 
perform an MR study investigating its causal effect on CAD 
risk. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that any pleio-
tropic effects of the instruments may be biasing the estimates 
generated.
Materials and Methods
Materials and Methods are available in the online-only Data 
Supplement. The overall study design is demonstrated graphically in 
Figure 1.
Results
The 3 instruments have F statistics for the 4 iron status 
markers ranging from 47 to 2127 (Table 1). Individual 
SNP-iron marker estimates are given in Table 1, whereas 
Table 2 reports the SNP-CAD estimates from the 
meta-analysis of CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000G and 
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Metabochip.
Individual and pooled MR estimates for the effect of the 4 
markers of iron status on risk of CAD are reported in Figure 2. 
The results, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for CAD per SD 
unit increase in the iron status marker, demonstrate a protec-
tive effect on CAD risk for iron (OR, 0.94; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.88–1.00; P=0.039), transferrin saturation (OR, 
0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–0.99; P=0.027), and (log-transformed) 
ferritin (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.98; P=0.024). The effect 
estimate for transferrin (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16; 
P=0.034) is also in keeping with the other results to suggest 
that higher iron status is protective of CAD because higher 
transferrin levels reflect lower iron status.
Search of an online database of SNP-phenotype associa-
tions demonstrated that all 3 instruments are also associated 
with RBC traits.18,19 Furthermore, the iron status raising allele 
at rs1800562 in the HFE gene is associated with lower low-
density lipoprotein levels, and the iron status raising allele at 
rs1799945 in the HFE gene is associated with higher systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures.20,21
Discussion
This work suggests a protective effect of higher iron status on 
the risk of CAD. The pooled MR estimates for serum iron, 
transferrin saturation, ferritin, and transferrin all suggest that 
higher iron status lowers the risk of CAD. The objective of this 
study is to explore whether CAD risk is affected by iron status, 
and instruments were selected to reflect this. The finding that 
all the considered iron status makers give similar causal esti-
mates is consistent with the effect of CAD risk being mediated 
by iron status rather than any individual marker. The small 
differences in estimates and CI widths for the causal effects of 
the 4 markers might be explained by chance and possibly dif-
ferential measurement error across markers, rather than indi-
cating distinct causal pathways. In addition, the variation in 
magnitude of the MR estimate CIs across the 3 SNPs for each 
iron status marker might also reflect the strengths of the SNP-
iron status marker associations (as evaluated by the F statistics 
given in Table 1). In our current MR study, we demonstrate 
a causal effect of iron status on CAD risk using only the 3 
SNPs associated with all 4 iron status markers at genome-
wide significance. Given our interest in systemic iron status, 
we only include genetic variants that have shown genome-
wide significant association with all 4 iron status markers in a 
pattern concordant with an effect on systemic iron status (ie, 
increased levels of serum iron, transferrin saturation and fer-
ritin, and decreased levels of transferrin) to minimize the risk 
of including invalid instruments. For example, rs8177240 in 
the TF gene has genome-wide significant associations with 
serum iron and transferrin saturation but in opposite directions

iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin, and decreased transferrin

genetic variants associated with the 4 iron status markers as sur-
rogates, the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach is used to 
estimate the causal effect of systemic iron status on risk of coro-
nary artery disease (CAD).

(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Because any 
effect on systemic iron status should have a concordant direc-
tion of effect on both serum iron and transferrin saturation, this 
genetic variant is unlikely to be a valid instrument. Whereas 
our approach has the advantage of minimizing risk of incor-
porating invalid instruments, it pays the price of sacrificing 
the additional power that might be afforded by considering as 
instruments all genetic variants associated with any iron status 
marker at genome-wide significance.22
A potential source of bias with the MR approach relates 
to the issue of pleiotropy.8,17 Whereas the availability of 
many instruments allows for implementation of statisti-
cal methods to detect and adjust for pleiotropy in sensitiv-
ity analyses, such techniques are not applicable when few 
instruments are available, such as in our study.23–27 Despite 
this, we have investigated the possibility of pleiotropy by 
searching for secondary phenotypes, which have shown 
association with the 3 instruments. The association of the 
3 iron status instruments with RBC traits may be expected 
given the well-established relationship between iron status 
and anemia,12 but this would not bias the MR analysis if any 
effect of RBC traits on CAD risk was acting downstream of 
iron status, rather than independently of it.8,17 The associa-
tion of the iron status raising allele at rs1800562 (HFE gene) 
with lower low-density lipoprotein levels and the iron status 
raising allele at rs1799945 (HFE gene) with higher systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures are likely to be affecting CAD 
risk independently of iron status and would, therefore, be 
expected to bias the MR estimates.20,21 Lower low-density 
lipoprotein levels and higher blood pressure are known to 
reduce and increase CAD risk, respectively.20,21 Consistent 
with the hypothesis of some bias attributable to pleiotropy, 
rs1800562 and rs1799945 give MR estimates for all markers 
that tend to, respectively, overestimate and underestimate the 
effect of iron status on CAD risk as compared with rs855791 
(TMPRSS6 gene), although the CIs for the 3 SNPs largely 
overlap for all markers (Figure 2). Moreover, the pooled 
MR estimate across the 3 SNPs is comparable with that of 
rs855791 alone, which has no known pleiotropic associa-
tions. Thus, the overall conclusions of this work are unlikely 
to be severely affected by these pleiotropic effects.
Early work attributed the observed association of heart 
disease with disorders of iron storage, older age in men, and 
postmenopausal status in women to the effect of higher sys-
temic iron status.2 However, consequent observational stud-
ies did not support this.28 A randomized controlled trial has 
demonstrated a protective effect of heavy metal chelation 
induced by disodium EDTA on heart disease, but it is unclear 
how generalizable this finding is, and the observed effect 
might be specific to patients that have suffered a recent myo-
cardial infarction or attributable to effects independent of 
systemic iron status and overall body iron stores.5 By con-
trast, the conclusions of our MR study are in keeping with 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective obser-
vational studies investigating the association of body iron 
status and CHD risk.6 All except 1 of the 17 studies included 
in this meta-analysis adjusted for smoking and major cardio-
vascular risk factors, such as blood pressure and lipid profile, 
with some studies also adjusting for social class and chronic 
disease.6 The risk ratio of CHD for individuals with levels of 
the iron status marker in the top third compared with indi-
viduals in the bottom third was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73–0.87) 
for iron, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75–0.89) for transferrin satura-
tion, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87–1.23) for ferritin, and 0.99 (95% 
CI, 0.86–1.13) for transferrin.6 The nonsignificant results for 
ferritin and transferrin might be attributable to confounding 
caused by inflammation, which would act to increase serum 
levels of ferritin and decrease those of transferrin,29 whereas 
increasing the risk of CHD,30 thus, potentially biasing the 
ferritin-CHD and transferrin-CHD associations to mask 
a true protective effect of higher iron status on CHD. The 
authors concluded that whereas their overall results may 
suggest a protective effect of higher body iron stores on risk 
CHD, it is difficult to infer causality because of the possibil-
ity of residual confounding and reverse causality bias.6 For 
example, increased iron status has also been associated with 
risk of diabetes mellitus, which is an established risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular disease.3,31 In our MR study, we have 
used genetic variants as instrumental variables for iron status

to overcome these limitations of observational research and 
strengthen the evidence for a protective effect of iron status 
on CAD risk.
Iron deficiency is a treatable condition that affects ≤2 bil-
lion people worldwide.1 The suggestion here that low iron 
status may have a causal effect on cardiovascular disease, 
therefore, has potentially significant clinical and public health 
implications. However, it is important to interpret the findings 
of our MR study in context. Whereas it is unlikely that plei-
otropy is wholly responsible for the pattern of our results, we 
cannot completely exclude this. Compensatory developmental 
processes, referred to as canalization, can buffer the effects 
of genetic variation and may have impacted on our MR esti-
mates, although this would be expected to bias results toward 
the null,32 We note that the Wald-type estimator has been 
shown to induce bias in the MR analysis of binary outcomes, 
although of small magnitude (eg, <10%) in typical MR anal-
yses.33 Use of the same combined discovery and replication 
results from the genome-wide association study meta-analysis 
to both identify the instruments and estimate their associa-
tions with iron status markers may also result in overestima-
tion of the SNP-iron status associations (the Beavis effect or 
winner’s curse),11,34,35 in turn leading to underestimation of the 
true causal effect of iron status on CAD risk (bias toward the 
null), which in our 2-sample MR analysis is estimated as the 
SNP-CAD association divided by the SNP-iron status asso-
ciation. Our use of instruments that have strong associations 
with all 4 markers of iron status should, however, minimize 
any effect of such bias.36 Finally, the conclusions of our work 
relate to patterns of iron status observed in the population-
based studies contributing to the GIS consortium (Genetics of 
Iron Status) and, therefore, reflect effects in the general pop-
ulation. Further research is needed to investigate the causal 
effects of iron status on CAD risk in subjects with severe iron 
overload or deficiency. Similarly, our study does not offer 
insight into whether the estimates are equally applicable to 
both men and women. Despite these limitations, the results of 
this work show consistent and biologically plausible effects. 
Iron status may be affecting CAD risk via effects on RBCs.10,12 
Iron deficiency is also known to impact cellular metabolism37 
and may increase CAD risk by this mechanism.
In conclusion, this work is suggestive of a protective effect 
of higher iron status on risk of cardiovascular disease. This war-
rants further investigation because these findings may highlight 
the possible therapeutic targets and risk-reduction strategies.

Highlights
• Systemic iron status is a modifiable trait that has been implicated in cardiovascular disease.
• Serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and transferrin are all markers of systemic iron status.
• By using genetic variants associated with these 4 markers as surrogates for systemic iron status, this study implements the MR approach to 
demonstrate a causal effect of systemic iron status on risk of CAD.
• These findings may highlight a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CAD.
