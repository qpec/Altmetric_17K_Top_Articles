BACKGROUND
The lifetime risk of stroke has been calculated in a limited number of selected 
populations. We sought to estimate the lifetime risk of stroke at the regional, 
country, and global level using data from a comprehensive study of the prevalence 
of major diseases.
METHODS
We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016 estimates of stroke 
incidence and the competing risks of death from any cause other than stroke to 
calculate the cumulative lifetime risks of first stroke, ischemic stroke, or hemor-
rhagic stroke among adults 25 years of age or older. Estimates of the lifetime risks 
in the years 1990 and 2016 were compared. Countries were categorized into quin-
tiles of the sociodemographic index (SDI) used in the GBD Study, and the risks 
were compared across quintiles. Comparisons were made with the use of point 
estimates and uncertainty intervals representing the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles 
around the estimate.
RESULTS
The estimated global lifetime risk of stroke from the age of 25 years onward was 
24.9% (95% uncertainty interval, 23.5 to 26.2); the risk among men was 24.7% 
(95% uncertainty interval, 23.3 to 26.0), and the risk among women was 25.1% 
(95% uncertainty interval, 23.7 to 26.5). The risk of ischemic stroke was 18.3%, and 
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was 8.2%. In high-SDI, high-middle–SDI, and low-
SDI countries, the estimated lifetime risk of stroke was 23.5%, 31.1% (highest 
risk), and 13.2% (lowest risk), respectively; the 95% uncertainty intervals did not 
overlap between these categories. The highest estimated lifetime risks of stroke 
according to GBD region were in East Asia (38.8%), Central Europe (31.7%), and 
Eastern Europe (31.6%), and the lowest risk was in eastern sub-Saharan Africa 
(11.8%). The mean global lifetime risk of stroke increased from 22.8% in 1990 to 
24.9% in 2016, a relative increase of 8.9% (95% uncertainty interval, 6.2 to 11.5); 
the competing risk of death from any cause other than stroke was considered in 
this calculation.
CONCLUSIONS
In 2016, the global lifetime risk of stroke from the age of 25 years onward was 
approximately 25% among both men and women. There was geographic variation 
in the lifetime risk of stroke, with the highest risks in East Asia, Central Europe, 
and Eastern Europe. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.)

S
troke accounts for almost 5% of 
all disability-adjusted life-years1 and 10% 
of all deaths worldwide,2 with the bulk of 
this burden (>75% of deaths from stroke and 
>80% of disability-adjusted life-years) occur-
ring in low-income and middle-income coun-
tries.3 According to several surveys, the global 
burden of stroke has been increasing,1-3 and pre-
vention of stroke may require an improved under-
standing of the risks among younger persons. 
Stroke prevention strategies in low-income and 
middle-income countries may differ from those 
adopted in high-income countries owing to dif-
ferences in access to health care, health tech-
nologies, and relative rates of risk factors for 
stroke.4
Estimates of lifetime risk (defined as the cu-
mulative probability of a disease developing in a 
person of a given age and sex during that per-
son’s remaining lifespan, after accounting for 
competing risks of death) provide a measure of 
disease risk in large populations.5 Estimates of 
lifetime risk of stroke may be useful for the 
long-term planning of health systems.6 In addi-
tion, estimates of lifetime risk of stroke across 
the age spectrum on a national level may be 
useful for gauging the effect of stroke preven-
tion strategies.
Previous estimates of lifetime risk of stroke 
have been reported in a limited number of se-
lected populations.6-12 Diverging trends in stroke 
incidence and mortality rates have been ob-
served between developed countries (where the 
rates are decreasing) and developing countries 
(where the rates are increasing)13 against a back-
ground of increasing life expectancy in almost 
all countries.14
We used the results of the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) Study 2016, which estimated 
major disease burden from 1990 through 2016, 
to compare the estimated global, regional, and 
country-specific lifetime risks of stroke in 2016 
with those in 1990. These estimates were 
stratified according to pathological subtype of 
stroke, age, sex, and sociodemographic index 
(SDI) and accounted for the competing risk of 
death from any cause other than stroke. The 
GBD is an ongoing global collaboration that 
uses all available epidemiologic data to provide 
a comparative assessment of health loss from 
328 diseases across 195 countries and terri-
tories.
Methods
Estimating Stroke Incidence and Mortality
We used estimates from the GBD Study 20161,2 
of the rate of first stroke, cause-specific mortal-
ity, and all-cause mortality at the global, regional 
(21 GBD regions nested within 7 GBD super-
regions), and national (195 countries) levels, 
stratified according to age and sex (Table 1; and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with this the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). Analyses were performed separately 
for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke; the 
latter included intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke 
and nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhagic 
stroke. The GBD Study 2016 used all available 
representative population-based data on inci-
dence, prevalence, case fatality, and mortality 
to produce estimates of disease burden in 195 
countries according to sex and 5-year age cate-
gories. Mortality was estimated by means of the 
Cause of Death Ensemble model, in which vital 
registration, verbal autopsy data (which included 
a written summary of events leading to a person’s 
death as well as answers to standardized ques-
tions obtained by trained workers from families 
or other reliable informants in the local lan-
guage), and country-specific covariates are used 
to estimate cause-specific mortality over time. 
Stroke incidence was estimated with the use of 
DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression disease-
modeling tool. Details of the methods that we 
used to estimate stroke incidence and mortality 
have been previously published3 and are sum-
marized in the Supplementary Appendix.
Estimating Lifetime Risk of Stroke
Countries were categorized into quintiles of the 
SDI (high, high-medium, medium, medium-low, 
and low level of development) used in the GBD 
Study 2016.15 The SDI, a composite indicator of 
development similar to the Human Development 
Index,16 is based on country-level income per 
capita, average educational attainment among 
persons older than 15 years of age, and total 
fertility rate. We used stroke incidence, preva-
lence, and mortality rates in each 5-year age 
group to estimate the lifetime risk of stroke 
among persons at a given age. The lifetime risk 
of stroke at each age represents the cumulative 
risk of stroke from that age onward and is con-
ditional on a person’s survival to that age with-

out having had a nonfatal stroke. Further details 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
To account for the competing risks of stroke 
and death within a specific age group, we calcu-
lated the probability of both stroke and death 
from any cause other than stroke separately and 
then scaled the separate event probabilities to 
match the combined probability of both events. 
We calculated the lifetime risk only among per-
sons 25 years of age or older because incidence 
rates of stroke among younger persons are low 
and are less dependent on modifiable risk fac-
tors and on the characteristics of health sys-
tems, which are associated with stroke burden 
in older populations.
Statistical Analysis
Point estimates and 95% uncertainty intervals 
representing the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles 
around the estimate were used to compare re-
sults between groups. Differences in the esti-
mates of the risk of stroke were considered to be 
significant when the 95% uncertainty intervals 
did not overlap or when the 95% uncertainty 
interval for relative percentage change did not 
include zero.
Results
Global, Regional, and National Lifetime Risks 
of Stroke
In 2016, the global lifetime risk of stroke from 
the age of 25 years onward was 24.9% (95% un-
certainty interval, 23.5 to 26.2), and there were 
regional and between-country differences (Table 1, 
and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
China had the highest estimated risk (39.3%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 37.5 to 41.1), and the 
risks were similarly high in Bosnia and Herze-
govina, Bulgaria, Latvia, Macedonia, Montene-
gro, Romania, and Russia. Among the 21 GBD 
regions, East Asia had the highest risk (38.8%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 37.0 to 40.6), followed 
by Central Europe (31.7%; 95% uncertainty in-
terval, 30.0 to 33.3) and Eastern Europe (31.6%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 27.6 to 35.6); eastern 
sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest risk (11.8%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 10.9 to 12.8). When 
the risks were compared across SDI quintiles, 
the high-middle–SDI countries had the greatest 
risk (31.1%; 95% uncertainty interval, 29.0 to 
33.0), followed by the middle-SDI countries 
(29.3%; 95% uncertainty interval, 27.8 to 30.8); 
the low-SDI countries had the lowest risk (13.2%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 12.3 to 14.2). The risk 
was 23.5% (95% uncertainty interval, 22.2 to 
24.8) in high-SDI countries.
Competing Risk of Death from Any Cause 
Other Than Stroke
Because death from any cause other than stroke 
is a competing risk with respect to stroke and 
death from stroke, the hypothetical national life-
time risk of stroke was calculated under the as-
sumption that all countries had the same mean 
risk of death from any cause other than stroke 
as that in the high-SDI countries, and the results 
are shown in Figures S1A through S1C and Table 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. In this hypo-
thetical model, the lifetime risk of stroke would 
no longer be the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The largest increases in lifetime risk of stroke on 
account of a lower rate of death from any cause 
other than stroke in this scenario would be in 
Oceania (from 16% to 30%), sub-Saharan Africa 
(from 12% to 22%), and South Asia (from 15% 
to 21%). Smaller increases were seen in other 
low-SDI and middle-SDI countries; these find-
ings reflect geographic variation in the compet-
ing risk of death from any cause other than 
stroke as a major determinant of lifetime stroke 
risk (Fig. S9A through S9R in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Lifetime Risk According to Sex, Age,  
and Stroke Type
In 2016, the global lifetime risk of stroke among 
men (24.7%; 95% uncertainty interval, 23.3 to 
26.0) was not significantly different from that 
among women (25.1%; 95% uncertainty interval, 
23.7 to 26.5) (Table 1), but there were regional 
and between-country differences in sex-specific 
risk (Table 1 and Fig. 1, and Fig. S10A and S10B 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The greatest 
risk among men was in China (41.1%; 95% un-
certainty interval 39.2 to 42.9); among women in 
China, the risk was 36.7% (95% uncertainty in-
terval, 35.0 to 38.6), which accounted for the 
largest difference in risk between men and 
women among the nations. The greatest risk 
among women was in Latvia (41.7%; 95% uncer-
tainty interval, 37.7 to 45.4), and the risks among 
women in Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herze-
govina, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Macedonia, Monte-

Global Lifetime Risks of Stroke
negro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, and 
Ukraine were similar. Among 21 GBD regions, 
the highest lifetime risk among men was in East 
Asia (40.6%; 95% uncertainty interval, 38.7 to 
42.3), whereas the highest lifetime risks among 
women were in both Eastern Europe (36.5%; 
95% uncertainty interval, 31.2 to 41.9) and East 
Asia (36.3%; 95% uncertainty interval, 34.5 to 
38.1) (Table 1, and Fig. S2B and S2C in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
When the lifetime risk of stroke was com-
pared between women and men on a regional 
basis, the risk was significantly higher among 
women in central Latin America, southern and 
western sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and 
the Middle East, South Asia, and Central Europe. 
There was less variation according to sex in the 
lifetime risk of hemorrhagic stroke than in the 
risk of ischemic stroke. The lifetime risk of ische-
mic stroke was approximately double that of 
hemorrhagic stroke among both men and women 
across different regions and SDI quintiles (Ta-
bles S3 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In 2016, the remaining lifetime risk of stroke 
at age 25 years and at age 70 years did not differ 
significantly for either sex (24.7% [95% uncer-
tainty interval, 23.3 to 26.0] and 22.6% [95% 
uncertainty interval, 21.0 to 24.1], respectively, 
among men and 25.1% [95% uncertainty inter-
val, 23.7 to 26.5] and 22.3% [95% uncertainty 
interval, 20.6 to 23.9], respectively, among women) 
(Table 1, and Table S3 and Fig. S11A and S11B 
in the Supplementary Appendix). For each age 
category greater than 70 years, the remaining 
lifetime risk of stroke decreased, reaching 13.4% 
(95% uncertainty interval, 11.8 to 15.1) among 
adults 95 years of age (Fig. 2, and Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Similar age patterns in lifetime risk were ap-
parent for both ischemic stroke and hemor-
rhagic stroke across all SDI quintiles, with less 
difference between age groups in the risk of 
hemorrhagic stroke in low-middle–SDI and low-
SDI countries (Fig. S4 through S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The sum of the lifetime 
risks of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, 
as determined in separate analyses, was greater 
than the risk of stroke because it is possible to 
have both subtypes of stroke over a lifetime.
 
Lifetime Risk in 2016 as Compared with 1990
The estimates of global lifetime risk of stroke 
increased from 22.8% in 1990 to 24.9% in 2016, 
representing a relative increase of 8.9% (95% 
uncertainty interval, 6.2 to 11.5) (Table 1, and 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix); the 
difference is significant, as reflected by the ex-
clusion of zero in the uncertainty interval. The 
increase in the risk was greater among men 
(15.4%; 95% uncertainty interval, 12.5 to 18.2) 
than among women (3.2%; 95% uncertainty in-
terval, 0.2 to 6.1), and the increase in the risk of

ischemic stroke (12.7%; 95% uncertainty inter-
val, 8.9 to 16.3) was greater than that of hemor-
rhagic stroke (4.0%; 95% uncertainty interval, 
0.2 to 7.6). The lifetime risk of stroke in western 
and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa 
and the Middle East, Central Europe, East Asia, 
South Asia, and Southeast Asia increased sig-
nificantly between 1990 and 2016. The risk in 
Central Asia, southern and tropical Latin Amer-
ica, high-income Asia–Pacific, and southern sub-
Saharan Africa decreased significantly between 
1990 and 2016. In the remaining GBD regions, 
there were no significant changes in the esti-
mated risk between these years.
 
Discussion
The global lifetime risk of stroke from the age 
of 25 years onward is estimated to have in-
creased from 22.8% in 1990 to 24.9% in 2016, 
with the change in the risk of ischemic stroke 
exceeding that of hemorrhagic stroke. This in-
crease is the result of unchanged or increasing 
stroke incidence in many middle-SDI countries 
and declines in the competing risks of death 
from any cause other than stroke. The estimated 
global lifetime risk of stroke has declined with 
increasing age, in part owing to age-related 
competing risks of other diseases. In low-SDI 
countries (generally, countries with the youngest 
populations, such as those in sub-Saharan Afri-
ca), the estimated lower lifetime risk of stroke is 
the result of a high competing risk of death 
from any cause other than stroke at both young-
er and older ages and does not necessarily repre-
sent a lower incidence of stroke or more effective 
prevention and treatment strategies.2,17
Many of the national estimated lifetime risks 
of stroke reported here are similar to or higher 
than those observed in specific populations in 
Figure 2. Global Lifetime Risks of Stroke According to Pathological Subtype and Age, 2016.
Shown is the relationship between lifetime risk of stroke and age. Lifetime risk is the cumulative probability of a dis-
ease developing in a person of a given age and sex during that person’s remaining lifespan, after accounting for com-
peting risks of death); the modeled age starts at 25 years. Each colored line represents a trend of the relationship 
for the specified pathological subtype of stroke, and the shaded area around each line represents the 95% uncer-
tainty interval. The category of stroke included ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.

Global Lifetime Risks of Stroke
the same country in studies other than the GBD 
Study, such as in the Framingham Heart Study 
cohort in the United States (lifetime risk of 
stroke of 21.1% among women and 16.9% 
among men),18 in a Japanese cohort (lifetime risk 
of stroke of 18.9% among men and 20.2% 
among women),8 and in a Chinese cohort (life-
time risk of stroke of 18.0% among men and 
14.7% among women).7 A study of stroke in the 
Netherlands showed that the risk among men 
was 22.8%, which is similar to our estimate for 
that country, but the risk among women (29.8%) 
was lower than our estimate.9 We estimated 
ischemic stroke to be more frequent than hem-
orrhagic stroke — a finding that is similar to 
those of other population-based studies.6,8,12,13,19
Regional variation in lifetime cardiovascular 
risk across subpopulations has been shown pre-
viously in the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pool-
ing Project and is compatible with our finding 
of large geographic variation in lifetime risk of 
stroke.10 Our findings that the lifetime risk of 
stroke is similar among men and among women 
are in accord with some other observations; 
however, there have been studies8-10,19 in which 
the risk was greater among women than among 
men, and the reasons for these differences be-
tween studies are unclear. In the comparative 
risk assessment performed in the GBD Study,4,20 
elevated blood pressure was estimated as the 
leading attributable risk factor for stroke across 
all SDI quintiles, with greater attribution to air 
pollution and low intake of fruit in low-SDI 
countries and high body-mass index and high 
fasting plasma glucose levels in high-SDI coun-
tries.
The use of estimates of lifetime risk of dis-
ease is a new metric for the GBD Study, which 
has previously published summary measures of 
health including years of life lost prematurely, 
years lived with disability,2,3,20 and stroke burden 
associated with various risk factors.4 Knowledge 
of lifetime risk may be useful for stroke preven-
tion and public education. High estimates of 
lifetime risk of stroke suggest that there is pos-
sible value of measures for the primary preven-
tion of stroke throughout a person’s lifespan and 
suggest that strategies to reduce cardiovascular 
risk remain relevant for both younger and older 
adults.
The main strength of our study was the sys-
tematic use of data and methods that allow for 
comparable estimates of lifetime risk of stroke 
among different locations and between differ-
ent years. We provide estimates of lifetime risk 
of stroke only among persons 25 years of age 
or older in contrast to other studies that esti-
mated lifetime risk of stroke among persons 45 
years of age or older.6,8-10 Furthermore, the es-
timates of lifetime risk of stroke that we pro-
vide account for competing risk of death from 
any cause other than stroke and represent 
whole populations, possibly making the results 
generalizable.
The epidemiologic approaches used in our 
study have limitations. The accuracy of the esti-
mates of lifetime risk of stroke was limited by 
the accuracy and availability of epidemiologic 
data from the countries studied. There was a 
lack of sufficient epidemiologic data on stroke 
incidence and case fatality for most countries in 
the world. In these countries, estimates were 
dependent on geospatial statistical models that 
incorporated data from neighboring countries 
and data on country-level risk exposure. The 
ability to differentiate stroke from other acute 
neurologic events and to differentiate ischemic 
from hemorrhagic stroke was impeded by the 
nature of health system in each country, differ-
ences in clinical practice or availability of health 
care, the technology available to diagnose strokes, 
and the customary manner of coding disease 
entities in each country. We did not differentiate 
between subarachnoid hemorrhagic and intrace-
rebral hemorrhagic stroke; these were combined 
in the estimate of hemorrhagic stroke. There is 
significant variation in stroke burden within 
large countries, and our results represent only 
the mean national risk. Finally, we analyzed only 
the lifetime risk of first-ever stroke and not re-
current stroke.
In conclusion, our study provided global, re-
gional, and country-specific estimates of the 
lifetime risk of stroke according to sex and age, 
although the precision of the estimates is limit-
ed by insufficient data in some countries. The 
global lifetime risk of stroke is approximately 
25% starting at the age of 25 years among both 
men and women, and there is large geographic 
variation, with a particularly high lifetime risk 
of stroke in East Asia, Central Europe, and East-
ern Europe.
