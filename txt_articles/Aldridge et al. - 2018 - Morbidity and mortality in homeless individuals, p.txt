Summary
Background Inclusion health focuses on people in extremely poor health due to poverty, marginalisation, and 
multimorbidity. We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience 
considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and 
imprisoned individuals.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, 
interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in 
English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, 
sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and 
studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency 
hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from 
published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality 
(standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates). Summary estimates were calculated using a random 
effects model.
Findings Our search identified 7946 articles, of which 337 studies were included for analysis. All-cause standardised 
mortality ratios were significantly increased in 91 (99%) of 92 extracted datapoints and were 11·86 (95% CI 
10·42–13·30; I²=94·1%) in female individuals and 7·88 (7·03–8·74; I²=99·1%) in men. Summary SMR estimates for 
the International Classification of Diseases disease categories with two or more included datapoints were highest for 
deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, in both men (7·89; 95% CI 6·40–9·37; I²=98·1%) and 
women (18·72; 13·73–23·71; I²=91·5%). Disease prevalence was consistently raised across the following categories: 
infections (eg, highest reported was 90% for hepatitis C, 67 [65%] of 103 individuals for hepatitis B, and 133 [51%] of 
263 individuals for latent tuberculosis infection), mental health (eg, highest reported was 9 [4%] of 227 individuals for 
schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (eg, highest reported was 32 [13%] of 247 individuals for coronary heart 
disease), and respiratory conditions (eg, highest reported was 9 [26%] of 35 individuals for asthma).
Interpretation Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, 
and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the 
relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between 
studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health 
inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health 
outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

Introduction
Inclusion health is a research, service, and policy agenda 
that aims to prevent and redress health and social 
inequities among people in extremely poor health due to 
poverty, marginalisation, and multimorbidity.1 The 
association between socio 
economic status and health 
outcomes is well established. However, these commonly 
observed social gradients in health do not capture the full 
extent of health in 
equities for individuals who experience 
considerable social exclusion.
Previous research has described the high prevalence of 
substance use disorders in homeless populations,2 prison­
ers,3 and sex workers,4 and the increased prev 
alence 
of homelessness in prisoners5 and sex workers.6 These

marginalised populations have common inter 
secting 
characteristics and adverse life experiences that lead to 
considerable social exclusion, making them powerful 
determinants of marginalisation in high­income settings.7
When considered separately, marginalised popu 
lations 
have been shown to have high all­cause mortality.8–10 
However, despite the considerable overlap in risk factors 
and the substantially increased mortality observed in 
these populations, no previous review has examined the 
outcomes of these groups together.
No universally agreed theoretical framework exists to 
describe inclusion health. In this Article, we build on 
existing social exclusion theory and consider the so­called 
linked and cumulative factors and processes that confound 
individual and group capacity for hope, opportunity, 
reciprocity, and participation.11 Our analysis is also 
informed by an intersectionality perspective, which 
focuses on how social characteristics combine to have an 
effect on health.2,12
Our systematic review therefore aims to examine 
mortality and morbidity in homeless populations, 
prisoners, sex workers, and individuals with substance 
use disorders, who experience considerable exclusion.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta­analysis, we 
searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase 
for articles published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. 
Full search terms are provided in the appendix. We 
searched for articles about the populations of interest 
(homeless individuals, prisoners, sex workers, and 
individuals with substance use disorders, excluding 
cannabis and alcohol use) from systematic reviews, 
meta­analyses, inter 
ventional studies, and observational 
studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes. We 
included studies identified from references of included 
articles. We only included full­text articles published in 
English that were done in high­income countries 
(classified according to the World Bank classification13). 
We excluded studies with only perinatal outcomes and 
did not include data on perinatal outcomes from studies 
that otherwise met our inclusion criteria. We excluded 
articles that limited the study population to individuals 
with a specific health condition and studies that recruited 
participants exclusively from intensive care or high 
dependency hospital units.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A comprehensive body of research exists on the health effect of 
inequity, much of which focuses on disparities in morbidity 
and mortality, and is based on common measures of 
socioeconomic status, such as neighbourhood deprivation and 
occupational class. A consistent association has been found 
between ill health and increasing levels of social deprivation, 
which has underpinned a broad range of social policies and 
public health initiatives. Such analyses cannot adequately 
assess the extent of health inequity faced by individuals who 
experience considerable social exclusion. In preparation for this 
Review, we searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and 
Embase databases for articles published between Jan 1, 2005, 
and Sept 30, 2013. We searched for systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies containing 
morbidity and mortality outcomes for the four inclusion health 
populations of interest (substance use disorders, homeless 
populations, prisoners, and sex workers). We only included 
full-text articles published in English. Full search terms are 
listed in the appendix. The studies identified described the 
highly overlapping nature of inclusion health populations, 
the increased risk factors for disease, and poor mortality 
outcomes compared with the general population. Previous 
systematic reviews have analysed health outcomes of 
individual inclusion health populations, but none have 
examined the populations together.
Added value of this study
Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides the first 
comprehensive examination to date of morbidity and 
mortality outcomes across a range of inclusion health 
populations. We found that the extent of the health inequity 
seen in our inclusion health populations greatly exceeded 
that previously observed between populations with high and 
low socioeconomic status and was consistent across inclusion 
health populations. Mortality rates are extremely high across 
the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision 
disease categories in inclusion health populations, and our 
review is the first to show that relative risks are consistently 
higher in female than male individuals.
Implications of all the available evidence
The extreme burden of disease experienced by inclusion health 
populations demands a cross-sectoral response to prevent 
considerable social exclusion and an improvement in services 
that work with these populations. Our analyses focused on 
relative measures of mortality and therefore future work should 
examine absolute measures in greater detail. Inclusion health 
populations are often invisible within routine health data. 
This limitation can be addressed by modifying the instruments 
used to collect such data or through data linkage studies. 
Services that provide for inclusion health populations should 
aim to deliver health and social services for overlapping 
marginalised groups to tackle the poor health outcomes found 
in this study. These services should also have a greater focus on 
prevention and management of more common conditions in 
addition to those traditionally considered high risk for inclusion 
health groups.

We recognise that social exclusion has a major effect on 
health in other social groups, including Gypsies and 
Travellers, migrants, ethnic minorities, indigenous com­
munities, and sexual and gender minorities. Although 
these groups experience social exclusion in many high­
income settings, they were considered beyond the scope 
of this systematic review.
Data analysis
RWA screened titles, abstracts, and full texts using 
Covidence systematic review software. All authors con­
tributed to data extraction, and data were double­checked 
by a second researcher (RWA, EJT, GH, or SVK).
Extracted items included study design, year or years of 
study, country, number of participants, primary out 
comes, 
and summary descriptions of the study popu 
lation. We 
tried to contact authors if we were unable to locate papers 
or required additional information about the data or study.
We attempted to identify and exclude duplicate data 
from research studies presented in separate publications. 
For cases in which we identified multiple studies with 
duplicated or overlapping data (by population, time, place, 
and outcome) we selected the study with the largest or 
most representative sample size, and when these were 
also similar, we present the most recent study. We followed 
the PRISMA reporting guidelines in the presentation of 
our manuscript. A review protocol was not published 
before this review was done.
Outcomes included were measures of morbidity and 
mortality for conditions defined in the International 
Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD­10). Out­
comes were reported using a variety of measures. To 
ensure maximum comparability across studies for mor­
tality outcomes, we extracted, in order of pref 
erence, the 
first of the following measures: standardised mortality 
ratio (SMR), hazard ratio, mortality rate ratio, or crude 
mortality rate. For consistency with most studies included 
in this Article, we have not multiplied SMRs by 100. In our 
results, a value of 1 equates to no difference between the 
expected and observed mortality rate. For morbidity 
outcomes, we extracted, in order of preference, the first of 
the following measures: prevalence, incidence, prevalence 
risk ratio, incidence rate ratio, prevalence odds ratio, or 
incidence odds ratio. When available, we used data in 
which the comparison group was a socially deprived 
population or measures were adjusted for area­based or 
income­based deprivation.
A link to all extracted data is included in the appendix. 
For the quantitative findings analysed in this study, we 
focused the synthesis on SMRs. SMRs for all­cause 
mortality and by ICD­10 disease category were summar­
ised in forest plots. We anticipated high levels of 
heterogeneity, and therefore did summary estimates with 
random effects models using Stata version 13. We used 
the I² statistic to indicate the proportion of total 
variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity.14 
We explored potential sources of hetero 
geneity by 
stratifying the analyses by country and by inclusion 
health population group.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, writing 
of the report, or the decision to submit the paper for 
publication. All authors had full access to all the data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
We identified 7946 articles, of which 1274 were duplicates 
(figure 1). Of the 711 full­text articles retrieved, 418 met 
the inclusion criteria. We excluded a further 81 articles 
because of overlapping data. A total of 337 studies were 
included in this Article, which included 2835 datapoints 
(ie, effect estimates for a unique population) after the 
removal of 384 duplicates.
The studies were from 38 countries (appendix). The 
USA contributed 698 datapoints, Australia contributed 
460, Sweden contributed 309, Canada contributed 257, and 
the UK contributed 234. Populations with substance use 
disorders were the most studied subgroup, accounting for 
1193 (42·1%) of 2835 datapoints, followed by prisoners 
(769 [27·1%]), homeless populations (754 [26·6%]), and sex 
workers (119 [4·2%]).
Infectious diseases and mental and behavioural dis 
orders 
were the two most studied ICD­10 categories with infectious 
diseases accounting for 898 (31·6%) of 2835 datapoints, 
and mental and behavioural disorders accounting for

715 (25·2%) datapoints (figure 2, appendix p 4). Injury and 
poisoning only accounted for 98 (3·4%) of all extracted 
datapoints.
Our all­cause meta­analyses focused on SMRs 
and included 29 studies,8–10,15–40 which contributed 
92 datapoints (table, figure 3, appendix). 91 (99%) of the 
92 all­cause SMRs were increased and overall we estimated 
that summary all­cause SMRs were higher in female 
individuals (11·86 [95% CI 10·42–13·30]; I²=94·1%; 
figure 3) than male individuals (7·88 [7·03–8·74]; 
I²=99·1%; figure 3). We provide summary estimates of 
SMRs; however, the I² statistic indicated that data were 
heterogeneous in many of our analyses and therefore 
these summary measures must be interpreted with 
appropriate caution. Heterogeneity was not substantially 
reduced when analyses were stratified by population 
subgroup (appendix). Insufficient data were available to 
do subgroup analyses by country.
Summary SMRs were higher in female individuals 
than in male individuals for mortality in each of the 
ICD­10 categories (appendix pp 6–7). In some ICD­10 
categories, the summary SMRs for both sexes combined 
did not fall between the male and female estimates 
because the meta­analyses used data from different 
studies (rather than the estimate for both sexes combined 
being drawn from the male and female populations).
We identified 201 papers reporting outcomes for 
infectious and parasitic diseases. Summary estimates of 
SMRs for infectious diseases were increased in male 
individuals (2·83 [95% CI 1·61–4·05]; I²=65·4%; 
appendix p 6) and female individuals (5·58 [1·46–9·70]; 
I²=60·0%; appendix p 6) and both sexes combined 
(11·43 [6·91–15·94; I²=97·0%; appendix p 6). Disease 
prevalence was high but heterogeneous and ranged from 
0%41 to 54% for HIV infection,42 from less than 0·1%43 to 
90%42 for hepatitis C, from 2% (two of 119)44 to 65% 
(67 of 103)45 for hepatitis B, and from 1% (one of 82)46 to 
51% (133 of 263)47 for latent tuberculosis infection.
Summary estimates of SMRs for injury, poisoning, and 
other external causes were the highest across all of the

ICD­10 categories, in male individuals (7·89 [95% CI 
6·40–9·37]; I²=98·1%; appendix p 7), female individuals 
(18·72 [13·73–23·71]; I²=91·5%; appendix p 7), and both 
sexes combined (23·53 [15·34–31·71]; I²=99·6%; appendix 
p 7). However, these categories only accounted for 98 (3%) 
of 2835 extracted datapoints. Summary SMR estimates 
were also increased for external causes of morbidity and 
mortality in male individuals (6·52 [95% CI 5·54–7·51; 
I²=97·4%; appendix p 7), female individuals (13·15 
[9·87–16·43]; I²=93·7%; appendix p 7), and both sexes 
combined (8·50 [6·89–10·10]; I²=97·5%; appendix p 7). No 
data from studies that included sex workers were used in 
any of the SMR estimates for injuries or external causes.
SMRs for mental and behavioural disorders for male 
individuals and female individuals were exclusively from 
prison populations and data for both sexes combined 
were from populations with substance use disorders 
only. Only two studies included data on male individuals, 
one study on female individuals, and two studies on both 
sexes combined. Prevalence of major depression in 
inclusion health populations ranged from 3% (one of 
38 individuals)48 in the month before assessment to 
a 53% (25 of 47 individuals)49 lifetime prevalence. 
Prevalence of schizophrenia ranged from 0·9% (212 of 
23 530 individuals; we estimated the numerator on the 
basis of data in the original article)50 to 4% (nine of 
227 individuals),51 and from 0% (none of 53 individuals)49 
to 45% (221 of 495 individuals; numerator estimated)52 
for bipolar disorder.
Summary estimates of SMRs for neoplasms were 
increased in male individuals (1·61 [95% CI 1·30–1·92]; 
I²=88·7%; appendix p 6), female individuals (1·91

[1·33–2·49]; I²=62·8%; appendix p 6), and both sexes 
combined (2·20 [1·61–2·79]; I²=90·6%; appendix p 6). 
Only 44 studies reported cardiovascular outcomes, 
accounting for 149 (5%) of 2835 datapoints extracted for 
this Article. Summary SMRs for diseases of the 
circulatory system were increased in male individuals 
(2·44 [95% CI 1·48–3·41]; I²=94·5%; appendix p 6), 
female individuals (3·13 [1·75–4·52]; I²=51·5%; appendix 
p 6), and both sexes combined (2·91 [2·04–3·77]; 
I²=85·8%; appendix p 6). The prevalence of coronary 
artery disease was 13% (32 of 247 individuals).53 
Standardised mortality ratios for respiratory diseases 
were only reported for populations with substance use 
disorders and prison populations, ranging from 1·8 
(95% CI 1·5–2·1)8 in male Scottish prisoners to 7·9 
(5·1–11·8) in populations with substance use disorders 
in Australia.22 The prevalence of asthma ranged from 
5·0% (10 525 of 210 501 individuals; numerator esti­
mated)54 to 26% (nine of 35 individuals).55 Summary 
SMRs for gastrointestinal conditions included only data 
from prison populations and populations of individuals 
with substance use disorders, and were higher in 
female individuals (7·89 [95% CI 5·81–9·97]; I²=66·1%; 
appendix p 6) than male individuals (3·37 [2·58–4·15]; 
I²=93·1%; appendix p 6).
Discussion
The excess mortality associated with considerable social 
exclusion is extreme. We found all­cause mortality 
SMRs of 7·9 in male individuals and 11·9 in female 
individuals. By comparison, mortality rates for individuals 
aged 15–64 years in the most deprived areas of England 
and Wales are 2·8 times higher than those in the least 
deprived areas for male individuals and 2·1 times higher 
for female individuals.56 The relative excesses were 
greatest for injury, poisoning, and external causes, but 
extend across almost all health conditions and across the 
inclusion health populations that we studied.
The available body of evidence is largest for infectious 
diseases, with a substantial amount of existing research 
on morbidity associated with mental and behavioural 
disorders. By contrast, evidence on non­communicable 
diseases and injury, poisoning, and external causes is 
scarce despite these causes having the highest SMRs 
across ICD­10 categories in our study. SMRs across 
disease categories were consistently higher in female 
than male individuals. Of the four inclusion health 
populations considered, sex workers were the least well 
investigated, which should be addressed as a matter of 
priority in future research.
Our study comprehensively describes for the first time, 
to our knowledge, the relative mortality and morbidity 
burden in selected inclusion health populations. We have 
reviewed the existing literature in this area using a 
comprehensive search strategy to identify the balance of 
evidence available to inform policy making around 
inclusion health. Data were extracted and reviewed by a 
second author to reduce the likelihood of errors. Our 
approach enabled the identification of relative gaps in both 
categories of disease and inclusion health categories. Our 
analysis was informed by an intersectionality perspective, 
which focuses on how social characteristics in combination 
affect health.7,57 We have therefore specifically investigated 
how the health consequences of exclusion might vary as a 
result of other socially influenced characteristics, with 
differences between sexes being particularly noteworthy.
However, several limitations should be considered. 
Caution must be taken when interpreting the summary 
estimates because of the heterogeneity of studies. The 
absence of internationally agreed definitions of inclusion 
health groups is likely to explain some of this variation. 
Similarly, comparison groups varied, with some studies 
using the general population and others using groups 
living in socially deprived areas. Studies also varied 
according to the extent of adjustment for social 
deprivation and other risk factors. We used a random­
effects method and noted the recommendations58 that 
meta­analyses should be pursued whenever possible, 
acknowledging heterogeneity. We limited our search to 
articles published from 2005 onwards and therefore we 
have not examined longer­term trends. Furthermore, for 
pragmatic reasons, we were unable to investigate other 
health inclusion groups and believe that further work is 
needed to describe their health experiences.
We found that the SMRs were consistently higher for 
female than male individuals. Because general popu­
lation mortality rates are lower in female individuals 
than male individuals for most conditions, this result 
does not necessarily indicate that outcomes were worse 
in female inclusion health groups than in male groups. 
These results might reflect an increased vulnerability of 
women in inclusion health populations or different risk 
distributions among female individuals and male 
individuals in inclusion health groups. SMRs are a 
relative measure, and the lower (but still greater than 1)
SMRs for more common diseases such as cardiovascular 
disease and cancer than for other conditions might 
underplay the number of excess cases of mortality that 
occurred as a result of these conditions. Conversely, high 
SMRs might not indicate a large number of excess deaths 
if the condition is rare. Further work should report 
absolute as well as relative measures of mortality.
These extreme inequities demand an intensive cross­
sectoral policy and service response to prevent exclusion 
and improve health outcomes. An accompanying Review,1 
published in The Lancet outlines interventions that 
respond to these increases in morbidity and mortality.

Determining the burden of disease remains challeng­
ing in inclusion health populations because membership 
of such populations is not recorded in most vital 
registration and health information systems. Deaths and 
health service use in excluded populations are therefore 
largely invisible and neglected aspects of routine 
statistics. By contrast, the availability of area­based 
measures of social deprivation across high­income 
countries has allowed the impact of less extreme social 
inequalities to be measured at the major population 
level. The outcomes of these measure 
ments have sup­
ported extensive cross­sectoral policy initiatives to 
address these inequities.59 Better routine data is also 
needed to drive the policy response to the inclusion 
health agenda.
Two broad potential approaches are available to address 
this problem. First, health services could routinely record 
membership of health inclusion groups. This would 
require agreed definitions of each group. Individuals 
responsible for recording data would need guidance 
to help them ascertain membership and avoid re­
inforcement of stigma.60 The feasibility of this approach 
outside 
of 
specialist 
services 
remains 
unclear. 
Alternatively, and more feasibly in the short term, data 
linkage methods could be used to match data from 
services that work with inclusion health groups, with 
vital registration data, electronic health records, and 
existing disease surveillance systems.61 Data linkage has 
been the primary method used to estimate SMRs in the 
studies reported in this Article. These linked datasets 
would facilitate systematic estimates of mortality and 
morbidity over time and help to measure the effect of 
interventions.
To inform the content of this Article and the accomp­
anying Review1 we held an engagement workshop with 
16 people with experience of homelessness and social 
exclusion. We asked this group about their views on 
collecting operational data with ethical and appropriate 
research governance approvals, but without specific 
individual level consent. Although this sample was only 
small (and we acknowledge that people who face exclusion 
and are willing to attend a workshop might differ from 
those who do not), acceptability of collection of this sort of 
data was extremely high. 13 (100%) of 13 participants were 
happy for homeless hostel records to be collected, eight 
(73%) of 11 agreed to the collection of criminal records, 
eight (62%) of 13 to health records, and 11 (85%) of 13 to 
these records being linked together.
A vertical approach to tackling inclusion health (ie, one 
that focuses on specific diseases or specific risk groups) 
can overlook multimorbidity and the social issues faced 
by excluded populations.62 This approach can result in 
inefficiencies and missed opportunities for pre 
vention, 
early 
diagnosis, 
and 
management, 
and 
missed 
opportunities for mitigation of social risk factors. The 
emerging field of inclusion health should advocate for 
and deliver joined up health and social services for 
overlapping marginalised groups. These services should 
address not only diseases with extreme disparities, but 
also prevention and management of more common 
conditions with a lower relative risk but high excess 
mortality, such as cardiovascular disease. The ability of 
health and social policy to address the needs of the most 
marginalised populations should be a key indicator of 
quality. Such initiatives need to be sup 
ported by 
information systems that can provide data for continuing 
advocacy, guide service development, and monitor the 
health of marginalised populations over time.
Our study highlights an extreme health inequity that 
persists in high­income countries. An inclusion health 
policy response must build on the evidence regarding 
who is at risk and the events that trigger exclusion to 
highlight the social and economic benefits of sustained 
action to prevent social exclusion.
