Abstract
Objective—The main objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary information about 
how telomere length (TL) varies in relation to exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) in children living in a highly polluted city.
Methods—We conducted a cross-sectional study of children living in Fresno, California (n=14). 
Subjects with and without asthma were selected based on their annual average PAH level in the 
12-months prior to their blood draw. We measured relative telomere length from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC).
Results—We found an inverse linear relationship between average PAH level and telomere 
length (TL) (R2 = 0.69), as well as between age and TL (R2 = 0.21). Asthmatics had shorter mean 
telomere length than non-asthmatics (TLasthmatic=1.13, TLnon-asthmatic=1.29).
Conclusions—These preliminary findings suggest that exposure to ambient PAH may play a 
role in telomere shortening.

 Introduction
In many urban settings, ambient air pollution is a major public health concern because of the 
associated burden of disease. According to the World Health Organization, outdoor air 
pollution is responsible for about 3.7 million deaths annually on a global basis (1). In the 
United States, exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 (particulate diameter ≤2.5 μm) may 
contribute to as much as 20% of total mortality (2). Air pollutants also appear to play an 
important role in the onset of many chronic diseases including asthma, lung cancer, ischemic 
heart disease and stroke (3–6). A number of epidemiological studies have demonstrated that 
exposures to particulate matter and ozone were associated with increases in 
cardiopulmonary mortality (7,8). Despite this mounting evidence, the exact underlying 
mechanisms by which air pollutants cause adverse cardiopulmonary health outcomes are not 
clear.
Animal studies have suggested several biological mechanisms to explain how air pollution 
induces disease outcomes (9). One possible mechanism is that the free radicals generated 
during the incomplete combustion of fossil-fuel products cause oxidative stress within the 
respiratory and cardiovascular systems (10). Oxidative stress occurs when free radicals 
exceed the relative amount of antioxidants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a common class 
of free radical, are generated with inhalation of certain air pollutants. Evidence from a 
number of epidemiological studies indicates that air pollution causes oxidative stress, which 
is capable of damaging lipids, proteins, and DNA (10–12). Since telomeres play a critical 
role in chromosome stability and cell viability, it is reasonable to use telomere length as a 
biomarker for air pollution induced cytotoxicity.
Recent studies of telomere length and exposure to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants 
in healthy adults have found shortening of telomeres associated with increasing air pollution 
levels (13,14). Telomeres are multiple short sequences of DNA located at the end of linear 
eukaryotic chromosomes (5′AGGGTT2′) (15). Maintenance of telomere length is important 
for cell viability because cells with short telomeres lose their ability to divide and become 
senescent or undergo apoptosis (16). In addition, telomeres protect chromosomes against 
inappropriate recombination and fusion with other broken chromosomes, which can 
potentially lead to malfunction, cancer, or cell death (15,16). Since the guanine base is more 
prone to be oxidized than other DNA bases, the high guanine content of the telomere 
sequence makes telomeric DNA vulnerable to oxidative stress (17,18).
Children may be especially vulnerable to the effects of telomeric DNA damage due to their 
physical development as well as developing immune system. One study has shown different 
telomere attrition rates among newborns, their parents, and grandparents (19). This suggests 
that children may have different telomere regulation than adults and thus may be 
differentially susceptible to effects of air pollution
As the first step towards a better understanding of the long-term health effects of traffic-
related air pollution on telomere length, we conducted a pilot study to gather information 
about how telomere length varies in relation to air pollution, age, sex, and asthma status. In 
this study, we focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are a class of

 chemical compounds characterized by fused benzene rings (20). PAHs are produced during 
incomplete combustion of organic matter. They exist in ambient air in both gas and particle 
phases (adsorbed to particulate matter). In many urban environments, motor vehicle exhaust 
is the main source of high-molecular-weight PAHs (four to six rings), which are more 
carcinogenic and mutagenic than low-molecular-weight PAHs (two- and three-rings) (21). 
Ambient concentrations of PAHs in the United States range from 0.02–1.2 ng/m3 in rural 
areas, and 0.15–57.1 ng/m3 in urban environments (22–25). PAHs are ubiquitous ambient air 
pollutants in Fresno and can be transformed into quinones in the atmosphere (25–27). 
Quinones can serve as catalysts in redox cycling and generate free radicals (26,27).
Methods
All methods and procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of Stanford 
University and the University of California, Berkeley.
Study subjects
Subjects were selected from a larger population of children enrolled in an ongoing study of 
asthma in Fresno, CA (Figure 1). They were age 11 to 18 years old, living in Fresno, 
California. Fresno is located in the center of the San Joaquin Valley, which is part of the 
Central Valley in California. Fresno is the second-most polluted city in the United States, in 
terms of 24-hour average PM2.5 (28) and has a high prevalence of asthma (29). For the pilot 
study, 14 subjects were selected from high- and low-exposure groups, as defined by annual 
average 24-hour outdoor residential exposure to PAHs in the 12 months prior to their blood 
draw (2009–2012). The high-exposure group was defined as above the 80th percentile of 
PAH exposures and the low-exposure group below the 10th percentile. An equal number of 
subjects (n=7) were selected from the high- and low-exposure groups.
Study participants came from two related studies, the initial Fresno Asthmatic Children’s 
Environment Study (FACES), and the subsequent Children’s Health and Air Pollution Study 
(CHAPS). FACES was a longitudinal cohort study designed to follow children with asthma. 
CHAPS focused on the health risks of air pollution exposure in both asthmatic and non-
asthmatic children in the San Joaquin Valley. Of the 14 subjects in the pilot, 5 were 
asthmatic, originally recruited for FACES, and 9 non-asthmatic subjects were recruited for 
CHAPS. At the baseline interview, all subjects provided detailed information on their 
general history and respiratory health. FACES study participants had asthma and underwent 
pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and skin prick testing for 14 aeroallergens common 
in the Fresno area. CHAPS subjects were defined as non-asthmatic and non-allergic if they 
had (1) no reported physician diagnosis of asthma, (2) normal pulmonary function test 
results, (3) total IgE (immunoglobulin E) <10IU/mL, and (4) negative skin test results. 
Further details on the study design and cohort characteristics can be found in papers 
published elsewhere (30–33).
Individual PAH exposure estimates
To estimate the daily individual exposures to ambient PAHs, we developed a land use-
regression model using PAH measurements from both a central monitoring site and outdoor

 residential samples from a subset of FACES participants’ homes. .The filter-based PAH 
samples provided concentrations for 14 PAHs. However, we chose to use the sum of the 
mass concentrations of PAHs with 4-, 5- or 6-rings in this analysis as a metric representing 
the less volatile, particle-bound PAHs. This selected group of PAHs (PAH456) had a good 
correlation with the continuous measure of PAHs we were using in the spatial-temporal 
model. Outdoor, residential 24-hour PAH456 concentrations were used as the dependent 
variable in a mixed-effects regression model with a large number of independent land use 
and meteorological variables. Good agreement between predicted and measured 
concentrations of PAH456 was reported with the final model. The model parameters were 
used to calculate individual daily exposure to outdoor residential PAH456. More information 
on the model selection/parameters and field sampling of PAH456 can be found in Noth et 
al., 2011 (27).
Telomere length measurement
Total genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using 
QIAamp® DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Cat#51104). The telomere length assay was adapted 
from the published original method by Cawthon (34,35). Telomere length was determined 
by relative ratio of telomere gene copy number to single copy gene copy number in each 
sample to reference DNA sample. The telomere thermal cycling profile consisted of:
Cycling for T(telomic) PCR: denature at 96°C for 1 second, anneal/extend at 54°C for 60 
seconds, with fluorescence data collection, 30 cycles. Cycling for S (single copy gene) PCR: 
denature at 95°C for 15 seconds, anneal at 58°C for 1 second, extend at 72°C for 20 seconds, 
8 cycles; followed by denature at 96°C for 1 second, anneal at 58°C for 1 second, extend at 
72°C for 20 seconds, hold at 83°C for 5 seconds with data collection, 35 cycles.
The primers for the telomere PCR were tel1b [5′-CGGTTT(GTTTGG)5GTT-3′], used at a 
final concentration of 100 nM, and tel2b [5′-GGCTTG(CCTTAC)5CCT-3′], used at a final 
concentration of 900 nM. The primers for the single-copy gene (human beta-globin) PCR 
were hbg1 [5′ GCTTCTGACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-3′], used at a final 
concentration of 300 nM, and hbg2 [5′-CACCAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC-3′], used at a 
final concentration of 700 nM. The final reaction mix contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4; 
50 mM KCl; 200 μM each dNTP; 1% DMSO; 0.4× Syber Green I; 22 ng E. coli DNA per 
reaction; 0.4 Units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Inc.) per 11 microliter 
reaction; 0.5 – 10 ng of genomic DNA. Tubes containing 26, 8.75, 2.9, 0.97, 0.324 and 
0.108ng of a reference DNA (from Hela cancer cells) were included in each PCR run so that 
the quantity of targeted templates in each research sample can be determined relative to the 
reference DNA sample by the standard curve method. The same reference DNA was used 
for all PCR runs.
To control for inter-assay variability, eight control DNA samples were included in each run. 
In each batch, the the ratio of telomere to single copy gene (T/S) of each control DNA was 
divided by the average T/S for the same DNA from 10 runs to get a normalizing factor. This 
was done for all eight samples and the average normalizing factor for these samples was 
used to correct the participant DNA samples to get the final T/S ratio. The T/S ratio for each 
sample was measured twice. When the duplicate T/S value and the initial value varied by

 more than 7%, the sample was run a third time and the two closest values were reported. The 
coefficient of variation (CV) for this study was typically 2.5%.
Statistical analysis
Linear regression was used to estimate the association between PAH456 and TL, adjusting 
for age, sex, race/ethnicity (Latino and White) and asthma status. In a sensitivity analysis, 
the oldest subject with the lowest TL was excluded.
Results
Table 1 displays the summary characteristics of study subjects. The mean age, telomere 
length and PAH456 exposure are presented by sex, race/ethnicity and asthma status in Table 
2. On average, TL was shorter in the higher PAH456 group; the difference in relative 
telomere length between the lowest and highest PAH456-exposed individual participants 
was 0.36.
Crude regression models for TL on age (Figure 2) and PAH456 (Figure 3) suggest inverse 
linear relationships for both. In a multivariable regression model, telomere length (TL) 
decreased by −0.14 units (95%CI: −0.25,−0.11) per one ng/m3 increase in PAH456, 
adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity and asthma (Table 3). Altogether the covariates 
explained 83% of the variance in TL. Female participants had slightly longer mean 
telomeres than males (TLfemale=1.25, TLmale=1.21). Asthmatic participants had shorter 
mean telomere length than non-asthmatic participants (TLasthmatic=1.13, 
TLnonasthmatic=1.29). The shortest telomere length (TL= 0.96) was found in the subject with 
the highest PAH456 exposure (4.2 ng/m3). This subject was a 17 year-old Caucasian male 
asthmatic participant and his TL was between 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean. 
After excluding this participant in sensitivity analysis, the association with PAH456 
remained significant and the model R2 decreased to 72%.
Asthmatic participants were exposed to higher levels of PAH456 than non-asthmatic 
participants (Figure 4). There were more male asthmatic participants in our sample than 
females and male participants were exposed to a wider range of PAH456 levels (Figure 5).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationships between 
traffic-related air pollution, specifically ambient PAHs, and telomere length in children in 
the United States. We found that telomere length decreased with increasing PAH exposure 
among the small group of participants in this pilot study, consistent with the hypothesis that 
PAH exposure may cause oxidative stress that can accelerate telomere shortening. The fit of 
a linear model for TL and exposure to ambient PAH456 improved when adjusted for age, 
sex, race/ethnicity and asthma status. Therefore, our results also suggest that age, sex, and 
asthma status may influence the length of telomeres in children.

 Air Pollution and Telomere Length
The relationship between PAH exposure and telomere length we observed in this study of 
adolescents is consistent with studies in healthy adults that have shown telomere shortening 
with increasing air pollution levels (13,14,36–38). For example, Hoxha et al. reported mean 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL) among traffic officers in Milan, Italy was 1.10 (95% CI: 
1.04–1.16) compared to a mean LTL in office workers of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.20–1.35) (14). In 
our younger participants, the mean telomere length of the subjects with the lowest PAH 
exposure was 1.38, whereas the telomere length of the participant with the highest PAH 
exposure was 0.96.
Previous studies have reported a dose-response relationship between PAH exposure and 
biomarkers of oxidative stress (39,40). Although preliminary pilot data, our results are 
consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to ambient PAHs (largely generated during 
combustion of diesel and gasoline fuels in Fresno) leads to oxidative stress, which in turn 
causes telomere shortening.
Age and Telomere Length
Multiple studies have reported a trend of decreasing telomere length with increasing age 
(36–38). Most cells, with the exception of some germline and stem cells, lose their 
telomerase activity once they are differentiated into specific tissue or blood cells (36). In 
addition, there is less production of stem cells and other renewing cells with increasing age 
(41). In our participants, we found a weak inverse relationship between age and telomere 
length which could be due to the narrow age range of the subjects, or different telomere 
regulation in children and adolescents than that in newborns or adults. Previous studies have 
shown different telomere lengths and rates of telomere sequence loss with different age 
groups(19,36,37). Newborns had the most rapid loss of telomeres. The changes in telomere 
length in later life are rather gradual with advancing age. The longer telomere lengths in 
newborns reflect a large proportion of immature hematopoietic progenitors that have not 
gone through extensive proliferation relative to adults (36,41).
Sex and Telomere Length
Female participants had slightly longer telomeres than male participants, consistent with 
other studies (42,43). In a meta-analysis of telomere length by sex from 36 cohorts 
(n=36,230), females had longer telomeres than males. Several theories have been proposed 
to explain telomere length difference by sex. One is related to an estrogen-responsive 
element that can stimulate telomerase, an enzyme that synthesizes telomere sequences and 
adds them to the end of chromosomes (43). Another theory is that the properties of estrogen 
can counteract oxidative stress by up-regulating antioxidant enzyme expression (44). 
Another alternative explanation for the sex difference between females and males in this 
pilot study may be that there were more male than female participants with asthma.
Asthma and Telomere Length
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease in the airways characterized by recurring 
exacerbations (45). Frequent inflammatory responses and rapid cell proliferation can lead to 
telomere shortening (46,47). Exposure to high levels of air pollution can trigger

 exacerbations of asthma that could lead to telomere shortening (48–50). Although the annual 
average concentration of ambient PAHs was higher among the asthmatic compared to the 
non-asthmatic participants, it is not possible in this pilot study to make inferences about 
whether the shorter telomeres in asthmatic children were due to their condition or due to 
exposure to high levels of PAH, or both.
Strengths and Limitations
Previous studies have reported shorter telomere length in children in relation to community 
stress, poverty, and social deprivation (51), but as noted above, ours is the first to address air 
pollution. Additional strengths of our study include a novel marker of traffic-related air 
pollution, PAHs, and a novel biomarker of air pollution-related cytotoxicity, telomere length. 
Another is our focus on children for whom relatively scant data are available on the 
association between air pollution and telomere length.
There are several limitations of this pilot study. The primary limitation is the small sample 
size. Another major limitation is that the cross-sectional design limits the ability to make 
temporal inferences about whether telomere length shortening occurred after exposure to air 
pollution.
Conclusions
Our pilot study results suggest that telomere shortening in children may be associated with 
exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Greater knowledge of the impact of air pollution at 
the molecular level is necessary to design effective interventions and policies. Our 
preliminary data will inform the design of a larger study to examine the hypothesis 
generated from these results.
