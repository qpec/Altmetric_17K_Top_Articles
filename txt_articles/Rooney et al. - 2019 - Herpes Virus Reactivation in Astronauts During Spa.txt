Latent herpes virus reactivation has been demonstrated in astronauts during shuttle
(10–16 days) and International Space Station (≥180 days) flights. Following reactivation,
viruses are shed in the body fluids of astronauts. Typically, shedding of viral DNA
is asymptomatic in astronauts regardless of mission duration; however, in some
cases, live/infectious virus was recovered by tissue culture that was associated
with atopic-dermatitis or skin lesions during and after spaceflight. Hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes activation during
spaceflight occurs as indicated by increased levels of stress hormones including cortisol,
dehydroepiandrosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These changes, along with
a decreased cell mediated immunity, contribute to the reactivation of latent herpes
viruses in astronauts. Currently, 47/89 (53%) astronauts from shuttle-flights and 14/23
(61%) astronauts from ISS missions shed one or more herpes viruses in saliva/urine
samples. Astronauts shed Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and
herpes-simplex-1 (HSV-1) in saliva and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine. Larger quantities
and increased frequencies for these viruses were found during spaceflight as compared
to before or after flight samples and their matched healthy controls. The shedding did not
abate during the longer ISS missions, but rather increased in frequency and amplitude.
These findings coincided with the immune system dysregulation observed in astronauts
from shuttle and ISS missions. VZV shedding increased from 41% in space shuttle to
65% in ISS missions, EBV increased 82 to 96%, and CMV increased 47 to 61%. In
addition, VZV/CMV shed ≤30 days after ISS in contrast to shuttle where VZV/CMV
shed up to 5 and 3 days after flight respectively. Continued shedding of infectious-virus
post-flight may pose a potential risk for crew who may encounter newborn infants, sero-
negative adults or any immunocompromised individuals on Earth. Therefore, developing
spaceflight countermeasures to prevent viral reactivation is essential. Our spaceflight-
developed technologies for saliva collection/rapid viral detection have been extended
to include clinical applications including zoster patients, chicken pox, post-herpetic
neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and various neurological disorders. These protocols are
employed in various clinics and hospitals including the CDC and Columbia University in
New York, as well as overseas in Switzerland and Israel.

Herpes Virus Reactivation in Astronauts During Spaceflight
INTRODUCTION
Herpes Virus
Herpes viruses have co-evolved with humans for millennia and
subsequently employ sophisticated strategies to evade the host
immune response. Consequently, after primary infection, they
persist lifelong in a latent or dormant phase, and are generally
asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, they
may reactivate during periods of increased stress, isolation, and
during times of immune challenge. Eight major herpes viruses
parasitize humans with worldwide infection rates of 70–
95%.
Four of the eight are shed in the body fluids of NASA astronauts
during both short and long duration spaceflight. Though viral
load (virus detected in the body fluids) can be high, these
astronauts often have no clinical symptoms associated with
reactivation (Mehta et al., 2004). Post-reactivation, replication
of the virus may also be enhanced which could account for
the significant increase in viral shedding during spaceflight. Yet,
there have been a few cases where the reactivation culminated
in commensurate atopic dermatitis and/or viral lesions (Crucian
B. E. et al., 2016).
Astronaut Stress/Exposures
Exposure of astronauts, during both short and long duration
spaceflight,
to
non-terrestrial
hazards
such
as
variable
gravitational forces including acceleration/deceleration, cosmic
radiation, and microgravity result in a unique set of stressors that
contribute to the dysregulation of the immune and endocrine
systems (Crucian and Sams, 2009; Crucian et al., 2013). In
addition, they also endure some common stressors including but
not limited to social separation, confinement, sleep deprivation,
circadian rhythm disruption, and anxiety. There is increasing
evidence to suggest that these spaceflight-associated stressors
chronically amplify the release of stress hormones, which
negatively affects the immune system, especially the adaptive
immune system facilitating latent herpes virus reactivation
during and after spaceflight. Increased levels of salivary, plasma
and urinary stress hormones such as cortisol and catecholamines
commonly accompany spaceflight (Stowe et al., 2001a).
Altered Immunity
Maintenance of viral latency requires a vigorous and vigilant
immune system, highly dependent upon competent cytotoxic
T-cells, and any changes in immune status tend to promote
viral reactivation. This is evident in both terrestrial space-analog
studies (Crucian B. et al., 2014) and spaceflight studies (Stowe
et al., 2001b, 2011; Mehta et al., 2014, 2017). The alterations in
immunestatusforterrestrialanalogstudiesareminorandcoincide
with mild viral reactivation. Spaceflight studies illustrate major
immune dysregulation and functional changes in conjunction
with significant viral reactivation, regardless of mission duration.
In fact, substantial changes in cell-mediated immunity exist in
most astronauts that reactivated one or more herpes viruses
(Mehta et al., 2014; Crucian et al., 2015). This was also highlighted
by Glaser et al. (1993), who previously showed an association of
EBV reactivation and diminished cell-mediated immunity.
The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis along with
the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis partially mediate
the stress response where glucocorticoids and catecholamines are
secreted in proportionate concentrations relative to the stress
stimulus (Figure 1) (Padgett and Glaser, 2003; Webster and
Glaser, 2008; Goldstein, 2010). Though acute responses to stress
can be positive, long duration or chronically high levels of stress
hormones can negatively affect the regulation of the immune
system and its individual components (Crucian B. E. et al., 2014).
Changes in a variety of immune cells, both in form (phenotype)
and function (killing capacity), result in decreased cell-mediated
immunity, which facilitates opportunistic reactivation of latent
viruses (Crucian et al., 2015; Bigley et al., 2017).
Stress Hormones/Cytokines
Cortisol
and
dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA)
are
glucocorticoid
steroid
hormones
released
by
the
adrenal
glands in response to stress. Cortisol is anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive, but DHEA is an important antagonist to
cortisol. For that reason, the molar ratio of cortisol to DHEA
[C]/[D] is an important indicator of immune regulation. In
recent flight studies, the regular diurnal release of these hormones
was tracked in saliva samples to evaluate any changes/trends
occurring through the various phases of flight; launch/pre-flight,
flight, and return (Mehta et al., 2014). Salivary cortisol was
present in significantly higher concentrations in samples taken
before and during flight. Salivary DHEA followed its normal
daily decline kinetics in the samples taken before, during and
after flight, but has been found to have significantly lower waking
concentrations during the flight phase in comparison to samples
taken before and after flight. Altogether, diurnal patterns of
salivary cortisol were significantly higher during flight while
DHEA was significantly lower. The cortisol area under the curve
relative to ground (AUCg) did not change significantly during
flight relative to baseline whereas DHEA AUCg significantly
declined during flight relative to baseline. Ultimately, this results
in an increased [C]/[D] molar ratio during spaceflight (Figure 2)
which potentially indicates immune challenge, and has been
linked to immune modulation (Christeff et al., 1997), including
the increased inflammatory cytokine response and the TH2
shift observed in earlier spaceflight studies (Mehta et al., 2013a;
Crucian B. E. et al., 2014).
Cytokines are small cell-signaling proteins that play a crucial
role in the modulation of the human immune response. They
can facilitate both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune states
and are generally analyzed in the categories of inflammatory
cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8), lymphoid growth
factors (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15), Th1/17 cytokines (IFNγ, IL-12, IL-17),
Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13), myeloid growth factors
(G-CSF, GM-CSF), and chemokines (eotaxin, MCP-1, M1P1α,
IP-10). Recent flight studies (Mehta et al., 2013a; Crucian B. E.
et al., 2014; Crucian et al., 2015) have shown that astronauts
displayed significant increases in the pro-inflammatory plasma
cytokines IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IFNγ, IL-4, eotaxin, and IP-10 in
samples taken 10 days before launch (L-10), in comparison to
their baseline samples taken 180 days before launch (L-180). The
increase of IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, eotaxin, and IP-10 is also evident

FIGURE 1 | Spaceflight is a stressful environment with various stressors acting through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and the

immediately upon return to Earth at landing, designated as R+0.
The Th2 cytokine IL-4 was the most sensitive/responsive to the
phases of flight with 35- and 21-fold increases from baseline
values at L-10 and R+0, respectively.
When analyzing plasma cytokine levels in the context of virus
shedding, there seems to be a connection between astronauts
who shed virus and significantly elevated levels of cytokines (IL-
1α, IL-6, IL-8, IFNγ, IL-12p70, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, eotaxin, and
IP-10) (Mehta et al., 2013a). Lymphoid and myeloid growth
factors are also elevated in virus shedding astronauts, by about
twofold. As mentioned earlier, the Th2 cytokine IL-4 shows the
largest fold increases through launch and return flight phases,
and this is evident again when restricting the analysis to only
viral-shedding astronauts at the return time point R+0. For
these astronauts, the single largest plasma cytokine increases
were IL-4 (21-fold increase) and IL- 6 (33-fold increase). This
indicates a dynamic shift from a Th1 antiviral immune state to a
Th2 antibacterial/antifungal immune state. Further emphasizing
the Th1-Th2 shift is an analysis of the ratio of IFNγ: IL-4.
The results from some of the most recent flight studies suggest

FIGURE 2 | Cortisol and DHEA were analyzed in saliva from astronauts before, during and after the space flights using a commercially available ELISA assays
(Salimetrics, LLC, State College, PA, United States). There was a significant increase in the molar ratio of cortisol to DHEA during the flight phase for both Space
Shuttle (N = 17) or ISS (N = 10). The increase in this ratio may be associated with lower cellular immunity and innate immunity; potentially contributing to greater
inflammatory cytokines that may affect bone remodeling and bone growth. ∗ Indicates significance when comparing flight against pre-flight and post-flight. p < 0.01.
a significant decrease in the IFNγ: IL-4 ratio for shedders
compared to astronauts who did not shed any viruses during
their duty rotation (Mehta et al., 2013a; Crucian B. E. et al.,
2014).
Viral Specific T-Cell and NK-Cell Function
Alterations in the aforementioned cytokines play a critical
role in the fate of many important leukocyte populations.
The cytokine profile changes, acting either independently
or in conjunction with microgravity, generate a variety of
immune vulnerabilities by significantly changing the numbers,
proportions, and functions of leukocytes. Monocyte (Kaur et al.,
2005), granulocyte (Stowe et al., 1999), and lymphocyte functions
(Crucian et al., 2015; Bigley et al., 2017) are diminished,
critically reducing the effectiveness of the immune response to
pathogens, as well as its capacity to prevent viral reactivation.
T-Cells and NK-Cells in particular, which function to attack and
destroy viruses/virally infected cells, are substantially debilitated
during spaceflight. Flight studies focusing on T-Cell function
have elucidated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-Cells taken
from astronauts during the flight phase respond ineffectively
against a variety of stimuli. Under normal circumstances, these
same stimuli would have elicited a more profound response
by the T-Cells. The weakened response can last the duration
of the flight phase (Crucian et al., 2015). Additional flight
studies focusing on the function of NK-Cells have shown
decrements in cytotoxicity due to decreased production of
the enzymes perforin and granzyme B (Bigley et al., 2017).
Without these enzymes, NK-Cells are rendered ineffective
against the target cell/pathogen and this impairment may
last up to 60 days post-flight. In both cases, reductions in
T-Cell and NK-Cell function lead to the inability of the
immune system to suppress/sequester/eliminate opportunistic
viral reactivation.
Viral Latency
As stated earlier, herpes viruses share a long-term co-evolutionary
history with humankind. This promotes a relatively benign life-
long persistence of the virus within the host. In healthy
individuals with robust immune surveillance, viral activity
can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms (Grinde,
2013). Injury to the host is antithetical to viral survival. Viral
persistence in the host is aided by viral strategies for latency.
Latency is a well-orchestrated series of concomitant events that
allow for viral genome maintenance, while actively repressing

gene expression. A hallmark of viral latency is that infectious
viral progeny are not produced, so the surrounding cells remain
uninfected or naïve. Viral latency is the culmination of a handful
of factors; infection of cell types permissive to latency, viral
promotion of infected cell survival, and the general evasion
of the host immune response. Cellular tropism is dictated
by cell surface receptor expression, as well as intracellular
conditions permissive to viral activity, and is very specific to
the individual herpes viruses. HSV and VZV infect neurons
in ganglia, while EBV and CMV preferentially infect the cells
of the immune system, B cells and myeloid progenitor cells,
respectively. Other cell types can be infected by the viruses, but
the aforementioned cell types serve as the greater viral latent
reservoirs. The promotion of infected cell survival is the product
of viral manipulation of host cell machinery. For example, the
manipulation of Bcl-2 family proteins promotes survival of CMV
infected monocytes (Collins-McMillen et al., 2015). Not only
can herpes viruses manipulate the cells they infect, but they
can also affect the host immune response. Interestingly, latent
viruses are still very genetically active even in the absence of
replication. There is emerging evidence of significant miRNA
activity during latency that can act to override lytic transcription,
as well as to alter the cell secretome. Though the role of
miRNA are yet to be fully teased out, they seem to facilitate
the transcription of proteins that mimic host cytokines and
chemokines which ultimately inhibit host anti-viral activity. For
the many nuances of viral latency, specific to each virus, the
reader is directed to the following review articles (Eshleman et al.,
2011; Nicoll et al., 2012; Kempkes and Robertson, 2015; Wills
et al., 2015).
Viral Reactivation
Reactivation and shedding of latent herpes viruses has been
reported in astronauts during space shuttle, Russian Soyuz and
International Space Station missions (Pierson et al., 2005, 2007;
Mehta and Pierson, 2007; Mehta et al., 2014, 2017). Virus
reactivation has also been observed in ground-based models
of spaceflight including Antarctica, undersea habitat, artificial
gravity and bed rest studies, though not to the extent seen during
spaceflight studies. So far, 47 out of 89 (53%) astronauts from
short duration space shuttle flights, and 14 out of 23 (61%)
from long duration ISS spaceflight missions shed at least one or
more herpes viruses in their saliva or urine samples. Significant
reactivations of EBV, CMV, and VZV occurred during flight
phase and the magnitude and frequency of viral shedding during
spaceflight directly correlates with duration of spaceflight. VZV
shedding increased from 41% in space shuttle to 65% in ISS
missions, EBV increased from 82 to 96%, and CMV increased
from 47 to 61%. In addition, VZV and CMV shed up to a month
post-long duration flight. Percent distribution of these viruses
during shuttle and ISS missions is depicted in Figure 3. These
viruses often reactivate in concert with one another, but they may
also reactivate independently of the other viruses. Reactivation
of latent viruses during long-duration spaceflight could increase
risk for adverse medical events during exploration-class deep-
space missions (Crucian and Sams, 2009). Taken altogether, and
to our knowledge, there have been six incidences of astronauts
with complaints of symptoms related to herpes viral reactivation
(Crucian B. et al., 2016). VZV is an important health risk to
crewmembers (several have experienced shingles during flight).
Furthermore, CMV can be immuno-suppressive and may play

after either short and long duration space flights. Saliva and urine samples were collected from 112 astronauts (89 short duration and 23 long duration) before,
during, and after the spaceflight. Saliva was analyzed for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and urine was analyzed for Cytomegalovirus CMV
by real time PCR assay using Taqman 7900 (Thermofisher, Inc.). The shedding of EBV. VZV and CMV DNA in body fluids is significantly higher during spaceflight as
compared to pre-flight, post-flight, and the control p < 0.01 (Mehta et al., 2014, 2017). However, when comparing these shedding patterns between space shuttle
and ISS missions, the differences were not significant.

a role in the well-documented immune dysfunction observed in
crewmembers.
Epstein–Barr Virus
Epstein–
Barr
virus
(EBV)
is
responsible
for
infectious
mononucleosis and is associated with several malignancies
(Niedobitek et al., 2001; Thompson and Kurzrock, 2004;
Bravender, 2010). It is a highly infectious DNA virus transmitted
by aerosolized micro-droplets and by direct contact with saliva.
It has a 95% infection rate among adults worldwide, which makes
it an ideal target for investigation among a limited and unique
astronaut population. EBV preferentially infects B-lymphocytes
and these cells serve as a latent virus reservoir. Early flight studies
from the shuttle missions were the first to demonstrate that EBV
DNA was shed in astronaut saliva samples taken before, during,
and after space flight (Stowe et al., 2001b; Pierson et al., 2005;
Mehta et al., 2014). These studies highlighted a 10-fold increase
in viral load during the flight phase in comparison to samples
taken before or after flight. Additionally, EBV copies shed during
space flight seemed to increase as a function of time in space,
and as a result of diminished cell immunity (Mehta et al., 2000a).
These early findings have been repeatedly corroborated in longer
duration ISS missions (Stowe et al., 2011; Mehta et al., 2017).
Altogether, flight studies have illustrated that approximately 90%
of astronauts, regardless of mission duration, shed EBV during
spaceflight.
Varicella Zoster Virus
Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) is highly communicable and
responsible for both chicken pox (primary infection) and shingles
(secondary infection). The virus is transmitted via saliva and can
be aerosolized by sneezing and coughing. After primary infection,
FIGURE 4 | Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) copy number per mL of saliva in
Fifty-four zoster patients treated with valacyclovir and 14 healthy subjects. On
treatment days 1, 7-, and 14 later, pain was scored (data not given here) and
saliva examined for VZV-DNA by real time PCR. Patients were divided into two
groups based upon the infected dermatome, Trigeminal Cervical and
Thoracic/Lumbar. VZV-DNA was found in every patient the day treatment was
started and disappeared in 82% with the treatment. Analysis of human saliva
has potential usefulness in diagnosing neurological disease produced by VZV
without rash. When comparing patient shedding against normal healthy
controls, it was significantly higher, p < 0.01 (Mehta et al., 2008).
VZV becomes latent in various nerve ganglia (Reichelt et al.,
2008) (cranial, dorsal root, autonomic) along the entire length
of the neuroaxis, and reactivation often results in characteristic
skin lesions that range from aggravating to painful. Though
reactivation of VZV is evident from flight studies where viral
DNA was found in saliva of astronauts from both shuttle and
ISS missions, astronauts do not often develop symptoms or
rash (Mehta et al., 2004; Cohrs et al., 2008). Additionally,
we have found that saliva samples taken 2–
6 days following
landing were infectious by culturing that saliva with human fetal
lung (HFL) cells. Infectious VZV was present and confirmed
by visual inspection of the culture where viral plaques were
obvious, as well as by antibody staining and real-time PCR DNA
analysis. This poses a risk to the welfare of both astronauts
and their seronegative contacts back on Earth, as VZV viral
load also increases with time in space and is present in saliva
of about 60% of astronauts from combined shuttle and ISS
missions.
Herpes Simplex Virus-1
Herpes Simplex virus-1 is highly prevalent and communicable
and persists as a latent virus lifelong. Generally referred to as
oral herpes, reactivation can be either asymptomatic or lead
to lesions/rash anywhere on the body. Incidences of HSV-
1 reactivation are very low with only 8% of astronaut saliva
samples test positive for viral DNA, though recently, an astronaut
suffering persistent dermatitis during a long duration spaceflight,
>180 day, was positive for HSV-1 viral DNA in saliva and lesion
samples. The saliva containing virus was infectious, as evidenced
by a culture of the saliva atop HFL cells, where visual disruption
of HFL cells was apparent at 3 days post-infection with saliva,
with viral load verified/quantified by real-time PCR.
Cytomegalovirus
Cytomegalovirus is the only beta-herpes virus known to
reactivate in astronauts. It is typically acquired asymptomatically
during childhood and has a worldwide prevalence of 75–
90%. Though it remains asymptomatic in immunocompetent
people, it may reactivate in individuals whose immune systems
are either immature or immunocompromised causing multiple
diseases such as encephalitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and
chorioretinitis (Seitz, 2010). Moreover, several studies have
suggested that CMV infection is immunosuppressive because
it directly infects leukocytes as well as hematopoietic cells
(Varani and Landini, 2011; O’
Connor and Murphy, 2012;
Stevenson et al., 2014). Additionally, CMV has been uniquely
linked to early immune senescence (Pawelec, 2014; Sansoni
et al., 2014). However, a study was able to illustrate a
benefit of CMV infection specifically to young adults (20–
30 years old) regarding increased antibody response to the
influenza vaccine (Furman et al., 2015). Spaceflight studies
have shown that 27% of the astronauts from short-term
space missions shed CMV DNA in either pre- or post-
flight urine samples, and that anti-CMV IgG antibody titers
increased significantly for all shedders from each time point
compared to their baseline values (Mehta et al., 2000b).
In long duration spaceflight, 61% of astronauts shed CMV

Herpes Virus Reactivation in Astronauts During Spaceflight
DNA in their urine during and after spaceflight in stark
contrast to the absence of CMV DNA in urine samples
taken 180 days before flight. These findings demonstrate that
CMV reactivation occurs in astronauts regardless of mission
duration, and this may pose additional threats to the health
of crewmembers during longer-duration missions (Mehta et al.,
2014, 2017).
Rapid Detection of Virus for Application
in Patient Populations
The most obvious signs of VZV reactivation are the vesicular
rash and the pain associated with zoster, however even in
the absence of rash, the virus is active and can spread
to the retina causing blindness, to the spinal cord causing
paralysis and incontinence, and to cerebral arteries resulting
in stroke (Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Gilden, 2001; Orme
et al., 2007). Associating VZV with a disease asymptomatically
can be challenging. For example, when stroke occurs in the
elderly, especially many months following zoster, the association
with VZV reactivation requires cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
analysis for VZV antibodies (Nagel et al., 2007). Likewise,
detection of asymptomatic VZV reactivation, which often is
only seen as an increase in antibody titer against VZV (but
may also result in virus transmission), is difficult to detect.
In such instances, virological verification of VZV disease
has relied on the detection of VZV DNA or anti-VZV IgG
antibodies in CSF or, less often, the presence of VZV DNA
in blood mononuclear cells or anti-VZV IgM antibodies in
serum.
However, VZV DNA has been detected in the saliva samples
from patients with acute zoster (Mehta et al., 2008), zoster sine
herpete (Hato et al., 2000), chickenpox (Mehta et al., 2013b)
and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) (Nagel et al., 2011) even
before the rash appears, which now makes diagnosis less invasive
and less time consuming. In fact, a rapid and sensitive virus
detection method has been developed and used to detect virus in
saliva samples taken from asymptomatic patients with neurologic
and other VZV related disease (Mehta et al., 2013b). Figure 4
illustrates VZV copy numbers in saliva from shingles patients
before anti-viral treatment. For this method, the saliva is collected
by passive drool or by way of a synthetic swab and then processed
for DNA within an hour from sample collection. The results from
a few studies using this technique have shown that VZV DNA is
present in 100% of patients tested before antiviral treatment and
is exclusively in the cell pelleted fraction of saliva. These studies
further showed that VZV, isolated from zoster patient saliva,
was primarily associated with the epithelial cell membrane but
could also be inside the cell. Epithelial cells with VZV continued
to be present in the saliva of a single zoster patient up to
10 months after recovery. These kinds of studies are ongoing and
our spaceflight-developed technology for rapid viral detection
continues to be used locally and around the world for patients
with zoster (Mehta et al., 2013b), chicken pox (Mehta et al., 2008),
PHN (Nagel et al., 2011), multiple sclerosis (Ricklin et al., 2013),
and various other neurological disorders (Gilden et al., 2010;
Pollak et al., 2015).
CONCLUSION
Reactivation of latent viruses is a powerful biomarker of
immune status for astronauts deployed to space. There are
multiple factors that influence reactivation including increases
in glucocorticoid/catecholamine secretion, cytokine profile shifts,
and decreased function in the major leukocyte and lymphocyte
subsets designed to suppress and eliminate viruses/virally
infected cells. Viral reactivation is evident through the shedding
of viral DNA in the body fluids of astronauts, and the viral
load only increases with more time in space. Additionally,
more than one virus generally reactivates at a time, potentially
compounding the physiological ramifications of uncontrolled
viral reactivation to not only rashes, but also severe target
organ failures, and permanent vision and hearing loss. The
occupational hazards for astronauts are profound, but research
into the causes and mechanics of viral reactivation not only
benefit the astronaut but also the general patient population.
As our understanding of viral reactivation widens, we are better
able to develop and implement effective countermeasures for our
astronaut professionals, as well as targeted treatment regimens
for immunocompromised individuals suffering the consequences
of viral reactivation. As a result, this research has tremendous
clinical relevance.
Ultimately,
the
information
gleaned
from
these
space
studies will shape the way we prepare for and design
exploration-class
missions,
beyond
the
moon
and
mars,
where reactivation of latent viruses could result in increased
risk for wide-ranging adverse medical events. Partial-gravity
environments, e.g., on Mars, might be sufficient to curtail
serious viral reactivation, but this needs to be addressed
in future research. In the interim, because astronaut saliva
contains increasingly significant viral DNA, during and after
spaceflight that can be infectious, we recommend prophylactics
(vaccines), where available, to the astronauts before they go into
space.
