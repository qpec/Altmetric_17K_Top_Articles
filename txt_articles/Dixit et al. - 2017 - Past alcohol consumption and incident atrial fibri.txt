Abstract
Background
Although current alcohol consumption is a risk factor for incident atrial fibrillation (AF), the
more clinically relevant question may be whether alcohol cessation is associated with a
reduced risk.
Methods and results
We studied participants enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC)
between 1987 and 1989 without prevalent AF. Past and current alcohol consumption were
ascertained at baseline and at 3 subsequent visits. Incident AF was ascertained via study
ECGs, hospital discharge ICD-9 codes, and death certificates. Of 15,222 participants, 2,886
(19.0%) were former drinkers. During a median follow-up of 19.7 years, there were 1,631
cases of incident AF, 370 occurring in former consumers. Former drinkers had a higher rate
of AF compared to lifetime abstainers and current drinkers. After adjustment for potential
confounders, every decade abstinent from alcohol was associated with an approximate
20% (95% CI 11–28%) lower rate of incident AF; every additional decade of past alcohol
consumption was associated with a 13% (95% CI 3–25%) higher rate of AF; and every addi-
tional drink per day during former drinking was associated with a 4% (95% CI 0–8%) higher
rate of AF.
Conclusions
Among former drinkers, the number of years of drinking and the amount of alcohol con-
sumed may each confer an increased risk of AF. Given that a longer duration of abstinence
was associated with a decreased risk of AF, earlier modification of alcohol use may have a
greater influence on AF prevention.

 Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of Americans and is growing in incidence and preva-
lence [1]. It is one of the most common causes of stroke and nearly doubles mortality [2, 3].
While many efforts have concentrated on the treatment of this important disease, primary pre-
vention has rarely been a focus [4].
Several studies have found an association between heavy alcohol consumption, usually
defined as greater than 3 drinks per day, and incident AF [5–7]. Though the data on moderate
alcohol consumption is less conclusive, a meta-analysis of fourteen studies determined that
there is a linear relationship between alcohol consumption and AF, reporting an 8% increase
in risk associated with each 10 grams per day of alcohol intake [8]. A study from our group
demonstrated that even greater access to alcohol is associated with a higher prevalence and
incidence of AF [9]. In addition, we recently identified alcohol consumption as a predictor of
left atrial enlargement and subsequent incident AF, elucidating a possible mechanism for this
relationship [10]. Thus, eliminating alcohol intake could be a potentially effective strategy for
preventing AF. As of now, it remains unknown whether once an individual has consumed
alcohol, the “genie is out of the bottle” or whether cessation may still influence AF risk.
Methods
Study population
The ARIC study is a population-based prospective cohort designed to identify risk factors for
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Between 1987 and 1989, 15,792 adults aged 45 to 64
were recruited from 4 U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis sub-
urbs, MN; and Washington County, MD [11]. After a comprehensive baseline assessment, par-
ticipants underwent four follow-up visits in 1990–92, 1993–95, 1996–98, and 2011–13 and were
contacted yearly by phone to obtain information about hospital admissions and to ascertain
vital status. For this analysis, we first excluded individuals with missing alcohol information
(n = 324), then those without an ECG examination (n = 214), and then those with prevalent AF
(n = 32), for a total of 15,222 participants. Prevalent AF was defined as AF present at baseline
examination; these participants were excluded in order to examine specifically new-onset AF.
The ARIC study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Minne-
sota, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of North Carolina, Univer-
sity of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston, and the University of Mississippi Medical
Center. All participants provided written informed consent. For this particular analysis, a certif-
icate of approval to conduct research on this de-identified dataset was obtained from the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research.
AF ascertainment
Prevalent AF was identified by baseline ECG. Incident AF diagnoses were obtained from sub-
sequent study visit ECGs, hospital discharge records, and death certificates [12]. Study partici-
pants underwent standard supine 12-lead resting ECG recordings at baseline and at each
follow-up exam. All ECG recordings were done with MAC PC Personal Cardiographs (Mar-
quette Electronics, Inc., Milwaukee, WI). ECGs were transmitted by telephone to the ARIC
Central ECG Reading Center for coding, interpretation and storage. All ECG recordings auto-
matically coded as AF were visually re-checked by a trained cardiologist to confirm the diagno-
sis [13].

 Annual follow-up phone calls to the study participants were used to identify hospitaliza-
tions and deaths, and discharge lists from local hospitals were reviewed for any cardiovascular
events. Using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification
(ICD-9- CM) codes, AF was considered present if 427.31 or 427.32 were present in a hospitali-
zation, so long as they were not accompanied by a procedure code for open cardiac surgery.
The diagnosis of AF based on hospital discharge records has been previously validated in
ARIC [12]. Finally, AF was considered present if the death certificate included ICD-9 code
427.3 or ICD-10 code I48.
Alcohol assessment
Self-reported alcohol consumption was ascertained at baseline and each subsequent visit
through an interviewer-administered dietary questionnaire. Participants were asked whether
they currently consumed alcoholic beverages, and, if not, whether they had in the past. Follow-
up questions for those citing past drinking included 1) number of years since the participant
stopped drinking, 2) number of years the participant drank for, 3) types of alcoholic beverages
consumed in the past, and 4) usual number of drinks per week before stopping. The amount
of alcohol consumed currently and in the past in grams per week was then calculated assuming
the following alcohol content: 4 oz of wine, 10.8 g; 12 oz of beer, 13.2 g; and 1.5 oz of hard
liquor, 15.1 g [14, 15].
Additional covariate ascertainment
At baseline, sex, race, education level, and smoking history were obtained from self-report.
Level of education was divided into 3 categories: some high school or less, high school gradu-
ate/vocational school, some college/graduate school based on previous ARIC study analyses
[14, 16]. Smoking status was classified as current, former, or never smoker, and cigarette years
of smoking were calculated from the average number of cigarettes smoked per day times the
number of years smoked for both current and former smokers. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2)
was calculated from baseline height and weight measurements. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was
defined as a fasting glucose �126 mg/dL (or non-fasting glucose of �200 mg/dL), a self-
reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, or current use of diabetes medication. Hypertension
(HTN) was defined as a blood pressure measurement of �140 mmHg systolic and/or �90
mmHg diastolic, or current use of antihypertensive medication. Prevalent coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) was defined as a self-reported history of myocardial infarction (MI), coronary
bypass or angioplasty, or MI indicated on baseline ECG. Prevalent heart failure (HF) was iden-
tified by the Gothenburg criteria or by current use of HF medication [17].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables with normal distribution are presented as means ± standard deviation
(SD) and were compared using analysis of variance. Non-normally distributed continuous var-
iables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and were compared using the
Kruskal–Wallis test. The association between categorical variables was determined using the
chi-square test.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the associations between drinker
status and past drinking characteristics and incident AF both before and after controlling for
potential confounders. Checks for log-linearity of the alcohol consumption variables used as
predictors were performed. Covariates were selected based on biological plausibility and past
literature indicating associations with alcohol use and/or incident AF. We included study site,
age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, cigarette years, HTN, DM, CAD, and HF as potential

 confounders. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Kaplan–Meier versus
predicted survival plots and log-minus-log survival plots.
Analyses of longitudinal alcohol consumption and incident AF were performed using alco-
hol intake as a time dependent covariate. Alcohol intake in grams per day was available for vis-
its 1, 2, 3, and 5 and was modeled as linear between visits and stable subsequent to visit 5.
From these models, we derived two different predictor variables: average daily intake from
baseline to present (in grams per day) and cumulative alcohol exposure (estimated kilograms
consumed over follow-up). Cox proportional hazard models were then used to investigate the
associations between these predictors and incident AF both in unadjusted and adjusted models
as described above.
Data were analyzed using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A two-tailed
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. A certificate of approval to conduct research on
this de-identified dataset was obtained from the University of California, San Francisco Com-
mittee on Human Research.
Results
After exclusion of those with prevalent AF (n = 32), there were 15,222 participants included in
our analysis. At baseline, 3,790 (25%) reported being never drinkers, 8,546 (56%) current drink-
ers, and 2,886 (19%) former drinkers. Former consumers were more likely than current drink-
ers to be older, black, have a lower level of education, be former smokers, have smoked for
longer, have drunk more alcohol per week (when drinking), have a larger BMI, and were more
likely to have DM, HTN, CAD, and HF (Table 1). In comparing former drinkers to never drink-
ers, former consumers were more likely to be male, white, have a lower level of education, be
current or former smokers, have smoked for longer, and have DM, CAD, and HF (Table 1).
During a median follow-up of 19.7 years, there were 1,631 cases of incident AF, 370 occur-
ring in former consumers. Past drinkers had an increased risk of developing AF (Fig 1). Focus-
ing on past alcohol consumers (n = 2,886), those who did not develop AF quit longer ago,
drank for a shorter period of time, and consumed less alcohol in the past (Fig 2). After adjust-
ing for study site, age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, cigarette years, HTN, DM, CAD, and
HF, every decade abstinent from alcohol was associated with an approximate 20% lower rate
of incident AF; every additional decade alcohol was consumed in the past was associated with
a 13% higher rate of AF; and every additional drink per day during former drinking was asso-
ciated with a 4% higher rate of AF (Table 2).
In unadjusted analyses, former consumers had an increased risk of developing AF compared
to never drinkers (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.26–1.68, p <0.001), but, after adjusting for study site, age,
sex, race, smoking status, years of smoking, BMI, HTN, DM, CAD, and HF, this relationship lost
statistical significance (Fig 3). Former drinkers remained at higher risk of AF when compared to
current drinkers (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00–1.30, p 0.049 after adjustment). Further analyses stratify-
ing current drinkers by number of drinks per week did not significantly affect our results.
Supplemental analyses examining alcohol type (beer, wine, liquor) consumed in the past or
present demonstrated no associations with incident AF after multivariable adjustment. Esti-
mated cumulative alcohol consumption (in kilograms of alcohol) over study follow-up was not
associated with an increased risk of AF either before (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.00, p 0.081) or
after adjustment (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.00, p 0.724).
Discussion
In this community-based, prospective study of past alcohol consumption and incident AF, a
longer duration of alcohol abstinence among former drinkers was associated with a lower risk

 of developing AF, whereas previously consuming alcohol for a longer duration and consuming
a greater quantity of alcohol were each associated with a higher risk of developing AF.
Episodic heavy alcohol consumption, or binge drinking, has long been posited as a trigger
for AF [18], and in recent years, researchers have begun to investigate the effects of chronic
alcohol consumption on AF risk [8]. Though several studies have found an association
between both heavy [6, 7] and moderate alcohol consumption [8] and incident AF, not all
studies have been positive. Indeed, to our knowledge, the only major US community-based
cohort studies to have reported on the relationship between alcohol and incident AF are: the
Framingham Heart Study, where two examinations found an association [5, 10] and another
did not [19], and the Cardiovascular Health Study [20], which failed to demonstrate a statisti-
cally significant relationship between current alcohol consumption and risk of AF.
This is the first report regarding alcohol and AF from ARIC, where the nature of the ques-
tions enabled a focus on past alcohol consumption. In our study, former drinkers were more
likely to have other cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, such as current or former
smoking, CAD, HF, HTN, and DM. Yet, they actually demonstrated lower rates of AF, includ-
ing when adjusted for these comorbidities. Indeed, previous research has failed to focus on the
potentially clinically relevant issue regarding alcohol cessation and whether or how abstinence
from alcohol might influence AF risk. Our findings indicate that the numbers of years of
drinking and the amount of alcohol consumed may confer an increased risk of AF, even when

 abstinence is later practiced, suggesting that there may be chronic remodeling effects of alcohol
that do not rely on alcohol as an acute trigger. Every decade of alcohol abstinence was associ-
ated with an approximate 20% decreased risk of incident AF, or one can consider the decrease
in risk to be about 2% per year. Our recent study of alcohol consumption and incident AF in
the Offspring and Original Framingham Study cohorts found that an estimated 24% of the
association between alcohol and AF risk was explained by left atrial enlargement, offering a
potential mechanism for alcohol’s arrhythmogenic effects on the myocardium[10]. Further
research into which drinkers experience atrial remodeling and whether left atrial size decreases
in those who quit drinking is critical. In addition, future investigations may help identify
patients particularly prone to alcohol-related AF, and, when done, targeted counseling to those
patients may be especially effective. For a disease that affects millions and is one of the most
important causes of stroke [3], identifying modifiable risk factors is especially important.
Of interest, we found no relationship between either current drinking or cumulative alcohol
exposure and incident AF. While the explanation for this remains unknown, underascertain-
ment of prevalent AF as a cause must be considered. Specifically, prevalent AF was determined
by baseline ECG only and therefore paroxysmal AF patients or formerly cardioverted persis-
tent patients who happened to be in sinus rhythm during their baseline visit would have been
misclassified. If those true (yet underascertained) prevalent AF patients had ceased alcohol
intake because of their AF, this could lead to the false observation that current alcohol con-
sumption failed to predict “incident” AF. Indeed, past consumption predicted incident AF in

participants by baseline drinking status. Differences in proportions with and without AF are compared using the log-rank test.

 unadjusted analysis; loss of statistical significance in that relationship appeared to be primarily
mediated by smoking. Importantly, this potential limitation of underascertainment would not
result in any false positive results regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and
AF and specifically should not explain the results observed regarding differences within the
past consumption group and AF.

 Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First, we used self-report data as a
measure of participants’ past and current drinking behavior. Though self-report has been pre-
viously validated as an accurate, reproducible method of assessing alcohol consumption over
an extended period of time [21, 22], it is possible that this introduced some error into our data.
However, given that participants were unaware of how this alcohol information would be
used, it seems unlikely that recall bias was present. Given that diagnosis of AF relied on pri-
marily hospital discharge records, as well as death certificates and study visit ECGs, under-
ascertainment of incident AF is likely. It is important to emphasize that, in general, this would
lead to inadequate power (and therefore may explain the negative results regarding current
alcohol use and cumulative use) but would not be expected to result in false positives—in
other words, we do not believe that any of these limitations would explain any false positive
findings regarding the primary focus of this paper, alcohol abstinence duration and incident
AF. In addition, given that data regarding paroxysmal versus persistent AF was not collected,
we cannot comment on how alcohol might influence the risk of one type of AF versus another.
A final limitation is our lack of data surrounding participants’ reasons for quitting drinking, as
this may help explain the higher risk of AF among former drinkers. However, this again (if
indeed the case) would not be sufficient to explain a lower risk of AF with a longer duration of
abstinence.
Conclusions
In this study of over 15,000 ARIC participants, we found that among former drinkers, the
number of years of drinking and the amount of alcohol consumed each conferred an increased
risk of AF. Finally, a longer duration of abstinence was associated with a decreased risk of AF,
indicating that earlier modification of heavy alcohol use may have a greater influence on AF
prevention.
