Abstract
Introduction
Residents of some low-income neighborhoods have limited ac-
cess to fresh fruits and vegetables. In 2008, New York City issued
new mobile fruit and vegetable cart licenses for neighborhoods
with inadequate availability of fresh produce. Some of these carts
were equipped with electronic benefit transfer (EBT) machines, al-
lowing them to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram (SNAP) benefits. This article examines the association
between type and quantities of fruits and vegetables purchased
from mobile fruit and vegetable vendors and consumer character-
istics, including payment method.
Methods
Customers at 4 produce carts in the Bronx, New York, were sur-
veyed during 3 periods in 2013 and 2014. Survey data, including
purchased fruit and vegetable quantities, were analyzed using mul-
tivariable negative binomial regressions, with payment method
(cash only vs EBT or EBT and cash) as the primary independent
variable. Covariates included availability of EBT, vendor, and cus-
tomer sociodemographic characteristics.
Results
A total of 779 adults participated in this study. Shoppers who used
SNAP benefits purchased an average of 5.4 more cup equivalents
of fruits and vegetables than did shoppers who paid with cash. Ap-
proximately 80% of this difference was due to higher quantities of
purchased fruits.
Conclusion
Expanding access to EBT machines at mobile produce carts may
increase purchases of fruits and vegetables from these vendors.
Introduction
Cities in the United States are increasingly relying on mobile pro-
duce vendors to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables
(1–3).  On  March  13,  2008,  New  York  City  Mayor  Michael
Bloomberg authorized Local Law 9, establishing 1,000 permits for
mobile fruit and vegetable vendors, called “Green Carts,” across
areas that were deemed to have low food access (4). One goal of
this program was to increase availability of fruits and vegetables in
areas in which residents consume the least amounts of fresh pro-
duce (4,5) and have the highest obesity rates in the city (6).
As of 2013, there were nearly 500 active Green Cart vendors in
the city, operating primarily in the Bronx and Manhattan (7). The
New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC
DOHMH) identified eligible Green Cart vending neighborhoods
as those in which at least 14% of residents had reported not hav-
ing consumed any fruits or vegetables the previous day (5). For
many low-income families, financial constraints may prevent ac-
cess to a nutritious diet, despite having fresh produce available for
sale in the neighborhood. To address this barrier, the city facilit-
ated a public–private partnership to provide financial support to
eligible mobile produce vendors to cover the cost of electronic be-
nefit transfer (EBT) machines that are necessary to accept Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (8,9). As of
2013, 27% of vendors were equipped with EBT machines (7).
Research indicates that Green Carts typically locate in areas with
existing commercial activity and high pedestrian traffic (6,10).
Most customers are part of the target population: people with low

 income, members of minority groups, and residents of neighbor-
hoods in which the carts are located. Furthermore, Green Cart cus-
tomers shop at the carts regularly and report that since doing so
they have increased their produce consumption (7). A NYC
DOHMH evaluation of the Green Cart program from 2008 to 2011
also found that in precincts in which Green Carts were located,
there was an increase in the proportion of other food retail outlets
offering fresh produce, possibly because of an increase in con-
sumer demand generated by the presence of the Green Carts (11).
In our earlier work examining dollars spent per transaction at
Green Carts in the Bronx, we found that customers spent on aver-
age a little more than $4 per transaction. Customers who paid us-
ing SNAP benefits spent more than $8 per transaction (12).
It remains unclear to what extent the Green Carts themselves as-
suage issues of low food access or facilitate healthy food pur-
chases, especially among customers paying with SNAP benefits.
In this study we built on our previous work and set out to answer 2
research questions: 1) What are the types and quantities of fruits
and vegetables purchased at Green Carts in the Bronx, New
York?, and 2) What consumer characteristics, including the use of
SNAP, are correlated with these purchases?
Methods
Data for this cross-sectional study were collected at 4 privately run
and independently operated Green Carts in the Bronx, New York.
This convenience sample of vendors was selected on the basis of
referrals of Green Cart program–interested vendors from the NYC
DOHMH. Each of these vendors generally operated between 7:30
AM to 7:00 PM, Monday through Friday, and sold a comparable
variety of fresh produce items at similar prices. Customers, whom
research assistants confirmed were aged at least 18 years, were in-
vited to respond to a short survey (27 multiple-choice questions)
about their food shopping and consumption patterns. Research as-
sistants took an inventory of items each participant purchased dur-
ing their Green Cart transaction. Interviews were completed in
either  English  or  Spanish,  between  1:30  PM  and  5:30  PM,
Monday through Friday. Approximately 90 surveys were collec-
ted at each cart during each round of data collection. The overall
survey response rate was 70%. Study participants received a single
ride transit pass (value: $2.50) upon completion of the survey.
This study was approved by the New York University School of
Medicine Institutional Review Board. All participants provided
verbal consent.
Research assistants interviewed customers at each cart during sev-
eral periods: 1) June and July 2013, 2) September and October
2013, and 3) June and July 2014. Our original research plan in-
cluded a 2 × 2 difference–in-difference design: surveying custom-
ers at 2 carts with and 2 without EBT in the pre-period, and 4 carts
in the post-period, when all vendors were scheduled to have EBT
machines. However, because of unanticipated changes in vendor
operation and administrative delays in the distribution of EBT ma-
chines, data collection did not proceed as planned. Vendor A (ob-
served during periods 1 and 2) acquired an EBT machine between
visits. Vendors B (periods 1 and 3) and C (periods 1, 2, and 3) had
EBT machines at each period of data collection. Finally, Vendor D
(periods 1 and 3) did not have an EBT machine during either visit.
Accordingly, we were unable to conduct our planned difference-
in-difference analysis. Instead, we analyzed our data as a pooled
cross-section and acknowledged the limitations of this design.
The types and quantity of fruit and vegetable purchases were
entered into the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall sys-
tem (ASA24), a web-based program developed by the National
Cancer Institute (13). On the basis of these entries, ASA24 calcu-
lated comparable food quantities (cup equivalents, which are a
volume measure of the edible portion of the item that fits in a 1-
cup measuring cup [14]) and detailed nutritional content estimates
using the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies (US Department of Agriculture, ver-
sion 4.1). Research assistants completed data entry into ASA24 in
February and March 2015.
We calculated summary statistics for both the full sample of re-
spondents and the subsample of only the respondents surveyed at
carts operating with an EBT machine. These descriptive statistics
included frequencies (participant characteristics) and means (vari-
eties and cup equivalents of fruits and vegetables purchased). Our
primary outcome of interest — cup equivalents of fruits and veget-
ables — was nonnegative and positively skewed. Accordingly, we
modeled this outcome using negative binomial regression, con-
trolling for customer characteristics, including race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic oth-
er/refused), age in years (18–24, 25–39, 40–64, ≥65), sex (male,
female), education level (high school degree or less, some college,
bachelor’s degree or more, missing/refused), and annual house-
hold income (<$25,000; $25,000–$49,999; ≥$50,000; missing/re-
fused) to calculate the relationship between payment method and
the type (dark green, red or orange, starchy, or other vegetables)
and quantity of fruits and vegetables purchased. Analyses were
conducted using Stata v13 (StataCorp).
Results
The full analytic sample included 779 customer surveys (Table 1).
Most respondents were female (74%), Hispanic (54%), had no
more than a high school degree (64%), and lived in households
with an annual household income less than $25,000 (53%). Forty-

 two percent of respondents received SNAP benefits. Respondents
were approximately equally as likely to report that they usually
purchased fruits and vegetables at a grocery store (42%) as they
were to report buying these items from a produce cart (45%). Most
respondents paid for their purchase using only cash (87%) and re-
ported that their purchase was to be shared (71%). Nearly 20% of
respondents at EBT-equipped carts reported using SNAP benefits
to pay for their purchase. Customers paying with SNAP were pre-
dominantly female (90%), Hispanic (75%), lived in households
with less than $25,000 in annual household income (77%), and
purchased items to share (84%). Most customers using SNAP be-
nefits were unemployed (63%) versus slightly more than one-third
(36%) of the full sample. Customers paying with SNAP benefits
reported that their most common source for fruits and vegetables
was produce carts (64%).
On average, surveyed consumers purchased 6.9 cup equivalents of
fruits and 1.8 cup equivalents of vegetables per transaction (Table
2). Customers generally bought more than one type of fruit (1.4)
and less than one type of vegetable (0.7). Vegetables identified as
“other” (eg, corn, onions, garlic, iceberg lettuce) were most com-
monly purchased. Dark green (eg, spinach, kale), red or orange
(eg, beets, carrots), and starchy (eg, potatoes, parsnips) vegetables
represented a minority of the purchases. This rank order was true
regardless of the availability of EBT or payment method.
Customers who reported using SNAP benefits at a Green Cart pur-
chased more fruits and vegetables per transaction than customers
who paid cash only: 18.5 cup equivalents versus 7.3 cup equival-
ents (Table 2) (P < .001). Larger purchase quantity and variety of
“other” vegetables accounted for the total difference in cup equi-
valents purchased by SNAP versus cash-only–paying survey parti-
cipants.
Results from negative binomial regressions indicated that the use
of SNAP benefits at Green Carts was positively associated with
having purchased a larger quantity of fresh produce (Table 3).
Controlling for various consumer and design characteristics (sex,
age, race/ethnicity, education level, annual household income, em-
ployment status, SNAP participation, usual source for produce,
frequency of shopping at the sampled Green Cart, intention to
share purchased items, data collection round, mobile vendor), the
marginal effect of having paid using SNAP benefits was robust
across regressions: 5.4 cup equivalents for the full sample (P <
.001) and 6.4 cup equivalents when the sample was restricted to
consumers at Green Carts equipped with an EBT machine (P <
.001).
Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all variables in the negative bino-
mial regressions are shown in the Appendix. Green Cart custom-
ers who reported that they intended to share their produce pur-
chased 1.5 times more fruits and vegetables than those who did
not intend to share, for both the whole sample and among shop-
pers just at carts with EBT machines. Among all respondents,
people aged 25 to 39 years purchased substantially more veget-
ables than did those aged 18 to 24 years (IRR = 3.3, P = .01). His-
panic survey participants purchased significantly more fruits and
vegetables from Green Carts than non-Hispanic white respond-
ents (IRR = 1.3, P =.03).
Discussion
This research builds on our previous work evaluating the possible
benefits of expanding the introduction of EBT machines at pro-
duce carts (12). In that study, we found that customers who used
SNAP benefits at Green Carts spent significantly more per trans-
action on produce than did those who paid with cash only. Here,
we found that the introduction of mobile produce carts, particu-
larly those equipped with EBT machines, in neighborhoods with
limited availability of fresh fruits and vegetables could be a posit-
ive step toward improving food access. On average, the customers
we surveyed at a sample of these mobile vendors purchased nearly
9 cup equivalents of fresh produce per transaction. Notably, fruit
represented most of the items purchased from the surveyed mo-
bile produce carts (6.9 of 8.7 cup equivalents purchased per aver-
age transaction). We believe this is likely a consequence of the
fact that Green Carts generally have more types of fruits than ve-
getables available for sale.
Although the introduction of EBT machines at mobile produce
carts is a promising mechanism for increasing access to fresh pro-
duce, there are challenges that may limit the widespread use of
EBT machines by mobile produce cart vendors. For example, the
EBT machines require an upfront payment of $900 per machine, a
$35 monthly fee, and a 3.5-cent charge per transaction. Despite a
financial support program to help vendors overcome this barrier
(9), less than a third of eligible vendors were equipped with EBT
machines by mid-2013 (7). On the basis of brief interviews with
the vendors who operated the Green Carts where we conducted
data collection, the general sentiment was that EBT machines in-
creased sales and were generally a good investment. However, it is
unclear how many vendors would be willing or able to afford the
high costs of the machines without financial support. In addition,
administrative hurdles may limit the adoption of EBT machines
among produce vendors.
We believe the results from our study are noteworthy; however,
this study has limitations. First, the sampled carts were all located
in one borough of New York City, and surveys were conducted
during most, but not all, Green Cart operating hours. Additionally,
survey respondents volunteered to participate. Therefore, we do

 not know the extent to which our sample is representative of all
Green Cart customers. Second, although we know whether parti-
cipants intended to share their produce purchases, we do not have
information about how the purchased items were actually shared
(ie, how much or with how many people). Third, we did not col-
lect identifying information from our survey participants. Thus,
we do not know if there were multiple surveys from the same par-
ticipant. If there were repeat measures, then we may have underes-
timated our standard errors. Fourth, we did not conduct a compre-
hensive inventory of variety, quality, or quantity of produce sold
at the Green Carts we observed. As a result, to the extent that the
selection of produce at mobile produce vendors varies across
vendor and time, our results may not generalize beyond our re-
search context. Finally, we lack comprehensive purchasing in-
formation for our survey respondents (ie, quantity of all fresh pro-
duce purchases made from other retailers). In light of these limita-
tions, we cannot make any causal assertions about whether SNAP
beneficiaries purchased more fruits and vegetables in total, nor
whether the availability of EBT machines at Green Carts influ-
enced where consumers chose to shop.
Adequate consumption of minimally processed fruits and veget-
ables is an important component of a healthy diet and is associ-
ated with an array of positive health outcomes (15,16). Although
the research on the associations between food access and health
outcomes is mixed (17,18), we are encouraged by our findings and
would like to see rigorous causal research on the effect of access
to mobile produce carts on fruit and vegetable consumption and
overall diet quality. Results from such research could advance the
literature on the role of this type of intervention in improving pub-
lic health.
EBT capabilities may increase fresh fruit and vegetable purchases,
helping to overcome a barrier to a healthy diet. Although these
findings are not informative about total consumer fruit and veget-
able procurement, the results from our analysis suggest that the
availability of EBT machines at produce carts may increase pur-
chases of fresh fruits and vegetables from those carts. The provi-
sion of mobile produce cart permits and financial assistance for
EBT machines could be sustainably scalable, although we invite
additional causal research on the subject before making policy re-
commendations.
