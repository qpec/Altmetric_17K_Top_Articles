Background and Purpose—The aim of the study was to assessed the impact of short-term exposure to air pollution on 
ischemic stroke subtype, while focusing on stroke caused via cardioembolism.
Methods—From a nationwide, multicenter, prospective, stroke registry database, 13 535 patients with acute ischemic stroke 
hospitalized to 12 participating centers were enrolled in this study. Data on the hourly concentrations of particulate matter 
<10 μm, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) were collected from 181 
nationwide air pollution surveillance stations. The average values of these air pollutants over the 7 days before stroke 
onset from nearest air quality monitoring station in each patient were used to determine association with stroke subtype. 
The primary outcome was stroke subtype, including large artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel occlusion, cardioembolism, 
and stroke of other or undetermined cause.
Results—Particulate matter <10 μm and SO2 concentrations were independently associated with an increased risk of 
cardioembolic stroke, as compared with large artery atherosclerosis and noncardioembolic stroke. In stratified analyses, 
the proportion of cases of cardioembolic stroke was positively correlated with the particulate matter <10 μm, NO2, and 
SO2 quintiles. Moreover, seasonal and geographic factors were related to an increased proportion of cardioembolic stroke, 
which may be attributed to the high levels of air pollution.
Conclusions—Our findings suggest that the short-term exposure to air pollutants is associated with cardioembolic stroke, 
and greater care should be taken for those susceptible to cerebral embolism during peak pollution periods. Public and 
environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could help slow down global increasing trends of cardioembolic 
stroke.

ardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer are the lead-
ing causes of death worldwide,1 and their associations 
with environmental factors are being increasingly reported.2,3 
Based on pathophysiologic mechanisms, there is a possibil-
ity of a disparate association between environmental factors 
and particular subtypes of disease. For instance, the continu-
ing increase in the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma sub-
types can be at least partly attributed to the worsening of air 
pollution.4,5
Recent meta-analysis indicated a close temporal associa-
tion between the exposure to gaseous and particulate air pol-
lution and admission to hospital for stroke or death caused 
by stroke.6 Because stroke is a heterogeneous disorder and its 
subtype depends on the underlying vascular risk factors and 
acute phase triggers,7,8 the effect of air pollution on stroke 
may differ according to the subtype. Experimental and epi-
demiological studies have described the deleterious effects of 
air pollution on cardiac arrhythmia and dysfunctional heart 
rate modulation.9,10 Hence, it can be suggested that air pollu-
tion may be associated with a particular subtype of ischemic 
stroke, such as cardioembolic stroke.
We hypothesized that short-term exposure to air pollution 
can trigger the onset of cardioembolic stroke. In the present 
study, we attempted to explore this hypothesis by investigat-
ing the association between short-term air pollution exposure 
and ischemic stroke subtypes using information obtained from 
the national air pollution surveillance system and a nation-
wide, prospective, stroke registry database in Korea.
Methods
Patients and Work-Up
A consecutive series of patients hospitalized for the treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke within 7 days of symptom onset between January 
2011 and December 2013 was identified from the Clinical Research 
Center for Stroke 5th division registry database—a prospective, 
multicenter, nationwide web-based, acute stroke registry database 
established in 2008.11 The registry includes consecutive acute stroke 
or transient ischemic attack cases from 12 academic and regional 
stroke centers across the nation (Figure 1). The collection of clinical 
information for the Clinical Research Center for Stroke 5th division 
registry was approved by the local institutional review boards in all 
participating centers with a waiver of patient consent because of the 
anonymity of the collected data and the minimal risk to participants. 
We obtained further approval for the use of the registry database for 
the present study.
Clinical information, including age, sex, address of residence at the 
time of stroke, medical history (including previous stroke, coronary 
heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial 
fibrillation, and smoking status), prestroke medication history (anti-
thrombotics, antihypertensive, glucose lowering agent, and statin), 
stroke profile (stroke subtype and initial National Institute of Health 
stroke scales score), and laboratory findings (systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose levels), was acquired 
from the Clinical Research Center for Stroke 5th division registry 
database.
Pathogenic evaluation and the management of acute ischemic 
stroke in participating centers were performed according to contem-
porary clinical practice guidelines and institutional protocols and at 
the discretion of the responsible physician. Stroke subtypes were 
classified into 4 categories according to the cause, based on a slight 
modification of the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment 
(TOAST) classification: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small-
vessel occlusion, cardioembolism, and stroke of other determined 
(OD) cause and undetermined cause.12
Ambient Air Pollution Information
The air pollution information used in this study included the levels of 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 μm (PM10), 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and car-
bon monoxide (CO). The technical equipment adopted for measuring 
levels of air pollutants are summarized in Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement. In December 2011, 235 air pollution monitoring 
stations, covering 95 major cities and local districts in Korea, were 
continuously measuring the levels of air pollutants on an hourly basis 
(Figure 1). An annual report on ambient air quality based on monthly 
and annual mean is publically distributed by the Korea Ministry of 
Environment. The raw data containing information on the continu-
ously measured (24 times a day and 7 days a week) 1-hour mean 
measurement results from each individual monitoring station during 
our study period were obtained for the present study, by courtesy of 
the statistics division at the Korea Ministry of Environment.
Individual patients were matched with their nearest air pollution 
monitoring station by their address of residence at the time of stroke 
onset, and air pollutant levels during 0 to 7 days before stroke onset 
were recorded in a database. The average values of 5 air pollutants 
(PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) during the 7 days before stroke onset 
in each patient were used for statistical analyses.13
Statistical Analysis
The differences between the groups were examined using the χ2 test 
or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, as well as the Student 
t test, Mann–Whitney U test, or 1-way ANOVA for continuous 
variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to 
evaluate the independent association between stroke subtype and 
the indices of air pollutant profiles, while using the LAA group as 
reference (based on a large sample size). For each air pollutant, 
an increment of 10 μg/m3 for PM10; 10 ppb (parts per billion) for 
NO2, SO2, and O3; and 1 ppm (parts per million) for CO was used 
to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each 
stroke subtype.6 A generalized linear mixed model (using a random 
intercept model) was applied to account for the differences between 
monitoring stations. The potential confounders for stroke subtype

included age, sex, history of previous stroke, coronary heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and 
smoking status, which were adjusted for in the first multivariable 
model. To account for the influence of meteorology on air quality, 
we further adjusted for the 7-day prestroke mean temperature and 
rain volume in the second multivariable model.14 To examine the 
validity of the detected associations, additional stratified analyses 
were performed according to the seasonal variations and popula-
tion density in the patient’s area of residence. In Korea, the 7 most 
densely populated cities are defined as Metropolitan area, including 
the capital city Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, 
and Ulsan (population range of 1.0–9.8 million, as of 2010). 
Seventy-six districts with population sizes of 40 000 to 1 000 000 
were defined as cities, whereas less populated areas were defined 
as rural area.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and a 2-sided P<0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
During the study period, 16 845 patients with acute ischemic 
stroke were admitted to the participating centers within 7 days 
of symptom onset. Of these, patients who had no or inadequate 
information on residential address (n=2899) and air pollution 
(n=411) were excluded from the study. Of the 13 535 sub-
jects included in the study, 58.5% were men, and the aver-
age age was 67.8 years (range, 13–102 years). Overall, 3010 
patients (22.2%) were assigned to the cardioembolism group 
and 10 525 (77.8%) were assigned to the non- cardioembolism 
group. The noncardioembolism group included 4993 patients 
with LAA, 2237 patients with stroke caused by small-vessel 
occlusion, and 3295 patients with stroke of OD and UD.
The patient characteristics according to stroke subtype 
are presented in Table 1. The patients in the cardioembolism 
group tended to be older, and the male:female ratio was lower 
than in the other groups. The prevalence rates of previous 
stroke history, coronary heart disease history, hypertension, 
and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in the cardio-
embolism group. With regard to the laboratory results, the car-
dioembolism group had significantly lower cholesterol levels 
and initial glucose levels. Moreover, a greater proportion of 
patients in the cardioembolism group were taking antithrom-
botics, antihypertensive, and statins.

The distribution of air pollution parameters according to 
the geographic location and season is presented in Tables 
II and III in the online-only Data Supplement. Air pollutant 
levels were significantly different across seasons and geo-
graphic locations (P<0.001 for all air pollutants). The number 
of measurements used to determine the average levels of air 
pollutants 7 days before stroke onset ranged from 123 to 168 
(median, 166), wherein data from 181 air pollution monitor-
ing stations (124 in city, 38 located at roadside, and 19 in rural 
area) were utilized.
The association between air pollutant exposure and the 
risk of cardioembolism is presented in Table 2. Multinomial 
logistic regression analyses, using LAA as a reference group, 
showed that increased PM10 and SO2 levels were significantly 
associated with the occurrence of cardioembolic stroke, after 
adjustment for potential confounders, in 2 multivariable 
models. In addition, higher NO2 levels were found to be asso-
ciated with cardioembolism in a crude model, but not in mul-
tivariable model 1 (with adjustments for age, sex, and medical 
history) and model 2 (with additional adjustments for meteo-
rologic factors). Positive associations were also observed 
between CO and OD cause and undetermined cause, in ref-
erence to LAA, in multinomial logistic regression analyses. 
Binary logistic regression analyses comparing cardioembo-
lism with noncardioembolism showed that increased PM10, 
NO2, and SO2 levels were significantly associated with the 
occurrence of cardioembolic stroke (Table 3). Furthermore, a 
sensitivity analysis was performed using different cutoff val-
ues for air pollution. After reclassifying air pollutant levels 
according to quintiles, we noted that cardioembolism occur-
rence showed significantly positive correlations with PM10, 
NO2, and SO2 quintiles (P for trend < 0.01 for all 3 pollutants;

Figure 2). However, O3 and CO were not associated with car-
dioembolism in any of the models. The patient characteristics 
according quintiles of SO2 are summarized in Table IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
For stratified analysis, we performed stratified evalua-
tions using seasonal variations and population density of the 
patient’s area of residence (Figure 3). The air pollutant levels 
(PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO) were higher in spring and winter 
than in summer and fall and showed a clear correlation with 
the increased proportion of cardioembolic stroke. Moreover, 
air pollution was most severe in midsized cities where the 
prevalence of the cardioembolism subtype was highest.
Discussion
In the present study, we observed a significant association 
between the selected air pollutants and cardioembolism. 
In particular, the average air pollutants levels of PM10 and 
SO2 within 7 days before stroke onset were associated with 
an increased incidence of the cardioembolism subtype. The 
associations were determined by using multivariable models 
and were further validated through stratified analyses while 
accounting for seasonal variations and population density of 
the patient’s area of residence.
The current data on the association between air pollution 
and ischemic stroke subtypes are limited and conflicting. 
Most studies have focused on the long-term exposure to air 
pollution and stroke mortality or hospitalization for stroke. 
Four studies with case-crossover designs reported inconsis-
tent relationships between short-term exposure to selected air 
pollutants and large artery atherosclerotic stroke, small-vessel 
occlusion, or transient ischemic attack, rather than cardioem-
bolic stroke.15–18 The limitations of these studies include the 
collection of air pollution information from a single monitor-
ing site, the assessment of the study population from only a 
single institute.
Ambient air pollution may be detrimental to endothelial 
function in the cerebral vasculature; in fact, fine PM has been 
linked to carotid intimal thickness and cerebral vascular resis-
tance.19,20 However, the findings of the present study highlight 
the significance of short-term exposure (levels of air pollu-
tion within 7 days before stroke onset) in the development 
of stroke and suggest that the exposure to air pollution could 
trigger stroke onset. The association of short-term exposure 
to air pollution with cardioembolic stroke could be mediated 
through both the direct and indirect effects of air pollutant 
exposure on heart rate modulation,21 arrhythmia,9,10 systemic 
inflammation,22 endothelial dysfunction,23 and blood coagula-
tion.24 Although the precise underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear, we believe that air pollution leads to ischemic stroke 
via the development of cardiogenic emboli, rather than via a 
direct effect on the brain or cerebral vessels.
The occurrence of cardioembolic stroke has been increas-
ing along with the rapid aging of the global population.25 
However, changing environmental factors may also play an 
important role in such a secular trend. The overwhelming 
increase observed in the incidence of cardioembolic stroke 
in Asian and other developing countries could, in part, be 
explained by aggravating environmental factors.26,27 A recent 
meta-analysis showed that the increased risk of stroke in 
Asian countries was almost 2 to 9 times higher than that in 
Europe and North America, where ambient air concentrations 
are generally higher.28
The findings of the present study are in agreement with the 
results of other studies, which suggest that seasonal varia-
tions in stroke occurrence could be partly attributed to the

levels of air pollution. In our sensitivity analysis, the propor-
tion of cases with cardioembolic stroke was higher during the 
spring and winter seasons, when the levels of air pollutants 
are higher, than in the summer and fall. In the Framingham 
Study cohort, the incidence of cardioembolic stroke was 
higher during winter (34%) and was similar from spring to 
fall (22%).29 The occurrence of Asian dust storms in Korea 
during early spring is a possible explanation for the increased 
occurrence of cardioembolic stroke during winter and spring 
in the present study.30 Moreover, we observed that the inci-
dence of cardioembolism was highest among ischemic stroke 
patients living in areas defined as cities, where air pollution is 
the highest.
The strength of this study lies in the individual matching of 
air pollution data to individual patient’s data of demographics, 
risk factors, stroke mechanism, onset date, and residential area. 
Much of the existing literature were based on the association 
of administrative data, and most studies have limited ability to 
classify stroke subtype. In the present study, we explored the 
relationship between air pollution and stroke subtype based on 
detailed temporal and spatial levels of air pollution informa-
tion. Moreover, we examined the association using a relatively 
large cohort that was derived from a nationwide, prospective, 
stroke registry database.
However, this study did have certain limitations. First, 
information on the personal levels of air pollutant exposure, 
such as time spent in traffic, duration of outdoor activity, 
and occupational exposure, was not collected. The actual 
exposure to air pollutants may vary at a personal level and 
could have a significant impact on the stroke subtype.31 In 
addition, indoor air pollution and organic solvents could 
also have a substantial effect on public health, but were 
not considered in the present study.32 Polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon, with prothrombotic and arrhythmogenic 
effect, has been reported to have high concentration in 
indoor environment.33 Furthermore, the concentrations of 
air pollutants can vary substantially within small areas.34 
Future studies should aim to collect additional detailed data 
on individual exposure and indoor air pollution. Second, the 
pathophysiological pathways underlying the relationship 
between air pollutants and cardioembolic stroke could not 
be identified in the present study. Further information on 
cardioaortic sources of cerebral embolism could help eluci-
date the underlying mechanism, and aid in the identification 
of patients who are more susceptible to air pollution. In our 
data set, atrial fibrillation was the most common cause of 
the cardioembolism subtype, and the association with air 
pollution was more clearly observed in these cases than 
among those with nonatrial fibrillation-related cardioem-
bolism or noncardioembolism (data not shown). However, 
further studies are needed to demonstrate the arrhythmo-
genic effects of air pollution in patients with stroke. Data 
collected from ongoing studies involving long-term cardiac 
telemonitoring in patients with cryptogenic embolic stroke 
may provide an answer when assessed along with relevant 
ambient air pollution data. Third, data on PM2.5 concentra-
tion, which is key regulatory interest in both the United 
States and Europe, and could be more pathogenically rel-
evant to initiation of stroke events, were not available for 
analysis in this study. Further study investigating the asso-
ciation between exposure to PM2.5 and cardioembolic stroke 
is warranted. Fourth, the authors were unable to satisfacto-
rily interpret the significant protective relationship between 
CO and OD cause and undetermined cause, with regards to 
LAA, in the present study. This correlation should be con-
firmed in a population with a detailed classification of OD 
cause and undetermined cause. Finally, this study was based 
on a prospective cohort of patients with stroke, and we were 
therefore unable to analyze our hypothesis with reference 
to stroke incidence across the Korean population using 
Poisson regression or case-crossover analytic approaches. 
Hence, the results of this study should be confirmed in a 
larger scale and preferably population-based study.
Conclusions
Our results show that air pollutants—particularly PM10 and 
SO2—are associated with cardioembolic stroke and suggest 
that greater care should be taken for those susceptible to cere-
bral embolism during peak pollution periods. Furthermore, the 
findings indicate that healthcare providers and environmental 
policy makers should pay further interest to pollution-related 
stroke and cardiovascular disease.
