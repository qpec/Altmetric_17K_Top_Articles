Objective To determine the association between daily 
levels of registered nurse (RN) and nursing assistant 
staffing and hospital mortality.
Design This is a retrospective longitudinal observational 
study using routinely collected data. We used multilevel/
hierarchical mixed-effects regression models to explore 
the association between patient outcomes and daily 
variation in RN and nursing assistant staffing, measured 
as hours per patient per day relative to ward mean. 
Analyses were controlled for ward and patient risk.
Participants 138 133 adult patients spending >1 days 
on general wards between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 
2015.
Outcomes In-hospital deaths.
Results Hospital mortality was 4.1%. The hazard of 
death was increased by 3% for every day a patient 
experienced RN staffing below ward mean (adjusted 
HR (aHR) 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05). Relative to ward 
mean, each additional hour of RN care available over the 
first 5 days of a patient’s stay was associated with 3% 
reduction in the hazard of death (aHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 
to 1.0). Days where admissions per RN exceeded 125% 
of the ward mean were associated with an increased 
hazard of death (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 1.09). Although 
low nursing assistant staffing was associated with 
increases in mortality, high nursing assistant staffing was 
also associated with increased mortality.
Conclusion Lower RN staffing and higher levels 
of admissions per RN are associated with increased 
risk of death during an admission to hospital. These 
findings highlight the possible consequences of reduced 
nurse staffing and do not give support to policies that 
encourage the use of nursing assistants to compensate 
for shortages of RNs.
IntroductIon
In common with health services in many 
countries, hospitals in the UK find it 
difficult to fully staff hospital wards. In 
the face of budgetary constraints and 
increasing demand for healthcare, there 
are persistent and growing shortages of 
registered nurses (RNs).1 Many hospitals 
rely on unregistered nursing assistants to 
deliver a substantial proportion of ‘hands 
on’ care. The proportion of fully trained 
RNs delivering care on hospital wards 
in England is already among the lowest 
in Europe.2 Recruitment and retention 
difficulties, 
combined 
with 
ongoing 
government austerity measures, are set 
to increase pressure to reduce both the 
absolute numbers of staff deployed on 
the wards and the number of RNs relative 
to the number of nursing assistants.1 3 4 
However, both reducing the RN work-
force and substitution of nursing assis-
tants for RNs have been questioned on 
the grounds of adverse effects on patient 
safety.5 6 In this paper we explore how 
variation in the size and composition of 
the nursing workforce may influence 
mortality rates in an English National 
Health Service (NHS) hospital.
In England, a series of inquiries into 
poor care and adverse outcomes expe-
rienced by patients in Stafford Hospital 
from 2005 to 2009 drew attention to 
deficiencies in nurse staffing. Following 
this, the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) was commis-
sioned to develop guidance on ‘safe nurse 
staffing’ in adult inpatient wards. As 
part of this process NICE commissioned 
reviews of evidence. Despite the many 
studies demonstrating hospital-level asso-
ciations between lower RN staffing levels 
or dilute skill-mix and adverse patient 
outcomes, including an increased risk of 
death,7 when NICE published its guid-
ance in 2014, it concluded that:
Insufficient evidence is available about 
the relationship between staffing, ward-
level factors and outcomes. (NICE, 
p35)8
A key factor limiting the extent to 
which existing research can be used as the 
basis for informing staffing guidelines is 
that most studies are cross-sectional, with

outcomes and nurse staffing levels measured at the 
hospital level and averaged over time.7 In a notable 
exception to this pattern, Needleman et al9 found that 
there was a 2% increase in the hazard of death for 
every occasion when patients were exposed to RN 
staffing substantially below the level that was planned 
for a shift during their hospital stay. While this study 
demonstrated a prospective association between low 
staffing and death, results were derived from a single 
US hospital, and the study focused on RN staffing levels 
only, without examining the contribution of nursing 
assistants. A more recent study in four Finnish hospi-
tals also demonstrated an association between daily 
workload per nurse and adverse outcomes, but again 
did not address composition of the nursing team.10
Since European hospitals typically have fewer RNs 
and a higher proportion of nursing assistants in the 
nursing care workforce than in the USA,5 it is particu-
larly important to consider the potential contributions 
of assistant staff to maintaining safety. In the current 
study, we aim to determine whether patients who were 
exposed to periods of low staffing by RNs and nursing 
assistants during a stay on general wards in a large 
general hospital in England experienced an increased 
risk of death.
Methods
This was a retrospective longitudinal observational 
study using routinely collected data about staffing 
and all patients who spent time on 32 general adult 
medical and surgical wards (see online supplemen-
tary materials) of a large acute care general hospital 
NHS Trust in the South of England from April 2012 
to March 2015.
data sources
Nurse staffing data were extracted from an elec-
tronic rostering system, which contained records 
of shifts worked, location, hours and grade for all 
nurses employed by the hospital. Temporary staffing 
deployed on the wards was derived from a data-
base recording bank (extracontractual work by staff 
employed by the Trust) and agency (staff employed 
through an external agency) shifts. Both databases 
were subject to extensive checking and validation 
as they were directly used to manage staff working 
patterns and payments. In total, we identified 538 
238 shifts worked by RNs (fully qualified nurses on 
the Nursing and Midwifery Council Register with 
university diploma or degree-level qualification or 
equivalent) or nursing assistants (nursing care assis-
tant personnel with no formal training requirements 
or registration, typically employed in roles described 
as healthcare assistants or support workers in NHS 
pay bands 2–4).
Patient data were extracted from the patient 
administration system and an electronic system used 
routinely to record patient vital signs (Vitalpac). 
These data consisted of the following:
 
►
Patient demographic and diagnostic data, including 
acute diagnosis and comorbidities.
 
►
National Early Warning Score (NEWS) on admission.
 
►
Transfers within the hospital, used to determine the 
wards where a patient received care and to link patients 
to staffing data.
Patient data were in turn used to determine the 
number of patients on each ward and the number of 
new admissions to the ward for each day. In total, 
we identified 148 994 patients who spent one or 
more days on eligible wards in the 3 years of the 
study.
Our study required that these data sources were 
linked for analysis purposes. Because shift patterns 
varied substantially between and within wards, 
with a mixture of traditional (8 hours) and long (12 
hours) shifts, we considered staffing levels in terms 
of hours per patient day for each staff group. As the 
calculation of this variable was derived from nursing 
hours worked and the number of patients on that 
ward, we had to remove days from the study where 
we could not reliably match the two. From a theo-
retical maximum of 35 040 ward days (365 days × 
3 years × 32 wards), there were 1822 days on which 
no patients were recorded on study wards because of 
ward closures. Of the remaining 33 218 days, 2236 
(6.7%) were either unavailable or excluded for other 
reasons, including days immediately preceding/
following ward closure or opening, where extremely 
low values for the patient population resulted in 
extremely high nursing hours per patient day. In 
these cases, the relevant days were excluded from 
the study when the patient population fell below 
25% of the median. In some cases, we could not 
reliably match the ward codes used for patients with 
those used for staff. As an example, a ‘ward’ could 
move from one physical location to another (some-
times occupying part of another existing ward), 
resulting in situations where patients were coded 
to the new ward (based on physical location), while 
the electronic rostering system still recorded staff on 
the ‘old’ ward. We retained patients where we had 
at least 1 day of valid staffing measurement. After 
linking to staffing data, the study sample comprised 
138 133 admissions (93% of all potentially eligible 
admissions).
The study used patient and staff data that were 
not provided with explicit consent for research 
purposes. No sensitive data which might aid iden-
tification of individuals (eg, postcode area) were 
transferred to the research team, and all individual 
identifiers were pseudonymised, meaning that indi-
viduals could be linked across data sets but the 
research team had no way of linking to original 
identifiers in source files.

Original research
Measures
The primary outcome was death in hospital during 
the admission, with death within the first 30 days 
of admission as a secondary outcome. For each 
admission, we used diagnostic and demographic 
factors (including diagnosis, age and comorbidity) 
to calculate a predicted risk of death using coef-
ficients derived from the Summary Hospital 
Mortality Indicator (SHMI) model.11 We used the 
June 2015 model, which was developed from data 
on all acute admissions in England for the previous 
3 years, approximately coinciding with the study 
period.12 This approach allowed us to estimate 
the risk associated with a wide range of diagnostic 
groups (including the effect of interaction between 
diagnosis and age, comorbidity and admission 
route) derived from a national population, whereas 
directly adjusting for mortality risk using only local 
data would inevitably mean that the risks associated 
with some diagnoses could not be accurately esti-
mated due to small sample sizes. Because the SHMI 
risk score reflects the average risk for patients 
admitted with a given set of characteristics, we also 
used the patient’s first early warning score, calcu-
lated from the first recorded set of vital signs using 
NEWS, which reflects the patient’s acuity on or 
near the point of admission. NEWS has been shown 
to be highly accurate in predicting death in hospital 
(area under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve for death within 24 hours: 0.89).13 As this 
measure is taken at the beginning of a patient’s 
stay, it is largely independent of any effects that 
may result from variation in nurse staffing, whereas 
subsequent scores may be influenced by the care 
received.
Staffing levels were measured as hours per patient 
per day for RNs and unregistered nursing assistants, 
with variables normalised as absolute deviations 
from the mean for each ward, reflecting the different 
staffing requirements on each ward. The mean 
staffing for each ward corresponded closely with the 
hours per patient day estimated from planned staffing 
levels (establishments), which were determined by a 
widely used staffing methodology, the Safer Nursing 
Care Tool14 (online supplementary table a).
We considered staffing as both a categorical vari-
able (days with staffing below the ward mean hours 
per patient day) and as a continuous variable (daily 
hours above/below ward mean) in separate analyses. 
Because the level of nursing work is also likely to 
be influenced by the turnover of patients caused by 
admissions and discharges,9 we calculated a variable 
to indicate days of unusually high patient turnover 
for the ward relative to the available workforce. Since 
ward establishments are set to accommodate typical 
admission levels, we identified days when admis-
sions per nurse exceeded 125% of the mean for that 
ward—reflecting a mismatch between demand and 
available staff, resulting from either a low number of 
staff or a high number of admissions.
Analysis
We 
used 
multilevel/hierarchical 
mixed-effects 
survival models to explore the association between 
staffing levels and death. A proportional hazard 
model was specified. In addition to the staffing level 
variable, all models included variables to control for 
patient risk (SHMI risk score, first NEWS and emer-
gency admission), patient turnover (admissions per 
RN/nursing assistant above 125% of mean) and ward 
as a random effect. Survival models consider the 
time to event (in this case death), and the resulting 
HR considers the relative rate of death over a period 
of time.15 Because staffing levels vary both between 
and within wards and patients move from ward to 
ward, we considered staffing levels as time-varying 
covariates in a repeated-measures framework, with 
all staffing level variables normalised relative to the 
mean for the current ward. Thus our estimates of the 
effect of staffing reflect variation within wards rather 
than variation between wards. Variation between 
wards may simply reflect an assessment of different 
levels of care required. RN and nursing assistant 
staffing levels were expressed as a cumulative sum 
of exposure. Staffing on wards other than general 
wards (eg, intensive care unit) was not considered 
and so did not contribute to the cumulative sum. 
We explored non-linear effects of staffing levels 
by including quadratic and cubic terms in models. 
Relative improvements in model fit were assessed 
by looking for reductions in the Akaike information 
criterion and Bayesian information criterion. An 
exponential distribution was assumed for the base-
line hazard function, selected as it provided superior 
model fit to the Cox proportional hazards, where no 
distribution is assumed. Analyses were undertaken 
using the Stata Statistical Software: Release V
.14 
using the xtstreg command.
Our primary analysis considered staffing during the 
first 5 days of stay, reflecting the majority of the stay 
for the majority of patients, but we also undertook 
secondary analysis considering all days of the stay. 
The analysis thus focuses on the period of hospital 
stay when the patient is most likely to be acutely 
ill, while still including staffing levels experienced 
by the majority of patients for the majority of their 
stay (median stay is less than 3 days). This approach 
to modelling reflects that taken by Needleman and 
colleagues.9

Patient and staffing characteristics
The majority of patients were admitted as emer-
gencies (79%). The mean age of admitted patients 
was 67 years, with 14% aged ≥85 years. While

Index (CMI) 0), 35% of patients had a CMI score 
of ≥5 (table 1). Overall, 5662 patients died (4.1%). 
One hundred and thirty-seven different diagnostic 
groups were represented as the main diagnosis asso-
ciated with the admission, based on the diagnostic 
groups used to calculate SHMI.11 Pneumonia was 
the single most common diagnosis (4.2%), with the 
most common 15 diagnostic groups accounting for 
38% of all admissions. The diagnostic group asso-
ciated with most deaths was also pneumonia (21% 
of all deaths). The mean length of stay was 6.8 days 
(median 2.7).
Across all wards the mean staffing levels were 4.75 
RN hours per patient per day and 2.99 nursing assis-
tant hours per patient per day. The mean skill-mix 
was 61% RN. Staffing levels varied considerably 
both between and within wards (online supplemen-
tary table a). The mean RN hours per patient per 
day varied from 2.91 (a general medical respiratory 
ward) to 9.61 (renal high care). Skill-mix (propor-
tion of RNs) varied from 86% (renal ward) to 46% 
(medical general ward). The SD for variation of 
staffing within wards was, on average, 18% of the 
mean for RN hours per patient per day and 29% 
of the mean for nursing assistant hours per patient 
per day. Over the first 5 days of their hospital stay, 
patients experienced a mean of 1.93 days of low 
RN staffing and 1.94 days of low nursing assistant 
staffing, with a mean cumulative shortfall of 0.39 
RN hours per patient and 0.25 nursing assistant 
hours per patient (online supplementary table b). 
Admissions above 125% of the ward mean occurred 
on around a quarter of all days (27% for admissions 
per RN and 26% for admissions per nursing assis-
tant), with patients exposed to a mean of 0.88 days 
of high admissions per RN and 0.91 days of high 
admissions per nursing assistant during their first 5 
days (online supplementary table c).
staffing, turnover and mortality
For each day that a patient spent on a ward with RN 
staffing below the mean for that ward, the hazard of 
death was increased by 3% (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.03, 
95% CI 1.01 to 1.06). Each day of exposure to nursing 
assistant staffing below the mean was associated with 
a 4% increase in the hazard of death (aHR 1.04, 95% 
CI 1.02 to 1.07). When patients were on wards where 
admissions per RN exceeded 125% of the mean for that 
ward, the hazard of death was increased by 5% (aHR 
1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09), but there was no significant 
association between admissions per nursing assistant and 
death (table 2).
When considering deaths within 30 days of admission 
only, the model coefficients were almost identical. We 
also considered deaths within 5 and 10 days of admission 
only, which yielded a similar pattern of results, although 
for deaths within 5 days the effect of low RN staffing was 
greater and the effect of low nursing assistant staffing 
smaller and non-significant (online supplementary 
tables e-g). Similarly, restricting the model to emergency

admissions only had no effect on the coefficients for the 
staffing variables. Models including exposure to low 
staffing on all days of the hospital stay showed signifi-
cant adverse effects from low RN staffing only, although 
the coefficients were lower (aHR 1.01 per day), a likely 
product of increased risk being primarily associated with 
days early in the stay (online supplementary tables h-i).
Adding variables to account for weekend admissions 
or weekend stay, periods where low staffing by other 
professions might co-occur with low staffing by nurses, 
did not substantially alter the coefficients or the substan-
tive statistical conclusions (online supplementary tables 
j-k). We considered the possibility that low staffing 
might co-occur with seasonal infections by examining 
the frequency of influenza as an admission diagnosis 
among patients who died. Influenza occurs margin-
ally less often among those exposed to low staffing 
compared with those not exposed (0.5% vs 0.8% for 
low staffing on first day, 0.5% vs 1.3% for low staffing 
on any day; online supplementary table l). We looked for 
seasonal trends in staffing and found no clear pattern, 
although RN staffing was higher in winter months 
compared with summer months, whereas nursing assis-
tant staffing was lower at the beginning of the year (late 
winter) compared with summer months and early winter 
(online supplementary figures a,b). Finally we calculated 
the association between staffing levels relative to ward 
mean and patient risk (SHMI and first NEWS) and 
found no significant associations (online supplementary 
tables m-r).
In order to further quantify the effect of variation in 
staffing levels, we explored the effects of absolute vari-
ations by calculating the cumulative sum of staffing in 
hours per patient per day relative to the mean for the 
ward for each patient for each of the first 5 days. This 
gives an indication of the average staffing experienced by 
the patient, relative to what was normal for each ward 
(table 3). Every additional RN hour per patient was 
associated with a 3% reduction in the hazard of death 
(aHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00). However, additional 
nursing assistant hours were not significantly associated 
with a reduced hazard of death (aHR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 
to 1.04). The results were similar when considering only 
the cumulative sum of hours below the mean (see online 
supplementary tables s-t).
The contrast between analyses treating staffing as a 
categorical variable and treating it as a continuous vari-
able, particularly in relation to nursing assistant staffing 
levels, raises the possibility of a non-linear effect. We 
explored this by introducing quadratic and cubic terms 
for the staffing variables into the models. The coeffi-
cients are reported in table 3. The quadratic term for 
nursing assistant staffing was significant and the cubic 
term neared significance, indicating a non-linear rela-
tionship. In order to understand the non-linear relation-
ship, we plotted the curves based on these coefficients.

Figure 1 Non-linear effects of nurse staffing. Change in the hazard of death associated with variation in staffing levels, relative to the mean. RN, 
registered nurse.
The hazard of death was increased when patients were 
exposed to either more than average or less than average 
nursing assistant hours over the course of their stay, 
while the relationship between RN staffing and the 
hazard of death appears to be linear (figure 1). We also 
considered whether there was evidence that variation in 
levels of nursing assistant staffing could alter the effect 
of RN staffing (or vice versa) by introducing an interac-
tion term into the model. There was no significant inter-
action between RN hours and nursing assistant hours 
(online supplementary table v).
dIscussIon
When patients experienced days where staffing levels 
fell below the ward’s mean, their risk of death was 
increased. While the relationship appeared to be linear 
for RN staffing levels, there was evidence that the risk 
of death increased as patients were exposed to levels of 
nursing assistant staffing that were either above or below 
the mean. While our study largely confirms existing 
findings about the association between RN staffing and 
outcomes, it provides important additional information. 
First, the association is demonstrated at a patient level 
with a longitudinal association between variation in 
staffing and outcome, providing important confirmation 
that the hospital-level cross-sectional associations reflect 
individual patient exposures. Second, we have demon-
strated that the relationship appears to be linear with 
no threshold effect over the range of variation that we 
observed. Although this is the first study to show a signif-
icant harmful effect from low nursing assistant staffing, 
we also show a potential harm when staffing from this 
group is above the mean.
The NHS has begun to use a standard metric of ‘care 
hours per patient day’ to provide a comparison of staffing 
levels between hospitals.3 This measure combines regis-
tered nursing and nursing care assistant hours to give a 
single measure. Our findings clearly show that a measure 
combining these two staff groups in this way is unwar-
ranted. Cross-sectional studies have found that lower 
skill-mix has been associated with worse outcomes, 
including mortality (eg, refs5 16 17). However, if only 
examining the proportion of RNs in the workforce, the 
independent contribution of each staff group cannot be 
properly determined. Most studies that have considered 
both RNs and other nursing staff groups as independent 
predictors have found that having more assistant nursing 
personnel was not associated with mortality or was asso-
ciated with increased mortality at a hospital level.18–21

mortality and adverse effects on several other outcomes 
from adding assistants to the workforce.22
Although our findings lend no support to a policy 
of compensating for deficits in the RN workforce by 
employing more nursing assistants, these results do show 
that an adequate number of assistants is important for 
maintaining patient safety. Findings of some studies show 
a net negative effect from adding any assistant staff at any 
given level of RN staffing, because of the reduction in 
skill-mix.5 Our results show that there may be an optimal 
level of assistant staffing. The mean staffing levels on the 
wards we studied corresponded closely to the staffing 
establishments (planned staffing levels), which were 
determined by a widely used staffing methodology, the 
Safer Nursing Care Tool.14 When assistant staffing was 
close to this level, the hazard of death was reduced. The 
mechanism by which adding further assistants above this 
level can lead to worse outcomes requires further explo-
ration. Increases in assistant staffing levels in response 
to increases in patient dependency is a possible expla-
nation, although we found no association between our 
measures of mortality risk and assistant staffing levels, 
which makes this unlikely. It may be that the presence 
of additional direct care staff creates a division of labour 
that means RNs spend less time with patients, reducing 
opportunities for ongoing monitoring, assessment and 
evaluation outside scheduled observations.22
While nursing assistant staffing above the mean was 
associated with no additional benefit (indeed it was 
associated with increases in mortality), the same was 
not the case for RN staffing. The relationship between 
RN staffing hours and mortality appeared to be linear. 
This is in itself a surprising finding. While many previous 
studies have reported a linear coefficient, few have 
directly explored whether the relationship was, in fact, 
linear, although a meta-analysis of North American 
studies found a curvilinear relationship between staffing 
and outcomes.23 In that study, the incremental benefits 
of adding more staff reduced at higher staffing levels. 
Although our findings cannot be directly compared 
with hospital-level studies, which provide hospital-wide 
averages, nurse staffing levels in English hospitals are 
generally lower than those found in many other Euro-
pean countries and the USA, and typical patient to nurse 
ratios are higher than agreed or mandatory levels in 
other countries.2 5 24 Consequently, it may be that RN 
staffing in our study hospital does not reach levels at 
which incremental benefits diminish.
The average overall staffing (nursing assistant+RN 
hours) in this study, approximately 7.75 hours per patient 
per day, is typical of NHS general hospitals, although it 
falls at the lower end of those reported in the Carter 
Review of productivity in the NHS (where the range was 
from 6.3 to 15.48).3 An additional RN hour per patient 
day would represent a staffing uplift of 13%, equiva-
lent to one additional RN per shift on a 24-bed ward 
(excluding any shift overlaps). Patients experiencing the 
median length of stay would have a cumulative increase 
of 2.7 nursing hours, associated with a reduction in the 
hazard of death of 8%.
Patient turnover has been identified as an important 
influence on nurse staffing requirements in previous 
research. Needleman and colleagues9 found that patients 
exposed to shifts with high turnover experienced a 7% 
increase in the hazard of death.9 Our findings suggest 
that the association is specific to RN staffing, although 
our threshold (above 125% of the mean) was not 
subjected to sensitivity testing. As the work of assessing 
and planning care for new patients is an RN responsi-
bility, the additional workload is likely to fall primarily 
on them. While we did not consider discharges directly, 
these are likely to be highly correlated with admissions 
in the face of high bed occupancy. Again, preparation for 
discharge is likely to generate significant additional work 
for RNs. Workload and productivity measures that focus 
solely on patient numbers may significantly underesti-
mate the registered nursing workload, particularly if the 
length of stay shortens and patient turnover increases. 
The significance of patient turnover as a workload vari-
able in addition to patient census and acuity/dependency 
merits more attention in future research.
The findings of this paper suggest potential bene-
fits from increasing the availability of RNs on acute 
hospital wards. However, in England, RN shortages 
look set to continue in the short term. These findings 
show the importance of a policy response in order to 
rectify the shortage and to retain existing RNs within 
the workforce. Health Education England, which has a 
responsibility for workforce planning and training staff 
for the NHS, has recently announced plans to increase 
RN training posts and has shown a renewed interest 
in programmes that could improve retention of nurses 
such as Magnet accreditation.25 26 These findings indi-
cate that RN shortages are unlikely to be remedied by 
increasing the numbers of lesser trained nursing staff in 
the workforce.
strengths and limitations of this study
While our study was able to overcome many limitations 
of previous research, it remains observational. Causal 
inference does not follow directly from the observed 
associations, although the longitudinal design with 
staffing exposures measured at a patient level eliminates 
many plausible alternative explanations making a causal 
interpretation much more likely.27 Additionally, there is 
a growing body of evidence supporting a causal mech-
anism: linking low nurse staffing to increased mortality 
through a reduced capacity to observe and intervene to 
prevent deterioration.28 29
Our study has a number of strengths. Although our 
study was in a single site, this does mean that our find-
ings are not the result of a ‘hospital effect’, whereby 
the observed associations between nurse staffing and 
outcomes could arise because hospitals with more 
resources in general also have more nurses.27 It is the 
first study to consider the longitudinal relationship with

RN and nursing assistant staffing independently. We 
have assessed the staffing levels experienced by indi-
vidual patients and shown that exposure to low staffing 
precedes increased risk of death. The use of survival 
analysis means that we have considered time to event, 
but our data are censored at the point of discharge and 
our analysis assumes that those discharged early have the 
same risk as those discharged late. It is possible that the 
large proportion of patients with no comorbidities in 
our sample is a result of undercoding, but the distribu-
tion of recorded comorbidities resembles the sample on 
which the SHMI risk model was validated.11 In addition 
to the SHMI risk score, our models included a measure 
of acuity as a covariate, which is also a good predictor 
of mortality risk, and so we are confident that we have 
accounted for patient-level risk factors as far as possible.
Results based on hours relative to the mean measure 
are not subject to bias arising from patients with longer 
stays experiencing more low staffing. Our measure of 
staffing is determined relative to the average for each 
ward rather than an absolute measure, and so it accounts 
for different requirements for care in different wards. In 
simple terms this means that our analysis reflects associ-
ation between mortality and variation in nurse staffing 
within each ward, rather than between wards. While 
average ward staffing levels corresponded closely with 
the measured staffing requirements, any effect from 
variation in average staffing levels between wards is 
not reflected in these analyses. Nonetheless, we cannot 
exclude all possible sources of endogeneity.7
conclusIon
These findings show the potential consequences of short-
ages of RNs in terms of the negative impact on patient 
safety. While nursing care assistants also have an impor-
tant part to play in maintaining the safety of hospital 
wards, they cannot act as substitutes for RNs. When 
assessing staffing requirements or making compari-
sons, RN and assistant hours should not be treated as 
equivalent. Strategies to improve the supply of RNs are 
required. The adverse consequences of RN shortages are 
unlikely to be remedied by increasing the numbers of 
lesser trained nursing staff in the workforce.
