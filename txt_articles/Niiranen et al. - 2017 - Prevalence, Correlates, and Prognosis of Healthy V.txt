U
ntil some decades ago, the rule-of-thumb definition of 
normal systolic blood pressure was 100 plus your age. 
However, this cutoff has not been acceptable after antihy-
pertensive treatment was unequivocally shown to reduce 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in also elderly hyper-
tensive patients.1–3 Although hypertension at old age is no 
longer considered harmless, it is still highly prevalent. In 
middle-aged and elderly nonhypertensive individuals, the 
residual lifetime risk for hypertension was estimated to be 
90%.4 Age-related increases in arterial stiffness and blood 
pressure are thereby widely accepted as an inevitable part 
of the aging process in acculturated societies, further exem-
plified by the widespread use of the term essential hyperten-
sion. However, age-associated increase in blood pressure 
is not common in some populations leading traditional 
hunter-gatherer lifestyles (although these data are limited 
by modest sample sizes).5–10
An individual’s vascular age can be crudely approximated 
from systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, but arterial 
wall imaging or measurement of arterial stiffness can be used 
to obtain additional complementary information. Aortic pulse 
wave velocity (PWV), for example, is a commonly used surro-
gate marker of arterial stiffness that is strongly related to CVD 
morbidity and may be considered a physiological method for 
quantifying arterial aging.11–14
The prevalence, correlates, and prognosis of healthy vas-
cular aging (HVA; ie, lack of age-related increases in arte-
rial stiffness and blood pressure) in a contemporary Western 
cohort are incompletely understood. The aims of our study 
were 3-fold: (1) to operationalize the concept of HVA using

Abstract—Hypertension and increased vascular stiffness are viewed as inevitable parts of aging. To elucidate whether 
the age-related decrease in vascular function is avoidable, we assessed the prevalence, correlates, and prognosis of 
healthy vascular aging (HVA) in 3196 Framingham Study participants aged ≥50 years. We defined HVA as absence 
of hypertension and pulse wave velocity <7.6 m/s (mean+2 SD of a reference sample aged <30 years). Overall, 566 
(17.7%) individuals had HVA, with prevalence decreasing from 30.3% in people aged 50 to 59 to 1% in those aged ≥70 
years. In regression models adjusted for physical activity, caloric intake, and traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk factors, we observed that lower age, female sex, lower body mass index, use of lipid-lowering drugs, and absence 
of diabetes mellitus were cross-sectionally associated with HVA (P<0.001 for all). A unit increase in a cardiovascular 
health score (Life’s Simple 7) was associated with 1.55-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.38–1.74) age- and sex-adjusted 
odds of HVA. During a follow-up of 9.6 years, 391 CVD events occurred. In Cox regression models adjusted for 
traditional CVD risk factors, including blood pressure, HVA was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.26–0.77) for CVD relative to absence of HVA. Although HVA is achievable in individuals acculturated to 
a Western lifestyle, maintaining normal vascular function beyond 70 years of age is challenging. Although our data 
are observational, our findings support prevention strategies targeting modifiable factors and behaviors and obesity, in 
particular, to prevent or delay vascular aging and the associated risk of CVD.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:267-274. DOI:

2 easily measured vascular traits, (2) to assess the prevalence 
and correlates of HVA in a cohort acculturated to a Western 
lifestyle, and (3) to evaluate the magnitude of CVD risk asso-
ciated with unhealthy versus HVA.
Methods
Participants
Because age-related arterial stiffening is absent in certain populations, 
we submit that the definition of normal vascular function should be 
the same in all age groups.5–9 To capture a distinct sample of individu-
als who have experienced HVA, we considered only participants in 
late middle age or older (aged ≥50 years) who attended examination 7 
(1998–2001) or 8 (2005–2008) of the Offspring cohort (n=3371) and 
examination 1 of the Third-Generation (n=606; 2002–2005) cohort 
of the Framingham Heart Study (Figure S1 in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Offspring cohort participants were primarily drawn 
from examination cycle 7, or alternatively from examination 8 if data 
from examination 7 were missing. We excluded participants with prev-
alent CVD (see Cardiovascular Outcomes section for detailed descrip-
tion), missing tonometry data, or missing covariates (Figure S1 in the 
online-only Data Supplement). To examine the association between 
American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 score and HVA, we 
identified a subset of 2086 Offspring cohort participants (of 3197 
included in the main analyses) who had data available for all compo-
nents of the score. Boston University Medical Center’s Institutional 
Review Board approved all study protocols, and participants provided 
written informed consent. The characteristics and study protocols of 
the 2 cohorts have been previously published in detail.15,16
Baseline Evaluation
At baseline, all participants provided a medical history and underwent 
a cardiovascular targeted physical examination and laboratory assess-
ment of CVD risk factors.15 We assessed the participants for cigarette 
smoking and diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose level of ≥7 mmol/L 
or the use of hypoglycemic medications). In addition, we measured 
blood pressure (mean of 2 auscultatory values obtained by a phy-
sician using a mercury column sphygmomanometer on the left arm 
of seated participants), PWV, body mass index (BMI), serum total 
cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. 
We defined blood pressure as the mean of 2 readings. Participants 
underwent assessments of physical activity, using a questionnaire and 
calculation of the Framingham physical activity index, and assess-
ments of diet, using data collected via the Harvard semiquantitative 
food frequency questionnaire.17,18
Measurements for Arterial Stiffness and Definition 
of HVA
We evaluated arterial stiffness with carotid–femoral PWV.19 PWV is 
directly related to aortic wall stiffness. We performed arterial tonom-
etry as previously described after ≥5 minutes of rest in the supine 
position.20,21 All measurements were performed on the right side of 
the body. Arterial tonometry with concurrent ECG was obtained for 
the femoral and carotid arteries. We estimated the pulse wave tran-
sit distances by measuring the direct surface distance between the 
suprasternal notch and the carotid or femoral sites. We accounted for 
parallel transmission along the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries 
and around the aortic arch by taking the difference in distances from 
suprasternal notch to femoral and carotid sites. The methodology for 
PWV measurement remained the same during all study cycles. PWV 
was defined as the corrected distance divided by the carotid–femoral 
transit time delay. We inverted PWV to reduce heteroscedasticity and 
multiplied it by −1 to restore direction of effect.
We defined HVA for individuals ≥50 years as having both of the 
following:
1. Nonhypertensive blood pressure, which constituted <140 
mm Hg for systolic and <90 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure 
and absence of hypertensive treatment.
2. PWV of <7.6 m/s, which was equivalent to the mean+2 SD val-
ue obtained from a reference sample of individuals who were 
aged <30 years, with optimal or normal blood pressures and no 
additional CVD risk factors.22
Cardiovascular Health Score
For each participant, we calculated a cardiovascular health score 
by recoding 7 modifiable risk factors as dichotomous variables 
according to the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 
score—a metric that is used to measure and promote healthy life-
style behaviours.23 The 7 components of the cardiovascular health 
score are fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, 
BMI, self-reported smoking status, dietary quality, and physical 
activity (Table S1). We modified the score by excluding blood pres-
sure because it is a part of the outcome variable in this study. Each 
component of the cardiovascular health was allocated a score of 
1 indicating the American Heart Association’s ideal category for 
that metric (versus 0 for nonideal metric); thus, the cardiovascu-
lar health score could vary from a minimum of 0 (indicating poor 
cardiovascular health) to a maximum of 6 (reflecting ideal cardio-
vascular health).
Cardiovascular Outcomes
We used 2 composite CVD end points in our study: hard CVD events 
and CVD events. Hard CVD was a composite end point of cardio-
vascular death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. 
CVD was a composite end point of angina pectoris, unstable angina 
(prolonged ischemic episode with documented reversible ST-segment 
changes), transient ischemic attack, heart failure, intermittent claudi-
cation, and all end points included in hard CVD. We obtained medical 
records for all hospitalizations and physician visits related to CVD 
during follow-up, which were reviewed by an adjudication panel con-
sisting of 3 investigators. Criteria for these CVD events have been 
described previously.24
Statistical Methods
We assessed baseline characteristics according to HVA status, over-
all, and by sex. We compared prevalence of HVA among age groups 
using the χ2 test.
We examined cross-sectional correlates of HVA using multivari-
able stepwise logistic regression with backward selection, retain-
ing covariates with P<0.10. In addition to cohort (Offspring versus 
Third Generation), we derived the other covariates for the logistic 
regression models from the Framingham 10-year CVD risk score 
(ie, age, sex, cohort, BMI, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, serum 
total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). We in-
cluded total caloric intake and the Framingham Physical Activity 
Index in a separate model (2671 participants had those data). We 
standardized continuous variables and tested for statistical interac-
tions with age (using median age) and sex interactions by entering 
corresponding cross-product terms into the models. We also per-
formed a sensitivity analysis in 3111 individuals with data avail-
able using a 3-category variable to define hyperglycemia: normal 
glycemia (plasma fasting glucose <5.6 mmol/L), impaired fasting 
glucose (plasma fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L), and diabetes 
mellitus (plasma fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L or use of hypoglycemic 
medications). To characterize individuals with HVA in more detail 
beyond traditional risk factors, we determined serum high-sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance index, 
urine albumin:creatinine ratio levels, and a genetic risk score for 
coronary artery disease in 1418 to 3190 individuals with such data 
available. We used generalized linear models to compare age- and 
sex-adjusted means of genetic, inflammatory, renal, and metabolic 
biomarker levels between individuals with and without HVA. The 
methods for determining these biomarkers are described in more 
detail in the Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement. 
Next, we calculated age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for 
HVA comparing participants who had health scores of 2 through 6 
to those with scores of 0 to 1.

We examined associations between HVA and CVD outcomes 
using proportional hazards regression (Cox) models: plotting 
age-, sex-, and cohort-adjusted cumulative incidence functions25 
and also fitting multivariable-adjusted models. We performed a 
sensitivity analysis for risk of CVD outcomes using 3 alterna-
tive definitions for HVA: (1) blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and 
PWV <8.1 m/s (corresponding to the 95th percentile for PWV in 
a healthy Framingham Heart Study reference sample <50 years of 
age),26 (2) blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg and PWV <7.6 m/s, and 
(3) blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and absence of coronary artery 
calcification (Agatston score 0). The latter analysis was performed 
in a subgroup of 1332 participants who underwent coronary artery 
calcium scoring, as previously described.27 All analyses were per-
formed with SAS software, version 9.4 (Cary, NC). We considered 
a 2-sided P<0.05 to be statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of the sample (n=3196; mean age, 62±9 
years; 56% women) according to HVA status are presented 
in Table 1. The characteristics of the included and excluded 
participants are shown in Table S2. Of the 490 people who 
were excluded because of prevalent CVD, only 14 (2.9%) 
were nonhypertensive and had a PWV <7.6 m/s. Among 
participants, 566 (17.7%) had HVA. Men and women with 
HVA had more favorable CVD risk profiles than others 
(Table 1). Prevalence of HVA decreased from 30.3% in peo-
ple aged 50 to 59 to 1% in those aged ≥70 years (Figure 1; 
P<0.001).
In backward selection logistic regression modeling 
(Table 2), we observed that younger age, female sex, lower 
BMI, use of lipid-lowering drugs, and absence of diabetes 
mellitus (P<0.001 for all) were cross-sectionally associ-
ated with HVA. Current smoking, serum total cholesterol, 
and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not 
retained. No statistically significant interactions were 
observed between age or sex and any of the significant cor-
relates of HVA in the multivariable model (P≥0.27 for all). 
In a subsample of 2671 participants with data available, we 
also included physical activity index and total caloric intake 
in the model for HVA. Neither variable reached statistical 
significance (P≥0.10 for both). In a sensitivity analysis using 
a 3-category variable for hyperglycemia, impaired fasting 
glucose (OR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50–0.81; 
P=0.03) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03–
0.32; P<0.001) were associated with lower odds of HVA 
compared with normal glycemia. The age- and sex-adjusted 
mean genetic, inflammatory, renal, and metabolic biomarker 
levels according to HVA status are presented in Table S3. We 
observed that individuals with HVA had lower interleukin-6, 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and homeostatic model 
assessment insulin resistance index levels than participants 
with no HVA. No between-group differences were observed 
in renal function or in the genetic risk score for coronary 
artery disease.
The ORs for HVA according to the cardiovascular health 
score in 2086 participants (mean age, 63.2±8.3; 57.1% 
women) of the Offspring cohort are shown in Table 3.

OR for HVA was significantly increased in participants who 
achieved 3 goals (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.67–5.79). Participants 
who achieved 6 goals had 10.23-fold (95% CI, 3.85–27.16) 
odds of HVA. A 1-unit increase in the cardiovascular health 
score corresponded to 1.55-fold (95% CI, 1.38–1.74) odds 
of HVA.
During follow-up (median, 9.6 years), 391 developed 
CVD, which included 207 hard CVD events. The direct-
adjusted plots for incidence of CVD and hard CVD are 
shown in Figure 2. Individuals with HVA had consider-
ably lower age- and sex-adjusted risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 
0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.57) and hard CVD (hazard ratio, 0.31; 
95% CI, 0.15–0.64) in relation to individuals without HVA 
(Table 4). After adjusting for other traditional CVD risk fac-
tors, including systolic blood pressure, HVA was associated 
with a 0.45-fold (95% CI, 0.26–0.77) risk of CVD events and 
a 0.46-fold risk (95% CI, 0.22–0.96) of hard CVD events. No 
statistically significant interactions were observed between 
age or sex and HVA in the multivariable model (P≥0.34 
for all). We also performed 3 separate sensitivity analyses, 
in which HVA was defined as (1) blood pressure <140/90 
mm Hg and PWV <8.1 m/s, (2) blood pressure <120/80 
mm Hg and PWV <7.6 m/s, or (3) blood pressure <140/90 
mm Hg and coronary artery calcium score of 0 (Table S4). In 
these sensitivity analyses, the multivariable-adjusted asso-
ciations between HVA and CVD outcomes were statistically 
nonsignificant, except for the relationship between HVA 
defined as blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg and PWV <7.6 
m/s and CVD.
Discussion
In the present investigation, we operationalize the theo-
retical construct of HVA using blood pressure and PWV. 
Although modest improvements in risk discrimination may 
be achieved using multivariable risk scores to define HVA 
(incorporating additional measures of vascular aging), we 
opted to use these 2 easily obtained metrics of vascular health 
for simplicity of interpretation of results. We observed that 
every sixth person aged ≥50 years had experienced HVA, 
defined as absence of hypertension and carotid–femoral 
PWV <7.6 m/s. However, HVA was virtually nonexistent 
in people aged ≥70 years. Modifiable risk factors included 
in American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 score, 
and particularly low BMI, having no diabetes mellitus and 
hypercholesterolemia (lipid-lowering therapy and border-
line significance for serum total cholesterol), were associ-
ated with HVA. Individuals with HVA had a markedly lower 
risk of CVD events, even after accounting for traditional 
CVD risk factors.
The concept of HVA may not have received notable 
attention previously because of the strong correlation 
between age and arterial stiffness.19,28 A large part of recent 
research on vascular aging has, therefore, focused on early 
vascular aging, an even more rapid course of vascular aging 
that results in premature CVD manifestations.28 However, 
both past and more contemporary research suggest that vas-
cular aging, just as isolated systolic hypertension, should no 
longer be considered a part of normal aging. Studies per-
formed on hunter-gatherers have demonstrated the low rates

of age-related increases in blood pressure,5–10 PWV,7 and 
CVD6 in these populations. Although some of these stud-
ies included few individuals aged >50 years,10 their results 
also showed that blood pressure levels and arterial stiffness 
in these populations increased with the level of Western 
acculturation and urbanization.6,7,9 These interesting find-
ings seem to be mainly driven by environmental, instead of 
genetic, factors because blood pressure levels and arterial 
stiffness in these populations were shown to increase with 
the level of Western acculturation and urbanization.6,7,9 Our 
findings on the statistically nonsignificant differences in the 
genetic coronary artery disease risk scores also are consis-
tent with this premise. More contemporary results from the 
Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) also 
imply that an individual’s blood pressure should remain 
optimal even after middle age. In the SPRINT trial with a 
study population of hypertensive patients without diabetes 
mellitus aged ≥50 years, targeting a systolic blood pressure 
<120 mm Hg, as compared with <140 mm Hg, resulted in 
lower rates of major cardiovascular events and death from 
any cause. The SPRINT results were also similar in sub-
groups by age (<75 and ≥75 years), suggesting that lower 
is better applies to blood pressure values in all age groups 
and to treated and untreated individuals without diabe-
tes mellitus. HVA should, therefore, be considered a uni-
versal goal. Our results demonstrate that HVA, defined as 
nonhypertension and PWV <7.6 m/s at ≥50 years of age, is 
achievable and provides an effective method to distinguish 
between individuals with low versus high cardiovascular 
risk. However, maintaining a youthful vascular function 
beyond age 70 is extremely challenging, which underscores 
the need for lifelong prevention of arterial stiffening.
Our results demonstrate that maintaining a lifestyle 
and a cardiovascular risk profile that are in accord with the 
Life’s Simple 7 health factors are important for preventing 
arterial aging.23 Besides nonmodifiable risk factors, obesity 
and diabetes mellitus were the strongest correlates of HVA 
in our study. We also observed lower levels of inflammatory 
biomarkers and homeostatic model assessment insulin resis-
tance index in individuals with HVA. Our findings, there-
fore, are consistent with the notion that insulin resistance 
and chronic low-grade inflammation, both closely related to 
obesity and diabetes mellitus, could be potential contribu-
tors to vascular aging.29 Somewhat surprisingly, we did not 
observe an independent association between some cardio-
vascular risk factors, such as smoking, diet, and exercise, 
and HVA. In addition to lack of statistical power and small 
effect sizes, these findings may be also explained by the 
mediating effects of BMI on the relations of diet or exercise 
and HVA. Furthermore, the association between smoking 
and vascular function is not straightforward as paradoxi-
cally lower rates of hypertension and decreased arterial 
stiffness have been observed among smokers in some epide-
miologic studies.30,31 Although smoking, diet, and exercise 
may not be equally strong correlates of HVA as obesity, dia-
betes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia, our results showed 
a gradual stepwise increase in the odds of HVA across the 
whole range of Life’s Simple 7 score. Our results are, there-
fore, suggestive that controlling all the modifiable factors 
included in Life’s Simple 7 is important for achieving HVA.

Specifically, our results should not be interpreted to indi-
cate that smoking, diet, or physical activity are not related 
to vascular aging. We have previously reported that physi-
cal activity (measured by accelerometry) is associated with 
lower vascular stiffness.32
In a previous study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis researchers examined a group of 165 indi-
viduals who had survived to ≥70 years of age, free of clini-
cal CVD and also had limited subclinical vascular disease 
by a combination index of 3 separate parameters (coronary 
artery calcium <25th percentile, carotid intima–media thick-
ness <25th percentile, and ankle–brachial index >0.9).33 In 
accordance with our results, the authors found that younger 
age, female sex, and lower BMI were most strongly (P<0.001) 
associated with the combination index. In addition to these 
3 factors, diabetes mellitus also seems to markedly decrease 
the odds of HVA—individuals with diabetes mellitus had 
>8-fold lower odds of HVA than nondiabetics in our study. 
Considering that >80% of people with type 2 diabetes mel-
litus are also obese, our results highlight the importance of 
maintaining normal body weight in preventing cardiovascular 
aging.34 Despite the marked reductions in the prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking and hypercholes-
terolemia in developed countries, there has been little success 
in preventing obesity—the most important risk factor for dia-
betes mellitus.35,36 During the past 30 years, age-standardized 
mean global BMI has increased from 22 to 24 kg/m2, which 
conjointly with population growth and aging, has led to a near 
quadrupling of the number of adults with diabetes mellitus 
worldwide.37,38 The impact of the global obesity epidemic is 
also reflected by recent plateauing of hypertension prevalence 
rates in the United States.39 Healthy vascular aging will, there-
fore, likely remain infrequent unless adverse trends in popula-
tion nutrition and BMI occur.40
We observed a 3-fold lower age- and sex-adjusted risk and 
a >2-fold lower multivariable-adjusted risk of CVD in people 
with HVA relative to absence of HVA. Because the final model 
(Model 3 in Table 4) also included systolic blood pressure as 
a covariate, these results mainly reflect the poor CVD progno-
sis associated with arterial stiffening.12,19 Although these esti-
mates are not robust enough for HVA to be used as a screening 
method, they still emphasize the importance of vascular stiff-
ening and arterial aging in the pathogenesis of CVD. In sensi-
tivity analyses, we examined the association between HVA and 
CVD outcomes using 3 alternate definitions of HVA. Using a 
definition of blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg and a higher PWV 
threshold of <8.1 m/s, the risk estimates of CVD related to HVA 
were statistically nonsignificant, possibly reflecting lesser sta-
tistical power because of few events in the group with HVA; 
of note, point estimates for HVA in these analyses were all <1 
and the P values were borderline statistical significant (<0.10). 
With the other 2 alternate definitions of HVA (a blood pressure 
threshold of 120/80 mm Hg instead of 140/90 mm Hg or coro-
nary calcium scoring instead of PWV), the risk estimates were, 
although mainly nonsignificant, comparable to those observed 
in the primary analyses. However, because of the low number 
of CVD events among individuals with HVA, we lack statis-
tical power to make any definite conclusions regarding these 
sensitivity analyses. In spite the fact that arterial stiffening, and 
the increased CVD risk associated with it, can be detected with 
relative ease, treating it remains a considerable challenge for 
physicians. Lifestyle factors and certain antihypertensive drugs 
have been shown to reduce arterial stiffness mainly through 
lowering blood pressure, but there are currently no drugs that 
specifically target arterial stiffening.41,42 The most promising 
drug candidates in this area are NO donors, drugs interfering 
with the arterial extracellular matrix, selective angiotensin type 
2 receptor agonists, and agents reducing arterial calcification, 
but clinical data are still pending.41–43 However, given the nota-
ble CVD risk associated with arterial stiffening, the clinical 
need for destiffening therapies remains significant.
Our study has certain limitations. First, our study sam-
ple consisted of predominantly white individuals, and our 
results may not be generalizable to the other races/ethnici-
ties. This is a major limitation of our investigation given the 
known racial disparities in hypertension and hypertension-
related outcomes.44 Second, data on nutrition and physical 
exercise were not available for all individuals. Third, vali-
dated self-report questionnaires may not be the most accu-
rate methods for assessing food intake and physical activity, 
despite being the most commonly used methods in epidemi-
ologic settings. Fourth, we excluded from the present analy-
ses individuals who died before reaching 50 years of age 
and had prevalent CVD. Nearly all individuals who were 
excluded because of prevalent CVD had unhealthy vascular 
aging. We, therefore, studied HVA in the context of fairly 
healthy aging (ie, absence of clinical disease). Fifth, some 
of the analyses in our study are cross-sectional (precluding 
any causal inferences) and raising the additional possibility 
of reverse causation between HVA and some of the expo-
sure variables (such as lower ability to exercise in individu-
als with arterial stiffening).
Perspectives
One in 6 individuals experienced HVA in our sample ≥50 years 
of age. Although HVA is achievable in individuals acculturated 
to a Western lifestyle, our results demonstrate that maintain-
ing normal vascular function beyond age 70 is extremely chal-
lenging. Our data, which are observational, thereby precluding 
causal inferences, are consistent with the notion that prevention 
strategies targeting modifiable factors and behaviors included 
in Life’s Simple 7, and obesity, in particular, may prevent or 
delay vascular aging and the associated risk of CVD.

What Is New?
• Although hypertension and increased vascular stiffness are seen as in-
evitable parts of the aging process in acculturated societies, these traits 
are not common in hunter-gatherer populations (although prior studies 
are limited by the small number of individuals >50 years of age who 
were studied).
• To elucidate whether the age-related decrease in vascular function 
is unavoidable, we assessed the prevalence, correlates, and progno-
sis of healthy vascular aging (HVA) in a Western community-dwelling 
cohort.
What Is Relevant?
• The prevalence of HVA, defined as absence of hypertension and pulse 
wave velocity <7.6 m/s, decreased from 30% in people aged 50 to 59 to 
1% in those aged ≥70 years.
• Lower body mass index, absence of diabetes mellitus, and a higher 
American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 score were the strongest 
modifiable correlates of HVA.
• HVA was associated with a 55% lower multivariable-adjusted risk for 
cardiovascular disease relative to absence of HVA.
Summary
Although HVA is achievable in individuals acculturated to a Western 
lifestyle, our results demonstrate that maintaining normal vascular 
function beyond age 70 is extremely challenging. Our observational 
data are consistent with the notion that prevention strategies tar-
geting modifiable factors and behaviors included in Life’s Simple 7, 
and obesity, in particular, may prevent or delay vascular aging and 
the associated risk of cardiovascular disease.
