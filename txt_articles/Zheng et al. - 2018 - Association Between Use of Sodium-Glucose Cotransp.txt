IMPORTANCE The comparative clinical efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2)
inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)
inhibitors for treatment of type 2 diabetes is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacies of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and DPP-4
inhibitors on mortality and cardiovascular end points using network meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials,
and published meta-analyses from inception through October 11, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials enrolling participants with type 2 diabetes and
a follow-up of at least 12 weeks were included, for which SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists,
and DPP-4 inhibitors were compared with either each other or placebo or no treatment.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were screened by 1 investigator and extracted in
duplicate by 2 investigators. A Bayesian hierarchical network meta-analysis was performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome: all-cause mortality; secondary
outcomes: cardiovascular (CV) mortality, heart failure (HF) events, myocardial infarction (MI),
unstable angina, and stroke; safety end points: adverse events and hypoglycemia.
RESULTS This network meta-analysis of 236 trials randomizing 176 310 participants found
SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute risk difference [RD], −1.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% credible
interval {CrI}, 0.71 to 0.89]) and GLP-1 agonists (absolute RD, −0.6%; HR, 0.88 [95% CrI, 0.81
to 0.94]) were associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality than the control groups.
SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, −0.9%; HR, 0.78 [95% CrI, 0.68 to 0.90]) and GLP-1 agonists
(absolute RD, −0.5%; HR, 0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.96]) were associated with lower mortality
than were DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors were not significantly associated with lower
all-cause mortality (absolute RD, 0.1%; HR, 1.02 [95% CrI, 0.94 to 1.11]) than were the control
groups. SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, −0.8%; HR, 0.79 [95% CrI, 0.69 to 0.91]) and GLP-1
agonists (absolute RD, −0.5%; HR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.94]) were significantly associated
with lower CV mortality than were the control groups. SGLT-2 inhibitors were significantly
associated with lower rates of HF events (absolute RD, −1.1%; HR, 0.62 [95% CrI, 0.54 to
0.72]) and MI (absolute RD, −0.6%; HR, 0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.97]) than were the control
groups. GLP-1 agonists were associated with a higher risk of adverse events leading to trial
withdrawal than were SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, 5.8%; HR, 1.80 [95% CrI, 1.44 to 2.25])
and DPP-4 inhibitors (absolute RD, 3.1%; HR, 1.93 [95% CrI, 1.59 to 2.35]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or
GLP-1 agonists was associated with lower mortality than DPP-4 inhibitors or placebo or no
treatment. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors was not associated with lower mortality than placebo or
no treatment.

 T
he global type 2 diabetes epidemic is increas-
ing.1 Although there have been improvements in
long-term outcomes, the excess mortality and cardio-
vascular morbidity remain a considerable challenge
for health care systems.2 Several drug classes have emerged
that are efficacious in im-
proving glycemic control.
These include the incretin-
based therapies: dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibi-
tors and glucagon-like pep-
tide 1 (GLP-1) agonists,3 and
sodium-glucose cotrans-
porter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.
International guidelines rec-
ommend escalation to either
SGLT-2 inhibitors or incretin-
based treatments in people
with type 2 diabetes not achieving target glycemic con-
trol with metformin.4,5
The comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of the 3
classes of glucose-lowering agents have not been explored,
leading to clinical uncertainty about the optimal treatment
pathway and a potential negative cost effect. Similarly, no
cardiovascular outcome trials have directly compared the
efficacy of these classes. When no head-to-head trial exists,
network meta-analysis can be used to estimate the effect.
The purpose of this network meta-analysis was to com-
pare the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and
GLP-1 agonists in reducing mortality and cardiovascular out-
comes in participants with type 2 diabetes and their relative
safety profiles.
Methods
This article has been reported in accordance with the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA-NMA).6 The study protocol is available in
Supplement 1.
Data Sources
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was per-
formed from database inception through to October 11, 2017
(eMethods 1 in Supplement 2). The reference lists of included
studies were searched for additional studies. Systematic
reviews were identified and hand-screened for additional
trials (Figure 1).
After removal of duplicates, the title and abstracts of
search results were screened for relevance by a single au-
thor (S.L.Z. or A.J.R.). The full texts of remaining results
were independently assessed in duplicate by 2 authors
(S.L.Z. and A.J.R.) for inclusion based on predetermined cri-
teria. The final list of included studies was decided on dis-
cussion between authors with full agreement required prior
to inclusion. No disagreements required resolution by a
third reviewer.
Study Selection
Trials were considered eligible if they (1) were a randomized
clinical trial; (2) enrolled participants with type 2 diabetes
mellitus; (3) compared SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists,
and DPP-4 inhibitors at market-approved doses with each
other or with a control group (defined as placebo or no treat-
ment) (eMethods 2 in Supplement 2); (4) had a follow-up of
at least 12 weeks; (5) provided information on any of the
prespecified primary, secondary, and safety end points; and
(6) were published in the English language.
Data Extraction
Data were extracted using piloted forms, independently
and in duplicate by 2 authors (S.L.Z. and A.J.R.), and were
transcribed onto a dedicated database. The data extracted
from each report included baseline participant characteris-
tics, inclusion criteria, study drug and control treatments,
follow-up duration, and end point data. Study status as
a cardiovascular outcome trial was also recorded, defined by
the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory approval
process as a phase 3 trial used to determine cardiovascular
safety. For studies registered to ClinicalTrials.gov, the entry
was searched for additional clinical events. For trials with
open-label extension periods, only data from the randomized
controlled periods were used.
Risk of bias assessment was conducted by 2 authors in
duplicate (S.L.Z. and A.J.R.) using the Cochrane Collaboration
risk of bias tool across 5 domains (sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding, detection bias, and attri-
tion bias). The Egger test was used to identify asymmetry of
funnel plots for publication bias.7
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary
outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure
events, myocardial infarction (MI) (all and nonfatal), unstable
angina, and stroke (all and nonfatal). Safety end points were
adverse events (any, serious, and leading to study with-
drawal), and hypoglycemia (minor and major) (eMethods 3 in
Supplement 2). A composite cardiovascular outcome consist-
ing of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal

Key Points
Question How do sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2)
inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, and dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors compare in reducing mortality and
cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes?
Findings In this network meta-analysis that includes 236 trials
with 176 310 participants, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1
agonists was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality
compared with the control groups (placebo or no treatment)
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.80, and HR, 0.88, respectively) and with
DPP-4 inhibitors (HR, 0.78, and HR, 0.86, respectively).
Meaning In patients with type 2 diabetes, the use of SGLT-2
inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists was associated with better mortality
outcomes than DPP-4 inhibitors.

 stroke was extracted and analyzed for the cardiovascular out-
come trials alone.
Additional drug class–specific safety end points for
SGLT-2 inhibitors were lower-limb amputation, urinary tract
infection, and genital infection, for GLP-1 agonists were
acute pancreatitis, and retinopathy, and for DPP-4 inhibitors
was acute pancreatitis.
Data Synthesis
Network meta-analysis comprises direct and indirect com-
parisons between multiple interventions, allowing compari-
sons to be made when direct trial evidence is scarce. This ap-
proach respects randomization but does not represent
randomized evidence.
A Bayesian hierarchical network meta-analysis was per-
formed using the GeMTC package on R (version 3.4.1)8
(eMethods 4 in Supplement 2). Fixed- or random-effects
models were selected for each outcome based on the devi-
ance information criterion (DIC), using the model with the
smallest value (eTable 1). Analyses were performed using
Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. Results were presented
as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs).
For studies that reported event counts only, differences in
follow-up duration between studies were incorporated using
the trial patient-years follow-up to estimate HRs using the
Poisson likelihood and log link. Transitivity assumes similar-
ity between sets of trials with respect to important effect
modifiers. This was assessed by constructing summary tables

 organized by pair-wise comparisons to qualitatively assess
baseline clinical similarity of trial populations. Between-
study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.9 The
probability that each treatment class ranked in a given posi-
tion from best to worst was estimated and presented in rank-
ing plots. Network consistency was analyzed by calculating
the ratio of direct and indirect treatment effects within each
comparison with 95% CrIs.10
In addition to the primary analysis, a network meta-
analysis of studies by individual drug type was performed for
the primary outcome. A further network meta-analysis of pri-
maryandsecondaryoutcomeswasundertakenusingdatafrom
cardiovascular outcome trials, with composite cardiovascu-
lar end points included as an outcome.
Absolute risk differences (RDs) and 95% CrIs were calcu-
lated by multiplying the HRs and 95% CrIs generated from
meta-analysis to the risk of events in the comparison group.
Negative values indicate a reduction in events with treat-
ment, and positive values indicate an increase in events.
A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis was
also performed using the NetMeta package on R.11 Results are
presented as relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. Two-tailed
P values of .05 were used for statistical significance. The
P-score statistic was used to assess the mean probability of
superiority of each drug class to alternative treatments for a
given outcome. For additional drug class–specific adverse
events, data from cardiovascular outcome trials were pooled
using frequentist pair-wise meta-analysis. The model that
was used was determined by the degree of heterogeneity,
with random effects favored in the presence of heterogeneity
(I2 >30%). The sensitivity analysis that was performed was
restricted to study participant type (excluding postacute
coronary syndrome and low–cardiovascular risk trials), trial
duration (excluding trials with <12 months of follow-up), and
risk of bias (restricted to studies with low risk of bias across
all domains). All data were represented graphically with net-
work and forest plots using RStudio and Microsoft Excel.
Changes to the study protocol are reported in eMethods 5 in
Supplement 2.

Study Search and Study Characteristics
Systematic searching through October 11, 2017, identified
16 725 articles, of which 236 articles comprising 258 drug-
class comparisons were included for the network meta-
analysis (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In total, 176 310 participants
were enrolled, comprising 310 166 participant-years (Table
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). For direct comparisons,
14 trials compared a GLP-1 agonist with a DPP-4 inhibitor, 8
trials compared an SGLT-2 inhibitor with a DPP-4 inhibitor,
and 1 trial compared an SGLT-2 inhibitor with a GLP-1 agonist.
Of the 236 included studies, 9 were designed as cardiovascu-
lar outcome trials and enrolled 87 162 participants (247 034
participant-years) who were at increased risk of or who had
cardiovascular disease (SGLT-2 inhibitor: EMPA-REG

in the cardiovascular outcome trials made up 42.9% of all
participants in the SGLT-2 inhibitor trials (17 162 of 40 009),
60.0% (33 457 of 55 740) in the GLP-1 agonist trials, and
53.8% (36 543 of 67 958) in the DPP-4 inhibitor trials.
The baseline characteristics of studies were deemed
sufficiently similar based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI),

for all included trials. Connecting lines
represent head-to-head comparisons
between drugs, indicated by nodes.
Multigroup trials contribute multiple
comparisons, resulting in 258
comparisons from 236 trials. The
thickness of lines between nodes is
proportional to the number of trials
comparing the treatments. The sizes
of the nodes are proportional to the
number of patients in each treatment.
Patients may be included in multiple
comparisons: for example, in a study
of 3 groups consisting of control and 2
different drug classes, the control
group is compared with each drug
class. This is accounted for within the
network model and does not
constitute duplication of participants.

Risk of Bias and Publication Bias
Of236includedstudies,104(44.1%)werelowriskofbiasacross
all domains. Three (1.3%) were high risk of bias for allocation
concealment, 16 (6.8%) for blinding, and 58 (24.6%) for attri-
tion bias. No studies were high risk of bias for sequence allo-
cation or detection (eFigure 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
There was no evidence of publication bias (Egger test, 0.10;
P = .27) (eFigure 2).
Primary Outcome: All-Cause Mortality
Forall-causemortality,97studiesthathadenrolled134 160par-
ticipantsreportedatleast1eventinanygroup.Inall,therewere
6035 deaths: 714 (3.6%) of 19 587 participants treated with
SGLT-2 inhibitors, 1171 (3.9%) of 30 178 treated with DPP-4
inhibitors, 1195 (4.4%) of 27 373 treated with GLP-1 agonists,
and2955(5.2%)of57 022inthecontrolgroups.Comparedwith
the control groups, both SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.80 [95% CrI,
0.71 to 0.89]; absolute RD, −1.0% [95% CrI, −1.5% to −0.6%])
and GLP-1 agonists (HR, 0.88 [95% CrI, 0.81 to 0.94]; abso-
luteRD,−0.6%[95%CrI,−1.0%to−0.3%])wereassociatedwith
reductions in all-cause mortality (Figure 3). Dipeptidyl pepti-
dase 4 inhibitors were not associated with a difference in mor-
tality compared with the control groups (HR, 1.02 [95% CrI,
0.94 to 1.11]; absolute RD, 0.1% [95% CrI, −0.3% to 0.6%]). Both
SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.78 [95% CrI, 0.68 to 0.90]; absolute
RD, −0.9% [95% CrI, −1.2% to -0.4%]) and GLP-1 agonists
(HR, 0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.96]; absolute RD −0.5% [95% CrI,
−0.9% to −0.2%]) were associated with reduced all-cause mor-
tality when compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. There was no
significant difference between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1
agonists (HR, 0.91 [95% CrI, 0.79 to 1.04]; absolute RD, −0.4%
[95% CrI, −0.9% to 0.2%]).
Secondary Outcomes
Reporting of secondary outcomes was variable, with not
all trials presenting data. Cardiovascular outcome trials
accounted for the majority of events, with event data in other
trials derived frequently from bias-prone safety outcomes
reported in the publication or on the clinical trials database
entry. The networks for secondary outcomes are shown in
eFigure 3 in Supplement 2.
Cardiovascular Mortality
Compared with the control groups, both SGLT-2 inhibitors
(HR, 0.79 [95% CrI, 0.69 to 0.91]; absolute RD, −0.8% [95%
CrI, −1.1% to −0.3%]) and GLP-1 agonists (HR, 0.85 [95% CrI,
0.77 to 0.94]; absolute RD, −0.5% [95% CrI, −0.8% to −0.1%])
were associated with reductions in cardiovascular mortality
(Figure 3). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were not associ-
ated with change in cardiovascular mortality compared with
the control groups (HR, 1.00 [95% CrI, 0.91 to 1.11]; absolute
RD, 0% [95% CrI, −0.3% to 0.4%]). Compared with DPP-4
inhibitors, both SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.79 [95% CrI, 0.66 to
0.94]; absolute RD, −0.7% [95% CrI, −1.1% to −0.2%]) and
GLP-1 agonists (HR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.74 to 0.98]; absolute RD
−0.5% [95% CrI, −0.8% to −0.1%]) were associated with
reduced cardiovascular mortality. There was no significant
difference between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists on
cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.93 [95% CrI, 0.78 to 1.10];
absolute RD, −0.2% [95% CrI, −0.7% to 0.3%]).
Heart Failure Events
When compared with the control groups (HR, 0.62 [95% CrI,
0.54 to 0.72]; absolute RD, −1.1% [95% CrI, −1.3% to −0.8%]),
with DPP-4 inhibitors (HR, 0.55 [95% CrI, 0.46 to 0.67]; abso-
lute RD, −1.1% [95% CrI, −1.3% to −0.8%]), and with GLP-1
agonists (HR, 0.67 [95% CrI, 0.57 to 0.80]; absolute RD, −0.9%
[95% CrI, −1.2% to −0.5%]), SGLT-2 inhibitors were associ-
ated with reduced heart failure events (Figure 3). Glucagon-
like peptide 1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors had no signifi-
cant difference compared with the control groups, but

MI and Unstable Angina
Only SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with reduction in all

All outcomes are reported in hazard
ratios (HRs) for treatment vs the
comparator and 95% credible
intervals (CrIs). Absolute risk
differences (RDs) were calculated by
multiplying the RD by the event rate
in the comparator group. The 95%
CrIs for absolute RDs are calculated
by multiplying the 95% CrIs by the
event rate in the comparator group.
Heterogeneity was assessed using
the I2 statistic; low heterogeneity was
determined by an I2 of 25% or less.
The x-axis scale shown in blue
indicates the range of the HR from
0.5 to 2.0. Tables below the forest
plots show, for each drug class, the
number of trials, number of
participants with events, and the
total number of randomized
participants. For example, for
all-cause mortality, 88 trials
randomized 57 022 participants to
the control treatment with 2955
participants having events, and 49
trials randomized 30 178 participants
to DPP-4 inhibitors with 1171
participants having events. Control
represents either placebo or no
treatment; DPP-4, dipeptidyl
peptidase 4; GLP-1, glucagon-like
peptide 1; and SGLT-2,
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.

 to 0.98]; absolute RD, −0.8% [95% CrI, −1.4% to −0.1%]) com-
pared with the control groups (Figure 4 and eFigure 4 in
Supplement 2). There was no significant difference between
drug classes. No drug class was associated with reduction in
unstable angina (Figure 4).
Stroke
No drug class was associated with reduction in all stroke com-
pared with the control groups (Figure 4); however, GLP-1
agonistswereassociatedwithreductioninnonfatalstrokecom-
paredwiththecontrolgroups(HR,0.87[95%CrI,0.76to0.99];
absolute RD −0.3% [95% CrI, −0.5% to −0.02%]) (eFigure 4 in
Supplement 2). There was no associated difference between
drug classes for nonfatal stroke.
Individual Drug Types
For 16 individual drug types compared with the control groups
(eFigure 5), all-cause mortality was reduced only with 1 SGLT-2
inhibitor: empagliflozin (HR, 0.68 [95% CrI, 0.57 to 0.82];
absolute RD, −1.3% [95% CrI, −1.7% to −0.7%]), and 2 GLP-1
agonists: liraglutide (HR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.75 to 0.98]; abso-
lute RD, −0.9% [95% CrI, −1.5% to −0.1%]) and exenatide (HR,
0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.97]; absolute RD, −0.9% [95% CrI,
−1.5% to −0.2%]) (eTable 5 and eFigure 6 in Supplement 2). No
DPP-4 inhibitor individually reduced all-cause mortality.
Safety End Points
For any hypoglycemia, DPP-4 inhibitors (HR, 1.29 [95% CrI,
1.12 to 1.50]; absolute RD, 4.9% [95% CrI, 2.0% to 8.4%]),
GLP-1 agonists (HR, 1.44 [95% CrI, 1.25 to 1.66]; absolute RD,
7.4% [95% CrI, 4.2% to 11.1%]), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR,
1.24 [95% CrI, 1.06 to 1.45]; absolute RD, 4.0% [95% CrI, 1.0%
to 7.6%]) were all associated with an increased risk compared
with the control groups (eFigure 7 in Supplement 2). There
were no significant differences for major hypoglycemia.
There was no difference between drug classes for any or
major hypoglycemia.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were associ-
ated with a reduction in serious adverse events compared with
the control groups (HR, 0.90 [95% CrI, 0.85 to 0.96]; absolute
RD,−1.8%[95%CrI,−2.7%to−0.7%]),DPP-4inhibitor(HR,0.91
[95% CrI, 0.84 to 0.98]; absolute RD, −1.1% [95% CrI, −2.0%
to−0.3%]),andGLP-1agonist(HR,0.92[95%CrI,0.85to0.99];
absolute RD, −1.4% [95% CrI, −2.5% to −0.2%]). Glucagon-
like peptide 1 agonists were associated with an increased risk
of adverse events leading to trial withdrawal compared with
the control groups (HR, 2.00 [95% CrI, 1.70 to 2.37]; absolute
RD, 4.7% [95% CrI, 3.3% to 6.5%]), SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 1.80
[95% CrI, 1.44 to 2.25]; absolute RD, 5.8% [95% CrI, 3.2% to
9.0%]), and DPP-4 inhibitors (HR, 1.93 [95% CrI, 1.59 to 2.35];
absolute RD, 3.1% [95% CrI, 2.0% to 4.5%]).
Clinical Events in Cardiovascular Outcome Trials
Network meta-analysis of clinical end points from cardiovas-
cular outcome trials were similar to the primary analysis
for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2). Compared with placebo, SGLT-2 inhibitors
were not associated with reductions in all MI and nonfatal
MI, whereas GLP-1 agonists were not associated with a reduc-
tion in nonfatal stroke. Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists were
not associated with reduced heart failure events compared
with DPP-4 inhibitors.
For pooled cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and
nonfatal stroke, SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.88 [95% CrI, 0.79 to
0.97];absoluteRD,−1.3%[95%CrI,−2.3%to−0.3%])andGLP-1
agonists (HR, 0.91 [95% CrI, 0.85 to 0.96]; absolute RD, −1.0%
[95% CrI, −1.6% to −0.4%]) were associated with reduction in
events compared with placebo. The DPP-4 inhibitors were not
associated with reduction (HR, 0.99 [95% CrI, 0.92 to 1.07]).
There was no associated reduction in events when drug classes
were compared with each other.
Sodium-glucose contransporter 2 inhibitors were associ-
ated with an increased risk of genital infections (RR, 4.19
[95% CI, 3.45 to 5.09]; absolute RD, 6.0%; P = <.001) but not
of urinary tract infection (eFigure 8 in Supplement 2).
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were not associ-
ated with a significant increase in lower limb amputation
(RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 0.96 to 2.50]; P = .07) with high heteroge-
neity (I2, 73%). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were associ-
ated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis (RR, 1.58
[95% CI, 1.04 to 2.39]; absolute RD, 0.1%; P = .03). Glucagon-
like peptide 1 agonists were not associated with acute pancre-
atitis or retinopathy.
Drug Class Rankings
For all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, SGLT-2 inhibitors
were most likely to rank best, GLP-1 agonists second best,
and DPP-4 inhibitors worst (Figure 5). The SGLT-2 inhibitors
were most likely to rank best for heart failure and MI out-
comes, and GLP-1 agonists were most likely to rank best for
stroke outcomes.
Heterogeneity and Network Consistency
Heterogeneity(globalI2)waslowforallprimary,secondary,and
safety outcomes (range, 0% to 25%). For all-cause mortality,
heterogeneity was 12% when analyzed by drug class and by
individual drug type. There was no evidence of inconsistency
in all networks except for heart failure events (DPP-4 inhibitor
vs GLP-1 agonist), nonfatal stroke (DPP-4 vs control), and ad-
verse events leading to withdrawal (DPP-4 vs GLP-1, DPP-4 vs
control, and GLP-1 vs control; eFigure 9 in Supplement 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analyses did not affect the associations of SGLT-2
inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists with reduced all-cause mortality
andcardiovascularmortalitycomparedwiththecontrolgroups
and DPP-4 inhibitor inhibitors (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Although the sensitivity analysis did not show that SGLT-2
inhibitorswereassociatedwithreducedriskofnonfatalMI,the
analyses showed that the associations with all MIs remained.
The sensitivity analyses also showed that GLP-1 agonists were
not associated with reduced risk of nonfatal stroke.
Frequentist Meta-analysis
Frequentist network meta-analysis findings were similar to
those using the Bayesian approach (eTable 8 in Supplement 2).

All outcomes are reported in hazard
ratios (HRs) for treatment vs the
comparator and 95% credible
intervals (CrIs). Absolute risk
differences (RDs) were calculated by
multiplying the RD by the event rate
in the comparator group. The 95%
CrIs for absolute RDs are calculated
by multiplying the 95% CrIs by the
event rate in the comparator group.
Heterogeneity was assessed using
the I2 statistic; low heterogeneity was
determined by an I2 of 25% or less.
The x-axis scale shown in blue
indicates the range of the HR from
0.5 to 2.0. Tables below the forest
plots show for each drug class, the
number of trials, number of
participants with events, and the
total number of randomized
participants. For example, for all
myocardial infarction, 87 trials
randomized 53 099 participants to
the control treatment with 2133
participants having events, and 50
trials randomized 27 462 participants
to DPP-4 inhibitors with 616
participants having events. Control
represents either placebo or no
treatment; DPP-4, dipeptidyl
peptidase 4; GLP-1, glucagon-like
peptide 1; and SGLT-2,
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.

Drug ranking plots for primary and secondary outcomes are stratified by
treatment. Each line represents 1 drug class and shows the probability of its
ranking from best to worst. The peak of the line represents the rank that the
drug is most likely to be for each given outcome. For example, for all-cause
mortality, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are most likely to
rank best; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, second best; control, third
best; and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, worst. Control includes
placebo and no treatment.

 Discussion
In this network meta-analysis of 236 trials enrolling 176 310
participants with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors and
GLP-1 agonists were associated with reductions in all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality compared with DPP-4 inhibitors
and the control groups. The SGLT-2 inhibitors were associ-
ated with additional cardiovascular benefits for heart failure
events compared with incretin-based therapies and control
groups and for MI events compared with control groups. Of
the 3 classes tested, SGLT-2 inhibition may be preferred over
the incretin-based therapies based on their association with
lower mortality and their favorable adverse event profile.
Compared with control groups, the use of SGLT-2 inhibi-
tors was associated with absolute risk reductions (RRs) in
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality of 1% and 0.8%,
respectively. For the same outcomes, GLP-1 agonists had
more modest absolute RRs of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.
Given that absolute RR depends on the baseline risk, it is
probable that these estimates are greater in higher-risk
populations, with a corresponding lower number needed
to treat and better cost-effectiveness. The magnitudes of
these absolute RRs using SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 ago-
nists are important in the context of established standards of
care in diabetes.4 For example, the associated absolute RR in
mortality has been shown to be 0.5% for lowering blood
pressure21 and 0.9% for lowering low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (per mmol/L reduction).22
Todate,norandomizedclinicaltrialswithmortalityorcar-
diovascular outcomes have directly compared the efficacy of
these 3 classes. Within the limitations of observational stud-
ies, the CVD-REAL propensity-matched study23,24 demon-
strated that SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with lower
rates of all-cause death compared with other glucose lower-
ing agents (HR, 0.49).
The reductions in cardiovascular mortality in EMPA-REG
OUTCOME occurred within the first few months of treat-
ment, suggesting that diuretic effects and altered hemody-
namics may be responsible. Blood pressure reductions with-
out heart rate increases25 and weight loss25 may exert
additional early cardiovascular benefits that are independent
of glycemic control.26 In EMPA-REG OUTCOME,26 partici-
pants with heart failure with both modest and larger HbA1c
reductions benefited equally from empagliflozin suggest-
ing that glycemic control alone is not responsible. This
study supports the beneficial effects SGLT-2 inhibitors have
on heart failure by demonstrating a lower risk than DPP-4
inhibitors (HR, 0.55; absolute RD, −1.1%) and GLP-1 agonists
(HR, 0.67; absolute RD, −0.9%). To determine if the ben-
efits of SGLT-2 inhibitors on heart failure extend beyond gly-
cemic control, their effects in patients with heart failure
without diabetes will be assessed with empagliflozin in
EMPEROR-HF26 and dapagliflozin in Dapa-HF.27 In contrast,
questions have been raised about whether DPP-4 inhibitors
are responsible for an increase in heart failure events.28
The contrasting effects of the 2 incretin-based treat-
ments on cardiovascular outcomes may be explained by
their differing mechanisms of action.15 Glucagon-like
peptide 1 secretion is stimulated by an oral glucose load,
leading to insulin release.29 The GLP-1 half-life is short
in vivo due to DPP-4-mediated degradation. Although DPP-4
inhibition increases GLP-1 levels, this elevation is small com-
pared with the supraphysiological supplementation with
GLP-1 agonists. This may help to explain the greater reduc-
tion in HbA1c and fasting glucose levels and body weight that
is seen with the use of GLP-1 agonists compared with DPP-4
inhibitors.28,29 The UK Prospective Diabetes Study showed
that long-term intensive glucose control could reduce
mortality,30 and it is possible that benefits of incretin-based
therapies, if due to improved glycemic control, will take
many years to become apparent.
All 3 classes resulted in significantly more hypoglycemic
events than did control groups, despite SGLT-2 inhibitors and
incretin-based therapies using glucose-dependent mecha-
nisms with low theoretical risks of hypoglycemia.15 One
explanation is the heterogenous study definitions for hypo-
glycemia, which has been addressed by the International
Hypoglycemia Study Group.31 There were no significant dif-
ferences in the more robustly defined major hypoglycemic
events. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors performed
particularly well in reducing serious adverse events, whereas
GLP-1 agonists were associated with the highest risk of
adverse events of any type and with adverse events leading
to participant withdrawal. The majority of these adverse
events were gastrointestinal.32 Current GLP-1 agonists are
administered with subcutaneous injections; however, glyce-
mic efficacy of the first oral GLP-1 agonist was demonstrated
using semaglutide,33 with a cardiovascular outcome trial
ongoing.34 Oral GLP-1 agonists may exhibit greater tolerabil-
ity than subcutaneous counterparts.
Analysis of safety outcomes from cardiovascular out-
come trials demonstrated that SGLT-2 inhibitors were associ-
ated with increased risk of genital infections but not urinary
tract infections. There was a high degree of heterogeneity for
lower-limb amputations driven by the significant increase in
events with canagliflozin but neutral effects of empagli-
flozin. Our analyses do not rule out the possibility of a clini-
cally meaningful safety signal for SGLT-2 inhibitors and
amputation. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were associ-
ated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Careful treat-
ment selection may be necessary to minimize these out-
comes in at-risk patients.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the inherent limita-
tions of meta-analysis exist, including the availability and
quality of reported data.35 The reporting of cardiovascular
events was variable, with total events driven primarily by the
9 cardiovascular outcome trials. Adverse events reported on
ClinicalTrials.gov were used to identify additional events
using strict definitions. Given the potential for bias, addi-
tional analysis of primary and secondary outcomes was per-
formed limited to event data from cardiovascular outcome
trials. This showed consistent results confirming the validity
of the main findings.

 Second, an important assumption of network meta-
analysis is that participant characteristics that may affect the
relative efficacy of interventions are similar across groups.
A higher mean BMI in the GLP-1 agonist trials was noted,
although the mean BMI was similar across drug classes in the
cardiovascularoutcometrialsfromwhichthemajorityofevents
were derived. Third, clinical efficacy and safety was evalu-
atedbydrugclassratherthanbyindividualdrugtype.Although
this substantially increases power to detect treatment effects,
there is a key assumption that within-class treatments are in-
terchangeable. For the primary outcome, between-study
heterogeneity was low and the same when evaluated by drug
class and by individual drug type, suggesting little variability
oftreatmenteffectswithindrugclasses.However,findingsfrom
cardiovascular outcome trials have been variable (for ex-
ample, the same primary outcome was reduced with liraglu-
tide [LEADER36] and semaglutide [SUSTAIN-616] but not with
lixisenatide[ELIXA14]andexenatide[EXSCEL17]).Whetherthis
reflects true pharmacological differences or disparity of study
design and trial populations is unknown.15
Fourth, although approximately half of all participants
included in this study had low cardiovascular risk, short trial
follow-up duration and low event rates limit the evaluation
of these 3 agents in patients with low cardiovascular risk.
Fifth, this network meta-analysis did not address the effect
of treatments on HbA1c and glycemic control. Although this
has been reviewed previously,37 the drive to maintain glyce-
mic equipoise by modification of background therapy in car-
diovascular outcome trials prevents conclusions on HbA1c
reduction from being drawn. Similarly, inclusion of cardio-
vascular outcome trials precludes effects to be stratified
by baseline medication therapy. It will be important to test
these 3 classes against and in addition to metformin mono-
therapy for cardiovascular outcomes to better determine
treatment algorithms.
Conclusions
In this network meta-analysis, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or
GLP-1 agonists was associated with lower mortality than
DPP-4 inhibitors or placebo or no treatment. Use of DPP-4
inhibitors was not associated with lower mortality than pla-
cebo or no treatment.
