Abstract
Background: It is unknown whether the association between delirium and mortality is consistent for individuals across the whole range of 
health states. A bimodal relationship has been proposed, where delirium is particularly adverse for those with underlying frailty, but may have 
a smaller effect (perhaps even protective) if it is an early indicator of acute illness in fitter people. We investigated the impact of delirium on 
mortality in a cohort simultaneously evaluated for frailty.
Methods: We undertook an exploratory analysis of a cohort of consecutive acute medical admissions aged ≥70. Delirium on admission was 
ascertained by psychiatrists. A frailty index (FI) was derived according to a standard approach. Deaths were notified from linked national 
mortality statistics. Cox regression was used to estimate associations between delirium, frailty, and their interactions on mortality.
Results: The sample consisted of 710 individuals. Both delirium and frailty were independently associated with increased mortality rates 
(delirium: HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8–3.3, p < .01; frailty (per SD): HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2–9.9, p = .02). Estimating the effect of delirium in tertiles of 
FI, mortality was greatest in the lowest tertile: tertile 1 HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.1–5.6); tertile 2 HR 2.7 (95% CI 1.5–4.6); tertile 3 HR 1.9 (95% 
CI 1.2–3.0).
Conclusion: Although delirium and frailty contribute to mortality, the overall impact of delirium on admission appears to be greater at lower 
levels of frailty. In contrast to the hypothesis that there is a bimodal distribution for mortality, delirium appears to be particularly adverse when 
precipitated in fitter individuals.
Keywords: Outcomes, Longevity, Risk factors
Delirium, characterized by a fluctuating disturbance in arousal, atten-
tion, and cognition secondary to an acute medical condition, is com-
mon, affecting 18%–35% of general medical inpatients, 8%–17% 
of older patients attending emergency departments, and 51% of 
patients in postacute care (1–3). It is associated with increased length 
of stay, institutionalization, and progression of dementia (4–7).
Delirium is widely understood to be associated with mortality, with 
an overall HR = 1.9 consistent across a number of studies identified 
in a systematic review (4). This meta-analysis included observational 
studies adjusting for chronic comorbidity or acute illness, though none 
accounted for both. Therefore, an important unanswered question is 
whether the association remains independent of acute and chronic 
health factors that might otherwise drive mortality (8). Indeed, a more 
nuanced understanding of delirium and mortality is relevant given the 
proposal that the relationship may be bimodal (9). That is, although 
delirium may have catastrophic outcomes in some patients, for others, 
it may be an early indicator of acute illness leading to earlier recogni-
tion and treatment, perhaps even being protective.
Accounting for underlying frailty may provide an insight into the 
relationship between delirium and mortality because frailty itself is

 so closely related to risk of both mortality and delirium. One view of 
frailty describes the gradual accumulation of deficits as individuals’ 
age, which results in loss of physiological reserve (physical, mental, 
and functional) and increased vulnerability to insults (10). Taking 
baseline functional status and chronic comorbidity into account can 
resolve the issue of “unmeasured heterogeneity”—the factors that 
increase risk despite the same level of acute illness (11).
Our aim was to investigate the effect of delirium and frailty 
on mortality in a large cohort of acutely unwell adults, setting out 
to answer the following questions (i): Is delirium associated with 
mortality, even after adjusting for underlying frailty? (ii) Is there an 
interaction between delirium and frailty? (iii) Is the relationship with 
frailty and mortality linear across the range of frailty states and does 
this change according to the presence of delirium?
Methods
We undertook an exploratory analysis of a cohort prospectively ascer-
taining outcomes from acutely hospitalized elders. Participants were 
recruited as previously described (12). Briefly, all patients aged ≥70 years 
consecutively admitted to the acute medical unit between June 2007 and 
December 2007 were screened for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were (i) 
admission length of under 48 hours and (ii) insufficient English to be 
assessed for cognitive and mental status. The Royal Free Hospitals NHS 
Trust Ethics Committee gave ethical approval (06/Q0501/31).
Outcomes
The study was notified of all deaths through linkage with the UK 
Office for National Statistics for up to 3 years following the index 
admission.
Exposures
Delirium
All participants were evaluated on admission by trained psychia-
trists. Formal cognitive testing included the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (13) and delirium was defined using the Confusion 
Assessment Method algorithm (14). Key symptoms such as inatten-
tion were identified through the “serial 7s” or “W-O-R-L-D back-
wards” tasks. Other items such as acute onset, disorganized thinking 
and altered level of consciousness, and degree of fluctuation of 
these symptoms were ascertained through clinical assessment which 
included information from ward staff and the medical chart.
Frailty
A 31-item frailty index (FI) was constructed according to a 
standardized procedure (15), where the following variables were 
included: comorbidity (13 variables), examination findings (5 
variables), laboratory findings (9 variables), and functional status 
(4 variables) (Table 1). These variables were selected to encom-
pass the full range of acute and chronic health factors that could 
account for any observed association with mortality. All items 
were given a binary score (0 = no deficit, 1 = deficit present). 
For each participant, an FI score was calculated by dividing the 
number of deficits present by the denominator of 31 maximum 
deficits, resulting in a score between 0 and 1. For example, for an 
individual with 10 deficits present out of 31, their FI score would 
be 10/31 = 0.32. Across several iterations of FI in several hundred 
datasets, the usual upper limit of frailty observed asymptotically 
approaches 0.70. In our dataset, data were not missing for more 
than 6% in each variable.
Statistical Analysis
Proportional hazards for mortality were assessed in a series of Kaplan–
Meier plots and Cox regression models, where outcome was date of 
death. Postestimation procedures included Schoenfeld residuals for 
checking assumptions of proportionality. Multiplicative interactions 
between delirium and FI score were assessed in order to estimate 
the association of delirium and mortality with respect to underlying 
frailty, using α = .1 as a threshold for type 1 errors. This approach has 
been justified by quantifying the gains in power using a less stringent 
α for samples of this size where interactions between dichotomous 
(delirium status) and continuous (FI) variables are being considered 
(16). Linearity of any association with mortality across the distribu-
tion of frailty, restricted cubic splines were fitted (four knots), plotting 
log-hazard ratio for mortality against FI score, stratified by delirium 
status. Stata version 14.1 was used for all statistical procedures.
Results
The sample contained 710 individuals, with a mean age of 83.1 years 
(standard deviation 7.41), and 59% were female (Supplementary 
Table 1). A diagnosis of dementia was present in 42%. At the end of 
the 3-year follow-up, 340 individuals remained alive and 370 had died 
(median follow-up 5 months, IQR 1 to 17 months). The prevalence of 
delirium on admission was 10.3% (n = 73). The prevalence of deficits

 on index items ranged from 6% (metastatic disease) to 73% (CRP > 
5) (Table 1). The mean FI score was 0.23 (SD 0.096, upper limit 0.55), 
with a broadly normal distribution (Supplementary Figure 1).
Delirium, Frailty, and Mortality
Delirium was strongly associated with mortality, with 59 (81%) dying 
within the next 3 years, compared with 311 (49%) without delirium. 
Tertiles of FI score (first 0–0.19; second 0.20–0.26; third 0.27–0.55) 
also showed increasing associations with mortality (first 48%; second 
51%; third 60%). Both delirium and frailty were crudely associated with 
increased hazard for death (delirium: 2.4, 95% CI 1.8–3.2; FI [per SD]; 
HR 5.9 [95% CI 2.1–16]). This remained the case with a multivariable 
model including both terms adjusted by age and sex (delirium: HR 2.4, 
95% CI 1.8–3.3, p < .01; frailty [per SD]: HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2–9.9, 
p = .02; Table 2). Kaplan–Meier survival curves (adjusted by age and sex), 
according to delirium status, demonstrated worse survival for those with 
delirium (Figure 1).
Interactions Between Delirium and Frailty
We estimated the effect of delirium on mortality according to each 
tertile of FI. There was an inverse gradient of association, where 
stronger associations were observed in the fittest group (tertile 1 HR 
3.4 [95% CI 2.1–5.6]; tertile 2 HR 2.7 [95% CI 1.5–4.6]; tertile 3 
HR 1.9 [95% CI 1.2–3.0]). The delirium–frailty interaction was stat-
istically significant if α = .1 (p = .07).
Linearity of Mortality Gradients in Relation to 
Delirium Status
Restricted cubic splines of the log-HR for mortality against FI score 
were linear across the four knots, giving no indication that mor-
tality is driven by a particular portion of the frailty continuum 
(Figure 2). When additionally accounting for delirium status, the 
splines remained linear, though crossed over to suggest delirium may 
have greater associations with mortality at lower degrees of frailty 
and lower associations at higher degrees of frailty (p = .07; Figure 2).
Discussion
We found that on admission, both delirium and frailty were indepen-
dently associated with increased risk of death, beyond that expected 
from all the acute and chronic health factors measured in this study. 
Moreover, delirium and frailty appeared to interact in such a way that 
although delirium increases the risk of death at all levels of frailty, the 
relative impact of this association was greatest in fitter patients. The 
relationship between frailty and mortality was linear, suggesting that 
mortality is not being driven by a subset of individuals. Delirium sta-
tus had a small influence on these relationships. Taken together, our 
results suggest that delirium itself independently confers a mortality 
risk, and this risk applies whatever the underlying degree of frailty. 
Our data illustrate some of the advantages of using a FI in studying 
cognitive disorders by quantifying a multidimensional assessment, 
thereby allowing other “non-neurological factors” that nevertheless 
contribute to patient outcomes (eg nutritional status, polypharmacy, 
electrolyte abnormalities) to be considered (17).
Our findings should be treated with caution. Data were col-
lected from a single site, albeit a large London secondary care hos-
pital with unselected medical admissions from a population of 1.2 
million people and high generalizability. Secondly, despite a stand-
ardized protocol and training procedure, more than one rater per-
formed the psychiatric evaluation, possibly introducing inter-rater 
variability. Thirdly, patients were assessed for delirium on admission 
only (defined as within 72 hours of admission). Any patients develop-
ing delirium after this point would not be included in this analysis, 
possibly underestimating the effects of delirium. Strengths included 
large sample size and validated assessments undertaken by specialist 
diagnosticians. Moreover, a wide variety of variables were available 
to construct a broad FI. The specific inclusion of physiological and 
laboratory items may generally relate to acute illness, and it is becom-
ing clear that use of such measures is nonetheless informative for use 
in a FI (18). Although functional items were under-represented, for 
the requirements of this specific analysis, the combination of acute 
and chronic health factors made for a particularly robust FI measure.
To understand why the relative risk is higher in fit patients com-
pared with frail patients, the insult causing delirium in fit individuals 
needs to be large, in order to overcome their physiological and cogni-
tive reserve. Another reason for delirium in fitter individuals may be 
a distinct neurological precipitant which could drive the poorer prog-
nosis in these patients. Both frailty and delirium are associated with 
vulnerability and lack of physiological and cognitive reserve to insults, 
though few studies have been able to address this directly (19). One 
study found that individuals without a prior diagnosis of dementia (a 
marker of frailty and reserve) had a worse prognosis from delirium 
than those with a diagnosis, supporting our finding that fitter patients 
may incur a worse prognosis (20). A separate finding that mortality 
after delirium appears to arise independently of illness severity or 
frailty (21). We report a similar distribution of FI scores, though our 
study was large enough to explore the interactions presented here.
The mechanisms by which delirium independently increases risk of 
death (after adjusting for illness severity) remain unclear. Delirium com-
plicates and impairs recovery—patients with delirium are more likely 
to receive psychotropic drugs, more likely to fall, and less likely to mo-
bilize effectively during and after their illness, all of which may have an 
adverse impact on survival (22). In addition, they may be less likely to 
maintain adequate hydration and malnutrition, and be less compliant 
with medication. Of particular concern might be hypoactive delirium, 
where reduced arousal might lead to aspiration pneumonia. Overall, 
such findings serve to emphasize the emergency nature of delirium.
To conclude, in this exploratory analysis of a large cohort of con-
secutive admissions to an acute adult medical unit, we found that both 
delirium and frailty independently increase the risk of death. In addi-
tion, the risk of death is higher in delirious patients at all levels of frailty. 
The most striking finding using this approach is that the risk of death

importance of preventing, detecting, and treating delirium in any patient, 
and recognizing it as a serious condition with prognostic significance.
