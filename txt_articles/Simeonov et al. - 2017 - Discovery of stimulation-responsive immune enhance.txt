Abstract
The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to enhancers, non-
coding elements that shape cell-type-specific transcriptional programs and responses to 
extracellular cues1–3. Systematic mapping of functional enhancers and their biological contexts is 
required to understand the mechanisms by which variation in non-coding genetic sequences 
contributes to disease. Functional enhancers can be mapped by genomic sequence disruption4–6, 
but this approach is limited to the subset of enhancers that are necessary in the particular cellular 
context being studied. We hypothesized that recruitment of a strong transcriptional activator to an 
enhancer would be sufficient to drive target gene expression, even if that enhancer was not 
currently active in the assayed cells. Here we describe a discovery platform that can identify 
stimulus-responsive enhancers for a target gene independent of stimulus exposure. We used tiled 
CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)7 to synthetically recruit a transcriptional activator to sites across 
large genomic regions (more than 100 kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, 
CD69 and IL2RA. We identified several CRISPRa-responsive elements with chromatin features of 
stimulus-responsive enhancers, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbours an autoimmunity risk 
variant. Using engineered mouse models, we found that sequence perturbation of the disease-
associated Il2ra enhancer did not entirely block Il2ra expression, but rather delayed the timing of 
gene activation in response to specific extracellular signals. Enhancer deletion skewed polarization 
of naive T cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper (TH17) cell state and away from a regulatory 
T cell state. This integrated approach identifies functional enhancers and reveals how non-coding 
variation associated with human immune dysfunction alters context-specific gene programs.

 We adopted CRISPRa for high-throughput functional enhancer discovery with large libraries 
of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that tile genomic loci of interest (Fig. 1a). We first validated the 
CRISPRa method for enhancer discovery at the CD69 locus, which contains a previously 
characterized stimulation-responsive enhancer8. CD69 is a cell surface receptor that is 
rapidly induced on T cells in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation9. We asked 
whether CRISPRa could identify CD69 cis-regulatory elements in resting cells, even in the 
absence of TCR stimulation. We transduced resting Jurkat T cells stably expressing 
catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to the transcriptional activator VP64 (dCas9-VP64) with a 
pooled lentiviral library of gRNAs (10,780 gRNAs) that targeted sites at all Streptococcus 
pyogenes Cas9 protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) throughout a 135 kb region at the CD69 
locus, starting 100 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and extending through 
the gene body and 25 kb downstream (Fig. 1). We sorted transduced cells into four bins of 
CD69 expression and measured the distribution of gRNAs in the sorted populations (Fig. 1b 
and Extended Data Figs 1, 2). As expected, the cells with high CD69 expression were 
enriched for gRNAs targeting the CD69 TSS10 (Fig. 1b). We also observed enrichment for 
gRNAs at three regions well outside the TSS-centric CRISPRa window. We refer to these 
sites as CRISPRa-responsive elements (CaREs). One of the three CD69 CaREs represents a 
previously characterized stimulation-responsive enhancer referred to as conserved non-
coding sequence 2 (CNS2)8. Hence, tiling a transcriptional activator (dCas9-VP64) to non-
coding sequences can identify stimulation-responsive enhancers in unstimulated cells.
We next applied our enhancer-discovery approach to the IL2RA locus. IL2RA encodes a 
subunit of the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (IL-2Ra, also known as CD25). 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated non-coding variants in the 
IL2RA locus as risk factors for at least eight autoimmune disorders, underscoring the 
important role of IL2RA regulation in human immune homeostasis1. However, the 
functional impact of IL2RA disease variants remains unclear because of the complex 
regulatory landscape at the IL2RA locus that is responsive to multiple signals. In resting 
conventional T cells, IL2RA is not only induced by antigen stimulation via the TCR, but is 
also potently regulated by a number of other signals. Regulators of IL2RA expression 
include the cytokine IL-2, which upregulates the receptor as part of a positive feedback 
loop11,12. IL2RA regulation is also dependent on cellular programming. FOXP3+ regulatory 
T cells (Treg cells), which are required to suppress auto-reactive T cells and prevent the 
development of multi-organ autoimmunity, constitutively express high levels of IL2RA and 
depend on it for survival13. We hypothesized that multiple extracellular and cell-type-
specific signals are integrated to regulate gene expression through effects on distinct 
enhancer elements within the T cell super-enhancer at the IL2RA locus14,15. Whereas 
coding mutations in the gene affect all cell types that express IL-2Ra16, disease-associated 
non-coding variants could selectively affect IL2RA induction in conventional T cells in 
response to a specific signal, or impair constitutive expression in Treg cells. We sought to 
map functional IL2RA enhancer elements and determine how known disease risk variants 
affect enhancer function.
To discover IL2RA CaREs, we transduced Jurkat-dCas9-VP64 cells with a library of 20,412 
gRNAs tiling 178 kb around the IL2RA locus (Fig. 1c). Transduced cells were sorted into 
four bins of expression (‘negative’, ‘high’, ‘mid’, and ‘low’). Analysis of gRNAs enriched in

 each bin revealed six CaREs leading to different levels of IL-2Ra expression: three in the 
first intron and three upstream of the promoter (Fig. 1d). Recruitment of VP64 by individual 
gRNAs to CaRE3 and CaRE4 trans-activated IL-2Ra to levels comparable to those resulting 
from T cell activation (Extended Data Fig. 1). In addition, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of 
unstimulated HuT78 cells stably expressing dCas9-VP64 and gRNAs targeting the IL2RA 
TSS, CaRE3 or CaRE4 showed selective IL2RA induction, with transcripts originating at 
the TSS and no evidence of downstream intergenic or intronic transcripts originating at the 
gRNA target site (Extended Data Fig. 3). In sum, our unbiased transcriptional activation 
approach identified novel elements within the IL2RA super-enhancer where recruitment of a 
transcriptional activator is sufficient to induce IL-2Ra expression on resting cells.
We next investigated the biological significance of the IL2RA CaREs. Enhancers are often 
marked by signature histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and looping to 
promoters. We initially focused on chromatin state in human T cells because IL2RA 
regulation has a role in T cells and because GWAS variants linked to autoimmunity reside 
within enhancers preferentially active in CD4+ T cells1. We analysed data generated with 
HiChIP, a recently developed method that maps active enhancers on the basis of H3K27 
acetylation signature and simultaneously identifies long-range chromatin interactions17. All 
six IL2RA CaREs overlap with H3K27 acetylated elements that loop to the IL2RA TSS in 
primary human CD4+ T cell subsets, consistent with direct gene regulatory function (Fig. 
2a).
Whereas chromatin marks and three-dimensional configuration establish genomic features 
characteristically associated with potential enhancers, CRISPRa provides complementary 
functional data on the sufficiency of specific sites to serve as cis-regulatory elements for a 
target gene of interest. Although CaREs were mapped in a Jurkat T cell line, some 
corresponded with enhancer loops that are preferentially active in either Treg cells or pro-
inflammatory TH17 cells. Additional chromatin accessibility and histone modification 
mapping in human immune cell subsets corroborates that CaREs overlap with putative 
endogenous regulatory elements (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Figs 4, 5). We identified CaREs 
on the basis of functional regulation of IL2RA, but chromatin conformation data suggests 
they also have the potential to regulate neighbouring genes (Extended Data Fig. 6). Enhancer 
function could only be validated for a subset of CaREs with a heterologous reporter assay in 
Jurkats, suggesting that others may only exert gene regulatory functions in restricted cellular 
contexts (Extended Data Figs 4, 5). Overall, we have shown that recruitment of VP64 
identifies genetic elements with key, cell-type-specific chromatin features of physiologic 
enhancers.
Sequence variation in CaRE4 has been implicated in risk of human autoimmunity (Fig. 2a, 
b). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs61839660, which resides in this element, 
has been convincingly statistically resolved to a single non-coding variant. This individual 
SNP accounts for the risk of inflammatory bowel disease at the IL2RA locus18 (Extended 
Data Fig. 6). Consistent with a critical and complex function in immune regulation, this 
same SNP paradoxically also contributes to protection from type 1 diabetes19,20.

 Fine-mapping of CRISPRa responsiveness confirmed a functional role for the cis-regulatory 
sequence at the site of the rs61839660 autoimmunity variant. We expressed individual 
gRNAs surrounding the TSS and within CaRE4 to test their effects on IL2RA 
transactivation. The strongest transactivation in this region of CaRE4 was observed at a 
highly conserved accessible region that harbours the autoimmunity SNP and is bound by 
multiple transcription factors between two peaks of H3K27ac in stimulated T cells that 
harbours the autoimmunity SNP (Fig. 2b). In an enhancer reporter assay, the conserved 
element within CaRE4 drove strong luciferase expression in Jurkat T cells, but only in 
response to stimulation (Fig. 2c, d). Introduction of rs61839660 diminished this stimulation-
dependent enhancer function (Fig. 2c, d). These findings link the role of this disease variant 
to disruption of a stimulation-dependent IL2RA enhancer.
We next assessed if the rs61839660 SNP affects endogenous IL2RA gene regulation in 
primary human T cells. We analysed transcript data collected from anti-CD3/CD28-
stimulated CD4+ T cells from 178 genotyped people21. These data confirm that rs61839660 
is a response expression quantitative trait locus (reQTL), altering the transcriptional 
response to stimulation. Notably, the minor variant for rs61839660 is associated with 
reduced levels of IL2RA transcript in stimulated T cells (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 6), 
confirming the functional effect of sequence variation in CaRE4 on human T cell gene 
regulation.
We then directly tested the in vivo effects of sequence variation in the enhancer in a mouse 
model. The IL2RA CaRE4 enhancer is highly conserved, which allowed us to use Cas9 
genome editing to generate mice with the human autoimmune-associated SNP knocked in or 
with a 12 bp deletion at the site (12DEL) (Fig. 3a). Founders were backcrossed and bred to 
homozygosity. In vivo phenotyping of enhancer-edited mice revealed no evidence of overt 
immune dysregulation (Extended Data Fig. 7). T cell development was normal, with no 
differences in thymic cellularity or developmental stages (Extended Data Fig. 7). 
Furthermore, the enhancer does not appear to be required for IL-2Ra expression in Treg cells 
at steady state as SNP and 12DEL Treg cells had normal surface expression (Fig. 3b and 
Extended Data Fig. 7).
Given the stimulation-dependent enhancer activity in human cells in vitro, we reasoned that 
the CaRE4 enhancer might regulate IL2RA induction on naive CD4+ T cells following 
stimulation. We isolated naive T cells (CD4+CD62L+CD44−) from edited and wild-type 
mice and activated them in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Remarkably, naive T cells 
from both SNP and 12DEL mice had significantly reduced IL-2Ra surface expression 
compared to wild-type mice 24 h after activation (Fig. 3c, d). The deficit was more 
pronounced in 12DEL cells, but the SNP alone resulted in significant reduction of IL-2Ra 
levels (approximately 50% of wild-type IL-2Ra, P ≤ 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA and 
Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD)) (Fig. 3d). Reduced IL-2Ra levels were not due to 
a general defect in response to stimulation, as CD69 expression was induced to levels 
comparable to wild-type cells 24 h after stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 8).
As disruption of CaRE4 did not ablate IL-2Ra expression, we asked whether mutant T cells 
were able to eventually recover IL-2Ra levels after stimulation. Indeed, three days after

 stimulation, the percentage of cells expressing IL-2Ra from SNP mice was much closer to 
that of wild-type cells than it had been at day one, although measurable defects in the 
percentage of cells expressing IL-2Ra and intensity of expression persisted (Fig. 3e, f and 
Extended Data Fig. 8). The disease-associated single nucleotide change within CaRE4 has 
subtle effects on final levels of IL-2Ra, but exerts a pronounced effect on the timing of 
induction.
Multiple extracellular signals can induce Il2ra. Having shown that the intronic enhancer 
alters response to T cell stimulation, we next tested if IL-2, another critical signal that 
regulates Il2ra, could compensate for the effect of the disease variant. IL-2 promoted 
induction of IL-2Ra on the surface of cells from the SNP mice (Fig. 3e, f). Blocking IL-2 in 
the culture using an anti-IL-2 antibody had the opposite effect and severely impaired IL-2Ra 
expression on enhancer-edited cells (Extended Data Fig. 8). Our results suggest that the 
human rs61839660 disease-associated variant impairs the function of an intronic enhancer 
that regulates IL-2Ra induction in response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of conventional T 
cells. IL-2 signals partially compensate for mutations in the stimulus-responsive enhancer, 
suggesting that IL-2 response is mediated through additional cis-regulatory elements.
We sought to determine the in vivo response of enhancer mutant cells to acute stimulation. 
We deleted the entire Il2ra enhancer on the autoimmune-prone non-obese diabetic 
background to dissect subtle phenotypes that may be missed with the SNP and 12DEL 
mutations. This enhancer deletion (EDEL) strain also had no obvious T cell phenotypes at 
steady state (Extended Data Fig. 9). When EDEL mice were treated with anti-CD3 
monoclonal antibody to stimulate T cells in vivo, we observed significant differences in 
IL-2Ra induction on conventional T cells (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 9). By contrast, 
Treg cells continued to express wild-type levels of IL-2Ra, although subtle changes in Treg 
contribution to the CD4+ population in the spleen were observed (Fig. 4a, b and Extended 
Data Fig. 9). These findings confirm in vivo that the intronic enhancer controls the acute 
induction of IL-2Ra in conventional T cells by the TCR pathway.
We asked how impaired IL-2Ra induction could lead to cellular phenotypes associated with 
autoimmune disease. As naive CD4+ T cells polarize in response to stimulation, IL-2 
provides a critical signal that restrains secretion of the pro-inflammatory IL-17 in TH17 cells 
and promotes induction of Treg cells22. We hypothesized that impaired IL2RA activation in 
the context of enhancer mutation could reduce IL-2 signals to skew cells towards IL-17 
secretion and away from Treg induction. In TH17- and Treg-polarizing cytokine conditions, 
we assessed IL-17 secretion in cells treated with a range of IL-2 concentrations or antibodies 
to inhibit IL-2 signalling (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 10). Notably, only under 
conditions in which IL-2 signals were limited by antibody, we found that Il2ra enhancer 
deletion increased the percentage of IL-17-secreting cells, a hallmark of Crohn’s disease 
pathology23 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 10). In the absence of IL-6, the enhancer 
deletion caused reduced induced Treg cells to form only when IL-2 concentrations were 
limited by antibody (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10).
Treg cells are highly dependent on IL-2 signalling for survival13,24. In Treg-polarizing 
conditions in which IL-2 was limited, we found evidence of decreased cell viability, which

 was exacerbated by the enhancer mutation (Extended Data Fig. 10). Viability differences 
were not observed in other conditions tested, consistent with a selective effect on 
differentiating induced Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 10). Taken together, enhancer 
mutations that impair induction of the high affinity IL-2Ra receptor can disrupt critical IL-2 
signals and shift CD4+ T cell polarization towards a pro-inflammatory state.
Here we show that CRISPRa is a powerful approach for unbiased enhancer discovery at a 
target locus that can rapidly map functional enhancers without prior knowledge of their 
exact biological contexts. Although we focused on immune-related genes, we anticipate this 
approach will have general utility as an enhancer discovery platform and can be used for 
functional annotation of the vast non-coding genomic space. Our functional enhancer 
mapping approach complements publicly available chromatin maps and enabled us to 
discover a disease-associated enhancer that controls the timing of gene expression. Some 
enhancers may be missed with CRISPRa, perhaps especially very distal regulatory elements, 
and further investigation will be required to determine the limits of the method. Candidate 
regulatory regions identified by CRISPRa should be validated with genome editing in 
addition to chromatin data.
Our findings reveal that human non-coding disease variants can shape the kinetics of 
genetically encoded responses. Immune homeostasis depends not only on the level of 
IL-2Ra expression in Treg cells, but also on proper dynamics of IL-2Ra induction in 
conventional T cells. Further study is needed to determine the full set of cell types and 
responses that are altered by the rs61839660 SNP. Ongoing clinical trials are testing the use 
of anti-CD3 antibodies and IL-2 to treat various autoimmune and inflammatory 
conditions25–27. Understanding how genetic variation interacts with exogenous signals to 
regulate IL-2Ra induction may provide mechanistic insights relevant to such therapies and 
inform patient stratification decisions. The data presented here critically identifies a 
functional context for a genetic autoimmunity risk factor, and suggests a new model of how 
common non-coding genetic variants control stimulation-responsive temporal gene 
regulation in health and disease.
Methods
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not 
randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and 
outcome assessment.
Cell culture
Cell culture was performed at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Jurkat 
cells (Clone E6-1) were obtained from the Berkeley Cell Culture Facility for CRISPRa 
experiments. HuT78 cells were a gift from Art Weiss (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). Cell line 
identify for CRISPRa screen and arrayed VP64 experiments was authenticated by short

(Gibco), 100µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco).
Generation of dCas9-VP64 cells
Jurkat and HuT78 cells were transduced with a lentiviral dCas9-VP64-2A–GFP expression 
vector (Addgene 61422). Single GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS into the wells of a 96-well 
plate, and clones with bright uniform GFP expression were selected for use in future 
experiments.
Antibodies
All antibodies used for staining or cell stimulation are listed in Supplementary Table 4.
Primers
All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 5
Guide RNAs
All gRNAs used here are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
Tiling gRNA library generation
For each gene of interest, the window of tiling gRNA libraries extended from 100 kb 
upstream of the transcription start site through 25 kb downstream of the end of the gene. The 
hg19 coordinates of the CD69 library window were chromosome 12: 9,880,082–10,013,497. 
The hg19 coordinates of the IL2RA library window were chromosome 10: 6,027,657–
6,204,333.
gRNAs were designed against all NGG protospacer adjacent motifs in the window, 
excluding sequences containing BstXI or BlpI/Bpu1102l cut sites. Each library contained 
2,244 negative control gRNAs taken from the genome-scale CRISPRi/a libraries described 
in Gilbert et al.10. Protospacer sequences flanked by restriction enzyme sites and PCR 
adaptors were synthesized by as pooled oligonucleotides by Agilent Technologies. Pooled 
gRNA libraries were then cloned into the lentiviral expression vector ‘pCRISPRia-v2’ 
(Addgene 84832) as described in Horlbeck et al.28.
Tiling transcriptional activation screen
Protocols for the pooled lentiviral CRISPRa screens were adapted from Gilbert et al.10. 
Lentivirus was produced by transfecting HEK293T with standard packaging vectors using 
TransIT-LTI Transfection Reagent (Mirus, MIR 2306). Viral supernatant was collected 48–
72 h following transfection, filtered through a 0.45µm PES syringe filter, snap-frozen, and 
stored at −80°C for future use.
Jurkat-dCas9-VP64 cells were infected with lentiviral gRNA libraries by resuspending cells 
at 2 × 106 cells per ml in fresh media containing titered lentivirus and 4µg ml−1 polybrene. 
Cells were spin-infected for 2 h at 1,000g, 33°C, followed by resuspension in fresh media at 
0.25–0.5 × 106 cells per ml. To limit the number of cells expressing multiple gRNAs, 
lentivirus was titered to infect only 10–20% of cells. Cells were cultured in media containing

 0.75 or 1.5µg ml−1 puromycin for days 2–5 after infection to remove uninfected cells. The 
number of initially infected cells was at least 500× the number of gRNAs in the library, and 
at least this many cells were maintained throughout the course of the experiment.
7–10 days after infection cells were sorted on the basis of IL-2Ra or CD69 expression. 
Briefly, cells were resuspended in sterile sort buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) containing either 
IL-2Ra–PE or CD69–PE antibody at a 1:25 dilution. Cells were stained for 30 min on ice, 
washed twice with sort buffer, and passed through a 70-µm mesh. Cells were sorted into four 
bins on the basis of IL-2Ra or CD69 expression using a BD Influx cell sorter. The total 
number of cells collected was at least 500× the number of gRNAs in the library. Additional 
unsorted cells totalling 500× the number of gRNAs in the library were collected at this time. 
Duplicate infections and sorts were performed for each library. Collected cells were 
centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, and cell pellets were stored at − 80°C until genomic DNA was 
isolated.
Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted cells using NucleoSpin Blood kits (Macherey-
Nagel), or by Proteinase K digestion and isopropanol precipitation for samples with fewer 
than 106 cells. PCR was used to amplify gRNA cassettes with Illumina sequencing adapters 
and indexes as described in Kampmann et al.29. Genomic DNA samples containing less than 
10µg of gDNA were loaded directly into PCR. For genomic DNA samples containing more 
than 10µg of DNA, samples were first digested for 18 h with SbfI-HF (NEB) to liberate a 
~500 bp fragment containing the gRNA cassette. The gRNA cassette was isolated by gel 
electrophoresis as described in Kampmann et al.29, and the DNA was then used for PCR. 
Custom PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Indexed samples were pooled and 
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-2500 with the custom sequencing primer 5′-
GTGTGTTTTGAGACTATAAGTATCCCTTGGAGAACCACCTTGTTG-3′. Sequencing 
libraries were pooled proportional to the number of sorted cells in each sample. The target 
sequencing depth was 2,000 reads per gRNA in the library for unsorted ‘background’ 
samples, and 10 reads per cell in sorted samples.
Screen data analysis
Sequence files were processed to remove low quality reads and reads lacking the gRNA 
constant region. Reads were then trimmed for the common sequence using the cutadapt 
script and the command ‘cutadapt -a GTTTAAGAGCTAAGCTG’30. Trimmed reads were 
then aligned against a database of the guide sequences using bowild-typeie2 with option ‘–
norc’31. gRNAs with fewer than 50 reads in either of the background samples were excluded 
from all downstream processing and data analysis. Read counts for each sample were then 
normalized to the total number of gRNA read counts in that sample. A pseudo- count of 1 
was added to all normalized guide counts. gRNA enrichment was calculated as follows:
mean(log2(IL2RA_gate_rep1/IL2RA_background_rep1), log2(IL2RA_gate_rep2/
IL2RA_background_rep2))
The mean gRNA enrichment score was then calculated using a 5-gRNA sliding window and 
visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute). Non-targeting control 
gRNAs and gRNAs that map perfectly to multiple sequences within the gRNA library 
window were excluded from visualization. Raw and processed data for CRISPRa screen are

 included in Supplementary Table 1. For each sorted cell population, normalized read counts 
for a given gRNA were well correlated between the two replicates of the screen (Extended 
Data Fig. 2).
Screen validation
For screen validation using individual gRNAs, gRNAs were cloned into the same expression 
plasmid used for the gRNA library. Lentivirus was produced as described above and used to 
infect Jurkat and HuT78 cells expressing dCas9-VP64. Expression of IL-2Ra and CD69 on 
infected cells was analysed by flow cytometry. A complete list of gRNAs used in CRISPRa 
follow-up experiments is provided in Supplementary Table 6.
Transient gRNA expression
For the transient gRNA expression experiment shown in Fig. 2b, gRNAs were cloned into 
the same expression plasmid used for the gRNA library. 2 × 105 Jurkat-dCas9-VP64 cells 
were nucleofected with 1µg of sgRNA plasmid with a 4-D Nucleofector (Lonza) using 20µl 
of Nucleofector Buffer SE and nucleofection program CL-120. IL-2Ra expression on 
nucleofected cells was analysed by flow cytometry 48 h after nucleofection.
Human subjects
This study was approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panels on Human 
Subjects in Medical Research, and written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants.
Primary T cell isolation
Normal donor human peripheral blood cells were obtained fresh from AllCells. CD4+ T 
cells were enriched from peripheral blood using the RosetteSep Human CD4+ T Cell 
Enrichment Cocktail (StemCell Technology). For CD4+ T helper cell subtypes, naive T cells 
were sorted as CD4+IL-2Ra−CD45RA+, TH17 cells were sorted as 
CD4+IL-2Ra−CD45RA−CCR6+CXCR5−, and Treg cells were sorted as 
CD4+IL-2Ra+CD127lo. For HiChIP experiments, 500,000–1,000,000 cells were sorted into 
RPMI + 10% FCS. For ATAC-seq experiments, 55,000 cells were sorted into RPMI + 10% 
FCS. Post-sort purities of > 95% were confirmed by flow cytometry for each sample.
HiChIP protocol
The HiChIP protocol was performed as previously described17 with the following 
modifications. For approximately 500,000–1,000,000 cells per T cell subtype per replicate, 
we performed two minutes of sonication, no Protein A bead preclearing, used 4µg of 
H3K27ac antibody (Abcam ab4729), and captured the chromatin-antibody complex with 34 
ul of Protein A beads (Thermo Fisher). Qubit quantification post ChIP ranged from 5 to 25 
ng depending on the cell type and amount of starting material. The amount of Tn5 used and 
PCR cycles performed were on the basis of the post-ChIP Qubit amounts, as previously 
described17. HiChIP samples were size selected by PAGE purification (300–700 bp) for 
effective paired-end tag mapping, and therefore were removed of all primer contamination

 which would contribute to recently reported ‘index switching’ on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 
sequencer32.
HiChIP data processing and virtual 4C visualization
HiChIP paired-end reads were aligned to the hg19 genome using the HiC-Pro pipeline33. 
Default settings were used to remove duplicates, assign reads to MboI restriction fragments, 
filter for valid interactions, and generate binned interaction matrices. Virtual 4C (v4C) 
profiles were generated from 1 kilobase resolution HiChIP interaction matrices by filtering 
the matrix for all bin-pairs in which one bin matched a single anchor bin of interest. Depth-
normalization was achieved by scaling counts by the total number of filtered reads in each 
experiment. WashU Epigenome Browser sessions contained publically available H3K27ac 
ChIP-seq and ChromHMM data from the Roadmap Epigenome Project34. Browser shots 
from WashU track sessions were then included in v4C representations. HiChIP contacts are 
represented as inferred loops that have been manually drawn to aid in visualization of the 
data (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 6). HiChIP data for the IL2RA promoter and IL2RA 
CaREs are provided in Supplementary Table 7.
ATAC-seq
Cells were isolated and subjected to ATAC-seq as previously described16. Briefly, 55,000 
cells were pelleted, resuspended in 50µl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM 
MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 (Igepal CA-630)), and immediately centrifuged at 500g 
for 10 min at 4°C. The nuclei pellets were resuspended in 50µl transposition buffer (25µl 2× 
TD buffer, 22.5µl dH20, 2.5µl Illumina Tn5 transposase), and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. 
Transposed DNA was purified with MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and eluted in 
10µl EB buffer.
Luciferase assays
CaRE sequences were synthesized as gBlock Gene Fragments (IDT) or PCR amplified from 
Jurkat cell genomic DNA, then cloned into the Firefly Luciferase (Fluc) reporter vector 
pGL4.23 (Promega), upstream of a generic minimal promoter. The details of each construct 
are listed in Supplementary Table 8. All plasmids have been deposited with Addgene 
(Addgene IDs 91835-91852).
For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, each FLuc construct (700 ng) was electroporated with a 
Renilla luciferase plasmid (pGL4.74, 70 ng) into 5 × 105 Jurkat cells using the 4-D 
Nucleofector, 20µl Nucleofection Buffer SE and Nucleofection Program CL-120. Cells were 
rested overnight and then activated using plate bound anti-CD3 (clone UCHT1, 10µg ml−1, 
TONBO Biosciences) and anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, 10µg ml−1, TONBO Biosciences) 
antibodies for 22 h. Luciferase expression was assessed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase 
Assay (Promega) on a 96 well plate luminometer. FLuc activity was normalized to Renilla 
activity and is reported as fold induction over empty pGL4.23 vector.
Experiments shown in Extended Data Figs 4 and 5 were performed similarly, with the 
following modificatons. Equimolar amounts of each FLuc construct (~600 ng per sample) 
were electroporated with a Renilla luciferase plasmid (pGL4.74, 150 ng) into 5 × 105 Jurkat

 cells using the 4-D Nucleofector with 96-well shuttle, 20µl Nucleofection Buffer SE and 
nucleofection program CL-120. Cells were rested for 18 h. Cells were then split between an 
antibody coated stimulation plate (as above) and a PBS control plate. Luciferase expression 
was assessed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) on a 96-well plate 
luminometer after 24 h of stimulation. FLuc activity was then normalized to Renilla 
luciferase activity for each well.
RNA-seq
HuT78 cells expressing dCas9-VP64 and individual gRNAs were grown in normal media. 
HuT78 cells expressing dCas9-VP64 but no gRNA were stimulated with plate-bound anti-
CD3 and anti-CD28 or PBS control plates for 48 h. Conditions for coating tissue culture 
plates with antibody were identical to those used for the luciferase reporter experiments 
shown in Extended Data Figs 4 and 5. Cells were collected and total RNA was isolated from 
samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, cat. 74104) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions with the following options: cells were pelleted and re-suspended in RLT buffer 
with β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized using QIAshredder (QIAGEN, cat. 79654). On-
column DNase digestion was performed with the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, cat. 
79254). RNA samples were analysed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and all samples 
had a 260/280 and 260/230 ratio of 1.80 or higher. RNA integrity was measured with the 
AATI Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies), and all samples had an RNA 
Quality score (RQN) of 10.0. RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit RNA BR 
Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. Q10210). RNA-seq libraries from biological duplicate 
samples were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2, Set A (Illumina, 
cat. RS-122-2001) and Set B (cat. RS-122-2002), following the Illumina TruSeq sample 
Preparation v2 Guide: Low Sample (LS) Protocol. The samples were pooled and sequenced 
with the Illumina HiSeq4000.
RNA-seq sequencing data was analysed using kallisto35 with reference to version 80 of the 
Ensembl annotation of the human genome, and taking 30 bootstrap samples to estimate 
inferential variance of the abundance estimates. The resulting abundance estimate data was 
then analysed with sleuth36 using a model with covariates indicating presence or absence of 
stimulation, each targeting guide, and a generic ‘any guide’ covariate to capture the non-
specific effects of lentiviral transduction and gRNA expression (Supplementary Table 9). 
Gene-level abundance estimates were computed by summing transcripts per million 
estimates for transcripts for each gene. Wald tests were then performed at a gene level for 
each covariate with hits being called at a false-discovery rate of 10%. Data from these 
experiments are included in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.
To test stringently for expression from cryptic promoters induced by the CRISPRa 
treatment, reads in each sequencing sample were aligned to a repeat-masked version of the 
IL2RA region using HISAT237. The resulting alignments were then tested with bedtools38 
for overlap with 1 kb regions centred around the IL2RA CaRE3 and CaRE4 guides, but no 
such reads were detected in any of CaRE-targeting samples.

 We are aware of the recently reported ‘index switching’ on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 
sequencer and analysis of the non-targeted condition showed low to no IL2RA expression 
suggesting that this was not a problem32.
ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data
ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data were obtained from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and 
ENCODE. Details of the samples plotted are in Supplementary Table 10.
Generation of CRISPR mouse models
12DEL mouse—12DEL mice were generated by the UCSF Mouse Genetic core by 
microinjection of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (PNA Bio) into C57BL/6 zygotes. Briefly, Cas9 
(50 ngµl−1), mIL-2Ra-CaRE4 gRNA-1 (25 ngµl−1), and ssDNA HDR template (50 ngµl−1) 
were mixed in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 10 
min, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The mixture was microinjected into the 
cytoplasm of C57BL/6 single-cell zygotes isolated from super-ovulated females. We did not 
observe knock-in of the SNP in the progeny, but one founder carried a 12 bp deletion in the 
Il2ra intronic enhancer. The 12DEL mouse line was established by backcrossing this founder 
for at least one generation before breeding to homozygosity. gRNA and HDR template 
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
SNP mouse—SNP knock-in mice were generated by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar 
Harbour, ME, USA) by microinjection of gRNA and Cas9 mRNA. Briefly, Cas9 mRNA 
(100 ngµl−1), mIL-2Ra-CaRE4 gRNA-1 (50 ngµl−1), and ssDNA HDR template (100 
ngµl−1) were mixed and injected into C57BL/6 zygotes. Three founders with the knock-in 
SNP were identified by PCR amplicon sequencing and confirmed by sequencing of TOPO-
cloned PCR products. The SNP mouse lines were established by backcrossing founders for 
at least one generation before breeding to homozygosity. gRNA and HDR template 
sequences were identical to those used to generate the 12DEL mouse line and are listed in 
Supplementary Table 5.
EDEL mouse—Enhancer deletion mice were generated by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar 
Harbour, ME, USA) by microinjection of gRNA and Cas9 mRNA. Briefly, Cas9 mRNA 
(100 ngµl−1), mIL-2Ra-CaRE4 gRNAs 2–5 (50 ngµl−1) were mixed and injected into NOD/
ShiLtJ zygotes. Three founders with the enhancer deletion were identified by PCR amplicon 
size and confirmed by sequencing of TOPO-cloned PCR products. Immunophenotyping 
showed consistent phenotypes across three founders (not shown). Data shown is from one 
founder. The EDEL mouse lines were established by backcrossing founders for at least one 
generation before breeding to homozygosity. gRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
Mouse genotyping—All founders were initially genotyped by Sanger sequencing 
genomic DNA from proteinase K digested tail tissue. PCR amplification of the CaRE4 
enhancer was carried out using HotStart Taq (Bioline USA Inc.) and primers (mIL-2Ra-
CaRE4-F, mIL-2Ra-CaRE4-R) that span the edited site. PCR amplicons were then 
sequenced with the mIL-2Ra-CaRE4-F primer.

 Mouse experiments
All mice were maintained in the UCSF specific-pathogen-free animal facility in accordance 
with guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and 
Laboratory Animal Resource Center. Experiments were done with animals aged between 2 
to 4 months, unless otherwise noted. Wild-type littermate mice were used as controls for all 
experiments.
Cell preparation—Briefly, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes (peri-LNs), thymus and large 
intestine was collected from each mouse. Spleen, peri-LNs, and thymus were dissociated in 
1× PBS with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA. The mixture was then passed through a 70-µm 
filter. ACK lysis was used to deplete red blood cells from splenocytes.
Lamina propria lymphocytes were isolated from the large using the lamina propria 
dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. 130-097-410) and a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi 
Biotec).
Staining—All antibody stains were performed at a 1:100 dilution in 30µl of 1× PBS. To 
pellet the cells, centrifugation was performed at 400g for 5 min. For immunophenotyping, 
2,000, 000 cells were stained per tissue sample. Cells were first stained with a viability dye 
at a 1:1,000 dilution in 1× PBS for 20 min at 4°C, then washed with EasySep Buffer (1× 
PBS, 2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA). Cells were then resuspended in the appropriate surface 
staining antibody cocktail and incubated for 30 min at 4°C, then washed with 1× PBS. Cells 
were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for transcription factors using the FOXP3 
staining kit (eBioscience, cat. 00-5523-00) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Antibody staining panels are listed in Supplementary Table 4.
IL-2Ra induction in anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated naive T cell—Naive T cells 
were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes with CD4+ negative selection (StemCell 
Technologies) followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting for 
CD4+IL-2Ra−CD44−CD62L+ cells. 80,000 to 100,000 cells we activated per well of a 96-
well plate coated with 2µg ml−1 anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. For some conditions 10µg ml−1 
anti-IL-2 blocking antibody or 50 U ml−1 IL-2 was added. Cell analysis by flow cytometry 
was performed every day for 3 days.
In vivo T cell stimulation with anti-mouse CD3—NOD EDEL (n = 8) and wild-type 
littermate controls (n = 3) between 3–4 months of age were used for these experiments. All 
mice were checked for diabetes and were found to be normoglycemic. Animals were 
anaesthetized with isofluorane. 50µg anti-CD3 was injected retro-orbitally in 100µl volume. 
Mice were killed 24 h later for isolation of spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric 
lymph nodes and large intestine. Large intestine was processed using a lamina dissociation 
kit described above. Cells were stained with antibodies for flow cytometry (Supplementary 
Table 4).
Mouse T cell differentiation—Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph 
nodes of NOD EDEL mice and wild-type littermate controls with a CD4+ negative selection 
kit (StemCell Technologies, cat. 19752) followed by fluorescence- activated cell sorting of

 CD4+IL-2Ra−CD44−CD62L+ cells. Wild-type (n = 3) and EDEL (n = 3) were matched by 
age and sex. All mice were normoglycemic. Naive CD4+ T cells were activated in 96-well 
plates coated with anti-CD3 (1µg ml−1) and anti-CD28 (0.5µg ml−1) monoclonal antibodies 
at 37°C for ~72 h at an initial density of 0.75 × 106 cells per well and then were allowed to 
rest for 48–72 h in medium. For T-helper-polarizing conditions, 0 ng ml−1 (Treg), 2 ng ml−1 
(TH17 low) or 20 ng ml−1 (TH17 high) recombinant mouse IL-6 (PeproTech), 5 ng ml−1 
recombinant human TGF-β (PeproTech), 10µg ml−1 anti-IL-4 (11B11; BioXCell), and 10µg 
ml−1 anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2; BioXCell) were added to the culture throughout the 5 days. IL-2 
concentration was additionally titrated across all polarizing conditions: 10µg ml−1, 1µg ml−1, 
0.1µg ml−1 anti-IL-2 (S4B6; eBioscience) or 20 ng ml−1 recombinant IL-2 (National Cancer 
Institute). All cultures used DMEM high glucose media supplemented with 10% FCS, 
pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, MEM vitamins, l-arginine, l-asparagine, l-glutamine, 
folic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin and streptomycin. After 5 days, cells were 
stimulated for 4 h with a cocktail of PMA and ionomycin, in the presence of brefeldin A. 
Cells were then stained for CD4, IL-2Ra, IL-17A, RORγt and FOXP3 (Supplementary 
Table 4).
Analysis of gene regulatory effects of naturally occurring rs61839660 variant in human T 
cells
Nanostring expression data from the ImmVar cohort was reanalysed and normalized as 
previously described21. The data was residualized against biological covariates and the first 
6 principal components. As the SNP is found in appreciable frequencies only in individuals 
of European American background, only Caucasian samples (n = 178) were analysed. 
Linear regression was applied to the data using a modified ‘scikit-learn f_regression’ 
function. The data was residualized against the primary associated SNP and second round of 
regression was performed in the same manner. The FDR was calculated using R ‘qvalue’ 
package. Visualization was performed with matplotlib, seaborn, and ggplot2 packages. 
Figure 2e shows the SNP effects conditioned on rs2476491. The effects without 
conditioning are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6c.
