We report human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection 
associated with self-flagellation in 10 UK residents. These 
persons were heterosexual men from Pakistan, India, and 
Iraq. One person showed seroconversion in adulthood; 1 
was co-infected with hepatitis C virus. No other risk factors 
for bloodborne virus acquisition were identified. Onward 
sexual transmission has occurred.
H
uman T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is 
transmitted sexually, by contaminated blood prod-
ucts, by organ transplantation, or from mother to child. 
The estimate of 5–10 million global infections excludes 
85% of the general population, for which testing has not 
occurred, and is probably an underestimate (1). Disease 
occurs in <10% of carriers. In 2%–6%, adult T-cell leu-
kemia/lymphoma develops; this condition has a high 
mortality rate and a median survival of 8–10 months de-
spite therapy (2). In 0.25%–3.8 %, HTLV-1–associated 
myelopathy develops; this condition has a high morbid-
ity rate, and many other inflammatory conditions have 
 
been reported (3).
Self-flagellation, one of several practices in which 
piercing of the body occurs as part of religious practice, 
typically involves beating the back with implements at-
tached to ropes or chains, resulting in skin lacerations, as 
part of a public or private religious practice. The imple-
ments might be knives or blades, as used by the Pakistani 
Shia community, in which the practice is referred to as za-
njeer, or may involve whips or rods. Alternatively, in tat-
bir, practiced predominantly by Shia communities in the 
Middle East, the forehead is struck with a knife.
Self-flagellation has been practiced throughout his-
tory by different religious groups, usually only by men. It 
is a controversial practice, even among some of the Shia 
Islamic and Catholic communities that continue it. It occurs 
worldwide but notably in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and 
India. Self-flagellation has also been documented to occur 
in Catholic communities (4). Although self-flagellation is 
widely reported by the media, there are no statistics regard-
ing its prevalence. We report HTLV-1 infection associated 
with self-flagellation in 10 UK residents.
The Study
Case-patient A was given a diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection 
during screening before he and his wife undertook in vi-
tro fertilization (IVF). The patient was of Indian origin and 
had lived in the United Kingdom since early adulthood. He 
provided no history of receiving blood products, tattoos, 
or injection drug use. No family history was suggestive of 
HTLV-1 infection. In 2008, he donated blood in the United 
Kingdom that was tested for HTLV-1; he was seronegative. 
His wife of 10 years was also negative for HTLV-1. He had 
engaged in zanjeer voluntarily during childhood outside the 
United Kingdom and continued this practice. In the United 
Kingdom, the blades were soaked in a bucket containing an 
over-the-counter antiseptic solution, along with the blades 
of other men conducting the practice simultaneously. In the 
previous few years, his practice had also involved striking 
his forehead with a knife, which was subsequently shared 
by other men. Physical examination showed widespread 
scarring on his back (Figure) and the superior aspect of his 
scalp associated with self-flagellation.
We provide epidemiologic findings and HTLV-1 pro-
viral load (HTLV-1 DNA copies/100 peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells) for this case-patient and 9 other asymp-
tomatic HTLV-1 carriers of similar demography who re-
ported a history of self-flagellation in Iraq, Pakistan, India, 
or the United Kingdom (Table). Most reported sharing of 
blades. Some had required sutures abroad. Eight patients 
had single lifetime sexual partners and no other risk fac-
tors for acquisition of bloodborne viruses. One man was 
co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV); all others were 
negative for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and HCV.
All 10 patients were given a diagnosis of infection 
with HTLV-1 through screening programs since 2013. 
Nine patients had strongly positive Western blot results 
and positive PCR results. One patient had indeterminate 
Western blot results and negative PCR results but an 
HTLV-1/2 enzyme immunoassay sample/cutoff ratio >80, 
which is consistent with HTLV infection (5). HTLV-1 pro-
viral load is routinely measured in our center to monitor

 DISPATCHES
HTLV-1–infected carriers. Eight of the 10 patients had a 
low HTLV proviral load (<1%), which is typical of as-
ymptomatic HTLV-1 infection and suggests a low risk for 
development of HTLV-1–associated disease. Two of the 
men had an HTLV-1 proviral load >1%, which is associ-
ated with a higher risk for complications.
Conclusions
We describe 10 cases of HTLV-1 infection in men in whom 
the practice of self-flagellation was the only identifiable risk 
factor. In 1 patient, co-infection with HCV was also found. 
Mother-to-child transmission is difficult to exclude without 
testing all mothers of the case-patient, not all of whom are 
in the United Kingdom. However, the 1 screened mother 
was seronegative for HTLV-1, and case-patient A was 
uninfected when he donated blood 9 years earlier, which 
excludes maternal transmission. It is likely that either shar-
ing blood-stained blades, reusing personal equipment after 
inadequate cleaning with a shared disinfectant, contact of 
infected blood with open wounds, or contact with infected 
medical equipment resulted in HTLV-1 transmission.
Self-flagellation has also been noted to result in pneu-
mothorax (6). In addition, Ashura, the period during which 
it is practiced, has been associated with increased medi-
cally reported injuries (7).
The contribution of self-flagellation to the transmis-
sion of bloodborne viruses is unknown. In the United King-
dom, clinics that screen for these viruses (antenatal and 
sexual health settings) do not ask about the practice and 
do not screen for HTLV. We propose that self-flagellation 
be added to the list of risk factors that result in testing for 
bloodborne viruses, including HTLV-1. Blood transfusion 
services might screen for this practice when assessing po-
tential blood donors; for 6 men in this study, blood dona-
tion was the route of diagnosis. However, screening blood 
donors for HTLV-1 infection is not universal. Absence of 
screening, particularly in regions where self-flagellation is 
practiced, could accelerate dissemination of this infection. 
The seroprevalence of HTLV in Pakistan is unknown, but 
a recent study reported a prevalence of 0.19% among low-
risk blood donors (8).
Four men were given diagnoses of infection with 
HTLV-1 as a result of Human Fertilization and Embryol-
ogy Authority licensing regulations (9) on the basis of a 
2015 European Union directive. The directive requires fa-
cilities storing and processing human reproductive tissue

 Self-Flagellation and HTLV-1 Transmission
to test for HTLV-1 in persons from areas of high preva-
lence, or with partners or parents from areas of high prev-
alence; that is, where infection is present in >1% of the 
general population or >1 case/10,000 persons for first-time 
 
blood donors (10).
Of the 7 couples for whom each partner’s diagnosis 
was known, 4 couples were serodiscordant, despite unpro-
tected sex over many years. Sexual transmission has been 
associated with proviral load and duration of the relation-
ship (11). One study reported an ≈1% per year risk for in-
fection among serodiscordant couples (12), although fur-
ther data are needed to quantify sexual transmission risk 
in new relationships. During the 4 years since the first of 
these 10 cases was diagnosed, there has been 1 case of sex-
ual transmission (case-patient G) (Table), and the affected 
woman is in her first pregnancy. She had negative results 
for HTLV-1 on 2 previous occasions.
All 10 men had asymptomatic HTLV-1 infections, 
but 2 men had a high proviral load (>1%), which places 
them at risk for HTLV-associated disease. In all but 1 case-
patient, HTLV-1 was the only bloodborne virus detected. 
Within heterosexual populations, transmission of HCV is 
commonly associated with using contaminated injection 
equipment. HTLV-1 predominance in our cohort suggests 
the presence of a pool of monoinfected persons and spread 
within this international community.
All patients have been advised by medical practitio-
ners not to share implements during self-flagellation and to 
encourage fellow practitioners of flagellation to be tested 
for bloodborne viruses. Our visits to communities in which 
these practices occur to discuss risk elimination, raise 
awareness, and promote testing facilities have been favor-
ably received, and risk reduction has been implemented.
