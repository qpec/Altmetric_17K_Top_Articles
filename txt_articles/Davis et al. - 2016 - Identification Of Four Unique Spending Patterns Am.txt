Abstract
The underlying assumption that healthcare spending skyrockets at the end-of-life may suggest that 
policymakers should target the last few months of life to control costs. However, spending patterns 
leading up to death have not been fully examined. We applied a new methodology to 
administrative claims data for older Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2012 to characterize 
trajectories of healthcare spending in the last year of life. After adjustment, we identified four 
unique spending trajectories among decedents: 48.7 percent had High Persistent spending, 29.0 
percent had Moderate Persistent spending, 10.2 percent had Progressive spending, and only 12.1 
percent had Late Rise spending. High spending throughout the full year before death 
(approximately half of all decedents) was associated with having multiple chronic conditions but 
not any specific diseases. These findings suggest that spending at the end-of-life is a marker of 
general spending patterns often set in motion long before death.
End-of-life care accounts for approximately 30 percent of national Medicare spending and, 
as such, continues to have the attention of healthcare policymakers, payers, and providers.1,2 
While decedents represent only a small fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare 
spends on average $40 to $50 thousand per decedent in the last year of life compared to only 
$7 thousand per year for survivors.1,3,4 Underpinning health policy debates regarding end-
of-life treatment intensity,5,6 advanced directives,7,8 and hospice care,1 is the underlying 
assumption that adults approaching death will exhibit a steep rise in healthcare spending in

 the final months of life.9 However, this notion that healthcare spending skyrockets at the end 
of life has not been directly examined.
Aging of the US population compounds concerns about the high cost associated with the 
end-of-life care as the baby boomers enter Medicare.10 Despite the relevance of healthcare 
spending for individuals leading up to death to national healthcare reform, little is known 
about the patterns or trajectories of their spending at the end of life. It should not be a 
surprise that people who are sick and dying consume high healthcare resources. The 
question remains whether the trajectories of spending at the end-of-life vary in meaningful 
ways. Prior work has suggested that certain diseases are associated with a pattern of decline 
that may be reflected in spending.11-13 More detailed information about the course of 
spending near the end-of-life may provide important insights about the drivers of end-of-life 
spending and shed light on potential strategies to mitigate the costs while preserving high 
quality care for people who are dying.14
Therefore we sought to identify trajectories of Medicare spending among older decedents. 
To examine potential factors related to observed trajectories of end-of-life spending, we also 
examined how those trajectories are related to number and type of health conditions, and the 
type of services that account for the spending. We also examined the relationship between 
spending trajectories and total Medicare spending per enrollee by US state.
Study Data and Methods
Study Population
We used a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2012 to identify patterns of 
spending in the last year of life. Our study used 2011-2012 data from CMS’s Master 
Beneficiary Summary (MBS), Part B Carrier, MedPAR, Hospice, Inpatient, and Outpatient 
files. This study received institutional review board approval.
Among all Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B 
and not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage throughout 2011-2012, we identified those who 
died using the reported date of death in the 2012 MBS file. Next, we restricted our sample to 
those aged 6699 years old as of January 1, 2012 that resulted in identification of 1,266,954 
decedents. From older Medicare decedents in 2012, we drew a random sample of 100,000 
decedents resulting in, after removing those with missing values for sociodemographic 
measures, a final sample of 99,848 decedents. For each decedent we gathered a variety of 
measures including sociodemographic characteristics, conditions based on diagnoses on 
healthcare claims, and health service use.
Study Variables
Healthcare Spending in the Last Year of Life
For each decedent we determined daily healthcare spending (except for prescription 
medications) in the last year of life. To do so, we used the date of service on each claim 
relative to the date of death. For measures that spanned multiple days (e.g., an inpatient 
hospital stay), spending was uniformly distributed over the service interval. Using

 established methods that account for variation in Medicare reimbursement, we then price 
standardized healthcare spending.15 Daily total healthcare spending was then aggregated 
according to month before death.
Health Conditions in the Last Year of Life
We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Clinical Classification Software 
(CCS) system for grouping International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical 
Modification (ICD–9–CM) codes into meaningful disease categories.16 Decedents had to 
have one inpatient or two physician outpatient claims seven days apart in the last year of life 
to be labeled with a specific diagnosis. From the 260 CCS diagnostic categories, we selected 
those that represent the leading causes of death among older US adults17 including: cancer 
(solid tumors versus other types of cancer), cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, other cardiovascular disease), and other types of organ failure 
(respiratory, renal, liver failure) (Appendix, Exhibit 1).18 Decedents could have more than 
one of these conditions thus we also counted the total number of conditions from this list for 
each decedent, aggregated to the following categories: 0 or 1, 2 or 3, versus 4 or more 
conditions.
Health Service Use and Place of Death
Using date of service, we identified when the health service use occurred in relationship to 
date of death. In the last year of life, we report the number of outpatient visits to primary 
care physicians, specialists, and emergency departments identified in the Part B Carrier and 
Outpatient files. To identify the number of visits to primary care physicians we used 
Medicare specialty codes on ambulatory claims that correspond to internal medicine, family 
medicine, general practice, and geriatric medicine and all others were considered medical or 
surgical specialists.19,20 Using data from the MedPAR files we identified the total number of 
days spent as an inpatient, in an intensive care unit, or at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) .
We report several measures that reflect care more specific to end-of-life, including whether 
on the date of death the beneficiary had been in a inpatient setting reimbursed by Medicare 
including a hospital stay without ICU, a hospital stay with ICU, or other type of inpatient 
stay (primarily SNF) according to claim dates. If no claims were on the date of death, the 
place of death was considered unknown (the decedent likely died in the community or long-
term care facility). We also identified whether decedents enrolled in hospice in the last six 
months of life.21 Finally, we determined the use of life-prolonging treatments including: 
intubation and mechanical ventilation (ICD-9-CM codes: 96.04, 96.05, 96.7×), gastrostomy 
feeding tube (ICD-9-CM codes: 43.2, 43.11, 43.19, 43.2, 44.32), and hemodialysis (ICD-9-
CM code: 39.95).5
Analyses
Identification of Spending Trajectories
We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct patterns of Medicare spending 
among decedents (Appendix, Exhibit 2) .18,22 According to spending trajectory assignment, 
we then examined the decedents’ conditions and use of health services. As healthcare

 spending at the end-of-life varies significantly by sociodemographic characteristics23-25 all 
of these models were adjusted for decedent age, sex, and race/ethnicity. While in our 
primary analysis adjustment for these factors is appropriate, we also examined how 
sociodemographic characteristics vary across spending trajectories and tested whether the 
trajectory models were different when fit separately by decedent age, sex, or race/ethnicity.
Across spending trajectories, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare means, χ2-
test to compare proportions, and Kruskal Wallis test to compare medians. A two-sided p-
value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We assumed any missing 
values to be missing completely at random and all analyses were based on complete case 
analysis.
Association with State Medicare Spending—To determine the extent to which the 
relative percent of decedents decedents in each spending trajectories is related to general 
regional healthcare spending, we examined relationship between the proportion in each 
spending trajectories and total price, age, sex, and race adjusted Medicare spending per 
enrollee by US state.20 We used Spearman correlation and simple linear regression to 
examine associations. For these analyses, only the 45 states with a sample of at least 300 
decedents were used. Data management of CMS administrative claims data were conducted 
using SAS, version 9.4 (Cary, NC) and statistical analyses were performed in Stata MP, 
version 13.1 (College Station, TX) .26
Limitations
There are several limitations of our study that must be acknowledged. First, our study was 
limited to examining Medicare spending among older US adults. This limits the 
generalizability of our findings and thus patterns may vary, for instance, among younger 
adults and older adults enrolled in managed care. Second, our analyses do not take into 
account out-of-pocket or medication spending.27 Lastly, we are unable to capture detail on 
cause of death and other important factors such as functional status and use of advanced 
directives in administrative data.
Results
Among our study population of 99,848 older decedents the mean age was 83.2 years, 55.5 
percent were female, and 88.1 percent were Non-Hispanic White (Appendix, Exhibit 3).18 
The majority of decedents did not die in a Medicare-reimbursed facility (69.2 percent) and 
43.0 percent enrolled in hospice.
Spending Trajectories
We identified four distinct trajectories of spending in the last year of life including what we 
refer to as: High Persistent, Moderate Persistent, Progressive, and Late Rise spending 
(Exhibit 1). Nearly half of decedents were classified as having High Persistent spending in 
the last year of life (48,605 out of 99,848) characterized by having high initial and steadily 
increasing spending throughout the last year of life. Approximately 10 percent of decedents 
exhibited a Progressive pattern where spending started relatively low but increased steeply

 throughout the time period. Moderate Persistent spending (29.0 percent of decedents) was 
characterized by moderately high spending initially followed by dip and then increase in the 
last four months of life. Lastly, in 12.1 percent of decedents spending was very low up to 
four months before death and then increased exponentially – Late Rise spending. There were 
small differences in percentage of age, sex, and race of decedents across trajectories 
(Appendix, Exhibit 3).18
There was substantial variation in absolute dollars of Medicare spending in the last year of 
life across the four spending trajectories (Exhibit 2). The High Persistent Spenders had 
significantly greater spending than other trajectories (p-value < 0.001) – for instance the 
median total Medicare spending in the last year of life among High Persistent Spenders was 
$59,394 compared to $37,036 among Progressive Spenders. Late Rise Spenders had the 
steepest curve but substantially lower total Medicare spending in the last year of life (median 
spending $11,166). U.S. States total Medicare spending per enrollee was strongly associated 
with the percentage of decedents in the High Persistent Spenders category (Spearman rs = 
0.78, p-value < 0.001) by US state (Appendix, Exhibit 4).18
Spending Trajectories According to Health Conditions
Among decedents with the same health condition, the percentage of decedents in each 
spending trajectory varied little; however, we observed large differences when examined by 
the total number of conditions (Exhibit 3). Decedents with fewer conditions (i.e., those with 
either one or no conditions) more often had Late Rise spending (21.6 percent compared to 
6.3 percent among those with four or more conditions) and Moderate Persistent spending 
(36.6 percent compared to 21.3 percent among those with four or more conditions), p-value 
< 0.001. Decedents with two or three conditions had the highest proportion of Progressive 
spending (31.2 percent). Decedents with four or more conditions had the largest proportion 
of High Persistent spending (62.6 percent)
Use of Health Services According to Spending Trajectory
High Persistent Spenders had greater use of all health services except hospice in the last year 
of life (Exhibit 4). Most notable were approximately twice the number of outpatient visits to 
specialists (mean of 6.3 visits versus less than 3 among other spending trajectories), higher 
number of inpatient days, and days in SNFs, p-value < 0.001 for all. Progressive Spenders 
exhibited some similarities to High Persistent Spenders in terms of use of inpatient health 
services but were most likely to use hospice (p-value < 0.001). Late Rise Spenders had 
significantly lower use of both outpatient and inpatient health services in the last year of life. 
High Persistent Spenders were more likely to have used life-prolonging treatments than 
people in other spending trajectories (i.e., use of mechanical ventilation, feeding tube, and 
hemodialysis). Place of death was similar across spending trajectories – the only noticeable 
difference being higher proportion of deaths occurring during a hospital stay that included 
ICU use among Late Rise Spenders.
Influence of Sociodemographic Characteristics on Spending Trajectory
While our goal was to create aggregated trajectory patterns for all Medicare decedents, prior 
literature suggests there may be differences by age, sex, or race in the way decedents use

 health services at the end of life.23-25 To test whether spending trajectories differ by these 
factors models were fit for each sociodemographic group. The main differences were that for 
decedents older than 75 and for Non-Hispanic Whites compared to Non-Hispanic Blacks or 
other racial groups, the number of trajectories dropped to three with loss of the Progressive 
Rise category (Appendix, Exhibits 5-7).18 Future examination of variability in end-of-life 
spending trajectories according to sociodemographic characteristics is warranted.
Discussion
In this study we identified four unique Medicare spending patterns among older adults in the 
last year of life. We found the trajectory with the largest proportion of decedents to be High 
Persistent spending – decedents who had a high spending pattern throughout the entire last 
year of life. This finding challenges the idea that healthcare spending skyrockets for those 
immediately nearing death.28
Overall, High Persistent spenders used more outpatient services but their use of inpatient 
services was comparable to those who had Progressing spending over the last year of life. 
Only 12.1 percent of decedents in our sample were assigned the least expensive pattern of 
end-of-life spending: Late Rise spending. The distribution of trajectories differed little 
according to specific health diseases, but was strongly related to the total number of chronic 
health conditions. At the US state level, we found higher total Medicare spending per all 
enrollees to be associated with a high percent of High Persistent decedents, whereas other 
trajectories such as Late Rise were associated with lower spending.
Trajectory classification has previously been applied for examining disability and functional 
decline.29-31 One prior analysis has profiled decendents,32 yet to our knowledge this is the 
first study to use group-based trajectory modeling to classify patterns of end-of-life 
spending. Nearly half of older decedents in our study, however, were high spending 
throughout the entire last year of life. This finding challenges a widely-held notion that most 
end-of-life costs accrue in the last few weeks to months and could point to very different 
solutions for how one would influence end-of-life care.33 Accounting for nearly half of all 
Medicare spending, inpatient services are often targeted for reduction by moving people 
toward more palliative settings.34 Yet efforts focused on reducing reliance on costly inpatient 
and intensive services only in the last few months of life will likely have less effect on 
overall costs than might be anticipated.
Specific diseases are associated with certain patterns of decline,11-13 but we find that 
diseases are not associated with particular spending trajectories. Instead, it is the number of 
conditions that appear to be most relevant to end-of-life spending. The importance of 
multiple chronic conditions for spending aligns with other studies that show the presence of 
multiple chronic conditions itself, whether at the end-of-life or otherwise, is a critical factor 
in healthcare spending.4,35-38
The association between High Persistent Spending with having four or more chronic 
conditions provides a clue where more effective strategies might be deployed. People in the 
high spending trajectories also used more ambulatory health services including both primary

 care and specialty visits. The high frequency of these visits affords the potential for 
intervening upstream of the hospital among people with multiple conditions and at risk of 
death. Among these people who have a high burden of chronic illness and functional 
impairment43 it may be harder for patients, families and providers to recognize when a final 
turn for the worse is occurring. Improving care coordination, fragmentation across providers, 
and linkages to supportive services for these high cost, high need beneficiaries in general 
over a longer time span, rather than focusing on the last months of life, may improve care 
experience and reduce overall cost and reliance on inpatient services.
We also observed an interesting pattern in the approximately 10 percent of decedents who 
had Progressive spending, decedents who spent little early in the year and steadily increased 
(linearly) to death. Although we can only speculate, this pattern could reflect situations 
where patients, families and doctors discern more clearly clinical progression since these 
decedents were most likely to enroll in hospice. This pattern is in contrast to the Late Rise 
decedents in whom multiple chronic conditions were less frequent and may indicate people 
who experience a sudden health event that more rapidly leads to death or for which the 
patient and family opted for a less intensive approach in anticipation of death.
While the trajectories differentiate between individual spending patterns, we found that the 
proportion of decedents in each trajectory across regions varied as well. Regional differences 
in level of end-of-life spending are not fully explained by variation in illness39,40 or patient 
preferences.41 The correlation of regional spending at the end-of-life with total state 
Medicare spending per enrollee suggests that end-of-life care patterns may be a signal for 
general approaches to intensity of service provision.5,42 Our findings support this idea by 
showing that there is two-fold variation in the proportion of decedents who are High 
Persistent spending across regions and the distribution of spending trajectories is correlated 
with total population spending.
Insight into the patterns of healthcare spending occurring at the end-of-life has important 
health policy implications. High Persistent spending that is strongly associated with higher 
regional spending overall, appears to be set in motion before the last year of life and with 
having multiple chronic conditions. This finding suggests that health policy strategies 
focused on improving quality and reducing cost for those immediately approaching death 
may have less of an impact than originally anticipated.43,44 Strategies such as Hospice that 
target those exhibiting a rapid clinical decline (with a prognosis of less than six months) may 
apply to fewer than 20 percent of older decedents (i.e., potentially those in our analyses with 
Progressive or Late Rise spending). Therefore, future strategies directed at meeting the care 
needs for older adults with multiple chronic conditions – not necessarily for those with a 
poor immediate prognosis – could have the largest impact on national spending.45

Appendix, Exhibit 2. Model specifications and sensitivity analyses
Model Specifications
Group-based trajectory modeling is an application of finite mixture modeling where the 
model assumes a priori that the population is composed of a mixture of distinct groups 
defined by their trajectories. Trajectory groups are conceptually thought of as latent 
longitudinal strata where population variability is captured by differences across groups in 
the shapes of the curves. The number of groups is determined in a data-adaptive fashion 
using model selection criteria. Each subject is assigned a trajectory group based on the 
probability of membership.
We used an approach developed by Nagin to identify and assign distinct healthcare spending 
trajectories to decedents.1-3 As healthcare spending is highly skewed, we used the natural 
logarithm transformation to normalize spending data. For decedents who had $0.00 spending 
on a given month, we assigned a value of $1.00 prior to the transformation to facilitate the 
logarithmic transformation.
To arrive at the optimal number of distinct groups that best fit our data, we constructed 
models using two to six groups. We also investigated the unique combination of functional 
forms (i.e., intercept-only, linear, quadratic, versus cubic) that resulted in the best fitting 
model. The final model was selected using Bayesian Information Criterion.4 As healthcare 
spending at the end of life varies significantly by sociodemographic characteristics5-7 all of

 these models were adjusted for decedent age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Age was included in 
models as a continuous variable and race/ethnicity was included as a nominal categorical 
variable with Non-Hispanic White as the reference category.
Sensitivity Analyses
Although our primary analysis was adjusted for Medicare decedent sociodemographic 
characteristics, we also performed sensitivity analyses by fitting trajectory models separately 
according to age (young versus old), sex, and race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-
Hispanic Black, and Other). For these analyses younger Medicare decedents were defined as 
those between 65 to 74 years of age and older Medicare decedents as those ≥ 75 years of 
age. For selecting the optimal model in regards to the number of groups and functional 
forms, we performed the identical approach as for our primary analysis. Results of our 
sensitivity analyses can be found in Appendix Exhibits 5-7.
