Mature peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous 
group of disorders collectively comprising 10–15% of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas1. These cancers typically behave aggressively2,3. Outcomes 
are worse than those for equivalent B cell cancers and include an 
overall estimated 5-year survival of only 32% (ref. 3). Furthermore, 
although treatment approaches for B cell cancers include targeted 
immunotherapies, such as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4, bis-
pecific T cell engagers5 and, more recently, CAR T cell therapy6,7, no 
such approaches are available for treatment of T cell cancers.
Immunotherapies used for B cell malignancies target pan–B cell 
antigens because there are no antigens that discriminate normal from 
malignant B cells. The consequent depletion of the normal B cell com-
partment is surprisingly well tolerated and is considered an accept-
able side-effect6,7. The situation is different with T cells: again, there 
are no antigens that discriminate normal from malignant T cells3,8, 
but the T cell aplasia consequent to targeting a pan–T cell antigen 
would lead to profound and unacceptable immunosuppression9. Here 
we describe a targeting approach for treating mature T cell cancers 
that relies on recognition of a pan–T cell antigen but avoids severe 
immunosuppression.
The αβ TCR is a pan–T cell antigen. Apart from its expression on 
normal T cells, it is a highly promising target for treatment of PTCL: 
 
it is expressed by >95% of cases of PTCL, not otherwise specified 
(PTCL-NOS)8 and almost all angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphomas 
(AITLs)8 as well as by 30% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias 
(T-ALLs)10. High and homogenous cell-surface expression of the αβ 
TCR is commonly seen on lymphoma cells11. In addition, evidence 
exists that a proportion of PTCL cases may depend on TCR-associated 
signaling for lymphomagenesis and survival12.
TCR α and β chains comprise N-terminal variable and C-terminal 
constant regions13 (Fig. 1a). TCR diversity is generated by somatic 
recombination, which occurs when each TCR chain selects a variable 
(V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) region13. Importantly, 
all cells in a clonal T cell population express the same unique TCR. 
However, approaches targeting the TCR variable region unique to a 
malignant clone are impracticable, as a bespoke therapeutic would be 
required for each patient.
An often forgotten feature of TCR β-chain recombination is that 
there are two genes associated with the β-chain constant region: 
TRBC1 and TRBC2. Each TCR (and therefore each T cell) irre-
versibly selects a TCR β-chain constant region encoded by either 
TRBC1 or TRBC2 for expression in a mutually exclusive manner14,15 
 
(Fig. 1b). Hence, a population of normal T cells will comprise a mix-
ture of individual cells, some expressing TRBC1 and others express-
ing TRBC2, whereas the entire population of T cell cancer will 
exclusively express either TRBC1 or TRBC2. We propose targeting 
TRBC1 in the case of a TRBC1+ T cell malignancy or TRBC2 in the 
 
case of a TRBC2+ malignancy. This will eradicate all cells of the 
malignant clone but will leave a substantial proportion of the T cell 
 
compartment intact.

Targeting the T cell receptor β-chain constant region for 
immunotherapy of T cell malignancies

Mature T cell cancers are typically aggressive, treatment resistant and associated with poor prognosis. Clinical application of 
immunotherapeutic approaches has been limited by a lack of target antigens that discriminate malignant from healthy (normal) 
T cells. Unlike B cell depletion, pan–T cell aplasia is prohibitively toxic. We report a new targeting strategy based on the mutually 
exclusive expression of T cell receptor b-chain constant domains 1 and 2 (TRBC1 and TRBC2). We identify an antibody with 
unique TRBC1 specificity and use it to demonstrate that normal and virus-specific T cell populations contain both TRBC1+ and 
TRBC2+ compartments, whereas malignancies are restricted to only one. As proof of concept for anti-TRBC immunotherapy, we 
developed anti-TRBC1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which recognized and killed normal and malignant TRBC1+, but 
not TRBC2+, T cells in vitro and in a disseminated mouse model of leukemia. Unlike nonselective approaches targeting the entire 
T cell population, TRBC-targeted immunotherapy could eradicate a T cell malignancy while preserving sufficient normal T cells to 
maintain cellular immunity.

In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish 
between TCRs with TRBC1 and TRBC2 (TRBC1- and TRBC2-TCRs) 
with an antibody despite their almost identical amino acid sequences 
(Fig. 1c). We show that peripheral blood T cells in healthy subjects 
comprise a mixture of approximately 35% TRBC1+ and 65% TRBC2+ 
cells and that complete depletion of either the TRBC1+ or TRBC2+ 
T cell compartment still results in the maintenance of a consider-
able antiviral repertoire. We confirm TRBC monoclonality in many 
types of T cell malignancies by both flow cytometry and immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC). Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a 
 
CAR T cell therapy with TRBC1 specificity to prove the validity of 
our targeting concept.
RESULTS
JOVI-1 monoclonal antibody is specific for TRBC1-expressing 
cells
To find a TRBC-specific binder, we screened anti-TCR monoclonal 
antibodies that were known to bind a proportion of T cells in periph-
eral blood. In order to screen for TRBC1 versus TRBC2 specificity, 
we cloned the sequence encoding the α and β chains of the well-
characterized HA-1 TCR16 either in its wild-type format encoding 
TRBC2 or with mutations mapping to its constant domain to yield 
TRBC1 instead. We stably expressed either TCR on the surface of the 
Jurkat T cell line in which the TCR α- and β-chain loci are knocked 
out (JKO). Analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that, although 
both TRBC1-JKO and TRBC2-JKO lines expressed surface TCR–CD3 
complex, the JOVI-1 monoclonal antibody17 recognized only TRBC1-
JKO cells and not TRBC2-JKO cells (Fig. 1d), confirming the TRBC1 
specificity of this antibody. In surface plasmon resonance analysis, 
JOVI-1 bound to the TRBC1-TCR with an affinity of KD = 0.42 nM 
and a half-life of ~30 min, in line with the parameters for other thera-
peutic antibodies18. In contrast, JOVI-1 binding to the TRBC2-TCR 
was >10,000-fold weaker, demonstrating the remarkable specificity 
of this reagent (Supplementary Fig. 1).
TCR β-chain junctional regions segregate with constant domains: 
TCRs selecting TRBJ1-1 through TRBJ1-6 use TRBC1, and those 
selecting TRBJ2-1 through TRBJ2-7 use TRBC2 (ref. 13). Therefore, 
it is possible that JOVI-1 only maintains specificity for TRBC1 in the 
context of particular junctional regions. We cloned the sequences for 
several TCRs with varying antigen specificity, utilizing a range of vari-
able and junctional regions, from publicly available sequences. When 
these sequences were transfected into HEK-293T cells along with a 
plasmid supplying the components of CD3, TCRs were expressed 
on the cell surface. JOVI-1 uniformly recognized TRBC1+ cells in 
spite of varying TRBJ1 regions and did not recognize cells express-
ing TRBC2-TCRs with varying TRBJ2 regions (Fig. 1e). In addition,

we cloned the sequence for a truncated TCR lacking α- and β-chain 
V(D)J domains and stably expressed it on the surface of JKO cells. 
CD3 staining confirmed cell-surface assembly of the truncated TCR, 
and staining with JOVI-1 was similar to that seen for the full-length 
TCR (Fig. 1f). This offers further confirmation that specific junc-
tional regions are not required for the JOVI-1 epitope.
We then sought to determine the residues of the TRBC domains 
responsible for the TRBC1 specificity of JOVI-1. Structural analysis 
suggested that Phe36 in TRBC1 (Tyr36 in TRBC2) is buried in second-
ary structure and Val113 (Glu113) is likely too close to the membrane to 
be accessible. However, Asn4 and Lys5 are exposed to the surface, and 
alteration of these residues to Lys4 and Asn5 in TRBC2 results in a sub-
stantial difference in both the shape and charge of the epitope relative to 
TRBC1. By introducing each mutation required to convert TRBC2 to 
TRBC1 individually and then stably expressing these constructs on the 
surface of JKO cells, we confirmed that residues 4 and 5 indeed consti-
tute the discriminating portion of the JOVI-1 epitope (Fig. 1f,g).
Normal ab T cell populations contain a mixture of TRBC1+ and 
TRBC1− cells
Using JOVI-1, we next sought to determine the proportion of T cells 
from healthy donors that were TRBC1+ versus TRBC2+. Each donor 
had TCR+TRBC1+ and TCR+TRBC1− cells in both their CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cell compartments; the median percentage of total T cells 
expressing TRBC1 was 35% (range, 25–47%; Fig. 2a,b). We also con-
firmed that all CD4+ and CD8+ differentiation subsets contained both 
populations, with TRBC1:TRBC2 ratios similar to that observed for the 
total T cell population (Supplementary Fig. 2a,d). In addition, we ana-
lyzed two cell types that express a semi-invariant restricted TCR rep-
ertoire: mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs; Supplementary 
Fig. 2b,d) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs; Supplementary 
Fig. 2c,d). We found that these populations also contained 
 
both TRBC1+ and TRBC1− cells, albeit with a lower proportion of 
TRBC1+ cells than that seen in bulk T cell populations.
Although the polyclonal T cell population in normal donors con-
tained both TRBC1+ and TRBC2+ cells, we reasoned that the T cell 
response to a particular virus might be skewed toward one of these 
subpopulations and that removal of one subset could therefore result 
in loss of cellular immunity. To determine whether this was the case, 
we generated oligoclonal Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic 
T cell lines (CTLs) using cells from three healthy donors, as previously 
described19 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). These cells lysed autologous 
EBV-transformed cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Staining revealed 
that >98% of the cells were CD8+ (data not shown) and they consti-
tuted a mixed population of TRBC1+ and TRBC1− cells (median, 
45% TRBC1+; Supplementary Fig. 3c), demonstrating that the T cell 
response to EBV involves both subpopulations (Fig. 2c). In addition, 
we identified T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adeno-
virus (AdV) through incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) with pools of antigenic peptides. Virus-specific T cell 
populations, identified by interferon (IFN)-γ expression after peptide 
incubation (Supplementary Fig. 3d), were found to contain both 
TRBC1+ and TRBC1− cells (Fig. 2d). Summary data from healthy 
donors revealed a median TRBC1 positivty of 45% (CMV specific) 
and 41% (AdV specific) among the virus-specific T cells (Fig. 2e).
T cell–malignancy-derived cell lines and primary T cell cancers 
are clonally TRBC1+ or TRBC1−
Cell lines with cell-surface expression of TCR were stained with JOVI-
1 and found to be either TRBC1+ (H9, Jurkat, MJ) or TRBC1− (HD-
Mar2, HPB-ALL, T-ALL1, HH). TRBC1 versus TRBC2 expression 
was confirmed at the transcript level through PCR amplification of 
the β-chain constant region from cDNA followed by Sanger sequenc-
ing (Fig. 3a). These data confirm JOVI-1 as a marker of TRBC1 mon-
oclonality in cell lines. Next, using multiparameter flow cytometry, 
we analyzed primary blood samples from several individuals with T 
cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), a TCR+ lympho-
proliferative disorder characterized by circulating cancer cells that 
express CD57 (ref. 20). Whereas CD57+ malignant cells demonstrated 
markedly skewed TRBC1:TRBC2 ratios, normal CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells displayed normal ratios for these populations (Fig. 3b). Using 
intracellular staining, we replicated this finding in primary bone mar-
row samples of T-ALL (Fig. 3c). Further, using fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting (FACS) or IHC on frozen tissue sections, we stained a 
number of primary samples of TCR+ malignancies of multiple histolo-
gies and confirmed that TRBC1 staining could be used to determine 
whether cancer cells were clonally TRBC1+ or TRBC1− (Fig. 3d,e). 
Of 57 samples (38 analyzed by IHC, 19 analyzed by FACS), 39% were 
TRBC1+ and 61% were TRBC1− (Table 1). Of note, TCR–CD3 com-
plex expression assayed by FACS in primary malignancies was typi-
cally at a level similar to that in normal T cells from the same subject 
(median MFI (median fluorescence intensity) = 96% of normal T 
cell MFI), other than in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), in 
which expression was typically weaker than in normal T cells (median 
MFI = 23% of normal T cell MFI; Fig. 3f).
T cells transduced to express anti-TRBC1 CAR specifically 
target TRBC1+ and not TRBC2+ cells in vitro
We cloned the sequence for a single-chain variable fragment based 
on the JOVI-1 epitope into a third-generation CAR format21 as 
a proof of concept for therapies targeting TRBC. We retrovirally 
transduced T cells from healthy donors to stably express this con-
struct and confirmed surface expression of CAR on up to 90% of 
cells (Fig. 4a). We subsequently co-cultured nontransduced (NT) or

anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells with NT-JKO, TRBC1-JKO or TRBC2-JKO 
cells. Whereas NT effectors did not secrete IFN-γ in response to any 
target cells, anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells specifically secreted IFN-γ only 
when incubated with TRBC1-JKO and not NT-JKO or TRBC2-JKO 
cells (Fig. 4b,c). In 4-h chromium-release cytotoxicity assays, NT 
effector cells did not display cytotoxicity, whereas anti-TRBC1 CAR 
T cells specifically killed TRBC1-JKO and not NT-JKO or TRBC2-
JKO cells (Fig. 4d,e).
In addition, we performed flow cytometric cytotoxicity assays using 
multiple αβ TCR+ cell lines as targets and confirmed killing of cells 
expressing TRBC1-TCRs, but not TRBC2-TCRs, by anti-TRBC1 
CAR T cells, whereas NT T cells did not lyse either (Fig. 4f). Next, to 
simulate a physiological setting, we mixed TRBC1-JKO cells labeled 
with CD19 marker with TRBC2-JKO cells labeled with blue fluores-
cent protein (BFP) in a 1:1 ratio. This population was co-cultured 
with anti-TRBC1 CAR or NT T cells. Analysis 48 h later confirmed 
eradication of TRBC1+ cells with preservation of TRBC2+ cells by 
anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells, whereas no killing of either population was 
seen with NT effectors (Fig. 4g).
We obtained primary malignant cells from multiple individuals 
with TRBC1+ T cell malignancies. We co-cultured subject-derived 
neoplastic cells with NT or anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells in a 1:1 ratio. 
Using allogeneic T cells, we found specific killing of malignant cells 
in cases of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) and PTCL-
NOS with preservation of a substantial proportion of normal T cells 
 
(Fig. 4h). Malignant cell killing was seen even in cases of ATLL (Fig. 4i,l) 
 
in which TCR–CD3 complex was partially downregulated from the 
cell surface (Fig. 3f). In addition, we successfully transduced T cells 
from an individual with TRBC1+ malignancy (ATLL) despite a heavy 
burden of circulating ATLL cells (Fig. 4j), resulting in the T cell prod-
uct being ‘purged’ of contaminating ATLL cells (Fig. 4k) through 
the specific killing of autologous ATLL cells by anti-TRBC1 CAR T 
cells (Fig. 4l).
Anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells selectively deplete normal TRBC1+, 
but not TRBC2+, cells 
Following transduction of healthy donor T cells with virus encoding 
anti-TRBC1 CAR, no TRBC1+ cells could be detected in either the 
transduced or NT fractions, indicating possible depletion of this pop-
ulation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). However, we reasoned that absence 
of TRBC1 staining was likely due to epitope blocking by ligated anti-
TRBC1 CAR. Therefore, we transduced cells to express anti-TRBC1 
CAR and the CD34 marker22. This enabled sorting of cells into CAR+ 
and CAR− fractions using CD34 MicroBead magnetic depletion. We

confirmed depletion of all CAR+ cells in the negative fraction, thus 
excluding any effect of epitope blockade by CAR. Although NT cells 
contained both TRBC1+ and TRBC1− fractions, the CAR− fraction 
of transduced cells did not contain any TRBC1+ cells, confirming 
selective depletion of TRBC1+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Further, 
we sorted healthy donor T cells into TRBC1+ and TRBC1− popula-
tions using magnetic beads. We subsequently separately labeled each 
population with different fluorescent nuclear dyes, enabling later 
discrimination of the populations, and co-cultured them with 
autologous NT or anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells. Whereas TRBC2+ cells 
co-cultured with anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells were not depleted as com-
pared to the NT condition, 80% of all TRBC1+ cells were gone at 7 d 
 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c), indicating selective purging of this popula-
tion. This was confirmed in a further assay in which TRBC1+ cells 
were mixed with TRBC2+ cells in a 1:2 ratio (the physiological condi-
tion) before 1:1 co-culture with NT or anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells. After 
7 d of co-culture, virtually all of the TRBC1+ cells had been depleted 
from the culture, whereas TRBC2+ cells remained (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 4d). Finally, to test a strategy to further mitigate potential trans-
duction of contaminating TRBC1+ cancer cells, we predepleted 
TRBC1+ cells from healthy donor T cells to obtain a population of 
cells that was >99% TRBC1− (Supplementary Fig. 4e) for which we 
achieved transduction with viruses encoding anti-TRBC1 CAR simi-
lar to that achieved for unsorted cells (Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells are specific and effective in mouse 
models of disseminated T cell malignancy
NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) mice were intravenously injected with 
Jurkat T cells, which natively express TRBC1-TCR at a level similar 
to that in primary malignant and normal T cells (Fig. 3f). Jurkat cells 
were modified to stably express firefly luciferase (FLuc) and the CD19 
marker, and were stably engrafted in the bone marrow of all injected 
animals by day 6 (Fig. 5a,b). Following engraftment, we treated mice 
with T cells expressing anti-TRBC1 CAR or an irrelevant control 
CAR. Mice treated with anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells had a dramatic 
reduction of Jurkat cell burden by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at 
day 10 after injection (Fig. 5b,c), and this reduction was associated 
with a substantial survival benefit. In an additional experiment evalu-
ating CAR persistence (Fig. 5e), we observed Jurkat cell clearance and 
increased numbers of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells versus control CAR T 
cells in peripheral blood at day 21 following T cell injection (Fig. 5f). 
 
Bone marrow was collected at the time of death (survivors killed at 
day 42), and similar results were obtained (Fig. 5g).
Next, we injected another cohort of mice with equal proportions of 
TRBC1-expressing Jurkat cells (TRBC1-Jurkat; also expressing human 
CD19 marker) and JKO cells engineered to express TRBC2-TCR and 
BFP marker. Jurkat cell engraftment in bone marrow was confirmed 
in all mice through BLI at day 6. Mice were then treated with NT or 
anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells. Flow cytometry of bone marrow confirmed 
the TRBC1 specificity of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells in vivo: mice that 
received NT effectors had approximately equal proportions of TRBC1-
Jurkat and TRBC2-JKO cells, whereas only TRBC2-JKO cells were 
seen in the recipients of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells (Fig. 5e,f).
Finally, in order to determine whether anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells 
would be able to deplete TRBC1-Jurkat cells in a physiological setting 
(i.e., in the presence of normal T cells), we engrafted NSG mice with 
Jurkat cells expressing CD19 and FLuc as before. After 7 d, mice were 
injected with human PBMCs (Supplementary Fig. 5a). After an addi-
tional 7 d, human monocyte and T cell engraftment was confirmed 
by flow cytometry of peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. 5b), 
and progressive disease was demonstrated by BLI (Supplementary 
Fig. 5c). Mice were then injected with anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells or 
control CAR T cells using cells prepared from the same donor as the 
initial PBMCs. BLI and flow cytometry of bone marrow at 5 d fol-
lowing treatment demonstrated Jurkat cell control in the recipients of 
anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells but progression in those receiving control 
CAR T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). Flow cytometry analysis of 
bone marrow (Supplementary Fig. 5e) and spleen (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 5f) at day 6 following treatment demonstrated that similar num-
bers of non-CAR T cells were present in the recipients of anti-TRBC1 
and control CAR T cells, confirming the persistence of normal T cells 
in the face of Jurkat cell depletion.
DISCUSSION
The presence of two functionally identical genes in the locus for the 
TCR β-chain constant region has been recognized for more than 30 
years14,15 but, to our knowledge, has not been exploited until now. 
 
We have demonstrated that it is possible to discriminate between 
TRBC1 and TRBC2 domains on normal and malignant T cells, despite 
their highly similar amino acid sequences. Indeed, JOVI-1 showed a 
>10,000-fold difference in binding affinity for the two, with specificity 
based on the identity of only two residues in the TRBC sequences. 
 
Consistent with previous findings, we have shown that approximately 
two-thirds of both normal T cells23,24 and cells from T cell malignan-
cies25 express TRBC2-TCR.
We believe that TRBC1 or TRBC2 targeting has considerable poten-
tial as an immunotherapy for T cell malignancies. The principle of 
using immunotherapy to target a rearranged clone-specific recep-
tor is not new: Stevenson and colleagues26,27 pioneered the use of 
patient-specific anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies against neoplas-
tic lymphoma cells. However, this approach is impracticable because it 
requires a new binder to be generated for each patient. An analogous 
approach to ours, namely treating B cell cancers through specific tar-
geting of antibody light chain, has also been proposed28.
Patients with B cell malignancies have greatly benefited from the 
advent of potent immunotherapies. Treatment of B cell malignancies 
with anti-CD19 CAR T cells has been one of the most important recent 
advances in the treatment of cancer: sustained remissions have been 
obtained in most patients with advanced and refractory B-ALL6,29, as 
well as impressive though lesser responses in chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia7,30 and diffuse large B cell lymphoma7. Given the relatively similar 
presentation and nature of B and T cell malignancies, CAR T cells could 
potentially have similar value in treating T cell lymphomas.

However, anti-CD19 CAR T cell efficacy is accompanied by loss 
of the normal B cell compartment6,7. Although this is relatively well 
tolerated and the impact can be lessened by infusion of donor-derived 
pooled immunoglobulins, analogously targeting a pan–T cell antigen 
on a T cell malignancy (with concomitant permanent loss of normal 
T cells) would be prohibitively toxic, with no mitigating replacement 
therapies available.
Approaches using CARs against T cell targets such as the pan–T cell 
antigens CD5 (ref. 31) or CD4, which are present on a crucial subset 
of normal T cells32, have been proposed but may prove unaccept-
ably immunosuppressive in clinical use. With our approach, a patient 
treated with anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells would retain approximately two-
thirds of their normal T cells, with polyclonal antiviral immunity likely 
preserved. In addition, the potential for ‘on-target, off-tumor’ toxicity 
affecting other tissues would be negligible, given the restriction of TCR 
expression to mature T and NKT cells. However, with any approach 
targeting T cells rather than B cells, increased cytokine-mediated 
toxicity could occur owing to lysis of normal tissue-resident T cells 
and subsequent mediator release. Another potential consequence of 
depletion of part of the regulatory T cell repertoire could be loss of 
some peripheral tolerance if the T regulatory cells protecting a par-
ticular tissue are particularly skewed toward expressing TRBC1 or 
TRBC2. However, ultimately, the toxicities associated with depletion of 
TRBC1+ or TRBC2+ cells could only be examined in a clinical trial.
In summary, we have demonstrated a new approach to the inves-
tigation and targeting of T cell malignancies through distinguishing 
between two possible TCR β-chain constant regions. Using CAR T 
cells targeting one constant region, we have demonstrated proof of 
concept. Exploration of the distribution of constant region usage by 
unselected normal T cells and those providing specific viral immunity 
suggests that such an approach would not lead to clinically important 
immunosuppression. We hope that this approach heralds the applica-
tion of potent targeted immunotherapeutics to provide much needed 
enhancement in the treatment of T cell malignancies.

Cell lines. HEK-293T and K562 cell lines were cultured in Iscove’s modified 
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% 
FBS (HyClone, GE, Buckinghamshire, UK) and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen, 
CA). Jurkat, Jurkat TCR-knockout (and engineered variants), HD-Mar2, HPB-
ALL, T-ALL1, and CCRF-CEM cells (all of  T-ALL origin) and H9, MJ and HH 
cells (all of Sézary syndrome origin) were cultured in complete RPMI (RPMI-1640, 
Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM GlutaMAX). 
Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 
All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma and for cell-surface expression 
of target antigens. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen 
(DSMZ) or Public Heath England collections. Jurkat TCR-knockout cells were a 
kind gift from the laboratory of H. Stauss (University College London).
Cloning, expression and purification of TCR protein. The C5861 TCR express-
ing a TRBC2 domain33 and the ILA1 TCR expressing a TRBC1 domain34, con-
structed using a disulfide-linked construct, were used to produce the soluble 
α- and β-chain domains (variable and constant) for each TCR. Sequences encod-
ing the TCR α and β chains were inserted into separate pGMT7 expression plas-
mids under the control of a T7 promoter. Competent Rosetta DE3 Escherichia 
coli cells (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used to produce the C5861 and 
ILA1 TCRs in the form of inclusion bodies using 0.5 M IPTG to induce expres-
sion. Soluble C5861 and ILA1 TCRs were refolded as previously described33, 
purified by anion exchange (Poros 50HQ, Life Technologies, Cheshire, UK) 
and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (S200 GR, GE Healthcare, 
Buckinghamshire, UK).
Surface plasmon resonance analysis. Binding analysis was performed using 
a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) equipped with a CM5 
sensor chip as previously reported35. Briefly, 500–1,000 response units (RUs) 
of JOVI-1 antibody was linked by amine coupling to the chip surface. For the 
C5861 TRBC2-TCR, ten serial dilutions were injected over the immobilized 
JOVI-1 antibody and equilibrium binding analysis was performed. Equilibrium 
binding constant (KD (E)) values were calculated assuming a 1:1 interaction by 
plotting specific equilibrium-binding responses against protein concentrations, 
followed by nonlinear least squares fitting using the Langmuir binding equation. 
For the ILA1 TRBC1-TCR, single kinetic injections were performed. For kinet-
ics analysis, Kon and Koff values were calculated assuming 1:1 Langmuir binding 
and the data were analyzed using a global fit algorithm (BIAevaluation 3.1).
Cell staining and flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD 
LSR Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences, NJ). FACS sorting was performed 
using a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences, NJ). Staining steps were performed 
at room temperature for 20 min with PBS washes between steps. For stain-
ing of intracellular antigens, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 100 µl of 
Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, NJ) for 5 min before staining, and wash 
steps were performed using Perm/Wash (BD Biosciences, NJ). The following 
antibodies were used (all anti-human unless otherwise specified; clone IDs 
are given in parentheses): CD2 (TS1/8), CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (OKT4), CD5 
(UCHT2), CD7 (CD7-6B7), CD8 (SK1), human and murine CD11b (M1/70), 
CD14 (M5E2), CD19 (HIB19), CD25 (BC96), CD45 (HI30), CD45RA (HI100), 
CD56 (HCD56), CD57 (HCD57), CCR7 (GO43H7) and αβ TCR (T10B9), all 
from BioLegend (San Diego, CA); CD34 (Qbend10, R&D Systems, Oxford, UK); 
TRBC1 (JOVI-1, Ansell, Bayport, MN); and fixable viability dye (eBioscience, 
Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Anti-TRBC1 CAR expression was detected by 
staining for the RQR8 marker22 with anti-CD34 or by staining directly for the 
CAR single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with goat anti-murine Fab. All anti-
bodies other than JOVI-1 were validated by the manufacturer for diagnostic use. 
At least 5,000 target events were acquired per sample. Analyses were conducted 
using FlowJo v10 (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
Healthy donors and viral peptide stimulation assays. Approval for this study 
was obtained from the National Research Ethics Service, Research Ethics 
Committee 4 (REC, reference number 09/H0715/64). All healthy donors pro-
vided informed consent.
PBMCs from unselected healthy donors were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE 
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) gradient centrifugation and were resus-
pended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 1 ml of complete medium in the wells of a 24-
well plate. Overlapping peptide pools (15-mers with 11-residue overlaps) 
 
derived from commonly immunogenic viral proteins were obtained from JPT 
Technologies (Berlin, Germany). The viruses investigated (protein antigens in 
parentheses) were CMV (pp65) and AdV (hexon and penton). Peptide pools 
were supplied as dried pellets with 25 µg per peptide and were reconstituted in 
50 µl of DMSO. To obtain a final concentration of 1 µg/ml for each peptide, 2 µl 
 
of each peptide pool was added to each well of PBMCs.
After an initial incubation for 1 h, brefeldin A (BD Biosciences, NJ) was 
added to prevent Golgi transport. After a further 14 h of culture, cells were 
washed and surface staining for CD4 and CD8 was performed. Cells were then 
fixed and permeablilized before staining with JOVI-1, anti-CD3 and anti-IFN-
γ antibodies. Cells were next resuspended for FACS analysis. Viable cells were 
identified by exclusion of viability dye. Negative-control peptide pool (actin, a 
ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein) and a positive-control condition (PMA + iono-
mycin; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) were included. Low-frequency 
virus-specific T cells were identified by intracellular IFN-γ expression; the posi-
tive response threshold was set as >0.01% above negative-control staining.
Identification of T cell differentiation subsets and mucosal-associated 
invariant T cells in normal donor peripheral blood. Cells were defined as 
naive (CD45RA+CD45RO−CCR7−CD62L−), central memory (CD45RA−CD
45RO+CCR7+CD62L+), effector memory (CD45RA−CD45RO+CCR7−CD62
L−) or effector (CD45RA−CD45RO+CCR7+CD62L+) or as T regulatory cells 
(CD4+FOXP3+CD25+). MAITs were identified as CD3+CD8+CD4−CD161+ cells 
positive for TCR α-chain variable region 7.2 (Vα7.2+).
Invariant natural killer T cell isolation. PBMCs were isolated from blood bags 
obtained from healthy donors (Welsh Blood Service) using standard density 
gradient centrifugation. iNKT cells were purified from PBMCs by magnetic 
separation using anti-iNKT-TCR beads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. The purified cell fraction was subsequently 
expanded with phytohemagglutinin and allogeneic irradiated feeders from three 
donors. After a minimum of 14 d following expansion, cells were phenotyped 
and used in functional assays.
The Molt-3 cell line (endogenously expressing CD1d) was pulsed overnight 
with 100 ng/ml α-galactosylceramide (αGalCer; Sigma). iNKT lines were sub-
sequently co-incubated with Molt-3 cells pulsed with αGalCer for 5 h in the 
presence of monensin, brefeldin A and anti-CD107a antibody (all from BD 
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. iNKT lines were 
also incubated with medium only and with Molt-3 cells pulsed with vehicle 
only (DMSO). iNKTs were identified by upregulation of CD107a and IFN-γ in 
response to Molt-3 cells pulsed with αGalCer.
Retroviral transduction of T cells. RD114-pseudotyped supernatant was gener-
ated as follows. HEK-293T cells were transfected with vector plasmid; RDF, an 
expression plasmid to supply RD114 envelope (a gift from M. Collins, University 
College London); and PeqPam-env, a Gag-Pol expression plasmid (a gift from E. 
Vanin, Baylor College of Medicine). Transfection was facilitated using GeneJuice 
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). PBMC transductions were performed as follows. 
T cells from normal donors were isolated by Ficoll (GE, Buckinghamshire, UK) 
gradient centrifugation and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, 
Darmstadt, Germany) at 5 mg/ml. IL-2 (GenScript, Nanjing, China; 100 IU/ml) 
was added following overnight stimulation. On day 3, T cells were collected, plated 
on retronectin (Takara, Nojihigashi, Japan) with retroviral supernatant, and cen-
trifuged at 1,000g for 40 min. Transduction efficiency was determined on days 6–7 
following initial collection, and further experiments were commenced on days 
7–10 following initial collection. PBMCs were maintained in complete RPMI.
Generation and cytotoxicity assessment of Epstein–Barr virus–specific CTLs. 
EBV-specific CTLs were generated as previously described19. Briefly, PBMCs 
from a normal donor were infected with EBV, resulting in B cell transformation 
to produce immortalized lymphoblastoid cells. These cells were irradiated and 
used as target cells to stimulate untransformed PBMCs from the same donor,

selectively expanding EBV-specific CTLs over a 23-d period. The cytotoxicity 
of EBV-specific CTLs against the K562 cell line (an erythroleukemia cell line 
with loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression) and 
allogeneic and autologous lymphoblastoid cells was assessed using standard 4-h 
chromium-release cytotoxicity assays as previously described36.
Preparation and staining of primary cancer samples for flow cytometry 
or immunohistochemistry. Approval for this study was obtained from the 
National Research Ethics Service, Research Ethics Committee 4 (REC reference 
number 09/H0715/64). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For 
flow cytometry, PBMCs from subjects with T cell malignancies were obtained 
from whole blood or bone marrow samples by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, 
Buckinghamshire, UK) gradient centrifugation before staining and analysis as 
described above. Gating strategies to identify malignant and normal T cells were 
determined on a subject-specific basis according to data previously obtained 
by primary clinical laboratories. For IHC analysis, fresh biopsy samples from 
subjects with a range of T cell malignancies (Fig. 3f) were snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and tissue sections were prepared according to standard methodology. 
The investigated antibodies included mouse monoclonal anti-TCRβ1 (clone 
JOVI.1; Ancell Corporation, Bayport, MN) and mouse monoclonal anti-TCRβ 
F1 (clone 8A3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The antibodies 
were assessed under different conditions (i.e., dilution and antigen retrieval pro-
tocol), and the dilutions chosen that showed selective, background-free reaction 
in fresh tissue sections of human reactive tonsils ( n = 2) used as a positive control 
were 1:5,000 for the JOVI.1 antibody and 1:50 for the anti-TCRβ F1 antibody. 
 
The staining procedure was performed using the Roche/Ventana BenchMark 
Ultra autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Counterstaining was 
performed using H&E and bluing reagent from Roche/Ventana; slides were 
mounted with coverslips and air-dried.
Chromium-release cytotoxicity assays. Standard 4-h chromium-release cytotoxic-
ity assays were performed as previously described36, with all assays performed in 
triplicate. NK cell depletion was performed before assays using CD56 magnetic 
bead depletion and LD columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
FACS-based co-culture and cytotoxicity assays. Target and effector cells were 
resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium. 50–100 µl of each cell 
suspension was added to the wells of a V-bottom 96-well plate to achieve a 1:1 
effector:target ratio, with 50,000 or 100,000 targets per well. For some experi-
ments, target cells were prelabeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester 
(CFSE) or CellTrace Violet (CTV; both Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The plate was placed in a standard cell culture 
incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 24 h, the plate was spun down at 
400g for 5 min and 100 µl of supernatant was removed for cytokine assays and 
replaced with fresh complete medium. At 48 h or 7 d, the plate was spun down 
at 400g for 5 min and supernatant was decanted. 100 µl of staining cocktail (with 
appropriate antibodies and viability dye (eBioscience, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, 
MA) diluted in PBS) was added, and cells were stained for 20 min in the dark at 
room temperature. Wells were then washed with an additional 100 µl of PBS and 
spun down at 400g for 5 min. Supernatant was decanted. Counting beads (Flow-
Check Fluorospheres, BD Biosciences, NJ) were washed in PBS and resuspended 
at 1 × 106 beads/ml in PBS. 100 µl of PBS/counting bead mixture was added to 
each cell (10,000 beads/well). 2,000 beads were acquired per sample. Gating on 
single live target cells was performed according to exclusion of fixable viability 
dye, forward and side scatter characteristics, and expression of fluorescent protein, 
marker gene or fluorescent dye. Assays were performed in triplicate. Percentage 
cytotoxicity was calculated as 10,000 / number of beads collected × number of 
target cells at end of culture / number of target cells at start of culture × 100.
For primary cancer cell killing experiments, allogeneic T cells from a healthy 
donor were typically used as effectors, other than in Figure 4j–l, in which autolo-
gous T cells from the same donor of target cancer cells were used. Bespoke 
gating strategies were used to identify normal and malignant T cells in each 
subject sample.
Cell sorting with magnetic bead selection. Transduced T cells positive or 
negative for the RQR8 marker gene (encoding a CD34 epitope recognized by 
 
Qbend-10 antibody) were selected by positive or negative bead selection accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, 
Germany) using MS and LD columns, respectively. For selection of TRBC1+ 
and TRBC1− T cells, cells were initially stained with JOVI-1 conjugated with 
biotin and then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads and 
separated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To increase purity, a 
second selection and depletion round was performed.
Mouse models of T cell malignancy. This work was performed under a UK 
Home Office–approved project license and was approved by the University 
College London Biological Services Ethical Review Committee. 6- to 8-week-
old male NSG mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were intravenously 
injected via the tail vein with Jurkat cells, human PBMCs or CAR T cells as 
described in the text. An otherwise identical control CAR targeting B cell matu-
ration antigen (BCMA), which is not expressed in T cell malignancies, was used 
in some experiments as indicated in the text. Tail vein bleeds of 50 µl were under-
taken as indicated in the text. At the time of killing, bone marrow was collected 
in some experiments. Single-cell suspensions were prepared and analyzed for the 
presence of T cells and residual Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. Jurkat cells were 
identified by expression of the CD19 or BFP marker gene according to the experi-
ment. CAR T cells were identified by expression of the RQR8 marker gene.
For experiments with a survival endpoint or engraftment of PBMCs, mice 
were weighed at least twice weekly. Animals with >10% weight loss or those dis-
playing evidence of graft-versus-host disease or disease progression, including 
hunched posture, poor coat condition, reduced mobility, pilorection or hindlimb 
paralysis, were killed.
Bioluminescence imaging of mice was performed using the IVIS system 
(PerkinElmer, Buckinghamshire, UK). Prior to imaging, mice were placed in 
an anesthetic chamber. General anesthesia was induced using inhaled isoflurane. 
Following induction, intraperitoneal injection of luciferin (200 µl via 27-gauge 
needle) was undertaken. After 2 min, mice were placed in the imaging chamber. 
Simultaneous optical and bioluminescence imaging was performed. Anesthesia 
was maintained by continued inhalation of isoflurane during imaging.
Statistical analyses. Unless otherwise noted, data are summarized as mean ± 
s.e.m. Student’s t-test was used to determine statistically significant differences 
between samples for normally distributed variables, and the Mann–Whitney U-
test was used for nonparametrically distributed variables. P < 0.05 (two-tailed) 
indicated a significant difference. Unless otherwise stated, variances were similar 
between study populations. When variances were unequal, Welch’s correction 
for unequal variance was used. Paired analyses were used when appropriate. 
When three or more groups were compared, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s 
test for multiple comparisons with α = 0.05 were used. When multiple t-tests 
were performed, statistical significance was determined using the Holm–Sidak 
method with α = 0.05. Neither randomization nor blinding was done during 
the in vivo study. However, mice were matched based on the luminescent signal 
for control and treatment groups before infusion of control or gene-modified 
T cells. Cohort sizes were based on the number required to demonstrate 90% 
reduction in bioluminescence, 95% confidence with 80% power. Survival curves 
were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method, with hazard ratios calculated 
by the Mantel2Haenszel method. All mouse studies were performed at least 
twice, with data shown from one representative experiment. Graph genera-
tion and statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 7.0b software 
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
Cohort sizes were based on number required to demonstrate 90% reduction in 
tumour bioluminescence, 95% confidence with 80% power.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
No exclusions were pre-specified or included for the survival or specificity studies. 
For the PBMC-engraftment study, animals were excluded (before randomisation) if 
they failed to engraft either tumour or PBMCs. See Supp Fig 4
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
One repeated animal experiment (Jurkat /PBMC engrafment study) failed due to 
death of all animals from GvHD. Other than this experiments were consistent, and 
all data represents either pooled data from multiple independent experiments or 
representative data from one experiment., as indicated.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Neither randomisation nor blinding was done during the in vivo study. However, 
mice were matched based on the tumor signal for control and treatment groups 
before infusion of control or gene-modified T-cells. 
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Blinding was not performed as differences between control/ treated mice were so 
marked that this would have been futile, and manpower issues did not allow this.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars
