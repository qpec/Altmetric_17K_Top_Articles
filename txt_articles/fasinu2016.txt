States and the federal government are under growing pressure to legalize the use of cannabis products
for medical purposes in the United States. Sixteen states have legalized (or decriminalized possession
of) products high in cannabidiol (CBD) and with restricted Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) con-
tent. In most of these states, the intent is for use in refractory epileptic seizures in children, but in a
few states, the indications are broader. This review provides an overview of the pharmacology and tox-
icology of CBD; summarizes some of the regulatory, safety, and cultural issues relevant to the further
exploitation of its antiepileptic or other pharmacologic activities; and assesses the current status and
prospects for clinical development of CBD and CBD-rich preparations for medical use in the United
States. Unlike D9-THC, CBD elicits its pharmacologic effects without exerting any significant intrinsic
activity on the cannabinoid receptors, whose activation results in the psychotropic effects characteristic
of D9-THC, and CBD possesses several pharmacologic activities that give it a high potential for thera-
peutic use. CBD exhibits neuroprotective, antiepileptic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and antiinflammatory
properties. In combination with D9-THC, CBD has received regulatory approvals in several European
countries and is currently under study in trials registered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
in the United States. A number of states have passed legislation to allow for the use of CBD-rich, lim-
ited D9-THC–content preparations of cannabis for certain pathologic conditions. CBD is currently
being studied in several clinical trials and is at different stages of clinical development for various
medical indications. Judging from clinical findings reported so far, CBD and CBD-enriched prepara-
tions have great potential utility, but uncertainties regarding sourcing, long-term safety, abuse poten-
tial, and regulatory dilemmas remain.

For many centuries, Cannabis sativa, along
with other subspecies and varieties—C. sativa,
C. indica, and C. ruderalis—was used in the
treatment of epilepsy.1 Preparations from the
flowers and resins of cannabis have been in use
in China for about 5 millennia, especially for the
management
of
fever,
malaria,
constipation,
absent-mindedness, menstrual disorders, gout,
rheumatism, and pain.2 Arabs have used canna-
bis for similar medicinal purposes since medie-
val
times.
Before
aspirin
was
popularized,
cannabis was a common pain remedy in Western
medicine in the 1800s.1 Its indications have
broadened to include glaucoma, nausea and
vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, and mus-
cle spasms.3

 leaves of the plant are called marijuana. Since
1970, marijuana has been listed as a Schedule I
drug in the United States under the Controlled
Substances Act, a classification that indicated it
as a substance with high abuse potential and
with no currently accepted medical use. This
initial criminalization of marijuana may have
been driven by social and political considera-
tions and not simply due to health or safety rea-
sons. However, the ensuing years have witnessed
the appearance of several research publications
suggesting the potential of cannabis for thera-
peutic benefits in certain pathologic conditions.
This has led to growing pressures for legaliza-
tion of marijuana for medical use in the United
States, with some successes recorded. Currently,
25 states and the District of Columbia have
passed relatively broad so-called medical mari-
juana laws, thus generally making the medical
use of cannabis legal under their state laws.
Although cannabis has been suggested to pos-
sess potential medical benefits in the manage-
ment of pain, spasticity in neurodegenerative
disease, anorexia and wasting syndromes, psy-
chiatric disorders, and epilepsy, concerns relat-
ing to abuse and other deleterious consequences
of smoking marijuana have limited progress in
medical utility.4 Cannabis is known to be addic-
tive, and cannabis withdrawal—the experience
of psychological and physiologic symptoms after
discontinuing heavy and prolonged marijuana
use—is a serious concern. Having been able to
largely identify the compounds responsible for
the psychoactivity of cannabis, the therapeutic
potential of the nonpsychoactive compounds is
being explored.5 The major psychoactive compo-
nent of cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-
THC), whereas cannabidiol (CBD) is the major
and most widely studied of the other con-
stituents. Higher D9-THC-to-CBD ratios are asso-
ciated
with
more
prominent
psychoactivity
(euphoric,
relaxant,
and
anxiogenic
effects),
whereas low ratios of D9-THC to CBD seem to
be more sedating.5 Although CBD is the desired
medical form of cannabis, utilization of extracts
of the plant material generally yields varying
ratios of CBD to THC. Many states have passed
legislation for restricted THC content to mini-
mize the potential abuse liability and adverse
effects. Extracts available from cannabis contain
variable THC amounts depending on the variety
used in the preparation.
Two
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs derived from cannabis
have already been developed based on D9-THC.
The first was dronabinol, which is pure D9-THC
in an oil-filled soft gelatin capsule. The second
was nabilone, a synthetic analog of D9-THC.
Other new pharmaceuticals are in various levels
of development, with an attempt to harness the
therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids while mini-
mizing or eliminating adverse effects.
CBD
has
shown
beneficial
anticonvulsant
properties
through
novel
mechanisms
not
involving the classic cannabinoid receptors, and
many of the adverse effects of D9-THC appear to
be absent.6 A significant amount of preclinical
data
and
supporting
anecdotal
evidence
are
available in humans regarding the effectiveness
of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy and
especially severe seizure syndromes in children
refractory to other antiepileptic drugs. This has
led to the passage of legislation aimed at relax-
ing restrictions on certain preparations of canna-
bis extracts that are low in D9-THC and high in
CBD by a number of states.
This review provides a brief orientation to
CBD and its pharmacology, and it assesses the
current status and prospects for CBD and CBD-
rich preparations for medical use.
Cannabis and Phytocannabinoids
Cannabis is the only genus of the family Can-
nabaceae, and according to many authorities, it
comprises a single but variable species, Cannabis
sativa. Its taxonomy is controversial. Although
some authors designate sativa, indica, and ruder-
alis as subspecies or varieties, others propose
indica and/or ruderalis as distinct species.7 These
have distinct morphologic characteristics and
habitats. Cannabis has been classified more con-
veniently into CBD, intermediate, and D9-THC
chemotypes
corresponding,
respectively,
to
higher, equal, and lower constituent CBD:D9-to-
THC ratios. Thus C. indica, with a higher CBD:
D9-to-THC ratio, typifies the CBD chemotype
and is medically preferred, whereas C. sativa is
seen as a typical D9-THC chemotype.
Cannabis contains more than 500 identified
phytochemical constituents, of which at least
104 are cannabinoids. The term phytocannabi-
noids is used to distinguish the naturally occur-
ring
plant-derived
cannabinoids
from
the
endocannabinoids, which are naturally occurring
lipid-derived
neurotransmitters
found
in
the
human body.8, 9
CBD was first isolated from marijuana extract
in
1940,
but
no
further
major
study
was
reported on it for the next 25 years.8 Its exact
782
PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 36, Number 7, 2016
 chemical structure was elucidated in 1963.10 Ini-
tial studies on cannabinoids concentrated on D9-
THC following the discovery of its responsibility
for the psychotropic activity of smoked canna-
bis.11
The marijuana plant varies in its concentra-
tion of cannabinoids depending on a variety of
factors including the plant part, time of harvest,
and the particular subspecies or strain. In the
plant material, both D9-THC and CBD are in
their acid forms, which are inactive (Figure 1).
During the smoking process, these acids are
converted to the active forms of D9-THC and
CBD.5
Cannabinoid Receptors and the
Endocannabinoid System
It was found that D9-THC mimics the endoge-
nous cannabinoid neurotransmitters by binding
to two G-protein–coupled cell membrane recep-
tors, referred to as the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1)
and
type
2
(CB2)
receptors,
to
exert
its
pharmacologic effects.11
Although the CB1 receptors are found primar-
ily in the brain and in several peripheral tissues,
the CB2 receptors are mainly concentrated in
immune and hematopoietic cells.12 CB1 recep-
tors are located at presynaptic junctions where
they are involved in the regulation of ion chan-
nels and modulation of the release of dopamin-
ergic,
c-aminobutyric
acid
(GABA),
glutama
tergic, serotoninergic, adrenergic, and choliner-
gic neurotransmitters.13 Although agonists at
CB1 receptors usually effect inhibition of neuro-
transmitter release in the affected cell, there may
actually be an increased neurotransmitter release
from adjacent neurons due to a lack of an inhi-
bitory signal.14
Endocannabinoids were discovered that bind
to these receptors and others under physiologic
and pathologic conditions; these are a class of
endogenously synthesized lipid-signaling mole-
cules, whose prototypes are anandamide (N-
arachidonyl ethanolamide) and 2-arachidonoyl
glycerol (2-AG). The endocannabinoid system
(ECS)
thus
consists
of
these
endogenous
ligands, the CB receptors, transporter proteins,

 and synthetic and degradative enzymes. The
ECS functionally impacts synaptic communica-
tion with direct modulatory effects on pain
perception, eating, anxiety, learning, memory,
and growth and development in the central
nervous
system,
as
well
as
motor
control,
immunocompetency,
tumor
cell
proliferation,
and inflammation.15 The ECS can be dramati-
cally modulated by a number of conditions
such
as
stress,
food
intake,
and
behavioral
manipulations. The endocannabinoids may also
exert effects via non-CB receptors as well, such
as through certain serotonin or vanilloid recep-
tor subtypes.12
Pharmacology of Cannabidiol
CBD, unlike D9-THC, does not activate the
CB1 and CB2 receptors, which probably accounts
for its lack of psychotropic activity. It exerts its
pharmacologic effects through multiple mecha-
nisms. At very low (nanomolar to micromolar)
concentrations, it blocks the orphan G-protein–
coupled receptor GPR55, the equilibrative nucle-
oside transporter, and the transient receptor
potential of the melastatin type 8 (TRPM8)
channel.6 It enhances the activity of the sero-
tonin 5-HT1a receptor, the a1 and a3 glycine
receptors, and the transient receptor potential of
ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) channel, with a bidirec-
tional effect on intracellular calcium (in which
case, it causes a slight increase in intracellular
calcium under normal physiologic calcium con-
ditions;
in
high-excitability
conditions,
it
reduces intracellular calcium).6
At higher concentrations, CBD has been demon-
strated to activate the nuclear peroxisome prolifera-
tor-activated receptor-c (PPAR-c) and the transient
receptor potential of vanilloid types 1 (TRPV1) and
2 (TRPV2) channels.12 It inhibits cellular uptake
and fatty acid amide hydrolase–catalyzed degrada-
tion of N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamide.12 CBD also
has potent antioxidant properties,possiblyduetoits
polyphenolicnature.
The ability of CBD potentially to reduce the
psychoactivity
of
D9-THC,
thereby
revealing
other beneficial effects of D9-THC, was also
reported.16 By inhibiting the D9-THC-induced
activation of CB1, CBD reduces the propensity
for psychotic symptoms when cannabis users
consume preparations with high CBD:D9-to-THC
ratios.16 This may relate to the ability of CBD to
modulate
the
cytochrome
P450
(CYP)
2C–dependent metabolism of D9-THC to the
more psychoactive 11-hydroxy derivative. At
high doses, CBD may also interfere with the
CB1-mediated
effects
of
D9-THC
and
its
11-hydroxy metabolite.
Pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol
CBD has been delivered by oral administra-
tion,
by
inhalation
(smoking),
and
through
vaporization.
Traditionally
delivered
through
inhalation as a constituent of smoked cannabis,
CBD is effectively taken up in the lungs by the
circulating blood. Aerosolized CBD has been
reported to yield rapid peak plasma concentra-
tions in 5–10 minutes and ~31% bioavailabil-
ity.17 The need for specialized equipment and
patient cooperation with administration limit the
development and promotion of this delivery
route.
Oral delivery of an oil-based capsule formula-
tion of CBD has been assessed in humans. Prob-
ably due to its poor aqueous solubility, the
absorption of CBD from the gastrointestinal tract
is erratic, and the resulting pharmacokinetic
profile is variable. Bioavailability from oral deliv-
ery was estimated to be 6% due to significant
first-pass metabolism.18 Bioavailability from oral-
mucosal and sublingual routes are less variable
but similar to oral delivery.
Following
a
daily
administration
of
CBD
10 mg/kg in 15 neuroleptic-free patients for
6 weeks, one group reported a weekly mean
CBD plasma level ranging from 5.9–11 ng/ml.19
CBD is rapidly distributed into the tissues
with a high volume of distribution of ~32 L/
kg.20 It may preferentially accumulate in adipose
tissues due to its high lipophilicity. It is highly
bound to plasma proteins and circulating blood
cells.18 CBD undergoes CYP3A- and CYP2C-
dependent phase I metabolism to 7-hydroxy-
CBD, which is further metabolized and excreted,
more in feces and to a lesser extent in urine.
CBD has an estimated terminal half-life of 18–
32 hours and a clearance of 57.6–93.6 L/hour.18
Although clinical studies on the ability of
CBD to interact with other drugs have not been
conducted exhaustively, CBD has shown potent
inhibitory activity against CYP2C, CYP2D6, and
CYP3A isoforms in preclinical studies, raising
concerns of drug–drug interactions with other
substrates of the enzymes.21, 22
In a drug–drug interaction study between
CBD and clobazam, a CYP2C19 substrate, 25
children
with
refractory
epilepsy
were
784
PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 36, Number 7, 2016
 administered CBD and clobazam concurrently.23
CBD caused a greater than 60% and a 500%
increase in mean plasma levels of clobazam and
its
major
metabolite,
N-desmethylclobazam,
respectively, after 4 weeks. Because most com-
mercially available antiepileptic drugs are metab-
olized
through
the
CYP
pathways,
drug
interactions
with
CBD
may
be
expected.
CYP3A4 inducers such as phenytoin and carba-
mazepine may also induce the metabolism of
CBD. CBD is generally well tolerated, with an
acceptable safety profile at therapeutic dosages.
Potential Therapeutic Utility of Cannabidiol in
the Treatment of Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a neurologic disorder associated
with abnormal electrical activity in the brain and
marked by sudden and recurrent episodes of sen-
sory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or sei-
zures. Epilepsy costs the United States ~$15.5
billion annually.24 About 4–10% of children
experience at least one seizure within their first
16 years of life,4 and ~150,000 children experi-
ence a seizure in their first year of life, and of
these, 30,000 develop epilepsy.23 About 30% of
children with epilepsy have intractable seizures.24
Intractable seizures are those that cannot be con-
trolled with at least two epilepsy drugs for
18 months–2 years, or control has been attained
but with serious drug adverse effects.24
In Western medicine, cannabis was reported
to have been used in the treatment of epilepsy
by prominent English neurologists in the late
19th
century.25
Cannabis
preparations
were
widely available in the United States during this
period and were advertised as remedies for a
number of disorders.26 The published reports on
use in epilepsy, however, did not popularize
cannabis as a suitable medication for this disor-
der, despite anecdotal success.
CBD is the only phytocannabinoid, other than
D9-THC, to have been investigated in preclinical
and clinical studies for anticonvulsant effects. In
rodent
models,
CBD blocked
maximal
elec-
troshock as well as pentylenetetrazole-induced
generalized seizures.25
Five controlled clinical trials have been pub-
lished on the use of CBD in patients with epi-
lepsy. In a placebo-controlled study of four
patients
administered
CBD
200 mg/day
for
3 months in 1978, two patients became seizure
free, one partially improved, and the fourth had
no improvement.27 Although no toxicity was
reported, the study was flawed by the small sam-
ple size, unclear design as to blinding, and the
description
of
what
constituted
the
partial
improvement.
In a related study in 1980, 15 patients with
“secondarily generalized epilepsy with temporal
focus,” randomly divided into a treatment group
and a placebo group, were given CBD 200–
300 mg/day or placebo.28 The patients contin-
ued
their
pretrial
regimen
of
antiepileptic
medications
prescribed
by
their
doctors,
although the drugs no longer helped in the con-
trol of their symptoms. CBD was tolerated in all
patients, with no signs of toxicity. Of the eight
in the treatment group, four were reported to be
almost free of episodes of convulsion throughout
the trial, whereas three others showed partial
clinical improvement. CBD was ineffective in
one patient. Apart from the small sample size,
the report of clear improvement in one of the
patients in the placebo group may limit the con-
clusions reached from the study.
In a third study conducted in 1986, CBD
200–300 mg/day for a month reported no signif-
icant differences between the treatment and pla-
cebo groups.29 Similarly, a 6-month double-
blind study administering CBD 100 mg 3 times/
day did not result in any changes in seizure fre-
quency or cognitive and behavioral improve-
ment.30
In a more recent study, a multicenter inter-
ventional trial was aimed at establishing the
safety,
tolerability,
and
efficacy
of
CBD
in
patients with severe, intractable childhood-onset
treatment-resistant
epilepsy.31
The
authors
recruited 214 patients. Only 3% of patients in
the safety assessment group discontinued treat-
ment because of an adverse event. A ~37% med-
ian reduction in monthly motor seizures was
reported.
These limited clinical reports coupled with a
long history of use and safety profiles make CBD
a candidate for antiepileptic drug development.
The limited availability of effective antiepileptic
drugs in certain groups of seizure sufferers is
also a good reason to explore CBD as an alterna-
tive.
Cannabis for the Treatment of Dravet and
Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes
Dravet syndrome, also known as severe myo-
clonic epilepsy of infancy, is a form of intractable
epilepsy that develops in infancy and continues
CANNABIDIOL PRODUCTS FOR MEDICAL USE Fasinu et al
785
 into childhood.32 Although not a hereditary
condition, it is most often caused by a genetic
mutation
affecting
the
brain
ion
(especially
sodium) channels. The first seizures that appear
during
infancy
are
usually
associated
with
fever
and
are
tonic-clonic.
Early
seizures
usually last more than 2 minutes and can even
result in status epilepticus (a seizure lasting
longer
than
30 minutes).
Current
treatment
includes drugs and alternative forms of treat-
ment, such as vagus nerve stimulation and a
ketogenic diet.33
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of
epilepsy that develops in children ~4 years of
age.34 Seizure types include tonic, atonic, atypical
absence, and myoclonic. Patients may experience
developmental delays, behavioral disturbances,
and impaired intellectual functioning. Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a head injury
or a central nervous system infection, but 30–
35% of cases have no known cause.35 Patients
may respond to conventional antiepileptic drugs
initially but may later develop tolerance or have
uncontrollable seizures.35
Stiripentol, an aromatic allylic alcohol that
allosterically modulates the GABAA receptor, is
the
only
compound
to
have
been
assessed
through a controlled clinical trial with clear
advantage over placebo and was awarded orphan
drug designation for the treatment of Dravet
syndrome by the European Medicine Agency in
2001 and by the FDA in 2008.36
Due to some clinical and anecdotal evidence
supporting cannabinoids, specifically CBD as a
potential therapy for epilepsy, coupled with the
failure of the conventional antiepileptic drugs to
manage Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes
effectively, many patients have turned to medical
marijuana.
Given
the
need
for
more
effec-
tive therapy that is better tolerated, patients
with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syn-
drome are potentially good candidates for CBD
trials.
In many states in the United States and in sev-
eral countries, supporting legislation has been
enacted to allow the exploration of CBD for
medical use. In this regard, Epidiolex, a purified
cannabinoid that comes in a liquid form con-
taining CBD and no THC, currently undergoing
clinical trials in the United States, is being devel-
oped by GW Pharmaceuticals (Salisbury, UK).37
It has been granted orphan drug status by the
FDA for the treatment of Dravet and Lennox-
Gastaut syndromes.
Other Potential Medical Uses of Cannabidiol
Cannabidiol has been assessed for potential
therapeutic uses in other neurologic and psychi-
atric disorders, some of which may be associated
or coexist with epilepsy.
Neonatal
hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy
(NHIE), resulting from perinatal asphyxia, is
one clinical condition that CBD may potentially
treat. Therapeutic hypothermia is the only avail-
able therapy for asphyxiated infants and pro-
vides neuroprotection only in patients with mild
NHIE.38
Although cannabis smoking has been identi-
fied as a risk factor for schizophrenia, several
components of cannabis are being suggested to
have potential therapeutic benefits in the man-
agement of psychiatric disorders. It has been
reported that cannabis-associated psychosis is
less prevalent in smokers of cannabis containing
higher CBD-to-THC ratios.39 CBD improves cog-
nitive function and may be potentially beneficial
in patients with schizophrenia for whom cogni-
tive impairment is a major deficit.40 CBD has
been shown in laboratory-based and clinical
studies to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia.41
A controlled clinical trial that compared CBD
and amisulpride, a standard antipsychotic drug,
for 4 weeks in 33 patients with acute schizophre-
nia reported similar clinical outcomes, with CBD
showing a better resolution of negative symp-
toms and fewer side effects.41 In addition, CBD
lacks the extrapyramidal symptoms associated
with amisulpride.41 In a case study of one schi-
zophrenic patient administered CBD 1200 mg/
day, symptoms improved after a few weeks.42
Ten years later, the same authors reported mild
symptom improvement in one of the three treat-
ment-resistant schizophrenic patients who was
enrolled in an inpatient study and adminis-
tered increasing doses of CDB 40–1280 mg/day
for 4 weeks.43 In another study, six patients
with Parkinson disease who had psychosis for at
least 3 months were administered CBD 150 mg/
day for 4 weeks in addition to their usual ther-
apy.44
Significant
improvement
was
reported
in the symptoms of psychosis and Parkinson
disease.
CBD has also been investigated for potential
benefits in the management of anxiety disorder.
In rodent models, CBD showed positive results
in conditioned fear, aversion to open space, con-
flicts tests, restraint stress, and other measures
of anxiety disorder.45 In humans, CBD reversed
786
PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 36, Number 7, 2016
 the
anxiety-inducing
effects
of
D9-THC
in
healthy volunteers and demonstrated anxiolytic
effects in patients with social anxiety disorder.46
A
number
of
clinical
trials
are
currently
underway around the world with CBD, alone or
in combination with D9-THC. Table 1 summa-
rizes those trials registered with ClinicalTrials.-
gov.
An example of such a trial, whose results have
been published, is the use of CBD-containing
products to treat cannabis withdrawal. In this
two-site
double-blind
randomized
trial
con-
ducted in Australia, cannabis-dependent treat-
ment seekers were administered a 6-day regimen
of nabiximols, formulated to deliver maximum
daily doses of 86.4 mg D9-THC and 80 mg CBD.
Relative to placebo, nabiximols attenuated can-
nabis
withdrawal
symptoms
and
improved
patient
retention
in
treatment,
significantly
reducing withdrawal-related irritability, depres-
sion, and cannabis cravings. The effect of nabixi-
mols on long-term reductions in cannabis use
following medication cessation, however, was
not significantly different from that of placebo.47
In an observational prospective multicenter
noninterventional
study
of
nabiximols
in
patients with multiple sclerosis spasticity in a
routine
care
setting
in
Germany,
74.6%
of
patients reported relief according to a specialist
assessment.48
These findings and many more have contin-
ued to project CBD as a therapeutic option for a
number of diseases. It is estimated that the
results of the many ongoing clinical assessments
will provide more evidence for possible clinical
approvals for the medical use of CBD and CBD-
containing preparations.
Current Legislation Status of Marijuana for
Medical Use Across the United States
In the last several years, a number of states
passed legislation for the legalization of mari-
juana possession; most of these are for medical
purposes, a few for recreational use, and a stea-
dily growing number have legalized, for treat-
ment of seizures and select other disorders,
certain cannabis-derived products rich in CBD
but with restricted Δ9-THC content. Figure 2
summarizes the legal status of cannabis products
with regard to medical use as of June 2015.
Twenty-five states along with the District of
Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical
purposes. Four states (Colorado, Oregon, Wash-
ington,
and
Alaska)
among
these
allow
recreational marijuana use. But in addition, 15
states have “restricted THC” statutes. When not
specifically mentioned as an indication for medi-
cal marijuana use, epilepsy is indirectly referred
to in most states’ legislation. Although these bills
provide for legal status within the respective
states, by federal law, these products are still
illegal.The Department of Justice has opted to
focus the Drug Enforcement Administration’s
(DEA)
investigative
and
enforcement
efforts
regarding cannabis on more violent or danger-
ous activities associated with marijuana (use of
firearms, gang activity, diversion, distribution to
minors, cover for narcotics trafficking or other
illegal activities, possession, or use on federal
property). However, the DEA is currently not
precluded from enforcing the federal statutes in
states that have legalized marijuana. This has
implications that are perhaps not widely appreci-
ated. For example, no federal medical facilities
(e.g., the Veterans Administration) can use so-
called medical marijuana even if located in a
legal state. No university or medical center such
as those receiving federal research funding, even
in states with medical marijuana laws, can treat
patients or even conduct clinical research with
these products without federal approvals; other-
wise they may face prosecution and jeopardize
their federal funding.
In May 2014, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, by a 219–189 vote, passed legislation that
would stop the DEA from targeting medical mar-
ijuana operations in states where it is legal.49, 50
Proponents argue that the ultimate goal is to
allow the states the final say on these medical
matters. The bill was not taken up by the Sen-
ate. However, in March 2015, new legislation
was introduced in both the House and Senate,
and it will likely receive serious consideration
during
this
Congress.
The
Compassionate
Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States
Act has several elements that would drastically
impact the current landscape for medical use of
cannabis-derived
products,
including
the
rescheduling of marijuana to Schedule II.50 The
Senate bill also calls for leaving medical mari-
juana regulation to the states, removing the
potential for federal prosecution for those pos-
sessing marijuana for medical purposes, making
marijuana available in federal medical facilities
where cannabis has been decriminalized, reduc-
ing
the
barriers
to
research

 bill’s careful language and broad bipartisan support
give it a good chance of serious debate, and there is
clearly a mounting public pressure, at least for
some components of the legislation. Therefore, the
overall state and federal legislative and enforce-
ment landscape for cannabis-derived products may
change dramatically in the coming months.
Conclusion
A long history of use, a good deal of experi-
mental evidence, and a number of anecdotal and
a few descriptive clinical studies point to the
potential clinical utility of CBD in the manage-
ment of seizures associated with epileptic syn-
dromes.
Growing
pressure
to
make
CBD
preparations available for the treatment of severe
cases of drug-resistant seizures has resulted in a
wave of legislative activity around the country to
ease restrictions on research and treatment. A
large number of registered clinical trials are cur-
rently
underway
for
several
neurologic
and
behavioral disorders. If positive indications of
therapeutic utility continue to accrue, interest in
and understanding of the underlying mecha-
nisms will certainly open new doors for pharma-
cologic
management
of
these
disorders
and
spawn new structural leads for central nervous
system drug development.
