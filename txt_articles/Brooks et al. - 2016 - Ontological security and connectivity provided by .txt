Abstract
Background: Despite evidence that connecting people to relevant wellbeing-related resources brings therapeutic
benefit, there is limited understanding, in the context of mental health recovery, of the potential value and
contribution of pet ownership to personal support networks for self-management. This study aimed to explore the
role of pets in the support and management activities in the personal networks of people with long-term mental
health problems.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews centred on ‘ego’ network mapping were conducted in two locations (in the
North West and in the South of England) with 54 participants with a diagnosis of a long-term mental health
problem. Interviews explored the day-to-day experience of living with a mental illness, informed by the notion of
illness work undertaken by social network members within personal networks. Narratives were elicited that explored
the relationship, value, utility and meaning of pets in the context of the provision of social support and
management provided by other network members. Interviews were recorded, then transcribed verbatim before
being analysed using a framework analysis.
Results: The majority of pets were placed in the central, most valued circle of support within the network
diagrams. Pets were implicated in relational work through the provision of secure and intimate relationships not
available elsewhere. Pets constituted a valuable source of illness work in managing feelings through distraction
from symptoms and upsetting experiences, and provided a form of encouragement for activity. Pets were of
enhanced salience where relationships with other network members were limited or difficult. Despite these
benefits, pets were unanimously neither considered nor incorporated into individual mental health care plans.
Conclusions: Drawing on a conceptual framework built on Corbin and Strauss’s notion of illness ‘work’ and notions
of a personal workforce of support undertaken within whole networks of individuals, this study contributes to our
understanding of the role of pets in the daily management of long-term mental health problems. Pets should be
considered a main rather than a marginal source of support in the management of long-term mental health
problems, and this has implications for the planning and delivery of mental health services.

 Background
The ability to manage and to be engaged with everyday life
is a key concern of people with a long-term condition,
which also applies to people experiencing mental health
problems. Losing previous connectivity and perceived
social status with people, losing valued activities and ex-
periencing feelings of loneliness and isolation have been
well documented as ongoing concerns [1, 2]. Related to
these concerns is a sense of ontological security, which re-
fers to a sense of order and continuity derived from a per-
son’s capacity to give meaning to their lives and to
maintain a positive view of the self, world and future [3].
The latter is considered to require positive and stable
emotions and the avoidance of chaos and anxiety [3]. In
relation to mental health, ontological security is threat-
ened by the breakdown of, and difficulties in, maintaining
relationships with friends and family [4], challenges in
maintaining routine and daily living activities [5], and feel-
ings of being judged and stigmatised [6, 7].
Having a support network in place provides options
for the management of living everyday life with a mental
health problem. In this respect, emphasis is often placed
on family, friends, and social interaction with other
people [8–10]. However, the role of pets is likely to have
been under-acknowledged, with indications in research
that some people consider their pets as being as import-
ant as family members, and their value in terms of com-
panionship, love and support is widely acknowledged
[11]. Analysis of an individual’s support network sug-
gests a unique contribution from pets that extends be-
yond the support and connections provided by familial,
friendship and weak tie connections. Weak ties are char-
acterised by relatively brief interactions with acquain-
tances and strangers but represent important sources of
support and are attributed with the power to enhance
the reach and cohesion of other social relations [1, 10].
Confirmatory evidence of the multifaceted relationships
that exist between people with health problems and their
pets emanates from the analysis of narrative accounts
which illuminate the presence of, or talk about pets, as
producing differing reactions from those of other house-
hold members [12]. There has also been recognition of
the more distal benefits that accrue from pet ownership,
including the benefits to and from the broader community
and through the building and receipt of social capital [13].
Social capital refers to the social, economic and cultural
resources on which individuals draw in responding to
long-term health conditions. These represent resources
that form an integral part of people’s social networks,
which are impacted upon by wider determinants of health
[14]. Class-related cultural resources interact with eco-
nomic and social capital in the structuring of people's
health chances, choices, and the unequal distribution of
health outcomes [15].
In terms of mental health, the value of the broader role
of animals is demonstrated in Animal Assisted Therapy
(AAT), which has been found to be effective in psychiatric
inpatient populations [16] and residential care settings
[17]. However, despite AAT gaining popularity in recent
years, and therapy animals becoming increasingly familiar
sights in care homes, hospices and hospital wards, pets
are not considered in care planning processes undertaken
for managing mental health on an on-going basis. This
may in part be due to a gap in evidence or in evidence
failing to inform or reach practitioners and policy makers
responsible for care planning arrangements. Whilst the
benefits of formalised AAT for conditions such as demen-
tia [18, 19], cancer [20, 21] and childhood developmental
disorders [22, 23] are gaining recognition, there is
currently a lack of evidence exploring the contribution of
pets in the broader context of support networks and the
role they may play in recovery-orientated activities and
the management of mental health.
Studies have examined the benefits of owning and
caring for pets demonstrating reduction in stress [24],
improved quality of life [25, 26], improved physical
health [27–29], increased social interaction [30] and
reduced loneliness [2, 31].
The current study aimed to develop an understanding
of the meaning and roles credited to pet ownership and
engagement by those with a diagnosis of mental illness
within the wider context of recovery activities and the
role of other members of individuals’ personal commu-
nities. Previous research has demonstrated the utility of
pets for mediating social connections linked to the mo-
bilisation of resources for those with long-term physical
conditions [32]. Here we extend the focus of this previ-
ous analysis to the role of pets for mental illness, which
is currently equivocal and underexplored.
Methods
This paper reports on the findings from qualitative inter-
views focussed on ‘ego’ network mapping to elicit an un-
derstanding of personal support derived from social
network members conducted in two locations; Manches-
ter and Southampton. The nature of support provided
by social network members and the wider community in
the management and everyday experience of living with
a mental illness was explored.
The methods have been informed by the consolidated
criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) guide-
lines [33]. The design and analysis of the study used a con-
ceptual framework which built on Corbin and Strauss’s
notion of illness work [34] and notions of a personal
workforce of support undertaken within whole networks
of
individuals
with
chronic
illness
(Table
1).
This
approach allows for a close inspection of what tasks are
undertaken to manage illness, who does them, how and

 where these activities are undertaken and also identifies
any potential problems associated with this ‘work’ [34].
The definitions of the categories of work included in
this study can be found in Table 2 and were combined
as follows: practical, emotional and biographical work.
The notion of illness work was preferred to alternative
theories of social support as it provides a useful lens
through which to understand the resources, networks
and relationships associated with the management of se-
vere mental illness and allows participants to self-
identify a wide range of contributors relevant to their
unique circumstances [1, 10, 32].
Recruitment
Participants were recruited from 1) a randomised con-
trolled trial exploring service user and carer involvement
in mental health care planning (EQUIP, Manchester)
and 2) a sample of people using a Recovery College
(Southampton). Participants were recruited via invitation
letters and flyers advertising the study. Those who were
interested in taking part contacted the research team
directly to discuss the study in more depth and then
arranged a convenient time, date and location for inter-
view. Informed, written consent was obtained prior to
the interview. Purposive sampling was used to select
participants to allow for diversity in terms of age and
gender. Recruitment stopped upon agreement amongst
the study team that theme saturation had occurred and
there was consensus that no new themes were arising
from the data.

Participants were considered eligible for inclusion in the
study if they were aged 18 or above, were under the care

 of community-based mental health services (or had been
discharged within 6 months) and had received a diagno-
sis from a health professional of a severe mental illness
(e.g. Schizophrenia or Bipolar disorder).
Twenty-nine participants were recruited to the study
in Manchester (12 of whom identified a pet in their
social network) and 25 participants were recruited from
Southampton (13 of whom identified a pet in their net-
work). See Table 3 for more detail on study participants.
Data collection
Face-to-face, semi-structured network interviews were
carried out between March 2015 and February 2016 by
either HB or SW at participants’ homes or an agreed
local community facility. Participants were asked to map
personal networks using a diagram, which consisted of
three concentric circles [35]. Interviewers started the
interview by asking the question ‘Who or what do you
think is most important to you in managing your mental
health?’. Participants could place nominated network
members in either the central circle considered most
important, the middle circle, considered important but
not as important as the central circle or the outer circle,
considered important but not as important as the two
more
central
circles.
Identified
network
members
included friends, family members, health professionals,
pets, hobbies, places, activities and objects. There was
no maximum number of network members imposed on
participants and they were free to list as few or as many
as they considered relevant to their unique situation.
The interviews lasted between 20 and 90 min and
explored the role and key attributes of individual net-
work members to mental health management based on
the aforementioned categories of work (see Appendix 1
for an interview schedule). This way, detailed informa-
tion was collected about the contributions each network
member made to the different types of work associated
with mental health management. Interviews were digit-
ally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, anonymised
and allocated to a member of the study team (HB, KR,
SW alternatively) for analysis.
HB and KR are health service researchers, SW is a
Lecturer in Mental Health, KL is a Professor in Mental
Health and AR is a Professor of Health Systems Imple-
mentation. As such, researchers had no therapeutic rela-
tionship with participants. The conceptual starting point
of our study is one informed by a capabilities approach
which recognises that the social context and engagement
with valued people, places and activities are often hidden
from view but are likely to be as important to the man-
agement of long-term conditions as traditional thera-
peutic or self-management support approaches [36].
Data analysis
Transcripts were read a number of times to ensure famil-
iarisation. Excel software was used to aid analysis along
with a paper trail detailing framework development
contained in a word document for transparency purposes.
A framework analysis was undertaken with individual
members of the study team coding data relating to
work-related codes (practical, emotional and biograph-
ical work, see Tables 1 and 2 [34]) implicated in narra-
tives about the role of pets. Each author (HB, KR and
SW) coded transcripts independently and a subset of
transcripts were independently analysed by AR, with any
coding discrepancies discussed amongst the team to
enhance rigour and trustworthiness of data. Researchers
met regularly to discuss on-going analysis and to discuss,
explore and confirm emergent codes and to remove
duplicated codes.
Network diagrams were analysed descriptively to iden-
tify the size of network, whether a pet was in the net-
work, along with the relative position of the pet within
the network. The study took an individual network ap-
proach to understand how the participant managed their
condition and the types of support they utilised across
the network including the comparative contribution of
pets. The main themes that emerged from the coding

Results
Network placement and attributional meaning of pets
Of the 25 participants who identified a pet within the
personal communities associated with the management
of mental health and everyday life, the majority (60 %, n
= 15) placed their pet in the central most important cir-
cle. A further 20 % (n = 5) placed their pet in the second
circle and 12 % (n = 3) placed their pet in the third cir-
cle. The remaining 8 % (n = 2) whilst identifying a pet
within their social network did not place them in one of
the three concentric circles. Figure 1 details the network
diagram completed by ID 2. This male participant had a
relatively small network (n = 6) in which his pet birds
were placed in the central, most important circle. The
only human members of his network were his Commu-
nity Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) and support worker whom
he saw infrequently, highlighting the importance of his
pets for the management of his mental health.
Examples of animals cited as relevant to the manage-
ment of mental health included family pets, working ani-
mals and more peripheral links to animals in the wider
community in places such as urban farms and animal
rescue centres. The prominence and salience of animals
within an individual’s personal community network var-
ied. Some individuals had networks dominated by pets,
coined ‘pet centric’ networks, which provided a range of
direct and indirect benefits, whilst others had one ani-
mal positioned in a fairly peripheral position within the
network (Appendix 2). It was often the case that where
relationships with family and friends were seen to be
good, animal-human relationships were perceived to be
of secondary importance. However, the majority of
people reported either having difficult relationships with
other network members including friends and family or
had little or limited other network support in addition
to their pets. For these people, the relationships with
companion animals took on discrete and definite func-
tions within networks, which were different to the
norms associated with human-to-human relationships.
These appeared to centre on the receipt of ontological
security not available from elsewhere, as well as physical
proximity and consistency when compared to the other
relationships.
So with my pets I suppose although my Mum and Dad
are very significant figures they’ve also got their own
lives and lots of other things going on so I’m only one
aspect of that life and I feel that the pets I suppose
they depend on me and also I have daily contact with
them and they also give me a sense of wellbeing which
I don’t get from any [one else] because most of these
interactions with my Mum, Dad, [friend], are all by
telephone rather than physical contact and that’s the
big difference is the empathetic physical presence.

 Relational work and substitution
Relational work has been used to describe the tasks that are
required to develop and sustain interpersonal relationships
[37]. A core theme that arose from the data during narra-
tives was the attributional meaning of relationships with
pets. Some invested energy in a singular focus on a pre-
ferred pet. For those without close friends and family, the
intensive and positive identification associated with their
pets made for intense, intimate relationships ‘the relation-
ship with my cat was the only thing that stayed constant’
(ID 7, one cat, second circle). Individuals often saw their
pet most frequently and for some, they were their only
source of support. In this way, pets featured highly in the
network hierarchy and were linked to dependency and sub-
stitutability of other, often absent network members provid-
ing or replacing ontological security from other sources.
Well I just love animals, I just really do love animals.
I haven’t got a partner so I have something around me
otherwise I’d go totally bonkers. That’s the most
important thing to me is my animals (ID 13, range of
pets, first circle).
Participants described the various, nuanced ways that
pets connected them to others in, and beyond, their
personal networks or to the wider social environment.
Participants described new relationships with network
members or community organisations as a result of pet
ownership, as well as enhanced ones with existing
network members.
That surprised me, you know, the amount of people
that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me
up with him. I haven’t got much in my life, but he’s
quite good, yeah (ID 9, 1 dog, first circle).
For participants in this study, the connection an indi-
vidual felt with their pet was seemingly of relatively
more salience when compared to studies of other long-
term conditions [32]. Linked to ontological security,
participants spoke in depth about the connection they
felt with their pet, which was often not replicated in
their relationships with friends and family, either be-
cause they had no human network members or existing
relationships were difficult.
If I didn’t have my pets I think I would be on my
own…You know what I mean, so it’s…it’s nice to come
home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and
that, you know (ID 2, 2 birds, first circle).
I felt in a sense that my cat was my familiar in that
he understood or was an extension of my thoughts
(ID 7, 1 cat, second circle).
These limited or difficult connections with others were
often perceived to have come about from what partici-
pants referred to as a ‘gulf in understanding’ between
themselves and the other humans in their network.
Participants felt that in order to have a beneficial rela-
tionship with friends and family, there needed to be a
shared understanding of their mental health condition,
which was problematic to obtain without direct experi-
ence and in the absence of similar value judgements or
thwarted expectations. Pets, on the other hand were
credited with either having an understanding of their
owners’ mental health problems without the need for
this to be communicated, or as being a network member
with whom they could have an adequate relationship
without this pre-requisite level of understanding.
I think it's hard really when you haven't had mental
illness to know what the actual experience is for
someone who has had the experience. There's like a
chasm, deep chasm between us - a growing canyon.
They're on one side of it and we're on the other side of
it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try
and understand each other but we don't always - we
don't always understand each other I don't think.
(ID 1, 1 cat, first circle).
One important component of the relationship with
pets was a sense of enduring trust between individuals
and their companion animal, which enhanced the value
of pets when compared with humans. Often, participants
described fractured relationships with friends and family
that had occurred due to past behaviour on their part
attributed to mental illness, which had caused existing
relationships to strain or to break down. Participants
also worried about upsetting the humans in their net-
works. It was considered that pets, on the other hand,
were not subject to these sensitivities and thus possessed
the capacity to form more enduring and secure relation-
ships. People talked about pets still being there however
they were treated and compared this directly to relation-
ships with friends and family. In this way, pets served to
provide a unique form of validation through uncondi-
tional support, which was often not forthcoming from
other network relationships.
Er, there’s a lot less things to worry about. I mean you
can’t…you can’t like be like if he was naughty or
anything like that you’d tell him off and that was it
and there’d be no hard feelings. That there’s not, you
don’t get the nastiness (ID 11, 1 dog, third circle).
Alternatively, participants provided examples of friends
and family not having been a helpful or useful source of
support in difficult times,
which meant they were
Brooks et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:409 
Page 6 of 12
 reluctant to trust or to rely on them to provide this in the
future. Additionally, participants alluded to a general
distrust of people attributable to a sense of vulnerability
attached to mental illness. These concerns became height-
ened during times of acute mental health crises.
Yes, they can give you loving, pets can and you can trust
pets not to steal off you (ID 6, 1 guinea pig, first circle).
Frequently, participants expressed the view of wanting
to avoid the world when acutely unwell, whilst at the same
time acknowledging that this was sometimes a direct bar-
rier to recovery. Pets provided participants with a mech-
anism for engagement with the social world through
having to care for their animals no matter how they felt.
This sense of purpose was considered fundamental to a
sense of wellbeing and recovery and demarcated the sup-
port provided by pets from that given by other network
members, which was often considered conditional on
moment-to-moment changes in a person’s mental health
status (e.g. only seeing friends when feeling well enough).
You know, so in terms of mental health, when you just
want to sink into a pit and just sort of retreat from the
entire world, they force me, the cats force me to sort of
still be involved with the world (ID 5, 2 cats, first circle).
Balancing of emotional, illness and biographical pet work
Negative work and burden
In a small number of instances, negative aspects to pet own-
ership surfaced. These ‘deviant’ cases included narratives re-
lated to the burden of looking after pets, pets as a source of
anxiety and the acknowledged or anticipated distress when
loved companion animals died. Additionally, whilst pets
were identified as a valuable source of support in times of
crisis, one participant talked about her pets blocking the
achievement of aspirational goals associated with recovery,
such as travel. For one participant, since becoming unwell
her pets had lost all their beneficial elements.
Yes the only thing is my future plans revolve around
saving up as much money as possible and travelling
for as many years as possible which means dogs and
cats that I’ve got I won’t be able to keep so
(ID 14, 2 dogs and 2 cats, first circle).
Emotional and illness work
When participants talked about the work that their pets
did to support them in managing their mental health on a
day-to-day basis, narratives about illness and emotional
work were conflated at times. Unsurprisingly, pets were
rarely implicated in everyday practical work (such as
house work) but were considered important in relation to
illness-related practical work and emotional work.
Given the consistency of presence and a close physical
proximity, pets constituted an instantaneous source of
calming, therapeutic benefit for their owners. Pets were
a source of physical contact and comfort and a way for
individuals to channel their own emotional energy often
not available elsewhere.
Yes, you get comfort from them, because they lick you
and all that, and they knead you with their claws and
purr at you and all that, so yes, they’re lovely
(ID 8, 2 cats, first circle).
The network benefits associated with pets could be
direct or experienced indirectly via pets owned by other
people, but whose benefits were transmitted. Pets owned
by others in the network could provide solace and support
that some participants could not source themselves within
their own network. There was also a sense that animals
were imbued with intuition for when their owners were
feeling unwell to which they behaved accordingly.
When I’m feeling really low they are wonderful
because they won’t leave my side for two days. I will
get up and I will let them out to the toilet and I will
feed them but I am straight back in bed and I won’t
even get myself any food or water and then they’ll just
come straight back up and just stay with me until I’m
ready to come out of it. They are used to it I suppose
(ID 14, 2 dogs and 2 cats, first circle).
One element of the intimate relationship with pets
was their input as a source of practical illness work, not-
ably in relation to distraction and disruption from nega-
tive feelings, emotions and untoward symptoms. This
finding indicates a therapeutic role beyond that found
previously for other long-term conditions. For example,
pets could distract their owners from positive symptoms
of schizophrenia such as hearing voices, from suicidal
ideation or from a general sense of feeling alone.
But if I’m here and I’m having…having problems with
voices and that, erm, it does help me in the sense, you
know, I’m not thinking about the voices, I’m just thinking
of when I hear the birds singing (ID 2, 2 birds, first circle).
Pets often introduced a source of humour into difficult
situations and were often the only thing that could lift
participants’ spirits.
She, sort of, does random stuff, like climbs on the bars
and… stuff [laugh] and things [which distract me] and
it’s quite funny watching her what she does because
she’s not like a normal hamster
(ID 3, 1 hamster, second circle).
Brooks et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:409 
Page 7 of 12
 Given this attributed function of distraction and
disruption, pets were particularly beneficial in crisis situ-
ations. In comparison with other relationships within
their network, pets were considered as an omnipotent
and constant presence so people could rely on this
source of distraction and unconditional support.
I mean I could always go out, take him out of his, er,
hutch, give him a stroke or something [if I needed to]
(ID 3, 1 hamster, second circle).
Biographical work
Pets were reported to be important in relation to bio-
graphical work given their assistance in managing the
stigma associated with the diagnosis and experience of
mental illness and by providing ontological security.
They also provided self-validation both through their re-
lationship with their owner but also because of a percep-
tion that they mediated how other people viewed them.
Pets were identified as having a role in providing routine
for their owners. For some, pets encouraged exercise and
for others their pets were the only reason they got out of
bed in the morning. Through the rituals of feeding, exer-
cise, grooming and caring for their pet a sense of consist-
ent daily routine became embedded in their lives, which
participants felt was vital for their wellbeing.
And I just try and make sure that I walk him, and
that, in the mornings….but sometimes I can’t be
bothered to do that, but then I think….I..I think about,
you know, that it’s not fair if he doesn’t go
(ID 11, 1 dog, third circle).
Participants reported experiencing high levels of felt and
enacted stigma related to their diagnosis - even from
friends and family. Pets were relevant to an individual’s
construction of self and played a unique role in the reduc-
tion and management of stigma. For example, pets were
seen to accept people for who they were without judge-
ment or resentment. This form of ‘unconditional love’
was an important element of the human-pet dyad, which
became increasingly valuable given the vagaries of living
with a mental illness.
And everybody that finds out that you’ve got a mental
health problem they will think you’re, you know, off
your head and you’re not (ID 2, 2 birds, first circle).
Participants described how pets (in comparison to hu-
man relationships) understood boundaries and knew intui-
tively when to leave them alone. There was a perception
that pets did not hold past behaviours against them and ac-
cepted them for who they were. Friends and family mem-
bers however, often as a result of past behaviours including
suicide attempts, overstepped boundaries and made intru-
sions into their lives that were often not welcomed by the
participants included in this study.
They [pets] don’t look at the scars on your arms, or
they don’t question things, and they don’t question
where you’ve been (ID 12, 1 dog, first circle).
Participants reported feeling negatively experienced
pressure from friends and family members. This in-
cluded a perception that friends and family could ask
too much of them and pressurise them to recover when
they did not feel able to. Having friends and family
members rely on them or to ask them for help could be
challenging for participants, especially when they were
feeling acutely unwell. Complicated dynamics between
people in their network could also be stressful to cope
with. Relationships with pets were altogether a more
simple affair, and they asked very little of each other.
Well, you know, apart from being fed, they don’t make
many demands (ID 10, 2 cats, first circle).
Others discussed similarities with their pets in relation
to their mental health condition (e.g. budgie also having
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)), which may in-
dicate that this identification could be used by partici-
pants as a way of managing their own conditions. At the
very least, this identification meant that participants did
not feel alone in their experiences. Pets were passive re-
cipients of these characteristics, which were projected
freely on to them by individuals in a way that appeared
to fulfil a specific need to do so.
I love budgies and every budgie I’ve had I’ve always
managed to get it into a position where it will sit on
my shoulder and at the moment I’m just training this
one because I’m sure he’s got PTSD from living with
[friend’s] nan because she used to just chuck things at
him in the cage so that’s why the home said we had to
get rid of the bird because she wasn’t leaving the room
and consequently we took the bird and she’s getting
better in the home she’s in. I look after that bird every
day, I wake him up, I sit with him and in the evening I’ll
sit for a good hour playing with him on his cage or in his
cage. (ID 15, Budgie and goldfish, second circle).
Reciprocity embedded in relationships with pets de-
marcated such relationships from human ones, which
were often not considered reciprocal.
When he comes and sits up beside you on a night, it’s
different, you know, it’s just, like, he needs me as much
as I need him, sort of thing. (ID 9, 1 dog, first circle).

 The hidden work of pets
Successfully caring for a pet could provide a source of
validation. Pet owners talked about the pride associated
with having a pet that was seen to be well loved and
cared for. Given the high levels of unemployment and
isolation within the sample, participants had limited
other opportunities to develop this form of validation.
One participant’s love of animals had led her to the local
city farm where she volunteered, which impacted on her
confidence. Often, the physical connection with pets was
enhanced through mastery such as teaching an animal
tricks. Through these relationships with their pets,
participants could present themselves to others in a
more positive light.
I mean it’s just a nice feeling to have somebody
around that you can l, like, take care of
(ID 3, 1 hamster, second circle).
Despite this perceived value attributed to illness work,
pets were unanimously neither incorporated into partici-
pants’ discussions with health service providers nor into
mental health care planning. Our data indicates that the
work undertaken by pets has little salience to those in
positions of power in relation to decision making and
service provision within health services. Most partici-
pants, however, could see the benefit of incorporating
pets into these discussions through the development of
an holistic understanding of the individual and the pro-
duction of more relevant and useful care plans.
Kind of, knowing about your cats and your friends and
your family would feed into them knowing you and
understanding you a bit better, and…Which would, in
turn, feed into how useful the care plan could be.
(ID 5, 2 cats, first circle).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study em-
pirically exploring the role of pets in the social networks
of people managing a long-term mental health problem.
Using a social network approach incorporating illness
work concepts, we identified the attributional meaning
attached to pets by those diagnosed with mental health
conditions as well as the implicated role of pets in differ-
ent types of illness work.
Pets contributed, over time, to individuals developing
routines that provided emotional and social support. This
was set against a backdrop of pets also providing the abil-
ity to gain a sense of control inherent to caring for a pet,
which was absent in relationships with other network
members. This seemed to enable a sense of security and
routine to be developed in relationships with pets, which
reinforced stable cognitions from the creation of certainty
that they could turn to and rely on pets in times of need.
With reference to how Giddens [3] used the term, pets
provided ontological security through generating a sense
of order and continuity to individual experiences and
through this close connection provided a sense of mean-
ing to people’s lives. Pets also served as passive recipients
of projected characteristics. For example, one participant
discussed how her pet also had PTSD, which meant she
did not feel alone in her condition and could relate to an-
other network member with whom she perceived to share
experiences. In this sense, the work of pets in personal
communities provided participants with a seemingly deep
and secure relationship, often not available elsewhere
within the network or wider community. This became in-
creasingly important given the often uncertain illness tra-
jectory associated with severe mental illness including
recovery and periods of crisis.
In terms of the illness work associated with managing
mental health, our findings point to the value of pets in
illness practical work. This included distraction and dis-
ruption from distressing symptoms, such as hearing
voices, suicidal thoughts, rumination and facilitating
routine and exercise for those who cared for them. Fur-
thermore, pets were implicated in biographical work
through their direct impact on managing the stigma
associated with mental illness. Pets provided a form of
acceptance for their owners and participants considered
that by undertaking the tasks associated with being a
responsible pet owner, this positively impacted on how
others viewed them. These aspects of illness work pro-
vide an extension to previous findings about the role of
pets for physical illness management [32] and mental
health (i.e. a reduction in stress [24] reduced loneliness,
[2, 31] and the receipt of social capital [13]). The find-
ings also contrast with previous research that demon-
strates the negative impact of pet ownership [38] and of
losing a family pet [39].
It is not the intention of this paper to indicate that
pets play a more important role for one type of health
concern than another, rather that there are nuanced
differences in the ways in which people with labels of
mental and physical conditions may come to view recov-
ery [40] and the impact that a diagnosis may have on a
sense of self [40, 41]. On the face of things, it appears
that the participants raised similar themes as those with
physical health conditions [32]. However, in relation to
the salience of themes with specific regard to mental
health, there were clear differences. Participants in this
study had more difficult and contentious relationships
with others and experienced greater levels of stigma than
those included in studies of chronic physical conditions.
This increased the perceived importance of their pets,
reflecting the added salience of being labelled with a
mental health problem as having a greater impact on
Brooks et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:409 
Page 9 of 12
 one’s sense of ‘self’ than physical illnesses, since the
surveillance of moral responsibility may be felt more
intensely, and levels of isolation and stigma are likely to
be greater [40, 41].
Service implications–the hidden work of pets
The network mapping undertaken as part of this study
illuminated the role of pets as a hidden resource for
mental health management and supports the idea of a
‘lifestyle’ approach to the management of mental health
problems and prevention [42]. The latter involves the in-
corporation of holistic principles to enhance physical
and mental wellbeing, including environmental, behav-
ioural and psychological principles [43] and this study
identifies pets as a hidden asset that could be deployed
in this regard. However, the value and utility of pets as
part of an active point of discussion and resource for
people remains invisible within mental health service
provision and in the negotiation of individual care plans.
A lack of consideration for individual caring responsibil-
ities for pets also represented a source of worry for some
of the participants included in this study when they con-
sidered the chance of them being in a crisis in the future
(e.g. concern for the care of their pet should they be-
come hospitalised). This suggests the need to consider
including pets in the care planning process so that ser-
vice users feel confident that their pets are cared for and
returned to them should they not be able to care for
them for a period.
Further implications for health services are the inclu-
sion of pets as a topic of discussion, to facilitate health-
care discussions. Previous research suggests that service
users feel distanced from healthcare and uninvolved in
discussions about services [44, 45]. Taking more creative
approaches to care planning discussions, including the
use of pets, may be one way of addressing this because
of the value, meaning and engagement that individuals
have with their companion animals. The study also
highlighted the timeliness of incorporating pets into dis-
cussions with those in services – particularly about man-
aging mental health over time, with pets considered
particularly useful at times of crisis but potentially re-
strictive when aspirational goals associated with recovery
were considered.
Strengths and limitations
Key strengths of the paper were the utilisation of an estab-
lished theoretical framework (Corbin and Strauss’s Illness
Work) and the comparison with non-pet owning partici-
pants. Adopting a qualitative, social network approach
provided rich data with which the theoretical ‘illness work’
framework [31] was used to allow participants to describe
the unique and distinct role of pets within their personal
communities compared with other network members.
The authors considered that theme saturation was achieved
with the data collected, and participants were sampled to
ensure a variety of attitudes were encapsulated into the
study. Participants were recruited from within two locations
in the UK, included only those cared for withing the com-
munity and did not recruit any participants from Black,
Asian and minority ethinc communities. It therefore may
not be possible to fully transfer findings in terms of typical-
ity to other ethnic groups or other service populations.
Conclusions
Drawing on an approach incorporating notions of illness
work and a personal workforce of support, this study con-
tributes to the understanding of the role of pets in the
management of mental health. This was achieved through
the identification of the unique role and value of pets in
relationships and work associated with managing mental
health over time. The implications of this study propose
that pets should be considered a main, rather than a mar-
ginal source of support, in the management of long-term
mental health problems and could be considered as ex-
tending more traditional Collaborative Care Models for
managing mental health [46]. These insights provide the
mental health community with possible areas to target
intervention and potential ways in which to better involve
service users in service provision through the discussion
of valued experiences.
