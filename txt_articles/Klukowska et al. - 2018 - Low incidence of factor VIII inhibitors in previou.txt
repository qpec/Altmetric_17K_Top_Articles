Introduction: Octanate® is a human, plasma- 
derived, von Willebrand factor- 
stabilized 
coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate with demonstrated haemostatic efficacy in 
previously treated patients with haemophilia A.
Aim: This prospective, open- 
label study aimed to assess the immunogenicity of octan-
ate® in previously untreated patients (PUPs).
Methods: The study monitored development of FVIII inhibitors in 51 PUPs. Tolerability, 
viral safety, FVIII recovery and efficacy of octanate® for the prevention and treatment 
of bleeds and in surgical procedures were also assessed.
Results: Five (9.8%) of the 51 patients developed inhibitors during the study, 4 of 
which (7.8%) were high titre. Three inhibitor cases (5.9%) were considered clinically 
relevant; 2 were transient inhibitors that disappeared during regular octanate® treat-
ment without a change in dose or treatment frequency. Amongst 45 patients with 
FVIII:C <1% at baseline and who received ≥20 exposure days (EDs) or had <20 EDs but 
developed an inhibitor, inhibitor incidence was 11.1% (6.7% clinically relevant). All 
clinically relevant inhibitors developed within 20 EDs of on- 
demand treatment. No in-
hibitors developed in PUPs receiving prophylaxis. All patients who developed inhibi-
tors had either intron 22 inversions or large deletions. Irrespective of the reason for 
administration, haemostatic efficacy was rated as “excellent” in 99.6% of all infusions 
(4700 of 4717 infusions), and no complications were reported in 23 surgical proce-
dures. Mean incremental in vivo recovery was 2.0%/IU/kg (±0.7) and 1.9%/IU/kg 
(±0.5) for the first and second assessments, respectively. Tolerability was rated “very 
good” in 99.9% of infusions.
Conclusion: In PUPs with severe haemophilia A, octanate® demonstrated haemostatic 
efficacy with a low rate of inhibitor development.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Patients with haemophilia A (HA) are deficient in coagulation factor VIII 
(FVIII), predisposing them to recurrent bleeds, particularly into joints and 
muscles, culminating in debilitating arthropathy and long- 
term morbid-
ity.1,2 Administration of FVIII, either plasma- 
derived or recombinant (pd-
FVIII or rFVIII), restores clotting capacity and limits uncontrolled bleeding. 
Administered prophylactically or on demand, FVIII has been shown to be 
effective and well tolerated. However, development of FVIII inhibitors 
remains a serious complication in replacement therapy with major ad-
verse implications on bleeding rates, morbidity, mortality, quality of life 
and treatment costs.3 Reduction in the overall immunogenic challenge of 
replacement factor therapy remains one of the main unmet needs in HA.
Previously untreated patients (PUPs) with HA are at greatest risk 
of inhibitor development. Approximately 35% develop inhibitors, of 
which up to 70% are high- 
titre inhibitors (≥5 Bethesda Unit (BU)/mL).4-
6 Inhibitors in PUPs with severe HA usually occur within the first 50 
exposure days (EDs), with a median around 10- 
15 EDs.4,7 Data from 
the Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma- 
Product Exposed Toddlers (SIPPET) 
study showed cumulative inhibitor incidence of 26.8% in PUPs treated 
with pdFVIII- 
containing von Willebrand factor (VWF) and 44.5% in 
those treated with rFVIIIs derived from hamster cell lines; the majority 
(90%) of inhibitors developed within the first 20 EDs.6
FVIII inhibitor development is considered to be a multifactorial 
event. Patient- 
related risk factors include the type of F8 gene mu-
tation, age at first exposure, ethnicity and a family history of inhibi-
tors.5,8-11 The type of treatment approach (prophylactic or on demand 
after 20 EDs), intensity of FVIII exposure (eg during surgery), type 
of FVIII product (plasma- 
derived or different generations of recom-
binant FVIII) and VWF content of the FVIII product have been also 
identified as possible risk factors for inhibitor development.4,5,9,12-14 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) speculates that the cell origin 
(human or animal) of rFVIII products could influence immunogenic-
ity,15 although definitive evidence of an increased inhibitor risk with 
rFVIII derived from animal cell lines has not been published.
In contrast to PUPs, only around 1% of previously treated patients 
(PTPs) develop inhibitors.16 Therefore, to assess the immunogenic po-
tential of different FVIII products, it is essential to perform sufficiently 
large immunogenicity studies in PUPs.
Octanate® (Octapharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland) is a human, 
plasma- 
derived, high purity, coagulation FVIII concentrate stabi-
lized with VWF in a ratio of ~0.4 (VWF:ristocetin cofactor activity/
FVIII:coagulant activity [VWF:RCo/FVIII:C]), such that all FVIII mol-
ecules could complex with VWF. There is evidence that VWF has a 
protective role against inhibitor development. The stability of infused 
FVIII depends on its native VWF- 
binding properties, which are depen-
dent on the post- 
translational modifications (PTMs) of FVIII.17 FVIII 
undergoes extensive PTMs, which are species- 
specific and can thus 
differ between human and hamster cell- 
derived rFVIII products.18 
Non- 
human epitopes potentially present in hamster cell- 
derived rFVIII 
products may have antigenic properties.17,18 Additionally, VWF may 
decrease FVIII immunogenicity due to epitope masking and protection 
of FVIII from endocytosis by antigen- 
presenting cells.19
Octanate® has been marketed since 1998 and is approved in 
more than 85 countries for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
in patients with HA, including for surgical procedures. In 5 prospec-
tive clinical studies in a total of 77 PTPs, only one patient developed 
an inhibitor; however, this patient had frequently received an alter-
native FVIII product, and a relationship with octanate® could not be 
ascertained. Recently, a high success rate was demonstrated with 
octanate® in immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy in a large co-
hort of 48 HA patients with FVIII inhibitors and poor prognosis20; oc-
tanate® is now approved for ITI in 40 countries. Considerable clinical 
experience exists with octanate®, with >9.6 billion international units 
(IU) infused worldwide (as of April 2017) (Octapharma, data on file).
Here, we present the final results of a prospective study of oc-
tanate® in PUPs with severe HA. The primary objective of the study 
was to assess the immunogenicity of octanate®. Secondary objectives 
were assessment of tolerability, viral safety and efficacy of octanate® 
for the prevention and treatment of bleeds and in surgical procedures.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Patients and study design
This prospective, open- 
label, non- 
controlled, multinational, multicentre 
study of octanate® was conducted according to good clinical practice 
(GCP; EudraCT 2005- 
004435- 
22) and was initiated in accordance with 
EMA guidance on clinical studies required for FVIII replacement products 
at the time.21 The study was initiated in February 2000 and completed in 
January 2015. Patients had severe HA (FVIII coagulant activity [FVIII:C] 
<2%, as per the accepted definition of severe HA at the time 21) with no 
previous treatment with FVIII- 
containing products and no inhibitor activ-
ity (<0.6 BU). Informed consent was obtained from the patients’ parents 
or legal guardians. Exclusion criteria included any bleeding disorder other 
than severe HA, interferon therapy and participation in other clinical 
studies, either concurrently or within the 4 weeks prior to enrolment.
Each patient received octanate® as replacement therapy, either 
prophylactically or for treatment of bleeds, for a total of 100 EDs or 
5 years, whichever came first. Octanate® dosing and frequency was 
dependent upon the clinical situation and the treatment policies at the 
individual study centres.
2.2 | Study drug
Octanate® is supplied as a freeze- 
dried concentrate in vials contain-
ing 250, 500 or 1000 IU FVIII. The manufacturing process includes 2 
validated virus- 
inactivation steps.
2.3 | Clinical outcomes and laboratory parameters
Patients were tested for FVIII inhibitors at baseline, every 3 or 4 EDs 
until 20 EDs, and thereafter either every 10th ED or every 3 months, 
whichever came first. Testing was performed at a central laboratory 
using the Bethesda assay with Nijmegen modification. The cut- 
off for 
FVIII inhibitors was ≥0.6 BU. Blood samples were to be taken after a 
     |  223
KLUKOWSKA et AL.
FVIII wash- 
out period of at least 3 or 4 days, ideally 7 days (especially 
if the presence of an inhibitor was suspected). FVIII recovery deter-
minations and calculations of incremental in vivo recovery (IVR) were 
recommended but not mandatory due to blood collection restric-
tions in babies/toddlers. Where IVR was performed, it was preceded 
by a wash- 
out period of at least 48 hours, and a single bolus dose 
 
(25- 
30 IU/kg recommended) was administered. The type of F8 gene 
mutation was determined for each patient.
The following viral markers were measured at baseline and at 
 
3- 
month intervals for 5 years, or until 100 EDs were reached: alanine 
aminotransferase, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2, 
hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis B surface/antigen, hepatitis 
B core, hepatitis C virus and parvovirus B19 (including polymerase chain 
reaction [PCR] testing). Haemostatic efficacy was rated by the investiga-
tor (or parent or legal guardian for home- 
treatment) as “excellent,” “good,” 
“moderate” or “none.” Tolerability was rated by the investigator (or by the 
parent or legal guardian for home- 
treatment) as “very good,” “good,” “sat-
isfactory” or “unsatisfactory.” All adverse events (AEs) experienced by 
patients were analysed based on MedDRA (version 17.1) terminology.
2.4 | Statistical analyses and sample size
No sample size calculation was made for this study. The planned sam-
ple size of 50 patients complied with the recommended sample size of 
at least 20 PUPs recommended in the EMA guidelines available at the 
time of study initiation.21
The safety population included all patients who received at least 
one dose of octanate®. The efficacy population comprised patients 
who received octanate® and for whom data were collected post treat-
ment. A surgery subpopulation was analysed separately (Figure 1). 
All efficacy analyses were repeated to exclude data after occurrence 
of the inhibitor from patients who started ITI treatment as increased 
treatment doses for these patients would bias the assessment of all 
efficacy parameters.
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis 
Software (SAS®) package (version 9.8, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North 
Carolina, USA). Analyses were exploratory only and based upon a type I 
error probability of 0.05 with confidence interval calculations set at 95%.

patients at study entry was 0.6 (range: 0.01- 
5.6) years. A family history 
of HA and FVIII inhibitors was reported in 27 (52.9%) and 3 (5.9%) 
patients, respectively. Forty- 
seven patients (92.2%) had FVIII:C <1%. 
High- 
risk/null mutations (including intron 22 inversions, nonsense/
stop/splice site mutations and large deletions) were identified in 80.4% 
of patients (Table 1). One patient had no clear causal mutation in the 
FVIII coding region but had a polymorphism in exon 14 (c.3780 C>G).
3.2 | Dosing and exposure
Octanate® was administered to 51 patients, with a mean of 136.33 
(±246.3) EDs and a mean dose of 38.4 (±28.6) IU/kg/ED. The total 
number of EDs was 6953. At study end, 40 (78.4%) patients had 100 
or more EDs. Forty- 
six (90.2%) patients had exceeded 50 EDs and 2 
(3.9%) had 20- 
49 EDs. Three patients (5.9%) had <20 EDs: one patient 
withdrew consent after 10 EDs; one was lost to follow- 
up after 3 EDs; 
and for one patient who developed an inhibitor, treatment was termi-
nated due to completion of the study after 17 EDs.
Prophylaxis was the most common reason for treatment, accounting 
for 3027 EDs. ITI accounted for 1869 EDs, treatment of bleeds for 1817 
EDs, surgical procedures for 149 EDs and IVR assessments for 106 EDs.
The mean (±SD) number of prophylactic EDs was 53.2 (±32.1), 
and the mean prophylactic dose per ED was 30.7 (±6.9) IU/kg. For 
the treatment of bleeds (n = 1442), the mean number of infusions per 
bleed was 1.27 (±0.82, range: 1- 
17), and the mean dose per episode/
unit body weight/ED/infusion was 30.8 (±11.03) IU/kg. Most bleeds 
(1377; 95.5%) were resolved with only 1 or 2 infusions of octanate®. 
The majority of bleeds (83.0%) were minor, with 15.3% moderate and 
1.7% severe. The severity of bleeds by site is shown in Figure 2.
3.3 | Incidence of FVIII inhibitors
FVIII inhibitors were detected in 5 of 51 (9.8%) patients; 4 cases were 
high- 
titre inhibitors, 1 was a low- 
titre inhibitor (Table 2). Clinically rel-
evant inhibitors (defined as at least 2 positive titres and a decrease 
in IVR of FVIII) were reported in 3 (5.9%) patients. Two patients had 
transient inhibitors that disappeared during regular octanate® treat-
ment without a change in dose or treatment frequency and were con-
sidered clinically irrelevant. Of the 51 patients in the study, 4 had an 
FVIII:C level ≥1%, and 2 patients who did not develop inhibitors had 
<20 EDs. Excluding these patients, the incidence of inhibitor develop-
ment was 11.1% (5/45) for all inhibitors, 8.9% (4/45) for high- 
titre 
inhibitors and 6.7% (3/45) for clinically relevant inhibitors.

All clinically relevant inhibitors were detected within the first 
20 EDs. All the patients who developed inhibitors were receiving on- 
demand treatment and had major F8 gene defects, either intron 22 
inversions (n = 4) or large deletions of exons 7- 
12 (n = 1). The patient 
who developed the highest inhibitor titre had a family history of inhib-
itors. No new inhibitors were detected in any patient beyond 50 EDs, 
and no new high- 
titre inhibitors were detected beyond 20 EDs.
3.4 | FVIII recovery
Although IVR determination was optional in this study, 44 of the 51 pa-
tients underwent at least one IVR assessment, 36 had a second and one 
had a third assessment. Notable levels of FVIII were evident in the blood 
at 15 minutes postinfusion and remained high at 1 hour (Figure 3).
Mean (±SD) incremental IVR was 2.0%/IU/kg (±0.7) for the first 
IVR assessment (n = 44) and 1.9%/IU/kg (±0.5) for the second assess-
ment (n = 36).
3.5 | Haemostatic efficacy
Haemostatic efficacy was rated as “excellent” for 99.6%, “good” for 
0.3% and “moderate” for 0.02% of all infusions (Table 3). The majority 
of bleeds (95.5%) resolved within 1 or 2 days of treatment (81.2% and 
14.3%, respectively). All minor bleeds and the majority of moderate 
(95.0%) and severe bleeds (76.0%) resolved within 3 days of treatment. 
Efficacy for all but one of the 2611 prophylactic infusions was rated as 
“excellent” (one was rated as “good”), and efficacy for all IVR infusions 
with available efficacy ratings (n = 80/81) was rated as “excellent.”
Twenty- 
three surgical procedures in 19 patients using octanate® 
as haemostatic cover were evaluated for efficacy. Five procedures in 
one patient undergoing ITI were excluded from analysis. Efficacy for 
all 201 infusions was rated as “excellent.” Eighteen procedures were 
classed as minor (78.3%), whilst 5 (21.7%) were major. Mean (±SD) 
total dose per ED was 56.7 IU/kg (±15.8) for minor procedures and 
59.2 IU/kg (±9.0) for major procedures, during a mean of 5.9 (±2.9) 
and 8.4 (±1.5) EDs, respectively. No FVIII inhibitors developed after 
major surgeries, and 2 patients who underwent minor surgeries devel-
oped transient inhibitors that resolved without changes to octanate® 
treatment. Major surgeries are summarized in Table 4. There was one 
case of intracranial haemorrhage, which was treated by craniotomy 
without further complications.
3.6 | Safety and tolerability
A total of 260 treatment- 
emergent AEs were recorded in 45 (88.2%) 
patients. AEs reported were typical for any paediatric or haemophilia

population monitored over a long period. Of the 260 AEs, 78 reported 
in 34 patients were serious adverse events (SAEs). Twenty- 
one AEs 
were considered probably or possibly related to octanate®: 16 cases 
of asymptomatic parvovirus B19 seroconversions and 5 cases of FVIII 
inhibitor development. These were classified as SAEs according to the 
study protocol.
The tolerability of octanate® was considered “very good” in the 
vast majority of the 8674 infusions (99.98%) and 2 (0.02%) were 
 
assessed as “good”.
4 | DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The immunogenicity and efficacy of octanate® were investigated in 
paediatric PUPs, and a low rate of inhibitor development was observed. 
In the 51 PUPs in this study, 5 (9.8%) patients developed inhibitors, 4 
(7.8%) of which were high titre. Of these, only 3 (5.9%) were consid-
ered clinically relevant, all of which developed within the first 20 EDs 
after on- 
demand treatment. The other 2 patients developed transient 
inhibitors that disappeared during regular octanate® treatment with-
out a change in dose or treatment frequency. Within the 45 patients 
who reached ≥20 EDs (or developed an inhibitor <20 EDs) and had 
FVIII:C <1% at baseline, the incidence of inhibitor development was 
11.1%. This inhibitor incidence compares very favourably with histori-
cal reports of incidences of up to 45% in similar populations.4,5,22
The influence of FVIII product type on inhibitor incidence has 
been intensely debated over the past decade. Some studies and meta- 
analyses have reported an increased inhibitor risk with rFVIII compared 
with pdFVIII,5,23-27 whereas other studies and meta- 
analyses reported 
no difference in inhibitor risk.4,7,12,28,29 In a retrospective study of 99 
PUPs, no inhibitors were detected in 11 PUPs treated with wilate®, a 
pdFVIII concentrate containing FVIII and VWF in a physiological 1:1 
ratio, and inhibitors were detected in 38% of PUPs treated with rFVIII 
concentrates derived from hamster cell lines.5
Comparisons of inhibitor risk have been limited by the heteroge-
neity of study designs and patient populations. For example, the EPIC 
study attempted to confirm a reported inhibitor incidence of only 4% 
reported by Kurnik et al30 with a weekly prophylaxis regimen and in 
fact found inhibitor development in 42% of patients.31 The small co-
hort size of studies reporting inhibitor development likely contributes 
to discrepancies and must be taken into account when attempting to 
make direct comparisons. A meta- 
analysis attempted to overcome 
some of these limitations by analysing data in 761 PUPs with severe 
or moderate haemophilia.9 Unadjusted inhibitor rates were higher in 
patients treated with rFVIII compared with patients treated with pd-
FVIII (40% vs 22%); however, this difference did not persist after ad-
justment for confounding factors.9
More recently, the results of the first randomized controlled study 
to investigate the impact of FVIII types on inhibitor incidence were pub-
lished. The SIPPET study compared inhibitor rates in PUPs treated with 
pdFVIII (n = 125) or hamster cell line- 
derived rFVIII (n = 126).6 By univar-
iate Cox regression analysis, rFVIII was associated with an 87% higher 
risk of inhibitor development than pdFVIII (cumulative incidence 44.5% 
vs 26.8%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.87) and a 69% higher risk of developing 
high- 
titre inhibitors (cumulative incidence 28.4% vs 18.6%; HR: 1.69). 
The associations did not change substantially after adjustment for pu-
tative confounders.6 It is important to note the large variation between 
the inhibitor rate reported in patients treated with pdFVIII in the SIPPET 
study (26.8%) and the rate reported in this study (11.1%) may be related 
to differences in patient populations studied. For example, the majority 
of patients enrolled in the SIPPET study were from Egypt, India and Iran, 
whereas patients enrolled in this study were exclusively Caucasian.
Mouse studies have demonstrated higher levels of FVIII inhibitors 
following administration of hamster cell- 
derived rFVIII products com-
pared with pdFVIII, and pre- 
incubation of rFVIII with VWF has been 
shown to reduce rFVIII immunogenicity. This suggests that an underly-
ing cause of product- 
related development of a FVIII immune response 
may lie in the VWF- 
binding affinity and the presence of antigenic epi-
topes in animal cell- 
derived rFVIII products.17,32
A number of reports have suggested that the use of on- 
demand 
treatment is associated with a higher risk of inhibitor development 
than regular prophylaxis.33 In this study, all 5 patients who devel-
oped inhibitors received on- 
demand treatment. Furthermore, a high 
intensity of FVIII exposure (≥150 IU/kg/wk) is considered a strong 
risk factor for inhibitor development in PUPs, especially during surgi-
cal coverage.9 In this study, 2 patients developed transient inhibitors 
during surgery. Reported inhibitor rates may vary depending on the 
frequency of testing; in this study, patients were tested frequently for 
FVIII inhibitor development.34
Certain mutation types, such as intron 22 inversions, have been 
associated with a substantially higher risk of inhibitor development.35 
Intron 22 inversions were observed in 52.9% (27/51) of patients in this 
study. Two of these 27 patients (7.4%) developed clinically relevant 
FVIII inhibitors.

In this study, the mean incremental IVR of octanate® of 2.0%/IU/
kg (±0.7) for the first assessment (n = 44) and 1.9%/IU/kg (±0.5) for 
the second assessment (n = 36) are slightly lower than the 2.4%/IU/kg 
observed for octanate® in adults, which is consistent with an expected 
lower IVR for children compared with adults.36 The values are consis-
tent with values reported for other FVIII concentrates in previously 
treated paediatric patients.37-40
The haemostatic efficacy of octanate® was rated in the study as 
“excellent” in 99.6% of administrations, irrespective of the reason 
for administration. Most bleeds (95.5%) resolved within 1 or 2 days. 
Octanate® tolerability was rated “very good” in 99.9% of infusions. No 
deaths were reported, and few SAEs were deemed possibly or proba-
bly linked to octanate®, namely 16 asymptomatic parvovirus B19 se-
roconversions and development of FVIII inhibitors in 5 patients, which 
were reported as SAEs in accordance with the study protocol. Due to 
the high prevalence of parvovirus B19 within the community, it is not 
possible to definitively assign these seroconversions to treatment with 
octanate®.
Early and efficient prophylaxis is key to successful long- 
term man-
agement of patients with HA.13 The data reported here demonstrate 
that octanate® is associated with a low rate of inhibitor development 
in PUPs, including those undergoing surgical procedures. The data 
are consistent with previous findings in PTPs demonstrating that oc-
tanate® is an efficacious and well- 
tolerated human FVIII for the man-
agement of patients with HA.
