Abstract
Inflammatory gene expression following genotoxic cancer therapy is well documented, yet the 
events underlying its induction remain poorly understood. Inflammatory cytokines modify the 
tumor microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and are critical for both local and systemic 
(abscopal) tumor responses to radiotherapy1. An enigmatic feature of this phenomenon is its 
delayed onset (days), in contrast to the acute DNA damage responses that occur in minutes to 
hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate limiting steps that are essential for 
DNA-damage induced inflammation. Here, we show that cell cycle progression through mitosis 
following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) leads to the formation of micronuclei, which precede 
activation of inflammatory signaling and are a repository for the pattern recognition receptor 
cGAS. Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by cGAS-STING 
impaired interferon signaling. Moreover, STING loss prevented the regression of abscopal tumors 
in the context of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. These findings

 implicate temporal modulation of the cell cycle as an important consideration in the context of 
therapeutic strategies that combine genotoxic agents with immune checkpoint blockade.
Radiotherapy and many chemotherapeutics rely on DNA double strand break (DSB) 
formation to drive the killing of tumor cells over several cell division cycles2. Concomitant 
with this protracted cell death schedule, inflammatory cytokine production increases over 
days following the insult3, 4. We used STAT1 phosphorylation at Y701 as a surrogate for 
inflammatory pathway activation after ionizing radiation (IR) (Fig. 1a and 1b). MCF10A 
mammary epithelial cells showed STAT1 activation between 3 and 6 days post-IR after 
doses ≥5Gy. Total STAT1 protein and the mRNA levels of multiple inflammatory genes 
were also detected in a time dependent manner (Fig. 1c. and Extended data 1a). Using 
inducible nucleases (Fig. 1d and Extended data 1b and 1c), we observed a delayed 
accumulation of active STAT1 and inflammatory gene expression, confirming these signals 
are driven by DSBs.
We reasoned that if residual DSBs were driving inflammatory signals then failure of non-
homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DSB repair should amplify the response. Paradoxically, we 
observed that inhibition of DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKi) or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of multiple 
NHEJ components diminished STAT1 activation in MCF10A and prostate epithelial cells 
(Fig 1e and Extended data 1c and 1d). STAT1 activation through exogenous IFNβ1 was 
unaffected by DNA-PKi (Extended data 1e), ruling out a direct role in STAT1 
phosphorylation. Inhibition of ATM kinase had little influence over the level of STAT1 
activation (Extended data 1f).
DSB-induced STAT1 activation correlated with the appearance of aberrantly shaped nuclei 
and micronuclei (Fig 1f and 2a). The DSB marker γH2AX was increased in micronuclei 
however 53BP1 was absent, consistent with DSB signaling defects (Fig 1f)5, 6. Nuclei of 
NHEJ knockout and DNA-PKi treated cells were morphologically normal despite being 
replete with DSBs (Fig 1f and 2a). As micronuclei are byproducts of mitotic progression, 
this suggested that STAT1 activation occurred following mitosis7. Flow cytometry showed 
progression from G2 into G1 between 24 and 48h post-IR, whereas NHEJ knockouts were 
static over this time (Extended data 2a). This corresponds to a wave of parental cells moving 
into mitosis as evidenced by phospho-histone H3 staining that is absent in the NHEJ 
knockout cells (Fig 2b). Notably, the specific CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (CDK1i) or PLK1 
inhibitor BI-2536 (PLK1i) blocked mitotic entry, micronuclei formation and STAT1 
activation (Figs 2a–2c and extended data 2b.). Furthermore inhibition of cell cycle 
progression by other CDKi reduced the flux of cells through mitosis and STAT1 activation 
(Extended data 2c). CDK1i also prevented STAT1 activation in PARPi treated BRCA1 
mutated ovarian cancer cells (Fig 2d), suggesting mitotic entry as a gateway to inflammatory 
signaling from diverse DSB inducing stimuli. To further test the requirement for mitotic 
progression, we synchronized cells in G2 before irradiation. Release from CDK1i after IR 
resulted in progression from G2 into the following G1 over 72h as determined by loss of the 
S/G2-phase and mitosis marker CENP-F (Fig 2e). STAT1 phosphorylation levels were 
greater than that observed in asynchronous cells and absent in cells not released from G2 
(Fig 2f).

 STAT1 phosphorylation can be elicited following activation of the DNA dependent pattern 
recognition receptor (PRR) cGAS and its downstream mediators STING and IRF3, which 
serve to transcriptionally activate type I interferon8–16. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of either 
cytosolic cGAS or STING reduced activation of downstream IRF3 target genes ISG54, 
ISG56 and the NF-κB target CCL5 post-IR (Fig 3a and Extended data 3a)17, 18. Attenuated 
STAT1 activation and IFITM1 induction was also evident in cGAS-STING knockouts (Fig 
3b and Extended data 3c). Senescence associated β-galatosidase staining was relatively 
unaffected by treatments that influence inflammatory activation (Extended data 3c), 
suggesting that alterations in epithelial cell senescence were not contributory to the reduced 
interferon signaling observed upon inhibiting mitotic entry or PRR activation.
cGAS localization was prominent in lamin B2 positive micronuclei of CENP-F negative 
(G1) cells three days following IR (Fig. 3c, 3d and Extended data 3d and 3e). Synchronized 
cells showed cGAS localization to micronuclei concomitant with mitotic passage, G1 
accumulation and STAT1 activation (Fig 2e–f and Extended data 4a). Delayed accumulation 
of mCherry- cGAS in micronuclei was also observed (Extended data 4b) and live-cell 
microscopy showed dynamic and persistent relocalization of cGAS to micronuclei following 
mitosis (Fig 3e and Supplementary Video 1). Interestingly, cGAS localized to bulk 
chromatin during mitosis, but dissociated at completion of mitosis. cGAS concentrated in 
the micronuclei after a transient delay, consistent with reported changes in permeability due 
to delayed micronuclear envelope rupture19. The live cell imaging revealed ~20% of 
daughter cells undergoing rapid post-mitotic apoptosis (Supplementary Video 2). The 
remaining 80% of daughter cells all contained micronuclei, the majority of which showed 
strong and persistent cGAS concentration (Extended data 4c).
The preceding data support a model whereby loss of micronuclear envelope integrity can 
provide access to damaged DNA. When MCF10A cells were subjected to migration through 
3µm pores we observed cGAS localization to both micronuclei and nuclear blebs consistent 
with nuclear envelop disruption and transient DSB production (Extended data 4d and 4e)20. 
cGAS positivity of these subcellular structures still occurred in the presence of CDKi, 
demonstrating that mechanical nuclear rupture bypasses the need for mitotic progression. 
Furthermore, micronuclei generated using Aurora B kinase inhibition were cGAS positive 
and elicited robust STAT1 activation without irradiation (Extended data 4f and 4g).
Micronuclei harboring accumulated cGAS may act to initiate inflammatory signaling. RNA 
FISH revealed coincident expression of interferon-stimulated gene ISG54 specifically in 
cells containing micronuclei (p≤0.001 at 6D post-20Gy by paired t-test; Fig 3f). This effect 
was abrogated by knockout of cGAS, STING, or XRCC4, and by CDK1i. In an independent 
test of this association, expression of an IFNβ1 promoter controlled eGFP transgene 
increased specifically in micronucleated cells at 6 days following 10Gy (p≤0.01 by 1-way 
ANOVA; Extended data 5a). These findings firmly establish a significant relationship 
between the presence of micronuclei and inflammatory signaling. We cannot ascribe the 
inflammatory response solely to micronuclei as small DNA fragments in the cytoplasm 
could also contribute to cGAS-STING activation10, 21. However, our data show robust 
relocalization of cGAS to the micronucleus and activation of inflammatory responses within 
these micronucleated cells.

 Only subtle induction of nuclear pIRF3 was detected by immunofluorescence in damaged 
cells (Extended data 5b). This suggests that chronic DNA damage induced inflammatory 
activation emanating from cGAS positive micronuclei may differ in magnitude from the 
acute signaling that occurs within hours following transfection of microgram quantities of 
exogenous DNA (Extended data 5c). To determine if paracrine signals could amplify cGAS-
STING mediated signaling, we transferred media from irradiated cells to naïve parental cells 
and assayed for STAT1 activation (Figure 3g). These experiments reveal IR induced 
paracrine signaling that required mitotic progression and cGAS-STING.
Several case reports have described an abscopal effect defined as tumor regression outside of 
the irradiated field. This is most often observed in combination with immune checkpoint 
blockade (i.e. anti-CTLA4 antibody)22–24, suggesting that local radiation can be 
immunomodulatory. We have extensively characterized how irradiation of one tumor along 
with immune checkpoint blockade can produce T cell-dependent responses in the 
contralateral unirradiated tumor using the B16 syngeneic murine model of melanoma24, 25. 
To examine the dependence of abscopal responses on the cGAS-STING pathway, we used 
this B16 model and irradiated cells ex vivo (Fig 4a). Irradiation of B16 melanoma cells 
before injection caused significant reduction in the growth of abscopal tumors after anti-
CTLA4 treatment (Fig 4b). In contrast, implanting irradiated B16 cells harboring STING 
deletion eliminated the radiation-mediated growth delay of the abscopal tumor after anti-
CTLA4 (Fig 4b and Extended data 6a–b). Radiation in the absence of anti-CTLA4 was 
insufficient to induce the abscopal effect (Extended data 6c). The abscopal tumor volume 
reduction as measured at day 15 was not observed when the implanted cells were STING 
deficient (Fig 4c). Loss of STING in the irradiated tumor also significantly reduced overall 
survival in the mice (Extended data 6d). A similar impact on tumor size with STING loss 
was noted in abscopal tumors when the contralateral tumor was irradiated directly in the 
mice (Extended data 6e and 6f). Consistent with a requirement for T cell responses, STING 
knockout prevented the enrichment of intratumoral CD8 T cells in the abscopal tumor (Fig 
4d) 24, 26. Thus, STING signaling is a critical component of host immune activation that 
drives regression of distal tumors in RT- and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy.
Checkpoint adaptation and insensitivity has been described in a wide range of eukaryotic 
organisms27, 28. Our data support a model in which imperfect cell cycle checkpoints allow 
passage through mitosis and accumulation of micronuclei where pattern recognition occurs 
(Fig 4f). This represents a situation in which actively cycling cells contribute to delayed 
onset inflammatory signaling in the context of DSB inducing therapies. These findings 
suggest possibilities to modulate the host immune system and ultimately the success of 
genotoxic therapies.
METHODS
Cell lines and tissue culture
MCF10A cells were obtained from ATCC, stably transfected to express Cas9 as described 
below, and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of F12:DMEM media with 5% horse serum (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), 20ng/mL human EGF (Peprotech), 0.5mg/ml hydrocortisone, 100ng/ml

 previously described29 and U2OS-IPpoI and MCF10A-AsiSI cells were prepared with 
identical procedures. The AsiSI cDNA was a gift of from New England Biolabs and was 
cloned by PCR into the pLVX-PTuner vector (Clontech) with an Estrogen receptor tag 
derived by PCR from the pLVX-PTuner-IPpoI vector. B16-F10 and U2OS cells were 
purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. UWB1.289 and 
UWB1.289+BRCA1 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of 
RPMI1640 and MEGM (prepared from BulletKit, Lonza) with 10% FBS added. All cells 
were cultured in the presence of Penicillin and Streptromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Normal Prostate Epithelial Cells (PrEC) were purchased from Lonza and cultured according 
to recommended protocols. Cell lines were not authenticated futher and were verified 
mycoplasma free (Lonza).
Irradiation and cell treatments
All cells were seeded such that they reached no greater than 60–70% confluence at the time 
of treatment. Media was changed every 2–3 days following treatment. Irradiation was 
performed under ambient oxygen using a Cs-137 Gammacell irradiator (Nordion) at a dose 
rate of ~0.8Gy/min. Inhibitors were added 1h before treatment and maintained until 
collection unless otherwise noted: DNA-PKi (NU-7441, 2µM, Tocris), CDK1i (RO-3306, 
9µM, Tocris), Ruxolitinib (1µM, Cayman Chemicals), PLK1i (BI-2536, 10nM, Selleck 
Chemicals), Aurora Bi (AZD1152-HQPA, 10nM, Selleck Chemicals), CDK1/2/4i (R547, 
0.6µM, Cayman Chemicals), CDK4/6i#1 (PD332991, 1µM, Cayman Chemicals), CDK4/6i 
#2 (LY28352169, 2.5µM, Cayman Chemicals) and ATMi (Ku55933, 10µM, Selleck 
Chemicals). PARPi (AZD-2281, 5µM, LC Laboratories) was added to UWB1.289 cells and 
kept on for the duration of the 6 days before harvesting. IFNβ1 (Peprotech) was added to 
cells at 2.5ng/mL for 4h before harvesting. 2’3’-cGAMP (InvivoGen) was added to the cells 
at a concentration of 10 µg/mL for 8 hours before harvesting. For nuclease induction cells 
were incubated in Shield-1 (1µM, Chemipharma) and 4OHT (2µM, Sigma) were added for 
6h before washing twice with PBS and adding back media without drugs to allow recovery. 
For synchronization experiments cells were incubated in CDK1i for 16h then irradiated as 
necessary. Immediately following irradiation media was removed, cells washed twice in PBS 
and media without CDK1i was added for an appropriate duration. Herring testis DNA 
(Sigma) was dissolved in water and transfected into cells at the indicated concentrations 
using JetPrime reagent (Polyplus Transfection) according to manufacturers protocols.
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout
Lentivirus was produced using lentiCas9-Blast (a gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene #52962)30 
according to standard procedures, concentrated and used to infect MCF10A cells as 
described29. Cells were selected in 10µg/mL blasticidin (Invivogen) for ~1 week and 
knockouts were created by infecting cells with lentivirus created using lentiGuide-Puro (a 
gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene #52963)30 followed by selection in 1µg/mL puromycin 
(Sigma) for another week. Cells were plated such that single colonies could be isolated after 
2 weeks. Clones for NHEJ knockouts were selected by immunofluorescence staining of 
53BP1 24h after 2Gy to determine cells with elevated DSB levels. Knockout clones of 
cGAS and STING were determined by western blotting and multiple clones were pooled for 
each sgRNA. sgRNA sequences are presented in Table 1.

 B16-F10 STING knockouts were generated as previously described25, sgRNA sequences are 
presented in Table 1. Single cell clones were screened for knockout by adding cGAMP as 
described below and monitoring ISG induction. Four confirmed knockouts from each guide 
were combined together to create the B16-F10 STING knockout cell line.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed using standard methods. Briefly, cells were scraped in PBS 
and lysed in RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 alternative, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 
0.1% SDS, 40mM Tris pH8.0) with 1mM Benzamidine HCl, 1µg/mL antipain, 5µg/mL 
aprotinin, 1µg/mL leupeptin, 1mM Phenylmethansulfonyl fluoride, 10mM NaF, 2mM 
imidazole, 1.15mM Sodium molybdate, 4mM Sodium tartrate and 2mM Sodium 
orthovanadate (Sigma)) for 20 minutes on ice and cleared by centrifugation. Protein was 
quantified using Bradford reagent and 20–30µg of protein were run per lane of 4–12% Bis-
Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using either MOPS or MES buffer. Protein was 
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 350mA for 2h in transfer buffer (15% methanol, 
191mM glycine, 25mM Tris base, 0.1% SDS, pH8.3). Membranes were blocked in 5% non-
fat milk powder in PBS+0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated overnight at 4°C in primary 
antibody diluted in blocking solution. Primary antibodies are listed in Table 2. After 
extensive washing in PBST blots were incubated for 1h at room temperature (RT) in Licor 
blocking solution (1:1 with PBST) containing IRDye 800CWDonkey anti-Rabbit or IRDye 
680LT Donkey anti-Mouse secondary antibody (1:10000, Licor) as required. Blots were 
scanned on a Licor Odyssey scanner at a medium resolution setting and exported to ImageJ 
(NIH).
RT-qPCR
RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent under standard conditions. Reverse transcription 
and quantitative PCR was carried out as previously described29. Primers are listed in Table 
3.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded onto coverslips and following treatment were processed as described29 
with the following exceptions. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield Hard Set mountant 
containing DAPI (Vector Labs). For pIRF3 staining Tween20 was omitted from all buffers. 
Images were captured using a Coolsnap Myo camera (Photometrics) connected to a Nikon 
Eclips 80i microscope using a 60X oil immersion or 20X air objective and Nikon NIS-
Elements software. Images were prepared for publication using FIJI (NIH) and all channels 
of a given figure were adjusted equivalently only for brightness and contrast. Antibodies are 
listed in Table 2. Micronucleated cells were classified manually by distinct staining by DAPI 
of structures outside of the main nucleus. To enumerate cGAS positive micronuclei these 
structures were counted manually for each field and expressed as a percentage of total cells 
within the field. Total nuclear intensity was calculated on a per cell basis using FIJI (NIH). 
Graphs and statistics were prepared using Prism Graphpad.

 Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested from a single well of a 6-well plate using trypsin and washed 1x in 
PBS before fixation with dropwise addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol. After fixation on ice 
(or storage at −20°C) cells were washed 1x in PBS and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton 
X-100/PBS solution on ice for 15 minutes. Cells were washed 1x in PBS and resuspended in 
1% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution containing 1µl/sample of Phospho-histone H3 
(Serine 10) antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (DC28, Cell Signaling). After washing 
1x in PBS cells were resuspended in a solution of PBS containing 50µg/mL Propidium 
iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 100µg/mL RNAse A (Roche). Flow cytometry was 
performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo software. Single 
cells and G1/S/G2 peaks were manually gated. The gates for phospho-H3 positive cells were 
chosen by comparison to a population in which the antibody was omitted during processing.
Plasmid construction
The plasmid backbone was isolated from pLVX-pTUNER-N using Q5 polymerase and 
primers (5’-ggatccGGTATTTAAATAGATCCTCTAGTAGAGTCGGTGTC-3’, 5’-
accggtgcggccgcCGATCCCGCCCCTCTCCC -3’) for Gibson assembly. The mCherry 
fragement was isolated from the pHFUW-mCherry-TRF-FOKI plasmid31 with Q5 
polymerase and primers (5’-agaggatctatttaaataccggatccATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3’, 
5’-ccatcttcatctcgagCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3’). These two fragments were joined 
by Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) and digested with XhoI/NotI (New England 
Biolabs). cGAS was amplified by PCR from Human Lung Fibroblast DNA (Biosettia) using 
primers: 5’-catctcgagATGCAGCCTTGGCACGGAAAG-3’ and 5’-
atggcggccgcTCAAAATTCATCAAAAACTGGAAACTCATTGTTTC-3’. After digestion 
with XhoI/NotI the fragment was inserted using a Quick Ligation Kit (New England 
Biolabs). MCF10A cells were infected with virus as described above.
Live cell microscopy
The pBABE-H2B-GFP plasmid was a gift from Fred Dick (Addgene plasmid #26790)32 and 
retrovirus was created using standard protocols and introduced into MCF10A cells 
expressing mCherry-cGAS. Dual mCherry/GFP positive cells were isolated by cell sorting 
and seeded onto 35mm Mattek dishes (Mattek). Cells were synchronized with CDK1i and 
released according to the procedure described above. Imaging was started immediately after 
release. Imaging was carried out with a Deltavision microscope enclosed in a 37°C 
humidified chamber equilibrated with 5% CO2. Images were captured using a Photometrics 
CoolSnapHQ camera using a 40X air objective. Single plane images were acquired every 15 
minutes for 20–24h. Focus was stable throughout with minor manual adjustments over the 
imaging timecourse. This procedure was repeated three times during which ~100 daughter 
nuclei could be analysed, corresponding to 50 mitotic events. The mobility of the cells 
limited the ability to follow all mitotic events to completion. H2B-GFP bodies separate from 
the main nuclei were identified as micronuclei and apoptotic cells were identified by rapid 
and severe H2B-GFP condensation before complete dissociation and loss from the culture 
surface (Supplementary Video 2).

 Senescence associated β-Galactosidase assay
Cells were seeded at ~2×10^5 cells per well of a 6-well plate, treated 24h after seeding with 
IR and the indicated agents, and 6 days later were fixed and stained for SA-βGal as 
described 33. Three technical replicates were performed within at least 2 independent 
biological experiments.
Conditioned media experiments
Cells for all treatments were plated at a constant density and irradiated as described. 
Conditioned media was obtained by changing to fresh media 24h before collection and 
filtering though a 0.22µm filter. This conditioned media was transferred to naïve cells and 
protein lysates for western blotting were collected 24h later.
RNA FISH
RNA FISH was performed as described with modifications29. Cells were fixed on coverslips 
with 2% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized at least 24h and up to 1 week at 4°C in 
70% ethanol. After a brief rinse in RNA Wash buffer (10% formamide/2X SSC) cells were 
inverted into hybridization buffer containing Custom Stellaris® FISH Probes designed 
against ISG54 (NM_001547) by utilizing the Stellaris® RNA FISH Probe Designer 
(Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA) available online at www.biosearchtech.com/
stellarisdesigner. After overnight hybridization cells were washed twice for 30 minutes at 
room temperature in RNA wash buffer, once for 2 minutes in 2X SSC and mounted in 
vectashield. Imaging was performed using a 60x objective as described above. Using 
ImageJ, all images from a given treatment were combined in a montage and background 
subtracted with a rolling ball radius of 10. A threshold was chosen based on HT-DNA 
transfected cells to eliminate any remaining background that was not a clear diffraction 
limited RNA FISH spot. Cells with at least 10 FISH spots were counted as positive for 
ISG54. p-values to compare between treatments were computed using graphpad 1-way 
ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction. To compare ISG54+ normal vs. micronucleated cells 
within the treatment group a paired t-test was used.
IFNβ–GFP Reporter assay
The IFNβ-luciferase reporter plasmid was a kind give of R. Vance 34. Using Gibson 
assembly the luciferase reporter gene was swapped with eGFP (from pBABE-H2B described 
above) to form the IFNβ-GFP cassette. A fragment derived from the pLKO.1-Hygro plasmid 
(a gift from B. Weinberg, Addgene #24150) that omitted the U6 promoter sequence was 
combined with the IFNβ-GFP cassette to generate the pLKO.1-Hygro- IFNβ-GFP reporter. 
A stable MCF10A cell line was derived as described above by viral infection and selection 
with 100ug/mL hygromycin (Invivogen). Activation of GFP was monitored by microcopy in 
fixed cells. The threshold used for quantification of GFP positive cells was kept constant 
throughout all experiments. p-values were calculated using Graphpad using 1-way ANOVA 
with a Bonferroni correction.

 Transwell migration
For migration through transwells (Corning Inc.), cells were seeded at 300,000 cells/cm2 onto 
the topside of the filter membrane and left to migrate in normal culture condition for either 9 
or 24 hours. For experiments involved CDK1i, cells were exposed to 9 µM CDK1i and 
DMSO for 1 hour prior to the seeding onto Transwells. Transwell membrane was fixed in 
4% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 minutes, followed by permeabilization by 0.25% Triton-X 
(Sigma) for 10 minutes, blocked by 5% BSA (Sigma) and overnight incubation in various 
primary antibodies: lamin-A/C (Santa Cruz), lamin-B (Santa Cruz) and cGas (Cell 
Signalling). Finally, the primary antibodies were tagged with the corresponding secondary 
antibodies for 1.5 hours (ThermoFisher). DNA was stained with 8µM Hoechst 33342 
(ThermoFisher) for 15 minutes. Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 
system using a 63×/1.4 NA oil-immersion lens.
Modified RadVax procedure
Five to seven week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River and 
maintained under pathogen free conditions. Mice were divided randomly into cages upon 
arrival and are randomly injected and measured without blinding. All animal experiments 
were performed according to protocols approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use 
Committee of the University of Pennsylvania (IACUC). The minimal number of animals 
was used based on prior experience to yield consistent measurements. On the day before the 
experiment was to begin B16-F10 cells were treated as necessary in vitro with 10Gy of IR 
with or without CDK1i. As necessary the CDK1i was added 1h before irradiation and 
maintained until cell isolation and injection on day 2 below. On Day 0 untreated B16-F10 
cells (5×104) in 50µL of PBS were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD 
Biosciences) and injected into the right flank. On Day 2 5×105 B16-F10 parental or STING 
knockout cells treated as described above were mixed with matrigel and injected on the 
opposite flank. On Days 5, 8 and 11 anti-CTLA4 antibody (9H10; BioXCell) was 
administered interperitoneally at 200µg per mouse. Volumes were measured using calipers 
starting at day 11 and calculated using the formula L × W2 × 0.52, where L is the longest 
dimension and W is perpendicular to L. Animals are euthanized when either tumor reached 
1.5cm in the largest dimension according to IACUC guidelines. Overall survival and flow 
cytometry for tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cells was performed as described25. For the in situ 
irradiation experiments of Extended Data 4e and 4f experiments were performed using the 
Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SAARP) as previously described24.
