Abstract
Maladaptive aggressive behavior is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders1 and is 
thought to partly result from inappropriate activation of brain reward systems in response to 
aggressive or violent social stimuli2. Nuclei within the ventromedial hypothalamus3–5, extended 
amygdala6 and limbic7 circuits are known to encode initiation of aggression; however, little is 
known about the neural mechanisms that directly modulate the motivational component of 
aggressive behavior8. To address this, we established a mouse model to measure the valence of 
aggressive inter-male social interaction with a smaller subordinate intruder as reinforcement for 
the development of conditioned place preference (CPP). Aggressors (AGG) develop a CPP, while 
non-aggressors (NON) develop a conditioned place aversion (CPA), to the intruder-paired context. 
Further, we identify a functional GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain (BF) to the lateral 
habenula (lHb) that bi-directionally controls the valence of aggressive interactions. Circuit-specific 
silencing of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of AGG with halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0) increases lHb 
neuronal firing and abolishes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Activation of GABAergic BF-

 lHb terminals of NON with channelrhodopsin (ChR2) decreases lHb neuronal firing and promotes 
CPP to the intruder-paired context. Lastly, we show that altering inhibitory transmission at BF-lHb 
terminals does not control the initiation of aggressive behavior. These results demonstrate that the 
BF-lHb circuit plays a critical role in regulating the valence of inter-male aggressive behavior and 
provide novel mechanistic insight into the neural circuits modulating aggression reward 
processing.
To study individual differences in aggression, we adapted the sensory contact model of 
social defeat for CD-1 mice9–11 that exhibit a wide spectrum of aggressive behaviors. In this 
procedure (Fig. 1a), a sexually experienced adult male CD-1 mouse is presented with a 
series of novel 6–8 week old subordinate male C57BL/6J intruder mice, who do not 
themselves exhibit any aggressive behaviors towards CD-1s (Extended Data Figure 1a–i). 
This procedure identifies individual differences in antagonist aggressive behaviors without 
producing lasting stress-related behavioral phenotypes (Extended Data Table 1). Ethological 
analysis revealed that approximately 70% (310/448) of mice exhibited aggressive behavior 
(termed aggressors, AGG) during at least one session, while approximately 30% (138/448) 
failed to initiate aggressive behavior (termed non-aggressors, NON) at any time (Fig. 1b).
Following repeated intruder interactions, AGG have elevated serum testosterone (Fig. 1c) 
and decreased corticosterone (Fig. 1d) levels relative to NON, suggesting that NON may be 
less dominant and experience forced intruder interactions as more stressful. Analysis of 
several common metrics for aggression revealed normalized distributions across AGG that 
increased between screening sessions (Fig. 1e–f, Extended Data Figure 2a–g). Importantly, 
the mean number of attack bouts (Extended Data Figure 2f) and mean duration of attack 
bouts (Extended Data Figure 2g) significantly correlate to mean attack latency. Therefore, 
attack latency provides a reliable index of aggression behaviors. Subsequently, we focused 
on AGG that exhibited attack latencies within the most aggressive quartile of the sample 
distribution. These data confirm that outbred CD-1 mice exhibit a wide spectrum of 
aggressive behavior and physiological responses to an intruder, leading us to hypothesize 
that there may be differences in the valence of intruder interactions among AGG and NON.
To assay the motivational state associated with intruder pairings, we developed an 
aggression-based conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure. In this model, CD-1 mice 
are screened for aggression phenotype and then conditioned for CPP (Fig. 1g) by receiving 
novel C57BL/6J intruder-paired or intruder-unpaired sessions twice a day for three days. 
AGG show a CPP for the intruder-paired context, while NON show a conditioned place 
aversion (CPA) (Fig 1h–j, Extended Data Figure 3a–d). CPA in NON does not appear to 
result from baseline differences in mood and anxiety or lack of interest in social targets 
(Extended Data Table 1 and 2). However, we found that the valence of intruder interactions 
in AGG and NON is dependent upon intruder mice being freely moving and physically 
accessible during conditioning. Using a sensory CPP procedure in which the intruder mouse 
is placed in a protective cage within the intruder-paired context, both CPP and CPA are 
abolished (Fig. 1 k–n, Extended Data Figure 3e–h). These data demonstrate individual 
differences in the positive or negative valence of intruder interactions in AGG versus NON.

 Clinical2,12 and pre-clinical8 studies have implicated basal forebrain (BF) structures, such as 
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), lateral septum (LS), and diagonal band nuclei (DBN), as 
potentially important brain regions controlling aggression-related behaviors. However, there 
has been limited functional evidence that the BF, or its projections, directly modulate the 
rewarding aspects of aggression. To define BF projections, we injected an adeno-associated 
virus (AAV) vector expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under a 
neuronal-specific human synapsin (hSyn) promoter (AAV2-hSyn-eYFP) into the BF of 
CD-1 mice (Fig. 2a–c, top; Extended Data Figure 4a–c) targeted specifically to the more 
anterior septo-accumbal transition zone of the basal forebrain13 and observe a prominent 
axonal projection to the lHb (Fig. 2b, top).
To further characterize BF-lHb projections, we injected the lHb (Fig. 2a–b, bottom) with a 
retrograde monosynaptic glycoprotein dead Rabies virus (G-deleted-Rabies-eGFP)14. Within 
the anterior BF that overlaps with our anterograde viral infection, we observed retrograde 
labeling in the septum (~45%), DBN (~35%) and the medial NAc shell (~15%) (Fig. 2c–d, 
bottom). Within retrogradely labeled BF slices, we performed in situ hybridization for 
GAD67, a marker of inhibitory GABAergic neurons, and observed co-localization within the 
septum (~75%), DBN (~80%) and medial NAc shell (100%) (Fig. 2e).
To identify whether BF and lHb neurons are differentially activated by intruder interactions 
in AGG and NON, we examined c-Fos immunoreactivity (IR) 1-hr following the final 
intruder screening. AGG exhibit elevated c-Fos IR in the septo-accumbal transition zone of 
the BF relative to NON (Fig. 2f–g). Within the eYFP positive BF terminal fields in the 
medial lHb, NON exhibit increased c-Fos IR nuclei relative to AGG (Fig. 2f–g). This finding 
was corroborated by slice electrophysiology, where NON exhibit an increase in lHb firing 
rates compared to AGG 1-hr after an intruder interaction that returns to baseline by 7-d 
following intruder interaction (Fig. 2h–i). Together, these data show that lHb neurons are 
differentially regulated by intruder interactions, possibly through inhibitory BF inputs.
To determine the functional contribution of BF-lHb projections, we conducted optogenetic 
circuit-specific terminal photostimulation in combination with slice electrophysiology with 
channelrhodopsin (AAV2-hSyn-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP) or halorhodopsin (AAV2-hSyn-
NpHR3.0-eYFP), identifying photostimulation parameters that produce robust transient lHb 
activation or inhibition without rebound neuronal firing. ChR2BF→lHb terminal 
photostimulation with 40 Hz resulted in significantly decreased lHb firing rates (Fig. 2j–k), 
while NpHR3BF→lHb (8-s on, 2-s off) terminal photostimulation resulted in a robust increase 
in postsynaptic lHb firing rates (Fig. 2l–m). Importantly, whole cell recordings from lHb 
neurons during ChR2BF→lHb terminal photostimulation showed a significant increase in 
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that was completely blocked by the GABAA 
receptor antagonist, gabazine (Extended Data Figure 4d–e). Optically induced IPSCs 
exhibited a response delay of ~7 ms (Extended Data Figure 4f), which is in line with 
previously published response delays for ChR2 at monosynaptic circuits. Similarly, 
anterograde tracing of BF terminals in the lHb revealed that they were co-localized with 
vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), but not vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) 
(Extended Data Figure 4g). To validate these findings within an intact system, we utilized 
multi-electrode recording of postsynaptic lHb firing rates in anesthetized mice in

 combination with terminal photostimulation (Extended Data Figure 5a). Results show that 
activation (40 Hz ChR2BF→lHb), or inhibition (8-s on, 2-s off NpHR3BF→lHb) of presynaptic 
BF terminals in the lHb resulted in decreased or increased lHb postsynaptic neuronal firing, 
respectively (Extended Data Figure 5b–d). These functional in vitro and in vivo recordings 
of ChR2BF→lHb and NpHR3BF→lHb, confirm inhibitory GABAergic control over circuit 
activity and demonstrate reliable temporal control of lHb firing rates by optogenetic tools for 
in vivo behavioral analysis.
To investigate the functional consequences of BF-lHb neuronal firing on aggression reward, 
we paired photostimulation of ChR2BF→lHb and NpHR3BF→lHb in AGG and NON during 
the CPP test (Fig. 3a–b). NON::ChR2BF→lHb stimulation promoted CPP (Fig. 3c–e), 
mimicking responses observed in control AGG. Conversely, AGG::NpHR3BF→lHb 
stimulation induced CPA (Fig. 3f–h), mimicking responses observed in control NON. 
Neither NON::NpHR3BF→lHb or AGG::ChR2BF→lHb stimulation significantly affected the 
expression of CPP or CPA. Viral expression (Extended Data Figure 6a–f) and locomotor 
activity (Extended Data Figure 6g–j) was not different between conditions. These data 
confirm that BF-lHb circuitry modulates the rewarding component of aggressive behavior 
and is both necessary and sufficient for the expression of CPP in AGG and CPA in NON.
To determine if these circuit-specific effects could be recapitulated by direct lHb cell body 
manipulation, we injected the lHb with AAV2-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP or AAV-hSyn-NpHR3.0-
eYFP (Extended Data Figure 7a–d) and directly stimulated lHb cell bodies using previously 
established optogenetic parameters for lHb15. NON::NpHR3.0lHb stimulation to decreases 
lHb firing promoted CPP to the intruder-paired side (Extended Data Figure 7e–g), whereas, 
AGG::ChR2lHb stimulation to increases lHb firing, induced CPA to the intruder-paired side 
(Extended Data Figure 7h–j). Taken together, these results implicate the lHb as a key 
modulator of aggression motivational state.
To determine if BF-lHb neuronal activity regulates the initiation or intensity of aggressive 
behavior, we utilized ChR2BF→lHb and NpHR3BF→lHb (Fig. 4a) in AGG and NON during 
home cage resident-intruder testing (Fig. 4b). Neither activation nor inhibition of BF-lHb 
terminals resulted in initiation of aggressive behavior (Fig. 4c–d), nor did it modulate social 
(Fig. 4e) and non-social (Fig. 4f) exploratory behaviors in NON mice. Similarly, 
AGG::ChR2BF→lHb stimulation failed to initiate immediate attack behavior, as indexed by 
no change in attack latency (Fig. 4g). However, AGG::ChR2BF→lHb and 
AGG::NpHR3BF→lHb stimulation bi-directionally modulated the severity of the aggressive 
behavior relative to each other, though a nonsignificant trend was observed when either were 
compared to AGG::GFPBF→lHb (Fig. 4h). As observed in NON, AGG::ChR2BF→lHb and 
AGG::NpHR3BF→lHb photostimulation failed to alter either social (Fig. 4i) or non-social 
(Fig. 4j) exploratory behaviors. These data indicate that the BF-lHb circuit is important in 
modulating the intensity of aggressive behavior; however, it is not a traditional attack 
initiation area.
Based on this data, we hypothesized that the BF-lHb circuit acts in other affective behavioral 
domains. We performed a behavioral battery to measure non-social generalized anxiety 
states and reward in naive CD-1 mice (Extended Data Figure 8a). Both ChR2BF→lHb and

 NpHR3BF→lHb terminal photostimulation failed to modulate anxiety-like behaviors in the 
open field (Extended Data Figure 8b–c) and elevated plus maze tasks (Extended Data Figure 
8d–e). However, ChR2BF→lHb stimulation potentiates the rewarding effects of cocaine by 
increasing the amount of time spent in the cocaine-paired chamber (Extended Data Figure 
8f). Therefore, while the BF-lHb circuit does not influence a generalized anxiety phenotype 
in the absence of social context or other stimuli, it does generalize to non-social rewarding 
stimuli such as cocaine.
Our results show individual differences in the rewarding properties of aggressive social 
interaction that are mediated by the BF-lHb circuit. When exposed to an intruder, AGG 
exhibit increased activity of the BF and a concomitant reduction in lHb neuronal firing 
relative to NON, contributing to a behavioral preference for environmental contexts 
associated with the interaction. Importantly, this circuit is not sufficient to induce attack 
behavior. Although anatomical studies have identified this BF projection to the lHb in mice 
and rats16–18, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) suggests probabilistic tract connections 
between the BF and lHb in humans19, this is the first study to provide functional evidence 
that GABAergic BF projections produce inhibitory control of lHb neurons to regulate the 
valence of aggressive intruder-based interactions. Stimulation or inhibition of BF-lHb 
projections is both sufficient and necessary to alter the positive or negative valence of an 
intruder-paired context. Our findings advance the understanding of lHb function in a 
behaviorally relevant animal model of aggression motivation and provide further 
understanding into the physiology and neural circuitry of aggression and reward-related 
behaviors.
While numerous functions have been ascribed to lHb20 neuronal activity including 
anxiety21, addiction22, and depression23, there is a noticeable paucity of functional data 
addressing the role of lHb inputs, outside of those originating from the VTA region, within 
any of these behavioral domains. Indeed, anatomical tracing experiments have highlighted 
the complexity of lHb afferents24 and efferents25. With regard to the BF, the LS, DBN, and 
medial NAc shell, but not core, are known to send projections to the lHb24,26. Our current 
study implicates the septo-accumbal transition zone of BF as a critical source of GABAergic 
tone to the lHb within the context of motivated behavior. However, based on the fact that 
these BF GABAergic inputs to lHb exhibit high tonic activation in acute slice that can be 
rapidly inhibited by terminal inhibition with NpHR3 (Fig. 2l–m), it is unlikely that they are 
NAc medium spiny neurons. Lastly, based on both in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological 
studies, as well as anatomical tracing, we note that there may be a small subset of cells in the 
BF that either release an excitatory neurotransmitter or act indirectly on the lHb via di-
synaptic inputs. It will be interesting in the future to determine what role these neurons play 
in reward processing.
Our results may provide important information to clinical studies identifying novel targets of 
deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions that present 
with aggression co-morbidity such as substance abuse27 and depression28. DBS protocols 
within specific BF nuclei29 and lHb30 have been successfully used to treat intractable major 
depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with symptoms of increased aggression in 
men28. Overall, our findings demonstrate a previously unidentified functional role for the

Online/Supplemental Methods
Animals
Male CD-1 (ICR) mice (35–45 g, sexually experienced retired breeders; Charles River 
Laboratories) were obtained at 4 months of age. All breeders were confirmed by CRL to 
have had equal access, experience and success as breeders. Male C57BL/6J mice (20–30 g; 
The Jackson Laboratory) were obtained at 7–8 weeks of age and used as novel intruders. All 
mice were allowed 1 week of acclimation to the housing facilities before the start of 
experiments. CD-1 mice were single housed, and C57BL/6J mice were group housed. All 
mice were maintained on a 12-h light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. 
Procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee.
Aggression screening and ethological analysis
Aggression screening was performed as previously described10. Following a minimum of 1 
week habituation to home cages, experimental CD-1 mice were exposed to a novel 
C57BL/6J intruder for 3 minutes daily over 3 consecutive days. Each intruder presentation 
was performed in the home-cage of the CD-1 between 1–3 PM daily under white light 
conditions. During screening sessions the cage top along with feeding and water apparatus 
were replaced with a clear Plexiglass cover to allow unimpeded viewing and video-recording 
of screening sessions. The duration and number of screening sessions were selected to 
prevent induction of stress and anxiety-related behaviors in CD-1 mice (Extended Data 
Table 1, Extended Data Table 2), which has been shown to occur during extended antagonist 
encounters31. This allows for separation between aggression and stress-related states. All 
screening sessions were video recorded for later ethological analysis using a digital color 
video camera. Ethological analysis of aggression behavior was performed by 2 blinded 
observers, recording (i) latency to initial aggression, (ii) the number of aggressive bouts, (iii) 
the total duration of aggression, and (iv) the mean duration of aggressive bouts. Operational 
definitions for the above behaviors are defined as follows: Initiation of aggression is defined 
by the first clear physical antagonist interaction initiated by the CD-1, not including 
grooming or pursuit behavior. Aggressive bouts are defined by cycles of initiated aggression 
with continuous orientation by the CD-1 towards the intruder, and only defined as completed 
when the CD-1 has physically re-oriented away from the intruder. This definition allows for 
slight breaks (less than 5-s) in continuous physical interaction within an aggressive bout, 
assuming the CD-1 has remained oriented towards the intruder throughout. CD-1 mice were 
defined as AGG if they initiated aggression during any of the 3 screening sessions and NON 
were defined as those that showed no aggression during any screening sessions. All 
aggression screening was halted if an intruder showed any signs of injury in accordance with 
our previously published protocol10.

 Aggression conditioned place preference (CPP) and behavioral analysis
The aggression CPP protocol, developed based on a previously published cocaine CPP 
protocol32, consisted of three phases: pre-test, acquisition, and test. Mice were acclimated to 
the testing facility for 1 hour prior to testing. All phases were conducted under red light and 
sound-attenuated conditions. The CPP apparatus (Med Associates) consisted of two unique 
conditioning chambers with a neutral middle zone that allowed for unbiased entry into either 
conditioning chamber at the initiation of each trial. All CPP sessions were video recorded 
using Noldus Ethovision 3.0 (Noldus Information Technology). During the pre-test phase, 
mice were placed into the middle chamber of the conditioning apparatus and allowed to 
freely explore the full extent of the CPP apparatus for 20 minutes. There were no group 
differences in bias for either chamber and conditioning groups were balanced in an unbiased 
fashion to account for start side preference. The acquisition phase consisted of 3 successive 
days with two conditioning trials each day for a total of 6 acquisition trials. Morning trials 
(between 8:00AM and 10:00AM) and afternoon trials (between 3:00PM and 5:00PM) 
consisted of CD-1 mice confined to one chamber for 10 minutes while in the presence or 
absence of a novel C57BL/6J intruder. All groups were counterbalanced for conditioning 
chamber. A total of 3 conditioning trials to the intruder-paired and intruder-unpaired context 
where performed. On the test day, CD-1 mice were placed into the middle arena of the CPP 
apparatus without an intruder and allowed to freely explore both chambers for 20 minutes. 
Analysis of duration spent within either context was used to identify a CPP or CPA to the 
intruder-paired context. For optogenetic experiments, stimulation was performed during the 
full duration of the test phase. Total locomotor responses were also assessed to ensure equal 
exploratory behavior between groups. Behavioral analysis of aggression CPP data was 
performed by assessing (i) normalized CPP (test phase duration spent in the intruder-paired 
chamber divided by the pre-test duration spent in the intruder-paired chamber, accounting 
for behavior during both sessions), (ii) subtracted CPP (test phase duration spent in the 
intruder-paired chamber minus test phase duration spent in the intruder-unpaired chamber, 
accounting for test session behavior only), and lastly (iii) group and individual durations in 
both pre-test and test sessions.
Sensory CPP
Sensory CPP was performed and analyzed identically to the aggression CPP procedure, with 
the exception that the intruder C57BL6/J was placed within a physical barrier to provide 
only sensory contact with the resident CD-1 mice.
Cocaine CPP
A previously published cocaine CPP protocol32 was used, which consisted of three phases: 
pre-test, acquisition, and test. Mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 hour prior to 
testing. All phases were conducted under red light and sound-attenuated conditions. The 
CPP apparatus (Med Associates) consisted of two unique conditioning chambers with a 
neutral middle zone that allowed for unbiased entry into either conditioning chamber at the 
initiation of each trial. All CPP sessions were video recorded using Noldus Ethovision 3.0 
(Noldus Information Technology). During the pre-test phase, mice were placed into the 
middle chamber of the conditioning apparatus and allowed to freely explore the full extent

 of the CPP apparatus for 30 minutes. There were no group differences in bias for either 
chamber and conditioning groups were balanced in an unbiased fashion to account for start 
side preference. The acquisition phase consisted of 2 successive days with two conditioning 
trials each day for a total of 4 acquisition trials. Morning trials (between 8:00AM and 
10:00AM) and afternoon trials (between 3:00PM and 5:00PM) consisted of CD-1 mice 
confined to one chamber for 20 minutes paired with an intraperitoneal injection of cocaine 
(10 mg/kg); afternoon sessions were paired with saline injections. All groups were 
counterbalanced for conditioning chamber. On the test day, CD-1 mice were placed into the 
middle arena of the CPP apparatus and allowed to freely explore both chambers for 30 
minutes. Analysis of duration spent within either context was used to identify a CPP or CPA 
to the cocaine-paired context. For optogenetic experiments, stimulation was performed 
during the full duration of the test phase. Total locomotor responses were also assessed to 
ensure equal exploratory behavior between groups.
Sucrose preference
Sucrose preference was performed as previously described33. 1 week after the final 
screening session, AGG and NON mice had their standard water bottle removed and 
replaced with two 50-ml conical tubes with sipper tops filled with water. After a 24-h 
habituation period, water from one 50-ml conical tube was replaced with 1% sucrose. All 
tubes were weighed, and mice were allowed 24 h to drink. Tubes were then reweighed, and 
their locations in the wire tops were switched before a second 24-h period of drinking. At 
the end of the second day of sucrose testing, preference was calculated as the total amount of 
sucrose consumption divided by the total amount of fluid consumed over the 2 d of sucrose 
availability.
Elevated plus maze
Elevated plus maze was performed as previously described34. 1 week after the final 
screening session AGG and NON mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 hour 
prior to testing and then placed in the elevated plus maze under red light conditions for 5 
minutes. Each arm of the maze measured 12 × 50 cm. The Plexiglas cross-shaped maze 
consisted of two open arms with no walls and two closed arms (40 cm high walls) and was 
on a pedestal 1 m above floor level. Behavior was tracked using an automated system 
(Noldus Ethovision; Noldus Interactive technologies). Behavior was measured as total time 
in open and closed arms.
Open field and locomotor measures
Open field was performed as previously described34. 1 week after the final screening 
session, AGG and NON mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 hour prior to 
testing. Open-field testing was performed in black Plexiglass arenas (42 × 42 × 42 cm; 
Nationwide Plastics) under red light conditions. Testing sessions were 10 minutes long. 
Behavior was tracked using an automated system (Noldus Ethovision; Noldus Interactive 
technologies) to record the total distance moved and time spent in the total arena and a 
delineated “center zone” (24cm × 24cm).

 Forced-swim test
Forced-swim test was performed as previously described34. 1 week after the final screening 
session, AGG and NON mice were placed in the test room for an hour before behavioral 
testing for habituation. Mice were tested in a 4L Pyrex glass beaker, containing 2L of water 
at 25±1°C for 6 minutes. Behavior was videotaped (Noldus Ethovision; Noldus Interactive 
technologies) and analyzed for duration immobile, duration mobile and total movement.
Social interaction (approach)
Social approach testing was performed as previously described10. 1 week after the final 
screening session, AGG and NON mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 hour 
prior to testing, and all testing was performed under red light conditions. Mice were placed 
in an open field black Plexiglas arena (42 × 42 × 42 cm; Nationwide Plastics) with a small 
animal cage placed at one end. Their movements were then automatically monitored and 
recorded (Ethovision 3.0; Noldus Information Technology) for 2.5 minutes in the absence 
(target absent phase) of a social target. This phase is used to determine baseline exploratory 
behavior. We then immediately measure 2.5 minutes of exploratory behavior in the presence 
of a caged novel CD–1 or C57BL/6J mouse (target present phase), again recording total 
distance travelled and duration of time spent in the interaction and corner zones. Social 
interaction behavior is determined by the total time spent in each zone.
Novel object versus social target preference
The novel object vs. social target test consisted of two phases: pre-test and test on 
consecutive days as previously described35. 1 week after the final screening session, AGG 
and NON mice were acclimated to the testing facility for 1 hour prior to both sessions. All 
phases were run under red-light and sound-attenuated conditions. The testing apparatus 
(Med Associates) consisted of two identical chambers, with a neutral middle zone that 
allowed for unbiased entry into either chamber at the initiation of each trial. All sessions 
were video recorded from above (Noldus Ethovision 3.0, Noldus Information Technology) 
for later behavioral analysis. Briefly, during the pre-test phase, mice were placed into the 
middle chamber of the apparatus and allowed to freely explore all zones for 5 minutes. 
There were no group differences in pretest preference for either chamber. Conditioning 
groups were then balanced in an unbiased way to account for individual animals’ preference. 
On the test day, mice were placed back into the apparatus in the presence of both a novel 
object (an upside-down steel-bar pencil holder) on one side and a social target (identical 
pencil holder containing either a novel CD-1 or a C57BL/6J mouse) on the other. Test mice 
were allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 5 minutes. The time spent in each chamber 
was recorded and used for analysis. The subtracted social score is derived by subtracting 
time in social-paired chamber from time in novel object-paired chamber during the test 
phase. Normalized social score is the ratio of time spent in the chamber of interest (social 
target or novel object) during the test phase over the pretest phase.

 Parameter Assay Kit) and corticosterone (Immunodiagnostic Systems, IDS Corticosterone 
EIA Kit) levels were assessed via ELISA according to manufacture specifications. Briefly, 
blood was collected in a serum separator tube, allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room 
temperature, and centrifuged at 1000xg for 15 min and stored frozen (−20° C) until analysis. 
The sensitivity of the testosterone assay (minimum detectable dose ranging from 0.012–
0.041 ng/ml) falls well below the ranges detected experimentally within our cohort (lowest 
serum testosterone concentration of 2.58 ng/ml).
Perfusion and brain tissue processing
For IHC and histology, mice were given a euthanizing dose of 15% chloral hydrate and 
transcardially perfused with cold 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 
pH 7.4) followed by fixation with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were dissected 
and post-fixed for 18 h in the same fixative. Coronal sections were prepared on a vibratome 
(Leica) at 50 μm to assess viral placement and immunohistochemistry. For in situ 
hybridization, mice brains were rapidly removed and flash frozen in −30°C isopentane for 
60 seconds and then kept at −80°C until sectioning.
Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy
For c-fos experiments, sections were incubated overnight in blocking solution (3% normal 
donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), washed in PBS for 2 hours, then incubated for 
48 hrs in primary antibody [Rabbit anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-42) 1:2,000]. 
Slices were then washed in PBS for 2 hrs, incubated in secondary for 2 hrs [Donkey anti-
rabbit Cy2 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch)], then washed in PBS for 30 min before 
staining with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 20 minutes. Sections were then mounted, air-dried 
overnight and cover-slipped with hardset Vectashield (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All slices 
were images using a Zeiss LSM 780. For c-Fos analysis, all images were taken at 20x 
magnification for both the BF and lHb, using the tile-scan function to span the entire region 
of interest. Analysis of c-Fos positive nuclei was performed using NIH ImageJ in 
conjunction with the “analyze particle” function on single images. For representative images 
demonstrating the areas of viral infection, images were acquired at 10x magnification using 
the tile-scan function.
For all other IHC, coronal sections (50 μm) were used for all immunofluorescence 
experiments. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% 
Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hour. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody 
overnight at 4°C [VGAT 1:500 (Synaptic Systems); VGLUT1 (Millipore) 1:5,000; 1:250; 
GFP (Aves) 1:1,000]. Next sections were washed in PBS for 60 min and then incubated in 
secondary antibody for 2 hours [Donkey anti-guinea pig Cy5 1:400; Donkey anti-goat Cy5 
1:400; Donkey anti-chicken Cy2 1:400 (Jackson ImmunoResearch)], then washed with PBS 
for 60 min, stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 20 minutes, mounted and air-dried 
overnight. Slides were quickly washed in ethanol 70%, 95%, 100% and Citrosolv (Fisher), 
and cover-slipped with DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences). All slices 
were images using a Zeiss LSM 780. For puncta imaging, 1-um z-stacks were taken at 100x 
magnification for both the BF and lHb. Deconvolution was performed on all z-stacks with

 AutoQuant X (MediaCybernetics). For representative image demonstrating the area of viral 
infection, images were acquired at 100x magnification using the tile-scan function.
For in situ hybridization, RNAScope Multiplex Flourescent Kits (Advanced Cell 
Diagnostics) were used with the company provided procedure. Briefly, fresh frozen brains 
were slide mounted at 16 μm thickness, fixed for 15 minutes in cold 4% PFA, serially 
dehydrated with increasing ETOH concentration washes (50%, 75% 100% EtOH for 2 
minutes each), and pre-treated with protease reagent (Protease IV, RNAscope) for 20 
minutes. Proprietary probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) for eGFP (Channel 1) or GAD67 
(Channel 2) were hybridized at 40°C for 2 hours, and then subjected to a series of 
amplification steps at 40°C (1-FL: 30 minutes; 2-FL: 15 minutes; 3-FL: 30 minutes, 4-FL: 
15 minutes). For the 4th amplification step, Reagent Alt-A was used, corresponding with 
Channel 1 visualization at 488nm and Channel 2 at 550nm. Lastly slides were treated for 2 
minutes with DAPI, an immediately cover-slipped with EcoMount.
In vitro electrophysiology
All recordings were performed blind to experimental condition, and performed in both NON 
and AGG CD-1 mice. For optogenetic slice electrophysiology, mice were anesthetized with 
isoflurane, and perfused with cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) composed of (in 
mM): 128 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 D-glucose, 24 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, and 2 MgCl2 
(oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.35, 295–305 mOsm) as described in our 
previous work37,38. Briefly, acute brain slices containing the lHb were cut using a 
microslicer (DTK-1000, Ted Pella) in 95% O2 and 5% CO2 saturated sucrose-aCSF, which 
was derived by fully replacing NaCl with 254 mM sucrose. Slices were maintained in the 
holding chamber containing aCSF for 1 h at 37°C. Slices were then transferred into a 
recording chamber fitted with a constant flow rate of aCSF equilibrated with 95%/5% 
O2/CO2 (2.5 ml/min) maintained at 35 °C. Cell-attached recording mode was used to 
measure the firing rates of lHb neurons. In these recording experiments, glass recording 
pipettes (7–10 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution composed of (in mM): 115 
potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 2 magnesium 
ATP, and 0.5 GTP (pH 7.2, 285 mOsm). For the experiments to measure inhibitory 
postsynaptic currents, whole-cell recordings were performed under voltage-clamp mode 
(holding at −70 mV) in presence of kynurenic acid (1 mM) with or without gabazine (2 μM) 
in aCSF. Glass recording pipettes (3–4 MΩ) for these whole-cell studies were filled with the 
internal solution composed of (mM): 120 CsCl, 10 phosphocreatine-Na, 10 HEPES, 10 
EGTA, 2 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Tris (pH 7.2, 285 mOsm). Data acquisition was conducted 
using a Digidata 1440A digitizer and pClamp 10.2 (Axon Instruments).
Stereotaxic surgery and viral gene transfer
All surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions using anesthetic. Briefly, mice were 
anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg per kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg 
per kg body weight) and positioned in a small-animal stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf 
Instruments) and the skull surface was exposed. Thirty-three–gauge syringe needles 
(Hamilton Co.) were used to bilaterally infuse either 0.5 μl (BF) or 0.4 μl (lHb) of virus over 
a 5 minute period and the needle removed after 5 minutes. NAc shell/septum transition zone

 BF stereotaxic coordinates taken from bregma (anteroposterior +1.5 mm; mediolateral, +1.6 
mm; dorsoventral, −4.4 mm; angle 10°). lHb stereotaxic coordinates taken from bregma 
(anteroposterior, −1.7 mm; mediolateral, +0.4 mm; dorsoventral, −2.5 mm; angle 0°). For 
lHb optogenetic experiments, animals were implanted with an optical fiber at the same time 
as viral injection (dorsoventral, −2.0 mm). For secure fixture of the implantable fiber to the 
skull, the skull was dried and then industrial-strength dental cement (Grip cement; Dentsply) 
was added between the base of the implantable fiber and the skull. For non-conditional 
axonal tract tracing, 0.5 μl AAV2-hSyn-eYFP (1.5 × 10^11–13 infectious units/ml, UNC 
Vector Core) was injected bilaterally into the BF. For retrograde tracing, 0.4ul μl G-deleted-
Rabies-eGFP (1.33x 10^8 infectious units/ml, Salk Gene Transfer Targeting and 
Therapeutics Core) was injected into the lHb. For behavioral optogenetic experiments, 0.5 μl 
of non-conditional AAV2-hSyn-eYFP, AAV2-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP or AAV-hSyn-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP (1.5 × 10^11–13 infectious units/ml, UNC Vector Core) were injected into 
the BF (terminal stimulation) or lHb (cell body stimulation). All non-rabies AAV injections 
were performed between 4–6 weeks prior to tracing or behavioral experiments; rabies 
infected brains were collected 7 days after injection.
Blue light stimulation
Optical fibers (Thor Labs, BFL37-200) were connected using an FC/PC adaptor to a 473-nm 
blue laser diode (Crystal Laser, BCL-473-050-M) and a stimulator (Agilent Technologies, 
no. 33220A) was used to generate blue light pulses. For all in vivo behavioral experiments 
and optrode recordings, mice were given 40 Hz 5 ms light stimulations. Intensity of light 
delivered to ferrule was ~10 mW. These parameters are consistent with previously validated 
and published protocols for NAc MSNs39,40 and lHb neurons15,41.
Yellow light stimulation
Optical fibers (Thor Labs, SFS200/220Y) were connected using an FC/PC adaptor to a 561-
nm yellow laser diode (Crystal Laser, CL561-050-L), and a stimulator (Agilent 
Technologies, no. 33220A) was used to generate yellow light pulses. For in vivo optrode 
recordings we tested a protocol of 8 s of yellow light on followed by 2 s of light off. 
Intensity of light delivered to ferrule was ~10 mW. These parameters are consistent with 
previously validated and published protocols for NAc MSNs and lHb neurons42,43.
In vivo recordings
Optrode construction and implantation—An optrode was constructed by gluing four 
tetrodes to an optical fiber. Four tetrodes spun of 12.7 μm diameter nichrome wire 
(California Fine Wire) were glued to a 200 μm diameter optical fiber (Thor Labs, 
SFS200/220Y) and cut so that they extended between 750 and 250 μm beyond the end of the 
fiber. The tetrodes were pinned into an electrode interface board (EIB; Neuralynx) and the 
tips were plated by passing 0.2 μA current pulses through the individual wires and a gold 
solution until the impedance reached 150–200 kOhm. The optrode was mounted on a 
stereotax arm (Kopf Instruments) and then lowered into the brain during surgery. Two small 
holes were drilled anterior and posterior to the recording site to serve as sites for ground 
screws. The ground screws were constructed by soldering stainless steel self-tapping screws

 to 3 mm stainless steel wire secured to the EIB. Screws were inserted far enough to come in 
contact with dura.
Recording—Recordings were carried out using a Digital Lynx 16SX recording system and 
Cheetah data acquisition software (Neuralynx). Signals from the tetrodes were bandpass 
filtered between 600 and 9000 Hz and digitized at 32 kHz. Spike detection was performed in 
real time using a thresholding procedure: when the filtered signal reached threshold 
amplitude on any wire, a sweep including 8 data points before the crossing and 24 points 
after (32 points, or 1 ms) were saved as a putative spike event. Spike sorting and noise 
filtering was performed offline. The laser intensity was adjusted to ~5 mW at the tip of the 
optrode prior to implantation. The optrode was lowered using the stereotax arm until the 
tetrode tips reached the dorsal extent of the lHb. Once the tissue and recordings stabilized, 
the optrode was slowly advanced until spikes were observed on at least one of the tetrodes. 
Spike amplitude and firing rate were allowed to stabilize and observed for several minutes 
prior to recording. For all trials a 30 second baseline recording was acquired, followed by 1 
minute of stimulation and ending with a 30 second post-stimulation baseline. The optrode 
was then stepped forward and this procedure repeated until the inferior extent of the lHb was 
reached.
Analysis—Data were analyzed using custom scripts written in Matlab (MathWorks). A 
first round of preliminary spike sorting was carried out using spike waveforms as parameters 
in KlustaKwik44. The output from KlustaKwik was then imported into Matlab and clusters 
were manually edited using custom spike sorting software. Clearly separated clusters of 
spikes were assigned to functional units and entered into further analysis; noise spikes (e.g. 
from spurious threshold crossings) and units that fired fewer than 100 spikes during 
recording were discarded. Spike rates were calculated in 2-second non-overlapping bins 
across the baseline and stimulation epochs. The resulting functions were smoothed using a 
Gaussian window with a standard deviation of 10 seconds. The rate function for each unit 
was then z-scored across all three epochs. For statistical analyses, rates were calculated in 
either 15 second bins or bins encompassing the entire baseline and stimulation periods. No 
smoothing was applied. The rate functions for each unit were z-scored across all three 
epochs and the z-scored rate functions were used to assess statistical significance.
Statistical analysis
All t-tests, one-way ANOVAs, two-way ANOVAs and chi-square tests were performed using 
Graph Pad Prism software (Graphpad software Inc, CA). Bonferroni was used as a post-hoc 
when appropriate for one-way and two-way ANOVAs. Normality was determined by 
D’Agostino-Pearson, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality tests. Statistical 
significance was set a p < 0.05.

NON, non-aggressor; AGG, aggressor. The subtracted social score was derived by subtracting time in social-paired 
chamber from the novel object-paired chamber during the test phase. Normalized social score is the ratio of time spent in 
the chamber of interest (social target or novel object) during the test phase over the pretest phase.

Schematic of (a) optogenetic viral infection strategy and (b) aggression CPP procedure. 
Representative CPP heatmaps for eYFPBF→lHb, ChR2BF→lHb and NpHR3BF→lHb between 
(c) NON and (f) AGG mice. (d) Normalized (F2,26 = 5.019, one-way ANOVA P < 0.05; post 
hoc test, *P < 0.05, n = 9–10/group) and subtracted CPP score (F2,26 = 6.666, one-way 
ANOVA P < 0.01; post hoc test, *P < 0.05, n = 9–10/group) in NON::eYFPBF→lHb,
