Sport-specific differences in the left ventricle (LV) of land-based athletes have been
observed; however, comparisons to water-based athletes are sparse. The purpose of
this study was to examine differences in LV structure and function in elite swimmers and
runners. Sixteen elite swimmers [23 (2) years, 81% male, 69% white] and 16 age, sex,
and race matched elite runners participated in the study. All athletes underwent resting
echocardiography and indices of LV dimension, global LV systolic and diastolic function,
and LV mechanics were determined. All results are presented as swimmers vs. runners.
Early diastolic function was lower in swimmers including peak early transmitral filling
velocity [76 (13) vs. 87 (11) cm · s−1, p = 0.02], mean mitral annular peak early velocity
[16 (2) vs. 18 (2) cm · s−1, p = 0.01], and the ratio of peak early to late transmitral
filling velocity [2.68 (0.59) vs. 3.29 (0.72), p = 0.005]. The diastolic mechanics index
of time to peak untwisting rate also occurred later in diastole in swimmers [12 (10)%
diastole vs. 5 (4)% diastole, p = 0.01]. Cardiac output was larger in swimmers [5.8 (1.5)
vs. 4.7 (1.2) L · min−1, p = 0.04], which was attributed to their higher heart rates [56
(6) vs. 49 (6) bpm, p < 0.001] given stroke volumes were similar between groups. All
other indices of LV systolic function and dimensions were similar between groups. Our
findings suggest enhanced early diastolic function in elite runners relative to swimmers,
which may be attributed to faster LV untwisting.

INTRODUCTION
Exercise-induced cardiac remodeling is well documented with the degree of adaptation dependent
on the type of training (i.e., aerobic vs. resistance-based training) (Pluim et al., 2000; Spence et al.,
2011; Utomi et al., 2013). There is also growing recognition that within aerobic or resistance-based
training, different sport modalities may elicit different left ventricular (LV) adaptations (Spirito
et al., 1994; Venckunas et al., 2008a; Wasfy et al., 2015). Within aerobic-based sports, the type
of LV adaptation may depend on the degree of isotonic (i.e., dynamic) and isometric (i.e., static)
components involved in the sport. Comparisons of land-based sport modalities have observed
differences in LV structure and diastolic function between distance running (i.e., high isotonic and

low isometric) and rowing (i.e., high isotonic and high isometric)
(Wasfy et al., 2015). Sport-specific differences in LV mechanics
have also been described, including peak untwisting velocity
which contributes to diastolic filling (Beaumont et al., 2017).
Swimming is a sport that provides a unique physiological
stimulus distinct from land-based exercise modalities. It would
be classified as having a high isotonic component (i.e., similar to
running or rowing), but moderate isometric component which
falls somewhere on the spectrum between the other two sports
(Mitchell et al., 2005). Unique aspects of this exercise modality
which may influence exercise-induced LV remodeling include
immersion of the body in water (and the potential influence of
hydrostatic pressure and water temperature), a supine posture,
use of both the upper and lower limbs, and a novel requirement
of breath holding (Holmer et al., 1974; Holmer, 1979; Ferrigno
et al., 1986). Posture specific cardiovascular adaptations have
been observed following supine and upright cycle training (Ray
et al., 1990); and LV differences between rowers and runners also
suggest combined upper and lower limb exercise may provide a
different stimulus than lower-limb exercise alone (Wasfy et al.,
2015). There is limited evidence available demonstrating similar
global LV systolic and diastolic function in swimmers and other
land-based athletes (i.e., runners) (Colan et al., 1987; Venckunas
et al., 2008a), and no studies have examined LV mechanics,
which provides more detailed information on LV systolic and
diastolic function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to extend our understanding of the extent of exercise-induced
cardiac remodeling with swimming through a characterization
and comparison of LV mechanics, dimensions, and global systolic
and diastolic function between elite swimmers and runners.
Any differences in global LV function would likely also be
demonstrated through differences in LV mechanics. Based on
previous evidence, however, we hypothesized global LV function
would be similar between groups, and therefore LV mechanics
would also be similar.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Athletes
Inclusion criteria included males and females, 18 years of age or
older, who were elite swimmers or runners, which was defined as
an athlete currently competing at the Olympic or International
level, or specifically identified by their national sporting group to
represent their country. Swimmers were recruited from on-site
advertisements and word of mouth from the 2016 FINA World
Championships (25 m) in Windsor, Canada, and tested upon
completion of all competitions. Runners were similarly recruited
during competition season from an elite local club and tested
at the University of Guelph in Canada. Sixteen athletes were
included in each group, and they were matched based on age,
sex, and race. Exclusion criteria included physician diagnosed
cardiovascular disease, evidence of cardiovascular abnormality
from a preceding 12-lead electrocardiogram (or follow-up
diagnostic echocardiogram), or any language or cognitive barrier
that prevented them from following English instructions. This
study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations
of the University of Guelph Natural, Physical and Engineering
Sciences Research Ethics Board with written informed consent
from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol
was approved by the University of Guelph Natural, Physical
and Engineering Sciences Research Ethics Board (16OC027). All
athletes provided written informed consent prior to participation
and were asked to be at least 2 h fasted and 12 h post-
exercise. Individuals completed a questionnaire that addressed
their medical history and training history including their
duration of competitive training, their average training volume,
and their sporting event. With shoes removed, height was
measured at end-inspiration to the nearest half centimeter using
a stadiometer (SECA; Hanover, MD, United States), while weight
was measured using an electronic scale (Tanita TBF-300 WA;
Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL, United States). Body mass index
and body surface area using the Du Bois and Du Bois (1989)
formula were calculated. Athletes were then asked to rest in
a supine position for 5 min, after which brachial artery blood
pressure measurements were obtained in duplicate from the right
arm using an automated oscillometric device (BpTRU model
BPM-100, BpTRU Medical Devices; Coquitlam, BC, Canada).
Echocardiography Assessment
All LV images were collected in the left lateral decubitus
position with two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler
acquisition by a single investigator and using a dedicated
ultrasound (Vivid Q; GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway). The
system employed a M4S Matrix Sector Array Probe (2–
5 MHz),
and all images were analyzed offline by a single investigator using
dedicated software (EchoPAC; GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway)
according to the recommendations of the American Society for
Echocardiography (Quinones et al., 2002; Lang et al., 2005; Mor-
Avi et al., 2011). All LV indices were determined from the average
of three cardiac cycles. LV dimensions at end-diastole and end-
systole were measured from parasternal long axis views. Relative
wall thickness was calculated as [(2 × end-diastolic posterior wall
thickness)/end-diastolic LV internal diameter], while LV mass
was calculated according to the area-length formula (Lang et al.,
2005) and indexed to body surface area. End-diastolic and systolic
volumes and ejection fractions were derived from Simpson’
s
biplane analysis of apical four and two-chamber views. Stroke
volume was calculated from LV outflow tract diameters and
velocity time integrals and multiplied by heart rate to determine
cardiac output. To control for the potential differences in body
size between athlete groups, end-diastolic volume, stroke volume
and cardiac output were indexed to body surface area. Pulsed-
wave Doppler at the tips of the mitral valve leaflet was used to
determine peak early (E) and late (A) transmitral filling velocities,
and the resultant E/A ratio. Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging
was performed at the septal and lateral mitral annulus and
averaged to determine isovolumetric relaxation time and peak
early (E’
), late (A’
), and systolic (S’
) mitral annular velocities.

valve (basal) and apex (apical) were analyzed using speckle-

post-processing software (2D Strain Analysis Tool, Stuttgart,
Germany), which normalizes the temporal sequence of heart
rate by interpolating the data into 600 points in systole and
600 points in diastole using a standard cubic spline algorithm.
Basal and apical peak rotation and rotation rate in systole
and diastole were determined. Twist was determined as the
maximum value obtained when subtracting the frame-by-frame
basal rotation from the frame-by-frame apical rotation, while
torsion was calculated by dividing twist by LV length. Peak
systolic twisting rate, early diastolic untwisting rate and time
to peak twisting/untwisting rates were derived in the same
manner from frame-by-frame basal and apical rotation rate
data.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package
for Social Science software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY,
United States) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, United States). Data were assessed for normality
using Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q–
Q plot analyses. Between group
differences were assessed using independent t-tests and Mann-
Whitney U-tests for normally and non-normally distributed data.
Given a significant difference in supine heart rates between
groups, early diastolic indices (E and E’
), which are influenced
by heart rate, were also compared using an analysis of covariance
with heart rate as the covariate. Data are presented as mean ± SD
unless otherwise noted, with P < 0.05 considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Athlete characteristics are presented in Table 1. For runners,
sprint/power athletes were defined as those who competed in
100–
400 m races and high jump, while distance athletes competed
in races ≥800 m. Short distance swimmers comprised those
competing in 50–
200 m races while middle-distance/distance
athletes competed in 400–
1500 m races. Eleven swimmers swam
freestyle, 3 swam breaststroke and 2 swam backstroke. Groups
were predominantly male (81%) and white (69%) and had
similar body dimensions. Swimmers participated in competitive
training for a longer duration and engaged in a larger volume
of weekly training, but within the swimmer and runner groups,
there was no difference in these variables between distance and
sprint athletes. Supine blood pressures were similar between
groups, but heart rate was higher in swimmers. LV indices are
presented in Table 2. Cardiac output and cardiac output index
were larger in swimmers, while all other global LV systolic
function indices and systolic mechanics were similar between
groups. For global LV diastolic function, early diastolic indices
were higher in runners including E and E’
, as well as the E/A
ratio. When heart rate was entered as a covariate, E’
remained
different between groups (p = 0.01) while E was trending
(p = 0.06). For diastolic mechanics, runners had a shorter
time to peak untwisting rate and a lower apical rotation rate
in diastole compared to swimmers. LV structure was similar
between groups.

DISCUSSION
In a cohort of elite-level athletes, we demonstrate increased early
diastolic filling in runners compared to swimmers, while all
other indices of LV dimensions and systolic function/mechanics
were similar between groups. This improved early diastolic filling
in elite runners may be attributed to enhanced LV diastolic
mechanics, increased preload due to greater blood volume (which
we did not specifically examine), or a combination of both. The
observations from this study suggest the exercise stimulus of
running vs. swimming may be capable of producing distinct
adaptations in LV diastolic, but not systolic, function.
While presently debated, there is evidence to suggest an
association between aerobic exercise training and enhanced
early
diastolic
filling,
characterized
using
both
preload-
dependent transmitral filling velocity, and mitral annular
velocity measurements which rely less on preload (George and
Somauroo, 2012). Cross-sectional comparisons have observed
enhanced early diastolic filling indices in swimmers relative
to sedentary individuals (Caso et al., 2002; Venckunas et al.,
2008a; Santoro et al., 2015), while only one study has examined
differences between elite long and middle-distance runners
and swimmers and observed no difference in transmitral
filling velocities between groups (Venckunas et al., 2008a). We
observed higher early transmitral filling and mitral annular
velocities and a higher E/A ratio in our runner cohort, which
remained significant or trending when controlling for heart
rate, suggesting runners have enhanced early diastolic function
relative to swimmers. While the untwisting rate was similar
between groups, the time to peak untwisting rate occurred
earlier in the diastole in runners. LV untwisting is an important
component of early diastole as it precedes diastolic suction and
subsequent filling (Burns et al., 2009). Thus, the capacity to

reach peak untwisting faster could prolong the early filling phase
leading to increased values of early diastolic filling. No swim
training studies have examined LV mechanics, but land-based
aerobic exercise training in young adults has been shown
to enhance untwisting mechanics (Weiner et al., 2015). The
shorter time to peak untwist may also explain the observation
of attenuated diastolic apical rotation rates in runners relative
to swimmers. In particular, the apex may not need to untwist as
much given it reaches peak untwisting sooner. The differences in
diastolic apical rotation rate may also be partially explained by
the differences in heart rate.
The enhanced early diastolic function observed in runners
suggests this land-based exercise modality may provide a greater
physiological stimulus for exercise-induced cardiac adaptation.
The elevated E and E/A ratio in runners, which are both preload
dependent measures, could also be attributed to a greater blood
volume. Upright aerobic exercise training has been shown to elicit
significant increases in blood volume in young males compared to
supine aerobic exercise training (Ray et al., 1990). Additionally,
female runners have been shown to have a greater blood volume
than female swimmers (Parker Jones et al., 1999). Thus, the
observed sport-specific improvements in diastolic function may
be related to adaptations in the LV, blood volume, or both. Self-
reported training history and weekly training volume were both
lower in runners; thus, despite training for fewer years and fewer
hours per week they still demonstrated increased resting diastolic
function.
It is also possible that the diastolic function observed in
runners was a necessary adaptation for their exercise modality,
rather than a greater adaptation. Investigations on land have
demonstrated that the supine posture promotes venous return,
increasing preload, early diastolic filling and subsequently stroke
volume (Sato et al., 1999; Warburton et al., 2002). Additionally,
earlier work in young men demonstrated increased heart volume
using x-ray following head-up immersion in water in comparison
to upright and supine land postures (Lange et al., 1974). Thus,
the combined supine and immersed position of swimming
should function to promote diastolic filling. Previous studies have
observed swimming and running at a similar oxygen uptake level
have elicited similar cardiac outputs but lower heart rates during
swimming, suggesting an increased stroke volume (Holmer,
1979). Thus, it is possible that swimmers do not need to further
augment diastolic function to the level of a runner, because the
position and water immersion aspects of their exercise modality
would promote filling. While we did not compare our athletes
to a sedentary control group, we would consider both groups to
exhibit exercise-induced LV remodeling as they represent athletes
at the elite level of their respective sports, and their values are
generally higher than age-matched reference values (Lang et al.,
2005; Nagueh et al., 2009). For example, the average E/A ratio is
1.88 and 1.53 for 16–
20 and 21–
40 year olds, respectively (Nagueh
et al., 2009). This highlights that the attenuated diastolic values
in swimmers relative to runners should not be interpreted as
reduced diastolic function, but on a continuum of adaptations to
exercise training.
The only difference in systolic function between groups
was cardiac output, which can be attributed to higher heart

rates in swimmers given stroke volumes were similar. Resting
bradycardia with aerobic exercise training is well characterized,
and while some have observed no difference in resting heart rate
between aerobic sport modalities (Colan et al., 1987; Wasfy et al.,
2015), higher resting heart rates have been observed in swimmers
compared to runners (Nualnim et al., 2011). For LV dimensions,
cross-sectional comparisons of swimmers to sedentary controls
suggest swimmers experience exercise-induced LV remodeling
including increases in wall thickness, internal diastolic diameters
and LV mass index (Colan et al., 1987; Caso et al., 2002;
Venckunas et al., 2008a; Santoro et al., 2015). Comparisons
between swimmers and runners have generally demonstrated
no difference in LV internal diastolic diameter or LV mass
index (Colan et al., 1987; Venckunas et al., 2008a), which is in
agreement with our observations. Colan et al. (1987) argued that
swimmers experience an intermediate level of LV remodeling that
would fall on the spectrum between running and powerlifting
athletes, and that their degree of adaptation is attributed to both
the volume overload typically associated with endurance (i.e.,
isotonic) training and the pressure overload typically associated
with resistance (i.e., isometric) training. This was based on their
observation that end-systolic wall thickness in swimmers was
larger than runners but smaller than power lifters. The long-
standing view that isometric-based training elicits concentric
remodeling, however, has recently been discredited (Spence et al.,
2011). We observed no difference in relative wall thickness,
which suggests both sports, regardless of their isotonic and
isometric components, provide a similar physiological stimulus
for remodeling.
The strengths of our study include the assessment of elite
athletes during their competition season and our comprehensive
assessment of LV function including both traditional measures of
global function and more advanced speckle-tracking assessments
of systolic and diastolic mechanics. However, we do acknowledge
several limitations. Each group contained a heterogeneous
mixture of sex, race, and sport distance, all of which can
influence LV adaptations with exercise training (Sharma, 2003).
We matched athletes in each group based on sex and race;
therefore, the potential confounding effects of these factors
should be minimized. Differences in LV structure have been
documented between sprint and distance runners; however, there
were no differences in diastolic parameters (Venckunas et al.,
2008b). Within swimming, one study documented differences in
LV structure and the E/A ratio between endurance (i.e., 400–
800 m) and “
strength”(i.e., 50–
100 m) swimmers (D’
Andrea
et al., 2003). Strength swimmers also performed 2 h per day
of land-based strength training in comparison to 1 h per week
in the endurance group; therefore it is difficult to ascertain
whether these differences were exclusively attributed to the
swim training. Within our swimmer cohort, we are limited in
our ability to compare LV parameters between sport distances
given race distributions (i.e., 71% of sprint swimmers were
black vs. 10% of middle distance/distance swimmers). However,
comparison of diastolic indices between sprint and middle
distance/distance swimmers, both with and without race as a
covariate, revealed no significant differences between distance
groups. We are also unable to discriminate the amount of training
spent performing isotonic and isometric activities. Given the elite
status of all athletes, it is safe to assume they were engaging
in the best training practices for their respective event and
therefore represent high-performance running and swimming
athletes. For a more comprehensive understanding of cardiac
differences between runners and swimmers, future investigations
should consider examining the right ventricle and atria, as well
as longitudinally tracking changes with training in order to draw
more definitive conclusions regarding sport-specific adaptations.
Furthermore, the practical implications of enhanced resting
diastolic function in runners compared to swimmers is unknown.
Thus, future studies should consider comparing LV performance
during both supine and upright exercise in these athlete groups.
CONCLUSION
Our cross-sectional comparison of elite swimmers and runners
suggest running is associated with faster LV untwisting during
diastole and enhanced early diastolic filling. Further research is
required to delineate whether these observations are a product of
a superior exercise stimulus, or a necessary adaptation to promote
filling during upright exercise. The different exercise stimuli of
swimming and running did not appear to affect LV structure or
systolic function, as these indices were similar between groups.
Overall, our findings lend further support to the concept of sport-
specific differences in LV function.
