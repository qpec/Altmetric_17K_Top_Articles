Health care–associated infections (HAIs) and drug-resistant pathogens have become a major health care issue with
millions of reported cases every year. Advanced diagnostics would allow clinicians to more quickly determine the most
effective treatment, reduce the nonspecific use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and facilitate enrollment in new
antibiotic treatments. We present a new integrated system, polarization anisotropy diagnostics (PAD), for rapid de-
tection of HAI pathogens. The PAD uses changes of fluorescence anisotropy when detection probes recognize target
bacterial nucleic acids. The technology is inherently robust against environmental noise and economically scalable for
parallel measurements. The assay is fast (2 hours) and performed on-site in a single-tube format. When applied to
clinical samples obtained from interventional procedures, the PAD determined the overall bacterial burden, differ-
entiated HAI bacterial species, and identified drug resistance and virulence status. The PAD system holds promise as
a powerful tool for near-patient, rapid HAI testing.
INTRODUCTION
Health care–associated infections (HAIs) and the emergence of drug-
resistant pathogens are major health care issues. On any given day, 1 of
25 hospitalized patients becomes infected and as many as 1 of 9 succumb
to death (1). HAIs incur a significant socioeconomic burden arising
from prolonged hospital stays, lasting disability, and demand for
new antimicrobials. In the United States, it is estimated that more than
600,000 patients develop HAIs every year (1), and HAI-related costs
amount to $100 billion to $150 billion per year (2). Rapid, sensitive de-
tection of pathogenic bacteria is a key to initiating timely treatment with
proper antibiotics, preventing disease spread, and identifying infection
sources in hospitals, homes, and other field settings (3–5).
Although bacterial culture is the clinical gold standard, it has draw-
backs including long process times (up to several days), personnel cost,
and the need for specialized equipment and species-specific protocols. As
an alternative, nucleic acid (NA) testing has been increasingly adopted
in clinical laboratories. On the basis of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification of bacterial nucleotides, NA tests allow for com-
prehensive pathogen identification. The target sequence library is also
rapidly expanding to empower these tests, aided by advances in bacterial
whole-genome sequencing (6). Technical challenges, however, still re-
main in translating NA tests into routine clinical workflows. First, system
operation can be complex, requiring trained operators. Although fully
automated systems are available, they tend to be bulky and expensive. Sec-
ond, assay costs are often higher than those for conventional screening.
For example, in sequence-specific detection (for example, TaqMan, Mo-
lecular Beacon, and LightCycler), specialized probes for each NA target
should be designed. Finally, NA tests are susceptible to false positives
due to accidental contamination by amplified products. To minimize
the potential for cross-contamination, it is necessary to have the pre- and
post-PCR areas in different spaces or PCR workstations. These con-
straints limit the penetration of NA tests to centralized hospital labora-
tories. For prompt, effective HAI control, assay platforms that can bring
NA testing to the patient level (for example, community clinics and
doctor’s offices) are needed.
Here, we report a new detection system designed for rapid, cost-
effective HAI diagnostics. Termed polarization anisotropy diagnostics
(PAD), the system measures changes in fluorescence anisotropy when
detection probes recognize target bacterial NAs (7). The detection is ratio-
metric, independent of fluorescence intensity, which makes the assay
robust against environmental factors. We advanced the PAD to enable
multilevel, on-site HAI diagnostics. Specifically, we have (i) developed a
compact device with a disposable cartridge for sample preparation and
multiwell detection, (ii) optimized the assay to perform NA amplification
and detection without washing steps, (iii) embedded contamination con-
trol in the assay protocol, and (iv) created a library of sequence-specific
probes to assess bacterial burden, pathogen types, antibiotic resistance,
and virulence. As proof of concept, we applied PAD to detect clinically
relevant HAI pathogens (8, 9): Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The PAD demonstrated detec-
tion sensitivity down to the single bacterium level and determined drug
resistance and virulence status. With clinical samples, the PAD achieved
an accuracy comparable to that of bacterial culture; however, the PAD
had a much shorter turnaround time (~2 hours) and allowed for on-
site operation.

 amplified via asymmetric reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Next,
an all-in-one PAD mix is added. The mix consists of two reagents: (i) a
detection key that is derived from an aptamer (specific to DNA poly-
merase) adjoined with a complementary sequence to target NAs (7) and
(ii) a reporter DNA with a fluorophore. The detection key, stabilized
through hybridization with the target NA, locks into DNA polymerase
and deactivates its enzymatic activity. The reporter DNA then retains its
structure and assumes high fluorescence anisotropy (r) due to slow dif-
fusional motion. Conversely, the anisotropy is low in the absence of the
NA targets, because unlocked DNA polymerase cleaves the reporter’s
fluorophore during the extension reaction. The assay is fast (2 hours for
completion) and is performed without any washing steps.
PAD system
To enable on-site HAI detection, we implemented a compact PAD system
(Fig. 1, B and C). The system had two major parts: a disposable sample-
processing cartridge and a compact reader for fluorescence anisotropy
detection. The cartridge was used to extract bacterial NAs (see fig. S1 for
the device structure). It had a fluidic chamber packed with glass beads
(diameter, 30 mm) to create an on-chip filter (fig. S1A) (10): negatively
charged NAs could be adsorbed to the positively charged bead surface
under high-salt condition and then be eluted by changing the salt con-
centration. We implemented the device in poly(methylmethacrylate) via
injection molding (see Materials and Methods for details). When com-
pared to a commercial column filter, the fluidic cartridge showed com-
parable performance, extracting RNA with good quality (fig. S2). The
RNA integrity numbers (RINs), ranging from 1 (poor) to 10 (best), were
9.6 ± 0.3 (fluidic cartridge) and 9.5 ± 0.2 (column filter). By using the
on-chip cartridge, however, we could remove centrifugal washing steps.
The detection system was designed for portable, parallel PAD assays.
It had a modular structure consisting of a base unit for signal processing
and four plug-in optical cubes (Fig. 1C and fig. S3). Each optical cube
could be customized to accommodate differently sized sample containers
and fluorescence optics. The packaged PAD system had a small form
factor (8 × 8 × 8 cm3) and weighed ~400 g. The system wirelessly com-
municated with a computer or a smartphone through Bluetooth connec-
tion, which further improved system portability and simplified the
assay setup. We designed a smartphone application for system
operation as well as for data logging with geographic information
(Fig. 1D and fig. S4).
PAD optics
Figure 2A shows the schematic of an optical cube in the PAD system.
We used a light-emitting diode (LED) as an affordable light source. The
illumination light passed through a linear polarizer and focused onto a
sample to excite fluorophore (Fig. 2A, inset). The intensity of emission
light was then measured by a pair of photodiodes. We measured both the
parallel (Ix) and perpendicular (Iy) components relative to the polarized
excitation light and calculated the fluorescence anisotropy (r) as r =
(Ix – Iy)·(Ix + 2Iy)−1. The optics was encased into an opaque plastic
body to minimize the interference from adjacent modules (fig. S3B).
For robust signal detection, we adopted the lock-in measurement
technique. Exploiting the fact that r is intensity-independent, we modu-
lated the intensity of the excitation light at the carrier frequency of
1 kHz. The emission signals were then frequency-locked through the
homodyne signal path (Fig. 2B). The scheme significantly improved
the signal-to-noise ratio (>28 dB; Fig. 2C) and allowed for reliable system
operation under ambient light. Data acquisition was directed by a
microcontroller unit (MCU; Arduino). A multichannel digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) was used to deliver a tunable, modulating signal to the
driver in each optical cube. The signal from a photodetector was am-
plified by a current amplifier, passed through an analog lock-in circuit,

 and digitized by a multichannel analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
The MCU was programmed to serially poll the optical cubes, control
all peripheral components, and communicate with external devices via
Bluetooth (fig. S5).
We benchmarked the PAD system against a commercial plate reader
(Sapphire 2, Tecan). To prepare samples of different fluorescence an-
isotropy, we varied the ratio between free fluorescein-labeled DNA (FAM-
DNA; high fluorescence anisotropy) and template-bound FAM-DNA
(low anisotropy; see Materials and Methods). The observed r values
showed agreement (R2 > 99%) between the plate reader and the PAD,
which served to confirm the accuracy of the PAD system (Fig. 2D).
Universal key to measure bacterial load
We first used the PAD to detect the overall bacterial burden. We de-
signed a single, universal key (UNI key) that targets a conserved region
of 16S rRNA in different bacterial species (Fig. 3A and Table 1). We
also prepared a common reporter probe that was composed of FAM-
DNA, its primer, and its template (Fig. 3A). The PAD output was de-
fined as ∆r = r – r0, where r0 is the fluorescence anisotropy of control
samples containing DNA polymerase and the reporter only.
We applied the designed assay (UNI-PAD) to detect representative
HAI pathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa,
and S. aureus). Across different bacterial species, we observed consistent
∆r values in concentration-matched samples [Fig. 3B; P = 0.8857, one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]; this result supported the use of the
UNI-PAD in estimating total bacterial load. We next performed titra-
tion experiments with serially diluted bacterial samples (Fig. 3C; see
Materials and Methods for details). The PAD assay achieved the dynam-
ic range spanning >104 colony-forming units (CFU); the limit of detec-
tion was down to single-digit CFU.
Assay optimization for point-of-care operation
We optimized the PAD system for its point-of-care (POC) applications.
One major issue in POC NA testing is to control false positives caused
by sample contamination with PCR products (that is, carryover
contamination) (11, 12). To minimize such effects, we adopted

 the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) method (13, 14). By substituting
deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) with deoxyuridine triphosphate
(dUTP) during PCR, we rendered all amplicons to have a uracil-
containing DNA backbone. Applying UDG cleaved these amplicons,
which selectively destroyed carryover contaminants from PCRs while
keeping bona fide DNA templates (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that the
method was compatible with the PAD assay. The signal level remained
the same when dUTP replaced dTTP in DNA targets (fig. S6). We next
tested the efficacy of this contamination control. As a carryover contam-
inant, dUTP-containing PCR products (107 amplicons) were spiked into
samples. Without UDG treatment, the negative control with no bacterial
targets showed false positives (Fig. 4B). This signal was eliminated with
the addition of UDG, and only samples containing true bacterial targets
yielded high ∆r (Fig. 4B).
To maximize system portability, we further combined the PAD
with a miniaturized thermocycler (miniPCR, Amplyus) (15). The per-
formance of the POC system matched that of conventional benchtop
equipment (fig. S7). We also lyophilized all chemical reagents (for ex-
ample, detection keys and reporters) to facilitate their transport and
storage (see Materials and Methods for details). The reagents retained
their activity after >2 weeks of storage in ambient conditions; we ob-
served statistically identical ∆r values (P > 0.64, two-tailed t test) with
fresh and stored agents (Fig. 4C and fig. S8).
Differential keys for pathogen classification
To differentiate HAI-causing pathogens, we designed a set of detection
keys (HAI keys) in which each key targets the hypervariable region of
16S rRNA in different bacterial species (Table 1; see table S1 for
extended targets). The sequence homology among genus types was kept
<50% to minimize nonspecific binding. When tested, the HAI keys
assumed high specificity. For example, the Escherichia key (Fig. 5A)
showed high signal (∆r) only with its intended target, whereas off-target
signals were negligible even in high biological background (106 CFU of
other bacterial species; Fig. 5B). Similarly, other HAI keys displayed ex-
cellent specificity with minimal crosstalk (Fig. 5C). Electrophoretic
band-shift analysis confirmed that the detection keys, in the presence
of complementary target amplicon, bound to DNA polymerase and
inhibited its catalytic activity (fig. S9).
We next prepared probes for antibiotic resistance and virulence (ARV
keys) for further bacterial phenotyping. These keys targeted bacterial
genes that make pathogens antibiotic-resistant or highly virulent. As a
model system, we profiled samples for mecA, PVL, nuc, and femB genes.
mecA is the determining factor conferring MRSA, a common multidrug-
resistant HAI pathogen (16). PVL, nuc, and femB are virulence factors
that contribute to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. We used two represent-
ative MRSA strains that have the following known genotypes: health
care–associated MRSA (mecA+, PVL–) and community-acquired MRSA

 (mecA+, PVL+). Control samples were MSSA (mecA–), E. coli (mecA–,
PVL–, nuc–, femB–), and P. aeruginosa (mecA–, PVL–, nuc–, femB–) (table
S2) (17–20). The ARV-PAD correctly genotyped bacteria, agreeing with
a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 5D and fig. S10).
Clinical application
Finally, we applied the PAD for clinical HAI diagnostics. The assay
started with bacterial lysis, followed by the NA collection using the
plastic cartridge. Following the NA amplification, the samples were ana-
lyzed in parallel for total bacterial burden (UNI key), HAI pathogens
(HAI keys), and antibiotic resistance and virulence status (ARV keys)
(fig. S11). The total assay time was ~2 hours, and the required sample
volume was ~40 ml.
We acquired patient samples and aliquoted them for the PAD test
(2 hours) and conventional culture (3 to 5 days) in a clinical micro-
biology laboratory. Test results for all detection keys (UNI, HAI, and
ARV) are shown in Fig. 6A and fig. S12. Samples negative with UNI-
PAD were also negative with HAI-PAD, suggesting the potential use of
universal detection for sample triaging. Among six UNI-PAD–positive
samples, the HAI-PAD detected HAI pathogens in five samples, and
the differentiation results matched the bacterial culture readouts (Fig. 6B).
One patient (no. 6) was positive with bacterial load but was negative
with HAI keys; the patient was later found to be infected with Providencia
rettgeri (nontargeted in the current HAI-PAD). For the sample pos-
itive for S. aureus (patient no. 2), the ARV-PAD showed mecA– status
(that is, MSSA); this result matched the MRSA-negative pathology re-
port and qPCR (Fig. 6 and fig. S13).
DISCUSSION
HAIs have become a ubiquitous, recalcitrant, and costly problem in
modern health care. They increase the emergence of antibiotic
resistance, cause significant morbidity and mortality, and prolong hos-
pital stays. One of the key mandates to control this endemic is to
equip local hospitals and community centers with more effective sur-
veillance systems. The PAD platform presented here could enable rapid
HAI detection in those settings. The detection system is compact and
user-friendly with minimal operation complexity. The assay is compre-
hensive, assessing for overall bacterial burden, pathogen types, anti-
biotic resistance, and virulence factors.
Several features make the PAD ideal for field operation. First, the
sensing scheme (fluorescence anisotropy) is inherently robust against en-
vironmental noise. We further incorporated the optical lock-in technique
to significantly enhance the sensitivity. Second, the assay flow involves
minimal complexity and hands-on time. A disposable plastic chip is used

care–associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), were identified by targeting the specific regions in mecA and PVL genes. Three
pathogens [methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), E. coli, and P. aeruginosa; 106 CFU/ml] were included as controls. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

 to collect NAs, and the remaining processes are performed in a single
tube without washing steps. The assay protocol is also refined to auto-
matically dissolve carryover contaminants, thereby minimizing false pos-
itives. Third, the platform is highly affordable. The PAD device has
simple electronics and can readily be expanded for parallel detection.
Making an injection-molded cartridge brings advantages including high
performance reproducibility, less cross-contamination between samples,
and lower cost. Finally, the PAD is scalable for comprehensive screening.
Decoupling detection and signaling probes enables such assays to be
cost-effective, because a common fluorescence reporter can be used
for all detection targets. We have already designed detection probes
for >35 targets (table S1); the incremental assay cost for additional
targets is ~$0.01.
In a pilot clinical test, PAD accuracy was comparable to that of
bacterial culture. In contrast to the culture, the PAD assay was fast
(~2 hours), multiplexed, and cost-effective (<$2 per assay). However,
we note the following limitations in the current study. First, no clinical
samples were found to contain drug-resistant strains. Further studies
with larger cohorts are needed to verify PAD’s capacity for drug
resistance screening. Second, the PAD may present ambiguous results
when target NAs overlap. For example, the current ARV keys would fail
to discern community-acquired MRSA (mecA+, PVL+) from the mix-
ture of health care–associated MRSA (mecA+, PVL–) and MSSA (mecA–,
PVL+). Such incomplete classification is an inherent issue with NA-based
tests. We expect that this issue would be overcome as more bacteria ge-
nomic data are accrued from whole-genome sequencing efforts.
The current prototype system could be further improved. First, we
envision a self-contained, closed system in which sample preparation,
thermocycling, and detection functions are all housed in a single device.
Such a system would effectively eliminate erroneous results from sam-
ple contamination, user interference, or both and proffer “sample-in and
answer-out” tests. Second, the current assay time could be shortened, par-
ticularly for DNA amplification. One promising direction is to adopt a
photonic thermocycling system, which can complete the entire PCR in
<5 min (21). Isothermal amplification is also an alternative; some iso-
thermal reactions can be completed in 20 min, which could bring down
the total assay time to <1 hour (22). Using isothermal amplification
would simplify the hardware requirement and make a battery-powered
device feasible. In the future, we plan to expand the test library for
broader pathogen and antibiotic resistance screening. The modular
nature of PAD probes should facilitate incorporating new targets such
as host-response factors (for example, interleukin-4, platelet-derived
growth factor B chain, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and C-
X-C motif chemokine 10) (23), as well as other viral, fungal, and
parasitic markers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fabrication of the plastic cartridge
The device was made in plastic via injection molding. A metal block of
the mold was first machined to have surface structures such as channels,
chambers, and ports negatively shaped to those on the top and bottom
parts of the plastic cartridge. To confine microbeads in the RNA capture
chamber, a weir-shaped physical barrier was designed at the outlet side
of the chamber. The top and bottom parts of the device were injection-
molded in a foundry (Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials).
More than two devices were produced per minute. The top and bottom
parts were glued together and the three-way valve was inserted.
Fluidic connection was made by inserting polyethylene tubes in the
fluidic ports.
Device preparation
The fluidic cartridge was filled with glass beads (diameter, ~30 mm;
Polysciences). Beads were suspended in 75% ethanol (Sigma) and in-
troduced through the inlet. The beads were retained in the RNA capture
chamber due to the weir-style physical barrier in the outlet side of the
chamber (fig. S1A). Following bead capture, excess ethanol was collected
and removed. The entire device was then flushed with cycles of RNaseZap
(Life Technologies), ribonuclease (RNase)–free water (Life Technologies),
and ethanol, and dried. All fluidic flow was generated by manually
operating syringes.

ence of the HAI species (HAI), and resistance/virulence status (ARV). (B) The clinical samples were also tested by a clinical pathology laboratory (culture and

 Detection system
The illumination source in the optical cube consisted of an LED (l =
470 nm; Thorlabs), a dichroic film polarizer (polarization efficiency,
>99%; Thorlabs), and a convex lens [focal length (ƒ) = 8 mm]. The de-
tection part had a convex lens (ƒ = 8 mm), a long-pass filter (EL0500,
Thorlabs), a dichroic film polarizer, and a photodiode (S1223, Hama-
matsu). A 16-bit DAC (LTC1597, Linear Technology) was used to
deliver the modulated control signal to a custom-designed LED driver
(LF356, Texas Instrument). The signal from the photodiode was ampli-
fied by a custom-designed current amplifier (AD549, Analog Devices).
For the lock-in detection, the amplified signal was passed through a
band-pass filter (center frequency, 1 kHz; bandwidth, 100 Hz), mixed
with a carrier signal, and passed through a low-pass filter (time constant,
1 ms). The conditioned signal was digitized by a 16-bit ADC (LTC1867,
Linear Technology). A microcontroller (Arduino MEGA 2560) was
programmed to control the light sources for multiplexing, to perform
real-time data recording, and to communicate with an external device
(for example, computers and smartphones) via a USB 2.0 or a Bluetooth
interface. The entire system was powered by a 9-V battery housed inside
the base station. A typical power consumption during a single optical
measurement (one cube) was ~400 mW, and each test took ~30 s.
Smartphone application
We created a custom-designed Android application to facilitate system
operation and data recording. Control software was designed using
MIT App Inventor 2. The application connected the smartphone to
the PAD system and sent the triggering signal for the fluorescence anisot-
ropy detection. The measured data were sent back to the phone and com-
bined with a time stamp and Global Positioning System coordinates.

Fluorescence anisotropy values were measured with the excitation and
emission wavelengths of 470 and 525 nm, respectively. Fluorescence
anisotropy (r) was calculated using the following equation: r =
(Ix – Iy)·(Ix + 2Iy)–1, where Ix and Iy are emission intensities when the
emission polarizers are in parallel with and perpendicular to the excita-
tion polarizer, respectively. The LOD was estimated by setting the
threshold at 3× SD above the background signal of samples without
bacteria. For comparison with the benchtop equipment (Sapphire 2,
Tecan), we measured ∆r = r − rFAM, where rFAM is the fluorescence
anisotropy only in the presence of FAM-DNA (62.5 nM) and r is the
fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of FAM-DNA (62.5 nM) along
with its template. We varied the template concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
and 60 nM) to produce different amounts of hybridized FAM-DNA.
Probe design
DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.
The list of DNA sequences is summarized in Table 1 and tables S1
and S3. For the universal and species-specific detection of pathogenic
bacteria, individual 16S rRNA sequences of different bacterial genera
[from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucle-
otide database] were aligned using MegAlign software (DNASTAR), and
both conserved and variable regions were selected as target sequences
(24). To detect ARV factors, the specific regions of nuc, femB, mecA,
and PVL (from the NCBI nucleotide database) were selected as target
sequences (17–20). The detection keys were designed to have a hairpin
structure joined by a single-stranded capture sequence (~20 to 25
nucleotides in length) (7, 25).
Lyophilization of master mix
An all-in-one PAD mix (20 ml) was concocted by mixing a detection
key (400 nM), a reporter (150 nM), a primer (150 nM), and FAM-
labeled DNA (125 nM) in 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 20 mM KCl, 5 mM
(NH4)2SO4, and 6 mM MgCl2. The mixture was first frozen in liquid
nitrogen and then dried in VirTis Freezemobile 25EL Freeze Dryer (SP
Scientific). The lyophilized reagents were stored at room temperature
and reconstituted before use by adding 20 ml of UltraPure DNase/
RNase-free distilled water (Life Technologies).
Experiment with cultured bacteria
All bacteria were purchased from the American Type Culture Collec-
tion (ATCC). Bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase in vendor-
recommended medium: E. coli (#25922) in LB medium (BD Biosciences);
P. aeruginosa (#142), K. pneumoniae (#43816), and MRSA (#BAA-1720
and #BAA-1707) in tryptic soy broth (BD Biosciences); A. baumannii
(#15149) in nutrient broth (BD Biosciences); and S. aureus (#25923)
in Staphylococcus broth (BD Biosciences). Bacteria were collected via
centrifugation (6000g, 10 min), and pellets were resuspended with the
preheated TRIzol (Life Technologies). The resuspended cells were
transferred to 2-ml Safe-Lock tubes (Eppendorf) containing sterilized
disruptor beads (0.1 mm; Scientific Industries) and lysed using a vortex
mixer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube.
RNA extraction
Bacterial lysate mixed with an equal volume of ethanol was flown
through the RNA extraction chamber, in which RNA was captured
by packed glass beads. Subsequent flushing with Direct-zol RNA Pre-
Wash (Zymo Research) and RNA Wash Buffer (Zymo Research) was
done to remove traces of impurities and chaotropic salts. Finally, RNA
was eluted in RNase-free water. For comparison of the fluidic cartridge
with a commercial column (Zymo-Spin column, Zymo Research), bac-
terial lysate was divided into two aliquots. One sample was processed by
the commercial column and the other by the fluidic cartridge. We
checked the quality of the extracted RNA through an electrophoretic assay
(2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent). RNA molecular weight ladder provided in
the kit (RNA 6000 Nano Chip, Agilent) was used as reference, and
electrophoretic runs were performed per the manufacturer’s protocol.
The analysis assigned RINs to samples, ranging from 1 to 10, where
1 indicates highly degraded RNA and 10 completely intact RNA.
PAD assay
The single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
using random priming with Promega’s Reverse Transcription System
as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The asymmetric PCR amplification
was then carried out in a total reaction volume of 25 ml containing 2.5 ml
of cDNA, 0.8 mM excess primer, 0.08 mM limiting primer (table S3),
1× PCR buffer [20 mM tris-HCl, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4, and
2 or 3 mM MgCl2], 0.2 mM deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP),
deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), and deoxycytidine triphosphate
(dCTP), 0.4 mM dUTP (Thermo Scientific), 2 U of Antarctic Thermo-
labile UDG (New England Biolabs), and 2.5 U of Maxima Hot Start Taq
DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). For the asymmetric PCR on a
miniaturized thermocycler (miniPCR, Amplyus), we used the following
cycling conditions: 25°C for 10 min and 94°C for 4 min; 35 cycles of
30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 30 s at 72°C; and an extension step of
10 min at 72°C. With a benchtop thermocycler (MasterCycler, Eppendorf),
the reaction conditions were 25°C for 10 min and 94°C for 4 min;

 35 cycles of 5 s at 94°C, 15 s at 56°C, and 15 s at 72°C; and a final 10 min
at 72°C. The PCR solution (20 ml) was mixed with an all-in-one PAD
mix composed of a detection key (200 nM) and a reporter that was pre-
formed with a template (75 nM), a primer (75 nM), and FAM-labeled
DNA (62.5 nM) at room temperature for 15 min, making a total volume
of 40 ml in 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 20 mM KCl, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4,
and 4 mM MgCl2.
UDG-mediated control of carryover contamination
To mimic the carryover contamination, we spiked dUTP-containing
amplification products (carryover contaminants) into new reaction
samples. The copy number of carryover contaminants was ~107; a
single aerosol after PCR typically contains as many as 106 amplification
products (26). The dUTP-containing amplicons were prepared following
the same procedures outlined above except that equal amounts of limiting
and excess primers were used. The obtained amplicons were purified
using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) and
quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm with NanoDrop
1000 (Thermo Scientific). The copy number was estimated on the basis
of the conversion factor (26 kD per amplicon).
Clinical samples
This study was approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board.
Excess and discarded samples were collected from nine subjects with
clinical suspicion for infected bodily fluid or abscess and referred for drain-
age. Specimens were collected using routine image-guided approaches
by Massachusetts General Hospital Interventional Radiology physi-
cians and analyzed blindly using the PAD assay. Specimens (500 ml)
were mixed with 1.5 ml of TRIzol LS (Life Technologies) which is more
concentrated than TRIzol, and the same RNA extraction procedure was
applied as in pure bacterial cultures.
Electrophoretic band-shift experiment
Solution containing 100 or 200 nM detection key, PCR products, and
12.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in 20 mM tris-
HCl (pH 8.3), 20 mM KCl, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 4 mM MgCl2 was
incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The solution was mixed
with 6× loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 20% poly-
acrylamide gel (Life Technologies). The analysis was carried out in 1×
TBE (100 mM tris, 90 mM borate, 1 mM EDTA) at 150 V for 160 min
at 4°C. After GelRed (Biotium) staining, gels were scanned using an
ultraviolet transilluminator. DNA polymerase was neither fluorescent
nor stained by the dye (27).
Quantitative real-time PCR
The cDNA derived from in vitro cultured bacteria or clinical samples
was mixed with 1× PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technol-
ogies) and 0.4 mM specific primers used in the PAD assay. Thermal
cycling was then carried out on the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Life Technologies) with the following conditions: UDG activation
(50°C, 2 min), initiation (95°C, 2 min); 40 cycles of denaturation (95°C,
5 s); annealing (56°C, 15 s); extension (72°C, 30 s). The 7500 Fast
software automatically calculates the Ct value, which represents the first
PCR cycle at which the fluorescence signal exceeds the signal of a given
uniform threshold. No-template control (NTC) remained undetected,
not crossing the established threshold for 40 cycles, and was arbitrarily
given a Ct value of 41. The DCt was generated by subtracting the Ct
value of the specimen from the Ct value of NTC (28).
