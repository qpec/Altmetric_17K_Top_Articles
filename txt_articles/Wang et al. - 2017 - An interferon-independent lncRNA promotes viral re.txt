 VIRAL IMMUNITY
An interferon-independent lncRNA
promotes viral replication by
modulating cellular metabolism
Pin Wang,1* Junfang Xu,2* Yujia Wang,2 Xuetao Cao1,2,3†
Viruses regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival.The molecules that are
responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but
are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral
replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by
its nearest coding gene Acod1, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection
through IFN-I–IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-
ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the
substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites
could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality.This work
reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral
infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.
M
etabolism is the source of energy and
materials for all biological processes.
The productive viral infection requires
changes to host cellular metabolic net-
works to obtain the building blocks for
the viral life cycle (1, 2). Positive-strand RNA vi-
ruses and enveloped viruses rewire lipid metab-
olism for replication (3, 4), and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) triggers tumorlike glutamine metabolism
in hepatocytes (5). Although some host- and virus-
encoded microRNAs have been shown to partly
mediate these alterations of metabolic pathways
(6), the molecular mechanisms involved are still
largely elusive—in particular, how viruses target
and regulate the host metabolic network for rep-
lication and escape from host defenses.
Thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
have been identified in mammalian genomes
(7), of which only a minority, but increasingly
more, have been functionally characterized in
different processes and diseases, including in-
fection (8, 9) and innate and adaptive immunity
(10–12). Interferon, especially type I interferon
(IFN-I), are vital cytokines that control viral in-
fection through activation of interferon-stimulated
genes (13, 14). Although some host lncRNAs have
been reported to regulate expression of these
genes or be regulated by interferon in viral in-
fection (15, 16), our knowledge about the function
of lncRNAs in infected cells is still very limited,
especially in regard to the mechanism by which
viruses hijack host metabolism for replication.
Currently, reported patterns of lncRNA function
are mainly focused on regulating gene expression
in the nucleus (17, 18) and influencing signaling
transduction or absorbing microRNAs in the cyto-
plasm (19–21). However, the mode of action of
lncRNAs remains to be fully understood. Whether
there are other unknown mechanisms of lncRNA
activity needs to be further explored.

infection and their relationship with the IFN-I

Downloaded from 
 system, we profiled lncRNA expression in wild-
type (WT) and IFN-I receptor–deficient (Ifnar−/−)
macrophages with or without vesicular stomati-
tis virus (VSV) infection. Interestingly, we identi-
fied a group of viral-induced, IFN-I–independent
lncRNAs: virus infection induced their expres-
sion regardless of IFN-I–receptor deficiency, where-
as IFN-I stimulation alone could not induce their
expression (fig. S1A). By performing RNA inter-
ference (RNAi)–mediated functional screening
of these IFN-I–independent lncRNAs, we found
that virus titer in macrophages was significantly
downregulated by knockdown of an intergenic
lncRNA (gene symbol LOC102637961) (fig. S1B),
whose nearest coding gene is Acod1 (aconitate
decarboxylase 1), named as lncRNA-ACOD1 here-
after. We confirmed that lncRNA-ACOD1 could
be stimulated by many types of viruses inde-
pendent of IFN-I (Fig. 1A), in contrast to IFN-
I–dependent lncRNA LOC625033 (fig. S1C).
Furthermore, lncRNA-ACOD1 is induced by viral
infection in most of the cells and organs studied
(Fig. 1, B and C). Expression of lncRNA-ACOD1
with a polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail was confirmed
by Northern blot (Fig. 1D). Rapid amplification
of cDNA ends and RNA-sequencing data revealed
that lncRNA-ACOD1 has three exons and two
transcript variants (2330 and 2259 nucleotides,
respectively) (fig. S2, A to C). lncRNA-ACOD1 has
a moderate expression level of about 100 tran-
script copies per cell (fig. S2D), and our ribosomal
profiling data revealed that it has very low ribo-
some occupancy (Fig. 1E), suggesting that lncRNA-
ACOD1 lacks coding potential.
The transcription factor interferon regulatory
factor 3 (IRF3) plays a vital role in IFN-I produc-
tion and function in viral infection (22). Using
IRF3-deficient (Irf3−/−) or Ifnar1−/− cells and mice,
we found that lncRNA-ACOD1 expression was
independent of IFN-I–IRF3 signaling (fig. S3).
However, our pharmacological inhibitor assay
revealed that lncRNA-ACOD1 expression was
largely dependent on nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
(fig. S4A), a transcription factor complex involved
in many types of cellular processes, including cel-
lular metabolism and inflammation (23). Accord-
ingly, we identified three binding sites for subunit
RelA of the NF-kB complex in the lncRNA-ACOD1
promoter sequence. Then, the promoter regions
either with or without a RelA-motif mutation were
cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase coding re-
gion (fig. S4, B and C, left). Luciferase expression
was high only when WT RelA motifs were present
and could be further enhanced by RelA over-
expression (fig. S4, B and C, right), suggesting that
NF-kB, but not the IFN-I–IRF3 pathway, partic-
ipates in the induction of lncRNA-ACOD1.
Next, we investigated the role of lncRNA-ACOD1
in viral infection. We found that knockdown of
lncRNA-ACOD1 (Fig. 2A) significantly reduced

 VSV burden in macrophages (Fig. 2, B and C).
This decrease in viral load was not due to a height-
ened host innate immune response, as IFN-I and
interleukin 6 production and effector-gene expres-
sion levels were also decreased by knockdown of
lncRNA-ACOD1 (fig. S5). Similar reductions of viral
load and innate response were also observed in
two other virus infections—DNA virus herpes sim-
plex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and vaccinia virus (VACV)
(fig. S6)—indicating that lncRNA-ACOD1 pro-
motes viral infection through a general mecha-
nism. We performed short-term infection assays
when viral entry had just completed, but before
replication had started, and showed that lncRNA-
ACOD1 had no effect on viral entry (fig. S7A). Then,
we used ultraviolet (UV)–irradiated VSV (UV-VSV),
which can infect cells but not proliferate, and
poly(I:C), which mimics virus RNA, to stimulate
cells. We found that lncRNA-ACOD1 had no effect
on UV-VSV and poly(I:C) responses (fig. S7, B and
C), indicating that lncRNA-ACOD1 acts at the stage
of viral replication in host cells. In addition, we
used CRISPR-Cas9 (24) to knock out lncRNA-
ACOD1 in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and
obtained similar results (fig. S8), further confirming
that lncRNA-ACOD1 is vital to viral replication.
To explore the role of lncRNA-ACOD1 in vivo,
we constructed lncRNA-ACOD1 knockout (lncRNA-
ACOD1−/−) mice (fig. S9, A and B). We found that
VSV replication in vivo was significantly reduced
in lncRNA-ACOD1–deficient mice (Fig. 2, D and
E), along with attenuated pathological changes
(Fig. 2F and fig. S9C) and decreased innate im-
mune responses (fig. S9, D and E). Moreover, all
lncRNA-ACOD1–deficient mice survived when
challenged with a lethal dose of VSV infection,
whereas most of the sibling controls died (Fig. 2G).
We also used a viral intranasal infection model to
test lncRNA-ACOD1 function in vivo and observed
similar results (fig. S10). In humans, a lncRNA-
ACOD1 ortholog was also upregulated in response
to viral infection by influenza A/PR/8/34 virus, and
its knockdown by RNA interference resulted in
a lower viral load in A549 human alveolar basal
epithelial cells (fig. S11), suggesting that the func-
tion of lncRNA-ACOD1 in promoting viral replica-
tion is conserved, at least in human and mouse.
Because lncRNA-ACOD1 expression is indepen-
dent of the IFN-I–IRF3 axis, we analyzed whether
lncRNA-ACOD1 function is also independent of
the IFN-I–IRF3 axis in vivo. Therefore, we gener-
ated double-knockout mice by breeding lncRNA-
ACOD1–deficient mice with Ifnar1−/− or Irf3−/−
mice. We found that, in the absence of IFN-I
signaling, deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 led to
a dramatic suppression of VSV proliferation, along
with alleviated immune responses (Fig. 2, H and
I, and fig. S12, A and B) and significantly lower
lethal rates (Fig. 2, J and K). Therefore, we pro-
pose that lncRNA-ACOD1 promotes viral repli-
cation, possibly through a previously unidentified
mechanism rather than through the canonical
IFN-I–IRF3 pathway.
To check if lncRNA-ACOD1 functions through
apoptosis and autophagy, which are reported to
be involved in viral clearance (25, 26), we tested
the effect of lncRNA-ACOD1 with flow cytometry
and immunoblot assay and found that host-cell
apoptosis and autophagy were not influenced
by lncRNA-ACOD1 (fig. S13). We then examined
whether lncRNA-ACOD1 acts in cis, affecting
nearby gene expression (fig. S14A). We found that
knockdown or deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 did
not affect the expression of nearby genes (fig.
S14, B and C) and vice versa (fig. S14D). We next
checked the location of lncRNA-ACOD1 in cells.
RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and re-
verse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
(fig. S15) suggested that lncRNA-ACOD1 is lo-
cated in cytoplasm, indicating that it might in-
teract with cytoplasmic molecules or proteins.
To gain clues into lncRNA-ACOD1 activity, we
performed microarray transcriptome analysis
and found that lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency led
to changes in the expression levels of many
metabolism-related genes (fig. S16A). Pathway
enrichment analysis with Gene-Cloud of Biotech-
nology Informa (GCBI) revealed that metabolic
pathways were the ones most significantly af-
fected by loss of lncRNA-ACOD1 (fig. S16, B and
C), indicating the possible role of lncRNA-ACOD1
in metabolic regulation during viral infection.
Therefore, we performed whole metabolomics sur-
veys using liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and found that viral
infection led to large metabolic changes in WT
cells, which was abolished by lncRNA-ACOD1
deficiency, as shown by the cluster map of iden-
tified negative and positive ions of intermediates
(fig. S17).
To search for lncRNA-ACOD1–interacting mol-
ecules in vivo, we purified endogenous lncRNA-
ACOD1 complexes using modified chromatin
isolation by RNA purification. After confirming
that lncRNA-ACOD1, rather than U6 RNA and
Actb mRNA (which served as negative controls),
was selectively retrieved (fig. S18), the lncRNA-
ACOD1–associated proteins were separated by gel
electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrom-
etry (MS). Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
(GOT2), a key metabolic enzyme involved in many
processes—including amino acid metabolism,
long-chain fatty acid uptake, and the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (27, 28)—was identified as a lncRNA-
ACOD1–binding protein, which was further con-
firmed by independent immunoblot assay (Fig. 3A).

Downloaded from 
 (native RIP) and UV cross-linking and immuno-
precipitation (UV-CLIP) assays both showed that
lncRNA-ACOD1, but not other tested RNAs, was
highly enriched in the GOT2 antibody-retrieved
complexes compared with the immunoglobulin G
(IgG)–retrieved sample, verifying the specificity of
the interaction in both mouse and human (Fig. 3B
and fig. S19). Our subcellular-fraction assay fur-
ther revealed that their interaction occurred in
the cytoplasm rather than in the mitochondria
(fig. S20). The dissociation constant of lncRNA-
ACOD1 and GOT2 is 1.51 ± 0.05 × 10−8 M (fig.
S21). We also found that lncRNA-ACOD1 had no
effect on GOT2 expression levels (fig. S22).
We then checked whether lncRNA-ACOD1 func-
tions through GOT2. After ruling out a possible
role in cell viability or other vital processes (fig.
S23), we found that GOT2 knockdown significantly
reduced VSV replication (Fig. 3, C and D) and
immune response (fig. S24, A and B) and pheno-
copied lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency in viral in-
fection. We also found that lncRNA-ACOD1
overexpression promoted viral replication and
immune response in control cells, whereas it had
no effect in GOT2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3E and
figs. S2 and S4C), indicating that knockdown
of GOT2 blocks lncRNA-ACOD1 activity. Fur-
thermore, supplementing cells with recombinant
active GOT2 rescued the effects of lncRNA-ACOD1
knockdown (Fig. 3F) and GOT2 knockdown (Fig.
3G) to promote viral replication. Based on these
data, we propose that virus-induced lncRNA-
ACOD1 feedback facilitates viral replication by
directly binding metabolic enzyme GOT2.
RNA sequencing of the GOT2 complex revealed
that a 5′ segment of lncRNA-ACOD1 (around nucleo-
tides 165 to 390) interacted with GOT2 (Fig. 4A).
Then, using full-length or 5′–binding site–deleted
lncRNA-ACOD1 to complement lncRNA-ACOD1
knockout macrophages, we found GOT2 binding
site–dependent rescue of viral replication (fig. S25).
GOT2 protein structure is highly conserved, with
a large domain, a small domain, and an amino-
terminal tail (Fig. 4B, top) (29). Two GOT2 protein
molecules form a biological homodimer, and two
homodimers construct an asymmetric unit (29),
which catalyzes reversible transamination between
metabolites, such as oxaloacetic acid and L-glutamic
acid into L-aspartate and a-ketoglutarate (30). To
understand how binding of lncRNA-ACOD1 af-
fects GOT2 function, we investigated which part
of GOT2 interacts with lncRNA-ACOD1 by binding-
peptide MS identification in the protease-digested
lncRNA-ACOD1 complex, and we found a 15-residue

Downloaded from 
 peptide (residues 54 to 68) from the small domain
of GOT2 as the binding site of lncRNA-ACOD1
(Fig. 4B, middle), which is relatively highly con-
served among vertebrates (Fig. 4B, bottom). By
using intact or fragment-deleted GOT2, our RIP
assay confirmed that this 15-residue region was
critical for lncRNA-ACOD1 binding (Fig. 4C).
Structurally, the binding peptide was spatially
close to the substrate site (4.2 Å between the
Gly65 residue and oxaloacetic acid) (fig. S26), in-
dicating that lncRNA-ACOD1 may affect enzy-
matic activity of GOT2. To test this hypothesis,
we used purified GOT2 protein and T7 RNA
polymerase–transcribed lncRNA to perform ki-
netic assays of enzymatic reactions in vitro. By
detecting the rate of L-aspartate output through
high-performance LC-MS, we found that GOT2
catalytic activity was enhanced by lncRNA-ACOD1,
which is dependent on its 5′ binding site, as the
catalytic rate constant (kcat) values show (Fig. 4D).
Furthermore, we also tried to determine the effect
of lncRNA-ACOD1 on GOT2 activity in vivo. We
found that GOT2 metabolites, L-aspartate and
a-ketoglutarate, were substantially reduced in
lncRNA-ACOD1–deficient mice in metabolite-
targeted LC-MS detection (Fig. 4E) and also in
our metabolomics data (table S1), indicating that
GOT2 enzymatic activity is depressed by lncRNA-
ACOD1 deficiency in vivo. We then checked if
GOT2 metabolites could rescue the depressed viral
replication in lncRNA-ACOD1–deficient mice. We
supplemented lncRNA-ACOD1−/− mice intraperito-
neally with L-aspartate or a-ketoglutarate before
VSV challenge and found that they promoted viral
replication in vivo and increased lethality (Fig. 4,
F and G). Taken together, our results demonstrate
that viral infection–induced lncRNA-ACOD1 feed-
back facilitates viral replication by promoting GOT2
catalytic activity and production of its metabolites.
Although metabolic enzymes have been iden-
tified as potential RNA-binding proteins in sys-
tematic approaches (31, 32), little is known about
their functional relevance and molecular mech-
anisms. We found thatthe aminotransferase GOT2
interacts with virus-induced lncRNA-ACOD1 at
its most conserved 15-residue section, which is
spatially close to the substrate niche, and, through
simulating GOT2 activity and production of its
metabolites, lncRNA-ACOD1 facilitates viral
replication and infection. In comparison to
the reported lncRNA working models (9, 33),
we identified a viral infection–induced lncRNA
regulated through NF-kB rather than the IFN-
I–IRF3 pathway, which operates through a meta-
bolic enzyme–binding mechanism to promote
viral infection. This represents a new way by
which viruses use host metabolic networks for
survival, which provides insights into metabolic
regulation and viral infection that may have rel-
evance for clinical diseases involving metabolic
dysfunction and viral infection, where lncRNA-
ACOD1 could be a useful target for intervention.
